<text>International development or global development is a broad concept denoting the idea that societies and countries have differing levels of economic or human development on an international scale. It is the basis for international classifications such as developed country, developing country and least developed country, and for a field of practice and research that in various ways engages with international development processes. There are, however, many schools of thought and conventions regarding which are the exact features constituting the &quot;development&quot; of a country.

Historically, development was largely synonymous with economic development, and especially its convenient but flawed quantification (see parable of the broken window) through readily gathered (for developed countries) or estimated monetary proxies (estimated for severely undeveloped or isolationist countries) such as gross domestic product (GDP), often viewed alongside actuarial measures such as life expectancy. More recently, writers and practitioners have begun to discuss development in the more holistic and multi-disciplinary sense of human development. Other related concepts are, for instance, competitiveness, quality of life or subjective well-being.

&quot;International development&quot; is different from the simple concept of &quot;development&quot;. Whereas the latter, at its most basic, denotes simply the idea of change through time, international development has come to refer to a distinct field of practice, industry, and research; the subject of university courses and professional categorisations. It remains closely related to the set of institutions—especially the Bretton Woods Institutions—that arose after the Second World War with a focus on economic growth, alleviating poverty, and improving living conditions in previously colonised countries. The international community has codified development aims in, for instance, the Millennium Development Goals (2000 to 2015) and the Sustainable Development Goals (2015 to 2030).
==Global Goals==

=== Sustainable Development Goals (2015 to 2030) ===
The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) served a successful framework to guide international development efforts, having achieved progress on some of the 8 goals. For example, by 2015 the extreme poverty rate had already been cut into half. Other targets achieved include access to safe drinking water, malaria, and gender equality in schooling. Yet, some scholars have argued that the MDGs lack the critical perspectives required to alleviate poverty and structures of inequality, reflected in the serious lags to achieving numerous other goals.

As the MDG era came to an end, 2015 marked the year that the United Nations General Assembly adopted a new agenda for development. Former UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon referred to this as a &quot;defining moment in history&quot; calling on states to &quot;act in solidarity&quot;. Succeeding the MDG agenda, 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were created, with 169 indicators. UN resolution 70/1 adopted on September 25, 2015, was titled &quot;Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development&quot;, solidifying 17 new goals that had been in motion since 2014. The goals came into force in January 2016, focusing on areas of climate change, economic inequality, democracy, poverty, and peacebuilding.

Although the SDGs were built on the foundation of the MDGs, there are some key differences in both processes. Before adoption, unlike the MDGs, the SDGs had been in discussion for months, involving civil society actors, NGOs, as well as an opening summit involving intergovernmental negotiations. The new global development agenda places a greater emphasis on collective action, combining the efforts of multiple stakeholders to increase the sustainability of the goals. This emphasis on sustainability has also led to more cross-sector partnerships, and combined international efforts across areas of environmental, social, cultural, political, and economic development.

=== Millennium Development Goals (2000 to 2015) ===
In 2000, United Nations signed the United Nations Millennium Declaration, which includes eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to be achieved by 2015. This represented the first time that a holistic strategy to meet the development needs of the world has been established, with measurable targets and defined indicators.

Because the MDGs were agreed as global targets to be achieved by the global community, they are independent of, but by no means unrelated to, individual national interests. The goals imply that every state has a set of obligations to the world community to meet and that other states, who have achieved those goals, have an obligation to help those who have not. As such they may represent an extension of the concept of human rights.

The first seven Millennium Development Goals present measurable goals, while the eighth lists a number of &#x27;stepping stone&#x27; goals – ways in which progress towards the first seven goals could be made. Each goal uses indicators based on statistical series collected and maintained by respected organisations in each relevant field (usually the UN agency responsible but also the OECD, IMF and World Bank)

The MDGs have catalysed a significant amount of action, including new initiatives such as Millennium Promise. Most of these initiatives however work in small scale interventions which do not reach the millions of people required by the MDGs.

Recent praise has been that it will be impossible to meet the first seven goals without meeting the eighth by forming a &quot;Global Partnership for Development&quot;. No current organisation has the capacity to dissolve the enormous problems of the developing world alone – especially in cities, where an increasing number of poor people live – as demonstrated by the almost nonexistent progress on the goal of improving the lives of at least 100 Million slum dwellers.

The Institution of Civil Engineers &quot;Engineering Without Frontiers&quot; panel and its recommendations, and the 2007 Brunel Lecture by the ICE&#x27;s 2009–2010 president Paul Jowitt, are representative of a change of approach in the UK at least to start drawing together the huge capacity available to western governments, industry, academia and charity to develop such a partnership.

===Other goals===
International development also aims to improve general government policies of these developing countries. &quot;State building&quot; is the strengthening of regional institutions necessary to support long-term economic, social, and political development. Education is another important aspect of international development. It is a good example of how the focus today is on sustainable development in these countries; education gives people the skills required to keep themselves out of poverty.

==Concepts==
International development is related to the concept of international aid, but is distinct from, disaster relief and humanitarian aid. While these two forms of international support seek to alleviate some of the problems associated with a lack of development, they are most often short term fixes – they are not necessarily long-term solutions. International development, on the other hand, seeks to implement long-term solutions to problems by helping developing countries create the necessary capacity needed to provide such sustainable solutions to their problems. A truly sustainable development project is one which will be able to carry on indefinitely with no further international involvement or support, whether it be financial or otherwise.

International development projects may consist of a single, transformative project to address a specific problem or a series of projects targeted at several aspects of society. Promoted projects are ones which involve problem solving that reflects the unique culture, politics, geography, and economy of a region. More recently, the focus in this field has been projects that aim towards empowering women, building local economies, and caring for the environment.

In context of human development it usually encompasses foreign aid, governance, healthcare, education, poverty reduction, gender equality, disaster preparedness, infrastructure, economics, human rights, environment and issues associated with these.

During recent decades, development thinking has shifted from modernization and structural adjustment programs to poverty reduction. Under the former system, poor countries were encouraged to undergo social and economical structural transformations as part of their development, creating industrialization and intentional industrial policy. Poverty reduction rejects this notion, consisting instead of direct budget support for social welfare programs that create macroeconomic stability leading to an increase in economic growth.

The concept of poverty can apply to different circumstances depending on context. Poverty is the condition of lacking economic access to fundamental human needs such as food, shelter and safe drinking water. While some define poverty primarily in economic terms, others consider social and political arrangements also to be intrinsic – often manifested in a lack of dignity.

=== Theories ===

There are a number of theories about how desirable change in society is best achieved. Such theories draw on a variety of social scientific disciplines and approaches, and include historical theories such as:
* Modernization Theory
* Dependency Theory
* World Systems Theory
* Neoliberalism
* Good governance
* Capability approach
* Postdevelopment theory

=== International economic inequality ===


International development institutions and international organisations such as the UN promote the realisation of the fact that economic practices such as rapid globalisation and certain aspects of international capitalism can lead to, and, allegedly, have led to an economic divide between countries, sometimes called the north–south divide. Such organisations often make it a goal and to help reduce these divides by encouraging co-operation amongst the Global South and other practices and policies that can accomplish this.

International development can also cause inequality between richer and poorer factions of one nation&#x27;s society. For example, when economic growth boosts development and industrialisation, it can create a class divide by creating demand for more educated people in order to maintain corporate and industrial profitability. Thus the popular demand for education, which in turn drives the cost of education higher through the principle of supply and demand, as people would want to be part of the new economic elite. Higher costs for education lead to a situation where only the people with enough money to pay for education can receive sufficient education to qualify for the better-paying jobs that mass-development brings about. This restricts poorer people to lesser-paying jobs but technological development makes some of these jobs obsolete (for example, by introducing electronic machines to take over a job, such as creating a series of machines such as lawn mowers to make people such as gardeners obsolete). This leads to a situation where poorer people cannot improve their lives as easily as they could have in a less developed society. That is partially why institutions such as the Center for Global Development are searching for &quot;pro-poor&quot; economic policies.

===Dignity===
Modern poverty reduction and development programmes often have dignity as a central theme. Dignity is also a central theme of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the very first article of which starts with:

:&quot;All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.&quot;

The concept of dignity in development has been extensively explored by many, and related to all of the development sectors. For example, in &quot;Development with Dignity&quot; Amit Bhaduri argues that full employment with dignity for all is both important and possible in India, while the UN Millennium Project&#x27;s task force on Water and Sanitation links the sector directly to dignity in the report &quot;Health, Dignity and Development: What will it take?&quot;. The Asian Human Rights Commission released a statement in 2006 claiming that:
* Humanizing Development Global Photography Campaign 

===Participation===


The concept of participation is concerned with ensuring that the intended beneficiaries of development projects and programmes are themselves involved in the planning and execution of those projects and programmes. This is considered important as it empowers the recipients of development projects to influence and manage their own development – thereby removing any culture of dependency. It is widely considered to be one of the most important concepts in modern development theory. The &quot;UN System Network on Rural Development and Food Security&quot; describes participation as:

Local participants in development projects are often products of oral communities. This has led to efforts to design project planning and organizational development methods, such as participatory rural appraisal, which are accessible to non-literate people.

===Appropriateness===
The concept of something being appropriate is concerned with ensuring that a development project or programme is of the correct scale and technical level, and is culturally and socially suitable for its beneficiaries. This should not be confused with ensuring something is low-technology, cheap or basic – a project is appropriate if it is acceptable to its recipients and owners, economically affordable and sustainable in the context in which it is executed.

For example, in a rural sub-Saharan community it may not be appropriate to provide a chlorinated and pumped water system because it cannot be maintained or controlled adequately – simple hand pumps may be better; while in a big city in the same country it would be inappropriate to provide water with hand pumps, and the chlorinated system would be the correct response.

The economist E. F. Schumacher championed the cause of appropriate technology and founded the organization ITDG (Intermediate Technology Design Group), which develops and provides appropriate technologies for development (ITDG has now been renamed Practical Action).

The concept of right-financing has been developed to reflect the need for public and private financial support systems that foster and enable development, rather than hinder it.

===Sustainable development===

===Capacity building===

===Rights-based approach===
Rights-based approach to development has been adopted by many nongovernmental organizations and the United Nations as the new approach to international development. Rights-based approach combines many different concepts of international development, such as capacity building, human rights, participation, and sustainability. The goal of the rights-based approach to development is to empower the rights-holders, or the group that does not exercise full rights, and strengthen the capacity of the duty-bearers, or the institution or government obligated to fill these rights.

==Practice==

===Measurement===

The judging of how developed a country or a community is highly subjective, often highly controversial, and very important in judging what further development is necessary or desirable.

There are many different measures of human development, many of them related to the different sectors above. Some of them are:
* National GDP
* Literacy rates
* Life expectancy
* Human Development Index
* Gini coefficient
* Human Security Index – see external link and mention on Human security
* Per capita income
* Maternal survival rate
* HIV infection rates
* Number of doctors per capita

An interesting way of seeing development is through modernization. This includes electronification of households and increases in phone plans. This does not accurately convey social development although it is hard to precisely measure, and institutions differ greatly in their methods. This goes into the debate on whether economic growth causes social growth or vice versa. Indicators of social change can be used to complement economic factors as indicators of development and in formulating development policies.

In a multi-country review of development progress, improved outcomes on these measures has generally been found to be driven by a combination of smart leadership, policies, institutions, and social networks, according to the Overseas Development Institute.

===Migration and remittance===
Migration has throughout history also led to significant international development. As people move, their culture, knowledge, skills and technologies move with them. Migrants&#x27; ties with their past homes and communities lead to international relationships and further flows of goods, capital and knowledge. The value of remittances sent home by migrants in modern times is much greater than the total in international aid given.

===Sectors===
International development and disaster relief are both often grouped into sectors, which correlate with the major themes of international development (and with the Millennium Development Goals – which are included in the descriptions below). There is no clearly defined list of sectors, but some of the more established and universally accepted sectors are further explored here. The sectors are highly interlinked, illustrating the complexity of the problems they seek to deal with.

====Water and sanitation====
In development, this is the provision of water and sanitation (toilets, bathing facilities, a healthy environment) of sufficient quantity and quality to supply an acceptable standard of living. This is different from a relief response, where it is the provision of water and sanitation in sufficient quantity and quality to maintain life.

The provision of water and sanitation is an engineering challenge, as well as a societal and political challenge as it includes education and behaviour change elements and is closely connected with shelter, politics and human rights.

The seventh Millennium Development Goal was to &quot;ensure environmental sustainability&quot;, including &quot;reducing by half the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water&quot; and &quot;achieving significant improvement in lives of at least 100 million slum dwellers, by 2020&quot;. UN-Water, a body of 26 UN agencies that work on water issues, is responsible for the triennial UN World Water Development Report which monitors progress towards the Millennium Development Goals related to water. The World Water Assessment Programme, which produces the Report, has articulated how eight of the MDGs are linked to water resources.

====Health====
This is provision of access to quality healthcare to the population in an efficient and consistent manner and according to their needs. The standard and level of provision that is acceptable or appropriate depends on many factors and is highly specific to country and location. For example, in a large city (whether in a &#x27;developing&#x27; country or not), it is appropriate and often practical to provide a high standard hospital which can offer a full range of treatments; in a remote rural community it may be more appropriate and practical to provide a visiting healthworker on a periodic basis, possibly with a rural clinic serving several different communities.

The provision of access to healthcare is both an engineering challenge as it requires infrastructure such as hospitals and transport systems and an education challenge as it requires qualified healthworkers and educated consumers.

The fourth Millennium Development Goal is to &quot;reduce by two thirds the mortality rate among children under five&quot;.

The fifth Millennium Development Goal is to &quot;reduce by three quarters the maternal mortality ratio&quot;.

The sixth Millennium Development Goal is to &quot;halt and begin to reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS&quot; and to &quot;halt and begin to reverse the incidence of malaria and other major diseases&quot;.

Reaching these goals is also a management challenge. Health services need to make the best use of limited resources while providing the same quality of care to every man, woman and child everywhere. Achieving this level of services requires innovation, quality improvement and expansion of public health services and programs. The main goal is to make public health truly public.

Examples of organizations working in health are:
* World Health Organization
* Partners in Health
* Results for Development Institute
* Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization

====Education====
The provision of education often focuses on providing free primary level education, but also covers secondary and higher education. A lack of access to education is one of the primary limits on human development, and is related closely to every one of the other sectors. Almost every development project includes an aspect of education as development by its very nature requires a change in the way people live.

The second Millennium Development Goal is to &quot;Provide universal primary education&quot;.

The provision of education is itself an education challenge, as it requires qualified teachers who must be trained in higher education institutions. However, donors are unwilling to provide support to higher education because their policies now target the MDG. The result is that students are not educated by qualified professionals and worse, when they graduate from primary school they are inducted into a secondary school system that is not able to accommodate them.

====Shelter====
The provision of appropriate shelter is concerned with providing suitable housing for families and communities. It is highly specific to context of culture, location, climate and other factors. In development, it is concerned with providing housing of an appropriate quality and type to accommodate people in the long term. This is distinct from shelter in relief, which is concerned with providing sufficient shelter to maintain life.

Examples of organisations specialising in shelter are:
* UN-HABITAT (development)
* UNHCR (relief)
* Shelter Centre (relief)
* Architecture for Humanity (relief and development)
* Article 25 (relief and development)
* ARCHIVE Global (development)

====Human rights====
The provision of human rights is concerned with ensuring that all people everywhere receive the rights conferred on them by International human rights instruments. There are many of these, but the most important for international development are:
* The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and its associated treaties
* The Convention on the Rights of the Child
* The Geneva Conventions (this is of more relevance to relief and military practices than development)

Human rights covers a huge range of topics. Some of those more relevant to international development projects include rights associated with gender equality, justice, employment, social welfare and culture.

The third Millennium Development Goal was to &quot;promote gender equality and empower women&quot; by &quot;eliminating gender disparity in primary and secondary education preferably by 2005, and at all levels by 2015.&quot;

Accomplishing this goal could assist in the achievement of five of the other eight Millennium Development Goals. Goals 1–6 are in direct correlation with the status of women in the communities of problem countries such as The Democratic Republic of Congo, Sub-Saharan Africa and many of the developing nations. The low social stature of a woman inhibits her abilities to truly impact her community in astonishing ways. Noting the relationship between mother and offspring, Goals 1, 4 and 5 are ones to feel the wrath of poor social status. An unhealthy mother simply cannot bear a healthy child, let alone nurse a sickly one back to health, without access to adequate nutrition. A mother characteristically takes most of the care of a child, therefore must have the resources available to not only support herself but another human as well. Without these resources, if she has not already succumbed to birthing complications, a woman cannot survive the perils of poverty and hunger and support her child simultaneously.

In a different spectrum of societal norms the Goals 2 and 6 are being threatened by an age old privilege. Historically females have been refused education in pardon of males, resulting in lesser opportunity to thrive economically. Giving women equal access to an adequate education brings the global community steps closer to achieving universal primary education. Along with this education will come proper spread of knowledge regarding safe practices in disease avoidance. Women are increasingly falling victim to HIV/AIDS for reasons easily evaded. Increasing the availability of a proper education to women will be remarkably beneficial on a variety of fronts. To promote gender equality is to promote progress towards global development.

====Livelihoods====
This is concerned with ensuring that all people are able to make a living for themselves and provide themselves with an adequate standard of living, without compromising their human rights and while maintaining dignity.

The first Millennium Development Goal is to &quot;reduce by half the proportion of people living on less than a dollar a day&quot; and &quot;reduce by half the proportion of people who suffer from hunger&quot;.

The concept of livelihoods is directly drawn from the Sustainable Livelihoods Approach (SLA) to international development. The approach and subsequent practical framework is credited to Robert Chambers, who, writing from the mid-1980s and onward, was interested in fostering efficiency in development cooperation. The approach was later developed and utilized by the United Kingdom&#x27;s Department for International Development (DFID). The approach is considered to be more comprehensive than previous theories and methodology of &quot;conventional&quot; development initiatives. The core concepts include: taking a holistic view, building on community and individual strengths, focusing on linking both macro and micro-level thinking, sustainability, and maintaining a dynamic and ever-evolving framework. 

====Finance====
Several organisations and initiatives exist which are concerned with providing financial systems and frameworks which allow people to organise or purchase services, items or projects for their own development.

The 2006 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded jointly to Muhammad Yunus and the Grameen Bank, which he founded, for their work in providing microcredit to the poor.

==Concerns==

The terms &quot;developed&quot; and &quot;developing&quot; (or &quot;underdeveloped&quot;) have proven problematic in forming policy as they ignore issues of wealth distribution and the lingering effects of colonialism. Some theorists see development efforts as fundamentally neo-colonial, in which a wealthier nation forces its industrial and economic structure on a poorer nation, which will then become a consumer of the developed nation&#x27;s goods and services. Post-developmentalists, for example, see development as a form of Western cultural imperialism that hurts the people of poor countries and endangers the environment to such an extent that they suggest rejection of development altogether.

Other scholars have sought to widen the notion of &quot;developing&quot; to encompass all countries, as even the wealthiest and most industrialised of countries face problems of social exclusion and inequality. This points to the widespread critiques of the language of development practice, from the Cold War-era terminology of &quot;Third World&quot; to the subsequent bifurcation of &quot;developed&quot; and &quot;developing&quot; countries. The phrases &quot;Global North&quot; and &quot;Global South&quot; are similarly imprecise (particularly from a geographical standpoint, as Australia, for instance, is considered part of the Global North). Other terms currently in use as synonyms for &quot;Global South&quot; include &quot;majority world&quot; and &quot;low- and middle-income countries&quot;. The latter term allows for greater specificity, for instance in differentiating between lower-middle and upper-middle-income countries, but it has the downside of overemphasising the economic aspects of development at the expense of social, political and cultural rights and freedoms. These linguistic issues reflect conceptual tensions related to the framing of development.

==History==
Although international relations and international trade have existed for thousands of years, it is only in the past century that international development theory emerged as a separate body of ideas. More specifically, it has been suggested that &#x27;the theory and practice of development is inherently technocratic, and remains rooted in the high modernist period of political thought that existed in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War&#x27;. Throughout the 20th century, before the concept of international development became a common word, four aspects were used to describe the idea:
* political and economic liberalism, and the significance of &quot;free markets&quot;
* social evolution in extremely hierarchical environment
* Marxist critiques of class and imperialism
* anti-colonial take on cultural differences and national self-determination

===After World War II===
The second half of the 20th century has been called the &#x27;era of development&#x27;. The origins of this era have been attributed to
* the need for reconstruction in the immediate aftermath of World War II
* the evolution of colonialism or &quot;colonization&quot; into globalization and the establishment of new free trade policies between so-called &#x27;developed&#x27; and &#x27;underdeveloped&#x27; nations
* the start of the Cold War and the desire of the United States and its allies to prevent the Third World from drifting towards communism

International Development in its very meaning is geared towards colonies that gained independence. The governance of the newly independent states should be constructed so that the inhabitants enjoy freedom from poverty, hunger, and insecurity.

It has been argued that this era was launched on January 20, 1949, when Harry S. Truman made these remarks in his inaugural address

Before this date, however, the United States had already taken a leading role in the creation of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (now part of the World Bank Group) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), both established in 1944, and in the United Nations in 1945.

The launch of the Marshall Plan was another important step in setting the agenda for international development, combining humanitarian goals with the creation of a political and economic bloc in Europe that was allied to the U.S. This agenda was given conceptual support during the 1950s in the form of modernization theory espoused by Walt Rostow and other American economists. The changes in the &#x27;developed&#x27; world&#x27;s approach to international development were further necessitated by the gradual collapse of Western Europe&#x27;s empires over the next decades; now independent ex-colonies no longer received support in return for their subordinate role.

By the late 1960s, dependency theory arose analysing the evolving relationship between the West and the Third World. In the 1970s and early 1980s, the modernists at the World Bank and IMF adopted the neoliberal ideas of economists such as Milton Friedman or Béla Balassa, which were implemented in the form of structural adjustment programs, while their opponents were promoting various &#x27;bottom-up&#x27; approaches, ranging from civil disobedience and critical consciousness to appropriate technology and Rapid Rural Appraisal.

In response, various parts of the UN system led a counter movement, which in the long run has proved to be successful. They were led initially by the International Labour Organization (ILO), influenced by Paul Streeten, then by United Nations International Children&#x27;s Emergency Fund (UNICEF). Then United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) put forward the concept of Human Development, thanks to Mahboub ul Haq and Amartya Sen, thus changing the nature of the development dialogue to focus on human needs and capabilities.

By the 1990s, there were some writers for whom development theory had reached an impasse and some academics were &quot;imagining a postdevelopment era&quot;. The Cold War had ended, capitalism had become the dominant mode of social organization, and UN statistics showed that living standards around the world had improved over the past 40 years. Nevertheless, a large portion of the world&#x27;s population were still living in poverty, their governments were crippled by debt and concerns about the environmental impact of globalization were rising.

In response to the impasse, the rhetoric of development is now focusing on the issue of poverty, with the metanarrative of modernization being replaced by shorter-term vision embodied by the Millennium Development Goals and the Human Development approach. At the same time, some development agencies are exploring opportunities for public-private partnerships and promoting the idea of Corporate social responsibility with the apparent aim of integrating international development with the process of economic globalization.

The critics have suggested that this integration has always been part of the underlying agenda of development. They argue that poverty can be equated with powerlessness and that the way to overcome poverty is through emancipatory social movements and civil society, not paternalistic aid programmes or corporate charity.

While some critics have been debating the &quot;end of development&quot; others have predicted a development revival as part of the War on Terrorism. To date, however, there is limited evidence to support the notion that aid budgets are being used to counter Islamic fundamentalism in the same way that they were used 40 years ago to counter communism.

<text>Kelly Wayne Gruber (born February 26, 1962) is an American former Major League Baseball (MLB) third baseman. He played for the Toronto Blue Jays and California Angels from 1984 to 1993. He was a two-time MLB All-Star and won a Gold Glove Award and Silver Slugger Award in 1990.

==Early life==
Gruber was born on February 26, 1962. Gruber played baseball at Westlake High School in Austin, Texas, where his number was later retired.

==Early career==
He was drafted by the Cleveland Indians in the 1st round (10th pick) of the 1980 amateur draft but did not sign with the team. On December 5, 1983, the Toronto Blue Jays picked him up in the Rule 5 draft. Gruber saw his first MLB action shortly thereafter, playing in his first game on April 20, 1984. Over the next three seasons, he split time between MLB and the minor leagues, earning an everyday spot in the Toronto line-up by 1987. The Toronto media quickly nicknamed him &quot;Xanthos&quot; (meaning blonde) after his long flowing blonde hair. During his stay in Toronto he was voted the city&#x27;s most eligible bachelor.

==Best years==
On April 16, 1989, Gruber was the first Blue Jay in history to hit for the cycle when he got four hits in six at–bats with six RBI and four runs scored. His cycle occurred in the following order: home run, double, triple, and single. He was told to stop at first for his single even though a double was easily attainable.
Gruber had his best season in 1990, hitting .274 with 31 home runs, 118 RBIs and 14 stolen bases, winning Gold Glove and Silver Slugger awards and ending up fourth in MVP balloting that year.

Gruber was a member of the 1992 World Series-winning Blue Jay team, and was involved in one of the most controversial plays in World Series history. In the fourth inning of Game 3, Gruber appeared to make a diving tag on Braves runner Deion Sanders&#x27; foot to record the third out of a triple play, which would have been only the second such play in World Series history. However, the second-base umpire ruled Sanders safe. Gruber tore his rotator cuff on the play; however, he hit a key game-tying home run in the eighth inning, and the Jays won the game in walk-off fashion, later taking the series in six games.

==Later career==
Gruber was traded to the California Angels for Luis Sojo in December 1992. Soon after his arrival, Gruber announced that he had bulging discs in his neck. Just over two months after the trade, Gruber had shoulder surgery to repair a rotator cuff tear. Gruber was expected to be sidelined for at least eight weeks. Angels manager Buck Rodgers was angered over the news of Gruber&#x27;s surgery; he felt that the Blue Jays must have known about the extent of Gruber&#x27;s injury before they traded him. Rodgers said that Rene Gonzales would be the team&#x27;s third baseman that year.

Gruber returned to action in June, but after playing in only 18 games, Gruber went back on the disabled list with continued neck and shoulder problems the next month. In September, the team placed Gruber on waivers. He was owed $4 million for the 1993 season, but the Blue Jays agreed to pay $1.7 million of that total.

In 1997, Gruber attempted a comeback with the Baltimore Orioles. While his performance was good enough to impress coaches and staff with the Orioles, Gruber decided to retire for good due to health-related concerns.

==Personal==
Gruber makes public appearances as a motivational speaker for charitable organizations and holds baseball seminars throughout North America.

On June 16, 2018, he made numerous controversial and offensive remarks at a PitchTalks event in Toronto, some directed at moderator Ashley Docking, prompting his uninviting from the upcoming Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame festivities.

In 1992, Gruber published his autobiography, &quot;Kelly, At Home on Third&quot;.

<doc id="385748" wikidata="Q189899" url="?curid=385748" title="Super high frequency">
<text>Super high frequency (SHF) is the ITU designation for radio frequencies (RF) in the range between 3 and 30 gigahertz (GHz). This band of frequencies is also known as the centimetre band or centimetre wave as the wavelengths range from one to ten centimetres. These frequencies fall within the microwave band, so radio waves with these frequencies are called microwaves. The small wavelength of microwaves allows them to be directed in narrow beams by aperture antennas such as parabolic dishes and horn antennas, so they are used for point-to-point communication and data links and for radar. This frequency range is used for most radar transmitters, wireless LANs, satellite communication, microwave radio relay links, satellite phones (S band), and numerous short range terrestrial data links. They are also used for heating in industrial microwave heating, medical diathermy, microwave hyperthermy to treat cancer, and to cook food in microwave ovens.

Frequencies in the SHF range are often referred to by their IEEE radar band designations: S, C, X, Ku, K, or Ka band, or by similar NATO or EU designations.

==Propagation==

Microwaves propagate solely by line of sight; because of the small refraction due to their short wavelength, the groundwave and ionospheric reflection (skywave or &quot;skip&quot; propagation) seen with lower frequency radio waves do not occur. Although in some cases they can penetrate building walls enough for useful reception, unobstructed rights of way cleared to the first Fresnel zone are usually required. Wavelengths are small enough at microwave frequencies that the antenna can be much larger than a wavelength, allowing highly directional (high gain) antennas to be built which can produce narrow beams. Therefore, they are used in point-to-point terrestrial communications links, limited by the visual horizon to 30–40 miles (48–64 km). Such high gain antennas allow frequency reuse by nearby transmitters. They are also used for communication with spacecraft since the waves are not refracted (bent) when passing through the ionosphere like lower frequencies.

The wavelength of SHF waves creates strong reflections from metal objects the size of automobiles, aircraft, and ships, and other vehicles. This and the narrow beamwidths possible with high gain antennas and the low atmospheric attenuation as compared with higher frequencies make SHF the main frequencies used in radar. Attenuation and scattering by moisture in the atmosphere increase with frequency, limiting the use of high SHF frequencies for long range applications.

Small amounts of microwave energy are randomly scattered by water vapor molecules in the troposphere. This is used in troposcatter communications systems, operating at a few GHz, to communicate beyond the horizon. A powerful microwave beam is aimed just above the horizon; as it passes through the tropopause some of the microwaves are scattered back to Earth to a receiver beyond the horizon. Distances of 300 km can be achieved. These are mainly used for military communication.

==Antennas==
The wavelength of SHF waves is short enough that efficient transmitting antennas are small enough to be conveniently mounted on handheld devices, so these frequencies are widely used for wireless applications. For example a quarter wave whip antenna for the SHF band is between 2.5 and 0.25 centimeters long. Omnidirectional antennas have been developed for applications like wireless devices and cellphones that are small enough to be enclosed inside the device&#x27;s case. The main antenna used for these devices is the printed inverted F antenna (PIFA) consisting of a monopole antenna bent in an L shape, fabricated of copper foil on the printed circuit board inside the device. Small sleeve dipoles or quarter-wave monopoles are also used. The patch antenna is another common type, often integrated into the skin of aircraft.

The wavelengths are also small enough that SHF waves can be focused into narrow beams by high gain directional antennas from a half meter to five meters in diameter. Directive antennas at SHF frequencies are mostly aperture antennas, such as parabolic antennas (the most common type), lens, slot and horn antennas. Large parabolic antennas can produce very narrow beams of a few degrees or less, and often must be aimed with the aid of a boresight. Another type of antenna practical at microwave frequencies is the phased array, consisting of many dipoles or patch antennas on a flat surface, each fed through a phase shifter, which allows the array&#x27;s beam to be steered electronically. The short wavelength requires great mechanical rigidity in large antennas, to ensure that the radio waves arrive at the feed point in phase.

===Waveguide===
At microwave frequencies, the types of cable (transmission line) used to conduct lower frequency radio waves, such as coaxial cable, have high power losses. Therefore, to transport microwaves between the transmitter or receiver and the antenna with low losses, a special type of metal pipe called waveguide must be used. Because of the high cost and maintenance requirements of long waveguide runs, in many microwave antennas the output stage of the transmitter or the RF front end of the receiver is located at the antenna.

==Advantages==
SHF frequencies occupy a &quot;sweet spot&quot; in the radio spectrum which is currently being exploited by many new radio services. They are the lowest frequency band where radio waves can be directed in narrow beams by conveniently sized antennas so they do not interfere with nearby transmitters on the same frequency, allowing frequency reuse. On the other hand, they are the highest frequencies which can be used for long distance terrestrial communication; higher frequencies in the EHF (millimeter wave) band are highly absorbed by the atmosphere, limiting practical propagation distances to one kilometer or less. The high frequency gives microwave communication links a very large information-carrying capacity (bandwidth). In recent decades many new solid state sources of microwave energy have been developed, and microwave integrated circuits for the first time allow significant signal processing to be done at these frequencies. Sources of EHF energy are much more limited and in an earlier state of development.

<text>Bromyard is a town in the parish of Bromyard and Winslow, in Herefordshire, England, in the valley of the River Frome. It is near the county border with Worcestershire on the A44 between Leominster and Worcester. Bromyard has a number of traditional half-timbered buildings, including some of the pubs; the parish church is Norman. For centuries, there was a livestock market in the town.

==History==

Bromyard is mentioned in Bishop Cuthwulf&#x27;s charter of c. 840. Cudwulf established a &quot;monasterium&quot; at &quot;Bromgeard&quot; behind a &#x27;thorny enclosure&#x27; with the permission of King Behrtwulf, King of the Mercians. Ealdorman Aelfstan, the local magnate, was granted between 500 and 600 acres of land for a &quot;villa&quot; beside the River Frome. The settlement in the Plegelgate Hundred was allocated 30 hides for &#x27;the gap [in the forest] where the deer play.&#x27; The county court assembly was on Flaggoner&#x27;s Green, now a hill in the modern borough and where the cricket club is situated. 42 villani (villeins, villagers), 9 bordars (smallholders), and 8 slaves were recorded in the Domesday Book entry in 1086, one of the largest communities in Herefordshire.

The first mention of the spelling &quot;Bromyard&quot; was in Edward I&#x27;s &quot;Taxatio Ecclesiasticus&quot; on the occasion of a perambulation of the forest boundaries to set up a model for Parlements in 1291. It began to appear regularly in the church and court records of the 14th century.

Like Leominster, Ledbury, and Ross-on-Wye, the town and fair at the manor of Bromyard was probably founded in &quot;c&quot;1125 during the episcopate of Richard de Capella (1121–1127). As with those other three towns, the bishops of Hereford had had a manor and minster there since Anglo-Saxon times. As at Ledbury the church was collegiate, with an establishment of clergy known as &quot;portioners&quot;, but without a master and common seal. Surveys for the bishop made c. 1285 and 1575-80 give valuable information about the town&#x27;s first few centuries. Bromyard contained 255 burgage and landowner tenancies in the 1280s which paid a total rent of £23 10s 7 1/2d to the bishop. A Toll Shop at Schallenge House (&quot;Pie Powder&quot; from &quot;pieds a poudre&quot;) was where market tolls were paid and summary jurisdiction dealt out.

After the Reformation (1545) there were 800 communicants making Bromyard then &quot;a markett toune...greately Replenyshed with People&quot;, the third town in the county with a population of about 1200 souls. By 1664 Bromyard had fallen behind Leominster, Ledbury and Ross in population. Besides the central town area, the large parish used to consist of the three townships of Winslow, Linton, and Norton; these areas were civil parishes in the 20th century.

During the Civil Wars, Prince Rupert&#x27;s troops in March 1645 &quot;brought all their [power] on Bromyard and Ledbury side, fell on, plundered every parish and house, poor as well as others, leaving neither clothes nor provision, killed all the young lambs in the country, though not above a week old. Charles I stayed the night in Bromyard at Mrs Baynham&#x27;s house (now Tower House) on 3 September 1645 on his way to Hereford In 1648, Parliament ordered the sale of the cathedral&#x27;s property in Bromyard Forrens (i.e. outside the borough) for £594 9s 2d.

Bromyard Grammar School was re-founded in 1566 after the original chantry endowments had been nationalised. In 1656, the City of London Alderman John Perrin, from Bromyard, left the school £20 per annum, to be paid through the Goldsmiths Company. The company improved the school buildings in 1835. The building still stands in Church Street, but the school became part of the first comprehensive school in Herefordshire in 1969, now known as Queen Elizabeth High School. A Congregational Chapel was built in 1701.

===Commercial centre===


For centuries, market day was always held on a Monday at Bromyard. The market town was a centre for agriculture with a fair for selling produce grown locally; as well as beef, there were hops, apples and pears, and soft fruit remained vital late into the post-war era. Some farms remained in the church&#x27;s hands until the late 20th century. The carrier system also operated in Bromyard, within a given radius of the Teme to the north, Frome Hill to the east, and Lugg to the south. The dealers brought supplies to the many outlets, pubs, inns, traders and by the 19th century the shops.

In 1751, Bromyard obtained a Turnpike Trust that established a toll road as far as Canon Frome, with some minor roads turnpiked to prevent tax evasion. By 1830 town&#x27;s fortunes had flagged down to only fifth in the county from second 300 years before; its stage wagons visited only 15 times per week. This reflected its place in the Industrial Revolution which came very late to Bromyard, partly because it took so long to connect the town to the railway system. A sandstone quarry was opened at Linton, just east of the town, in the 1870s, but the hopes for extensive sales of good quality building stone were disappointed and by 1879 it was producing bricks and tiles from the Old Red Sandstone marls. This business continued until the 1970s.

The town&#x27;s water supply and sanitation was very poor until late in the 19th century; Benjamin Herschel Babbage conducted an inspection in 1850 (as he had the same year for the West Yorkshire town of Haworth). Babbage was horrified by the unsanitary conditions in the town, and reported to the General Board of Health into the town&#x27;s water supply and lack of a sewerage system. He said that he had &quot;met with considerable opposition to the application of the Public Health Act to this town, from a large number of the inhabitants, upon the ground of the supposed expense of carrying out the sanitary reforms which I found to be so much needed.&quot; No action was taken by the town vestry for over twenty years. The town belatedly acquired a piped water supply in 1900.

During World War I, Bromyard was the site of an internment camp, where the Irish nationalist Terence MacSwiney (future Lord Mayor of Cork who would die on hunger strike), was both interned and married.

In World War II, between autumn 1940 and 1945, Westminster School was temporarily relocated to a variety of buildings on the outskirts of the town, principally Buckenhill, and including, for various purposes, Brockhampton, Clater Park, Whitbourne Rectory and Saltmarshe Castle.

From the 1950-60s, the town underwent substantial housing development, including both private and council housing, and shops along the high street flourished serving both Bromyard and surrounding rural communities. A bypass was built and completed in the 1970s to stop traffic along the A44 between Worcester and Leominster having to pass through the town. A community centre, including a public library and leisure centre was opened in the 1990s.

==Governance==
There are two electoral wards, Bromyard West and Bromyard Bringsty. The latter includes several villages to the north east.
Bromyard borough has a town council. Herefordshire Council is a unitary authority.


Bromyard is one of three market towns (Leominster, Bromyard and Ledbury) in the parliamentary constituency of North Herefordshire. The current member as of the general election of 2019 is Conservative Sir Bill Wiggin MP.

Bromyard is served by the Bromyard and Winslow Town Council which has three clerks and a Mayor. It has 18 councillors who are predominately independent

Bromyard and Winslow is a civil parish in Herefordshire. According to the 2001 census it had a population of 4,144, increasing to 4,236 at the 2011 census. The parish contains the town of Bromyard, and Winslow which is a sparsely populated rural area to the west. In 2014 the population was estimated to have risen to 4,600, and increase of about 200 or 4.5%, and 2% higher than the county&#x27;s average. In 2015 a national influenza and pneumonia epidemic meant that the birth and death rate almost reached parity causing a slow down in the town&#x27;s population growth. The town centre is considered among the 25% most deprived in the country for older people, irrespective of its relatively low population density.

Bromyard is a former civil parish. In 1961 the parish of Bromyard had a population of 1680. On 1 April 1986 the parish was abolished and merged with Winslow to form &quot;Bromyard &amp; Winslow&quot;.

== Culture ==

The Bromyard &amp; District Local History Society was founded in 1966, with a centre open three days a week which contains an archive, library and an exhibition room.

The Conquest Theatre (run by volunteers) provides a programme of plays, films, variety, musicals, operettas, ballet, pantomime and concerts in a purpose-built centre constructed in 1991.

The Time Museum of Science Fiction is in the centre of Bromyard, housing exhibits from TV programmes including &quot;Dr Who&quot;, &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; and &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;, as well as props from the &quot;Star Wars&quot; films.

Bromyard Arts is a not-for-profit enterprise with facilities for artists, craft makers, writers, musicians and performers.

At Christmas time, volunteers known as the Bromyard Light Brigade organise a display of Christmas lights which are put up in October and switched on the last Saturday of November, running for the five weeks up to Christmas until after the New Year. The group established links with Blackpool Illuminations in 2010, and Blackpool&#x27;s director Richard Ryan performed the switching-on ceremony in the same year; the volunteers were awarded The Queen&#x27;s Award for Voluntary Service that same year.

Bromyard is the home of &quot;Nozstock: The Hidden Valley Festival&quot;, which attracts around 5,000 visitors at the end of July every year. This three-day event showcases bands from around the country across nine stages, alongside dance arenas, a cinema, a theatre and comedy stage, circus, and a vintage tractor arena.

The Bromyard Gala, an annual weekend festival of country sports, vintage vehicles and displays of various kinds, is held in July.

Bromyard holds a three-day folk festival each year in September, which particularly concentrates on English traditional music.

==Transport==

The Worcester, Bromyard and Leominster Railway, now dismantled, was first proposed in 1845, and an Act of Parliament to build it obtained in 1861. Estimated to cost £20,000, that number of £10 shares were issued. When sold to the Great Western Railway in 1887, the shares were only worth ten shillings. The line had only arrived from Worcester in 1877, but it was already 3.5 miles to the east at Yearsett. It was not until 1897 that an onward connection was made to Leominster. It was a common destination for &#x27;hop-pickers&#x27; specials&#x27; from the Black Country. There were five trains a day in each direction. The line to Leominster was closed in 1952, the last train ran in 1958, and the line, closed due to financial instability, became a victim of the Beeching cuts in 1963–4. For a short time the section between Bromyard and Linton was run as a private light railway – the Bromyard and Linton Light Railway – which still exists, albeit now disused.

Bromyard is the starting place of the A465 road which terminates at junction 43 of the M4 motorway at Llandarcy in South Wales. The town centre is bypassed by the A44 road that connects Aberystwyth to Oxford. Bromyard is notable for its many old and historically interesting buildings that are designated blue plaque buildings, especially in High Street, Broad Street, Market Square, Sherford Street and Rowberry Street, including a number of half-timbered public-houses and dwelling houses.

== Architecture ==

=== St Peter&#x27;s, Bromyard ===


St Peter&#x27;s Church is a large cruciform building described in 1574 &quot;with many cathedral churches no fairer&quot; with parts dating back to Norman times, including an effigy of St. Peter, with two keys, over the main (reset) Norman south doorway. Most of the exterior is early 14th century. An Anglo-Saxon minster church existed before the present St Peter&#x27;s Church. No physical remains survive, but the minster and manor are mentioned in a document of 840 AD. Inside the largely 14th century church lies a Norman font. The common element to the design was Y-shaped tracery throughout, chamfered roof beams of timber. The Norman nave was marked by capitals in the Decorated Style with lozenges, rosette and chevron. There was a genuine Tympanum in the north transept. The chancel was restored in the 14th century with ubiquitous window tracery. The oldest part of the church, the south arcade may have been built in the reign of Richard the Lion Heart, when Norman knights began to build churches in the county. The columnaded north arcade was built under King John characterised by leaf crockets, quatrefoils, and double-chamfered beams.

Bromyard church was early favoured by generous benefactors, as the Hereford &quot;Red Book of the Exchequer&quot; testified in 1277. The Lancastrian knights Sir John Baskerville and Sir Hugh Watcham donated two chantry chapels; with an unusual &quot;lavacrum&quot; in the south transept. At about the same time a Ricardian founded a chantry school for the parish, which was saved at the reformation on appeal in 1547 after 150 years of existence. Of the 17 grammar schools in the county only four survived the suppression of the monasteries, reflecting directly future development of the towns. Bromyard borough was the second town in Herefordshire owing to the woollen trade, but was taxed and chantries confiscated by the Crown under Queen Elizabeth I.

After the English Civil Wars the church fell into near fatal dilapidation for about a century. Much of the church was substantially restored by the Victorian architect Nicholson and Sons to the transepts in 1887, and the stalls beneath the tower, revealing the roof clerestory. A war memorial was added in 1919. Thus was followed by extensive repairs to the stained glass in the 1930s by A J Davies and later by A K Nicholson. Inside the church monumental slabs litter the chancel walls with worthies of Bromyard: John Baynham (1636), Thomas Fox (1728), Laetitia Pauncefoot (1753), Roger Sale (1766), Joseph Sterling (1781), Bartholomew Barneby (1783), James Dansie (1784), Roger Sale (1786), Abigail Barneby (1805), Edward Moxam (1805). At the Millennium the churchyard was cleared of monumental inscriptions.
===Winslow===

====The Green Estate====
The civil parish of Winslow was a total in the original township devolved from the Saxon &quot;parochia&quot;. To the west stands two outstanding Georgian properties. &quot;The Green Estate&quot; is a large farm on which a big house was built in 1770 for Thomas Colley who, by 1771, had taken ownership of the new three-storey house with its brick facade which was two miles west of Winslow Township. The Georgian mansion was built on land - - of which nearly half was meadow. It consisted of 5 bays with a pedimnented centre and doorways of tripartite Doric columns. Typical of the Decorated Style, the blank sections on the wall offset the elaborations. Colley also installed Venetian windows and a baluster staircase. Fronted ornate pedimented doric columns are at the building&#x27;s entrance and Venetian windows hint at the Georgian Grand Tour and the ornate style architecture typical of the county. It also contains a remarkable baluster staircase. According to Nicholas Pevsner, in horse country it was usual to have outbuildings and stables made of stone.

The Green Estate was owned in 1911 by William George Lupton who reportedly &quot;took a keen interest in local politics&quot; as did his first cousin, Mr. J.E. Schunck (1869-1940), the 1910 and 1912 Liberal candidate for Taunton and son of Kate Lupton, Baroness von Schunck (1833-1913). There was a blacksmith&#x27;s smithy nearby to the estate on of woodland.

A farm of 110 acres existed at Hardwick Manor. This was named for Anthony Hardwick in 1575 when he purchased the freehold. His descendant, John, fell into debt and in 1755 was forced to sell Hardwick Hall, which was demolished, and the rest of the estate was sold to Thomas Griffiths of Stoke Lacy. The manor house was rebuilt on the site.

Medieval Munderfield was settled by a lesser Norman gentry family named D&#x27;Abitot. Mundersfield Harold is an even earlier Augustan era mansion made of brick on an H-Plan with typical bays and hipped roofs. There is a Venetian staircase, plaster mouldings, and a glazed porch. In the Victorian period a south wing with a terracotta balustrade was added. The estate had extensive farm buildings to the north-west, these were laid out, which was then followed by a large landscaped park. The house acquired a lodge in the 1880s facing a main road. There were three well-appointed farmhouses in the Norton area by 2000. The Lower Norton property of Hill Farm was built in the late 18th century with a barn of timber-framing alongside.

In the 21st century Winslow parish was once again merged into Bromyard Town borough due to urban developments.

=== Bredenbury ===
Although Wacton Court no longer exists, Wacton Farm was part of the same estate. It was purchased by Richard Hardwick in 1720, and two houses in Bromyard, which were let. A hall was founded at Lower Hardwick in the Tudor period with bays, studding, and diagonal cross-bracing. A new wing was added on the north-western side in the Jacobean era. Gabled windows are distinguished by the lozenges with elaborate carved mouldings on diagonal wooden dragon-beams in the roof with supporting columns. There was a hop farm at Wicton with three large square kilns.

The main building was a stone house, Bredenbury Court built for William West in 1809 and then remodelled for the Barnebys by A.T.Wyatt in 1873–4. The red-rock faced Italianate Neo-Elizabethan mansion had a number of bays before additions in 1898 by a new owner Francis Greswolde-Williams. The architect Guy Dawber was instrumental in much of the current improvements: a west end extension, rusticated corner pilasters, and open pediments. The east wing dated after the 18th century architect James Gibbs with fine plaster work and a Wyatt staircase with twisted balusters. St Richards Prep School added a north-west brick classroom in 1924. The lodges belonged to Wyatt in picturesque gabled Gothic; but the stables were Dawber&#x27;s work in 1902. William Harington Barneby laid out the grounds with formal gardens and shrubberies to a design by Edward Milner of Sydenham, Kent.

The medieval parish church was rebuilt by the High Victorian W.H. Knight in 1861–2, only to be demolished a decade later. A new church on a new site was built to T H Wyatt&#x27;s design in 1876–7 to replace Wacton Church and Old Bredenbury. The font was imported from Wacton, as was some of the stained glass windows. Ashlar dressings and fish-scale tiles were decorated in the 14th century new-medieval style. The beautiful interior was sumptuously appointed with marble alabaster tombs, fittings and reredos. A chancel was added in 1880 and a pulpit two years later. Ornate carving from R.L. Boulton was matched by Lavers stained glass which took ten years (1877–87) to complete.

=== Rowden ===
The 465 acres of land area in Rowden (meaning a rough hill) was occupied by Sir John la Moigne in 1300 when he built the first chapel there. The house was named after the ancient Rowdon family of Burley Gate, who occupied it during the English Civil Wars. Edward Rowden built a new house in 1651 on the ruins of the medieval buildings; its dovecote was a local landmark of &quot;circular stone&quot;. It was unoccupied by 1721.

Rowden House was formerly known as Rowden Barn in the 1830s. It was a large stone building erected by judicious marriage into the family of Warren Hastings, the Governor-General of India. Rowden House was rebuilt in 1883, for a son of Lord St John cut out of stone after the Queen Anne-style, with a hipped roof and noteworthy pedimented dormer window. The brick chimneys, medallion cornices, and keystoned arches are from an earlier era. Like other Grade 1 listed buildings in the district it is busied by ornate carving, lozenges, and carved roof-beams. The estate was owned by the industrialist John Arkwright who was responsible for the addition of unusually decorated farm cottages built in 1867. Rev W N Berkeley the local rector resided there in 1891, but it was sold to Rear-Admiral J Alleyne Baker in 1909. The owners sported a fine ballroom popular with local people.

The original medieval moated abbey beside the River Frome was demolished in about 1790. The present Rowden Abbey was rebuilt in 1881 as a half-timbered mansion for landowner Henry J Bailey. Similar to the above houses in style and decoration, it also exhibited fine gabled porch entrances. The interior had panelling and ribbed ceilings, with delightful bay windows in the reception rooms.

Rowden Mill was a late Elizabethan/early Jacobean converted stone and timber house along the banks of the River Frome. The mill was a three-storey working building with a timber-framed dwelling house attached. On one side of it stood the mill and on the other a bakery and house, which continued as a Master Bakery until 1945. It was for centuries a working corn mill grinding the grain on the Rowden estates. However, by the 20th century it faced economic decline; yet E Powell Tuck still made it a commercial operation during World War Two.

The Tack was probably a successful medieval sheep farm since the name is derived from the Anglo-Saxon &quot;tacca&quot;. A farmhouse stood on the Tenbury Road; built of stone in 1838 it contained a large hop kiln and granary in a complex of buildings, now part of the dwelling. Among its quirky features included two bays in a stable block once used as servants quarters that were built circa 1800.

=== Norton ===
The medieval manor of Norton in the Broxash Hundred, today in the adjacent parish of Norton at the north-east, was constrained by extensive parkland and hunting-grounds amounting a total of 3,183 acres.

Peter de Newebond took occupation of Newbarns in about 1285 on half virgate of land at the same time that the Welsh Wars began. By the 16th century a fish pool had been established to provide food. During 1720s William Tarbox sold the properties to Packington Tomkins, who let it to tenant farmers. By 1850 it was a large three-storey house, a two bay wing, contained a household of 20 family and servants. The house had been brick rebuilt in 1800 incorporating some timber-framing. Both Tomkins and Higginson extended the house in the Victorian era before it changed hands again to a farmer in 1922.

The apple tree enclosure was the cultivated nature of &quot;Mapleton Barn&quot; when first settled in the late 13th century. A yeoman farmer took on the orchards, livestock in Jacobean period, but was merged by tenant farmer John Smith with Newbarns in 1777.

Three large blocks comprised &quot;The Rhea&quot; in 1838, the forerunner of a much larger complex in the late 20th century. In 1851 Thomas Gardiner farmed the land of 220 acres with 7 labourers. A brick house was built in 1900, with several 19th century workers stone cottages. A timber-framed stone barn was erected in the 18th century for a cow byre and stone stables.

On &#x27;beech hill&#x27; in Elizabethan times Buckenhill Manor was recorded as two virgates. But during the early modern period a succession of different owners added farms and acreage to the estate. A Jacobean farmhouse was remodelled: the fine Georgian mansion at Buckenhill was inherited by Mrs Elizabeth Barneby, which unusually she passed to her daughter, Mrs Phillips. The house itself possessed 15 fireplaces, for the duration that royalist Barnebys owned it, but was later altered by an influential Bromyard propertied man Packington Tomkins. Made of mellow brick and constructed in 1730, a 9 bay wing was added to face south; a string course on the first floor. The matching brick style encasing the older house of plasterwork and panelling meant the new and principal wing of the house would have pedimented gables, attics and cellars. The Victorian clock tower to the rear was erected in 1840 by Edmund Higginson. The landscape park was dug with a lake in place, damming the River Frome to create a garden oasis. Towards the Tenbury Road three attractive lodges were built in the late 19th century.

Corinthian capitals atop decorated columns were in the same school as Inkberrow and Bromsberrow Place in the neighbouring county. The older east and front wings were made of stone; bent or chamfered roof beams vacated space in loft for living. Amongst the extensive stabling and outbuildings were hop kilns, a brewhouse, bakehouse and cider house, and octagonal dove cote. But the house was dilapidated by 1939 when occupied by the evacuated Westminster School.

&quot;Buckenhill Grange&quot; was a L-shaped 1750 farmhouse built in the Dutch style with gables out of coarse-hewn stone. On the west gable of this home farm was added a modelled barn with strong diagonal bracings. It had a granary below which was a cobble-stone farm yard for free-range hens. The Buckenhill Mill was acquired by purchase by Thomas Tomkins, son of Packington in 1728.

=== Brockhampton-by-Bromyard ===

Richard, son of Robert de Brockhampton was the first holder of the advowson of the chapelry in 1283. The main effect of the Black Death and end of serfdom was for the church to abandon the bishop&#x27;s palace in the town, reaffirming the independency of the town&#x27;s trading burgesses. At the height of the town&#x27;s influence, Dr Richard Pede DCL was a portionist at Bromyard. Becoming embroiled in national politics he joined the Yorkist rising at Hereford, being later appointed Vicar-general to the royal council at Ludlow Castle.

Ownership passed thence to Thomas Solers, to Sir Thomas le Moigne, to the Rowdons of Burley Gate, the Habingtons, and by the Mid-Tudor era the Barnebys of Acton, County Wigorn (now modern Birmingham). The Barnebys remained one of the most influential families for the next 400 years in the district&#x27;s development as a wool market, and significant centre of the wool trade for the Midlands. Richard Habington had acquired the lease of the manor of Bromyard in 1444. Thomas Barneby was slain at Towton in 1461, and the family, firm Royalists were compounded by parliament after the Civil wars. One of the Barnebys, Edmund changed his name to Higginson to acquire Saltmarshe Castle, long associated with the Coningsbys of Hampton Court. The two families were closely inter-related by marriage. In 1872 the castle came down to Barneby-Lutley, another branch of the same medieval family.

Lower Brockhampton, a moated farmhouse on an extensive National Trust property, lies a short distance to the east, beyond Bromyard Downs. This is an area of common land lying to the northeast which offers many walks, with extensive views over the town, the Malvern Hills, the Clee Hills, and the Welsh borders, with the Black Mountains and other hills beyond. An attempt by local landowners in 1866 to enclose the Downs was strongly opposed by townsfolk and failed, not least because it was an area of recreation including rifle butts and an annual race meeting.

<text>The Trotskyist Fraction – Fourth International (TF-FI) is a political international of Trotskyist political organizations that claim to adhere to the political legacy of the Fourth International. 

==History==
It has its origin in the expelled Internationalist Bolshevik Faction of the Movement for Socialism (MAS). MAS was the Argentine section of the International Workers League (IWL-FI). The Internationalist Bolshevik Faction regarded itself initially as an &quot;external fraction&quot; of the MAS/IWL-FI who had been wrongly expelled, and demanded the overturning of its expulsion.

The Internationalist Bolshevik Faction became the Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PTS) in 1988. In 1989 the &quot;Partido Obrero Socialista (POS)&quot; in Mexico, later renamed &quot;Liga de Trabajadores Socialistas (LTS)&quot;, was also expelled from the IWL-FI. The PTS and the POS founded the &quot;Internationalist Faction of the IWL-FI (IFIWL-FI)&quot; in 1989. 

From 1988 to 1990 the PTS had three splits: first when a number of militants returned to the Argentinian Movement for Socialism (MAS) party, then when another group of militants sympathized with the British Workers Revolutionary Party (Worker Press) and the third when supporters of León Pérez (former member of the International Secretariat of the IWL-FI) decided to follow a mass party perspective (as opposed to a vanguard party).

These splits forced the PTS to make a balance and self-criticism. This resulted in a further development. The PTS and the IFIWL-FI questioned the &quot;update&quot; of the Transitional Program that Nahuel Moreno, the leader of the IWL-FI, had made (his so-called theory of &quot;Democratic Revolution&quot;). The PTS and the IFIWL-FI regarded Moreno&#x27;s update as an &quot;anti-Trotskyist revision&quot; of Leon Trotsky&#x27;s Theory of Permanent Revolution. The PTS and the IFIWL-FI broke with Moreno&#x27;s political tradition/heritage, ideology (termed Morenoism) and tendency (the IWL-FI). The IFIWL-FI was renamed &quot;Internationalist Faction&quot;.

In 1996 the &quot;Trotskyist Fraction - International Strategy&quot; was founded. By 2004 it consisted of the PTS of Argentina, the LTS of Mexico (current name &quot;MTS&quot;), the LOR-CI of Bolivia, the Estratégia Revolucionaria, current name &quot;Movimento Revolucionário de Trabalhadores (MRT)&quot;, of Brazil and the Clase contra Clase, current name &quot;Partido de Trabajadores Revolucionarios (PTR)&quot;, of Chile as well as some militant sympathizers in Europe. In 2004, in its second international conference, the &quot;Trotskyist Fraction - International Strategy&quot; decided to change its name to &quot;Trotskyist Fraction - Fourth International&quot; (TF-FI). Following the economic crisis and demonstrations in several countries, the TF-FI grew in Latin America and Europe, and its manifesto of 2013 called for the formation of a new grouping: An International Movement for a Socialist Revolution - Fourth International. The manifesto was updated in 2021, due to new developments in the international arena.

==National sections==
The largest full section of the TF-FI is the PTS in Argentina. After the 2023 Argentine general election the PTS has four national deputies in the National Congress of Argentina: Nicolás del Caño, Christian Castillo, Myriam Bregman, and Alejandro Vilca.

The Organización Socialista Revolucionaria (Costa Rica), the Frazione Internazionalista Rivoluzionaria (Italy), and the Corriente Socialista de las y los Trabajadores (Peru) became full sections of the TF-FI after endorsing the TF-FI manifesto of 2013.

In 2022 the Révolution Permanente in France became a full section of the TF-FI. Le Journal du Dimanche noted the rising domination of the Révolution Permanente and its youth group, the Le Poing Levé, during the strikes against the French pension reform of 2023. Le Monde remarked that the Révolution Permanente&#x27;s &quot;media visibility&quot; was &quot;disproportionate&quot; to its size during the 2023 protests. According to Arrêt sur images the website of the Révolution Permanente has become indispensable to striking workers. According to La Croix, Adèle Haenel, Assa Traoré and Frédéric Lordon are supporters of the organization. 

Former sections:

* Groupe Communiste Revolutionaire Internationaliste (Revolutionary Internationalist Communist Group) (CRI) - They were admitted in 2008 as sympathiser section of TF-FI, but after the creation of the New Anticapitalist Party (NPA) they decided to dissolve within the CLAIRE Tendency of the NPA (acronym for &quot;Tendency for Communism and self-organized, internationalist and revolutionary struggle&quot;). Later, in 2010, the TF-FI militants and the CLAIRE-tendency created &quot;The Collective for a Revolutionary Tendency&quot; inside NPA, which was dissolved after NPA&#x27;s first congress (February 10 - February 13 2011). In April 2011 the &quot;Revolutionary Communist Current&quot; (CCR) was officially founded by the TF-FI militants, after leaving the CLAIRE-tendency in February 13 2011. The CCR was expelled from the NPA in June 2021. In December 2022 the CCR became the Révolution Permanente, the current section of the TF-FI.
* Socialist Revolution League (Liga de la Revolución Socialista) (LRS) - Admitted in 2008 as full section, but they dissolved in 2014.

<doc id="385762" wikidata="Q78885" url="?curid=385762" title="Ettore Sottsass">
<text>Ettore Sottsass (14 September 1917 – 31 December 2007) was an Italian architect, product designer and a former militant of the Italian Republican Fascist Party. He was known for his designs of furniture, jewelry, glass, lighting, homeware and office supplies. He also worked on numerous buildings and interiors, often defined by bold colours.

== Early life ==
Sottsass was born in Innsbruck, Austria, and grew up in Turin, where his father, also named Ettore Sottsass, was an architect. His father belonged to the modernist architecture group Movimento Italiano per l&#x27;Architettura Razionale (MIAR), which was led by Giuseppe Pagano.

Sottsass attended Politecnico di Torino in Turin and graduated in 1939 with a degree in architecture.

After the invasion of Italy by the Anglo-Americans, Sottsass enlisted in the Monterosa Division of the Repubblica Sociale Italiana which was led by Benito Mussolini and the Republican Fascist Party, to fight in the mountains alongside Hitler&#x27;s army (Sottsass tells his adventures as a Lieutenant of the Monterosa Division in his autobiography &quot;Scritto di Notte&quot; published by Adelphi).

After his time in the military, Sottsass opened his own architecture and design firm in Milan, Italy. Here he started designing furniture and experimented with different color, patterns and shapes. His work was often associated with pop culture with his brightly colored whimsical objects. His pieces were often made out of glass and ceramic.

== Early career ==
After returning home, Ettore Sottsass worked as an architect with his father, often on new modernist versions of buildings that were destroyed during the war. In 1947, living in Milan, he set up his own architectural and industrial design studio, where he began to create work in a variety of different media: ceramic, painting, sculpture, furniture, photography, jewelry, architecture and interior design.
In 1949, Sottsass was married to Fernanda Pivano, a writer, journalist, translator and critic. From 1954 to 1957 he was a member of the International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus, resigning due to the movement&#x27;s perceived aggression and its lack of professionalism.

In 1956, Sottsass traveled to New York City and began working in the office of George Nelson. He and Pivano traveled widely while working for Nelson, and returned to Italy after a few months. During the same year, Sottsass was commissioned by the American entrepreneur Irving Richards on an exhibition of his ceramics.

Back in Italy in 1957, Sottsass joined , a semi-industrial producer of contemporary furniture, as an artistic consultant. Much of the furniture he worked on there influenced the design he would create later with Memphis Milano.

In 1956, Sottsass was hired by Adriano Olivetti as a design consultant for Olivetti, to design electronic devices and develop the first Italian mainframe computer, the Elea 9003 for which he was awarded the Compasso d&#x27;Oro in 1959. His design for the MC 19 electric adding machine (with ) was awarded the Compasso d&#x27;Oro in 1970. At Olivetti, he also designed office equipment, typewriters, and furniture. There Sottsass made his name as a designer who, through colour, form and styling, managed to bring office equipment into the realm of popular culture. His first typewriters, the &quot;Tekne 3&quot; and the &quot;Praxis 48&quot;, were characterized by their sobriety and their angularity. With Perry A. King, Sottsass created the Valentine typewriter in 1969 — considered today a milestone in 20th century design and featured in the Museum of Modern Art, Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum, London&#x27;s Design Museum as well as the Victoria and Albert Museum. 

While continuing to design for Olivetti in the 1960s, Sottsass developed a range of objects which were expressions of his personal experiences traveling in the United States and India. These objects included large altar-like ceramic sculptures and his &quot;Superboxes&quot;, radical sculptural gestures presented within a context of consumer product, as conceptual statements. Covered in bold and colorful, simulated custom laminates, they were precursors to Memphis, a movement which came more than a decade later. Around this time, Sottsass said: &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to do any more consumerist products, because it was clear that the consumerist attitude was quite dangerous.&quot; As a result, his work from the late 1960s to the 1970s was defined by experimental collaborations with younger designers such as Superstudio and Archizoom Associati, and association with the Radical movement, culminating in the foundation of Memphis at the turn of the decade.

In the early 1970s he designed the modular office equipment collection &quot;Synthesis 45&quot;.

Sottsass and Fernanda Pivano divorced in 1970, and in 1976 Sottsass married Barbara Radice, an art critic and journalist.

When Roberto Olivetti succeeded as head of the company, he named Sottsass artistic director and gave him a high salary, but Sottsass refused. Instead he created the Studio Olivetti independent of Olivetti and became instantly the most creative international centre of design associating research with creation and industrial strategy. His concern that his creativity would have been stifled by corporate work is documented in his 1973 essay &quot;When I was a Very Small Boy&quot;.

In 1968, the Royal College of Art in London granted Sottsass an honorary doctorate.

== Memphis Group ==

With the rise of new groups (Global tools, Archizoom, Superstudio, UFO, Zzigurat, 9999) the handmade style appeared suddenly as the new game for experimentation, a lot of these new groups playing in this new/old path to renew creation. In October 1980, Sottsass was confronted with two proposals, one from Renzo Brugola, a dear old friend and carpenter, telling him his will &quot;to make something together like in the good old times,&quot; and the other one from Mario and Brunella Godani, owners of the Design Gallery Milano, who asked him to create &quot;new furniture&quot; for their gallery.

Ettore Sottsass founded the Memphis Group in Milan on 11 December 1980, after the Bob Dylan song &quot;Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again&quot; played during the group&#x27;s inaugural meeting. The group was active from 1981 to 1988. The Memphis group was created in a reaction against the status quo. Sottsass centered the group&#x27;s thinking around &quot;radical, funny, and outrageous&quot;—essentially, disregarding what was considered in &quot;good taste&quot; at that time. Art deco, the color palette of Pop Art and Kitsch theme from the 1950s inspired their work. Colorful laminate and terrazzo were commonly found in their work and incorporated in floors, tables and lamps.

Sottsass also designed his own print. This was a squiggles print also known as Bacterio print. For the print, Sottsass used inspiration from the surface texture and form of a Buddhist temple in Madurai, India, he then abstracted this detail into the squiggles he named Bacterio. This pattern was then used on their furniture designs in as veneers and textiles.

The Memphis Group was a postmodern, collaborative, architecture and design group founded by Sottsass in Milan Italy. The group focused heavily on furniture design with an emphasis on unconventional types. The designers became well known for their bright and bold pieces with clashing colors. At the time, furniture was solely meant to be functional. However, the Memphis Group sought to prove otherwise with their highly decorative pieces. They poked fun at everyday pieces and turned them into works of art. Many criticized and said it was just a trend that wouldn&#x27;t last. Their unconventional ideas were controversial but have now become widely recognized and appreciated. The work continues to be influential throughout the world and can be seen in the Art Institute of Chicago, the Design Museum in London, The Museum of Modern Art in New York and many others.

==Sottsass Associati==

As the Memphis movement in the 1980s attracted attention worldwide for its energy and flamboyance, Ettore Sottsass began assembling a major design consultancy, which he named Sottsass Associati. Sottsass Associati was established in 1980 and gave the possibility to build architecture on a substantial scale as well as to design for large international industries. Besides Ettore Sottsass, the other founding members were Aldo Cibic, Marco Marabelli, Matteo Thun and Marco Zanini. Later, Johanna Grawunder, Marco Susani, James Irvine, and Mike Ryan would also join the firm. In 1985, Sottsass left the Memphis Group to focus on the Associati.

Sottsass Associati, primarily an architectural practice, also designed elaborate stores and showrooms for Esprit, identities for Alessi, exhibitions, interiors, consumer electronics in Japan, and furniture of all kinds. The studio was based on the cultural guidance of Ettore Sottsass and the work conducted by its many young associates, who quite often left to open their own studios. Sottsass Associati is now based in London and Milan and continue to sustain the work, philosophy, and culture of the studio.

The studio works with former members of Memphis as well as with the architect Johanna Grawunder. It works for major companies like Apple, Philips, Siemens, Zanotta, Fiat, Alessi, and also realises the interior design of all the retail shops of Esprit (Esprit Holdings).

As an architect, he designed the Mayer-Schwarz Gallery on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, California, with its dramatic doorway made of irregular folds and jagged angles, and the home of David M. Kelley, designer of Apple&#x27;s first computer mouse, in Woodside, California. The interiors of the Malpensa Airport, in Milan, were designed by Sottsass in the late 1990s, but he did not architect the building. In the mid-1990s, he designed the sculpture garden and entry gates of the W. Keith and Janet Kellogg Gallery at the campus of Cal Poly Pomona. He collaborated with well-known figures in the architecture and design field, including Aldo Cibic, James Irvine, Matteo Thun.

Sottsass created a vast body of work: furniture, jewelry, ceramics, glass, silver work, lighting, office machine design and buildings. He inspired generations of architects and designers. In 2006 the Los Angeles County Museum of Art held the first major museum survey exhibition of his work in the United States. A retrospective exhibition, &quot;Ettore Sottsass: Work in Progress&quot;, was held at the Design Museum in London in 2007.

<text>Heinrich Emil Albert Knoevenagel (; 18 June 1865 – 11 August 1921) was the German chemist who established the Knoevenagel condensation reaction. The Knoevenagel condensation reaction of benzaldehydes with nitroalkanes is a classic general method for the preparation of nitroalkenes, which are very valuable synthetic intermediates.

<text>Abdurahman Ahmed Said Khadr (, ; born 1982) is a Canadian citizen who was held as an enemy combatant in extrajudicial detention in the United States Guantanamo Bay detainment camps, in Cuba, after being detained in 2002 in Afghanistan under suspicion of connections to Al-Qaeda. He later claimed to have been an informant for the CIA. The agency declined to comment on this when asked for confirmation by the United States&#x27; PBS news program &quot;Frontline.&quot; He was released in the fall of 2003 and ultimately returned to Canada.

He is the third child and second son of Ahmed Khadr, an Egyptian immigrant who was known for ties to al-Qaeda, and his wife Maha el-Samnah, who is Palestinian. His younger brother Omar Khadr was captured by United States forces separately at the age of 15 in Afghanistan in 2002 during a firefight; he was held in Guantanamo for several years but transferred in September 2012 to Canadian custody.

== Early life and education ==

Abdurahman Khadr was born in Manama, Bahrain in 1982, the son of Ahmed Khadr and Maha el-Samnah. Egyptian and Palestinian immigrants to Canada who had become naturalized citizens there, and met and married. His father went to graduate school in Ottawa, and then started working in Bahrain. Ahmed Khadr visited Pakistan after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in the early 1980s, and brought his family to Pakistan in 1985. There he worked for charities assisting Afghan refugees.

In his youth, Abdurahman Khadr was known as the &quot;problem child&quot; in the family, frequently running away and getting in trouble, refusing to follow rules, drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes. He had an older sister and brother, three younger brothers and a younger sister.

In 1994, at the age of 12, Khadr was sent to Khalden training camp along with his older brother Abdullah, where he was given the alias &quot;Osama&quot;. The two brothers fought constantly at the camp, and one day their argument became so heated that they pointed guns at each other, screaming with fury. A trainer stepped between them. In 1997, a dispute between the brothers was mediated by the older Abu Laith al-Libi, who earned their confidence and respect telling them about the city of Dubai and imported Ferraris; he was later described as &quot;really cool&quot; by Abdurahman.

While the family was briefly living in Nazim Jihad with Osama bin Laden&#x27;s family in 1998, Abdurahman became close friends with Abdulrahman bin Laden, who was near his age and the only child in the group to have his own horse, a fine Arabian. Abdurahman successfully persuaded his father to buy him a horse, too. Once, when the two horses fought, the young bin Laden pointed a gun at Khadr, yelling at him to stop the fight before his prized Arabian was killed.

When the family was leaving the compound, Abdurahman and his brother Abdullah fought over seating in the car. Their mother ended up asking bin Laden if he could take care of the troublesome Abdurahman since &quot;she could not control him. He grudgingly agreed to look after the youth until his father returned. But, the next day bin Laden told Abdurahman that it would not work, and he asked Saif al-Adel to take the 16-year-old to the bus station so he could catch up with his family en route back to Peshawar.&quot;

The following year, at age 13, Abdurahman was sent to &quot;Jihad Wel al-Farouq&quot; for seven days; US officials have said the training camp was run by al-Qaeda personnel to train their militants. On August 20, 1998, the Al Farouq training camp was bombed by American cruise missiles and Amr Hamed, a friend of Khadr&#x27;s, was killed. Khadr later said that as a youth, he had hated the Americans for killing his friend.

==Arrest and release==
In November 2001, at the age of 19, Khadr was captured by the Northern Alliance in Kabul, where he was wandering around. An elderly man later claimed that Khadr had installed an anti-aircraft gun on the roof of a house. He was transferred to United States authorities on suspicion of having killed an American medic, but was released. He later claimed to have been captured several other times, and released each time.

At this point, accounts differ. Khadr claims he lived for nine months in a CIA safe house near the American Embassy in Kabul, and worked abroad as an informant. But other sources say he was taken to Guantanamo Bay on March 21, 2003 and held as an enemy combatant.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; later reported that the CIA offered Khadr a contract in March 2003 and asked him to work as an infiltrator for American intelligence in Guantanamo, to be paid $5,000 and a monthly stipend of $3000. While in Cuba, Khadr worked to obtain information from his fellow inmates before spending five additional months at the Camp X-Ray prison, where he claims to have been given training as an undercover CIA operative.

The Department of Defense published height and weight records for all but ten of the captives held in Guantanamo. 

The United States later said that Khadr had been removed from the camp in July 2003. However, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that an October 9, 2003, memo summarized a meeting between General Geoffrey Miller and his staff and Vincent Cassard of the ICRC; it acknowledged that camp authorities were not permitting the ICRC to have access to Khadr and three other detainees, due to &quot;military necessity&quot;.

Khadr says he was later given a bogus passport and boarded a Gulfstream jet assigned to CIA Director George Tenet. He said that after a stop-over in Portugal, he landed in Bosnia where he was asked to conduct a spy operation at mosques in Sarajevo. Khadr states that he tried to approach Canadian embassies in various nations and was rebuffed at all of them. He phoned his grandmother Fatmah el-Samnah while in Sarajevo and asked her to go to the Canadian media and tell them that he had been stranded and refused entry back into Canada. He was finally granted admission to the Canadian embassy in Bosnia and was flown back to Canada on November 30, 2003.

On December 4, 2003, Khadr held a press conference with his attorney Rocco Galati. He discussed his role in the War on Terror, but omitted later claimed cooperation with the CIA. The following month, he denied reports by the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; that he had been released in exchange for giving the Americans information on the location of his father, who was killed by Pakistani soldiers in Waziristan two weeks before Abdurahman&#x27;s release.

==Interviews==
In March 2004, Khadr gave a series of three interviews to PBS, which became the basis of a documentary entitled &quot;Son of al Qaeda.&quot; (He had largely passed a polygraph test.) He claimed to have grown up in &quot;an al-Qaeda family&quot;, and said that he resented his father&#x27;s associating with militants.

Khadr has offered a number of conflicting accounts of his life. For example, he has claimed that he was as young as 9 when he began attending Afghan training camps, and that he remained in them until as late as 2003, years after he had not only been kicked out of the camps, but was detained by the United States. He has repeatedly made comments suggesting that everything up until his most recent story was a lie.

== Passport issue ==
In July 2004, Khadr was denied a Canadian passport by Governor General Adrienne Clarkson, on the explicit advice of Foreign Affairs Minister Bill Graham, by invoking the &quot;royal prerogative&quot;. Graham claimed the decision was &quot;in the interest of the national security of Canada and the protection of Canadian troops in Afghanistan.&quot; National security was not listed as a ground of refusal in the &quot;Canadian Passport Order&quot; at the time. It was, however, added as a ground shortly thereafter, on September 22, 2004. Under the terms of the amendment, the Minister was empowered to revoke or refuse to renew or issue a passport on national security grounds.

Khadr sought judicial review of the Minister&#x27;s decision. On June 8, 2006, the Federal Court ruled that the Minister did not have the power to deny Khadr&#x27;s passport in the absence of specific authority set out in the Canadian Passport Order, but stated in &quot;obiter dicta&quot; that if the Order were to be amended (as it had been after the fact), Khadr would likely not be able to challenge the revocation. On August 30, 2006, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, then Peter MacKay, with the support of Prime Minister Stephen Harper, again denied Khadr&#x27;s application, this time on the basis of the now-amended &quot;Canadian Passport Order&quot;.

==Various claims==
* Although Mahmoud Jaballah has said that he never met Ahmed Khadr while in Peshawar, Abdurahman Khadr has said that he had seen Jaballah around the city.
* When the CIA asked Khadr for the names of Canadians who had attended Khalden, he listed Amer el-Maati, Ahmad el-Maati, Amr Hamed and another Canadian he knew only as &quot;Idriss,&quot; who was arrested for conspiring to attack an embassy in Azerbaijan. He later claimed that Amer el-Maati had given his Canadian passport to Idriss.
* He has said that his family ran a guesthouse for Canadians wanting to train with al-Qaeda.

== Movie deal ==
On January 9, 2005, &quot;Variety&quot; reported plans to make a movie based on Khadr&#x27;s life.

<doc id="385771" wikidata="Q1996713" url="?curid=385771" title="1992 Irish general election">
<text>The 1992 Irish general election to the 27th Dáil was held on Wednesday, 25 November, almost three weeks after the dissolution of the 26th Dáil on 5 November by President Mary Robinson, on the request of Taoiseach Albert Reynolds following a defeat of the government in a motion of confidence. The general election took place in 41 Dáil constituencies throughout Ireland for 166 seats in Dáil Éireann, the house of representatives of the Oireachtas, under a revision in the Electoral (Amendment) Act 1990. Three referendums on abortion were held on the same date.

The 27th Dáil met at Leinster House on 14 December 1992 to nominate the Taoiseach for appointment by the president and to approve the appointment of a new government of Ireland. No government was formed on that date, but on 12 January 1993, Reynolds was re-appointed Taoiseach, forming the 23rd government of Ireland, a coalition government of Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party.

==Campaign==
The general election of 1992 was precipitated by the collapse of the Fianna Fáil–Progressive Democrats coalition government. Allegations of dishonesty at the Beef Tribunal forced Desmond O&#x27;Malley and his party to part ways with Albert Reynolds&#x27;s Fianna Fáil. Both Albert Reynolds and John Bruton of Fine Gael were fighting their first general election as leader of their respective parties. For Reynolds it would be his only election as leader. The campaign went very poorly for Fianna Fáil with Reynolds&#x27;s support dropping by 20%.

On the left, the Labour Party had increased their support in the local elections the previous year and many were predicting major gains for the party in the Dáil. The Workers&#x27; Party had split at a special convention that year over a motion to re-constitute the party, similar to the move made the same year by the Italian Communist Party, and sever all links with the Official IRA. Six out of their seven TDs and a majority of their councillors left the party when the motion failed to be passed and formed Democratic Left in early 1992.

Many political pundits had predicted that Fianna Fáil would not be re-elected and that a &quot;Rainbow Coalition&quot; involving Fine Gael, the Labour Party and possibly Democratic Left would be formed. John Bruton, the leader of Fine Gael, had problems of his own. Opinion polls showed that if a &quot;Rainbow Coalition&quot; came to power, Dick Spring of the Labour Party was seen as a better potential Taoiseach than Bruton. The possibility of a rotating Taoiseach was also hinted at in the media.

The big winner of the campaign was Dick Spring and the Labour Party. They distanced themselves completely from Fine Gael and fought an independent line. During the campaign Spring made very little comment about what the party would do after the election, however, he did say that if the Labour Party was part of a coalition he would have to be granted a turn as Taoiseach.

The election also saw Moosajee Bhamjee (Labour Party) become the first Muslim Teachta Dála (TD).

==Results==




|}

In 1989 the Democratic Socialist Party won 0.6% of the vote and 1 seat; the party merged with the Labour Party in 1990. Independents include Independent Fianna Fáil (5,248 votes, 1 seat).

===Voting summary===
===Seats summary===
==Government formation==

Fianna Fáil had its worst performance since 1927, winning less than 40% of the vote. Fine Gael, in spite of predictions of success, lost 10 seats. The Labour Party recorded its best ever result, an event dubbed the &quot;Spring Tide&quot; and more than doubled its number of seats. Talks between Fine Gael and Labour on establishing a minority government floundered after several weeks, partly over the issue of the &quot;revolving Taoiseach&quot;. Spring had to enter into coalition with Fianna Fáil, or force another election. The coalition deal proved very unpopular with many of Labour&#x27;s supporters, because Dick Spring had campaigned heavily against Fianna Fáil and particularly Albert Reynolds. As a result of the coalition, Albert Reynolds was elected Taoiseach with over 100 votes, the biggest majority by any Taoiseach until 2011.

Following a number of scandals in 1994, particularly over the beef industry, the Labour Party left the coalition and, after negotiations, formed the Rainbow Coalition with Fine Gael and Democratic Left on 15 December 1994, as three by-election gains had by then made a Fine Gael-Labour-Democratic Left majority government possible. This was the first and to date, the only, time a new government with new coalition parties took office within a Dáil term.

==Dáil membership changes==
The following changes took place as a result of the election: 
*11 outgoing TDs retired
*155 TDs stood for re-election
**126 of those were re-elected
**30 failed to be re-elected
*41 successor TDs were elected
**33 were elected for the first time
**8 had previously been TDs
*There were 10 successor female TDs, increasing the total number by 7 to 20
*There were changes in 29 of the 41 constituencies contested

Outgoing TDs are listed in the constituency they contested in the election. For some, such as John Stafford, this differs from the constituency they represented in the outgoing Dáil. Where more than one change took place in a constituency the concept of successor is an approximation for presentation only.

==Seanad election==
The Dáil election was followed in early 1993 by the election to the 20th Seanad.

<doc id="385773" wikidata="Q6143472" url="?curid=385773" title="Jimmy Key">
<text>James Edward Key (born April 22, 1961) is an American former left-handed starting pitcher in Major League Baseball who played for the Toronto Blue Jays (1984–1992), New York Yankees (1993–1996), and Baltimore Orioles (1997–1998). His best personal years were in 1987, when he posted a 17–8 record with a league-leading 2.76 ERA, and in 1993, when he went 18–6 with a 3.00 ERA and 173 strikeouts. With the Blue Jays, he won the 1992 World Series and with the Yankees, he won the 1996 World Series, both over the Atlanta Braves.

==Career==

===Amateur career===
Key attended S. R. Butler High School in Huntsville, Alabama. For the school&#x27;s baseball team, he compiled a 10–0 win–loss record with nine shutouts and a 0.30 earned run average (ERA) in his senior year. Key also batted .410 with 11 home runs and 35 runs batted in in his high school career.

Key attended Clemson University, where he played college baseball for the Clemson Tigers baseball team in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). At Clemson, Key posted a 9–3 record and 2.79 ERA on the mound, and batted .300 with 21 doubles. Key is the only Clemson player to be a member of the first-team All-ACC in two positions (pitcher and DH) in 1982. He pitched the opening game of the 1980 College World Series.

===Toronto Blue Jays===
The Toronto Blue Jays selected Key in the third round of the 1982 MLB draft. He worked his way up the Blue Jays&#x27; minor league system during 1982 and 1983, putting up respectable numbers with the Florence Blue Jays (South Atlantic League), the Medicine Hat Blue Jays (Pioneer League), the Knoxville Blue Jays (Southern League), and the Syracuse Chiefs (International League) before heading to Toronto.

Key made his Major League debut on April 6, 1984, and was utilized in relief situations through his inaugural year, notching 10 saves and a 4.65 ERA. He wore number 27 in his first season and 22 for the duration of his Blue Jays career.

Key moved into the starting rotation in 1985 and quickly became a cornerstone in the rotation, leading the Blue Jays to their first postseason appearance that year. In 1987, Key led the major leagues with a 2.76 earned run average and finished second behind Roger Clemens in voting for the American League Cy Young Award.

In Game 4 of the 1992 World Series, Key made his final start for the Blue Jays, surrendering one run over innings to earn a 2-1 win and put the Jays up 3 games to 1. He left the game to a tremendous ovation. Key would appear once more in the series, as a reliever in the 10th and 11th innings of the 6th and deciding game, earning another winning decision in the series.

===New York Yankees===
As a free agent, Key signed a four-year contract worth $17 million with the New York Yankees on December 10, 1992. He posted a 49–23 record in 94 games over three seasons with the Yankees. He had his career high of 173 strikeouts in the first year with the Yankees in 1993, and he led the majors with 17 wins in the strike-shortened season of 1994.

He spent time with the Gulf Coast Yankees (1–0 and 0.00 ERA) and Tampa (0–0 and 2.77 ERA) of the Florida State League during rehab assignments during his last season with New York in 1996. In his final start as a Yankee, he outdueled Greg Maddux of the Atlanta Braves in the deciding game of the 1996 World Series.

===Baltimore Orioles===
Key signed as a free agent with the Baltimore Orioles on December 10, 1996, and posted a 22–13 record in 59 appearances over two seasons. A free agent in his final season, Key retired from the game after the 1998 season largely due to injuries. He made US$7.73 million with the Orioles over 2 seasons. He wore the number 21 with the Orioles (22 having been retired by Baltimore in honor of hall-of-famer Jim Palmer).
He was assigned to Fredrick of the Carolina League in 1998 (1–0 3.00 ERA) during his final rehab stint. Key was granted free agency for the last time on October 27, 1998, by Orioles GM Pat Gillick, the same GM who granted him the same conditions in Toronto in 1992.

==Strengths and weaknesses==
Key was one of the premiere control pitchers in the game with a good strikeout-to-walk ratio over most of his career. His fastball was not particularly speedy, but was often effective as he could spot it on both corners of the plate—although when his pitch went high, opponents fared well. He also possessed a fine backdoor slider. He had a very good pickoff move to first base, which he notably demonstrated in Game 4 of the 1992 World Series by picking off Otis Nixon, one of the game&#x27;s premiere base stealers at the time. (During his windup his right knee was bent so that his right foot did not cross the rubber and he could throw to first base without incurring a balk).

Key tended to give up more than his share of home runs even while holding his opponents&#x27; on-base percentage to a low level. He was injury-prone with significant down time in 1988, 1989, 1990, 1995, 1996 and 1998. Contrary to some reports, Key never underwent Tommy John surgery. Instead, noted surgeon James Andrews removed bone chips, costing Key several months in the middle of the 1988 season.

==Post-career==
Following his retirement from baseball, Key became an amateur golfer. Now living in Palm Beach Gardens, he has become prominent in the local golfing community.

<doc id="385786" wikidata="Q312194" url="?curid=385786" title="Victoria (plant)">
<text>Victoria or giant waterlily is a genus of aquatic herbs in the plant family Nymphaeaceae. Its leaves have a remarkable size: &quot;Victoria boliviana&quot; produces leaves up to in width. The genus name was given in honour of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom.

==Description==

===Vegetative characteristics===
&quot;Victoria&quot; species are rhizomatous, aquatic, short-lived, perennial herbs with tuberous rhizomes bearing contractile adventitious roots. The floating leaves are peltate and orbicular. The margin of the lamina is raised. The lamina possesses stomatodes (i.e. microscopic perforations). The abaxial leaf surface posesses prominent, reticulate venation. In Victoria amazonica the leaves are glaberous, with long, hard spines and the underside is red. In Victoria cruziana the leaves are fuzzy with soft spines and the underside is purple. The shape of the rims is also different.

===Generative characteristics===
The up to 25 cm wide, nocturnal, thermogenic, solitary, actinomorphic, chasmogamous, protogynous flowers have prickly pedicels with 4 primary and 8 secondary air canals. The flowers have four prickly, petaloid, 12 cm long, and 7–8 cm wide sepals. The 50-100 petals gradually transition towards the shape of the stamens, however there is an abrupt change between the innermost petals to the outermost staminodia. The androeceum consists of 150–200 stamens. The gynoecium consists of 30–44 fused carpels. The 0–15 cm wide, spiny, irregularly dehiscencent fruit bears arillate, glabrous, smooth or granular seeds. Proliferating pseudanthia are absent.

==Cytology==
The ploidy level is 2x and the chromosome count ranges from 2n = 20 to 2n = 24.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Victoria&quot; was published by Robert Hermann Schomburgk in September 1837. The type species is &quot;Victoria regina&quot; The genus has two synonyms, both published within the same year with the same name: &quot;Victoria&quot; published by John Lindley in October 1837 and &quot;Victoria&quot; published by John Edward Gray in December 1837. There is however disagreement over the correct taxon authority. &quot;Victoria&quot; is seen as correct by several sources, but &quot;Victoria&quot; is also widely regarded as correct, despite being published a month later.
===Species===

===Evolutionary relationships===
Together with the genus &quot;Euryale&quot;, &quot;Victoria&quot; may be placed within the genus &quot;Nymphaea&quot;, rendering it paraphyletic in its current circumscription.

==Ecology==

===Habitat===
It occurs in lakes and streams.
===Pollination===
&quot;Victoria&quot; flowers are pollinated by &quot;Cyclocephala&quot; beetles.

==Use==
===Horticulture===
&quot;Victoria&quot; is a popular ornamental plant.
===Food===
The seeds, petioles, and rhizomes are used as food.
===Other uses===
Root extracts are used as black dye.

<doc id="385793" wikidata="Q2575720" url="?curid=385793" title="Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic">
<text>The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic was the collective head of state of the Russian SFSR and the permanent body of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR that was accountable to the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR in its activity and, within the nominal limits prescribed by the Constitution of the Russian SFSR, performed functions of the highest state power in the Russian SFSR between 1938 and 1990. It was elected by the Supreme Soviet of Russia to perform the Supreme Soviet&#x27;s activities when it was not in session, which, in practice, was most of the year.

== History ==

===Predecessor offices===
The office was created as a replacement for the Central Executive Committee of the All-Russian Congress of Soviets.

===Political significance===
Since the Russian SFSR enjoyed only limited autonomy within the Soviet Union until late into the perestroika period and since real executive power was in the hands of the Soviet Communist Party until 1990, the Supreme Soviet and its Presidium were mostly ceremonial. However, they became important in early 1990 when a newly elected Russian Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies was split between Communist loyalists and their opponents. After days of parliamentary maneuvering, Boris Yeltsin was elected Chairman in May 1990. Soon thereafter, he resigned from the Communist Party and started building an independent power base within the Russian SFSR, which proved to be an important step on the way to the Soviet collapse in late 1991.

==Officeholders==
* Aleksei Badayev (1938–1944)
* Nikolai Shvernik (1944–1946)
* Ivan Vlasov (1946–1950)
* Mikhail Tarasov (1950–1959)
* Nikolai Ignatov (1959)
* Nikolai Organov (1959–1962)
* Nikolai Ignatov (1962–1966)
* Mikhail Yasnov (1966–1985)
* Vladimir Orlov (1985–1988)
* Vitaly Vorotnikov (1988–1990)

Note: In 1989 the position of Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet was abolished. Instead the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet became head of the republic in addition to serving as a parliamentary speaker. Boris Yeltsin was chairman 1990–1991. In early 1991, the post of President of Russia was created and executive powers were transferred from the Supreme Soviet to the President. The responsibilities of the Supreme Soviet Chairman were limited to those of a parliamentary speaker. Boris Yeltsin won the first presidential election in June 1991 and, upon inauguration, resigned from the office of the Supreme Soviet Chairman. He was succeeded by:
* Boris Yeltsin (May 29, 1990 – July 10, 1991)
*Ruslan Khasbulatov (October 29, 1991 – October 4, 1993), acting Chairman from July 10, 1991

==Successor offices==
After the dissolution of the Soviet Union on December 25, 1991, the Russian Supreme Soviet became the acting parliament of the Russian Federation with Khasbulatov as Chairman. It was dissolved during the Russian constitutional crisis of 1993. Supreme Soviet was succeeded by:
* Federal Assembly of Russia (1993 – present)

<doc id="385799" wikidata="Q655921" url="?curid=385799" title="The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich">
<text>The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany is a book by American journalist William L. Shirer in which the author chronicles the rise and fall of Nazi Germany from the birth of Adolf Hitler in 1889 to the end of World War II in Europe in 1945. It was first published in 1960 by Simon &amp; Schuster in the United States. It was a bestseller in both the United States and Europe, and a critical success outside Germany; in Germany, criticism of the book stimulated sales. The book was feted by journalists, as reflected by its receipt of the National Book Award for non-fiction,
but the reception from academic historians was mixed.

The book is based upon captured Nazi documents, the available diaries of propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, of General Franz Halder, and of the Italian Foreign Minister Galeazzo Ciano, evidence and testimony from the Nuremberg trials, British Foreign Office reports, and the author&#x27;s recollection of his six years in Germany (from 1934 to 1940) as a journalist, reporting on Nazi Germany for newspapers, the United Press International (UPI), and CBS Radio.

==Content and themes==
&quot;The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich&quot; is Shirer&#x27;s comprehensive historical interpretation of the Nazi era, positing that German history logically proceeded from Martin Luther to Adolf Hitler; and that Hitler&#x27;s accession to power was an expression of German national character, not of totalitarianism as an ideology that was internationally fashionable in the 1930s. The author summarised his perspective: &quot;[T]he course of German history ... made blind obedience to temporal rulers the highest virtue of Germanic man, and put a premium on servility.&quot; This &quot;Sonderweg&quot; (special path or unique course) interpretation of German history was then common in American scholarship. Yet, despite extensive references, some academic critics consider its interpretation of Nazism to be flawed. The book also includes (identified) speculation, such as the theory that SS Chief Heinrich Müller afterward joined the NKVD of the USSR.

==Development history==
The editor for the book was Joseph Barnes, a foreign editor of the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, a former editor of &quot;PM&quot;, another New York newspaper, and a former speechwriter for Wendell Willkie. Barnes was an old friend of Shirer. The manuscript was very late and Simon &amp; Schuster threatened to cancel the contract several times; each time Barnes would win a reprieve for Shirer. The book took more than five years to write, and Shirer ran out of money long before it was completed. Frank Altschul&#x27;s family project, the Overbrook Foundation, came to the rescue in the summer of 1958, when Shirer was &quot;flat broke&quot; and desperate. At the recommendation of Hamilton Fish Armstrong the Overbrook Foundation advanced immediately to Shirer $5,000 ($52,500 in 2024 dollars) and promised another $5,000 six months later, enabling Shirer to finish his monumental book. In the third volume of his autobiography, Shirer wrote: &quot;This saved my life and my book . . . and I settled back to fourteen hours a day of writing.&quot; 

The original title of the book was &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Nightmare Empire&quot; with &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich&quot; as the sub-title. The title and cover had already been sent out in catalogs when Robert Gottlieb decided that both title and cover had to be changed. He also chose to publish the book as a single volume rather than two as originally planned. Nina Bourne decided that they should use the sub-title as the title and art director Frank Metz designed the black jacket bearing the swastika. Initially bookstores across the country protested displaying the swastika and threatened not to stock the book. The controversy soon blew over and the cover shipped with the symbol.

==Success and acclaim==
In the U.S., where it was published on October 17, 1960, &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich&quot; sold more than one million hardcover copies, two-thirds via the Book of the Month Club, and more than one million paperback copies. In 1961, Simon &amp; Schuster sold the paperback rights to Fawcett Publications for $400,000 (equivalent to $ million in ). It won the 1961 National Book Award for Nonfiction and the Carey–Thomas Award for non-fiction.
In 1962, the &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; magazine serialization reached some 12 million additional readers. In a &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot;, Hugh Trevor-Roper praised it as &quot;a splendid work of scholarship, objective in method, sound in judgment, inescapable in its conclusions.&quot;
The book sold well in Britain, France, Italy, and in West Germany, because of its international recognition, bolstered by German editorial attacks.

Both its recognition by journalists as a great history book and its popular success surprised Shirer, as the publisher had commissioned a first printing of merely 12,500 copies. More than fifteen years after the end of the Second World War, neither Shirer nor the publisher had anticipated much popular interest in Adolf Hitler or in Nazi Germany.

==Criticism==
Nearly all journalists praised the book. Many scholars acknowledged Shirer&#x27;s achievement but some condemned it. The harshest criticism came from those who disagreed with the &quot;Sonderweg&quot; or &quot;Luther to Hitler&quot; thesis. In West Germany, the Sonderweg interpretation was almost universally rejected in favor of the view that Nazism was simply one instance of totalitarianism that arose in various countries. Gavriel Rosenfeld asserted in 1994 that &quot;Rise and Fall&quot; was unanimously condemned by German historians in the 1960s, and considered dangerous to relations between America and West Germany, as it might inflame anti-German sentiments in the United States.

Klaus Epstein listed what he contended were &quot;four major failings&quot;: a crude understanding of German history; a lack of balance, leaving important gaps; no understanding of a modern totalitarian regime; and ignorance of current scholarship of the Nazi period.

Elizabeth Wiskemann concluded in a review that the book was &quot;not sufficiently scholarly nor sufficiently well written to satisfy more academic demands... It is too long and cumbersome... Mr Shirer, has, however compiled a manual... which will certainly prove useful.&quot;

Nearly 36 years after the book&#x27;s publication, LGBT activist Peter Tatchell criticized the book&#x27;s treatment of the persecution of homosexuals in Nazi Germany. In the philosopher Jon Stewart&#x27;s anthology &quot;The Hegel Myths and Legends&quot; (1996), &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich&quot; is listed as a work that has propagated &quot;myths&quot; about the philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel.

In 2004, the historian Richard J. Evans, author of &quot;The Third Reich Trilogy&quot; (2003–2008), said that &quot;Rise and Fall&quot; is a &quot;readable general history of Nazi Germany&quot; and that &quot;there are good reasons for [its] success.&quot; However, he contended that Shirer worked outside the academic mainstream and that Shirer&#x27;s account was not informed by the historical scholarship of the time.

==Adaptation and publication==
A television adaptation was broadcast in the United States on the ABC television network in 1968, consisting of a one-hour episode aired each night over three nights.

The book has been reprinted many times since it was published in 1960. The 1990 edition contained an afterword whereby Shirer gave a brief discourse on how his book was received when it was initially published and the future for Germany during German reunification in the atomic age. The 2011 edition contains a new introduction by Ron Rosenbaum. Current in-print editions are:

* (Grupo Océano, 1987 SP, hardcover)
* (Simon &amp; Schuster, US, 1990 paperback)
* (Arrow Books, UK, 1990 paperback)
* Folio Society edition (2004 hardcover)
* (Simon &amp; Schuster, US, 2011 hardcover)
* (Simon &amp; Schuster, US, 2011 paperback)

There is also an audiobook version, released in 2010 by Blackstone Audio and read by Grover Gardner.

<text>James Badge Dale (born James Badgett Dale; May 1, 1978) is an American actor. He is best known for his roles as Chase Edmunds in &quot;24&quot;, Robert Leckie in &quot;The Pacific&quot;, Trooper Barrigan in &quot;The Departed&quot;, Luke Lewenden in &quot;The Grey&quot;, Eric Savin in &quot;Iron Man 3&quot;, and Tyrone S. &quot;Rone&quot; Woods in &quot;13 Hours&quot;.

== Early life ==
James Badgett Dale was born in New York City&#x27;s Manhattan borough on May 1, 1978, the only child of actress and singer Anita Morris (1943–1994) and actor and dancer Grover Dale (born 1935). He was educated at Wonderland Avenue Elementary School in the Laurel Canyon neighborhood of Los Angeles. At the age of 10, he was picked out of his fifth grade class to audition for the role of Simon in the 1990 film &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;. After gaining the role and spending five months filming on location in Jamaica, he returned to his schooling at Wonderland.

== Career ==
Dale&#x27;s most notable roles to date are Simon in the 1990 film &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; and Chase Edmunds in the third season of the Fox series &quot;24&quot; (which he later reprised in &quot;24: The Game&quot;). He also appeared in &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; as serial killer Henry Darius. The storyline originally began in the &quot;CSI: Miami&quot; episode &quot;Felony&quot; and ended with the &quot;CSI: NY&quot; episode &quot;Manhattan Manhunt&quot;, resulting in a crossover between the two shows.

In 2006, Dale was cast in the pivotal supporting role of Trooper Barrigan in &quot;The Departed&quot;. He then was cast as the lead in AMC&#x27;s political thriller &quot;Rubicon&quot; which revolves around a secret society that pulls the strings on the world political stage like the alleged Illuminati and the Council on Foreign Relations. It centers on brilliant analyst Will Travers (Dale) discovering that his employers are not who they seem to be. He also stars as Robert Leckie, one of the three leads in the HBO miniseries &quot;The Pacific&quot; from executive producers Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg.

In 2013, Dale played Eric Savin in the Marvel superhero film &quot;Iron Man 3&quot;, Captain Speke in the science fiction thriller &quot;World War Z&quot;, Dan Reid in Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot;, and the brother of Lee Harvey Oswald in &quot;Parkland&quot;. In 2014, he starred in an off-Broadway production of &quot;Small Engine Repair&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Dale married actress Emily Wickersham in September 2024. They have a son born in 2021. In October 2024, they had their second child.

<doc id="385801" wikidata="Q826591" url="?curid=385801" title="Nahuas">
<text>The Nahuas ( ) are a Uto-Nahuan ethnicity and one of the indigenous people of Mexico, with Nahua minorities also in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica. They comprise the largest indigenous group in Mexico, as well as the largest population out of any North American Indigenous people group who are native speakers of their respective indigenous language. Amongst the Nahua, this is Nahuatl. When ranked amongst all Indigenous languages across the Americas, Nahuas list third after speakers of Guaraní and Quechua.

The Mexica (Aztecs) are of Nahua ethnicity, as are their historical enemies and allies of the Spaniards: the Tlaxcallans (Tlaxcaltecs). The Toltecs which predated both groups are often thought to have been Nahua as well. However, in the pre-Columbian period Nahuas were subdivided into many groups that did not necessarily share a common identity.

Their Nahuan languages, or Nahuatl, consist of many variants, several of which are mutually unintelligible. About 1.5 million Nahuas speak Nahuatl and another million speak only Spanish. Fewer than 1,000 native speakers of Nahuatl remain in El Salvador.

It is suggested that the Nahua peoples originated near Aridoamerica, in regions of the present day Mexican states of Durango and Nayarit or the Bajío region. They split off from the other Uto-Aztecan speaking peoples and migrated into central Mexico around 500 CE. The Nahua then settled in and around the Basin of Mexico and spread out to become the dominant people in central Mexico. However, Nahuatl-speaking populations were present in smaller populations throughout Mesoamerica.

==Nomenclature==
The name &#x27; is derived from the Nahuatl word-root , which generally means &quot;audible, intelligible, clear&quot; with different derivations including &quot;language&quot; (hence &quot;to speak clearly&quot; and both &quot;something that makes an agreeble sound&quot; and &quot;someone who speaks well or speak one&#x27;s own language&quot;). It was used in contrast with , &quot;to speak unintelligibly&quot; or &quot;speak a foreign language&quot;. Another, related term is &#x27; (singular) or (plural) literally &quot;Nahuatl-speaking people&quot;.

The Nahuas are also sometimes referred to as Aztecs. Using this term for the Nahuas has generally fallen out of favor in scholarship, though it is still used for the Aztec Empire. They have also been called &#x27; (singular), &#x27; (plural) or in Spanish &quot;Mexicans&quot;, after the Mexica, the Nahua tribe which founded the Aztec Empire.

==Mexico==


The Mexican government does not categorize its citizens by ethnicity, but only by language. Statistical information recorded about the Nahua deals only with speakers of the Nahuatl language, although unknown numbers of people of Nahua ethnicity have abandoned the language and now speak only Spanish. Other Nahuas, though bilingual in Nahuatl and Spanish, seek to avoid widespread anti-indigenous discrimination by declining to self-identify as Nahua in INEGI&#x27;s decennial census. Nor does the census count as indigenous children under 5 (estimated to be 11–12% of the indigenous population). An INI-Conepo report indicates the Mexican indigenous population is nearly 250% greater than that reported by INEGI.

As of 2020, Nahuatl is spoken across Mexico by an estimated 1.6 million people, including 111,797 monolingual speakers. This is an increase from 1.4 million people speakers total but a decrease from 190,000 monolingual speakers in 2000. The state of Guerrero had the highest ratio of monolingual Nahuatl speakers, calculated at 24.8%, based on 2000 census figures. The proportion of monolinguals for most other states is less than 5%.

The largest concentrations of Nahuatl speakers are found in the states of Puebla, Veracruz, Hidalgo, San Luis Potosí, and Guerrero. Significant populations are also found in México State, Morelos, and the Mexican Federal District, with smaller communities in Michoacán and Durango. Nahuatl was formerly spoken in the states of Jalisco and Colima, where it became extinct during the 20th century. As a result of internal migrations within the country, all Mexican states today have some isolated pockets and groups of Nahuatl speakers. The modern influx of Mexican workers and families into the United States has resulted in the establishment of a few small Nahuatl-speaking communities, particularly in Texas, New York and California.

64.3% of Nahuatl speakers are literate in Spanish compared with the national average of 97.5% for Spanish literacy. Male Nahuatl speakers have 9.8 years of education on average and women 10.1, compared with the 13.6 and 14.1 years that are the national averages for men and women, respectively.

==Central America==
In El Salvador, it is estimated that there are 12,000 Nahuas/Pipiles. However, some indigenous organizations claim that the real population is significantly higher. Their Nawat language is endangered, but undergoing a revival.

In Nicaragua, the International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs counted 20,000 Nahuas/Nicaraos in 2022. The International Labour Organization also counted 20,000 Nicaraos. However, DNA analysis has proven that the Nahua admixture in the modern Nicaraguan gene pool is high, especially among western Nicaraguans, both whites and Mestizos alike, making the number of Nahua descendants much higher. Fully indigenous Nahuas can be found all over the western half of Nicaragua. They spoke the Nawat language before it went extinct in Nicaragua in the late 1800s.

In Costa Rica, a small population of Nahuas inhabit Bagaces and other parts of Guanacaste province. They are descended from Nicaraos who migrated and displaced the Huetares who originally inhabited Bagaces. They spoke the Nawat language before it went extinct in Costa Rica.

In Honduras, different sources give estimates of 6,339 and 19,800 persons of Nahua ethnicity. They are concentrated in Olancho, in the municipalities of Catacamas, Gualaco, Guata, Jano and Esquipulas del Norte. Nawat is extinct here. However, unlike the Nahuas of El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica who fled central and southern Mexico during the post-classical era due to famine, societal collapse, civil wars, and invasions from enemy forces, the Nahuas of Honduras are descended from pochtecas who were sent to Central America by Ahuizotl of Tenochtitlan at the start of the modern era in 1501 CE to establish trade relations with the indigenous peoples of Central America. This means that the Nahua heritage of Honduras is modern and recent instead of pre-Columbian.

==Geography==
At the turn of the 16th century, Nahua populations occupied territories ranging across Mesoamerica as far south as Panama. However, their core area was Central Mexico, including the Valley of Mexico, the Toluca Valley, the eastern half of the Balsas River basin, and modern-day Tlaxcala and most of Puebla, although other linguistic and ethnic groups lived in these areas as well. They were also present in large numbers in El Salvador, Nicaragua, southeastern Veracruz, and Colima and coastal Michoacan. Classical Nahuatl was a lingua franca in Central Mexico before the Spanish conquest due to Aztec hegemony, and its role was not only preserved but expanded in the initial stage of colonial rule, encouraged by the Spaniards as a literary language and tool to convert diverse Mesoamerican peoples. There are many Nahuatl place names in regions where Nahuas were not the most populous group (including the names of Guatemala and several Mexican states), due to Aztec expansion, Spanish invasions in which Tlaxcaltecs served as the main force, and the usage of Nahuatl as a lingua franca.

The last of the southern Nahua populations today are the Pipil of El Salvador and the Nicarao of Nicaragua. Nahua populations in Mexico are centered in the middle of the country, with most speakers in the states of Puebla, Veracruz, Hidalgo, Guerrero and San Luis Potosí. However, smaller populations are spread throughout the country due to recent population movements within Mexico. Within the last 50 years, Nahua populations have appeared in the United States, particularly in New York City, Los Angeles, and Houston.

==History==
===Pre-conquest period===
Archaeological, historical and linguistic evidence suggest that the Nahuas originally came from the deserts of northern Mexico (Aridoamerica) and migrated into central Mexico in several waves. The presence of the Mexicanero people (who speak a Nahuatl variant) in this area until the present day affirms this theory.
Before the Nahuas entered Mesoamerica, they were probably living for a while in northwestern Mexico alongside the Cora and Huichol peoples. The first group of Nahuas to split from the main group were the Pochutec who went on to settle on the Pacific coast of Oaxaca possibly as early as 400 CE. From the Nahua quickly rose to power in central Mexico and expanded into areas earlier occupied by Oto-Manguean, Totonacan and Huastec peoples. Through their integration in the Mesoamerican cultural area the Nahuas adopted many cultural traits including maize agriculture and urbanism, religious practices including a ritual calendar of 260 days and the practice of human sacrifices and the construction of monumental architecture and the use of logographic writing.

Around 1000 CE the Toltec people, normally assumed to have been of Nahua ethnicity, established dominion over much of central Mexico which they ruled from Tollan Xicocotitlan.

From this period on the Nahua were the dominant ethnic group in the Valley of Mexico and far beyond, and migrations kept coming in from the north. After the fall of the Toltecs a period of large population movements followed and some Nahua groups such as the Pipil and Nicarao arrived as far south as northwestern Costa Rica. And in central Mexico different Nahua groups based in their different &quot;Altepetl&quot; city-states fought for political dominance. The Xochimilca, based in Xochimilco ruled an area south of Lake Texcoco; the Tepanecs ruled the area to the west and the Acolhua ruled an area to the east of the valley. One of the last of the Nahua migrations to arrive in the valley settled on an island in the Lake Texcoco and proceeded to subjugate the surrounding tribes. This group were the Mexica who during the next 300 years became the dominant ethnic group of Mesoamerica ruling from Tenochtitlan their island capital. They formed the Aztec Empire after allying with the Tepanecs and Acolhua people of Texcoco, spreading the political and linguistic influence of the Nahuas well into Central America.

===Conquest period (1519–1523)===
In 1519 an expedition of Spaniards sailing from Cuba under the leadership of Hernán Cortés arrived on the Mexican gulf coast near the Totonac city of Quiyahuiztlan. The Totonacs were one of the peoples that were politically subjugated by the Aztecs and word was immediately sent to the Aztec Emperor (in Nahuatl, Tlatoani) of Tenochtitlan Motecuhzoma II. Going inland the Spaniards encountered and fought with Totonac forces and Nahua forces from the independent Altepetl of Tlaxcallan. The Tlaxcaltecs were a Nahua group who had avoided being subjugated by the Aztecs. After being defeated in battle by the Spaniards, the Tlaxcalans entered into an alliance with Cortes that would be invaluable in the struggle against the Aztecs. The Spanish and Tlaxcaltec forces marched upon several cities that were under Aztec dominion and &quot;liberated&quot; them, before they arrived in the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan. There they were welcomed as guests by Motecuhzoma II, but after a while they took the ruler prisoner. When the Aztec nobility realized that their ruler had been turned into a Spanish puppet they attacked the Spaniards and chased them out of the city. The Spaniards sought refuge in Tlaxcala where they regrouped and awaited reinforcements. During the next year they cooperated with large Tlaxcaltec armies and undertook a siege campaign resulting in the final fall of Tenochtitlan. After the fall of Tenochtitlan Spanish forces now also allied with the Aztecs to incorporate all the previous Aztec provinces into the realm of New Spain. New Spain was founded as a state under Spanish rule but where Nahua people were recognized as allies of the rulers and as such were granted privileges and a degree of independence that other indigenous peoples of the area did not enjoy. Recently historians such as Stephanie Wood and Matthew Restall have argued that the Nahua did not experience the conquest as something substantially different from the sort of ethnic conflicts that they were used to, and that in fact they may have at first interpreted it as a defeat of one Nahua group by another.

==Colonial period (1521–1821)==
With the arrival of the Spanish in Mesoamerica a new political situation ensued. The period has been extensively studied by historians, with Charles Gibson publishing a classic monograph entitled &quot;The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule&quot;. Historian James Lockhart built on that work, publishing &quot;The Nahuas After the Conquest&quot; in 1992. He divides the colonial history of the Nahua into three stages largely based on linguistic evidence in local-level Nahuatl sources, which he posits are an index of the degree of interaction between Spaniards and Nahuas and changes in Nahua culture. An overview of the Nahuas of colonial Central Mexico can be found in the &quot;Cambridge History of the Native Peoples of the Americas&quot;.

===Stage one (1519–c. 1550) Conquest and early colonial period===
The early period saw the first stages of the establishment of churches by mendicant friars in large and important indigenous towns, the assertion of crown control over New Spain by the high court (&quot;Audiencia&quot;) and then the establishment of the viceroyalty, and the heyday of conqueror power over the indigenous via the encomienda. In the initial stage of the colonial period, contact between Spaniards and the indigenous populations was limited. It consisted mostly in the mendicants who sought to convert the population to Catholicism, and the reorganization of the indigenous tributary system to benefit individual Spaniards. The indigenous system of smaller settlements&#x27; paying tribute and rendering labor service to dominant political entities was transformed into the &quot;Encomienda&quot; system. Indigenous of particular towns paid tribute to a Spanish &quot;encomendero&quot; who was awarded the labor and tribute of that town. In this early period, the hereditary indigenous ruler or &quot;tlatoani&quot; and noblemen continued to hold power locally and were key to mobilizing tribute and labor for encomenderos. They also continued to hold titles from the pre-conquest period. Most willing accepted baptism so that records for this period show Nahua elites with Christian given names (indicating baptism) and many holding the Spanish noble title &quot;don&quot;. A set of censuses in alphabetic Nahuatl for the Cuernavaca region c. 1535 gives us a baseline for the impact of Spanish on Nahuatl, showing few Spanish loanwords taken into Nahuatl.

As the Spaniards sought to extend their political dominance into the most remote corners of Mesoamerica, the Nahua accompanied them as auxiliaries. In the early colonial period, new Nahua settlements were made in northern Mexico and far south into Central America. Nahua forces often formed the bulk of the Spanish military expeditions that conquered other Mesoamerican peoples, such as the Maya, Zapotecs, and Mixtecs.

With the arrival of Christian missionaries, the first priority of the colonial authorities was eradicating indigenous religious practices, something they achieved by a combination of violence and threats of violence, and patient education. Nahua were baptized with Spanish names. The Nahua who did not abandon their religious practices were severely punished or executed. The Nahua, however, often incorporated pre-Christian practices and beliefs into the Christian religion without the authorities&#x27; noticing it. Often they kept practicing their own religion in the privacy of their homes, especially in rural areas where Spanish presence was almost completely lacking and the conversion process was slow.

The Nahua quickly took the Latin alphabetic writing as their own. Within 20 years of the arrival of the Spanish, the Nahua were composing texts in their own language. In 1536 the first university of the Americas, the &quot;Colegio de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco&quot; was inaugurated. It was established by the Franciscans whose aim was to educate young Nahua noblemen to be Catholic priests who were trilingual: literate in Spanish, Latin and Nahuatl.

=== Stage two (c. 1550 – c. 1650) ===

There are a large number of texts by and about Nahuas in this middle period and during this period Nahuatl absorbed a large number of loanwords from Spanish, particularly nouns for particular objects, indicating the closer contact between the European sphere and the indigenous. However, Nahuatl verbs and syntax show no evidence of the impact of Spanish contact. In the mid-sixteenth century, cultural change at the local level can be tracked through the production of Nahuatl alphabetic texts. The production of a wide range of written documents in Nahuatl dates from this period, including legal documents for transactions (bills of sale), minutes of indigenous town council (&quot;cabildo&quot;) records, petitions to the crown, and others.

Institutionally, indigenous town government shifted from the rule of the tlatoani and noblemen to the establishment of Spanish-style town councils (&quot;cabildos&quot;), with officers holding standard Spanish titles. A classic study of sixteenth-century Tlaxcala, the main ally of the Spaniards in the conquest of the Mexica, shows that much of the prehispanic structure continued into the colonial period. An important set of cabildo records in Nahuatl for Tlaxcala is extant and shows how local government functioned in for nearly a century.

Regarding religion, by the mid- to late 16th century, even the most zealous mendicants of the first generation doubted the capacity of Nahua men to become Christian priests so that the Colegio de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco ceased to function to that end and in 1555 Indians were barred from ordination to the priesthood. However, in local communities, stone-built church complexes continued to be built and elaborated, with murals in mixed indigenous-Spanish forms. Confraternities (&quot;cofradías&quot;) were established to support the celebrations of a particular Christian saint and functioned as burial societies for members. During this period, an expression of personal piety, the Church promoted the making of last wills and testaments, with many testators donating money to their local Church to say Masses for their souls.

For individual Nahua men and women dictating a last will and testament to a local Nahua notary (&quot;escribano&quot;) became standard. These wills provide considerable information about individuals&#x27; residence, kin relations, and property ownership provides a window into social standing, differences between the sexes, and business practices at the local level. showing not only that literacy of some elite men in alphabetic writing in Nahuatl was a normal part of everyday life at the local level and that the notion of making a final will was expected, even for those who had little property. A number of studies in the tradition of what is now called the New Philology extensively use Nahuatl wills as a source.

=== Stage three (c. 1650 – 1821) Late colonial period to independence ===
From the mid-seventeenth century to the achievement of independence in 1821, Nahuatl shows considerable impact from the European sphere and a full range of bilingualism. Texts produced at the local level that in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries were sometimes a mixture of pictorial and alphabetic forms of expression were now primarily alphabetic. In the late eighteenth century, there is evidence of text being written in &quot;Nahuatlized Spanish&quot;, written by Nahuas who were now communicating in their own form of Spanish. Year-by-year accounts of major occurrences, a text known as an annal, no longer reference the prehispanic period. Local level documentation for individual Nahuas continued to be produced, in particular last wills and testaments, but they are much more simplified than those produced in the late sixteenth century.

Nahuas began to produce an entirely new type of text, known as &quot;primordial titles&quot; or simply &quot;titles&quot; (&quot;títulos&quot;), that assert indigenous communities&#x27; rights to particular territory, often by recording local lore in an atemporal fashion. There is no known prehispanic precedent for this textual form and none appears before 1650. Several factors might be at work for the appearance of titles. One might be a resurgence of indigenous population after decades recovering from devastating epidemics when communities might have been less concerned with Spanish encroachment. Another might be the crown&#x27;s push to regularize defective land titles via a process known as &quot;composición&quot;. The crown had mandated minimum land holdings for indigenous communities at 600 &quot;varas&quot;, in property that was known as the &quot;&quot;, and to separate indigenous communities from Spanish lands by more than 1,100 varas. Towns were to have access to water, uplands for gathering firewood, and agricultural land, as well as common lands for pasturage. Despite these mandated legal protections for Indian towns, courts continued to find in favor of Spaniards and the rules about minimum holdings for Indian towns were ignored in practice.

Labor arrangements between Nahuas and Spaniards were largely informal, rather than organized through the mainly defunct encomienda and the poorly functioning repartimiento. Spanish landed estates needed a secure labor force, often a mixture of a small group of permanent laborers and part-time or seasonal laborers drawn from nearby indigenous communities. Individual Indians made arrangements with estate owners rather than labor being mobilized via the community. The indigenous communities continued to function as political entities, but there was greater fragmentation of units as dependent villages (&quot;sujetos&quot;) of the main settlement (&quot;cabecera&quot;) sought full, independent status themselves. Indigenous officials were no longer necessarily noblemen.

== National period (1821–present) ==
With the achievement of Mexican independence in 1821, the casta system, which divided the population into racial categories with differential rights, was eliminated and the term &quot;Indian&quot; (&quot;indio&quot;) was no longer used by government, although it continued to be used in daily speech. The creation of a republic in 1824 meant that Mexicans of all types were citizens rather than vassals of the crown. One important consequence for Nahua people and other Indigenous people was that documentation in the native languages generally ceased to be produced. Indigenous towns did not cease to exist nor did indigenous populations speaking their own language, but the Indigenous people were far more marginalized in the post-independence period than during the colonial era. In the colonial era the crown had a paternalistic stance toward the Indigenous people, in essence according them special rights, a fuero, and giving support to structures in Indigenous towns and giving Indigenous people a level of protection against those who were not Indigenous. This can be seen in the establishment of the General Indian Court where Indigenous towns and individual Indigenous people could sue those making incursions on their land and other abuses. These protections disappeared in the national period. One scholar has characterized the early national period of Nahua people and other Indigenous people &quot;as the beginning of a systematic policy of cultural genocide and the increasing loss of native languages.&quot; Lack of official recognition and both economic and cultural pressures meant that most Indigenous peoples in Central Mexico became more Europeanized and many became Spanish speakers.

In 19th-century Mexico, the so-called &quot;Indian Question&quot; exercised politicians and intellectuals, who viewed Indigenous people as backward, unassimilated to the Mexican nation, whose custom of communal rather than individual ownership of land was impediment to economic progress. Non-Indigenous landowners of estates had already encroached on Indigenous ownership in the colonial era, but now liberal ideology sought to end communal protections on ownership with its emphasis on private property. Since land was the basis for Indigenous peoples&#x27;ability to maintain a separate identity,and a sense of sovereignty, land tenure became a central issue for liberal reformers. The liberal Reforma enshrined in the Constitution of 1857 mandated the breakup of corporate-owned property, therefore targeting Indigenous communities and the Roman Catholic Church, which also had significant holdings. This measure affected all Indigenous communities, including Nahua communities, holding land. Liberal Benito Juárez, a Zapotec who became president of Mexico, was fully in support of laws to end corporate landholding. The outbreak of the Mexican Revolution in Morelos, which still had a significant Nahua population, was sparked by peasant resistance to the expansion of sugar estates. This was preceded in the nineteenth century by smaller Indigenous revolts against encroachment, particularly during the civil war of the Reforma, foreign intervention, and a weak state following the exit of the French in 1867.

A number of Indigenous men had made a place for themselves in post-independence Mexico, the most prominent being Benito Juárez. But an important nineteenth-century figure of Nahua was Ignacio Manuel Altamirano (1834–1893), born in Tixtla, Guerrero who became a well respected liberal intellectual, man of letters, politician, and diplomat. Altamirano was a fierce anticlerical politician, and was known for a period as &quot;the Marat of the Radicals&quot; and an admirer of the French Revolution. Altamirano, along with other liberals, saw universal primary public education as a key way to change Mexico, promoting for upward mobility. Altamirano&#x27;s chief disciple in this view was Justo Sierra. Another prominent Nahua figure of this period was Prospero Cahuantzi, who served as governor of Tlaxcala from 1885-1911. Indigenous surnames were uncommon in post-colonial Mexico but prevalent in Tlaxcala due to certain protections granted by the Spanish government in return for Tlaxcallan support during the overthrow of the Aztecs. Cahuantzi was active in promoting the preservation of indigenous culture and artifacts at a time when Mexican government policy was generally that of suppression.

The Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata (1879–1919) was likely of mixed Nahua-Spanish heritage, with ancestry going back to the Nahua city of Mapaztlán, in the state of Morelos. Zapata was evidently fluent in Nahuatl and would give speeches in the language to Nahua peasants in hopes of inspiring them to join his cause.

==Culture==
=== Economy ===

Many Nahua are agriculturists. They practice various forms of cultivation including the use of horses or mules to plow or slash-and-burn. Common crops include corn, wheat, beans, barley, chilli peppers, onions, tomatoes, and squash. Some Nahuas also raise sheep and cattle.

===Language===
The languages traditionally spoken by the Nahuas are the Nahuan languages, which include the different dialects of Nahuatl and the Pipil language.

<text>A cockatrice is a mythical beast, essentially a two-legged dragon, wyvern, or serpent-like creature with a rooster&#x27;s head. Described by Laurence Breiner as &quot;an ornament in the drama and poetry of the Elizabethans&quot;, it was featured prominently in English thought and myth for centuries. They are created by a chicken egg hatched by a toad or snake.

==Legend==

===Origins===

The first English mention of the cockatrice was in the 14th century John Wycliffe translation of the Bible. The word was used for the translation of various Hebrew words for asp and adder in the Book of Isaiah 11, 14 and 59. 

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; gives a derivation from Old French , from medieval Latin , a translation of the Greek , meaning tracker. The twelfth century legend was based on a reference in &quot;Pliny&#x27;s Natural History&quot; that the ichneumon lay in wait for the crocodile to open its jaws for the &quot;trochilus&quot; bird to enter and pick its teeth clean. An extended description of the by the 15th-century Spanish traveller in Egypt, Pedro Tafur, makes it clear that this refers to the Nile crocodile.

According to Alexander Neckam&#x27;s (ca 1180), the basilisk () was the product of an egg laid by a rooster and incubated by a toad; a snake might be substituted in re-tellings. Cockatrice became seen as synonymous with basilisk when the in Bartholomeus Anglicus&#x27;s (ca 1260) was translated by John Trevisa as &quot;cockatrice&quot; (1397). This legend has a possible Egyptian folk root; the eggs of the ibis were regularly destroyed for fear that the venom of the snakes they consumed would cause a hybrid snake-bird to hatch.

It is thought that a cock egg would hatch a cockatrice, and this could be prevented by tossing the egg over the family house, landing on the other side of the house, without allowing the egg to hit the house.

===Abilities===

The cockatrice has the reputed ability to kill people by either looking at them—&quot;the death-darting eye of Cockatrice&quot; —touching them, or sometimes breathing on them.

It was repeated in the late-medieval bestiaries that the weasel is the only animal that is immune to the glance of a cockatrice. It was also thought that a cockatrice would die instantly upon hearing a rooster crow, and according to legend, having a cockatrice look at itself in a mirror is one of the few sure-fire ways to kill it.

===Cultural references===
The first use of the word in English was in John Wyclif&#x27;s 1382 translation of the Bible to translate different Hebrew words. This usage was followed by the King James Version, the word being used several times. The Revised Version—following the tradition established by Jerome&#x27;s Vulgate &quot;basiliscus&quot;—renders the word as &quot;basilisk&quot;, and the New International Version translates it as &quot;viper&quot;. In Proverbs 23:32 the similar Hebrew &quot;tzeph&#x27;a&quot; is rendered &quot;adder&quot;, both in the Authorized Version and the Revised Version.

In Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Richard III&quot; (c. 1593), the Duchess of York compares her son Richard to a cockatrice:
A cockatrice is also mentioned in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (1597), in Act 3, scene 2 line 47, by Juliet.
Nathan Field, in the first scene of his play &quot;The Honest Man&#x27;s Fortune&quot; (1647), also uses the idea that a cockatrice could kill with its eyes:... never threaten with your eyes, they are no cockatrice&#x27;s ...

In Second Nephi 24:29, a Cockatrice is mentioned.
In E. R. Eddison&#x27;s high fantasy novel &quot;The Worm Ouroboros&quot; (1922), Chapter 4 has King Gorice show a cockatrice to Gro:
The cockatrice has also been used as a staple enemy creature in arcade combat games like &quot;Golden Axe&quot;, in fantasy RPGs such as &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot; or computer RPGs like &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Dogma&quot; (2012).

A cockatrice is mentioned in &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; (2000) by Hermione Granger in chapter fifteen. A cockatrice involved in one of the tasks of the 1792 Triwizard Tournament escaped and injured the headmasters of the three participating schools, an incident cited as the cause for the cancellation of Triwizard Tournaments until 1994. Some translations instead state the cockatrice to be a basilisk or an &quot;occamy&quot;, an in-universe relative of the snallygaster. Additionally, heraldry of a white cockatrice holding a broomstick on a blue and beige background is shown to be the emblem of the French National Quidditch team in the 2003 video game &quot;Harry Potter: Quidditch World Cup&quot;.

In the video game &quot;&quot; (2003), cockatrices are among the enemies the player faces in Sol City.

In the animated series &quot;My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic&quot; (2010-2019), a cockatrice is stated to live in the Everfree Forest. In the 2011 episode &quot;Stare Master&quot;, the cockatrice turns Twilight Sparkle and one of Fluttershy&#x27;s chickens, Elizabeak, to stone using its gaze, but reverts them back after being intimidated by Fluttershy&#x27;s own stare.

On the SCP Foundation collaborative writing project, cockatrices are shown in the story &quot;SCP-1013 - Cockatrice&quot; (2011). An SCP-1013 instead paralyzes its prey by staring at them, only turning their skin to stone upon biting them, after which it will peck through the calcified skin to eat their prey&#x27;s fleshy innards. SCP-1013 reproduce from growths budding off of the tail of a well-fed adult. The story &quot;SCP-1013 - Cockatrice&quot; won fourth place in the site&#x27;s SCP-1000 Contest, a contest that prefaced the opening of the site&#x27;s second series.

A cockatrice is shown as the main antagonist in the first episode of Netflix&#x27;s anime adaptation of &quot;Little Witch Academia&quot; (2017), &quot;Starting Over&quot;. The cockatrice is also a dungeon boss in the underground labyrinth gameplay section of &quot;Little Witch Academia: Chamber of Time&quot; (2017), a video game for PC and PS4.

The Swedish Black Metal band &quot;Funeral Mis&quot;t has a song named Cockatrice, in their 2018 album Hekatomb.

The third chapter of the Japanese manga series &quot;Delicious in Dungeon&quot; (2014) and the second episode of the anime adaptation (2024) feature the party killing and cooking a cockatrice. The cockatrice cannot kill with a stare, but instead has a powerful venom, the antidote to which can be found by eating the meat of the creature.

== In heraldry ==

Arthur Fox-Davies describes the cockatrice as &quot;comparatively rare&quot; in heraldry, and as closely resembling a wyvern outside of possessing a rooster&#x27;s head rather than a dragon&#x27;s. The cockatrice, like the rooster, is often depicted with its comb, wattles and beak being of a different colour from the rest of its body. The cockatrice is sometimes referred to as a basilisk, but Fox-Davies distinguishes the two on the basis of the heraldic basilisk possessing a tail ending in a dragon&#x27;s head, although he does not know of any arms depicting such a creature.

In continental European heraldic systems, cockatrices may be simply referred to as dragons instead.

The cockatrice was the heraldic beast of the Langleys of Agecroft Hall in Lancashire, England, as far back as the 14th century.

It is also the symbol of 3 (Fighter) Squadron, a fighter squadron of the Royal Air Force.

<doc id="385807" wikidata="Q7093413" url="?curid=385807" title="One World (Willkie book)">
<text>One World is a manifesto and a travelogue written by Wendell Willkie, a liberal Republican, about his seven-week, 31,000-mile tour. Originally published in April 1943, it advocates for an end to colonialism, world federalism, and equality for non-whites in the United States.

&quot;One World&quot; inspired the One World movement and the World Federalist Movement — which included among its supporters Albert Einstein, Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru —and advocated strong and democratic super-national institutions. That wave of thinking foretold the postwar international order, including the United Nations System, but was also very critical of the postwar order and the UN, claiming it is insufficient to avoid another world war.

Willkie was accompanied on his tour by, among others, the publisher and editor Gardner Cowles, Jr., who ultimately assisted Willkie in the writing of &quot;One World&quot; (which was edited by Irita Van Doren).

==Content of the book==
It is a document of his world travels and meetings with many of the Allies&#x27; heads of state as well as ordinary citizens and soldiers in locales such as El Alamein, Russia, and Iran. The main idea of the book is that the world became one small inter-connected unit and Isolationism is no longer possible:

&quot;There are no distant points in the world any longer.&quot; What concerns &quot;myriad millions of human beings&quot; abroad, concerns the Americans. &quot;Our thinking in the future must be world-wide.&quot;

To win the peace, &quot;we must now plan for peace on a world basis&quot; and &quot;play an active, constructive part in freeing and keeping&quot; this peace. By &quot;peace on world basis&quot; he meant:

Willkie emphasized that across the world the &quot;reservoir of goodwill&quot; towards the United States is much larger than towards other contemporary powers:
 The world, he argued, is ready for this sort of world government.

Willkie anticipated military and economic integration of West Europe after the war: &quot;The re-creation of the small countries of Europe as political units, &quot;yes&quot;; their re-creation as economic and military units, &quot;no&quot;, if we really hope to bring stabilization to Western Europe...&quot;

He sought to extend the Atlantic Charter beyond West Europe to all world. &quot;That was one of the reasons why I was so greatly distressed when Mr. Churchill subsequently made his world-disturbing remark, &#x27;We mean to hold our own. I did not become His Majesty&#x27;s first minister in order to preside over the liquidation of the British Empire.&#x27;&quot;

Willkie opposed Colonialism in general, including the American: &quot;The British are by no means the only colonial rulers.&quot; The French, Dutch, Portuguese and Belgians are in the list. &quot;And we ourselves have not yet promised complete freedom to all the peoples in the West Indies for whom we have assumed responsibility.&quot;

He warned on the Soviet rule over East Europe: &quot;The failure of Mr. Stalin to announce to a worried world Russia&#x27;s specific aspirations with reference to Eastern Europe weighs the scales once more against the proclaimed purposes of leaders.&quot;

Willkie was also critical of the disparity between the Atlantic Charter and the domestic American racial and anti-Semitic policies—a phenomenon he labeled &quot;domestic imperialism.&quot;

Especially emphasized is the position of China in the world after World War II; involved in a civil war between Nationalists and Communists, Willkie prophesies that whichever power achieves victory will make China a force to be reckoned with. It is the duty of the United Nations (the Allies) to make sure that the power is friendly to American and other Allied interests but also that it is powerful enough to help the Chinese, the world&#x27;s most populated nation.

==Popularity==
&quot;One World&quot; &quot;became the greatest nonfiction bestseller to date in US publishing history.&quot; It spent four months atop the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list beginning in May 1943 and selling over 1.5 million copies during those four months. Harold Urey wrote of it, &quot;Wendell Willkie left a monument more enduring than granite in the words &#x27;One World&#x27;...&quot; The title &quot;One World&quot; could influence the title of the famous trilogy &quot;One World or None&quot; (1946), implying that this is the alternative in the atomic age. The editor of &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; hailed One World as a &#x27;record-breaking non-fiction best seller,&#x27; a phenomenon &#x27;unequaled since the days of the old blue-backed &#x27;speller&#x27;—Noah Webster&#x27;s Revolutionary-era guide to the new American English. The success of the book caught Willkie by surprise and the proceeds from the book went to war relief agencies in Britain, Russia, and China. Matthew Rozsa of &quot;Salon&quot; wrote in 2022 that the book has &quot;an unintentionally humorous subtext&quot; because of Willkie&#x27;s rumored affair with then-Chinese First Lady Soong Meiling, who was described in the book as having &quot;a generous and understanding heart, a gracious and beautiful manner and appearance, and a burning conviction.&quot; Rozsa added that Willkie&#x27;s book is still relevant because of global issues like &quot;the climate crisis, massive inequality, the rising threat of fascism and the threat of nuclear war.&quot;

<doc id="385808" wikidata="Q1156747" url="?curid=385808" title="Enneads">
<text>The Enneads (; ), fully The Six Enneads, is the collection of writings of the philosopher Plotinus, edited and compiled by his student Porphyry (270). Plotinus was a student of Ammonius Saccas, and together they were founders of Neoplatonism. His work, through Augustine of Hippo, the Cappadocian Fathers, Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite and several subsequent Christian and Muslim thinkers, has greatly influenced Western and Near-Eastern thought.

==Contents==
Porphyry edited the writings of Plotinus in fifty-four treatises, which vary greatly in length and number of chapters, mostly because he split original texts and joined others together to match this very number. Then, he proceeded to set the fifty-four treatises in groups of nine (Greek. &quot;ennea&quot;) or &quot;Enneads&quot;. He also collected &quot;The Enneads&quot; into three volumes. The first volume contained the first three &quot;Enneads&quot; (I, II, III), the second volume has the &quot;Fourth&quot; (IV) and the &quot;Fifth&quot; (V) &quot;Enneads&quot;, and the last volume was devoted to the remaining &quot;Ennead&quot;. After correcting and naming each treatise, Porphyry wrote a biography of his master, &quot;Life of Plotinus&quot;, intended to be an introduction to the &quot;Enneads&quot;.

Porphyry&#x27;s edition does not follow the chronological order in which &quot;Enneads&quot; were written (see &quot;Chronological listing&quot; below), but responds to a plan of study which leads the learner from subjects related to his own affairs to subjects concerning the uttermost principles of the universe.

Although not exclusively, Porphyry writes in chapters 24–26 of the &quot;Life of Plotinus&quot; that the &quot;First Ennead&quot; deals with human or ethical topics, the &quot;Second&quot; and &quot;Third Enneads&quot; are mostly devoted to cosmological subjects or physical reality. The &quot;Fourth&quot; concerns the Soul, the &quot;Fifth&quot; knowledge and intelligible reality, and finally the &quot;Sixth&quot; covers being and what is above it, the One or first principle of all.

==Citing the &quot;Enneads&quot;==
Since the publishing of a modern critical edition of the Greek text by Paul Henry and Hans-Rudolf Schwyzer (&quot;Plotini Opera&quot;. 3 volumes. Paris-Bruxelles, 1951–1973; H-S1 or &quot;editio major&quot; text) and the revised one (&quot;Plotini Opera&quot;. 3 volumes. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1964–1984; referred to as the H-S2 or &quot;editio minor&quot; text) there is an academic convention of citing the &quot;Enneads&quot; by first mentioning the number of &quot;Ennead&quot; (usually in Romans from I to VI), the number of treatise within each &quot;Ennead&quot; (in arabics from 1 to 9), the number of chapter (in arabics also), and the line(s) in one of the mentioned editions. These numbers are divided by periods, commas, or blank spaces.

E.g. For &quot;Fourth Ennead&quot; (IV), treatise number seven (7), chapter two (2), lines one to five (1-5), we write:

* IV.7.2.1-5

E.g. The following three mean &quot;Third Ennead&quot; (III), treatise number five (5), chapter nine (9), line eight (8):

* III, 5, 9, 8 
* 3,5,9,8
* III 5 9 8

It is important to remark that some translations or editions do not include the line numbers according to P. Henry and H.-R. Schwyzer&#x27;s edition. In addition to this, the chronological order of the treatises is numbered between brackets or parentheses, and given below.

E.g. For the previously given:

* IV.7 (2).2.1-5 since treatise IV.7 was the second written by Plotinus.
* III, 5 [50], 9, 8 since III.5 was the fiftieth written by Plotinus.

* I.6, IV.7, III.1, IV.2, V.9, IV.8, V.4, IV.9, VI.9
* V.1, V.2, II.4, III.9, II.2, III.4, I.9, II.6, V.7

After the fall of Western Roman Empire and during the period of the Byzantine Empire, the authorship of some Plotinus&#x27; texts became clouded.
Many passages of &quot;Enneads&quot; IV-VI, now known as &quot;Plotiniana Arabica&quot;, circulated among Islamic scholars (as Al-Kindi, Al-Farabi and Avicenna) under the name &quot;The Theology of Aristotle&quot; or quoted as &quot;Sayings of an old [wise] man&quot;.
The writings had a significant effect on Islamic philosophy, due to Islamic interest in Aristotle. A Latin version of the so-called &quot;Theology&quot; appeared in Europe in 1519. (Cf. O&#x27;Meara, &quot;An Introduction to the Enneads&quot;. Oxford: 1995, 111ff.)

<text>Claudine Alexandrine Guérin de Tencin, Baroness of [[Saint-Martin-de-Ré]] (27 April 1682 – 4 December 1749) was a French salonist and author. She was the mother of Jean le Rond d&#x27;Alembert, who later became a prominent mathematician, &quot;philosophe&quot; and contributor to the &quot;Encyclopédie, &quot;though she left him on the steps of the church a few days after his birth in November 1717.

== Early life ==

Claudine was born in Grenoble, France where her father, Antoine Guérin, sieur de Tencin, was president of the parlement. Claudine was brought up at a convent near Grenoble and, at the wish of her parents, took the veil but broke her vows and succeeded, in 1712, in gaining formal permission from Pope Clement XI for her secularisation.
She is reputed to have had a liaison, while still formally a nun, with the Irish exile soldier Arthur Dillon.

== Life as a socialite ==

She joined her sister Mme. de Ferriol in Paris, where she soon established a salon, frequented by wits and roués. Among her numerous lovers and benefactors was the Chevalier Louis-Camus Destouches, by whom she had an illegitimate son, Jean le Rond d&#x27;Alembert. Guillaume Dubois, the future First Minister was reportedly another of her lovers, even after he became Archbishop of Cambrai; but the affair, if it existed, was conducted with discretion.

One of her liaisons did have a tragic ending. In 1726 a former lover Charles-Joseph de la Fresnaye committed suicide in her house, and Mme. de Tencin spent some time in the Châtelet and then in the Bastille in consequence, but was soon liberated as the result of a declaration of her innocence by the Grand Conseil.

From this time she devoted herself to political intrigue, especially for the preferment of her brother the abbé Tencin, who became archbishop of Lyon and received a cardinal&#x27;s hat. The nature of her relationship with her brother was a subject of much speculation, but although she never troubled to deny the rumours, there seems to be no evidence that their affection was more than fraternal.

She also was involved with King Louis XV&#x27;s best friend, the Maréchal de Richelieu, over whom she allegedly exercised considerable control. The correspondence between Claudine, her brother and Richelieu shows a deep involvement in the behind-the-scenes intrigues at Louis XV&#x27;s court at Versailles.

Eventually, she formed a literary salon, which had among its habitués Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle, Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu, Charles-Irénée Castel de Saint-Pierre, Pierre de Marivaux, Alexis Piron and others.

Hers was the first of the Parisian literary salons which admitted distinguished foreigners. Among her English guests were Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke and Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield.

== Novels ==

She was a novelist of considerable merit. Her novels have been highly praised for their simplicity and charm, the last qualities the circumstances of the writer&#x27;s life would lead one to expect in her work. The best of them is &quot;Mémoires du comte de Comminge&quot; (1735), which was believed to have been written, as were the other two, by her nephews, MM. d&#x27;Argental and Pont de Veyle, the real authorship being carefully concealed.

Her works, with those of Marie-Madeleine de La Fayette, were edited by Etienne and Jay (Paris, 1825); her novels were reprinted, with introductory matter by Lescure, in 1885; and her correspondence in the &quot;Lettres de Mmes. de Villars, de La Fayette et de Tencin&quot; (Paris, 1805–1832).

<doc id="385817" wikidata="Q1788243" url="?curid=385817" title="The Unknown Soldier (novel)">
<text>The Unknown Soldier (, ) or Unknown Soldiers is a war novel by Finnish author Väinö Linna, considered his magnum opus. Published in 1954, &quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot; chronicles the 1941–1944 Continuation War between Finland and the Soviet Union from the viewpoint of ordinary Finnish soldiers.

In 2000, the manuscript version of the novel was published with the title (&quot;the war novel&quot;) and in 2015, the latest English translation as &quot;Unknown Soldiers&quot;. A fictional account based closely on Linna&#x27;s own experiences during the war, the novel presented a more realistic outlook on the formerly romanticized image of a noble and obedient Finnish soldier. Linna gave his characters independent and critical thoughts, and presented them with human feelings, such as fear and rebellion.

Although published to mixed reviews, &quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot; quickly became one of the best-selling books in Finland and is considered both a classic in Finnish literature and a part of the national legacy. The novel was well received by frontline veterans; it shot Linna to literary fame and has been described as creating a shift in the collective memory of the war. It has sold nearly 800,000 copies, been translated into 20 different languages and adapted into three films with the latest one released in 2017.

== Setting and characters ==
The novel follows soldiers of a Finnish Army machine gun company operating on the Karelian front during the Continuation War from mobilisation in 1941 to the Moscow Armistice in 1944. The company&#x27;s action is based on Infantry Regiment 8 (Finnish: &quot;Jalkaväkirykmentti 8&quot;), the actual unit Väinö Linna served in. The novel has no single central character and both begins and ends with an ironic play on the narrator&#x27;s omniscience. Rather, its focus is on different responses and views on the experience of war from a soldier&#x27;s point of view.

The men of the company come from all over Finland, they have widely varying social backgrounds and political attitudes, and everyone has their own way of coping with the war. The novel paints realistic, yet sympathetic, portraits of a score of very different men: cowards and heroes—the initially naive and eventually brave upper-class idealist Kariluoto; the down-to-earth Koskela; the hardened and cynical working-class grunt Lehto; the company comedian Vanhala; the pragmatic and strong-nerved Antero &quot;Antti&quot; Rokka; the politically indifferent Hietanen, and the communist Lahtinen. Most of the characters are killed in action during the course of the novel. Nevertheless, the general atmosphere of the machine gun company is relaxed and business-like, even childish and jolly, throughout the story, despite the war, losses, death and despair. The soldiers&#x27; continued disrespect for formalities and discipline is a source of frustration for some of the officers.

== Plot ==
The novel starts with the company transferring in June 1941 from their barracks to the Finnish-Soviet border in preparation for the invasion of the Soviet Union. Soon after, the soldiers receive their baptism by fire in an attack over a swamp on Soviet positions. Captain Kaarna is killed during the battle and the stern Lieutenant Lammio takes his place as company commander. Amidst a series of battles, the company assaults a Soviet bunker line on a ridge and stops an armoured attack, the ambushed and abandoned Lehto commits suicide during a regimental flanking maneuver, and the soldiers advance into East Karelia. The company eventually crosses the old border lost during the Winter War and the soldiers ponder the justification for the continued invasion. In October 1941, the company is stationed in the captured and pillaged Petrozavodsk, where the novel follows the soldiers interacting with the locals.

Two men are executed after refusing to follow orders to fend off a Soviet winter attack along the Svir river—during which Lahtinen is killed while trying to carry off his Maxim M/32-33 machine gun and Rokka distinguishes himself by ambushing a 50-strong enemy unit with a Suomi KP/-31 submachine gun. The story moves on to the trench warfare period of the war. The period includes the soldiers drinking kilju (a home-made sugar wine) during Commander-in-Chief Field Marshal Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim&#x27;s birthday celebrations and getting drunk, a new recruit being killed by a sniper for failing to listen to advice from experienced veterans and raising his head above the trench, and Rokka capturing an enemy captain during a nightly Soviet probe into the Finnish trenches.

The final act of the novel describes the defence against the Soviet Vyborg–Petrozavodsk offensive of summer 1944, the withdrawal and counter-attacks of the Finnish Army, and the numerous losses that the company suffers. The company abandons their machine guns in a lake while withdrawing from a hopeless defence, and Lieutenant Colonel Karjula executes the retreating Private Viirilä in a burst of rage while trying to force his men into positions. Koskela is killed while disabling an attacking Soviet tank with a satchel charge and Hietanen is blinded in an artillery strike, while saving a young serviceman from being shot, and later dies when the ambulance evacuating him is attacked. Asumaniemi, an ambitious young private, is the last one to die during the company&#x27;s last counter-attack. The war ends in a ceasefire in September 1944, with the soldiers rising from their foxholes after the final Soviet artillery barrage stops. The survivors listen to the first radio announcements of the eventual Moscow Armistice. The novel&#x27;s last sentence describes the characters of the unit as &quot;[r]ather dear, those boys.&quot;

==Themes==
Väinö Linna wrote in his manuscript cover letter to the publisher WSOY that he wanted &quot;to give the soldiers, who bore the weight of the calamity, all the appreciation and strip war of its glory&quot;. Gritty and realistic, the novel was partly intended to shatter the myth of a noble, obedient Finnish soldier. In Linna&#x27;s own words, he wanted to give the Finnish soldier a brain, an organ he saw lacking in earlier depictions—such as Johan Runeberg&#x27;s &quot;The Tales of Ensign Stål&quot;, where Finnish soldiers are admiringly portrayed with big hearts and little independent intellect. &quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot; is closely based on Linna&#x27;s own experiences as a Finnish Army soldier in Infantry Regiment 8 during the Continuation War with many of its scenes derived from factual events, but is more or less fictional.

The novel has been described as an honest, uncomforting, forlorn, pacifist and critical outlook on the war between the Soviet Union and Finland. &quot;The Herald&quot; described Linna&#x27;s aim as &quot;not to home in on individual plights and agendas but to show the whole great shapeless mass of a platoon, one that is continuously besieged and pared down&quot;. &quot;The Independent&quot; stated that Linna examines nationhood and &quot;the fate of small nations in particular&quot; while the novel&#x27;s &quot;wisest characters come to regard nationality as a matter of chance&quot;. Aku Louhimies, director of the 2017 film adaptation, analysed Linna&#x27;s intentions as follows: &quot;I think [his] original idea was to show the events so that they would also act as a warning.&quot;

==Reception and legacy==
The novel initially received mixed reviews and was not expected to be a commercial success by its publishers, but has since become a revered household classic that Finns are given to read at school. By 2017, it had sold nearly 800,000 units. It launched Väinö Linna into a steady career as a public figure and &quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot; was adapted into different formats for theatre, cinema and radio. Released ten years after the end of the Continuation War, the novel is considered to be the first medium that gave a realistic description of the conflict instead of a polished one. Although the book was criticized, for example, by senior officers of the Finnish Defence Forces as an erroneous account of the war, the book was well received by the masses and frontline veterans who thought it depicted their experiences accurately.

&quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot; and its first film adaptation of 1955 created a shift in the cultural memory of the war. Likewise, the novel is widely believed to have a special cultural status whereby only a limited number of ways to adapt the canon text are considered acceptable. The cover art of a soldier&#x27;s white silhouette against a red background, designed by Martti Mykkänen, became similarly famous and is often used as a symbol for war in Finland. The novel contributed numerous expressions and idioms into Finnish culture and language, with phrases that are popular to the point of some having become clichès. Few remember the exact characterisations from the book, but some phrases are known word for word. Some of the characters even became role models. For example, the disobedient but competent and pragmatic Rokka, or the humane jokester, Hietanen, are described as typical role models, while the calm, fair and composed Koskela is the paragon of every Finnish leader. In conclusion, the novel is considered to be a defining part of the national legacy and identity of Finland. As such, the 1955 film adaptation by Edvin Laine is broadcast on national television every Independence Day and seen by nearly 20% of the Finnish population.

==Editions==

By 2017, the book had been printed in 60 editions in Finland. Its first English translations were published in 1957 by William Collins, Sons and G. P. Putnam&#x27;s Sons in the United Kingdom and the United States, respectively. It has since been translated into 20 other languages. An unedited manuscript version was published in 2000 by WSOY as (&quot;the war novel&quot;)—Linna&#x27;s working title for &quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot;. Penguin Books published a new English translation by Liesl Yamaguchi in 2015 with the idiosyncratic title &quot;Unknown Soldiers&quot; to reflect the lives of young Finnish soldiers in the war.

<text>The International Socialists (IS) is a Canadian socialist organization which is part of the International Socialist Tendency. The IS in Canada publishes &quot;Socialist Worker&quot;, an English-language monthly paper, and holds an annual Marxism conference every spring in Toronto.

==Early history==
The initial members consisted of activists involved in the Movement for an Independent Socialist Canada (better known as the Waffle), which had been forced to leave the social democratic New Democratic Party in 1972. A group of students at York University in Toronto formed a Marxist study group, and came into contact with left-Shachtmanites in the International Socialists (USA), an American group founded by Hal Draper.

After the collapse of the Waffle in late 1974, the group organized itself as the Independent Socialists in February 1975. This reflected the roots of the IS in the Waffle, which had a &quot;left-nationalist&quot; analysis of Canada&#x27;s place in the world economy. But the name was in contradiction to the internationalist approach of the IS, and by 1976, the group voted to rename itself the International Socialists. From 1975, the IS published a monthly paper called &quot;Workers Action&quot;. In 1985, the paper was renamed &quot;Socialist Worker&quot;.

The IS is often identified as the &quot;state-capitalist&quot; group—reflecting the position of the IS that, from 1928 on, Soviet Union was no longer a workers&#x27; state, but state capitalist. This is in contrast to Leon Trotsky&#x27;s position that the Soviet Union was a degenerated workers state. The state capitalist position was not actually central to the group&#x27;s founding in 1975. Several prominent members adhered to the &quot;bureaucratic collectivist&quot; position associated with Max Shachtman, but by the late 1970s, the majority position in the group was clearly &quot;state capitalist&quot;, outlined most clearly in Abbie Bakan&#x27;s pamphlet, &quot;The Great Lie&quot;.

During the 1980s, the group was heavily involved in women&#x27;s struggles, playing an important role in mobilizing support for legal abortion in Canada, largely as a participant in the broader Ontario Coalition for Abortion Clinics. Early in the decade, it was prominent as a defender of the new trade union movement in Poland, Solidarity.

From 1985 to 1986, when the IS was no more than 80 members, a crisis led to the division of the Toronto branch. The Toronto Central branch represented the majority and was led by David McNally. The Toronto East branch represented the minority faction and was led by Abbie Bakan and supported by the Montreal branch. The crisis caused leading members of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) in the UK to write an open letter of concern, urging the unity of the Toronto branch. Some attributed the dispute to personal animosities between leading members. But there was also a tension between a tendency towards propaganda by the majority, and an emphasis on an interventionist perspective by the minority.

A united steering committee slate was put forward and elected at the 1987 convention of the IS, addressed by Alex Callinicos, leading member of the SWP. The two Toronto branches fused into a single branch. That year, for the first time, the IS counted more than 100 members, and continued to grow through the late 1980s and into the early 1990s – intervening into the campaign to defend abortion clinics in Toronto, helping to build the movement against the war in the Gulf, and building in the student movement across the country. It is in this period that the IS also began to flesh out its position on the national question in Quebec, although it was not able to operate to any degree in French in Quebec.

==The 1990s==
The IS grew rapidly in the early 1990s, from 150 to 340 members in 1993–94 alone according to the group&#x27;s claims. Further growth was achieved during the &quot;Days of Action&quot;, a series of one-day general strikes between late 1995 and 1998 against the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party government, led by Premier Mike Harris. During this period of growth, the publication of &quot;Socialist Worker&quot; - the organization&#x27;s paper - became fortnightly rather than monthly.

The unexpected and rapid growth of the group during this period led to a large split in 1996. A section of the organization argued that there were new possibilities for growth in the 1990s, and a more interventionist, activist organization was necessary. Another section of the organization thought that the interventionist perspective was based on an overly-optimistic analysis of the period, and were loath to move too far away from a propagandist, educational orientation. The section arguing for a more interventionist line carried the day at the November 1994 convention, &quot;Socialist Worker&quot; began appearing bi-weekly in January 1995, and the organization began publishing a monthly French paper. One year later, several leading members (including David McNally) resigned, and a faction emerged called the Political Reorientation Faction (PRF). The PRF produced a document rejecting the International Socialist Tendency&#x27;s analysis of an upswing in class struggle during the mid-1990s, (&quot;the 1990s is the 1930s in slow motion&quot;) and the Leninist conception of the party. Within weeks, members of the PRF (with one exception) left the IS to form the New Socialist Group prompting criticism from the IS majority for quitting rather than engaging in a proper political debate. The departing minority, however, argued that their position in the IS had become untenable and that their right to debate and organize were not tolerated by the majority.

==21st century==
The membership of the IS fell, and the publication frequency of &quot;Socialist Worker&quot; was reduced from every two weeks to monthly. It is now printed in full colour. Its French-language periodical, &quot;Résistance!&quot;, has ceased publication, and its annual theoretical journal, &quot;Marxism,&quot; has remained on hiatus. The IS has begun publishing a monthly campus newsletter called &quot;the Agitator.&quot; The IS annual Marxism conference is also smaller; where the main event of the conference would draw as many as 500 attendees at the group&#x27;s height, now the turnout is less than 100 per year.

The IS played a role in helping launch the movement against the war on Iraq, and is active in the War Resisters Support Campaign. It has several branches in Toronto as well as in Ottawa, Hamilton, Vancouver and members in several other cities. It was involved in the fight against Toronto Mayor Rob Ford, Occupy Toronto, and in the abortion rights, trade union, and student movements. Members of the IS in Toronto have been heavily involved in starting the Toronto Disability Pride March, which has taken place annually since 2011. 
On March 20, 2013, founding member Abbie Bakan, former &quot;Socialist Worker&quot; editor Paul Kellogg, and a few other members released a public statement announcing their resignation from the IS after a motion to write a public a letter of concern to the British SWP over its handling of rape allegations against one of its leaders was voted down at their annual convention. The IS Steering Committee responded that the resignation letter distorted &quot;the democratic discussion and decisions at our Convention,&quot; noting that the IS &quot;took very seriously the allegation of rape and the other issues raised by the crisis in the SWP and the discussion focused on whether an open letter intervening in the internal crisis of another organization would help the membership resolve their own dispute in a positive way. After discussing it, a majority at our Convention determined not to intervene and to allow the comrades in the SWP the space to debate the way forward through their own structures and processes.&quot;

==Student component==

Since the mid-1980s when the group took a political turn towards the student movement, much of the IS&#x27;s work occurs on university campuses and most of its members are either university students or joined while in university. It was once quite active at the University of Toronto, where one member became president of the Student Administrative Council as part of a broader left wing slate. In recent years, they have been most active at York University in Toronto and Langara College in Vancouver.

In November 2012, IS members initiated a campaign against the local men&#x27;s rights club at the University of Toronto, bringing together a coalition of students called UofT Students Against Sexism in order to protest a lecture given by controversial men&#x27;s rights activist Warren Farrell. The protest drew around 100 people, and sparked a larger debate on campus around the existence of men&#x27;s rights clubs.

==Political stances==
Unlike much of the mainstream left in Canada, the International Socialists oppose Left Nationalism which argues that Canada is a colony or dependency of the United States. The IS maintains that Canada is a leading capitalist country with an independent ruling class that carries out its own acts of imperialism. At the same time, members of the IS, including members of its steering committee, were also members of the left nationalist Council of Canadians as recently as 2002.

The group supports international socialism and Québécois and First Nations struggles for self-determination, up to and including independence. In Quebec, the IS does not, however, support the separatist Parti Québécois, which they see as a bourgeois nationalist party. The IS is involved in Québec Solidaire, a merger of the Union des Forces Progressistes and the Option Citoyenne.

The International Socialists argue for &quot;critical support&quot; of the New Democratic Party (NDP) on the federal and provincial levels, since the NDP, despite its flaws, is the party of the working class in Canada, and a victory for the NDP gives confidence to working class activists and those in the social movements to fight for reforms. Once the NDP is elected, IS members see the opportunity to expose the inability of social democrats to effect real change. IS members may occasionally work alongside NDP activists on certain campaigns despite the fact that IS members generally do not join the NDP. For example, In 2003, members of the IS worked on Joe Comartin&#x27;s NDP leadership campaign.

==Criticism==

IS members have been criticized by other far-Left groups, including those who situate their roots within the broader International Socialist Tendency. The IS has been criticized for its role in the peace movement in Toronto where it has an influential position in the Toronto Coalition to Stop the War (TCSW). The June 30th Committee, an independent Toronto anti-war group, argues that TCSW was decisively influenced by the IS to sabotage their demonstration on June 30, 2004. It did so by calling a demonstration for the same time and location as the J30 demonstration and then proceeded to split the demonstration. One account can be found Toronto&#x27;s &quot;Now Magazine&quot;. TCSW and IS members dispute this account. Other detractors argue that the IS did the same thing again for an emergency rally in November 2004 called by the Ontario Coalition Against Poverty.

The IS has also been criticized for its alleged role in undermining an anti-racist demonstration in Ottawa in May 1993. Strong criticisms of the IS were made in the second edition of Warren Kinsella&#x27;s book &quot;Web of Hate&quot; and in the anarchist magazine &quot;Arm the Spirit&quot;.

<text>The skunk ape is a large and hairy human-like mythical creature purported to inhabit the forests and swamps in the southeastern United States, most notably in Florida. It is often compared to, synonymous with, or called the &quot;cousin&quot; of Bigfoot, a prominent subject within North American popular culture.

Many dubious articles have been presented in an attempt to prove the skunk ape&#x27;s existence, including anecdotal sightings, disputed photographs, audio and video recordings, and casts of large footprints. The majority of mainstream scientists have historically discounted the existence of the skunk ape, considering it to be the result of a combination of folklore, misidentification, and hoax, rather than a living animal. The skunk ape has entered the popular culture of the southern United States, especially in Florida.

==Description==
The skunk ape is commonly described as a bipedal human or ape-like creature, approximately tall, and covered in mottled reddish-brown hair. The skunk ape is often reported to be smaller in stature compared to traditional descriptions of Bigfoot from the northern United States and Canada. It is named for its foul odor, often described as being similar to that of a skunk.

==History==
Contemporary descriptions of the skunk ape in Florida, Georgia, and Alabama folklore have occurred since European settlers first occupied the region. In 1818, local newspapers reported a story from what is now Apalachicola, Florida, that spoke of a &quot;man-sized monkey&quot; raiding food stores and stalking fishermen along the shore. Cryptozoologists have made unsubstantiated claims that Seminole and Miccosukee culture includes stories of a foul-smelling, physically powerful, and secretive creature called Esti Capcaki, a name which roughly translates to &quot;Furry Tall Man&quot; or &quot;Hairy Giant&quot;.

==Notable alleged sightings==
In 1929, an alleged sighting occurred at the famous and then recently constructed Perky Bat Tower at the Florida Keys. Witnesses reported that an unknown ape-like creature was drawn to the construction site. After inspecting the bat tower shortly after it had been stocked with bats, the creature shook the tower, driving off the bats before running off into the woods.

In 1942, a man in Suwanee County reported a similar creature rushing out from the brush line while he was driving down an isolated road. It was alleged to have grabbed onto his vehicle and beat on the running board and door for half a mile before departing. In the small community of Bardin, in Putnam County, Florida, beginning in the 1940s, there were a number of alleged sightings of a creature that came to be known as the Bardin Booger. In the 1960s, a rash of sightings in central Florida happened around Alachua County and Marion County. One such report from 1963 involved several members of a family encountering an ape-like creature around their rural home, including one instance of it approaching a window to peer inside at night. 

Reports of the skunk ape were particularly common in the 1950s through the 1970s. The &quot;Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization&quot; has archived hundreds of alleged sightings across almost every county of Florida, beginning in 1955 into the present day.

In the 1970s, two Palm Beach County sheriff&#x27;s deputies named Marvin Lewis and Ernie Milner reported that an ape-like creature stalked them through a grove before they shot at it with their firearms. They reported following a trail of footprints where they recovered hair snagged on a barbed wire fence line that had been pushed down. In 1971 to 1975, a rash of sightings occurred in Broward County and surrounding areas. Multiple eyewitnesses reported nocturnal encounters with a 5 to 7 foot (1.5–2.1 meter) ape-like creature with dark red to black fur. These events were heavily covered in newspapers, both local and in other Florida cities such as Miami, and were some of the earliest instances popularizing the term &quot;Skunk Ape&quot; in the state lexicon. Reports alleged that the skunk ape had invaded homes, stalked people, and killed several of a farmer&#x27;s livestock including a horse and a bull. The local police department investigated after one law enforcement officer reported striking the skunk ape with his car. Posses were formed in an effort to locate the alleged creature, but no body or evidence was found.

In 1977, a failed-to-pass bill was proposed to the Florida state legislature to make it illegal to &quot;take, possess, harm or molest anthropoids or humanoid animals&quot;.

Several Everglades wildlife tour bus operators and their guests have reported alleged sightings. In July 1997, one such operator, David Shealy, reported wildlife bait stands laden with lima bean had been raided and he noticed strange tracks surrounding them. He baited several locations with more lima beans and multiple witnesses reported skunk ape sightings soon after. Shealy and others attributed this instance to high seasonal flooding having driven numerous animals into tighter ranges around higher ground. One such sighting was by Everglades tour operators Steve Goodbread and Dow Rowland; some of their guests reported skunk ape sightings as well. Both operators claimed that weather, high humidity, and the rural location would make a hoax unlikely.

In 1997, a photograph of a dark upright figure in the swamp was taken by Ochopee Fire Control District Chief Vince Doerr that he claims depicts a skunk ape. He reported observing the creature cross the road, and stopped his car to capture a photograph. Within two weeks, over fifty people reported alleged sightings of a hairy creature within the Big Cypress National Preserve.

In the year 2000, the Sarasota County Sheriff&#x27;s Office received two anonymous photos depicting a large, hairy, ape-like creature. The author of the letter claimed to be an elderly woman who reported the creature had been stealing apples from her back porch near I-75, and upon surprising it with a camera she was afraid it was an escaped orangutan that might harm her family. The scrutinized photos, dubbed the &quot;Myakka skunk ape,&quot; remain a polarizing topic and their authenticity remains debated. One critique highlighting the photographs as a potential hoax is the subject&#x27;s resemblance to a Bigfoot statue known from a &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!&quot; museum. However, the position, expression, and posture of the creature changes in both photos adding doubts to it being a hoax.

Sightings continue to the present day, with forty-eight out of sixty-seven counties in Florida reporting sightings since 2010.

==Proposed explanations==
Most anecdotal reports and alleged visual evidence are deemed to be fabrication or hoaxes. Skeptical investigator Joe Nickell has written that some of the reports may represent sightings of the Florida black bear, possibly some suffering from mange, and it is likely that other sightings are hoaxes or general misidentification of wildlife. The United States National Park Service considers the skunk ape to be a hoax.

==In popular culture==
The skunk ape has been widely adopted across Florida as an unofficial mascot for wilderness and rural culture, including appearing in roadside businesses and attractions, television commercials, and on signs. During the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Orlando&#x27;s Gatorland park used the skunk ape&#x27;s reported foul smell to promote social distancing.

The skunk ape is often the subject of conferences that host guest speakers, research presentations, trail running events, and vendors.

<doc id="385822" wikidata="Q5263263" url="?curid=385822" title="Dershowitz–Finkelstein affair">
<text>The Dershowitz–Finkelstein affair was a public controversy involving academics Alan Dershowitz and Norman Finkelstein and their scholarship on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict in 2005.

Shortly after the publication of &quot;The Case for Israel&quot; (2003) by Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz, Norman Finkelstein alleged that it was &quot;a collection of fraud, falsification, plagiarism and nonsense.&quot; Finkelstein further derided the book, remarking, &quot;If Dershowitz&#x27;s book were made of cloth, I wouldn&#x27;t even use it as a  ... his book is such garbage.&quot; Finkelstein charged that Dershowitz had engaged in plagiarism in his use of Joan Peters&#x27; book &quot;From Time Immemorial&quot;. Dershowitz denied the charges. Former Harvard president Derek Bok, following a review requested by then-Harvard Law School Dean Elena Kagan, stated that no plagiarism had occurred.

In &quot;Beyond Chutzpah: On the Misuse of Anti-Semitism and the Abuse of History&quot;, published by University of California Press on August 28, 2005, Finkelstein aimed to debunk &quot;The Case for Israel&quot;. Dershowitz had written letters to both The New Press and to the University of California Press to prevent its publication, claiming it contained massive libel and stating that the book should not be published. Dershowitz responded in his book &quot;The Case for Peace&quot; and alleged a campaign of vilification by Finkelstein against several pro-Israel academics.

==Finkelstein&#x27;s criticisms of Dershowitz==

The book &quot;Beyond Chutzpah&quot; is a critique of arguments used to defend Israel&#x27;s stance in the Israel-Palestine conflict, including the use of the allegation of anti-semitism to deflect criticism of Israel. A major theme of the book is a comparison of Alan Dershowitz&#x27;s earlier book, &quot;The Case for Israel&quot;, with the findings of mainstream human rights organisations, such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International. Finkelstein wrote that Dershowitz had lied, misrepresented and fabricated many of his points in order to protect Israel and hide its record of alleged human rights violations, while &quot;the real issue is Israel&#x27;s human rights record&quot;.

In addition, Finkelstein wrote that he had found plagiarism where Dershowitz reproduced the exact errors found in Peters&#x27;s citation of original sources. He said this was evidence that Dershowitz did not check the original sources he cited, a claim that Dershowitz adamantly denied.

Finkelstein said he had located twenty instances within as many pages, in which Dershowitz used some of the same words from the same sources that Joan Peters had used, largely in the same order. In several paragraph-long quotations, the two books have ellipses in the same positions. Finkelstein wrote that, in one instance, Dershowitz refers to the same page number as Peters, although he is citing a different edition of the same source, in which the words appear on a different page. Finkelstein stated: &quot;It is left to readers to decide whether Dershowitz committed plagiarism as defined by Harvard University—&#x27;passing off a source&#x27;s information, ideas, or words as your own by omitting to cite them.&#x27; According to a book review of &quot;Beyond Chutzpah&quot;, written by Professor Michael C. Desch in &quot;The American Conservative&quot;, &quot;Finkelstein does not accuse Dershowitz of the wholesale lifting of someone else&#x27;s words, but he does make a very strong case that Dershowitz has violated the spirit, if not the exact letter, of Harvard&#x27;s prohibitions of the first three forms of plagiarism.&quot;

During an interview of the two men by Amy Goodman on &quot;Democracy Now!&quot;, Finkelstein also said that Dershowitz may not have written, or even read, the book.

Dershowitz took a number of steps to stop publication of &quot;Beyond Chutzpah&quot;. His lawyers wrote letters to the University of California Press threatening a lawsuit if it published the book. Dershowitz also wrote to the Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, asking him to stop the book from being published. Schwarzenegger responded that &quot;he is not inclined to otherwise exert influence in this case because of the clear, academic freedom issue it presents&quot;. According to Jon Weiner, writing in &quot;The Nation&quot;, Dershowitz&#x27; lawyers contacted the president of the University of California, the university provost, seventeen directors of the university press and nineteen members of the university press’s faculty editorial committee to attempt to stop the publication of the book.

==Dershowitz&#x27;s response==

Dershowitz threatened to bring a legal action against the University of California Press in response to the charges in Finkelstein&#x27;s book. Dershowitz claimed to have written every word of &quot;The Case for Israel&quot; by hand and to have sent the University of California Press his handwritten manuscript. He says there is not a single phrase or sentence in it that was plagiarized, and accused Finkelstein of knowing this and making the charges in order to garner publicity. Dershowitz offered to produce his handwritten drafts (he does not type) to debunk the claim that &quot;The Case for Israel&quot; was ghostwritten and claimed Finkelstein has not asked to see them.

Dershowitz also asked California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to intervene in order to prevent the University of California Press from publishing the book. Schwarzenegger&#x27;s legal advisor responded, however, that the governor would not intervene in issues of academic freedom.

As a result, when &quot;Beyond Chutzpah&quot; was published, it no longer used the word &quot;plagiarize&quot; in its argument that Dershowitz inappropriately borrowed from another work, nor did it include the claim that Dershowitz did not write &quot;The Case for Israel&quot;, because, the publisher said, &quot;[Finkelstein] couldn&#x27;t document that.&quot; &quot;Dershowitz has said he cited sources properly, attempting to check all primary sources and citing Peters when she was his only source.&quot;

Dershowitz said that Finkelstein has invented false charges in order to discredit supporters of Israel: &quot;The mode of attack is consistent. Chomsky selects the target and directs Finkelstein to probe the writings in minute detail and conclude that the writer didn&#x27;t actually write the work, that it is plagiarized, that it is a hoax and a fraud,&quot; alleging that Finkelstein has leveled the same kind of charges against many others, calling at least 10 &quot;distinguished Jews &#x27;hucksters,&#x27; &#x27;hoaxters,&#x27; &#x27;thieves,&#x27; &#x27;extortionists,&#x27; and worse.&quot;

Dershowitz&#x27;s subsequent book on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, &quot;The Case for Peace&quot;, contains a chapter rebutting Finkelstein&#x27;s charges, which Dershowitz made available on his web site.

==Additional responses by Finkelstein and Dershowitz==

Finkelstein argued in a letter to &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot; published on October 3, 2003, that Dershowitz reproduced exactly two of Peters&#x27; mistakes, and made one relevant mistake of his own. In quoting Mark Twain, Finkelstein argued, &quot;Dershowitz cites two paragraphs from Twain as continuous text, just as Peters cites them as continuous text, but in Twain&#x27;s book the two paragraphs are separated by 87 pages.&quot; While still quoting Twain, although Dershowitz cited a different edition of Twain&#x27;s &quot;Innocents Abroad&quot; than Joan Peters cites, Finkelstein continues, &quot;the relevant quotes do not appear on these pages in the edition of Twain&#x27;s book that Dershowitz cites.&quot; Finkelstein points out that these quotations do, however, appear on the pages that Joan Peters cites as her edition of &quot;Innocents Abroad&quot;. Finkelstein asserted: &quot;Quoting a statement depicting the miserable fate of Jews in mid-19th century Jerusalem, Peters cites a British consular letter from &#x27;Wm. T. Young to Viscount Canning.&#x27; Dershowitz cites the same statement as Peters, reporting that Young &#x27;attributed the plight of the Jew in Jerusalem&#x27; to pervasive anti-Semitism. Turning to the original, however, we find that the relevant statement did not come from Young but, as is unmistakably clear to anyone who actually consulted the original, from an enclosed memorandum written by an &#x27;A. Benisch&#x27; that Young was forwarding to Canning.&quot; He concluded: &quot;It would be impossible for anyone who checked the original source[s] to make the[se] error[s].&quot;

In response to the general charge of plagiarism, Dershowitz had characterized the excerpts as quotations that historians and scholars of the region cite routinely, such as Mark Twain and the reports of government commissions.

In &quot;Statement of Alan M. Dershowitz&quot; featured on a faculty webpage at Harvard Law School,
Dershowitz writes:
I will no longer participate in this transparent ploy to gather media attention for Finkelstein and his publisher. I answer all of his charges fully in Chapter 16 of my forthcoming book &quot;The Case For Peace&quot;, to be published by Wiley in August. My book deals with important and current issues, such as the prospects for peace in the immediate future. Finkelstein&#x27;s deals with the irrelevant past that both Israelis and Palestinians are trying to put behind them. Let the marketplace judge our books. As far as I&#x27;m concerned, the public controversy is over and I will comment no further on the false charges leveled by Finkelstein and the UCP. Let them henceforth pay for their own publicity, instead of trying to get it on the cheap by launching phony attacks against me.

I will not debate Finkelstein. I have a longstanding policy against debating Holocaust deniers, revisionists, trivializers or minimizers. Nor is a serious debate about Israel possible with someone who acknowledges that he knows &quot;very little&quot; about that country. I will be happy to debate any legitimate experts from Amnesty International or any other human rights organization. Indeed, I have a debate scheduled with Noam Chomsky about these issues in the fall [2005].

Dershowitz strenuously denied that he did not credit Peters&#x27; book adequately in his own book, and Harvard University supported him in that position in exonerating him against Finkelstein&#x27;s charges that he committed &quot;plagiarism&quot;.

==$10,000 challenge==

During the joint interview of Dershowitz and Finkelstein in a 2003 &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; broadcast, host Amy Goodman alluded to an appearance on MSNBC&#x27;s &quot;Scarborough Country&quot; in which Dershowitz made a challenge to &quot;give $10,000 to the PLO&quot; (Palestine Liberation Organization), playing a clip from the other program. In the headnote to the transcript, Goodman wrote:

On MSNBC&#x27;s Scarborough Country on September 8, 2003, renowned appellate lawyer, Harvard Law professor and author Alan Dershowitz says: &quot;I will give $10,000 to the PLO... if you can find a historical fact in my book that you can prove to be false.&quot; The book Dershowitz refers to is his latest work &quot;The Case For Israel&quot;.
Today author and professor Norman Finkelstein takes him on and charges that Dershowitz makes numerous factual errors in his book. Dershowitz denies the charges. Finkelstein teaches at DePaul University and is the author of four books including &quot;The Holocaust Industry: Reflections on the Exploitation of Jewish Suffering&quot;.

The segment of &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; appears in the included transcript of the program:

Amy Goodman: ...we were intrigued on watching &quot;Scarborough Country&quot; when you debated, the offer that you made [...] just play it for a moment.

Alan Dershowitz: Tell you what, I will give $10,000 to the P.L.O. in your name if you can find historical fact in my book that you can prove to be false. I issue that challenge, I issue it to you, I issue it to the Palestinian Authority, I issue it to Noam Chomsky to Edward Said, every word in my book is accurate and you can&#x27;t just simply say it&#x27;s false without documenting it. Tell me one thing in the book now that is false?

Amy Goodman: Okay. Let&#x27;s go to the book. The Case for Israel $10,000.

On &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; Finkelstein replied to that specific challenge for material errors found in his book overall, and Dershowitz upped it to $25,000 for another particular &quot;issue&quot; that they disputed.

Finkelstein referred to &quot;concrete facts which are not particularly controversial,&quot; stating that in &quot;The Case for Israel&quot; Dershowitz attributes to Israeli historian Benny Morris the figure of between 2,000 and 3,000 Palestinian Arabs who fled their homes from April to June 1948, when the range in the figures presented by Morris is actually 200,000 to 300,000.

Dershowitz responded to Finkelstein&#x27;s reply by stating that such a mistake could not have been intentional, as it harmed his own side of the debate: &quot;Obviously, the phrase &#x27;2,000 to 3,000 Arabs&#x27; refers either to a sub-phase [of the flight] or is a typographical error.&quot; In this particular context, Dershowitz&#x27;s argument is that Palestinians left as a result of orders issued by Palestinian commanders: &quot;If in fact, 200,000 were told to leave instead of 2,000, that strengthens my argument considerably.&quot;

==Others on the plagiarism controversy==

===Support for Finkelstein===

In his review of &quot;Beyond Chutzpah&quot;, echoing Finkelstein&#x27;s criticisms, Michael Desch, political science professor at University of Notre Dame observed:

Not only did Dershowitz improperly present Peters&#x27;s ideas, he may not even have bothered to read the original sources she used to come up with them. Finkelstein somehow managed to get uncorrected page proofs of &quot;The Case for Israel&quot; in which Dershowitz appears to direct his research assistant to go to certain pages and notes in Peters&#x27;s book and place them in his footnotes directly (32, col. 3).

Oxford academic Avi Shlaim had also been critical of Dershowitz, saying he believed that the charge of plagiarism &quot;is proved in a manner that would stand up in court.&quot;

In Desch&#x27;s review of &quot;Beyond Chutzpah&quot;, summarizing Finkelstein&#x27;s case against Dershowitz for &quot;torturing the evidence,&quot; particularly Finkelstein&#x27;s argument relating to Dershowitz&#x27;s citations of Morris, Desch observed:
There are two problems with Dershowitz&#x27;s heavy reliance on Morris. The first is that Morris is hardly the left-wing peacenik that Dershowitz makes him out to be, which means that calling him as a witness in Israel&#x27;s defense is not very helpful to the case. The more important problem is that many of the points Dershowitz cites Morris as supporting—that the early Zionists wanted peaceful coexistence with the Arabs, that the Arabs began the 1948 War to destroy Israel, that the Arabs were guilty of many massacres while the Israelis were scrupulous about protecting human rights, and that the Arabs fled at the behest of their leaders rather than being ethnically cleansed by the Israel Defense Forces—turn out to be based on a partial reading or misreading of Morris&#x27;s books. Finkelstein documents these charges in exhaustive detail in Appendix II of his book and the preponderance of evidence he provides is conclusive.&quot; (30–31)

===Support for Dershowitz===
As Desch acknowledges in his book review of &quot;Beyond Chutzpah&quot;, &quot;In the wake of a number of similar complaints against Dershowitz and two of his Harvard Law School colleagues Laurence Tribe and Charles Ogletree, former Harvard President Derek Bok conducted an investigation—the details of which were not made public—that... vindicated Dershowitz&quot; (32, col. 3).

==Dershowitz&#x27;s involvement in Finkelstein&#x27;s denial of tenure==

In September 2006, Alan Dershowitz sent members of DePaul University&#x27;s law and political science faculties what he described as &quot;a dossier of Norman Finkelstein&#x27;s most egregious academic sins, and especially his outright lies, misquotations, and distortions that... are not incidental to Finkelstein&#x27;s purported scholarship; they are Finkelstein&#x27;s purported scholarship,&quot; and he lobbied professors, alumni and administrators to deny Finkelstein tenure. DePaul&#x27;s political science committee investigated the accusations against Finkelstein and concluded that they were not based on legitimate criticism. The department subsequently invited John Mearsheimer and Ian Lustick, two uninvolved academics with expertise on the Israel/Palestine conflict, to evaluate the academic merit of Finkelstein&#x27;s work. Mearsheimer and Lustick came to the same conclusion. In April 2007 the De Paul University Liberal Arts and Sciences&#x27; Faculty Governance Council had voted unanimously to send a letter to Harvard University expressing &quot;the council&#x27;s dismay at Professor Dershowitz&#x27;s interference in Finkelstein&#x27;s tenure and promotion case.&quot;

In early 2007, the DePaul University Political Science department voted 9 to 3, and the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences Personnel Committee 5 to 0, in favor of giving Finkelstein tenure. The three opposing faculty members subsequently filed a minority report opposing tenure, supported by the Dean of the College, Chuck Suchar. Suchar stated he opposed tenure because Finkelstein&#x27;s &quot;personal and reputation demeaning attacks on Alan Dershowitz, Benny Morris, and the holocaust authors Eli Wiesel and Jerzy Kosinski&quot; were inconsistent with DePaul&#x27;s &quot;Vincentian&quot; values. In June 2007 a 4–3 vote by DePaul University&#x27;s Board on Promotion and Tenure (a faculty board), affirmed by the university&#x27;s president, the Rev. Dennis Holtschneider, denied Finkelstein tenure. Finkelstein was placed on administrative leave for the 2007–2008 academic year (the remainder of his contract with DePaul), his sole course having been cancelled. However, in announcing his decision, Holtschneider said the outside attention &quot;was unwelcome and inappropriate and had no impact on either the process or the outcome of this case.&quot; On September 5, 2007, Finkelstein resigned after he and the university reached a settlement; they released a joint statement on the resolution of the conflict.

==Additional points of dispute between Finkelstein and Dershowitz==

In &quot;The Holocaust Industry&quot;, Finkelstein questioned Elie Wiesel&#x27;s claim to have read Immanuel Kant&#x27;s &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; in Yiddish. According to Finkelstein, no translation of the work existed in Yiddish at the time. Dershowitz responded that this was not so: he alleged that one had been published in Warsaw in 1929, and said that he had seen a copy at the Harvard Library. Finkelstein described this latter claim as false and inept, writing that the only work by Kant in Yiddish owned by the library was a partial translation of the &quot;Critique of Practical Reason&quot;, a completely different work than the one referred to by Wiesel and Dershowitz.

During a clash with members of J Street at the 2010 American Israel Public Affairs Committee conference, Dershowitz chastised J Street for pandering to anti-Israel activists and asked, &quot;Why are you so popular with Norman Finkelstein?&quot; J Street rebuffed Dershowitz&#x27;s claim.

<text>Sylvain Chomet (; born 10 November 1963) is a French comic writer, animator and film director.

== Early career ==
Born in Maisons-Laffitte, Seine-et-Oise (now Yvelines), near Paris, he studied art at high school until he graduated in 1982. Chomet moved to London in 1988 to work as an animator at the Richard Purdum studio. In September of that year, he established a freelance practice, working on commercials for clients such as Principality, Renault, Swinton and Swissair.

In addition to his animation career, Chomet has created many print comics, starting in 1986 with &quot;Secrets of the Dragonfly.&quot; In 1992 Chomet wrote the script for a science fiction comic called &quot;The Bridge in Mud&quot;. 1993 saw Chomet writing the story for &quot;Léon-la-Came&quot;, which was drawn by Nicolas de Crécy for &quot;À Suivre&quot; magazine. This was published in 1995 and won the René Goscinny Prize in 1996. In 1997, Chomet published &quot;Ugly, Poor, and Sick&quot;, again with de Crécy. This won them the Alph-Art Best Comic Prize at the Angoulême Comics Festival.

== Film career ==
In 1991, Chomet started work on his first animated film, &quot;The Old Lady and the Pigeons&quot;, with backgrounds designed by Nicolas de Crécy. The short film won him a BAFTA, the Grand Prize at the 1997 Annecy International Animated Film Festival, the Cartoon d&#x27;or prize, as well as the Audience Prize and Jury Prize at the Angers Premiers Plans Festival. It also received a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film.

Chomet&#x27;s first feature-length animated film, &quot;The Triplets of Belleville&quot; was also nominated for two Oscars in 2003 (Best Animated Feature and Best Song), and introduced Chomet&#x27;s name to a much wider audience. Upon the film&#x27;s release, de Crécy accused Chomet of plagiarizing his work, citing it as the reason for the dissolution of their collaboration. The visual style of &quot;The Triplets of Belleville&quot; closely resembles the earlier work of de Crécy&#x27;s 1994 graphic novel &quot;Le Bibendum Céleste&quot;.

In 2004, Chomet founded Django Films, an animation studio based in Edinburgh, Scotland. The studio was set up with the ambition of establishing itself in both animation and live-action filmmaking, but has since been dismantled due to several production difficulties, first losing funding for what was to be the studio&#x27;s first animated feature, &quot;Barbacoa&quot;, to have been directed by Chomet. Another major setback was the studio&#x27;s failure to secure funding for &quot;The Clan&quot;, an animated sitcom for BBC.

In 2006, he directed a segment for the collaborative film &quot;Paris, je t&#x27;aime&quot;; he was assigned the 7th arrondissement of Paris segment &quot;Tour Eiffel&quot;. It was Chomet&#x27;s first work in live action.

After many delays, Chomet directed &quot;The Illusionist&quot;, which premiered at the 60th Berlin International Film Festival in February 2010. The film was based on an unproduced script that Jacques Tati had written in 1956 as a personal letter to his estranged eldest daughter and stars an animated version of Tati himself. It was originally conceived by Tati as a journey of love and discovery that takes two characters across Western Europe to Prague. Chomet says that &quot;Tati wanted to move from purely visual comedy and try an emotionally deeper story&quot; and states that &quot;It&#x27;s not a romance, it&#x27;s more the relationship between a dad and a daughter&quot;. The film cost an estimated $17 million to make, and was funded by Pathé Pictures.

Filming on Chomet&#x27;s live action romantic musical-comedy &quot;Attila Marcel&quot; took place in Paris from mid-July 2012 and lasted 46 days. It premiered in the Special Presentation section at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival, and was released theatrically in France by Pathé in October that year.

In 2014, a couch gag directed and composed by Chomet aired for &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Diggs&quot;. It depicts the family running to the couch until the lights go off. Marge leaves to fix the fuse, and when the lights go up, the characters are drawn &quot;Triplets of Belleville&quot;-style and everything has a French aesthetic to it. Bart plays with a do-it-yourself foie gras kit, Lisa plays an accordion, Marge cries out, &quot;Maggie? Où est Maggie?&quot; and Homer gets up and eats a snail off the TV, oblivious that Maggie is stuck between his butt cheeks.

In 2015, Chomet directed and co-wrote the animated music video &quot;Carmen&quot; for Belgian musician Stromae.

In 2016, Chomet directed the short film &quot;Merci Monsieur Imada&quot;. Later that year, Chomet produced the illustrations for &quot;Caleb&#x27;s Cab&quot;, a children&#x27;s book written by his wife, Sally.

In June 2021, it was announced that Chomet would direct a Marcel Pagnol biopic, &quot;The Magnificent Life of Marcel Pagnol&quot;.

== Unrealized and upcoming projects ==
In 2004, Chomet announced plans to direct &quot;Barbacoa&quot;, a film about a group of escaped zoo animals set during the 1871 Paris Commune produced by Django Films. Originally stated to be released in late 2005, the film was canceled because of lack of funding. Another production, an unnamed 3D project in collaboration with Miramax division Dimension Films, was also announced.

In 2006, Django Films was reported to be producing &quot;The Clan&quot;, an animated sitcom pilot for BBC to be directed by Chomet. The show, described as &quot;manic&quot; and &quot;surreal&quot;, was to have focused on the lives of the dysfunctional inhabitants of a fictional Scottish island, and was labeled &quot;a Scottish &quot;Simpsons&quot;&quot;.

In the mid-2000s, Chomet was hired to direct &quot;The Tale of Despereaux&quot;. The film&#x27;s production was marred by disagreements and malpractice, or accusations thereof, between the French, British and North American staff involved. Chomet came up against creative and ethical differences with the producers and was eventually fired from the project and thrown out of the studio space allocated to the film. The film was ultimately directed by Sam Fell and Rob Stevenhagen.

In 2012, Chomet was in the early stages of working on a prequel to &quot;The Triplets of Belleville&quot; entitled &quot;Swing Poppa Swing&quot; to focus on the early lives of the elderly singing triplets from the first film.

In 2014, Chomet announced plans to direct &quot;The Thousand Miles&quot;, a mix of live-action and animation based on various works of Federico Fellini, including his &quot;unpublished drawings and writings&quot;, with a screenplay by Tommaso Rossellini and Demian Gregory. Work was later developed to include producer credit from Emanuele Filiberto of Savoy. On January 5, 2016, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Chomet was moving forward with the film after a lengthy development process, and was expected for a 2017 release. Since then, there has been no news.

In March 2018, it was reported that Chomet would direct an animated adaptation of Hwang Sok-yong&#x27;s novel &quot;Familiar Things&quot;. Chomet was inspired to adapt the novel after becoming interested in Korean culture particularly after seeing the films of Park Chan-wook.

<text>The Socialist Workers Organization was a Trotskyist organisation based in New Zealand. It was part of the International Socialist Tendency, the British Socialist Workers Party&#x27;s international tendency.

The Socialist Workers Organization was established by the merger of the Communist Party of New Zealand and the International Socialist Organisation in 1994. The former was the direct linear organisational continuation of the old Communist Party that had been founded as a part of the Communist International. Unlike most such official Communist parties that of New Zealand had aligned itself with Beijing after China and the Soviet Union fell out in 1961. Later still the CPNZ aligned itself with Albania.

The latter group, the ISO, had been formed by a small group who had been recruited to the politics of the International Socialism Tradition while living in Australia and had decided to form their own organisation based on those politics. It came as a shock to them then when they found that the leadership of the SWP (Britain) had entered into discussions with the CPNZ and they only reluctantly fused into the new Socialist Workers Organisation at the behest of the SWP who sent an emissary to New Zealand to further the fusion.

After a period of working together the core of the former ISO felt that the SWO was dominated by elements who had not broken from Stalinist organisational practices and politics and split to refound the International Socialist Organisation. The new ISO is active in Dunedin and Wellington. The SWO evolved into Socialist Worker (Aotearoa) active in Auckland and Wellington, but was dissolved in 2012.

<doc id="385839" wikidata="Q2142196" url="?curid=385839" title="Trooping the Colour">
<text>Trooping the Colour is a ceremonial event performed every year on Horse Guards Parade in London, United Kingdom, by regiments of Household Division, to celebrate the official birthday of the British sovereign. It is also known as the Sovereign&#x27;s Birthday Parade. Similar events are held in other countries of the Commonwealth. In the UK, it is, with the State Opening of Parliament, the biggest event of the ceremonial calendar, and watched by millions on TV and on the streets of London.

Historically, colours were once used on the battlefield as a rallying point. They display the battle honours of a regiment and are a focal point of Trooping the Colour. The ceremony has marked the sovereign&#x27;s official birthday since 1748. Each year, one of the five Foot Guards regiments of the Household Division is selected to slowly troop (carry) its colour through the ranks of guards, who stand with arms presented. During the slow march-past, the colours are lowered before the monarch and during the quick march-past the colours fly. The monarch will salute the colours in return.

During the ceremony, the monarch processes down the Mall from Buckingham Palace to Horse Guards Parade in a royal procession with a Sovereign&#x27;s Escort of Household Cavalry (mounted troops or horse guards). After receiving a royal salute, the monarch inspects his troops of the Household Division and the King&#x27;s Troop. Music is provided by the massed bands of the Foot Guards and the Mounted Band of the Household Cavalry, together with a Corps of Drums, and pipers, totalling approximately 400 musicians. Once obtained, the colour is displayed at the head of the march past the sovereign in slow and quick time, by the Foot Guards, the Household Cavalry, and the King&#x27;s Troop. (The latter two elements, being mounted, conduct a walk-past and a trot-past.)

Returning to Buckingham Palace, the monarch surveys a further march-past from outside the gates. Following a 41-gun salute by the King&#x27;s Troop in Green Park, the royal family make an appearance on the palace balcony for a Royal Air Force flypast.

==Sovereign&#x27;s official birthday==

===Sovereign&#x27;s birthday parade===
In the United Kingdom, Trooping the Colour is also known as the &quot;King&#x27;s Birthday Parade&quot; (&quot;Queen&#x27;s Birthday Parade&quot; when the monarch is female). First performed during the reign of Charles II (1660–1685), in 1748 it was decided that the parade of Trooping the Colour should mark the official birthday of the Sovereign. In 1760, after the accession of George III, it became an annual event.

In 1892, the only member of the royal family to attend was Prince George, Duke of Cambridge, due to court mourning for the death of Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence. Queen Victoria herself only attended Trooping the Colour once, in 1895, when it was held at Windsor Castle. Although some elements of the parade have remained fairly constant, the ceremonial seen today was not fixed until 1889.

=== Sovereign&#x27;s &quot;Official Birthday&quot; ===

Edward VII kept Trooping the Colour in May or June, because of the vagaries of British weather (his actual birthday being in November). It coincides with publication of the Birthday Honours List, and usually takes place at Horse Guards Parade by St James&#x27;s Park, London. It is followed by a 41-gun salute at noon in Green Park, and a flypast over Buckingham Palace, watched by the royal family from the Palace balcony.

Since 1959, it has typically been held on a Saturday in June. From 1979 to 2017 it was always held on the Saturday from 11 to 17 June; however, in 2018 it was held on 9 June and in 2019 on 8 June. During 2020 and 2021, a modified ceremony took place at Windsor Castle, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2022, Trooping the Colour was held on a Thursday, the date of 2 June coinciding with the anniversary of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s coronation on 2 June 1953.

In 2023, Charles III&#x27;s first birthday parade as monarch took place on 17 June.

===Broadcast===
Trooping the colour was first broadcast by BBC Radio in 1927 with a commentary by Major J. B. S. Bourne-May, a retired officer of the Coldstream Guards. It was first shown on BBC Television in 1937.

The parade is witnessed by a global TV audience of many millions. Over the years, commentary for the annual live broadcast in the UK by BBC1 has been provided by Huw Edwards and also by Clare Balding, together with expert guests and interviews with some of the personnel involved. The BBC&#x27;s live broadcast has become accessible to an international audience via live streaming on BritBox in both the United States and Canada. The BBC also streams it live on YouTube beginning with the 2019 edition.

For the Platinum Jubilee in 2022, additional live videos commentary of the parade for international viewers were provided by Sky News UK and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; newspaper&#x27;s YouTube channels.

====Sovereign&#x27;s participation====

Queen Elizabeth II attended Trooping the Colour in every year of her reign, except in 1955 when the event was cancelled due to a national rail strike. Having ridden her mare Burmese between 1969 and 1986, the Queen rode in a carriage from 1987. On 13 June 1981, she and her horse were startled by an unemployed youth, Marcus Sarjeant, who fired six blank rounds from a starting revolver. 
In her years attending on horseback, the Queen, as Colonel-in-Chief, rode sidesaddle and wore a biretta and a Guards Regiment uniform with the medals she was awarded before becoming Queen (Order of the Crown of India; Defence Medal; War Medal 1939–1945; King George V Silver Jubilee Medal; King George VI Coronation Medal; Canadian Forces&#x27; Decoration) and the riband and star of the Order of the Garter, the Order of the Thistle or a combination of those orders, depending which regiment was trooping its colour. From 1987 she did not wear uniform, but wore the Brigade of Guards badge.
Her 80th birthday in 2006 was marked by a large flypast of 40 planes led by the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight and culminating with the Red Arrows. It was followed by the first feu de joie (&quot;fire of joy&quot;) fired in her presence during her reign, a second being fired at her Diamond Jubilee celebrations in 2012. In 2008, a flypast of 55 aircraft commemorated the RAF&#x27;s 90th anniversary.

In 2023, at the first Trooping the Colour of Charles III as king, he revived the tradition of the sovereign riding on horseback and in uniform. The flypast of some 70 aircraft was a reprise of the display originally intended for the coronation, which had been curtailed due to poor weather.

==Participants and parade summary==

On the day of Trooping the Colour, the Royal Standard is flown from Buckingham Palace and from Horse Guards Building.

===A note on sources===
The information for the ensuing section is drawn from the visuals and music, plus the annual commentary and analysis on the BBC&#x27;s live broadcast, as well as the annual programme for the event.

===Foot Guards, including Escort to the Colour (No. 1 Guard)===
&quot;Nos. 1–6 Guards&quot; – six companies of Foot Guards, each comprising 3 officers and 71 other ranks – line two sides of the perimeter of Horse Guards Parade in an extended &quot;L&quot; shape. This recalls the defensive formation known as the &quot;hollow square.&quot;

All six companies are collectively commanded as &quot;Guards...&quot; and individually by company number, e.g., &quot;No. 3 Guard...&quot; Up to eight Guards have taken part, the number varying over the years. The most Guards ever seen on parade was 11, as seen on the 1919 parade held in Hyde Park.
The battalion trooping its colour in any given year is No. 1 Guard. During the parade, they are referred to as &#x27;Escort FOR the Colour&#x27; (and, once they have collected their colour during the ceremony, as &#x27;Escort TO the Colour&#x27;). At the outset, the colour is held by the Colour Party – a colour sergeant and two other guardsmen of No. 1 Guard, standing well-spaced on the northern side of Horse Guards Parade. Once obtained by the Regimental Sergeant Major of No. 1 Guard, the colour is borne through the ranks of Nos. 2–6 Guards by an Ensign of No. 1 Guard.

===Mounted troops and Sovereign&#x27;s Escort===

Lining the edge of St. James&#x27;s Park are the King&#x27;s Troop, Royal Horse Artillery and the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment – the Life Guards and the Blues and Royals.

In the Royal Procession, the Household Cavalry are termed &quot;Sovereign&#x27;s Escort&quot;. Two divisions ride before the King mounted on horseback and two behind, and the Life Guards and the Blues and Royals alternate these positions each year.

===Commanding officers and parade coordination===
Three mounted officers drawn from No. 1 Guard give drill commands during the parade. The most senior is the Field Officer in Brigade Waiting (rank of Lieutenant Colonel), assisted by the Major of the Parade. The Field Officer occupies a central position on the parade ground. The third mounted officer is the Adjutant.

The Garrison Sergeant Major of London District, who is not mounted, coordinates the whole event on the parade ground and the approach road from The Mall.

===Military bands===

With almost 400 musicians on the field, led by the Massed Bands of the Household Division, the music forms an integral part of the day. The massed bands of the Foot Guards number over 200 musicians. Joining them, since 2014, is the Mounted Band of the Household Cavalry. The musicians of all these bands are all members of the Royal Corps of Army Music. There is also a Corps of Drums from several of the regiments and, on some occasions, pipe bands of the Scots Guards and Irish Guards. As per divisional tradition, the Corps of Drums and Pipe Bands form up behind the Massed Bands. As per Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s request, during a Scots or Irish Guards troop, the Pipers would march to the front of the Massed Bands to play the regimental quick marches of the Scots and Irish Guards as their Guards march past in quick time.

===Summary of the parade design===
The entire parade is best understood as an exercise of several elements carried out in slow and quick march time, with the Trooping the Colour phase forming the centrepiece.

* The Sovereign inspects first the Foot Guards and then the Household Cavalry and King&#x27;s Troop, to slow and quick march music respectively.
* Then the massed bands &quot;troop&quot; before the Sovereign in slow and quick time. A lone drummer breaks away to no 1 Guard.
* Drummer&#x27;s Call signals No. 1 Guard – the Escort for the Colour – to march to the centre of the field and obtain their colour from the Colour Party. The massed bands execute the &quot;Spin Wheel&quot; manoeuvre.
* As &quot;Escort to the Colour&quot;, No. 1 Guard then slowly troops its regimental colour through the ranks of Guards Nos. 6–2.
* After forming divisions, Nos. 1–6 Guards march past the Sovereign in slow and quick time.
* To music from the mounted band, The King&#x27;s Troop leads the Household Cavalry past the Sovereign, first in walk-march and then in sitting-trot (i.e., slow and quick time for the horses). The mounted band then salute the Sovereign as they walk off.
* Finally, led by the Sovereign&#x27;s Escort, the massed bands play the Sovereign back to Buckingham Palace, the foot guards following, as the King&#x27;s Troop leaves Horse Guards first to Green Park.

The entire parade is supervised by the Field Officer in Brigade Waiting (sometimes shortened to &quot;Field Officer&quot;), with the assistance of the Brigade Major and the Adjutant, all on horseback, and joined by the London District Garrison Sergeant Major, who is unmounted and coordinates the proceedings of the ceremony.

=== March on ===
A detail of guardsmen bearing marker flags marches on, to mark the positions of Nos. 1-6 Guards. (These marker flags are the respective company colours from each regiment.)

Preceded by their regimental bands, Nos. 1-6 Guards march into position. No. 1 Guard is &quot;Escort for the Colour.&quot;

*Nos. 1-5 Guards align in two ranks on the west side of the parade ground facing Horse Guards Building.
*No. 6 Guard lines up perpendicular to them on the north side, thus making an &quot;L&quot; shape. Up to eight Guards companies may take part. Nos. 7 and 8 Guards, if present, would line up next to No. 6 Guard. In 2009, to reflect the successful recruitment efforts of the Irish Guards, there were seven Guards on Horse Guards.
*The massed bands are on the south side, by the gardens of 10 Downing Street.
*Adjacent to No. 6 Guard is the Colour Party made up of 3 soldiers. A snare drummer joins them in the march on. As the party takes its place the drummer marches off and the colour&#x27;s casing is removed, revealing the colour to be trooped.
*The King&#x27;s Troop, the Household Cavalry, and their mounted band form up behind Nos. 1-5 Guards.

With the foot guards in their home service order and the mounted band in state dress uniform, the assembled ranks of Household Division make a colourful spectacle.

Guards half-companies line up on the road to Horse Guards Parade to provide security to the Royal Family that will arrive later and to the marching and mounted contingents.

===Arrival of the sovereign===

Preceding the sovereign, senior members of the royal family arrive in barouches to view the ceremony from a central first floor window in the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s former office in Horse Guards Building. This procession turns at the Guards Memorial, and No. 3 Guard has opened ranks to allow their carriages to pass through.


Preceded by the Sovereign&#x27;s Escort, the King (Colonel-in-Chief) will journey from Buckingham Palace down the Mall, on horseback. Directly behind the King in the Royal Procession ride the Royal Colonels— William, Prince of Wales (Welsh Guards), Prince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh (Scots Guards), Anne, Princess Royal (The Blues and Royals). In a carriage behind the procession ride Queen Camilla (Grenadier Guards) and Catherine, Princess of Wales (Irish Guards)who are followed by the non-royal Colonels of Regiments (those of the Coldstream Guards and The Life Guards). Other officers of the Household Division and of the Royal Household follow, all mounted, including the Master of the Horse, the Major-General commanding the Household Division with his chief of staff and aide-de-camp, Silver Stick-in-Waiting, the regimental adjutants and a number of the King&#x27;s equerries. As the King passes by the Colour of the unit being trooped, he salutes it.

As the King arrives, the Royal Standard is prepared to be released and flown from the roof of Horse Guards. The King then will alight at the Saluting Base to start the ceremonies.

The field officer commences the parade with the command: &quot;Guards – Royal Salute – Present Arms!&quot; and the national anthem (God Save The King) is played by the Household Division&#x27;s Foot Guards Massed Bands, led by the senior director of music of the Household Division. Simultaneously, the Royal Standard is formally released and flies from the Horse Guards flagpole.

===Inspection of the line===
The King then rides off from the saluting base before and behind the long line of assembled guards, with the Royal Colonels following. BBC television commentaries every year emphasise the King&#x27;s knowledge of the attributes of his guards, and single out &quot;steadiness&quot; as a highly prized quality for a guardsman.

The accompanying marches always carry a flavour of the regiment whose colour is being trooped on the day, lending the royal inspection a unique atmosphere. For example, if the Welsh Guards are trooping their colour, the music will include their traditional regimental march, &quot;Men of Harlech&quot;. While the King passes the six companies of foot guards on his left, a slow march or air is played. Once the phaeton turns around the rear of No. 6 Guard, the music changes to a quick march. The King travels back up the line, passing the Household Cavalry and King&#x27;s Troop stationed on his right, saluting the Sovereign&#x27;s Standard of the Household Cavalry and the lead gun of the King&#x27;s Troop in quick succession acknowledging their presence on the field. The inspection completed, the music ceases, and he is conveyed back to the saluting base.

=== Massed bands troop ===
With the monarch once more mounted at the saluting base, the command &quot;Troop!&quot; is given by the Field Officer. This is not to be confused with the trooping of the colour itself, which occurs later in the ceremony. Three strikes on a bass drum give the signal for the Massed Bands to start their march in the field.

The Guards, after standing at attention, change arms. Under the command of the Senior Drum Major, the Massed Bands march and countermarch on Horse Guards Parade in slow and quick time. The slow march music is traditionally the Waltz from &quot;Les Huguenots&quot;. During the quick march segment, a lone drummer from the Corps of Drums breaks away from the massed bands, marching to two paces to the right of No. 1 Guard to take his post while the band marches on, stopping just near the colour party.

The Trooping of the Colour phase of the ceremony is initiated by the lone drummer&#x27;s eight-bar &quot;Drummer&#x27;s Call&quot;, signalling the Captain of No. 1 Guard to cede his command to the Subaltern of No. 1 Guard and move to take his new position at the right of No. 2 Guard. It slopes arms, while the Field Officer directs the other companies present to change arms and stand at ease. The call having been sounded, the lone drummer returns to his position in the Massed Bands.

=== Escort for the Colour obtains the colour ===
As Escort for the Colour, No. 1 Guard performs the centrepiece of the parade.

An orderly takes the pace stick from the Regimental Sergeant-Major (RSM), positioned behind the Escort for the Colour, thus freeing the RSM to draw his sword – the only time a British Army infantry warrant officer ever does so on parade. The Subaltern then commands No. 1 Guard to move into close order, and then dresses it. Then, led by the Subaltern with the Ensign following, and with the Regimental Sergeant-Major marching behind the company, the Escort for the Colour quick marches onto the field to &quot;The British Grenadiers&quot;. (This tune is always used irrespective of which regiment&#x27;s colour is being trooped, because the right flank of every battalion used to be a grenadier company.) A guardsman behind the colour party marches forward towards the Colour Sergeant of the colour party at the same time during the Escort approaching then hands over the rifle to the Colour Sergeant, salutes the colour and leaves the parade ground. The Escort marks time while the Massed Bands &quot;clear the line of march&quot; and move to the front of the Guards and mark time. Fifteen steps away from the Colour Party, the music halts and four paces later, the &#x27;Escort for the Colour&#x27; halts in place, and is ordered to open ranks and dressed, followed by the Massed Bands making an about turn.

The guards are then called to attention and then change and slope arms under the direction of the Field Officer, while the Household Cavalry are also called to attention by the commander of the Sovereign&#x27;s Escort.

The RSM marches around to the front of the Escort and, followed by the Ensign, approaches the Colour Party. Having saluted the colour with his sword, the Sergeant-Major takes it from the Colour Sergeant, freeing him to change and then slope arms. The RSM turns, marches to the Ensign, and presents the colour to him. The Ensign salutes the colour with his sword, sheathes the sword without taking his eyes off the colour, and takes possession of it.

Having obtained their colour, No. 1 Guard (formerly known as &quot;Escort &quot;for&quot; the Colour&quot;) is now termed &quot;Escort &quot;to&quot; the Colour.&quot; By then, the massed bands, now with the line cleared, face front, with the Corps of Drums, pipe bands and the senior director of music leading.

=== Positioning of the Escort to troop its colour ===
To the first six bars of &quot;God Save the King&quot;, the Escort to the Colour presents arms. Simultaneously, turning outward at an angle of 45°, the NCOs (non-commissioned officers) at the four corners (or flanks) of the Escort port arms, described in annual television commentary and analysis as &quot;protection&quot; for the colour.

The Escort to the Colour and Colour Party slope arms. The Colour Sergeant marches to the right and to the rear of the Escort. Once the Colour Party, Ensign and Regimental Sergeant-Major have joined the Escort, the RSM repositions himself to the left of and behind the Escort. The Subaltern then orders the Escort to change arms and orders the slow march. The Massed Bands turn about.

==== Spinwheel of the massed bands ====
As the Escort to the Colour slow-marches down the field towards No. 6 Guard to begin their colour trooping, the massed bands perform their unique anti-clockwise &quot;spinwheel&quot; manoeuvre. This, a 90° turn in restricted space, is performed while playing the slow march &quot;Escort to the Colour.&quot;

The celebrated spinwheel is largely individual and instinctive: A &#x27;wheel&#x27; is not an easy manoeuvre with even a small body of troops, and with a block of 400 men the normal wheel is impossible. The massed band therefore pivots on its own centre, so that certain outer ranks and files march long distances in a hurry while the centre and inner ranks loiter with extreme intent, or merely mark time. Yet others not only step sideways but backwards as well. This highly complex movement is called a &#x27;spin-wheel&#x27;, the details of which can be found in no drill book or manual of ceremonial. Its complexity defies description, and if the truth were known, many of the participants know not whither they go or, on arrival, how they got there. The spin-wheel is almost an art form and each performance of it, although similar in essentials, is different in detail. Most of the performers are adjusting their actions to suit the needs of the spin-wheel of the moment, having adjusted their movements quite otherwise on other occasions.
Once the Escort reaches the edge of No. 6 Guard, the music stops, and the Field Officer in Brigade Waiting orders the entire parade (except the Escort) to present arms as the trooping proper starts. The music changes to &quot;The Grenadiers&#x27; Slow March.&quot;

===Trooping the colour through the ranks===
To the strains of the Grenadiers Slow March, the Escort to the Colour then troops the colour down the long line of Nos. 6-2 Guards. The colour itself is borne by the Ensign in front of the line of guards, but the ranks of the Escort interweave with their ranks. For Nos. 6-2 Guards, who maintain the &#x27;present arms&#x27; position, the long trooping, especially on a hot day, requires stamina. As this is done the Massed Bands move back in slow time to their original places.

Eventually the Escort arrives back at its original position as No. 1 Guard – from where it first marched off in quick time. Their Captain, who had temporarily ceded his command to the Subaltern, resumes his command over No. 1 Guard by ordering them to present arms, thus bringing the Escort back in line with Nos. 2-6 Guards. The entire parade is now ordered by the Field Officer to slope arms, thus concluding the trooping phase.

The trooping phase is followed by the march-past in slow and quick time of the foot guards and then the Household Cavalry and King&#x27;s Troop, also in slow and quick time.

=== Preparing for the march-past ===

The Field Officer gives the command, &quot;Officers, take post.&quot; Nos. 1 to 5 Guard then &quot;retire&quot;, about-turning and right-forming into review formation, following which the Adjutant commands &quot;Guides, steady&quot;, giving signal to the company guides to resume their positions. Nos. 1 to 5 Guard then about-turn again as the Corps of Drums play. Since No. 6 Guard is already standing at right angles to the other five companies it does not need to execute this movement, but instead it moves close-order position then to the right in threes after Nos. 1 to 5 Guards turn back to advance position.

Once intervals are established, the Field Officer salutes the King and informs him that the foot guards are ready to march past, then after turning about, commands, &quot;Guards will march past in slow and quick time... Slow march!&quot; No. 6 Guard will then left turn to be advance and then form two ranks on marching after the parade has started to execute the slow march.

=== Foot guards march past in slow and quick time ===

No. 1 Guard – the Escort – leads the six companies for two circuits of Horse Guards Parade, saluting the King as they pass. The corners of the field are negotiated with the complex Left Form manoeuvre. Commands of &quot;Change direction – left!&quot; are then followed by the Left Guide (or Right Guide) of each Guard signalling &quot;Right Sir!&quot; to the Captain that the company has reached the position, the Captain will immediately orders &quot;Left...Form!&quot;

At the end of both the slow and quick march-past, the Field Officer rides out to salute the King with his sword, telling him that His Majesty&#x27;s Guards have ended their march-past.

====Slow march-past====
Neutral slow marches start and conclude this section as the Massed Bands march into the centre of the field to take their places. The guards are preceded past the saluting base by the Field Officer and the Major of the Parade, who salute the King with their swords and eyes right.

To the strains of their regimental slow marches, each of Nos. 1-6 Guards passes before the King with their eyes right, their regimental officers saluting with swords. The leading company, No. 1 Guard – the Escort to the Colour – has a particular honour. The Ensign lowers the colour – the &#x27;flourish&#x27;. The King acknowledges it with a bow of the head, and the Royal Colonels salute the colour. Once past the saluting base, the colour is raised again – the &#x27;recover&#x27; – and &quot;eyes front&quot; is ordered.

Each company&#x27;s salute is acknowledged by the King and the Royal Colonels.

====Quick march-past====
For this circuit, the colour is at the rear of the Escort (No. 1 Guard), protected by the Colour Party. Their regimental quick marches are played as each guard passes before the King with eyes right. However, this being a quick march, the officers do not salute with swords, but only with the eyes right instead. As with the slow march-past, neutral marches start and conclude this section, and the Colour is marched on past the saluting base as the King and Queen and Royal Colonels salute it.

The massed bands, led by the Corps of Drums and the pipes and drums, march away to allow the mounted bands on to the ground. By then, the foot guards have ended their march, and are now back in place and dressed.

===Mounted troops ride past===
The now sole Mounted Band of the Household Cavalry in state dress, led by the two drum horses representing the two constituent regiments of the Household Cavalry, and the Director of Music of the Household Cavalry, ride slowly on to the field, traditionally to the tune &quot;Preobrajensky.&quot;

It is the turn of Household Cavalry and King&#x27;s Troop to complete two circuits of Horse Guards Parade. For the horses, slow and quick time correspond to a walk-march and a sitting-trot, respectively. Since 1997, the mounted contingent is led by the commander of the King&#x27;s Troop and then by the Sovereign&#x27;s Escort commander.

In both turns of the ride past the Foot Guards present arms as per the Field Officer&#x27;s orders. The order of march past follows the arrangement of the Sovereign&#x27;s Escort for the year.

====Walk-march====
Salutes are again given to the King, and returned by him, the Queen, and the Royal Colonels to the colours as they pass by.

The Royal Horse Artillery, marching to the &quot;Royal Artillery Slow March&quot; and then the &quot;March from &quot;Aida&quot;&quot;, is first, taking precedence over all other units when on parade with its guns. When the King&#x27;s Troop passes the saluting base, the King acknowledges the leading gun as the colour.

The Life Guards, in red jackets and white plumes, are next, followed by The Blues and Royals, in blue jackets and red plumes. Officers salute their sabres on the eyes right in this segment. The sequence of regimental marches is: &quot;Life Guards&#x27; Slow March&quot;, followed by &quot;Blues and Royals&#x27; Slow March&quot;, and then &quot;The Royals.&quot;

Riding at the rear of the Household Cavalry are the farriers, one for each regiment, carrying their glinting axes and flanked by a soldier of each regiment. (The Life Guards farrier wears a black plume rather than the usual regimental white, and a blue tunic rather than red.)

The two Household Cavalry regiments take turns to parade and the job of parading the King&#x27;s Cavalry Standard of either of the two regiments alternates yearly between the Life Guards and the Blues and Royals. As the standard passes by, it is flourished (dipped), in the presence of the King and Queen and the Royal Colonels and after walking past them is recovered.

====Trot-past====
A state trumpeter of either of the two Household Cavalry regiments plays &quot;The Trot&quot; to signal the beginning of the sitting trot-past. &quot;The Keel Row&quot; is traditionally played, and much dust is raised by the horses. Both the King&#x27;s Troop&#x27;s lead gun and the King&#x27;s Cavalry Standard (not dipped) are trotted past the King and the royal colonels, who are saluted with eyes right.

As the trot-past ends the mounted band salutes the King, the drumhorse riders crossing their drumsticks above their heads. They then proceed back to the east side of Horse Guards Parade and halt in place.

===Preparing for march-off===

Their director of music turns inwards on his horse as a signal to the Field Officer that the Household Cavalry and the King&#x27;s Troop are now in position to formally end the proceedings under the command of the Field Officer.

During the final Royal Salute, as the parade renders their birthday wishes from all 7 regiments of the Household Division to their colonel-in-chief, the colour of No. 1 Guard is lowered to the ground by the Ensign while &quot;God Save the King&quot; is played by the Massed Bands. Forming divisions once more, accompanied by the Corps of Drums, the guards prepare to march off, and the Household Cavalry and the King&#x27;s Troop leave the field. The Field Officer, after forming the parade for the march-off, then rides towards the saluting base, informing the King that the guards are ready to march off the field while the RSM of the Escort returns his sword into his scabbard as an orderly returns to him his pace stick.

The King&#x27;s Troop, Royal Horse Artillery, leaves Horse Guards Parade and proceeds to Green Park (adjacent to Buckingham Palace) to formally commence the royal 41-gun salute. At the same time in the Tower of London, the Honourable Artillery Company (HAC) takes its positions in the tower grounds for the special 62-gun salute that will be happen when the King arrives. This gun salute is only done by the HAC during royal anniversaries.

===Marching off===
Led by the massed bands, the King places himself at the head of his foot guards. The entire parade of 1,000 soldiers and 400 musicians marches up the Mall towards Buckingham Palace. The Markers then march off the grounds carrying the regimental company colours on the marker flags. The King&#x27;s Troop and the HAC, now in place, get ready to commence firing their respective gun salutes during the Royal Family&#x27;s arrival at the palace. At the same time, the old and new King&#x27;s Guards, now performing the Changing of the Guard in the palace forecourt at the same time as the ceremony being done, also prepare for the royal carriages&#x27; arrival and to salute the King on horseback when he arrives.

==After the ceremony==

When the King returns to Buckingham Palace, the first division of the Escort to the Colour forms into two detachments of the new guard and enters the forecourt, opposite the old guard; but unlike the usual Changing of the Guard, the Regimental Sergeant Major participates in the ceremony. The remainder of the guards perform a march-past outside the gateway, in quick time instead of the usual slow time, with the King, positioned before the central gateway, receiving their salute. As the guards march past, their regimental marches are played by the massed and mounted bands respectively. The rest of the royal family observes the march-past from the balcony.

The King passes into the palace between the Old and New Guards, with both guards saluting him and the Royal Colonels. The usual semi-daily Changing of the Guard continues on the forecourt of the palace.

The gun salutes begin on the arrival of the King at Buckingham Palace, with the King&#x27;s Troop firing a 41-gun royal salute in Green Park and the Honourable Artillery Company firing a 62-gun royal salute from the Tower of London grounds.

Finally, the King and the royal family on the palace balcony witness a flypast by the Royal Air Force, often featuring the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight and the Red Arrows. This is once again followed by the National Anthem and in special years, a feu de joie followed by the shouting of the three cheers to the King on behalf of the entire Household Division.

==Regimental marches of the foot guards==
Below are links to words and music of the regimental marches of the five foot guards regiments.

Slow marches
*Grenadier Guards: &quot;The March from Scipio&quot;, composed for the First Guards (Grenadier Guards) by Handel. It was presented by Handel to the Regiment &quot;before&quot; its inclusion in his opera Scipione which was first performed in 1726. (The title and composer&#x27;s name are anglicised by the Regiment.) 
*Coldstream Guards: &quot;Figaro&quot; (the tune is &quot;Non piu andrai&quot; from Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot;)
*Scots Guards: &quot;The Garb of Old Gaul&quot; Lyrics and Music
*Irish Guards: &quot;Let Erin Remember&quot; Lyrics and Music
*Welsh Guards: &quot;Men of Harlech&quot; Lyrics and Music.

Quick marches
Music for all five regiments&#x27; quick marches 
* Grenadier Guards: &quot;The British Grenadiers&quot; Lyrics and melody-notation and Music
* Coldstream Guards: &quot;Milanollo.&quot; This march was composed by J V Hamm in honour of a pair of violin-playing child prodigy sisters, Teresa and Maria Milanollo, who performed in England in the mid-19th century during their extensive European tours.
* Scots Guards: &quot;Hielan&#x27; Laddie&quot; 
* Irish Guards: &quot;Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day&quot; whose lyrics were the poem &quot;Pulse of an Irishman&quot; (Beethoven composed an arrangement of the march as part of a song cycle of Scots and Irish tunes).
* Welsh Guards: &quot;The Rising of the Lark&quot; Lyrics and Music

==List of regiments trooping the colour==
Since only one colour can be trooped down the ranks at a time, each year a single battalion of the five Foot Guards regiments is selected to troop its colours.

The 2nd Battalions of the Grenadier Guards, Coldstream Guards and Scots Guards are in &quot;suspended animation&quot; - they are represented in the parade by three incremental companies. In 2022, two new incremental companies were formed following the conversion of the 1st Battalion, Irish Guards to the specialised infantry role. These new units, No. 9 Company and No. 12 Company, continue the traditions of the 2nd Battalion, Irish Guards, which was placed in suspended animation in 1947.

The number of soldiers participating in Trooping the Colour in London has declined over the years due to defence budget cuts in Household Division battalions as well as the battalions&#x27; commitments to military and peacekeeping operations overseas. This gives some of the units little time to practise ceremonial functions. However, the format of the ceremony has remained the same over the centuries following routines of old battle formations used in the era of musket warfare. The 1988 parade was the last until 2023 to have all five regiments in participation, and in 1993 the parade was reduced from eight guards companies to six companies.

==Associated events==

Before the Sovereign&#x27;s Birthday Parade, the Trooping the Colour parade is conducted twice in full on the two preceding Saturdays, which serve as dress rehearsals for the main event.

===The Major General&#x27;s Review===
Held two Saturdays beforehand, the parade is identical to the Sovereign&#x27;s Birthday Parade, with the exception that there are no soldiers lining The Mall. The salute is taken by the Major-General commanding the Household Division.

===The Colonel&#x27;s Review===
Held on the Saturday beforehand, the salute is taken by the Royal Colonel of the regiment whose colour is being trooped. This time, the parade includes 250 Guardsmen who line the route along The Mall.

==Trooping the Colour in other Commonwealth countries and territories==

===Australia===
In Australia the Trooping the King&#x27;s Colour takes place annually on the King&#x27;s Birthday Holiday by the staff cadets of Royal Military College, Duntroon, in Canberra, formerly at the RMC parade grounds and now at Rod Point at the shores of Lake Burley Griffin. The Queen&#x27;s colour was trooped there for the first time on the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Parade in 1956, a practice which has continued since then. Colours were first presented to the Corps of Staff Cadets by King George VI when, as Duke of York, he visited Australia in 1927. These colours are now lodged in the college&#x27;s Patterson Hall. Colours were again presented by Queen Elizabeth II on 10 May 1988 and most recently on 22 October 2011 during a brief visit to Australia, coinciding with RMC Duntroon&#x27;s centenary year.

The Champion Company of the Corps of Staff Cadets is named after the Sovereign&#x27;s Company and it carries the Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s banner, which was first presented to the Corps of Staff Cadets by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother on 26 February 1958. The Sovereign&#x27;s Company is entitled to carry the banner on all ceremonial parades as well as escorting the Queen&#x27;s colour during the Trooping the Colour. The Governor-General of Australia, being the King&#x27;s representative in the Commonwealth, is the reviewing officer of the parade, and since the move to Rod Field has been attended by the public as well.

===Bermuda===
The Trooping of the Colour in Hamilton is held on Front Street by troops of the Royal Bermuda Regiment (who make up No. 1 Guard), as well as supporting units of the Bermuda Police Service and the Bermuda Junior Leaders (RBR). The presiding officer of the ceremony is the Governor of Bermuda, who inspects the units at the start. At the conclusion of the ceremony, the guards conduct a &quot;Feu de joie&quot;, followed by a 21-gun salute and three cheers to the Sovereign.

===Canada===
In Canada the Trooping the Colour ceremony on Parliament Hill takes place, with a trooping of the King&#x27;s Colour, only for the King, members of the royal family, the governor general, or a lieutenant-governor, on Remembrance Day, or in honour of the King&#x27;s Birthday, on Victoria Day. Trooping the Colour ceremonies have also taken place at Rideau Hall. New colours may also be trooped when they are presented. Colours are also trooped during unit anniversaries. In Ottawa, should any of the above be absent for the ceremony, the salute is taken by the Minister of National Defence and the Chief of the Defence Staff, and the Regimental Colour is trooped instead. The ceremony was first performed on a national scale in Canada in 1939, during the royal tour that year. Earlier versions of the event were held in relation to the regiment, with one of the first to occur since the Confederation of Canada taking place over two weeks later on 18 July 1867, with The Royal Canadian Regiment trooping on the Champ de Mars in Montreal. The first major ceremony since 1939 took place in 1953 during the coronation day ceremonies in front of Centre Block that included the Trooping of the Colour in front of Governor General Vincent Massey. In 1958, it became a regular event on the 1 July holiday.

=== Ghana ===
In Ghana, the traditional Trooping the Colour ceremony is held annually during the Independence Day celebrations on 6 March. The escort for the colour is mounted by the Ghana Army and has the task of retrieving the ceremonial colours of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, alongside the Flag of Ghana. After the escort presents arms to &quot;God Bless Our Homeland Ghana&quot;, the escort for the colour then marches off to the tune of the British grenadier guards in slow time. The ceremony takes place on Black Star Square, where the national salute is taken by the President of Ghana in his, or her, position as commander in chief of the GAF. Musical accompaniment is provided by the combined massed bands of the Ghana Armed Forces Central Band and school marching bands.

==== Regiments that take possession of the Colour of the Arab Revolt ====
=== Kenya ===
Kenya is one of three African countries that still practises the traditional British ceremony of Trooping the Colour.

This takes place every 12 December on Jamhuri Day (the day when Kenya became an independent nation and later a republic), but unlike the British one all the three services of the Kenya Defence Forces takes part in the Trooping the colour. The service branch whose battalion is trooping the colour provides number one and number two guards.

The ceremony normally begins at 11:30 after the arrival of the President of Kenya, who takes the national salute as the national anthem and the anthem of the East African Community are played by the massed bands. After finishing his inspection of the parade, the bands play a slow march followed with a quick march, during which the lone drummer then breaks away to take his position beside number one guard to play the drummers call, signalling the officers of No.1 Guard to take positions to receive the colour and the Guard&#x27;s RSM removing his pace stick and then unsheathing his sword. The escort for the colour then marches off to collect the colour as the massed KDF band play either &quot;The British Grenadiers&quot; or a locally composed march, after which the escort halts in position. After the hand over and as the Escort presents arms the first verse of the Kenya national anthem is played, then the escort to the colour marches off in a slow march to the tune of &quot;The Grenadiers&#x27; Slow March&quot;. The first tune normally played during the march in slow time is always &#x27;By land and sea&#x27;.

=== Malaysia ===
Also part of the Commonwealth, Malaysia performs Trooping the Colours every first Saturday in June, days after the official birthday of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, the elected Malaysian king, on the first Monday, in front of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, the Raja Permaisuri Agong, the Prime Minister of Malaysia, the Deputy Prime Minister, and other officials of the government, and officers of the Malaysian Armed Forces, of which the King is the Commander-in-Chief as prescribed by the Malaysian Constitution of 1957 as amended.

The Malaysian trooping follows the publication of an Honours List for the King&#x27;s Birthday on the same week. It also incorporates many elements of the British Trooping ceremony, including a Royal Procession before and after the parade, The Sovereign&#x27;s Escort provided by the Royal Armored Corps, Saluting Base at Merdeka Square, National Heroes&#x27; Square or at the Stadium Merdeka, Royal Inspection, the duties of Field Officer, Major of the Parade and Adjutant officers and the NCO duties of Regt. Sergeant Majors and Colour Sergeants, the Royal Salute, 21-gun salutes by the Royal Artillery Regiment, and flypasts (flying the Malaysian flag and the flags of the Armed forces). It is conducted in Malay and includes prayers, in the Islamic traditions of the Malaysian Armed Forces. Motorized vehicles are used in the Royal Procession from the Royal Malaysian Police. The main differences are that five colours are trooped, covering all three branches of the Armed Forces, and some of marches played are locally composed. This threefold representation is reflected in the composition of the Colours Party, the Escort for/to the Colours and the Massed Military Bands in attendance.

The 2014 event was held on Friday, 13 June, at Kem Perdana, Sungai Besi, which was a departure from normal tradition of the Saturday troopings. This was the very first time in Malaysian history that Trooping the Colour was held on the Friday in June closest to the King&#x27;s Birthday, rather than the traditional first Saturday of the month. In an old tradition which resumed in 2016 at the National Heroes&#x27; Square, Putrajaya, if the celebrations fall on Ramadan, then the birthday parade is held on the Friday before 31 July, Heroes&#x27; Day.

For the first time in history, the traditional Trooping the Colours was held on 19 September 2017, the Tuesday after Malaysia Day, in National Heroes&#x27; Square, Putrajaya, given the decision to move the King&#x27;s Birthday to the Monday following Independence Day. With the move to September the Trooping the Colours in Putrajaya ends more than a month of national celebrations in honour of the anniversary of Malaysian independence in 1957 and the formation of the armed forces in 1932.

The old June date was restored in 2019.

=== Malta ===
Given Malta&#x27;s history as a former British dominion, the Armed Forces of Malta performs Trooping the Colour every 13 December in celebration of Republic Day at St. George&#x27;s Square in Valletta, the national capital. The salute is taken by the President of Malta, who is the commander in chief of the AFM.

The units that provide the colour and official band are from the 1st Regiment, Armed Forces of Malta, and the Armed Forces of Malta Band.

===Singapore===
The Singapore Armed Forces performs Trooping the Colours in the SAF Day Parade on 1 July. It is held on special occasions and is toned down as compared to the British version and is done after the awarding of the State Colours to the Best units of the Army, Navy and Air Force. If new Colours have been consecrated on SAF day, they are usually included in the Trooping, but if otherwise, are Trooped on a separate day. The Escorts to the Colour (No.1 Guard) are usually formed by the Singapore Armed Forces Military Police Command, while Nos. 2-5 Guards are composed of personnel from the SAF National Day Parade Guard of Honour Contingents. Unlike the British parade, it has supporting contingents that march past as well.

The salute is taken by the President of Singapore, the Prime Minister of Singapore, and the Chief of Defence Force, while the band in attendance is either the SAF Central Band or the SAF Ceremonial Band A (both from the Singapore Armed Forces Bands).

The No.2 Guard is usually made up of personnel from the Singapore Army&#x27;s Best Army Unit Competition winner for the current year, typically the 1st Commando Battalion, Singapore Armed Forces Commando Formation. Of Nos. 3 and 4 Guards, these are, as of recent NDPs, formed up of the Naval Diving Unit and the Air Power Generation Command. HQ Digital and Intelligence Service began to provide No.5 Guard beginning in 2023, in honor of its formation.

Alongside the SAF Day Trooping, it has also been performed on unit or command anniversaries.

=== Uganda ===
The Ugandan Armed Forces performs a Trooping the Colour on Independence Day on Kololo Ceremonial Grounds in the national capital, with salute being taken by the President of Uganda.

===Former Countries ===
===Rhodesia===
On 25 April 1954, a date which was later designated as &quot;Tanlwe Chaung Day&quot;, the Rhodesian African Rifles 
performed the first ever Trooping of the Colour in Southern Rhodesia in the presence of Governor General 
Lord Llewellin.

The Rhodesian Light Infantry trooped their Colour for the only time on 27 July 1970 at Cranborne Barracks, with the Mayor of Salisbury (now Harare), the Minister of Defence Jack Howman, Prime Minister Ian Smith and the commanding officer of the Rhodesian African Rifles in attendance. Regimental Sergeant Major Robin Tarr began the proceedings at 10:35, after which the Rhodesian African Rifles Band and Drums began playing the RLI&#x27;s slow march, &quot;The Incredibles&quot;, as the RLI troopers marched onto the parade square. The regimental colour was then trooped before finally the RLI men performed a march-past in slow and quick time.

===Ireland===
Before the First World War and the partition of Ireland, Trooping the Colour was performed annually on 17 March, Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day, by the garrison battalions in the Upper Castle Yard at Dublin Castle, in the presence of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.

== Trooping the Colour elsewhere ==

=== Jordan ===

Jordan hosted its first Trooping the Colour – the first in the Middle East – in June 2016 celebrating the centenary of the Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire. The Parade was the official celebrations of the centennial of the Great Arab Revolt () or Arab Revolt Parade on coverage online. In 2017, the Trooping of the Colour (officially known as the Flag Parade) was moved to September and is held annually. Around 1,000 troops take part in the parade, which is held in Amman, the national capital. Al Rayah Square (Square of the Emblem) was specially built for this occasion near the royal court. It stands on an area of 6,300 square metres and can host up to 5,000 people. In the parade, the King awards the Colours of the Arab Revolt to one of the army&#x27;s battalions, which holds it until the next Trooping the Colour.

In 2016, the colours went to the 28th Prince Hussein bin Abdullah II Rangers Brigade. In 2017, the colours were awarded to the 39th Ja&#x27;far bin Abi Talib Infantry Battalion. In 2018, the colours were in the possession of the 9th Prince Mohammed Mechanised Battalion.

<text>Waterloo East railway station, also known as London Waterloo East, is a railway station in central London on the line from through to London Bridge towards Kent, in the south-east of England. It is to the east of London Waterloo railway station and close to Southwark tube station.

The station opened in 1869 as Waterloo Junction, to provide a connection between the London and South Western Railway at Waterloo, and the South Eastern Railway at Charing Cross. A dedicated line was built between Waterloo and Waterloo East, which was later converted to a footpath. Trains originally ran to , but after competition from the London Underground, these were withdrawn as a wartime measure in 1916. The station continued to be connected to Waterloo mainline via a footbridge. Waterloo East was given its current name in 1977, and remains an important interchange in London. It is part of the London station group. The station is located in London fare zone 1.

==Location==

The station is on the South Eastern Main Line down the line from Charing Cross, on the other side of the River Thames across from Hungerford Bridge. Although Waterloo East is a through-station, it is classed for ticketing purposes as a central London terminus.

Services through the station are operated by Southeastern and it is situated within fare zone 1. The main access is via an elevated walkway across Waterloo Road, which connects it to the larger Waterloo station. The eastern ends of the platforms provide pedestrian connection to Southwark station which is served by London Underground&#x27;s Jubilee line; at street level there is an entrance in Sandell Street. Connections with the Underground&#x27;s Bakerloo, Northern and Waterloo &amp; City lines are available at Waterloo Underground station.

The four platforms at Waterloo East are lettered rather than numbered to ensure that staff and passengers do not confuse the platforms at the two stations.

London Buses routes 1, 11, 59, 68, 76, 77, 139, 172, 176, 188, 211, 243, 341, 381, C10, peak hours express route SL6 and night routes N1, N68, N171, N343 and N381 serve the station.

== History ==
===South Eastern Railway===
The station was built by the South Eastern Railway (SER) after the line to opened in 1864. The company were under pressure to connect with London and South Western Railway (LSWR) services, as it would allow the latter to connect to the City of London via Cannon Street. The LSWR were not interested in making Charing Cross a joint station, but were amenable to providing a connection with the SER next to Waterloo.

In 1867, the two companies agreed to build a joint connection so that passengers could change from LSWR to SER services in order to reach the City of London via . Another station, Blackfriars was built to the east, but it was closed in favour of a connecting station with the LSWR. Construction of a single-line, connection begun in May 1868, and the new connection station opened on 1 January 1869 at a total cost of £14,290 (£ as of ). Blackfriars station closed on the same date. Trains began running from Waterloo Junction to Charing Cross and Cannon Street around every five minutes. Queen Victoria used the connection for royal trains travelling from Windsor Castle to Dover and Continental Europe.

The original station was built with two platforms, which were and long, and both wide. The waiting room and ticket offices were housed in arches underneath the line. The bridge connection from the main Waterloo station included a movable platform, which allowed passengers to cross directly into Waterloo East when trains were not running. It was mounted on a four-wheel truck which could easily be moved out of the way if a train needed to come through. The connection ran until January 1893, when it was discontinued because of overcrowding.

When the SER line opened between Charing Cross and Cannon Street in 1864, it was frequented by prostitutes, who discovered the journey between the two stations was sufficiently long to service clients while paying minimum rent. After Waterloo East opened, the frequent stopping of trains there made this impractical.

The connection from Waterloo Junction through to Cannon Street did not prove a success because of competition from the Metropolitan District Railway (now the District line) and the spread of the Underground. Passengers were generally unaware of the existence of the station, as it was not obvious to find it from the main concourse in Waterloo. Following the opening of the Waterloo and City line on 8 August 1898, connections to Cannon Street were reduced. Cross train services from Waterloo Junction to Cannon Street ended on 31 December 1916, as a wartime economy measure.

The dedicated line from Waterloo through to Waterloo Junction was demolished in 1911 when the main-line station underwent an extensive reconstruction. The bridge which carried the line over Waterloo Road subsequently accommodated the pedestrian walkway between the two stations.

===Southern Railway and later===

The Southern Railway renamed the station Waterloo (&quot;also known as Waterloo Eastern&quot;) on 7 July 1935 and it took its present name on 2 May 1977. The platforms were designated A – D at the same time.

The pedestrian access from Waterloo mainline was replaced by the current high level covered walkway in 1992. The site of the original rail link, which had been out of use since 1916 was then demolished.

Waterloo East was closed for maintenance on 24 July 1993 so a link with Southwark tube station, then under construction, could be built. It re-opened on 16 August. Southwark tube station opened on 20 November 1999 with the extension of the Jubilee line to , and included a direct connection to Waterloo East.

In 2012, ticket barriers were installed at the Sandell Street and Southwark station entrances, and also at the main entrance from Waterloo station following the completion of the retail balcony. In 2018, Transport for London announced a new entrance would be built on Greet Street, providing access to both Waterloo East and Southwark.

== Services ==
All &quot;up&quot; trains run to Charing Cross only, and depart from platforms B and D. All &quot;down&quot; trains run from platforms A and C.

All services at Waterloo East are operated by Southeastern using , , , and EMUs.

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:
* 16 tph to London Charing Cross
* 4 tph to via of which 2 continue to 
* 1 tph to Dartford via 
* 4 tph to via 
* 2 tph to via 
* 1 tph to 
* 1 tph to via 
* 2 tph to via (1 semi-fast, 1 stopping)
* 1 tph to via 



==Incidents==
On 25 October 1913, a passenger train coming into Waterloo Junction from collided with a stationary train in heavy fog. Three people were killed and 24 injured. An inquest was held, where it was determined that the accident was caused by negligence of a signalman, though not to the level of criminal negligence.

<text>The University of Louisville (UofL) is a public research university in Louisville, Kentucky, United States. It is part of the Kentucky state university system. Chartered in 1798 as the Jefferson Seminary, it became in the 19th century one of the first city-funded public colleges in the United States. The university is mandated by the Kentucky General Assembly to be a &quot;Preeminent Metropolitan Research University&quot;.

Louisville is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;. The University of Louisville School of Medicine is touted for the first fully self-contained artificial heart transplant surgery, as well as the first successful hand transplantation in the United States. The University Hospital is also credited with the first civilian ambulance, the nation&#x27;s first accident services, now known as an emergency department (ED), and one of the first blood banks in the US.

University of Louisville is known for the Louisville Cardinals athletics programs. Since 2005, the Cardinals have made appearances in the NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball Final Four in 2005, 2012, and 2013 (vacated), football Bowl Championship Series Orange Bowl in 2007 (champions) and Sugar Bowl in 2013 (champions), the College Baseball World Series 2007, 2013, 2014, 2017 and 2019, the women&#x27;s basketball Final Four in 2009 (runner-up), 2013 (runner-up), 2018 (national semi-final), and 2022 (national semi-final) and the men&#x27;s soccer national championship game in 2010. The Louisville Cardinals Women&#x27;s Volleyball program has three-peated as champions of the Big East Tournament (2008, 2009, 2010), and were Atlantic Coast Conference Champions in 2015 and 2017. Women&#x27;s track and field program has won Outdoor Big East titles in 2008, 2009 and 2010 and an Indoor Big East title in 2011.

==History==

===Founding and early years: 1798–1845===

The University of Louisville traces its roots to a charter granted in 1798 by the Kentucky General Assembly to establish a school of higher learning in the newly founded town of Louisville. It ordered the sale of 6,000 acres (24 km2) of South Central Kentucky land to underwrite construction, joined on April 3, 1798, by eight community leaders who began local fundraising for what was then known as the Jefferson Seminary. It opened 15 years later and offered college and high school level courses in a variety of subjects. It was headed by Edward Mann Butler from 1813 to 1816, who later ran the first public school in Kentucky in 1829 and is considered Kentucky&#x27;s first historian.

Despite the Jefferson Seminary&#x27;s early success, pressure from newly established public schools and media critiques of it as &quot;elitist&quot; would force its closure in 1829.

Eight years later, in 1837, the Louisville city council established the Louisville Medical Institute at the urging of renowned physician and medical author Charles Caldwell. As he had earlier at Lexington&#x27;s Transylvania University, Caldwell rapidly led LMI into becoming one of the leading medical schools in what was then considered the western US. In 1840, Louisville College, a sibling municipal liberal arts school chartered a few years earlier as the Louisville Collegiate Institute, was established. As LMI fared better financially than the college, political efforts ensued to either have LMI pool their resources with the college or have the college take administrative control of LMI, with no success. In 1844 the college inherited land from Jefferson Seminary intended for higher education use, but this did not enhance its financial position.

===As a public municipal university: 1846–1969===
In 1846, the Kentucky legislature combined the Louisville Medical Institute, Louisville College, and a newly created law school into the University of Louisville, on a campus just west of Downtown Louisville. As they still maintained separate finances, Louisville College folded soon afterwards. The university experienced rapid growth in the 20th century, adding new schools in the liberal arts (1907), graduate studies (1915), dentistry (1918), engineering (1925), music (1932) and social work (1936).

In 1923, the school purchased what is today the Belknap Campus, where it moved its liberal arts programs and law school, with the medical school remaining downtown. The school had attempted to purchase a campus donated by the Belknap family in The Highlands area in 1917 (where Bellarmine University is currently located), but a citywide tax increase to pay for it was voted down. The Belknap Campus was named after the family for their efforts. In 1926, the building that would later be dedicated as Grawemeyer Hall, was built.
In 1931, the university established the Louisville Municipal College for Negroes on the former campus of Simmons University (now Simmons College of Kentucky), as a compromise plan to desegregation. As a part of the university, the school had an equal standing with the school&#x27;s other colleges. It was dissolved in 1951 when the university desegregated.

During World War II, Louisville was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission.

In the second half of the 20th century, schools were opened for business (1953), education (1968), and justice administration (1969).

===As a public state university: 1970–present===
Talk of Louisville joining the public university system of Kentucky began in the 1960s. As a municipally-funded school (meaning funding only came from the city of Louisville), the movement of people to the suburbs of Louisville created budget shortfalls for the school and forced tuition prices to levels unaffordable for most students. At the same time, the school&#x27;s well-established medicine and law schools were seen as potential assets for the state system. Still, there was opposition to the university becoming a state institution, both from faculty and alumni who feared losing the small, close-knit feel of the campus, and from universities already in the state system who feared funding cuts that would be necessitated to accommodate UofL. After several years of heated debate, the university joined the state system in 1970, a move largely orchestrated by then Kentucky governor and UofL alumnus Louie Nunn.

The first years in the state system were difficult, as enrollment skyrocketed while funding was often insufficient. Several programs were threatened with losing accreditation due to a lack of funding, although schools of nursing (1979) and urban &amp; public affairs (1983) were added.

John W. Shumaker was named the university&#x27;s president in 1995. Shumaker was a very successful fundraiser, and quickly increased the school&#x27;s endowment from $183 to $550 million. He developed the REACH program to encourage retention. In 1997, he hired athletics director Tom Jurich, who restored the athletics program and raised over $100 million to raze abandoned factories and old parking lots next to campus and replace them with on-campus athletic facilities, which vastly improved the aesthetics of the Belknap Campus. Academically, Louisville moved closer to parity with the state&#x27;s flagship University of Kentucky as retention rates and research funding increased, and average GPAs and ACT scores were much higher for incoming freshmen.

James R. Ramsey, the university&#x27;s 17th president, continued the endowment and fundraising growth started by Shumaker. However, Ramsey added more emphasis on improving the physical aspects of the Belknap Campus. To this end, he started a million-dollar &quot;campus beautification project&quot; which painted six overpasses on the Belknap Campus with a University of Louisville theme and planted over 500 trees along campus streets, and doubled the number of on-campus housing units. The university&#x27;s federal research funding doubled under Ramsey, and three buildings were built for nanotechnology and medical research. The university&#x27;s graduation rate increased from 30 percent in 1999 to 52 percent in 2012.

On June 17, 2016, Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin announced that the entire board of trustees of the university would be immediately disbanded and replaced, and that Ramsey would be stepping down. This was confirmed in a statement issued by Ramsey on the same day. Ramsey offered his resignation at a board of trustees meeting on July 27, 2016, which was accepted by the board. In December 2016, the university was placed on academic probation by its accrediting agency, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, over concerns that Governor Bevin&#x27;s actions had &quot;violated rules that require that universities be independent&quot;. The probation was lifted a year later. The governor&#x27;s actions were initially blocked by a judge but supported by new legislation passed by the Kentucky legislature in early 2017. In a lawsuit, the university sought $80 million in damages from president Ramsey, but settled only for $800,000 in 2021.

In the summer of 2017, the university again came into the national spotlight as a series of scandals became public. The university&#x27;s foundation, the organization that manages its endowment and investments, reported &quot;millions of dollars in unbudgeted spending, unapproved activities and endowment losses&quot; in an audit. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) suspended the head coach of the men&#x27;s basketball team, Rick Pitino, for five games after an investigation revealed that a university employee paid escorts to strip and have sex with players and recruits. Shortly after the NCAA announced its findings and penalties, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the office of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York announced the arrest of 10 individuals connected with a &quot;pay for play&quot; scheme connected to sportswear manufacturer Adidas and many institutions, including Louisville. Pitino was subsequently fired.

From 1895 to 2016, the university&#x27;s Belknap Campus featured a Confederate monument, built before the campus grew to surround the land on which it stood. Commemorating the sacrifices of Confederate veterans who died in the American Civil War, it was erected by the Muldoon Monument Company in 1895 with funds raised by the Kentucky Woman&#x27;s Confederate Monument Association. Due to controversy in 2016, the statue was moved from its original location to Brandenburg, Kentucky. Relocation started in November and was completed in mid-December.

Following Neeli Bendapudi&#x27;s resignation, provost Lori Stewart Gonzalez served as interim president from January 2022 to January 2023. Kim Schatzel became the University of Louisville&#x27;s 19th president on February 1, 2023.

==Campuses==

The university has three campuses in the Louisville area, the Belknap, the Health Science, and the Shelby. It also has an International Campus in Panama City, Panama, as well as various satellite facilities in the state of Kentucky and abroad:

===Belknap Campus===
Acquired in 1923, the Belknap Campus is the school&#x27;s main campus. It is located three miles (5 km) south of downtown Louisville in the Old Louisville neighborhood. It houses seven of the 12 academic colleges and features one of the casts of Auguste Rodin&#x27;s &quot;The Thinker&quot; in front of the main administrative building, Grawemeyer Hall. The grounds of the campus were originally used as an orphanage, with several of the original buildings used.

The Belknap Campus has expanded greatly in recent years, with land housing abandoned factories in the area being purchased and redeveloped. Projects built since 1998 include L&amp;N Federal Credit Union Stadium and adjacent Trager Center fieldhouse, Owsley B. Frazier Cardinal Park (which includes Ulmer Stadium for softball, Trager Stadium for field hockey, Cardinal Track and Soccer Stadium, Bass-Rudd Tennis Center, locker rooms, a playground and a cushioned walking path), Jim Patterson Stadium for baseball, Ralph R. Wright Natatorium, Owsley Brown Frazier Sports Medicine Center, and a lacrosse stadium. With new parking at Cardinal Stadium, non-resident parking was moved there and the parking lots near campus were redeveloped with new dormitory buildings, including the Bettie Johnson Apartments, Kurz Hall, Minardi Hall, and Community Park.

Other points of interest on the Belknap Campus include the Rauch Planetarium; the Covi Gallery of the Hite Art Institute, named for the painter Marcia Hite and her husband Allen; and the final resting place for former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis D. Brandeis and his wife Alice, under the portico in the Brandeis Law School. Surrounded by, but not part of the campus, is the Speed Art Museum, a private institution that is affiliated with the University of Louisville. The Kentucky State Data Center, the state&#x27;s official for census data and estimates, is located next to Bettie Johnson Hall.

Since 2008 the school has purchased three large tracts of land adjacent to the Belknap Campus, to the school&#x27;s northwest campus, to the school&#x27;s east campus – south of Hahn and south of the Speed School of Engineering. New student housing has been completed on one of the northwest segments with student parking slated for the other. A new engineering and applied sciences research park is planned for the land south of the Speed School of Engineering. It serves as the centerpiece of a Signature Tax Increment Financing (TIF) district, designed to stimulate economic growth in an area around the university&#x27;s Belknap campus. The TIF district covers more than 900 acres stretching from Belknap Campus south to the Watterson Expressway. The Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority recently approved the TIF, paving the way for what could be an estimated $2.6 billion over 30 years.
====Belknap Campus development projects====
In 2009, the university unveiled its new master plan for the next 20 years with efforts from the University of Louisville Foundation and other affiliate partners. Several important projects under construction or planned at that time included a new student recreation center, soccer stadium, new residence halls and academic buildings. Furthermore, the reconstruction of the I-65 ramps to the Belknap Campus, converting the four lanes of Eastern Parkway into a two-lane road with bike lanes and a landscaped median to improve pedestrian access to the Speed School, the moving of several university offices to allow the existing facilities at Arthur Street and Brandeis Avenue to be converted to commercial property and restaurants. The KFC Yum! Center (a men&#x27;s basketball and volleyball practice facility) was completed in the fall of 2007. A Olympic sports training/rehab center adjacent to Trager Stadium is under construction. Trager Plaza, a small plaza with a fountain, statue, and garden has been built with donations by the Trager Family on the south part of campus. The $37.5 million Student Recreation Center, located on the Fourth Street corridor along the western border of campus, opened in October 2013. The Province, The Bellamy and Cardinal Towne are three new student housing developments built to the southwest of campus, near the recreation center. All three were built by private developers, and The Province was built in tandem with Louisville&#x27;s properties. In the short term, university provost Shirley Willihnganz expects the university to continue partnerships with private entities to build student housing.

Several athletic facilities are being renovated, and the new $8 million academic center will be located beneath the Norton Terrace at the south end of Cardinal Stadium. It will be centrally located between two of the university&#x27;s cornerstone buildings, the Swain Student Activities Center and Cardinal Stadium. It will have seating capacity for over 5,300 fans and will feature a 15,500 square foot training center that will include identical locker rooms for each team, coaches&#x27; offices and a sports medicine training room. This stadium will be the second largest project the athletic department has undertaken behind Cardinal Stadium. Furthermore, a $4 million expansion of Jim Patterson Stadium includes the addition of 1,500 chair back seats, two-tiered ground level terraces, a visiting team locker room, and a 6,400 square foot terrace atop the chair back seats connecting the first and third base sides. The new Jim Patterson Stadium will have a total capacity of 5,000. Along with the $2.75 million expansion of the university&#x27;s softball stadium will feature a team clubhouse with a locker room, a video room, and a players&#x27; lounge. The Dan Ulmer Stadium will see the addition of 200 chair back seats, bringing the seating capacity to 1,000. The project will add a 2,380 square foot fan terrace wrapping around the back of the stadium, as well as a new press box that will more than double its current size.

===Health Sciences Campus===
The University Health Sciences Center, also called the med campus, is located just east of Downtown Louisville in the Louisville medical park which contains two other major hospitals and several specialty hospitals, and it houses the remaining five colleges. This is the school&#x27;s original campus, being continuously used since 1846, although none of the original buildings remain. Buildings of note on the HSC include the fourteen story Medical Research Tower and the ten-story University Hospital. Construction is finished for a recently opened, downtown Louisville Cardiovascular Research Innovation Institute building to be directed by a researcher, Stuart Williams from the University of Arizona; and an eight-story, $70 million biomedical research building.

The Cardinals are well known nationally in men&#x27;s basketball with two national championships (2013 vacated) and 9 Final Four appearances (2013 vacated), ranking 5th in NCAA Tournament wins, 9th in winning percentage, and from 2nd to 5th in annual attendance every year since 1984. For the 2015–16 season, the men&#x27;s basketball team held a self-imposed postseason ban due to a sex scandal involving recruits and former players. The NCAA put the Louisville men&#x27;s basketball program on four years probation in June 2017 and imposed a number of penalties including a suspension of head coach Rick Pitino, a reduction of scholarships and 123 vacated games as a result of its investigation into the program&#x27;s stripper scandal.

In December 2008 the Cardinals broke the Big East paid attendance record when 17,000 fans filled Freedom Hall to watch the Cards defeat rival Kentucky, and later that season advanced to the NCAA championship game, losing to Connecticut. The Cardinals returned to the NCAA final behind Native American star Shoni Schimmel in 2013, losing again to Connecticut, The following season, the Cardinals filled the KFC Yum!

<text>In particle physics, a kaon, also called a K meson and denoted , is any of a group of four mesons distinguished by a quantum number called strangeness. In the quark model they are understood to be bound states of a strange quark (or antiquark) and an up or down antiquark (or quark).

Kaons have proved to be a copious source of information on the nature of fundamental interactions since their discovery by George Rochester and Clifford Butler at the Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Manchester in cosmic rays in 1947. They were essential in establishing the foundations of the Standard Model of particle physics, such as the quark model of hadrons and the theory of quark mixing (the latter was acknowledged by a Nobel Prize in Physics in 2008). Kaons have played a distinguished role in our understanding of fundamental conservation laws: CP violation, a phenomenon generating the observed matter–antimatter asymmetry of the universe, was discovered in the kaon system in 1964 (which was acknowledged by a Nobel Prize in 1980). Moreover, direct CP violation was discovered in the kaon decays in the early 2000s by the NA48 experiment at CERN and the KTeV experiment at Fermilab.

== Basic properties ==
The four kaons are:
# , negatively charged (containing a strange quark and an up antiquark) has mass and mean lifetime .
# (antiparticle of above) positively charged (containing an up quark and a strange antiquark) must (by CPT invariance) have mass and lifetime equal to that of . Experimentally, the mass difference is , consistent with zero; the difference in lifetimes is , also consistent with zero.
# , neutrally charged (containing a down quark and a strange antiquark) has mass . It has mean squared charge radius of .
# , neutrally charged (antiparticle of above) (containing a strange quark and a down antiquark) has the same mass.

As the quark model shows, assignments that the kaons form two doublets of isospin; that is, they belong to the fundamental representation of SU(2) called the 2. One doublet of strangeness +1 contains the and the . The antiparticles form the other doublet (of strangeness −1).

[§]Strong eigenstate. No definite lifetime (see neutral kaon mixing).&lt;br&gt;
[†]Weak eigenstate. Makeup is missing small CP–violating term (see neutral kaon mixing).&lt;br&gt;
[‡] The mass of the and are given as that of the . However, it is known that a relatively minute difference between the masses of the and on the order of exists.

Although the and its antiparticle are usually produced via the strong force, they decay weakly. Thus, once created the two are better thought of as superpositions of two weak eigenstates which have vastly different lifetimes:
* The long-lived neutral kaon is called the (&quot;K-long&quot;), decays primarily into three pions, and has a mean lifetime of .
* The short-lived neutral kaon is called the (&quot;K-short&quot;), decays primarily into two pions, and has a mean lifetime .

(&quot;See discussion of neutral kaon mixing below.&quot;)

An experimental observation made in 1964 that K-longs rarely decay into two pions was the discovery of CP violation (see below).

Main decay modes for :
 

Decay modes for the are charge conjugates of the ones above.

== Parity violation ==
Two different decays were found for charged strange mesons into pions:
The intrinsic parity of the pion is P = −1 (since the pion is a bound state of a quark and an antiquark, which have opposite parities, with zero angular momentum), and parity is a multiplicative quantum number. Therefore, assuming the parent particle has zero spin, the two-pion and the three-pion final states have different parities (P = +1 and P = −1, respectively). It was thought that the initial states should also have different parities, and hence be two distinct particles. However, with increasingly precise measurements, no difference was found between the masses and lifetimes of each, respectively, indicating that they are the same particle. This was known as the τ–θ puzzle. It was resolved only by the discovery of parity violation in weak interactions (most importantly, by the Wu experiment). Since the mesons decay through weak interactions, parity is not conserved, and the two decays are actually decays of the same particle, now called the .

== History ==

 The discovery of hadrons with the internal quantum number &quot;strangeness&quot; marks the beginning of a most exciting epoch in particle physics that even now, fifty years later, has not yet found its conclusion ... by and large experiments have driven the development, and that major discoveries came unexpectedly or even against expectations expressed by theorists.  — Bigi &amp; Sanda (2016)

While looking for the hypothetical nuclear meson, Louis Leprince-Ringuet found evidence for the existence of a positively charged heavier particle in 1944.

In 1947, G.D. Rochester and C.C. Butler of the University of Manchester published two cloud chamber photographs of cosmic ray-induced events, one showing what appeared to be a neutral particle decaying into two charged pions, and one which appeared to be a charged particle decaying into a charged pion and something neutral. The estimated mass of the new particles was very rough, about half a proton&#x27;s mass. More examples of these &quot;V-particles&quot; were slow in coming.
In 1949, Rosemary Brown (later Rosemary Fowler), a research student of Cecil Powell of the University of Bristol, spotted her &#x27;k&#x27; track, made by a particle of very similar mass that decayed to three pions. 

 I knew at once that it was new and would be very important. We were seeing things that hadn&#x27;t been seen before - that&#x27;s what research in particle physics was. It was very exciting. — Fowler (2024)

This led to the so-called &#x27;tau–theta&#x27; problem: what seemed to be the same particle (now called ) decayed in two different modes, Theta to two pions (parity +1), Tau to three pions (parity −1). The solution to this puzzle turned out to be that weak interactions do not conserve parity.

The first breakthrough was obtained at Caltech, where a cloud chamber was taken up Mount Wilson, for greater cosmic ray exposure. In 1950, 30 charged and 4 neutral &quot;V-particles&quot; were reported. Inspired by this, numerous mountaintop observations were made over the next several years, and by 1953, the following terminology was being used: &quot;L meson&quot; for either a muon or charged pion; &quot;K meson&quot; meant a particle intermediate in mass between the pion and nucleon.

Leprince-Rinquet coined the still-used term &quot;hyperon&quot; to mean any particle heavier than a nucleon. The Leprince-Ringuet particle turned out to be the K meson.

The decays were extremely slow; typical lifetimes are of the order of . However, production in pion–proton reactions proceeds much faster, with a time scale of . The problem of this mismatch was solved by Abraham Pais who postulated the new quantum number called &quot;strangeness&quot; which is conserved in strong interactions but violated by the weak interactions. Strange particles appear copiously due to &quot;associated production&quot; of a strange and an antistrange particle together. It was soon shown that this could not be a multiplicative quantum number, because that would allow reactions which were never seen in the new synchrotrons which were commissioned in Brookhaven National Laboratory in 1953 and in the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in 1955.

== CP violation in neutral meson oscillations ==
Initially it was thought that although parity was violated, CP (charge parity) symmetry was conserved. In order to understand the discovery of CP violation, it is necessary to understand the mixing of neutral kaons; this phenomenon does not require CP violation, but it is the context in which CP violation was first observed.

=== Neutral kaon mixing ===

Since neutral kaons carry strangeness, they cannot be their own antiparticles. There must be then two different neutral kaons, differing by two units of strangeness. The question was then how to establish the presence of these two mesons. The solution used a phenomenon called neutral particle oscillations, by which these two kinds of mesons can turn from one into another through the weak interactions, which cause them to decay into pions (see the adjacent figure).

These oscillations were first investigated by Murray Gell-Mann and Abraham Pais together. They considered the CP-invariant time evolution of states with opposite strangeness. In matrix notation one can write
:: formula_1
where &quot;ψ&quot; is a quantum state of the system specified by the amplitudes of being in each of the two basis states (which are &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; at time &quot;t&quot; = 0). The diagonal elements (&quot;M&quot;) of the Hamiltonian are due to strong interaction physics which conserves strangeness. The two diagonal elements must be equal, since the particle and antiparticle have equal masses in the absence of the weak interactions. The off-diagonal elements, which mix opposite strangeness particles, are due to weak interactions; CP symmetry requires them to be real.

The consequence of the matrix &quot;H&quot; being real is that the probabilities of the two states will forever oscillate back and forth. However, if any part of the matrix were imaginary, as is forbidden by CP symmetry, then part of the combination will diminish over time. The diminishing part can be either one component (&quot;a&quot;) or the other (&quot;b&quot;), or a mixture of the two.

==== Mixing ====
The eigenstates are obtained by diagonalizing this matrix. This gives new eigenvectors, which we can call K1 which is the difference of the two states of opposite strangeness, and K2, which is the sum. The two are eigenstates of CP with opposite eigenvalues; K1 has CP = +1, and K2 has CP = −1 Since the two-pion final state also has CP = +1, only the K1 can decay this way. The K2 must decay into three pions. 

Since the mass of K2 is just a little larger than the sum of the masses of three pions, this decay proceeds very slowly, about 600 times slower than the decay of K1 into two pions. These two different modes of decay were observed by Leon Lederman and his coworkers in 1956, establishing the existence of the two weak eigenstates (states with definite lifetimes under decays via the weak force) of the neutral kaons.

These two weak eigenstates are called the (K-long, τ) and (K-short, θ). CP symmetry, which was assumed at the time, implies that  = K1 and  = K2.

==== Oscillation ====

An initially pure beam of will turn into its antiparticle, , while propagating, which will turn back into the original particle, , and so on. This is called particle oscillation. On observing the weak decay &quot;into leptons&quot;, it was found that a always decayed into a positron, whereas the antiparticle decayed into the electron. The earlier analysis yielded a relation between the rate of electron and positron production from sources of pure and its antiparticle . Analysis of the time dependence of this semileptonic decay showed the phenomenon of oscillation, and allowed the extraction of the mass splitting between the and . Since this is due to weak interactions it is very small, 10−15 times the mass of each state, namely 

==== Regeneration ====
A beam of neutral kaons decays in flight so that the short-lived disappears, leaving a beam of pure long-lived . If this beam is shot into matter, then the and its antiparticle interact differently with the nuclei. The undergoes quasi-elastic scattering with nucleons, whereas its antiparticle can create hyperons. Quantum coherence between the two particles is lost due to the different interactions that the two components separately engage in. The emerging beam then contains different linear superpositions of the and . Such a superposition is a mixture of and ; the is regenerated by passing a neutral kaon beam through matter. Regeneration was observed by Oreste Piccioni and his collaborators at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Soon thereafter, Robert Adair and his coworkers reported excess regeneration, thus opening a new chapter in this history.

=== CP violation ===
While trying to verify Adair&#x27;s results, J. Christenson, James Cronin, Val Fitch and Rene Turlay of Princeton University found decays of into two pions (CP = +1)
in an experiment performed in 1964 at the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron at the Brookhaven laboratory. As explained in an earlier section, this required the assumed initial and final states to have different values of CP, and hence immediately suggested CP violation. Alternative explanations such as nonlinear quantum mechanics and a new unobserved particle (hyperphoton) were soon ruled out, leaving CP violation as the only possibility. Cronin and Fitch received the Nobel Prize in Physics for this discovery in 1980.

It turns out that although the and are weak eigenstates (because they have definite lifetimes for decay by way of the weak force), they are not quite CP eigenstates. Instead, for small ε (and up to normalization),
: = K2 + εK1
and similarly for . Thus occasionally the decays as a K1 with CP = +1, and likewise the can decay with CP = −1. This is known as indirect CP violation, CP violation due to mixing of and its antiparticle. There is also a direct CP violation effect, in which the CP violation occurs during the decay itself. Both are present, because both mixing and decay arise from the same interaction with the W boson and thus have CP violation predicted by the CKM matrix. Direct CP violation was discovered in the kaon decays in the early 2000s by the NA48 and KTeV experiments at CERN and Fermilab.

<doc id="385850" wikidata="Q4938138" url="?curid=385850" title="Bohermeen">
<text>Bohermeen is a Roman Catholic parish in the Irish Diocese of Meath. Its English name is a corruption of an ancient Irish language name, &quot;An Bóthar Mín&quot;, which meant &quot;the smooth road&quot;. Originally one of the five famed ancient roadways that led from the mediaeval capital of Ireland, Tara, approximately 10 miles away cut through the area. The quality of the roadway, in an era of dirt-roads (which still exist today), earned for it the nickname of the smooth road, &quot;An Bóthar Mín&quot;.

==History==

For nearly fourteen hundred years the local area went by the name of &quot;Ard Braccan&quot; or &quot;Ardbraccan&quot;, meaning &quot;the height of Braccan&quot;, the hill on which St. Braccan located his mediaeval monastery and which in the 9th century became a diocese with its own bishop. Even when the diocese of Ardbraccan joined with other small dioceses such as &quot;Fore&quot; and Kells to form the Diocese of Meath, Braccan&#x27;s hill became the location of the palace of the Bishop of Meath.

Following the establishment of the (Anglican) Church of Ireland Ardbraccan became the seat of the Protestant Lord Bishop of Meath. Anglican bishops continued to live in the area until 1958. When in the nineteenth century the Roman Catholic Church re-established a local parish in the area, it was decided to use a different name to the local Church of Ireland parish of Ardbraccan. &#x27;Bohermeen&#x27; became the chosen name. A curate in the parish of Navan, the large town nearby, Dean Cogan, who himself had once served as a curate in Bohermeen, and who wrote the acclaimed &quot;History of the Diocese of Meath&quot; (2 volumes) in the 1860s bemoaned the choice of the secular &quot;Bohermeen&quot; (or &quot;Bohermien&quot; as he wrote it) as the parish name ahead of the more religious &quot;Ardbraccan&quot; name.

==Population and landholdings==
The area known as Bohermeen has had a predominantly Roman Catholic population according to every census done. It did however have a sizeable Church of Ireland population (see below), though that dwindled significantly in the 19th and 20th centuries. The population was hit to a minor extent by the Second Great Famine in the mid-19th century. Local folklorists record the disappearance of entire pre-famine settlements in, for example, the townland of Greetiagh within the parish. Though the records of the period are scant, folklore recorded anonymous deaths of parishioners in some of the ancient mediaeval graveyards, notably at Markiestown, where the last burials in the ancient (now destroyed) cemetery were believed to have occurred in the famine era.

The landholdings of the era were recorded as part of Griffith&#x27;s Valuation, a major land survey carried out in Ireland between 1848 and 1864.

The major land reform of the late 19th century changed the landownership pattern. The breakup of the large estates of the gentry saw most parishioners move from being tenant farmers to small landowners in their own right.

As late as the 1930s a project carried out by the Irish Folklore Commission, in which school children were asked to write down their description of their areas, recorded that most houses in the area were thatched cottages. However almost all the traditional thatched houses were knocked down in succeeding decades. The last thatched house in the parish was demolished in the 1990s.

==Environment==
The parish of Bohermeen contains within its boundaries Faughan Hill, a relatively high hill on the flat plains of Meath, where it was claimed the ancient Irish king Niall of the Nine Hostages was buried. It also contains one of Ireland&#x27;s most highly regarded Palladian country houses, Ardbraccan House, until 1885 the residence of the Church of Ireland Bishop of Meath.It also contains an ancient tower house known as &quot;Durhamstown Castle&quot;, which was once owned by the Earl of Essex, Queen Elizabeth I&#x27;s Lord Deputy in Ireland, and which is still lived in.

==St Ultan&#x27;s Church==
The main parish church, St. Ultan&#x27;s, was first built in the pre-Catholic Emancipation era, in 1817. It was built in cruciform form. The cultural and class divisions of 19th century Ireland were reflected in the usage of the building. In the aftermath of the Roman Catholic revival of the 1850s, Catholic social and gender mores were reflected in the usage of the building, with different sides of the aisle described by the community as &quot;men&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;women&#x27;s&quot;.
The building underwent periodic renovations. A new roof was added in 1897 while the wooden altar was replaced by a new set of marble altar, altar rails and reredos (all shown in the photograph above). A set of new stained glass windows were installed, notably a window of the crucifixion over the reredos and main altar.

The church was clumsily re-ordered in the aftermath of Vatican II. In the mid-1980s a complete rebuild of the church was undertaken. It was squared instead of remaining cruciform, with its high stained glass windows relocated. The reredos and altar rails were removed, while the tabernacle was re-located. The re-ordering remains somewhat controversial.

==Organisation of the parish==
Bohermeen parish itself consists of three sub-parishes; Bohermeen itself, Boyerstown and Cortown, each with their own church, St. Ultan&#x27;s (formerly called St. Cuthbert&#x27;s), St. Cuthbert&#x27;s and Christ the King respectively. It covers an area once served by a large number of mediaeval parishes, including Moyaher, Killenagolach (later called Grange) and Markiestown (also called Durhamstown - which over the centuries was spelt variously as &#x27;Dormstown&#x27;, &#x27;Durmstown&#x27; and &#x27;Dorreanstown&#x27;). None of these have surviving churches, as all were destroyed during the Reformation and the Penal period. Some old graveyards do survive, notably at Moyaher, which contains rare surviving examples of pre-Irish Great Famine gravestones and their unique carvings. The remains of cemetery at Markiestown, (a large mound in the centre of a very large field) having survived the reformation and the famine, was controversially bulldozed in the 1970s to create land for tillage.

==Decline in the Church of Ireland community==

===Disestablishment and land reform===
The Ardbraccan/Bohermeen area contained a thriving Protestant community until the early twentieth century. However a series of unrelated economic, social and religious changes led to the large-scale disappearance of the Church of Ireland community.

These changes included the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland in 1869 which undermined the financial viability of the Church of Ireland Bishop of Meath&#x27;s landed estate and led to the laying off of his mainly Protestant staff and the land reforms of the 1880s to the early 1900s, which saw the breakup of the large Protestant estates such as the Waller estate at Allenstown House, and their sale to their Catholic tenantry, again costing many local Protestants their jobs running the estates.

===The Great War and Ne Temere===

The impact of the First World War, when many Irish Protestant families lost some or all of their sons at Ypres and the Somme left large numbers of families without heirs and Protestant daughters without Protestant potential husbands, had a devastating impact, an impact augmented separately by Pope Pius X&#x27;s &quot;Ne Temere&quot; decree, which demanded that all children of Catholic-Protestant marriages be brought up as Catholic (previously, the tradition had been that the boys would be brought up in the religion of their father, the girls in the religion of their mothers). This resulted in a situation where a marriage of a Protestant to a Catholic meant the end of the Protestant line in the family.

In addition, The Troubles during the Irish War of Independence lead many Protestants, who had identified with the &quot;ancien regime&quot; of British rule in Dublin Castle to move to the United Kingdom. A combination of changing economic structures, changing class structures, changing religious structures, changing political structures, changing marriage patterns and the First World War produced a terminal decline in the numbers of Protestants in the area. Whereas once the Protestant community counted among its number one bishop, two churches, all the landed gentry, many of their staff and a local rector, as well as a local Protestant primary school, all have gone, with the ancient St. Ultan&#x27;s Church of Ireland in Ardbraccan ceasing to be used for Divine Service in 1981. One of the last members of the Church of Ireland in the locality, the former owner of Durhamstown Castle, Samuel McClelland, died in 2002.

In the mid-1980s the former owner of Ardbraccan House, Colonel Foster, decided to repair the dangerously decayed roof on the thousand-year-old church spire at the deconsecrated Anglican Church, local timber merchants supplied timber for the work free of charge, along with staff to do the reroofing. When Colonel and Mrs Foster, who had moved into the old schoolhouse at the entrance to the Anglican Church grounds, decided to take on the task of restoring the derelict cemetery, in which both Anglican and Catholic people from the area were buried, the local Catholic parish joined the efforts, offering resources and manpower. The communities sought and received state assistance so that the historic burial ground could be fully restored and preserved.

Just as its nearest town, Navan, has become a &quot;dormitory town&quot; to Dublin 30 miles away, so it has become a collection of dormitory townlands to Navan, which itself is expected within a generation to reach city size. Whereas most of its employment was once farm-based, over 40% now would in urban centres, Trim, Kells, Navan and Dublin, commuting long distances.
A controversial new M3 motorway linking the towns of Cavan and Kells with Dublin cut through farmland within sight of Ardbraccan House and the ancient monastery site in Ardbraccan, before slicing through the archaeologically sensitive site of Tara, the capital of Ireland under the Árd Rí (High King of Ireland) in mediaeval times.

Though the route of the motorway at Tara has been the subject of an international outcry from academics, historians, environmentalists and others, the Irish government under the then Taoiseach Bertie Ahern and his successor Brian Cowan, publicly supported the plans, and condemned those who criticise them. A legal challenge was planned to try to force the National Roads Authority to select an alternative route.

St. Ultans Ladies Football Club have won the Meath Senior Championship on three occasions. The most recent of these wins came on 28 September 2015 after an epic final replay in Carlonstown against Oldcastle Ladies watched by an estimated 1500 people. To date, it is the largest ever attendance of a ladies club match in Co. Meath.

<doc id="385852" wikidata="Q267170" url="?curid=385852" title="Meredith Monk">
<text>Meredith Jane Monk (born November 20, 1942) is an American composer, performer, director, vocalist, filmmaker, and choreographer. From the 1960s onwards, Monk has created multi-disciplinary works which combine music, theatre, and dance, recording extensively for ECM Records. In 1991, Monk composed &quot;Atlas&quot;, an opera, commissioned and produced by the Houston Opera&quot; &quot; and the American Music Theater Festival. Her music has been used in films by the Coen Brothers (&quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;, 1998) and Jean-Luc Godard (&quot;Nouvelle Vague&quot;, 1990 and &quot;Notre musique&quot;, 2004). Trip hop musician DJ Shadow sampled Monk&#x27;s &quot;Dolmen Music&quot; on the song &quot;Midnight in a Perfect World&quot;. In 2015, she was awarded the National Medal of Arts by Barack Obama.

==Early life==
Meredith Monk was born to businessman Theodore Glenn Monk (1909–1998) and singer Audrey Lois Monk (&quot;née&quot; Audrey Lois Zellman; 1911–2009), in New York City, New York. Her mother, a professional singer of popular and classical music known under the stage name of Audrey Marsh, was herself the daughter of professional musicians: the Russian Jewish bass-baritone Joseph B. Zellman, and Rose (Kornicker) Zellman, a concert pianist of German Jewish background from Philadelphia. Meredith has a sister, Tracy (born 1948). Monk has a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Sarah Lawrence College, where she studied composition with then-graduate student and Alwin Nikolais dancer Beverly Schmidt Blossom.

At the age of three, Monk was diagnosed with strabismus and her mother signed her up to a Dalcroze eurhythmics programme, a technique which integrates music with movement. Monk says that it &quot;has influenced everything I&#x27;ve done. It&#x27;s why dance and movement and film are so integral to my music. It&#x27;s why I see music so visually.&quot;

==Career==
Meredith Monk is primarily known for her vocal innovations, including a wide range of extended techniques, which she first developed in her solo performances prior to forming her own ensemble. In December 1961, she appeared at the Actor&#x27;s Playhouse in Greenwich Village (NYC) as a solo dancer in an off-Broadway children&#x27;s musical theater adaptation of Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, entitled &quot;Scrooge&quot; (music and lyrics by Norman Curtis; directed and choreographed by Patricia Taylor Curtis). In 1964, Monk graduated from Sarah Lawrence College after studying with Beverly Schmidt Blossom, and in 1968 she founded The House, a company dedicated to an interdisciplinary approach to performance. Monk&#x27;s performances have influenced many artists, including Bruce Nauman, whom she met in San Francisco in 1968.

In 1978, Monk formed The Meredith Monk &amp; Vocal Ensemble (modeled after similar ensembles of musical colleagues, such as Steve Reich and Philip Glass), to explore new and wider vocal textures and forms, which often were contrasted with minimal instrumental textures. Monk began a long-standing relationship with the Walker Art Center of Minneapolis, which continues to showcase her work to this day. During this period Monk recorded &quot;Dolmen Music&quot; (1979), her first album released on Manfred Eicher&#x27;s record label ECM, in 1981.

In the 1980s, Monk wrote and directed two films, &quot;Ellis Island&quot; (1981), and &quot;Book of Days&quot; (1988). These developed from her idea; &quot;One day during summer of 1984, as I was sweeping the floor of my house in the country, the image of a young girl (in black and white) and a medieval street in the Jewish community (also in black and white) came to me.&quot; Monk tells this account in the liner notes of the ECM-recording. Apart from the film, different versions exist of this piece. Two are for the concert hall, and an album, produced by Meredith Monk and Manfred Eicher, is &quot;a film for the ears.&quot;

In the early 1990s, Monk composed an opera called &quot;Atlas&quot;, which premiered in Houston, Texas, in 1991. She has also written pieces for instrumental ensembles and symphony orchestras. Her first symphonic work was &quot;Possible Sky&quot; (2003). It was followed by &quot;Stringsongs&quot; (2004) for string quartet, which was commissioned by the Kronos Quartet. In 2005, events were held all over the world in celebration of the 40th anniversary of her career, including a concert in Carnegie Hall featuring Björk, Terry Riley, DJ Spooky (who sampled Monk on his album &quot;Drums of Death&quot;), Ursula Oppens, Bruce Brubaker, John Zorn, and the new music ensembles Alarm Will Sound and Bang on a Can All-Stars, along with the Pacific Mozart Ensemble. Meredith Monk has been composer in residence for Carnegie Hall, concluding in 2015.

In an interview, Monk said that her favourite music includes Brazilian music, especially Caetano Veloso&#x27;s recordings, the music by Mildred Bailey (&quot;the great jazz singer from the ‘30s and ‘40s&quot;), and Bartók&#x27;s cycle for piano &quot;Mikrokosmos&quot;.

== Honors and legacy ==

Monk has won numerous awards, including a MacArthur Fellowship and the Creative Capital Award in the discipline of Performing Arts. She has also been a MacDowell Fellow six times (1987, 1988, 1994, 1996, 2001, Winter 2007). She has been awarded honorary Doctor of Arts degrees from Bard College, the University of the Arts (Philadelphia), the Juilliard School, the San Francisco Art Institute and the Boston Conservatory. In 1979, the Supersisters trading card set was produced and distributed; one of the cards featured Monk&#x27;s name and picture. In 1985, Monk won an Obie Award for Sustained Excellence for her contributions to the off-Broadway community.

In 2007, she received in Italy the Demetrio Stratos International Award for musical experimentation. On September 10, 2015, US President Barack Obama presented Monk with a National Medal of Arts, the highest honor in the United States specifically given for achievement in the arts. Monk was given The Dorothy and Lillian Gish Prize in 2017.

Her music was used in films by David Byrne (&quot;True Stories&quot;, 1986), the Coen Brothers (&quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;, 1998), Jean-Luc Godard (&quot;Nouvelle Vague&quot;, 1990 and &quot;Notre musique&quot;, 2004), and in &quot;The Rapture&quot; (1991). Hip hop artist DJ Shadow sampled &quot;Dolmen Music&quot; on the song &quot;Midnight in a Perfect World&quot; (&quot;Endtroducing...&quot;, 1995). French singer Camille paid an explicit homage to Meredith in her song &quot;The Monk&quot; (&quot;Music Hole&quot;, 2008) which in its construction also evoked Monk&#x27;s work. In 2014, her music was also featured in the HBO series &quot;True Detective&quot;.

<text>Cheoljong (; 25 July 1831 – 16 January 1864), personal name Yi Won-beom (), later Yi Byeon (), was the 25th monarch of the Joseon dynasty of Korea. After King Heonjong died without any descendants in 1849, Queen Sunwon chose Cheoljong, aged 19, to ascend to the throne, adopting him as the heir of her late husband, King Sunjo.

Cheoljong was a great-great-grandson of King Yeongjo. He grew up in poverty; even after becoming king, he had little political influence, and the power to govern was held mainly by the Andong Kim clan, the paternal family of Queen Sunwon. The Andong Kim clan&#x27;s monopoly caused nationwide corruption, resulting in a series of peasant revolts in southern Joseon in 1862. As Cheoljong&#x27;s sons all died in infancy, he was succeeded by a distant relative, Gojong.

==Biography==
=== Early life ===
Cheoljong was born Yi Won-beom (), the 3rd and youngest son of Yi Gwang (Jeongye Daewongun), a great-grandson of King Yeongjo of Joseon. His mother was a concubine, and she was a daughter of Yeom Seong-hwa (), a commoner, descended from the Yongdam Yeom clan ().

Prince Euneon was Cheoljong&#x27;s grandfather and a younger half-brother of Jeongjo of Joseon; in 1786, accused of treason, he and his family was exiled to Ganghwa Island. Prince Euneon was killed during the Catholic Persecution of 1801, as his wife and daughter-in-law became Catholic, which was illegal in Joseon at that time; his children remained in confinement on the island until King Sunjo decided to pardon them in 1822. One of Prince Euneon&#x27;s sons, Yi Gwang, was in his thirties, thus married a daughter of Choi Su-chang and had a son, Yi Won-gyeong (); he had another two sons, respectively born to different concubines. The family eventually returned to the capital, Hanseong. When Cheoljong was young, he had little education. At the age of four, he studied the &quot;Thousand Character Classic&quot;; later, he also read some beginning volumes of the &quot;Comprehensive Mirror in Aid of Governance&quot; and &quot;&quot;, but he couldn&#x27;t remember much content from them, and he stopped studying in following years.

In 1836, Nam Eung-jung () attempted to enthrone one of the grandsons of Prince Euneon; the plot was exposed and he was executed. During the death of Queen Hyohyeon (consort of King Heonjong) in 1844, a conspiracy by Min Jin-yong () to enthrone Yi Won-gyeong, Cheoljong&#x27;s oldest half-brother, was exposed and led to Yi Won-gyeong&#x27;s execution. Yi Won-gyeong&#x27;s family, guilty by association, was again exiled to Ganghwa Island.

===Ascension===

King Heonjong died in 1849 and he had no issue, thus the lineage of Jeongjo died out. Some officials suggested that a distant royal, Yi Ha-jeon (), could succeed the throne, but he was eight years old, a descendant of Deokheung Daewongun, and merely an 11th cousin once removed to Heonjong. The grandmother of the late king, Queen Sunwon (King Sunjo&#x27;s widow), preferred to choose the next king herself, from closer relatives. She selected Yi Won-Beom, one of few living descendants of King Yeongjo and a second cousin once removed to Heonjong. She decided to adopt him as the heir and she sent officials to ask his family to return from Ganghwa Island. Yi Won-Beom lived in the countryside as a poor peasant who had no formal education. When he and his family saw the royal messenger coming, they were horrified. The Queen sent the &quot;yeonguijeong&quot; (Prime Minister) Jeong Won-yong () to present the order of the Queen Dowager and persuaded them to move to the Capital. According to the legend, as they were about to cross the Han River, there were flocks of sheep kneeling down as if they were waiting for a monarch, which was regarded as a good omen. When they were about to enter the capital, they were warmly welcomed by the citizens with deafening cheer.

When Yi Won-beom arrived in the palace, he was first made &quot;Prince Deokwan&quot; (), and descendants of Prince Euneon were again regarded as royalty. During their lifetime, Cheoljong&#x27;s parents had no royal titles, so they were respectively honored as Jeongye Daewongun and Yongseong Budaebuin. Some other relatives of Cheoljong also received titles, including Prince Hoepyeong (his eldest half-brother), Prince Yeongpyeong (his second half-brother), Prince Punggye (his 4th uncle and half-brother of Jeongye Daewongun), as well as Prince Ikpyeong, the son of Prince Punggye; Han Gak-sin (), an uncle of Cheoljong and the son-in-law of Prince Euneon, was appointed to be the officer-in-charge of Ikreung, the royal tomb of Queen Ingyeong in Gyeonggi Province.

On July 28, 1849, Cheoljong ascended the throne in Changdeokgung, and Queen Sunwon served as regent for two years. In following years, Cheoljong resumed his studies. As a monarch, he first changed his name from &quot;Won-Beom&quot; to &quot;Yeop&quot; (). However, officials found out the name was too close in pronunciation to that of the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing dynasty in China. To respect the naming taboo tradition, he was renamed again to Byeon (). Cheoljong married the daughter of Kim Mun-geun (a third cousin of Queen Sunwon) in 1851, and she was later known as Queen Cheorin. Queen Cheorin had their only son in 1858, named Yung-jun, but the infant died less than a year later in 1859.

===Reign===
Following the wedding of Cheoljong in 1851, Queen Sunwon ended her regency. However, politics were still controlled by Queen Sunwon&#x27;s family, the Andong Kim clan. Throughout the 14-year reign, Cheoljong became a puppet monarch vulnerable to their control; Queen Cheorin was also from the Andong Kim clan, allowing them to tighten the manipulation, with many Kim family members becoming prominent officials in the government. He officially start his reign in 1852. Having an experience of the agony of peasant, Cheoljong sympathized the commoners, that he donated 110,000 to the commoners during a serious drought in 1853. In 1856, as the national examination was full of bribery and fraud, Cheoljong criticized the situation and ordered to rectify the chaos, but it was in vain. Meanwhile, the nationwide corruption deteriorated in the field of military and agricultural taxes. A rebellion started in Jinju of the Gyeongsang Province in 1862, and it was repressed, with 13 people executed and 19 exiled. However, the rebellion continued to spread across three southern provinces, as well as Jeju Island. It was discovered the rebellion was a result of the corruption mentioned above, so Cheoljong set an office to carry out a financial reorganization, but the reformation turned out to be ineffective.
Joseon implemented an isolation with interaction to few foreign countries for centuries, and Cheoljong maintained that policy. However, during his reign, vessels from Europe, the United States and Russian Empire, often appeared in Joseon&#x27;s territorial waters (at least 20 recorded). In 1850, a foreign boat (nationality unknown) appeared in Uljin County of Gangwon Province, and some Joseon officials were killed by its bombardment before it left. In 1851, a French merchant ship with people from the Qing dynasty visited Jeju Island. In 1852, an American whaler stopped by Dongnae District in Gyeongsang Province; at first, the locals couldn&#x27;t communicate with Americans, and then they found out there were also some Japanese aboard, who were rescued after a shipwreck. In 1854, Russian frigate Pallada entered Tumen River for prospecting, naming Wonsan as &quot;Port Lazarev&quot;; during the process, it was reported that some local residents were shot as the crowd watched the foreign vessel. In 1855, the French sailed a frigate named &quot;Virginie&quot; along the east Joseon coast from Busan to Tumen River and named some of the islands; another English boat named &quot;Sylvia&quot; also arrived in Busan in the same year. In 1856, there were hundreds of soldiers from French army not returning to France after the Crimean War; instead, they sacked some coastal cities in Chungcheong Province and Hwanghae Province. In the Second Opium War of 1860, Beijing, the capital of the Qing dynasty was invaded by an Anglo-French force, and the Old Summer Palace was sacked and burnt down. Beijing was close to Joseon, and as the news spread, it caused disturbance in Joseon. Some nobles and officials fled from Hanseong, and people often wore Christian crosses to protect themselves from foreigners. To get further news from China, Cheoljong sent several envoys to visit Xianfeng Emperor, who fled to Chengde Mountain Resort by the time. After the battle, European countries gained several privileges in China; as Joseon was in the tributary system of China, these countries demanded that they should have a same rights in Joseon, only to be rejected. Then Britain, France, the United States and Russian Empire started to pressure Joseon through terrestrial and naval forces.

From the beginning of the 19th century, Catholicism was illegal in Joseon, but during Cheoljong&#x27;s reign, the persecution was relatively light and the ban was loose. Around 1857, there were about 16.5 thousands of Christians in Joseon. As of 1863, there were twelve Catholic missionaries from France living in Joseon, and within few years, there were over a hundred thousand of Christians around the capital, and some of the court officials became followers. The mother of future Gojong of Korea became a Christian as well. As a reaction to the rapid propagation of Catholicism and the chaotic society, Choe Je-u founded a new religion Donghak to counter foreign influence and gained many followers. Despite the fact that Choe was eventually captured and executed, Donghak continued to spread within Joseon in the remaining century.

As Cheoljong failed to have a male heir for years, other than repressing the revolts, the Andong Kim clan started to persecute royalties. In 1851, Chae Hui-jae () was executed for attempting to enthrone Yi Myeong-seop (), a descendant of Crown Prince Sohyeon who was exiled to Chodo (an island now locates near Nampo in North Korea). In 1860, Prince Gyeongpyeong (the heir of Prince Punggye) offended some members of the Andong Kim clan, lost his royal titles and was exiled to Sinjido, almost causing his death many times. In 1862, Kim Sun-seong () was executed for enthroning Yi Ha-jeon, a distant royalty; Yi Hae-jeon was also implicated, and was exiled to Jeju Island and eventually executed. Yi Ha-jeon was a potential successor to King Heonjong back in 1849, and he showed dissatisfaction toward the imperiousness of the Andong Kim clan, causing them to decide to eliminate him. On the other hand, Prince Heungseon (later Heungseon Daewongun, father of Gojong of Korea) was in poverty like many other royalties, and he was one of the close relatives to Yi Ha-jeon (first cousin-in-law through his wife). Afraid of being persecuted, Prince Heungseon befriended with people from lower classes and often visited kisaengs, acting frivolously and fawning over the authority; this caused the Kim clan to despise him and to be less cautious about him.

Cheoljong&#x27;s mother was from the Yongdam Yeom clan, a cadet branch of Paju Yeom clan. A man named Yeom Jong-su () was from the Paju branch, and he forged his genealogy as well as tampered with the tombstone of Cheoljong&#x27;s maternal grandfather, Yeom Seong-hwa. As there were no other known descendants of Yeom Seong-hwa, based on the counterfeit, Yeom Jong-su became the heir of Yeom Seong-hwa in 1851, becoming an uncle of Cheoljong and an official in the government. In 1861, a member of Yongdam Yeom clan, named Yeom Bo-gil (), who was Cheoljong&#x27;s fourth cousin and living in Ganghwa Island, appealed the scam in grievance. As a result, Cheoljong interrogated Yeom Jong-su and had him executed.

===Death and succession===

According to &quot;Ilseongnok&quot; (&quot;Diary of Self-examination&quot;), since Cheoljong ascended to the throne, he had a weak digestive system, causing a series of chronic disease throughout his life; Cheoljong also had symptoms of asthma and caught cold quite easily. In order to tone up the body, he took a large amount of herbal medicine for years; on the other hand, some other common treatments by the time, such as acupuncture and moxibustion, rarely appear in the documents. Cheoljong died at the age of 32 on January 16, 1864, without any surviving male heirs; he became the last king descended from King Hyojong. The cause of his death is ambiguous, as there was no clear official record about it. Some suggested that the cause of death of Cheoljong could be liver disease or tuberculosis; according to existing documents, however, it&#x27;s still hard to give a certain conclusion to date.

It once again became necessary to search far back in the Jeonju Yi clan to find a candidate for accession, which became a dispute within the court. Cheoljong himself favored Yi Jae-hwang, the second son of Prince Heungseon (his seventh cousin) and his wife, Lady Min, to succeed the throne. Claiming that Prince Heungseon was still alive, making Yi Jae-Hwang an inappropriate candidate, most members of the Andong Kim clan disapproved of this succession. However, Kim Byeong-hak (), a cousin of Queen Cheorin, strongly agreed because he financially supported Prince Heungseon. Queen Sinjeong, wife of late Ikjong (Crown Prince Hyomyeong) and the mother of King Heonjong, was the most supreme royal family member by the time, and she took way the national seal of Joseon; she decided to adopt Yi Jae-hwang herself and was supported by her family, the Pungyang Jo clan. On the other hand, Queen Cheorin, the widow of Cheoljong, believed that she could adopt the royal heir because of her family&#x27;s power, so she delivered a royal order, asking Yi Jae-hwang to succeed the throne. Once Yi Jae-hwang arrived at the palace, Queen Sinjeong was overjoyed and she came out to welcome him in person, despite being inappropriate in court manners; she immediately announced that the new king was the heir of Ikjong, instead of Cheoljong. Yi Jae-hwang thus became the new king of Joseon, known as Gojong of Korea. Upon the accession of Gojong, the father of Gojong was honored as Heungseon Daewongun, who repressed the power of the Andong Kim clan and becoming a dictator himself in the next decade.

===Legacy===

Cheoljong was buried in the Yereung Royal Tomb in 1864, part of the royal tomb Seosamneung Cluster located in Goyang, Gyeonggi Province. Queen Cheorin was also buried in Yereung after her death in 1878. According to the epitaph, there were once that some silverware used in the palace and the shrine of Jeongye Daewongun were stolen; both Cheoljong and Queen Cheorin decided not to pursue who did this, fearing that people may confess under false charges. Cheoljong had 11 children - five sons and six daughters - from his various consorts, but all of them died young. Among them, only the fourth daughter outlived him. She received the title Princess Yeonghye in 1866; as the only living child of Cheoljong, she received much affection from Queen Cheorin. Princess Yeonghye married Park Yung-hyo in 1872 but died in the same year, aged 13 and had no issue.

Upon the death of Cheoljong, there were only two living royalties that were descendants of King Hyojong. One of them was Cheoljong&#x27;s half-brother, Prince Yeongpyeong (b. 1828); the other one was Yi Jae-seong (이재성, b. 1860), son of Cheoljong&#x27;s first cousin, Prince Ikpyeong, with his concubine. Because of Queen Sinjeong&#x27;s decision, both of them couldn&#x27;t succeed the throne after Cheoljong. Prince Yeongpyeong was also chronically ill like his sibling, so Gojong chose a distant relative (10th cousin to Gojong) to be his heir in 1864. Prince Yeongpyeong had a daughter in 1866, who married Hwang Yeon-su () and had issue; the prince himself lived for several more decades and died in 1902. Yi Jae-seong, on the other hand, became Prince Gyeongeun () in 1900, but he lost the royal title in 1907, accused of working together with the anti-Japanese righteous army; he later went missing in 1910. Prince Gyeongeun was the last recorded royalty to be a descendant of Hyojong; while he married twice, he had no known descendants in official records.

According to Homer Hulbert&#x27;s writings in the early 1900s, Cheoljong made efforts to introduce reforms that would tackle issues that plagued the Joseon dynasty, such as banning merchant monopolies, reducing bribery and corruption, and allowing the families of banished men to follow the men into exile. However, these reforms were often not followed as corruption was rampant by the late Joseon dynasty.

<text>Owen Chamberlain (July 10, 1920 – February 28, 2006) was an American physicist who shared with Emilio Segrè the Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery of the antiproton, a sub-atomic antiparticle.

==Biography==

Born in San Francisco, California, Chamberlain graduated from Germantown Friends School in Philadelphia in 1937. He studied physics at Dartmouth College, where he was a member of Alpha Theta chapter of Theta Chi fraternity, and at the University of California, Berkeley. He remained in school until the start of World War II, and joined the Manhattan Project in 1942, where he worked with Segrè, both at Berkeley and in Los Alamos, New Mexico. He married Beatrice Babette Copper (d. 1988) in 1943, with whom he had four children.

In 1946, after the war, Chamberlain continued with his doctoral studies at the University of Chicago under physicist Enrico Fermi. Fermi acted as an important guide and mentor for Chamberlain, encouraging him to leave behind theoretical physics for experimental physics, for which Chamberlain had a particular aptitude. Chamberlain received his PhD from the University of Chicago in 1949.

In 1948, having completed his experimental work, Chamberlain returned to Berkeley as a member of its faculty. There he, Segrè, and other physicists investigated proton-proton scattering. In 1955, a series of proton scattering experiments at Berkeley&#x27;s Bevatron led to the discovery of the anti-proton, a particle like a proton but negatively charged. Chamberlain&#x27;s later research work included the time projection chamber (TPC), and work at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC).

Chamberlain was politically active on issues of peace and social justice, and outspoken against the Vietnam War. He was a member of Scientists for Sakharov, Orlov, and Shcharansky, three physicists of the former Soviet Union imprisoned for their political beliefs. In the 1980s, he helped found the nuclear freeze movement. In 2003 he was one of 22 Nobel Laureates who signed the Humanist Manifesto.

Chamberlain was diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease in 1985, and retired from teaching in 1989. He died of complications from the disease on February 28, 2006, in Berkeley at the age of 85.

Chamberlain plays a central role in Jacob M. Appel&#x27;s Sherwood Anderson Award-winning short story, &quot;Measures of Sorrow&quot;.

<doc id="385871" wikidata="Q336986" url="?curid=385871" title="Thomas Howard, 5th Duke of Norfolk">
<text>Thomas Howard, 5th Duke of Norfolk (9 March 162713 December 1677) was an English nobleman who from 1645 was deemed a lunatic. Born the eldest son of Henry Howard, 15th Earl of Arundel, Howard left England to study at Utrecht University at the start of the English Civil War. While visiting his paternal grandfather at Padua in 1645 he contracted a fever that damaged his brain. He was declared insane and confined in Padua with a physician caring for his needs. He became Earl of Arundel upon the death of his father in 1652.

Unable to coherently manage his English estates, the running of them was given over to his next eldest brother, Henry Howard, who acted in his place. In 1660 Henry successfully petitioned the House of Lords to have the attaindered title Duke of Norfolk restored. Howard, as eldest son in a line descended from Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk, became 5th Duke of Norfolk. He never returned to England, being kept at Padua until his death in 1677.

Howard&#x27;s younger brothers and uncle, William Howard, 1st Viscount Stafford, questioned his lunacy several times. It was suggested that Henry was holding Howard at Padua in bad faith in order to reap the benefits of representing him in England. Parliament unsuccessfully ordered Howard to return in 1659, and two petitions from his brothers in 1675 and 1677 to do the same were turned down. He died childless; his family ensured that he never married so that he could not produce an heir who might inherit his mental disorder.

==Early life and inheritance==
Thomas Howard was born on 9 March 1627 at Arundel House. He was the eldest son of Henry Frederick Howard, Baron Maltravers, and Lady Elizabeth Stuart, the daughter of Esme Stuart, 3rd Duke of Lennox. Howard, like all his brothers, was initially educated at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. In 1641 the English Civil War was brewing and he left the country with his grandfather Thomas Howard, 14th Earl of Arundel. Howard continued his learning at Utrecht University while his grandfather lived in Antwerp. Philip Howard, one of Howard&#x27;s brothers, also went to mainland Europe with his grandfather. Philip went on to go travelling in Italy, where he joined the Dominican Order and eventually became a cardinal.

Howard&#x27;s grandfather, who was created Earl of Norfolk in 1644, never returned to England, dying at his villa in Padua on 4 October 1646. Howard&#x27;s father, who had also been elevated, becoming Baron Mowbray in 1640, inherited the earldoms, becoming 15th Earl of Arundel. Howard in turn took on the courtesy title of Baron Maltravers. His father spent the rest of his life refusing to consent to the 14th Earl&#x27;s will, which left most revenues to his widow Alethea Howard, Countess of Arundel, and attempting to overturn it. His own estates were sequestered twice, in 1646 and 1651. Financial issues and the rift between Howard&#x27;s father and grandmother continued until he predeceased her on 15 April 1652; Howard&#x27;s grandmother chose to leave her inheritance to his uncle, William Howard, 1st Viscount Stafford, rather than to him and his siblings.

Howard was still living in mainland Europe. Succeeding his father, he became 16th Earl of Arundel, inheriting entailed estates including Arundel Castle and Arundel House, but also debts from his grandfather&#x27;s time amounting to . His grandmother died on 3 June 1654, leaving him to succeed her in the baronies of Furnivall, Strange of Blackmere, and Talbot.

==Insanity==
Having travelled from Utrecht to visit his family in Padua in 1645, Howard fell ill there with a fever that caused him brain damage, leaving him &quot;to sink into irredeemable lunacy&quot; according to the biographer John Martin Robinson. There was no specific diagnosis for lunacy at this time, and mental disorders were instead judged by whether the victim could still manage their own affairs. Howard, whose behaviour was similar to that of a toddler, was determined to be a lunatic &quot;by visitation of God&quot;. Howard never left Padua, being cared for by Henry Yerbury, an English physician, and his household controlled by a local Italian, Carlo Theobaldi. The man who inherited his father&#x27;s honours in 1652 was described by a visiting Sir John Reresby as showing:
Being both abroad and insane, Howard was unable to manage his English estates. This role was taken on by his next eldest brother, Henry Howard. When this situation first came about, rumours were spread that Howard was being kept against his will in Padua so that Henry could take advantage of the powerful position left in his absence. His uncle Stafford was one of these, claiming in 1656 that Howard was being &quot;kept in cruel slavery in Padua&quot;. The Venetian Resident in London reported to refute this claim that: The Podestà of Padua reported less diplomatically that Howard was:

Henry managed Howard&#x27;s finances and estates for the rest of his life, fully in the expectation that as Howard was unmarried he would eventually inherit them. The family monitored Howard and his condition, ensuring that he had no opportunity to marry whilst insane so that his malady could not be passed on. In the wake of the English Civil War Henry lived at Howard&#x27;s Albury Park. By 1662 he had compounded Howard&#x27;s debts and was working to restore the Howard family&#x27;s power in Norfolk, which had waned considerably in the last century. He worked on vanity projects for the family, including the restoration of the Ducal palace in Norwich. The entailed nature of Howard&#x27;s properties left Henry unable to access much of the family finances, leading him to bemoan them and his siblings to accuse him of mismanaging the family and withholding money from them.

==Dukedom and death==

Howard&#x27;s grandfather had been nicknamed &quot;The Collector Earl&quot; partially for his interest in obtaining peerages for the Howard family. His ultimate goal was to reverse the attainder of the Dukedom of Norfolk, which had not been completed at the time of his death in 1646. When the Stuart Restoration returned the monarchy to England in 1660, Henry recommenced this endeavour and on 30 August introduced a bill to the House of Lords to have the dukedom restored to his family. This was successful and the (12 Cha. 2. c. &quot;17&quot;) received royal assent on 29 December the same year. Of the more than ninety peers who supported the petition, seven of them were members of the Howard family.

Howard, as eldest son and despite his insanity, received the restored dukedom as 5th Duke, succeeding his great-great-grandfather Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk, who had forfeited the title for treason in 1572. The act was more precisely defined a year later in a new act, (13 Cha. 2. St. 2. c. &quot;4&quot;) on 20 December 1661. On 27 May 1675 Howard&#x27;s brother Philip was created a cardinal by Pope Clement X, and while travelling to Rome to take up service there he stopped at Howard&#x27;s Padua villa. Henry allowed him via letter to take &quot;a good store of silver plate, and some very good moveables&quot; from the guardianship of Yerbury in order to establish himself properly, titling himself Cardinal of Norfolk.

In his later life Howard&#x27;s younger brothers became concerned that he was not insane and that Henry was acting in bad faith. Parliament had unsuccessfully ordered Howard to return to England in 1659, and in 1674 and 1677 the brothers petitioned the House of Commons for his return. The Commons denied these petitions, choosing to believe the testimony of visitors like Reresby and in fear of what allowing such an important but insane man into the country might result in. One of those who opposed the petition in 1674 was Sir Robert Howard, Howard&#x27;s cousin. Responding to a petition from Howard&#x27;s brother Bernard, in the Commons he described Howard as a &quot;sad spectacle&quot;, and argued that returning him to England would be &quot;in some measure ignominious to his family&quot;.

Howard died at Padua on 13 December 1677, ending worries that he would surprisingly outlive his brother. Henry, who had been created Baron Howard of Castle Rising in 1669 and Earl of Norwich and Earl Marshal in 1672, succeeded him as 6th Duke of Norfolk. Howard&#x27;s body was brought back to England a year after his death, being buried at Arundel on 11 December 1678.

<text>Beth Anderson is an American neo-romantic composer. She studied with John Cage, Terry Riley, Robert Ashley, and Larry Austin, among others. She studied at the University of Kentucky, UC Davis, New York University and Mills College.

Anderson is best known in her field for her swales, a musical form she invented based on collages and samples of newly composed music rather than existing music. She told a reporter for &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1995 she named the form based on this definition of the word: &quot;A swale is a meadow or marsh where a lot of wild things go together.&quot;

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Anderson was born in Lexington, Kentucky in 1950 and grew up in Mt. Sterling, Kentucky. Her parents, Marjorie and Sidney Anderson, encouraged her to pursue music. She began playing the piano as a child and began composing shortly after. At age 14 she began studying piano with composer Helen Libscomb. Liscomb taught Anderson the rules of counterpoint, enabling her to compose simplistic traditional music. During her last two years of high school she began to compose serial music, learning from books on the topic.

=== Education ===
Anderson attended the University of Kentucky after graduating from high school. After two years there she transferred to the University of California at Davis. After completing her undergraduate degree she received her Master of Fine Arts Degree in Piano Performance. Shortly before completing that degree, her piece &quot;Peachy Keen-O&quot; was performed at Mills College. Bob Ashley, director of the Mills College Center for Contemporary Music, upon hearing the performance, urged her to stay there and study. She completed her M.A. in Composition there.

=== Later life ===
In California, Anderson became known as one of the prominent &quot;avant-garde feminist composers, critics, and poets.&quot; She married the computer book author Elliotte Rusty Harold on July 28, 1995, one year after they met at a potluck dinner held by the New York Macintosh Users Group. A 1995 &quot;The New York Times&quot; feature story on Harold&#x27;s wedding called her both old-fashioned and conventional and observed, &quot;She giggles often, as lightly as wind chimes. And yet she listens to the band Megadeth when cleaning her apartment.&quot;

<doc id="385876" wikidata="Q301000" url="?curid=385876" title="Aamulehti">
<text>Aamulehti (Finnish for &quot;morning newspaper&quot;) is a Finnish-language daily newspaper published in Tampere, Finland. Established in 1881 by Finnish patriots in Tampere, the newspaper aimed to bolster the Finnish language and people&#x27;s identity during Russia&#x27;s reign over Finland. Throughout the Cold War, &quot;Aamulehti&quot; was accused by the Soviet Union of spreading US propaganda, leading to protests from the Soviet Embassy in Helsinki. In the 1980s, the newspaper&#x27;s parent company acquired and later closed down &quot;Uusi Suomi&quot;. In 2014, &quot;Aamulehti&quot; transitioned from broadsheet to tabloid format.

Until 1992, the newspaper aligned with the National Coalition Party, but it is no longer politically affiliated. Ownership shifted from Aamulehti Corporation to Alma Media in 2003. In 2020, Sanoma corporation acquired Alma Media, thereby assuming ownership of &quot;Aamulehti&quot;. &quot;Aamulehti&quot;&#x27;s content includes regular features and supplements like &quot;Moro&quot; for Tampere&#x27;s culture, &quot;Valo&quot; for entertainment, and &quot;Asiat&quot; and &quot;Ihmiset&quot; for Sunday readers. The newspaper also explores journalism innovation regularly.

Circulation-wise, &quot;Aamulehti&quot;&#x27;s growth was notable, peaking in 2008 when it consistently ranked among Finland&#x27;s top newspapers. However, circulation figures have varied over time. By 2014, it held the second-largest circulation in Finland. The online version also attracts significant traffic, making it one of the most visited websites in the country by 2010.

==History and profile==
&quot;Aamulehti&quot; was founded in 1881 to &quot;improve the position of the Finnish people and the Finnish language&quot; during Russia&#x27;s rule over Finland. The founders were nationalistic Finns in Tampere.

During the Cold War period &quot;Aamulehti&quot; was among the Finnish newspapers which were accused by the Soviet Union of being the instrument of US propaganda, and the Soviet Embassy in Helsinki frequently protested the editors of the paper.

In the 1980s, Aamulehti Corporation acquired the paper &quot;Uusi Suomi&quot;, which they shut down in 1991. &quot;Aamulehti&quot; was published in broadsheet format until April 2014 when the paper switched to tabloid format. Matti Apunen was the editor-in-chief of the paper until 2010. The paper is based in Tampere and serves the Pirkanmaa region.

Until 1992 the paper aligned itself with the National Coalition Party, but it no longer has an official connection to any political party.

Aamulehti Corporation was the owner of &quot;Aamulehti&quot; until 2003 when the paper was acquired by Alma Media, a large media corporation in Finland, for a reported 460 million euros. In 2020, the Sanoma corporation acquired Alma Media, and thus, also &quot;Aamulehti&quot;.

Since 2006 &quot;Aamulehti&quot; has published four weekly supplements — &quot;Moro&quot; (meaning &quot;Hi&quot;, in the dialect of the Tampere region, and devoted to the culture of Tampere), on Thursdays; the entertainment-centred &quot;Valo&quot; (&quot;Light&quot;), published on Fridays; &quot;Asiat&quot; (&quot;Matters&quot;), on Sundays; and &quot;Ihmiset&quot; (&quot;People&quot;), also on Sundays. The paper covers journalism innovation at least once a month.

==Circulation==

Peaking in 2008, &quot;Aamulehti&quot; grew steadily, regularly reporting the third-highest newspaper circulation numbers in Finland. The circulation was 135,194 copies in 1993, reaching 135,478 copies in 2001. By 2004 the paper had an average daily circulation of 136,028 copies per day and 140,802 copies on Sundays, with an estimated readership of 329,000. &quot;Aamulehti&quot;&#x27;s circulation was 136,743 copies in 2005; 138,258 copies (2006); 139,165 copies (2007) — reaching a high-water mark of 139,130 copies in 2008, then declining to 135,293 copies in 2009; 131,539 copies (2010); 130,081 copies (2011); and 114,231 copies in 2013.

By 2014 &quot;Aamulehti&quot; had Finland&#x27;s second-largest circulation and had the fifth-largest estimated readership. In 2010, with 262,947 weekly visitors, the online version of &quot;Aamulehti&quot; was the twenty-third most visited website in Finland.

==Controversies==
Aamulehti deleted 551 stories written by a long time reporter Matti Kuusela. The stories were deleted after Kuusela admitted in his memoir that he had made up parts of his writings over the years.

<doc id="385877" wikidata="Q612665" url="?curid=385877" title="Vrije Universiteit Brussel">
<text>The Vrije Universiteit Brussel (Dutch, ; lit. Free University of Brussels; abbreviated VUB) is a Dutch- and English-speaking research university in Brussels, Belgium. It has four campuses: Brussels Humanities, Science and Engineering Campus (in Elsene), Brussels Health Campus (in Jette), Brussels Technology Campus (in Anderlecht) and Brussels Photonics Campus (in Gooik).

The Vrije Universiteit Brussel was formed in 1970 by the splitting of the Free University of Brussels, which was founded in 1834 by the lawyer and liberal politician Pierre-Théodore Verhaegen. The founder aimed to establish a university independent from state and church, where academic freedom would prevail. This is still reflected in the university&#x27;s motto , or &quot;Conquering darkness through science&quot;, and in its more recent slogan , or &quot;Reasonably self-willed&quot;. Accordingly, the university is pluralistic – it is open to all students on the basis of equality regardless of their ideological, political, cultural or social background – and it is managed using democratic structures, which means that all members – from students to faculty – participate in the decision-making processes.

The university&#x27;s research articles are on average more cited than articles by any other Flemish university. The university is organised into 8 faculties that accomplish the three central missions of the university: education, research, and service to the community. The faculties cover a broad range of fields of knowledge including the natural sciences, classics, life sciences, social sciences, humanities, and engineering. The university provides bachelor, master, and doctoral education to about 8,000 undergraduate and 1,000 graduate students.

==History==
===Establishment of a university in Brussels===
The history of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel is closely linked with that of Belgium itself. When the Belgian State was formed in 1830 by nine breakaway provinces from the Kingdom of the Netherlands, three state universities existed in the cities of Ghent, Leuven and Liège, but none in the new capital, Brussels. Since the government was reluctant to fund another state university, a group of leading intellectuals in the fields of arts, science, and education — amongst whom the study prefect of the Royal Athenaeum of Brussels, Auguste Baron, as well as the astronomer and mathematician Adolphe Quetelet — planned to create a private university, which was permitted under the Belgian Constitution.

In 1834, the Belgian episcopate decided to establish a Catholic university in Mechelen with the aim of regaining the influence of the Catholic Church on the academic scene in Belgium, and the government had the intent to close the university at Leuven and donate the buildings to the Catholic institution. The country&#x27;s liberals strongly opposed to this decision, and furthered their ideas for a university in Brussels as a counterbalance to the Catholic institution. At the same time, Auguste Baron had just become a member of the freemasonic lodge &quot;Les Amis Philantropes&quot;. Baron was able to convince Pierre-Théodore Verhaegen, the president of the lodge, to support the idea for a new university. On 24 June 1834, Verhaegen presented his plan to establish a free university.

After sufficient funding was collected among advocates, the &quot;Université libre de Belgique&quot; (&quot;Free University of Belgium&quot;) was inaugurated on 20 November 1834, in the Gothic Room of Brussels Town Hall. The date of its establishment is still commemorated annually, by students of its successor institutions, as a holiday called Saint Verhaegen (often shortened to &quot;St V&quot;) for Pierre-Théodore Verhaegen. In 1836, the university was renamed the &quot;Université libre de Bruxelles&quot; (&quot;Free University of Brussels&quot;).

After its establishment, the Free University faced difficult times, since it received no subsidies or grants from the government; yearly fundraising events and tuition fees provided the only financial means. Verhaegen, who became a professor and later head of the new university, gave it a mission statement which he summarised in a speech to King Leopold I: &quot;the principle of &quot;free inquiry&quot; and academic freedom uninfluenced by any political or religious authority.&quot; In 1858, the Catholic Church established the Saint-Louis Institute in the city, which subsequently expanded into a university in its own right.

===Growth, internal tensions and move===
The Free University grew significantly over the following decades. In 1842, it moved to the Granvelle Palace, which it occupied until 1928. It expanded the number of subjects taught and, in 1880, became one of the first institutions in Belgium to allow female students to study in some faculties. In 1893, it received large grants from Ernest and Alfred Solvay and Raoul Warocqué to open new faculties in the city. A disagreement over an invite to the anarchist geographer Élisée Reclus to speak at the university in 1893 led to some of the liberal and socialist faculty splitting away from the Free University to form the New University of Brussels (&quot;Université nouvelle de Bruxelles&quot;) in 1894. The institution failed to displace the Free University, however, and closed definitively in 1919.

In 1900, the Free University&#x27;s football team won the bronze medal at the Summer Olympics. After Racing Club de Bruxelles declined to participate, a student selection with players from the university was sent by the Federation. The team was enforced with a few non-students. The Institute of Sociology was founded in 1902, then in 1904 the Solvay School of Commerce, which would later become the Solvay Brussels School of Economics and Management. In 1911, the university obtained its legal personality under the name &quot;Université libre de Bruxelles - Vrije Hogeschool te Brussel&quot;.

The German occupation during World War I led to the suspension of classes for four years in 1914–1918. In the aftermath of the war, the Free University moved its principle activities to the &quot;Solbosch&quot; in the southern suburb of Elsene and a purpose-built university campus was created, funded by the Belgian American Educational Foundation.

The university was again closed by the German occupiers during World War II on 25 November 1941. Students from the university were involved in the Belgian Resistance, notably establishing the sabotage-orientated network Groupe G.

===Splitting of the university===
Courses at the Free University were taught exclusively in French until the early 20th century. After Belgian independence, French was widely accepted as the language of the bourgeoisie and upper classes and was the only medium in law and academia. As the Flemish Movement gained prominence among the Dutch-speaking majority in Flanders over the late 19th century, the lack of provision for Dutch speakers in higher education became a major source of political contention. Ghent University became the first institution in 1930 to teach exclusively in Dutch.

Some courses at the Free University&#x27;s Faculty of Law began being taught in both French and Dutch as early as 1935. Nevertheless, it was not until 1963 that all faculties offered their courses in both languages. Tensions between French- and Dutch-speaking students in the country came to a head in 1968 when the Catholic University of Leuven split along linguistic lines, becoming the first of several national institutions to do so.

On 1 October 1969, the French and Dutch entities of the Free University separated into two distinct sister universities. This splitting became official with the act of 28 May 1970, of the Belgian Parliament, by which the Dutch-speaking Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) and the French-speaking Université libre de Bruxelles (ULB) officially became two separate legal, administrative and scientific entities.

==Organisation==
The Vrije Universiteit Brussel is an independent institution. The members of all its governing entities are elected by the entire academic community – including faculty staff, researchers, personnel, and students. This system guarantees the democratic process of decision-making and the independence from state and outside organisations. Nevertheless, the university receives significant funding from the Flemish government, although less than other Flemish universities. Other important funding sources are grants for research projects (mostly from Belgian and European funding agencies), scholarships of academic members, revenues from cooperation with industry, and tuition fees to a lesser extent.

The main organisational structure of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel is its division into faculties:
*Faculty of Law and Criminology
*Faculty of Social Sciences &amp; Solvay Business School
*Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences
*Faculty of Sciences and Bio-engineering Sciences
*Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy
*Faculty of Arts and Philosophy
*Faculty of Engineering
*Faculty of Physical Education and Physiotherapy
These faculties benefit a wide autonomy over how they structure their educational programmes and research efforts, although their decisions need to comply with the university&#x27;s statutes and must be approved by the central administration.

The central administration is formed by the Governing Board, which is currently presided by Eddy Van Gelder. It decides the university&#x27;s long-term vision and must approve all decisions made by the faculties. The Governing Board is supported by three advising bodies: the Research Council, the Education Council, and the Senate. These bodies provide advice to the Governing Board on all issues regarding research, education, and the academic excellence of faculty staff, and may also propose changes to the university&#x27;s strategy. The daily management of the university is the responsibility of the Rector and three Vice-Rectors. 

As of 2022 the rector of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel is Jan Danckaert, who succeeded Caroline Pauwels (1964-2022), who resigned in 2022 for health reasons.

==Education==

The Vrije Universiteit Brussel offers courses in a large variety of modern disciplines: law, economics, social sciences, management, psychology, physical sciences, life sciences, medical sciences, pharmaceutical sciences, humanities, engineering, physical education. About 22,000 students follow one of its 128 educational programmes. All programmes are taught in Dutch, but 59 are also taught in English. In agreement with the Bologna process, the university has implemented the so-called bachelor-master system. It therefore issues four types of degrees: bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, master after master&#x27;s, and doctoral degrees.

Admission to the programmes is generally not restricted; anyone can subscribe to the programme of his/her choice. However, prerequisite degrees may be mandatory for advanced programmes, e.g., a bachelor&#x27;s degree is required to subscribe to a master&#x27;s programme, and a master&#x27;s degree is required to subscribe to a master after master&#x27;s or doctoral programme. An exception to this is the admission exam to the bachelor in medicine, which is required following ruling of the Flemish government. Tuition fees are low, and even decreased or eliminated for some students with less financial means.

The academic year is divided into two semesters, each spanning thirteen course weeks: the first semester lasts from October to January, the second semester from February to June. Students take exams in January and June. Apart from the Christmas and Easter holidays (both lasting two weeks) that are normally used to prepare for the exams, students are free the week between both semesters and during the summer vacations from July to September.

The university has implemented several quality control schemes in order to preserve the high quality of its educational programmes. Each semester, all students evaluate the courses they have followed. All programmes are also regularly assessed by internal panels and by external international visitation committees. Furthermore, all programmes are accredited by the Nederlands-Vlaamse Accreditatie Organisatie, an independent accreditation organisation charged with the accreditation of higher education programmes in both Flanders and the Netherlands.
===Academic profiles===
The university is included in major world university rankings such as Times Higher Education World University Rankings, QS World University Rankings and Academic Ranking of World Universities.

==Basic principles==
The Vrije Universiteit Brussel considers itself an open-minded and tolerant university. Its central principles are the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in particular the principle of &quot;free inquiry&quot; for the progress of humanity. The latter includes the dismissal of any argument of authority and the right of free opinion. The Vrije Universiteit Brussel is the only Flemish university that has incorporated such principle in its statutes. The principle of free inquiry is often described by a quotation of the French mathematician and philosopher Henri Poincaré:
This principle is also reflected in the university&#x27;s motto &quot;Scientia vincere tenebras&quot;, or &quot;Conquering darkness through science&quot;, and in its seal. The seal of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel displays a beggar&#x27;s wallet and joined hands on the orange-white-blue (the colours of the Prince of Orange) escutcheon in the emblem, referring to the struggle of the Protestant Geuzen and the Prince of Orange against the oppressive Spanish rule and the Inquisition in the sixteenth century.

Another basic principle of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel – also incorporated in the university&#x27;s statutes – is that the institution must be managed according to the model of democracy. Practically, this means that all members of the academic community — faculty staff, researchers, personnel, and students – are represented in all governing bodies. In this way, the university ensures that everyone has a voice in its decision-making processes and participates in its management. This principle must also guarantee the independence of the university and the academic freedom.

==Student life==
The BSG is the umbrella organisation for all other student organizations and acts as the defender of the moral interests of the students. Together with their French-speaking counterparts ACE at the ULB, they organise the annual St V memorial.

These are some of the student organizations at the VUB:
*Studiekring vrij onderzoek: a collective of students from various faculties, promoting free inquiry through the organisation of debates, lectures and more
*Letteren-en Wijsbegeertekring (LWK): for students studying at the Arts and Philosophy faculty

*Vlaams Rechtsgenootschap (VRG): for students studying at the Law and Criminology faculty
*Vrije Universiteit Brussel Model United Nations (VUBMUN): for all students of the VUB.
*We Decolonize VUB: for ethnic minority students at the VUB.

Members of these organizations &quot;(except VUBMUN)&quot; wear a &quot;klak&quot; (Dutch) or &quot;penne&quot; (French).

Furthermore, the VUB has student organizations for students with a specific regional background. They are: Antverpia (Antwerp), Westland (Westhoek), WUK (West Flanders), KBS (Brussels and Flemish Brabant), Campina (Campine), Kinneke Baba (East Flanders), Limburgia (Limburg), VSKM (Mechelen), Hesbania (Haspengouw) and Ibérica (Latin America and Iberian peninsula). There are also several organizations for specific majors within a faculty, such as Infogroep (computer science), Biotecho (bio-engineering), bru:tecture (previously Pantheon) (architecture) and Promeco, Inisol and Business Club (economics). Last but not least there are organizations centered around a common interest, such as the Society of Weird And Mad People (SWAMP, for all kinds of games), BierKultuur (based on the rich beer culture in Belgium) and Liberaal Vlaams Studentenverbond (LVSV, students interested in classic liberalism).

<text>Luc Steels (born in 1952) is a Belgian scientist and artist. Steels is considered a pioneer of Artificial Intelligence in Europe who has made contributions to expert systems, behavior-based robotics, artificial life and evolutionary computational linguistics. He was a fellow of the Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies ICREA associated as a research professor with the Institute for Evolutionary Biology (UPF/CSIC) in Barcelona. He was formerly founding Director of the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel and founding director of the Sony Computer Science Laboratory in Paris. Steels has also been active in the arts collaborating with visual artists and theater makers and composing music for opera.

== Biography ==
Steels obtained a master&#x27;s degree in Computer Science at MIT, specializing in AI under the supervision of Marvin Minsky and Carl Hewitt. He obtained a Ph.D. at the University of Antwerp with a thesis in computational linguistics on a parallel model of parsing. In 1980, he joined the Schlumberger-Doll Research Laboratory in Ridgefield (US) to work on knowledge-based approaches to the interpretation of oil well logging data and became leader of the group who developed the Dipmeter Advisor which he transferred into industrial use while at Schlumberger Engineering, Clamart (Paris). In 1983, he was appointed tenured professor in Computer Science with a chair in AI at the Free University of Brussels (VUB). The same year he founded the VUB Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and became the first chairman of the VUB Computer Science Department from 1990 to 1995. The VUB AI Lab focused initially on knowledge-based systems for various industrial applications (equipment diagnosis, transport scheduling, design) but gradually focused more on basic research in AI, moving at the cutting edge of the field.

In 1996 Steels founded the Sony Computer Science Laboratory (CSL) in Paris and became its acting director. This laboratory was a spin-off from the Sony Computer Science Laboratory in Tokyo directed by Mario Tokoro and Toshi Doi. The laboratory targeted cutting-edge research in AI, particularly on the emergence and evolution of grounded language and ontologies on robots, the use of AI in music, and contributions to sustainability. The CSL music group was directed by Francois Pachet and the sustainability group by Peter Hanappe.

In 2011 Steels became fellow at the Institute for Research and Advanced Studies (ICREA) and research professor at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF) in Barcelona, embedded in the Evolutionary Biology Laboratory (IBE). There he pursued further his fundamental research in the origins and evolution of language through experiments with robotic agents.

From 2018 he started to work in Venice within the context of various European projects, first at Ca&#x27;Foscari University within the Odycceus and AI4EU projects and then at Venice International University within the MUHAI project.

Throughout his career Steels spent many research and educational visits to other institutions. He was a regular lecturer at the Theseus International Management Institute in Sophia Antipolis, developed courses for the Open University in the Netherlands, was Fellow at the Wissenschaftskolleg in Berlin during the years 2015-16 and 2009–10, Fellow at Goldsmiths College London (computer science department) from 2010, visiting scholar or lecturer at La Sapienza University Rome, Politecnico di Milano, the universities of Ghana and Beijing (Jiaotong University) among others.

Steels was member of the New York Academy of Sciences, and is elected member of the Academia Europaea, and the Royal Belgian Academy of Arts and Sciences (Koninklijke Vlaamse Academie voor Wetenschappen en Kunsten),  where he serves as chairman of the Natural Science section.

He received several awards including the best paper award at the European Conference in AI (in 1982), the prestigious Franqui chair at the University of Leuven (Belgium) (2018) and the Calewaert chair at the Free University of Brussels (VUB) (2024) and the EurAI Distinguished Service Award, presented every two years to an individual who has made exceptional contributions to the AI community in Europe.

== Contributions to science ==
The scientific work of Steels has always been highly trans-disciplinary, focusing on (i) forging conceptual breakthroughs in AI, (ii) building the technical tools to work out and develop these breakthroughs, and (iii) developing concrete experiments to turn the breakthroughs into viable new AI paradigms. Since the early 1980s and using this approach, Steels has played a significant role in four profound conceptual shifts: (1) from heuristic rule-based systems to model-based knowledge systems, (2) from model-based to behaviour-based, Artificial Life inspired robots, (3) from static, engineered language systems to dynamic, evolving emergent communication systems with key features of human languages, and (4) most recently from data-driven AI to meaningful AI capable of understanding and forms of awareness.

=== The knowledge-level in expert systems ===
The early 1980s saw a period of high interest in the application of the rule-based paradigm for building expert systems. Expert systems are intended to assist human experts in tackling challenging problems, such as medical diagnosis (e.g. MYCIN) or the configuration of complex technical equipment (e.g. R1) . By the mid-1980s these techniques became widely used in industry and integrated in software engineering practice, but it also became clear that the exclusive focus on heuristic rules was limiting, primarily because of the efforts involved in finding an adequate set of rules (the so-called knowledge acquisition bottleneck) and because of brittleness seen when cases appeared that fell outside the scope of predefined rules.

From 1985 a trend among AI researchers, including Balakrishnan Chandrasekaran, William Clancey, Doug Lenat, John McDermott, Tom Mitchell, Bob Wielinga, a.o., arose to capture human expertise in more depth. Triggered by Allen Newell&#x27;s paper on the need to adopt a `knowledge-level&#x27; analysis and design strategy,  the new generation of knowledge systems used models of the problem domain based on an explicitly represented ontology and employing problem solving strategies to compose tasks into subtasks and solving them. Heuristic rules were still relevant but they would now be learned by first solving a problem using models and inference strategies and by then storing the solution, after some degree of abstraction. The key advantages of this knowledge level approach are more robustness, because the system can fall back on deeper reasoning when heuristic rules are missing, a richer explanation facility because of the use of deeper models, and a more methodical design process including techniques for verification and validation.

Steels played a significant role in establishing this new paradigm in the 1980s, organising a number of key workshops and tutorials, helping to develop knowledge level design methodologies, particularly in collaboration with Bob Wielinga and the CommonKADS approach developed at the University of Amsterdam, and publishing influential papers outlining the knowledge level approach.

With his team at the AI Lab of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, he developed various tools, most importantly the knowledge representation system KRS, which was a frame-based object-oriented extension of LISP with facilities for truth maintenance, meta-level inference and computational reflection. The team applied the approach for building challenging operational expert systems in various technical domains (electronic circuit design for digital telephone, scheduling of Belgian railway traffic, monitoring of subway and diagnosis of nuclear power stations). These systems became used in real operation and ran on the innovative Symbolics LISP machines. It all lead to the creation of a spin-off company Knowledge Technologies (with Kris Van Marcke as CEO) to further channel these developments into practical industrial use. The company was active from 1986 to 1995.

=== Artificial Life and Behavior-based Robotics. ===
Around 1986, after an encounter with Ilya Prigogine from the Free University of Brussels (ULB), Steels opened in his VUB laboratory a second research line to develop a new paradigm for AI inspired by living systems. Because this paradigm rose as a part of the movement towards `Artificial Life&#x27;, it became known as the Artificial Life approach to AI or also, because of the emphasis on behavior, as the behavior-based approach to AI and robotics, as well as the animat approach. The behavior-based paradigm was intended to be complementary to the knowledge-based paradigm, which targets deliberative intelligence, in that it tackles reactive intelligence for real time adaptive behavior of autonomous robotic agents embodied in real world environments. This new research line was at the confluence of several emerging trends happening in the late nineteen-eighties and nineteen-nineties: A revival of cybernetic reactive robots spearheaded by Rodney Brooks, the establishment of Artificial Life shaped as a new discipline by Chris Langton, a renewed focus on emergent computation through self-organisation using cellular automata, models from chaos theory, and genetic algorithms, and the rise of multi-layered neural networks initiated by David Rumelhart and James McClelland.

As in the case of knowledge based systems, Steels was very active in establishing the new paradigm by organising a series of key workshops, conferences and summer and spring schools and by writing some influential papers to define the new paradigm. With his team in Brussels, he worked out hardware platforms (using self-designed processing boards, Lego and simple electronics parts, with Tim Smithers taking the lead) and software platforms including PDL (Process Description Language). He also set up various robotic experiments, the most important one being the self-sufficiency experiment, initiated with ethologist David McFarland.

The self-sufficiency experiment was based on Walter Grey&#x27;s electric tortoise experiment from the 1950s. This experiment featured simple automatons (animats) capable of wall following, phototaxis and finding and using a charging station. The McFarland-Steels experiment added the additional challenge of having multiple competing robots and competition for the energy in the charging station so that the robots had to do work. The experimental setup functioned for a decade as a framework for experiments in adaptive behavior, genetic algorithms and reinforcement learning by several generations of students at the VUB AI Lab with Andreas Birk taking the lead.

=== Fluid Construction Grammar and the evolution of language in artificial systems ===
In 1995, after a visit to the Sony Computer Science Laboratory in Tokyo at the invitation of Mario Tokoro, Steels opened a new chapter in his research endeavours, bringing the evolutionary thinking from Artificial Life and the advances in behavior-based robotics to bear on the question how it could be possible for a population of agents to autonomously self-organise an evolving adaptive language to communicate about the world as perceived through their sensory-motor apparatus. A new team of collaborators was set up at the VUB AI lab and at the newly founded Sony Computer Science Laboratory in Paris and worked for two decades (from 1995 to 2015) on this topic.

The first breakthroughs were reached around 1996 in the domain of phonetics and phonology. Steels proposed a self-organisation approach to the origins of speech sounds and phonetic structures. Experiments were set up in which a population of agents, equipped with a basic vocal apparatus and auditory system, developed a shared inventory of speech sounds by playing imitation games, introducing variations generating new sounds and adapting to the sounds of others. These experiments were worked out in the ph.D dissertations of Bart de Boer, and Pierre-Yves Oudeyer.

In parallel, Steels proposed in 1995 the Naming Game to study the origins of linguistic conventions in general and the formation of lexicons in particular. The Naming Game is a language game played by a population of agents. In each interaction the speaker chooses a topic and uses one or more words to draw attention of the listener to the topic. The game is a success if the reader pays attention to the topic chosen by the listener and both agents reinforce their existing inventory. Otherwise, speakers may invent new words, listeners adopt new words, and both change the associative scores between words and meanings in their respective inventories. In a concrete experiment, agents start without an initial vocabulary and gradually invent new words and coordinate their usage of words in local interactions. Nevertheless, a coherent vocabulary gradually emerges and gets maintained when the population changes or new topics come up.

In 1996 Steels introduced the Discrimination Game as a way to study the origins of meanings and later on (in 2014) the Syntax Game for studying the emergence of syntax. The Language Game paradigm has been productive to study a wide range of issues in the emergence and evolution of language, first in theoretical work, with mathematical proofs that populations can indeed reach coherence (achieved in 2005 by Bart de Vylder and Karl Tuyls) and with the discovery of scaling laws in relation to the growth of populations and the growth of possible topics (achieved in 2007 by Andrea Baronchelli  and Vittorio Loreto).

Progressively the complexity of the emergent languages increased to include the emergence of morphology and syntax and more and more conceptual domains were tackled. Thus Steels has done in-depth research on color languages (with Tony Belpaeme and Joris Bleys), case systems (with Remi van Trijp and Pieter Wellens), spatial language (with Martin Loetzsch and Michael Spranger), agreement systems (with Katrien Beuls ), determiners (with Simon Pauw) and action languages (with Martin Loetzsch, Michael Spranger and Sebastian Höfer. Many of these achievements were shown to work in robotic experiments, first on simple lego-vehicles, then with vision-based agents in the &#x27;Talking Heads Experiment&#x27; and later on with the 4-legged Sony AIBO robot and the Sony humanoid robot QRIO.

In addition to the scientific research, Steels pushed the language game paradigm by the organisation of various summer schools (Erice 2004 &amp; 2006, Cortona 2009 &amp; 2013 and Como 2016), the founding of the Evolution of communication journal, the publication of key papers and collections of research works on language evolution. Steels also pushed forward the development and spreading of tools, in particular a software platform for doing experiments in language emergence called BABEL and a formalism for representing emergent grammars called Fluid Construction Grammar (FCG). Starting from 2000, Fluid Construction Grammar has gone through many design iterations to become the main operational paradigm for implementing computational construction grammar today.

=== Understanding and Awareness ===
From around 2018 at the peak of advancements and applications in data-driven neural network style AI, Steels began to participate in efforts to create a more balanced human-centric (also called human-centered) form of AI. Together with Ramon Lopez de Mantaras he launched in 2018 the &#x27;Barcelona declaration for the proper development and usage of artificial intelligence in Europe.&#x27; that influenced the European Ethical Guidelines for Trustworthy AI published in 2019. He also initiated the ethical AI workpackage in the large-scale AI4EU coordination project of the EU commission.

Arguing that we need more than regulations to make AI more human-centered Steels launched a number of projects to combine reactive intelligence (captured through neural network style systems) with the deliberative intelligence that was the focal point of earlier symbolic AI research. Concretely, the EU project MUHAI focuses on how the level of understanding in AI systems could be increased by building rich models of problem domains and problem situations and integrating a variety of knowledge sources (ontologies, language, vision and action, mental simulation, episodic memory and context models), and the EU project VALAWAI focuses on how AI systems can be made &#x27;value-aware&#x27; by introducing attention mechanisms to deal with highly complex, uncertain fragmented inputs, and a component implementing `moral intelligence&#x27;.

== Contributions to the arts ==

The artistic work of Luc Steels has been trans-disciplinary as well, with interests, realisations and writings about the arts, music and theatre.

=== Avant-garde performance and electro-acoustic music ===
In the early 1970s Luc Steels became active in Performance art, and in avant-garde electro-acoustic music. In 1972 he founded the collective &#x27;Dr. Buttock&#x27;s players pool&#x27;, participated in the Welfare State theatre in 1977 and with performance artist Hugo Roelandt. In the music domain, he was part of the 1970s Antwerp Free Music scene, playing guitar in a style pioneered by Derek Bailey. In 1971 he co-founded the ensemble Mishalle-Geladi-Steels (MGS) with saxophonist Luc Mishalle and electronic musician Paul Mishalle. The ensemble frequently performed with the Studio for New Music set up by Joris De Laet, particularly at the ICC in Antwerp. Lifelong interactions originated from this period with artist Anne-Mie Van Kerckhoven, who Steels had invited as artist in residence at the University of Antwerp and later at the VUB AI laboratory in Brussels, and Peter Beyls, who was also artist in residence at the VUB AI Lab.

=== Art installations and cooperations ===
After a period of total focus on scientific work while in the United States, Luc Steels returned to artistic activities from the 1980s onwards. Thanks to an encounter with H-U Obrist at the Burda Akademie symposium in Munich in 1995, he came into contact with a new generation of artists, resulting in public presentations in art contexts such as at the Bridge the Gap encounters (2001 Kitakyushu), the Memory Marathon (Serpentine Gallery, London, 2007 &amp; 2012), and the Experiment Marathon (Reykjavik 2008). Within this artistic network Steels collaborated with several artists for the co-creation of new works, including with Carsten Holler (for the CapC Musee in Bordeaux and the Koelnerische Kunstverein); with Olafur Eliasson for a piece &#x27;Look into the box&#x27; for the Musee d&#x27;art moderne in Paris in 2002 and later shown at the Festival dei 2 Mondi (Spoleto, 2003), the ExploraScience Museum (Tokyo, 2006), ), and other locations; with Sissel Tolaas for work shown at the Berlin Biennale; with Anne-Mie van Kerckhoven at the NeuerAachenerKunstverein; and with Armin Linke and Giuliana Bruno for the New Alphabeth (Stop Making Sense) exhibition at the Haus der Kulturen der Welt (Berlin); Steels participated with his own installations in various art-science exhibitions, the most important ones being Laboratorium curated by H-U Obrist and B. Vanderlinden in Antwerp in 1999, and N01SE in Cambridge (Kettle&#x27;s Yard) and London (Wellcome Gallery) in 2000, curated by Adam Lowe and Simon Schaffer.

=== Theatre and opera ===
The life-long interest of Luc Steels in performance and theatre was rekindled in 2004 by a collaboration with theatre director Jean-Francois Peyret on a commissioned play about the Russian mathematician Sofya Kovalevskaya for the Avignon Theatre Festival 2005 and performed in 2006 at the French National Theatre (Chaillot) in Paris. From 2010, music and theatre came together in two opera projects with neuroscientist Oscar Vilarroya as libretist and Luc Steels as composer. The first opera entitled Casparo premiered at the Palau de la Musica in Barcelona in 2011 and was later performed in Brussels (Theatre Moliere) 2013, Tokyo (Sony Concert Hall) in 2013, Leuven BE (Iers College) in 2014 and Paris (Jussieu Theatre) in 2014. The second opera, entitled Fausto had avant-premiere performances in La Gaite Lyrique (Paris) in 2016 and the Monnaie Opera House (Brussels in 2017) with full performances at the And&amp;MindGate Festival (Leuven BE, 2018) and at the Homo Roboticus event at the Brussels Monnaie Opera House in 2019. Most of these performances were conducted by Kris Stroobants with the Frascati Symphonic Orchestra, the choir La Folia, and various solists, including Reinoud van Mechelen and Pablo Lopez Martin (Mallorca opera). The operas are written in a neo-classical, post modern musical style and elaborate societal and trans-humanistic issues raised by the use of Artificial Intelligence, including the occurrence of a singularity and the possibility of immortality through virtual agents.
=== Essays and art curation ===
Luc Steels curated a number of international exhibitions, including Intensive Science at La Maison Rouge in Paris (in 2006 and 2008), artes@ijcai at the Centro Borges in Buenos Aires (Argentina) in 2015 and the &#x27;Aqua Granda. Una Memoria Digitale&#x27; exhibition at the Science Gallery Venice in 2021.

He contributed with essays on art and music for journals such as KunstForum and Janus Magazine (Issue 20), and for exhibition catalogs, He also wrote academic papers on computer music and art interpretation.

In 2020, Steels was S+T+ARTS &#x27;scientist in residence&#x27; at the Luc Tuymans art studio, &#x27;Studio Tuymans&#x27; in Antwerp, which resulted in an exhibition at the BOZAR museum in Brussels based on the use of AI methods to interpret a single art work by painter Luc Tuymans called &#x27;Secrets&#x27;.

In 2023, Luc Steels curated an exhibition &#x27;Science on the Edge of Chaos&#x27; at the Royal Library in Brussels, focused on research during the 1980s and 1990s about chaos theory and its application in different sciences.

<text>A magneto-optical drive is a kind of optical disc drive capable of writing and rewriting data upon a magneto-optical disc. 130 mm (5.25 in) and 90 mm (3.5 in) discs are the most common sizes. 

In 1983, just a year after the introduction of the compact disc, Kees Schouhamer Immink and Joseph Braat presented the first experiments with erasable magneto-optical compact discs during the 73rd AES 
Convention in Eindhoven. The technology was introduced commercially in 1985. Although optical, they normally appear as hard disk drives to an operating system and can be formatted with any file system. Magneto-optical drives were common in some countries, such as Japan, but have fallen into disuse.

==Overview==

Early drives are 130 mm and have the size of full-height 130 mm hard-drives (like in the IBM PC XT). 130 mm media looks similar to a CD-ROM enclosed in an old-style caddy, while 90 mm media is about the size of a regular 3-inch floppy disk, but twice the thickness. The cases provide dust resistance, and the drives themselves have slots constructed in such a way that they always appear to be closed. Original MO systems were WORM (write once, read many), and later systems were read/write.

The disc consists of a ferromagnetic material sealed beneath a plastic coating. The only physical contact is during recording when a magnetic head is brought into contact with the side of the disc opposite to the laser, similar to Floptical drives, but not the same. During reading, a laser projects a beam on the disk and, according to the magnetic state of the surface, the reflected light varies due to the magneto-optic Kerr effect. During recording, laser power is increased to heat the material to the Curie point in a single spot. This enables an electromagnet positioned on the opposite side of the disc to change the local magnetic polarization. The polarization is retained after the temperature drops.

Each write cycle requires both a pass to erase a region and another pass to write information. Both passes use the laser to heat the recording layer; the magnetic field is used to change the magnetic orientation of the recording layer. The electromagnet reverses polarity for writing, and the laser is pulsed to record spots of &quot;1&quot; over the erased region of &quot;0&quot;. As a result of this two-pass process, it takes twice as long to write data as it does to read it.

In 1990, a 300 mm disc with 7 GB capacity was made available.

In 1996, &quot;Direct Overwrite&quot; technology was introduced for 90 mm discs eliminating the initial erase pass when writing. This requires special media.

By default, magneto-optical drives verify information after writing it to the disc, and are able to immediately report any problems to the operating system. This means writing can actually take three times longer than reading, but it makes the media extremely reliable, unlike the CD-R or DVD-R media upon which data is written without any concurrent data integrity checking. Using a magneto-optical disc is much more like using a diskette drive than a CD-RW drive.

During a read cycle, the laser is operated at a lower power setting, emitting polarized light. The reflected light has a change in Kerr rotation and Kerr ellipticity which is measured by an analyzer and corresponds to either a logical 0 or 1.

The 130 mm drives have been available in capacities from 650 MB to 9.2 GB. However, this is split in half over both sides of the disk. The 2.6 GB disks, for example, have a formatted capacity of 1.2 GB per side. The 130 mm drives were always SCSI. The 90 mm discs had their entire capacity on one side, with no capability to flip them over. The 90 mm drives were produced in SCSI, IDE, and USB formats. Capacities range from 128 MB to 2.3 GB.

While they were never particularly popular with consumers (the main consumer market was the 90 mm drives), the 130 mm drives had some lasting service in corporate storage and retrieval. Optical libraries, such as the Hewlett Packard 40XT, were created to automate loading and storing of the disks. A self-contained unit holding 16 or more disks and connected by SCSI to a host computer, the library required specialized archival software to store indices of data, and select disks. Popular uses were for legal document storage and medical imaging, where high reliability, long life, and (at the time) high storage capacity were required. The optical libraries could also manually be used on a Windows 2000/XP machine by selecting and ejecting discs under the Computer Management icon&#x27;s Removable Storage Service, but this is cumbersome in practice.

===LIMDOW===

Light Intensity Modulated Direct OverWrite (LIMDOW) technology used a different write technology, which improved on the performance levels of earlier magneto-optical devices.

LIMDOW disks and drives worked on the same basic principle as a standard magneto-optical drive: the write surface is heated up and took on a magnetic force applied from outside. But instead of using a magnetic head in the drive to make the changes, the magnets were built into the disk itself.

The LIMDOW disk has two magnetic layers just behind the reflective writing surface. This write surface can take magnetism from one of those magnetic layers when it is heated up to one temperature; but if it is heated up further, it will take its polarity from the other magnetic layer. To write the data onto the disk, the magneto-optical drive&#x27;s laser pulses between two powers.

At high power, the surface heats up more and takes its magnetic charge from the north pole magnetic layer. At the lower power, it heats up less and takes its magnetic charge from the south pole layer. Thus, with LIMDOW the magneto-optical write process has a single stage, improving write times.

Because the magnetic surface is adjacent to the writing surface, rather than somewhere outside the disk itself, the magnetic writing can be done at a higher resolution, including that of the resolution of the laser spot doing the heating up.

In the spring of 1997 Plasmon launched its DW260 drive, which used LIMDOW technology for a higher level of performance than previous magneto-optical drives. LIMDOW drives that shipped in the second half of 1997 has search speeds of less than 15 ms and data transfer rates in excess of 4 Mbit/s, which are fast enough for storing audio and streaming MPEG-2 video.

==Vendors==

Magneto-optical drives were first offered in NeXT computers. They were later also offered in Canon products.

Sony MiniDiscs are magneto-optical, and Sony produces many other formats of magneto-optical media. , Sony continues to manufacture one type of blank MiniDisc available only in Japan; the rest of the world only has access to dwindling new stock from vendors on sites such as eBay or Amazon. TEAC &amp; TASCAM continued to manufacture MiniDisc decks up until 2020 while Sony ceased production of hardware in 2013.

Pinnacle Micro was a major manufacturer of magneto-optical drives. 3.5&quot; drives were 128 MB and 230 MB. 5.25&quot; drives produced were 650 MB and 1.3 GB (Sierra), 2.6 GB (Vertex) and 4.6 GB (Apex). The Vertex and Apex were non-ISO standard drives and used proprietary media. Pinnacle Micro has ceased production of these products.

LMSI produced 5.25&quot; magneto-optical drives as well.

Maxoptix, a spin-off of Maxtor Corp., was a major manufacturer of 130 mm or 5.25&quot; magneto-optical drives. A current model is the T7-9100 drive, which has a maximum capacity of 9.1 GB and is downward read and write compatible with 5.2 GB, 4.8 GB, 4.1 GB, 2.6 GB, and 2.3 GB magneto-optical disks, and read compatible with 1.3 GB, 1.2 GB, 650 MB, and 600 MB magneto-optical disks. Popular older models of 5.25&quot; Maxoptix MO drives are the T6 Star, T6-5200 and T5-2600 MO drives. Maxoptix was acquired by Techware Distribution in 2008.

Fujitsu was a major manufacturer of 90 mm magneto-optical drives, exceeding 2 GB in capacity, but they have discontinued production and sale of this product category.

PDO Konica Minolta was the last manufacturer of 90 mm 3.5&quot; magneto-optical drives. They had a 3.5&quot; 1.3 GB USB external pocket drive available for sale in the United States and Europe.

==Floptical drives==
Magneto-optical drives are not Floptical drives, which likewise combine ferromagnetic and optical technologies, albeit in a different manner. Flopticals are 21 megabyte 3.5&quot; magnetic diskettes using optical tracks to increase the tracking precision of the magnetic head, from the usual 135 tracks per inch to 1,250 tracks per inch. No laser or heating is involved; a simple infrared LED is used to follow the optical tracks, while a magnetic head touches the recording surface. The drives can also read and write traditional 3.5&quot; diskettes, although not the 2.88 megabyte variety. Flopticals were manufactured by Insite Peripherals, a company founded by Jim Burke.

==Progress==
At the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2004, Sony revealed a 1 gigabyte capacity MiniDisc called Hi-MD. Its recorders can also double the capacity of regular MiniDiscs with special formatting that renders the disc incompatible with other recorders.

As with all removable storage media, the advent of cheap CD and DVD drives and flash memory has made them largely obsolete. Magneto-optical disks in particular were expensive when new, with high reliability but slow writing. Magnetic tape formats like LTO have far surpassed MO media for high capacity enterprise-grade backup storage.

In 2016 a new phenomenon, magnetization melting by photoinduced photoconductors, was discovered in magnetic photoconductors. It was demonstrated that extremely low light intensities in the range of 1 μWcm−2 can be used to read/write magnetic information in femtosecond (10−15 s timescales) allowing high-speed, high-density data storage in principle.

<doc id="385882" wikidata="Q435198" url="?curid=385882" title="Christopher Hogwood">
<text>Christopher Jarvis Haley Hogwood (10 September 194124 September 2014) was an English conductor, harpsichordist, and musicologist. Founder of the early music ensemble the Academy of Ancient Music, he was an authority on historically informed performance and a leading figure in the early music revival of the late 20th century.

== Early life and education ==
Born in Nottingham, Hogwood went to The Skinners&#x27; School, Royal Tunbridge Wells, and then studied Music and Classics at Pembroke College, Cambridge, graduating in 1964. Contemporaries at Cambridge included David Munrow and John Turner. He went on to study performance and conducting under Raymond Leppard, Mary Potts and Thurston Dart, and later with Rafael Puyana and Gustav Leonhardt. He also studied in Prague with Zuzana Ruzickova for a year, under a British Council scholarship.

==Career==
In 1967, Hogwood co-founded the Early Music Consort with David Munrow. In 1973 he founded the Academy of Ancient Music, which specializes in performances of Baroque and Classical music using period instruments. The Early Music Consort was disbanded following Munrow&#x27;s death in 1976, but Hogwood continued to perform and record with the Academy of Ancient Music.

Since 1979, Hogwood and the Academy recorded the first cycle of Mozart&#x27;s symphonies to be performed on period instruments, with Hogwood in the role of continuist. In 1985, Hogwood&#x27;s recording of Vivaldi&#x27;s &quot;The Four Seasons&quot; on L&#x27;Oiseau-Lyre, which rubbed shoulders in the pop charts with Prince&#x27;s &quot;Purple Rain&quot;; the latter was named best film soundtrack at the Brit awards, while Hogwood&#x27;s disc was best classical recording.

From 1981, Hogwood conducted regularly in the United States. He was Artistic Director of Boston&#x27;s Handel and Haydn Society from 1986 to 2001, and for the remainder of his life held the title of Conductor Laureate. From 1983 to 1985 he was artistic director of the Mostly Mozart Festival in the Barbican Centre in London. From 1988 to 1992, he was musical director of the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra in Minnesota.

In 1994 he conducted the Handel and Haydn Society in a recreation of the concert that premiered Beethoven&#x27;s Sixth and Fifth symphonies for the Historic Keyboard Society of Milwaukee.
Hogwood conducted a considerable amount of opera. He made his operatic debut in 1983, conducting Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; in St. Louis, Missouri. He worked with Berlin State Opera; La Scala, Milan; Royal Swedish Opera; the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden, Chorégies d&#x27;Orange and Houston Grand Opera. With Opera Australia, he performed Mozart operas, &quot;Idomeneo&quot; in 1994 and &quot;La Clemenza di Tito&quot; in 1997. In 2009, he returned to the Royal Opera House to conduct the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment in Purcell&#x27;s &quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot;, and Handel&#x27;s &quot;Acis and Galatea&quot;. 2009 also saw him conducting Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot; at the Teatro Real in Madrid, in a production directed by Robert Lepage. In late 2010 and early 2011, he conducted a series of performances of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot; at the Zürich Opera House.

On 1 September 2006, harpsichordist Richard Egarr succeeded Hogwood as Music Director of the Academy of Ancient Music and Hogwood assumed the title of Emeritus Director. Hogwood said he expected to conduct &#x27;at least one major project&#x27; with the Academy each year. He conducted them in a series of concert performances of Handel operas which began in 2007 with &quot;Amadigi&quot;. 2008 saw performances of &quot;Flavio&quot;, and the series concluded in May 2009, the Handel anniversary, with &quot;Arianna in Creta&quot;. In 2013 he conducted &quot;Imeneo&quot;.

Although Hogwood was best known for the baroque and classical repertoire, he also performed romantic and contemporary music, with a particular affinity for the neobaroque and neoclassical schools including many works by Stravinsky, Martinů and Hindemith.

He made many solo recordings of harpsichord works (including Louis Couperin, J. S. Bach, Thomas Arne, William Byrd&#x27;s &quot;My Lady Nevells Booke&quot;), and did much to promote the clavichord in the &quot;Secret Bach/Handel/Mozart&quot; series of recordings, which puts in historical context the most common domestic instrument of that epoch. He owned a collection of historical keyboard instruments.

In July 2010, he was appointed Professor of Music at Gresham College, London, a position originally held by John Bull. In this role he delivered four series of free public lectures on &quot;Aspects of Authenticity&quot; (2010–11), &quot;The Making of a Masterpiece&quot; (2011–12), &quot;European Capitals of Music&quot; (2012–13) and &quot;Music in Context&quot; (2013–14). He was unable to deliver all of his lectures during his final year of appointment due to illness and it was only seven months after his final lecture at the College that he died.

In 2011 Hogwood was a juror for the Westfield International Fortepiano Competition hosted at Cornell University. This was the first fortepiano competition in the United States and only the second competition of its kind in the world. In 2012 he was appointed Andrew D. White Professor-at-Large at Cornell University, for a six-year term of office. He was a member of Lowell House Senior Common Room in Harvard University.

===Editing ===
Hogwood&#x27;s editing work included music by composers as diverse as John Dowland and Felix Mendelssohn. After John Walsh&#x27;s collection &quot;The Harpsichord Master Book I&quot; was rediscovered in New Zealand in 1977 (containing two otherwise new/unknown works by Purcell), Hogwood edited the re-issue on Oxford University Press reissue in 1980. He was the chairman of the new edition &quot;Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach: The Complete Works&quot;, which aimed to publish a complete edition of C.P.E. Bach&#x27;s music in 2014.

He was involved with The Wranitzky Project, dedicated to the study and publishing of the music of Moravian composer Paul Wranitzky (1756–1808). His last editing project was a complete critical edition of piano sonatas by the Czech composer Leopold Koželuh.

===Brahms &quot;discovery&quot;===
In 2012 Hogwood&#x27;s musicological activities came to the attention of a wider public when the BBC and the &quot;Guardian&quot; newspaper announced his discovery of a &quot;previously unknown&quot; piano piece by Johannes Brahms. However, it emerged that the work in question, &quot;Albumblatt&quot;, was already known. The manuscript had been sold at public auction in April 2011, where it was described as &quot;unpublished&quot; and &quot;of great importance,&quot; and the manuscript was reproduced in full in the catalogue. The work had been given its premiere by Craig Sheppard on 28 April 2011. Sheppard reportedly described the newspaper claim as &quot;fatuous&quot;. Hogwood&#x27;s edition of the piece was published by Bärenreiter in February 2012 along with the Horn Trio in E-flat major, Op. 40, which is thematically related.

==Death==
Hogwood died in Cambridge on 24 September 2014, fourteen days after his 73rd birthday, from a brain tumour. Shortly before his death, he had separated from his civil partner, the film director Anthony Fabian.

==Honours==
At the time of his death, Hogwood was Honorary Professor of Music in the University of Cambridge, Consultant Visiting Professor of historical performance in the Royal Academy of Music and visiting professor at King&#x27;s College London. He was Honorary Fellow of both Jesus College, Cambridge and Pembroke College, Cambridge.

In 1989 Hogwood was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). 
He was a recipient of the Halle Handel Prize in 2008. In 2011, he was awarded the IRC Harrison Medal of the Society for Musicology in Ireland.

<text>A random ballot or random dictatorship is a randomized electoral system where the election is decided on the basis of a single randomly-selected ballot. A closely-related variant is called random serial (or sequential) dictatorship, which repeats the procedure and draws another ballot if multiple candidates are tied on the first ballot.

Random dictatorship was first described in 1977 by Allan Gibbard, who showed it to be the unique social choice rule that treats all voters equally while still being strategyproof in all situations. Its application to elections was first described in 1984 by Akhil Reed Amar.

The rule is rarely, if ever, proposed as a genuine electoral system, as such a method (in Gibbard&#x27;s words) &quot;leaves too much to chance&quot;. However, the rule is often used as a tiebreaker to encourage voters to cast honest ballots, and is sometimes discussed as a thought experiment.

== Random dictatorship and random serial dictatorship ==
The dictatorship rule is obviously unfair, but it has a variant that is fair in expectation. In the random dictatorship (RD) rule, one of the voters is selected uniformly at random, and the alternative most preferred by that voter is selected. This is one of the common rules for random social choice. When used in multi-constituency bodies, it is sometimes called random ballot.

Similarly to dictatorship, random dictatorship too should handle the possibility of indifferences; the common solution is to extend it to random serial dictatorship (RSD), also called random priority. In this mechanism, a random permutation of the voters is selected, and each voter in turn narrows the existing alternatives to the ones they most prefer, from the ones still available. It is a common mechanism in allocating indivisible objects among agents; see random priority item allocation.

===Properties===
Allan Gibbard proved the random dictatorship theorem. It says that RD is the only rule that satisfies the following three properties:

* Anonymity: the lottery does not discriminate in advance between different voters.
* Strategyproofness: any false report by an agent results in an outcome that is weakly stochastically dominated.
* Ex post Pareto-efficiency: the outcome is Pareto-efficient.
** In fact, with strict preferences, RD satisfies a stronger efficiency property called &quot;SD-efficiency&quot;: the resulting lottery is not stochastically dominated. With weak preferences, RSD satisfies ex-post efficiency, but violates SD-efficiency.
** Even with strict preferences, RD violates the stronger property called PC-efficiency: the resulting lottery might be dominated in the sense of pairwise-comparisons (for each agent, the probability that another lottery yields a better alternative than the RD lottery is larger than the other way around).

RD also satisfies a property called agenda consistency. It is the only rule satisfying the following properties:

* Strong contraction consistency (&quot;regularity&quot;): probabilities cannot decrease when removing arbitrary alternatives.
* Ex-post efficiency.
* A probabilistic version of independence of irrelevant alternatives.

Subsequent research have provided alternative proofs, as well as various extensions. One impossibility result relates to extending the theorem to weak preferences. It says that, with weak preferences, the properties of anonymity, SD-efficiency and SD-strategyproofness are incompatible when there are at least 4 agents and 4 alternatives.

RD satisfies an axiom called &quot;population consistency&quot;, and an axiom called &quot;cloning-consistency&quot;, but violates &quot;composition consistency&quot;.

=== Computation ===
It is easy to implement both the RD and the RSD mechanisms in practice: just pick a random voter, or a random permutation, and let each dictator in turn pick the best option. However, sometimes one wants to compute in advance, what is the probability that a certain alternative would be chosen. With RD (when the preferences are strict), this is easy too: the probability that alternative &quot;x&quot; is chosen equals the number of voters who rank &quot;x&quot; first, divided by the total number of voters. But the situation is different with RSD (when there are indifferences):

* Computing the probabilities is #P-hard;
* There is an efficient algorithm for computing the support (the alternatives chosen with a positive probability);
* There are algorithms with tractable parameterized complexity, where the parameters are: number of objects, number of alternatives, and number of voter types.
* There is an exponential-time algorithm for computing the probabilities in the context of fractional approval voting.

===For multimember bodies===
If the random ballot is used to select the members of a multi-constituency body, it can create a kind of proportional representation on average across elections. If the winner of each race is chosen randomly, then as the number of seats in a legislature grows, the percentage representation of each party in the elected body will get closer and closer to their actual proportion of the vote across the entire electorate. At the same time, the chance of a randomly selected highly unrepresentative body diminishes.

For example, say a minority party has 1% of the vote. This party would, in a 50-person assembly, have a vanishingly small chance of winning a majority. Using the binomial distribution, the probability is given by:

:formula_1

==Randomness in other electoral systems==
There are various other elements of randomness (other than tie-breaking) in existing electoral systems.

===Order of listed candidates===
It is often observed that candidates who are placed in a high position on the ballot-paper will receive extra votes as a result, from voters who are apathetic (especially in elections with compulsory voting) or who have a strong preference for a party but are indifferent among individual candidates representing that party (when there are two or more). For this reason, many societies have abandoned traditional alphabetical listing of candidates on the ballot in favour of either ranking by the parties (e.g., the Australian Senate), placement by lot, or rotation (e.g. the Hare-Clark STV-PR system used in Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory). When candidates are ordered by lot on the ballot, the advantage of donkey voting can be decisive in a close race.

===Transfer votes===
In some single transferable vote (STV) systems of proportional representation, an elected candidate&#x27;s surplus of votes over and above the quota is transferred by selecting the required number of ballot papers at random. Thus, if the quota is 1,000 votes, a candidate who polls 1,200 first preference votes has a surplus of 200 votes that s/he does not need. In some STV systems (Ireland since 1922, and Australia from 1918 to 1984), electoral officials select 200 ballot-papers randomly from the 1,200. However, this has been criticised since it is not replicable if a recount is required. As a result, Australia has adopted a variant of fractional transfer, a.k.a. the &quot;Gregory method&quot;, by which all 1,200 ballot-papers are transferred but are marked down in value to 0.1666 (one-sixth) of a vote each. This means that 1,000 votes &quot;stay with&quot; the elected candidate, while the value of the 1,200 ballot-papers transferred equals only 200 votes.

===Selecting winners===
Sortition is a voting method whichrather than choosing ballotschooses candidates directly by lot, with no input from the voters (except perhaps a nominating or screening process). This is not the same as random ballot, since random ballot is weighted in favor of candidates who receive more votes. Random ballot would behave identically to random winner only if all candidates received the same number of votes.

<doc id="385892" wikidata="Q17081451" url="?curid=385892" title="Identity-based encryption">
<text>Identity-based encryption (IBE), is an important primitive of identity-based cryptography. As such it is a type of public-key encryption in which the public key of a user is some unique information about the identity of the user (e.g. a user&#x27;s email address). This means that a sender who has access to the public parameters of the system can encrypt a message using e.g. the text-value of the receiver&#x27;s name or email address as a key. The receiver obtains its decryption key from a central authority, which needs to be trusted as it generates secret keys for every user.

Identity-based encryption was proposed by Adi Shamir in 1984. He was however only able to give an instantiation of identity-based signatures. Identity-based encryption remained an open problem for many years.

The pairing-based Boneh–Franklin scheme and Cocks&#x27;s encryption scheme based on quadratic residues both solved the IBE problem in 2001.

== Usage ==
Identity-based systems allow any party to generate a public key from a known identity value such as an ASCII string. A trusted third party, called the Private Key Generator (PKG), generates the corresponding private keys. To operate, the PKG first publishes a master public key, and retains the corresponding master private key (referred to as &quot;master key&quot;). Given the master public key, any party can compute a public key corresponding to the identity by combining the master public key with the identity value. To obtain a corresponding private key, the party authorized to use the identity &quot;ID&quot; contacts the PKG, which uses the master private key to generate the private key for identity &quot;ID&quot;.

As a result, parties may encrypt messages (or verify signatures) with no prior distribution of keys between individual participants. This is extremely useful in cases where pre-distribution of authenticated keys is inconvenient or infeasible due to technical restraints. However, to decrypt or sign messages, the authorized user must obtain the appropriate private key from the PKG. A caveat of this approach is that the PKG must be highly trusted, as it is capable of generating any user&#x27;s private key and may therefore decrypt (or sign) messages without authorization. Because any user&#x27;s private key can be generated through the use of the third party&#x27;s secret, this system has inherent key escrow. A number of variant systems have been proposed which remove the escrow including certificate-based encryption, secure key issuing cryptography and certificateless cryptography.
The steps involved are depicted in this diagram:

== Protocol framework ==
Dan Boneh and Matthew K. Franklin defined a set of four algorithms that form a complete IBE system:
* Setup: This algorithm is run by the PKG one time for creating the whole IBE environment. The master key is kept secret and used to derive users&#x27; private keys, while the system parameters are made public. It accepts a security parameter formula_1 (i.e. binary length of key material) and outputs:
# A set formula_2 of system parameters, including the message space and ciphertext space formula_3 and formula_4,
# a master key formula_5.

* Extract: This algorithm is run by the PKG when a user requests his private key. Note that the verification of the authenticity of the requestor and the secure transport of formula_6 are problems with which IBE protocols do not try to deal. It takes as input formula_2, formula_5 and an identifier formula_9 and returns the private key formula_6 for user formula_11.
* Encrypt: Takes formula_2, a message formula_13 and formula_9 and outputs the encryption formula_15.
* Decrypt: Accepts formula_6, formula_2 and formula_15 and returns formula_13.

=== Correctness constraint ===
In order for the whole system to work, one has to postulate that:

:formula_20

== Encryption schemes ==
The most efficient identity-based encryption schemes are currently based on bilinear pairings on elliptic curves, such as the Weil or Tate pairings. The first of these schemes was developed by Dan Boneh and Matthew K. Franklin (2001), and performs probabilistic encryption of arbitrary ciphertexts using an Elgamal-like approach. Though the Boneh-Franklin scheme is provably secure, the security proof rests on relatively new assumptions about the hardness of problems in certain elliptic curve groups.

Another approach to identity-based encryption was proposed by Clifford Cocks in 2001. The Cocks IBE scheme is based on well-studied assumptions (the quadratic residuosity assumption) but encrypts messages one bit at a time with a high degree of ciphertext expansion. Thus it is highly inefficient and impractical for sending all but the shortest messages, such as a session key for use with a symmetric cipher.

A third approach to IBE is through the use of lattices.

=== Identity-based encryption algorithms ===
The following lists practical identity-based encryption algorithms
* Boneh–Franklin (BF-IBE).
* Sakai–Kasahara (SK-IBE).
* Boneh–Boyen (BB-IBE).
All these algorithms have security proofs.

== Advantages ==
One of the major advantages of any identity-based encryption scheme is that if there are only a finite number of users, after all users have been issued with keys the third party&#x27;s secret can be destroyed. This can take place because this system assumes that, once issued, keys are always valid (as this basic system lacks a method of key revocation). The majority of derivatives of this system which have key revocation lose this advantage.

Moreover, as public keys are derived from identifiers, IBE eliminates the need for a public key distribution infrastructure. The authenticity of the public keys is guaranteed implicitly as long as the transport of the private keys to the corresponding user is kept secure (authenticity, integrity, confidentiality).

Apart from these aspects, IBE offers interesting features emanating from the possibility to encode additional information into the identifier. For instance, a sender might specify an expiration date for a message. He appends this timestamp to the actual recipient&#x27;s identity (possibly using some binary format like X.509). When the receiver contacts the PKG to retrieve the private key for this public key, the PKG can evaluate the identifier and decline the extraction if the expiration date has passed. Generally, embedding data in the ID corresponds to opening an additional channel between sender and PKG with authenticity guaranteed through the dependency of the private key on the identifier.

== Drawbacks ==
* If a Private Key Generator (PKG) is compromised, all messages protected over the entire lifetime of the public–private key pair used by that server are also compromised. This makes the PKG a high-value target to adversaries. To limit the exposure due to a compromised server, the master private-public key pair could be updated with a new independent key pair. However, this introduces a key-management problem where all users must have the most recent public key for the server.
* Because the Private Key Generator (PKG) generates private keys for users, it may decrypt and/or sign any message without authorization. This implies that IBS systems cannot be used for non-repudiation. This may not be an issue for organizations that host their own PKG and are willing to trust their system administrators and do not require non-repudiation.
* The issue of implicit key escrow does not exist with the current PKI system, wherein private keys are usually generated on the user&#x27;s computer. Depending on the context key escrow can be seen as a positive feature (e.g., within Enterprises). A number of variant systems have been proposed which remove the escrow including certificate-based encryption, secret sharing, secure key issuing cryptography and certificateless cryptography.
* A secure channel between a user and the Private Key Generator (PKG) is required for transmitting the private key on joining the system. Here, a SSL-like connection is a common solution for a large-scale system. It is important to observe that users that hold accounts with the PKG must be able to authenticate themselves. In principle, this may be achieved through username, password or through public key pairs managed on smart cards.
* IBE solutions may rely on cryptographic techniques that are insecure against code breaking quantum computer attacks (see Shor&#x27;s algorithm).

<doc id="385894" wikidata="Q238317" url="?curid=385894" title="Miss Earth">
<text>Miss Earth is an annual international major beauty pageant based in the Philippines that advocates for environmental awareness, conservation and social responsibility. Along with Miss World, Miss Universe, and Miss International, it is one of the Big Four beauty pageants.

Miss Earth is a co-host of the United Nations Environment Programme&#x27;s Champions of the Earth, an annual international environment awards established in 2005 by the United Nations to recognize outstanding environmental achievers and leaders at a policy level. Miss Earth and Greenpeace have also joined in the call for a ban on genetically-engineered food crops, promotion of organic farming and advancement of sustainable agriculture. The Miss Earth Foundation has also teamed up with The Climate Reality Project for the &quot;Climate Reality Leadership Corps Training&quot;, conducted by its founder and chairman, environmentalist and former US Vice President Al Gore.

The Miss Earth Foundation works with the environmental departments and ministries of the participating countries, various private sector and corporations, as well as the World Wildlife Foundation.

Since 2002, the pageant has been mainly held in the Philippines, with live broadcasts in more than 80 countries via Fox Life, The Filipino Channel, and Metro Channel.

Titleholders spend their year promoting their specific projects and environmental causes&lt;ref name=&quot;tribuneindithe a.com/2004/20041008/world.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; through speaking engagements, roundtable discussions, school tours, tree planting activities, street campaigns, cleanups, shopping mall tours, media guesting, environmental fairs, storytelling programs to children, eco-fashion shows, and other environmentally oriented activities.

The current titleholder of Miss Earth is Jessica Lane from Australia, who was crowned on November 9, 2024, in Parañaque, Philippines. Her Elemental Court includes:
* Miss Earth Air: Hrafnhildur Haraldsdóttir from Iceland
* Miss Earth Water: Bea Millan-Windorski from the United States
* Miss Earth Fire: Niva Antezana from Peru

==Inception and early history==
Carousel Productions launched the first Miss Earth in 2001 as an international environmental event with the mission of using the beauty pageant entertainment industry as a tool to promote environmental preservation.&lt;ref name=&quot;missearth.tv/about.html&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The pageant was first formally introduced in a press conference on April 3, 2001.

In October 2001, Miss Earth adopted the slogan &quot;Beauties For a Cause&quot;, with the first &quot;Beauty for a Cause&quot; prize awarded in 2003.

In 2003, Miss Earth surpassed Miss International to become the third largest international beauty pageant by number of participating countries. In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, by 2020 and 2022, Miss Earth surpassed Miss Universe, the world&#x27;s second oldest international beauty pageant, to become the second largest international beauty pageant by number of participating countries.

==Programs and advocacy==
The pageant has tie-ins with Philippine government agencies, such as the Philippine Department of Tourism, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, and the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority, most of the tourism and environment agencies, bureaus, and departments of participating countries, as well as international environmental groups such as the United Nations Environment Programme, Greenpeace, and ASEAN Centre for Biodiversity to further its environmental advocacy. The pageant winner and her elemental court travel to various countries, and are involved in projects with the environmental departments and ministries of participating countries. The delegates also take part in environmental presenvation activities such as, but are not limited to, tree planting ceremonies, environmental and cultural immersion programs, sponsor visits and tours.

In 2004, the Miss Earth Foundation was created to further the pageant&#x27;s causes and to work with local and international groups and non-governmental organizations that are actively involved in conservation and the improvement of the environment. The Miss Earth Foundation campaign focuses on educating young people in environmental awareness. Its major project, &quot;I Love Planet Earth School Tour&quot;, teaches and distributes educational aids for school children. Miss Earth also partnered with the Philippine Daily Inquirer&#x27;s &quot;Read-Along Storytelling Program&quot; to educate children on taking care of the environment, awareness on renewable energy, and biodiversity. The Miss Earth Foundation also educates people to act against environmental degradation and environmental protection by following the &quot;5Rs&quot;: rethink, reduce, reuse, recycle, and respect.

In 2006, the Miss Earth pageant started to co-host the United Nations Environment Programme&#x27;s Champions of the Earth, annual international environment awards established in 2005 by the United Nations to recognize outstanding environmental achievers and leaders at a policy level. Miss Earth also joined with Greenpeace to call for a ban on genetically-engineered food crops, promotion of organic farming and advancement of sustainable agriculture.

The Miss Earth Foundation teamed up with The Climate Reality Project in 2016 for the &quot;Climate Reality Leadership Corps Training&quot; conducted by its founder and chairman, former US Vice President Al Gore to create an effective platform awareness on climate change.

In 2022, the ASEAN Centre for Biodiversity (ACB) and the Miss Earth Foundation formally established their partnership by signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) during the &quot;Beauties for Biodiversity&quot; event held at ACB Headquarters in Laguna, Philippines. The MoU was signed by Miss Earth 2021, Destiny Wagner, and Atty. Genalyn Bagon-Soriano on behalf of their respective organizations. Following the signing, there was an interactive learning session in which Miss Earth 2022 candidates discussed various global issues related to fauna and flora. At the end of the event, the candidates expressed their commitment to biodiversity advocacy by issuing a manifesto. The event marked the beginning of activities leading up to the Miss Earth 2022 finale.

===Eco-fashion design competition===
On November 4, 2008, the first Miss Earth Eco-Fashion Design Competition was launched by the Miss Earth Foundation as an annual event for professional and non-professional fashion designers to come up with designs that are eco-friendly. The outfit designs are made from recyclable, natural materials, organic materials, and eco-chic designs or patterns that can be worn in everyday life or are runway worthy.

==Participating countries==

The pageant has attracted delegates from countries and territories that typically frown upon beauty pageants.
In 2003, Vida Samadzai, an Afghan, now residing in the United States, received press attention after she competed in a red bikini. Samadzai was the first Afghan to compete in an international beauty pageant in almost three decades, but the fact that she wore a bikini caused an uproar in her native country. Her involvement in the pageant was condemned by the Afghan Supreme Court, saying such a display of the female body goes against Islamic law and Afghan culture.

In 2005, a Pakistani beauty queen, Naomi Zaman, was the first Miss Pakistan World winner to participate in Miss Earth, and is the first delegate from Pakistan to compete in any major international pageant; beauty pageants are frowned upon in Pakistan.

Miss Tibet Earth 2006, Tsering Chungtak, the first Tibetan to represent Tibet in any major international beauty pageant, made headlines when she drew international attention towards the Tibetan struggle for freedom. She also advocated for the boundaries of acceptable social etiquette towards the 21st century, in a traditionally conservative Tibetan culture, where most grown women wear ankle-length dresses. Nevertheless, her participation in the pageant received approval from the Dalai Lama.

Carousel Productions licensed the Miss Cuba organization in 2007 to select the first Cuban representative at Miss Earth. Ariana Barouk won; she became the first Miss Cuba in several decades, and competed at the Miss Earth pageant. Also in 2007 pageant, Miss Earth made history when delegates from China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and Tibet all competed together for the first time in an international pageant in spite of political sensitivities.

In 2008, the Buddhist Kingdom of Bhutan, one of the world&#x27;s most isolated nations, sent its first Miss Bhutan, Tsokye Tsomo Karchun. Rwanda also sent its first ever Miss Rwanda national winner, Cynthia Akazuba; both of them competed at the Miss Earth 2008 pageant.

In 2009, Beauties of Africa, Inc., the franchise holder of Miss Earth South Sudan sent Aheu Kidum Deng, Miss South Sudan 2009, who stands 196 cm (6 feet and 5 inches), and is the tallest documented beauty queen ever to take part in any international beauty pageants.

Palestine debuted in one of the Big Four pageants in 2016 via Miss Earth when Natali Rantissi represented Palestine with the approval of Mahmoud Abbas, the President of the State of Palestine and Palestinian National Authority, where she made a courtesy call at the Moukata Palace prior to her departure to participate in the pageant. Miss Palestine refused to wear a bikini but was allowed to partake in the events including in the Miss Earth 2016 finale.

Also in the 2016 pageant, the Miss Iraq Organization sent Susan Amer Sulaimani as Iraq&#x27;s first representative since 1972 in Big Four pageants to participate in Miss Earth 2016. She was the only one who wore a dress instead of a bikini during the pageant&#x27;s press-conference.

In the 2017 pageant, Miss Rwanda Honorine Hirwa Uwase appeared in the swimsuit competition wearing a gown, maintaining a long-held Rwanda tradition of not wearing bikinis in public.

Miss Lebanon 2018 Salwa Akar received international press attention when she was stripped of her title in Lebanon, while participating in Miss Earth 2018 pageant after she posted a photo in Facebook with her arm around Miss Israel&#x27;s Dana Zerik and gestured the peace sign. Lebanon and Israel are in a long-standing state of war. As a result, she was unable to continue her participation in the Miss Earth pageant. In a press release, Israel&#x27;s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&#x27;s spokesman Ofir Gendelman, reacted on Akar&#x27;s dethronement and condemned the &quot;Lebanese apartheid&quot;.

Papua New Guinea sent its first representative in the Miss Earth 2019 pageant with Pauline Tibola, becoming the first representative in the Big Four international beauty pageants since Miss World 1990.

In 2020, the 20th edition of Miss Earth marked the entrant of countries such as Bangladesh (Meghna Alam), Burkina Faso (Amira Naïmah Bassané) and Syria (Tiya Alkerdi). It was the second time Burkina Faso participated in the Big Four pageants after Miss International 2019 and first for Syria to participate in major international pageant in several decades after Miss World 1966.

The Miss Iran Organization crowned Hami Zaker in 2021 as its first Miss Earth Iran in which she competed in the Miss Earth 2021 and became the first Iranian woman to participate in the Big Four international pageant. She participated in the swimsuit competition, albeit in a conservative outfit that recognized her nation&#x27;s cultural background.

At Miss Earth 2022, Burundi participated in their first Big Four pageant with Lauria Nishimwe. Cabo Verde (Tayrine da Veiga) and Senegal (Camilla Diagné) also debuted at this event.

In 2024, the Arab nations of Algeria (Sadjia Herbane) and the United Arab Emirates (Noura Al Jasmi) will compete in the pageant for the first time. This will mark the United Arab Emirates&#x27; debut in any major international pageant.

==Host countries==

The pageant was held in the Philippines every year from 2001 to 2009. Miss Earth 2006 was scheduled to be held in Santiago, Chile on November 15, 2006, but the host country failed to meet the requirements of the host committee; the pageant was moved back to the Philippines.

In 2008, the pageant was held for the first time outside Metro Manila.&lt;ref name=&quot;times-weekend/20081116week1.html&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It was held at the Clark Expo Amphitheater in Angeles City, Pampanga.&lt;ref name=&quot;globalnation.inquirer-news/breakingnews/view/20081110-171362/RP-bet-crowned-Ms-Earth-2008&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;abs-cbnnews-entertainment/11/09/08/philippine-bet-miss-earth-2008&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Miss Earth 2009, marked the first time that the final was held outside Luzon; in Boracay in Malay, Aklan.

In 2010, the pageant finally took place for the first time outside the Philippines. The coronation night venue for Miss Earth 2010 was held in Nha Trang, Vietnam.

In 2011, the pageant was scheduled to be held on December 3, 2011, at the Impact, Muang Thong Thani, Bangkok, Thailand but due to flood situation in Thailand, Carousel Productions decided to move the Miss Earth 2011 pageant venue back to Manila, Philippines.

In 2012, the pageant was supposed to be held in Bali, Indonesia but the organizers did not meet the minimum requirements on time, so it was moved back to the Philippines. Miss Earth 2012 was held on November 24, 2012, at the Palace in Muntinlupa, Philippines.

Miss Earth 2015 was held for the first time in Europe at Marx Halle in Vienna, Austria.

On July 18, 2022, vice-president of Miss Earth organization Lorraine Schuck announced that Miss Earth 2023 will be held in Vietnam for the second time.

==Virtual editions==
The COVID-19 pandemic caused travel restrictions that would have the contestants travel to the Philippines and then be subject to a 14-day quarantine period upon arrival. It was announced on 14 August 2020, that the Miss Earth Organization would have to crown their new titleholders at a Virtual event on 29 November 2020 for the first time in the organization&#x27;s history.

The pageant started on 21 September 2020 and ran for a couple of months. On 12 October 2020, the organization held a &quot;Getting to Know You&quot; virtual meet and greet with each delegate hosted by former Miss Earth 2008 Karla Henry. The pageant preliminary was streamed on KTX on 24 November 2020.

The candidates were split into four continental groups: Asia &amp; Oceania, Africa, Americas, and Europe and then competed in the following categories: Earth Talk, Talent, Evening Gown, Swimsuit, Sports Wear, National Costume, and Interview with Netizens. The preliminary judging categories are: Beauty of Face, Fitness, and Environmental Awareness.

The pre-pageant activities and coronation night were conducted virtually due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic for the second consecutive year in 2021.

==Eligibility and judging criteria==

Competing delegates must have never been married or given birth and be between 18 and 28 years of age. In the pre-judging stage, Miss Earth delegates are judged on their intelligence and their knowledge of environmental issues and policies, comprising 30% of the total score, while the remaining criteria are as follows: 35% for beauty and knowledge, 20% form and figure, 10% poise, and 5% attitude. The delegates then participate in three rounds of competition: swimsuit, evening gown and question-and-answer. The last round focuses on topics of environmental concern.

==Titles and semi-finalists==

In the early years of the pageant, from 2001 to 2003, ten semi-finalists were chosen at Miss Earth. From 2004 to 2017, sixteen semi-finalists are chosen with the exception of the 10th (2010) edition where only 14 semi-finalists were selected. The number has since then increased to 18 in 2018 and 20 in 2019. Since 2004, semi-finalists are cut to eight finalists, then to the final four from which the winner and her elemental court are announced. By 2019, the number of finalists were increased to 10.

The pageant&#x27;s winner is crowned Miss Earth; the Runners-up are named after the classical elements: Miss Fire (third runner-up), Miss Water (second runner-up), and Miss Air (first runner-up); from 2010, the &quot;elemental titles&quot; (Air, Water, and Fire bestowed on the next three delegates with highest scores after the Miss Earth winner) were proclaimed of equal importance and thus have the same ranking and no longer classified as &quot;runner-up&quot;.

<doc id="385895" wikidata="Q118976" url="?curid=385895" title="Alexander Nevsky (film)">
<text>Alexander Nevsky () is a 1938 Soviet historical drama film directed by Sergei Eisenstein. It depicts the attempted invasion of Novgorod in the 13th century by the Teutonic Knights of the Holy Roman Empire and their defeat by Prince Alexander, known popularly as Alexander Nevsky (1220–1263).

Eisenstein made the film in association with Dmitri Vasilyev and with a script co-written with Pyotr Pavlenko; they were assigned to ensure that Eisenstein did not stray into &quot;formalism&quot; and to facilitate shooting on a reasonable timetable. It was produced by Goskino via the Mosfilm production unit, with Nikolai Cherkasov in the title role and a musical score by Sergei Prokofiev. &quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot; was the first and most popular of Eisenstein&#x27;s three sound films. Eisenstein, Pavlenko, Cherkasov and Abrikosov were awarded the Stalin Prize in 1941 for the film.

In 1978, the film was included in the world&#x27;s 100 best motion pictures according to an opinion poll conducted by the Italian publishing house Arnoldo Mondadori Editore.

Russia Beyond considers the film one of the 10 best Russian war films.

==Plot==

An army of the Teutonic Order invades and conquers the city of Pskov with the help of the traitor Tverdilo, and massacres its population. Novgorod is their next intended target.

Despite resistance from the boyars and merchants of Novgorod (urged on by the monk Ananias, Tverdilo&#x27;s henchman), an appeal is made to Alexander Yaroslavich Nevsky, to again become their prince and defend Novgorod. To do so he rallies the common people of the Novgorod area. In the decisive Battle of the Ice, on the surface of frozen Lake Chudskoe, the Teutonic forces are defeated. Pskov is retaken, and there Nevsky passes judgment: the surviving Teutonic foot-soldiers are set free, while the surviving Teutonic knights will be held for ransom. Tverdilo the traitor, together with a Catholic priest who blessed the burning alive of Pskov children, disappear as they are mobbed by the onlookers.

A subplot throughout is the rivalry and friendship of Vasili Buslai and Gavrilo Oleksich, two famous (and historic) warriors of Novgorod. Both become commanders of the Novgorod forces, and are engaged in a contest of courage and fighting skill in order to decide which will win the hand of Olga Danilovna, a Novgorod maiden whom both are courting.

At the same time Vasilisa, daughter of a boyar of Pskov killed by the Teutons, joins the Novgorod forces as a soldier. She and Vasili wind up fighting side by side; she throws him a weapon when he is surrounded and weaponless, and it is she who finds and slays Ananias.

Gavrilo and Vasili are seriously wounded and are found by Olga, who retrieves them from the battlefield. Though they defer to each other, in the end Vasili publicly states that neither was the bravest in battle: that honor goes to Vasilisa, followed by Gavrilo. Thus Gavrilo and Olga are united while Vasili chooses Vasilisa as his bride-to-be (with her unspoken consent).

==1930s political context==
Eisenstein made &quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot;, his first completed film in 10 years, during the Stalin era, at a time of strained relations between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. The film contains elements of obvious allegory that reflect the political situation between the two countries at the time of production. Some types of helmets worn by the Teutonic infantry resemble mock-ups of Stahlhelms from World War I. In the first draft of the &quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot; script, swastikas even appeared on the invaders&#x27; helmets. The film portrays Alexander as a folk hero and shows him bypassing a fight with the Mongols, his old foes, in order to face the more dangerous enemy.

The film also conveys highly anti-clerical and anti-Catholic messages. The knights&#x27; bishop&#x27;s miter is adorned with swastikas, while religion plays a minor role on the Russian side, being present mostly as a backdrop in the form of Novgorod&#x27;s St. Nicholas Cathedral and the clerics with their icons during the victorious entry of Nevsky into the city after the battle.

The film stemmed from a literary scenario entitled &quot;Rus&quot;, written by Pyotr Pavlenko, a Soviet novelist who conformed to socialist realist orthodoxy. The authorities could rely on Pavlenko, in his role of &quot;consultant&quot;, to report any wayward tendencies on Eisenstein&#x27;s part.

&quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot; stresses as a central theme the importance of the common people in saving Russia, while portraying the nobles and merchants as &quot;bourgeoisie&quot; and enemies of the people who do nothing, a motif that was heavily employed.

While shooting the film, Eisenstein published an article in the official newspaper of record &quot;Izvestia&quot; entitled &quot;Alexander Nevsky and the Rout of the Germans&quot;. He drew a specific parallel between Nevsky and Stalin. As a result, the Kremlin requested an advance screening and, without Eisenstein being consulted, his assistants showed the footage to the General Secretary. During the process of this screening, one of the reels, which featured a scene depicting a brawl among the populace of Novgorod, disappeared. Whether it was left behind in the editing room inadvertently or whether Stalin saw the footage and objected to it, the filmmakers decided to destroy the reel permanently, since it had not received Stalin&#x27;s explicit approval. Stalin was reported to be very happy with the cut of the film he was shown.

The picture was released in December 1938, and became a great success with audiences: on 15 April 1939, Semen Dukelsky – the chairman of the State Committee for Cinematography – reported that it had already been viewed by 23,000,000 people and was the most popular of the films made in recent times.

After 23 August 1939, when the USSR signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, which provided for non-aggression and collusion between Germany and the Soviet Union, &quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot; was removed from circulation. However, the situation reversed dramatically on 22 June 1941 after the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union, and the film rapidly returned to Soviet and western screens.

==Style==
&quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot; is less experimental in its narrative structure than Eisenstein&#x27;s previous films; it tells one story with a single narrative arc and focuses on one main character. The special effects and cinematography were some of the most advanced at the time.

The film climaxes in the half-hour Battle of the Ice, propelled by Prokofiev&#x27;s ominous, rousing, triumphant musical narrative, a sequence that has served as a model for epic movie battles ever since (e.g., &quot;Henry V&quot;, &quot;Spartacus&quot;, &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;). This climactic set piece was the first to be filmed and, since it was shot during a blazing hot summer on a location outside Moscow, cinematographer Eduard Tisse had to take extraordinary steps to render a wintry landscape, including: use of a filter to suggest winter light, painting all the trees light blue and dusting them with chalk, creating an artificial horizon out of sand, and constructing simulated ice sheets out of asphalt and melted glass, supported by floating pontoons that were deflated on cue so that the ersatz ice sheets would shatter under the weight of the Teutonic knights according to pre-cut patterns.

==Musical score==

The film was the first of Eisenstein&#x27;s dramatic films to use sound. (The earlier &quot;Bezhin Meadow&quot; had also used sound, but production was shut down and most of the finished scenes were destroyed.) The film&#x27;s score was composed by Sergei Prokofiev, who later reworked the score into a concert cantata. The creation of &quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot; was a collaboration in the fullest sense of the word: some of the film was shot to Prokofiev&#x27;s music and some of Prokofiev&#x27;s music was composed to Eisenstein&#x27;s footage. Prokofiev viewed the film&#x27;s rough cut as the first step in composing its inimitable score. The strong and technically innovative collaboration between Eisenstein and Prokofiev in the editing process resulted in a match of music and imagery that remains a standard for filmmakers. Valery Gergiev, the principal conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra, has stated his opinion that Prokofiev&#x27;s music for this film is &quot;the best ever composed for the cinema&quot;.

==Film and concerts==
In the 1990s a new, cleaner print became available. A number of symphony orchestras gave performances of Prokofiev&#x27;s cantata, synchronized with a showing of the new print. The New York Philharmonic, the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, the San Francisco Symphony, the Philadelphia Orchestra, and the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra are five such ensembles. The concerts were quite popular, because Prokofiev&#x27;s music is badly degraded by the original soundtrack recording, which suffers from extreme distortion and limited frequency response, as well as cuts to the original score to fit scenes that had already been shot. The cantata not only restored cuts but considerably expanded parts of the score.

==New editions of the film==
In 1986, the film was restored. The film was cleared, the film studio logo was added, the captions were replaced (only the font, but not the content), the music was re-recorded by Emin Khachaturian conducting the State Symphony Cinema Orchestra.

In 1995, a new edition of the film was issued on VHS and laserdisc, for which Prokofiev&#x27;s score was entirely re-recorded in hi-fi digital stereo by Yuri Temirkanov conducting the St. Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra and Chorus, although the dialogue portions of the soundtrack were left unchanged. This enabled a new generation to experience Eisenstein&#x27;s film and Prokofiev&#x27;s score in high fidelity, rather than having to settle for the badly recorded musical portion that had existed since the film&#x27;s original release. There is no version of the re-recorded score available on DVD.

==In popular culture==
Multiple works have been influenced by or refer to &quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot;.

===Films===
* Scenes from the film were later incorporated into the American propaganda film &quot;The Battle of Russia&quot; (1943).
* &quot;Love and Death&quot; (1975), written and directed by Woody Allen, parodies Russian film and literature. The film used the &quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot; score.
* &quot;Wizards&quot; (1977) uses stock footage from the film in its battle sequences, which were animated using rotoscoping.
* Certain scenes in John Milius&#x27;s fantasy epic &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; (1982) were influenced by &quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot;. The introduction of Thulsa Doom and his henchmen after the destruction of Conan&#x27;s village is reminiscent of the depiction of the Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights and his fellow knights after the conquest of Pskov. With its score and choreography, the final ride and attack of the Riders of Doom against Conan resembles the Teutonic Order&#x27;s cavalry approaching Nevsky in the Battle of Lake Peipus; also, the Enigma of Steel, a major theme of the Conan film, is already mentioned by Nevsky during the final Battle of the Ice.
* In &quot;Red Dawn&quot; (1984), the marquee at the movie theater in occupied America is showing the film.
* Several additional films have scenes strongly influenced by the depiction of the Battle on the Ice, including:
** &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; (1965)
** &quot;Chimes at Midnight&quot; (1965)
** &quot;Billion Dollar Brain&quot; (1967)
** &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980)
** &quot;Mulan&quot; (1998)
** &quot;King Arthur&quot; (2004)

===Literature===
* Tom Clancy&#x27;s novel &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot; (1986) depicts two American intelligence officers watching &quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot; (on an unauthorized Soviet state television satellite feed) on the eve of World War III. The officers take note of an improved sound track, as well as the anti-German sentiment and strong sense of Russian (as opposed to Soviet) nationalism. The next day, as part of a plot to split the NATO alliance politically, KGB agents detonate a bomb in the Kremlin, killing a group of children from Pskov, and later arrest a West German sleeper agent on charges of terrorism.
* &quot;Nevsky: Hero of the People&quot; (2012), a graphic novel adaptation of the film, was written by Ben McCool, with art by Mario Guevara and published by IDW Publishing.

<doc id="385897" wikidata="Q1380706" url="?curid=385897" title="Kevin MacDonald (evolutionary psychologist)">
<text>Kevin B. MacDonald (born January 24, 1944) is an American antisemitic conspiracy theorist, white supremacist, and retired professor of evolutionary psychology at California State University, Long Beach (CSULB).

MacDonald is known for his promotion of an antisemitic theory, most prominently within The Culture of Critique series, according to which Western Jews have tended to be politically liberal and involved in politically or sexually transgressive social, philosophical, and artistic movements because, he asserts, Jews have biologically evolved to undermine the societies in which they live. In short, MacDonald argues that Jews have evolved to be highly ethnocentric and hostile to the interests of &quot;white people&quot;, a racial category of which he considers Jewish people not to be a part. In an interview with &quot;Tablet&quot; magazine in 2020, MacDonald said: &quot;Jews are just gonna destroy white power completely, and destroy America as a white country.&quot;

Scholars characterize MacDonald&#x27;s theory as a tendentious form of circular reasoning, which assumes its conclusion to be true regardless of empirical evidence. The theory fails the basic test of any scientific theory, the criterion of falsifiability, because MacDonald refuses to provide or acknowledge any factual pattern of Jewish behavior that would tend to disprove his idea that Jews have evolved to be ethnocentric and anti-white. Other scholars and antisemitism experts dismiss the theory as pseudoscience analogous to older conspiracy theories about a Jewish plot to undermine European civilization. In 2008, the CSULB academic senate voted to disassociate itself from MacDonald&#x27;s work.

MacDonald&#x27;s theories have received support from antisemitic conspiracy theorists and neo-Nazi groups. He serves as editor of &quot;The Occidental Observer&quot;, which he says covers &quot;white identity, white interests, and the culture of the West&quot;. He is described by the Anti-Defamation League as having &quot;become a primary voice for anti-Semitism from far-right intellectuals&quot; and by the Southern Poverty Law Center as &quot;the neo-Nazi movement&#x27;s favorite academic&quot;. He has been described as part of the alt-right movement. By 2010, MacDonald was one of the eight members of the board of directors of the newly founded American Third Position (known from 2013 as the American Freedom Party), an organization stating that it &quot;exists to represent the political interests of White Americans&quot;.

==Early years==
MacDonald was born in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, to a Roman Catholic family. His father was a policeman and his mother was a secretary. He attended Catholic parochial schools and played basketball in high school. He entered the University of Wisconsin–Madison as a philosophy major and became involved in the anti-war movement, which brought him into contact with Jewish student activists.

Between 1970 and 1974, he worked towards becoming a jazz pianist, spending two years in Jamaica, where he taught high school. By the late 1970s, he had left that career.

==Professional background==
MacDonald is the author of seven books on evolutionary theory and child development and is the author or editor of over 30 academic articles in refereed journals. He received his B.A. from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1966, and M.S. in biology from the University of Connecticut in 1976. In 1981, he earned a PhD in biobehavioral sciences from the University of Connecticut, where his adviser was Benson Ginsburg, a founder of modern behavioral genetics. His thesis was on the behavioral development of wolves and resulted in two publications.

MacDonald completed a post-doctoral fellowship with Ross Parke in the psychology department of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1983. MacDonald and Parke&#x27;s work there resulted in three publications.

MacDonald joined the Department of Psychology at California State University, Long Beach (CSU-LB) in 1985, and became a full professor in 1995. He announced his retirement at the end of 2014.

MacDonald served as Secretary-Archivist of the Human Behavior and Evolution Society and was elected as a member of the executive board from 1995 to 2001. He was editor of &quot;Population and Environment&quot; from 1999 to 2004, working with Virginia Abernethy, the previous editor, who he persuaded to join the editorial board, along with J. Philippe Rushton, both &quot;intellectual allies&quot; according to the SPLC. He makes occasional contributions to VDARE, a website focused on opposition to immigration to the United States and classified as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.

==Work on ethnicity==
===Judaism and Jewish culture===

MacDonald wrote a trilogy of books analyzing Judaism and secular Jewish culture from the perspective of evolutionary psychology: &quot;A People That Shall Dwell Alone&quot; (1994), &quot;Separation and Its Discontents&quot; (1998), and &quot;The Culture of Critique&quot; (1998). He labels Judaism as a &quot;group evolutionary strategy&quot;, one that he claims enhances the ability of Jews to outcompete non-Jews for resources. Using the term &quot;Jewish ethnocentrism&quot;, he argues that Judaism fosters in Jews a series of marked genetic traits, including above-average verbal intelligence and a strong tendency toward collectivist behavior, as manifested in a series of influential intellectual movements. MacDonald acknowledges that not all Jews in all circumstances display the traits he identifies. &quot;Separation and Its Discontents&quot; contains a chapter entitled &quot;National Socialism as an Anti-Jewish Group Evolutionary Strategy&quot;. According to a summary of MacDonald&#x27;s ideas by Heidi Beirich of the SPLC in 2007, MacDonald argues that Nazism emerged as a means of opposing, to use MacDonald&#x27;s term, &quot;Judaism as a group evolutionary strategy&quot;. He contends Jewish &quot;group behavior&quot; created understandable hatred for Jews. Thus in MacDonald&#x27;s opinion, writes Beirich:

==Reception==
===Irving v Lipstadt libel trial (2000)===
MacDonald testified in the unsuccessful libel suit brought by the Holocaust denier David Irving against the American historian Deborah Lipstadt; he was the only witness for Irving who spoke on his behalf willingly. Irving had told the judge that MacDonald would need to be on the witness stand for three days, but his testimony only lasted a few hours. Irving, who argued his case on his own behalf without a lawyer, asked MacDonald if he (Irving) was an antisemite, a question to which MacDonald avoided giving a direct answer, instead saying: &quot;I have had quite a few discussions with you and you almost never mentioned Jews - never in the general negative way.&quot; Irving asked if MacDonald &quot;perceived the Jewish community as working in a certain way in order to suppress a certain book&quot; and MacDonald responded in the affirmative, asserting there were &quot;several tactics the Jewish organizations have used.&quot; MacDonald was quoted as having said in the course of his testimony that he was an &quot;agnostic&quot; in regards to the Holocaust, though he denied the accuracy of the quote.

Deborah Lipstadt&#x27;s lawyer Richard Rampton thought MacDonald&#x27;s testimony on behalf of Irving was of so little help to Irving that he did not bother to cross examine him. MacDonald later commented in an article for the &quot;Journal of Historical Review&quot;, published by the Institute for Historical Review, a Holocaust-denying organisation, that Lipstadt and Jewish groups were attempting to restrict access to Irving&#x27;s work because it was against Jewish interests and agenda. On the Holocaust itself, MacDonald later said that &quot;he ha[d] never doubted the Holocaust took place, but because he ha[d] not studied its history he describe[d] himself as an &#x27;agnostic&#x27; on the subject.&quot;

===Academic reception===

At the time of its release, &quot;A People That Shall Dwell Alone&quot; received mixed reviews from scholars, although his subsequent books were less well received.

John Tooby, the founder of MacDonald&#x27;s field of evolutionary psychology, criticized MacDonald in an article for &quot;Salon&quot; in 2000. He wrote, &quot;MacDonald&#x27;s ideas—not just on Jews—violate fundamental principles of the field.&quot; Tooby posits that MacDonald is not an evolutionary psychologist.

MacDonald has been accused by some academics in &quot;Policing the National Body: Sex, Race, and Criminalization&quot; of employing racial &quot;techniques of scapegoating [that] may have evolved in complexity from classical Nazi fascism, but the similarities are far from remote.&quot;

Steven Pinker, the Johnstone Family Professor of Psychology at Harvard University, wrote that MacDonald&#x27;s work fails &quot;basic tests of scientific credibility.&quot; Pinker, while acknowledging that he had &quot;not plowed through MacDonald&#x27;s trilogy and therefore run the complementary risks of being unfair to his arguments, and of not refuting them resoundingly enough to distance them from my own views on evolutionary psychology&quot;, states that MacDonald&#x27;s theses are unable to pass the threshold of attention-worthiness or peer-approval, and contain a &quot;consistently invidious portrayal of Jews, couched in value-laden, disparaging language&quot;.

Reviewing MacDonald&#x27;s &quot;Separation and Its Discontents&quot; in 2000, Chair of Jewish Studies Zev Garber writes that MacDonald works from the assumption that the &quot;dual Torah&quot;, meaning both the written and oral traditions of Judaism, is the blueprint of eventual Jewish dominion over the world, and that he sees contemporary antisemitism, the Holocaust, and attacks against Israel as &quot;provoked by Jews themselves.&quot; Garber concludes that MacDonald&#x27;s &quot;rambling who-is-who-isn&#x27;t roundup of Jews responsible for the &#x27;Jewish Problem&#x27; borders on the irrational and is conducive to misrepresentation.&quot;

In 2001, David Lieberman, a Holocaust researcher at Brandeis University, wrote &quot;Scholarship as an Exercise in Rhetorical Strategy: A Case Study of Kevin MacDonald&#x27;s Research Techniques&quot;, a paper in which he notes that one of MacDonald&#x27;s sources, Jaff Schatz, objected to how MacDonald used his writings to further his premise that Jewish self-identity validates antisemitic sentiments and actions. &quot;At issue, however, is not the quality of Schatz&#x27;s research, but MacDonald&#x27;s use of it, a discussion that relies less on topical expertise than on a willingness to conduct close comparative readings&quot;, Lieberman wrote. Lieberman accused MacDonald of dishonestly using lines from the work of Holocaust denier David Irving. Citing Irving&#x27;s &quot;Uprising&quot;, published in 1981 for the 25th anniversary of Hungary&#x27;s failed anti-Communist revolution in 1956, MacDonald asserted in the &quot;Culture of Critique&quot;:

Lieberman, who said that MacDonald is not a historian, debunked those assertions, concluding that &quot;the passage offers not a shred of evidence that, as MacDonald would have it, &#x27;Jewish males enjoyed disproportionate sexual access to gentile females.&#x27;&quot;

Most academics have rejected MacDonald&#x27;s views about Judaism and race as being unworthy of legitimization or serious attention. In a critique of MacDonald in the journal &quot;Human Nature&quot; in 2018, Nathan Cofnas argued that scholars should critically engage with MacDonald&#x27;s work, in part due to its popularity among antisemites. Cofnas&#x27;s conclusion was that MacDonald&#x27;s work relied upon &quot;misrepresented sources and cherry-picked facts&quot; and that the &quot;evidence actually favors a simpler explanation of Jewish overrepresentation in intellectual movements involving Jewish high intelligence and geographic distribution.&quot;

In an April 2018 commentary in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, political scientist Abraham Miller wrote that MacDonald&#x27;s theories about Jews were &quot;the philosophical and theoretical inspiration&quot; behind the slogan &quot;Jews will not replace us&quot; used at the 2017 white supremacist Unite the Right rally.

Joan Braune, a hate studies scholar who has also written about the Frankfurt School, wrote an analysis of his contribution to “Cultural Marxism” an antisemitic conspiracy theory, focusing on MacDonald and two others as among the “main proponents of the theory in the United States today”. MacDonald writes about “Cultural Marxism” in the third volume of his trilogy, describing it as a Jewish group evolutionary strategy adopted initially by the Frankfurt School that works by appearing to adopt universalist positions (such as social justice) as a ruse to defend Jewish particular interests by making white people feel guilty and thus undermine their race. Braune concludes that “The Culture of Critique is an exercise in circular reasoning and propaganda, not serious scholarship. Its attempts at ‘science’ are laughable at best”, and notes that it unironically quotes Hitler’s Mein Kampf as a source on Jewish behaviour.

===Criticism by the ADL and the SPLC===
Mark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) claims of MacDonald that &quot;he put the anti-Semitism under the guise of scholarly work... Kevin MacDonald&#x27;s work is nothing but gussied-up anti-Semitism. At base it says that Jews are out to get us through their agenda... His work is bandied about by just about every neo-Nazi group in America.&quot;

The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) includes MacDonald in its list of American extremists, &quot;Extremism in America&quot;, and wrote a report on MacDonald&#x27;s views and ties. According to the ADL, his views on Jews mimic those of anti-Semites from the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Heidi Beirich wrote in an SPLC Intelligence Report in April 2007:

MacDonald claims the SPLC has misrepresented and distorted his work.

==CSULB comments==
A California State University (CSULB) spokeswoman stated, &quot;The university will support MacDonald&#x27;s academic freedom and freedom of speech.&quot; MacDonald was initially pressured to post a disclaimer on his website: &quot;nothing on this website should be interpreted to suggest that I condone white racial superiority, genocide, Nazism, or Holocaust denial. I advocate none of these and strongly dissociate myself and my work from groups that do. Nor should my opinions be used to support discrimination against Jews or any other group.&quot; He has since removed that disclaimer. In addition, the Psychology Department in 2006 issued three statements: a &quot;Statement on Academic Freedom and Responsibility in Research,&quot; a &quot;Statement on Diversity,&quot; and a &quot;Statement on Misuse of Psychologists&#x27; Work.&quot;

A spokeswoman for CSULB, said that at least two classes a year taught by all professors—including MacDonald—have student evaluations, and that some of the questions on those evaluations are open-ended, allowing students to raise any issue. &quot;Nothing has come through&quot; to suggest bias in class, she said. &quot;We don&#x27;t see it.&quot; Jonathan Knight, who handles academic freedom issues for the American Association of University Professors said if there are no indications that MacDonald shares his views in class, &quot;I don&#x27;t see a basis for an investigation&quot; into what goes on in his courses.

===CSULB disassociates from MacDonald&#x27;s views===
Late in 2006, a report issued by the Southern Poverty Law Center after an on-campus investigation labelled his work antisemitic and neo-Nazi propaganda, and described increasing concern about Macdonald&#x27;s views by CSULB faculty members. In late 2007, California State University–Long Beach&#x27;s Department of Psychology began the process of formally disassociating itself from MacDonald&#x27;s views on Judaism, which in some cases are &quot;used by publications considered to publicize neo-Nazi and white supremacist ideology.&quot; The department&#x27;s move followed a discussion of MacDonald&#x27;s December forum presentation at a meeting of the department&#x27;s advisory committee that concerned his ethics and methodologies.

In April 2007, a colleague of MacDonald&#x27;s, Martin Fiebert, criticized MacDonald for &quot;bigotry and cultural insensitivity&quot;, and called it &quot;troubling&quot; that MacDonald&#x27;s work was being cited by white supremacist and neo-Nazi organizations.

In an e-mail sent to the college&#x27;s &quot;Daily Forty-Niner&quot; newspaper, MacDonald said that he had already pledged not to teach about race differences in intelligence as a requirement for teaching his psychology class, and expressed that he was &quot;not happy&quot; about the disassociation. The newspaper reported that in the email, MacDonald confirmed that his books contained what the paper described as &quot;his claims that the Jewish race was having a negative effect on Western civilization.&quot; He said in an interview posted on his website by February 2008 that he had been the victim of &quot;faculty e-mail wars&quot; and &quot;tried to defend myself showing that what I was doing was scientific and rational and reasonable — and people have not responded.&quot;

The Department of Psychology voted to release an April 23, 2008 statement saying, &quot;We respect and defend his right to express his views, but we affirm that they are his alone and are in no way endorsed by the Department.&quot; The department expressed particular concern that &quot;Dr. MacDonald&#x27;s research on Jewish culture does not adhere to the Department&#x27;s explicitly stated values.&quot;

On May 5, the school&#x27;s academic senate issued a joint statement disassociating the school from MacDonald&#x27;s antisemitic views, including specific statements from the Psychology department, the History department, the Anthropology department, the Jewish Studies program, and the Linguistics department. The statement concludes: &quot;While the Academic Senate defends Dr. Kevin MacDonald&#x27;s academic freedom and freedom of speech, as it does for all faculty, it firmly and unequivocally disassociates itself from the anti-Semitic and white ethnocentric views he has expressed.&quot;

The senate considered but rejected the use of the word &quot;condemns&quot; in the statement.

==Non-academic affiliations==
===&quot;The Occidental Quarterly&quot; and the National Policy Institute===
MacDonald is the editor of the magazine &quot;The Occidental Quarterly&quot; and has contributed to it on many occasions. The magazine is a publication of the National Policy Institute, a white supremacist think tank led by Richard B. Spencer. &quot;The Occidental Quarterly&quot; was described by the Anti-Defamation League in 2012 as &quot;a racist print publication that mimics the look and style of academic journals.&quot; The &quot;Occidental Quarterly&quot; published MacDonald&#x27;s monograph, &quot;Understanding Jewish Influence: A Study in Ethnic Activism&quot;, in 2004. Journalist Max Blumenthal reported in a 2006 article for &quot;The Nation&quot; that the work &quot;has turned MacDonald into a celebrity within white nationalist and neo-Nazi circles.&quot;

In October 2004, MacDonald accepted the &quot;Jack London Literary Prize&quot; of $10,000 from &quot;The Occidental Quarterly&quot;. In his acceptance speech, he supported the concept of a white &quot;ethnostate&quot; that would exclude non-European immigrants.

In November 2016, MacDonald was a keynote speaker at an event hosted in Washington, D.C. by the National Policy Institute. The event concluded with Spencer leading the chant, &quot;Hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory.&quot;

===David Duke===
Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke praised MacDonald&#x27;s work on his website. MacDonald has appeared on Duke&#x27;s radio program on multiple occasions, saying he agrees with the &quot;vast majority&quot; of Duke&#x27;s statements.

When MacDonald won his award from &quot;The Occidental Quarterly&quot;, the ceremony was attended by David Duke; Don Black, the founder of white supremacist site &quot;Stormfront&quot;; Jamie Kelso, a senior moderator at Stormfront; and the head of the neo-Nazi National Vanguard, Kevin Alfred Strom. In 2005, Kelso told &quot;The Occidental Report&quot; that he was meeting up with MacDonald to conduct business. MacDonald is featured in Stormfront member Brian Jost&#x27;s anti-immigration film, &quot;The Line in the Sand&quot;, where he &quot;blam[ed] Jews for destroying America by supporting immigration from developing countries.&quot;

===American Freedom Party===
In January 2010, it became known that MacDonald had accepted a position as one of the eight members of the board of directors of the newly founded American Third Position (known from 2013 as the American Freedom Party), whose website has stated that the group &quot;exists to represent the political interests of White Americans&quot;. A statement on the website reads, &quot;If current demographic trends persist, European-Americans will become a minority in America in only a few decades time. The American Third Position will not allow this to happen. To safeguard our identity and culture, and to secure an American future for our people, we will immediately put an indefinite moratorium on all immigration.&quot;

===Anders Breivik===
Kevin MacDonald was impressed by mass shooter Anders Breivik’s writings on “Cultural Marxism”. Breivik was, MacDonald wrote after his attack, “a serious political thinker with a great many insights and some good practical ideas on strategy.”

<doc id="385909" wikidata="Q672089" url="?curid=385909" title="Lennoxville, Quebec">
<text>Lennoxville () is an &quot;arrondissement&quot;, or borough, of the city of Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada. Lennoxville is located at the confluence of the St. Francis and Massawippi Rivers approximately five kilometres south of downtown Sherbrooke.

Lennoxville had previously existed as an independent city until January 1, 2002, when the city of Lennoxville, along with several other formerly independent towns and cities in the region, were merged with the city of Sherbrooke. A demerger referendum held on June 20, 2004, failed to attract the required majority of votes to reestablish Lennoxville as an independent city.

==History==

Lennoxville was first settled in 1819, although the Mallory family began farming at the edge of the eventual town limits in 1804. Its name was taken from Charles Lennox, 4th Duke of Richmond, who was then Governor General of Canada.

Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War, lived in Lennoxville from 1867 to 1868 after being released on bail. He had spent two years imprisoned in Virginia awaiting his treason trial. Two of his sons went to Bishop&#x27;s College School.

The city&#x27;s war memorial is located at 150 Queen Street. The community was so moved by the military service of its past and current residents that a plaque honouring Afghanistan was unveiled in 2018. No one with Lennoxville ties died in the conflict.

==Government==

The borough is represented by one councillor on Sherbrooke City Council (Currently Claude Charon) and two councilors who serve on the local borough council but not on the full city council (currently Jennifer Garfat and Guillaume Lirette-Gélinas).

==Linguistic profile==

Historically, as with most of the Eastern Townships, Lennoxville originated as a predominantly anglophone community with an initially small francophone population. Today the population is almost evenly split between anglophones and francophones with francophones making up a plurality among native speakers (35.3%) whereas English is the language most spoken at home. Of the various districts in Sherbrooke (which itself began as an anglophone community but has since transformed into a city where French is the dominant language), Lennoxville has the largest proportion of English speakers remaining. Lennoxville is designated as a bilingual borough and municipal services are provided in both English and French.

==Education==

Several educational institutions are located in Lennoxville, including Bishop&#x27;s University, Champlain Regional College, Bishop&#x27;s College School and Alexander Galt Regional High School. During the school year, the population of Lennoxville increases significantly as students from elsewhere in Canada and around the world move to Lennoxville to attend school. Bishop&#x27;s College School is home to Canada&#x27;s oldest indoor ice hockey rink.

At Bishop&#x27;s University, frosh week (orientation week) is held in the first week of the fall semester, which generally falls around the first week of September. In 2005 Bishop&#x27;s University received an award for running one of the most successful orientation weeks in the country . Homecoming weekend is typically celebrated the last weekend of September, with a football game, gatherings of designated graduating classes, and various social functions.

==Transportation==
Quebec Routes 143 and 108 provide access to Lennoxville from surrounding communities and nearby Autoroute 10 and Autoroute 55 provide easy access to Montreal, Quebec City, and the United States. Autoroute 410 is currently being extended from its current terminus on 108 to further east, bypassing Lennoxville, with a bridge built over the Massawippi river and culminating at R-108 near Glenday Road, Alexander Galt Regional High School and the Dairy and Swine Research and Development Centre. Bishop&#x27;s University. The extension of Autoroute 410 will redirect heavy truck traffic from downtown Lennoxville&#x27;s often congested single intersection.
