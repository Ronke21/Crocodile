<text>Kwaito is a music genre that emerged in Soweto, Johannesburg, South Africa, between the late 1980s and 1990s. It is a variant of house music that features the use of African sounds and samples. Kwaito songs occur at a slower tempo range than other styles of house music and often contain catchy melodic and percussive loop samples, deep bass lines and vocals. They are also very similar tempos to early 1990s NYC house tracks.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;kwaito&quot; originates from the South African slang &quot;kwaai,&quot; which conveys the meaning of &quot;cool&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; in a positive context. The term &quot;kwaai&quot; itself is rooted in Afrikaans, where it initially signified &quot;angry&quot; or &quot;fierce.&quot; However, within the framework of South African youth culture, its connotation had shifted to represent something fashionable or noteworthy.

Kwaito led a post-Apartheid township subculture into the mainstream despite the fact that the Afrikaans language is associated with the apartheid regime and racial oppression, Afrikaans words are often drawn into the Sabela and Tsotsitaal and Camtho vocabularies, reshaped and used in a related or new context. M&#x27;du Masilela - a pioneering kwaito artist, said, &quot;When house music got popular, people from the ghetto called it Kwaito after the Afrikaans slang word &quot;kwai&quot; [&quot;sic&quot;], meaning those house tracks were hot, that they were kicking.&quot; An Isicamtho word derived from the Afrikaans word &quot;kwaai&quot; is &quot;amakwaitosi&quot;, which means &quot;gangster&quot;. Arthur Mafokate described the relationship between kwaito and gangsterism as music revolving around ghetto life.
==History==
Kwaito evolved and emerged in South Africa as a distinct genre between the late 1980s and early 1990s, becoming prominent music within the post-apartheid cultural milieu. Schools in the townships were burdened by severe financial limitations and were unable to offer programs such as music classes that might have enriched students&#x27; educational experiences. During and shortly after the apartheid era, the South African education system was characterized by severe segregation and inequality. Schools in townships received scant resources and inadequate support in comparison to those in more affluent areas, further constraining educational opportunities for township students.

In this context, kwaito emerged as a genre that did not necessitate formal music theory, extensive rehearsal space, or costly instruments, thus proving particularly accessible to individuals in these disadvantaged communities. The genre&#x27;s minimal barriers to entry enabled young people in the townships to engage with music and exercise their creativity, despite the constraints imposed by their educational and economic environments. Key figures in the early kwaito scene included Mdu Masilela (M&#x27;du), Mandla Mofokeng (Spikiri), Arthur Mafokate, Sandy B and groups such as MM Deluxe (M&#x27;du Masilela, Spikiri), Boom Shaka ( Lebo Mathosa, Theo Nhlengethwa, Thembi Seete), Trompies (Spikiri, Mahoota, Donald Duck, Jakarumba, Mjokes), B.O.P, TKZee (Tokollo Tshabalala, Kabelo Mabalane, Zwai Bala) and Bongo Maffin (Stone Seate, Jah Seed, Speedy, and Thandiswa Mazwai) whose contributions were instrumental in shaping both its musical and cultural identity. Kwaito did not require a formal knowledge of music theory, large spaces to rehearse, and expensive instruments, it was easily accessible to individuals especially in downtrodden communities.

Newfound freedom gave South African musicians easier access to international works and a greater ability to freely express themselves. As a result, kwaito has also been known as the expression of this new freedom, and many anti-apartheid chants have been used as lyrics for kwaito songs. Kwaito has been called the music that defines the generation who came of age after apartheid. A notable kwaito track titled &quot;Kaffir&quot; by Arthur Mafokate exemplified the freedom of expression that emerged with South Africa&#x27;s political liberation. In the early 1990s, house music made its way to Cape Town through raves such as the World Peace Party and in iconic venues like Club Eden, followed by Euphoria and DV8. Concurrently, house music also began to influence Durban&#x27;s nightlife scene. This musical movement then spread northward, gaining prominence in Johannesburg clubs like 4th World. Durban also made significant contributions. In 1994, Sandy B released the album &quot;AmaJovi Jovi&quot;, which achieved major national success and is acknowledged as the first kwaito album from KwaZulu-Natal.

As kwaito attained mainstream prominence in South Africa, collaborations became increasingly prevalent, exemplified by the notable collaborations between South African R&amp;B artists such as Danny K and, Mandoza. Kwaito hits frequently attracted significant media attention. Arthur Mafokate&#x27;s August 2005 release, &quot;Sika Lekhekhe&quot; (a Zulu expression that translates literally to &quot;cut this cake&quot; and figuratively to &quot;have sex with me&quot;) generated considerable controversy. The song was banned by the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) radio station, and Mafokate was required to reshoot the song&#x27;s music video in response to viewer complaints regarding its sexually suggestive content.

Similarly, Boom Shaka encountered substantial criticism from the political establishment for their interpretation of the national anthem with a kwaito beat. Although Johannesburg-based artists played a crucial role in the genre&#x27;s emergence and popularization.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the kwaito industry witnessed swift expansion and escalated rivalry. Zola, Mandoza, Trompies, Mzekezeke, Brown Dash, Mahoota, Spikiri, Mzambiya, Chippa, Msawawa, Mshoza, Thembi Seete, Thandiswa Mazwai, Brickz, TKZee, Unathi, and Brenda Fassie emerged as influential figures in South Africa, shaping the country&#x27;s culture, language, and economy in ways that were unattainable during the era of government-imposed segregation under apartheid. TS, Ghetto Ruff, Kalawa Jazmee, Afrotainment and Bulldogs were the leading recording companies responsible for discovering kwaito artists. The South African talent show &quot;Jam Alley&quot; provided a significant platform for many emerging kwaito musicians, such as Mandoza, Mzambiya, and Zola.

==Characteristics==
Kwaito is characterized by a slow tempo. The genre is distinguished by its prominent, synthesized bass lines and songs often features a funky, melodic quality. The drum patterns in kwaito are influenced by house music however are executed with a more relaxed approach. The genre prominently features drum machines and electronic percussion. Production techniques in kwaito frequently involve sampling from traditional South African music, hip hop, and disco. The influence of Zulu music is particularly notable, with kwaito often incorporating traditional Zulu musical elements and rhythms. Vocals in kwaito are typically delivered in a conversational or narrative style. Lyrics are performed in various South African languages, such as Zulu, Sotho, and Afrikaans, and explore themes ranging from social and political commentary to personal experiences and celebratory subjects. Sometimes kwaito lyrics are explicit, reflecting the genre’s engagement with real-life issues and experiences. Additionally, the use of Tsotsi Taal adds a layer of linguistic richness.

==Record producers and record sales==
Producers who played a major role in the genre&#x27;s evolution include M&#x27;du, Arthur Mafokate, Spikiri, Don Laka, Sandy B, Oskido, Rudeboy Paul, Dope, Sanza and Sello Chicco Twala. Spikiri, refined kwaito’s signature sound by incorporating distinctive rhythms and local musical elements. Sello Chicco Twala, mentored several kwaito artists. Mdu Masilela also played a crucial role, known for his combination of melodic elements and rhythmic innovation. During the genre&#x27;s inception, kwaito rapidly gained popularity in South Africa. Musicians such as Mandoza, Arthur Mafokate, and Boom Shaka achieved significant commercial success, earning platinum status and solidifying the genre&#x27;s position in the South African music scene. During the 1990s and early 2000s, kwaito consistently topped local music charts, reflected in numerous gold and platinum certifications.

==Women in kwaito==
Kwaito was initially a largely male-dominated music genre, in regards to the artists as well as the management. However, there were a number of female artists that managed to become quite successful. Brenda Fassie, a South African pop superstar, quickly adopted a kwaito style as it surged to popularity in the 1990s. According to &quot;Time&quot;, she was known both for her diva attitude and scandals involving sex and drugs, but also for lyrics that dealt with complex issues of African culture and life. Lebo Mathosa rose to fame as part of the group Boom Shaka, and later became a solo artist despite (or perhaps because of) being sometimes called South Africa&#x27;s &quot;wild child&quot; because of her sexually explicit lyrics and dance moves, she gained widespread popularity, and performed at Nelson Mandela&#x27;s 85th birthday celebration. Lebo Mathosa had performed alongside American superstar performers Will Smith and Missy Elliott and had also recorded a duet with R&amp;B star Keith Sweat. Iyaya, formerly of group Abashante, was known for &quot;taking raw, street sexuality to the stage&quot;. Goddess, Venus, Chocolate and Rasta Queen were the four members of the all-female kwaito group Ghetto Luv. They adopted an &quot;in your face&quot; sexual style; the cover of their first album &quot;You Ain&#x27;t Gonna Get None&quot; displayed all four members completely naked.

During the emergence of the kwaito, Boom Shaka emerged as a voice for young women and a symbol of empowerment. They used sexuality as an expression and celebration of black female bodies and the natural female sexual desires. Boom Shaka engaged in political activism by advocating for women&#x27;s voices through their recording of a new South African anthem that emphasized women&#x27;s capacity to effect societal change. Kwaito provided women with a novel form of agency for self-representation in post-apartheid South Africa. A &quot;CNN&quot; article considered Boom Shaka alongside TKZee the most influential kwaito groups in South African music. Boom Shaka&#x27;s music gained popularity not only in South Africa but throughout Africa. The group&#x27;s music represented the voice of young people who were often neglected by governments in post-colonial Africa

== Subgenres and styles ==

=== Durban Kwaito ===
Durban Kwaito (also kwaito house or Durban house) is a variant of kwaito that emerged in Durban between the 1990s and early 2000s. It originated before it had an official name and was influenced by more diverse house music styles than traditional kwaito. Durban kwaito began to take shape driven by a new wave of artists and producers preponderantly from Durban who infused traditional kwaito sounds with local drum rhythms and progressive production techniques. Key figures in the development of Durban kwaito include DJ Fisherman, Durban&#x27;s Finest (DJ Tira and DJ Sox), Sandy B, DJ Tira, Big Nuz, L&#x27;vovo, DJ Cleo, Danger, Shana, Professor, Character, Tzozo, Sox, Zakes Bantwini, DJ Siyanda, NaakMusiQ, Unathi, DJ Cndo and DJ Bongz who were instrumental in popularizing the Durban kwaito sound, characterized by its incorporation of faster tempos, tribal house, deep house, electro and regional influences (such as associated musicians like DJ Tira who performed on the Spanish island of Ibiza known for its house music and rave scene for two years, 2000 and 2001). The isiZulu term &quot;Isgubhu&quot; refers to a drum or beat emitting from speakers, that became synonymous with Durban kwaito. Durban kwaito&#x27;s sound influenced the development of bacardi house and later gqom. The word &quot;gqom&quot;, which could be interpreted as &quot;hitting drum&quot; in the Zulu language later evolved into a distinct spinoff and subsequently birthed the subgenre, sgubhu (not to be confused with the term or Durban kwaito). Due to its significant influence on the gqom genre, Durban kwaito, is often conflated with or referred to as gqom.

==== Future Kwaito ====
Future Kwaito blends traditional kwaito with gqom, drone music, industrial music and traditional house music developed by Stiff Pap in the late 2010s.

=== Guz ===
TKZee’s, &quot;guz&quot; sound exemplified a fusion of kwaito with hip hop elements, signifying a significant evolution within the genre. It retained the quintessential kwaito rhythm and incorporated augmented 1990s hip hop influences through rap-style vocals. Guz demonstrated how kwaito had evolved over time, integrating elements of hip hop. Guz was noted as having appealed to a wider audience.

==== New Age Kwaito ====
New Age Kwaito incorporates hip hop with &quot;kwaito classics&quot;, samples. It emerged mid-2017 and is attributed to Kwesta, Riky Rick, Spoek Mathambo, Okmalumkoolkat, Cassper Nyovest and K.O.

==== Skhanda Rap ====
Skhanda Rap blends elements of traditional kwaito with rapping. Skhanda rap began to take shape in the mid- 2010s. Artists include K.O, Ma-E, Maggz, Kid X and Moozlie. The album, &quot;Skhanda Republic&quot;, was pivotal in defining skhanda rap.

=== Kwai-jazz ===
Kwai-jazz (also kwaai jazz), is kwaito with jazz integrated elements developed by Don Laka in the 1980s.

==Political and social impact==
Kwaito, which emerged during South Africa&#x27;s transition from apartheid, exerted significant political influence. It served as a powerful form of expression and resistance, reflecting the social and political realities of the post-apartheid era. The genre addressed issues such as poverty, inequality, and urban experiences, deeply resonating with the struggles and aspirations of marginalized communities in South Africa. A scholar, Gavin Steingo, examined the political dimensions of kwaito and analyzed how the genre functioned as a vehicle for political commentary and social critique, arguing that its development and reception mirrored broader shifts in South African society, including changes in political consciousness and identity. Steingo’s research highlighted how kwaito&#x27;s lyrics and performances frequently engaged with themes of empowerment and resistance, underscoring its role as both a cultural and political force. Kwaito also faced political scrutiny and censorship as outlined by Arthur Mafokate and Boom Shaka&#x27;s encountered criticism from political and social leaders due to their provocative content. Overall, the rise of kwaito and its impact on South African society demonstrated its significance not only as a musical genre but also as a medium for political expression and social commentary.

According to Rudeboy Paul, &quot;Kwaito is a platform that serves to drive thoughts, ideas, gives kids from the township a voice in which to speak on what their concerns are, social ills happening around them, the fact that they can&#x27;t find jobs out there, HIV and AIDS awareness as well.&quot;

==Performance and cultural significance==
Livermon writes, &quot;Kwaito bodies situate themselves within and through the space of the city [negotiating] complicated contexts of post-apartheid life. These seams of negotiation, of self-articulation and lived expression, come into creative tension in this ethnography...&quot; Through this ethnographic performance, Kwaito positions itself as more than a music genre; Kwaito becomes a voice and physical movement expressing freedom for Black South Africans in the post-apartheid context. In the &quot;Freedom Sounds&quot; documentary, Thandiswa Mazwai discusses the re-introduction of South African youth into a public and performance zeitgeist. This publicity requires performers to &quot;[illuminate] different aspect[s] of kwaito bodies, offering a way to read young Black bodies and their constitutive pleasures within narratives of power&quot;. Finding the awareness of one&#x27;s power and authenticity through performance becomes radical. This idea of &quot;being radical&quot; is not because Kwaito dance explicitly speaks about the impact and overcoming of socio-political strife; instead, this radical ideology comes from a disruption that frees Black music, production, and performance from the perception of only having to require an explicit political message, instead valuing celebration, pleasure, and overcoming.

Kwaito&#x27;s also considered innovative use of local languages, played a key role in shaping a new cultural identity for South Africans. The genre had a significant impact on South African fashion and lifestyle, closely tied to urban youth culture. It inspired styles and trends, such as casual streetwear and eclectic fashion choices. Beyond South Africa, kwaito garnered international attention.

==Criticism==

Kwaito has received criticism. The kwaito music industry is viewed as male-dominated, especially in management. There are few successful female artists. Lebo Mathosa, who was one of kwaito&#x27;s most famous female artists and a member of Boom Shaka, noted that it is &quot;difficult because every producer that you meet in our country is male there isn&#x27;t even one female producer that you could say ok I like that record that is produced by so and so.&quot; Others accuse kwaito as being talentless, commercialized and mass-produced, consisting of sexually-driven lyrics and dances.

Being male-dominated, kwaito tends to misrepresent women in their lyrics by referencing the body and sexual images. Some kwaito groups like Trompies are using the image of the woman to make a social and political statement. In one of their music videos, there is a beauty contest and the women that win and get all the male attention are all on the heavier side. The group is trying to say that today&#x27;s perception and definition of beauty does not have to adhere to other cultures&#x27; societal standards. Furthermore, more women are entering the kwaito music scene like artist Lesego Bile. She has claimed she enjoys the challenge of entered a male dominated music genre and uses her struggles from her past to help her stay true. She refuses to never exploit her body and dance sexually to please the crowd, like other female artists. She plans on making a strong statement for female artists, while commenting on social issues.

Kwaito has also been criticized in that it has been labeled as the African version of hip hop or an imitator. In Thokozani Mhlambi&#x27;s article &quot;Kwaitofabulous&quot;, he points out various European scholars who have disclaimed the authenticity of hip hop as they believe it to undermine the cultural and historical struggles of the South African people because of Kwaito&#x27;s similarity with American hip hop. Mhlambi, however, disclaims by pointing out that the Black youth of America and South Africa have faced similar oppressive histories by the white population, and thus makes sense to have its music similar as well. He also points out that the criticism from onlookers from other cultures do not realize how both kwaito and hip hop require performances and music making to be a group process and thus requires collaboration. He believes kwaito and hip hop to have many similarities due to both genre&#x27;s origins; however, he does not believe kwaito to be a direct descendant of hip hop. Furthermore, many scholars and researchers of the genre, including Gavin Steingo, agree with Mhlambi in that they disclaim the idea that kwaito is purely South African hip hop. Steingo writes in an article titled &quot;South African music after Apartheid: kwaito, the &#x27;party politic,&#x27; and the appropriation of gold as a sign of success&quot; that the genre was influenced by both house music and American hip hop, while also drawing on inspiration from ancient African music. Therefore, kwaito cannot be simply the South African version of hip hop. Also, Steingo writes that a version of hip hop music does already exist in the country, and it is not kwaito: &quot;Because of seemingly obvious parallels between African American youth culture and the new Black South African youth culture, people have been inclined to think of kwaito as South African hip hop, or a South African version of hip hop (In 2000, Sterns/Earthworks released a kwaito compilation CD in the UK called &quot;Kwaito—South African Hip Hop&quot;). It would seem that this perceived familiarity is based primarily on the shared characteristic of rhyming in verse. And, though this is not totally invalid, it should be stated that there is a South African version of hip hop in South Africa and it is not (and has even come into conflict with) kwaito.&quot; Additionally, it is difficult to define Kwaito as a type of South African hip hop, as there is an actual emergent hip-hop scene. As kwaito, for the most part, remains apolitical, the hip hop scene, although less popular, generates a more political and gangster-esque style. This difference is described by the South African hip hop group Godessa, &quot;Hip-hop is universal. We were excluded from Kwaito because we cannot understand it. To us, music is not just about dancing, it is a vehicle for us to speak to the masses.&quot; Similarly, hip hop is gaining popularity in Johannesburg, kwaito&#x27;s stomping ground, and its emergence is fostering a rivalry of sorts, further separating the two genres. As Kwaito is more of a mixture of hip hop, disco, and house, the hip hop scene mirrors a more American style of hip-hop.

Regardless of criticism, kwaito music now plays an important and prominent role in South African youth culture.

==Cultural context and implications==

Kwaito is viewed as a cultural product of the societal norms and historical context of the townships of South Africa. It is both affected by Black South African society and influences the popular culture of Johannesburg, Cape Town, and their surrounding suburbs. Kwaito serves a transmitter of popular fashion, language, and attitude. Kwaito has also been adopted by mainstream advertisers and production companies as a means of addressing the masses and selling products. A combination of the popularity of Kwaito music and the search by transnational marketers for a means of addressing Soweto youth (considered to be popular cultures&#x27; trendsetters) has led to the use of Kwaito music as a method for advertising mainstream North American products.

Kwaito acts as a reference point for understanding the social situation and cultural norms of Soweto society. Many songs such as Bantwan by Bob Mabena, &quot;whose lyrics marry consumerism and female objectification&quot; or Isigaga by Prophets of Da City which &quot;expresses the same negative and misogynistic attitudes.&quot;. Kwaito also addresses the oppression of black people and the context of colonialism in which they still live. Songs such as Arthur Mafokate&#x27;s song &#x27;Kaffir&#x27; addresses the prevalence of direct racism and Zola&#x27;s song Mblwembe (problem child) reflects the prevalence of crime in the townships serve as a means of social dialogue. A third way in which a specific aspect black South African Society is reflected by Kwaito is in the dancehall nature of its origins and rhythms. It shows the prevalence of the dancehall in the impoverished townships and flat lands and illustrates the importance of the dancehall as a cultural meeting place. South African Kwaito enthusiast Nhlanhla Sibongile Mafu best articulated the balance between social commentary and recreation when he said, &quot;dancing itself becomes the site for a radical rejection of the traditional struggle lyrics in favour of the liberation of pleasure, while at the same time attempting to use the language of the street to grapple with and articulate the present reality for the man and woman in the streets of the ghetto&quot;.

It is said that &quot; ...a repressive society would result in a creative art...it is an ingredient, it acts as a catalyst to a man who is committed.&quot; In 1994 apartheid ended in South Africa. Kwaito music in South Africa became a symbol of the new generation of youth; furthermore it was not just music, but it stood for a way of life and associated with it was a way of talk, dance, and dress. Kwaito reflects life for the South African youth in the townships, much in the same manner that American hip hop portrays life in the American ghetto. This type of music seems to be the newly unsilenced voice of the people speaking out freely in their society.

Critics have compared Kwaito to other international subgenres such as Jamaica&#x27;s dancehall and the UK&#x27;s grime. Dancehall was founded in the 1950s and &#x27;60s right when Jamaicans were trying to gain independence from the British. Similarly Kwaito was formed right after the apartheid was lifted in South Africa, both by young members of the lower class. Additionally both have &quot;taken cues from the trends of new governments that supposedly gave rise to the advancement of personal wealth, and glamorized lifestyles.&quot; They also share a number of themes in common including commentary on violence and crime, AIDS awareness, and women&#x27;s safety.

The commonalities between dancehall and Kwaito are in fact rooted in a deeper relationship between South Africa and Jamaican music. African reggae artists like Côte d&#x27;Ivoire&#x27;s Alpha Blondy and South Africa&#x27;s own Lucky Dube were popular throughout the continent during apartheid, and Alpha helped shed a negative light on the oppressive regime when he compared apartheid to Nazism. Many currently renowned Kwaito musicians grew up listening to Jamaican music, and Stoan, a member of Bongo Maffin, explained in an interview just how necessary an outlet this kind of music was: the representations of black people imported into the country during apartheid were singularly negative ones, and Jamaican music was one of the few imported forms that celebrated blackness and gave ghettoized black youth in South Africa something to embrace and identify with. As he describes it,

&quot;If we had to look at any other example of black people off the continent who have found their essence, it&#x27;s Jamaicans. For us, for South Africans after the curtain was lifted, after we could see other things besides what was presented to us on television which was blacksploitation [sic.] movies and stuff like that, buffoons, you know the picture of us. Any other picture of a successful black man was him behaving like a caricature of himself. Jamaicans brought another element to a picture we had of us as an out of body experience. Yeah, so I think you&#x27;ll find that a lot of people, you know, have been touched by the culture, in South Africa, within 10 years.&quot;
==Dances==

Kwaito is more than just a music genre. A &quot;CNN&quot; article described kwaito as a whole subculture with a swirl of irresistible dance beats. According to Sonjah Stanley-Niaah in her article &quot;Mapping Black Atlantic Performance Geographies: From Slave Ship to Ghetto,&quot; dancing has given kwaito increased appeal. In South Africa, beginning in the 1950s, people went to shebeens to listen to music, dance, and socialize on the weekends. The dancing girls at the parties, often hosted in houses as opposed to licensed clubs, served as a motivation for men to attend. As kwaito emerged and became the norm of music in the shebeens, its popularity rapidly increased. Boom Shaka, the first kwaito group, was also the first to create and popularize dance moves to accompany kwaito. The dances were said to offer a window into the everyday life of South Africans by building on traditional dance styles from the region. New dance style had also led to discussion over gender relations.

Pantsula is a male-dominated dance that came about in the 1980s representing the lower class culture. The dance includes synchronized movements by large groups of male dancers. &quot;Mapantsula&quot; is the title of a 1988 film describing the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa. It was the first anti-apartheid film relating to black South Africans.

==Kwaito and globalization==

The homogenization of kwaito with American rap music, due to globalization, was viewed by kwaito artists as a threat to the preservation of their local South African music credibility. Thus, kwaito artists focused on maintaining an emotional link between the customer and brand. Transnational corporations were much less interested in homogenizing or Americanizing kwaito music because true kwaito represented and dictated the South African experience. Americanizing kwaito, as was in many artists&#x27; opinions, would dilute the substance kwaito was originally based on.

<text>The Berlengas are a Portuguese archipelago consisting of small Atlantic islands off the coast of Peniche, Portugal, in the Oeste region. These islands were traditionally known to British mariners as &quot;the Burlings&quot;. The only inhabited island is its largest island, Berlenga Grande, although there is currently no permanent habitation in the archipelago. The other islands are grouped into two groups of islets, the Estelas Islets and the Farilhões-Forcados Islets.

==History==
Human occupation on Berlenga Grande dates back to antiquity: the islands are referred to in Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot; as Λονδοβρίς (&quot;Londobris&quot;). Much later it was referred to as the island of &quot;Saturno&quot; by Roman geographers, and was visited successively by Muslims, Vikings and privateers.

The islands are thought to be a former sacred place adopted by the Phoenicians in the first millennium BC where the cult of Baal–Melqart was celebrated.

In 1513, with the support of Queen Eleanor of Viseu, monks from the Order of São Jerónimo established a settlement on the island to offer assistance to navigation and victims of frequent shipwrecks. The monastery founded there, the Monastery of the Misericórdia da Berlenga, remained until the 16th century, when disease, lack of supplies and poor communication (due to constant inclement weather) forced the monks to abandon their service on the island.

After the Portuguese Restoration War, during the reign of King John IV, the council of war determined that the demolition of the monastery ruins and the use of their rocks to build a coastal defense would help protect the coastal settlements; the Fort of São João Baptista das Berlengas was constructed from the remnants of the monastery ruins. By 1655, it had already, during its construction, resisted an assault by three Barbary Coast pirates.

The island&#x27;s lighthouse (dubbed &quot;Duke of Braganza&quot; by locals) was constructed in 1841. In the 20th century a solar panel was installed in the lighthouse&#x27;s column, providing a field of vision.

The International Coordinating Council of UNESCO&#x27;s Man and the Biosphere Programme (MAB), meeting in Dresden (Germany) from 28 June to 1 July, while adding 18 new sites, included the Berlengas to the World Network of Biosphere Reserves (WNBR): in a statement on 30 June 2011, the list of classified reserves were presented.

==Geography==

The archipelago is made up of the largest island, Berlenga Grande, and two groups of smaller islets, the Estelas Inlets and the Farilhões-Forcados Islets. As the archipelago has been declared a reservation area for the protection of the local fauna (primarily sea birds), it is only visited by scientists and, in the summer, by a number of tourists.

There is little soil on the rocky archipelago, so little plant life is supported. Sea birds and marine life, such as mackerel, mullet, and swordfish are abundant.

=== Berlenga Grande ===
At long and wide, Berlenga Grande is the largest of the islands of the Berlengas Archipelago. At its highest, it rises to above sea level. The island has a number of notable caves, including &quot;Gruta Azul&quot; (English: &quot;Blue Cave&quot;) and &quot;Furado Grande&quot; (English: &quot;Big Hole&quot;). The &quot;Furado Grande&quot; is a natural tunnel wide and tall which crosses through the entire island before opening up into a dramatic bay.

The Fort of São João Baptista (English: &quot;Fort of St. John the Baptist&quot;) is located in the waters off the southeastern coast of Berlenga Grande, on a small islet connected to the island by a causeway/arch-bridge and anchorage to the north. It has been retrofitted as a rest house for tourists to stay at while visiting the islands.

===Farilhões-Forcados Islets===
The Farilhões-Forcados Islets are uninhabited islands located northwest of Berlenga Grande.

===Geology===

These islands consist of a pink granite very rare in Europe and very common in America, rich in feldspars. Erosion has created remarkable landforms, such as the &quot;sugar loaf&quot;, or even narrow valleys with almost vertical walls (the &quot;carreiros&quot;, formed by selective erosion along subvertical fault planes), as well as numerous caves and marine tunnels

The different groups of islands have different morphology, composition and origins. Berlenga Grande and Estelas are of igneous origin, composed of pink granites, and occur in outcrops with rounded morphologies, generally with flattened tops. The Farilhões Forcadas group, on the other hand, consists of metamorphic rocks, where reliefs characterized by sharp peaks and vertical cliffs stand out.

Berlenga Island is a pink granite plateau with rounded shapes, marked by a very jagged coastline, where several coves, caves, arches, paths, small islets and rocks stand out. All these landforms were shaped by the continuous action of erosive processes over a long period of time. The very embedded and relatively aligned paths of Cações and Mosteiro stand out, which almost separate the island of Berlenga into two fragments, the Ilha Velha and the Berlenga itself, and give it a curious figure-eight shape.

It is hypothesized that the archipelago had its origin on a horst. Its absence on the Mesozoic suggests that, during this time, the Berlengas block was essentially subjected to erosive processes. The pink granite fragments and metamorphic rocks found at Cabo Carvoeiro or Baleal, as well as in the Papoa tuff breccia, similar to those recognized in the archipelago, confirms this hypothesis. It is also expected that this block was larger and had a different configuration than it currently has.

The absence of morphological structures typical of the erosion of granitic massifs and soils on the surface of Berlenga Grande suggest that it was underwater for long periods of time. Its rounded shape and the relatively flat surface of its top propounds the presence of an ancient marine abrasion platform, confirmed by the presence of numerous erosive forms, such as potholes, which developed on top of the applanation surface when it was at the bottom of the sea.

On the other hand, the existence of small cavities and caves in the cliffs above the current mean sea level, such as Furado Seco, and marine terraces that correspond to residual deposits of old beaches, located at similar altitudes, seem to indicate that sea level was once positioned on that horizon. These observations suggest significant variations in the mean sea level, possibly as a result of quaternary glaciations.

Additionally, Berlenga Grande has a poorly developed drainage network, (when precipitation occurs, rainwater is taken and falls directly into the sea in cascades), which clearly evidences that the erosion rate of the granitic massif is lower than the speed of variations in the mean sea level.

The older metamorphic rocks that outcrop in Farilhões and Forcadas are erosion-resistance peaks of an underwater mountain that widens considerably below sea level. These rocks are strongly deformed and contain textures and minerals characteristic of high pressure and high temperature environments, typical of the lower crust.

==Climate==

The Berlengas have a Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csb&quot;) dominated by the Atlantic, especially on the northern and northwestern coasts, where strong winds are felt. Heavy rains in winter alternate with periods of drought, between spring and autumn.

The climate of the archipelago is strongly influenced by the winds, very strong on the north-facing cliffs and more moderate on the southern coasts. These wind currents affect the distribution of flora and fauna in the islands. This climatic feature endows the archipelago with a unique ecosystem, both on land and at sea level.

The presence close to the mainland, whose coast is oriented north–south, also strongly influences the climatic characteristics of the island, especially in summer. In this season, the differential warming of the sea and the land causes the formation of a sea breeze during the day. This breeze strengthens the main wind current associated with the Azores High and gives rise to a wind regime known as the Nortada. These winds push surface waters offshore, causing cold waters from deeper layers of the water to replace warm surface waters in an upwelling process. This phenomenon causes frequent mists during summer and results in nutrient enrichment of surface water.

Average monthly temperatures in summer are cool (below ) and highs rarely exceed . In winter, the monthly averages remain high (above ) and the minimum above . The thermal amplitude (both diurnal temperature variation and yearly temperature variation) therefore remains moderate.

Due to generally cloudy conditions in the winter and the summer morning fog, the archipelago has a relatively low number of sunshine hours, though clear sky afternoons are frequent in the summer.

Averages for the closest point on the mainland to the islands, Cabo Carvoeiro, are expressed in the climate box below:

==Terrestrial biome==
===Flora===

The flora of the Berlengas mainly consists of bushes and grasses, adapted to the strong winds, high aridity and salinity, some of them are common on the coastal mainland, others are endemic to the islands. There are two known endemic species to the islands, &quot;Armeria berlengensis and &quot;Pulicaria microcephala&quot;; and two subspecies, &quot;Echium rosulatum subsp. davaei&quot; and &quot;Herniaria lusitanica subsp. berlengiana&quot;.

There are around 100 different plant species present on the archipelago.

Human presence led to the introduction of exotic species, like the ice plant and small mammals like the European rabbit and the black rat who work to diminish the native population.

===Fauna===

There are two species of lizard in the islands, the Carbonell&#x27;s wall lizard (subs. berlengensis) and the ocellated lizard, although this last one is residual and is only seen in restricted areas of the islands such as caves and is thought to be different from the continental relatives, showing different morphological traits and demeanor.

The Berlengas archipelago is an important breeding area for seabirds such as the lesser black-backed gull and the yellow-legged gull, whose population increased dramatically due to artificial feeding and has become a serious problem in some cases, and land birds like the black redstart and the peregrine falcon. It is also in the southernmost range of the common murre (adopted as the symbol of the nature reserve) and is one of the few breeding locations of the band-rumped storm petrel.

A new endemic species of snail, &quot;Oestophora barrelsi&quot; spec. nov was described in 2015.

==Marine biome==
The Berlengas archipelago is situated off of Peniche, south of the Nazaré Canyon and on the edge of the continental shelf (in Farilhões Islets) on a maritime zone known by its relatively high biological productivity, acting as a meeting point between coastal and oceanic fish species. On the other hand, the upwelling currents originating in deep waters contribute to the development of an aquatic fauna with evident commercial interest. Its variety of fish and marine mammals, marine plants and other marine organisms as led to its classification as a marine reserve.

===Fish===
The water around the islands hosts a great variety of fish, at least 44 species are known from two study expeditions. The most frequently observed fish is the common two-banded sea bream and the ballan wrasse, along with the European bass, the red porgy, the gilt-head bream and the dusky grouper, frequent on Farilhões Islets.

In the 1950s the islands were an important spawning ground for school sharks.

===Marine mammals===
The oceanographic conditions of the archipelago commonly lead to an abundant ichthyofauna, represented by sardines and other species that feed on plankton. This attracts a lot of marine mammals, mainly cetaceans, whose species include the common dolphin, the common bottlenose dolphin, the harbour porpoise, the striped dolphin, the common minke whale and the Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whale.

== Wrecks ==
A number of ships have wrecked on the Berlengas throughout documented history.

In 1808, wrecked on Berlenga Grande in a gale, though without loss of life.

==Culture==
Berlenga Grande did star in a post-revolutionary Portuguese film called &quot;O Rei das Berlengas&quot; (The King of the Berlengas), a comedy about someone who decides to become king of the archipelago. In this movie, several people, tourists and residents from the nearby towns, attempt to declare the independence of the islands, and declare themselves as king, prince or president of the Berlengas. These declarations and liberation armies are nothing more than fiction intended for amusement.

<doc id="387583" wikidata="Q170516" url="?curid=387583" title="Calvary">
<text>Calvary ( or ) or Golgotha () was a site immediately outside Jerusalem&#x27;s walls where, according to Christianity&#x27;s four canonical gospels, Jesus was crucified.

Since at least the early medieval period, it has been a destination for pilgrimage. The exact location of Calvary has been traditionally associated with a place now enclosed within one of the southern chapels of the multidenominational Church of the Holy Sepulchre, a site said to have been recognized by the Roman empress Helena, mother of Constantine the Great, during her visit to the Holy Land in 325.

Other locations have been suggested: in the 19th century, Protestant scholars proposed a different location near the Garden Tomb on Green Hill (now &quot;Skull Hill&quot;) about north of the traditional site and historian Joan Taylor has more recently proposed a location about to its south-southeast.

==Biblical references and names==

The English names Calvary and Golgotha derive from the Vulgate Latin , and (all meaning &quot;place of the Skull&quot; or &quot;a Skull&quot;), and used by Jerome in his translations of Matthew 27:33, Mark 15:22, Luke 23:33, and John 19:17. Versions of these names have been used in English since at least the 10th century, a tradition shared with most European languages including French (), Spanish and Italian (), pre-Lutheran German (), Polish (), and Lithuanian (). The 1611 King James Version borrowed the Latin forms directly, while Wycliffe and other translators anglicized them in forms like &quot;Caluarie&quot;, &quot;Caluerie&quot;, and &quot;Calueri&quot; which were later standardized as &quot;Calvary&quot;. While the Gospels merely identify Golgotha as a &quot;place&quot;, Christian tradition has described the location as a hill or mountain since at least the 6th century. It has thus often been referenced as in English hymns and literature.

In the 1769 King James Version, the relevant verses of the New Testament are:
* And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull, They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink. And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots...
* And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull. And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not. And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.
* And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.
* And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha: Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.

In the standard Koine Greek texts of the New Testament, the relevant terms appear as &quot;Golgothâ&quot; (), &quot;Golgathân&quot; (), &quot;kraníou tópos&quot; (), &quot;Kraníou tópos&quot; (), &quot;Kraníon&quot; (), and &quot;Kraníou tópon&quot; (). Golgotha&#x27;s Hebrew equivalent would be &quot;Gulgōleṯ&quot; (, &quot;skull&quot;), ultimately from the verb &quot;galal&quot; () meaning &quot;to roll&quot;. The form preserved in the Greek text, however, is actually closer to Aramaic &quot;Golgolta&quot;, which also appears in reference to a head count in the Samaritan version of Numbers 1:18, although the term is traditionally considered to derive from Syriac &quot;Gāgūlṯā&quot; () instead. Although Latin can mean either &quot;a skull&quot; or &quot;the skull&quot; depending on context and numerous English translations render the relevant passages or &quot;Place of the Skull&quot;, the Greek forms of the name grammatically refer to the place of &quot;a&quot; skull and a place named Skull. (The Greek word does more specifically mean the cranium, the upper part of the skull, but it has been used metonymously since antiquity to refer to skulls and heads more generally.)

The Fathers of the Church offered various interpretations of the name and its origin. Jerome considered it a place of execution by beheading (), Pseudo-Tertullian describes it as a place resembling a head, and Origen associated it with legends concerning the skull of Adam. This buried skull of Adam appears in noncanonical medieval legends, including the &quot;Book of the Rolls&quot;, the &quot;Conflict of Adam and Eve with Satan&quot;, the &quot;Cave of Treasures&quot;, and the works of Eutychius, the 9th-century patriarch of Alexandria. The usual form of the legend is that Shem and Melchizedek retrieved the body of Adam from the resting place of Noah&#x27;s ark on Mount Ararat and were led by angels to Golgotha, a skull-shaped hill at the center of the earth where Adam had previously crushed the serpent&#x27;s head following the Fall of Man.

In the 19th century, Wilhelm Ludwig Krafft proposed an alternative derivation of these names, suggesting that the place had actually been known as &quot;Gol Goatha&quot;which he interpreted to mean &quot;heap of death&quot; or &quot;hill of execution&quot;and had become associated with the similar sounding Semitic words for &quot;skull&quot; in folk etymologies. James Fergusson identified this &quot;Goatha&quot; with the &quot;Goʿah&quot; () mentioned in Jeremiah 31:39 as a place near Jerusalem, although Krafft himself identified that location with the separate &quot;Gennáth&quot; () of Josephus, the &quot;Garden Gate&quot; west of the Temple Mount.

==Location==
There is no consensus as to the location of the site. John describes the crucifixion site as being &quot;near the city&quot;. According to Hebrews , it was &quot;outside the city gate&quot;. and both note that the location would have been accessible to &quot;passers-by&quot;. Thus, locating the crucifixion site involves identifying a site that, in the city of Jerusalem some four decades before its destruction in AD70, would have been outside a major gate near enough to the city that the passers-by could not only see him, but also read the inscription &#x27;Jesus the Nazarene, King of the Jews&#x27;.

===Church of the Holy Sepulchre===
Christian tradition since the fourth century has favoured a location now within the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. This places it well within today&#x27;s walls of Jerusalem, which surround the Old City and were rebuilt in the 16th century by the Ottoman Empire. Proponents of the traditional Holy Sepulchre location point to the fact that first-century Jerusalem had a different shape and size from the 16th-century city, leaving the church&#x27;s site outside the pre-AD 70 city walls. Those opposing it doubt this.

Defenders of the traditional site have argued that the site of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre was only brought within the city limits by Herod Agrippa (41–44), who built the so-called Third Wall around a newly settled northern district, while at the time of Jesus&#x27; crucifixion around AD 30 it would still have been just outside the city.

Henry Chadwick (2003) argued that when Hadrian&#x27;s builders replanned the old city, they &quot;incidentally confirm[ed] the bringing of Golgotha inside a new town wall.&quot;

In 2007 Dan Bahat, the former City Archaeologist of Jerusalem and Professor of Land of Israel Studies at Bar-Ilan University, stated that &quot;Six graves from the first century were found on the area of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. That means, this place [was] outside of the city, without any doubt…&quot;.

==Church of the Holy Sepulchre==

The traditional location of Golgotha derives from its identification by Queen Mother Helena, mother of Constantine the Great, in 325. Less than away, Helena also identified the location of the tomb of Jesus and claimed to have discovered the True Cross; her son, Constantine, then built the Church of the Holy Sepulchre around the whole site. In 333, the author of the &quot;Itinerarium Burdigalense&quot;, entering from the east, described the result:

Various archeologists have proposed alternative sites within the Church as locations of the crucifixion. Nazénie Garibian de Vartavan argued that the now-buried Constantinian basilica&#x27;s altar was built over the site.

===Temple to Aphrodite===
Prior to Helena&#x27;s identification, the site had been a temple to Aphrodite. Constantine&#x27;s construction took over most of the site of the earlier temple enclosure, and the &quot;Rotunda&quot; and cloister (which was replaced after the 12th century by the present &quot;Catholicon&quot; and &quot;Calvary chapel&quot;) roughly overlap with the temple building itself; the basilica church Constantine built over the remainder of the enclosure was destroyed at the turn of the 11th century, and has not been replaced. Christian tradition claims that the location had originally been a Christian place of veneration, but that Hadrian had deliberately buried these Christian sites and built his own temple on top, on account of his alleged hatred for Christianity.

There is certainly evidence that , at least as early as 30 years after Hadrian&#x27;s temple had been built, Christians associated it with the site of &quot;Golgotha&quot;; Melito of Sardis, an influential mid-2nd century bishop in the region, described the location as &quot;in the middle of the street, in the middle of the city&quot;, which matches the position of Hadrian&#x27;s temple within the mid-2nd century city.

The Romans typically built a city according to a Hippodamian grid plan – a north–south arterial road, the Cardo (which is now the Suq Khan-ez-Zeit), and an east–west arterial road, the Decumanus Maximus (which is now the Via Dolorosa). The forum would traditionally be located on the intersection of the two roads, with the main temples adjacent. However, due to the obstruction posed by the Temple Mount, as well as the Tenth Legion encampment on the Western Hill, Hadrian&#x27;s city had two &quot;Cardo&quot;, two &quot;Decumanus Maximus&quot;, two forums, and several temples. The Western Forum (now the Muristan) is located on the crossroads of the West Cardo and what is now El-Bazar/David Street, with the Temple of Aphrodite adjacent, on the intersection of the Western Cardo and the Via Dolorosa. The Northern Forum is located north of the Temple Mount, on the junction of the Via Dolorosa and the Eastern Cardo (the Tyropoeon), adjacent to the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus, intentionally built atop the Temple Mount. Another popular holy site that Hadrian converted to a pagan temple was the Pool of Bethesda, possibly referenced to in the fifth chapter of the Gospel of John, on which was built the Temple of Asclepius and Serapis. While the positioning of the Temple of Aphrodite may be, in light of the common Colonia layout, entirely unintentional, Hadrian is known to have concurrently built pagan temples on top of other holy sites in Jerusalem as part of an overall &quot;Romanization&quot; policy.

Archaeological excavations under the Church of the Holy Sepulchre have revealed Christian pilgrims&#x27; graffiti, dating from the period that the Temple of Aphrodite was still present, of a ship, a common early Christian symbol and the etching &quot;DOMINVS IVIMVS&quot;, meaning &quot;Lord, we went&quot;, lending possible support to the statement by Melito of Sardis&#x27; asserting that early Christians identified Golgotha as being in the middle of Hadrian&#x27;s city, rather than outside.

===Rockface===
During 1973–1978 restoration works and excavations inside the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and under the nearby Muristan, it was found that the area was originally a quarry, from which white Meleke limestone was struck; surviving parts of the quarry to the north-east of the chapel of St. Helena are now accessible from within the chapel (by permission). Inside the church is a rock, about 7 m long by 3 m wide by 4.8 m high, that is traditionally believed to be all that now remains visible of &quot;Golgotha&quot;; the design of the church means that the &quot;Calvary Chapel&quot; contains the upper foot or so of the rock, while the remainder is in the chapel beneath it (known as the &quot;tomb of Adam&quot;). Virgilio Corbo, a Franciscan priest and archaeologist, present at the excavations, suggested that from the city the little hill (which still exists) could have looked like a skull.

During a 1986 repair to the floor of the &quot;Calvary Chapel&quot; by the art historian George Lavas and architect Theo Mitropoulos, a round slot of diameter was discovered in the rock, partly open on one side (Lavas attributes the open side to accidental damage during his repairs); although the dating of the slot is uncertain, and could date to Hadrian&#x27;s temple of Aphrodite, Lavas suggested that it could have been the site of the crucifixion, as it would be strong enough to hold in place a wooden trunk of up to in height (among other things). The same restoration work also revealed a crack running across the surface of the rock, which continues down to the &quot;Chapel of Adam&quot;; the crack is thought by archaeologists to have been a result of the quarry workmen encountering a flaw in the rock.

Based on the late 20th century excavations of the site, there have been a number of attempted reconstructions of the profile of the cliff face. These often attempt to show the site as it would have appeared to Constantine. However, as the ground level in Roman times was about lower and the site housed Hadrian&#x27;s temple to Aphrodite, much of the surrounding rocky slope must have been removed long before Constantine built the church on the site. The height of the &quot;Golgotha&quot; rock itself would have caused it to jut through the platform level of the Aphrodite temple, where it would be clearly visible. The reason for Hadrian not cutting the rock down is uncertain, but Virgilio Corbo suggested that a statue, probably of Aphrodite, was placed on it, a suggestion also made by Jerome. Some archaeologists have suggested that prior to Hadrian&#x27;s use, the rock outcrop had been a &quot;nefesh&quot; – a Jewish funeral monument, equivalent to the stele.

===Pilgrimages to Constantine&#x27;s Church===

The Itinerarium Burdigalense speaks of Golgotha in 333: &quot;... On the left hand is the little hill of Golgotha where the Lord was crucified. About a stone&#x27;s throw from thence is a vault (crypta) wherein His body was laid, and rose again on the third day. There, at present, by the command of the Emperor Constantine, has been built a basilica, that is to say, a church of wondrous beauty&quot;, Cyril of Jerusalem, a distinguished theologian of the early Church, and eyewitness to the early days of Constantine&#x27;s edifice, speaks of Golgotha in eight separate passages, sometimes as near to the church where he and his listeners assembled: &quot;Golgotha, the holy hill standing above us here, bears witness to our sight: the Holy Sepulchre bears witness, and the stone which lies there to this day.&quot; And just in such a way the pilgrim Egeria often reported in 383: &quot;… the church, built by Constantine, which is situated in Golgotha…&quot; and also bishop Eucherius of Lyon wrote to the island presbyter Faustus in 440: &quot;Golgotha is in the middle between the Anastasis and the Martyrium, the place of the Lord&#x27;s passion, in which still appears that rock which once endured the very cross on which the Lord was.&quot; &quot;Breviarius de Hierosolyma&quot; reports in 530: &quot;From there (the middle of the basilica), you enter into Golgotha, where there is a large court. Here the Lord was crucified. All around that hill, there are silver screens.&quot; (See also: Eusebius in 338.)
==Gordon&#x27;s Calvary==

In 1842, Otto Thenius, a theologian and biblical scholar from Dresden, Germany, was the first to publish a proposal that the rocky knoll north of Damascus Gate was the biblical &quot;Golgotha&quot;. He relied heavily on the research of Edward Robinson. In 1882–83, Major-General Charles George Gordon endorsed this view; subsequently the site has sometimes been known as Gordon&#x27;s Calvary. The location, usually referred to today as &quot;Skull Hill&quot;, is beneath a cliff that contains two large sunken holes, which Gordon regarded as resembling the eyes of a skull. He and a few others before him believed that the skull-like appearance would have caused the location to be known as Golgotha.

Nearby is an ancient rock-cut tomb known today as the Garden Tomb, which Gordon proposed as the tomb of Jesus. The Garden Tomb contains several ancient burial places, although the archaeologist Gabriel Barkay has proposed that the tomb dates to the 7th century BC and that the site may have been abandoned by the 1st century.

Eusebius comments that Golgotha was in his day (the 4th century) pointed out &quot;north of Mount Zion&quot;. While &quot;Mount Zion&quot; was used previously in reference to the Temple Mount itself, Josephus, the first-century AD historian who knew the city as it was before the Roman destruction of Jerusalem, identified Mount Zion as being the Western Hill (the current Mount Zion), which is south of both the Garden Tomb and the Holy Sepulchre. Eusebius&#x27; comment therefore offers no additional argument for either location.

<text>Abdiqasim Salad Hassan (; ; born on 1 January 1942), also known as Abdiqasim Salad, is a Somali politician who served as the fifth President of Somalia from 2000 to 2004. He helped found the Transitional National Government and previously served as Minister of Interior in the government of Siad Barre.

==Biography==
Hassan was born in the town of Galdogob, situated in the north-central Mudug region of the former Italian Somaliland. His family hails from the Habar Gidir sub-clan of the Gorgaarte Hawiye.

Hassan pursued his post-secondary education in the USSR, graduating in 1965 from the Biology Department of Lomonosov Moscow State University.

==Political career==

===Early career===
A key founder of Somalia&#x27;s &quot;Sulh&quot; (reconciliation) group of which former Foreign Minister Abdirahman Jama Barre was also a part, Hassan has held several important positions in the Somali government, most notably as Siad Barre&#x27;s last Minister of Interior from 1990 to 1991. As such, Hassan was responsible for all internal security agencies including the National Security Service (NSS), the Investigative Department of the Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party, the police, and the Deputy Prime Ministership.

Additionally, Hassan was the 2nd Deputy Prime Minister of Somalia in the late 1980s. Abdirahman Jama Barre served opposite him as the 1st Deputy Prime Minister.

After the Barre&#x27;s administration&#x27;s ouster in 1991 and the start of the civil war in Somalia, Hassan left for Cairo.

===President of Somalia===
In 2000, the Transitional National Government (TNG) was established as Somalia&#x27;s new interim central government. On August 26, Hassan presented himself as a candidate in that year&#x27;s elections for a new TNG President. He received 145 of the total votes, with former Somalia ambassador to Washington Abdullahi Ahmed Addou earning 92 votes on the third ballot. Hassan was sworn into office the following day.

Hassan&#x27;s administration controlled parts of the Somali capital, Mogadishu, with the rest of the southern half of the country under the control of various faction leaders. Shortly before the mandate of the Transitional National Government expired in August 2003, Hassan withdrew from talks aimed at forming a new government. Prime Minister Hassan Abshir Farah accused him of trying to make the negotiations fail to extend his time in office. This resulted in Farah&#x27;s dismissal by Hassan.

In 2004, Hassan ran for re-election in that year&#x27;s presidential race. On October 10, 2004, in a session held by the Transitional Federal Parliament (TFP), Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed was elected as President of the Transitional Federal Government (TFG), a successor interim body to the TNG that Ahmed had helped establish earlier in the year. Ahmed received 189 votes from the TFG Parliament, while the closest contender, Abdullahi Ahmed Addou, got 79 votes in the third round of voting. Hassan peacefully withdrew his candidature.

==Personal life==
During the Ethiopian occupation of Somalia, Hassan lived in Mogadishu. His home was raided by Ethiopian and TFG troops during 2007 and 2008.

Since the end of his term as President, Hassan has rallied for a safer Somalia. He takes part in numerous events in and around Somalia where he talks to his fellow countrymen about how they can change their nation for the better.

He now divides his time between Somalia and Egypt.

<text>Óscar Nicanor Duarte Frutos (born 11 October 1956) is a Paraguayan lawyer, journalist and politician who served as the 47th President of Paraguay from 2003 to 2008. A member of the Colorado Party, he became the central figure of Paraguayan politics during his presidency.

Born into a lower class rural family, Duarte pursued a career in law and later journalism, becoming a radio sports commentator and columnist. In the 1990s he got into politics, serving in the cabinets of Presidents Juan Carlos Wasmosy and Luis González Macchi, both times as Minister of Education. Duarte became one of the top allies of the Colorado Party politician Luis María Argaña, inheriting his political clout after his assassination in March 1999. Duarte was elected president in 2003, by a plurality of 37%, taking advantage of a three-way split in the opposition to the incumbent Colorado Party. Inaugurated at 46, Duarte was one of Paraguay&#x27;s youngest presidents, as well as its first non-Catholic, being a Protestant convert.

Duarte&#x27;s administration was marked by a rejection of the path his country and party had taken in the past decade, turning away from neoliberalism to instead embrace the pink tide and 21st century socialism. Overall, the Paraguayan economy grew during his tenure, mostly as part of a recovery from the crisis of the 1990s. His support of and from Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, as well as his proposal to amend the constitution to allow the reelection of the president, made large parts of the Paraguayan public see him as increasingly authoritarian, leading in part to the defeat of his protégé, Blanca Ovelar, in the 2008 election.

In said 2008 election Duarte was elected senator, but the Senate refused to swear him in, arguing that it would be unconstitutional, this happened again in 2018. After leaving office Duarte served as Ambassador to Argentina from 2013 to 2016, under the presidency of Horacio Cartes. He was later appointed director of the Yacyretá Dam. Like all former presidents, Duarte currently holds the ceremonial and powerless title of Senator for life.

== Early life and career ==

=== Family ===
Óscar Nicanor Duarte Frutos was born on 11 October 1956 in Coronel Oviedo, Caaguazú, to a rural lower-class &quot;mestizo&quot; family. His father, Héctor Roque Duarte, was a police officer and songwriter who fought on the &quot;colorado&quot; side of the Paraguayan Civil War of 1947, under general Patricio Colmán. His mother, Disnarda Antonia Frutos, was a teacher. Nicanor started working at sawmills when he was eleven, while attending school. At fourteen he joined the Colorado Party, something that was &quot;de facto&quot; mandatory at the time, due to the dictatorship.

=== Education and early career ===
In the 1970s Duarte moved to Asunción, where he studied law and journalism. He became a sports commentator, working at a Caaguazú radio station. In the early 1980s he was hired by the editor-in-chief of Última Hora, where he started working as a columnist. At this point in his life Duarte was fairly poor, he lived in a small apartment and had few material possessions. In 1984 he obtained a law degree from the Catholic University of Asuncion and in 1989 a doctorate from the National University of Asuncion.

=== Wife and children ===
In the 1970s he started dating María Gloria Penayo Solaeche, who he married in 1984. They had six children: José, Héctor, María, Martín, Santiago and Facundo. Penayo is a member of a Mennonite church, Duarte decided to convert alongside her.

=== Political career ===
After the fall of Alfredo Stroessner in 1989, Duarte got more involved in politics and started climbing up the ladder of the Colorado Party throughout the 1990s. He became Vice Minister of Education during the Rodríguez administration and was later appointed Minister of Education by President Juan Carlos Wasmosy in 1993.

Duarte became an opponent of army general and &quot;colorado&quot; &quot;caudillo&quot; Lino Oviedo, who led a failed coup against Wasmosy in 1996. His opposition to Oviedo drifted Duarte increasingly closer to the general&#x27;s main rival, Luis María Argaña, who led his own faction within the party, the &quot;Colorado Reconciliation Movement&quot;. In 1997 Duarte left the Ministry of Education to instead be Argaña&#x27;s running mate in the Colorado Party primaries, held to elect the party&#x27;s nominee for president in the 1998 election. In an effort to unite the party, Argaña became the running mate of the &quot;oviedista&quot; Raúl Cubas, who won the election.

In March 1999 Vice President Argaña was assassinated. This sparked rage and fear of another coup by Oviedo, which led to large protests that eventually made Cubas resign. The &quot;argañista&quot; Luis González Macchi was sworn in as president and quickly appointed Duarte back to the Ministry of Education. Duarte inherited Argaña&#x27;s political faction and clout, effectively becoming his successor. In 2001 he resigned as Education Minister to become president of the Colorado Party.

== 2003 presidential election ==
=== Colorado Party primary elections ===
On 22 December 2002, Duarte won the Colorado Party&#x27;s nomination for president in the 2003 general election. He defeated Osvaldo Domínguez Dibb, a wealthy businessman known for being president of the Club Olimpia football team. Domínguez Dibb was the leader of the &quot;neoestronista&quot; movement, having been a big supported of the dictator and related to him through marriage.

=== General election ===
On 27 April 2003, Duarte won the presidential election with a plurality, 37,1% of the vote. He beat Julio César &quot;Yoyito&quot; Franco of the Authentic Radical Liberal Party (24%), Pedro Fadul of the recently created Beloved Fatherland Party (21,3%) and Guillermo Sánchez of the &quot;oviedista&quot; National Union of Ethical Citizens (13,5%). This three-way split in the opposition to the Colorado Party played in his favor.

==Presidency (2003–2008)==

Nicanor Duarte pursued policies which were somewhat more left-wing than has been the case for the Colorado Party over its 60-year rule of Paraguay. At least in speeches, he had opposed free trade and reached out to regional Latin American countries with left-leaning governments.

==Later life==
In two separate instances, Duarte Frutos ran for, was elected, and attempted to be sworn in as an active, voting Senator, despite Paraguayan law stating that upon leaving office, presidents can only be &quot;senador vitalicio&quot; (senator for life), a ceremonial, non-voting post.

Duarte first announced his resignation as president, in order to assume a position as Senator on 1 July 2008. He presented his resignation on 23 June 2008 to then President of the Congress of Paraguay, senator Miguel Abdón Saguier.

Opposition and government-endorsed members of the Paraguayan Congress immediately announced they were going to boycott Duarte Frutos&#x27;s resignation by not attending the extraordinary session of the Congress where it would be determined whether the President&#x27;s resignation would be accepted or not. While some held positions in favour of Duarte Frutos assuming as senator, citing a sentence from the Superior Electoral Justice Tribunal, other congresspeople argued that Duarte Frutos&#x27;s swearing-in senator would be illegal, and Congress would be violating the Constitution if swearing-in Duarte Frutos without the legal quorum. If Congress did not accept the resignation, Duarte would have to continue his term until 15 August and would be unable to become an elected senator, becoming instead a non-voting senator for life as a former president. As expected, the quorum was not reached at the extraordinary session called for this reason for 24 June 2008. Since Duarte Frutos could not occupy the seat belonging to him on 1 July, Jorge Cespedes, from the Colorado Party, was assigned and assumed as titular of the vacant seat of Duarte at the Senate.

On 26 August, another extraordinary session of Congress was called to swear-in Duarte Frutos, but once again many congresspeople left the session, which was declared &quot;empty&quot; or abandoned by Congress President Enrique Gonzalez Quintana. Nonetheless, Gonzalez Quintana proceeded to the swearing-in and swore Duarte Frutos, who arrived at the Legislative Palace followed by fellow Colorado Party supporters. However, on 4 September, the Paraguayan Senate, in session to discuss resolutions on the crisis concerning Duarte Frutos&#x27;s swearing-in as senator, finally approved a bill, revalidating a previous bill that had not been approved the previous session of 28 August. On the session of the 28 August, Jorge Cespedes was confirmed as titular senator, instead of Duarte Frutos, who was in turn confirmed as &quot;senador vitalicio&quot;, or senator for life, handing its seat upon Cespedes.

In 2018, Duarte Frutos and then-outgoing Paraguayan President Horacio Cartes were elected as senators to represent the Colorado Party in the 2018 Paraguayan General elections, raising criticism from the opposition that their senate candidacies were unconstitutional, but the Superior Tribunal of Electoral Justice overruled that decision, claiming that both Cartes and Duarte Frutos were eligible to run for the Senate. Ultimately, neither were able to assume as Senators this time either.

<doc id="387595" wikidata="Q15147" url="?curid=387595" title="Jorge Batlle">
<text>Jorge Luis Batlle Ibáñez (; &quot;Batlle&quot; locally or ; 25 October 1927 – 24 October 2016) was a Uruguayan politician and lawyer, who served as the 38th president of Uruguay from 2000 to 2005. A member of the Colorado Party, he previously served as National Representative from 1959 to 1967, and as Senator of the Republic from 1985 to 1990 and from 1990 to 1999.

The eldest son of the 30th president Luis Batlle Berres and a member of the Batlle family, he was the fourth member of the family to serve as president of the country. He graduated from the University of the Republic in 1959 with a law degree, and then began a career as a journalist in &quot;El Día&quot; newspaper. He began his political career in the 1950s, being elected National Representative in the 1958 general election. During the civil-military dictatorship he was banned and in the 1984 general election that led to the democratic transition he was prevented from running for president, he could only run for the Senate.

His presidency was marked by the worsening of a banking crisis and a foot-and-mouth epidemic that affected the country&#x27;s economy. Some of his initiatives consisted of the creation of the , an investigative body on human rights with the purpose of determining the situation of those detained-disappeared during the civil-military dictatorship. In foreign policy, Batlle&#x27;s government strengthened Uruguay&#x27;s ties with the United States and broke diplomatic relations with Cuba.

==Early life and education==
Jorge Luis Batlle Ibáñez was born on October 25, 1927 in Montevideo. He was the eldest son of Luis Batlle Berres and Matilde Ibáñez Tálice. He had two siblings, Luis (1930–2016) and Matilde (born 1932). He was a member of the Batlle family originally from Sitges, Catalonia, Spain, and which includes several presidents of Uruguay, such as José Batlle y Ordoñez, who was his great-uncle. On his paternal side, he was of Catalan descent, whereas on his mother&#x27;s side, he was of Italian descent.

He attended the Elbio Fernández School and the German School of Montevideo. He obtained a law degree from the University of the Republic in 1959.

== Early political career (1958–1965) ==
By 1958, when he was first elected Congressman for the Colorado Party, Batlle had been active in journalism both in Radio &quot;Ariel&quot; and the newspaper &quot;Acción&quot;. He was also by that time a member of the governing body of his Party. He unsuccessfully ran for president in 1966, and was part of a financial scandal in 1968, which was never proven. 

== National leadership (1965–1971) ==
In 1965 Batlle was elected the sole leader of List 15 of the Colorado Party, a position that had become vacant after the death of his father the previous year. He proposed a return to a presidential system, eliminating the National Council of Government, and was one of the drafters and promoters of the constitutional reform that gave rise to the 1967 Constitution. He ran for president again in 1971, without success.

== Civic-military dictatorship (1973–1985) ==
During the period of civilian-military administration in Uruguay (1973–1985), Batlle did not occupy any legislative or official position, having been banned from political activity by decree. He was detained on several occasions. He did preside over the Legislative General Assembly in February 1985, when the first democratically elected Congress was seated after the military interregnum. He has a very active legislative record. Dr. Batlle was also a leading promoter and drafter of two Constitutional Amendments, one in 1966 and the other more recently in 1996. He was defeated again in the 1989 and 1994 presidential elections, and won the 1999 elections, taking office in 2000.

== Presidency (2000–2005) ==
Batlle took office at a particularly difficult moment for Uruguay, as an economic depression led the country 2002 Uruguay banking crisis and close to sovereign default, and a third of the population below the poverty line. Batlle&#x27;s determination to reduce public spending, aimed at preserving the macroeconomic balance, made it possible for Uruguay to be highly regarded as a country with a sound management of its economic affairs. US president George W. Bush helped him to prevent default with $1.5 billion in credit.

His administration had to deal with a foot-and-mouth disease outbreak, which threatened access of Uruguayan beef to international markets. Before the end of his term, Uruguay had re-gained disease-free status.

Batlle firmly backed MERCOSUR, which he saw as instrumental for an open regional integration into the world economy. He favoured strengthening MERCOSUR by forming associations such as the one envisaged in the so-called &quot;4+1&quot; agreement with the United States. He maintained close diplomatic ties with the US at a time when the Pink tide in Latin America was marked by several regional governments that distanced themselves from the US. He had a diplomatic conflict with Cuba, as he criticised the human rights record of the Castro&#x27;s regime.

In 2002, he deals with the law on the legalization of prostitution.

He proposed the legalization of cocaine, as a way to reduce the political clout of drug cartels.

He was also in favour of the creation of the Free Trade Association of the Americas (FTAA). As president, Batlle was firmly set against protectionism and subsidies of any kind; he has been a consistent spokesman for unhampered free trade.

Human rights deserve a separate chapter in Batlle&#x27;s presidency. He helped create the Comisión para la Paz. Later on, he announced the finding of Macarena, the granddaughter of Argentine poet Juan Gelman born to her disappeared mother.

== Post-presidency (2005–2016) ==

=== Final years ===
Jorge Batlle stayed active in politics after the end of his presidency. He criticised the Uruguayan presidents that succeeded him (Tabaré Vázquez and José Mujica) through newspapers columns and social media.

=== Death and funeral ===
Jorge Batlle fainted and struck his head after he fainted and fell during an event at the Colorado party. He was hospitalized at the Sanatorio Americano hospital, and underwent surgery to stop an intracranial hemorrhage. The operation failed, and he died on 24 October 2016, one day shy of his 89th birthday. Uruguay declared a day of national mourning upon his death.

== Personal life ==
Batlle married Noemí Lamuraglia in 1957. They had two children, Beatriz (born 1962) and Raúl Lorenzo (born 1965).

<doc id="387597" wikidata="Q177875" url="?curid=387597" title="Macedonian denar">
<text>The denar (; paucal: denari / ; abbreviation: den / ; ISO code: MKD) is the currency of North Macedonia. Though subdivided into one hundred deni (), coins with a denomination of less than one denar have not been in use since 2013.

==History==
The first denar was established as a temporary currency on 26 April 1992 in the then-Republic of Macedonia, replacing the 1990 version of the Yugoslav dinar at a 1:1 parity. In May 1993, the currency was reformed and a new denar was introduced, with one new denar being equal to 100 old denars.

===Etymology===
The name denar comes from the name of the ancient Roman monetary unit, the &quot;denarius&quot;. The abbreviation is ден, the first three Cyrillic letters of its name.

==First denar (1992–1993)==
The first denar was a temporary currency introduced on 26 April 1992 to replace the Yugoslav dinar at 1:1 parity and establish the monetary independence of Macedonia.

===History===
Macedonia declared independence from Yugoslavia on 8 September 1991. At the time, the country was using the Yugoslav dinar. But secret preparations were begun to introduce its own currency, and by April 1992, Macedonia was ready to acquire monetary independence from Yugoslavia. On 26 April, the National Bank of Macedonia was established and the denar declared the national currency. Notes in the form of &quot;value coupons&quot; entered circulation the following day, and on 30 April 1992, the Yugoslav dinar ceased to be legal tender. In May 1993, the first denar was replaced at a rate of 100 to 1 by a new, permanent denar consisting of notes and coins.

===Coins===
No coins were issued for the first denar.

===Banknotes===
Temporary notes (&quot;value coupons&quot;) were introduced on 27 April 1992, although preparations for producing them began much earlier. The notes remained in circulation until they were replaced by permanent notes of the second denar in 1993.

====Production====
Printing of the notes started on 15 January 1992 at the “11 October” printing firm in Prilep. The difficulties of creating a new currency in secret were reflected in the notes themselves. The paper, purchased from Slovenia, proved to be of poor quality and lacked adequate security. Although denominated in denari, the name of the currency did not appear on the notes because they were printed prior to the adoption of the Law on the Monetary Unit. Likewise, the issuer appeared as the &quot;National Bank of Macedonia&quot;, not its successor, the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia.

====Design====
The notes were designed by a young employee of the &quot;11 October&quot; printer, who had only one week and a limited budget to design them. Thus the six lowest denominations were identical, with the exception of their colours. All featured a man and two women picking tobacco leaves on the front, with the back devoted to the Ilinden monument in Kruševo, which, according to the bank, “expresses the eternal fight of citizens of Macedonia for life in peace and freedom.”

===Exchange rates===
The denar was introduced with a fixed exchange rate of 360 denars to the Deutsche Mark. There was a devaluation in October 1992 and change to the basket peg, new devaluation in December 1992 and abandonment of the peg in mid-1993.

==Second denar (1993–present)==

===Coins===
====First series (1993)====
In May 1993, coins for the second denar were introduced in denominations of 50 deni, and 1, 2, and 5 denars. The coins were designed by Dimče Boškoski and Snežana Atanasovska. In November 2008, 10 and 50 denar coins were introduced, while the 50 deni coin was withdrawn in 2013. Due to its low mintage, it had only been struck in 1993 and was practically never seen in circulation.

Since 1996, a large number of commemorative coins have been issued for collectors; a listing can be found on the national bank website.

Coins are minted at the &quot;Suvenir&quot; factory in Samokov, a village near Makedonski Brod.

====Second series (2020)====
Due to the country&#x27;s name change as part of the Prespa Agreement, a new set of coins featuring the new name of North Macedonia is being released into circulation, starting with 1 denar coins in April 2021.

====FAO coinage (1995)====
In 1995, circulation coins of 1, 2, and 5 denar denominations were struck in honor of the United Nations&#x27; Food and Agriculture Organization.

===Banknotes===
In 1993, the new denar was issued in denominations of 10, 20, 50, 100, and 500 denar notes. The 20 denar note was only issued in this first series. In 1996, 1000 and 5000 denar notes were added. In 2016, notes of 200 and 2,000 denars were issued, while the national bank began withdrawing the 5000 denar banknote from circulation to re-balance the structure of notes in circulation. In 2017, the national bank unveiled its current polymer banknotes, the 10 and 50 denar notes, and put them into circulation on May 15.

===Exchange rates===
Since October 1995, the nominal exchange rate of the Denar was pegged against the Deutsche Mark. Since January 2002, it is pegged against the euro.

The denar is de facto pegged to the euro using a stabilization agreement at a rate of 1 EUR=61.3644 MKD +/- 1%.

<doc id="387605" wikidata="Q273739" url="?curid=387605" title="Tāufaʻāhau Tupou IV">
<text>Tāufaʻāhau Tupou IV (Siaosi Tāufaʻāhau Tupoulahi; 4 July 1918 – 10 September 2006) was King of Tonga from 1965 until his death in 2006. He was the tallest and heaviest Tongan monarch, weighing and measuring .

== Biography ==

He was born to Viliami Tungī Mailefihi and Queen Sālote Tupou III. His full baptismal name was Siaosi Tāufaʻāhau Tupoulahi, but he was soon better known by the traditional title Tupoutoʻa, which was bestowed upon him in 1935 and subsequently became reserved for crown princes of Tonga. This title was supplemented by the one he inherited from his father, Tungī (or using both: Tupoutoʻa Tungī, in that time written as &quot;Tuboutoʻa Tugi&quot;). He kept the Tungī title until his death. From a traditional point of view he was not only the Tungī, which is the direct descendant from the Tuʻi Haʻatakalaua, but he was also, on becoming king, the 22nd Tuʻi Kanokupolu. The link with the Tuʻi Tonga line, however, was more indirect. He was not a Tuʻi Tonga in his own right (the office having gone over into the Kalaniuvalu line), but his grandmother Lavinia Veiongo (wife of George Tupou II) was the great-granddaughter of Laufilitonga, the last Tuʻi Tonga, and his wife Halaevalu Mataʻaho (not to be confused with the King&#x27;s wife of the same name and same family), who was the daughter of Tupou ʻAhomeʻe, who was the daughter of Lātūfuipeka, the Tamahā (sister of the Tuʻi Tonga). By consequence, the King&#x27;s daughter, Pilolevu, was the first Tongan woman to descend from the bloodlines of the three major royal dynasties and become the highest-ranking person ever.

Tāufaʻāhau was a keen sportsman and religious preacher in his youth. He was educated at Newington College and studied law at Sydney University while residing at Wesley College. His graduation from Sydney University was described as the first of any Tongan. He was appointed minister of education by Queen Sālote in 1943, minister of health in 1944, and in 1949, premier. During his tenure as education minister, he initiated reforms to standardise the Tongan alphabet.

He remained a lay preacher of the Free Wesleyan Church until his death, and in some circumstances, was empowered to appoint an acting church president.

== Reign ==

Tāufaʻāhau became King of Tonga on the death of his mother in 1965. His coronation took place on 4 July 1967, his 49th birthday, in Nukuʻalofa, with dignitaries including the Duke of Kent and New Zealand Prime Minister Keith Holyoake in attendance. On 4 June 1970, he presided over a ceremony marking the end of the British protectorate over Tonga and its transition to a sovereign state. He visited many far-flung countries during his reign. 

At one point in the 1970s, he was the heaviest monarch in the world, weighing in at . For his visits to Germany, the German government used to commission special chairs that could support his weight. The King used to take them home, considering them as state presents. He was also very tall, standing at . Swedish shoemaker Per-Enok Kero reported that he &quot;weighed 180 kilos and had shoe size 47 in length and 52 in breadth.&quot;

During the 1980s, his government adopted a tone of appeasement towards France in its Pacific nuclear tests at Moruroa, which he visited at the invitation of Gaston Flosse. When he was questioned by a journalist on this issue, the king said that &quot;if France considered [the tests] necessary for its defence it was a choice which must be respected&quot;. His government&#x27;s position put Tonga at odds with other Pacific countries which publicly opposed the conduction of the nuclear tests.

In the 1990s, he took part in a national fitness campaign, losing a third of his weight. By the 2000s, his great political authority and influence in Tonga&#x27;s essentially aristocratic system of government, together with the country&#x27;s nobleswho controlled seventy per cent of the Legislative Assembly of Tonga at the timeand the wealth accumulated by his children, renewed calls for a democratisation of the political system. The king himself had dismissed such demands, pointing to political crises in neighbouring Fiji. His involvement in an investment scandal in 2001, involving his American financial advisor Jesse Bogdonoff, attracted much media attention; the fact he had previously appointed Bogdonoff the official court jester, though likely only done as a joke for Bogdonoff&#x27;s birthday on 1 April (April Fools&#x27; Day), compounded the scandal&#x27;s embarrassment. In 2004, he was named a press freedom predator by Reporters Without Borders, a move which was criticised by the owner of an independent newspaper in Tonga.

In 2005, the government spent several weeks negotiating with striking civil service workers before reaching a settlement. The king&#x27;s nephew, ʻUluvalu (the 6th Tuʻipelehake), served as mediator. A constitutional commission presented a series of recommendations for constitutional reform to the King a few weeks before his death.

== Death and funeral ==
On 15 August 2006, Tongan Prime Minister Feleti Sevele interrupted radio and television broadcasts to announce the king was gravely ill in the Mercy Hospital in Auckland and to ask the 104,000 people of the island chain to pray for their monarch. He died on 10 September at 23:34 NZST, after reigning for nearly 41 years. His daughter was reportedly by his bedside when he died. He was succeeded by his eldest son, George Tupou V.

The king was buried on 19 September 2006 at Malaʻekula, the royal cemetery in Tongatapu. Thousands of Tongans watched the funeral, which blended Christian and ancient Polynesian burial rites. The funeral was overseen by the royal undertaker and his men, known as the .

Mourners included foreign dignitaries from 23 countries, including Japanese crown prince Naruhito; Australian governor-general Michael Jeffery; New Zealand governor-general Dame Silvia Cartwright and prime minister Helen Clark; Fijian vice-president Ratu Joni Madraiwiwi and prime minister Laisenia Qarase; Vanuatu president Kalkot Mataskelekele; governor of American Samoa Togiola Tulafono; Niue premier Young Vivian; president of French Polynesia Oscar Temaru; and the Duke of Gloucester, a cousin of Queen Elizabeth II.

== Marriage and children ==
He married a distant relative, Halaevalu Mataʻaho ʻAhomeʻe (1926–2017), on 10 June 1947, during a double nuptial ceremony with his brother Prince Fatafehi Tuʻipelehake. The couple had four children:

* King George Tupou V (Siaosi Tāufaʻāhau Manumataongo Tukuʻaho Tupou; 1948–2012), better known during his tenure as heir by the hereditary noble title Tupoutoʻa.
* Princess Royal Salote Mafileʻo Pilolevu Tuita (; born 1951); Lady Tuita by marriage.
* Prince Fatafehi ʻAlaivahamamaʻo Tukuʻaho (1954–2004); stripped of his title after marrying a commoner, later bestowed with the hereditary title of Māʻatu.
* King Tupou VI (ʻAhoʻeitu ʻUnuakiʻotonga Tukuʻaho; born 1959), known prior to his ascension to the throne by his hereditary titles: ʻUlukālala Lavaka Ata, then after his elder brother&#x27;s ascension, Tupoutoʻa Lavaka. As his brother died without legitimate issue, he became king in 2012.

<text>Louis Germain David de Funès de Galarza (; 31 July 1914 – 27 January 1983) was a French actor and comedian. He is France&#x27;s favourite actor, according to a series of polls conducted since the late 1960s, having played over 150 roles in film and over 100 on stage. His acting style is remembered for its high-energy performance and his wide range of facial expressions and tics. A considerable part of his best-known acting was directed by Jean Girault.

The larger-than-life, conservative &quot;petit bourgeois&quot; characters he played, who typically kissed up to authority while persecuting their subordinates, particularly resonated with the changing Western societies of the 1960s and drove him to success. Yet in private life, De Funès was a notoriously shy and reserved man, and a devout Catholic.

One of the most famous French actors of all time, Louis de Funès remains to this day the most bankable actor in French cinema history. He enjoys widespread international recognition: in addition to his immense fame in the French-speaking world, he remains a household name throughout most of continental Europe including the former Eastern Bloc, the former Soviet Union, as well as Iran, Turkey, and Israel. Despite this international popularity, Louis de Funès remains an obscure figure in the English-speaking world. He was exposed to a wider audience only once in the United States, in 1973, with the release of &quot;The Mad Adventures of Rabbi Jacob&quot;, which is best remembered for its Rabbi Jacob dance scene and was nominated for a Golden Globe Award.

De Funès has two museums dedicated to his life and acting: one in the Château de Clermont, near Nantes, where he resided, as well as another in the town of Saint-Raphaël, Southern France.

==Early life==
Louis de Funès was born on 31 July 1914 in Courbevoie, a Parisian suburb, to parents who hailed from Seville, Spain. Since the couple&#x27;s families opposed their marriage, they eloped to France in 1904. His father, Carlos Luis de Funès de Galarza, was a nobleman whose mother descended from the Counts de Galarza (of Basque origin). His father&#x27;s family was from Funes. He had been a lawyer in Spain, but became a diamond cutter upon arriving in France. His mother, Leonor Soto Reguera, was Galician, daughter to Galician lawyer Teolindo Soto Barro, of Portuguese descent.

Known to friends and intimates as &quot;Fufu&quot;, De Funès spoke French, Spanish, and English. During his youth, he was fond of drawing and playing the piano. He was an alumnus of the Lycée Condorcet in Paris. He later dropped out, and his early life was rather inconspicuous; as a youth and young adult, De Funès held menial jobs, from which he was repeatedly fired. He became a bar pianist, working mostly as a jazz pianist in Pigalle, Paris, where he made his customers laugh each time he grimaced. He studied acting for one year at the Simon acting school, where he made some useful contacts, including Daniel Gélin, among others. In 1936, he married Germaine Louise Élodie Carroyer, with whom he had one child: a son named Daniel; the couple divorced in late 1942. Through the early 1940s, De Funès continued playing piano in clubs, thinking there was not much call for a short, balding, skinny actor. His wife and Daniel Gélin encouraged him until he managed to overcome his fear of rejection. His wife supported him in the most difficult moments and helped him to manage his career efficiently.
During the occupation of Paris in the Second World War, he continued his piano studies at a music school, where he fell in love with a secretary, Jeanne Barthelémy de Maupassant. She had fallen in love with &quot;the young man who played jazz like God&quot;; they married in 1943 and remained together for forty years until his death in 1983. They had two sons: Patrick (born on 27 January 1944), who became a doctor, and Olivier (born on 11 August 1949), who became a pilot for Air France Europe and also followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps by becoming an actor. Olivier de Funès became known for the roles he played in some of his father&#x27;s films (&quot;Les Grandes Vacances&quot;, &quot;Fantômas se déchaîne&quot;, &quot;Le Grand Restaurant&quot; and &quot;Hibernatus&quot; being the most famous).

== Theatrical career ==
De Funès began his show business career in the theatre, where he enjoyed moderate success and also played small roles in films. Even after he attained the status of a movie star, he continued to play theatre roles. His stage career culminated in a magnificent performance in the play &quot;Oscar&quot;, a role which he would reprise a few years later in the film adaptation.

== Film career ==

In 1945, thanks to his contact with Daniel Gélin, De Funès made his film debut at the age of 31 with a bit part in Jean Stelli&#x27;s &quot;La Tentation de Barbizon&quot;. He appears on screen for less than 40 seconds in the role of the porter of the cabaret &quot;Le Paradis&quot;, welcoming the character played by Jérôme Chambon in the entrance hall and pointing him to the double doors leading to the main room, saying: &quot;C&#x27;est par ici, Monsieur&quot; (&quot;It&#x27;s this way, Sir&quot;). Chambon declines the invitation, pushing the door himself instead of pulling it open. De Funès then says: &quot;Bien, il a son compte celui-là, aujourd&#x27;hui!&quot; (&quot;Well, he had enough, today!&quot;).

He went on to perform in 130 film roles over the next 20 years, playing minor roles in over 80 movies before being offered his first leading roles. During this period, De Funès developed a daily routine of professional activities: in the morning, he did dubbing for recognized artists such as Totò, an Italian comic of the time; during the afternoon, he did film work; and in the evening, he performed as a theatre actor.

From 1945 to 1955, he appeared in 50 films, usually as an extra or walk-on. In 1954, he went on to star in such films as &quot;Ah! Les belles bacchantes&quot; and &quot;Le Mouton à cinq pattes&quot;. A break came in 1956, when he appeared as the black-market pork butcher Jambier (another small role) in Claude Autant-Lara&#x27;s well-known World War II comedy, &quot;La Traversée de Paris&quot;. He achieved stardom in 1963 with Jean Girault&#x27;s film, &quot;Pouic-Pouic&quot;. This successful film guaranteed De Funès top billing in all of his subsequent films. At the age of 49, De Funès unexpectedly became a major star of international renown with the success of &quot;Le gendarme de Saint-Tropez&quot;. After their first successful collaboration, director Jean Girault perceived De Funès as the ideal actor to play the part of the scheming, opportunistic and sycophant gendarme; the first film would lead to a series of six.

Another collaboration with director Gérard Oury produced a memorable tandem of De Funès with Bourvil—another great comic actor—in the 1965 film, &quot;Le Corniaud&quot;. The success of the de Funès-Bourvil partnership was repeated in &quot;La Grande Vadrouille&quot;, one of the most successful and the largest-grossing film ever made in France, drawing an audience of 17.27 million. It remains his greatest success. Oury envisaged a further reunion of the two comics in his film &quot;La Folie des grandeurs&quot;, but Bourvil&#x27;s death in 1970 led to the unlikely pairing of De Funès with Yves Montand in that film. Notwithstanding, the film was a success.
Eventually, De Funès became France&#x27;s leading comic actor. Between 1964 and 1979, he topped the French box office of the year&#x27;s most successful movies seven times. In 1968, all three of his films were in the top ten in France for the year, topped by &quot;Le Petit Baigneur&quot;, with its memorable mass scene.

He co-starred with many of the major French actors of his time, including Jean Marais and Mylène Demongeot in the &quot;Fantômas&quot; trilogy, and also Jean Gabin, Fernandel, Coluche, Annie Girardot, and Yves Montand. He also worked with Jean Girault in the famous &quot;Gendarmes&quot; series. In a departure from the gendarme image, De Funès collaborated with Claude Zidi, who wrote for him a new character full of nuances and frankness in &quot;L&#x27;aile ou la cuisse&quot; (1976), which is arguably one of the best of his roles. Later, De Funès&#x27; considerable musical abilities were showcased in films such as &quot;Le Corniaud&quot; and &quot;Le Grand Restaurant&quot;. In 1964, he debuted in the first of the &quot;Fantômas&quot; series, which launched him into superstardom.

In 1975, Oury turned again to De Funès for a film entitled &quot;Le Crocodile&quot;, in which he was to play the role of a South American dictator. But in March 1975, De Funès was hospitalized for heart problems and forced to take a break from acting, causing &quot;Le Crocodile&quot; to be cancelled. After his recovery, he appeared opposite another comic of the time, Coluche, in &quot;L&#x27;Aile ou la cuisse&quot;. In 1980, De Funès realised a long-standing dream of making a film version of Molière&#x27;s play &quot;The Miser&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;Avare&quot;).

De Funès made his final film, &quot;Le Gendarme et les Gendarmettes&quot;, in 1982.

== Style ==

Unlike the characters he played, De Funès was said to be a very shy person in real life. Capable of an extremely rich and rapidly changing range of facial expressions, he was nicknamed &quot;the man with forty faces per minute.&quot; In many of his films, he played the role of a humorously excitable, cranky, middle-aged or mature man with a propensity for hyperactivity, bad faith, and uncontrolled fits of anger. Along with his short height – – and his facial contortions, this hyperactivity produced a highly comic effect. This was particularly visible when he was paired with Bourvil, who was always given roles of calm, slightly naive, good-humoured men. In De Funès&#x27;s successful lead role in a cinematic version of Molière&#x27;s &quot;The Miser&quot;, these characteristics are greatly muted, percolating just beneath the surface.

== Later years and death ==
In the later part of his life, De Funès achieved great prosperity and success. He became a knight of France&#x27;s Légion d&#x27;honneur in 1973. He resided in the Château de Clermont, a 17th-century château located in the commune of Le Cellier, 27 kilometers (17 mi) from Nantes in the west of France. The château, overlooking the river Loire, was inherited by his wife, whose aunt had married a descendant of Maupassant. De Funès was an aficionado of roses and planted a rose garden on the château grounds; a variety of rose was named after him: the Louis de Funès rose. A monument honoring him was erected in the château rose garden.
In his later years, De Funès suffered from a heart condition after having two heart attacks caused by the excessive strain of his stage antics. He died of a third heart attack on 27 January 1983, a few months after making his final film. He was laid to rest in the Cimetière du Cellier, the cemetery situated on the Château de Clermont grounds.

== Legacy ==
De Funès was portrayed on a postage stamp issued on 3 October 1998 by the French postal service. He was also portrayed in French comics, including as a gambler in &quot;Lucky Luke&quot; (&quot;The One-Armed Bandit&quot;) and as a film studio worker in &quot;Clifton&quot; (&quot;Dernière Séance&quot;). In 2013, a museum dedicated to De Funès was created in the Château de Clermont where he had resided. In 2019, another De Funès museum opened in Saint-Raphaël, Var.

The behavior, diminutive size, and body language of the character Skinner from the 2007 Pixar animated film &quot;Ratatouille&quot; are loosely based on Louis de Funès.

<text>The Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard () is the minister of the Crown in the Canadian Cabinet responsible for supervising the fishing industry, administrating all navigable waterways in the country, and overseeing the operations of the Canadian Coast Guard and the Freshwater Fish Marketing Corporation.

The minister is the head of the Government of Canada&#x27;s marine department, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, often referred to by its older (and technical) name: the Department of Fisheries and Oceans.

== History ==
There was a minister of marine and fisheries from Confederation in 1867 onwards. The role was split in two in 1930, with duties related to fisheries going to the new minister of fisheries, and all other responsibilities going to the new minister of marine, which was merged into the role of minister of transport a few years later.

The minister of fisheries lasted from 1930 to 1969, at which point the post was merged with forestry to create the post of minister of fisheries and forestry. This lasted only two years, until 1971, when the minister of fisheries became a secondary role held concurrently by the minister of the environment. In 1974, the fisheries portfolio was assigned to Roméo LeBlanc as the minister of state (fisheries) assisting the minister of the environment. When LeBlanc was appointed as the minister of the environment in 1976, the post was restyled minister of fisheries and environment.

The current post of minister of fisheries and oceans was established in 1979, and it has continued under various names since then. Hunter Tootoo was the first Indigenous person to hold this portfolio, from November 4, 2015 until May 31, 2016.

<doc id="387617" wikidata="Q7209346" url="?curid=387617" title="Poletown East, Detroit">
<text>Poletown East is a neighborhood of Detroit, Michigan, bordering the enclave city of Hamtramck. The area was named after the Polish immigrants who originally lived in the area. A portion of residential area known as Poletown became the General Motors Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly plant in 1981 with those residents relocated by General Motors and the cities of Detroit and Hamtramck which claimed eminent domain in order to make way for a new automobile plant.

==Geography==
The boundaries of Poletown East as defined by the city&#x27;s planning and development department include the city of Hamtramck, St. Aubin Street and I-94 to the north, I-75 to the east, Warren Avenue to the south, and Mt. Elliot Street to the east.

West of St. Aubin and south of I-94, as well as well as the area north of I-94 between St. Aubin and Mt. Elliott, are industrial in nature. The area bound by St. Aubin, I-94, Mt. Elliott and Warren is largely residential.

The boundaries of historical Poletown included the Hamtramck city line, Gratiot Avenue, and a line from Mt. Elliott to the intersection of Canfield and St. Antoine, the location of the Detroit Medical Center.

==History==
Poletown was settled in the 1870s when the first waves of Polish and Kashubian immigrants came to Detroit, and served as the heart of Detroit&#x27;s Polish community for many years. The nucleus of the community was the St. Albertus Roman Catholic Church, which opened in 1871 and closed in 1990. Poletown experienced its greatest period of growth during the 1920s and 1930s as thousands of Polish immigrants came to Detroit in search of jobs in auto plants, like the nearby Packard Plant, and the Chrysler Plant to the east on Jefferson Ave, and the slaughterhouses that were in the area. Poletown was not only home to Poles, but also to Italians and African Americans. During the 1950s and 1960s, freeway construction and urban renewal projects altered the neighborhood.

In 1981, a portion of the neighborhood was demolished to make way for the construction of the General Motors Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly plant. General Motors and the cities of Detroit and Hamtramck relied on eminent domain to relocate the 4,200 people who lived in the area, along with their 1,300 homes, 140 businesses, six churches and one hospital. The plant was built at the boundary of Hamtramck and Detroit as a BOC factory (Buick-Oldsmobile-Cadillac) and became known as the &quot;Poletown Plant&quot;.

Coleman Young, Mayor of Detroit, used eminent domain to seize the portion of Poletown. Critics stated that Young could have chosen other areas for the plant and yet he chose one of the final remaining working class White areas of Detroit. Young had criticized the destruction of the Black Bottom through eminent domain.

Some of the displaced residents sued the cities and General Motors, but the Michigan Supreme Court ruled that economic development was a legitimate use of eminent domain. Another Poletown group, the Citizens District Council, supported the efforts to build the new plant. Gary Campbell, a Poletown resident and bar owner, accused those opposing the new plant of presenting opinions of a small minority as if they represented the entire neighborhood. The controversy led to national news attention and the involvement of Ralph Nader and the Gray Panthers. Protests centered on Immaculate Conception Roman Catholic Church. The regional Catholic Archdiocese supported the relocations and had already agreed to sell the two Catholic churches that were in the area. However, Joseph Karasiewicz, the priest at one of the parishes, defied his archbishop and fought to keep his building from being sold. The Archdiocese stood firm in its support of the sale. A 29-day sit-in at the Immaculate Conception Church came to an end on July 14, 1981, when police forcibly evicted 20 people from the church. Twelve people were arrested, only three of the twelve arrested were from Poletown.

&quot;Poletown Neighborhood Council v. Detroit&quot; became a landmark case for &quot;public use&quot; eminent domain matters. Twenty-three years later, the Michigan Supreme Court reversed the precedent that it had set in the earlier case. In their 2004 decision, &quot;County of Wayne v. Hathcock&quot; a property owner near Detroit&#x27;s Metropolitan Airport successfully fought against the development of a new suburban office/industrial park. The case was argued by Michigan eminent domain attorney Alan T. Ackerman. In a later 2005 United States Supreme Court decision, the case of &quot;Kelo v. City of New London&quot; ruled that the use of eminent domain to promote economic development is constitutional, but the opinion in &quot;Kelo&quot; cites the &quot;Hathcock&quot; decision as an example of how states may choose to impose their own restrictions on the taking of property.

==Other uses==
Poletown is sometimes used inclusively as slang for Hamtramck, Michigan , probably due to Hamtramck&#x27;s strong identification with Polish-Americans. &quot;Poletown&quot; proper is the section immediately south of Hamtramck within the city of Detroit, but at one time had a strong and vibrant Polish neighborhood. Hamtramck itself has become highly diverse and there is still a small Polish-speaking minority. Polish bakeries and restaurants there are particularly popular, especially around Fat Tuesday. Many people around the city celebrate Fat Tuesday by eating Pączki (singular form: pączek), even if they are not Polish.

<doc id="387618" wikidata="Q3251793" url="?curid=387618" title="Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship">
<text>The minister of immigration, refugees and citizenship () is a minister of the Crown in the Canadian Cabinet. The minister is responsible for Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, which is the federal department responsible for immigration, refugee and citizenship issues in Canada.

The current minister is Marc Miller.

Prior to the current position, the portfolios responsible for immigration in Canada throughout history were titled: Immigration and Colonization (1917–36), Mines and Resources (1936–50), Citizenship and Immigration (1950–66), Manpower and Immigration (1966–77), and of Employment and Immigration (1977–96). The office as it exists today was created in 1994 by the &quot;Department of Citizenship and Immigration Act&quot;.

As of 2 July 2013, the Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship portfolio inherited primary responsibility for Passport Canada and the administration of the Canadian Passport Order from the Foreign Affairs and International Trade portfolio. The Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, though independent, also reports to the minister.

==Historical overview==
There have been several offices throughout history responsible for immigration in Canada.

From 1917 to 1936, the office responsible for citizenship and immigration in Canada was the minister of immigration and colonization. The portfolios thereafter fell under the ministers of mines and resources and of reconstruction and supply until 1950, when the office of the minister of citizenship and immigration was established.

In 1966, the Citizenship and Immigration ministry was largely replaced by that of the minister of manpower and immigration, who would keep responsibility over immigration until 1977. From then on, the immigration portfolio would fall under the minister of employment and immigration until 1996.

In January 1991, the office of minister of multiculturalism and citizenship was created, adopting responsibility over citizenship matters. This office lasted until 1994, when the post of minister of citizenship and immigration was resuscitated by the &quot;Department of Citizenship and Immigration Act&quot;, substantially revamping the immigration and citizenship portfolios. In 2008, the office was renamed to the minister of citizenship, immigration and multiculturalism, only to again drop the multiculturalism portfolio in 2013.

As of 2 July 2013, the Citizenship and Immigration portfolio inherited primary responsibility for Passport Canada and the administration of the Canadian Passport Order from the Foreign Affairs and International Trade portfolio.

On 4 November 2015, the name of the department has changed from Citizenship and Immigration Canada to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada.

== List of ministers ==
The office of minister of citizenship and immigration was created in 1950 by &quot;Statute 13 George VI, c. 16&quot;. That office was abolished in 1966, and replaced by the minister of manpower and immigration. The office responsible for immigration in Canada would again be titled minister of citizenship and immigration,&quot; with its creation in 1994 by the &quot;Department of Citizenship and Immigration Act&quot; (Statute 42–43 Elizabeth II, c. 31), succeeding the minister of employment and immigration.

Though having its name changed in 2015 to minister of immigration, refugees and citizenship, the office created in 1994 as the minister of citizenship and immigration&quot; is still the one that is currently in effect and is responsible for Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada.

The following immigration ministers are those who assumed the position under the office that was created in 1994.

== Preceding offices responsible for immigration ==
There have been several offices throughout history responsible for immigration in Canada.

Prior to the current position, the offices responsible for immigration in Canada throughout history include the minister of immigration and colonization (1917–1936), minister of mines and resources (1936–1950), minister of citizenship and immigration (1950–1966), minister of manpower and immigration (1966–1977), minister of employment and immigration (1977–1996).

=== Minister of Immigration and Colonization (1917–36) ===
The minister of immigration and colonization was an office in the Cabinet of Canada from 1917 to 1936, superseded by the minister of mines and resources.

After 1950, the position has been succeeded by minister of citizenship and immigration (1950–1966), minister of manpower and immigration (1966–1977), and minister of employment and immigration (1977–1996).
=== Minister of Mines and Resources (1936–50) ===

The minister of mines and resources was a cabinet portfolio from 1936 to 1950 that had absorbed the responsibilities belonging to the offices of minister of immigration and colonization, as well as of the minister of the interior, minister of mines, and superintendent-general of Indian affairs. The last minister of immigration and colonization, Thomas Alexander Crerar, remained in office under the new title of minister of mines and resources.

=== Citizenship and Immigration (1950–66) ===
The office of minister of citizenship and immigration came in force on 18 January 1950, and would be abolished and replaced by the minister of manpower and immigration as of 1 October 1966.

Following the minister of manpower and immigration (1966–1977) and the minister of employment and immigration (1977–1996), the office responsible for immigration in Canada would again be titled minister of citizenship and immigration, which was created in 1994 and is currently in effect (though changing its name to the minister immigration, refugees and citizenship as of 2015).
=== Minister of Manpower and Immigration (1966–77) ===
Minister of Manpower and Immigration was a former position in the Cabinet of Canada from 1966 to 1977. The position was created after the minister of citizenship and immigration was dissolved in 1966. It was abolished and replaced with the minister of employment and immigration in 1977.
=== Minister of Employment and Immigration (1977–96) ===
The minister of employment and immigration was an office in the Cabinet of Canada, in operation from 1977 to 1996, and was first held by Bud Cullen, who continued from his preceding role as the minister of manpower and immigration.

On 12 July 1996, the office of the minister of employment and immigration was abolished and replaced with the office of minister of human resources development. The portfolio for immigration was transferred to the office of minister of citizenship and immigration following the reorganization of the government and formation of the department for Citizenship and Immigration Canada.

<text>Polish Americans () are Americans who either have total or partial Polish ancestry, or are citizens of the Republic of Poland. There are an estimated 8.81 million self-identified Polish Americans, representing about 2.67% of the U.S. population, according to the 2021 American Community Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. 

The first eight Polish immigrants to British America came to the Jamestown colony in 1608, twelve years before the Pilgrims arrived in Massachusetts. Two Polish volunteers, Casimir Pulaski and Tadeusz Kościuszko, aided the Americans in the Revolutionary War. Casimir Pulaski created and led the Pulaski Legion of cavalry. Tadeusz Kosciuszko designed and oversaw the construction of state-of-the-art fortifications, including those at West Point, New York. Both are remembered as American heroes. Overall, around 2.2 million Poles and Polish subjects immigrated into the United States between 1820 and 1914, chiefly after national insurgencies and famine. They included former Polish citizens of Roman Catholic, Protestant, Jewish or other minority descent. 

Exact immigration figures are unknown owing to several complicating factors. Many immigrants were classified as &quot;Russian&quot;, &quot;German&quot; or &quot;Austrian&quot; by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service as many former territories of Poland were under German, Austrian-Hungarian and Russian occupation between the 1790s and the 1910s. Complicating the U.S. Census figures further is the high proportion of Polish Americans who married people of other national descent. In 1940, about 50 percent married other American ethnics and a study in 1988 found that 54% of Polish Americans were of mixed ancestry from three generations or longer. The Polish American Cultural Center places a figure of Americans who have some Polish ancestry at 19–20 million.

In 2000, 667,414 Americans over five years old reported Polish as the language spoken at home, which is about 1.4% of the census groups who speak a language other than English or 0.25% of the U.S. population.

==History==


The history of Polish immigration to the United States can be divided into three stages, beginning with the first stage in the colonial era down to 1870, small numbers of Poles and Polish subjects came to America as individuals or in small family groups, and they quickly assimilated and did not form separate communities, with the exception of Panna Maria, Texas founded in the 1850s. For instance, Polish settlers came to the Virginia Colony as skilled craftsmen as early as 1608. Some Jews from Poland even assimilated into cities which were Polish (and also other Slavic and sometimes additionally Jewish) bastions to conceal their Jewish identities.

In the second stage from 1870 to 1914, Poles and Polish subjects formed a significant part of the wave of immigration from Germany, Imperial Russia, and Austria Hungary. The Poles, particularly Polish Jews, came in family groups, settled in and/or blended into largely Polish neighborhoods and other Slavic bastions, and aspired to earn wages that were higher than what they could earn back in Europe and so many took the ample job opportunities for unskilled manual labor in industry and mining. The main Ethnically-Polish-American organizations were founded because of high Polish interest in the Catholic church, parochial schools, and local community affairs. Relatively few were politically active.

During the third stage from 1914 to present, the United States has seen mass emigration from Poland, and the coming of age of several generations of fully assimilated Polish Americans. Immigration from Poland has continued into the early 2000s and began to decline after Poland had joined the European Union in 2004. The income levels have gone up from well below average, to above average. Poles became active members of the liberal New Deal Coalition from the 1930s to the 1960s, but since then, many have moved to the suburbs, and have become more conservative and vote less often Democratic.

==Demographics==

Helena Lopata (1976) argues that Poles differed from most other ethnic groups in America in several ways. They did not plan to remain permanently and become &quot;Americanized.&quot; Instead, they came temporarily to earn money, invest, and wait for the right opportunity to return. Their intention was to ensure a desirable social status in the old world for themselves. However, many of the temporary migrants decided to become permanent Americans.

Many found manual labor jobs in the coal mines of Pennsylvania and the heavy industries (steel mills, iron foundries, slaughterhouses, oil and sugar refineries), of the Great Lakes cities of Chicago, Pittsburgh, Detroit, Buffalo, Milwaukee, Cleveland, and Toledo.

The U.S. Census asked Polish immigrants to specify Polish as their native language beginning in Chicago in 1900, allowing the government to enumerate them as an individual nationality when there was no Polish nation-state. No distinction is made in the American census between ethnically Polish Americans and descendants of non-ethnic Poles, such as Jews or Ukrainians, who were born in the territory of Poland and considered themselves Polish nationals. Therefore, some say, of the 10 million Polish Americans, only a certain portion are of Polish ethnic descent. On the other hand, many ethnic Poles when entering the US from 1795 to 1917, when Poland did not exist, did not identify themselves as ethnic Poles and instead identified themselves as either German, Austrian or Russian (this pertained to the nations occupying Poland from 1795 to 1917). Therefore, the actual number of Americans of at least partial Polish ancestry, could be well over 10 million. In the 2011 United States Census Bureau&#x27;s Population Estimates, there are between 9,365,239 and 9,530,571 Americans of Polish descent, with over 500,000 being foreign-born.

Historically, Polish-Americans have assimilated very quickly to American society. Between 1940 and 1960, only 20 percent of the children of Polish-American ethnic leaders spoke Polish regularly, compared to 50 percent for Ukrainians. In the early 1960s, 3,000 of Detroit&#x27;s 300,000 Polish-Americans changed their names each year. Language proficiency in Polish is rare in Polish-Americans, as 91.3% speak &quot;English only.&quot; In 1979, the 8 million respondents of Polish ancestry reported that only 41.5 percent had single ancestry, whereas 57.3% of Greeks, 52% of Italians and Sicilians, and 44% of Ukrainians had done so (clarification needed). Polish-Americans tended to marry exogamously in the postwar era in high numbers, and tended to marry within the Catholic population, often to persons of German (17%), Italian (10%), East European (8%), Irish (5%), French (4%), Spanish-speaking (2%), Lithuanian (2%), and English (1%) ancestry.

===Polish-born population===
Polish-born population in the U.S. since 2010:

==Communities==
The vast majority of Polish immigrants settled in metropolitan areas, attracted by jobs in industry. The minority, by some estimates, only ten percent, settled in rural areas.

Historian John Bukowczyk noted that Polish immigrants in America were highly mobile, and 40 to 60 percent were likely to move from any given urban neighborhood within 10 years. The reasons for this are very individualistic; Bukowczyk&#x27;s theory is that many immigrants with agricultural backgrounds were eager to migrate because they were finally freed from the local plots of land they had owned in Poland. Others ventured into business and entrepreneurship, and the majority of them opened small retail shops such as bakeries, butcher shops, saloons, and print shops.

Polish American Heritage Month is an event in October by Polish American communities, first celebrated in 1981.

===Chicago===

One of the most notable in size of the urban Polish American communities is in Chicago and its surrounding suburbs. Chicago is a city sprawling with Polish culture, billing itself as the largest Polish city outside of Poland, with approximately 185,000 Polish speakers, making Polish the third most spoken language in Chicago. The influence of Chicago&#x27;s Polish community is demonstrated by the numerous Polish-American organizations: the Polish Museum of America, Polish Roman Catholic Union of America (the oldest Polish American fraternal organization in the United States), Polish American Association, Polish American Congress, Polish National Alliance, Polish Falcons, Polish Highlanders Alliance of North America, and the Polish Genealogical Society of America. In addition, Illinois has more than one million people that are of Polish descent, the third largest ethnic group after the German and Irish Americans. The Chicago area has many Polish delis, restaurants, and churches.

Chicago&#x27;s Polish community was concentrated along the city&#x27;s Northwest and Southwest Sides, along Milwaukee and Archer Avenues, respectively. Chicago&#x27;s Taste of Polonia festival is celebrated at the Copernicus Foundation, in Jefferson Park, every Labor Day weekend. Nearly 3 million people of Polish descent live in the area between Chicago and Detroit, including Northern Indiana, a part of the Chicago metropolitan area. The community has played a role as a staunch supporter of the Democratic machine, and has been rewarded with several congressional seats. The leading representative has been Congressman Dan Rostenkowski, one of the most powerful members of Congress (1959 to 1995), especially on issues of taxation, before he went to prison.

===New York metropolitan area===
The New York metropolitan area, including Brooklyn in New York City, and North Jersey, is home to the second-largest community of Polish Americans in the nation, and is now closely behind the Chicago metropolitan area&#x27;s Polish population. Greenpoint, New York in Brooklyn is home to the Little Poland of New York City, while Williamsburg, Maspeth and Ridgewood also contain vibrant Polish communities. In 2014, the New York metropolitan area surpassed Chicago as the metropolitan area attracting the most new legal immigrants to the United States from Poland.

====Linden, Elizabeth, and Newark, New Jersey====
Linden, New Jersey in Union County, near Newark Liberty International Airport, has become heavily first-generation Polish in recent years. 15.6% of the residents five years old and above in the city of Linden primarily speak Polish at home and a variety of Polish-speaking establishments may be found by the Linden station, which is a direct line to Manhattan. St. Theresa&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church offers masses in Polish.

In the early part of the 20th century, up to and immediately following the second World War, Newark, New Jersey and Elizabeth, New Jersey were the primary, historic centers of &#x27;Polonia&#x27; as Polish-Americans of that era thought of themselves. Castle Garden and Ellis Island generation immigrants and those that followed them found employment in the industries of these two cities as well as Linden which housed oil refineries and auto manufacturing. Initial settlements were in Newark, primarily the &quot;Ironbound&quot; section, where St. Stanislaw Roman Catholic Church, followed by Casimir&#x27;s Parish were the first parish churches founded and built by the communities there. In Elizabeth, the first parish serving the Polish community is St. Adalbert&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church. All these parishes are over 100 years old, dating from the late 1800s, with churches constructed in the early 20th century. Post-war prosperity allowed many Polish Americans to disperse from the original core in New Jersey&#x27;s industrial areas to the surrounding suburban communities. Documentation of their early history may be found on individual parish websites. Other significant centers of Polish settlement in New Jersey included Garfield, New Jersey, Manville in Somerset County, Trenton, New Jersey, and Camden, New Jersey.

====Other areas====
In Hudson County, New Jersey, Bayonne houses New Jersey&#x27;s largest Polish American community, while Wallington in Bergen County contains the state&#x27;s highest percentage of Polish Americans and one of the highest percentages in the United States, at over 40%. However, within New Jersey, Polish populations are additionally increasing rapidly in Clifton, Passaic County as well as in Garfield, Bergen County.

Riverhead, New York, located on eastern Long Island, contains a neighborhood known as &quot;Polish Town&quot;, where many Polish immigrants have continued to settle since the World War II era; the town has Polish architecture, stores, and St. Isidore&#x27;s R.C. Church, and Polish Town hosts an annual summer Polish Fair. LOT Polish Airlines provides non-stop flight service between JFK International Airport in the Queens borough of New York City, Newark and Warsaw.

The Kosciuszko Foundation is based in New York.

===Wisconsin and Minnesota===
Milwaukee&#x27;s Polish population has always been overshadowed by the city&#x27;s more numerous German American inhabitants. Nevertheless, the city&#x27;s once numerous Polish community built a number of Polish Cathedrals, among them the magnificent Basilica of St. Josaphat and St. Stanislaus Catholic Church. Many Polish residents and businesses are still located in the Lincoln Village neighborhood. The city is also home to Polish Fest, the largest Polish festival in the United States, where Polish Americans from all over Wisconsin and nearby Chicago, come to celebrate Polish Culture, through music, food and entertainment. Polonia in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul is centered on Holy Cross Church in the Northeast Neighborhood of Minneapolis, where a vibrant Polish ministry continues to care for the Polish Roman Catholic Faithful.

Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Nebraska represent a different type of settlement with significant Polish communities having been established in rural areas. Historian John Radzilowski estimates that up to a third of Poles in Minnesota settled in rural areas, where they established 40 communities, that were often centered around a Catholic church. Most of these settlers came from the Polish lands that had been taken by Prussia during the Partitions, with a sub-group coming from Silesia. The Kaszub minority, from Poland&#x27;s Baltic coast, was also strongly represented among Polish immigrants to Minnesota, most notably in Winona. Despite relative isolation from Poland and larger urban Polonian communities, due to strong community integration these communities continued speaking Polish into the 1970s in some cases and continue to have a strong Polish identity.

===Michigan===

Michigan&#x27;s Polish population of more than 850,000 is the third-largest among U.S. states, behind that of New York and Illinois. Polish Americans make up 8.6% of Michigan&#x27;s total population. The city of Detroit has a very large Polish community, which historically settled in Poletown and Hamtramck on the east side of Detroit, the neighborhoods along Michigan Avenue from 23rd street into east Dearborn, the west side of Delray, parts of Warrendale and several sections of Wyandotte downriver. The northern part of Poletown was cleared of residents, to make way for the General Motors Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly plant. Today it contains some of the most opulent Polish churches in America like St. Stanislaus, Sweetest Heart of Mary, St. Albertus, St. Josephat and St. Hyacinthe. Michigan as a state has Polish populations throughout. In addition to metropolitan Detroit, Grand Rapids, Bay City, Alpena and the surrounding area, the thumb of Michigan, Manistee, and numerous places in northern lower Michigan and south-central Michigan also have sizable Polish populations.

The Polish influence is still felt throughout the entire metropolitan Detroit area, especially the suburb of Wyandotte, which is slowly emerging as the major center of Polish American activities in the state. An increase in new immigration from Poland is helping to bolster the parish community of Our Lady of Mount Carmel and a host of Polish American civic organizations, located within the city of Wyandotte. Also, the Detroit suburb of Troy is home to the American Polish Cultural Center, where the National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame has over 200 artifacts on display from over 100 inductees, including Stan Musial and Mike Krzyzewski. St. Mary&#x27;s Preparatory, a high school in Orchard Lake with historically Polish roots, sponsors a popular annual Polish County Fair that bills itself as &quot;America&#x27;s Largest High School Fair.&quot;

Outside of Metro Detroit, Polish Americans retain a strong presence in Northern Michigan. The town of Cedar in Leelanau County retains a large Polish presence, and is home to a Polish Art Center, as well as an annual polka festival. The counties of Alpena, Presque Isle, and Huron also have a large percentage and population of families of Polish immigrants.

===Ohio===
Ohio is home to more than 440,000 people of Polish descent, their presence felt most strongly in the Greater Cleveland area, where half of Ohio&#x27;s Polish population resides. The city of Cleveland, Ohio has a large Polish community, especially in historic Slavic Village, as part of its Warszawa Section. Poles from this part of Cleveland migrated to the suburbs, such as Garfield Heights, Parma and Seven Hills. Parma has even recently been designated a Polish Village commercial district. Farther out, other members of Cleveland&#x27;s Polish community live in Brecksville, Independence and Broadview Heights. Many of these Poles return to their Polish roots by attending masses at St. Stanislaus Church, on East 65th Street and Baxter Avenue.

Cleveland&#x27;s other Polish section is in Tremont, located on Cleveland&#x27;s west side. The home parishes are St. John Cantius and St. John Kanty.

Other Polish language churches in Cleveland city include St. Casimir, St. Barbara, and Immaculate Heart of Mary. Outside of annual church festivals, other major city celebrations include Dyngus Day and the Slavic Village Harvest Festival, celebrating with Polish food, customer, and Polka music. Cleveland is home to the Polka Hall of Fame.

Poles in Cleveland were instrumental in forming the Third Federal Savings and Loan in 1938. After seeing fellow Poles discriminated against by Cleveland&#x27;s banks, Ben Stefanski formed Third Federal. Today the Stefanski family still controls the bank. Unlike Cleveland&#x27;s KeyBank and National City Corp., which have their headquarters in Downtown Cleveland, Third Federal is on Broadway Avenue in the Slavic Village neighborhood. Third Federal Savings and Loan is in the top 25 saving and loan institutions in the United States. In 2003, they acquired a Florida banking company and have branches in Florida and Ohio.

=== Texas ===
Panna Maria, Texas, was founded by Upper Silesian settlers on Christmas Eve in 1854. Some people still speak Texas Silesian. Silesian is regarded as either a dialect of Polish, or a distinct language. Cestohowa, Kosciusko, Falls City, Polonia, New Waverly, Brenham, Marlin, Bremond, Anderson, Bryan, and Chappell Hill were either founded or populated by the Poles.

===Others===

Other industrial cities with major Polish communities include Buffalo, New York; Boston; Baltimore; New Britain, Connecticut; Dallas, Houston, Portland, Oregon; Minneapolis; Philadelphia; Columbus, Ohio; Erie, Pennsylvania; Rochester, New York; Syracuse, New York; Los Angeles; San Francisco; Seattle; Pittsburgh; South Bend, Indiana; central/western Massachusetts; and Duluth, Minnesota. There is a relatively large Polish population in Kansas City and Saint Louis, Missouri in addition to the area&#x27;s many German-Americans.

Luzerne County, in northeastern Pennsylvania, is the only county in the United States where a plurality of residents state their ancestry as Polish. (See: Maps of American ancestries) This includes the cities of Wilkes-Barre, Pittston, Hazleton, and Nanticoke. Many of the immigrants were drawn to this area, because of the mining of Anthracite coal in the region. Polish influences are still common today, in the form of church bazaars, polka music, and Polish cuisine. It is widely believed that Boothwyn, Pennsylvania, has one of the fastest growing Polish communities in the United States.

In 2007, at the urging of Attorney Adrian Baron and the local Polonia Business Association, New Britain, Connecticut officially designated its Broad Street neighborhood as &quot;Little Poland&quot;, where an estimated 30,000 residents claim Polish heritage. Visitors can do an entire day&#x27;s business completely in Polish including banking, shopping, dining, legal consultations, and even dance lessons. The area has retained its Polish character since 1890. There is also a Polish community in Las Vegas.

===By state totals===

As of the 2021 American Community Survey, the distribution of Polish Americans across the 50 states and DC is as presented in the following table: 
==Religion==
Christianity and Judaism are the most common religions among Polish Americans. However, a small group of Lipka Tatars, originating from the Białystok region, founded the Powers Street Mosque in Brooklyn in 1907.

=== Christianity ===
The Central Archives of American Polonia is a research center at the Orchard Lake Schools. The archives compiles data about the history of Christianity among Polish Americans. Its General List of Polish Parishes counts 1.036 Roman Catholic parishes of a Polish character that were established over the history of the United States. A portion of these parishes are no longer active. The first parish, Immaculate Conception, was established in Panna Maria, Texas in 1854. The dioceses with the largest concentration are the Archdiocese of Chicago at 64, the Diocese of Buffalo at 50, the Diocese of Scranton at 49, and the Archdiocese of Detroit at 40. The Polish Roman Catholic Union of America was instrumental in establishing many churches in the dioceses of Chicago, Detroit, and Buffalo. The monumental scale of some of these urban churches led to the creation of a new genre of architecture known as Polish cathedral style. Parishes were established in rural areas such as farming communities and mining towns as well. The General List of Polish Parishes indicates that 177 churches were established in Pennsylvania, 122 in New York, 118 in Michigan, 112 in Wisconsin, and 99 in Illinois.

The General List of Polish Parishes shows that the most common names for the parishes established were Polish saints such as St. Stanislaus, St. Casimir, St. Stanislaus Kostka, and St. Adalbert. Also common were Sacred Heart and St. Joseph. However, the most popular was St. Mary including as Our Lady of Czestochowa. Devotion to this form of St. Mary was confirmed by the opening of The National Shrine of Our Lady of Czestochowa in 1955. This shrine in Pennsylvania proved so popular that a larger facility was built in 1966. Several statesmen and bishops have visited including Pope John Paul II.

In Michigan the Orchard Lake Schools were established in 1885. One of the schools was the SS. Cyril &amp; Methodius Seminary which trained foreign-born priests for ministry to Polish-speaking Catholics in the United States. The seminary operated from 1885 to 2022. Polish language services are offered by the Archdiocese of Chicago through its Polonia ministry. As of 2025 there are 37 churches in the diocese which offer masses in the Polish language and 38 schools which offer religious education in Polish.

Customs around the liturgical year remain common among Polish Americans. Wigilia is practiced at Christmas Eve while swieconka is performed at churches on Holy Saturday.

Though the majority of Polish Americans remained loyal to the Catholic Church, a breakaway church called the Polish National Catholic Church was founded in 1897. At that time Polish parishioners in Scranton believed that church leadership, then dominated by Irish bishops and priests, was lacking in Polish representation. At the beginning of 2025 the church consisted of 108 parishes of which 27 are in Pennsylvania and 13 are in New York.

=== Judaism ===
World Agudath Israel was formed in Poland in 1912 by Jews who disagreed with the secular orientation of Zionism. Agudath Israel of America, also known as Agudas Yisroel or Agudah, was established in 1922. This organization advocates for Orthodox Jews at all levels of government in the United States. It also provides social, educational, and youth services.

==Social status==
In 1969, the median family income was $8,849 for Polish Americans. The median family income for all families in the United States in 1968 was $7,900. Leonard F. Chrobot summarizes the Census data for 1969:

In 2017, by educational attainment, the U.S. Census estimates that 42.5% have bachelor&#x27;s degrees or higher, whereas the American population as a whole is 32.0%. However, among other Slavic-American groups, most notably Russian (60.4%) and Ukrainian (52.2%), Americans of Polish descent fall short in educational attainment. The median household income for Americans of Polish descent is estimated by the U.S. Census as $73,452, with no statistically significant differences from other Slavic-American groups, Czech, Slovak, and Ukrainian. The median household income for those of Russian ancestry has been reported as higher on the U.S. Census, at $80,554.


==Government==

When drafting the Constitution of the United States, Thomas Jefferson was inspired by the religious tolerance of the Warsaw Confederation.

The Congressional Poland Caucus is a congressional membership organization. The caucus advocates for stronger U.S.-Poland relations around shared values and economic ties.

Polish-Americans founded the Polish American Congress (PAC) in 1944 to support a free and sovereign Poland at the end of World War II. In 1948 it successfully lobbied the U.S. government to admit 140,000 Polish displaced persons, war victims, and veterans to the United States. During the communist era the congress organized humanitarian efforts to Poland. PAC encouraged the passage of the Support East European Democracy Act of 1989 which committed $800 million to Poland. The congress urged the admission of Poland into NATO which happened in 1999. The federation comprises six national membership organizations as of 2025: Polish Daily News, American Council for Polish Culture, Polish Army Veterans Association of America, Polish Falcons of America, Polish National Alliance, and Polish Roman Catholic Union of America.

== Military ==
Two Polish volunteers, Casimir Pulaski and Tadeusz Kościuszko, served in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. Casimir Pulaski created and led the Pulaski&#x27;s Legion of cavalry. He was mortally wounded at the Siege of Savannah. Fort Pulaski is named in his honor. Tadeusz Kosciuszko designed and oversaw the construction of state-of-the-art fortifications, including those at West Point. The National Monument Audit is an inventory of public monuments in the United States. It counts 51 monuments of Pulaski and 22 of Kosciuszko.

During the American Civil War the 58th New York Infantry Regiment was known as the Polish Legion.

Polish Americans who served in the United States Armed Forces during World War I created three different veterans associations after the war. These associations merged in 1931 to form the Polish Legion of American Veterans. Polish Americans who served in the Blue Army during World War I created the Polish Army Veterans Association of America in 1921.

After the end of the Cold War, the National Guard created the State Partnership Program. The Illinois National Guard has been partnered with the Polish Armed Forces since 1993.

In 2023 the United States Army established its 8th garrison in Europe and first in Poland. U.S. Army Garrison Poland is headquartered at Camp Kosciuszko.

==Culture==
The cultural contributions of Polish Americans span a broad spectrum, including in media, in the publishing industry, in religion, art, food, museums, and festivals.

===Media===
Among the most notable Polish American media groups are Hippocrene Books (founded by Polish American George Blagowidow); TVP Polonia; Polsat 2 International; TVN International; Polvision; TV4U New York; WEUR Radio Chicago; Polish Radio External Service (formerly Radio Polonia); Polonia Today and the Warsaw Voice. There are also Polish American newspapers and magazines, such as the &quot;Dziennik Związkowy&quot;, &quot;PL&quot; magazine, &quot;Polish Weekly Chicago&quot;, the &quot;Super Express USA&quot; and &quot;Nowy Dziennik&quot; in New York and &quot;Tygodnik Polski&quot; and &quot;The Polish Times&quot; in Detroit, not to mention the Ohio University Press Series in Polish American Studies, Przeglad Polski Online, &quot;Polish American Journal&quot;, the Polish News Online,&quot;Am-Pol Eagle Newspaper&quot;, and Progress for Poland, among others.

Among the many Polish American writers are a number of poets, such as Hedwig Gorski, John Guzlowski, Cecilia Woloch, and Mark Pawlak (poet and editor), along with novelists Leslie Pietrzyk, Suzanne Strempek Shea and others.

===Cuisine===
Kiełbasa is commonly marketed in the United States as Polish sausage. It comes in fresh and smoked varieties. In Chicago the sausage is the meat in the sandwich known as Maxwell Street Polish. Likewise, in Cleveland there is the Polish Boy.

Polish Jews brought the bagel to the United States. Christians eat pączki doughnuts before Lent. Other baked goods include babka, rugelach, bialy, and placek.

Pierogi are stuffed dumplings that are shared with other Eastern European cuisines. Kluski are another type of dumplings.

Gołąbki and bigos are more limited to Polish American communities.

=== Sports ===
The U.S. Open Cup is the national championship for soccer. It was started in 1914. Two Polish American teams have won the championship: Chicago Falcons in 1953 and A.A.C. Eagles in 1990.

The National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame was founded in 1973 to recognize competitors in the field of sports. The majority of the inductees have been in baseball and American football.

===Museums===
Among the best known Polish American museums are the Polish Museum of America in Chicago&#x27;s old Polish Downtown; founded in 1935, the largest ethnic museum in the U.S. sponsored by the Polish Roman Catholic Union of America. The Museum Library ranks as one of the best outside of Poland. Equally ambitious is the Polish American Museum located in Port Washington, New York, founded in 1977. It features displays of folk art, costumes, historical artifacts and paintings, as well as bilingual research library with particular focus on achievements of the people of Polish heritage in America. There is also the Polish Cultural Institute and Museum of Winona, Minnesota, known informally as &quot;The Polish Museum of Winona.&quot; Formally established in 1979 by Father Paul Breza, the Polish Museum of Winona features exhibits pertaining to Winona&#x27;s Kashubian Polish culture and hosts a wide range of events celebrating America&#x27;s Polish-American heritage in general.

===Festivals===
There are a number of unique festivals, street parties and parades held by the Polish American community. Polish Fest in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, which is a popular annual festival, takes place at Henry Maier Festival Park. It is also the largest Polish festival in the United States. It attracts Polish Americans from all over Wisconsin and nearby Chicago, who come to celebrate Polish culture through music, food and entertainment. New York City is home to the New York Polish Film Festival, an annual film festival showcasing current and past films of Polish cinema. NYPFF is the only annual presentation of Polish films in New York City and the largest festival promoting and presenting Polish films on the East Coast.

The Polish Festival in Syracuse&#x27;s Clinton Square has become the largest cultural event in the history of the Polish community in Central New York. There&#x27;s also the Taste of Polonia festival held in Chicago every Labor Day weekend since 1979 at the Copernicus Cultural and Civic Center in the Jefferson Park area. The Polish Festival in Portland, Oregon is reported to be the largest in the Western United States. One of the newest and most ambitious festivals is the Seattle Polish Film Festival organized in conjunction with the Polish Film Festival in Gdynia, Poland. Kansas City, Kansas is home to a large Polish population and for the last 31 years, All Saints Parish has hosted Polski Day . And last, but not least, there&#x27;s the Pierogi Fest in Whiting, Indiana with many more attractions other than Polish pierogi, and the Wisconsin Dells Polish Fest.

== Contributions to American culture ==
Polish-Americans have influenced American culture in various ways. 

Distinctive cultural phenomena such as Polish flats or the Polish Cathedral style of architecture became part and parcel of the areas where Polish settlement occurred.

===Architectural influence===
Early Polish immigrants built houses with high-pitched roofs in the United States. The high-pitched roof is necessary in a country subject to snow, and is a common feature in Northern, Central and Eastern European architecture. In Panna Maria, Texas, Poles built brick houses with thick walls and high-pitched roofs. Meteorological and soil data show that region in Texas is subject to less than 1 inch of snow and a meteorological study conducted 1960-1990 found the lowest one-day temperature ever recorded was 5 degrees Fahrenheit on January 21, 1986, highly unlikely to support much snow. The shaded veranda that was created by these roofs was a popular living space for the Polish Texans, who spent much of their time there to escape the hot temperatures of subtropical Texas. The Poles in Texas added porches to these verandas, often in the southward windy side, which is an alteration to traditional folk architecture. According to oral histories recorded from descendants, the verandas were used for &quot;almost all daily activities from preparing meals to dressing animal hides.&quot; The Poles in Texas put straw thatching on their roofs until the early 1900s, another European influence. The first house built by a Pole in Panna Maria is the John Gawlik House, constructed in 1858. The building still stands and is visited as a historical attraction in the cultural history of Texas. In 2011, the San Antonio Conservation Society financed a replacement of the building&#x27;s roof, identifying it as a &quot;historically and architecturally significant building.&quot;

<text>The minister of Canadian heritage () is the minister of the Crown who heads Canadian Heritage, the department of the Government of Canada responsible for culture, media, sports, and the arts.

==History==
The position was created in 1996 to combine the posts of minister of multiculturalism and citizenship and minister of communications. The &quot;status of women&quot; was merged from the minister responsible for the status of women in 2006. In 2008, the status of women portfolio was transferred to a minister of state.

On August 16, 2013, the multiculturalism portfolio was assigned to Jason Kenney, who was appointed minister for multiculturalism in addition to his other portfolios.

Those portfolios and responsibilities such as for the Canadian Race Relations Foundation, were returned to the heritage minister with the swearing in of the 29th Canadian Ministry in November 2015. The heritage minister also gained responsibility for the National Capital Commission, which was formerly under the senior Ottawa-area cabinet minister under the Harper government; and the Canadian secretary to the Queen, which was previously under the Privy Council Office.

Traditionally, the minister attends the Juno Awards to present the awards for Breakthrough Artist and Breakthrough Group Of The Year.

<doc id="387629" wikidata="Q200776" url="?curid=387629" title="Tassos Papadopoulos">
<text>Efstathios &quot;Tassos&quot; Nikolaou Papadopoulos (; 7 January 1934 – 12 December 2008) was a Cypriot politician and barrister, who served as President of Cyprus from 2003 to 2008.

An experienced member of the Makarios III’s cabinet, Papadopoulos took charge of the country’s parliament in 1976, two years after the Turkish invasion, and became one the island’s most notable proponents of a hardline position on Cypriot reunification. It was this sentiment that he successfully employed as a candidate in the 2003 presidential election, after which he directed the population to reject the Annan Plan. However, his inability to negotiate an alternative contributed to his failure to win re-election in 2008, despite generally maintaining high approval ratings during his presidency.

==Early life==
His parents were Nicolas and Aggeliki from Assia. He was the first of three children. Papadopoulos attended the Ayios Kassianos and Elenio primary schools in Nicosia and then the Pancyprian Gymnasium. His father&#x27;s circle which included lawyers and judges, were influential on his future career and he went on to study law at King&#x27;s College London before becoming a barrister-at-law through Gray&#x27;s Inn.

His life in London would prove to be pivotal in his future political life. In the second year of his studies he lived with future politician Spyros Kyprianou and Lellos Demetriades (lawyer and future mayor of Nicosia) both of whom had started their political life by founding &quot;EFEKA&quot; (short for National Student Union of Cypriots in England).

==Political career==

===Militant===
Papadopoulos returned to Cyprus on 20 March 1955, ten days before the start of EOKA&#x27;s armed struggle against British colonialism. At first he joined EOKA and became regional chief of operations in Nicosia, whilst Polycarpos Yiorkadjis was held captive. Soon however, he became active in PEKA, the political arm of the EOKA guerrilla organisation. In 1958, aged 24, he became PEKA&#x27;s general secretary.

He took part in the London Conference in 1959 and was one of the two delegates (besides the AKEL delegates) who voted against the signing of the London and Zurich Agreements. He was also one of the four representatives of the Greek Cypriot side at the Constitutional Commission which drafted the Constitution of the Republic of Cyprus.

===Ministerial appointments===
Following independence, aged 25 and to his own surprise he was appointed first as provisional Minister of Internal Affairs and soon afterwards as Minister of Labour. He was the youngest member of the new cabinet and remains the youngest minister to date to serve in a Cypriot government. For the following 12 years he served successively as Minister of the Interior, Minister of Finance, Minister of Labour and Social Insurance, Minister of Health and Minister of Agriculture and Natural Resources.

===United Party===
In 1969 he co-founded the Eniaion Komma (United Party) a party aligned to and supportive of Makarios. Glafcos Clerides became president whilst Papadopoulos remained vice-president of the party. At the Parliamentary elections held on 15 July 1970 he was elected member of the House of Representatives, standing as an Eniaion Party candidate for the Nicosia constituency. However, following a difference of opinion with the leader he later resigned from the party.

===Imprisonment during the 1974 coup===
In 1974, Papadopoulos was imprisoned by the military forces responsible for the coup d&#x27;état. Belonging to Makarios&#x27; cabinet made him a prime target and he was rounded up in Famagusta where he was imprisoned. He was released on the evening before the first Turkish invasion of Cyprus.

===Other roles===

He served as advisor to the first representative of the Greek Cypriot side in the intercommunal talks, Glafcos Clerides, until April 1976 and subsequently he took up that post himself, serving until July 1978. He represented Cyprus at many international conferences, particularly the annual congresses of the International Labour Organization (ILO). Furthermore he represented the Greek Cypriot community in many recourses by Cyprus filed at the United Nations and the Council of Europe.

Until his election he practised law in Nicosia.

Standing as an independent candidate, he was re-elected in the election of 5 September 1976. From 22 July to 20 September 1976, he served as President of the House of Representatives. In the 19 May 1991 parliamentary elections he was elected member of the House of Representatives, standing as a candidate for the Democratic Party in the Nicosia constituency. He was re-elected on 26 May 1996.

===Democratic Party leadership===

On 7 October 2000, he was elected unopposed as the President of the Democratic Party during the historic electoral congress at which the founder of the Party, Spyros Kyprianou, stood down. At the 27 May 2001 elections he was re-elected at the head of the Democratic Party ticket.

He was a member of the National Council, Chairman of the Standing Parliamentary Committee on European Affairs and member of the Committee on Selection and the Committee on Financial and Budgetary Affairs. He was also Co-chairman of the Joint Cyprus-EU Parliamentary Committee.

===President of Cyprus===

He campaigned for the 2003 presidential election on a platform that he would be able to secure a better deal over the Cyprus dispute than the incumbent Glafcos Clerides. He was backed not by just his own party, Diko, but also the party of the Left AKEL and social democratic Kisos and even by many nationalist members of the Democratic Rally of which 61% of party members opposed the plan.

Papadopoulos assumed the Presidency on 28 February 2003 after winning a first round majority with 51.51% of the vote.
Before the 2004 Annan Plan Referendum he urged Greek Cypriots to vote &quot;No&quot;, declaring &quot;I received a state. I will not deliver a community&quot;.

Papadopoulos was a candidate for a second term in office in the 2008 presidential election. In the first round, held on 18 February, he placed third, slightly behind Dimitris Christofias and Ioannis Kasoulides with about 31.8% of the vote, and was therefore eliminated from the second round. He had enjoyed a slight advantage in opinion polls prior to the election and his elimination was regarded as a surprise. He promptly conceded defeat on the day of the election.

==Personal life==
Papadapoulos was an ethnic Greek Cypriot.

He was married to Fotini Georkadji, daughter of Anastasios G. Leventis and widow of assassinated politician Polykarpos Georkadjis, from 1972 until his death in 2008. Papadopoulos had been best man at his wife&#x27;s first wedding.

They had two children, Nikolas and Anastasia, and Papadopoulos raised Fotini&#x27;s older children Constantinos and Maria from her marriage to Polykarpos Georkadjis.

Tassos Papadopoulos died on 12 December 2008 at 13:05 pm of small cell lung carcinoma. He was a heavy smoker. Papadopoulos had been admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of the Nicosia General Hospital on 22 November for the disease. The funeral took place on 15 December 2008 in Agia Sophia Church in Nicosia.

On 11 December 2009, it was reported that thieves had dug up the grave and stolen the body of the former president. Republic of Cyprus President Dimitris Christofias described it as &quot;sacrilege&quot;. On 8 March 2010, the body was discovered in a cemetery near the capital. The family expressed their relief and denied any ransom had been paid.

Cypriot police said DNA results obtained early on 9 March 2010 positively identified the corpse as Papadopoulos&#x27;s, after a telephone tip-off led police to the body the previous night.

<doc id="387644" wikidata="Q2186681" url="?curid=387644" title="Pączki">
<text> (; : , ; ; Old Polish and ) are filled doughnuts found in Polish cuisine.

==Description==
A &quot;pączek&quot; is a deep-fried piece of dough shaped into a flattened ball and filled with confiture or other sweet filling. &quot;Pączki&quot; are usually covered with powdered sugar, icing, glaze, or bits of dried orange zest. A small amount of grain alcohol (traditionally rectified spirit) is added to the dough before cooking; as it evaporates, it prevents the absorption of oil deep into the dough. &quot;Pączki&quot; are commonly thought of as fluffy but somewhat collapsed, with a bright stripe around them; these features are seen as evidence that the dough was fried in fresh oil.

Although they look like German berliners (bismarcks in North America) or jelly doughnuts, &quot;pączki&quot; are made from especially rich dough containing eggs, fats, sugar, yeast, and sometimes milk. They feature a variety of fruit and creme fillings and can be glazed, or covered with granulated or powdered sugar. &quot;Powidła&quot; (stewed plum jam) and wild rose petal jam are traditional fillings, but many others are used as well, including strawberry, Bavarian cream, blueberry, custard, raspberry, and apple.

 have been known in Poland at least since the Middle Ages. Jędrzej Kitowicz wrote that during the reign of Augustus III, under the influence of French cooks who came to Poland, &quot;pączki&quot; dough was improved so that &quot;pączki&quot; became lighter, spongier, and more resilient.

==Etymology, spelling, and pronunciation==
The Polish word (plural: ) is a diminutive of the Polish word &quot;bud&quot;. The latter derives from Proto-Slavic , which may have referred to anything that is round, bulging and about to burst (compare Proto-Slavic &quot;to swell, burst&quot;), possibly of ultimately onomatopoeic origin. From Polish the word has been borrowed into several other Slavic languages, where the respective loanwords (, or ) refer to a similar ball-shaped pastry.

English speakers typically use the plural form of the Polish word in both singular and plural. They pronounce it as and often write it as &quot;paczki&quot;, i.e., without the ogonek (hook-shaped diacritic). This should not be confused with the unrelated Polish word , which is the plural form of , meaning &quot;package&quot; or &quot;parcel&quot;.

==Pączki Day==

In Poland, are eaten especially on Fat Thursday (), the last Thursday prior to Ash Wednesday and the beginning of Lent. The traditional reason for making &quot;pączki&quot; was to use up all the lard, sugar, eggs and fruit in the house, because their consumption was forbidden by Christian fasting practices during the season of Lent.

In North America, particularly the large Polish communities of Chicago, Detroit, Milwaukee, and other large cities across the Midwest and Northeast, Paczki Day is celebrated annually by immigrants and locals alike. The date of this observance merges with that of pre-Lenten traditions of other immigrants (&quot;e.g.&quot;, Pancake Day, &quot;Mardi Gras&quot;) on Fat Tuesday. With its sizable Polish population, Chicago celebrates the festival on both Fat Thursday and Fat Tuesday. &quot;Pączki&quot; are also often eaten on Casimir Pulaski Day. In Buffalo, Toledo, Cleveland, Detroit, Grand Rapids, St. Louis, South Bend, Louisville, and Windsor, Pączki Day is celebrated on Fat Tuesday.

The Pączki Day celebrations in some areas are even larger than many celebrations for St. Patrick&#x27;s Day. In Hamtramck, Michigan, an enclave of Detroit, there is an annual Pączki Day (Shrove Tuesday) Parade, which has gained a devoted following. Throughout the Metro Detroit area, it is so widespread that many bakeries attract lines of customers for &quot;pączki&quot; on Pączki Day. In suburban Cleveland, Eastern European bakery Rudy&#x27;s Strudel hosts a large indoor and outdoor Paczki Day party in conjunction with neighboring record store, The Current Year. It is called &quot;the Mardi Gras of the Midwest&quot;.

In some areas, Pączki Day is celebrated with &quot;pączki&quot;-eating contests.

==United States==

These pastries have become popular in the United States as a result of Polish immigrants and marketing by the bakery industry. Sold in bakeries mainly on both Fat Tuesday and Fat Thursday throughout Detroit and Chicago, they are particularly popular in areas where there is a large concentration of Polish immigrants: Milwaukee, Northcentral and Southeastern Wisconsin, Chicago, Northern Illinois, Northwest Indiana, Metro Detroit, Greater Grand Rapids, Mid Michigan, Greater Buffalo, New York, Greater Rochester, New York, Toledo, Greater Cincinnati, Greater Cleveland, Youngstown, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, Northern and Central New Jersey, Central Connecticut, and Western Massachusetts.

<doc id="387650" wikidata="Q1195049" url="?curid=387650" title="Minister of Crown–Indigenous Relations">
<text>The minister of Crown–Indigenous relations () is a minister of the Crown in the Canadian Cabinet, one of two ministers (the other being the minister of northern affairs) who administer Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada (CIRNAC), the department of the Government of Canada which is responsible for administering the &quot;Indian Act&quot; and other legislation dealing with &quot;Indians and lands reserved for the Indians&quot; under subsection 91(24) of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;. The minister is also more broadly responsible for overall relations between the federal government and First Nations, Métis, and Inuit.

Gary Anandasangaree has been the present minister of Crown–Indigenous relations since July 26, 2023.

The current version of the position was created alongside the minister of Indigenous services, who administers Indigenous Services Canada, the department responsible for health care, water, and other services to Indigenous communities when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on August 28, 2017, that the federal government intended to abolish the Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada department.

==Legal title==
The applied title of the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (DIAND), under the Federal Identity Program, is Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC). INAC is responsible for policies relating to Aboriginal peoples in Canada, that comprise the First Nations, Inuit and Métis. The title has been changed over the last decade from &quot;Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development&quot; to a working title of &quot;Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada&quot; on May 18, 2011, during the cabinet shuffle under then-Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and again to &quot;Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada&quot; during the 29th Canadian Ministry on November 4, 2015. The current working title under CIRNAC was introduced in the 29th Ministry on August 28, 2017, in which Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that the Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada would be gradually abolished.

==Mandate==
According to their website, the mandate of the Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada (CIRNAC) is to &quot;renew the nation-to-nation, Inuit-Crown, government-to-government relationship between Canada and First Nations, Inuit and Métis; modernize Government of Canada structures to enable Indigenous peoples to build capacity and support their vision of self-determination; and lead the Government of Canada&#x27;s work in the North.&quot;

==Nomenclature==
In their July 5, 2018 document, CIRNAC wrote that the concept of Aboriginal nation in Canada, based on the 1996 Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (RCAP), refers to &quot;a sizeable body of Aboriginal people with a shared sense of national identity that constitutes the predominant population in a certain territory or collection of territories. There are three elements in this definition: collective sense of identity; size as a measure of capacity; and territorial predominance. The first element, a collective sense of identity, can be based on a variety of factors. It is usually grounded in a common heritage, which comprises such elements as a common history, language, culture, traditions, political consciousness, laws, governmental structures, spirituality, ancestry, homeland or adherence to a particular treaty.&quot;

According to the 1985 &quot;Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development Act&quot; (R.S.C., 1985, c. I-6) the term &quot;Indian&quot; remained in the department&#x27;s legal name, although the term &quot;Indigenous&quot; is used in its applied title under the Federal Identity Program.

According to a 2004 AADNC Government of Canada document, the term &quot;First Nation&quot;, has been used since the 1970s instead of the word &quot;Indian&quot;, which some people found offensive. The term &quot;Indian&quot; is used for legal and historical documents such as Status Indians as defined by the &quot;Indian Act&quot;. For example, the term &quot;Indian&quot; continues to be used in the historical and legal document, the Canadian Constitution and federal statutes. The term &quot;Aboriginal&quot; is commonly used when referring to the three groups of Indigenous peoples as a whole, First Nations, Inuit and Métis. It is also used by Aboriginal people who live within Canada who claim rights of sovereignty or Aboriginal title to lands.

==Background==
In 1983, the Penner Report by the Special Parliamentary Committee on Indian Self-Government, chaired by Liberal MP Keith Penner, had recommended the phasing out of the &quot;Indian Act&quot; and the Department of Indian Affairs and the introduction of Native self-government. Then-Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, had dismissed the report in 1984. Reports and commissions following the Penner Report including the &quot;Report on the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (1996), the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada Calls to Action (2015), the Principles Respecting the Government of Canada’s Relationship with Indigenous Peoples (2017), Recognition of Indigenous Rights and Self-Determination discussions, and the national engagement—[Recognition and Implementation of Indigenous Rights Framework (RIIRF)]—led by the Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations&quot;, confirmed that &quot;changes are needed to ensure that policies effectively respond to the needs and interests of Indigenous communities&quot; and that policies need to be aligned &quot;with evolving laws and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, including the concept of free, prior and informed consent.&quot; On February 14, 2018, during a speech in the House of Commons, Trudeau announced the formation of the Recognition and Implementation of Indigenous Rights Framework which was intended to &quot;enshrine Section 35 of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;— which affirms Indigenous rights — in federal law&quot; and to &quot;fill the gap between federal government policies and multiple court decisions on Indigenous rights.&quot; It was to be undertaken in &quot;full partnership with First Nations, Inuit, and Métis Peoples&quot;.

In their Fourteenth Report released on December 3, 2018, the Standing Senate Committee on Aboriginal Peoples listed improvements, changes and concerns related to the relationship between CIRNAC and agencies such as the Lands Advisory Board also known as First Nations Land Management Resource Centre (FNLMRC), the First Nations Tax Commission (FNTC) and the First Nations Financial Management Board 

==Changing names and responsibilities from 1867 to 2019==
Prior to Canadian Confederation in 1867, the Indian Department for British North America was responsible for relations between the Crown and Indigenous peoples.

A superintendent-general of Indian affairs was in the Cabinet of Canada from 1867 until 1936 when the Minister of Mines and Resources became responsible for native affairs. In 1950, the Indian Affairs branch was transferred to the minister of citizenship and immigration, who had responsibility for &quot;status Indians&quot; until the creation of the position of minister of Indian affairs and northern development in 1966.

Before 1966, the Northern Development portions of the portfolio were the responsibility of the minister of northern affairs and national resources.

A 1983 House of Commons Committee recommended that Indian or First Nations communities be allowed to write their own membership code provided that the code did not violate fundamental human rights. A second report from the 1983 Penner Committee recommended the gradual abolition of the office of minister of Indian affairs and a transfer of responsibility for their own affairs to First Nations communities. Proposed changes died on the House of Commons&#x27; Order Paper at the end of the parliamentary session and have not been re-introduced.

Until amendments to the &quot;Indian Act&quot; in 1985 restored Indian status to many people whose status had been revoked for discriminatory reasons, about half of the persons claiming to be Indians were entitled to be registered as Indians under the &quot;Indian Act&quot; and to receive the benefits reserved for registered Indians under the Act. In 1985, status was restored to 100,000 people including women who married men who were not Status Indians, and their children; people who had, prior to 1961, renounced their Indian status so they could vote in federal elections, and their children; people whose mother and paternal grandmother did not have status before marriage (these people lost status at 21), and their children; and people who had been born out of wedlock of mothers with status and fathers without, and their children.

As of July 2004, the minister of Indian affairs and northern development has been assigned the role of federal interlocutor for Métis and Non-Status Indians concurrently.

By 2017, CIRNAC and the minister of Indigenous services were responsible for federal government relations with First Nations, Inuit and Métis.

<text>In mathematics, the Sierpiński space is a finite topological space with two points, only one of which is closed.
It is the smallest example of a topological space which is neither trivial nor discrete. It is named after Wacław Sierpiński.

The Sierpiński space has important relations to the theory of computation and semantics, because it is the classifying space for open sets in the Scott topology.

==Definition and fundamental properties==

Explicitly, the Sierpiński space is a topological space &quot;S&quot; whose underlying point set is formula_1 and whose open sets are
formula_2
The closed sets are
formula_3
So the singleton set formula_4 is closed and the set formula_5 is open (formula_6 is the empty set).

The closure operator on &quot;S&quot; is determined by
formula_7

A finite topological space is also uniquely determined by its specialization preorder. For the Sierpiński space this preorder is actually a partial order and given by
formula_8

==Topological properties==

The Sierpiński space formula_9 is a special case of both the finite particular point topology (with particular point 1) and the finite excluded point topology (with excluded point 0). Therefore, formula_9 has many properties in common with one or both of these families.

===Separation===

*The points 0 and 1 are topologically distinguishable in &quot;S&quot; since formula_5 is an open set which contains only one of these points. Therefore, &quot;S&quot; is a Kolmogorov (T0) space.
*However, &quot;S&quot; is not T1 since the point 1 is not closed. It follows that &quot;S&quot; is not Hausdorff, or T&quot;n&quot; for any formula_12
*&quot;S&quot; is not regular (or completely regular) since the point 1 and the disjoint closed set formula_4 cannot be separated by neighborhoods. (Also regularity in the presence of T0 would imply Hausdorff.)
*&quot;S&quot; is vacuously normal and completely normal since there are no nonempty separated sets.
*&quot;S&quot; is not perfectly normal since the disjoint closed sets formula_14 and formula_4 cannot be precisely separated by a function. Indeed, formula_4 cannot be the zero set of any continuous function formula_17 since every such function is constant.

===Connectedness===

*The Sierpiński space &quot;S&quot; is both hyperconnected (since every nonempty open set contains 1) and ultraconnected (since every nonempty closed set contains 0).
*It follows that &quot;S&quot; is both connected and path connected. 
*A path from 0 to 1 in &quot;S&quot; is given by the function: formula_18 and formula_19 for formula_20 The function formula_21 is continuous since formula_22 which is open in &quot;I&quot;.
*Like all finite topological spaces, &quot;S&quot; is locally path connected.
*The Sierpiński space is contractible, so the fundamental group of &quot;S&quot; is trivial (as are all the higher homotopy groups).

===Compactness===

*Like all finite topological spaces, the Sierpiński space is both compact and second-countable.
*The compact subset formula_5 of &quot;S&quot; is not closed showing that compact subsets of T0 spaces need not be closed.
*Every open cover of &quot;S&quot; must contain &quot;S&quot; itself since &quot;S&quot; is the only open neighborhood of 0. Therefore, every open cover of &quot;S&quot; has an open subcover consisting of a single set: formula_24
*It follows that &quot;S&quot; is fully normal.

===Convergence===

*Every sequence in &quot;S&quot; converges to the point 0. This is because the only neighborhood of 0 is &quot;S&quot; itself.
*A sequence in &quot;S&quot; converges to 1 if and only if the sequence contains only finitely many terms equal to 0 (i.e. the sequence is eventually just 1&#x27;s).
*The point 1 is a cluster point of a sequence in &quot;S&quot; if and only if the sequence contains infinitely many 1&#x27;s.
*&quot;Examples&quot;:
**1 is not a cluster point of formula_25
**1 is a cluster point (but not a limit) of formula_26
**The sequence formula_27 converges to both 0 and 1.

===Metrizability===

*The Sierpiński space &quot;S&quot; is not metrizable or even pseudometrizable since every pseudometric space is completely regular but the Sierpiński space is not even regular.
* &quot;S&quot; is generated by the hemimetric (or pseudo-quasimetric) formula_28 and formula_29

===Other properties===

*There are only three continuous maps from &quot;S&quot; to itself: the identity map and the constant maps to 0 and 1.
*It follows that the homeomorphism group of &quot;S&quot; is trivial.

==Continuous functions to the Sierpiński space==

Let &quot;X&quot; be an arbitrary set. The set of all functions from &quot;X&quot; to the set formula_1 is typically denoted formula_31 These functions are precisely the characteristic functions of &quot;X&quot;. Each such function is of the form
formula_32
where &quot;U&quot; is a subset of &quot;X&quot;. In other words, the set of functions formula_33 is in bijective correspondence with formula_34 the power set of &quot;X&quot;. Every subset &quot;U&quot; of &quot;X&quot; has its characteristic function formula_35 and every function from &quot;X&quot; to formula_1 is of this form.

Now suppose &quot;X&quot; is a topological space and let formula_1 have the Sierpiński topology. Then a function formula_38 is continuous if and only if formula_39 is open in &quot;X&quot;. But, by definition
formula_40
So formula_35 is continuous if and only if &quot;U&quot; is open in &quot;X&quot;. Let formula_42 denote the set of all continuous maps from &quot;X&quot; to &quot;S&quot; and let formula_43 denote the topology of &quot;X&quot; (that is, the family of all open sets). Then we have a bijection from formula_43 to formula_42 which sends the open set formula_46 to formula_47
formula_48
That is, if we identify formula_33 with formula_50 the subset of continuous maps formula_51 is precisely the topology of formula_52 formula_53

A particularly notable example of this is the Scott topology for partially ordered sets, in which the Sierpiński space becomes the classifying space for open sets when the characteristic function preserves directed joins.

===Categorical description===

The above construction can be described nicely using the language of category theory. There is a contravariant functor formula_54 from the category of topological spaces to the category of sets which assigns each topological space formula_55 its set of open sets formula_43 and each continuous function formula_57 the preimage map
formula_58
The statement then becomes: the functor formula_59 is represented by formula_60 where formula_9 is the Sierpiński space. That is, formula_59 is naturally isomorphic to the Hom functor formula_63 with the natural isomorphism determined by the universal element formula_64 This is generalized by the notion of a presheaf.

===The initial topology===

Any topological space &quot;X&quot; has the initial topology induced by the family formula_42 of continuous functions to Sierpiński space. Indeed, in order to coarsen the topology on &quot;X&quot; one must remove open sets. But removing the open set &quot;U&quot; would render formula_35 discontinuous. So &quot;X&quot; has the coarsest topology for which each function in formula_42 is continuous.

The family of functions formula_42 separates points in &quot;X&quot; if and only if &quot;X&quot; is a T0 space. Two points formula_69 and formula_70 will be separated by the function formula_35 if and only if the open set &quot;U&quot; contains precisely one of the two points. This is exactly what it means for formula_69 and formula_70 to be topologically distinguishable.

Therefore, if &quot;X&quot; is T0, we can embed &quot;X&quot; as a subspace of a product of Sierpiński spaces, where there is one copy of &quot;S&quot; for each open set &quot;U&quot; in &quot;X&quot;. The embedding map
formula_74
is given by
formula_75
Since subspaces and products of T0 spaces are T0, it follows that a topological space is T0 if and only if it is homeomorphic to a subspace of a power of &quot;S&quot;.

==In algebraic geometry==

In algebraic geometry the Sierpiński space arises as the spectrum formula_76 of a discrete valuation ring formula_77 such as formula_78 (the localization of the integers at the prime ideal generated by the prime number formula_79). The generic point of formula_80 coming from the zero ideal, corresponds to the open point 1, while the special point of formula_80 coming from the unique maximal ideal, corresponds to the closed point 0.

<text>The Jubilee Line Extension (JLE) is the extension of the London Underground&#x27;s Jubilee line from to through south and east London. An eastward extension of the line was first proposed in the 1970s. As part of the development of London Docklands, the line was extended to serve Canary Wharf and other areas of south and east London. Construction began in 1993, and it opened in stages from May to December 1999, at a cost of £3.5 billion.

The 11 new stations were designed to be &quot;future-proof&quot;, with wide passageways, large quantities of escalators and lifts, and emergency exits. The stations were the first on the Underground to have platform edge doors, and were built to have step free access throughout. Each of the stations was designed by a different architect, and the overall design of the project was led by Roland Paoletti. The stations have subsequently been praised as exemplary pieces of 20th-century architecture. The project was the single largest addition to the Underground in 25 years.

== Stations ==
The extension of the line diverges just east of , eastward to:

Before the extension, the Jubilee line terminated at . The section between Charing Cross and Green Park, which diverges to the northwest, is now unused for passenger services but is maintained for emergency use. The abandoned platforms are occasionally rented out by TfL as a film set e.g. &quot;Skyfall&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Woman in Black II&quot;.

== Planning ==

===Original 1970s plans===
The Jubilee line between and was intended to be the first phase of the Fleet Line (as the Jubilee line was originally called). In the first version of the Fleet Line Extension plan, the line ran from Charing Cross via and to station, then via tunnel under the River Thames to connect to the East London line north of Surrey Docks (now Surrey Quays) from where it would take over Underground services to and with tunnels continuing from the latter to Lewisham. In anticipation of this, the tunnels of the first phase of the line continued eastward from Charing Cross under Strand almost as far as Aldwych.

This plan was modified shortly before the Jubilee line opened in 1979. Under the new plan (known for planning purposes as the &quot;River Line&quot;), it would run to Fenchurch Street as before and continue via the Isle of Dogs, Royal Docks and Woolwich Arsenal to the &quot;new town&quot; at Thamesmead. A branch from Silvertown to Beckton would have provided a link to a new depot. This route is not dissimilar to the Crossrail route through the Docklands.

===Jubilee Line Extension ===
Plans to extend the line were revived in the late 1980s, prompted by the proposed development of London Docklands and Canary Wharf, which substantially increased the predicted numbers of jobs in the Isle of Dogs and required a transport network with much greater capacity than provided by the Docklands Light Railway (DLR). Initially, Olympia and York, the developers of Canary Wharf, proposed building a dedicated &#x27;Waterloo and Greenwich Railway&#x27; from Waterloo through London Bridge to Canary Wharf and then to Westcombe Park in Greenwich, costing £400 million. However, London Transport resisted this, preferring to wait for the results of studies into new railway construction. One of these, the East London Railway Study, recommended an extension of the Jubilee line from Green Park to Westminster, then following the route of the Waterloo and Greenwich Railway, continuing to Stratford via Canning Town alongside the North London Line. This option was adopted, with an estimated cost of £2.1 billion to which Olympia and York would make a £400 million contribution, the original cost estimate of the Waterloo and Greenwich Railway. In the end it cost £3.5bn, partly because of huge cost overruns during construction. Where initially the developers were to pay for a large part of the extension, their final contribution was less than 5%.

The extension was authorised in 1990. A station was originally planned at Blackwall, but this was replaced by diverting the line between Canary Wharf and Stratford underneath the Thames to serve the Greenwich peninsula at station. Plans for the Millennium Dome did not yet exist, and this diversion was made to provide for a planned housing development on the site of disused gasworks. British Gas plc contributed £25 million to the scheme. The stations at Southwark and Bermondsey were not initially certain.

The project also required the construction of a new depot to serve the extended line, given the increased number of trains could not be accommodated at the existing Neasden Depot - hence a site at Stratford Market was chosen. 59 1996 Stock trains were ordered as part of the extension, following cancellation of the plan to heavily refurbish the original 1983 stock trains.

Main works were authorised by the London Underground Act 1992, with additional works allowed by the London Underground (Jubilee) Act 1993. In May 1992, Olympia and York (the developers of Canary Wharf) went into administration following the early 1990s recession. This caused a delay to the project, as the Treasury did not wish to proceed without private sector investment. In September 1993, the financial restricting of Canary Wharf was completed, and it was agreed that the £400 million contribution would be maintained. In October 1993, Secretary of State for Transport John MacGregor gave the go ahead for the project. Contracts to build the project were awarded soon after, at a cost of around £1.2 billion.

== Construction ==
Construction of the project officially began on 8 December 1993, with a ceremony at Canary Wharf attended by Prime Minister John Major. Construction was expected to take 53 months, with an opening date of May 1998. Tunnelling began in August 1994 at North Greenwich. By August 1996, all tunnelling work had been completed.

Tunnelling had been delayed after a collapse during the Heathrow Express project in October 1994, which used the same New Austrian Tunnelling method. Indeed, construction under Westminster had caused the Elizabeth Tower to tilt slightly. Other delays subsequently affected the project, including wildcat strikes by electricians and changes to the designs of the stations. The extension was supposed to have moving block signalling, designed by Westinghouse, in order to reach 36 trains per hour at peak times. As design of this overran, this was postponed in favour of more traditional signalling. Twelve years later these features were completed, allowing for up to 33 trains per hour. By November 1997, a September 1998 date was planned.

The new Stratford Market Depot was completed in March 1998 - allowing for testing and commissioning of the new 1996 Stock trains, as well as the testing of the new extension itself. By June 1998, opening was planned in Spring 1999. By November 1998, a phased opening throughout 1999 was being considered. By February 1999, the cost of the extension had increased to a total of £3.3 billion.

=== Opening ===
The first phase of the extension from Stratford to North Greenwich was opened by the Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott on 14 May 1999. There was concern that the entire line would not be open in time for the Millennium Dome, which would open on 1 January 2000. The second phase between North Greenwich and Bermondsey opened on 24 September 1999. The extension was linked to the rest of the Jubilee line with the opening of the final phase on 20 November 1999. Westminster – complicated by the interface with the subsurface platforms, which remained in operation during construction – opened on 22 December 1999, shortly before the Millennium Dome deadline. The final construction cost of the extension was £3.5 billion.

In March 2005, a criminal trial regarding corruption and insider information during the construction of the extension collapsed, after 21 months and a cost of £60m.

== Design ==

The design of the extension is radically different from anything else on the London Underground. Stations are characterised by cavernous, stark interiors lined with polished metal panels and moulded concrete walls and columns. has been compared to a cathedral, with it being said that the neighbouring One Canada Square, if laid on its side, could fit in the station with room to spare. has a dramatic vertical void nearly deep.

The size of the stations was a response to safety concerns—overcrowding and a lack of exits had been significant factors in the 1987 King&#x27;s Cross disaster—and an attempt to &quot;future-proof&quot; stations by designing from the start for a high use. Most platforms and halls are full only in a busy rush hour, all provide step-free access, platforms have emergency exits at both ends, ventilation, as well as fireproof lifts. To ensure passenger flow, a large quantity of escalators (at least three per station) were installed, totalling 115 over the entire extension, increasing the total number of escalators over the entire Underground network by almost half.

The extension was also built with a wider tunnel diameter of 4.35 m allowing a passenger walkway used for emergency purposes; unfortunately wider trains are not possible due to the narrower tunnel dimension northwards of Green Park.

A number of leading architects were employed to design the stations, overseen by Roland Paoletti and a small team of in-house JLE Architects. It was decided from the outset that although each station would be designed as an individual entity, they would be linked by a common design philosophy and functional elements. Spaciousness was the most noticeable, along with the shared theme of grey and silver polished metal and concrete interiors. More subtly, many stations were designed to admit as much natural light as possible. At and to a lesser extent at Canada Water and , rotundas and shafts allow daylight to reach, or nearly reach, the platforms.

The platforms saw another innovation: full-height platform edge doors, to improve airflow, prevent people from jumping or falling onto the track, prevent litter depositing upon the track and stop dirt circulating around the network, amongst other features. These are the first doors to be installed on a commercial railway in Great Britain.

=== Reception ===
Upon opening, the Jubilee Line Extension was widely welcomed, with praise for the architecture, accessibility and expansion of the Tube to south-east and east London. Many of the new stations subsequently received individual awards and commendations for their architecture, including Westminster and Canary Wharf being jointly awarded the 2000 Civic Trust Building of the Year. The Royal Fine Art Commission named the extension as a whole their Millennium Building of the Year, with the chair of the judging panel calling it &quot;comparable to the achievement of Haussmann when he constructed the great boulevards of Paris&quot;.

For his work on the project, Roland Paoletti received the RIBA/Arts Council Award for &quot;Client of the Year&quot; 1999 and was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2000 New Year Honours for &quot;services to Architecture&quot;. The &quot;Architectural Review&quot; called him &quot;the Medici of London Transport&quot;.

== Legacy ==
Since the opening of the extension in 1999, areas along the line such as Canary Wharf, the Greenwich Peninsula and Stratford have seen substantial commercial and residential development. Canary Wharf has become London&#x27;s second financial district, rivalling the City of London. Research by KPMG and Savills for Transport for London (TfL) indicated that the extension led to increases in land value along the line of around 50%. During October 2004, TfL published a report showing &quot;substantial benefits&quot; as a result of the extension, including development of the Canary Wharf financial district, reduced travel time for residents along the line and improved modal share. As part of the development of the Crossrail project, TfL estimated that agglomeration benefits as a result of the JLE led to a benefit–cost ratio of around 3, an increase from 1.56 calculated in 1989.

The extension has proved extremely successful in relieving congestion on the DLR and in opening up access to parts of east London with formerly poor transport links. As such it allowed access to all other London Underground stations with only a single change.

The Jubilee line was considered an essential part of the public transport network for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, allowing access to major venues in Stratford and the Royal Docks. , ridership on the line has increased substantially since the extension opened, becoming the 3rd busiest Underground line, with the Jubilee line having four of the 10 busiest stations.

The stations themselves have subsequently been praised as exemplary pieces of 20th century architecture, with Canary Wharf was voted as the &quot;most loved&quot; tube station in London in 2013, and Westminster was selected by Londoners as one of 10 favourite transport design icons in 2015.

<text>Polotsk () or Polatsk () is a town in Vitebsk Region, Belarus. It is situated on the Dvina River and serves as the administrative center of Polotsk District. Polotsk is served by Polotsk Airport and Borovitsy air base. As of 2024, it has a population of 79,579.

==Nomenclature ==

The Old East Slavic name, &quot;Polotesk&quot;, derives from the Polota river, which flows into the neighboring Western Dvina. The Vikings rendered that name as &quot;Palteskja&quot;.

==Geography==

*Lake Babyna

===Climate===
==History==
Polotsk is one of the earliest mentioned cities of the Eastern Slavs. The &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; mentioned Polotsk in the year 862 (as Полотескъ, /poloteskŭ/), together with Murom and Belozersk. However, an archaeological expedition from the Institute of History of the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus suggests that Polotsk existed in the first half of the 9th century.

The first known prince of Polotsk was Rogvolod (ruled 945–978). He had two sons and a daughter named Rogneda. Rogvolod promised Rogneda to the prince of Kiev, Yaropolk, as a wife. But Yaropolk&#x27;s brother, Vladimir, had attacked Polotsk before Yaropolk came. He killed Rogvolod, his wife and sons, and married Rogneda.

Vladimir and Rogneda had five children and the eldest of them, Izyaslav, became Prince of Polotsk (ruled 989–1001). 

Between the 10th and 12th centuries, the Principality of Polotsk emerged as the dominant center of power in what is now Belarusian territory, with a lesser role played by the Principality of Turov to the south. It repeatedly asserted its sovereignty in relation to other centers of Kievan Rus&#x27;, becoming a political capital, the episcopal see and the controller of vassal territories among Balts in the west. Its most powerful ruler was Prince Vseslav of Polotsk, who reigned from 1044 to 1101. A 12th-century inscription commissioned by Vseslav&#x27;s son Boris may still be seen on a huge boulder installed near St. Sophia Cathedral.
During the Mongol invasion, Polotsk avoided being invaded or paying tribute to the Golden Horde. But in 1240, it became a vassal of the Lithuanian princes. The Grand Duke of Lithuania Vytenis annexed the city by military force in 1307, completing the process which the Lithuanian princes had begun in the 1250s. Polotsk received a charter of autonomy guaranteeing that the grand dukes &quot;will not introduce new, nor destroy the old&quot;. It was the earliest to be so incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. By doing so, the Lithuanians managed to firmly grasp the Dvina trade route in their hands, securing an important element for the surrounding economies. Magdeburg law was adopted in 1498. Polotsk functioned as a capital of the Połock Voivodship of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth until 1772. Captured by the Russian army of Ivan the Terrible in 1563, it was returned to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania just 15 years later. It was again captured by Russia on 17 June 1654, but recaptured by Poland–Lithuania on 30 October 1660 during the Russo-Polish War (1654–67).

In 1772, Russia seized Polotsk (then Połock) as part of the First Partition of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. 

Since the Russian Empress Catherine II did not acknowledge the Papal suppression of the Society of Jesus (1773–1814), the Jesuit branches in these lands were not disbanded, and Połock became the European centre of the Order, with a novitiate opening in 1780, and with the arrival of distinguished Jesuits from other parts of Europe who brought with them valuable books and scientific collections. Jesuits continued their pastoral work and upgraded the Jesuit College in Polotsk (opened in 1580 by decree of the Polish king Stefan Batory, with the Jesuit Piotr Skarga (1536–1612) as its first rector) into the Połock Academy (1812–1820), with three faculties (Theology, Languages and Liberal Arts), four libraries, a printing house, a bookshop, a theatre with 3 stages, a science museum, an art gallery and a scientific and literary periodical, and a medical-care centre. The school was also the patron of the college in Petersburg, the mission to Saratov and an expedition to Canton. 

During the French invasion of Russia the district saw two battles, the First Battle of Polotsk (August 1812) and the Second Battle of Polotsk (October 1812).

In 1820, pressure from the Russian Orthodox Church influenced the Russian Emperor Alexander I to exile the Jesuits and to close the Polock Academy, there were 700 students studying there. The Russian authorities also broke up the Academy&#x27;s library of 40,000–60,000 volumes, the richest collection of 16th- to 18th-century books — the books went to St. Petersburg, Kiev and other cities, 4000 volumes (along with books from other closed Jesuit schools) going to the St. Petersburg State University Scientific Library.

Polotsk came under occupation by the German Empire between 25 February 1918 and 21 November 1918 during World War I, by Poland between 22 September 1919 and 14 May 1920 in the Polish–Soviet War. and by Nazi Germany between 16 July 1941 and 4 July 1944 during World War II. In August 1944, there were serious considerations to transfer Polotsk and its surrounding areas (18,000 square kilometers) with ~400,000 people from the Byelorussian SSR to the Russian SFSR, however Joseph Stalin, persuaded by Panteleimon Ponomarenko, eventually rejected to approve the already prepared transferring documents and subsequently Polotsk functioned as the center of Polotsk Region between 20 September 1944 and 8 January 1954. A reorganisation of the area between Vitebsk and Molodechno Regions left Polotsk part of the former.

==Cultural heritage==

The city&#x27;s Saint Sophia Cathedral (1044–1066) was a symbol of the independent-mindedness of Polotsk, rivaling churches of the same name in Novgorod and Kyiv. The name referred to the original &quot;Hagia Sophia&quot; in Constantinople, and thus claims imperial prestige, authority and sovereignty. The cathedral had been ruined by the troops of Peter I of Russia. Hence the present baroque building by Johann Christoph Glaubitz dates from the mid-18th century. Some genuine 12th-century architecture (notably Transfiguration Church) survives in the Convent of Saint Euphrosyne, which also features a neo-Byzantine cathedral, designed and built in 1893—1899 by Vladimir Korshikov.

Cultural achievements of the medieval period include the work of the nun Euphrosyne of Polotsk (1120–1173), who built monasteries, transcribed books, promoted literacy and sponsored art (including local artisan Lazarus Bohsha&#x27;s famous &quot;Cross of Saint Euphrosyne,&quot; a national symbol and treasure lost during World War II), and the prolific, original Church Slavonic sermons and writings of Bishop Cyril of Turaw (1130–1182).

The first Belarusian printer, Francysk Skaryna, was born in Polotsk around 1490. He is famous for being the first to print the Bible in the Old Belarusian language (East Slavic language) in 1517, several decades after the first-ever printed book by Johann Gutenberg and just several years after the first Czech Bible (1506).

In September 2003, as &quot;Days of Belarusian Literacy&quot; were celebrated for the 10th time in Polotsk, city authorities dedicated a monument to honor the unique Cyrillic Belarusian letter Ў, which is not used in any other Slavic language. The original idea for the monument came from the Belarusian calligraphy professor Paval Siemchanka, who has been studying Cyrillic scripts for many years.

==Sports==
The city has produced players for the Belarus national bandy team. In October 2011, the team planned to participate in the Russian Cup in rink bandy, but did not after all.

<doc id="387672" wikidata="Q10545" url="?curid=387672" title="Ground spider">
<text>Ground spiders comprise Gnaphosidae, the seventh largest spider family with over 2,000 described species in over 100 genera distributed worldwide. There are 105 species known to central Europe, and common genera include &quot;Gnaphosa&quot;, &quot;Drassodes&quot;, &quot;Micaria&quot;, &quot;Cesonia&quot;, &quot;Zelotes&quot; and many others. They are closely related to Clubionidae. At present, no ground spiders are known to be seriously venomous to humans.

==Description==
Generally, ground spiders are characterized by having barrel-shaped anterior spinnerets that are one spinneret diameter apart. The main exception to this rule is found in the ant-mimicking genus &quot;Micaria&quot;. Another characteristic is an indentation in the endites (paired mouthparts anterior and lateral to the labium, or lip). All ground spiders lack a prey-capture web and generally run prey down on the surface. They hunt at night and spend the day in a silken retreat. The genitalia are diverse and are a good model for studying the evolution of genitalia because of their peculiar copulatory mechanism. The thick-walled egg sacs are guarded by the mother until the spiderlings hatch.

==Hunting behavior==
Ground spiders hunt by active foraging, chasing down and subduing individual prey items. They are adapted to hunting large and potentially dangerous prey, including other spiders, which they subdue by using their silk. When hunting, ground spiders produce thick, gluey silk from their enlarged spinnerets and attempt to use it to entangle their prey in swathing attacks, often applying their webbing to their prey&#x27;s legs and mouths. By immobilizing potential prey in this manner, ground spiders can subdue proportionally large creatures while reducing risk of injury to themselves from their prey&#x27;s attempts to fight back.

<text>King Mob was an English radical group based in London during the late 1960s and early 1970s.

Influences on the group included the Situationist International and the New York City group Black Mask / UAW/MF. It derived its name from Christopher Hibbert&#x27;s 1958 book on the Gordon Riots of June 1780, in which rioters daubed the slogan &quot;His Majesty King Mob&quot; on the walls of Newgate Prison, after gutting the building.

==Background==

On 21 December 1967 Timothy Clark, Christopher Gray and Donald Nicholson-Smith were excluded from the Situationist International. Charles Radcliffe had resigned from the SI a couple of months before this. These four had constituted the English Section of the SI and subsequently formed King Mob with twin brothers David and Stuart Wise, who had recently arrived in London from Newcastle.

==Activities==
The group published five issues of its journal &quot;King Mob Echo&quot; as well as many posters and leaflets.

One of King Mob&#x27;s first actions took place in April 1968. Members of the group, including one dressed in a gorilla costume and two in a pantomime horse outfit, led a procession of local people to Powis Square where the fences enclosing a private garden space were demolished in protest at a lack of play areas for children in the area. Several arrests followed, but the action resulted in further protests culminating in the local council purchasing the square for public use.

In December 1968, inspired by the New York-based Black Mask&#x27;s &quot;mill-in at Macy&#x27;s&quot;, King Mob entered the Selfridges store in London, with one member, dressed as Father Christmas, attempting to distribute all of the store&#x27;s toys to children. Police subsequently forced the children to return the toys. This action involved Malcolm McLaren who reputedly applied the group&#x27;s situationist ideas in the promotion of the Sex Pistols.

King Mob also allegedly made plans for a series of other actions, including blowing up a waterfall in the Lake District, painting the poet Wordsworth&#x27;s house with the words &quot;Coleridge Lives&quot;, and hanging peacocks in Holland Park, London. However, none of the aforementioned plans were executed.

Graffiti attributed to King Mob was observed in many places, particularly in the Notting Hill area, including, &quot;I don&#x27;t believe in nothing - I feel like they ought to burn down the world - just let it burn down baby.&quot; The most celebrated graffiti attributed to King Mob was the slogan which was painted along a half-mile section of the wall beside the tube (railway) commuter route into London between Ladbroke Grove and Westbourne Park tube stations in west London:

:&quot;Same thing day after day – tube – work – dinner – work – tube – armchair – TV – sleep – tube – work – how much more can you take? – one in ten go mad – one in five cracks up.&quot;

==Legacy==

Pink Floyd&#x27;s Roger Waters claimed that the &quot;Same Thing Day After Day&quot; graffiti inspired the song &quot;Time&quot; which appeared on the group&#x27;s 1973 &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon&quot; album.

In their book, &quot;Sex Pistols: The Inside Story&quot;, Fred and Judy Vermorel assert that King Mob had a significant influence on the punk group:

King Mob was the inspiration for the principal character of the same name in the 1990s comic strip series &quot;The Invisibles&quot; by Grant Morrison.

An anthology of the original &quot;King Mob&quot; journal titled &quot;King Mob Echo: English Section of the Situationist International&quot;
was edited by Tom Vague and published by Dark Star and AK Press in 2000.

David and Stuart Wise continued to publish material under various guises including BM Bis, BM Blob and then the Revolt Against Plenty and Dialectical Butterflies websites.

<doc id="387681" wikidata="Q8024931" url="?curid=387681" title="Wine cooler">
<text>A wine cooler is an alcoholic beverage made from wine and fruit juice, often in combination with a carbonated beverage and sugar.

==History==
Wine coolers were first marketed in California in 1976, with the introduction of California Cooler. During their peak in the mid-late 1980s they made up 20 percent of all wine sold in the United States, before fading in the 1990s due to heavy excise tax rises on wines.

In Germany, wine coolers became popular in 2004, when the German government imposed an extra duty on alcopops (pre-mixed spirits) of 0.80 to 0.90 euro per bottle, effective 1 August 2004. To circumvent higher taxation, some German producers have switched to wine coolers, which are being marketed in the same way as alcopops.

==Homemade==

Wine (15-17% ABV) contains 2.4-2.7 times more water than 40% distilled spirit. Since wine contains approximately 85% water, it can be mixed with concentrates like a drink mixer, fruit syrup, or squash concentrate. Typically includes 3–7% fruit juice is added to the wine to dilute the ABV, and this solution can be carbonated with a soda machine to make alcopop, after which soft drink syrup is added, which lowers the ABV further.

==Commercially-made==
Traditionally home-made, wine coolers have been bottled and sold by commercial distributors since the early 1980s, especially in areas where their alcohol content, lower than wine, causes them to come under less restrictive laws than table wines.

Because most of the flavor in the wine is obscured by the fruit and sugar, the wine used in wine coolers tends to be of the cheapest available grade. Since January 1991, when the United States Congress quintupled the excise tax on wine, most producers of wine coolers dropped wine from the mix, substituting it with cheaper malt liquor. These malt-based coolers, while sometimes referred to as &quot;wine coolers&quot;, are in a different category of beverage—sometimes called &quot;malt beverage&quot;, &quot;malternative&quot;, or just &quot;cooler&quot;. Bartles &amp; Jaymes refers to its malt beverage as a &quot;flavored malt cooler&quot;.

<text>The Oval, currently named for sponsorship reasons as the [[Kia]] Oval, is an international cricket ground in Kennington, located in the borough of Lambeth, in south London. The Oval has been the home ground of Surrey County Cricket Club since it was opened in 1845. It was the first ground in England to host international Test cricket in September 1880. The final Test match of the English season is traditionally played there.

In addition to cricket, The Oval has hosted a number of other historically significant sporting events. In 1870, it staged the first representative football match between England and Scotland, although this is not deemed to be an official international by FIFA. It hosted the first FA Cup final in 1872, as well as those between 1874 and 1892. In 1876, it held both the England v. Wales and England v. Scotland rugby international matches and, in 1877, rugby&#x27;s first varsity match. It also hosted the finals of the 2004 &amp; 2017 ICC Champions Trophy and the 2023 ICC World Test Championship Final.

==History==

The Oval is built on part of the former Kennington Common. Cricket matches were played on the common throughout the early 18th century. The earliest recorded match was the London v Dartford match in June 1724. However, as the common was also used regularly for public executions of those convicted at the Surrey Assizes (it was the south London equivalent of Tyburn), cricket matches had moved away to the Artillery Ground by the 1740s. Kennington Common was eventually enclosed in the mid-19th century under a scheme sponsored by the royal family.

In 1844, the site of the Kennington Oval was a cabbage patch and market garden owned by the Duchy of Cornwall. The Duchy was willing to lease the land for the purpose of a cricket ground, and on 10 March 1845 the first lease, which the club later assumed, was issued to Mr. William Houghton (then president of the progenitor Montpelier Cricket Club) by the Otter Trustees who held the land from the Duchy &quot;to convert it into a subscription cricket ground&quot;, for 31 years at a rent of £120 per annum plus taxes amounting to £20. The original contract for turfing The Oval cost £300; the 10,000 grass turfs came from Tooting Common and were laid in the spring of 1845 allowing for the first cricket match to be played in May 1845. Hence, Surrey County Cricket Club (SCCC) was established in 1845.

The popularity of the ground was immediate and the strength of the SCCC grew. On 3 May 1875 the club acquired the remainder of the leasehold for a further term of 31 years from the Otter Trustees for the sum of £2,800.

In 1868, 20,000 spectators gathered at The Oval for the first game of the 1868 Aboriginal cricket tour of England, the first tour of England by any foreign side. Thanks to C.W. Alcock, the Secretary of Surrey from 1872 to 1907, the first Test match in England was played at The Oval in 1880 between England and Australia. The Oval, thereby, became the second ground to stage a Test, after Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG). In 1882, Australia won the Test by seven runs within two days. &quot;The Sporting Times&quot; printed a mocking obituary notice for English cricket, which led to the creation of the Ashes trophy, which is still contested whenever England plays Australia. The first Test double century was scored at The Oval in 1884 by Australia&#x27;s Billy Murdoch.

Surrey&#x27;s ground is noted as having the first artificial lighting at a sports arena, in the form of gas-lamps, dating to 1889. The current pavilion was completed in time for the 1898 season.

In 1907, South Africa became the second visiting Test team to play a Test match at the ground. In 1928, the West Indies played its first Test match at The Oval, followed by New Zealand in 1931. In 1936, India became the fifth foreign visiting Test side to play at The Oval, followed by Pakistan in 1954 and Sri Lanka in 1998. Zimbabwe, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Ireland have yet to play a Test match at The Oval.
The Oval is referenced by the poet Philip Larkin in his poem about the First World War, &quot;MCMXIV&quot;. During World War II, The Oval was requisitioned, initially housing anti-aircraft searchlights. It was then turned into a prisoner-of-war camp, intended to hold enemy parachutists. However, as they never came, The Oval was never actually used for this purpose.

The first One Day International match at this venue was played on 7 September 1973 between England and West Indies. It hosted matches of the 1975, 1979, 1983, and 1999 World Cups. It also hosted five of the fifteen matches in the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy, including the final. The Oval once held the record for the largest playing area of any Test venue in the world. That record has since been surpassed by Gaddafi Stadium in Pakistan, although The Oval remains the largest in Great Britain.

Billionaire Paul Getty, who had a great affinity for cricket and was at one time SCCC President, built a replica of The Oval on his Wormsley Park estate.

The famous gasholders just outside the ground were built around 1853. With the gasholders long disused, there was much speculation as to whether they should be demolished; however, many believe they are an integral part of The Oval&#x27;s urban landscape and, therefore, their future looks secure. In 2016 the main gasholder was given official protected status as a historically important industrial structure.

On 20 August 2006, The Oval saw the first time a team forfeited a Test match. Pakistan were upset after umpires Darrell Hair and Billy Doctrove awarded five penalty runs to the opposition and changed the ball after ruling that the team had tampered with it on the fourth day of the final Test against England. Pakistan debated the matter during the tea break and then refused to come out for the final session in protest. By the time they relented and decided to resume, the umpires had already called time on the match and awarded the game to England by default.

The Oval hosted its hundredth Test, against South Africa, on 27 July 2017, becoming the fourth Test venue in the world after Lord&#x27;s, MCG and SCG to do so. Moeen Ali also became the first player to ever take a Test hat-trick at The Oval, bowling out South Africa in the second innings to win the match.

In Tests, the highest team score at The Oval is 903/7 declared by England against Australia on 20 August 1938. The leading run scorers are Len Hutton (1,521 runs), Alastair Cook (1,217 runs) and Graham Gooch (1,097 runs). The leading wicket takers are Ian Botham (52 wickets), Derek Underwood (45 wickets) and James Anderson (44 wickets).

In ODIs, the highest team score at The Oval is 398/5 by New Zealand against England on 12 June 2015. The leading ODI run scorers are Eoin Morgan (630 runs), Marcus Trescothick (528 runs) and Joe Root (480 runs). The leading ODI wicket takers are James Anderson (30 wickets) and Darren Gough (13 wickets).

In 2021, the Oval Invincibles were formed as a team in the newly-launched The Hundred competition. The initial games in both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s competition were played on the ground.

==End names==
The north-western end of The Oval is traditionally known as the &quot;Vauxhall End&quot;, as it is nearer to the district of Vauxhall and its railway station. The opposite end (south-east) is known as the &quot;Pavilion&quot; &quot;End&quot; as it is the location of the Members&#x27; Pavilion.

==21st-century redevelopment==

At the end of the 2002 cricket season, Surrey started redeveloping the Vauxhall End. The development included demolishing the outdated Surridge, Fender, Jardine, and Peter May north stands, and creating in their place a single four-tier grandstand. From completion until 2020 it was known as the OCS stand, as it was sponsored by Outsourced Client Solutions International Facilities Management Services. As of the start of the 2021 season it is now known as the JM Finn stand because of a sponsorship deal with JM Finn This work was completed in May 2005 and increased ground capacity to around 23,000.

In January 2007, Surrey CCC, announced plans to increase capacity by a further 2,000 seats, this time by redeveloping the Pavilion End. The Lock, Laker, and Peter May south stands were to be replaced by a new stand, which would have a hotel backing on to it. The Surrey Tavern at the entrance to the ground would be demolished, and a new pedestrian plaza would be created in its place, improving access to the ground and opening up views of the historic pavilion. These plans were delayed by objections raised by the Health &amp; Safety Executive as the ground is close to a gasometer. Planning permission was eventually granted, but development did not proceed due to the 2007–2008 financial crisis.

In 2009, four masts of semi-permanent telescopic floodlights costing £3.7m were installed for use in late-day through evening matches. The floodlights were especially designed to comply with strict residential planning regulations to lessen their visual impact and any light overspill to residents, as well as to improve the game experience within the ground by reducing excess glare that can affect players, umpires, broadcasters and spectators. Precision reflector systems were fitted for tight beam control to decrease overspill and direct light only where needed. Each mast was made extendable to a maximum height of and, when not in use, retractable to . At the end of each season, all four masts can be removed and stored away.

After the 2013 season, a new project was started to add &#x27;wings&#x27; to either side of the OCS Stand at the Vauxhall End of the ground. The development was finished in time for the start of the 2014 season. Each &#x27;wing&#x27; added 500 seats, increasing the capacity from 23,500 to 24,500.

In September 2015, the Peter May and Tony Lock stands were demolished, to be replaced by a single new and much larger stand named after Peter May. May led Surrey to their sixth and seventh consecutive County Championships in 1957 and 1958 and also captained England from 1955 to 1961, winning the Ashes in 1956. Construction of the new stand, which cost around £10m, began in September 2015. It officially opened on 15 May 2016, increasing the capacity of the ground by 1,300 seats to 25,300.

Following the demolition of the Tony Lock stand, the club renamed the Laker Stand as the Lock/Laker Stand, continuing to honour the contribution made by the spin partnership of Tony Lock and Jim Laker, who collectively took 3,108 wickets for the club.

The Lock/Laker stand was itself demolished in September 2019, and work began on the construction of a new development in its place, initially named &quot;One Oval Square&quot;. The new structure included a three-tier stand that increased the ground&#x27;s total capacity to 27,500, as well as providing facilities for the Club&#x27;s hospitality, conference and events businesses, and improved facilities for Members. The new stand opened in June 2021 and was renamed the M.A.R. Galadari Stand. The project is part of a planned £50m long-term redevelopment of the ground by Surrey County Cricket Club which will see The Oval transformed into the largest cricket stadium in the western hemisphere, with a capacity of 40,000.

Floodlights were added in the shape of an O for oval on one side of the ground to emulate the e-shaped floodlights at Edgbaston.

==Other sports==
===Football===
The Oval was also an important site in the historical development of football in England. Football had been played in this part of London for many years prior to the inauguration of The Oval: &quot;The Gymnastic Society&quot;, arguably the world&#x27;s first organised football club, met regularly at nearby Kennington Common during the second half of the eighteenth century to play the game.

Between 1950 and 1963, amateur club Corinthian Casuals played their home matches at The Oval, with the pitch at the Vauxhall End.

====First international football match====

The Oval was the venue for the first representative football match in the world on 5 March 1870, England against Scotland, organised by The Football Association. The game resulted in a 1–1 draw, but is not recognised by FIFA as the first official international match because the Scotland team was selected only from London-based Scottish players. Similar representative international matches between England and Scotland took place at The Oval until February 1872.

On 8 March 1873, the England national team beat Scotland 4–2 in the first officially recognised international match to be played in England. England continued to play occasionally at The Oval until 1889.


====First FA Cup final====

The Oval was the site of the first FA Cup final, and also both semi-final matches. On 16 March 1872, The Wanderers beat the Royal Engineers 1–0 to win the first FA Cup. This final was notable for the Engineers&#x27; then innovative footballing style of teamwork rather than individual play. C. W. Alcock, Secretary of The Football Association, was the prime mover in the creation of the competition. He had also just become Secretary of Surrey CCC, so The Oval was the natural choice of venue for the final. Alcock was also captain of the successful Wanderers side. Apart from 1873, The Oval hosted all subsequent FA Cup finals until 1892.

===Rugby===
Between 1872 and 1879, The Oval held seven full cap international rugby union matches. The final of the United Hospitals Challenge Cup, the oldest rugby union cup competition in the world, was also first held at The Oval on Wednesday 3 March 1875.

===Hockey===
From 1935 to 1949 England women&#x27;s international hockey matches were played at The Oval. One of these matches, in 1938, was the first match in any team sport to be televised by the BBC, as a trial for broadcasting the Oval Test later that year.

===Baseball===
On 12 March 1889, the Oval hosted an exhibition baseball game between the Chicago Whitestockings and an &quot;All-American&quot; team as part of Albert Spalding&#x27;s 1888-1889 baseball world tour. The Oval was reported to have been full, and the match was attended by the Prince of Wales who greeted the players following the game.

==Conferences and events==

As well as being an international sporting venue, The Oval has a conference and events business. The Corinthian Roof Terrace built on the OCS Stand in 2013 features panoramic views of the London skyline.

==Other events==
The ground has also hosted other sporting events and also music concerts.

On 18 September 1971, a day-long rock concert was held at The Oval to raise funds for famine relief in war-torn Bangladesh. Featuring The Faces and headlined by The Who, a crowd of over 40,000 people attended, with the stage sited at the Vauxhall End. The following year, two more successful concerts were held; the first featuring Frank Zappa and Hawkwind, the second featuring Emerson, Lake and Palmer and Genesis.

The Oval has hosted exhibition matches for Australian rules football. The first such match was held between and a team of All-Stars in 1972. In 1987, the Oval hosted what became known as the Battle of Britain between Carlton and North Melbourne, which included numerous fights and future multiple AFL Premiership coach Alastair Clarkson, at the time only a teenager, breaking Ian Aitken&#x27;s jaw. In 2005, a record crowd for Australian rules football in England (18,884) saw Fremantle defeat the West Coast Eagles in the Western Derby (thus far, the only edition of the fixture to not be played in Perth). In 2012, approximately 10,000 attended a post-season exhibition match between Port Adelaide and the Western Bulldogs, which Port Adelaide won by 1 point.

In 2011, ahead of an NFL International Series game at Wembley Stadium, the Chicago Bears used The Oval as a practice facility.

==Oval gasometer and gasworks==
A tall Victorian gasometer, sited less than 50 metres beyond the north-eastern stadium wall, has been a dominating feature of the view from the ground since the mid 1800s. A movement to preserve iconic gasometers across the UK as important and historic monuments of Britain&#x27;s industrial heritage has emerged in recent years, with the one visible from The Oval often cited as a particularly notable example. The skeletal but decorative wrought iron structure is a landmark in the area and has become an intrinsic part of The Oval&#x27;s history and urban allure. The cricket commentator Henry Blofeld once said in a broadcast, &quot;As the bowler runs in, it&#x27;s so quiet you can hear the creak of the gasometer.&quot;

Although long unused as a gas holder, the aging structure was only officially decommissioned in 2014, with plans to demolish it being announced in 2013. Blofeld stated: &quot;In comparison, pulling down the Victoria Memorial in front of Buckingham Palace would be child&#x27;s play.&quot;. After local public protest at the proposed demolition, in March 2016 the structure was given Grade II listed status to protect its future.

<text>Guildhall is a municipal building in the Moorgate area of the City of London, England. It is off Gresham and Basinghall streets, in the wards of Bassishaw and Cheap. The current building dates from the 15th century; however documentary evidence suggests that a guildhall had existed at the site since at least the early 12th century. The building has been used as a town hall for several hundred years, and is still the ceremonial and administrative centre of the City of London and its Corporation. It should not be confused with London&#x27;s City Hall, the administrative centre for Greater London. The term &quot;Guildhall&quot; refers both to the whole building and to its main room, which is a medieval great hall. It is a Grade I-listed building.

==History==

===Roman, Anglo-Saxon and Medieval===

During the Roman period, the Guildhall was the site of the London Roman Amphitheatre, rediscovered as recently as 1988. It was the largest in Roman Britain, partial remains of which are on public display in the basement of the Guildhall Art Gallery, and the outline of whose arena is marked with a black circle on the paving of the courtyard in front of the hall. The siting of the Anglo-Saxon Guildhall here was probably due to the amphitheatre&#x27;s remains. Excavations by Museum of London Archaeology at the entrance to Guildhall Yard exposed remains of the great 13th-century gatehouse built directly over the southern entrance to the Roman amphitheatre, which raises the possibility that enough of the Roman structure survived to influence the siting not only of the gatehouse and Guildhall itself but also of the church of St Lawrence Jewry whose strange alignment may shadow the elliptical form of the amphitheatre beneath.

The first documentary reference to a London Guildhall is dated 1127 or 1128; archaeologists have also discovered foundations dating to around that time. Legend describes the Guildhall site as being the location of the palace of Brutus of Troy, who according to Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s (1136) is said to have founded a city on the banks of the River Thames, known as Troia Nova, or New Troy.

The great hall is believed to be on a site of an earlier guildhall (one possible derivation for the word &quot;guildhall&quot; is the Anglo-Saxon &quot;gild&quot;, meaning payment, with a &quot;gild-hall&quot; being where citizens would pay their taxes). Possible evidence for this derivation may be in a reference to John Parker, the sergeant of &quot;Camera Guyhalde&quot;, London, in 1396.

===Current building===

Construction began on the current building in 1411 and was completed in 1440 under the supervision of John Croxton.


The Great Hall did not completely escape damage in the Great Fire of London in 1666; it was partially restored (with a flat roof) in 1670. The present grand entrance (the east wing of the south front), in &quot;Hindoostani Gothic&quot;, was added in 1788 by George Dance. A more extensive restoration than that in 1670 was completed in 1866 by the City of London architect Sir Horace Jones, who added a new timber roof in close keeping with the original hammerbeam ceiling. This replacement was destroyed during the Second Great Fire of London on the night of 29/30 December 1940, the result of a Luftwaffe fire-raid. It was replaced in 1954 during works designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, though the original hammerbeam design was not retained. The large, seated sculpture of Winston Churchill by Oscar Nemon, which was cast by H. H. Martyn &amp; Co., was unveiled by Churchill in 1955.

Trials at the Guildhall have included those of Anne Askew (the Protestant martyr), Thomas Cranmer (Archbishop of Canterbury) and Lady Jane Grey (&quot;the Nine Days&#x27; Queen&quot;) as well as Henry Garnet (executed for his complicity in the Gunpowder Plot of 1605).

The 1783 hearing of the infamous &quot;Zong&quot; case, the outcome of which focused public outrage about the transatlantic slave trade, also took place at Guildhall. On 16 November 1848, the pianist Frédéric Chopin made his last public appearance on a concert platform there. The marathon route of the 2012 Summer Olympics passed through Guildhall Yard.

==Present use==

Guildhall continues to serve as the headquarters for the City of London Corporation, with most of its offices housed in modern extensions to the north and west of the original building. The North Wing was designed by Giles Gilbert Scott and was built between 1955 and 1958, facing a new public square between Aldermanbury and Basinghall Street.
The West Wing was designed by Richard Gilbert Scott and built between 1970 and 1975 to a modernist style. The West Wing is separately listed as a Grade II listed building. The older part of Guildhall and the adjacent historic interiors are still used for official functions, and it is open to the public during the annual London Open House weekend. Guildhall Art Gallery was added to the complex in the 1990s. Guildhall Library, a public reference library with specialist collections on London, which include material from the 11th century onwards, is also housed in the complex.

==Gog and Magog==

Two giants, Gog and Magog, are associated with Guildhall. Legend has it that the two giants were defeated by Brutus and chained to the gates of his palace on the site of Guildhall. Early carvings of Gog and Magog were destroyed in Guildhall during the Great Fire of London. They were replaced in 1708 by a large pair of wooden statues carved by Captain Richard Saunders. These giants, on whom the current versions are based, lasted for more than two hundred years before they were destroyed in the Blitz. They, in turn, were replaced by a new pair carved by David Evans in 1953 and given to the City of London by Alderman Sir George Wilkinson, who had been Lord Mayor in 1940 at the time of the destruction of the previous versions.

==Functions==
Guildhall hosts many events throughout the year, the most notable one being the Lord Mayor&#x27;s Banquet, which is held in honour of the immediate-past Lord Mayor and is the first to be hosted by the new Lord Mayor of the City of London. In keeping with tradition, it is at this banquet that the Prime Minister makes a major world affairs speech. One of the last acts of the outgoing Lord Mayor is to present prizes at the City of London School prize day at Guildhall. Other events include those of various law firms and award evenings for the Wine and Spirit Education Trust (WSET). The Worshipful Company of Carmen holds its cart-marking ceremony in the courtyard each July.

In 1992 during the Ruby Jubilee of Elizabeth II, a lunch was held at Guildhall to mark the 40th year of the Queen&#x27;s reign. Elizabeth II made a famous &#x27;annus horribilis&#x27; speech after the 1992 Windsor Castle fire and the separation of two of her children.

==Guildhall Bar==
The members&#x27; bar in the Guildhall is a highly subsidised facility for members of the Court of Common Council and the Court of Aldermen. Access to the facilities is a privilege for life, even after an individual ceases to be a member of either of these courts. Members can also entertain guests there. It is substantially cheaper than any other bar in the City of London, as it is subsidised from the City&#x27;s Cash, a sovereign wealth fund.

<text>A pub crawl (sometimes called a bar tour, bar crawl or bar-hopping) is the act of visiting multiple pubs or bars in a single session.

==Background==
Many European cities have public pub crawls that serve as social gatherings for local expatriates and tourists.

In the UK, pub crawls are generally spontaneous nights out in which the participants arrange to meet somewhere and decide over drinks where to drink next. Structured routes with regular stops are rare. Most drinking sessions based around a special occasion such as a birthday or a leaving celebration will involve a pub crawl, often with the group splitting up but agreeing on meeting at the next location. It is a common sight in UK towns to see several groups orbiting the various drinking locations with little apparent coherence or structure.

In the north of Spain, around the Basque Country, the tradition for groups of male friends crawling pubs and drinking a short glass of wine at each pub, and often singing traditional songs, is known as &quot;txikiteo&quot; or &quot;chiquiteo&quot;, and can be held at night or day. By the end of the 20th century, it was extended also to women, and when it involves a wider variety of drinks, it is more often called &quot;poteo&quot;.

==By country==
===United Kingdom===
In Glasgow, the Subcrawl is a pub crawl carried out using the circular Glasgow Subway line in the city. It involves having a drink at the nearest pub to each of the 15 stops on the line.

In Leeds, the Otley Run is seen as a rite of passage for students.

In London, the Monopoly board pub crawl is based around having a drink at a pub in each of the places on a British Monopoly board, set in London. Thousands of New Zealanders take part in the annual Waitangi Day pub crawl, which takes place around the Circle Line on the London Underground. Starting at Paddington they work anti-clockwise around the line, ending at Westminster for a haka (traditional New Zealand challenge/dance). While numbers vary depending on the weather, in 2008 there were reported to be around 12,000 people involved. First started by the historian Al Richardson in the 1960s, the Karl Marx pub crawl is based around various pubs the communist philosopher is reputed to have drunk at in and around Soho.

In York, there is an annual charity event known as the Assize of Ale. It is based on the medieval Assize of Bread and Ale and led by the Guild of Scriveners and Sheriff and of the City.

The 2013 film &quot;The World&#x27;s End&quot; starring Simon Pegg and Nick Frost is plotted around a group of friends embarking on a pub crawl in their home town.

===Australia===

In Adelaide, a pub crawl is run annually by The Adelaide University Engineering Society (AUES). The event attracts students from all over South Australia to as many as 34 local pubs and clubs. In 2015 the event had 6,000 participants while 2014 and 2013 both had 5,000 participants.

In Brisbane, the Mining and Metallurgy Association (MAMA) at the University of Queensland have been awarded the Brisbane City Council (BCC) and University of Queensland Union (UQU) Award for Social Activities of the Year due to their well-known Pub Crawl.

A pub crawl held annually in Maryborough, Queensland, Australia, attracted 4,718 participants on 14 June 2009. Since the early 1990s disability advocate Des Ryan OAM has organised an annual Accessible Pub Crawl in Rockhampton during which groups of up to 40 people travel by bus from venue to venue. After visiting each pub questionnaires are filled out rating positives and negatives in terms of accessibility and information is later given to hotel management and shared in the media.

===Ireland===
A pub crawl in December is called the &quot;12 pubs of Christmas&quot; in which participants try to drink one drink in 12 pubs while wearing Christmas clothes.

===Japan===
In Japan, pub crawls are called &quot;hashigozake&quot; (はしご酒, literally &quot;Ladder Alcohol&quot;) and are a part of the night-life. Events of organized pub crawls are also common in the country.

===Belgium===
The city of Antwerp has a tradition called &quot;elfkroegentocht&quot; or &quot;eleven bars walk&quot; where a company, often friends or work relatives, will celebrate by walking from one bar to the next and have a &quot;bolleke&quot; of De Koninck beer at each. The figure of &quot;11&quot; may refer to carnival festivities.

=== Finland ===
In Finland, pub crawls are a common student event, usually by the name of appro. The best known appro events attract students from all over the country: Hämeenkadun Appro in Tampere has roughly 10,000 participants every year, Kauppakadun Appro in Jyväskylä has c. 8000.

Often the participants of the event receive a jacket patch, which is then sewn onto the student boilersuits worn by many in the appro events. Normally, the colour of the patch depends on how many drinks one has had during the pub crawl; for example, in Kauppakadun Appro, getting the golden patch requires 17 drinks from women and 19 drinks from men.

=== New Zealand ===
The annual Talk Like a Pirate Day pubcrawl is run in New Plymouth every year. It started in 2005 with only three pirates and over the years has grown to hundreds.

===United States===
The Running A Tab Pub Run takes place monthly in San Antonio, Texas, and is hosted by WeRunSanAntonio. The original Running A Tab Pub Run covered 5 miles in downtown San Antonio. The starting point was the historic Sunset Station and finished at the Blue Star Brewery and Art Complex. The event is held in conjunction with San Antonio&#x27;s First Friday Art Walk. In 2009 the route was modified to accommodate the more than 500 participants every month. Running A Tab now consists of a 3-mile downtown loop and 5 bars/restaurants. A theme is selected every month and participants dress in costume in accordance with the theme. The event is free and open to the public.

In Charlotte, North Carolina, there is a yearly pub crawl on the Saturday nearest to Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day sponsored by Rich and Bennett. According to the Rich and Bennett website it is billed as the World&#x27;s Largest Pub Crawl with over 20,000 participants all wearing the event t-shirts. In 2020 it was postponed due to the coronavirus Pandemic. It was rescheduled for 27 June.
An annual Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day bar crawl, LepreCon, takes place in Hoboken, New Jersey. The 2016 event, held in the evening 5–6 March, degenerated into a violent brawl. Fifteen people were arrested and 35 hospitalized, including two police officers. The officers were injured when one of the participants was seeking to flee the scene. Hoboken police responded to 432 calls from service during the event and issued 54 tickets, mostly for public drinking. The 2015 event resulted in 93 summonses and 11 arrests. The 2016 LepreCont cost the City of Hoboken $110,000 in police overtime. Two hundred officers were deployed for the event. Hoboken&#x27;s police chief, Ken Ferrante, said he was &quot;disturbed by the repeated behavior that is occurring on these types of themed events,&quot; and said he &quot;will not tolerate having any of our officers injured, for the purposes of a few to make a financial profit at the expense of our residents.&quot;

In Louisville, Kentucky, the &quot;Bambi Walk&quot; has been underway since the 1980s.

In Minneapolis, Minnesota, a zombie-themed pub crawl commenced in 2005 and had grown to over 30,000 participants in 2012.

At Epcot in Walt Disney World, guests often do a form of bar crawl known as Drink Around the World, where visitors attempt to drink at all eleven countries of World Showcase.

==Santa-themed pub crawls==
The SantaCon pub crawl originated in San Francisco in 1994 and has since spread to 300 cities in 44 countries, including New York City. London, Vancouver, Belfast and Moscow. The New York SantaCon is the largest, with an estimated 30,000 people participating in 2012. Other events were much smaller and more subdued, with 30 participating in Spokane, Washington.

In New York City, where it has taken place since 1997, it has come under widespread criticism for rowdiness by participants, with drunken behavior that has disrupted parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn, and led to calls for the event to be ended and for participant misbehavior to be curbed. Former Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said that despite &quot;some rowdy actions by a small handful of people in the past,&quot; SantaCon was &quot;an event that we support. It&#x27;s what makes New York New York.&quot; During the New York City SantaCon in 2012, participants &quot;left a trail of trouble&quot; through Hell&#x27;s Kitchen, Midtown Manhattan, the East Village and Williamsburg. Residents complained revelers vomited and urinated in the street and fought with each other.

In London, the London Santa Pub Crawl has been held each December since 2004. The event sees participants dress up as Santa Claus, and visit a selection of London pubs along a pre-planned route. From just 25 participants in its first year, the event now sees more than 300 Santas take to the streets to enjoy the festivities. Participants are asked to donate to support the event&#x27;s nominated charity, and more than £5,000 has been raised over the years for the British Red Cross and St Christopher&#x27;s Hospice. The 2014 London Santa Pub Crawl took place on Saturday 13 December 2014.

In Brisbane, Australia, the Christmas Pub Crawl runs each year on the first Saturday following the end of the school year in December. This event has been running annually since 1982 and is now &quot;the world&#x27;s longest running pub crawl&quot;. Santa-themed pub crawls also take place each December in the towns of Wollongong and Grafton, with proceeds donated to charity. In 2015 local police announced cancellation of the Grafton event, but were opposed by the mayor.

It is better known for its original incarnation as a legal, free music-sharing service, named after the popular music file format MP3, popular with independent musicians for promoting their work. That service was shut down on December 2, 2003, by CNET, which, after purchasing the domain name (but not MP3.com&#x27;s technology or music assets), established the current MP3.com site.

Around April 2024, MP3.com&#x27;s domain was quietly taken offline with no redirect in place.

==Original version==

===History===
MP3.com was co-founded in December 1997 by Michael Robertson and Greg Flores, as part of Z Company. Z Company ran a variety of websites: filez.com, websitez.com, and sharepaper.com, purchased from Lars Matthiassen.

The idea to purchase the MP3.com domain arose when Flores was monitoring search traffic on filez.com, a FTP search site whose first incarnation provided an easy-to-use graphical interface for searching for various types of files including software, graphics, video, and audio. The first version of files utilized an existing free search engine developed by graduate students (led by Tor Egge, who later founded Fast Search and Transfer based on this search engine) at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. Flores noticed in his review of the search logs that people were searching for &quot;mp3&quot;.

Robertson told Flores to search for a site that was working with legitimate MP3 information and see if that company would be interested in working with them. Robertson e-mailed the then-owner of MP3.com, Martin Paul, to purchase the URL. The business plan was to use MP3.com to drive more search queries to Filez.com, the source of most of the company revenue at the time. Filez.com&#x27;s free search results contained pay-for-placement click-through results. MP3.com received over 18,000 unique users in the first 24 hours of making the URL live, and Flores received his first advertising purchase call within 18 hours of launch. The resulting advertising purchase and traffic caused the team to re-direct focus to MP3.com.

In 1998, the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS) refused to run an ad that MP3.com had purchased for inclusion in NARAS&#x27;s &quot;Grammy Magazine&quot;. The ad said, &quot;What the whole world listens to…Future Grammy winners found here&quot;. NARAS&#x27;s reason for pulling the ad was &quot;the limited number of advertising positions available in the magazine in conjunction with the somewhat controversial nature of your product.&quot;

Cox Interactive Media invested $45 million and acquired 10% of MP3.com in June 1999. A few months later, the two companies launched mp3radio.com, a joint project intended to create mini-websites to offer MP3 downloads, concert tickets, and, eventually, CD sales to listeners of Cox&#x27;s terrestrial radio stations.

MP3.com went public on July 21, 1999, and raised over $370 million, at the time, the single largest technology IPO to date. The stock was offered at $28 per share, rose to $105 per share during the day, and closed at $63.3125.

In its heyday, MP3.com was the Internet home to many independent musicians, each of whom had an individual web presence at the URL www.mp3.com/*name-of-act*. At the end of 1999, MP3.com launched a promotion that allowed these artists to monetize their content on the site. Called &quot;Pay for Play&quot; or P4P, it used an algorithm to pay each MP3.com artist based on the number of streams and downloads of their songs.

Artists provided 96 hours of audio content per day from the summer of 1999 to the summer of 2003: about one song per minute or 16 listening years of audio content over four years. A staff of trained music experts reviewed all content before publication to prevent uploads of unlicensed materials.

Alanis Morissette was an early investor in the site after it sponsored one of her tours. She owned nearly 400,000 shares in the company which she sold off through a series of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings in late 1999 and early 2000. Her holdings and profit from the venture were $3.4 million at her exit.

At its peak, MP3.com delivered over 4 million MP3 formatted audio files per day to over 800,000 unique users on a customer base of 25 million registered users – about 4 terabytes of data delivery per month from three data centers. Engineers at MP3.com designed and built the Pressplay infrastructure, later purchased by Roxio on May 19, 2003, which they used as a base to relaunch Napster. MP3.com also managed eMusic, Rollingstone.com and Vivendi Universal music properties. MP3.com engineering developed their own content delivery network and data warehousing technologies handling seven terabytes of customer profile information.

===Infrastructure===
The technology infrastructure at MP3.com consisted of over 1500 simple Intel-based servers running Red Hat Linux (versions 5.2–7.2) in load-balanced clusters in data centers run by AT&amp;T, Worldcom and the now defunct Exodus Communications. It was one of the first massively scalable Internet architectures for media delivery. The software of choice was C, Perl, Apache, Squid, MySQL some Oracle and Sybase. This architecture routinely pushed 1.2 Gbit/s total traffic globally.

===My.MP3.com===

On January 12, 2000, MP3.com launched the &quot;My.MP3.com&quot; service which enabled users to securely register their CDs and then stream digital copies online from the My.MP3.com service. Since consumers could only listen online to music they already proved they owned the company saw this as a great opportunity for revenue by allowing fans to access their music online. The record industry did not see it that way and sued MP3.com claiming that the service constituted unauthorized duplication and promoted copyright infringement.

Judge Jed S. Rakoff, in the case UMG v. MP3.com, ruled in favor of the record labels against MP3.com and the service on the copyright law provision of &quot;making mechanical copies for commercial use without permission from the copyright owner.&quot; Before damage was awarded, MP3.com settled with the plaintiff, UMG Recordings, for $53.4 million, in exchange for the latter&#x27;s permission to use its entire music collection. Later, the firm no longer had sufficient funds to weather the technology downturn. MP3.com was subsequently bought and the new owner did not continue the same service.

===MP3.com sold===
Weakened financially, MP3.com was eventually acquired by Vivendi Universal, the then-owner of Universal Studios, Sierra Entertainment, Blizzard Entertainment and Knowledge Adventure in May 2001 at $5 per share ($23 below the IPO share price) or approximately $372 million in cash and stock. Jean-Marie Messier, then-CEO of Vivendi Universal, stated &quot;The acquisition of MP3.com was an extremely important step in our strategy to create both a distribution platform and acquire state-of-the-art technology. MP3.com will be a great asset to Vivendi Universal in meeting our goal of becoming the leading online provider of music and related services.&quot;

Vivendi Universal had difficulties growing the service and eventually dismantled the original site, selling off all of its assets including the URL and logo to CNET in 2003.

E-mails to MP3.com artists and a placeholder message at MP3.com announced that CNET would be coming up with replacement services in the future, based on its current download.com facilities.

A business unit of MP3.com, Trusonic, which provides background music and messaging services to retailers, acquired licenses with 250,000 artists representing 1.7 million songs. Trusonic partnered with GarageBand.com to revive these artist accounts. Trusonic retained most of the software technology developed at MP3.com and exists today as part of the Mood Media organization.

On March 25, 2009, MP3.com announced in an editor blog entry that they would begin redirecting all of their artist pages and categories to Last.fm.

<doc id="387701" wikidata="Q581450" url="?curid=387701" title="Fallen angel">
<text>Fallen angels are angels who were expelled from Heaven. The literal term &quot;fallen angel&quot; does not appear in any Abrahamic religious texts, but is used to describe angels cast out of heaven. Such angels are often described as corrupting humanity by teaching forbidden knowledge or by tempting them into sin. Common motifs for their expulsion are lust, pride, envy, or an attempt to usurp divinity.

The first idea of the concept of fallen angels may be found in Canaanite beliefs about the &quot;bənē hāʾĔlōhīm&quot; (&quot;sons of God&quot;), expelled from the divine court. &quot;Hêlêl ben Šāḥar&quot; is thrown down from heaven for claiming equality with &quot;ʻElyōn&quot;. Such stories are later collected in the Old Testament and appear in pseudepigraphic Jewish literature. Under the assumption that the &quot;sons of God&quot; () mentioned in Genesis 6:1–4 or the Book of Enoch, are angels, derives the concept of fallen angels. In the period immediately preceding the composition of the New Testament, some groups of Second Temple Judaism identified these &quot;sons of God&quot; as fallen angels. 
During the late Second Temple period the Nephilim were considered to be the monstrous offspring of fallen angels and human women. In such accounts, God sends the Great Deluge to purge the world of these creatures; their bodies are destroyed, yet their souls survive, thereafter roaming the earth as demons. Rabbinic Judaism and early Christian authorities after the third century rejected the Enochian writings and the notion of an illicit union between angels and women.

Christian theology teaches that the sins of fallen angels occur before the beginning of human history. Accordingly, fallen angels became identified with those led by Lucifer in rebellion against God, also equated with demons. The angelic origin of demons was important for Christianity insofar as Christian monotheism holds that evil is a corruption of goodness rather than an independent ontological principle. Conceptualizing fallen angels as purely spiritual beings, both good and evil angels were envisioned as rational beings without bodily limitations. Thus, Western Christian philosophy also implemented the fall of angels as a thought experiment about how evil will could occur from within the mind without external influences and explores questions regarding morality.

The Quran refers to motifs reminiscent of fallen angels in earlier Abrahamic writings. However, the interpretation of these beings is disputed. Some Muslim exegetes regard Satan (&quot;Iblīs&quot;) to be an angel, while others do not. According to the viewpoint of Ibn Abbas (619–687), Iblis was an angel created from fire (&quot;nār as-samūm&quot;), while according to Hasan of Basra (642–728), he was the progenitor of the &quot;jinn&quot;. Harut and Marut are a pair of angels mentioned in the Quran who are often said to have fallen to earth due to their negative remarks on humanity.

Fallen angels further appear throughout both Christian and Islamic popular culture, as in Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; (1308–1320), John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, and Hasan Karacadağ&#x27;s &quot;Semum&quot; (2008).

== Canaanite origin ==
The Elohist sources speak of &quot;bənē hāʾĔlōhīm&quot; (&quot;sons of God&quot;), manifestations of the Divine (&quot;ʾēl&quot;) and part of the heavenly court in the Canaanite pantheon. According to Genesis 6:1–4 the &quot;bənē hāʾĔlōhīm&quot; descended to earth and mated with human women and beget the Nephilim, followed by God sending down a flood clean the world from humans.

A passage from the Book of Psalms, although at least five hundred years apart from the passage in Genesis speaks about a similar heavenly court. According to the text, God delivers judgement upon the gods by turning them into mortals Although the text does not imply that the gods fell from heaven, it parallels their descend from immortality to mortality. Unlike Genesis, the text is silent about the sins of the gods.

As evident from the Old Testament, in later Hebrew tradition, angels became identified with stars. As such, the Book of Isaiah, narrating the fall of a deity, serves as a template for the later belief in fallen angels. According to the Book of Isaiah, &quot;Hêlêl ben Šāḥar&quot;, son of &quot;Šāḥar&quot;, known from the Ugaritic poem of Shachar (dawn) and Shalim (dusk), claims equality with ʻElyōn and is then thrown down into the abyss as means of punishment.

== Second Temple period ==
Fallen angels frequently appear in pseudepigraphic Jewish apocalyptic religious texts dated to the Second Temple period between 530 BC and 70 AD: in the Book of Enoch, the Book of Jubilees, and the Qumran &quot;Book of Giants&quot;. Genesis 6:1–4 serves as the template for the story, but it is unclear if the same myth has existed in the Canaanite period.

Some scholars consider it most likely that the Jewish tradition of fallen angels predates, even in written form, the composition of Gen 6:1–4. In the Book of Enoch, these Watchers &quot;fell&quot; after they became &quot;enamored&quot; with human women. The Second Book of Enoch (&quot;Slavonic Enoch&quot;) refers to the same beings of the (First) Book of Enoch, as &quot;Grigori&quot; in the Greek transcription. Compared to the other Books of Enoch, fallen angels play a less significant role in 3 Enoch. 3 Enoch mentions only three fallen angels called Azazel, Azza and Uzza. Similar to The first Book of Enoch, they taught sorcery on earth, causing corruption. Unlike the first Book of Enoch, there is no mention of the reason for their fall and, according to 3 Enoch 4.6, they also later appear in heaven objecting to the presence of Enoch.

=== 1 Enoch ===
According to 1 Enoch 7.2, the Watchers become &quot;enamoured&quot; with human women and have intercourse with them. The offspring of these unions, and the knowledge they were giving, corrupt human beings and the earth (1 Enoch 10.11–12). Eminent among these angels are Samyaza and Azazel. Like many other fallen angels mentioned in 1 Enoch 8.1–9, Azazel introduces men to &quot;forbidden arts&quot;, and it is Azazel who is rebuked by Enoch himself for illicit instruction, as stated in 1 Enoch 13.1. According to 1 Enoch 10.6, God sends the archangel Raphael to chain Azazel in the desert Dudael as punishment. Further, Azazel is blamed for the corruption of earth:

An etiological interpretation of 1 Enoch deals with the origin of evil. By shifting the origin of mankind&#x27;s sin and their misdeeds to illicit angel instruction, evil is attributed to something supernatural from without. This motif, in 1 Enoch, differs from that of later Jewish and Christian theology; in the latter evil is something from within. According to a paradigmatic interpretation, 1 Enoch might deal with illicit marriages between priests and women. As evident from Leviticus 21:1–15, priests were prohibited to marry impure women. Accordingly, the fallen angels in 1 Enoch are the priests counterpart, who defile themselves by marriage. Just like the angels are expelled from heaven, the priests are excluded from their service at the altar. Unlike most other apocalyptic writings, 1 Enoch reflects a growing dissatisfaction with the priestly establishments in Jerusalem in the 3rd century BC. The paradigmatic interpretation parallels the Adamic myth in regard of the origin of evil: In both cases, transcending one&#x27;s own limitations inherent in their own nature causes their fall. This contrasts the etiological interpretation, which implies another power besides God, in heaven. The latter solution therefore poorly fits into monotheistic thought. Otherwise, the introduction to illicit knowledge might reflect a rejection of foreign Hellenistic culture. Accordingly, the fallen angels represent creatures of Greek mythology, which introduced forbidden arts, used by Hellenistic kings and generals, resulting in oppression of Jews.

=== 2 Enoch ===
The concept of fallen angels is also in the Second Book of Enoch. It tells about Enoch&#x27;s ascent through the layers of heaven. During his journey, he encounters fallen angels imprisoned in the 2nd heaven. At first, he decides to pray for them, but refuses to do so, since he himself as merely human, would not be worthy to pray for angels. In the 5th heaven however, he meets other rebellious angels, here called &quot;Grigori&quot;, remaining in grief, not joining the heavenly hosts in song. Enoch tries to cheer them up by telling about his prayers for their fellow angels and thereupon they join the heavenly liturgy.

Strikingly, the text refers to the leader of the Grigori as Satanail and not as Azael or Shemyaza, as in the other Books of Enoch. But the Grigori are identified with the Watchers of 1 Enoch.

The narration of the Grigori in 2 Enoch 18:1–7, who went down on to earth, married women and &quot;befouled the earth with their deeds&quot;, resulting in their confinement under the earth, shows that the author of 2 Enoch knew about the stories in 1 Enoch. The longer recension of 2 Enoch, chapter 29 refers to angels who were &quot;thrown out from the height&quot; when their leader tried to become equal in rank with the Lord&#x27;s power (2 Enoch 29:1–4), an idea probably taken from Ancient Canaanite religion about Attar, trying to rule the throne of Baal.

=== Jubilees ===
The Book of Jubilees, an ancient Jewish religious work, accepted as canonical by the Ethiopian Orthodox Church and Beta Israel, refers to the Watchers, who are among the angels created on the first day. However, unlike the (first) Book of Enoch, the Watchers are commanded by God to descend to earth and to instruct humanity. It is only after they copulate with human women that they transgress the laws of God. These illicit unions result in demonic offspring, who battle each other until they die, while the Watchers are bound in the depths of the earth as punishment. In Jubilees 10:1, another angel called Mastema appears as the leader of the evil spirits. He asks God to spare some of the demons, so he might use their aid to lead humankind into sin. Afterwards, he becomes their leader: 

Both the (first) Book of Enoch and the Book of Jubilees include the motif of angels introducing evil to humans. However, unlike the Book of Enoch, the Book of Jubilees does not hold that evil was caused by the fall of angels in the first place, although their introduction to sin is affirmed. Further, while the fallen angels in the Book of Enoch are acting against God&#x27;s will, the fallen angels and demons in the Book of Jubilees seem to have no power independent from God but only act within his power.

== Rabbinic Judaism ==

=== Early Rabbinic literature ===
Although the concept of fallen angels developed from Jewish texts written during the Second Temple period, rabbis from the second century onward turned against the Enochian writings, probably in order to prevent fellow Jews from worship and veneration of angels. Thus, while many angels were individualized and sometimes venerated during the Second Temple period, the status of angels was degraded to a class of creatures on the same level of humans, thereby emphasizing the omnipresence of God. The 2nd-century rabbi Shimon bar Yochai cursed everyone who explained the term &quot;sons of God&quot; as angels. He stated sons of God were actually sons of judges or sons of nobles. Evil was no longer attributed to heavenly forces, now it was dealt as an &quot;evil inclination&quot; (&quot;yetzer hara&quot;) within humans. In some Midrashic works, the &quot;evil inclination&quot; is attributed to Samael, who is in charge of several &quot;satans&quot; in order to test humanity. Nevertheless, these angels are still subordinate to God; the reacceptance of rebel angels in Midrashic discourse was posterior and probably influenced by the role of fallen angels in Islamic and Christian lore.

=== Post-Talmudic works ===
The idea of rebel angels in Judaism reappears in the Aggadic-Midrashic work Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer, which shows not one, but two falls of angels. The first one is attributed to Samael, who refuses to worship Adam and objects to God favoring Adam over the angels, ultimately descending onto Adam and Eve to tempt them into sin. This seems rooted in the motif of the fall of Iblis in the Quran and the fall of Satan in the Cave of Treasures. The second fall echoes the Enochian narratives. Again, the &quot;sons of God&quot; mentioned in Gen 6:1–4 are depicted as angels. During their fall, their &quot;strength and stature became like the sons of man&quot; and again, they give existence to the giants by intercourse with human women.

=== Kabbalah ===
Although not strictly speaking &quot;fallen&quot;, evil angels reappear in Kabbalah. Some of them are named after angels taken from the Enochian writings, such as Samael. According to the Zohar, just as angels can be created by virtue, evil angels are an incarnation of human vices, which derive from the qlippoth, the representation of impure forces.

However, the Zohar also recalls a narration of two angels in a fallen state, called Aza and Azael. These angels are cast down from the heaven after mistrusting Adam for his inclination towards sin. Once on Earth, they complete the Enochian narrative by teaching magic to humans and producing offspring with them, as well as consorting with Lilith (hailed as &quot;the sinner&quot;). In the narrative, the Zohar affirms but simultaneously prohibits magical practices. As a punishment, God puts the angels in chains, but they still copulate with the demoness Naamah, who gives birth to demons, evil spirits and witches.

== Christianity ==
=== Bible ===

Luke 10:18 refers to &quot;Satan falling from heaven&quot; and Matthew 25:41 mentions &quot;the Devil and his angels&quot;, who will be thrown into Hell. All Synoptic Gospels identify Satan as the leader of demons. Paul the Apostle ( or 67) states in 1 Corinthians 6:3 that there are angels who will be judged, implying the existence of wicked angels. 2 Peter 2:4 and Jude 1:6 refer paraenetically to angels who have sinned against God and await punishment on Judgement Day. The Book of Revelation, chapter 12, speaks of Satan as the &quot;Great Red Dragon&quot; whose &quot;tail swept a third part of the stars of heaven and cast them to the earth&quot;. In verses 7–9, Satan is defeated in the War in Heaven against Michael and his angels: &quot;the great dragon was thrown down, that ancient serpent who is called the Devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world—he was thrown down to the earth and his angels were thrown down with him&quot;. Nowhere within the New Testament are fallen angels identified with demons, but by combining the references to Satan, demons, and angels, early Christian exegetes equated fallen angels with demons, for which Satan was regarded as the leader.

The First Epistle to the Corinthians in 11:10, according to the early Church Father Tertullian, references fallen angels; Tertullian taught that protection from the lust of the fallen angels was the reason for the Apostle Paul&#x27;s directive to Christian women to wear a headcovering (veil). Tertullian referenced a woman who was touched on the neck by a fallen angel &quot;who found her to be a temptation&quot;.

Origen and other early Christian writers linked the fallen morning star of Isaiah 14:12 of the Old Testament to Jesus&#x27; statement in Luke 10:18 that he &quot;saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven&quot;, as well as a passage about the fall of Satan in Revelation 12:8–9. The Latin word &quot;lucifer&quot;, as introduced in the late 4th-century AD Vulgate, gave rise to the name for a fallen angel.

Christian tradition has associated Satan not only with the image of the fallen &quot;morning star&quot; in Isaiah 14:12, but also with the denouncing in Ezekiel 28:11–19 of the King of Tyre, who is spoken of as having been a &quot;cherub&quot;. The Church Fathers saw these two passages as in some ways parallel, an interpretation also testified in apocryphal and pseudepigraphic works. However, &quot;no modern evangelical commentary on Isaiah or Ezekiel sees Isaiah 14 or Ezekiel 28 as providing information about the fall of Satan&quot;.

=== Early Christianity ===

Christianity originated in 1st-century Judea from a sect of apocalyptic Jewish Christians within the realm of Second Temple Judaism. The basic tenets of the Jewish religion during this era were ethical monotheism and the Torah, or the Mosaic Law. In this period, the Second Temple of Jerusalem was still central to Judaism, but synagogues were also established as institutions for prayer and the reading of Jewish sacred texts. The Hebrew Bible developed during the Second Temple Period, as the Jews decided which religious texts were of divine origin; the Masoretic Text, compiled by the Jewish scribes and scholars of the Early Middle Ages, comprises the Hebrew and Aramaic 24 books that they considered authoritative. Jewish messianism, and the Jewish Messiah concept, has its roots in the apocalyptic literature produced between the 2nd and 1st centuries BCE, promising a future &quot;anointed&quot; leader (messiah or king) from the Davidic line to resurrect the Israelite Kingdom of God, in place of the foreign rulers of the time.

The Hellenized Greek-speaking Jews of Alexandria produced a Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible called &quot;the Septuagint&quot;, that included books later identified as the Apocrypha, while the Samaritans produced their own edition of the Torah, the Samaritan Pentateuch; according to the Dutch–Israeli biblical scholar and linguist Emanuel Tov, professor of Bible Studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, both of these ancient editions of the Hebrew Bible differ significantly from the medieval Masoretic Text. Currently, all the main non-Protestant (Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Oriental Orthodox) Christian denominations accept as canonical the Deuterocanonical books, which were excluded from the modern Hebrew Bible and the Protestant Bible. The Septuagint was influential on early Christianity as it was the Hellenistic Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible primarily used by the 1st-century Christian authors.

During the period immediately before the rise of Christianity, the intercourse between the Watchers and human women was often seen as the first fall of the angels. Christianity stuck to the Enochian writings at least until the third century. Many Church Fathers such as Irenaeus, Justin Martyr, Clement of Alexandria, and Lactantius accepted the association of the angelic descent to the sons of God passage in Genesis 6:1–4. However, some Christian ascetics, such as Origen ( CE), rejected this interpretation. According to the Church Fathers who rejected the doctrine by Origen, these angels were guilty of having transgressed the limits of their nature and of desiring to leave their heavenly abode to experience sensual experiences. Irenaeus referred to fallen angels as apostates, who will be punished by an everlasting fire. Justin Martyr () identified pagan deities as fallen angels or their demonic offspring in disguise. Justin also held them responsible for Christian persecution during the first centuries. Tertullian and Origen also referred to fallen angels as teachers of astrology.

The Babylonian king, who is described as a fallen &quot;morning star&quot; in Isaiah 14:1–17, was probably the first time identified with a fallen angel by Origen. This description was interpreted typologically both as an angel and a human king. The image of the fallen morning star or angel was thereby applied to Satan by early Christian writers, following the equation of Lucifer to Satan in the pre-Christian century.

=== Roman Catholicism ===

The subject of fallen angels is covered in a number of catechisms of the Roman Catholic Church, including Rev. George Hay&#x27;s in which he answers the question &quot;What was the sin by which they fell?&quot;: &quot;It was pride, arising from the great beauty and sublime graces which God had bestowed upon them. For, seeing themselves such glorious beings, they fell in love with themselves, and, forgetting the God that made them, wished to be on an equality with their Creator.&quot; The consequence of this fall being that, &quot;they were immediately deprived of all their supernatural graces and heavenly beauty: they were changed from glorious angels into hideous devils; they were banished out of heaven, and condemned to the torments of hell, which was prepared to receive them.&quot;

In terms of the history of fallen angel theology it is thought to be rooted in Enochian literature, which Christians began to reject by the 3rd century. The sons of God came to be identified merely with righteous men, more precisely with descendants of Seth who had been seduced by women descended from Cain. The cause of evil was shifted from the superior powers of angels, to humans themselves, and to the very beginning of history; the expulsion of Satan and his angels on the one hand and the original sin of humans on the other hand. However, the Book of Watchers, which identified the sons of God with fallen angels, was not rejected by Syriac Christians or the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church. Augustine of Hippo&#x27;s work &quot;Civitas Dei&quot; (5th century) became the major opinion of Western demonology and for the Catholic Church. He rejected the Enochian writings and stated that the sole origin of fallen angels was the rebellion of Satan. As a result, fallen angels came to be equated with demons and depicted as non-sexual spiritual entities. The exact nature of their spiritual bodies became another topic of dispute during the Middle Ages. Augustine based his descriptions of demons on his perception of the Greek &quot;daimon&quot;. The Daimon was thought to be a spiritual being, composed of ethereal matter, a notion also used for fallen angels by Augustine. However, these angels received their ethereal body only after their fall. Later scholars tried to explain the details of their spiritual nature, asserting that the ethereal body is a mixture of fire and air, but that they are still composed of material elements. Others denied any physical relation to material elements, depicting the fallen angels as purely spiritual entities. But even those who believed the fallen angels had ethereal bodies did not believe that they could produce any offspring.

Augustine, in his &quot;Civitas Dei&quot; describes two cities (&quot;Civitates&quot;) distinct from each other and opposed to each other like light and darkness. The &quot;earthly city&quot; is caused by the act of rebellion of the fallen angels and is inhabited by wicked men and demons (fallen angels) led by Satan. On the other hand, the &quot;heavenly city&quot; is inhabited by righteous men and the angels led by God. Although, his ontological division into two different kingdoms shows resemblance of Manichean dualism, Augustine differs in regard of the origin and power of evil. In Augustine works, evil originates from free will. Augustine always emphasized the sovereignty of God over the fallen angels. Accordingly, the inhabitants of the earthly city can only operate within their God-given framework. The rebellion of angels is also a result of the God-given freedom of choice. The obedient angels are endowed with grace, giving them a deeper understanding of God&#x27;s nature and the order of the cosmos. Illuminated by God-given grace, they became incapable of feeling any desire for sin. The other angels, however, are not blessed with grace, thus they remain capable of sin. After these angels decide to sin, they fall from heaven and become demons. In Augustine&#x27;s view of angels, they cannot be guilty of carnal desires since they lack flesh, but they can be guilty of sins that are rooted in spirit and intellect such as pride and envy. However, after they have made their decision to rebel against God, they cannot turn back. The Catechism of the Catholic Church understands the fall of angels as radical and irrevocable rejection of God and his reign by some angels who, though created as good beings, freely chose evil, their sin being unforgivable because of the irrevocable character of their choice, not because of any defect in infinite divine mercy. Present-day Catholicism rejects Apocatastasis, the reconciliation with God suggested by the Church Father Origen.

=== Orthodox Christianity ===

==== Eastern Orthodox Christianity ====
Like Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodox Christianity shares the basic belief in fallen angels as spiritual beings who rebel against God. Unlike Roman Catholicism, however, there is no established doctrine about the exact nature of fallen angels, but Eastern Orthodox Christianity unanimously agrees that the power of fallen angels is always inferior to God. Therefore, belief in fallen angels can always be assimilated with local lore, as long it does not break basic principles and is in line with the Bible. Historically, some Eastern Orthodox theologians even tend to suggest that fallen angels could be rehabilitated in the &quot;world to come&quot;. Fallen angels, just like angels, play a significant role in the spiritual life of believers. As in Roman Catholicism, fallen angels are believed to tempt and incite people into sin, but mental illness is also linked to the influence of fallen angels. Those who have reached an advanced degree of spirituality are even thought to be able to envision them. Rituals and sacraments performed by Eastern Orthodox priests are thought to weaken such demonic influences.

==== Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church ====
Unlike most other Christian churches, the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church accepts 1 Enoch and the &quot;Book of Jubilees&quot; as canonical. As a result, the Church believes that human sin does not originate in Adam&#x27;s transgression alone, but also from Satan and other fallen angels. Together with demons, they continue to cause sin and corruption on earth.

=== Protestantism ===

Like Roman Catholicism, Protestantism continues with the concept of fallen angels as spiritual entities unrelated to flesh, but it rejects the angelology and demonology established by the Roman Catholic Church. Martin Luther&#x27;s (1483–1546) &quot;Sermons of the Angels&quot; merely recount the exploits of the fallen angels, and does not deal with an angelic hierarchy. Satan and his fallen angels are believed to be responsible for some misfortune in the world, but Luther always believed that the power of the good angels exceeds those of the fallen ones. The Italian Protestant theologian Girolamo Zanchi (15161590) offered further explanations for the reason behind the fall of the angels. According to Zanchi, the angels rebelled when the incarnation of Jesus Christ as the Son of God was revealed to them in incomplete form. While Mainline Protestants are much less concerned with the cause of angelic fall, arguing that it is neither useful nor necessary to know, other Protestant churches do have fallen angels as more of a focus.

=== Philosophy ===
Monotheism parted from cosmological dualism by insisting on the good origin of all things. This contrasts with alternative views, such as Manichaeism, proposing absolute evil as an entirely separate ontological principles. With the proposition that there is only one ultimate principle, Christian philosophy threatened the hypothesis that God can only cause good and needed to explain the origins of moral evil.

Thus, in Western Christian philosophy the fall of angels served as a thought experiment on how moral evil originates. Angels, as purely spiritual beings, were an example on how someone chooses evil despite optimal psychological and cognitive conditions. While according to many theories of Ancient Greek philosophy hold an intellectualist account of morality (i.e. that evil derives from a impeded intellectual cognition) the sin of angels, who are purely spiritual beings, needed an alterantive explanation.

The voluntarist account asserts that angels sinned by their own volution. While the intellectualists need to explain how a spiritual being can suffer from cognitive deficiencies, voluntarists need to explain how beings under the same psychological conditions make different moral choices.

Thomas Aquinas (c. 1225 – 7 March 1274), following an intellectualist approach, argued that the mind cannot comprehend all thoughts at once. As such, angels only consider on whatever they focus on, but if they do not focus on the highest good, they commit evil actions. Henry of Ghent (c. 1217 – 29 June 1293) asserts that evil volition must precede mistaken consideration. Defective reasoning is described as the result of evil will.

In the discussion concerning theodicy, the question of how evil can exist simultaneously with the existence of an all-powerful and all-good God, fallen angels are also proposed as an explanation for natural evil. The theory proposes that fallen angels can influence nature and cause suffering through natural disasters. Combined with the free-will of angels, natural disasters too may result from evil volition.

=== Folklore ===
In Christian folklore tales about encounters between men and spirits, the spirits were often explained as fallen angels. They would have been cast out of heaven, damned to roam the world as demons, but were not so evil that they were sentenced to hell, like Lucifer and his devils. Yet they were still not as good to remain in heaven. Therefore, they would live between heaven and hell among humans in liminal spaces.

Caesarius of Heisterbach&#x27;s () asserted that not all fallen angels are equally bad. Some fallen angels would be banished for not actively defending God against Lucifer, but since they did not side with the devils, would not be sentenced to hell. They remain loyal to God on earth, do good deeds, and bearing some resemblances to saints, as seen in the &quot;Dialogus Miraculorum&quot;, in which a knight is guided by a fallen angel to lead him back on the path of piety. In another tale, a neutral fallen angel became an assistant of a noble knight. However, when the knight learned that his best assistant was actually a demon, he dismissed him. When the knight wants to pay the demon for his service, the demon asserted that the knight should spend the money on a new bell for the church, instead.

According to &quot;The Brendan Voyage&quot;, during the Medieval Age, Brendan meets a group of angels referred to as &quot;wandering spirits&quot;. On holy days, they were embodied as white birds, symbols usually used for purity and the holy spirit. In later versions, such as the 15th Century Dutch and German variant, the fallen angels are much more depicted as akin to grotesque demons. Although they would not have supported Lucifer in his evil schemes, they would have been passive and not fighting for good, thus turned into animal-like creatures cast out of heaven.

Such earthly fallen angels were used as a possible origin of fairies in Irish and Scandinavian folk-tales. Depending on the place they fell, they will remain as spirits of the specific element, but are usually benevolent and harmless. If such fairies were identified with the Biblical fallen angels, their salvation after Judgement Day was usually denied, since the fallen angels could not return to heaven. Later Protestant thinkers increasingly dismissed belief in fairies and neutral angels as part of either fairy-tales or a delusion cast by Satan.

== Islam ==
The concept of fallen angels is debated in Islam. The influential Islamic ascetic Hasan of Basra (642–728) denied the possibility of angels sinning. 
Interpretations deriving from the companions of Muhammad, such as Ibn Abbas (619–687) and Abd Allah ibn Mas&#x27;ud (594–653) on the other hand report fallible angels. Most Sunni scholars agree with this view.

Opposition to the concept of the fallen angel is mostly found among the Qadariyah and most Mu&#x27;tazilites. Many Salafis also agree with this view. Those who oppose angelic fallibility refer to Surah at-Tahrim (66:6) in favor of their position:
O believers! Protect yourselves and your families from a Fire whose fuel is people and stones, overseen by formidable and severe angels, who never disobey whatever Allah orders—always doing as commanded.
Those who are in support of the concept of fallen angels (including Tabari, Suyuti, al-Nasafi, and al-Māturīdī) refer to &quot;al-Anbiya&quot; (21:29) stating that angels would be punished for sins and arguing that, if angels could not sin, they would not be warned to refrain from committing them:Whoever of them were to say, &quot;I am a god besides Him&quot;, they would be rewarded with Hell by Us [...]

It has been argued, even if fallen angels are considered, they are conceptually different from the fallen angels in Christianity, since they remain at the service of God and do not become God&#x27;s enemies. It has been stated that &quot;(...) according to Christianity, the devils are fallen angels who renounced their loyalty to God, in Islam it is God who dismissed the fallen angels&quot;.

Besides the Quran, other Islamic works allude to fallen angels. According to the Isma&#x27;ilism work &quot;Umm al-Kitāb&quot;, ʿAzāzīl, is the first creation of God. Because God gifted him the ability of creation, he claims divinity and is thrown into lower celestial spheres until he ends up on earth. In a Shia narrative attrbitued to Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq (700 or 702–765), Idris (Enoch) meets an angel, which the wrath of God falls upon, and his wings and hair are cut off; after Idris prays for him to God, his wings and hair are restored. In a similar story, a cherub called &quot;Fuṭrus&quot; (فطرس) was cast out from heaven and fell to the earth, but is restored after he touches al-Husayn&#x27;s cradle.

Some recent non-Islamic scholars suggest Uzair, who is according to Surah 9:30 called a &quot;son of God&quot; by Jews, originally referred to a fallen angel. While exegetes almost unanimously identified Uzair as Ezra, there is no historical evidence that the Jews called him &quot;son of God&quot;. Thus, the Quran may refer not to the earthly Ezra, but to the heavenly Ezra, identifying him with the heavenly Enoch, who in turn became identified with the angel Metatron (also called &quot;lesser YHWH&quot;) in Merkabah mysticism.

=== Iblis ===

The Quran repeatedly tells about the fall of &quot;Iblīs&quot;, whose story is referred to throughout the Quran. &quot;Iblīs&quot; refuses to bow before Adam, whereupon he is banished from heaven. In Surah 15:36, &quot;Iblīs&quot; requests God to tempt humans into sin to prove their unworthiness, and God complies. Surah 38:82 reiterates that &quot;Iblīs&#x27; &quot;intrigues to lead humans astray are permitted by God&#x27;s power. However, as mentioned in Surah 17:65, &quot;Iblīs&quot;&#x27; attempts to mislead God&#x27;s servants are destined to fail. 

The Quranic episode of &quot;Iblīs&quot; parallels the wicked angel in the earlier &quot;Books of Jubilees&quot;: Like &quot;Iblīs&quot;, Mastema requests God&#x27;s permission to tempt humanity, and both are limited in their power, that is, not able to deceive God&#x27;s servants. However, the motif of &quot;Iblīs&quot;&#x27; disobedience derives not from the Watcher mythology, but can be traced back to the Cave of Treasures, a work that probably holds the standard explanation in Proto-orthodox Christianity for the angelic fall of Satan: Satan refuses to prostrate himself before Adam, because he is &quot;fire and spirit&quot; and thereupon Satan is banished from heaven. Unlike the majority opinion in later Christianity, the idea that &quot;Iblīs&quot; attempts to usurp the throne of God is alien to Islam and due to its strict monotheism unthinkable.

According to a narration (&quot;Qaṣaṣ&quot;) by Ibn Abbas (619–687), before the creation of Adam, angels (&quot;malāʾikah&quot;) battled with the jinn. After the jinn were defeated and God (Allah) announces to create humans as a successor, the angels protest, arguing they cause corruptions as the jinn did before. &quot;Iblīs&#x27;&quot;, their leader, views humans as inferior beings, which leads to his refusal mentioned in the Quran. The story is used to complement the events in Surah 2:30-34.

=== Harut and Marut ===

Harut and Marut are a pair of angels mentioned in Surah 2:102 teaching magic. The names &quot;Harut&quot; and &quot;Marut&quot; are of Zoroastrian origin and derived from two Amesha Spentas called Haurvatat and Ameretat. Although the Quran gave these fallen angels Iranian names, recognized them as from the &quot;Book of Watchers&quot;. In accordance with 3 Enoch, al-Kalbi (737 AD – 819 AD) named three angels descending to earth, and he even gave them their Enochian names. He explained that one of them returned to heaven and the other two changed their names to Harut and Marut.

Although the Quran does not call this pair of angels &quot;fallen&quot; explicitly, the context assumes this to be true. The story bears resemblance to the Watchers, mentioned in Second Temple traditions and reflects an early Christian belief.
Unlike in the Book of Watchers and Christian tradition, the story is not about angelic revolt or original sin, but the struggle of human beings. Unlike the Watchers, Harut and Marut instruct humans to witchcraft by God&#x27;s command, just as &quot;Iblīs&quot; tempts humans only by God&#x27;s permission.

== Literature and popular culture ==

In the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; (1308–1320) by Dante Alighieri, fallen angels guard the &quot;City of Dis&quot; surrounding the lower circles of hell. They mark a transition: While in previous circles, the sinners are condemned for sins they just could not resist, later on, the circles of hell are filled with sinners who deliberately rebel against God, such as fallen angels or Christian heretics.

In John Milton&#x27;s 17th-century epic poem &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, both obedient and fallen angels play an important role. They appear as rational individuals: their personality is similar to that of humans. The fallen angels are named after entities from both Christian and Pagan mythology, such as Moloch, Chemosh, Dagon, Belial, Beelzebub and Satan himself. Following the canonical Christian narrative, Satan convinces other angels to live free from the laws of God, thereupon they are cast out of heaven. The epic poem starts with the fallen angels in hell. The first portrayal of God in the book is given by fallen angels, who describe him as a questionable tyrant and blame him for their fall. Outcast from heaven, the fallen angels establish their own kingdom in the depths of hell, with a capital called Pandæmonium. Unlike most earlier Christian representations of hell, it is not the primary place for God to torture the sinners, but the fallen angels&#x27; own kingdom. The fallen angels even build a palace, play music and freely debate. Nevertheless, without divine guidance, the fallen angels themselves turn hell into a place of suffering.

The idea of fallen angels plays a significant role in the various poems of Alfred de Vigny. In &quot;Le Déluge&quot; (1823), the son of an angel and a mortal woman learns from the stars about the great deluge. He seeks refuge with his beloved on Mount Ararat, hoping that his angelic father will save them. But since he does not appear, they are caught by the flood. &quot;Éloa&quot; (1824) is about a female angel created by the tears of Jesus. She hears about a male angel, expelled from heaven, whereupon she seeks to comfort him, but goes to perdition as a consequence.

The Turkish horror film &quot;Semum&quot; (2008), produced and directed by Hasan Karacadağ, is about a &quot;shayṭān&quot; who has been summoned from hell to torment a woman named Canan. The movie is based on the Ibn Abbas interpretation of the Quran and depicts the devil as a fallen angel who seeks revenge on humans for being abandoned by God (Allah). The devil accepts &quot;ʿAzāzīl&quot; as his new deity, who is praised as the ruler of hell and supporting his minions against God&#x27;s new creation (humans). However, at the end, the movie affirms in accordance with Islamic teachings, that &quot;ʿAzāzīl&quot; has no real power but only to seduce people to follow him. When the &quot;shayṭān&quot; battles a human priest (Hoca) in hell, it is God who intervenes on behalf of humanity while &quot;ʿAzāzīl&quot; has forsaken his servant. By that, the movie further rejects dualism in favor of Islamic tawḥīd, emphazising that even hell is under God&#x27;s control.

<doc id="387702" wikidata="Q1996696" url="?curid=387702" title="1989 Irish general election">
<text>The 1989 Irish general election to the 26th Dáil was held on Thursday, 15 June, three weeks after the dissolution of the 25th Dáil on 25 May by President Patrick Hillery, on the request of Taoiseach Charles Haughey. The general election took place in 41 Dáil constituencies throughout Ireland for 166 seats in Dáil Éireann, the house of representatives of the Oireachtas, on the same day as the European Parliament election.

The 26th Dáil met at Leinster House on 29 June to nominate the Taoiseach for appointment by the president and to approve the appointment of a new government of Ireland. No government was formed on that date, but on 12 July, Haughey was re-appointed Taoiseach, forming the 21st government of Ireland, a coalition government of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats.

==Campaign==
The general election of 1989 was precipitated by the defeat of the minority Fianna Fáil government in a private members motion regarding the provision of funds for AIDS sufferers (haemophiliacs who had been infected with contaminated blood products by the health service). While a general election was not necessary – the motion was not a vote of confidence, and therefore defeat was merely an embarrassment for the government – Charles Haughey, the Fianna Fáil leader, sought a dissolution of the Dáil.

Opinion polls had shown that the party&#x27;s strong performance in government had increased their popularity and an overall majority for Fianna Fáil could be a possibility. Also, rumours were current that the general election was called so that certain Fianna Fáil members could raise money privately for themselves. While these rumours were dismissed at the time, it was revealed more than ten years later that Ray Burke, Pádraig Flynn and Haughey himself had received substantial personal donations during the campaign.

While it was thought that the general election would catch the opposition parties unprepared, they co-ordinated themselves and co-operated very quickly. Further cuts in spending, particularly in the health service, became the dominant issue. Alan Dukes was fighting his first (and as events would prove, his only) general election as leader of Fine Gael. His Tallaght Strategy had kept Fianna Fáil in power, governing as a minority, since 1987.

The general election was held on the same day as the election to the European Parliament, and turnout was 68.5%.

==Results==




|}

Independents include Independent Fianna Fáil (6,961 votes, 1 seat), Army Wives (6,966 votes) and Gay candidates (517 votes).

No by-elections had taken place during the previous Dáil. Two seats were vacant at the dissolution of the 25th Dáil: in Sligo–Leitrim, caused by the resignation of the Fianna Fáil member Ray MacSharry, and in Dublin South-Central, caused by the death of Frank Cluskey.

While Fianna Fáil had hoped to achieve an overall majority, the party lost seats. The result was a disaster for Fianna Fáil, particularly when the election was so unnecessary. Fine Gael made a small gain, but nothing substantial. The Progressive Democrats did badly, losing over half their deputies. The Labour Party and the Workers&#x27; Party gained working-class votes from Fianna Fáil but failed to make the big breakthrough, while Sinn Féin polled worse than its 1987 result. The Green Party won its first seat when Roger Garland was elected for Dublin South.

==Government formation==
Forming a government proved to be extremely difficult. Many in Fianna Fáil had hoped that the minority government could continue where it left off, particularly if the Tallaght Strategy continued. However, Fine Gael refused to support the government and so a deadlock developed. The prospect of forming a government seemed remote, so much so that Charles Haughey was forced to formally resign as Taoiseach. For the first time in Irish history a Taoiseach and a government had not been appointed when the new Dáil met. However, twenty-seven days after the general election, Fianna Fáil entered into a coalition for the first time in its history – with the Progressive Democrats, forming the 21st Government of Ireland, led by Haughey as Taoiseach. In February 1992, Haughey resigned and was succeeded as Taoiseach by Albert Reynolds, forming the 22nd Government of Ireland, continuing in coalition with the Progressive Democrats.

==Dáil membership changes==
The following changes took place as a result of the election:
*14 outgoing TDs retired
*1 vacant seat at election time
*150 outgoing TDs stood for re-election (also Seán Treacy, the outgoing Ceann Comhairle who was automatically returned)
**124 of those were re-elected
**26 failed to be re-elected
*41 successor TDs were elected
**32 were elected for the first time
**9 had previously been TDs
*There were 4 successor female TDs, replacing 5 outgoing, thus reducing the total by 1 to 13
*There were changes in 30 of the 41 constituencies contested

Where more than one change took place in a constituency the concept of successor is an approximation for presentation only.

==Seanad election==
The Dáil election was followed by the election to the 19th Seanad.

<doc id="387703" wikidata="Q160645" url="?curid=387703" title="Orphanage">
<text>An orphanage is a residential institution, total institution or group home, devoted to the care of orphans and children who, for various reasons, cannot be cared for by their biological families. The parents may be deceased, absent, or abusive. There may be substance abuse or mental illness in the biological home, or the parent may simply be unwilling to care for the child. The legal responsibility for the support of abandoned children differs from country to country, and within countries. Government-run orphanages have been phased out in most developed countries during the latter half of the 20th century but continue to operate in many other regions internationally. It is now generally accepted that orphanages are detrimental to the emotional wellbeing of children, and government support goes instead towards supporting the family unit.

A few large international charities continue to fund orphanages, but most are still commonly founded by smaller charities and religious groups. Especially in developing countries, orphanages may prey on vulnerable families at risk of breakdown and actively recruit children to ensure continued funding. Orphanages in developing countries are rarely run by the state. However, not all orphanages that are state-run are less corrupted; the Romanian orphanages, like those in Bucharest, were founded due to the soaring population numbers catalyzed by dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu, who banned abortion and birth control and incentivized procreation in order to increase the Romanian workforce.

Today&#x27;s residential institutions for children, also described as congregate care, include group homes, residential child care communities, children&#x27;s homes, refuges, rehabilitation centers, night shelters, and youth treatment centers.

==History==
The Romans formed their first orphanages around 400 AD. Jewish law prescribed care for the widow and the orphan, and Athenian law supported all orphans of those killed in military service until the age of eighteen. Plato (&quot;Laws&quot;, 927) says: &quot;Orphans should be placed under the care of public guardians. Men should have a fear of the loneliness of orphans and of the souls of their departed parents. A man should love the unfortunate orphan of whom he is guardian as if he were his own child. He should be as careful and as diligent in the management of the orphan&#x27;s property as of his own or even more careful still.&quot; The care of orphans was referred to bishops and, during the Middle Ages, to monasteries. As soon as they were old enough, children were often given as apprentices to households to ensure their support and to learn an occupation.

In medieval Europe, care for orphans tended to reside with the Church. The Elizabethan Poor Laws were enacted at the time of the Reformation and placed public responsibility on individual parishes to care for the indigent poor.

===Foundling Hospitals===

The growth of sentimental philanthropy in the 18th century led to the establishment of the first charitable institutions that would cater to orphans.
The Foundling Hospital was founded in 1741 by the philanthropic sea captain Thomas Coram in London, England, as a children&#x27;s home for the &quot;education and maintenance of exposed and deserted young children.&quot; The first children were admitted into a temporary house located in Hatton Garden. At first, no questions were asked about child or parent, but a distinguishing token was put on each child by the parent.

On reception, children were sent to wet nurses in the countryside, where they stayed until they were about four or five years old. At sixteen, girls were generally apprenticed as servants for four years; at fourteen, boys were apprenticed into a variety of occupations, typically for seven years. There was a small benevolent fund for adults.

In 1756, the House of Commons resolved that all children offered should be received, that local receiving places should be appointed all over the country, and that the funds should be publicly guaranteed. A basket was accordingly hung outside the hospital; the maximum age for admission was raised from two months to twelve, and a flood of children poured in from country workhouses. Parliament soon came to the conclusion that the indiscriminate admission should be discontinued. The hospital adopted a system of receiving children only with considerable sums. This practice was finally stopped in 1801, and it henceforth became a fundamental rule that no money was to be received.

===19th century===
By the early nineteenth century, the problem of abandoned children in urban areas, especially London, began to reach alarming proportions. The workhouse system, instituted in 1834, although often brutal, was an attempt at the time to house orphans as well as other vulnerable people in society who could not support themselves in exchange for work. Conditions, especially for the women and children, were so bad as to cause an outcry among the social reform–minded middle-class; some of Charles Dickens&#x27; most famous novels, including &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, highlighted the plight of the vulnerable and the often abusive conditions that were prevalent in the London orphanages.

Clamour for change led to the birth of the orphanage movement. In England, the movement really took off in the mid-19th century although orphanages such as the Orphan Working Home in 1758 and the Bristol Asylum for Poor Orphan Girls in 1795, had been set up earlier. Private orphanages were founded by private benefactors; these often received royal patronage and government oversight. 
Ragged schools, founded by John Pounds and the Lord Shaftesbury were also set up to provide pauper children with basic education.

Orphanages were also set up in the United States from the early 19th century; for example, in 1806, the first private orphanage in New York (the Orphan Asylum Society, now Graham Windham) was co-founded by Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton, widow of Alexander Hamilton, one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. Under the influence of Charles Loring Brace, foster care became a popular alternative from the mid-19th century. Later, the Social Security Act of 1935 improved conditions by authorizing Aid to Families with Dependent Children as a form of social security.
A very influential philanthropist of the era was Thomas John Barnardo, the founder of the charity Barnardos. Becoming aware of the great numbers of homeless and destitute children adrift in the cities of England and encouraged by the 7th Earl of Shaftesbury and the 1st Earl Cairns, he opened the first of the &quot;Dr. Barnardo’s Homes&quot; in 1870. By his death in 1905, he had established 112 district homes, which searched for and received waifs and strays, to feed, clothe and educate them. The system under which the institution was carried on is broad as follows: the infants and younger girls and boys were chiefly &quot;boarded out&quot; in rural districts; girls above fourteen years of age were sent to the industrial training homes, to be taught useful domestic occupations; boys above seventeen years of age were first tested in labor homes and then placed in employment at home, sent to sea, or emigrated; boys of between thirteen and seventeen years of age were trained for the various trades for which they might be mentally or physically fitted.
===Deinstitutionalization===
Evidence from a variety of studies supports the vital importance of attachment security and later development of children. Deinstitutionalization of orphanages and children&#x27;s homes program in the United States began in the 1950s, after a series of scandals involving the coercion of birth parents and abuse of orphans (notably at Georgia Tann&#x27;s Tennessee Children&#x27;s Home Society). In Romania, a decree was established that aggressively promoted population growth, banning contraception and abortions for women with fewer than four children, despite the wretched poverty of most families. After Ceausescu was overthrown, he left a society unable and unwilling to take care of its children. Researchers conducted a study to see what the implications of this early childhood neglect were on development. Typically reared Romanian children showed high rates of secure attachment. Whereas the institutionally raised children showed huge rates of disorganized attachment. Many countries accepted the need to de-institutionalize the care of vulnerable children—that is, close down orphanages in favor of foster care and accelerated adoption.

Foster care operates by taking in children from their homes due to the lack of care or abuse of their parents, where orphanages take in children with no parents or children whose parents have dropped them off for a better life, typically due to income. Major charities are increasingly focusing their efforts on the re-integration of orphans in order to keep them with their parents or extended family and communities. Orphanages are no longer common in the European Community, and Romania, in particular, has struggled greatly to reduce the visibility of its children&#x27;s institutions to meet conditions of its entry into the European Union.

Some have stated it is important to understand the reasons for child abandonment, &quot;then&quot; set up targeted alternative services to support vulnerable families at risk of separation such as mother and baby units and day care centres.

==Comparison to alternatives==
Research from the Bucharest Early Intervention Project (BEIP) is often cited as demonstrating that residential institutions negatively impact the wellbeing of children. The BEIP selected orphanages in Bucharest, Romania that raised abandoned children in socially and emotionally deprived environments in order to study the changes in development of infants and children after they had been placed with specially trained foster families in the local community. This study demonstrated how the loving attention typically provided to children by their parents or caregivers is pivotal for optimal human development, specifically of the brain; adequate nutrition is not enough. Further research of children who were adopted from institutions in Eastern European countries to the US demonstrated that for every 3.5 months that an infant spent in the institution, they lagged behind their peers in growth by 1 month. Further, a meta-analysis of research on the IQs of children in orphanages found lower IQs among the children in many institutions, but this result was not found in the low-income country setting. Worldwide, residential institutions like orphanages can often be detrimental to the psychological development of affected children. In countries where orphanages are no longer in use, the long-term care of unwarded children by the state has been transitioned to a domestic environment, with an emphasis on replicating a family home. Many of these countries, such as the United States, utilize a system of monetary stipends paid to foster parents to incentivize and subsidize the care of state wards in private homes. A distinction must be made between foster care and adoption, as adoption would remove the child from the care of the state and transfer the legal responsibility for that child&#x27;s care to the adoptive parent completely and irrevocably, whereas, in the case of foster care, the child would remain a ward of the state with the foster parent acting only as a caregiver. Orphanages, especially larger ones, have had some well publicised examples of poor care. In large institutions children, but particularly babies, may not receive enough eye contact, physical contact, and stimulation to promote proper physical, social or cognitive development. In the worst cases, orphanages can be dangerous and unregulated places where children are subject to abuse and neglect. Children living in orphanages for prolonged periods get behind in development goals, and have worse mental health. Orphanage children are not included in statistics making it easy to traffic them or abuse them in other ways. There are campaigns to include orphanage children and street children in progress statistics.

===Foster care===
The benefit of foster care over orphanages is disputed. One significant study carried out by Duke University concluded that institutional care in America in the 20th century produced the same health, emotional, intellectual, mental, and physical outcomes as care by relatives, and better than care in the homes of strangers. One explanation for this is the prevalence of &quot;permanent temporary foster care&quot;. This is the name for a long string of short stays with different foster care families. Permanent temporary foster care is highly disruptive to the child and prevents the child from developing a sense of security or belonging. Placement in the home of a relative maintains and usually improves the child&#x27;s connection to family members. Experts and child advocates maintain that orphanages are expensive and often harm children&#x27;s development by separating them from their families and that it would be more effective and cheaper to aid close relatives who want to take in the orphans.

===Group homes===
Another alternative is group homes which are used for short-term placements. They may be residential treatment centers, and they frequently specialize in a particular population with psychiatric or behavioral problems, e.g., a group home for children and teens with autism, eating disorders, or substance abuse problems or child soldiers undergoing decommissioning.

===Kinship care===
Most children who live in orphanages are not orphans; four out of five children in orphanages have at least one living parent and most having some extended family. Developing countries and their governments rely on kinship care to aid in the orphan crisis because it is cheaper to financially help extended families in taking in an orphaned child than it is to institutionalize them. 

==Commercial orphanages==

While many orphanages are run as not for profit institutions, some orphanages are run as for profit ventures. This has been criticized as incentivizing against the welfare of the orphans.

Most of the children living in institutions around the world have a surviving parent or close relative, and they most commonly entered orphanages because of poverty. It is speculated that flush with money, orphanages are increasing and push for children to join even though demographic data show that even the poorest extended families usually take in children whose parents have died. Visitors to developing countries can be taken in by orphanage scams, which can include orphanages set up as a front to get foreigners to pay school fees of orphanage directors&#x27; extended families. Alternatively the children whose upkeep is being funded by foreigners may be sent to work, not to school, the exact opposite of what the donor is expecting. The worst even sell children. In Cambodia, from 2005 to 2017, the number of orphanages increased by 75%, with many of these orphanages renting children from poor families for $25/month. Families are promised that their children can get free education and food here, but what really happens is that they are used as props to garner donations. Some are also bought from their parents for very little and passed on to westerners who pay a large fee to adopt them. This also happens in China. In Nepal, orphanages can be used as a way to remove a child from their parents before placing them for adoption overseas, which is equally lucrative to the owners who receive a number of official and unofficial payments and &quot;donations&quot;. In other countries, such as Indonesia, orphanages are run as businesses, which will attract donations and make the owners rich; often the conditions orphans are kept in will deliberately be poor to attract more donations.

==Worldwide==
Developing nations are lacking in child welfare and their well-being because of a lack of resources. Research that is being collected in the developing world shows that these countries focus purely on survival indicators instead of a combination of their survival and other positive indicators like a developed nation would do.

===Europe===
The orphanages and institutions remaining in Europe tend to be in Eastern Europe and are generally state-funded.

==== Albania ====
There are estimated to be about 31,000 orphans (0–14 years old) in Albanian orphanages. (2012 statistics) In most cases they were abandoned by their parents. At 14 they are required, by law, to leave their orphanage and live on their own.
There are approximately 10 small orphanages in Albania; each one having only 12-40 children residing there. The larger ones would be state-run.

==== Bosnia and Herzegovina ====
SOS Children&#x27;s Villages giving support to 240 orphaned children.

==== Bulgaria ====
The Bulgarian government has shown interest in strengthening children&#x27;s rights.

In 2010, Bulgaria adopted a national strategic plan for the period 2010–2025 to improve the living standards of the country&#x27;s children. Bulgaria is working hard to get all institutions closed within the next few years and find alternative ways to take care of the children.

&quot;Support is sporadically given to poor families and work during daytime; correspondingly, different kinds of day centers have started up, though the quality of care in these centers is poorly measured and difficult to monitor. A smaller number of children have also been able to be relocated into foster families&quot;.

There are 7000 children living in Bulgarian orphanages wrongly classified as orphaned. Only 10 percent of these are orphans, with the rest of the children placed in orphanages for temporary periods when the family is in crisis.

==== Estonia ====
As of 2009, there are 35 different orphanages.

==== Hungary ====
A comprehensive national strategy for strengthening the rights of children was adopted by Parliament in 2007 and will run until 2032.

Child flow to orphanages has been stopped and children are now protected by social services. Violation of children&#x27;s rights leads to litigation.

==== Lithuania ====
In Lithuania there are 105 institutions. 41 percent of the institutions each have more than 60 children.
Lithuania has the highest number of orphaned children in Northern Europe.

==== Poland ====
Children&#x27;s rights enjoy relatively strong protection in Poland. Orphaned children are now protected by social services.

Social Workers&#x27; opportunities have increased by establishing more foster homes and aggressive family members can now be forced away from home, instead of replacing the child/children.

====Moldova====
More than 8800 children are being raised in state institutions, but only three percent of them are orphans.

==== Romania ====

The Romanian child welfare system is in the process of being revised and has reduced the flow of infants into orphanages.

According to Baroness Emma Nicholson, in some counties Romania now has &quot;a completely new, world class, state of the art, child health development policy.&quot; Dickensian orphanages remain in Romania, but Romania seeks to replace institutions by family care services, as children in need will be protected by social services. As of 2018, there were 17,718 children in old-style residential centers, a significant decrease from about 100,000 in 1990.

==== Serbia ====
There are many state orphanages &quot;where several thousand children are kept and which are still part of an outdated child care system&quot;. The conditions for them are bad because the government does not pay enough attention in improving the living standards for disabled children in Serbia&#x27;s orphanages and medical institutions.

==== Slovakia ====
The committee made recommendations, such as proposals for the adoption of a new &quot;national 14&quot; action plan for children for at least the next five years, and the creation of an independent institution for the protection of child rights.

==== Sweden ====
One of the first orphanages in Sweden was the &quot;Stora Barnhuset&quot; (1633-1922) in Stockholm, which remained the biggest orphanage in Sweden for centuries. In 1785, however, a reform by Gustav III of Sweden stipulated that orphans should first and foremost always be placed in foster homes when that was possible.

In Sweden, there are 5,000 children in the care of the state. None of them are currently living in an orphanage, because there is a social service law which requires that the children reside in a family home.

==== United Kingdom ====
During the Victorian era, child abandonment was rampant, and orphanages were set up to reduce infant mortality. Such places were often so full of children that nurses often administered Godfrey&#x27;s Cordial, a special concoction of opium and treacle, to soothe baby colic.

Orphaned children were placed in either prisons or the poorhouse/workhouse, as there were so few places in orphanages, or else they were left to fend for themselves on the street. Such openings in orphanages as were available could only be obtained by collecting votes for admission, placing them out of reach of poor families.

Known orphanages are:

===Sub-Saharan Africa===
==== Ethiopia ====
&quot;For example, in the Jerusalem Association Children&#x27;s Home (JACH), only 160 children remain of the 785 who were in JACH&#x27;s three orphanages.&quot; / &quot;Attitudes regarding the institutional care of children have shifted dramatically in recent years in Ethiopia. There appears to be a general recognition by MOLSA and the NGOs with which Pact is working that such care is, at best, a last resort and that serious problems arise with the social reintegration of children who grow up in institutions, and deinstitutionalization through family reunification and independent living are being emphasized.&quot;

==== Ghana ====
A 2007 survey sponsored by Africa (previously Orphan Aid Africa) and carried out by the Department of Social Welfare came up with the figure of 4,800 children in institutional care in 148 orphanages. The government is currently attempting to phase out the use of orphanages in favor of foster care placements and adoption. At least eighty-eight homes have been closed since the passage of the National Plan of Action for Orphans and Vulnerable Children. The website www.ovcghana.org details these reforms.

==== Kenya ====
A 1999 survey of 36,000 orphans found the following number in institutional care: 64 in registered institutions and 164 in unregistered institutions.

==== Malawi ====
There are about 101 orphanages in Malawi. There is a UNICEF/Government driven program on de-institutionalization, but few orphanages are yet involved in the program.

==== Rwanda ====
Out of 400,000 orphans, 5,000 are living in orphanages. The Government of Rwanda are working with Hope and Homes for Children to close the first institution and develop a model for community-based childcare which can be used across the country and ultimately Africa

==== Tanzania ====
&quot;Currently, there are 52 orphanages in Tanzania caring for about 3,000 orphans and vulnerable children.&quot; A world bank document on Tanzania showed it was six times more expensive to institutionalize a child there than to help the family become functional and support the child themselves.

==== Nigeria ====

In Nigeria, a rapid assessment of orphans and vulnerable children conducted in 2004 with UNICEF support revealed that there were about seven million orphans in 2003 and that 800,000 more orphans were added during that same year. Out of this total number, about 1.8  million are orphaned by HIV/AIDS. With the spread of HIV/AIDS, the number of orphans is expected to increase rapidly in the coming years to 8.2  million by 2010.

==== South Africa ====
Since 2000, South Africa does not license orphanages any more but they continue to be set up unregulated and potentially more harmful. Theoretically, the policy supports community-based family homes but this is not always the case. One example is the homes operated by Thokomala.

==== Zambia ====

==== Zimbabwe ====

There are 39 privately run children&#x27;s charity homes, or orphanages, in the country, and the government operates eight of its own. Privately run Orphanages can accommodate an average of 2000 children, though some are very small and located in very remote areas, hence can take in less than 150 children. 
Statistics on the total number of children in orphanages nationwide are unavailable, but caregivers say their facilities were becoming unmanageably overwhelmed almost on a daily basis. Between 1994 and 1998, the number of orphans in Zimbabwe more than doubled from 200,000 to 543,000, and in five years, the number is expected to reach 900,000. (Unfortunately, there is no room for these children.)

====Togo====
In Togo, there were an estimated 280,000 orphans under 18 years of age in 2005, 88,000 of them orphaned by AIDS. Ninety-six thousand orphans in Togo attend school.

==== Sierra Leone ====

* Children (0–17 years) orphaned by AIDS, 2005, estimate 31,000
* Children (0–17 years) orphaned due to all causes, 2005, estimate 340,000
* Orphan school attendance ratio, 1999–2005 71,000

==== Senegal ====
* Children (0–17 years) orphaned by AIDS, 2005, estimate 25,000
* Children (0–17 years) orphaned due to all causes, 2005, estimate 560,000
* Orphan school attendance ratio, 1999–2005 74,000

===South Asia===

==== Nepal ====
There are at least 602 child care homes housing 15,095 children in Nepal &quot;Orphanages have turned into a Nepalese industry there is rampant abuse and a great need for intervention.&quot; Many do not require adequate checks of their volunteers, leaving children open to abuse.

==== Afghanistan ====

&quot;At Kabul&#x27;s two main orphanages, Alauddin and Tahia Maskan, the number of children enrolled has increased almost 80 percent since last January, from 700 to over 1,200 children. Almost half of these come from families who have at least one parent, but who can&#x27;t support their children.&quot; The non-governmental organisation Mahboba&#x27;s promise assists orphans in contemporary Afghanistan. Nowadays the number of orphanages had changed. There are approximately 19 orphanages only in Kabul.

==== Bangladesh ====
&quot;There are no statistics regarding the actual number of children in welfare institutions in Bangladesh. The Department of Social Services, under the Ministry of Social Welfare, has a major program named Child Welfare and Child Development in order to provide access to food, shelter, basic education, health services and other basic opportunities for hapless children.&quot; (The following numbers mention capacity only, not actual numbers of orphans at present.)

9,500 – State institutions
250 – babies in three available &quot;baby homes&quot;
400 – Destitute Children&#x27;s Rehabilitation Centre
100 – Vocational Training Centre for Orphans and Destitute Children
1,400 -Sixty-five Welfare and Rehabilitation Programmes for Children with Disability

The private welfare institutions are mostly known as orphanages and madrassahs. The authorities of most of these orphanages put more emphasis on religion and religious studies. One example follows:
400 – Approximately – Nawab Sir Salimullah Muslim Orphanage.

==== Maldives ====
Orphans, Children (0–17 years) orphaned due to all causes, 2010, estimate 51.

==== India ====
 
India is in the top 10 and also has a very large number of orphans as well as a destitute child population. Orphanages operated by the state are generally known as juvenile homes. In addition, there is a vast number of privately run orphanages running into thousands spread across the country. These are run by various trusts, religious groups, individual citizens, citizens groups, NGO&#x27;s, etc.
While some of these places endeavor to place the children for adoption a vast majority just care and educate them till they are of legal majority age and help place them back on their feet. Prominent organizations in this field include BOYS TOWN, SOS children&#x27;s villages, etc.
There have been scandals especially with regard to adoption. Since government rules restrict funds unless there are a certain number of residents, some orphanages make sure the resident numbers remain high at the cost of adoption.

==== Pakistan ====

According to a UNICEF report in 2016, there are around 4.2 million orphaned children in Pakistan. Pakistan has had sizable economic growth from 1950 to 1999 yet they aren&#x27;t performing well in multiple social indicators like education and health, and this is mainly due to the corrupt and unstable government. Pakistan heavily relies on the nonprofit sector and zakat to finance social issues such as aid for orphans. Zakat is a financial obligation on Muslims which requires one to donate 2.5% of the family&#x27;s income to charity, and it is specifically mentioned in the Quran to take care of orphans. With the new use of zakat money from donations to investments it has a lot of potential in benefiting the development as well as the ultimate goal of poverty alleviation. The Pakistan government relies on this public sector on taking care of local issues so that they do not have the burden. Furthermore, only 6 percent of cash revenues are contributed to non-profits in Pakistan, and they are heavily favored by the government because it saves them money as non-profits are taking care of issues such as orphan care.

=== East and Southeast Asia ===

==== Taiwan ====
The number of orphanages and orphans drastically dropped from 15 institutions and 2,216 persons in 1971 to 9 institutions and 638 persons by the end of 2001.

==== Thailand ====
There are still a substantial number of NGOs and informal Orphanages in Thailand, particularly in Northern Thailand near the borders of Laos and Myanmar, e.g. around Chiang Rai. Very few of the children in these establishments are orphans, most have living parents. They attract funding from well-meaning tourists. Often protecting the children from trafficking/abuse is cited but the names and photographs of the children are published in marketing material to attract more funding. The reality is that the safest environment for these children is almost always with their parents or in their villages with familial connections where strangers are rarely seen and immediately recognized. A very few of these orphanages, go so far as to abduct or forcibly remove children from their homes, often across the border in Myanmar. The parents in local hill tribes may be encouraged to &quot;buy a place&quot; in the orphanage for vast sums, being told their child will have a better future. Some children&#x27;s homes claim to always try to repatriate children with their families, but the local managers &amp; director of the homes know of no such procedures or processes.

==== Vietnam ====
There are approximately 2 million highly vulnerable children in Vietnam with an estimated 500,000 orphaned or abandoned children. There are a number of orphanages present in the country including the Vinh Son Montagnard Orphanage, however these are generally privately funded. There are very few government run institutions.

==== South Korea ====
According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;There are now 17,000 children in public orphanages throughout the country and untold numbers at private institutions.&quot;

====Japan====
Approximately 39,000 children live in orphanages in Japan out of the 45,000 (2018 statistics) who are not able to live with their birth parents.

However, as of 2016, Japanese orphanages are severely underfunded, relying heavily on volunteer work. There are 602 foster homes across Japan, each with 30 to 100 children. A large portion of children in these orphanages are not actually orphans but victims of domestic abuse or neglect.

==== Cambodia ====
As of 2010, 11,945 children lived in 269 residential care facilities in Cambodia. About 44% were placed there by a parent.
However it is estimated that there are 553,000 orphans in the country. Most of these children are cared for by their extended family or community.

==== China ====
There are currently over 600,000 abandoned orphans living in China (some would put the figure as high as 1 million). Of these, 98% have special needs.

==== Laos ====
&quot;It is stated that there are 20,000 orphaned children in Laos.&quot; However the figure generally remains unknown as about 30% of children are never registered with the government and remain invisible. In Laos nearly 50 per cent of the population lives below the poverty line and many children are involved in child labor. There are six orphanages that are run by SOS Children&#x27;s Village that help with this problem.

=== Middle East and North Africa ===
==== Egypt ====

&quot;The [Mosques of Charity] orphanage houses about 120 children in Giza, Menoufiya and Qalyubiya.&quot;
&quot;We [Dar Al-Iwaa] provide free education and accommodation for over 200 girls and boys.&quot;
&quot;Dar Al-Mu&#x27;assassa Al-Iwaa&#x27;iya (Shelter Association), a government association affiliated with the Ministry of Social Affairs, was established in 1992. It houses about 44 children.&quot;
There are also 192 children at The Awlady, 30 at Sayeda Zeinab orphanage, and 300 at My Children Orphanage.

Note: There are about 185 orphanages in Egypt.

==== Sudan ====
There is still at least one orphanage in Sudan although the conditions there have been reported as very poor.

==== South Sudan ====
The number of orphans is expected to be 5,000 in 2023 in South Sudan. And in 2018, the UN Children Fund (UNICEF) reported that about 15,000 children in South Sudan had become separated from their families or were missing due to conflict.

==== Bahrain ====
The &quot;Royal Charity Organization&quot; is a Bahraini governmental charity organization founded in 2001 by King Hamad ibn Isa Al Khalifah to sponsor all helpless Bahraini orphans and widows. Since then almost 7,000 Bahraini families are granted monthly payments, annual school bags, and a number of university scholarships. Graduation ceremonies, various social and educational activities, and occasional contests are held each year by the organization for the benefit of orphans and widows sponsored by the organization.

==== Iraq ====
UNICEF maintains the same number at present. &quot;While the number of state homes for orphans in the whole of Iraq was 25 in 1990 (serving 1,190 children); both the number of homes and the number of beneficiaries has declined. The quality of services has also declined.&quot;

A 1999 study by UNICEF &quot;recommended the rebuilding of national capacity for the rehabilitation of orphans.&quot; The new project &quot;will benefit all the 1,190 children placed in orphanages.&quot;

==== Palestinian Territory ====
&quot;In 1999, the number of children living in orphanages witnessed a considerable drop as compared to 1998. The number dropped from 1,980 to 1,714 orphans. This is due to the policy of child re-integration in their household adopted by the Ministry of Social Affairs.&quot;

===Former Soviet Union===
In the post-Soviet countries, orphanages are better known as &quot;children&#x27;s homes&quot; (). After reaching school age, all children enroll at internats () (boarding schools).

==== Russia ====
In 2021 it was recorded that there were 406,138 orphans living in orphan homes and families in Russia. UNICEF estimates that 95% of these children are &quot;social orphans&quot;, meaning that they have at least one living parent who has given them up to the state. In 2011 Russian authorities registered 88,522 children who became orphans that year (down from 114,715 in 2009).

There are few webpages for Russian orphanages in English.
&quot;Of a total of more than 600,000 children classified as being &#x27;without parental care&#x27; (most of them live with other relatives and fosters), as many as one-third reside in institutions.&quot;

In 2011, there were 1344 institutions for orphans in Russia, including 1094 orphanages (&quot;children&#x27;s homes&quot;) and 207 special (&quot;corrective&quot;) orphanages for children with serious health issues.

==== Azerbaijan ====
It is estimated that more than 10,000 children are living in 44 orphanages. In general, &quot;many children are abandoned due to extreme poverty and harsh living conditions. Some may be raised by family members or neighbors but the majority live in crowded orphanages until the age of fifteen when they are sent into the community to make a living for themselves.&quot;

==== Belarus ====
Approximate total – 1,773 (1993 statistics for &quot;all types of orphanages&quot;)

==== Kyrgyzstan ====

Partial information: 85 – Ivanovka Orphanage

==== Tajikistan ====
There are 4 orphanages in the major cities and 64 boarding schools in Tajikistan, where 8275 children are being educated. Those four orphanages raise 185 children up to 3 years old. In total there are 160 orphans. This small number is likely due to the popularity of adopting.
==== Ukraine ====

Before the Russian invasion of 2022, there were an estimated 100,000 orphans in Ukraine&#x27;s state-run facilities. Of this number about 80 percent are described as &quot;social orphans&quot;, because the parents are either financially destitute, abusive, or addicted to drugs or alcohol and thus are unable to raise them. Due to a lack of funding and overcrowding the conditions at these orphanages are often poor, especially for disabled children.

Since 2012 the number of children adopted by foreigners has gradually been reducing. By 2016, the number of children adopted by foreigners had been reduced to around 200 from about 2,000 in 2012. A bit more than a thousand children were adopted by Ukrainians in 2016. During 2019 1,419 children were adopted. In 2020 2,047 children were adopted, in 1,890 cases the adoption was carried out by citizens of Ukraine.

===Oceania===

==== Australia ====
Orphanages in Australia mostly closed after World War II and up to the 1970s. Instead, children are mainly put in either Kinship, Residential or Foster care. Notable former orphanages include the Melbourne Orphanage and the St. John&#x27;s Orphanage in Goulburn, New South Wales.

==== Indonesia ====
No verifiable information for the number of children actually in orphanages. The number of orphaned and abandoned children is approximately 500,000.

==== Fiji ====
Orphans, children (0–17 years) orphaned due to all causes, 2005, estimate 25,000

===North America and Caribbean===

====Haiti====
Haitians and expatriate childcare professionals are careful to make it clear that Haitian orphanages and children&#x27;s homes are not orphanages in the North American sense, but instead shelters for vulnerable children, often housing children whose parent(s) are poor as well as those who are abandoned, neglected or abused by family guardians. Neither the number of children or the number of institutions is officially known, but Chambre de L&#x27;Enfance Necessiteusse Haitienne (CENH) indicated that it has received requests for assistance from nearly 200 orphanages from around the country for more than 200,000 children. Although not all are orphans, many are vulnerable or originate in vulnerable families that &quot;hoped to increase their children&#x27;s opportunities by sending them to orphanages. Catholic Relief Services provides assistance to 120 orphanages with 9,000 children in the Ouest, Sud, Sud-Est and Grand&#x27;Anse, but these include only orphanages that meet their criteria. They estimate receiving ten requests per week for assistance from additional orphanages and children&#x27;s homes, but some of these are repeat requests.&quot;

In 2007, UNICEF estimated there were 380,000 orphans in Haiti, which has a population of just over 9 million, according to the &quot;CIA World Factbook&quot;. However, since the January 2010 earthquake, the number of orphans has skyrocketed, and the living conditions for orphans have seriously deteriorated. Official numbers are hard to find due to the general state of chaos in the country.

==== Jamaica ====
A large amount of children on the island of Jamaica grow up without a parental relationship as a result of their parents&#x27; death. An example of places for these lone children to go to are SOS children&#x27;s villages, The Maxfield Park Children&#x27;s Home and the Missionaries of the Poor facilities.

==== Mexico ====
There are over 700 public and privates orphanages in Mexico which house over 30,000 children. In 2018 it was estimated that 400,000 children lacked parents. Of these 100,000 are thought to be homeless.

Some notable orphanages include:
* Casa Hogar Jeruel Orphanage in Chihuahua City, Mexico
* Casa Hogar Alegría

====United States====
While the term &quot;orphanage&quot; is no longer typically used in the United States, nearly every US state continues to operate residential group homes for children in need of a safe place to live and in which to be supported in their educational and life-skills pursuits. Homes like the Milton Hershey School in Pennsylvania, Mooseheart in Illinois and the Crossnore School and Children&#x27;s Home in North Carolina continue to provide care and support for children in need. While a place like the Milton Hershey School houses nearly 2,000 children, each child lives in a small group-home environment with &quot;house parents&quot; who often live many years in that home. Children who grow up in these residential homes have higher rates of high school and college graduation than those who spend equivalent numbers of years in the US Foster Care system, wherein only 44 to 66 percent of children graduate from high school.

Some private orphanages still exist in the United States apart from governmental child protective services processes. Following World War II, most orphanages in the U.S. began closing or converting to boarding schools or different kinds of group homes. Also, the term &quot;children&#x27;s home&quot; became more common for those still existing. Over the past few decades, orphanages in the U.S. have been replaced with smaller institutions that try to provide a group home or boarding school environment. Most children who would have been in orphanages are in these residential treatment centers (RTC), residential child care communities, or with foster families. Adopting from RTCs, group homes, or foster families does not require working with an adoption agency, and in many areas, fostering to adopt is highly encouraged.

===Central and South America===
====Guatemala====
&quot;...currently there are about 200,000 children in orphanages.&quot;

====Peru====
It is estimated that 550,000 children grow up without parents in Peru. Many of the children in orphanages are considered “social orphans”. 
== Significant charities that help orphans ==
Prior to the establishment of state care for orphans in First World countries, private charities existed to take care of destitute orphans, over time other charities have found other ways to care for children.
* The Orphaned Starfish Foundation is a non-profit organisation based in New York City that focuses on developing vocational schools for orphans, victims of abuse and at-risk youth. It runs fifty computer centers in twenty-five countries, serving over 10,000 children worldwide 
* Lumos works to replace institutions with community-based services that provide children with access to health, education, and social care tailored to their individual needs.
* Hope and Homes for Children are working with governments to deinstitutionalize their child care systems.
* Stockwell Home and later Birchington, started by Charles H Spurgeon, is now Spurgeons after the last orphanage closed in 1979. Spurgeons Children&#x27;s Charity provides support to vulnerable and disadvantaged children and families across England. 
* SOS Children&#x27;s Villages is the world&#x27;s largest non-governmental, non-denominational child welfare organization that provides loving family homes for orphaned and abandoned children.
* Dr. Barnardo&#x27;s Homes are now simply Barnardo&#x27;s after closing their last orphanage in 1989.
* OAfrica, previously OrphanAid Africa, has been working in Ghana since 2002, to get children out of orphanages and into families, in partnership with the government and as the only private implementing partner of the National Plan of Action.
* Joint Council on International Children&#x27;s Services is a nonprofit child advocacy organization based in Alexandria, Virginia. It is the largest association of international adoption agencies in America, and in addition to working in 51 countries, advocates for ethical practices in American adoption agencies

<text>North Woolwich is an area in the London Borough of Newham in East London, England, on the northern bank of the River Thames, across the river from Woolwich. It is connected to Woolwich by the Woolwich Ferry and Woolwich foot tunnel.

Despite lying on the northern, Essex, side of the Thames, the area was within the historic county of Kent. It was part of the parish of Woolwich in the Blackheath hundred, but since 1965 has been in Greater London. Its position within Kent was an arrangement most likely imposed in the aftermath of the Norman Conquest of England from 1066.

==History==
===Toponymy===
The placename North Woolwich was probably taken from North Woolwich railway station which opened in 1847 and closed in 2006; before that, the area was referred to by terms such as &quot;Woolwich in Essex&quot;, &quot;Kent in Essex&quot; and &quot;detached Woolwich&quot;.

===Local government===

The area now called North Woolwich was originally in the eastern part of the Manor of Ham, in the Becontree hundred of Essex; a territory that was subsequently divided into the more familiar West and East Ham, sometime in the 12th century. North Woolwich appears to have been separated a century or so before that time, following the Norman conquest.

Having defeated the English, William the Conqueror rewarded his followers and consolidated his rule, by dividing the lands of his new Kingdom between them. Amongst the foremost of these was Hamo, Steward to the king and Sheriff of Kent, who was given manors in Essex, Kent and Surrey.

The Domesday Book of 1086 shows Hamo as holding land on both sides of the river as part of the manor of Woolwich. The widely-held view is that the upheaval of the conquest gave Hamo an opportunity to attach some of his land in Essex to his manor of Woolwich and by extension to his Sheriffdom of Kent. In so doing he became both lord of the manor and Sheriff on both sides of the ferry crossing, an arrangement that allowed him to more effectively tax the revenues of the ferry. This enhanced control of the crossing may also have given him personal military and political advantages.

The parish of Woolwich developed from the manor, and administered North Woolwich until 1889 when it was replaced by the Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich and made part of the new County of London. The neighbouring areas&#x27; local authorities of East Ham, West Ham and Barking, while also heavily urbanised, were excluded from the new London authority to remain in Essex; and so North Woolwich remained an anomaly at county level.

Local administration changed again in 1965, with the creation of the London Borough of Newham as part of a new Greater London area. North Woolwich joined West Ham, East Ham and other areas between the rivers Lea, Thames and Roding to form an authority which effectively reestablished the old area of Ham.

The administrative association with Woolwich ended at that time, and Woolwich itself became part of a new London Borough of Greenwich, whereas North Woolwich became part of the London Borough of Newham.

===Urban development===
It appears that a hamlet in the area was destroyed by medieval floods and the area remained uninhabited from that time until the 19th century.

The area was formerly the site of industries including the cable works of W. T. Henley (later Associated Electrical Industries) and the Western Electric Company (later Standard Telephones and Cables) on the river to the west of the ferry, and a large Harland &amp; Wolff ship building and repair shop at Gallions Point to the south of the King George V Dock entrance lock (not to be confused with their works at the western end of the dock). Often on the day of launch of a new ship, the company would invite children from the local primary school (Storey Street, now closed) to witness the event.

The population peaked just before the First World War, and reduced substantially in the Second World War when it was heavily bombed.

In the last decade, North Woolwich has seen major redevelopment as part of wider urban regeneration across the Royal Docks, including the ongoing redevelopment of the former North Woolwich railway station site to provide 348 homes, as well as 75 new homes at Woolwich Reach and 163 apartments at Stories Wharf, in the vicinity of the Woolwich ferry terminal.

==Geography==
Unlike many areas of London, North Woolwich had formally-defined boundaries by which it comprised two separate tracts of riverside land. The smaller and more westerly part, containing , extended west for about from North Woolwich station. The larger detached part, further fragmented by dock facilities, extended east from the Royal Victoria Gardens. However as in many areas of London, informal local definitions of districts are more nuanced

Most of Pier Road and the Royal Victoria Gardens, as well as King George V DLR station, are, strictly speaking, in a finger of East Ham surrounded by North Woolwich. However, as is so often the case in London, formal boundaries have not proved the deciding factor in defining local areas, and this part of East Ham has also long been regarded as being part of North Woolwich.

Conversely, the area of the eastern part that lies north of the docks – an area of employment land, infrastructure facilities and post-industrial dereliction, with very few residents – is more usually seen as being part of Beckton, an area that has never had any formal definition.

In summary, the area now commonly considered as North Woolwich differs markedly from the two areas which formerly had the association with Woolwich, covering a smaller area but with a higher population. It could now be said to consist of the area to the south of King George V Dock and Lock, east of the boundary with the Silvertown area of West Ham.

The nearest Docklands Light Railway station is King George V.

==Transport==
The King George V DLR station is North Woolwich&#x27;s principal public transport asset, offering direct links to the City, Canary Wharf (via Poplar), Stratford and Woolwich.

The extension of the Docklands Light Railway to the area opened in December 2005. Until 2009, this terminated at King George V; a further extension under the river to Woolwich Arsenal opened in 2009.

The disused North Woolwich railway station, which was closed in preparation for future transport developments which will use sections of the line, is situated adjacent to the ferry terminal. This situation means that North Woolwich now sports two old station buildings. The closed North London Line station is adjacent to an earlier station which closed in 1979; this housed the Old Station Museum from 1984 until it closed in 2008, which was devoted to the history of the Great Eastern and London and North Eastern railways.

North Woolwich is also linked to Woolwich, to its south, by the Woolwich Free Ferry (which connects the North Circular and South Circular roads) and the Woolwich foot tunnel.

<text>The 1987 Irish general election to the 25th Dáil was held on Tuesday, 17 February, four weeks after the dissolution of the 24th Dáil on 20 January by President Patrick Hillery, on the request of Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald. A continuing crisis over public finance and a rejection of the budget had led to the Labour Party withdrawing from the Fine Gael–led coalition government. The general election took place in 41 Dáil constituencies throughout Ireland for 166 seats in Dáil Éireann, the house of representatives of the Oireachtas. There were minor amendments to constituency boundaries under the Electoral (Amendment) Act 1983.

The 25th Dáil met at Leinster House on 10 March to nominate the Taoiseach for appointment by the president and to approve the appointment of a new government of Ireland. Charles Haughey was appointed Taoiseach, forming the 20th government of Ireland, a minority single-party Fianna Fáil government.

==Campaign==
The 1987 general election was precipitated by the withdrawal of the Labour Party from the Fine Gael–led government on 20 January 1987. The reason was a disagreement over budget proposals. Rather than attempt to press on with the government&#x27;s agenda, the Taoiseach and leader of Fine Gael, Garret FitzGerald, sought a dissolution of the Dáil. An unusually long period of four weeks was set for the campaign.

Fianna Fáil&#x27;s campaign involved a refusal to make any definite commitments; however, it attempted to convince the electorate that the country would be better under Fianna Fáil. Charles Haughey&#x27;s attitudes toward Northern Ireland and the Anglo-Irish Agreement were both attacked. However, the campaign was mostly fought on economic issues.

The Labour Party decided against any pre-election pact, particularly with Fine Gael. The Progressive Democrats (PD), founded only two years earlier, surpassed Labour as the third-biggest political party in the Dáil. Although the majority of the PD party consisted of Fianna Fáil defectors, it mainly took seats from Fine Gael.

==Results==




|}
;Notes:
* Independents include Independent Fianna Fáil (7,720 votes, 1 seat) and the Tax Reform League (3,832 votes).
* Changes in numbers of seats for each party are shown relative to the previous election in November 1982.

Although opinion polls had suggested otherwise, Fianna Fáil once again failed to win an overall majority. The Progressive Democrats did exceptionally well in their first general election, becoming the third-biggest party in the Dáil. Fine Gael lost many seats, mostly to the PDs. The Labour Party fell to its lowest share of the vote since 1933, but managed to salvage 12 seats, more than expected, including that of its leader Dick Spring, who saved his seat by just four votes.

===Voting summary===
===Seats summary===
==Government formation==
Fianna Fáil formed the 20th government of Ireland, a minority government, with Charles Haughey returning as Taoiseach. Haughey was nominated as Taoiseach with the votes of his own party, the support of Independent Fianna Fáil TD Neil Blaney and the abstention of Independent TD Tony Gregory. That left him with just half of votes cast. Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy exercised his casting vote in favour of the nomination of Haughey. The Fianna Fáil government of 1987 to 1989 was the last time to date that a government composed only of members of one party has been formed in Ireland.

== Dáil membership changes ==
The following changes took place at the election:
* 17 outgoing TDs retired
* 1 vacant seat at election time
* 147 outgoing TDs stood for re-election (also Tom Fitzpatrick, the outgoing Ceann Comhairle, who was automatically returned)
** 127 of those were re-elected
** 20 failed to be re-elected
* 38 successor TDs were elected
** 32 were elected for the first time
** 6 had previously been TDs
* There were 6 successor female TDs, with the total remaining unchanged at 14
* There were changes in 32 of the 41 constituencies contested

Where more than one change took place in a constituency, the concept of successor is an approximation for presentation only.
==Seanad election==
The Dáil election was followed by an election to the 18th Seanad.

<doc id="387717" wikidata="Q82190" url="?curid=387717" title="The Eagle and Child">
<text>The Eagle and Child, nicknamed &quot;the Bird and Baby&quot;, is a pub in St Giles&#x27;, Oxford, England, owned by the Ellison Institute of Technology and previously operated by Mitchells &amp; Butlers as a Nicholson&#x27;s pub. The pub had been part of an endowment belonging to University College since the 17th century. It has associations with the Inklings writers&#x27; group which included J. R. R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis. In 2005, 25 other pubs in the United Kingdom had the same name.

==History==
The first record of the pub&#x27;s name is from 1684, and is variously said to derive from the legend of Ganymede being abducted by the eagle of Zeus, or from the crest of the Earl of Derby, with a story of a noble-born baby found in an eagle&#x27;s nest. The child was called Oskatel and was found by Sir Thomas Lathom, who became father-in-law to Sir John Stanley. The pub&#x27;s long-standing nickname is the &quot;Bird and Baby&quot;.

The pub had been part of an endowment belonging to University College since the 17th century. The college placed it on the market for £1.2 million in December 2003, saying that it needed to rebalance its property portfolio. It was bought by the nearby St John&#x27;s College, which also owns the Lamb and Flag pub opposite. The Eagle and Child is a Grade II listed building.

The pub has remained closed since March 2020 in the early part of the COVID-19 pandemic. Planning permission has been granted to sympathetically refurbish it, with the upper floors being converted to hotel accommodation, along with the upper floors of two adjacent properties, the ground floor of the adjacent property serving as the hotel reception and the addition of a restaurant to the rear of the property. The planned changes will not affect the appearance of front of the pub, including the Rabbit Room. The business is currently owned by the Ellison Institute of Technology, who plan to reopen it as a pub, with the upper floors converted to meeting rooms.

==Literary connections==
The Inklings were an Oxford writers&#x27; group which included C. S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien, Charles Williams, Owen Barfield, and Hugo Dyson. From late 1933, they met on Thursday evenings at Lewis&#x27;s college rooms at Magdalen, where they would read and discuss various material, including their unfinished manuscripts. These meetings were accompanied with more informal lunchtime gatherings at various Oxford pubs, and coalesced into a regular meeting held on Monday or Tuesday lunchtimes at The Eagle and Child, in a private lounge at the back of the pub called the &quot;Rabbit Room&quot;.

The formal Thursday meetings ended in October 1949 when interest in the readings petered out, but the meetings at the Eagle and Child continued, and it was at one of those meetings in June 1950 that C.S. Lewis distributed the proofs for &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;.

The membership of the Inklings changed over the years. Tolkien, for example, drifted away from the meetings in the late 1950s, whereas Lewis, who had lived around Oxford since 1921, was a central figure until his death in 1963. When The Eagle and Child was modernised in 1962, with the pub being extended to the rear, the Rabbit Room&#x27;s former privacy was inevitably destroyed; the group reluctantly changed its allegiance to the Lamb &amp; Flag on the other side of St Giles&#x27;. The meetings in the Lamb &amp; Flag were soon abandoned after Lewis&#x27;s death.

== In popular culture ==

The Eagle and Child featured in Colin Dexter&#x27;s novel &quot;The Secret of Annexe 3&quot;, in which Inspector Morse and Sergeant Lewis read the wooden plaque to the Inklings in the pub&#x27;s back bar. It was also used as a location in the television series &quot;Inspector Morse&quot; in the 1991 episode &quot;Second Time Around&quot;, in which it was dressed up as &quot;Shears Wine Bar&quot;.

The pub is the meeting place of the main characters and a 1906 suffragette planning session in Pip Williams&#x27; best-selling 2020 debut novel &quot;The Dictionary of Lost Words&quot;.

The pub is mentioned in Episode 7 of Season 1 of the Netflix series &quot;3 Body Problem&quot;.&#x27;

<doc id="387719" wikidata="Q2579987" url="?curid=387719" title="Music of Portugal">
<text>Portuguese music includes many different styles and genres, as a result of its history. These can be broadly divided into classical music, traditional/folk music and popular music and all of them have produced internationally successful acts, with the country seeing a recent expansion in musical styles, especially in popular music.

In traditional/folk music, fado had a significant impact, with Amália Rodrigues still the most recognizable Portuguese name in music, and with more recent acts, like Dulce Pontes and Mariza. The genre is one of two Portuguese music traditions in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists, with the other being Cante Alentejano. Regional folk music remains popular too, having been updated and modernized in many cases, especially in the northeastern region of Trás-os-Montes. Some more recent successful fado/folk-inspired acts include Madredeus and Deolinda, the latter being part of a folk revival that has led to a newfound interest in this type of music.
In popular music, there is a significant number of popular genres. These include rock, with popular acts including Xutos &amp; Pontapés, The Gift (alternative rock), Fingertips (pop rock), Blasted Mechanism (experimental electro-rock), Noctivagus (gothic rock) and Wraygunn (rock, blues). Also hip-hop, with acts such as Boss AC, Da Weasel, Ithaka, Mind Da Gap and Sam the Kid. Acts such as Moonspell and Heavenwood (metal) and Buraka Som Sistema (electro/kuduro/breakbeat) have had significant international success. Other popular modern genres in Portugal include dance, house, kizomba, pimba, pop, reggae, ska and zouk.

==History==

Portugal has had a history of receiving different musical influences from around the Mediterranean Sea, across Europe and former colonies.
In the two centuries before the Christian era, Ancient Rome brought with it Greek influences; early Christians, who had their differing versions of church music arrived during the height of the Roman Empire; the Visigoths, a Romanized Germanic people, who took control of the Iberian Peninsula following the fall of the Roman Empire; the Moors and Jews in the Middle Ages. Hence, there have been more than two thousand years of internal and external influences and developments. Its genres range from classical to popular music. Portugal&#x27;s music history includes musical history from the medieval Gregorian chants through Carlos Seixas&#x27; symphonies era to the composers of the modern era. The musical history of Portugal can be divided in different ways. Portuguese music encompasses musical production of the Middle Ages, Renaissance, Baroque, Classical, Romantic and Modern eras, especially from Angola with Kizomba. Portugal has very good dancing clothes making Portuguese dancing famous.

==Classical music==
Portuguese music gets its rich history from its privileged geographical location. These are evidenced in the music history of Portugal, which despite its firm European roots, nevertheless reflects the intercontinental cultural interactions begun in the Portuguese discoveries.

A short list of past and present Portuguese musicians with important contributions must necessarily include the names of composers Manuel Cardoso, Duarte Lobo, Filipe de Magalhães, Carlos Seixas, Pedro de Escobar, Diogo Dias Melgás, João Domingos Bomtempo, Marcos Portugal, José Vianna da Motta, Luís de Freitas Branco, António Fragoso, Joly Braga Santos, Fernando Lopes-Graça, and Emmanuel Nunes; organists such as António Carreira and Manuel Rodrigues Coelho; singers Luísa Todi, Elisabete Matos and José Carlos Xavier; pianists Maria João Pires and Sequeira Costa; violinists Elmar Oliveira and Carlos Damas; and cellists such as Guilhermina Suggia.

==Traditional music==

===Fado===

Fado is a musical style, which arose in Lisbon as the music of the urban poor. Fado songs are typically lyrically harsh, accompanied by a wire-strung acoustic guitar or the Portuguese Guitar. It is usually sung by solo performers, with the singer resigned to sadness, poverty, and loneliness, but remaining dignified and firmly controlled. It is claimed that fado&#x27;s origins are older, going back to the 15th century, when women cried with longing for their husbands that sailed to the never-ending seas.

Late in the 19th century, the city of Coimbra developed a distinctive scene. Coimbra, a literary capital for the country, is now known for being more refined and majestic. The sound has been described as &quot;the song of those who retain and cherish their illusions, not of those who have irretrievably lost them&quot; by Rodney Gallop in 1936. A related form is the guitarradas of the 1920s and 30s, best known for Dr. Antonio Menano and a group of virtuoso musicians he formed, including Artur Paredes and José Joaquim Cavalheiro. Student fado, performed by students at Coimbra University, has maintained a tradition since it was pioneered in the 1890s by Augusto Hilário.

Starting in 1939 with the career of Amália Rodrigues, fado was an internationally popular genre. A singer and film actress, Rodrigues made numerous stylistic innovations that have made her probably the most influential fadista of all time.

A new generation of young musicians have contributed to the social and political revival of fado music, adapting and blending it with new trends. Contemporary fado musicians like Carminho, Mariza, Mísia and Camané have introduced the music to a new public. The sensuality of Misia and other female &quot;fadistas&quot; (fado singers) like Maria Ana Bobone, Cuca Roseta, Cristina Branco, Ana Moura, Katia Guerreiro, and Mariza has walked the fine line between carrying on the tradition of Amália Rodrigues and trying to bring in a new audience. Mísia and Carlos do Carmo are also well-known fado singers.Ricardo Ribeiro and Miguel Capucho are one of the best male fado singers of the new generation.

It was included in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists in 2011.

===Regional folk music===
Recent events have helped keep Portuguese regional folk (&quot;rancho folclórico&quot;) traditions alive, most especially including the worldwide roots revival of the 1960s and 70s.

Cante Alentejano, from the Alentejo region, was included in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists in 2014.

The people of the Azores islands maintain some distinct musical traditions, such as the traditionally fiddle-driven &quot;chamarrita&quot; dance.

Music in Madeira is widespread and mainly uses local musical instruments such as the Machete, rajao, Brinquinho and Cavaquinho, which are used in traditional Folklore dances like the Bailinho da Madeira. One of the island&#x27;s most celebrated folklorists was Maria Ascensão (1926–2001). Famous performers of contemporary music include Max, Luís Jardim and Vânia Fernandes.

Trás-os-Montes&#x27; musical heritage is closely related to the traditional music of Galicia, Cantabria and Asturias. Traditional bagpipes (&quot;gaita-de-fole transmontana&quot;), a cappella vocals and a unique musical scale with equal semitones have kept alive a vital tradition. (&quot;Miranda de I Douro&quot;), some artists such as Galamdum Galundaina sing in Mirandese language. Also, the Pauliteiros folk dance is popular. Some residents sing in both Portuguese and Mirandese.

===Latin===
Although it is an Iberian country, Portugal never had clear influences from Latin America, though Portuguese musical traditions have had an influence on Latin American music, particularly in Brazil and through instruments such as the cavaquinho and its descendent instruments like the cuatro. Nonetheless, the Latin music industry sometimes includes music sung in Portuguese from Portugal. This style came to the country in the 1990s, following a Spanish and world trend. Examples of Latin music singers in Portuguese are Ana Malhoa and Mil i Maria. The Latin Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences, the organization responsible for the Latin Grammy Awards, encompasses music from Portugal and has voting members who live in the country. Carlos do Carmo became the first Portuguese artist to win a Latin Grammy award upon receiving the Lifetime Achievement Award.

===Pimba===

Pimba music is the Portuguese version of the euro Schlager or the Balkan Turbo-Folk. It is named after the 1995 hit &quot;Pimba Pimba&quot;, by Emanuel. Some of its biggest names are Emanuel, Ágata, Suzana, Micaela, Ruth Marlene and Quim Barreiros. This genre mixes traditional sounds with accordion, Latin beats and funny or religious (mainly &quot;kitch&quot;) lyrics.

===Folk and political (&quot;Música de Intervenção&quot;)===

During the Estado Novo authoritarian regime, music was widely used by the left-wing resistance as a way to say what could not be said, singing about freedom, equality, and democracy, mainly through metaphors and symbols. Many composers and singers became famous and persecuted by the political police, some of them being arrested or exiled, such as José Afonso, Paulo de Carvalho, José Mário Branco, Sérgio Godinho, Adriano Correia de Oliveira, Manuel Freire, Pedro Barroso, Fausto, Vitorino, Júlio Pereira and some others. Their music was (and remains) mostly based on Portuguese folk music and elements of European-style singer-songwriter genres.

José Afonso began performing in the 1950s; he was a popular roots-based musician that led the Portuguese roots revival. With artists like Sérgio Godinho and Luís Cília, Afonso helped form nova canção music, which, after the 1974 revolution, gained socially-aware lyrics and became canto livre. The biggest names in canto livre were Banda do Casaco and Brigada Víctor Jara, groups that seriously studied and were influenced by Portuguese regional music. The poet-singer-songwriter was also a significant contributor to the modern romance genre, can be compared to Leonard Cohen.

After the Carnation Revolution, that same music was used to support left-wing parties. Political ideas and causes, like the agrarian reform, socialism, equality, democratic elections, free education and many other were a constant presence in these songs lyrics, often written by well-known poets like José Barata-Moura, Manuel Alegre or Ary dos Santos.

===Reggae and ska===
More underground but very prominent are Portuguese reggae and ska. Unregarding some 2 Tone and reggae-influenced singles in the late 70s by bands like Roquivários or early 80s mod outfit Táxi, it was only in the early 1990s when the first Portuguese roots reggae band, Kussondulola reached the mainstream public.

Best known Portuguese reggae singers include Richie Campbell, Mercado Negro, Prince Wadada and Freddy Locks, while some of the more famous bands of these types include Terrakota, Primitive Reason, Sativa, One Sun Tribe, One Love Family, Arsha, Three and a Quarter, Purocracy, Chapa Dux and Souls of Fire. This music is popular among young people, with its main roots based in Lisbon and the surrounding areas.

Earlier ska bands in Portugal included Despe&amp;Siga and Contratempos, while The Ratazanas can be considered the best known Portuguese Early reggae and Rocksteady band. They recorded for German label Grover Records and toured throughout Europe on their own right as well as backing Jamaican singers like Susan Cadogan. Skarmiento, Skalibans, and Skamioneta do Lixo are other Portuguese ska bands.

===Rock===
Portuguese rock was born in the 1980s, with acts like Rui Veloso and Jorge Palma.
Examples of popular Portuguese rock bands, having a long history, are Xutos &amp; Pontapés and UHF who have been playing for over 30 years and are known widely throughout Portugal, as well as Mão Morta, a unique and controversial Portuguese band with decades-long activity. Well known solo singers include Rui Veloso, Jorge Palma, and Pedro Abrunhosa. Clã (pop rock), Grupo Novo Rock (pop rock and rock), Fingertips, (pop rock), Blasted Mechanism (electro-rock and dub/reggae fusion), Suspiria Franklyn (punk-rock/new wave), Linda Martini (post/noise rock), peixe : aviao (post-rock), Ornatos Violeta (indie rock), A Book in the Shelf (grunge rock), Dream Circus (grunge rock), Decreto 77, (punk rock), or Mazgani (alternative), are other important acts.

The indie and alternative rock movements are also popular in Portugal. Some indie and alternative bands and artists from Portugal are Os Pontos Negros, Memória de Peixe, Linda Martini, The Glockenwise, Capitão Fausto, Frankie Chavez, Stereoboy, Quelle Dead Gazelle, B Fachada, Noiserv, Golden Slumbers (band) as well as the Luso-Brazilian group Banda do Mar.

===Romantic===
The highest exponents of this kind of music in Portugal are Tony Carreira and Marco Paulo (both, and even other performers, have a certain level of overlap with the Pimba genre, even partial or just in certain songs).

==Singers of Portuguese descent==
There are several popular musicians of Portuguese descent. Luso-francofonic artists include Linda de Suza (Portuguese born and later an immigrant in France) and Marie Myriam, winner of the Eurovision Song Contest in 1977. Nelly Furtado reflected some of her Portuguese origins, especially in lesser-known songs in her first albums (songs like &quot;Scared&quot; sung by Furtado in English and Portuguese, &quot;Nas Horas do Dia&quot; and &quot;Força&quot;). Portugal-born Nuno Bettencourt&#x27;s heritage is also reflected in the title of Extreme&#x27;s 2008 album &quot;Saudades de Rock&quot;. Steve Perry, former lead singer of rock group Journey is American of Portuguese ancestry, as is Aerosmith&#x27;s Joe Perry (both their original paternal family names being Pereira). The lead singer from Jamiroquai, Jay Kay has Portuguese descent through his father. Ana da Silva, a founding member of the cult post-punk band The Raincoats is also of Portuguese origin. Also Mia Rose, which has collaborations with Portuguese artists and even songs in the Portuguese language, was a juror at The Voice Portugal. Others include Katy Perry, Shawn Mendes, Mishlawi and DEV and Carlos Melo.

<text>Foster care is a system in which a minor has been placed into a ward, group home (residential child care community or treatment centre), or private home of a state-certified caregiver, referred to as a &quot;foster parent&quot;, or with a family member approved by the state. The placement of a &quot;foster child&quot; is normally arranged through the government or a social service agency. The institution, group home, or foster parent is compensated for expenses unless with a family member. 

The state, via the family court and child protective services agency, stand &quot;in loco parentis&quot; to the minor, making all legal decisions while the foster parent is responsible for the day-to-day care of the minor.

Scholars and activists have expressed concerns about the efficacy of foster care services provided by non-government organisations. Specifically, this pertains to poor retention rates of social workers. Poor retention rates are attributed to being overworked in an emotionally draining field that offers minimal monetary compensation. The lack of professionals pursuing a degree in social work coupled with poor retention rates in the field has led to a shortage of social workers and created large caseloads for those who choose to work and stay in the field. The efficacy of caseworker retention also affects the overall ability to care for clients. Low staffing leads to data limitations that infringe on caseworkers&#x27; ability to adequately serve clients and their families.

Foster care is correlated with a range of negative outcomes compared to the general population. Children in foster care have a high rate of ill health, particularly psychiatric conditions such as anxiety, depression, and eating disorders. One third of foster children in a US study reported abuse from a foster parent or other adult in the foster home. Nearly half of foster children in the US become homeless when they reach the age of 18, and the poverty rate is three times higher among foster care alumni than in the general population.

==By country==

===Australia===

In Australia foster care was known as &quot;boarding-out&quot;. Foster care had its early stages in South Australia in 1867 and stretched to the second half of the 19th century. It is said that the system was mostly run by women until the early 20th century. Then the control was centered in many state children&#x27;s departments. &quot;Although boarding-out was also implemented by non-government[al] child rescue organizations, many large institutions remained. These institutions assumed an increasing importance from the late 1920s when the system went into decline.&quot; The system was re-energized in the postwar era, and in the 1970s. The system is still the main structure for &quot;out-of-home care&quot;. The system took care of both local and foreign children. &quot;The first adoption legislation was passed in Western Australia in 1896, but the remaining states did not act until the 1920s, introducing the beginnings of the closed adoption that reached it peak in the period 1940–1975. New baby adoption dropped dramatically from the mid-1970s, with the greater tolerance of and support for single mothers&quot;.

===Cambodia===
Foster care in Cambodia is relatively new as an official practice within the government. However, despite a later start, the practice is currently making great strides within the country. Left with a large number of official and unofficial orphanages from the 1990s, the Cambodian government conducted several research projects in 2006 and 2008, pointing to the overuse of orphanages as a solution for caring for vulnerable children within the country. Most notably, the studies found that the percentage of children within orphanages that had parents approached 80%. At the same time, local NGOs like &quot;Children In Families&quot; began offering limited foster care services within the country. In the subsequent years, the Cambodian government began implementing policies that required the closure of some orphanages and the implementation of minimum standards for residential care institutions. These actions lead to an increase in the number of NGOs providing foster care placements and helped to set the course for care reform around the country. As of 2015, the Cambodian government is working with UNICEF, USAID, several governments, and many local NGOs in continuing to build the capacity for child protection and foster care within the Kingdom.

===Canada===
Foster children in Canada are known as permanent wards (crown wards in Ontario). A ward is someone, in this case a child, placed under protection of a legal guardian and are the legal responsibility of the government. Census data from 2011 counted children in foster care for the first time, counting 47,885 children in care. The majority of foster children – 29,590, or about 62 per cent – were aged 14 and under. The wards remain under the care of the government until they &quot;age out of care&quot;. All ties are severed from the government and there is no longer any legal responsibility toward the youth. This age is different depending on the province.

===Israel===

In December 2013, the Israeli Knesset approved a bill co-drafted by the Israel National Council for the Child to regulate the rights and obligations of participants in the foster care system in Israel.

===Japan===
The idea of foster care or taking in abandoned children actually came about around 1392–1490s in Japan. The foster care system in Japan is similar to the Orphan Trains because Brace thought the children would be better off on farms. The people in Japan thought the children would do better on farms rather than living in the &quot;dusty city&quot;. The families would often send their children to a farm family outside the village and only keep their oldest son. The farm families served as the foster parents and they were financially rewarded for taking in the younger siblings. &quot;It was considered an honor to be chosen as foster parents, and selection greatly depended on the family&#x27;s reputation and status within the village&quot;. Around 1895 the foster care program became more like the system used in the United States because the Tokyo Metropolitan Police sent children to a hospital where they would be &quot;settled&quot;. Problems emerged in this system, such as child abuse, so the government started phasing it out and &quot;began increasing institutional facilities&quot;. In 1948 the Child Welfare Law was passed, increasing official oversight, and creating better conditions for the children to grow up in.

===United Kingdom===

In the United Kingdom, foster care and adoption has always been an option, &quot;in the sense of taking other people&#x27;s children into their homes and looking after them on a permanent or temporary basis.&quot; However, nothing about it had a legal foundation until the 20th century. The UK had &quot;wardship&quot;, the family taking in the child had custody by the Chancery Court. Wardship was not used very often because it did not give the guardian &quot;parental rights&quot;. In the 19th century came a &quot;series of baby farming scandals&quot;. At the end of the 19th century they started calling it &quot;boarding-out&quot; like they did in Australia. They started placing the children in orphanages and workhouses as well. &quot;The First World War saw an increase in organized adoption through adoption societies and child rescue organizations, and pressure grew for adoption to be given legal status.&quot; The first laws based on adoption and foster care were passed in 1926. &quot;The peak number of adoptions was in 1968, since then there has been an enormous decline in adoption in the United Kingdom. The main reasons for children being adopted in the United Kingdom had been unmarried mothers giving up their children for adoption and stepparents adopting their new partner&#x27;s children&quot;.

===United States===

In the United States, foster care started as a result of the efforts of Charles Loring Brace, who founded the Children&#x27;s Aid Society. Taking note that nearly 30,000 homeless or neglected children lived in New York City alone, Brace took these children off the streets and placed them with families around the United States, particularly Christian families living on farms, in an attempt to improve their quality of life. Between 1853 and his death in 1890, Brace transported over 120,000 children by train, giving name to the Orphan Train Movement. When Brace died in 1890, his sons took over his work of the Children&#x27;s Aid Society until they retired. The foster care approach pioneered by Brace and the Children&#x27;s Aid Society became the basis for Concurrent Planning, which was the basis of the federal Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997.

From August 1999 to August 2019, 9,073,607 American children have been removed from their families and placed in foster homes according to the federal government Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System.

As last reported in August 2022, 368,530 children nationally were removed from their families and placed in foster homes according to the federal government Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System.

- 22% of foster children are between the ages of 0 and 2

- 18% of foster children are between the ages of 3 and 5

- 30% of foster children are between the ages of 6 and 12

- 28% of foster children are between the ages of 13 and 21

- Average # of birthdays a child spends in foster care: 2 

- 22% of children had three or more placements during a length of 20 months in foster care.

- 91% of foster children under the age of 2 are adopted.

The goal of foster care in the US is to create a safe environment for the child long term thus every child in foster care has a Case Plan and a Case Plan Goal. A case plan is a clear statement about why the child needs protection and the roles and responsibilities of all participants (case worker, foster parents, etc.) in addressing the child&#x27;s needs and their protection. The Case Plan Goal is the end goal for the child that ends their stay in foster care. The following is the case plan goals of 2022 for the 368,530 children in foster care according to the federal government Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System.

- 52% of foster children have the goal to Reunify with Parent(s) or Primary Caretaker(s)

- 4% of foster children have the goal to Live with Other Relative(s) 

- 28% of foster children have the goal of Adoption

- 2% of foster children have the goal of Long Term Foster Care

-5% of foster children have the goal of Emancipation

-4% of foster children have the goal of Guardianship

- 5% of foster children do not have a case plan goal established yet

===France===
In France, foster families are called (literally &quot;welcome families&quot;). Foster homes must obtain an official approval from the government in order to welcome a minor or an elderly person. In order to receive this approval they must follow a training and their home is inspected to be sure it is safe and healthy. In 2017, 344 000 minors and 15000 elderly persons were welcomed in foster homes.

== Placement ==

Family-based foster care is generally preferred to other forms of out of home care. Foster care is intended to be a short-term solution until a permanent placement can be made. In most states, the primary objective is to reconcile children with the biological parents. However, if the parents are unable or unwilling to care for the child, or if the child is an orphan, then the first choice of adoptive parents is a relative such as an aunt, uncle or grandparent, known as kinship care. Most kinship care is done informally, without the involvement of a court or public organization. However, in the United States, formal kinship care is increasingly common. In 2012, a quarter of all children in formal foster care were placed with relatives instead of being placed into the system.

If no related family member is willing or able to adopt, the next preference is for the child to be adopted by the foster parents or by someone else involved in the child&#x27;s life (such as a teacher or coach). This is to maintain continuity in the child&#x27;s life. If neither above option are available, the child may be adopted by someone who is a stranger to the child.

If none of these options are viable, the plan for the minor may be to enter OPPLA (Other Planned Permanent Living Arrangement). This option allows the child to stay in custody of the state and the child can stay placed in a foster home, with a relative or a long-term care facility, such as a residential child care community or, for children with development disabilities, physical disabilities or mental disabilities, a treatment center.

671,000 children were served by the foster care system in the United States in 2015. &quot;After declining more than 20 percent between FY 2006 and FY 2012 to a low of 397,000, the number of children in foster care on the last day of the fiscal year increased to 428,000 in FY 2015, with a slightly higher percent change from 2014 to 2015 (3.3%) than observed from 2013 to 2014 (3.2%).&quot; Since FY 2012, the number of children in foster care at the end of each FY has steadily increased.

The median amount of time a child spent in foster care in the U.S. in 2015 was 13.5 months. That year, 74% of children spent less than two years in foster care, while 13% were in care for three or more years. Of the estimated 427,910 children in foster care on September 30, 2015: 43 percent were White, 24 percent were African-American, 21 percent were Hispanic (of any race), 10 percent were other races or multiracial, and 2 percent were unknown or unable to be determined.

Children may enter foster care voluntarily or involuntarily. Voluntary placement may occur when a biological parent or lawful guardian is unable to care for a child. Involuntary placement occurs when a child is removed from their biological parent or lawful guardian due to the risk or actual occurrence of physical or psychological harm, or if the child has been orphaned. In the US, most children enter foster care due to neglect. If a biological parent or legal guardian is unwilling to care for a child, the child is deemed to be dependent and is placed under the care of the child protection agency. The policies regarding foster care as well as the criteria to be met in order to become a foster parent vary according to legal jurisdiction.

Especially egregious failures of child protective services often serve as a catalyst for increased removal of children from the homes of biological parents. An example is the brutal torture and murder of 17-month-old Peter Connelly, a British toddler who died in London Borough of Haringey, North London after suffering more than 50 severe injuries over an eight-month period, including eight broken ribs and a broken back. Throughout the period of time in which he was being tortured, he was repeatedly seen by Haringey Children&#x27;s services and NHS health professionals. Haringey Children&#x27;s services already failed ten years earlier in the case of Victoria Climbié. In the time since his death, in 2007, cases have reached a record rate in England surpassing 10,000 in the reporting year ending in March 2012.

== Abuse and negligence ==
Children in foster care experience higher rates of child abuse, emotional deprivation, and physical neglect. In one study in the United Kingdom &quot;foster children were 7–8 times, and children in residential care 6 times more likely to be assessed by a pediatrician for abuse than a child in the general population&quot;. A study of foster children in Oregon and Washington State found that nearly one third reported being abused by a foster parent or another adult in a foster home. 

== Development ==
As of 2019, in the US, the majority of children in the foster care system were under eight years of age. These early years are quite important for the physical and mental development of children. More specifically, these early years are most important for brain development. Stressful and traumatic experiences have been found to have long-term negative consequences for the brain development in children whereas talking, singing, and playing can help encourage brain growth. Since the majority of children are removed from their homes due to neglect, this means that many of these children did not experience stable and stimulating environments to help promote this necessary growth. In a research study conducted at the University of Minnesota, researchers found that children placed in non-parental homes, such as foster homes, showed significant behavior problems and higher levels of internalizing problems in comparison to children in traditional families and even children who were mistreated by caregivers. According to an article written by Elizabeth Curry titled &quot;The five things you should know about how orphanage life affects children&quot;, a child who has lived in an orphanage or a home for multiple children will have learned survival skills but lack family skills due to them never understanding permanency.

== Medical and psychiatric disorders ==
A higher prevalence of physical, psychological, cognitive and epigenetic disorders for children in foster care has been established in studies in various countries. The Casey Family Programs Northwest Foster Care Alumni Study was a fairly extensive study of various aspects of children who had been in foster care.
Individuals who were in foster care experience higher rates of physical and psychiatric morbidity than the general population and suffer from not being able to trust and that can lead to placements breaking down.

In the Casey study of foster children in Oregon and Washington state, they were found to have double the incidence of depression, 20% as compared to 10% and were found to have a higher rate of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) than combat veterans with 25% of those studied having PTSD. Children in foster care have a higher probability of having attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and deficits in executive functioning, anxiety as well as other developmental problems.

These children experience higher degrees of incarceration, poverty, homelessness, and suicide. Studies in the U.S. have suggested that some foster care placements may be more detrimental to children than remaining in a troubled home, but a more recent study suggested that these findings may have been affected by selection bias, and that foster care has little effect on behavioral problems.

=== Neurodevelopment ===

Foster children have elevated levels of cortisol, a stress hormone, in comparison to children raised by their biological parents. Elevated cortisol levels can compromise the immune system. (Harden BJ, 2004). Most of the processes involved in typical neurodevelopment are predicated upon the establishment of close nurturing relationships and environmental stimulation. Negative environmental influences during this critical period of brain development can have lifelong consequences.

=== Post-traumatic stress disorder ===
Children in foster care have a higher incidence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In one study, 60% of children in foster care who had experienced sexual abuse had PTSD, and 42% of those who had been physically abused met the PTSD criteria. PTSD was also found in 18% of the children who were not abused. These children may have developed PTSD due to witnessing violence in the home. (Marsenich, 2002).

In order to figure out if a child has developed PTSD, there is a PTSD module, the &#x27;anxiety disorder interview&#x27;. This is considered a reliable resource for establishing if a child has developed post traumatic stress disorder due to physical, sexual, or mental abuse.

In a study conducted in Oregon and Washington state, the rate of PTSD in adults who were in foster care for one year between the ages of 14 and 18 was found to be higher than that of combat veterans, with 25% of those in the study meeting the diagnostic criteria as compared to 12–13% of Iraq war veterans and 15% of Vietnam war veterans, and a rate of 4% in the general population. The recovery rate for foster home alumni was 28.2% as opposed to 47% in the general population.

&quot;More than half the study participants reported clinical levels of mental illness, compared to less than a quarter of the general population&quot;.

=== Eating disorders ===

Foster children are at increased risk for a variety of eating disorders in comparison to the general population. In a study done in the United Kingdom, 35% of foster children experienced an increase in Body Mass Index (BMI) once in care. Food Maintenance Syndrome is characterized by a set of aberrant eating behaviors of children in foster care. It is &quot;a pattern of excessive eating and food acquisition and maintenance behaviors without concurrent obesity&quot;; it resembles &quot;the behavioral correlates of Hyperphagic Short Stature&quot;. It is hypothesized that this syndrome is triggered by the stress and maltreatment foster children are subjected to, it was prevalent amongst 25 percent of the study group in New Zealand. Bulimia nervosa is seven times more prevalent among former foster children than in the general population.

=== Poverty and homelessness ===
Nearly half of foster children in the U.S. become homeless when they turn 18. One of every 10 foster children stays in foster care longer than seven years, and each year about 15,000 reach the age of majority and leave foster care without a permanent family—many to join the ranks of the homeless or to commit crimes and be imprisoned.

Three out of 10 of the United States homeless are former foster children. According to the results of the Casey Family Study of Foster Care Alumni, up to 80 percent are doing poorly—with a quarter to a third of former foster children at or below the poverty line, three times the national poverty rate. Very frequently, people who are homeless had multiple placements as children: some were in foster care, but others experienced &quot;unofficial&quot; placements in the homes of family or friends.

Individuals with a history of foster care tend to become homeless at an earlier age than those who were not in foster care. The length of time a person remains homeless is longer in individuals who were in foster care.

=== Suicide-death rate ===

Children in foster care are at a greater risk of suicide. The increased risk of suicide is still prevalent after leaving foster care. In a small study of twenty-two Texan youths who aged out of the system, 23 percent had a history of suicide attempts.

A Swedish study utilizing the data of almost one million people including 22,305 former foster children who had been in care prior to their teens, concluded:
===Death rate===
Children in foster care have an overall higher mortality rate than children in the general population. A study conducted in Finland among current and former foster children up to age 24 found a higher mortality rate due to substance abuse, accidents, suicide and illness. The deaths due to illness were attributed to an increased incidence of acute and
chronic medical conditions and developmental delays among children in foster care.

Georgia Senator Nancy Schaefer published a report &quot;The Corrupt Business of Child Protective Services&quot; stating:

===Academic prospects===
Educational outcomes of ex-foster children in the Northwest Alumni Study:
* 56% completed high school compared to 82% of the general population, although an additional 29% of former foster children received a G.E.D. compared to an additional 5% of the general population.
* 42.7% completed some education beyond high school.
* 20.6% completed any degree or certificate beyond high school
* 16.1% completed a vocational degree; 21.9% for those over 25.
* 1.8% complete a bachelor&#x27;s degree, 2.7% for over 25, the completion rate for the general population in the same age group is 24%, a sizable difference.

The study reviewed case records for 659 foster care alumni in Northwest USA, and interviewed 479 of them
between September 2000 and January 2002.

=== Higher Education ===
Approximately 10% of foster youth make it to college and of those 10%, only about 3% actually graduate and obtain a 4-year degree. Although the number of foster youth who are starting at a 4-year university after high school has increased over the years, the number of youth who graduate from college continues to remain stable. A study of 712 youth in California, the results revealed that foster care youth are fives times less likely to attend college than youth who do not go through foster care. There are different resources that offer both financial and emotional support for foster youth to continue their education. Simultaneously, there are also many barriers that make getting to a college or university difficult.

Borton describes some of the barriers youth face in her article, &quot;Barriers to Post-Secondary Enrollment for Former Foster Youth&quot;. A few of those barriers include financial hurdles, navigating through the application process with little to no support, and lack of housing.

Many studies have shown that there are a few factors that have seemingly played a role in the success of foster youth making it to and graduating from a college or university. While having financial resources for foster youth is a huge help, there are other components to look at. Beginning with having support for these youth at the high school level. In order for foster youth to obtain a college degree, they must enroll at a university first.

Out of the different factors that play in increasing college enrollment such as youth participating in extended foster care, reading ability, etc., youth who received assistance or had supportive relationships from adults, were more likely than youth who did not have supportive relationships, to enroll at a university.

At colleges across the nation, there are programs that are specifically put in place to help youth who have aged out of the foster care system and continued into higher education. These programs often help youth financially by giving them supplemental funds and providing support through peer mentor programs or academic counseling services. While funding is an important key in helping get through college, it has not been found as the only crucial component in aiding a youth&#x27;s success.

A study done by Jay and colleagues provides insight on what youth view as important in helping them thrive on a college campus. The study, which had a sample of 51 foster youth, used Conceptual Mapping to break down the different components of support that may be important for youth to receive on a college campus. It is important to take in the different factors that can be helpful for youth at a university and to look beyond providing financial support.

=== Psychotropic medication use ===

Studies have revealed that youth in foster care covered by Medicaid insurance receive psychotropic medication at a rate that was 3 times higher than that of Medicaid-insured youth who qualify by low family income. In a review (September 2003 to August 2004) of the medical records of 32,135 Texas foster care 0–19 years old, 12,189 were prescribed psychotropic medication, resulting in an annual prevalence of 37.9% of these children being prescribed medication. 41.3% received 3 different classes of these drugs during July 2004, and 15.9% received 4 different classes. The most frequently used medications were antidepressants (56.8%), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder drugs (55.9%), and antipsychotic agents (53.2%). The study also showed that youth in foster care are frequently treated with concomitant psychotropic medication, for which sufficient evidence regarding safety and effectiveness is not available.

The use of expensive, brand name, patent protected medication was prevalent. In the case of SSRIs the use of the most expensive medications was noted to be 74%; in the general market only 28% are for brand name SSRI&#x27;s vs generics. The average out-of-pocket expense per prescription was $34.75 for generics and $90.17 for branded products, a $55.42, difference.

== Therapeutic intervention ==

Children in the child welfare system have often experienced significant and repeated traumas and having a background in foster homes—especially in instances of sexual abuse—can be the precipitating factor in a wide variety of psychological and cognitive deficits it may also serve to obfuscate the true cause of underlying issues. The foster care experience may have nothing to do with the symptoms, or on the other hand, a disorder may be exacerbated by having a history of foster care and attendant abuses. The human brain however has been shown to have a fair degree of neuroplasticity. and adult neurogenesis has been shown to be an ongoing process.

Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care (MTFC), also referred to as Treatment Foster Care Oregon (TFCO) and Treatment Foster Care (TFC) is a community-based intervention that was created in 1983 by Dr. Patricia Chamberlain and her associated colleagues with the initial design intended to offer a replacement for group facilities. MTFC has differing approaches for different age groups. Preschoolers receive “a behavior-management approach and intensively trains, supervises, and supports foster caregivers to provide positive adult support and consistent limit setting” coupled with “coordinated interventions with the child’s biological parents.” MTFC for adolescence consists of individual placement with an intensely trained foster family providing “coordinated interventions in the home, with peers, [and] in educational settings.” MTFC has been shown to provide better results than group facilities and proves to be more cost effective. Reports show that Multidimensional treatment has effective results in reducing depression, arrest rates, deviant peer affiliations, placement disruption, and pregnancy rates while having positive replication trials. It is one method that attempts to incorporate trauma informed care into its design.

Researchers have faced difficulty when it comes to accurately assessing what makes MTFC and other similar programs that involve multiple levels of intervention successful. It seems to remain in a &quot;black box&quot; scenario where it is unsure what aspect of the treatment plan is actually producing positive effects. Multiple peer-reviewed research articles on foster care programs point out a lack of research effectively evaluating the outcomes of specific foster care programs, calling for more complete assessments to be conducted in order to properly compare outcomes between treatment plans and evaluate what practices in MTFC are most effective. Ethical concerns have also been raised by Therese Åström and other associated researchers when conducting a systematic review on behalf of the Swedish Agency for Health Technology Assessment and Assessment of Social Services in 2018, noting that on the one hand MTFC is evaluated as effective, however, it tends to be implemented in a way that diminishes the child&#x27;s agency.

=== Cross-cultural adoption policies ===
George Shanti, Nico Van Oudenhoven, and Rekha Wazir, co-authors of &quot;Foster Care Beyond the Crossroads: Lessons from an International Comparative Analysis&quot;, say that there are four types of Government foster care systems. The first one is that of developing countries. These countries do not have policies implemented to take care of the basic needs of these children and these children mostly receive assistance from relatives. The second system is that of former socialist governments. The historical context of these states has not allowed for the evolution of their foster care system. NGO&#x27;s have urged them to evolve; however the traditional system of institutionalizing these children is still in place. Thirdly, liberal democracies do not have the support from its political system in order to take care of these children, even though they have the resources. Finally, social democracies are the most advanced governments in regards to their foster care system. These governments have a massive infrastructure, funding, and support system in order to help foster care children.

== Adoption ==

Foster care adoption is a type of domestic adoption where the child is initially placed into a foster care system and is subsequently placed for adoption.

Children may be placed into foster care for a variety of reasons; including, removal from the home by a governmental agency because of maltreatment. In some jurisdictions, adoptive parents are licensed as and technically considered foster parents while the adoption is being finalized. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Children&#x27;s Bureau, there were approximately 408,425 children in foster care in 2010. Of those children, twenty-five percent had a goal of adoption. In 2015, 243,060 children exited foster care and twenty-two percent were adopted. Nationwide, there are more than one hundred thousand children in the U.S. foster care system waiting for permanent families.

Adoptive parenting can have an impact on children, recent research has shown that warm adoptive parenting reduces internalizing and externalizing problems of the adoptive children over time.

== Outcomes ==
Youth who are aging out of foster care often face difficulties in transitioning into adulthood, especially in terms of finding stable housing, employment, finances, and educational opportunities. The suspected reason for these difficulties involves a lack of stability experienced while in the foster care system, and the reported abuse and/or neglect in their childhood, which may affect their ability to cope with significant life changes. In the United States, there are independent living programs designed with the intent to serve the needs of transitioning foster youth. However, youth aging out of foster care have indicated that these programs are failing to fully address the needs of young adults without familial assistance. Nearly half reported that they were unprepared for independent living and cited a lack of concrete needs such as safe housing, money and bus passes after aging out.

In a study conducted by Gypen et al. (2017), involving a cross-database analysis of research articles relevant to the outcomes of former foster youth, they found that the educational, mental health, employment, income, stable housing, criminal involvement and substance abuse issues outcomes for youth who have aged out of the foster care system are substantially poorer than their peers. For example, Gypen et al. (2017), indicated that only 45% of former foster youth received a high school diploma, which is 23% lower than the general population. There are also significantly poorer outcomes for children who were formerly in foster care than children from low-income households and racial minorities. African American former foster youth graduate high school at a much lower rate then their white counterparts. The likelihood for secondary degree obtainment, whether a two or four year degree, is significantly decreased compared to the general population in every survey. A 2011 study found that between 8-13% of former foster youth obtained either a 2 or 4 year college degree compared to 34-44% of the general population. Children who are eventually adopted by their placement family show greater outcomes, in terms of finding stable housing, employment, finances and education opportunities, than those who aged out of the foster care system without a permanent placement.

Economically, former foster youth also fall behind their non-foster youth peers. Annually, former foster youth make about $7550 less than their peers. After aging out about 17%-33% are dependent on public assistance (such as food stamps). Of those who age out of the family services system and move in with a partner, 32% don&#x27;t have any sort of income compared to 3% of the general population.

The mental health of those that age out of foster care also suffers more than the general population. Around 62% of former foster youth will be diagnosed with at least 1 psychiatric illness in their life time with a much higher rate of women getting such a diagnosis. Former foster youth also experience higher levels of substance abuse and alcohol dependency. Between 40% and 49% of former foster youth will abuse alcohol and 3% to 13% will become dependent on it. 39% of former foster youth smoke compared to 20% of youth in general and 16% use cannabis compared to 6.5%. Former foster youth who identify as male are 3 times more likely to abuse substances than females.

It has also been reported that former foster youth have a higher chance of ending up in prostitution, and even fall prey to sex trafficking. This has also been called the &quot;foster care to prostitution pipeline&quot;. a 2012 study in Los Angeles found that 59% of juveniles arrested for prostitution were or had been in foster care, but the generalizability of these findings has been disputed.

==Biography==
Hiroshi Fujimoto and Motoo Abiko were both from Toyama Prefecture. Fujimoto was born on December 1, 1933, and Abiko on March 10, 1934. Abiko transferred to Fujimoto&#x27;s elementary school in Takaoka City and happened to see Fujimoto drawing in a notebook. The two became lifelong friends, and during the early years of their friendship kept their illustrations hidden from friends and classmates out of embarrassment.

In junior high school they were greatly influenced by Osamu Tezuka and his manga series &quot;Shin Takarajima&quot;. Fujimoto built a homemade episcope and together they wrote a piece for it called &quot;Tenküma&quot;, which was their first collaborative work. They started submitting work to periodicals such as &quot;Manga Shōnen&quot; and opened a joint savings account through Japan Post to which they both contributed funds and which they used to purchase art supplies. They divided all income and expenses equally between each other, a practice they continued throughout the life of their partnership.

In high school they made their publishing debut, &quot;Tenshi no Tama-chan&quot; being adopted for serialization by &quot;Mainichi Shogakusei Shimbun&quot; in 1951. That same year they paid a visit to Tezuka&#x27;s residence in Takarazuka, Hyōgo and showed him illustrations for their work titled &quot;Ben Hur&quot;. Tezuka complimented the two, some years later commenting that he knew then they were going to be major figures in the manga industry. Abiko and Fujimoto treasured the meeting with the respected Tezuka, and kept the &quot;Ben Hur&quot; illustrations for their entire lives. It was at this time they decided to make their partnership permanent, initially adopting the name Tezuka Fujio out of respect, later changing this to Azhizuka Fujio when they perceived adoption of the Tezuka name as too close to that of their idol.

Because both Fujimoto and Abiko were eldest sons respectively, they decided to take company jobs after graduating from high school in 1952. Fujimoto found employment with a confectionery company, and Abiko began working for the Toyama Newspaper Company. However, Fujimoto quit within a matter of days. Fujimoto then dedicated his time to submitting work to periodicals, with Abiko assisting him on the weekends. Their first serial as Ashizuka Fujio was terminated in a few episodes, followed by success with the post-apocalyptic science fiction series .

They elected to move to Tokyo in 1954 as professional manga artists at Fujimoto&#x27;s urging, Abiko only reluctantly as he had steady employment at the Toyama Newspaper Company. Their first place of residence was a two-tatami mat room at the second floor of a watch shop. They eventually moved to the Tokiwa-sō apartment complex when Tezuka offered them a room that he was moving out of. Together with Hiroo Terada and several other manga artists of the period, they formed a collaborative group called . At the apartment complex where the group was based, they enjoyed a period of productivity that had Fujimoto and Abiko carry up to six serials a month for publication. Additionally, Abiko contributed to Tezuka&#x27;s works as an artist assistant, such as drawing a blizzard on the last page of &quot;Jungle Emperor&quot;.

The workload proved excessive, and in 1955 on return to Toyama for Japanese New Year the pair missed all the deadlines for their serials. The loss of credibility with publishers hurt Fujimoto and Abiko for a year. During the Tokiwa-s&quot;ō&quot; era, they purchased a television set in Akihabara and made independent films with an 8mm camera. By 1959 they left &quot;Tokiwa-sō&quot; and moved to Kawasaki in Kanagawa Prefecture. In the 1960s Fujimoto and Abiko founded &quot;Fujiko Studio Co., Ltd.&quot;, a joint manga production company. Fujimoto found time to get married on Halloween of 1962, at the age of 28.

In 1963 Fujimoto and Abiko established Studio Zero with Shin&#x27;ichi Suzuki, Shotaro Ishimori, Jirō Tsunoda and Kiyoichi Tsunoda. Later Fujio Akatsuka joined, and at its peak the studio employed about 80 people. The studio produced several animated series and stood in for Mushi Production for an episode of &quot;Astro Boy&quot;. For Fujimoto and Abiko these were some of their most productive years, resulting in series such as &quot;Obake no Q-Tarō&quot; which eventually were made into anime series on television. Abiko got married in 1966 at the age of 32. Fujimoto concentrated on titles for children, with a particular interest in science fiction.

In 1968, Abiko started making manga for a more mature audience, with titles such as &quot;Kuroi Salesman&quot;. In the 1970s, Abiko focused on both adult and boys manga. The style was full of black humor.

In the 1970s, Fujimoto focused on both adult and childhood manga. His style was notable for its sense of wonder.

&quot;Doraemon&quot; was created in 1969. Since around 1974, its popularity has skyrocketed among Japanese children. &quot;CoroCoro Comic&quot; released its first issue in 1977 to showcase the works of Fujiko Fujio. With syndication of Doraemon on TV Asahi in 1979, a surge of popularity saw up to a dozen collaborative and solo works by Fujimoto and Abiko picked up for publication and syndication throughout the 1980s. &quot;Doraemon&quot; is the only work by the duo to ever get an official release in English-speaking countries, most notably the United States. However, English dubs of work such as Perman and Ninja Hattori-kun aired in Asia, and an English dub of Studio Bones&#x27; adaptation of their series &quot;Time Patrol Bon&quot; is available worldwide on Netflix.

In 1987, citing creative differences, Fujimoto and Abiko ended their long partnership to concentrate on solo projects. From now on, Abiko would work at &quot;Fujiko Studio K.K.&quot; and Fujimoto in &quot;Fujiko F. Fujio Pro K.K.&quot;

Abiko adopted the pen name Fujiko Fujio A.

Fujimoto adopted the pen name Fujiko F. Fujio.

According to Abiko, the cause for the dissolution of the partnership was due to Fujimoto discovering he had stomach cancer in 1986 (Since it was not announced, neither Fujimoto nor Abiko knew the exact name of the disease), and both Fujimoto and Abiko had a desire to settle copyright and financial issues before the other died.

Fujimoto died of liver failure at a hospital in Shinjuku on September 23, 1996.

A documentary was aired on TV Asahi on February 19, 2006, chronicling the life and times of Fujiko F. Fujio.

A Fujiko F. Fujio museum opened in Kawasaki, Kanagawa on September 3, 2011, which features a reproduction of Fujio&#x27;s studio and a display of their artwork.

Abiko died of natural causes at his home in Kawasaki on April 6, 2022.

<doc id="387746" wikidata="Q3500657" url="?curid=387746" title="Social simulation">
<text>Social simulation is a research field that applies computational methods to study issues in the social sciences. The issues explored include problems in computational law, psychology, organizational behavior, sociology, political science, economics, anthropology, geography, engineering, archaeology and linguistics .

Social simulation aims to cross the gap between the descriptive approach used in the social sciences and the formal approach used in the natural sciences, by moving the focus on the processes/mechanisms/behaviors that build the social reality.

In social simulation, computers support human reasoning activities by executing these mechanisms. This field explores the simulation of societies as complex non-linear systems, which are difficult to study with classical mathematical equation-based models. Robert Axelrod regards social simulation as a third way of doing science, differing from both the deductive and inductive approach; generating data that can be analysed inductively, but coming from a rigorously specified set of rules rather than from direct measurement of the real world. Thus, simulating a phenomenon is akin to generating it—constructing artificial societies. These ambitious aims have encountered several criticisms.

The social simulation approach to the social sciences is promoted and coordinated by four regional associations, the European Social Simulation Association (ESSA) for Europe, the Asian Social Simulation Association (ASSA) for Asia, the Computational Social Science Society of the Americas (CSSS) in North America, and the Pan-Asian Association for Agent-based Approach in Social Systems Sciences (PAAA) in Pacific Asia.

==History and development==

The history of the agent-based model can be traced back to the Von Neumann machine, a theoretical machine capable of reproducing itself. The device John von Neumann proposed woud follow precisely detailed instructions to fashion a copy of itself. The concept was then improved by von Neumann&#x27;s friend Stanislaw Ulam, also a mathematician; Ulam suggested that the machine be built on paper, as a collection of cells on a grid. The idea intrigued von Neumann, who drew it up—creating the first of devices later termed cellular automata.

Another improvement was brought by mathematician, John Conway. He constructed the well-known Game of Life. Unlike the von Neumann&#x27;s machine, Conway&#x27;s Game of Life operated by simple rules in a virtual world in the form of a 2-dimensional checkerboard.

The birth of the agent-based model as a model for social systems was primarily brought about by a computer scientist, Craig Reynolds. He tried to model the reality of lively biological agents, known as the artificial life, a term coined by Christopher Langton.

Joshua M. Epstein and Robert Axtell developed the first large scale agent model, the Sugarscape, to simulate and explore the role of social phenomena such as seasonal migrations, pollution, sexual reproduction, combat, transmission of disease, and even culture.

Kathleen M. Carley published &quot;Computational Organizational Science and Organizational Engineering&quot; defining the movement of simulation into
organizations, established a journal for social simulation applied to organizations and complex socio-technical systems: Computational and Mathematical Organization Theory, and was the founding president of the North American Association of Computational Social and Organizational Systems that morphed into the current CSSSA.

Nigel Gilbert published with Klaus G. Troitzsch the first textbook on social simulation: &quot;Simulation for the Social Scientist&quot; (1999) and established its most relevant journal: the Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation.

More recently, Ron Sun developed methods for basing agent-based simulation on models of human cognition, known as cognitive social simulation (see )

==Topics==

Here are some sample topics that have been explored with social simulation:

* Social norms: Robert Axelrod has used simulations to investigate the foundation of morality; others have modeled the emergence of norms using memes, or how social norms and emotions can regulate each other.
* Institutions: by investigating under what conditions agents manage to coordinate, or by modeling the works of Robert Putnam on civic traditions
* Reputation, for example by making agents with a model of reputation from Pierre Bourdieu (image, social esteem, and prestige) and observing their behavior in a virtual marketplace.
* Knowledge transmission and the social process of science: there is a special section on that topic in the Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation
* Elections: Kim (2011) has modeled a psychological model of judgement from previous research (notably featuring motivated reasoning), and compared the statistical regularities of the simulation with empirical observations of voter behavior; others have compared delegation methods.
* Economics: see computational economics and agent-based computational economics.

==Types of simulation and modeling==
Social simulation can refer to a general class of strategies for understanding social dynamics using computers to simulate social systems. Social simulation allows for a more systematic way of viewing the possibilities of outcomes.

There are four major types of social simulation: 
#System level simulation.
#System level modeling.
#Agent-based simulation.
#Agent-based modeling.

A social simulation may fall within the rubric of computational sociology which is a recently developed branch of sociology that uses computation to analyze social phenomena. The basic premise of computational sociology is to take advantage of computer simulations in the construction of social theories. It involves the understanding of social agents, the interaction among these agents, and the effect of these interactions on the social aggregate. Although the subject matter and methodologies in social science differ from those in natural science or computer science, several of the approaches used in contemporary social simulation originated from fields such as physics and artificial intelligence.

===System level simulation===
System Level Simulation (SLS) is the oldest level of social simulation. System level simulation looks at the situation as a whole. This theoretical outlook on social situations uses a wide range of information to determine what should happen to society and its members if certain variables are present. Therefore, with specific variables presented, society and its members should have a certain response to the new situation. Navigating through this theoretical simulation will allow researchers to develop educated ideas of what will happen under some specific variables.

For example, if NASA were to conduct a system level simulation it would benefit the organization by providing a cost-effective research method to navigate through the simulation. This allows the researcher to steer through the virtual possibilities of the given simulation and develop safety procedures, and to produce proven facts about how a certain situation will play out. 

===System level modeling===

System level modeling (SLM) aims to specifically predict (unlike system level simulation&#x27;s generalization in prediction) and convey any number of actions, behaviors, or other theoretical possibilities of nearly any person, object, construct et cetera within a system using a large set of mathematical equations and computer programming in the form of models.

A model is a representation of a specific thing ranging from objects and people to structures and products created through mathematical equations and are designed, using computers, in such a way that they are able to stand-in as the aforementioned things in a study. Models can be either simplistic or complex, depending on the need for either; however, models are intended to be simpler than what they are representing while remaining realistically similar in order to be used accurately. They are built using a collection of data that is translated into computing languages that allow them to represent the system in question. These models, much like simulations, are used to help us better understand specific roles and actions of different things so as to predict behavior and the like.

===Agent-based simulation===

Agent-based social simulation (ABSS) consists of modeling different societies after artificial agents, (varying on scale) and placing them in a computer simulated society to observe the behaviors of the agents. From this data it is possible to learn about the reactions of the artificial agents and translate them into the results of non-artificial agents and simulations. Three main fields in ABSS are agent-based computing, social science, and computer simulation.

Agent-based computing is the design of the model and agents, while the computer simulation is the part of the simulation of the agents in the model and the outcomes. The social science is a mixture of sciences and social part of the model. It is where the social phenomena is developed and theorized. The main purpose of ABSS is to provide models and tools for agent-based simulation of social phenomena. With ABSS we can explore different outcomes for phenomena where we might not be able to view the outcome in real life. It can provide us valuable information on society and the outcomes of social events or phenomena.

===Agent-based modeling===

Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a system in which a collection of agents independently interact on networks. Each individual agent is responsible for different behaviors that result in collective behaviors. These behaviors as a whole help to define the workings of the network. ABM focuses on human social interactions and how people work together and communicate with one another without having one, single &quot;group mind&quot;. This essentially means that it tends to focus on the consequences of interactions between people (the agents) in a population. Researchers are better able to understand this type of modeling by modeling these dynamics on a smaller, more localized level. Essentially, ABM helps to better understand interactions between people (agents) who, in turn, influence one another (in response to these influences). Simple individual rules or actions can result in coherent group behavior. Changes in these individual acts can affect the collective group in any given population.

Agent-based modeling is an experimental tool for theoretical research. It enables one to deal with more complex individual behaviors, such as adaptation. Overall, through this type of modeling, the creator, or researcher, aims to model behavior of agents and the communication between them in order to better understand how these individual interactions impact an entire population. In essence, ABM is a way of modeling and understanding different global patterns.

==Current research==

There are several current research projects that relate directly to modeling and agent-based simulation the following are listed below with a brief overview.

*&quot;Generative e-Social Science for Socio-Spatial Simulation&quot; or (GENESIS) is a research node of the UK National Centre for e-Social Science funded by the UK research council ESRC.
*&quot;National e-Infrastructure for Social Simulation&quot; or (NeISS) is a UK-based project funded by JISC.
*&quot;Network Models Governance and R&amp;D collaboration networks&quot; or (N.E.M.O) is a research centre whose main focus is to identify ways to create and to assess desirable network structures for typical functions; (e.g. knowledge, creation, transfer, and distribution.) This research will ultimately aid policy-makers at all political levels in improving the effectiveness and efficiency of network-based policy instruments at promoting the knowledge economy in Europe.
*&quot;Agent-based Simulations of Market and Consumer Behavior&quot; is another research group that is funded by the Unilever Corporate Research. The current research that is being conducted is investigating the usefulness of agent-based simulations for modeling consumer behavior and to show the potential value and insights it can add to long-established marketing methods.
*&quot;New and Emergent World Models Through Individual, Evolutionary and Social Learning&quot; or (New Ties) is a three-year project that will ultimately create a virtual society developed by agent-based simulation. The project will develop a simulated society capable of exploring the environment and developing its own image of this environment and the society through interaction. The goal of the research project is for the simulated society to exhibit individual learning, evolutionary learning and social learning.
*Bruch and Mare&#x27;s project on neighborhood segregation: The purpose of the study is to figure out the reasoning for neighborhood segregation based on race, and to figure out the tipping point or when people become uncomfortable with the integration levels into their neighborhood, and decide to flee from the neighborhood. They set up a model using flash cards, and put the agent&#x27;s house in the middle and put houses of different races surrounding the agent&#x27;s house. They asked people how comfortable they would feel with different situations; if they were okay with one situation, they asked another until the neighborhood was fully integrated. Bruch and Mare&#x27;s results showed that the tipping point was at 50%. When a neighborhood became 50% minority and 50% white, people of both races began to become uncomfortable and white flight began to rise. The use of agent-based modeling showed how useful it can be in the world of sociology, people did not have to answer why they would become uncomfortable, just which situation they were uncomfortable with.
*The MAELIA Program (Multi-Agent Emergent Norms Assessment) is a project dealing with the relationships between the users and managers of a natural resource, in that case water, and the related norms and laws that are to be built within them (conventions) or are imposed to them by other actors (institutions). The purpose of the project is to build a generic multiscale platform which is planned to deal with water conflict-related issues.
*The Mosi-Agil project is a four-year program funded by the Autonomous Region of Madrid through the program MOSI-AGIL-CM (grant S2013/ICE-3019, co-funded by EU Structural Funds FSE and FEDER). It aims at creating a body of knowledge and practical tools which are necessary to handle more effectively the behavior of occupants of large facilities. Therefore, the project studies the development of ambient intelligence and intelligent environments supported by the use of Agent-Based Social Simulation.

Agent-based modeling is most useful in providing a bridge between micro and macro levels, which is a large part of what sociology studies. Agent-based models are most appropriate for studying processes that lack central coordination, including the emergence of institutions that, once established, impose order from the top down. The models focus on how simple and predictable local interactions generate familiar but highly detailed global patterns, such as emergence of norms and participation of collective action. Michael W. Macy and Robert Willer researched a recent survey of applications and found that there were two main problems with agent-based modeling the self-organization of social structure and the emergence of social order . Below is a brief description of each problem Macy and Willer believe there to be;
#&quot;&quot;Emergent structure&quot;. In these models, agents change location or behavior in response to social influences or selection pressures. Agents may start out undifferentiated and then change location or behavior so as to avoid becoming different or isolated (or in some cases, overcrowded). Rather than producing homogeneity, however, these conformist decisions aggregate to produce global patterns of cultural differentiation, stratification, and homophilic clustering in local networks. Other studies reverse the process, starting with a heterogeneous population and ending in convergence: the coordination, diffusion, and sudden collapse of norms, conventions, innovations, and technological standards.&quot;
#&quot;&quot;Emergent social order&quot;. These studies show how egoistic adaptation can lead to successful collective action without either altruism or global (top down) imposition of control. A key finding across numerous studies is that the viability of trust, cooperation, and collective action depends decisively on the embeddedness of interaction.&quot;

These examples simply show the complexity of our environment and that agent-based models are designed to explore the minimal conditions, the simplest set of assumptions about human behavior, required for a given social phenomenon to emerge at a higher level of organization.

==Criticisms==
Since its creation, computerized social simulation has been the target of some criticism in regard to its practicality and accuracy. Social simulation&#x27;s simplification of the complex to form models from which we can better understand the latter is sometimes seen as a draw back, as using fairly simple models to simulate real life with computers is not always the best way to predict behavior.

Most of the criticism seems to be aimed at agent-based models and simulation and how they work:

#Simulations, being man-made from mathematical interfaces, predict human behavior in a far too simple manner in regard to the complexities of humanity and our actions.
#Simulations cannot enlighten researchers as to how people interact or behave in ways not programmed into their models. For this reason, the scope of simulations are limited in that the researchers must already know what they are going to find (to a degree, for they cannot find anything they themselves did not place in the model) at least vaguely, possibly skewing the results.
#Due to the complexities of what is being measured, simulations must be analyzed in unbiased ways; however, with the model running on a pre-made set of instructions coded into it by a modeler, biases exist almost universally.
#It is highly difficult and often impractical to attempt to link the findings from the abstract world the simulation creates and our complex society and all of its variation.

Researchers working in social simulation might respond that the competing theories from the social sciences are far simpler than those achieved through simulation and therefore suffer the aforementioned drawbacks much more strongly. Theories in some social science tend to be linear models that are not dynamic, and are generally inferred from small laboratory experiments (laboratory tests are most common in psychology but rare in sociology, political science, economics and geography). The behavior of populations of agents under these models is rarely tested or verified against empirical observation.

<doc id="387750" wikidata="Q913323" url="?curid=387750" title="Separation of variables">
<text>In mathematics, separation of variables (also known as the Fourier method) is any of several methods for solving ordinary and partial differential equations, in which algebra allows one to rewrite an equation so that each of two variables occurs on a different side of the equation.

== Ordinary differential equations (ODE) ==

A differential equation for the unknown formula_1 will be separable if it can be written in the form

:formula_2

where formula_3 and formula_4 are given functions. This is perhaps more transparent when written using formula_5 as:

:formula_6

So now as long as &quot;h&quot;(&quot;y&quot;) ≠ 0, we can rearrange terms to obtain:

:formula_7

where the two variables &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; have been separated. Note &quot;dx&quot; (and &quot;dy&quot;) can be viewed, at a simple level, as just a convenient notation, which provides a handy mnemonic aid for assisting with manipulations. A formal definition of &quot;dx&quot; as a differential (infinitesimal) is somewhat advanced.

=== Alternative notation ===

Those who dislike Leibniz&#x27;s notation may prefer to write this as

:formula_8

but that fails to make it quite as obvious why this is called &quot;separation of variables&quot;. Integrating both sides of the equation with respect to formula_9, we have

or equivalently,

:formula_10

because of the substitution rule for integrals.

If one can evaluate the two integrals, one can find a solution to the differential equation. Observe that this process effectively allows us to treat the derivative formula_11 as a fraction which can be separated. This allows us to solve separable differential equations more conveniently, as demonstrated in the example below.

(Note that we do not need to use two constants of integration, in equation () as in
:formula_12
because a single constant formula_13 is equivalent.)

=== Example ===
Population growth is often modeled by the &quot;logistic&quot; differential equation

: formula_14

where formula_15 is the population with respect to time formula_16, formula_17 is the rate of growth, and formula_18 is the carrying capacity of the environment.
Separation of variables now leads to

: formula_19
which is readily integrated using partial fractions on the left side yielding

: formula_20

where A is the constant of integration. We can find formula_21 in terms of formula_22 at t=0. Noting formula_23 we get

: formula_24

=== Generalization of separable ODEs to the nth order ===
Much like one can speak of a separable first-order ODE, one can speak of a separable second-order, third-order or &quot;n&quot;th-order ODE. Consider the separable first-order ODE:
:formula_25
The derivative can alternatively be written the following way to underscore that it is an operator working on the unknown function, &quot;y&quot;:
:formula_26
Thus, when one separates variables for first-order equations, one in fact moves the &quot;dx&quot; denominator of the operator to the side with the &quot;x&quot; variable, and the &quot;d&quot;(&quot;y&quot;) is left on the side with the &quot;y&quot; variable. The second-derivative operator, by analogy, breaks down as follows:
:formula_27
The third-, fourth- and &quot;n&quot;th-derivative operators break down in the same way. Thus, much like a first-order separable ODE is reducible to the form
:formula_25
a separable second-order ODE is reducible to the form
:formula_29
and an nth-order separable ODE is reducible to
:formula_30

=== Example ===
Consider the simple nonlinear second-order differential equation:formula_31This equation is an equation only of &quot;y&quot;&quot; and &quot;y&#x27;&quot;, meaning it is reducible to the general form described above and is, therefore, separable. Since it is a second-order separable equation, collect all &quot;x&quot; variables on one side and all &quot;y&#x27;&quot; variables on the other to get:formula_32Now, integrate the right side with respect to &quot;x&quot; and the left with respect to &quot;y&quot;&#x27;:formula_33This givesformula_34which simplifies to:formula_35This is now a simple integral problem that gives the final answer:formula_36

== Partial differential equations ==

The method of separation of variables is also used to solve a wide range of linear partial differential equations with boundary and initial conditions, such as the heat equation, wave equation, Laplace equation, Helmholtz equation and biharmonic equation.

The analytical method of separation of variables for solving partial differential equations has also been generalized into a computational method of decomposition in invariant structures that can be used to solve systems of partial differential equations.

=== Example: homogeneous case ===

Consider the one-dimensional heat equation. The equation is

 = 0&lt;/math&gt;|}}

The variable &quot;u&quot; denotes temperature. The boundary condition is homogeneous, that is
Let us attempt to find a solution which is not identically zero satisfying the boundary conditions but with the following property: &quot;u&quot; is a product in which the dependence of &quot;u&quot; on &quot;x&quot;, &quot;t&quot; is separated, that is:

Substituting &quot;u&quot; back into equation and using the product rule,

Since the right hand side depends only on &quot;x&quot; and the left hand side only on &quot;t&quot;, both sides are equal to some constant value −&quot;λ&quot;. Thus:

and

−&quot;λ&quot; here is the eigenvalue for both differential operators, and &quot;T&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) and &quot;X&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) are corresponding eigenfunctions.

We will now show that solutions for &quot;X&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) for values of &quot;λ&quot; ≤ 0 cannot occur:

Suppose that &quot;λ&quot; &lt; 0. Then there exist real numbers &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot; such that

:formula_37

From we get

and therefore &quot;B&quot; = 0 = &quot;C&quot; which implies &quot;u&quot; is identically 0.

Suppose that &quot;λ&quot; = 0. Then there exist real numbers &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot; such that

:formula_38

From we conclude in the same manner as in 1 that &quot;u&quot; is identically 0.

Therefore, it must be the case that &quot;λ&quot; &gt; 0. Then there exist real numbers &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot; such that
:formula_39
and
:formula_40

From we get &quot;C&quot; = 0 and that for some positive integer &quot;n&quot;,

:formula_41

This solves the heat equation in the special case that the dependence of &quot;u&quot; has the special form of .

In general, the sum of solutions to which satisfy the boundary conditions also satisfies and . Hence a complete solution can be given as

:formula_42

where &quot;D&quot;&quot;n&quot; are coefficients determined by initial condition.

Given the initial condition

:formula_43

we can get

:formula_44

This is the sine series expansion of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) which is amenable to Fourier analysis. Multiplying both sides with formula_45 and integrating over results in

:formula_46

This method requires that the eigenfunctions &quot;X&quot;, here formula_47, are orthogonal and complete. In general this is guaranteed by Sturm–Liouville theory.

=== Example: nonhomogeneous case ===

Suppose the equation is nonhomogeneous,

=h(x,t)&lt;/math&gt;|}}

with the boundary condition the same as .

Expand &quot;h&quot;(&quot;x,t&quot;), &quot;u&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;t&quot;) and &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) into



where &quot;h&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) and &quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot; can be calculated by integration, while &quot;u&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is to be determined.

Substitute and back to and considering the orthogonality of sine functions we get

: formula_48

which are a sequence of linear differential equations that can be readily solved with, for instance, Laplace transform, or Integrating factor. Finally, we can get
: formula_49

If the boundary condition is nonhomogeneous, then the expansion of and is no longer valid. One has to find a function &quot;v&quot; that satisfies the boundary condition only, and subtract it from &quot;u&quot;. The function &quot;u-v&quot; then satisfies homogeneous boundary condition, and can be solved with the above method.

=== Example: mixed derivatives ===

For some equations involving mixed derivatives, the equation does not separate as easily as the heat equation did in the first example above, but nonetheless separation of variables may still be applied. Consider the two-dimensional biharmonic equation

:formula_50

Proceeding in the usual manner, we look for solutions of the form

:formula_51

and we obtain the equation

:formula_52

Writing this equation in the form

:formula_53

Taking the derivative of this expression with respect to formula_54 gives formula_55 which means formula_56 or formula_57 and likewise, taking derivative with respect to formula_58 leads to formula_59 and thus formula_60 or formula_61, hence either &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) or &quot;G&quot;(&quot;y&quot;) must be a constant, say −λ. This further implies that either formula_62 or formula_63 are constant. Returning to the equation for &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;, we have two cases

:formula_64

and

:formula_65

which can each be solved by considering the separate cases for formula_66 and noting that formula_67.

=== Curvilinear coordinates ===

In orthogonal curvilinear coordinates, separation of variables can still be used, but in some details different from that in Cartesian coordinates. For instance, regularity or periodic condition may determine the eigenvalues in place of boundary conditions. See spherical harmonics for example.

== Applicability ==
===Partial differential equations===

For many PDEs, such as the wave equation, Helmholtz equation and Schrödinger equation, the applicability of separation of variables is a result of the spectral theorem. In some cases, separation of variables may not be possible. Separation of variables may be possible in some coordinate systems but not others, and which coordinate systems allow for separation depends on the symmetry properties of the equation. Below is an outline of an argument demonstrating the applicability of the method to certain linear equations, although the precise method may differ in individual cases (for instance in the biharmonic equation above).

Consider an initial boundary value problem for a function formula_68 on formula_69 in two variables:

:formula_70

where formula_71 is a differential operator with respect to formula_9 and formula_73 is a differential operator with respect to formula_16 with boundary data:

:formula_75 for formula_76 
:formula_77 for formula_78

where formula_4 is a known function.

We look for solutions of the form formula_80. Dividing the PDE through by formula_81 gives

:formula_82

The right hand side depends only on formula_9 and the left hand side only on formula_84 so both must be equal to a constant formula_85, which gives two ordinary differential equations

:formula_86

which we can recognize as eigenvalue problems for the operators for formula_71 and formula_73. If formula_71 is a compact, self-adjoint operator on the space formula_90 along with the relevant boundary conditions, then by the Spectral theorem there exists a basis for formula_90 consisting of eigenfunctions for formula_71. Let the spectrum of formula_71 be formula_94 and let formula_95 be an eigenfunction with eigenvalue formula_96. Then for any function which at each time formula_16 is square-integrable with respect to formula_9, we can write this function as a linear combination of the formula_95. In particular, we know the solution formula_100 can be written as

:formula_101

For some functions formula_102. In the separation of variables, these functions are given by solutions to formula_103

Hence, the spectral theorem ensures that the separation of variables will (when it is possible) find all the solutions.

For many differential operators, such as formula_104, we can show that they are self-adjoint by integration by parts. While these operators may not be compact, their inverses (when they exist) may be, as in the case of the wave equation, and these inverses have the same eigenfunctions and eigenvalues as the original operator (with the possible exception of zero).

== Matrices ==
The matrix form of the separation of variables is the Kronecker sum.

As an example we consider the 2D discrete Laplacian on a regular grid:

:formula_105

where formula_106 and formula_107 are 1D discrete Laplacians in the &quot;x&quot;- and &quot;y&quot;-directions, correspondingly, and formula_108 are the identities of appropriate sizes. See the main article Kronecker sum of discrete Laplacians for details.

== Software ==
Some mathematical programs are able to do separation of variables: Xcas among others.

<text>The Kingpin (Wilson Grant Fisk) is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by Stan Lee and John Romita Sr., and first appeared in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #50 (cover-dated July 1967). The &quot;Kingpin&quot; name is a reference to the crime lord title in Mafia slang nomenclature.

One of the most feared, dangerous, and powerful crime lords in the Marvel Universe, usually depicted as New York City&#x27;s crime overlord, the Kingpin was introduced as an adversary of Spider-Man, but later went on to be the archenemy of Daredevil, as well as a recurring foe of the Punisher and of his adoptive daughter Echo. He was married to Vanessa Fisk, who frequently expressed her disapproval of his criminal activities, and later to Typhoid Mary Fisk, and is the father of Richard Fisk and Butch Pharris, the latter of whom succeeded him as the Kingpin following his retirement. His traditional attire consists of his signature white suit jacket and cane, though his appearance has been changed over the years. Across all iterations, the Kingpin is depicted with an extraordinarily heavyset appearance and a bald head. The character is not simply obese, but also heavily muscled (like a sumo wrestler) and a formidable hand-to-hand combatant. Despite this, his size has been regularly mocked, especially by Spider-Man.

The character has been adapted from the comics into various forms of media, including feature films, television series, and video games. The Kingpin was portrayed by John Rhys-Davies in the 1989 television film &quot;The Trial of the Incredible Hulk&quot;, and by Michael Clarke Duncan in the 2003 feature film &quot;Daredevil&quot;, who also voiced the character in &quot;Spider-Man: The New Animated Series&quot;. Vincent D&#x27;Onofrio portrays Wilson Fisk in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) franchise, having appeared thus far in the television series &quot;Daredevil&quot; (2015–2018), the miniseries &quot;Hawkeye&quot; (2021) and &quot;Echo&quot; (2024), and will reprise his role in &quot;&quot; (2025). Liev Schreiber voiced the Kingpin in the animated film &quot;Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse&quot; (2018). In 2009, the Kingpin was ranked as IGN&#x27;s 10th-Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.

==Publication history==
The Kingpin first appears in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #50 (July 1967), and was created by writer Stan Lee and artist John Romita Sr., who based his physical appearance on actors Sydney Greenstreet and Robert Middleton.

In his debut story arc in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #50–52, the Kingpin is portrayed purely as a crime lord, albeit one who tends to be unusually hands-on in his criminal dealings. In his subsequent appearances, also written by Lee, he becomes more of a typical supervillain, employing fantastic devices to further his criminal capers. In the early 1980s, the character evolved further. A series of appearances in &quot;Daredevil&quot; by writer/penciler Frank Miller depicted the Kingpin as a scheming, cold-blooded crime lord who consistently stayed beyond the reach of the law. This remained the character&#x27;s dominant form for decades as the Kingpin became widely regarded as Daredevil&#x27;s archenemy. He continues to be a recurring opponent of Spider-Man, Daredevil, Echo, and the Punisher.

==Fictional character biography==
Wilson Grant Fisk began his life as a poor child in New York City. Enduring bullying from his classmates because of his obesity, Fisk trained himself in physical combat and eventually used his new-found strength to form a gang of his former tormentors that terrorized the surrounding neighborhoods. He was soon discovered by mob boss Don Rigoletto, who hired his best friend and him as bodyguards, and Fisk worked his way up Rigoletto&#x27;s ranks until he became the Don&#x27;s right-hand man. He then turned on his mentor, eliminating him and taking control of his men and business interests, before expanding his new empire until he had become one of the most powerful figures in New York&#x27;s criminal underworld, earning the name &quot;Kingpin&quot;.

While the Kingpin enjoyed a long tenure in his new position, he also garnered enemies in the form of the Maggia and the terrorist group Hydra. The two groups joined forces to attack Fisk&#x27;s empire, causing him to flee to Japan after losing most of his assets. There, he started a legitimate spice-exporting business and used the profits to return to New York, organizing his old followers and starting a war to destroy the Maggia. The resulting chaos allowed Fisk to easily step back in and gain back everything he had lost.

Fisk attempted to form a coalition of New York&#x27;s crime families after hearing that the vigilante Spider-Man had disappeared and ordered the abduction of J. Jonah Jameson to silence his reporting on the Kingpin&#x27;s crimes, but Spider-Man returned and foiled his plans, in what became Fisk&#x27;s first confrontation with the web-slinger.

To avoid public scrutiny of his criminal activities, Fisk cultivated an image of himself as a legitimate businessman and a kind-hearted philanthropist who made donations to charities. He eventually met a woman named Vanessa, whom he married, and they had a son named Richard. Vanessa did not know that her future husband was a criminal when they married. When she finally learned who he really was, she threatened to leave him if he did not give up his life of crime. The Kingpin gave up his criminal empire, moving his family to Japan to protect them from his enemies. As time passed, however, he found himself unable to adjust to civilian life and became the Kingpin once more, this time with his wife&#x27;s knowledge.

Richard did not find out that his father was a criminal until he attended college. After graduating, he told his parents that he intended to travel through Europe. Only months later, they received news that their son had died in a skiing accident. However, it turned out that Richard was still alive; he returned to New York, used a costume and mask to disguise himself as a mysterious new crime lord calling himself the &quot;Schemer&quot;, and formed his own gang to destroy his father&#x27;s empire. Fisk came back into conflict with Spider-Man as he worked to stop the Schemer.

At one point, he became the manager and director of a Las Vegas-based fragment of HYDRA, despite their past opposition to his rule.

At his wife&#x27;s behest, Fisk later permanently divested himself of his criminal empire. He unsuccessfully attempted to kill Spider-Man once more, before stepping down as the Kingpin, swearing to never again return to crime.

===1980s===
To complete his reformation, the Kingpin agreed to turn over all of his records to the authorities so they could prosecute his former lieutenants. His wife Vanessa was subsequently kidnapped by the men he betrayed, who then put out a contract on his life. After witnessing Vanessa&#x27;s apparent death, Fisk returned to a life of crime. He quickly regained control by taking advantage of his knowledge of the weaknesses of all of New York&#x27;s criminal organizations, and made a promise to keep the East Coast stable to stop crime bosses from the Midwest from expanding into his territory. The Kingpin also gained the loyalty of infamous assassin Bullseye by promising him steady work. When Daredevil stole his records, the Kingpin did nothing to stop him, plotting to get his old allies arrested so he could select more compliant replacements. Daredevil realized this in time to stop himself from turning over the records, frustrating the Kingpin&#x27;s plans. Kingpin maneuvered Daredevil into battling the Hand, hoping to get him killed. He secretly promoted corrupt mayoral candidate Randolph Cherryh, and hired the services of Elektra Natchios. Daredevil found Vanessa alive but amnesiac, and used her as leverage to force Kingpin to end his support for Cherryh. As retribution, he sent Elektra to kill Foggy Nelson (Daredevil&#x27;s friend), but Elektra failed and was killed by Bullseye.

The Kingpin learned Daredevil&#x27;s secret identity through information passed on from Karen Page, Daredevil&#x27;s ex-girlfriend who was now a pornographic film actress addicted to drugs. The Kingpin used his influence to destroy Matt Murdock&#x27;s civilian and professional life. Enamored with the results of his own scheme, he became increasingly obsessed with ruining Daredevil&#x27;s legacy. This led to a series of events that included brutalizing respected crime reporter Ben Urich, having his employees James Wesley and Felix Manning assault Daredevil&#x27;s confidant, dirty cop Nick Manolis, and sending the homicidal Nuke into Hell&#x27;s Kitchen. Nuke&#x27;s rampage killed dozens of people, and the Kingpin was implicated. Though he avoided prison, his reputation was shattered and the image of respectability he had carefully built was ruined.

Kingpin was sought out by the Black Cat (who was dating Spider-Man at the time), and became concerned that her lack of powers would make the woman a liability to him. He therefore arranged to have scientists on his payroll provide her with defensive &quot;bad luck&quot; powers that cause mishap to befall anyone who attempts to harm her in combat but also hurt and eventually kill anyone who stays close to her for too long. The Kingpin hoped that this would lead to Spider-Man&#x27;s death, but Spider-Man and the Black Cat ultimately broke up instead. Shortly after, Fisk was attacked by Spider-Man. Fisk later had his scientists create the supervillains the Answer, and the Spot, to battle Spider-Man and the Black Cat so they would not interfere further with his operations.

===1990s===
Fisk later rehires Bullseye to look into the parties responsible for a major drug war in New York and survives an assassination attempt by Crossbones. In retaliation, he sends Bullseye to assassinate the Red Skull (Crossbones&#x27;s employer). The attempt fails, and the Kingpin instead defeats the Red Skull (in a clone of Captain America&#x27;s body) in personal combat.

Fisk subsequently purchases his own cable television station, partnering with a wealthy millionaire from Texas that the Kingpin thinks can be easily manipulated. However, the &quot;millionaire&quot; is actually a spy planted by HYDRA. Learning of this from Nick Fury, Daredevil spreads rumors among New York&#x27;s criminal outfits that the Kingpin had become a stooge of HYDRA, weakening his credibility and influence. HYDRA operatives steal most of the Kingpin&#x27;s fortune, deprive him of income by dismantling his businesses, and send a helicopter gunship to destroy his skyscraper offices. With his empire crumbling, the Kingpin is indicted on federal charges, and Daredevil tricks him into committing assault and battery when he tries to escape via Manhattan&#x27;s Port Authority Bus Terminal. Bailed out of jail by a rival, Fisk finally snaps when he learns that his benefactor intends to use him as an &quot;errand boy&quot;. He kills him, and becomes a fugitive.

The Kingpin regains his sanity and has a small role in &quot;Marvel vs. DC&quot; when he purchases the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;, firing Perry White and replacing him with J. Jonah Jameson. He also bullies workers, especially Lois Lane, who threatens to expose him as the Kingpin. Eventually, he is confronted by his angry staff but is defeated when Spider-Man (Ben Reilly) and Superboy (Kon-El) arrive before he can do any significant damage. At the end of the crossover, the universes are restored and everyone is returned home.

Fisk returns to Japan and focuses on rebuilding his empire while fighting the X-Men and Shang-Chi, Kingpin became leader of Shang-Chi&#x27;s father&#x27;s organization, Si-Fan, introducing a clan of cyborg ninjas named Cyber-Ninjas. He returns to New York and resumes his criminal activities as Kingpin. Still under Kingpin&#x27;s command, Si-Fan faces Shang-Chi and Elektra.

===2000s===
While in Japan, Fisk manipulates his adoptive daughter Maya Lopez (Echo) into thinking that Daredevil killed her biological father (although Fisk was actually responsible) to incite Daredevil&#x27;s death. However, his plan backfires when Daredevil convinces Maya of the truth, and Lopez shoots the Kingpin in the eyes in retaliation, rendering him blind. Fisk eventually loses his criminal empire to Samuel Silke (one of his employees who works with Richard) in a bloody assassination bid, using the Kingpin&#x27;s new status as a blind man to rally supporters. In the aftermath, Vanessa kills Richard and flees the country with Fisk&#x27;s remaining wealth while the Kingpin recuperates in an unnamed East European country, broken and alone. He is given an eye transplant which restores his eyesight. He eventually confronts Silke and fatally crushes the man&#x27;s head, almost manages to regain his empire through sheer will, but is defeated by Daredevil (who declares himself the new Kingpin). Fisk is imprisoned as a result.

He later hatches a scheme to be freed and regain his wealth by giving the FBI proof in the form of the nonexistent &quot;Murdock Papers&quot; that Murdock is Daredevil. Having made so many enemies in prison, Fisk is constantly under attack from the Hand, HYDRA, and any number of criminal organizations with which he had had dealings. The U.S. government is hard-pressed to get rid of this expensive, dangerous, legally clean master criminal, and Fisk succeeds in manipulating the FBI into gravely wounding Daredevil and providing them a sample of Daredevil&#x27;s DNA. He tells Ben Urich to give the federal government the location of the Night Nurse, the only medic for injured superheroes, or go to jail.

Kingpin finally succeeds in getting Matt Murdock arrested, but the FBI betrays him at the last minute and arrests him as well, placing him in the same jail as Murdock in the hopes that the two will kill each other; instead, the two enemies team up to survive a prison riot directed at them. Finally, Murdock sacrifices the deal, refusing to let Bullseye (who was also incarcerated) leave the prison as the Kingpin had planned. The fight ends with the Kingpin shot point-blank in the knee by gunfire from Bullseye intended for Murdock, while Murdock escapes; a dying Vanessa is revealed to have manipulated events to attempt to have them both killed, while mourning her son&#x27;s death.

Fisk appears in the 2006 &quot;Civil War: War Crimes&quot; one-shot issue, in which he offers information about Captain America&#x27;s Resistance base to Iron Man, the leader of the pro-Registration forces in exchange for a reduced sentence. But as his status in prison is threatened for collaborating with Iron Man, he betrays Iron Man. He then puts out a hit on Spider-Man&#x27;s loved ones after Iron Man convinced Peter Parker to publicly reveal himself as a means of demonstrating support for the Superhuman Registration Act. This results in May Parker being gravely wounded by a sniper&#x27;s attempt to kill Spider-Man. After tracing the event back to Kingpin, Spider-Man confronts the Kingpin in prison and badly beats him in front of his fellow inmates. Spider-Man decides to let the Kingpin live with the humiliation of his defeat, news of which will quickly spread through the Underworld. Parker vows, however, to kill the Kingpin if May dies.

In the 2007 &quot;One More Day&quot; storyline, which ends with the undoing from history of Peter and Mary Jane Watson&#x27;s marriage by Mephisto, with the exception of Mary Jane Watson and Kaine, no one (including Kingpin) knows Spider-Man&#x27;s secret identity. In the new reality, Kingpin, informed of May&#x27;s survival by a disguised Mephisto, decides to send a masked hitman after Anna Watson. The assassin is interrupted by Mary Jane, who then becomes his target, and then by Spider-Man, who dispatches and unmask him. Spider-Man brings the wounded Mary Jane to Doctor Strange, who performs a healing spell on her. Peter insists that Doctor Strange should make people forget he is Spider-Man. Doctor Strange contacts Tony Stark and Reed Richards for advice on the matter, because they are partially responsible for Peter&#x27;s identity becoming public. Both Reed and Tony agree with Doctor Strange, but it takes some convincing.

Murdock returns to the United States with a cleared name and completes Vanessa&#x27;s last wish and takes on Fisk&#x27;s case, getting all charges dropped in exchange for Fisk leaving the country, giving up his American citizenship and his agreement to end his vendetta with Daredevil. Although the charges were dropped due to the evidence being deemed inadmissible in court, Murdock delays the case enough so Fisk is unable to attend his wife&#x27;s funeral. The mournful Fisk is later seen visiting his wife&#x27;s grave, before temporarily returning to New York to resolve some loose ends.

In a 2007–2008 storyline in the series &quot;Runaways&quot;, Fisk meets with the Runaways, revealing he knew all about their parents since they ruled Los Angeles with efficiency and vision; he never tried to take their territory, nor did they invade his. He makes a deal with the Runaways to secure a mysterious object for him in exchange for protection from the government. He and his army of ninjas are defeated when the Runaways refuse to give it to him after stealing the object, discovering what Fisk wanted was a device invented by the Pride. It is later revealed that Fisk was hired by elderly woman Lillie McGurty who orchestrated the events so the Runaways can travel back to 1907 and ensure that the woman would come back to the present with them, which her past self declined.

During the 2008 &quot;Dark Reign&quot; storyline, the Kingpin forms an alliance with Lady Bullseye to destroy Daredevil. He orders Lady Bullseye to disguise herself as a member of the Hand and kill two corrupt cops and a judge, making it seems that Daredevil ordered this and prompting Norman Osborn as the leader of the law enforcement organization H.A.M.M.E.R. to send Bullseye in retaliation. Though Daredevil survives the fight with Bullseye, the Kingpin is undeterred and states that he has Daredevil &quot;where he wants [his nemesis]&quot;. The Kingpin has also targeted Daredevil&#x27;s friends to frame Osborn for their recent misfortunes to further his attempts on manipulating Daredevil&#x27;s actions. He has Nelson disbarred as an attorney for standing up to a judge on his payroll for an unfair ruling of overturning a jury&#x27;s verdict. He also causes the loss of Dakota North&#x27;s private investigator license.

In the 2009 &quot;Daredevil&quot; arc &quot;Return of the King&quot;, it is revealed that the Kingpin has spent the past year living a normal life in a small Spanish fishing village. There he meets and falls in love with Marta, a young mother of two. He finds himself trying to overcome his former life as a crime lord, only to later find Marta and the two kids murdered by Lady Bullseye and the Hand who then brutally attack him, stabbing him through the shoulders with two katanas. When he asks why, Lady Bullseye replies, &quot;The reasons are far too numerous, but if you want a specific cause, ask Daredevil&quot;. In his revenge against the Hand, the Kingpin frees and recruits the Owl to help him. Fisk begins experiencing hallucinations of his dead wife who taunts him. It turns out that Fisk&#x27;s actual plan is to take the leadership of the Hand, after killing Hiroshi, the ninja-lord who ordered the family&#x27;s assassinations. However, he is thwarted by Daredevil who takes the lead for himself.

===2010s===
During the 2010 &quot;Shadowland&quot; storyline, the Kingpin approaches Iron Fist and Luke Cage, telling the two that they will need to take down Daredevil soon. The Kingpin and Lady Bullseye later perform a ritual that brings back Ghost Rider to attack the Hand. After Daredevil is dethroned from Shadowland, the Kingpin takes both Shadowland and the Hand under his rule, officially taking his place back as the crime lord of New York City.

During the 2010–2011 &quot;Big Time&quot; storyline, the Kingpin hires a new Hobgoblin to steal some experimental vibranium from Horizon Labs.

During the 2011 &quot;Spider-Island&quot; storyline, it is revealed that Fisk has gained spider-powers, as demonstrated by heightened reflexes and the ability to crawl on walls. Like all other New Yorkers, he lost those powers when the situation was resolved.

With Wakanda in a weakened economic position after the destruction of its vibranium stockpile, Kingpin attempts to purchase a controlling interest in the international Bank of Wakanda, with the goal of forcing the Bank to foreclose its current debts by selling its remaining land rights so that they can be exploited for more conventional mineral wealth. Fortunately, T&#x27;Challa becomes aware of this plan in his current role as defender of Hell&#x27;s Kitchen (Matt Murdock needed time away after the events of &quot;Shadowland&quot; and T&#x27;Challa needed to re-learn his capabilities after the loss of his kingdom&#x27;s vibranium), and begins a campaign of attacks against Fisk&#x27;s new forces with the aid of Sam Wilson and Luke Cage. Fisk is so focused on these more public attacks that he misses when Shuri infiltrates and replaces Fisk&#x27;s right-hand-woman, Miyu, giving her full access to Fisk&#x27;s financial databases. Shuri plants a worm in the database that exposes most of Fisk&#x27;s illegal financial transactions, with a final backdoor worm that could expose and ruin what little resources Fisk has left if he ever tries to come after Wakanda again (not wanting to completely take away his money as the heroes know from experience that Fisk will come back but this way he is more focused on protecting what he has left rather than plans for revenge).

====&quot;Marvel NOW!&quot;====
As part of the 2012 &quot;Marvel NOW!&quot; initiative, the Kingpin hears about how Otto Octavius as the Superior Spider-Man has been using brutal methods to take down the local crime families, which would leave a vacuum to fill. The Kingpin&#x27;s Shadowland hideout is attacked by the Superior Spider-Man to which the Kingpin claims that the Superior Spider-Man is much different from the nemesis he had fought. While escaping, the Kingpin kills his doppelgänger Smedley Kornfeld (who was hired for events like this) to fool the Superior Spider-Man.

With his power over New York gone, Fisk set up shop in San Francisco, with the intention of rebuilding his empire there. But the vigilante Shroud acted first, taking control of the local gangs and kidnapped the Owl who also relocated to San Francisco. He transformed Owlsley into a super-computer capable of taking control of all wifi signals to locate his former girlfriend Julia Carpenter. During this time, Daredevil confirmed his secret identity, taking a positive approach to it this time and moved to San Francisco to practice law and continue his superhero career. Fisk began to make moves against both of his enemies, hiring the assassin Ikari to kidnap Foggy and Matt&#x27;s new girlfriend, Kirsten McDuffie, and having his men look for Julia to have leverage against the Shroud. However, the Shroud and Daredevil came into conflict when he and Jubua Pride, the Owl&#x27;s daughter, attempted to free Owlsley. The Shroud then released all private information about Daredevil&#x27;s law practice&#x27;s clients. Daredevil went to Fisk and offered him a deal, he would use his resources to fix his situation and assure Foggy and Kirsten are safe, and in exchange Matt Murdock would fake his death and get a new identity only Fisk would know, giving Kingpin back the power to destroy Daredevil, which he lost when he went public. However, Fisk went with his original plan instead and Ikari kidnapped Nelson and Kirsten. Meanwhile, the Shroud, Pride, and Daredevil crashed when they attempted to get Julia at an airport, allowing Kingpin&#x27;s goons to take her. Fisk presented his hostages when Daredevil confronted him and had him fight Ikari to the death, with Fisk killing one of them if Daredevil wins. The fight took them to the streets, where the Shroud saved Daredevil and killed Ikari. Improvising, Daredevil took Ikari&#x27;s costume and claimed to have killed the hero while the Shroud had the Owl bring to light all of Fisk&#x27;s operations in exchange for his freedom. While Kingpin and Daredevil fought, the federals stormed his building. Daredevil beat down the Kingpin when he tried to flee and rescued the hostages, leaving him in bankruptcy.

During the 2015 &quot;Secret Wars&quot; storyline, the Kingpin hosts a viewing party for the incursion between Earth-616 and Earth-1610 where his guests include Absorbing Man, Bullseye, Norman Osborn, Sandman, and Scorpion. Festivities are interrupted by the arrival of Punisher who reveals that since he cannot take them with him, he has to put his large supply of bullets somewhere; the Punisher then kills them all, before they are resurrected in the reconstituted universe.

When the Purple Children acquired a machine designed by their father to enhance his powers, after Daredevil had saved them from a mob, they used the machine to erase the world&#x27;s knowledge of Matt Murdock&#x27;s identity as Daredevil, including the Kingpin&#x27;s.

====All-New, All-Different Marvel====
As part of the 2015 &quot;All-New, All-Different Marvel&quot;, Wilson Fisk represented Fisk Industries when he attended a meeting at the Universal Bank with Tiberius Stone of Alchemax, Sebastian Shaw of Shaw Industries, Darren Cross of Cross Technological Enterprises, Zeke Stane of Stane International, Shingen Harada of the Yashida Corporation, Frr&#x27;dox of Shi&#x27;ar Solutions Consolidated, and Wilhelmina Kensington of Kilgore Arms where they discussed with Dario Agger about his and Roxxon Energy Corporation&#x27;s plans to exploit the Ten Realms of Asgard. Wilson Fisk also saw the arrival of Exterminatrix of the Midas Foundation, who knocked out Dario and declared herself a new member of their assembly.

During the 2016 &quot;Civil War II&quot; storyline, Kingpin returns from San Francisco, where he ends up in a fight with Bushwacker which ends in Bushwacker&#x27;s apparent death. Afterward, he learns from a barista named Armand that his girlfriend Sonia had gone missing. Kingpin and Turk Barrett track her to a human smuggling business that Man Mountain Marko and Kingpin&#x27;s former minion Janus Jardeesh are working for. Kingpin decides not to kill Janus when he learns that he is a recently emerged Inhuman whose abilities render him undetectable by Ulysses Cain&#x27;s abilities. To test this ability, Kingpin has Janus kill a security guard that Janus knocked out upon discovering the smuggling business.

As part of the 2016 &quot;Marvel NOW!&quot; in a lead-up to the &quot;Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy&quot; storyline, Jackal sends Rhino to Kingpin to get him on his side. He even had Rhino bring a version of Vanessa to persuade Kingpin to go along with the deal. Kingpin snaps the neck of his wife&#x27;s clone, stating, &quot;That&#x27;s not my wife. That&#x27;s an abomination&quot;. Rhino then fights Kingpin, even when Spider-Man shows up. After the resulting fight in which Rhino gets away, Jackal is not pleased that Kingpin declined the offer. Kingpin knows this is a set-up and has a better plan on using Spider-Man to get rid of Jackal. After Spider-Man and Spider-Woman of Earth-65 learn from the New U Technologies staff what had happened to Kaine and Anna Maria Marconi, Kingpin shows up and reveals he has been following the Jackal&#x27;s trail ever since the encounter with his wife. He gives Spider-Man a folder containing the location of a meeting that Jackal will be at so Spider-Man can take down for revenge. Spider-Man is seen beating up most of the Kingpin&#x27;s henchmen at a restaurant in Chinatown. Kingpin tells Spider-Man that he is ready to repay his debt and gives Spider-Man a flash drive that has the location of Norman Osborn.

During the 2017 &quot;Secret Empire&quot; storyline, Kingpin is among the people trapped in a Darkforce-enclosed Manhattan. When some armed robbers raid a church for medical supplies, Kingpin saves the people inside from the armed robbers. Kingpin tells the people to present that they should let people know that he saved them once the crisis is over. He later saves Doctor Strange, Spider-Woman, and Ben Urich from the Elder God Pluorgg by ramming it with his limousine and offers his help to the heroes. After crossing through a monster-filled subway, Kingpin takes the heroes to a witch to acquire weapons to retake the Sanctum Sanctorum, though Doctor Strange argues over the side effects of black magic. Kingpin is then possessed by a demon inside a mask and attacks the heroes until Ben, transformed into a mystical knight, stops him and they come to a truce. They later help Doctor Strange in defeating Baron Mordo, who had been put in charge of New York by HYDRA Supreme Captain America, and retake the Sanctum.

====Mayor of New York City====
After HYDRA&#x27;s defeat, Wilson Fisk is able to use a subsequent election to put himself forward as a last-minute candidate to become the Mayor of New York City, avoiding his criminal past being drawn into the issue by simply ignoring questions about it, aided by the fact that he has never been legitimately charged with anything. With his primary policy being a bill to declare all vigilantes as criminals, and despite Daredevil&#x27;s own recent efforts to create a precedent for superheroes testifying under their secret identities in Washington, he is able to have Daredevil arrested in an FBI sting operation, mocking his old nemesis with the knowledge that the people he protects chose Fisk to &#x27;protect&#x27; &quot;them&quot;, prompting Daredevil to break a window and leap out of Fisk&#x27;s office to begin his own efforts to bring down Fisk&#x27;s empire. Matt Murdock then applied for the position of deputy mayor. Although Daredevil eventually attempts to set up a &#x27;sting operation&#x27; where he and his fellow street-level heroes will capture Mayor Fisk meeting with various gang bosses, Mayor Fisk uses this plan against them and uses the opportunity to arrest all of Daredevil&#x27;s allies, subsequently attempting to provoke Daredevil into attacking him. Although Mayor Fisk is able to arrest Daredevil as well, he is subsequently attacked and left in critical condition by the Hand, with various amendments made to New York&#x27;s constitution by prior administrations putting Matt Murdock in control of the city, once he has escaped from captivity, thanks to the Hand attacking the police van where he was being held, Fisk in critical condition and nobody willing to challenge the legal situation. While Matt Murdock used his skills as Daredevil and the acting mayor to keep the city safe with the street-level superheroes fighting off the Hand, Fisk recovered. Murdock gave Fisk the position of mayor back to him where Fisk had to promise not to do anymore crusades against the vigilantes.

Mayor Wilson Fisk later adopts another daughter, named Princess Fisk, who he briefly sends to go to P.S. 20 Anna Silver, the same elementary school as Lunella &quot;Moon Girl&quot; Lafayette.

Mayor Wilson Fisk later appears as a member of the Power Elite. When Captain America is named as a suspect in the murder of Thunderbolt Ross, he ends up in an argument with Sharon Carter over Captain America&#x27;s innocence.

Mayor Wilson Fisk later had an encounter with Kindred. This demon kills Fisk&#x27;s associates using supernatural abilities and forces him to back off of Peter Parker after revealing that he is in possession of Vanessa Fisk&#x27;s soul.

Operatives of Mayor Wilson Fisk free Electro (Francine Frye) so that she can be part of a female version of the Sinister Syndicate. When the Sinister Syndicate is formed, Mayor Fisk gives them their first mission to capture Boomerang who has stolen something from him. When the Sinister Syndicate catches Boomerang, Beetle contacts Mayor Fisk as she is given information on where the exchange should happen. As the Sinister Syndicate plans to adjourn for the night, they hear Mayor Fisk outside stating that they are harboring a criminal and are to surrender Boomerang to him or suffer the full might of New York City. The Syndicate notices the police, the SWAT Team, the Anti-Super Squad, and low-level bureaucrats. Spider-Man arrives as well and tries to get Mayor Fisk to have the authorities stand down only for Mayor Fisk to claim that Spider-Man fell prey to Boomerang&#x27;s hypnotic boomerang. Electro claims that Spider-Man is buying them some time. After reading the paper in Boomerang&#x27;s hand that belonged to Mayor Fisk, Beetle tells the Syndicate that they should let Boomerang go. While Beetle claimed that she betrayed them, she did it because she is a supervillain and states that she plans to have Mayor Fisk deputize them. The rest of the Syndicate is not up with this plan. The Syndicate then assists Spider-Man against Mayor Fisk&#x27;s forces. Beetle has Spider-Man evacuate Boomerang while the Syndicate fights Mayor Fisk&#x27;s forces while not killing them. The Syndicate is defeated and arrested by the police.

Mayor Wilson Fisk was reunited with his Miles Morales who has become Ultimatum. He was elated to see Ultimatum again while apologizing that he did not find what he was looking for on Earth-1610. Mayor Fisk and Miles begin their next plan together, while opposing a Spider-Man version of Morales from an alternate reality.

===2020s===
During the &quot;Last Remains&quot; arc, Norman Osborn meets up with Mayor Wilson Fisk and his men as they work on a plan to dispose of Kindred for what he did to them. Mayor Wilson Fisk is informed by Norman Osborn that Mary Jane Watson got through to Kindred. After Norman as Green Goblin crashed the confrontation and threw a Pumpkin Bomb near Mary Jane, he gave Mayor Fisk the signal to activate the trap which causes the tomb to be engulfed in darkness. It was revealed that they pulled this off by enlisting the help of Spot who powered Project Blank that was inspired by the Darkforce Dome that once surrounded Manhattan. With Kindred locked up in a special cell in Ravencroft, Norman Osborn stated to Spider-Man that he saved him from Mayor Wilson Fisk. At Ravencroft, Mayor Wilson Fisk talks to Kindred about their encounter in the Parisian catacombs. One of Mister Negative&#x27;s lieutenants appears and informs him that the Inner Demons will help him get more than the Tablet of Life and Destiny.

Mister Negative later meets with Mayor Wilson Fisk and informs him that they will need the sister counterpart of the Tablet of Life and Destiny called the Tablet of Death and Entropy. As Mister Negative has the item, he states to Mayor Fisk that their desired function can only be used when both items are together. Mayor Fisk allows Mister Negative to control Chinatown and the Lower East Side. Outside of enlisting Mister Negative to steal the Tablet of Life and Destiny from Spider-Man and Boomerang, Mayor Fisk has also enlisted the services of the crime lords Black Mariah, a Crime Master, Diamondback, Hammerhead, Madame Masque, Owl, Silvermane, and Tombstone to obtain the Tablet of Life and Destiny where the first crime lord to obtain it will win Mayor Fisk&#x27;s favor. Upon getting his hands on both tablets, Mayor Fisk uses its abilities to revive Richard Fisk as Mayor Fisk realized that Vanessa would not be pleased with her resurrection. He did this as an act of redemption for Vanessa and even himself.

During the &quot;King in Black&quot; storyline, one of Iron Man&#x27;s plans to fight Knull&#x27;s invasion is to persuade Mayor Wilson Fisk to enlist villains to help defend New York City and fight Knull&#x27;s Symbiote army. This leads to Mayor Fisk paying a visit to the Bar with No Name where he asks who would like to earn some money. Kingpin puts together his incarnation of the Thunderbolts with Taskmaster, Mister Fear, Batroc the Leaper, Star, Rhino, Ampere, and Snakehead. When the villain Incendiary turned him down, Mayor Fisk shot him to serve as a warning to anyone that does not take his offer. The assignment he gives them is to take Star to Ravencroft to meet up with the one person who can help defeat Knull.

====Second marriage and retirement====
After Mike Murdock (Matt Murdock&#x27;s magically created criminal twin brother) uses the Norn stone to cement himself into reality by changing the history of the world, he inadvertently makes it so that Mayor Fisk has an illegitimate son (alongside his legitimate son Richard) with Stella Pharris named Byron &quot;Butch&quot; Pharris.

Sometime later, before the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Reign&quot; storyline, Fisk discovers physical evidence proving that he once knew Daredevil&#x27;s true identity, noticing gaps in his own memory after the fact. Outraged, Mayor Fisk confronts Daredevil, who taunts him. Consequentially, Mayor Fisk appoints Butch as New York&#x27;s new Kingpin, outlaws vigilantism in the city, and announces his intent to run for President of the United States. While backed by Senator Arthur Krane of the Friends of Humanity and other people, Fisk also starts the Thunderbolt units to help the NYPD crack down on superhuman vigilantism. He even visits Purple Man in prison and strangles him to submission, and later imprisons him (as he would later do with his children as well) to use him to control people, just like Doctor Doom had done a long time ago, to secure an electoral victory for himself. The few superheroes who were still free, including Captain America, Spider-Man (Ben Reilly), She-Hulk, Luke Cage and Daredevil, began trying to implement ways of defeating Fisk legally, including letting Cage run for mayor.

Blaming Daredevil for his failures, Fisk makes the Purple Man force the population of New York City into attacking the superheroes, while Fisk seeks out Daredevil, having regained his memory of Daredevil&#x27;s identity after the Purple Man was able to suggest how it might have been done as he recognized the influence of his children in the memory wipe. Fisk ends up confronting Mike Murdock, mistakes him for Matt and murders him. In return, he and his now wife Typhoid Mary are attacked by Daredevil and Elektra. Daredevil nearly kills Fisk until Elektra intervenes. Fisk is arrested, but freed by Butch Pharris and several criminal financers who want to install him as President of the United States next. Instead, Fisk kills them, leaves Butch to succeed him as the new Kingpin, and retires from crime with Mary by his side.

During the &quot;Gang War&quot; storyline, Wilson Fisk and Typhoid Mary return to New York City with Hellfire Club troopers in the midst of the eponymous war. After Tombstone and Fisk talk about their respective children and Mary taunts Spider-Man behind Fisk&#x27;s back, a fight breaks out between them as Spider-Man and She-Hulk try to break it up. The fight ends when Fisk gets a call about the situation at Sugar Hill between Beetle and Rose. The armored soldiers work for Fisk as they drag Rose away leaving his minion Digger behind. Fisk and Typhoid Mary leave while cautiously warning Tombstone that Madame Masque is running the Maggia.

==Skills, abilities, and equipment==
While the Kingpin has no superhuman powers, he is incredibly strong and significantly more durable than the average human, possessing remarkable strength concealed by his extremely corpulent appearance. Most of his body mass is actually muscle that has been built to extraordinary size, much like a Super Heavyweight sumo wrestler, or some Olympic weightlifters and powerlifters but at greater strength levels. He has been shown to be strong enough to hurl large men across a room, and leave imprints in concrete walls after punching them. Defying his size, the Kingpin is a master of many forms of armed and unarmed combat, especially sumo wrestling. His signature move is the bear hug. His skill is such that he has once fought Captain America to a standstill in hand-to-hand combat. His daily workout typically consists of simultaneously overcoming five or more trained martial artists with his bare hands, and he stores his valuables in a custom-built safe which has no lock, only a door which is so heavy that only the Kingpin himself is strong enough to open it.

He typically wears Kevlar armor under his clothing. Fisk sometimes carries an &quot;obliterator cane&quot;, a walking stick that conceals a laser weapon that can vaporize a handgun or a person&#x27;s head at close range. He typically wears an ornamental diamond stick-pin that conceals compressed sleeping gas that is effective if sprayed into a victim&#x27;s face. Due to his wealth and intellectual acumen, Kingpin could use far more advanced defensive gadgets, but he prefers to use such things only as a last resort. As Fisk became less Spider-Man&#x27;s enemy and more Daredevil&#x27;s, he was portrayed more as a naturalistic mafioso than a comic book criminal mastermind, and depended less on science fiction–like weaponry.

Although state and federal authorities are aware of the Kingpin, they have never been able to prove his involvement in many crimes, and while Fisk has occasionally been incarcerated or put under investigation, his formidable legal resources and knowledge of the law have always protected him from any serious consequences. Members of the government have worked with him when necessary (even while describing him as &quot;the devil&quot;), such as when they needed his help to dispose of a Manhattan office building that the Beyonder turned into gold.

The Kingpin is intellectually formidable and is a master tactician and a highly skilled planner and organizer. He is self-educated to university graduate level in the field of political science, and is extremely skilled and knowledgeable in the organization and management of both illegal and legal business operations, allowing him to outsmart and outlast his enemies time and time again. The Kingpin&#x27;s willpower is so great that he can resist even the Purple Man&#x27;s mind control.

==Reception==

===&quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot;===
In the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; storyline, Wilson Fisk is known as Dirigible, a wealthy businessman who bought his way into the Marauders, a human terrorist group serving Apocalypse that makes up for their lack of mutant powers using technology which allows them to fly and emit explosive blasts. Dirigible is clearly the leader of the group, as he is seen giving orders to his three teammates. Alongside Red (Norman Osborn), the Owl, and Arcade, he attacks the human refugee camps of Wakanda. However, Dirigible is killed by Gwen Stacy.

===Crossovers with DC Comics===
* In the &quot;Batman &amp; Spider-Man: New Age Dawning&quot; crossover, Kingpin is forced to partner with Ra&#x27;s al Ghul in a plan that would destroy New York City, in exchange for a cure to Vanessa&#x27;s cancer. As it turned out, Ra&#x27;s gave Vanessa her cancer to force Kingpin to aid him, but the Kingpin actually formed an alliance with Batman and Spider-Man to save the city. Ra&#x27;s attempted to get his revenge by denying Fisk the cure for Vanessa&#x27;s cancer, but Talia al Ghul, Ra&#x27;s&#x27; daughter, provided the cure herself, recognizing in Vanessa a kindred spirit, as both of them loved men that society regarded as monsters.
* In the &quot;Batman/Daredevil: King of New York&quot; crossover, Kingpin almost loses his entire criminal empire to the Scarecrow, who tries to dismantle it merely as a distraction so that he could spread his fear toxin throughout New York. In this book, Kingpin is shown to be a formidable physical match for Batman.
* The Amalgam Comics character the Big Question (Enigma Fisk) is a combination of the Riddler of DC Comics and the Kingpin. He appears in the Marvel/DC Comics crossover comic &quot;Assassins&quot; #1 (April 1996).

===&quot;House of M&quot;===

===&quot;Marvel 1602&quot;===
In the &quot;Marvel 1602&quot; universe, Wilson Fiske is a pirate and captain of HMS &quot;Vanessa&quot;, known as the King&#x27;s Pin, who attacks the ship taking Peter Parquarh and Sir Norman Osborne back to England. However, although the attack leaves Osborne wounded, he and the crew are able to take the &quot;Vanessa&quot; when Peter deflects the ship&#x27;s cannonballs by using his webbing to throw them back. Fiske is thrown into the sea to drown when Osborne confronts him directly, rejecting a desperate Fiske&#x27;s &quot;offer&quot; to explain how he got his name.

===&quot;Marvel Noir&quot;===
In the &quot;Marvel Noir&quot; universe, Wilson Fisk appears as a crime lord.

===&quot;Marvel Zombies&quot;===

* He appears in &quot;Marvel Zombies 3&quot; as a leader of the zombie horde, planning to invade Earth-616. He keeps his wife in hiding, satisfying his hunger (and those of other infected characters) by cloning uninfected humans as a source of food, Vanessa noting that his strength of will in controlling the hunger is the reason that he has become the leader of the remaining zombies even when the others have superpowers. Eventually, he eats her when his plan is defeated.
* An alternate version of Kingpin appears in &quot;Marvel Zombies Return&quot;, where he summons the Sinister Six to steal a sacred tablet from the college where Peter Parker attends. But when the zombified Spider-Man is transported to their world, he kills and devours five of the members. An infuriated Kingpin decides to confront Spider-Man, but is quickly dispatched and devoured by Spider-Man, leaving his men to run for their lives.

===MC2===
In the alternate future depicted in the MC2 comics, Fisk has finally succeeded in killing Daredevil, although he made the mistake of betraying Kaine in the process. Kaine attempted to revive Daredevil with sorcery, but ended up bonding him with the demon Zarathos and Reilly Tyne (son of Ben Reilly, the Scarlet Spider), creating the superhero Darkdevil. When a gang war begins, Fisk is slain by a bomb while incarcerated in prison. While dying, he has a vision of his wife and son who show the unrepentant criminal his dark past. The two spirits tell him that he can only come to the &quot;light&quot; if he renounces his criminal past. It is left ambiguous as to what he decided.

===&quot;Old Man Logan&quot;===
In the 2008–2009 &quot;Old Man Logan&quot; storyline, there were different versions of the Kingpin that appear in a possible future timeline in which the United States has been carved up between the various super-villains as seen on Earth-807128 and Earth-21923:

* The first Kingpin is an unnamed African-American man who is described as a &quot;man of the people&quot; who fought his way to the top, gaining control of the western states and killing the domain&#x27;s former master Magneto, who had become &quot;too old&quot; to fight back. He renamed Magneto&#x27;s former territory Kingdom of the Kingpin. Hawkeye&#x27;s daughter Ashley Barton operated as &quot;Spider-Bitch&quot; and opposed Kingpin with her allies who operated as Daredevil and Punisher until Kingpin had the latter two captured and fed to carnivorous dinosaurs. Kingpin is eventually beheaded by Ashley after being freed by her father: striking her father over the head, Ashley reveals that she plans to take over Kingpin&#x27;s territory herself, rather than free its people as he had assumed. Recognized as the new Kingpin by the surrounding guards, Ashley immediately attempts to have her father killed, only for him to be rescued by Logan; Ashley then sends her men after them.
* Ashley returns as the new Kingpin in &quot;Spider-Verse&quot; (2014–2015), &quot;Edge of Venomverse&quot; (2017), &quot;Spider-Geddon&quot; (2018), &quot;Old Man Hawkeye&quot; (2018), and &quot;Old Man Quill&quot; (2019). Her predecessor on Earth-21923 has the same history as the version on Earth-807128.

===&quot;Punisher Kills the Marvel Universe&quot;===
In the one-shot issue &quot;Punisher Kills the Marvel Universe&quot;, the Punisher goes after the Kingpin after Microchip uses his hacking skills to destroy the Kingpin&#x27;s empire. Kingpin informs the Punisher that he supported the latter&#x27;s campaign to kill all of the superpowered beings, and has acquired an armory of weapons for the Punisher&#x27;s use. As the Punisher attempts to shoot the Kingpin with an M16, the Kingpin grabs the rifle and destroys it with his bare hands. The Punisher responds by shooting two Desert Eagle pistols at the Kingpin, which only infuriates him. The Punisher kills the Kingpin by shooting him in the throat, and his body collapses on top of Castle, where he is found and arrested by NYPD officers. The Punisher&#x27;s benefactor breaks him out of prison, whereupon Castle reveals he killed the Kingpin to acquire his high-tech weaponry, specifically a holographic scrambler, which Castle uses to disguise a helicopter as the Fantastic Four&#x27;s Fantasti-car, so he can infiltrate Latveria to kill Doctor Doom.

===&quot;Punisher Max&quot;===
Kingpin appears in a story arc in the MAX version of &quot;The Punisher&quot;, beginning with &quot;Punisher Max&quot; #1, with Bullseye as his main henchman. Like the mainstream version he is incredibly strong, able to squeeze someone&#x27;s head until their eyes pop out. He is a highly formidable hand-to-hand combatant, cunning and utterly ruthless. This version of Fisk is also married to Vanessa and has a son, Richard, who is depicted as a young child. Following Richard&#x27;s death, Fisk and Vanessa separate, with both taking Hand assassin Elektra Natchios as a lover and partner while plotting against the other.

===&quot;Secret Wars&quot;===
During the 2015 &quot;Secret Wars&quot; storyline, there are different versions of Kingpin that reside in the different Battleworld domains:

* In the Battleworld domain of Technopolis, Kingpin is a powerful crime lord who is allied with Arno Stark. Like everyone else in Technopolis, he wears armor to protect him from an airborne virus that has been plaguing Technopolis. He dispatched his men to capture Spyder-Man. Kingpin is critically injured by Grand Marshal James Rhodes&#x27; attack.
* In the Battleworld domain of the Valley of Doom, a Wild West version of Wilson Fisk is the corrupt Mayor of Timely.
* In the Battleworld domain of the Warzone where the 2006 &quot;Civil War&quot; storyline never officially ended, Fisk kills Doctor Octopus and grafts his arms onto himself, but the arms retaliate by electrocuting him, rendering him essentially brain dead. Fisk is later killed by Clint Barton.

===&quot;Spider-Gwen&quot;===

* In the series &quot;Spider-Gwen&quot;, which is set on the alternate Earth-65, Kingpin is seemingly served by his lawyer Matt Murdock. Kingpin and Matt Murdock send the mercenary Aleksei Sytsevich to kill George Stacy. This was done as revenge, for Fisk is currently imprisoned in solitary confinement, due to the efforts of Captain Stacy.
** Matt Murdock (nicknamed Murderdock) is later revealed to be the real Kingpin, with Wilson Fisk serving as his patsy.

===&quot;Spider-Man: Reign&quot;===
Fisk appears in a vegetative state in the first part of &quot;Spider-Man: Reign&quot;.

===&quot;Spider-Verse&quot;===
During the &quot;Spider-Verse&quot; storyline, Wilson Fisk assisted Mysterio and his assistant Ella in a plot to obtain the Spider-Man&#x27;s blood.

====&quot;Spider-Geddon&quot;====
During the &quot;Spider-Geddon&quot; storyline, the Earth-83043 version of Wilson Fisk is the head of Kingliner and secretly orchestrated the airplane crash in the Savage Land that killed Richard and Mary Parker. Years later, Fisk and his ally Ka-Zar the Hunter are poaching dinosaurs when they set off a trap left for them by the Savage Spider-Man. While Fisk did recognize Savage Spider-Man as Peter Parker while confirming the suspicion that someone on the airplane survived, he did reveal his soldiers that were in hiding nearby. Just then, the giant spiders that raised Savage Spider-Man appeared where they attacked Fisk&#x27;s soldiers and the airplane that Fisk is on.

===Ultimate Marvel===
The Ultimate Marvel version of Kingpin is the head of corporate crime in New York, a ruthless murderer and notorious for bribing his way out of any prosecution. His henchmen include The Enforcers and later Electro and Elektra. He is rivaled by fellow crime lord Hammerhead, and briefly Mr. Big. In the first storyline in which he appears, Kingpin unmasks Spider-Man, and later taunts with the knowledge of his nemesis&#x27;s secret identity many times. He also purchases the licensing rights of the &quot;Spider-Man&quot; movie franchise, essentially owning Spider-Man&#x27;s likeness, during his battle with the &quot;Knights&quot; arc. He is ultimately killed by Earth-616&#x27;s Mysterio, who blasts him out of a window of his building after the &quot;Ultimatum&quot; storyline.

In &quot;Ultimate Origins&quot;, Fisk&#x27;s grandfather appears attempting to loot a house with Nick Fury and James Howlett (Wolverine) during World War II.

===Ultimate Universe===
The Earth-6160 version of Wilson Fisk is the Shadow Governor of New York&#x27;s territory and proprietor of the Daily Bugle who is a subordinate of the Maker&#x27;s Council, called &quot;The Kingpin of Manhattan&quot;. Fisk forbids the Bugle from investigating what happened during an attack on Stark Tower, with the intent to hide that it was a false flag orchestrated by the Council. This decision causes J. Jonah Jameson and Ben Parker to resign. Fisk and those with him are later ambushed by the Green Goblin as he starts fighting against his control over New York. Following another attempt on his life, Fisk talks with Henri Duggary, the new ruler of the East Coast, being advised to use the resources they gave him.

It is shown that weeks after the attack, Harry Osborn had a meeting arranged with Fisk, who asked him to help taking care of Stark/Stane&#x27;s assets as they became a political matter in the North American Union due to the power vacuum caused by the fall of the Starks. Harry would later find out that Fisk is an associate of the Council, the real culprits behind the attack. Fisk is later confronted by Spider-Man and Green Goblin. After being hit by one of the Goblin&#x27;s bombs, Fisk was seemingly unharmed due to undergoing body augmentations. This causes them to retreat.

On July, Wilson Fisk meets with Duggary at a secure building, informing him on the current situation as well as Bullseye&#x27;s disappearance. Duggary admits Fisk was right about the vigilante problem and seems convinced that it has grown into a larger threat to the Council since his recent defeat in the hands of Iron Lad and the Ultimates. Fisk is offered a team of his agents, but he refuses stating he has six alternative plans.

At Fisk Tower, Fisk assembles the heads of the other five boroughs of New York in a meeting set up by his assistant James Wesley. It is established that five of his associates control other sectors of the local territory while he manages Manhattan. In the reunion, he briefs Mister Negative (who controls Queens with the Demons gang), Walter Hardy (who controls the Bronx), Kraven the Hunter (who prowls Staten Island), Mysterio (who controls Brooklyn), and Mole Man (who controls the &quot;underground borough&quot;) about the current situation and states they are about to &quot;play a game&quot; involving Spider-Man and Green Goblin.

===What If===
Fisk has appeared in different &quot;What If&quot; stories:

* In &quot;What If the Punisher had Killed Daredevil?&quot;, the Punisher hunts down the Kingpin, who has bribed the newly elected Mayor of New York City into working for him. Since the Punisher had used up the last of his ammo to kill Spider-Man (as his alter ego Peter Parker), the wounded Punisher attacks the Kingpin with a knife, only for the Kingpin to knock the knife out of his hand, and kill him by crushing the Punisher&#x27;s throat with his bare hands. However, Castle had a back-up plan: he left a bomb outside the Kingpin&#x27;s office, which goes off, killing the Kingpin and the Mayor.
* In &quot;What If Venom had Possessed the Punisher?&quot;, the Venom symbiote possessed Frank Castle, who used Venom&#x27;s powers to murder criminals, which had the side effect of merging their personalities. The Kingpin hired Tombstone as an assassin, but the Punisher hunted him down and easily killed Tombstone with his bare hands. When the Punisher confronted the Kingpin, he found Daredevil and Typhoid Mary protecting him. Despite their best efforts to fight off the Punisher, the Venom symbiote used tendrils to envelop and strangle the Kingpin to death.
* In &quot;What If Karen Page Had Lived?&quot; where Bullseye did not kill Karen Page as part of Mysterio&#x27;s final scheme, the fear of losing Karen drove Daredevil to attack the Kingpin for his role in the scheme, beating him to death.

<doc id="387752" wikidata="Q77743902" url="?curid=387752" title="Silanol">
<text>A silanol is a functional group in silicon chemistry with the connectivity Si–O–H. It is related to the hydroxy functional group (C–O–H) found in all alcohols. Silanols are often invoked as intermediates in organosilicon chemistry and silicate mineralogy. If a silanol contains one or more organic residues, it is an organosilanol.

==Preparation==

===From alkoxysilanes===
The first isolated example of a silanol was , reported in 1871 by Albert Ladenburg. He prepared the “silicol” by hydrolysis of (Et = ).

===From silyl halides and related compounds===
Silanols are generally synthesized by hydrolysis of halosilanes, alkoxysilanes, or aminosilanes. Chlorosilanes are the most common reactants:
:R3Si–Cl + H2O → R3Si–OH + HCl

The hydrolysis of fluorosilanes requires more forcing reagents, i.e. alkali. The alkoxysilanes (silyl ethers) of the type are slow to hydrolyze. Compared to the silyl ethers, silyl acetates are faster to hydrolyze, with the advantage that the released acetic acid is less aggressive. For this reason silyl acetates are sometimes recommended for applications.

===By oxidation of silyl hydrides===
An alternative route involves oxidation of hydrosilanes. A wide range of oxidants have been employed including air, peracids, dioxiranes, and potassium permanganate (for hindered silanes). In the presence of metal catalysts, silanes undergo hydrolysis:
:R3Si–H + H2O → R3Si–OH + H2

==Structure and examples==
The Si–O bond distance is typically about 1.65 Å. In the solid state, silanols engage in hydrogen-bonding.

Most silanols have only one OH group, e.g. trimethylsilanol. Also known are some silanediols, e.g., diphenylsilanediol. For sterically bulky substituents, even silanetriols have been prepared.

==Reactions==

===Acidity===
Silanols are more acidic than the corresponding alcohols. This trend contrasts with the fact that Si is far less electronegative than carbon (1.90 vs 2.55, respectively). For Et3SiOH, the p&quot;K&quot;a is estimated at 13.6 vs. 19 for &quot;tert&quot;-butyl alcohol. The p&quot;K&quot;a of is 11. Because of their greater acidity, silanols can be fully deprotonated in aqueous solution, especially the arylsilanols. The conjugate base is called a siloxide or a silanolate.

Despite the disparity in acidity, the basicities of alkoxides and siloxides are similar.

===Condensation and the sol-gel process===
Silanols condense to give disiloxanes:

The conversions of silyl halides, acetates, and ethers to siloxanes proceed via silanols. The sol-gel process, which entails the conversion of, for example, into hydrated , proceeds via silanol intermediates.

==Occurrence==
Silanols exist not only as chemical compounds, but are pervasive on the surface of silica and related silicates. Their presence is responsible for the absorption properties of silica gel. In chromatography, derivatization of accessible silanol groups in a bonded stationary phase with trimethylsilyl groups is referred to as endcapping. Organosilanols occur as intermediates in industrial processes such as the manufacturing of silicones. Moreover, organosilanols occur as metabolites in the biodegradation of small ring silicones in mammals.

==Biorelevance==
Some silanediols and silanetriols inhibit hydrolytic enzymes such as thermolysin and acetylcholinesterase.

==Parent silanols==
Literally, silanol refers to a single compound with the formula (Chemical Abstracts number 14475-38-8). The family (&quot;n&quot; = 1, 2, 3, 4) are highly unstable and are mainly of interest to theoretical chemists. The perhydroxylated silanol, sometimes called orthosilicic acid, is often discussed in vague terms, but has not been well characterized.

The cycle then repeats under a surface pattern of repetitive motifs.

It sees a continuity in Chinese history from early times to the present by looking at the succession of empires or dynasties, implying that there is little basic development or change in social or economic structures. John K. Fairbank expressed the doubts of many historians when he wrote that &quot;the concept of the dynastic cycle... has been a major block to the understanding of the fundamental dynamics of Chinese history.&quot;

==The cycle==
The cycle appears as follows:

#A new ruler founds a new dynasty, and gains the Mandate of Heaven.
#China, under the new dynasty, achieves prosperity.
#The population increases.
# Corruption becomes rampant in the imperial court, and the empire begins to enter decline and instability.
#A natural disaster wipes out farm land. The disaster normally would not have been a problem; however, together with the corruption and overpopulation, it causes famine.
#The famine causes the population to rebel and a civil war ensues.
#The ruler loses the Mandate of Heaven.
#The population decreases because of the violence.
#China goes through a warring states period.
#One state becomes the victor.
#The state starts a new empire.
#The empire gains the Mandate of Heaven.
:::(The cycle repeats itself.)

The Mandate of Heaven was the idea that the monarch was favored by Heaven to rule over China. The Mandate of Heaven explanation was championed by the Chinese philosopher Mencius during the Warring States period.

It has 3 main phases:
#The first is the beginning of the dynasty.
#The second is at the middle of the dynasty&#x27;s life and is the peak of the dynasty.
#The last period is the decline of the dynasty, both politically and economically, until it finally collapses.

==Formation and significance==
Chinese history is traditionally represented in terms of dynastic cycles. According to the Zhou, Yu the Great established the Xia dynasty because Heaven had given him the authority ages earlier. Heaven retracted its decree and gave it to the Shang instead of the Xia when a terrible monarch appeared among them. The Zhou asserted that Heaven was giving them the mandate since Shang rule had also degraded. The idea of a dynasty cycle would become essential to traditional Chinese political philosophy in later periods. While the Qin rejected the dynastic cycle model, some Han-period historians like Ban Gu re-embraced the dynastic model with works like the &quot;Book of Han&quot;, which were regarded as adhering to the correct historical framework established by Confucius, in contrast to Sima Qian&#x27;s &quot;Shiji&quot;. The &quot;Book of Han&quot; would set the model for following dynastic histories.

The Tang was an important period for the evolution of the Chinese historiographical tradition. There were previously various other competing historical visions. Despite being an empire, the Tang chose to institutionalize a historical perspective based on the &quot;Book of Documents&quot; and the &quot;Spring and Autumn Annals&quot;. The writing of history became an official imperial undertaking during the Tang period, in contrast to the more or less individualistic histories of Sima Qian and Ban Gu during the Han period. Writing histories covering the time from the fall of the Han to the establishment of the Tang was one of these undertakings. Each of these states was described as a dynasty that rose and fell in accordance with the moral deeds of its founding and final rulers, respectively. These were all written within a dynastic framework. The main inspiration for producing these histories was Ban Gu&#x27;s &quot;Book of Han&quot;.

Through its long history, the Chinese people have been ruled not by one dynasty, but by a succession of different dynasties. The first orthodox dynasty of China to be described in ancient historical records such as &quot;Shiji&quot; and &quot;Bamboo Annals&quot; is the Xia, which was succeeded by the Shang, although concrete existence of the Xia is yet to be archaeologically proven.

Among these dynasties the Han and Tang are often considered as particularly strong periods, although other dynasties are famous for cultural and other achievements (for instance, the Song dynasty is sometimes associated with rapid economic development). Han and Tang, as well as other long, stable dynasties, were followed by periods of disorder and the break-up of China into small regimes.

Out of disorder a leader eventually arose who unified the country and imposed strong central authority. For example, after the Han various dynasties ruled parts of China until Yang Jian reunited China under the Sui dynasty. The Sui set the scene for the long and prosperous Tang. After the fall of Tang, China again saw a period of political upheaval.

There is a famous Chinese proverb expressed in the 16th-century novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; that says &quot;After a long split, a union will occur; after a long union, a split will occur&quot; (). Each of these rulers would claim the Mandate of Heaven to legitimize their rule.

Although this well-known dynastic periodization of China is more or less based on traditional Sinocentric ideology, it also applies to non-native rulers who sought to gain the Mandate of Heaven. While most ruling dynasties in Chinese history were founded by ethnic Han, there were also dynasties established by non-Han peoples beyond the traditional border of China proper dominated by Han people. These include the Yuan founded by Mongols and the Qing founded by Manchus, who later conquered China proper and assumed the title of Emperor of China.
