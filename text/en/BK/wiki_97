<text>Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovsky (, , né Eidelstein, ; 25 April 1946 – 6 April 2022) was a Russian right-wing populist politician and the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) from its creation in 1992 until his death in 2022. He had been a member of the State Duma since 1993 and leader of the LDPR group in the State Duma from 1993 to 2000, and from 2011 to 2022.

He served as a deputy chairman of the State Duma from 2000 until 2011. He also worked as a delegate in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe from 1996 to 2008. During his lifetime, Zhirinovsky ran in every single Russian presidential election apart from in 2004.

He was known for many controversies, as well as staunch advocacy for Russian military action against NATO.

==Early life and background==
Zhirinovsky was born in Alma-Ata, the capital of the Kazakh SSR, modern-day Almaty, Kazakhstan. His father, Volf Isaakovich Eidelshtein, was a Ukrainian Jew from Kostopil in western Ukraine, and his mother, Alexandra Pavlovna (née Makarova), was an ethnic Russian from Mordovia. Zhirinovsky inherited his surname through Andrei Vasilievich Zhirinovsky, Alexandra&#x27;s first husband. His paternal grandfather was a wealthy industrialist in Kostopil, who owned the largest sawmill in present-day Ukraine and was head of the local Jewish community. His grandfather&#x27;s mill today has an income of $32 million a year, and over the years Zhirinovsky demanded that successive Ukrainian governments return it to him.

In July 1964, Zhirinovsky moved from Almaty to Moscow, where he began his studies in the Department of Turkish Studies, Institute of Asian and African Countries at Moscow State University (MSU), from which he graduated in 1969. Additionally, he studied law and international relations at the Institute of Marxism-Leninism. Zhirinovsky entered military service in Tbilisi during the early 1970s and worked at posts in state committees and unions. He was awarded a Dr.Sci. in philosophy by MSU in 1998.

Although he participated in some reformist groups, Zhirinovsky was not well known in Soviet political developments during the 1980s. While he contemplated a role in politics, a nomination attempt for a seat as a People&#x27;s Deputy in 1989 was quickly abandoned. In 1989, he served as a director of Shalom, a Jewish cultural organization; unknown in Jewish circles before, he is thought to have been invited to join by the Anti-Zionist Committee of the Soviet Public, but subsequently forcefully opposed its influence in the group.

===Jewish heritage===
Four of Zhirinovsky&#x27;s relatives were murdered during the Holocaust. Zhirinovsky&#x27;s parents separated while he was still an infant. Abandoning the family, Zhirinovsky&#x27;s father, Volf Eidelshtein, immigrated to Israel in 1949 (together with his new wife Bella and his brother), where he worked as an agronomist in Tel Aviv. Zhirinovsky&#x27;s father was a member of the right-wing nationalist Herut party in Israel, and died in 1983 when he was run over by a bus near Dizengoff Street in Tel Aviv.

Zhirinovsky did not find out the details of his father&#x27;s life in Israel, or even the fact that he had died until many years later. Zhirinovsky said that he was an Orthodox Christian. In 1994, Zhirinovsky was presented with a birth certificate indicating his original name as Eidelshtein; he claimed that the document was faked.

Zhirinovsky denied his father&#x27;s Jewish origins until &quot;Ivan Close Your Soul&quot;, published in July 2001, in which he described how his father, Volf Isaakovich Eidelshtein, changed his surname from Eidelshtein to Zhirinovsky. He then wrote, &quot;Why should I reject Russian blood, Russian culture, Russian land, and fall in love with the Jewish people only because of that single drop of blood that my father left in my mother&#x27;s body?&quot;

According to Zhirinovsky, &quot;[His] mother was Russian and [His] father was a lawyer&quot;. Zhirinovsky later retracted the statement after researching his father&#x27;s life in Israel. Discussing the statement, Zhirinovsky says: &quot;Journalists mocked me: for saying I was the son of a lawyer. And I am really the son of an agronomist.&quot;

Discussing his father, Zhirinovsky said with tears in his eyes, &quot;All my life I was looking for him. I believed that he was alive. I believed that someday he would find me... But there is a silver lining. I tried to imitate him... And I was able to achieve a certain position in life even without the support of my father.&quot;

Zhirinovsky&#x27;s Israeli relatives included an uncle and cousin, meeting and befriending them for the first time only after discovering more about his family&#x27;s story in Israel. Zhirinovsky&#x27;s Israeli family did not know that he was a politician in Russia but responded warmly to his invitation to stay with him in Moscow.

==Founding of the Liberal Democratic Party and 1991 presidential campaign==
In April 1991, Zhirinovsky, along with Vladimir Bogachev, took initiatives which led to the founding of the Liberal Democratic Party of the Soviet Union, which was the second registered party in the Soviet Union in 1990 and therefore the first officially sanctioned opposition party. According to the former CPSU Politburo member Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev, this party started as a joint project of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) leadership and the KGB.

Yakovlev wrote in his memoirs that KGB director Vladimir Kryuchkov presented the project of the puppet LDPSU party at a meeting with Mikhail Gorbachev and informed him about the selection of the LDPR leader. According to Yakovlev, the name of the party was chosen by KGB General Philipp Bobkov. Bobkov, however stated that he was against the creation of &quot;Zubatov&#x27;s pseudo-party under KGB control that would direct the interests and sentiments of certain social groups&quot;.

Zhirinovsky&#x27;s first political breakthrough came in June 1991, when he came third in Russia&#x27;s first presidential election, gathering more than six million votes (7.81% of the vote). Zhirinovsky&#x27;s populist platform included promises to voters that if he elected, free vodka would be distributed to all. Similarly, he once remarked that if he were made president, underwear would be freely available during a political rally inside a Moscow department store.

==1990s political career==
Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the party was renamed the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia. In 1992 Zhirinovsky made contact with Jean-Marie Le Pen, the then-leader of France&#x27;s Front National (FN). Eduard Limonov of the National-Bolshevik Party introduced the two men to each other and the FN later &quot;provided logistical support [to the LDPR], including computers and fax machines&quot;. Zhirinovsky suggested establishing the International Centre of Right-wing Parties in Moscow and invited Le Pen to visit Moscow.

The Liberal Democratic Party was a significant force in Russian politics, particularly in the early 1990s. At the height of its success, the LDPR gathered 23% of the vote in the 1993 Duma elections and achieved a broad representation throughout Russia – it gained the most votes in 64 out of 87 regions. This fact encouraged Zhirinovsky to once again run for president, this time against incumbent Boris Yeltsin. The fact that Yeltsin&#x27;s candidacy seemed seriously challenged by Russian nationalist groups and a rejuvenated Communist Party alarmed many outside observers, particularly in the Western world, who expressed concern that such developments posed a serious threat to the survival of Russian democracy, which was already in a very fragile state. During the 1990s, commentators described Zhirinovsky as fascist, having fascist tendencies, and a neo-fascist.

During a visit to France in 1994, he said &quot;It&#x27;s all over for you once you&#x27;re Americanized and Zionized&quot;, and threw stones and dirt at Jewish protesters. Michael Specter, in a piece for &quot;The New York Times&quot; published in the same year, said Zhirinovsky&#x27;s &quot;party is not liberal, not democratic, and these days not much of a party&quot;. A 1995 BBC documentary showed Zhirinovsky telling the crowd at a campaign rally: &quot;Help us, and you&#x27;ll never have to vote again! I&#x27;m not saying, &#x27;Vote for us and maybe in 20 years&#x27; time somebody will do something.&#x27; No, these will be the last elections! The last ones!&quot;

The LDPR was less successful in the December 1995 legislative election.

While some observers believed that Zhirinovsky&#x27;s controversial statements were efforts to drum up nationalist support as electoral fodder meant for domestic consumption, there was considerable dismay when in February 1996 (months before a presidential election) Zhirinovsky placed second in opinion polls, behind the Communist Party&#x27;s Gennady Zyuganov and ahead of Yeltsin. In the election, Zhirinovsky placed fifth, with a 5.7% share in the first voting round.

In 1999, his party (running as the &quot;Zhirinovsky Bloc&quot;) fared worse than it had in the previous election.

==Putin-era political career==
Zhirinovsky ran in the 2000 presidential election.

His party&#x27;s fortunes stabilized. In the 2003 election seeing an LDPR vote share of 11.7%, nearly double its 1999 vote share.
In 2004, Zhirinovsky declined to be nominated by the party, leaving that role to Oleg Malyshkin, who received 2% support from voters.

Zhirinovsky ran in the 2008 presidential election, promising a &quot;police state&quot; with summary executions.

Zhirinovsky again ran in the 2012 presidential election. On 6 February 2012, Zhirinovsky released a 30-second election video on the Internet that featured him on a sleigh harnessed to a black donkey representing the country. The video was widely discussed on the Internet, and received mostly negative reactions from Russian users. Organizations like People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) and the World Society for the Protection of Animals (now known as World Animal Protection), as well as Russian animal rights activists, accused Zhirinovsky of cruelty to animals. He responded by saying that similar treatment is commonplace in the Arab world and that the donkey had been treated &quot;better than many people&quot;.

Zhirinovsky was sanctioned by the UK government on 12 September 2014 in relation to actively supporting the use of Russian Armed Forces in Ukraine and annexation of Crimea.

Zhirivinsky ran for president a final time in the 2018 election.

==Views==

Zhirinovsky expressed admiration for the 1996 United States presidential election candidate Pat Buchanan, referring positively to Buchanan&#x27;s comment labelling the United States Congress as &quot;Israeli-occupied territory.&quot; Zhirinovsky said that both the United States and the Russian Federation were &quot;under occupation&quot; and that &quot;to survive, we could set aside places on U.S. and Russian territories to deport this small but troublesome tribe.&quot;

Buchanan strongly rejected this endorsement, saying he would provide safe haven to persecuted minorities if Zhirinovsky were ever elected Russia&#x27;s president, which elicited a harsh response by Zhirinovsky: &quot;You soiled your pants as soon as you got my congratulations. Who are you afraid of, Zionists?&quot;

Scholars of Russia consider him to have a neo-Eurasianist outlook. In addition expressing his concern for Turks and Caucasians displacing the Russian population from their settled territory, Zhirinovsky also advocated for all Chinese and Japanese people to be deported from the Russian Far East. During his 1992 visit to the United States, Zhirinovsky called for &quot;the preservation of the white race&quot; on television and warned that the white Americans were in danger of turning their country over to Black and Hispanic people.

In 2004, Zhirinovsky spoke at the City Court of Saint Petersburg, in reference to the assassination of Galina Starovoytova. After accusing Starovoytova of having worked for foreign intelligence, he said &quot;I have always said openly that for democrats of pro-Western orientation there are only three roads: prison, the grave, and emigration.&quot;

On 23 August 2014, Zhirinovsky said Russia should abolish political parties, instead favouring an autocratic system in which the leader would be chosen by the &quot;five to six thousand wisest people&quot; in the country. He also proposed returning to the Imperial flag and anthem. The proposals were rejected by Putin.

In September 2016, inspired by Donald Trump&#x27;s signature border wall proposal, Zhirinovsky proposed building a border wall and banning Muslims from entering Russia.

===&quot;The Last Break Southward&quot;===
In &quot;The Last Break Southward&quot; (1995), Zhirinovsky described his worldview, which is as follows: &quot;Since the 1980s, I have elaborated a geopolitical conception—the last break southward, Russia&#x27;s reach to the shores of the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean.&quot; This is &quot;really the solution for the salvation of the Russian nation ... It solves all problems and we gain tranquility.&quot;, Russia would rule the space &quot;from Kabul to Istanbul,&quot; and the United States would feel safer with the Russian rule in the region because wars would cease. Perhaps some people in Kabul, Teheran, or Ankara would not like it, but many people would feel better. &quot;The Persians and Turks would suffer a bit but all the rest would gain.&quot;

The &quot;bells of the Orthodox Church must bell from the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean,&quot; and Jerusalem becomes close. It is necessary that &quot;the Christian world reunifies in Jerusalem,&quot; and the Palestinian problem can be solved by partial transfer of the Palestinian population to the former territories of Turkey and Iran. The great Russian language and Russian ruble would wield Near Eastern and Central Asian peoples into one Russian citizenship.

Along the Russia southern sphere from India to Bosporus, other spheres of influence will stretch from north to south in the forthcoming world order, Latin America would be in the American sphere, Africa in the European sphere. and Japan and China will rule Southeast Asia, Indonesia, and Australia. Everywhere &quot;the direction is the same—north-south.&quot; Geopolitically, he saw his position as logical: &quot;Hence, the distribution along such a geopolitical formula would be very beneficent for the whole of humanity, and all over the planet would be established warm and clear political climate.&quot;

&quot;On this occasion, we need a man with at least planetary thinking,&quot; who would realise &quot;the geopolitical formula, guaranteeing the interests of the majority on the planet ... This is the fate of Russia. It is destination, fate ... We must do it, for we have no choice ... This is geopolitics.&quot; We would do it, assured Zhirinovsky alluding to himself, by the efforts of an &quot;honest, perseverant, patriotically inspired President.&quot;

===Foreign relations and military excursions===
Zhirinovsky was known for his boasts pertaining to other countries, having expressed a desire to reunite countries of the ex-Soviet &quot;near abroad&quot; with Russia to within the Russia&#x27;s borders of 1900 (including Finland and Poland). He advocated forcibly retaking Alaska from the United States (which would then become &quot;a great place to put the Ukrainians&quot;), turning Kazakhstan into &quot;Russia&#x27;s back yard&quot;, and provoking wars between the clans and the nations of the former Soviet Union and occupying what would remain of it after the wars. Zhirinovsky, who encouraged separatism within the Russian minority in the Baltic countries, endorsed the forcible re-occupation of these countries and said that nuclear waste should be dumped there.

Zhirinovsky supported Israel-Russia relations, but said that Israel had to make Russian its official language. He also believed Israel has to pay more attention to the Russian Orthodox Church, and that Russians are endangered in Israel and should come under the protection of the Russian police. Zhirinovsky led several official Russian delegations to Israel, on behalf of the Russian government. Visiting Israel, he said that he was concerned mainly about the economic situation for the more than one million Russians living in Israel. He also stated that &quot;Russia will never allow any violence against Israel.&quot;

In the early 1990s, Zhirinovsky proposed setting up large fans on the Russian border to blow airborne radioactive waste into the Baltic states. To eradicate the bird flu, he proposed arming all of Russia&#x27;s population and ordering them and the troops to shoot down migrating birds returning to Russia from wintering.

In 1994, Zhirinovsky sued Finland Swedish politician Jutta Zilliacus and the Swedish Theatre in Helsinki for defamation because Zilliacus had used the word &quot;galenpanna&quot;, or &quot;madcap&quot;, to describe him. In December 1994, the district court of Vantaa, Finland acquitted her.

Also in the 1990s, Zhirinovsky threatened to remove restrictions on arms sales to Iran and proposed selling the disputed Kuril Islands to Japan for US$50 billion.

In 1999, at the start of the Second Chechen War, Zhirinovsky, an ardent supporter of the first war in Chechnya in the mid-1990s, advocated hitting some Chechen villages with tactical nuclear weapons. He also advocated using nuclear weapons and naval blockade-imposed starvation in the event of a Russian war against Japan. In 2008, during the resulting political row between the United Kingdom and Russia, he suggested dropping nuclear bombs over the Atlantic Ocean in an effort to flood Britain.

Zhirinovsky hailed what he described as &quot;the democratic process&quot; in Iraq under Saddam Hussein, whom he supported strongly. The friendship dated from at least the Persian Gulf War in 1991, during which time Zhirinovsky sent several armed volunteers from the &quot;Falcons of Zhirinovsky&quot; group to support the Iraqi president. Allegations dogged Zhirinovsky after the fall of Baghdad asserting that he personally profited from illicit oil sales as part of the Oil-for Food scandal, a charge investigated in 2005 by the Independent Inquiry Committee into the Oil-for-Food Programme (Volcker Commission) and the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI). He was also close to the Serbian nationalist leader Vojislav Šešelj.

In a 2002 video, a drunken Zhirinovsky, hugging two young men, threatened George W. Bush using offensive language against a war in Iraq, promised him a cell in the Butyrka pre-detention facility, and suggested to strike on Tbilisi, or some other targets instead in coalition with Russia. He called the United States a &quot;flea market&quot; filled with &quot;cocksuckers, jerkers, and faggots&quot;, and claimed that Russian scientists were able to change the gravitational field of the Earth and sink the entire country and elect a President in the US loyal to Russia. He mentioned Bill Clinton, Monica Lewinsky, and Condoleezza Rice in the video. Zhirinovsky called Rice &quot;a black whore who needs a good cock. Send her here, one of our divisions will make her happy in the barracks one night. She will choke on Russian sperm as it will be leaking out of her ears ... until she crawls to the US embassy in Moscow on her knees.&quot;

Zhirinovsky said he dreamt of the day &quot;when Russian soldiers can wash their boots in the warm waters of the Indian Ocean and switch to year-round summer uniforms&quot; following Russia&#x27;s conquest of Afghanistan, Iran, and Turkey and occupation of the Persian Gulf and the Mediterranean. He also declared that Bulgaria should annex the Republic of Macedonia, and said that Romania is an artificial state supposedly created by Italian Gypsies who seized territory from Russia, Bulgaria, and Hungary.

The country of Georgia was another frequent target of Zhirinovsky&#x27;s rhetoric. After Aslan Abashidze was ousted from his position as leader of Ajara, an autonomous Georgian region power, in 2004, Zhirinovsky worried that similar revolutions would occur in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Highly critical of Georgia&#x27;s pro-Western line, he was an energetic supporter of the republic of Abkhazia that broke away from the Republic of Georgia. In a high-profile incident in August 2004, he departed on a campaign to promote a tourist season in Abkhazia aboard a cruise ship which was briefly intercepted by a Georgian coast guard vessel.

Zhirinovsky was expelled from Bulgaria for insulting its president and barred from entry in Germany. In 2005, Kazakhstan declared Zhirinovsky &quot;persona non grata&quot; on the territory of his historical homeland, due to his controversial speech about the change of the Russia-Kazakhstan border, in which he questioned the Kazakhs&#x27; place in history.

In 2006, Zhirinovsky became &quot;persona non grata&quot; in Ukraine as well, following his statements regarding the January 2006 Russia–Ukraine gas dispute. His ban was revoked in 2007. In reaction to U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice&#x27;s criticism of Russian foreign policy during the dispute, Zhirinovsky stated, &quot;Condoleezza Rice needs a company of soldiers [and] needs to be taken to barracks where she would be satisfied.&quot;

After the November 2006 death by poisoning of Russian defector Alexander Litvinenko in London, Zhirinovsky said: &quot;Any traitor must be eliminated using any methods. If you have joined the special services to work, then you should work, but to betray, to run away abroad, to give up the secrets you learned while working – all of this looks bad.&quot; Sergei Abeltsev, Zhirinovsky&#x27;s former bodyguard and State Duma member from the LDPR, added: &quot;The deserved punishment reached the traitor. I am sure his terrible death will be a warning to all the traitors that in Russia treason is not to be forgiven. I would recommend to citizen Berezovsky to avoid any food at the commemoration for his criminal accomplice Litvinenko.&quot;

In the 2007 Russian election, political patronage from Zhirinovsky enabled Litvinenko murder suspect Andrei Lugovoi to win election to the Russian parliament and thus obtain formal parliamentary immunity. Zhirinovsky accused Great Britain (according to him, &quot;the most barbaric country on the planet&quot;) of fomenting World War I, the October Revolution, World War II, and the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

After war broke out between Russia and Georgia in 2008, Zhirinovsky argued in favour of Russian recognition of Abkhazian and South Ossetian independence. &quot;We should have taken the whole territory of Georgia under control,&quot; he complained, and &quot;arrested all Georgian officers and taken them here, like to Guantanamo, arrested Saakashvili and handed him over for trial by a military tribunal and gone to the border with Turkey.&quot;

At the premiere of the film &quot;Taras Bulba&quot; in 2009, Zhirinovsky stated: &quot;Everyone who sees the film will understand that Russians and Ukrainians are one people – and that the enemy is from the West&quot;.

Writing about Marine Le Pen, Zhirinovsky in 2011 said that she could out do her father because &quot;Instead of saying that Islam is terrorism, she simply insists that France is a secular nation that will not stand for hundreds of thousands of Muslims practicing their religious traditions. With this argument, Marine has cleverly defended the French people&#x27;s right to a secular nation.&quot; In that vein, Zhirinovsky said that she has the &quot;chance to represent the French majority.&quot;

In 2013, when asked about former Ukrainian prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, Zhirinovsky said, &quot;Yulia Tymoshenko, I&#x27;m sorry, is a woman. I don&#x27;t like them, as it&#x27;s easier to persuade a woman. [...] Women are more compliant, and it&#x27;s dangerous.&quot;

In the wake of the February 2013 Chelyabinsk meteor, Zhirinovsky was quoted by the Russian International News Agency as claiming &quot;It&#x27;s not meteors falling, it&#x27;s the test of a new weapon by the Americans.&quot; At the same time, he derided the Russian Academy of Sciences for anarchism and having scientists so old that their brains and reproductive organs no longer worked, telling the &quot;elders&quot; to go home and collect their pensions.

On 4 April 2014, in the wake of the annexation of Crimea, McDonald&#x27;s fast-food restaurant franchises in Russia were unable to continue operating after being cut off by their Ukrainian franchisor. Zhirinovsky suggested that McDonald&#x27;s &quot;should be evicted from Russia&quot; for the affront. On 25 July, amidst the war in Donbas, the Ukrainian Interior Ministry launched criminal proceedings against Zhirinovsky and Communist Party of the Russian Federation leader Gennady Zyuganov for &quot;financing actions aimed at changing the boundaries of the territory and the state border of Ukraine&quot;. In August, Zhirinovsky threatened Poland and the Baltic states with carpet bombing, dooming them all to be wiped out. He also sent letters to the governments of Poland, Romania and Hungary suggesting that Ukraine be divided between Russia and these three countries.
&quot;What will remain of the Baltics? Nothing will remain of them. NATO airplanes are stationed there. There&#x27;s an anti-missile defense system. In Poland – the Baltics – they are on the whole doomed. They&#x27;ll be wiped out. 
There will be nothing left. Let them re-think this, these leaders of these little dwarf states. How they are leaving themselves vulnerable.

Nothing threatens America, it&#x27;s far away. But Eastern Europe countries will place themselves under the threat of total annihilation. Only they themselves will be to blame. Because we cannot allow missiles and planes to be aimed at Russia from their territories. We have to destroy them half an hour before they launch. And then we have to do carpet bombing so that not a single launch pad remains or even one plane. So – no Baltics, no Poland. Let NATO immediately ask for negotiations with our Foreign Ministry. Then we&#x27;ll stop. Otherwise well have to teach them the lessons of May 1945.&quot;

In May 2015, Zhirinovsky stated that former President of Georgia and then-Odessa governor Mikheil Saakashvili should be killed. &quot;We will shoot all of your governors, starting with Saakashvili, then they&#x27;ll be afraid. And there will be a different situation in Europe and Ukraine. ... Let&#x27;s aim at Berlin, Brussels, London, and Washington.&quot; He then said Ukrainian political prisoner Nadiya Savchenko should be shot and hanged in Belgrade.

In November 2015, after a Turkish F-16 fighter shot down a Russian Sukhoi Su-24M jet near the Syria–Turkey border, Zhirinovsky said in a speech to the Duma that Russia must detonate a nuclear bomb on the Bosphorus to create a 10-meter-high tsunami wave to wipe out at least 9 million Istanbul residents.

In August 2016, Zhirinovsky prayed for the Republican U.S. presidential election nominee, Donald Trump to defeat Hillary Clinton, whom he considered dangerous, in order to take his party&#x27;s ideology global. He also expressed his desire to test his DNA to determine whether he and Trump were related. In September 2016, inspired by Donald Trump&#x27;s border wall policy, Zhirinovsky proposed building a border wall and banning Muslims from entering Russia. In October, Zhirinovsky in an interview said that a vote for Hillary Clinton in the U.S. presidential election was a vote for a third World War, leading to Hiroshimas and Nagasakis everywhere. In contrast, he stated, Trump wouldn&#x27;t care about Syria, Libya, Iraq, and Ukraine, and thus represented a more peaceful alternative.

In April 2017, Zhirinovsky promised to drink champagne if Donald Trump were impeached, saying: &quot;A half of Americans voted for different foreign policies. Trump breaks his promises, and if he continues breaking them, his impeachment is inevitable.&quot; Following the 2021 United States Capitol attack, Zhirinovsky praised Trump and tweeted: &quot;Be brave Donald. We&#x27;re with you, you&#x27;ll get help from abroad.&quot;

In a speech on 27 December 2021, Zhirinovsky appeared to almost predict the day of the Russian invasion of Ukraine of 24 February 2022, stating: &quot;We shouldn&#x27;t saber rattle, [we] need to say: let&#x27;s comply [with the conditions demanded by Russia], and if you refuse , then we can apply another agenda . And which one — you will feel it, at 4 o&#x27;clock in the morning , on February 22. I would wish 2022 to be a peaceful year, but I love the truth, for 75 years I have been telling the truth. It will not be a peaceful year. It will be a year when Russia eventually becomes a great country, and everyone must shut up and respect our country, otherwise they shut our mouth and start exterminate Russians first in Donbass and then in western Russia, so let&#x27;s in this way appreciate a new direction of foreign policy of Russia.&quot;

==Threatening behaviour and assaults==
Zhirinovsky had a history of personal violence in political contexts. In his debate with Boris Nemtsov in 1995, Zhirinovsky threw a glass of orange juice at him on live television. In 2003, he engaged in a fistfight following a television debate with Mikhail Delyagin. In 2005, Zhirinovsky ignited a brawl in parliament by spitting at Rodina party legislator Andrei Saveliyev. In 2008, he showed himself shooting a rifle at targets representing his political rivals.

In 2005, Zhirinovsky, at one of the meetings of the State Duma of the fourth convocation, publicly expressed disagreement with the result of the parliamentary elections in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug, where United Russia won, and demonstratively left the meeting room. Passing by the Rodina faction, he got into an argument with Ivan Viktorov. Viktorov&#x27;s colleague Andrey Savelyev, commenting on the dispute between Zhirinovsky and Viktorov, noted that &quot;spittle is flying&quot;: in response to this, Zhirinovsky spat at Savelyev, and a fight immediately broke out with the participation of members of the LDPR (including Sergey Abeltsev). As NTV channel reporter Alexey Pivovarov reported, some time ago, Savelyev had already had a fight with Zhirinovsky on television during a discussion of a national issue. The then-head of the Rodina faction, Dmitry Rogozin, demanded that Zhirinovsky be deprived of his post as vice-speaker of the State Duma and that a criminal case be opened against him, and Savelyev filed a statement with the prosecutor&#x27;s office.

During the 2008 televised presidential debate, Zhirinovsky threatened Nikolai Gotsa, representative of Democratic Party of Russia candidate Andrei Bogdanov, with violence, saying he was going to &quot;smash his head&quot; and ordering his bodyguard to &quot;shoot that bastard over there in the corridor&quot;. Gotsa sued Zhirinovsky in civil court for 1 million rubles (approximately US$38,000) in damages and was eventually awarded 30,000 rubles (approximately US$1,150).

At an April 2014 press conference in the Duma, Zhirinovsky made violent verbal threats against Stella Dubovitskaya, a pregnant Rossiya Segodnya journalist, who asked him about possible sanctions against Ukraine in the wake of Russia&#x27;s Crimean annexation. When asked whether Russians should reciprocate in kind after Ukrainians initiated a sex strike against Russian men, Zhirinovsky replied that all Ukrainian women were &quot;nymphomaniacs&quot;, and that Dubovitskaya was as well. He then ordered two of his aides to &quot;violently rape&quot; the journalist, who had to be briefly hospitalized for shock. He later apologized, adding that he &quot;spoke a bit rudely when I replied to a young woman&quot;.

In March 2018, male journalist Renat Davletgildeyev accused Zhirinovsky of sexual harassment, despite his public expression of homophobic positions.

==Personal life==
Zhirinovsky married Galina Lebedeva, a lawyer and daughter of a retired general in the early 1970s. The couple had three children: two sons and a daughter.

Ilya Ponomarev has alleged Zhirinovsky was gay in a 2017 interview given in Ukraine. In 1996 openly gay journalist Yaroslav Mogutin suggested it was &quot;a foregone conclusion&quot; that Zhirinovsky was gay, according to Russia&#x27;s gay intelligentsia in &quot;The Advocate&quot;.

Zhirinovsky was a polyglot and was fluent in English, French, German, and Turkish.

===Illness and death===
In February 2022, Zhirinovsky was hospitalized in critical condition in Moscow with COVID-19. In March, he was reportedly placed in a medically induced coma, and underwent treatment for COVID-19 complications such as sepsis and respiratory failure. Zhirinovsky claimed to have been vaccinated against COVID-19 eight times.

On 25 March 2022, Zhirinovsky was reported to have died in a hospital. Despite confirmation from several sources, including his own political party, the news was quickly denied by family members. On 6 April 2022, Vyacheslav Volodin, the Speaker of the Duma, announced that Zhirinovsky had died following a long illness. He was 75. In a statement after Zhirinovsky died, president Vladimir Putin said he &quot;always defended his patriotic position and Russia&#x27;s interests before any audience and in the fiercest of debates&quot;.

Zhirinovsky&#x27;s funeral was officiated by Patriarch Kirill of Moscow and all Rus&#x27; in the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow, at the presence of several high-ranking politicians, including Putin, Volodin and Minister of Defence Sergei Shoigu.

==Legacy==
On 6 April 2023, a monument to Zhirinovsky was unveiled at the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow.

<doc id="392573" wikidata="Q57816" url="?curid=392573" title="Baburam Bhattarai">
<text>Baburam Bhattarai (, ; born 18 June 1954), also known by his nom de guerre Laaldhwoj, is a Nepalese politician, architect and former Prime Minister who presently serves as leader of the Nepal Socialist Party. 

Bhattarai was a long-time leading member and deputy chairman of the Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) prior to founding a new party, Naya Shakti Party, Nepal. He subsequently embraced democratic socialism.

== Political career ==
In 1996, the Maoists started the Nepalese Civil War, which had a huge impact on the political system in Nepal. The decade-long civil war, in which more than 17,000 Nepalese died, had a major role in the transformation of Nepal from a monarchy into a republic. Bhattarai was elected to the Constituent Assembly from Gorkha 1 as a Maoist candidate in 2008 and became Minister of Finance in the cabinet formed after the election.

Bhattarai became Prime Minister in 2011. As a way out of the political deadlock since the dissolution of the first Nepalese Constituent Assembly in May 2012, he was replaced by Chief Justice Khil Raj Regmi as head of an interim government that was to hold elections by 21 June 2013. He was a senior Standing Committee member and vice chairperson of the Maoist party until his resignation from his post and all party responsibilities on 26 September 2015. He was until recently the Coordinator of the Naya Shakti. As of 2019, he was the Chairman of the Federal Council of the newly formed Samajbadi Party, Nepal, a party formed by the merger of the Naya Shakti Party, Nepal and the Federal Socialist Forum, Nepal. Later Samajbadi Party, Nepal merged with Rastriya Janata Party Nepal to form People&#x27;s Socialist Party, Nepal.

===Maoist insurrection===
On 4 February 1996, Bhattarai gave the government, led by Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, from the Nepali Congress, a list of 40 demands, threatening civil war if those were not met. The demands related to &quot;nationalism, democracy, and livelihood&quot; and included an end to the &quot;domination of foreign capital in Nepali industries, business and finance&quot;, abrogation of &quot;discriminatory treaties, including the 1950 Nepal-India Treaty&quot;, and confiscation and distribution of &quot;land under the control of the feudal system to the landless and the homeless&quot;. They started armed movement before the deadline to fulfill the demand given by themselves to the government. After that, and until 26 April 2006, the guerrilla leader Prachanda directed the military efforts of the CPN (M) towards establishing areas of control, particularly in the mountainous regions and western Nepal.

The 40 demands were whittled down to 24 in subsequent political negotiations.

In late 2004 or early 2005, the relations between Prachanda and Bhattarai cooled down. This was reportedly due to disagreement on power sharing inside the party. Bhattarai was unhappy with the consolidation of power under Prachanda. At one point, Prachanda expelled Bhattarai from the party, though he was later reinstated. They later reconciled at least some of their differences.

On 22 November 2005, Prachanda and the Seven Party Alliance released a &quot;twelve-point agreement&quot; that expressed areas of agreement between the CPN(M) and the parties that won a large majority in the last parliamentary election in 1999. Among other points, this document stated that a dictatorial monarchy of King Gyanendra is the chief impediment to progress in Nepal. It claimed further that the Maoists are committed to human rights and press freedoms and a multi-party system of government. It pledged self-criticism and the intention of the Maoists and the Seven Parties to not repeat past mistakes.

===Ceasefires===
Several ceasefires have occurred over the course of the Nepalese civil war. Most recently, on 26 April 2006, Prachanda announced a ceasefire with a stated duration of 90 days. The move followed weeks of massive protests—the April 2006 Nepalese general strike— in Kathmandu and elsewhere that had forced King Gyanendra to give up the personal dictatorship he had established on 1 February 2005 and restore the parliament that was dissolved in May 2002.

After that, a new government was established by the Seven-Party Alliance. The Parliament and the new government supported the ceasefire and started negotiations with the Maoists on the basis of the twelve-point agreement. The two sides agreed that a new constituent assembly will be elected to write a new constitution, and decide the fate of the monarchy. The Maoists wanted this process to end with Nepal becoming a republic of Nepal. 

=== Premiership, 2011-2013 ===

Bhattarai was elected 36th Prime minister of Nepal. Having been elected from UCPN (Maoist). He was elected in support small parties including MJF (Loktantrik), MJF (Republican), TMLP, TMSP and Nepal Sadbhawana Party splinter groups. Bhattarai led the country from 29 August 2011 to 14 March 2013. He did some exemplary works during his tenure including the expansion of ring road.

===Naya Shakti===
On 12 July 2016, Baburam Bhattarai announced the establishment of the Naya Shakti Nepal (New Force Nepal) as a new political party under his leadership. On 24 January, he had announced to establish a new political force. The leaders of Major Parties attended the ceremony. Ashok Sharma, Karishma Manandhar and other 33 new members were announced in that ceremony. He took part in a ceremony announcing an alliance with CPN UML and CPN Maoist centre but left the alliance after two weeks as he was not guaranteed an election ticket.

==Personal life==
Bhattarai was born in Gorkha Belbas in Khoplang VDC. He was born in a low-middle class peasant family. He has three siblings: one elder sister, one younger sister and one younger brother. He belongs to Brahmin group.

He completed his secondary school education from Amar Jyoti High School in Luintel, Gorkha. He was a classmate of Upendra Devkota. He went to high school at Amrit Science College. After that under the Colombo plan scholarship, he studied Bachelor of Architecture in 1977 from Chandigarh. &quot;He had been an outstanding student&quot;, says Lieut-Col Bakshi (retd), Principal of the college. It was during this time he became the founding President of All India Nepalese Student&#x27;s Association. This organization ended up becoming his first step towards building his academic interests outside the field of architecture.

Bhattarai went to the Delhi School of Planning and Architecture for an M.Tech. degree. He is married to Hisila Yami, a fellow Maoist leader. They have a daughter, Manushi.

He completed his PhD degree from Jawaharlal Nehru University in 1986. His thesis was published in 2003 as &quot;The Nature of Underdevelopment and Regional Structure of Nepal - A Marxist Analysis&quot;.

==Publications==
Bhattarai has contributed a number of published works, including &quot;The Nature of Underdevelopment and Regional Structure of Nepal: A Marxist Analysis&quot; (Adroit Publishers, Delhi, 2003) which is a cursory rewriting of his PhD thesis. Other works include &quot;Politico-Economic Rationale of People&#x27;s War in Nepal&quot; (Utprerak Publications, Kathmandu, 1998), and &quot;Nepal! krantika aadharharu&quot; (in Nepali) (Janadisha Publications, 2004). His books and articles have had some impact on Nepalis both at home and abroad, though primarily only on those who share his political beliefs. Among his many well read newspaper articles is &quot;Let&#x27;s Give No Legitimacy to the Beneficiaries of the New Kot Massacre&quot; written in the aftermath of Palace Massacre of 2001. Similarly, it is widely believed that he is the principal author of the most successful Election Manifesto brought out by Communist Party of Nepal (Maoists) in March 2008 in preparation of the Constituent Assembly Election held in April 2008.

<doc id="392579" wikidata="Q2584447" url="?curid=392579" title="Hilbert's seventh problem">
<text>Hilbert&#x27;s seventh problem is one of David Hilbert&#x27;s list of open mathematical problems posed in 1900. It concerns the irrationality and transcendence of certain numbers (&quot;Irrationalität und Transzendenz bestimmter Zahlen&quot;).

==Statement of the problem==
Two specific equivalent questions are asked:
#In an isosceles triangle, if the ratio of the base angle to the angle at the vertex is algebraic but not rational, is then the ratio between base and side always transcendental?
#Is formula_1 always transcendental, for algebraic formula_2 and irrational algebraic formula_3?

==Solution==
The question (in the second form) was answered in the affirmative by Aleksandr Gelfond in 1934, and refined by Theodor Schneider in 1935. This result is known as Gelfond&#x27;s theorem or the Gelfond–Schneider theorem. (The restriction to irrational &quot;b&quot; is important, since it is easy to see that formula_1 is algebraic for algebraic &quot;a&quot; and rational &quot;b&quot;.)

From the point of view of generalizations, this is the case

:formula_5

of the general linear form in logarithms, which was studied by Gelfond and then solved by Alan Baker. It is called the Gelfond conjecture or Baker&#x27;s theorem. Baker was awarded a Fields Medal in 1970 for this achievement.

<doc id="392582" wikidata="Q27040" url="?curid=392582" title="Giovanni Angelo Montorsoli">
<text>Giovanni Angelo Montorsoli (1507 – 31 August 1563), also known as Giovann&#x27;Agnolo Montorsoli, was a Florentine sculptor and Servite friar. He is today as often remembered for his restorations of famous classical works as his original creations.

==Early life==

Giovanni Montorsoli was born in 1507 at Montorsoli, now in the comune of Vaglia, north of Florence, the son of Michele d&#x27;Angelo da Poggibonsi. From 1521 to 1534 he was employed as an assistant to Michelangelo Buonarroti at the Medici Chapel (&quot;Sacrestia Nuova&quot;) and in the Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana at the Basilica of San Lorenzo in Florence. Montorsoli is known to have sculpted &quot;St. Cosmas&quot; with another of Michelangelo&#x27;s assistants, Raffaello da Montelupo, after a model by the master. He became a friar of the Servite Order, but continued to work as a sculptor.

==Work==

In 1532-1533 he produced his &quot;Drunken Satyr&quot;. This sculpture was probably intended for a wall fountain, possibly situated in a niche where the water would have flown from the open neck of the satyr&#x27;s wineskin. This would have been in a style very popular at the time in Rome. Due to the large number of ancient sculptures in Rome, these tended to be utilised rather than commissioning a new figure. However, in Florence ancient statuary was much less common. Montorsoli&#x27;s Satyr, with its classical theme and distinctly classical style, was intended to fill the void.

In 1532 he was summoned by Pope Clement VII to the Belvedere courtyard to restore many of the antique sculptures there. This included the &quot;Laocoön and his Sons&quot; group and the &quot;Belvedere Apollo&quot;. Restoration methods in that era entailed reworking sculptures in accordance with contemporary principles which often were at odds with the aesthetics of antiquity. For instance, Montorsoli included a new right arm in the central figure of the Laocoön group, upraised in a gesture of defiance, adding much to the fame of the sculpture and himself. However, when the original limb was found in 1905 in Rome and reattached to the Laocoön sculpture, replacing Montorsoli&#x27;s work, the original was revealed to be folded at the elbow with considerably less flourish.

In 1547 he left Florence, and went to Messina where he procured a commission for the &quot;Fountain of Orion&quot;, the mythical founder of that city. When erected, the &quot;Orion Fountain&quot; was the tallest and largest of its day and was much admired by Vasari. It is a candelabrum type, like the fountains at the Medici villa at Castello by Tribolo, but it has evolved. The receiving basin is polygonal, contrasting with the circular basins above. The sculpted creatures supporting the second basin are carved in deep relief, but the female nudes above them appear to be carved in the round. They have become sculptures in their own right, and are not just there to decorate the shaft, or to draw the eye upwards to the figure at the summit. This is the candelabrum type at its pinnacle. On polygonal basin&#x27;s rim are the statues of four river gods (Tiber, Nile, Camaro and Ebro) with Latin inscriptions by the scientist-humanist Francesco Maurolico who, probably, was also the creator of most of the Neoplatonic-alchemical program for the fountain. On the perimeter are eight oval reliefs, all with subjects taken from Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;. In 1553 this fountain was finished, and he was commissioned for another fountain - the &quot;Fountain of Neptune&quot;. 

This was a complete break with tradition with regards to fountain design. Previously fountains had mainly been either a basin with a small figure, such as Donatello&#x27;s winged infant and Rustici&#x27;s &quot;Mercury&quot; of 1515, or a wall fountain, or a candelabrum type. The &quot;Fountain of Neptune&quot; (whose original is now in the Interdisciplinary Regional Museum of Messina) is completely different. It is a fountain type with one main raised central figure, and this type had never been done before. The only precedent for it was a design by Benvenuto Cellini for the French King at Fontainebleau. In the middle of the fountain Cellini wanted to erect a &quot;pedestal, projecting somewhat above the margin of the basin, and upon this a nude male figure&quot; which was to represent the King himself as Mars. This never came into being though, and therefore the Neptune at Messina is the first of its type.

The &quot;Fountain of Neptune&quot; makes good use of contrasts. The God of the Sea is arranged in a classical, static pose. Yet below him the figures of the sea monsters Scylla and Charybdis writhe around and draw back in terror. Scylla and Charybdis were the names of rocks near the harbour of Messina; as they had wrecked so many ships, they came to be personified by sea monsters. Neptune&#x27;s act of warding off these destructive forces demonstrates his power and his protection of the city. This work was especially influential in Florence, which had an affection of colossal statuary, and it likely influenced designs for Ammanati&#x27;s &quot;Neptune Fountain&quot; in the Piazza della Signoria. Florentine fountains excelled in designing fountains with many small thin elegant jets of water, even when there was enough water to have a large geyser. Montorsoli carried this Florentine tradition of having smaller, elegant jets, and judging from a design of his in the Uffizi he used eight of them for his design for the Neptune fountain. The &quot;Fountain of Neptune&quot; was finished in 1557. In Messina he also realized the church of San Lorenzo (from 1552; destroyed in the earthquake of 1783), the Lantern Tower (1555) and the &quot;Apostolate&quot; within the Cathedral (completed in 1555, was destroyed several times by fires and earthquakes, and then was rebuilt).

Montorsoli left some of his works in Genoa in the church of San Matteo, commissioned by Andrea Doria, for his tomb and some sculptures. Among his pupils were Giovanni Angelo Lottini and Giovanni Vincenzo Casali.

==The Accademia delle Arti del Disegno==

Montorsoli was instrumental in the foundation in 1562–1563 of the Accademia delle Arti del Disegno, which was the academy of art and of artists in Florence until 1784, and which at first met in the Servite church of the Santissima Annunziata where Montorsoli had worked on the decorations of the Cappella dei Pittori, in which the order had given permission for artists to be buried. The Accademia was formed under the patronage of Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, and with the support of Giorgio Vasari. The first meeting was held on 13 January 1563. Montorsoli died on 31 August of the same year.

<doc id="392585" wikidata="Q315066" url="?curid=392585" title="Plutarco Elías Calles">
<text>Plutarco Elías Calles (born Francisco Plutarco Elías Campuzano; 25 September 1877 – 19 October 1945) was a Mexican politician and military officer who served as President of Mexico from 1924 to 1928. After the assassination of Álvaro Obregón, Elías Calles founded the Institutional Revolutionary Party and held unofficial power as Mexico&#x27;s de facto leader from 1929 to 1934, a period known as the Maximato. Previously, he served as a general in the Constitutional Army, as Governor of Sonora, Secretary of War, and Secretary of the Interior. During the Maximato, he served as Secretariat of Public Education, Secretary of War again, and Secretary of the Economy. During his presidency, he implemented many left-wing populist and secularist reforms, opposition to which sparked the Cristero War.

Born on 25 September 1877 in Sonora, Elías Calles fought in Venustiano Carranza&#x27;s Constitutional Army during the Mexican Revolution, which allowed him to rise in politics, joining the cabinets of Presidents Carranza, Adolfo de la Huerta, and Álvaro Obregón. Obregón selected him as the Laborist Party&#x27;s candidate in the 1924 election. His campaign was the first populist presidential campaign in Mexico&#x27;s history, as he called for land redistribution and promised equal justice, further labor rights, and democratic governance. He won the election and expanded education, implemented infrastructure projects, and improved public health. After this populist phase (1924–1926) he began to persecute the Catholic Church in Mexico (1926–1928), passing several anticlerical laws that resulted in the Cristero War. He allowed CROM&#x27;s Luis N. Morones to consolidate unions under the Laborist Party, and launched a failed attempt to cancel the Bucareli Treaty. Obregón still held significant political sway and was Elías Calles&#x27;s main base of support.

Obregón won the 1928 election but was assassinated as president-elect. Elías Calles prevented political instability by founding the Institutional Revolutionary Party in 1929. During the presidencies of Emilio Portes Gil, Pascual Ortiz Rubio, and Abelardo Rodríguez, Elías Calles served as the kingmaker of Mexican politics, with only Rodríguez able to assert much true influence. During this period, Elías Calles became more ideologically conservative. In 1934, Elías Calles supported Lázaro Cárdenas for president, but Cárdenas exiled him and many of his allies to implement more socialist reforms. Elías Calles was allowed to return to Mexico in 1941, where he died in 1945. His remains are buried in the Monument to the Revolution in Mexico City.

Elías Calles is a controversial figure in Mexican history. Supporters have praised his reforms in areas such as health, infrastructure, and public education, as well as his attempts to separate church and state and to prevent political instability in the wake of Obregón&#x27;s assassination. Detractors have criticized the escalation of the Cristero War, his crackdowns on labor unions, and for continuing to hold onto power after his presidency. The party he founded, including its two subsequent incarnations, established what Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa would describe as &quot;the perfect dictatorship&quot; and ruled Mexico without democratic opposition for much of the twentieth century through a combination of corruption, repression, and electoral fraud.

==Early life and career==
Born Francisco Plutarco Elías Campuzano, he was one of two natural children of his bureaucrat father, Plutarco Elías Lucero, and his mother, María Jesús Campuzano Noriega. He adopted the Calles surname from his mother&#x27;s sister&#x27;s husband, Juan Bautista Calles, as he and his wife, María Josefa Campuzano, raised Plutarco after the death of his mother. His uncle was from a family of school teachers but was himself a small-scale dealer in groceries and alcoholic beverages. Plutarco&#x27;s uncle was an atheist, and he instilled in his nephew a strong commitment to secular education and an attitude of disdain toward the Roman Catholic Church, which was separated from the state during this time. This was later reflected in his social agenda, which included the expansion of public education and the removal of church influence from education, politics, and unions.

Plutarco&#x27;s father&#x27;s family was descended from a prominent family in the Provincias Internas, most often recorded as Elías González. The first of this line to settle in Mexico was Francisco Elías González (1707–1790), who emigrated from La Rioja, Spain, to Zacatecas, Mexico in 1729. Eventually, Francisco Elías González moved north to Chihuahua, where, as commander of the presidio of Terrenate, he played a role in the wars against the Yaqui and Apache. Plutarco Elías Calles&#x27;s father, Plutarco Elías Lucero, lost his own father, José Juan Elías Pérez, in 1865 to battle wounds sustained during the resistance to the French Intervention, leaving his widow with eight children, of which Plutarco was the oldest. The family&#x27;s fortunes declined precipitously; it lost or sold much of its land, some of it to the Cananea Copper Company, whose labor practices resulted in a major strike at the turn of the twentieth century.

Scholars review that his hardships in his upbringing; like his social status as a natural or &quot;illegitimate&quot; child, being an orphan, and financial and familial troubles; have all influenced his path, and made him hardworking and determined to overcome such challenges as the eldest to care for his family. &quot;To society at large, Plutarco Elías Calles was illegitimate because his parents never married, but he was even more so in the eyes of religion. Denying the authority of religion would at least in part be an attempt to negate his own illegitimacy.&quot;

As a young man, Calles worked in many different jobs, from bartender to schoolteacher, and always had an affinity for political opportunities.

==Before the presidency==
===Participation in the Mexican Revolution, 1910–1917===
Calles was a supporter of Francisco I. Madero, under whom he became a police commissioner, and his ability to align himself with the Constitutionalists led by Venustiano Carranza (the political winners of the Mexican Revolution) allowed him to move up the ranks quickly, allowing him to attain the rank of general by 1915. He led the Constitutional Army in his home state of Sonora from this point on. In 1915 his forces repelled the Conventionalist faction in Sonora under José María Maytorena and Pancho Villa in the Battle of Agua Prieta.

===Governor of Sonora===
Calles became governor of his home state of Sonora in 1915, building a pragmatic reformist political record, which was to promote the rapid growth of the Mexican national economy, the infrastructure of which he helped to establish. In particular, he attempted to make Sonora a dry state (a state in which alcohol is heavily regulated), promoted education, legislation giving social security and collective bargaining to workers; organized an economic ground for Mexico.

===Service in the Carranza administration===
In 1919, Calles travelled to Mexico City to take up the post of Secretary of Industry, Commerce, and Labor in the government of President Venustiano Carranza, the leader of the Constitutionalist faction that had won the Mexican Revolution. Calles&#x27;s position put him in charge of the Mexican economy, which had been devastated by the fighting during the Civil War. The two main sources of production, mining, and agriculture, had been severely affected by the fighting. The key infrastructure of Mexican railways, which had linked many cities and production sites in Mexico to the national market and the United States, had been damaged. The national currency in Mexico had been replaced by paper money issued by revolutionary factions without backing by specie. In response to this, many people used the more stable U.S. paper dollars. The lack of currency meant that in agriculture there was no incentive to produce for the market, which led to food shortages. In addition, malnourished populations are more vulnerable to disease, and Mexico suffered from the Spanish flu pandemic. Calles gained political experience in his months serving in Carranza&#x27;s government, and his attempt to settle a labor dispute in Orizaba gained him the support of workers there.

===Revolt of the Sonoran generals, 1920===
In 1920, he aligned himself with fellow Sonoran revolutionary generals Adolfo de la Huerta and Álvaro Obregón to overthrow Carranza under the Plan of Agua Prieta. Carranza had attempted to choose an unknown civilian, Ignacio Bonillas, the Mexican ambassador to the U.S. as his successor. Carranza was forced out of power and died escaping, leaving De la Huerta as interim president. De la Huerta then named Calles to the important post of minister of war.

===Obregón administration, De la Huerta revolt, election of 1924===
Obregón was elected president in 1920 and he named Calles as Secretary of the Interior. During the Obregón presidency (1920–24), Calles aligned himself with organized labor, particularly the Regional Confederation of Mexican Workers (CROM), headed by Luis N. Morones and the Laborist Party, as well as &quot;agraristas&quot;, radical agrarians. 

The serious military conflict was resolved in favor of Obregón when the U.S. threw its support to him. Obregón&#x27;s government had acceded to concessions to U.S. business interests, particularly oil, in the August 1923 Bucareli Treaty. Obregón pushed through ratification in the Mexican Congress, and the U.S. then moved decisively. President Calvin Coolidge sent naval ships to blockade the Gulf Coast to both prevent the rebels from obtaining arms and deliver arms to Obregón&#x27;s government. Obregón went to war once again and won a decisive victory against his former comrades-in-arms, 14 of whom were summarily executed. 

Calles&#x27;s candidacy was supported by labor and peasant unions. The Laborist Party which supported his government in reality functioned as the political-electoral branch of the powerful Regional Confederation of Mexican Workers (CROM), led by Luis N. Morones. Morones had a national reputation as a labor leader and had allied with Samuel Gompers, head of the American Federation of Labor, a moderate craft union organization. In 1916 Gompers and Morones put pressure on the Mexican and U.S. governments, which were heading toward war. In Mexico, Morones was credited with aiding the withdrawal of U.S. troops in Mexico sent by U.S. president Woodrow Wilson. CROM&#x27;s support for Calles was important for his election. Although the labor movement in Mexico was factionalized, CROM was a staunch supporter of Obregón and Calles.

In 1924, Calles won the election. 

Shortly before his inauguration, Calles had traveled to Germany and France to study social democracy and the labor movement and he drew comparisons to Mexico. His international travel gave him a perspective beyond the Mexican context. He particularly admired the infrastructure and industry in Germany, as well as the strides that a strong organized labor movement had made. He also observed the power of populist rhetoric to build support.

==Presidency, 1924–1928==
Calles&#x27;s inauguration was a great state occasion, with some 50,000 spectators. His predecessor, Obregón, was present for the first peaceful transfer of presidential power since 1884 when Porfirio Díaz succeeded Manuel González. Workers from the CROM, headed by Luis Morones and the Laborist Party of Mexico displayed banners. The release of balloons and doves figured in the spectacle. The De la Huerta rebellion had thinned the ranks of the military.

Although Calles was president, he remained in the shadow of Obregón, who had powerful allies in the military and among state governors and the Congress. The contrast between Calles and Obregón was in personality and level of power. &quot;To many, Calles appeared Obregón&#x27;s creation, a caretaker president who would return power to the caudillo upon the conclusion of his term.&quot; Calles sought to build his own power base. He launched a reform program that was modeled on the one in Sonora. It intended to promote economic development, professionalize the army, and promote social and educational welfare. He relied on worker and peasant organizations to support his consolidation of power, particularly Luis N. Morones of the CROM.

===Labor===
Morones was appointed to a cabinet position as Secretary of Industry, Commerce, and Labor at the same time that he retained leadership in the CROM. In that position, Morones was able to advance his organization at the expense of rivals. Some independent unions and more radical were forced into the umbrella of the moderate CROM. Wage increases and betterment of working conditions were evidence that Calles sought to implement Article 123 of the Mexican Constitution, embedding labor rights. The number of labor strikes decreased precipitously during the Calles administration. When railway workers struck in 1926, Morones sent scabs to break the strike.

===Finance===
During the Calles presidency, he relied on the financial acumen of his secretary of the treasury, Alberto J. Pani, a loyalist of Obregón, and served in his cabinet. Pani&#x27;s classical liberal policies of a balanced budget and stable currency helped restore foreign investors&#x27; confidence in Mexico. Pani advised the founding of several banks in support of campesinos, but more importantly, the Banco de México, Mexico&#x27;s national bank. Pani also managed to achieve relief of part of Mexico&#x27;s foreign debt. After coming into conflict with Calles, Pani resigned in 1927.

===Military===

The military continued to be very top-heavy with revolutionary generals and the army allocated a third of the national budget. Generals had participated in the De la Huerta rebellion in 1923, which cleared the way for Calles&#x27;s candidacy. Obregón awarded loyalists following that revolt. The military continued to be a potential interventionist force in Mexican politics, with generals presuming that they could rise to the presidency. Calles sought to professionalize the army and decrease its share of the national budget, putting Joaquín Amaro in charge of implementing major changes. Many generals had achieved their status as battlefield promotions. The Calles administration called for a change in the law regulating the military, mandating that officers must have professional training to rise in rank. The administration also aimed to decrease corruption by severely penalizing it. Further control was a mandatory retirement age for officers. The most powerful generals were not reined in by such provisions, but Amaro managed to get some cooperation with their enforcement of regulations on subordinates. The Colegio Militar was reformed under Amaro and remained a hope for the improvement of officers.

===Infrastructure===
Since the Porfiriato, railroads have been important to economic development and exerting political control over more remote areas. Fighting during the Revolution damaged railways, so rebuilding had been ongoing since the end of the military phase. Calles privatized the railways and a line was built to connect Sonora, Calles&#x27;s home state, and Mexico City. Even more important, during his presidency, Calles began what became a major infrastructure project to build a road network in Mexico that linked major cities and small villages to the network. He established the National Road Commission as a government agency, envisioning it as a way to increase economic activity by getting crops to market more efficiently, but also as a means to increase the presence of the state in remote communities. Unlike the nineteenth-century railway network, funded by foreign capital and foreign firms, Mexican road construction depended on federal government support and had limited dependence on foreign technology. Mexicans formed road-building companies, most prominently in northern Mexico with revolutionary general Juan Andreu Almazán, in the 1920s charge of the military in Nuevo León, forming the Anáhuac Construction Company, making him a wealthy man. This extensive infrastructure project &quot;connected the country, increasingly linking people from different regions and towns to national political, economic, and cultural life.&quot; Work began on the Mexican section of the Pan-American Highway, linking Nuevo Laredo at the U.S.-Mexico border to Tapachula on the Mexico-Guatemala border. Road building was financed internally with a gasoline tax.

===Education===
Education had been an important part of Obregón&#x27;s administration, particularly under José Vasconcelos. Calles was able to devote more government funding to rural education and added two thousand schools to the thousand that his predecessor had established. A key aim of rural education was to integrate Mexico&#x27;s indigenous population into the nation-state, so Spanish-language instruction was an integral aspect of public education. Along with turning rural indigenous into Spanish speakers, education aimed to create a loyal and patriotic citizenry. Secretary of Education José Manuel Puig Cassauranc developed education materials lauding the accomplishments of Sonorans Obregón and Calles as heirs to the Revolution. The Secretariat of Public Education, based in the capital and controlled by urban intellectuals, could not command rural residents and public school teachers to adhere to the program, so on-site, there was a kind of negotiation about how education was shaped.

===Public health===
After the Revolution, public health in Mexico was not in a good state, but it had not been particularly good even during the Porfiriato. The Calles administration sought to improve health and hygiene since the health of citizens was considered important to economic development. He gave the issue prominence by creating a cabinet-level position in public health. The ministry was in charge of promoting vaccination against communicable diseases, improving potable water access, sewage and drainage systems, and inspecting restaurants, markets, and other food providers. A new 1926 sanitary code ordered mandatory vaccination and empowered the government to implement other measures for sanitation and hygiene. Also part of the program was the mandatory registration of prostitutes.

===Civil law===
Calles changed Mexico&#x27;s civil code to give natural (illegitimate) children the same rights as those born of married parents, partly as a reaction against the problems he himself often had encountered being a child of unmarried parents. According to false rumors, his parents had been Syrians or Turks, giving him the nickname &quot;El Turco&quot; (The Turk). His detractors drew comparisons between Calles and the &quot;Grand Turk&quot;, the anti-Christian leaders from the era of the Crusades. In order not to draw too much attention to his unhappy childhood, Calles chose to ignore those rumors rather than to fight them.

Another important legal innovation in Calles&#x27;s presidency was the Law of Electrical Communications (1926), which asserted the radio airwaves as being under government regulation. Radio stations had to comply with government regulations, which included constraints on religious or political messages, and had to broadcast government announcements without cost. Although in the 1920s, there were relatively few people owning radios, the regulations were an important assertion of state power. During the Lázaro Cárdenas presidency (1934–40), state control over broadcasts expanded further.

===Petroleum and U.S.-Mexico relations===
One of the major points of contention with the U.S. was oil. Calles quickly rejected the Bucareli Agreements of 1923 between the U.S. and Mexico, when Álvaro Obregón was president, and began drafting a new oil law that would strictly enforce article 27 of the Mexican constitution. The oil problem stemmed from Article 27 of the Mexican Constitution of 1917, which re-stated a law of Spanish origin that made everything under the soil property of the state. The language of Article 27 threatened the oil possession of U.S. and European oil companies, especially if the article was applied retroactively. A Mexican Supreme Court decision had ruled that foreign-owned fields could not be seized as long as they were already in operation before the constitution went into effect. The Bucareli Agreements stated that Mexico would agree to respect the Mexican Supreme Court decision in exchange for official recognition from Washington of the presidency of Álvaro Obregón.

The reaction of the U.S. government to Calles&#x27;s intention to enforce Article 27 was swift. The American ambassador to Mexico branded Calles a communist, and Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg issued a threat against Mexico on 12 June 1925. Calles never considered himself a communist; he considered revolution a way of governing rather than an ideological position. Public opinion in the United States turned particularly anti-Mexican when the first embassy of the Soviet Union in any country was opened in Mexico. On that occasion, the Soviet ambassador remarked that &quot;no other two countries show more similarities than the Soviet Union and Mexico.&quot; After this, some in the United States government, considering Calles&#x27;s regime Bolshevik, started to refer to Mexico as &quot;Soviet Mexico&quot;.

The debate on the new oil law occurred in 1925, with U.S. interests opposing all initiatives. By 1926, the new law was enacted. In January 1927 the Mexican government canceled the permits of oil companies that would not comply with the law. Talks of war circulated by the U.S. president and in the editorial pages of the &quot;New York Times&quot;. Mexico managed to avoid war through a series of diplomatic maneuvers. Soon afterward, a direct telephone link was established between Calles and President Calvin Coolidge, and the U.S. ambassador to Mexico, James R. Sheffield, was replaced with Dwight Morrow. Morrow won the Calles government over to the United States position and helped negotiate an agreement between the government and the oil companies.

Another source of conflict with the United States was Mexico&#x27;s support for the liberals in the civil war in Nicaragua, as the United States supported the conservatives. This conflict ended when both countries signed a treaty in which they allowed each other to support the side they considered to be the most democratic.

===Church-state conflict===
According to historian Robert Weis:Against claims that revolutionaries sought to destroy the church, officials insisted that they pursued the rule of law. During his presidential campaign, Calles clarified that he was not an &quot;enemy of religion&quot;; he approved of &quot;all religious beliefs because [he] consider[ed] them beneficial for the moral progress that they encompass.&quot; He was, however, an enemy of &quot;the political priest, the scheming priest, the priest as exploiter.&quot; This position of lauding religion while inveighing against earthly ecclesiastic machinations was central...to the justification of the anticlerical campaign in general. As president, Calles expressed determination to enforce the laws of the 1917 constitution that mandated secular education, banned foreign priests as well as confessional political parties and newspapers, nationalized all church properties, and granted local governments the authority to limit the number of priests.

Calles had implemented several reforms in the first two years of his presidency (1924–26) benefiting workers and peasants. In this, he followed the pattern of his predecessor, Obregón. However, in the second two years of his presidency and into his post-presidency, Calles precipitated a major conflict between the Mexican government, the Roman Catholic Church in Mexico as an institution, and Mexican Catholics. Calles did not recognize the freedom to join the church.

During his term as president, he moved to enforce the anticlerical articles of the Constitution of 1917, which led to a violent and lengthy conflict known as the Cristero Rebellion or the Cristero War, which was characterized by reprisals and counter-reprisals. The Mexican government violently persecuted the clergy, massacring suspected Cristeros and their supporters. The conflict ended in 1929 with the mediation of the U.S. ambassador to Mexico, Dwight Morrow with the Mexican government and the Vatican.

On 14 June 1926, President Calles enacted anticlerical legislation known formally as The Law Reforming the Penal Code and unofficially as the Calles Law. Calles&#x27;s anti-Catholic actions included outlawing religious orders, preventing corruption from the Church. However, Catholic antipathy towards Calles was enhanced because of his vociferous anti-Catholicism. In response to the government&#x27;s enforcement of anticlerical laws, the Catholic Church called for a clerical strike, which entailed ceasing to celebrate Mass, baptize children, sanctify marriage, and perform rituals for the dead. The clerical strike went on for three years.

Due to Calles&#x27;s strict enforcement of anti-clerical laws, people in strongly Catholic areas, especially the states of Jalisco, Zacatecas, Guanajuato, Colima and Michoacán, began to oppose him, and on 1 January 1927, a war cry went up from the faithful Catholics, &quot;¡Viva Cristo Rey!&quot;, long live Christ the King!

Almost 100,000 people on both sides died in the war. A truce was negotiated with the assistance of U.S. ambassador Dwight Morrow in which the Cristeros agreed to lay down their arms. Particularly offensive to Catholics after the truce was Calles&#x27;s insistence on a complete state monopoly on education, taking away focus from the Catholic education and introducing secular education in its place, saying: &quot;We must enter and take possession of the consciences of the children, of the consciences of the young, because they do belong, and should belong to the revolution.&quot;

The effects of Calles&#x27;s policy on the Church were between 1926 and 1934. At least 4,000 priests were killed or expelled; one of the most famous was the Jesuit Miguel Pro. Where there had been 4,500 priests in Mexico before the rebellion, in 1934 there were only 334 priests licensed by the government to serve fifteen million people, the rest having been eliminated by emigration, expulsion, execution, and assassination. By 1935, seventeen states had no priests at all.

The conflict weakened Calles politically, and that weakness paved the way for Alvaro Obregón to return to the presidency in the 1928 election.

==1928 election==
Obregón ran unopposed in the 1928 presidential election. He was able to stand as a candidate despite having served as president before. Under Calles&#x27;s administration in 1926, a constitutional change was passed that allowed for a non-consecutive re-election, and in 1928 Obregón was elected as Calles&#x27;s successor; this amendment was later repealed in 1934. In addition, Mexico passed an amendment to the constitution in 1927 that expanded a presidential term from four years to six years.

==Post-presidency==
===Attempted arrest in Texas===
In December of 1929, District Attorney John Valls of Laredo, Texas, sent a telegram to US secretary of state Henry Stimson notifying the federal government of Valls&#x27;s intent to arrest Calles on a warrant for the 1922 murder of Lucio Blanco. Stimson replied that the government would take any steps necessary to guarantee Calles&#x27;s diplomatic protections, including armed force; Calles was escorted across the border back into Mexico by US marines without incident, though Valls promised that &quot;the day of reckoning was only postponed.&quot;

In protest of this treatment, the Mexican consulate in Laredo was closed, restricting the flow of tourists and merchandise during the holiday season. The consulate was reopened in January after pressure from President Hoover and the Chamber of Commerce led Texas governor Moody and Laredo city officials to offer assurances that Mexican citizens would not be unlawfully molested.

=== Founding a new party and the &quot;Maximato&quot; 1929–1934 ===


President-elect Obregón was murdered by José de León Toral, a Catholic militant, before he could assume power. Calles was ineligible to return to the presidency, but he took steps to avoid a political vacuum. Emilio Portes Gil was appointed temporary president, while Calles created a new political party, the National Revolutionary Party (, PNR), the predecessor of today&#x27;s Institutional Revolutionary Party (, PRI).

The period that Obregón had been elected to serve, between 1928 and 1934, was when Calles was requested to come in as an advisor but was instead considered the &quot;Jefe Máximo&quot;, the &quot;maximum chief,&quot; and the power behind the presidency; and was a title he never used for himself. The period is known as the &quot;Maximato&quot; (1928–1934), with many regarding Emilio Portes Gil, Pascual Ortiz Rubio, and Abelardo Rodríguez as puppets of Calles. Officially, after 1929, Calles served as minister of war as he continued to suppress corruption. Still, a few months later, after the intervention of the United States ambassador Dwight Morrow, the Mexican government and the Cristeros signed a peace treaty. During the Maximato, Calles served as Minister of Industry and Commerce. 

After a large demonstration in 1930, the Mexican Communist Party was banned, Mexico stopped its support for the rebels of César Sandino in Nicaragua, strikes were no longer tolerated, and the government ceased re-distributing lands to poorer peasants. Calles was the candidate of the workers and all for helping those in need of work, campaigning against competing labor organizers, but still opposed and suppressed Communism.

By the summer of 1933, two of Calles&#x27;s former wartime subordinates had risen to the top of the party: Manuel Pérez Treviño and Lázaro Cárdenas. Calles mentored Treviño and supported him to be the party&#x27;s nominee at the time, teaching his experiences and policies, but soon yielded to pressure from party officials and agreed to support Cárdenas—a former revolutionary general, governor of Michoacán, and popular land reformer—as the PNR&#x27;s presidential candidate in the 1934 Mexican Presidential election. By this time, the PNR had become so entrenched that Cárdenas&#x27; victory was a foregone conclusion; he won with almost 98 percent of the vote.

===End of the &quot;Maximato&quot; and exile===
Cárdenas had been associated with Calles for over two decades; he had joined Calles&#x27;s army in Sonora in 1915. For that reason, Calles and his allies trusted Cárdenas, and Calles believed he could work with Cárdenas as he had with his predecessors. Cárdenas soon asserted himself as an independent. Conflicts between Calles and Cárdenas arose not long after Cárdenas was sworn in. Calles opposed Cárdenas&#x27;s support for labor unions, especially his tolerance and support for strikes, while Cárdenas opposed Calles&#x27;s view.

Cárdenas started to isolate Calles politically, removing the &quot;callistas&quot; from political posts and exiling many of his political allies: Tomás Garrido Canabal, Fauto Topete, Emilio Portes Gil, Saturnino Cedillo, Aarón Sáenz, Nicolás Rodríguez Carrasco, Pascual Ortiz Rubio and finally Calles himself. Calles and head of the labor organization CROM, Luis N. Morones, one of the last remaining influential &quot;callistas&quot; and one-time Minister of Agriculture, were charged with conspiring to blow up a railroad and placed under arrest under the order of President Cárdenas. These were false accusations, framing Calles to exile him. Calles was deported to the United States on 9 April 1936 along with the three last highly influential &quot;callistas&quot; in Mexico—Morones, Luis León (leader of the Radical Civic Union in Mexico), and General Rafael Melchor Ortega (one-time Governor of Guanajuato). His son Alfredo and his secretary were also exiled.

In exile in the United States, Calles was with family and lived in San Diego. During this time, he also befriended José Vasconcelos, the Mexican philosopher who had previously been a political enemy.

===Return from exile and final years===
With the Institutional Revolutionary Party now firmly in control and in the spirit of national unity, President Manuel Ávila Camacho (1940–1946) allowed Calles to return to Mexico under the reconciliation policy of Cárdenas&#x27;s successor in 1941. He spent his last years quietly in Mexico City and Cuernavaca.

Back in Mexico, Calles&#x27;s political position became more moderate; in 1942, he supported Mexico&#x27;s declaration of war upon the Axis powers. Upon his return to Mexico, he became interested in spiritualism, attending weekly sessions at the Mexican Circle of Metapsychic Investigations, and coming to profess belief &quot;in a Supreme Being&quot;.

He died in Mexico City at 14:20 CST (20:20 GMT) on 19 October 1945, at age 68, of a hemorrhage after surviving surgery earlier that week.

==Personal life==
Calles married Natalia Chacón (1879–1927) and the marriage produced 12 children. Rodolfo Elías Calles (1900–1965), governor of Sonora 1931–34; Plutarco Elías Calles Chacón(&quot;Aco&quot;), (1901–1976), governor of Nuevo León 1929; Bernardina (died in infancy); Natalia (1904–1998); Hortensia (&quot;Tencha&quot;) (1905–1996); Ernestina (&quot;Tinina&quot;) (1906–1984); Elodia (1908), died in infancy; María Josefina (1910), died in infancy; Alicia (1911–1988); Alfredo (1913–1988); Artemisa (1915–1998); and Gustavo (1918–1990). After his first wife&#x27;s death in 1927, he married a young woman from Yucatán, Leonor Llorente, who died of a brain tumor in 1932 at age 29. Calles&#x27;s own health was not good over his lifetime, and in his later years deteriorated. His problems date from the winter of 1915 when he came down with a rheumatic ailment, likely from extended periods outdoors in sub-freezing temperatures. He also experienced stomach problems and insomnia. The death of his wife Natalia in 1927 was a severe blow personally. Although he remarried in 1930, his second wife Leonor died soon afterwards.

==Legacy==

Calles&#x27;s main legacy was the pacification of Mexico, ending the violent era of the Mexican Revolution through the creation of the Partido Nacional Revolucionario (PNR)—known today as the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI)—which governed Mexico until 2000 and returned to power for one term in the elections of 2012.

Calles&#x27;s legacy remains controversial today, but within the PRI it has undergone a re-appraisal. His remains were moved from their original resting place to be interred in the Monument to the Revolution, joining other major figures, Madero, along with Carranza, Villa, and Cárdenas who in life were his political opponents. For many years, the presidency of Cárdenas was touted as the revival of the ideals of the Revolution, but increasingly the importance of Calles as the founder of the party that brought political stability to Mexico has been recognized. When the son of Lázaro Cárdenas broke with the PRI in 1988, the party leadership began to acknowledge Calles&#x27; contributions and leadership as the party&#x27;s founder. In 1990, a monument to Calles was erected that commemorated his September 1928 speech declaring the end of the age of &quot;caudillos&quot;. His speech was made in the aftermath of Obregón&#x27;s assassination and as the political solution to violence at presidential successions was being resolved by the party he brought into being.

He is honored with statues in Sonoyta, Hermosillo, and his hometown of Guaymas. The official name of the municipality of Sonoyta is called Plutarco Elías Calles Municipality in his honor.

For his actions that portray him as anti-clerical, Calles was denounced by Pope Pius XI (r. 1922–1939) in the encyclical &quot;Iniquis afflictisque&quot; (&quot;On the Persecution of the Church in Mexico&quot;) as being &quot;unjust&quot;, for a &quot;hateful&quot; attitude and for the &quot;ferocity&quot; of the war which he waged against the Church.

<text>In geometry, a degenerate conic is a conic (a second-degree plane curve, defined by a polynomial equation of degree two) that fails to be an irreducible curve. This means that the defining equation is factorable over the complex numbers (or more generally over an algebraically closed field) as the product of two linear polynomials.

Using the alternative definition of the conic as the intersection in three-dimensional space of a plane and a double cone, a conic is degenerate if the plane goes through the vertex of the cones.

In the real plane, a degenerate conic can be two lines that may or may not be parallel, a single line (either two coinciding lines or the union of a line and the line at infinity), a single point (in fact, two complex conjugate lines), or the null set (twice the line at infinity or two parallel complex conjugate lines).

All these degenerate conics may occur in pencils of conics. That is, if two real non-degenerated conics are defined by quadratic polynomial equations and , the conics of equations form a pencil, which contains one or three degenerate conics. For any degenerate conic in the real plane, one may choose and so that the given degenerate conic belongs to the pencil they determine.

== Examples ==

The conic section with equation formula_1 is degenerate as its equation can be written as formula_2, and corresponds to two intersecting lines forming an &quot;X&quot;. This degenerate conic occurs as the limit case formula_3 in the pencil of hyperbolas of equations formula_4 The limiting case formula_5 is an example of a degenerate conic consisting of twice the line at infinity.

Similarly, the conic section with equation formula_6, which has only one real point, is degenerate, as formula_7 is factorable as formula_8 over the complex numbers. The conic consists thus of two complex conjugate lines that intersect in the unique real point, formula_9, of the conic.

The pencil of ellipses of equations formula_10 degenerates, for formula_5, into two parallel lines and, for formula_3, into a double line.

The pencil of circles of equations formula_13 degenerates for formula_14 into two lines, the line at infinity and the line of equation formula_15.

== Classification ==
Over the complex projective plane there are only two types of degenerate conics – two different lines, which necessarily intersect in one point, or one double line. Any degenerate conic may be transformed by a projective transformation into any other degenerate conic of the same type.

Over the real affine plane the situation is more complicated. A degenerate real conic may be:

* Two intersecting lines, such as formula_16 
* Two parallel lines, such as formula_17 
* A double line (multiplicity 2), such as formula_18
* Two intersecting complex conjugate lines (only one real point), such as formula_19 
* Two parallel complex conjugate lines (no real point), such as formula_20 
* A single line and the line at infinity
* Twice the line at infinity (no real point in the affine plane)

For any two degenerate conics of the same class, there are affine transformations mapping the first conic to the second one.

== Discriminant ==

Non-degenerate real conics can be classified as ellipses, parabolas, or hyperbolas by the discriminant of the non-homogeneous form formula_21, which is the determinant of the matrix

:formula_22

the matrix of the quadratic form in formula_23. This determinant is positive, zero, or negative as the conic is, respectively, an ellipse, a parabola, or a hyperbola.

Analogously, a conic can be classified as non-degenerate or degenerate according to the discriminant of the &quot;homogeneous&quot; quadratic form in formula_24. Here the affine form is homogenized to
:formula_25
the discriminant of this form is the determinant of the matrix
:formula_26

The conic is degenerate if and only if the determinant of this matrix equals zero. In this case, we have the following possibilities:

* Two intersecting lines (a hyperbola degenerated to its two asymptotes) if and only if formula_27 (see first diagram).
* Two parallel straight lines (a degenerate parabola) if and only if formula_28. These lines are distinct and real if formula_29 (see second diagram), coincident if formula_30, and non-existent in the real plane if formula_31.
* A single point (a degenerate ellipse) if and only if formula_32.
* A single line (and the line at infinity) if and only if formula_33 and formula_34 and formula_35 are not both zero. This case always occurs as a degenerate conic in a pencil of circles. However, in other contexts it is not considered as a degenerate conic, as its equation is not of degree 2.

The case of coincident lines occurs if and only if the rank of the 3×3 matrix formula_36 is 1; in all other degenerate cases its rank is 2.

==Relation to intersection of a plane and a cone==

Conics, also known as conic sections to emphasize their three-dimensional geometry, arise as the intersection of a plane with a cone. Degeneracy occurs when the plane contains the apex of the cone or when the cone degenerates to a cylinder and the plane is parallel to the axis of the cylinder. See Conic section#Degenerate cases for details.

== Applications ==
Degenerate conics, as with degenerate algebraic varieties generally, arise as limits of non-degenerate conics, and are important in compactification of moduli spaces of curves.

For example, the pencil of curves (1-dimensional linear system of conics) defined by formula_37 is non-degenerate for formula_38 but is degenerate for formula_39 concretely, it is an ellipse for formula_40 two parallel lines for formula_41 and a hyperbola with formula_42 – throughout, one axis has length 2 and the other has length formula_43 which is infinity for formula_44

Such families arise naturally – given four points in general linear position (no three on a line), there is a pencil of conics through them (five points determine a conic, four points leave one parameter free), of which three are degenerate, each consisting of a pair of lines, corresponding to the formula_45 ways of choosing 2 pairs of points from 4 points (counting via the multinomial coefficient).
For example, given the four points formula_46 the pencil of conics through them can be parameterized as formula_47 yielding the following pencil; in all cases the center is at the origin:
* formula_48 hyperbolae opening left and right;
* formula_49 the parallel vertical lines formula_50
* formula_51 ellipses with a vertical major axis;
* formula_52 a circle (with radius formula_53);
* formula_54 ellipses with a horizontal major axis;
* formula_55 the parallel horizontal lines formula_56
* formula_57 hyperbolae opening up and down,
* formula_58 the diagonal lines formula_59
:(dividing by formula_60 and taking the limit as formula_61 yields formula_62)
* This then loops around to formula_63 since pencils are a &quot;projective&quot; line.
Note that this parametrization has a symmetry, where inverting the sign of &quot;a&quot; reverses &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;. In the terminology of , this is a Type I linear system of conics, and is animated in the linked video.

A striking application of such a family is in which gives a geometric solution to a quartic equation by considering the pencil of conics through the four roots of the quartic, and identifying the three degenerate conics with the three roots of the resolvent cubic.

Pappus&#x27;s hexagon theorem is the special case of Pascal&#x27;s theorem, when a conic degenerates to two lines.

== Degeneration ==
In the complex projective plane, all conics are equivalent, and can degenerate to either two different lines or one double line.

In the real affine plane:
* Hyperbolas can degenerate to two intersecting lines (the asymptotes), as in formula_64 or to two parallel lines: formula_65 or to the double line formula_66 as &quot;a&quot; goes to 0.
* Parabolas can degenerate to two parallel lines: formula_67 or the double line formula_68 as &quot;a&quot; goes to 0; but, because parabolae have a double point at infinity, cannot degenerate to two intersecting lines.
* Ellipses can degenerate to two parallel lines: formula_69 or the double line formula_70 as &quot;a&quot; goes to 0; but, because they have conjugate complex points at infinity which become a double point on degeneration, cannot degenerate to two intersecting lines.

Degenerate conics can degenerate further to more special degenerate conics, as indicated by the dimensions of the spaces and points at infinity.
* Two intersecting lines can degenerate to two parallel lines, by rotating until parallel, as in formula_71 or to a double line by rotating into each other about a point, as in formula_72 in each case as &quot;a&quot; goes to 0.
* Two parallel lines can degenerate to a double line by moving into each other, as in formula_73 as &quot;a&quot; goes to 0, but cannot degenerate to non-parallel lines.
* A double line cannot degenerate to the other types.
* Another type of degeneration occurs for an ellipse when the sum of the distances to the foci is mandated to equal the interfocal distance; thus it has semi-minor axis equal to zero and has eccentricity equal to one. The result is a line segment (degenerate because the ellipse is not differentiable at the endpoints) with its foci at the endpoints. As an orbit, this is a radial elliptic trajectory.

== Points to define ==

A general conic is defined by five points: given five points in general position, there is a unique conic passing through them. If three of these points lie on a line, then the conic is reducible, and may or may not be unique. If no four points are collinear, then five points define a unique conic (degenerate if three points are collinear, but the other two points determine the unique other line). If four points are collinear, however, then there is not a unique conic passing through them – one line passing through the four points, and the remaining line passes through the other point, but the angle is undefined, leaving 1 parameter free. If all five points are collinear, then the remaining line is free, which leaves 2 parameters free.

Given four points in general linear position (no three collinear; in particular, no two coincident), there are exactly three pairs of lines (degenerate conics) passing through them, which will in general be intersecting, unless the points form a trapezoid (one pair is parallel) or a parallelogram (two pairs are parallel).

Given three points, if they are non-collinear, there are three pairs of parallel lines passing through them – choose two to define one line, and the third for the parallel line to pass through, by the parallel postulate.

Given two distinct points, there is a unique double line through them.

<text>Haddenham is a village and civil parish in west Buckinghamshire, England. It is about south-west of Aylesbury and north-east of Thame in neighbouring Oxfordshire. At the 2011 Census, the population of the civil parish was 4,502.

==History==
The place-name &quot;Haddenham&quot; is derived from the Old English &quot;Hǣdanhām&quot;, &quot;Hǣda&#x27;s Homestead&quot; or, perhaps &quot;Hǣdingahām&quot;, &quot;the home of the Hadding tribe&quot;. It is possible that the first villagers were members of the Hadding tribe from Haddenham in Cambridgeshire. It may be that the first Anglo-Saxons to settle in the Vale of Aylesbury were followers of Cuthwulf, from Cottenham in Cambridgeshire, who, according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles, marched southwest to the Thames after routing the British at the Battle of Bedcanford in 571. The Domesday Book of 1086 records the manor as &quot;Hedreham&quot;. In 1142 it was recorded as &quot;Hedenham&quot;.
From the Norman conquest of England until the Dissolution of the Monasteries the Convent of St Andrew in Rochester, Kent held the manor. The Crown held the manor for the remainder of the reign of Henry VIII. Thereafter it passed to his daughter Elizabeth I.

The village had a Royal charter as a market town between 1294 and 1301. The market was short-lived because the influential manor of Thame objected to losing trade to Haddenham.

Haddenham was long a stronghold of radicalism and in particular of the Buckinghamshire Farm Labourers Union established in 1872 by Edward Richardson of Dinton.

Haddenham used to have several more pubs than today. The Anchor and the Eight Bells at Church End are now private houses. The Waggon and Horses in High Street was converted into the Peking Rendezvous Chinese restaurant, but closed in 2013. The Red Lion in Church End also closed in 2013. A developer applied for planning permission to demolish the Red Lion and replace it with housing, but in 2014 Aylesbury Vale District Council rejected the application. The Green Dragon on Churchway, more recently converted into restaurant Twist at the Green Dragon, was officially closed when planning permission was granted to make it a private residence. The Rose and Thistle also permanently closed in 2019.

In 1906 the Great Western Railway opened the railway through the parish, with Haddenham railway station to serve the village. In 1963 British Railways closed the station but kept the line open. In 1987 BR opened station at a new site, a few hundred yards west of the old one. The railway is part of what is now the Chiltern Main Line.

== Architecture ==
Haddenham is one of only three &quot;wychert (or whitchet) villages&quot; in England. Wychert is a method of building with a white clay mixed with straw to make walls and buildings, which are then thatched or topped with red clay tiles.

Haddenham War Memorial, situated near the village pond at Church End, is a Grade II Listed Building.

=== Churches ===
The Church of England parish church of St Mary the Virgin is of 12th-century Norman origin but parts of may still remain from its first building, which was Saxon. William II granted the parish to the Benedictine abbey of Rochester, Kent.

There is also a Roman Catholic church, and Baptist and Methodist chapels. 

The Haddenham Methodist Church is built of wychert. One of the walls of the church collapsed on July 4, 2001, but was rebuilt, amid a call from the vicar to demolish the existing church and rebuild it with new materials due to the high cost of maintaining wychert buildings. Haddenham Museum, which opened in 1998, is in the Methodist Chapel schoolroom.

=== Turn End ===
Turn End is a listed garden and group of houses designed by architect and resident Peter Aldington and built in the 1960s. The group of three houses was awarded the Royal Institute of British Architects award for Architecture in 1970. In 1998 the houses were listed at Grade II by English Heritage; the listing was upgraded to II* in 2006. 

In 1999, the book &quot;A Garden and Three Houses&quot; about Turn End was published – in the foreword, Peter Shepheard writes that &quot;these houses and their gardens stand mature as a rare example of how to add modern houses to an ancient village without a hint of suburbia&quot;.

Turn End Trust, formerly Turn End Charitable Trust, is a registered charity that operates an educational programme comprising greater public access to both Turn End house and garden; garden workshops, walks and tours; architectural visits and talks.

==Economy and amenities==

Haddenham is known for its ponds which were used to breed Aylesbury ducks. Breeding has been revived recently on the pond in front of the parish church.

Haddenham has two pubs: the Kings Head and the Rising Sun. One former pub, House of Spice (Indian, formerly The Crown), is now a restaurant. There are three cafés: Little Italy at the station, Norsk at Fort End and Tickety Brew on the Parade.

Haddenham has a baker, a greengrocer, a barber shop, three hairdresser&#x27;s and some smaller retailers. Haddenham has also a garden centre and a farm shop, further hosting amenities such as a florist, pet shops, a charity shop, and a tattoo parlour. Haddenham has two gyms: FitLife and The Garage, also at Bradmoor.

Haddenham has an industrial estate next to the small grass-strip airfield, a commercial district, and Haddenham and Thame Parkway railway station on the Chiltern Main Line that links , Oxford railway station and London Marylebone.

Haddenham has a community Infant School, Haddenham Junior School and the voluntary aided Haddenham St Mary&#x27;s Church of England School. Haddenham is in the catchment area for Prince Risborough upper school and grammar schools: Aylesbury Grammar School, Aylesbury High School and Sir Henry Floyd Grammar School in Aylesbury.

Also in Haddenham is Tiggywinkles, the animal welfare charity and veterinary hospital, and the village hosts a biannual charity beer festival.

===Haddenham NAG===
Haddenham is policed by the Haddenham and District Neighbourhood Policing team based at the police station in Waddesdon. They work with the community via the Haddenham Neighbourhood action group. Representatives from the various villages in the area meet every six weeks to discuss neighbourhood priorities and to put forward plans to reduce crime.

===Haddenham in transition===

The village has a transition group, part of the Transition network that organises activities to improve the community&#x27;s resilience and awareness of the changes to living standards, energy and resource security. The group was founded as Transition Thame and District but in autumn 2010 refocussed on Haddenham and in February 2011 became officially recognised as a transition initiative.

==Notable people==
Haddenham is the birthplace of British composer Doreen Carwithen (1922–2003).

The astronomer William Rutter Dawes (1799–1868) had his home and private observatory in the village from 1857 to 1868.

The architect Peter Aldington (1933–present) and his wife Margaret have their home in Turn End. He is one of a very select group of architects branded by English Heritage as the &quot;living listed&quot; and together with John Craig founded his own practice in the village in 1970.

Peter Parrott, an RAF pilot who fought in the Battle of Britain, was born in Haddenham.

==Media==
Haddenham has been the setting for a number of television programmes including &quot;Jeeves and Wooster&quot;, &quot;Rosemary &amp; Thyme&quot; and eight episodes of &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot;.

The village appears in the second Muppet film, &quot;The Great Muppet Caper&quot;. Having been forced to fly in an aeroplane&#x27;s baggage hold, Kermit the Frog, Fozzie Bear and Gonzo are thrown out of the plane and land in Haddenham&#x27;s Church End pond.

The duck pond has recently been used as a backdrop for a Halifax advert featuring the Thunderbirds.

The duck pond area in Haddenham was recently used to film episodes of Pennyworth which tells the story of Alfred Pennyworth, Bruce Wayne&#x27;s Butler from DC&#x27;s Batman Universe.

Scenes for a further streaming series of &quot;Citadel&quot; were filmed in November 2024 around Skittles Green and Church End where these locations stood in for Scotland (according to a crew member).

<text>Nadi (pronounced ; ) is the third-largest conurbation in Fiji. It is located on the western side of the main island of Viti Levu, and had a population of 42,284 at the most recent census, in 2007. A 2012 estimate showed that the population had grown to over 50,000. Nadi is multiracial with many of its inhabitants Asians, Indian or Indigenous Fijians, along with a large transient population of foreign tourists. Along with sugar cane production, tourism is a mainstay of the local economy.

The Nadi region has Fiji&#x27;s highest concentration of hotels and motels. With its large Indo-Fijian population, Nadi is a centre for Hinduism in Fiji. It has the largest Hindu temple in the Southern hemisphere, a site for pilgrims called Sri Siva Subramaniya temple.

Nadi International Airport, located 9 kilometres from Nadi, is the largest airport in Fiji. Thus, Nadi is the principal port of entry for air travelers to Fiji, even though it is on the opposite (western) side of the island of Viti Levu from the nation&#x27;s capital and largest city, Suva.

==History==
During World War II the US Navy built a base at Nadi as part of Naval Base Fiji. Nadi Township was established in 1947. About that time the colonial government of Fiji established offices on the higher grounds of Nadi. A few businesses were then established around the government offices to service them, and other business organisations from other parts of Fiji followed suit. Some concerned citizens of Nadi attempted to move the town centre to Martintar because the existing centre was prone to flooding, but this did not eventuate because the move Nadi Township had already developed strong roots in its existing location.

Elective local government was introduced in 1967 by Dr A. H. Sahu Khan, and was the first elected Chairman of the Nadi Township Board. With the introduction of the Local Government Act in 1972, the status of the Board was changed to a Town Council. H. M. Lodhia became the first Mayor of Nadi in 1972 and remained in office until December 1973. The most recent Mayor of Nadi was Councillor S. Sami. At present, elected municipal government in Nadi (and also throughout Fiji) is suspended, and government-appointed Administrators are carrying out the functions normally fulfilled by the City Council.

In 1986, the Sri Siva Subramaniya Temple was opened in Nadi. It remains the largest Hindu temple in the Pacific in a style of Dravidian architecture.

==Government and infrastructure==
The Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji (CAAFI) head office is at Nadi Airport in Nadi.

==Economy==
Fiji Airways, formerly Air Pacific has its head office at the Air Pacific Maintenance &amp; Administration Centre at Nadi International Airport in Nadi. Fiji Airlines Limited, operating as Pacific Sun, is headquartered in the Pacific Sun building in the Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji (CAAFI) compound at Nadi International Airport.

Nadi&#x27;s economy is driven by tourism, transportation and real estate sectors. Within these formal industries, the informal sector plays a relatively small role, mainly consisting of tourism and agricultural businesses, including handicrafts.

==Education==
*Korovuto College

==Local government ==
Nadi Town is governed by the Nadi Town Council (NTC). The council is headed by a Special Administrator, appointed by the central government, and managed by a Chief Executive Officer (CEO). Both posts answer to the Ministry of Local Government, Urban Development, Housing and Environment. The performance of the Special Administrator is evaluated often, and the position has clear objectives such as improving rates collection and shifting from cash to accrual accounting in council operations. Nevertheless, overlap between the CEO and the Special Administrator posts is leading to confusion, resulting in high staff turnover – there have been three CEOs appointed since 2008.

==Housing ==
Housing development in Nadi largely takes the form of either medium-density complexes or lower-density social housing. Of this latter, the Housing Authority is actively seeking to increase the supply of affordable housing. The number of housing estates in Nadi has grown quickly, especially on the town periphery, such that housing estates now comprise 20 per cent of the total housing stock in Nadi. 

==Climate==
Nadi has a tropical monsoon climate according to the Köppen climate classification, with hot temperatures year round. The city features a short dry season during the months of July and August, and a lengthy wet season covering the remaining months of the year. It receives substantially less precipitation than Suva on the windward side of Fiji.

<text>Dan O&#x27;Neill (born April 21, 1942) is an American underground cartoonist, creator of the syndicated comic strip &quot;Odd Bodkins&quot; and founder of the underground comics collective the Air Pirates.

== Education ==
O&#x27;Neill attended the University of San Francisco, making contributions to the &quot;San Francisco Foghorn&quot;, the school newspaper.

==&quot;Odd Bodkins&quot;==

&quot;Odd Bodkins&quot; began its run in 1964 in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; when O&#x27;Neill was 21 years old. The strip consisted of the adventures of Hugh and Fred Bird. During the course of the strip&#x27;s run, it increasingly reflected O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s life in and his critique of 1960s counterculture. Though he considered himself a strong writer, O&#x27;Neill said of his artwork, &quot;I had a very weak line. Either that or palsy.&quot;

As &quot;Odd Bodkins&quot; became increasingly political, O&#x27;Neill feared that the &quot;Chronicle&quot;, which held the strip&#x27;s copyright, would fire him and hire another artist. The &quot;Chronicle&quot; had axed &quot;Odd Bodkins&quot; a few times already, but it had been reinstated following reader protests. O&#x27;Neill decided on an odd tactic to regain control of his strip: he would engage in copyright infringement, which he reasoned would force the paper to surrender the strip&#x27;s copyright back to him for fear of being sued. O&#x27;Neill worked 28 Walt Disney characters, including Mickey Mouse and Pluto, into the strip. In late November 1970, the &quot;Chronicle&quot; fired O&#x27;Neill for the final time but did not continue to run the strip.

In 1972, during O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s legal battles with Disney over &quot;Air Pirates Funnies&quot;, the &quot;Chronicle&quot; finally transferred the copyright of &quot;Odd Bodkins&quot; back to O&#x27;Neill.

===Air Pirates and Disney lawsuit===
O&#x27;Neill decided to become an underground comic book mogul and gathered other young artists into a collective called the Air Pirates, whose members included Bobby London, Gary Hallgren, Shary Flenniken and Ted Richards. Their two-issue series &quot;Air Pirates Funnies&quot; included parodies of Mickey Mouse and other copyrighted characters, which led to a famous lawsuit by The Walt Disney Company. O&#x27;Neill took the lead in fighting the suit, promoting it as a free-speech case in his &quot;Mouse Liberation Front&quot; campaign. He and Richards were the last Air Pirates to settle with Disney after a long, highly publicized and expensive legal battle. Although criticized for engaging in a legal conflict that seemed pointless, O&#x27;Neill had no regrets taking this stand on principle, saying, &quot;Doing something stupid once is just plain stupid. Doing something stupid twice is a philosophy.&quot;

==Other work==
In the midst of the Disney lawsuit, O&#x27;Neill traveled to Ireland and later to Wounded Knee, South Dakota, where he pioneered the genre of comic strip journalism with &quot;The Penny-Ante Republican&quot;, a four-page, single-sheet comic which sold for one cent, and which told stories of O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s experiences with the Irish Republican Army and the American Indian Movement. For this work, the 11th international Congress of Cartoonists and Animators would present him with the Yellow Kid Award in 1975.

O&#x27;Neill later drew a short-lived, full color strip for the &quot;National Lampoon&quot; about the adventures of the Bat-winged Hamburger Snatcher, and returned to the &quot;Chronicle&quot; with a weekly strip, titled simply &quot;O&#x27;Neill&quot;, which ran from 1980 to 1985. The final year of &quot;O&#x27;Neill&quot; was reprinted in &quot;Comics Revue&quot;.

Dan O&#x27;Neill was one of twenty-two artists and writers featured in the documentary &quot;Comic Book Confidential&quot;. He was interviewed while playing pool next to two scantily clad women. He describes his career as &quot;if you&#x27;re going down in flames you might as well hit something big.&quot;

In 2008, he appeared in the documentary film &quot;RiP!: A Remix Manifesto&quot;, which discussed the negative effects of copyright laws. O&#x27;Neill stated that he made fun of Disney in large part because they were the worst at using lawsuits to stifle parodies, spoofs, and other fair use commentaries.

== Awards ==
* 1975 Yellow Kid Award
* 1975 Grand Guinigi: Best Foreign Artist
* 1979 Inkpot Award

==Personal life==
O&#x27;Neill currently lives in Nevada City, California, where he continues to draw &quot;Odd Bodkins&quot; and is a director in the Original Sixteen to One gold mine.

<text>Heinkel Flugzeugwerke () was a German aircraft manufacturing company founded by and named after Ernst Heinkel. It is noted for producing bomber aircraft for the Luftwaffe in World War II and for important contributions to high-speed flight, with the pioneering examples of a successful liquid-fueled rocket and a turbojet-powered aircraft in aviation history, with both Heinkel designs&#x27; first flights occurring shortly before the outbreak of World War II in Europe.

==History==
Following the successful career of Ernst Heinkel as the chief designer for the Hansa-Brandenburg aviation firm in World War I, Heinkel&#x27;s own firm was established at Warnemünde in 1922, after the restrictions on German aviation imposed by the Treaty of Versailles were relaxed. By 1929, the firm&#x27;s compressed air-powered catapults were in use on the German Norddeutscher Lloyd ocean-liners and to launch short-range mail planes from the liners&#x27; decks. 

The company&#x27;s first post-World War I aircraft design success was the design of the all-metal, single-engined Heinkel He 70 &quot;Blitz&quot; high-speed mail plane and airliner for Deutsche Luft Hansa in 1932, which broke a number of air speed records for its class. It was followed by the two-engine Heinkel He 111 &quot;Doppel-Blitz&quot;, which became a mainstay of the Luftwaffe during World War II as a bomber. Heinkel&#x27;s most important designers at this point were the twin Günter brothers, Siegfried and Walter, and Heinrich Hertel. 

The firm&#x27;s headquarters was in Rostock later known as &quot;Heinkel-Nord&quot; (Heinkel-North), located in what used to be named the &quot;Rostock&quot;-&quot;Marienehe&quot; neighborhood (today&#x27;s &quot;Rostock&quot;-&quot;Schmarl&quot; community, along the west bank of the Unterwarnow estuary), where the firm additionally possessed a factory airfield along the coastline in the Rostock/Schmarl neighborhood roughly three kilometers (1.9 miles) north-northwest of the main offices, with a second &quot;Heinkel-Süd&quot; engineering and manufacturing facility in Schwechat, Austria, after the Anschluss in 1938.

===World War II===
The Heinkel company is most closely associated with aircraft used by the Luftwaffe during World War II. This began with the adaptation of the He 70 and, in particular, the He 111, to be used as bombers. Heinkel also provided the Luftwaffe&#x27;s only operational heavy bomber, the Heinkel He 177, although this was never deployed in significant numbers. The German Luftwaffe equipped both of these bombers with the &quot;Z-Gerät&quot;, &quot;Y-Gerät&quot;, and &quot;Knickebein&quot;, developed by Johannes Plendl, and thus they were among the first aircraft to feature advanced night navigation devices, common in all commercial airplanes today.

Heinkel was less successful in selling fighter designs. Before the war, the Heinkel He 112 had been rejected in favour of the Messerschmitt Bf 109, and Heinkel&#x27;s attempt to top Messerschmitt&#x27;s design with the Heinkel He 100 failed due to political interference within the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM — Reich Aviation Ministry). The company also provided the Luftwaffe with an outstanding night fighter, the Heinkel He 219, which also suffered from politics and was produced only in limited numbers, but was the first Luftwaffe front-line aircraft to use retractable tricycle gear for its undercarriage design, and the world&#x27;s first front-line military aircraft to use ejection seats. By contrast, the only heavy bomber to enter service with the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; during the war years – the Heinkel He 177 &quot;Greif&quot; – turned out to be one of the most troublesome German wartime aircraft designs, plagued with numerous engine fires from both its inadequate engine nacelle design and its general airframe design being mis-tasked. The 30-meter (100 ft) class wingspan design was to be built to be able to perform moderate-angle dive bombing attacks from the moment of its approval by the RLM in early November 1937, until this was rescinded in September 1942.

From 1941 until the end of the war, the company was merged with engine manufacturer Hirth to form Heinkel-Hirth, giving the company the capability of manufacturing its own powerplants, including its &quot;Heinkel Strahltriebwerke&quot; turbojet engine manufacturing firm.

The Heinkel name was also behind pioneering work in jet engine and rocket development, and also the German aviation firm that attempted to popularize the use of retractable tricycle landing gear, a relative rarity in early WW II German airframe design. In 1939, flown by Erich Warsitz, the Heinkel He 176 and Heinkel He 178 became the first aircraft designs to fly under liquid-fuel rocket and turbojet power respectively.
Heinkel was the first to develop a jet fighter to prototype stage, the Heinkel He 280, the first Heinkel design to use and fly with retractable tricycle gear. In early 1942, the photographic interpretation unit at RAF Medmenham first saw evidence of the existence of the 280 in aerial reconnaissance photographs taken after a bombing raid on the Rostock factory. Thereafter, the Allies began intensive aerial reconnaissance intended to learn more about the German jet aircraft programme.

The He 219 night fighter design was the first German frontline combat aircraft to have retracting tricycle gear, and the first operational military aircraft anywhere to use ejection seats. Heinkel&#x27;s He 280, the firm&#x27;s only twin-jet aircraft design to fly never reached production, however, since the RLM wanted Heinkel to concentrate on bomber production and instead promoted the development of the rival Messerschmitt Me 262. Very late in the war, a Heinkel single-jet powered fighter finally took to the air as the Heinkel He 162A &quot;Spatz&quot; (sparrow) as the first military jet to use retractable tricycle landing gear, use a turbojet engine from its maiden flight forward, and use an ejection seat from the start, but it had barely entered service at the time of Germany&#x27;s surrender.

===Slave labour during World War II===
Heinkel was a major user of Sachsenhausen concentration camp labour, using between 6,000 and 8,000 prisoners on the He 177 bomber.

===Post-war===

Following the war, Heinkel was prohibited from manufacturing aircraft and instead built bicycles, motor scooters (see below), and the Heinkel microcar. The company eventually returned to aircraft in the mid-1950s, licence building Lockheed Martin F-104 Starfighters for the West German Luftwaffe. In 1965, the company was absorbed by Vereinigte Flugtechnische Werke (VFW), which was in turn absorbed by Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm in 1980 and later became part of Airbus.

Entwicklungsring Süd, a research and development conglomeration in a joint venture with Bölkow and Messerschmitt, designed the EWR VJ 101A/He 231, a VSTOL prototype, intended to protect West Germany&#x27;s airfields against Soviet attack.

===Microcar===
Heinkel introduced the &quot;Kabine&quot; bubble car in 1956. It competed with the BMW Isetta and the Messerschmitt KR200. It had a unit body and a four-stroke single-cylinder engine.

Heinkel stopped manufacturing the Kabine in 1958 but production continued under licence, first by Dundalk Engineering Company in Ireland and then by Trojan Cars Ltd., which ceased production in 1966.
===Scooters===
Heinkel introduced the &quot;Tourist&quot; motor scooter in the 1950s which was known for its reliability. A large and relatively heavy touring machine, it provided good weather protection with a full fairing and the front wheel turning under a fixed nose extension. The &quot;Tourist&quot; had effective streamlining, perhaps unsurprising in view of its aircraft ancestry, and although it had only a , 9.5 bhp 4-stroke engine, it was capable of sustaining speeds of up to (official figures ), given time to get there.

Heinkel also made a lighter scooter called the Heinkel 150.
===Mopeds===

Heinkel built the Perle moped from 1954 to 1957. The Perle was a sophisticated cycle with a cast alloy unit frame, rear suspension, a fully enclosed chain with part of the chain enclosure integral with the swingarm, and interchangeable wheels. This high level of sophistication came at a high cost. As with most mopeds, it had a two-stroke engine with a displacement of 50cc that operated on a mixture of gasoline and lubrication oil. Approximately twenty-seven thousand Perles were sold.

<text>Bethany Meilani Hamilton (born February 8, 1990) is an American professional surfer and writer. In 2003, she survived a shark attack in which her left arm was bitten off; ultimately, she returned to professional surfing and wrote about her experiences in the 2004 autobiography, &quot;Soul Surfer: A True Story of Faith, Family, and Fighting to Get Back on the Board.&quot; The book was adapted into the 2011 feature film, &quot;Soul Surfer.&quot; Hamilton attributes her strength to her Christian faith.

Hamilton is also the subject of a 2018 documentary, &quot;Bethany Hamilton: Unstoppable,&quot; in which she discusses how marriage and motherhood have affected her professional surfing career.

== Early life ==
Hamilton was born on February 8, 1990, to Tom and Cheri Hamilton in Lihue, Hawaii. She has two older brothers, Noah and Timothy. After learning how to surf at the age of three, Hamilton began surfing competitively at the age of eight and gained her first sponsorship by age 10. Hamilton was home-schooled from sixth grade through high school by her mother, a housewife, while her father was a waiter at a town café.

==Shark attack and recovery==
On October 31, 2003, 13-year-old Hamilton went for a morning surf along Tunnels Beach, Kauai, with her best friend Alana. While Hamilton was lying on her surfboard stomach-down, a tiger shark attacked her. It swiftly bit off Hamilton&#x27;s left arm, which was dangling in the water, just below the shoulder. The Blanchards helped paddle Hamilton back to shore, then Alana&#x27;s father fashioned a tourniquet out of a rash guard and wrapped it around the stump of her arm. Hamilton was rushed to Wilcox Medical Center. By the time she arrived there, Hamilton had lost over 60% of her blood and was in hypovolemic shock. Hamilton&#x27;s father, who was scheduled to have knee surgery that same morning, was already there, but she took his place in the operating room with the same doctor.

When the news of the shark attack broke, a family of fishermen led by Ralph Young presented to investigators photos of a tiger shark they had caught and killed about one mile from the attack site. It had surfboard debris in its mouth. When measurements of its mouth were compared with those of Hamilton&#x27;s broken board, it matched. In late 2004, police officially confirmed that it was the same one that had attacked her.

Despite the trauma of the incident, Hamilton was determined to return to surfing and did so a month later.

Initially, Hamilton adopted a custom-made board that was longer and slightly thicker than standard and had a handle for her right arm, making it easier to paddle, and Hamilton learned to kick more to make up for the loss of her left arm. After Hamilton taught herself to surf with one arm, she returned to surfing on November 26, 2003, just 26 days after the attack, and entered her first major competition on January 10, 2004. Hamilton now uses standard competitive performance short-boards. The shark-bitten surfboard that she was riding during the attack, as well as the swimsuit she was wearing, originally a gift from ocean photographer Aaron Chang, are on display at the California Surf Museum in Oceanside, California.

==Media==
Since the attack, Hamilton has appeared as a guest on numerous television shows. Her manager, Roy &quot;Dutch&quot; Hofstetter, who went on to produce the film &quot;Soul Surfer&quot;, managed Hamilton&#x27;s rise through the media from shark attack victim to inspirational role model. The television shows she has appeared on include &quot;The Amazing Race, The Biggest Loser&quot;, &quot;20/20&quot;, &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, &quot;Inside Edition&quot;, &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot;, &quot;The Today Show&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; and &quot;Dude Perfect&quot;, as well as in the magazines &quot;People&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, and &quot;American Girl&quot;. Additionally, Hamilton was the cover story in the first issue of &quot;NiNe&quot; magazine.

Hamilton has participated in multiple public speaking events and is &quot;motivating audiences worldwide to live their life with more tenacity, courage, and faith&quot;.

In 2004, Hamilton won the ESPY Award for Best Comeback Athlete and also received the Courage Teen Choice Award. That same year, MTV Books published Hamilton&#x27;s book, &quot;Soul Surfer: A True Story of Faith, Family, and Fighting to Get Back on the Board&quot;, which describes her ordeal. Hamilton&#x27;s story is also told in the 2007 short subject documentary film &quot;Heart of a Soul Surfer&quot;. Described as a &quot;faith-based documentary&quot;, the film addresses her devout Christianity and the courage and faith in Jesus in the aftermath of the shark attack and follows her quest for spiritual meaning.

In 2009, Hamilton was a contestant on &quot;Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader?&quot; and won $25,000. In 2010, she appeared on an episode of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Extreme Makeover: Home Edition&quot;.

In 2011, Hamilton appeared in a video for the Christian organization I Am Second, telling of her struggle after the shark attack and how she trusted in God to get her through it. That same year, a feature film &quot;Soul Surfer&quot;, based on her 2004 book, was released in theaters. Hamilton was portrayed by AnnaSophia Robb. She performed all the one-armed surfing stunts in it.

Hamilton also appeared on the TLC series &quot;19 Kids and Counting&quot; the same year, in the episode titled &quot;Duggars Under the Sea&quot;, when the Duggar family visited her in Atlanta, Georgia.

Hamilton plays herself in the film &quot;Dolphin Tale 2&quot;, which revolves around the baby dolphin Hope&#x27;s story. She and her husband, Adam Dirks, competed as a team on the 25th season of &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;, finishing in third place. It premiered in 2014 on CBS.

&quot;Bethany Hamilton: Unstoppable&quot; is set to tell the story of Hamilton&#x27;s transition from childhood to motherhood. &quot;From chasing her toddler to chasing the biggest waves. Bethany is continuously rewriting the rules on being a fearless athlete and brings a new meaning to the phrase, &#x27;Surf Like a Girl&#x27;&quot;.

Hamilton was featured in a short film by RipCurl titled &quot;Master and Apprentice&quot; alongside young female surfer Erin Brooks.

In 2024, Hamilton competed in season twelve of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Macaron&quot; with Willie Robertson (who competed in season six as &quot;Mallard&quot;) serving as her Mask Ambassador. Because of her one arm, the left arm of the &quot;Macaron&quot; costume was stationary. She was eliminated in the &quot;Group C Premiere&quot;, making her the first amputee to compete on the show.

== Personal life ==
In early 2012, Hamilton met youth minister Adam Dirks through mutual friends. They became engaged in 2013. The couple got married on August 18, 2013, at an estate on Kauai&#x27;s north shore, near where Hamilton grew up. They have four children (three sons and a daughter). Their marriage is featured throughout her documentary, &quot;Bethany Hamilton: Unstoppable.&quot; Along with being a professional surfer, Hamilton now offers mentorship classes on faith, healing, personal health, and relationships. Hamilton is a Christian.

== Books ==
Hamilton has published nine books, and her mom has also published one about her story. 
== Outreach programs ==
Hamilton is involved in numerous charitable efforts, including her own foundation, Friends of Bethany, which reaches out to amputees and youth, encouraging them to overcome difficulties by offering hope through Jesus Christ. Using her platform as a professional athlete to promote living a fit and healthy lifestyle, Hamilton authored the book &quot;Body and Soul&quot; in 2014. In 2019, a surf documentary was made about her, &quot;Bethany Hamilton: Unstoppable&quot;, which was accompanied by a photo book and a children&#x27;s book.

Within the Friends of Bethany Foundation, there are four different programs:

* Beautifully Flawed: retreat designed for young women ages 14–25 who have experienced traumatic limb loss. Six events hosted annually through this program which include: guests speakers, practical health and wellness tips which specifically account for limb loss, postural training, and surf lessons.
* Shine Forth: Night filled with stories and inspiration to overcome, free community event to gather together and share comeback stories. Bethany also does a book signing at this event, which is hosted annually.
* Anchored in Love: Conference for girls and young women ages 12 and up, one day event designed to help girls and young women discover their true beauty, purpose, and worth. Event is held annually in San Diego and features several guest speakers.
* The Forge: Men&#x27;s retreat where young male amputees come and focus on faith, fitness, and healthy living. This program is run by Bethany, her husband, and friend/mentor Mike Coots.

==Surfing career==
In January 2023, Hamilton announced that she would boycott all World Surf League events following their decision to allow transgender women to compete in the female category provided they maintain a testosterone level below 5nmol/L for 12 months prior. Hamilton questioned whether hormone levels were a fair and accurate assessment of sex, stating that transgender athletes should have a separate division created for them. She said that transgender women have a biological advantage over cisgender women, stating, &quot;We are seeing glimpses of male-bodied dominance in women&#x27;s sports like running, swimming and others.&quot; Hamilton said that she believes that many of the women currently on tour agree with her but are too afraid of being ostracized to speak out. Hamilton&#x27;s stance received support from some but was criticized by others.

<text>There were a variety of flags flown by ships of the Commonwealth during the Interregnum of 1649–1660.

At sea, royalist ships continued to fly the Union Jack of 1606, while on 22 February 1649 the Council of State decided to send the parliamentary navy an order (signed by Oliver Cromwell on 23 February) that &quot;the ships at sea in service of the State shall onely beare the red Crosse in a white flag&quot; (viz., the flag of England).
On 5 March 1649 the Council further ordered &quot;that the Flagg that is to be borne by the Admiral, Vice-Admiral, and Rere-Admiral be that now presented, viz., the Armes of England and Ireland in two severall Escotcheons in a Red Flagg, within a compartment.&quot;
A sole surviving example of a naval flag following this description is kept by the National Maritime Museum at Greenwich, others having fallen victim to the destruction of Commonwealth symbols at the Restoration of Charles II.
Scotland was formally united with England in 1654. According to Perrin (1922), the saltire of Scotland did not reappear on naval flags of the Commonwealth until 1658.

In 1658 Cromwell&#x27;s personal standard as Lord Protector became the &quot;Standard for the General of his Highnesse fleet&quot;, while the Cross-and-Harp jack was replaced by the &quot;Protectorate Jack&quot;, consisting of the royal Union Flag with the addition of the Irish Harp at the centre.

<doc id="392636" wikidata="Q209582" url="?curid=392636" title="Brush-tailed rock-wallaby">
<text>The brush-tailed rock-wallaby or small-eared rock-wallaby (Petrogale penicillata) is a kind of wallaby, one of several rock-wallabies in the genus &quot;Petrogale&quot;. It inhabits rock piles and cliff lines along the Great Dividing Range from about 100 km north-west of Brisbane to northern Victoria, in vegetation ranging from rainforest to dry sclerophyll forests. Populations have declined seriously in the south and west of its range, but it remains locally common in northern New South Wales and southern Queensland. However, due to a large bushfire event in South-East Australia around 70% of all the wallaby&#x27;s habitat has been lost as of January 2020.

In 2018, the southern brush-tailed rock wallaby was declared as the official mammal emblem of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), although it has not been seen in the wild in the ACT since 1959.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Petrogale penicillata&quot; was first described by John Edward Gray in 1827. The taxon has been named for a species complex, the &quot;Petrogale penicillata-lateralis&quot; group, the systematics of which continued to be resolved.

== Description ==
A species of &quot;Petrogale&quot;, rock wallabies have a dense and shaggy pelage that is rufous or grey brown. 
The tail is 500 to 700 millimetres long, exceeding the 510 to 580 mm combined length of the head and body.
The colour of the tail is brown or black, the fur becoming bushy towards its shaggy, brush-like end. 
The weight range is from 5 to 8 kilograms.
The upper parts of this wallaby&#x27;s pelage is either entirely rufous-brown, or a grey brown over the back and shoulders with brown fur at the thigh and rump. 
The paler under parts may feature a white blazon on the chest. Very dark fur covers the lower parts of the limbs, paws and feet, and on the sides beneath the fore limbs of the animal; a whitish stripe may appear along the side of the body.

The coloration of the species in the northern parts of population is paler and fur is shorter in length. 
The black-footed and flanked species &quot;Petrogale lateralis&quot;, which occurs in central Australia, is distinguished by its larger size and the shorter and darker fur of the tail and hind parts. Herbert&#x27;s rock-wallaby (&quot;P. herberti&quot;) overlaps in the northern range of this species, their coloration is greyer than the warm brown of this species and lighter at the darker features of the limbs; the tail of that species also lacks the blackish features and bushy end.
The pads of the feet are well developed and their coarse texture allows good traction on rock surfaces.

== Behaviour ==
The species is able to negotiate difficult rocky terrain with great agility, their compact yet powerful build is assisted by counter-balancing the long tail and feet suited to holding the animal at precarious edges and on inclined surfaces.
The species favours north facing refuges, and while largely nocturnal in venturing out from shelter they will bask in winter sun for short periods.
Procreation is founded on breeding females utilising a single male for insemination, with births that occur throughout the year. Groups in cooler latitudes or higher altitudes may tend to reproduce in a period between February and May. The females of the colony cohere as maternal groups, with male progeny moving to other groups within the colony or migrating to another location.
Individual foraging territories for the species are around 15 hectares, perhaps more for males.

== Distribution and habitat ==

Found along the Great Dividing Range in fragmented populations that remain after its historical contraction in range from the east and south. The southern edge of the range is the Grampians, and no further west than the Warrumbungles range in New South Wales. The northernmost groups have remained less affected by ecological changes, these are found in southeast Queensland.

&quot;Petrogale penicillata&quot; shelters during the day in rocky habitat, within vegetation or cavities of preferably complex terrain that allows them to find cooler temperatures and to elude or remain inaccessible to predators. Their great agility while hopping and climbing provides opportunities at ledges, cliff-faces, overhangs, caves and crevices.

== Introduced populations ==

As part of the acclimatisation movement of the late 1800s, governor Grey introduced this and four other species of wallabies (including the rare parma wallaby) to islands in Hauraki Gulf, near Auckland, New Zealand, where they became well-established. In modern times, these populations have come to be viewed as exotic pests, with severe impacts on the indigenous flora and fauna. As a result, eradication is being undertaken, after initial protection for review of their Australian populations and the return of some wallabies to Australia. Between 1967 and 1975, 210 rock-wallabies were captured on Kawau Island and returned to Australia, along with thousands of other wallabies. Rock-wallabies were removed from Rangitoto and Motutapu Islands during the 1990s, and eradication is now underway on Kawau. Another thirty-three rock-wallabies were captured on Kawau during the 2000s, and returned to Australia, before eradication began.

In 2003 some Kawau brush-tails were relocated to the Waterfall Springs Conservation Park north of Sydney, New South Wales, for captive breeding purposes.

Due to an escape of a pair in 1916, a small breeding population of the brush-tailed rock-wallabies also exists in the Kalihi Valley on the island of Oahu in Hawaii.

Attempts at reintroduction into the Grampians National Park during 2008-12 were not successful, largely due to fox predation. Nevertheless, March 2017 saw the emergence of a fourth offspring, bringing the total number of rock–wallabies present within the Grampians National Park to eight.

==Conservation==

The Brush-tailed rock wallaby was once common throughout South-East Australia, but due to clearing of native habitat, exotic plant introduction, predation by introduced species and changing fire patterns as a result of climate change they have been wiped out from much of their Southern and Western ranges.

In late 2019 fierce bushfires swept through New South Wales and Victoria, burning protected areas inhabited by the wallaby. It is estimated that 70% of all brush-tailed rock-wallaby habitat was destroyed. In the aftermath of the fires in Victoria, where the wallaby was thought to have been hunted to extinction by the early 20th century by settlers who prized its fur and skin, until some who had survived were discovered in the Grampians in 1970, a colony of 13 has been detected in the Grampians National Park while a further 50 are known to exist in the Snowy River National Park.

<text>The Calumet River is a system of heavily industrialized rivers and canals in the region between the south side of Chicago, Illinois, and the city of Gary, Indiana. Historically, the Little Calumet River and the Grand Calumet River were one, the former flowing west from Indiana into Illinois, then turning back east to its mouth at Lake Michigan at Marquette Park in Gary. Now the system is part of the Chicago Area Waterway System and through the use of locks flows away from Lake Michigan to the Cal-Sag Channel.

==Background==
The name &quot;Calumet&quot; is from the French colonial name for a particular type of Native American ceremonial pipe that served as a universal sign of peace among the Illiniwek, and which was presented to Pere Marquette in 1673.

Before human alteration, water flowed westward from LaPorte County, Indiana, along the Little Calumet River, made a hairpin turn at Blue Island, and flowed east along the Grand Calumet into Lake Michigan at the Miller Beach community of Gary, Indiana. The area is extremely flat and the course and even the direction of the river system has changed repeatedly. The low gradient gives the river only a very small current.

Industrial development in the Calumet River area began around the 1870s, and by 1890 the western reach of the Grand Calumet River was heavily polluted with the waste of steel mills, foundries, a meat packing plant, and glue and cornstarch factories. Industry continued to spread along the eastern reach of the river between 1890 and 1910, with similar results. These decades of unrestricted pollution have left the river sediments highly contaminated to this day.

In September 2008, areas of Lake and Porter County, Indiana, were declared national disaster areas. The Little Calumet River breached its levee and flooded portions of the towns of Munster and Highland, Indiana. In September 2019, Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal notified Indiana officials of a toxic spill from its Burns Harbor steel mill had spilled into a branch of the Little Calumet River, resulting in short-term closures of three Lake Michigan beaches.

==Segments of the Calumet River system==
===Calumet River===
The Calumet River, on the south side of Chicago, originally simply drained Lake Calumet to Lake Michigan. A canal extending it, legendarily claimed to have been created by voyageurs at the site of a frequent portage, was dug connecting the two Calumet Rivers at the point where the name now changes from Grand to Little.

The T.J. O&#x27;Brien Lock and Dam was installed across the river in 1960 to control the movement of water between Lake Michigan and the river.

===Grand Calumet River===
The Grand Calumet River, originating in Miller Beach, flows through the cities of Gary, East Chicago and Hammond, as well as Calumet City and Burnham on the Illinois side. The majority of the river&#x27;s flow drains into Lake Michigan via the Indiana Harbor and Ship Canal, sending about per second of water into the lake. Today, a large portion of the river&#x27;s flow originates as municipal and industrial effluent, cooling and process water and storm water overflows. Although discharges have been reduced, a number of contaminants continue to impair the area.

===Little Calumet River===
The Little Calumet River originally flowed from New Durham Township, LaPorte County, Indiana, to its junction with the Grand Calumet and Calumet rivers. Construction of the Portage Burns Waterway (Burns Ditch) in 1926 split the direction of flow of the Little Calumet River, at Hart Ditch, east of which it flows into Lake Michigan at the Port of Indiana Burns International Harbor. The confluence with Hart Ditch is located west of US-41 in North Township, Lake County. The Burns Ditch channelized the path of the Little Calumet River from its confluence with Deep River, at Three Rivers County Park, to the Port of Indiana by cutting through the Indiana Dunes. Three Rivers County Park is located on the border of Gary and Lake Station where I-65 meets the Borman Expressway.

East of the Burns Ditch the river is called the East Arm Little Calumet River, west of the Burns ditch it is named Little Calumet River. The Little Calumet River flows through or borders the towns of Portage, Lake Station, Gary, Highland, Griffith, Munster, and Hammond, then through South Holland, Dolton, Lansing, Calumet City, Harvey, Riverdale, Phoenix, Dixmoor, Burnham, and Blue Island in Illinois, connecting to the Cal-Sag Channel and at the junction of the Grand Calumet River and Calumet River. This arm of the river is long.
The Little Calumet has of river and tributaries and drains . The major tributaries are Deep River and its Turkey Creek sub-tributary, and the Salt Creek tributary of the East Arm Little Calumet River. Each tributary originates on the Valparaiso Moraine and flows north to the Little Calumet River.

The East Arm Little Calumet River, also known as the Little Calumet River East Branch begins just east of Holmesville in New Durham Township, LaPorte County, Indiana, and also flows through Chesterton, Porter, and Burns Harbor where it connects to the Port of Indiana-Burns Waterway. It has a total length of . It used to continue westward to Illinois as the Little Calumet River, but construction of the Burns Waterway in 1926 diverted its flow into Lake Michigan.

Until sometime in the late 1940s or early 1950s, the Little Calumet River was heavily polluted with sewage, and the only fish living in the river were carp. During heavy spring rains, the river would often flood areas adjacent to the river.

The Little Calumet River has been undergoing construction of a $200 million flood control and recreation project by the Chicago District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers since 1990. The project was expected to be complete in 2013. The project includes construction of of levees and floodwalls, a control structure at Hart Ditch, and almost of hiking trails. Additionally, of the river channel is being relocated to allow better water flow, and highway bridges are being modified to permit unobstructed flow of water. A flood warning system is also being implemented. When complete, the project will protect over 9,500 homes and businesses in the towns of Gary, Griffith, Highland, Hammond, and Munster in Indiana, and prevent nearly $11 million in flood damage annually. On September 15, 2008, the remnants of Hurricane Ike released heavy rain which flooded the banks of the Little Calumet River. Houses and strip malls in northern Munster and southern Hammond were evacuated. Hundreds of homes were damaged due to flooding. Recently, a new levee, along Northcote Avenue in Munster, is being built to protect residents from future floods.

===Cal-Sag Channel===

The Cal-Sag Channel (short for &quot;Calumet-Saganashkee Channel&quot;) is a navigation canal in southern Cook County, Illinois. It serves as a channel between the Little Calumet River and the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal. It is long and was dug over an 11-year period, from 1911 until 1922.

The Cal-Sag Channel serves barge traffic in what was an active zone of heavy industry in the far southern neighborhoods of the city of Chicago and adjacent suburbs. As of 2006 it was also used more as a conduit for wastewater from southern Cook County, including the Chicago-area Deep Tunnel Project, into the Illinois Waterway. It is also used by pleasure crafts in the summer time.

The western of the channel flow through the Palos Forest Preserves, a collection of protected County Forest Preserves operated by the Forest Preserve District of Cook County.

The Cal-Sag Channel served as the rowing venue for the 1959 Pan American Games.

When it is completed, the Calumet-Sag Trail, a greenway, will border the channel and will stretch from the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal to the Burnham Greenway.

<text>An airman is a member of an air force or air arm of a nation&#x27;s armed forces. In certain air forces, it can also refer to a specific enlisted rank. An airman can also be referred to as a soldier in other definitions. As a military rank designation, the male form of address also applies to women.

In civilian aviation usage, the term airman is analogous to the term &quot;sailor&quot; in nautical usage. In the American Federal Aviation Administration usage, an airman is any holder of an airman&#x27;s certificate, male or female. This certificate is issued to those who qualify for it by the Federal Aviation Administration Airmen Certification Branch.

==New Zealand==
&quot;Airman&quot; was a former general term used to describe any service members of the Royal New Zealand Air Force. Following the Royal Air Force, the RNZAF now refers to its personnel as “aviators.”

==United Kingdom==

&quot;Airman&quot; and &quot;airwoman&quot; were formerly general terms used to describe members of the Royal Air Force, particularly other ranks. In 2021 those terms were changed for the gender-neutral term &quot;aviator&quot;.

==United States ==
===Air Force===
In the U.S. Air Force, &quot;airman&quot; is a general term which can refer to any member of the United States Air Force, regardless of rank, but is also a specific enlisted rank in the Air Force. The rank of airman (abbreviated &quot;Amn&quot;) is the second enlisted rank from the bottom, just above the rank of Airman Basic, and just below that of Airman First Class. Since the Air Force was established in 1947, all of the various ranks of &quot;airman&quot; have always included women, and in this context, the word &quot;man&quot; means &quot;human being&quot;. Former U.S. Air Force ranks included Airman Second Class and Airman Third Class. The current E-2 paygrade rank of Airman was called Airman Third Class from 1952 to 1967.

A person with the rank of Airman Basic is typically promoted to the rank of Airman after six months of active duty service in the Air Force, if that member had signed up for an enlistment period of at least four years of active duty. On the other hand, an enlistee could be promoted to the rank of Airman immediately after completing Air Force basic training (and thus paid somewhat more) given one of several additional qualifications:

*Having completed at least two years of a Junior Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (Junior ROTC) while in high school.
*Having achieved the Eagle Scout rank from the Boy Scouts of America, or the Gold Award from the Girl Scouts of the United States of America.
*Having earned 20 college semester credit hours (30 quarter hours).

Those enlistees who have qualified for these early promotions to the rank of Airman are allowed to wear their single airman insignia stripe during the Air Force basic training graduation ceremony at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. They also receive a retroactive pay increment that brings them up to the pay grade for an Airman upon their completion of basic training. (Thus, it is as if they have enlisted as Airmen on the first day, as far as their pay is concerned. However, if they do not complete basic training and are discharged, they do not receive the extra pay.)

While at the rank of Airman, the duties of enlisted personnel include adjusting to the Air Force way of military life and becoming proficient in their Air Force duty specialties. Note that upon leaving basic training, all Airmen enter a period of many weeks or many months of training at Air Force schools in their duty specialties that they and the Air Force have selected for them depending on their aptitudes and interests, and the needs of the Air Force. For Airmen with high aptitudes, some of these training programs include more than one school and take a year or more to complete.

Airmen are often nicknamed “mosquito wings&quot; due to the insignia&#x27;s resemblance to a mosquito&#x27;s small wings.

===Navy===

In the U.S. Navy, Airman is the enlisted rank that corresponds to the pay grade of E-3 in the Navy&#x27;s aviation field, but it is just below the rank of Petty Officer Third Class, pay grade E-4.

===Coast Guard===
In the U.S. Coast Guard, the ranks are very similar or identical to the ones in the U.S. Navy, and a Coast Guard airman is identical in rank and pay to an Airman in the Navy. Coast Guard Airman is the enlisted rank that corresponds to the pay grade of E-3 in the Coast Guard&#x27;s aviation field, and includes both men and women. Airman is just above the Coast Guard rank of airman apprentice, Seaman Apprentice, fireman apprentice which is the E-2 pay grade, but it is just below the rank of Petty Officer Third Class, E-4 pay grade.

==Venezuela==

The rank is used by the National Bolivarian Armed Forces of Venezuela.

<doc id="392658" wikidata="Q446580" url="?curid=392658" title="Todd Haynes">
<text>Todd Haynes (; born January 2, 1961) is an American film director, screenwriter, and producer. His films span four decades with themes examining the personalities of well-known musicians, dysfunctional and dystopian societies, and blurred gender roles.

Haynes first gained public attention with his controversial short film &quot;&quot; (1987), which chronicles singer Karen Carpenter&#x27;s life and death using Barbie dolls as actors. &quot;Superstar&quot; became a cult classic. His feature directorial debut, &quot;Poison&quot; (1991), a provocative exploration of AIDS-era perceptions and subversions, established him as a figure of a new transgressive cinema. &quot;Poison&quot; won the Sundance Film Festival&#x27;s Grand Jury Prize.

Haynes received further acclaim for his second feature film, &quot;Safe&quot; (1995), a symbolic portrait of a housewife who develops multiple chemical sensitivity. &quot;Safe&quot; was later voted the best film of the 1990s by &quot;The Village Voice&quot; Film Poll. His next feature, &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot; (1998), is a tribute to the 1970s glam rock era. The film received the Special Jury Prize for Best Artistic Contribution at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival.

Haynes gained acclaim and a measure of mainstream success with &quot;Far from Heaven&quot; (2002), receiving his first Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay. He continued to direct critically lauded films such as &quot;I&#x27;m Not There&quot; (2007), &quot;Carol&quot; (2015), &quot;Wonderstruck&quot; (2017), &quot;Dark Waters&quot; (2019), and &quot;May December&quot; (2023), as well as the documentary film &quot;The Velvet Underground&quot; (2021). Haynes also directed and co-wrote the HBO mini-series &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot; (2011), for which he received three Primetime Emmy Award nominations.

== Early life and education ==
Haynes was born January 2, 1961, in Los Angeles, and grew up in the city&#x27;s Encino neighborhood. His father, Allen E. Haynes, was a cosmetics importer, and his mother, Sherry Lynne (née Semler), studied acting. Haynes is Jewish on his mother&#x27;s side. His younger sister is Gwynneth Haynes of the band Sophe Lux.

Haynes developed an interest in film at an early age, and produced a short film, &quot;The Suicide&quot; (1978), while still in high school. He studied art and semiotics at Brown University, where he directed his first short film &quot;Assassins: A Film Concerning Rimbaud&quot; (1985), inspired by the French poet Arthur Rimbaud (a personality Haynes would later reference in his film &quot;I&#x27;m Not There&quot;). At Brown, he met Christine Vachon, who would go on to produce all of his feature films. After graduating from Brown, Haynes moved to New York City and became involved in the independent film scene, launching Apparatus Productions, a non-profit organization for the support of independent film.

According to &quot;Cinematic/Sexual: An Interview with Todd Haynes&quot;, in response to whether his academic background affected his film-making practice, Haynes stated that his high school teacher taught him a valuable lesson: &quot;Reality can&#x27;t be a criterion for judging the success or failure of a film, or its effect on you. It was a simple, but eye-opening, way of approaching film.&quot;

==Career==
=== 1987–1993: Early work and feature debut ===

In 1987, while an MFA student at Bard College, Haynes made a short, &quot;&quot;, which chronicles the life of American pop singer Karen Carpenter, using Barbie dolls as actors. The film presents Carpenter&#x27;s struggle with anorexia and bulimia, featuring several close-ups of Ipecac (the nonprescription drug Carpenter was reputed to have used to make herself vomit during her illness). Carpenter&#x27;s chronic weight loss was portrayed by using a &quot;Karen&quot; Barbie doll with the face and body whittled away with a knife, leaving the doll looking skeletonized.

&quot;Superstar&quot; featured extensive use of Carpenter songs, showcasing Haynes&#x27;s love of popular music (which would be a recurring feature of later films). Haynes failed to obtain proper licensing to use the music, prompting a lawsuit from Karen&#x27;s brother Richard for copyright infringement. Carpenter was reportedly also offended by Haynes&#x27;s unflattering portrayal of him as a narcissistic bully, along with several broadly dropped suggestions that he was gay and in the closet. Carpenter won his lawsuit, and &quot;Superstar&quot; was removed from public distribution; to date, it may not be viewed publicly. Bootlegged versions of the film are still circulated, and the film is sporadically made available on YouTube.

Haynes&#x27;s 1991 feature film debut, &quot;Poison&quot;, garnered him further acclaim and controversy. Drawing on the writings of gay writer Jean Genet, the film is a triptych of queer-themed narratives, each adopting a different cinematic genre: vox-pop documentary (&quot;Hero&quot;), 50s sci-fi horror (&quot;Horror&quot;) and gay prisoner romantic drama (&quot;Homo&quot;). The film explores traditional perceptions of homosexuality as an unnatural and deviant force, and presents Genet&#x27;s vision of sado-masochistic gay relations as a subversion of heterosexual norms, culminating with a marriage ceremony between two gay male convicts. &quot;Poison&quot; marked Haynes&#x27;s first collaboration with his longtime producer Christine Vachon.

&quot;Poison&quot; was partially funded with a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), &quot;at a time when the agency was under attack from conservative groups for using public funds to support sexually explicit works&quot;. This, along with the film&#x27;s sexual themes, was a source of controversy. The film subsequently became the center of a public attack by Reverend Donald Wildmon, head of the American Family Association, who criticized the NEA for funding &quot;Poison&quot; and other works by gay and lesbian artists and filmmakers. Wildmon, who had not viewed the film before making his comments publicly, condemned the film&#x27;s &quot;explicit porno scenes of homosexuals involved in anal sex&quot;, despite no such scenes appearing in the film. &quot;Poison&quot; went on to win the 1991 Sundance Film Festival&#x27;s Grand Jury Prize, establishing Haynes as an emerging talent and the voice of a new transgressive generation. The film writer B. Ruby Rich cited &quot;Poison&quot; as one of the defining films of the emerging New Queer Cinema movement, with its focus on maverick sexuality as an anti-establishment social force.

Haynes&#x27;s next short film, &quot;Dottie Gets Spanked&quot; (1993), explored the experiences of a quiet and gentle six-year-old boy in the early 1960s who has various indirect encounters with spanking, most significantly involving his idol, a TV sitcom star named Dottie. The film was aired on PBS.

=== 1995–1998: Rise to prominence ===

Haynes&#x27;s second feature film, &quot;Safe&quot; (1995), was a critically acclaimed portrait of Carol White, a San Fernando Valley housewife (played by Julianne Moore) who develops violent allergies to her middle-class suburban existence. After a series of extreme allergic reactions and hospitalization, Carol diagnoses herself with acute environmental illness, and moves to a New Age commune in the New Mexico desert run by an HIV positive &quot;guru&quot; who preaches both that the real world is toxic and unsafe for Carol, and that she is responsible for her illness and recovery. The film ends with Carol retreating to her antiseptic, prison-like &quot;safe room&quot;, looking at herself in the mirror and whispering &quot;I love you&quot; to her reflection.

The film is notable for its critical (though not entirely unsympathetic) treatment of its main character. Julie Grossman argues in her article &quot;The Trouble With Carol&quot; that Haynes concludes the film as a challenge to traditional Hollywood film narratives of the heroine taking charge of her life, and that Haynes sets Carol up as the victim both of a repressive male-dominated society, and also of an equally debilitating self-help culture that encourages patients to take sole responsibility for their illness and recovery. Carol&#x27;s illness, although unidentified, has been read as an analogy for the AIDS crisis of the mid-1980s, as a similarly uncomfortable and largely unspoken &quot;threat&quot; in 1980s Reaganist America. &quot;Safe&quot; was critically acclaimed, giving Moore her first leading role in a feature film, and gave Haynes a measure of mainstream critical recognition. It was voted the best film of the 1990s by the Village Voice&#x27;s Critic Poll. The film historian David Thomson later described it as &quot;one of the most arresting, original and accomplished films of the 1990s&quot;.

Haynes took a radical shift in direction for his next feature, &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot; (1998), starring Christian Bale, Ewan McGregor, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers and Toni Collette. The film&#x27;s title takes its name from David Bowie&#x27;s song &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot;. Filmed and set mostly in England, the film was an intentionally chaotic tribute to the 1970s glam rock era, drawing heavily on the rock histories and mythologies of glam rockers David Bowie, Iggy Pop and Lou Reed. Starting with Oscar Wilde as the spiritual godfather of glam rock, the film revels in the gender and identity experimentation and fashionable bisexuality of the era, and acknowledges the transformative power of glam rock as an escape and a form of self-expression for gay teenagers.
The film follows the character of Arthur (Bale) an English journalist once enraptured by glam rock as a 1970s teenager, who returns a decade later to hunt down his former heroes: Brian Slade (Rhys Meyers), a feather boa-wearing androgyne with an alter ego, &quot;Maxwell Demon&quot;, who resembles Bowie in his Ziggy Stardust incarnation, and Curt Wild (McGregor), an Iggy Pop-style rocker. The narrative playfully rewrites glam rock myths which in some cases sail unnervingly close to the truth. Slade flirts with bisexuality and decadence before staging his own death in a live performance and disappearing from the scene, echoing Bowie&#x27;s own disavowal of glam rock in the late 1970s and his subsequent re-creation as an avowedly heterosexual pop star. The film features a love affair between Slade and Wild&#x27;s characters, recalling rumors about Bowie and Reed&#x27;s supposed sexual relationship. Curt Wild&#x27;s character has a flashback to enforced electric shock treatment as a teenager to attempt to cure his homosexuality, echoing Reed&#x27;s teenage experiences as a victim of the homophobic medical profession.

Haynes was keen to use original music from the glam rock period, and (learning his lesson from &quot;Superstar&quot;) approached David Bowie before making the film for permission to use his music in the soundtrack. Bowie declined, leaving Haynes to use a combination of original songs from other artists and glam-rock inspired music written by contemporary rock bands for the film, including Suede. &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot; premiered in main competition at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival, winning a special jury award for Best Artistic Contribution. Despite the initial critical praise, the film received mixed reviews from critics. Costume designer Sandy Powell received an Academy Award nomination for her costume design and won the Oscar in the same year for her work on &quot;Shakespeare In Love&quot;.

=== 2002–2014: Career progression and acclaim ===
Haynes achieved his greatest critical and commercial success to date with &quot;Far from Heaven&quot; (2002), a 1950s-set drama inspired by the films of Douglas Sirk about a Connecticut housewife Cathy Whittaker (Julianne Moore) who discovers that her husband (Dennis Quaid) is secretly gay, and subsequently falls in love with Raymond, her African-American gardener (Dennis Haysbert). The film works as a mostly reverential and unironic tribute to Sirk&#x27;s filmmaking, lovingly re-creating the stylized mise-en-scene, colors, costumes, cinematography and lighting of Sirkian melodrama. Cathy and Raymond&#x27;s relationship resembles Jane Wyman and Rock Hudson&#x27;s inter-class love affair in &quot;All That Heaven Allows,&quot; and Cathy&#x27;s relationship with Sybil, her African-American housekeeper (Viola Davis) recalls Lana Turner and Juanita Moore&#x27;s friendship in &quot;Imitation of Life&quot;. While staying within the cinematic language of the period, Haynes updates the sexual and racial politics, showing scenarios (an inter-racial love affair and gay relationships) that would not have been permissible in Sirk&#x27;s era. Haynes also resists a Sirkian happy ending, allowing the film to finish on a melancholy note closer in tone to the &quot;weepy&quot; melodramas of the 1940s and 1950s cinema such as &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot;.

&quot;Far from Heaven&quot; debuted at the Venice Film Festival to widespread critical acclaim and garnered a slew of film awards, including the Volpi Cup for Moore, and four Academy Award nominations: lead actress for Moore, Haynes&#x27;s original screenplay, Elmer Bernstein&#x27;s score, and Edward Lachman&#x27;s cinematography. &quot;Far from Heaven&quot; lost in all four categories, but the film&#x27;s success was hailed as a breakthrough for independent film achieving mainstream recognition and brought Haynes to the attention of a wider mainstream audience.

In another radical shift in direction, Haynes&#x27;s next film &quot;I&#x27;m Not There&quot; (2007) returned to the mythology of popular music, portraying the life and legend of Bob Dylan through seven fictional characters played by six actors: Richard Gere, Cate Blanchett, Marcus Carl Franklin, Heath Ledger, Ben Whishaw and Christian Bale. Haynes obtained Dylan&#x27;s approval to proceed with the film, and the rights to use his music in the soundtrack, after presenting a one-page summary of the film&#x27;s concept to Jeff Rosen, Dylan&#x27;s long-time manager. &quot;I&#x27;m Not There&quot; premiered at the Venice Film Festival to critical acclaim, where Haynes won the Grand Jury Prize and Blanchett won the Volpi Cup, eventually receiving an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress.

Haynes&#x27;s next project was &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot;, a five-hour miniseries for HBO based on the novel by James M. Cain and the 1945 film starring Joan Crawford. The series starred Kate Winslet in the title role and featured Guy Pearce, Evan Rachel Wood, Melissa Leo, James LeGros and Hope Davis. Filming was completed in mid-2010 and the series began airing on HBO on 27 March 2011. It received 21 Primetime Emmy Award nominations, winning five, and Winslet won a Golden Globe Award for her performance.

=== 2015–2019: Established career ===

Haynes&#x27;s sixth feature film, &quot;Carol&quot;, is an adaptation of the 1952 novel &quot;The Price of Salt&quot; by Patricia Highsmith. The cast features Cate Blanchett, Rooney Mara, Sarah Paulson and Kyle Chandler. The film premiered in competition at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Queer Palm and a shared Best Actress prize for Mara. &quot;Carol&quot; received critical acclaim and was nominated for 6 Academy Awards, 5 Golden Globe Awards, 9 BAFTA Awards, and 6 Independent Spirit Awards. Geoffrey McNab of &quot;The Independent&quot; praised the film praising Haynes writing &quot;In sly and subversive fashion, Haynes is laying bare the tensions in a society that refuses to acknowledge &quot;difference&quot; of any sort&quot;. McNabb added, &quot;They are both helped that in Todd Haynes, they have a director who is sensitive to every last nuance in their performances&quot;.

On October 20, 2017, Haynes&#x27;s &quot;Wonderstruck&quot; was released, having premiered at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival on May 18, 2017. The film is an adaptation of Brian Selznick&#x27;s children&#x27;s book of the same name. &quot;Wonderstruck&quot; stars Julianne Moore and is produced by Haynes&#x27;s collaborator Christine Vachon and Amazon Studios, which is also distributing the film. The movie describes two deaf children, one in 1927 and the other in 1977, who embark on separate quests to find themselves. When asked why he&#x27;d made a children&#x27;s movie, in his October 15, 2017, NPR interview, Haynes explained, &quot;I felt like it spoke to something indomitable about the nature of kids and the ability for kids to be confronted with challenges and the unknown and to keep muscling through those challenges.&quot; The film received mixed reviews but earned praise for Edward Lachman&#x27;s black-and-white cinematography.

Haynes directed a film titled &quot;Dark Waters&quot; for Participant Media. The film is based on Nathaniel Rich&#x27;s &quot;New York Times Magazine&quot; article “The Lawyer Who Became DuPont&#x27;s Worst Nightmare,” which is about corporate defense attorney Robert Bilott and his environmental lawsuit against the American conglomerate DuPont. Mark Ruffalo and Anne Hathaway star, and principal photography began in January 2019, in Cincinnati. The film was released on November 22, 2019.

=== 2021–present ===
Haynes&#x27;s premiered his first documentary feature, &quot;The Velvet Underground&quot;, at the Cannes Film Festival on July 7, 2021, and it went on to be released on October 15, 2021, in theaters and on Apple TV+, to critical acclaim. The film rejects documentary biopic tropes, evoking a place and time through extensive use of montage. “What montage can do is always more sophisticated than we give it credit for,” Haynes says. “I wanted the audience to fill in the holes themselves and make their own discoveries and feel like these ideas are alive again, because they’re coming through you, and they’re not just being told to us like in a lecture.” Haynes was nominated for the Critics&#x27; Choice Documentary Award for Best First Documentary Feature.

Haynes&#x27;s latest film, &quot;May December&quot;, reunites him with frequent collaborator Julianne Moore and co-stars Natalie Portman and Charles Melton. The film, loosely based around Mary Kay Letourneau, revolves around a married couple whose relationship is put through a test after an actress arrives to do research for a film about their past. The script was written by Samy Burch, with a story by Burch and Alex Mechanik. The film was shot in Savannah, Georgia, and wrapped filming in December 2022. The film received positive reviews with Peter Debruge of &quot;Variety&quot; writing, &quot;Todd Haynes unpacks America’s obsession with scandal and the impossibility of ever truly knowing what motivates others in this layered look at the actor’s process.&quot; The film went on to receive nominations for four Golden Globe Awards including Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy. Haynes himself was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Director.

In 2023, Todd Haynes was given a Moving Image Award by the Museum of the Moving Image (MOMI) in New York City. MOMI also curated a retrospective of his work, and published a book, &quot;Todd Haynes: Rapturous Process.&quot;

Haynes said in September 2023 that he has been working on a sexually explicit film about a &quot;love story between two men set in the 1930&#x27;s&quot;, starring Joaquin Phoenix. The project was cancelled shortly before production began when Phoenix abruptly quit.

==== Upcoming projects ====
In 2015 he was reported to be developing a TV series based on the 2012 documentary &quot;The Source Family&quot; for HBO.

Haynes is set to direct a Peggy Lee biopic, titled &quot;Fever&quot;, based on a screenplay originally drafted by Nora Ephron before her death in 2012, starring Michelle Williams in the title role after Reese Witherspoon backed out of the role to produce instead. Billie Eilish is in early talks to executive produce. The primary screenwriter is now Doug Wright.

Haynes is reportedly set to direct the HBO series &quot;Trust,&quot; based on Hernan Diaz&#x27;s novel of the same name, with Kate Winslet as the lead after working together on &quot;Mildred Pierce.&quot;

== Style and themes ==
AllMovie writes that &quot;Haynes is known for making provocative films that subvert narrative structure and resound with transgressive, complex eroticism. ... Although he doesn&#x27;t characterize himself as a gay filmmaker who makes gay films … Haynes&#x27; name has become synonymous with the New Queer Cinema movement and its work to both explore and redefine the contours of queer culture in America and beyond.&quot;

Haynes&#x27;s work is preoccupied with postmodernist ideas of identity and sexuality as socially constructed concepts and personal identity as a fluid and changeable state. His protagonists are invariably social outsiders whose &quot;subversive&quot; identity and sexuality put them at odds with the received norms of their society. In the Haynes universe, sexuality (especially &quot;deviant&quot; or unconventional sexuality) is a subversive and dangerous force that disrupts social norms and is often repressed brutally by dominant power structures. Haynes presents artists as the ultimate subversive force since they must necessarily stand outside of societal norms, with an artist&#x27;s creative output representing the greatest opportunity for personal and social freedom. Many of his films are unconventional portraits of popular artists and musicians (Karen Carpenter in &quot;Superstar&quot;, David Bowie in &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot; and Bob Dylan in &quot;I&#x27;m Not There&quot;).

Haynes&#x27;s films often feature formal cinematic or narrative devices that challenge received notions of identity and sexuality and remind the audience of the artificiality of film as a medium. Examples include using Barbie dolls instead of actors in &quot;Superstar&quot; or having multiple actors portray the protagonist in &quot;I&#x27;m Not There&quot;. Stylistically, Haynes favors formalism over naturalism, often appropriating and reinventing cinematic styles, including the documentary form in &quot;Poison&quot;, &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Not There&quot;, the reinvention of the Douglas Sirk melodrama in &quot;Far from Heaven&quot; and extensive referencing of 1960s art cinema in &quot;I&#x27;m Not There&quot;.

Haynes is openly gay, and identifies as irreligious. After living in New York City for more than a decade, Haynes moved to Portland, Oregon, in 2002. He has been in a relationship with Bryan O&#x27;Keefe, an archival producer, since 2002.

An edited book of personal interviews was published in 2014, titled &quot;Todd Haynes: Interviews&quot;.

<text>The Commie Awards was an award show that recognized the best in comedy in various categories. It was produced by Comedy Central and meant to be a replacement for the defunct American Comedy Awards.

The first ceremony aired on the network on December 7, 2003. The show featured Rodney Dangerfield receiving a lifetime achievement award. However, for unknown reasons the network discontinued the awards and would not air another comedy awards ceremony until the 2011 Comedy Awards.

<text>&quot;New queer cinema&quot; is a term first coined by the academic B. Ruby Rich in &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; magazine in 1992 to define and describe a movement in queer-themed independent filmmaking in the early 1990s.

It is also referred to as the &quot;queer new wave&quot;.

==Definition==
The term developed from use of the word &quot;queer&quot; in academic writing in the 1980s and 1990s as an inclusive way of describing gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender identity and experience, and also defining a form of sexuality that was fluid and subversive of traditional understandings of sexuality. The major film studio to discuss these issues was aptly named New Line Cinema with its Fine Line Features division. Since 1992, the phenomenon has also been described by various other academics and has been used to describe several other films released since the 1990s. Films of the new queer cinema movement typically share certain themes, such as the rejection of heteronormativity and the lives of LGBTQ protagonists living on the fringe of society.

==History==
=== Queer cinema ===
Susan Hayward states that queer cinema existed for decades before it was given its official label, such as the films of French creators Jean Cocteau ( in 1934) and Jean Genet (&quot;Un chant d&#x27;amour&quot; in 1950). Queer cinema is associated with avant-garde and underground films (e.g., Andy Warhol&#x27;s 1960s films). In avant-garde film, there are lesbian filmmakers, who laid the heritage for queer cinema, notably Ulrike Ottinger, Chantal Akerman and Pratibha Parmar.

An important influence on the development of queer cinema was Rainer Werner Fassbinder&#x27;s 1970s and 1980s European art films, which added a &quot;gay and queer sensibility&quot; to film (e.g., &quot;Querelle&quot; from 1982, based on Genet&#x27;s novel). Rosa von Praunheim has made more than 100 films on queer topics since the late 1960s, many of them have been shown and rated internationally; some of the director&#x27;s films are considered milestones in queer cinema. Von Praunheim became an international icon of queer cinema. Another influence on queer cinema was the Brazilian filmmaker Héctor Babenco, whose film &quot;Kiss of the Spider Woman&quot;, from 1985, depicted a man in prison, who is seduced by his cellmate. His films also examined the relationship between sexual, social, and political oppression, which would go on to become key themes of new queer cinema.

The identification of queer cinema probably emerged in the mid-1980s through the influence of queer theory, which aims to &quot;challenge and push further debates on gender and sexuality&quot; as developed by feminist theory and &quot;confuse binary essentialisms around gender and sexual identity, expose their limitations&quot;, and depict the blurring of these roles and identities. Queer cinema filmmakers sometimes made films in genres that were typically considered mainstream, then subverting conventions by depicting the &quot;question of pleasure&quot; and celebrating excess, or by re-adding homosexual themes or historical elements where they had been erased through straightwashing (e.g. in Derek Jarman&#x27;s 1991 historical film &quot;Edward II&quot;). 

Queer cinema filmmakers called for a &quot;multiplicity of voices and sexualities&quot; and equally had a &quot;collection of different aesthetics&quot; in their work. The issue of &quot;lesbian invisibility&quot; had been raised in queer cinema, since more funding went to gay male filmmakers than lesbian directors, as is the case with the heterosexual/mainstream film industry, and as such, much of queer cinema focused on the &quot;construction of male desire&quot;.

=== Rich&#x27;s articles ===
In her 1992 article, Rich commented on the strong gay and lesbian presence on the previous year&#x27;s film festival circuit and coined the phrase &quot;new queer cinema&quot; to describe a growing movement of similarly themed films being made by gay and lesbian independent filmmakers, chiefly in North America and the United Kingdom. Rich developed her theory in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; and &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot;, describing films that were radical in form and aggressive in their presentation of sexual identities, which challenged both the status quo of heterosexual definition and resisted promoting &quot;positive&quot; images of lesbians and gay men that had been advocated by the gay liberation movement of the 1970s and 1980s. In the films of new queer cinema, the protagonists and narratives were predominantly LGBTQ, but were presented invariably as outsiders and renegades from the rules of conventional society, who embraced radical and unconventional gender roles and ways of life, frequently casting themselves as outlaws or fugitives.

Drawing on postmodernist and poststructuralist academic theories of the 1980s, the new queer cinema presented human identity and sexuality as socially constructed, and therefore fluid and changeable, rather than fixed. In the world of New Queer Cinema, sexuality is often a chaotic and subversive force, which is alienating to and often brutally repressed by dominant heterosexual power structures. Films in the new queer cinema movement frequently featured explicit and unapologetic depictions of same-sex sexual activity, and presented same-sex relationships that reconfigured traditional heterosexual notions of family and marriage. While not all identifying with a specific political movement, new queer cinema films were invariably radical, as they sought to challenge and subvert assumptions about identity, gender, class, family and society.

=== Generic developments ===
The 1991 documentary &quot;Paris Is Burning&quot; introduced audiences to yet another subcultural realm. Director Jennie Livingston captured the realities of New York&#x27;s drag balls and houses, and of the people of color who occupied these spaces. This was an arguably underground world with which many Americans were unfamiliar. Aesthetic excellence and flamboyance were crucial in drag performances and competitions. Stylized vogue dancing was also exhibited as central to the drag experience, notably influencing the artistry of pop icon Madonna. New queer cinema figures like Livingston encouraged viewers to suspend their ignorance, and enjoy the diversity of humanity.

Not only did these films frequently reference the AIDS crisis of the 1980s, the film movement itself can be seen as a response to the crisis. The tone and energy of these movies reflected the assertive outrage of AIDS activist organizations of the past decade. AIDS activist videos, in particular, had a strong influence on the themes and imagery in new queer cinema as many of its notable figures were directly involved with AIDS activism. These films commented on the failure of the Ronald Reagan administration to respond to the AIDS epidemic and the social stigma experienced by the gay community. Given the relative invisibility of references to AIDS in mainstream Hollywood film-making, the work of new queer cinema was hailed by the gay community as a welcome correction to a history of under-representation and stereotyping of gay and lesbian people.

Among the films cited by Rich were Todd Haynes&#x27;s &quot;Poison&quot; (1991), Laurie Lynd&#x27;s &quot;RSVP&quot; (1991), Isaac Julien&#x27;s &quot;Young Soul Rebels&quot; (1991), Derek Jarman&#x27;s &quot;Edward II&quot; (1991), Tom Kalin&#x27;s &quot;Swoon&quot; (1992), and Gregg Araki&#x27;s &quot;The Living End&quot; (1992). All the films feature explicitly gay and lesbian protagonists and subjects; explicit and unapologetic depictions of or references to gay sex; and a confrontational and often antagonistic approach towards heterosexual culture.

These directors were making their films at a time when the gay community was facing new challenges from the AIDS crisis in the 1980s and the conservative political wave brought on by the presidency of Ronald Reagan in the United States and the government of Margaret Thatcher in the United Kingdom. Jarman was diagnosed with AIDS in 1986, and died in 1994 at the age of 52. Jarman&#x27;s public promotion of gay rights and equality have established him as an influential activist within the LGBTQ community. Queer theory and politics were emerging topics in academic circles, with proponents arguing that gender and sexual categories, such as homosexual and heterosexual, were historical social constructs, subject to change with cultural attitudes. Rich noted that many films were beginning to represent sexualities that were unashamedly neither fixed nor conventional, and coined the phrase &quot;new queer cinema&quot;.

Other important examples of new queer cinema include the first feature film by a black lesbian, Cheryl Dunye&#x27;s &quot;The Watermelon Woman&quot; (1996), and Hong Kong director Wong Kar-wai&#x27;s &quot;Happy Together&quot; (1997).

==In the 21st century==
Beginning in the 2010s, a number of LGBT filmmakers, including Rose Troche and Travis Mathews, identified a newer trend in LGBT filmmaking, in which the influence of new queer cinema was evolving toward more universal audience appeal.

Rich, the originator of the phrase &quot;new queer cinema&quot;, has identified the emergence in the late 2000s of LGBT-themed mainstream films such as &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot;, &quot;Milk&quot;, and &quot;The Kids Are All Right&quot; as a key moment in the evolution of the genre. Both Troche and Mathews singled out Stacie Passon&#x27;s 2013 &quot;Concussion&quot;, a film about marital infidelity in which the central characters&#x27; lesbianism is a relatively minor aspect of a story and the primary theme is how a long-term relationship can become troubled and unfulfilling regardless of its gender configuration, as a prominent example of the trend. The French film &quot;Blue Is the Warmest Colour&quot;, which won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival, has also been singled out as a notable example. Released in 2018, &quot;Love, Simon&quot; was the first major studio film to center a gay teenage romance.
More recently, Academy Award for Best Picture winners &quot;Moonlight&quot; and &quot;Everything Everywhere All at Once&quot; have been notable for prominently depicting queer characters.

<text>A console game is a type of video game consisting of images and often sounds generated by a video game console, which are displayed on a television or similar audio-video system, and that can be manipulated by a player. This manipulation usually takes place using a handheld device connected to the console, called a controller. The controller generally contains several buttons and directional controls such as analogue joysticks, each of which has been assigned a purpose for interacting with and controlling the images on the screen. The display, speakers, console, and controls of a console can also be incorporated into one small object known as a handheld game.

Console games usually come in the form of an optical disc, ROM cartridge, digital download or, in the case of dedicated consoles, stored on internal memory. The global console games market was valued at about $26.8 billion in 2018.

The differences between consoles create additional challenges and opportunities for game developers, as the console manufacturers (e.g. Nintendo, Microsoft, Sony, Sega, Atari) may provide extra incentives, support and marketing for console exclusive games. To aid development of games for consoles, manufacturers often create game development kits that developers can use for their work.

== History ==
=== Early console games ===

The first console games were for the Magnavox Odyssey, released in 1972, and consisted of simple games made of three white dots and a vertical line. These hardware limitations, such as the lack of any audio capability, meant that developers didn&#x27;t have freedom in the type of games they could create. Some games came packaged with accessories such as cards and dice to enhance the experience and make up for the shortcomings of the hardware.

The second generation of consoles introduced more powerful capabilities, less hardware limitations than the first generation, and coincided with the golden age of arcade video games. Developers had access to the console&#x27;s basic graphical capabilities, allowing them to create sprites of their choosing and more advanced sound capabilities. Controllers were beginning to include more buttons giving developers more freedom in the type of interactions they could provide to the player.

Due to the success of arcades, several games were adapted and released on consoles. In many cases, the quality had to be reduced because of the hardware limitations of consoles, but their popularity persisted: Pac-Man for the Atari 2600, a port of the original arcade game of the same name, was the best selling game for the console. 

The second generation of games introduced a number of notable gaming concepts for the first time. Adventure for the Atari 2600 introduced the concept of a virtual space bigger than the screen for the first time, with the game consisting of multiple rooms the player could visit as opposed to a single static screen. Video Olympics was one of the first console games to have a computer controlled opponent in its &quot;Robot Pong&quot; game mode and genres such as platforming and graphical adventure games emerged.

=== Video game industry crash ===

By the end of 1983, consoles had become cheaper to develop and produce, causing a saturation of consoles which in turn led to their libraries becoming saturated too. Due to this saturation of the market, the prices of games were low and, despite good sales figures, developers weren&#x27;t making enough profit from sales to justify staying in the market.

Despite heavy marketing, the quality of the games could not back up their claims, causing many companies to go out of business. The effects of the crash were primarily felt in the North American market but it still had an impact, albeit smaller, on the Asian and European markets.

In the years following the crash, console development was significantly reduced in the North American and European markets. Personal computers rose in popularity and began to fill the gap in the market that consoles had left. They had become affordable, were technologically superior, and had multiple other functions beyond gaming.

=== Third and fourth generations ===

The release of new consoles from Nintendo, Sega and Atari signified the start of the third (and fourth) generations, which also saw the introduction of notable franchises such as The Legend of Zelda, Star Fox, Sonic the Hedgehog, Final Fantasy, Metal Gear and Metroid.

The console manufacturers took back control of third-party development and regulated the market. Measures were introduced to ensure saturation did not happen again, including limiting the number of games a developer could release a year, controlling the manufacture of game cartridges, demanding payment for cartridges upfront, and ensuring newly developed games adhered to a set of rules set by console manufacturers. This put pressure on publishers and added a risk to development. It meant developers were forced to concentrate on the quality of their games more so than the quantity and speed at which they could be made.

Atari and Sega incorporated backward compatibility in the Atari 7800 and Master System respectively, elongating the lifespan of their early console games. Both companies never released another backward compatible console, with the partial exception that Master System games can be played on the Sega Genesis using a separately sold peripheral.

During this time, &quot;Metroid&quot; became notable for its open world the player could traverse in all directions, while most similar games were still primarily side-scrolling in a single direction. It also featured a strong female protagonist who is often credited for improving the portrayal of women in gaming. &quot;Star Fox&quot; was Nintendo&#x27;s first use of polygonal graphics and &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; introduced a rival to Nintendo&#x27;s mascot, Mario, who became a long-standing character for Sega in a number of different types of media.

=== From 2D to 3D ===
The fifth generation of consoles saw the move from 2D to 3D graphics and the change in storage media from cartridges to optical discs. Analogue controllers became popular, allowing for a finer and smoother movement control scheme compared to the directional pad. The use of full motion video became popular for cutscenes as optical discs allowed for the storage of high quality video with pre-rendered graphics that a game couldn&#x27;t render in real time.

Games released during the fifth generation took advantage of the new 3D technology with a number of notable franchises moving from 2D, such as &quot;Metal Gear&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, &quot;Mario&quot; and &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, the latter being considered influential not only to its genre but to video games as a whole. Other games that were released during this generation, such as Crash Bandicoot, GoldenEye 007, Resident Evil, Tomb Raider, and FIFA International Soccer&quot;,&quot; were influential in their own genres and started their own franchises that would span multiple generations and consoles. &quot;Resident Evil&quot; founded the genre of survival horror, while &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; popularised the stealth genre as well as storytelling through cinematic cutscenes rendered in game. &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; and &quot;Sega Rally Championship&quot; popularised realism in the racing genre with different surfaces and realistic features such as tire grip.

=== Internet capabilities ===
By the sixth generation the console market had become larger than the PC market.

While earlier consoles did provide online capabilities, it wasn&#x27;t until the sixth generation that online services became popular. Games introduced online features such as downloadable content, social features, and online multiplayer. Online networks were created by console developers such as PlayStation Network and Xbox Live providing a platform for games to utilise. Online multiplayer allowed players to play together from almost anywhere in the world, the social features of the platforms giving players the means to organise over these long distances.

Downloadable content became more prominent, allowing developers to release updates after a game was launched and include new content or fixes to existing issues.

== Technology ==
=== Inputs ===
Console games receive commands from the player through the use of an input device, commonly called a &quot;controller&quot;. Unlike a PC which uses a keyboard and mouse or a mobile device that uses a touch interface, console games are limited in their control schemes by the hardware available for the console. They usually include a method to move the player character (joystick, d-pad or analogue stick) and a variation of buttons to perform other in-game actions such as jumping or interacting with the game world. The type of controller available to a game can fundamentally change the style of how a console game will or can be played.

The limitation of the amount of buttons compared to a PC keyboard or a custom arcade cabinet means that controller buttons will commonly perform multiple different actions. For example, The Witcher 3 Xbox One controls uses the same button, the &quot;A&quot; button, to interact with the world when pressed and sprint when held, whereas the PC control scheme can separate these functions into separate buttons. The limitation of input keys can allow developers to create a more refined and succinct control scheme that can be learned by the player more easily. Different games in the same genre tend to use similar control schemes, allowing players to easily adapt to new games.

There are games that require additional accessories to act as alternative ways to control the game and to bypass the limitations of a standard game controller. Such items can include light guns, electronic instruments or racing wheels.

=== Display === 
Consoles commonly use a television as their visual output device: optimal for viewing at a greater distance by a larger audience. As a result, many video games are designed for local multiplayer play, with all players viewing the same TV set, with the screen divided into several sections and each player using a different controller.

Console games have generally had access to less computing power, less flexible computing power, and lower resolution displays, than games played on a PC. However, dedicated consoles were advanced graphically, especially in animation, as video game consoles had dedicated graphics hardware, were able to load data instantly from ROM, and had a low resolution output which would look better on a television, due to it naturally blurring the pixels.

=== Storage ===
Storage mediums play an important role in the development of a console game as it creates a fixed limit on the amount and quality of content that a game can have. Unlike arcade games but similar to PC and handheld games, console games are generally distributed separately from their platforms and require a form of storage to hold their data. There are 3 primary types of storage medium for consoles – cartridges, optical discs, and hard disk drives, all of which have considerably improved over time and provide more storage space to developers with each improvement.

==== Cartridge ====

Early cartridges had storage limitations which grew in size as the technology developed. They provided more security against third-party developers and the illegal copying of games. Some could be partially re-writable allowing for games to save their data to the cartridge itself meaning no extra saving media was required.

While cartridges became less popular with the introduction of disc based media, they are still popular to use for handheld consoles and are still in use on consoles in later generations such as the Nintendo Switch.

==== Disc ====

Discs became popular as the storage medium for console games during the fifth generation due to the ability to store large amounts of data and be produced cheaply. The increase in space provided developers with a medium to store higher quality assets, the downside being that progress could not be saved directly to the disc as it could with a cartridge. Most consoles that used discs had a means of saving games either on the console or in the form of a separate memory card, meaning developers had to control the size of their game saves.

==== Console storage ====

It is common for games after generation six to be stored partially or fully on the console itself, most commonly on a hard drive. Similarly to how a PC game can be installed, the console game can copy key files to the console&#x27;s storage medium, which is used to decrease load times but still requires the original game storage medium to play. The second method is for the game to be fully stored on the console and run directly from it, requiring no physical media to run at all. This offers players the opportunity to have games which have no physicality and can be downloaded through the Internet to their console, as well as giving the developers the ability to provide updates and fixes in the same manner, effectively meaning development on a game doesn&#x27;t have to stop once released.

As there is only a fixed amount of space on a console by default, developers do still have to be mindful of the amount of space they can take up, especially if the install is compulsory. Some consoles provide users the ability to expand their storage with larger storage mediums, provide access to removable storage and release versions of their console with more storage.

==== Cloud gaming ====

Cloud gaming services allow players to access games as a streaming service. Specialist hardware is not usually required to access these services and can be run from most modern PC operating systems, negating the need for a dedicated device for console gaming. The question of ownership is the biggest difference in comparison to other storage mediums for console games, as they could be considered only a method of renting the game.

OnLive is a cross between a console and other game streaming software. They provide hardware, considered to be a microconsole, that would connect to their service but only as means of displaying streamed content.

=== Emulation ===

To play console games on any other device than the console it has been developed for, emulation of that console is required whether it is software or hardware based emulation and some console developers will provide this as a means to play games from their older systems on newer devices. For example, the Xbox 360 provides some access to Xbox games and the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console has a customised emulator with each game tweaked to provide the best performance as opposed to a single emulator to do everything.

== Games&#x27; effect on console sales ==

While a PC is multi-functional and will be purchased to perform tasks other than gaming, a dedicated gaming console must have games available for it to be successful. A good library of games will give a consumer reason to purchase the console and in turn create opportunities for more games to be created for it. Console developers will lower their profit margins on devices to encourage sales of the games as more profit can be obtained from software royalties than the sale of the consoles themselves.

Games are frequently used to market a console and can do so either by exclusivity to a specific console or by using existing popular intellectual properties (IPs) that already have a strong following. &quot;Pac-Man&quot; for the Atari 2600 was already a well known arcade game and was expected to help the sales of 2600 devices due to its popularity despite it being heavily criticized.

=== Mascots ===
A strong mascot can come organically from a game and can play a large part of a console&#x27;s marketing strategy. A well designed and popular mascot will naturally generate further games. A good example of a mascot who has come from an existing game is Nintendo&#x27;s Mario. He was created as a character for the &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; arcade game and wasn&#x27;t expected to become popular yet has gone onto become one of the most iconic gaming characters in history.

A character from a game can be designed to serve as a mascot, such as Sonic the Hedgehog. He was created with the intent to rival Mario and was designed with abilities to counter Mario&#x27;s weaknesses.

Both mascots exist outside of their respective video games and have become a part of the identity of each company, appearing in various types of media such as TV shows, books, and movies, as well as a large number of other video games.

Following the emergence of mascots during the late 1980s and early 1990s, for a few years it was considered essential to a console&#x27;s sales that it have a game starring a popular mascot. However, video game mascots became increasingly unimportant to console sales during the mid-1990s, as the gaming industry&#x27;s main demographic grew older and thus less likely to find mascots appealing, with consoles&#x27; increased performance as well as cross-licensing demonstrating higher selling power. A number of once-successful mascots such as Bonk, Gex, Bubsy, and Zool were dropped from usage in both marketing and software releases during this time. The few surviving mascots remain relevant due to their value in increasing brand awareness.

== Development ==
The core development process for a console game is very similar to its counterparts and primarily differs in the high level concept due to demographics and the technical back-end. Consoles developers will usually make a development kit available to game developers which they can use to test their games on with more ease than a consumer model.

Early console games were commonly created by a single person and could be changed in a short amount of time due to the simplicity of the games at the time. As technology has improved, the development time, complexity and cost of console games has increased dramatically, to where the size of a team for an eighth generation game can number in the hundreds. Similarly, the programming languages used in video game development has changed over time with early games being developed primarily in assembly. As time went on developers had more choice on what they could use based on the availability on the console but some languages became more popular than others.

=== First and third party development ===
Many console developers have a branch of the company that develops games for their console and are considered &quot;first party&quot; developers, a concept that isn&#x27;t seen in PC development due to the variation of hardware configurations and lack of complete ownership of a system by a single manufacturer. First party developers have the advantage of having direct access to the console&#x27;s development, which allows them to make the most of the hardware they are developing for.

Companies that are separate from the console manufacturer are considered to be &quot;third-party&quot; developers. They commonly have restrictions placed upon them and their games by the console manufacturers as a way of controlling the library of their consoles.

=== Comparison between arcade, PC and handheld games ===
The primary differences between arcade game development and game development for other platforms are the fact that players are required to pay a small amount per play session, and that arcade games are mostly found at external venues. Arcade games are ultimately developed to try to get a continuous stream of revenue from the player and to keep them playing over the life of the machine. By comparison, console games have a high cost up front, meaning they have to guarantee a different experience for the player, primarily more content.

Handheld games, on the other hand, need to be accessible and enjoyable on a portable device, and should usually playable within a shorter time frame. This ultimately affects the type of games that are developed for portable consoles. Games that rely on long, unbroken sessions of gameplay or long cutscenes are not ideal for handhelds, whereas a console or PC player is expected to have longer play sessions. On handheld consoles of a smaller size, developers need to consider the amount of detail that will be visible to the player whereas console developers can safely assume their games will be played on a larger screen such as a television.

In comparison to PC and mobile games, console game developers must consider the limitations of the hardware their game is being developed for, as it is unlikely to have any major changes between the development phase and release. PC and mobile technology progresses quickly and there are many different configurations of their hardware and software. This is beneficial at the start of a console&#x27;s life cycle, as the technology will be cutting edge, but as the console ages, developers are forced to work with ageing hardware until the next generation of consoles is released. Earlier consoles games could be developed to take advantage of the fixed limitations of the consoles they were developed for, such as the MegaDrive&#x27;s capability of fast scrolling influencing design decisions made for &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;. Due to these hardware limitations the requirement of development kits and licenses required for development on a console is commonplace.

Developers of console games are also required to pay royalties to the console developers, while there is no centralised hardware developer for the PC equivalent.

=== Development kits ===

Early consoles didn&#x27;t have development kit versions; it was only around the fifth generation of consoles that development kits became common. Unlike PC games, console game development usually requires the use of a development kit for the console that the game is being developed for, as the hardware is often proprietary and is not freely available. The use of a development kit allows developers to access more detail about how their game is running on the kit and other advanced debugging options. The downside of needing access to specialist hardware such as a development kit is that it limits accessibility for hobbyists creating homemade or custom content. This grew into a benefit for PC games, as there is a more open environment for hobbyists to create and modify content even without developer support.

Some console developers have provided tools, such as the Net Yaroze software development kit, in an attempt to provide an avenue for hobbyists to create content.

=== Remakes and re-releases ===

Console games primarily started off as ports of arcade games. The timing of early consoles coincided with the golden age of arcade games which gave developers a good opportunity to maximise on their popularity, despite console hardware not yet being strong enough to run the games as they were originally. Arcade games effectively had to be remade for consoles, which usually meant lowering the quality in some way to make up for any hardware limitations. As technology improved and arcades reduced in popularity, it became console original games that would start to be ported to other devices.

Some consoles lack the ability to play games from previous generations, which allows a developer to release older games again but on the new consoles. The re-released game may be unchanged and simply be the same game but run on the new technology, or it may be changed by the developer to have improved graphics, sound or gameplay, a process known as remastering. Some re-releases can have added features, such as Final Fantasy VII, which added functions to speed the game up and turn off random enemy encounters.

When high definition technology was released, many games received high definition remakes. These can vary in terms of features, but usually include higher resolution textures, re-rendered videos, higher quality audio, and compatibility with newer display technologies. High definition remakes offer an additional revenue stream for a console game that was potentially at the end of its life. The developer of the remake is not always the same as the developer of the original game and some developers and publishers, such as Double Eleven, specialise in ports and remakes of other games.

=== Additional content === 
The development of additional content prior to the internet was limited due to limited distribution methods; more often than not, content had to be released as a new game entirely as opposed to an add-on to an existing one. For example, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City used the same mechanics and engine but was released as a separate game from Grand Theft Auto III, whereas a PC title such as Total Annihilation offered downloadable content from 1997. While some Dreamcast games offered downloadable content, they were severely limited by the storage space of the console.

The first console games to offer downloadable content properly were for the Xbox. Downloadable content can range from small content additions like extra items to larger ones that may include significant plot additions and extend the game considerably.

It wasn&#x27;t until the seventh generation, that console games began to support mods or custom content to the same extent as PC games.

== Ratings and censorship ==
Several systems exist worldwide to regulate the video games industry. Some, like the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) are composed of members of the industry themselves, while others, like Pan European Game Information (PEGI), are government-backed. The ESRB was started in 1994, was adopted as standard 10 years later, and is rated on the interactive experience as well as the content.

== Criticism == 
From time to time, video games have been criticized by parents&#x27; groups, psychologists, politicians, and some religious organizations for allegedly glorifying violence, cruelty, and crime, and exposing children to these elements. It is particularly disturbing to some that some video games allow children to act out crimes (for example, the &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; series), and reward them for doing so. Concerns that children who play violent video games may have a tendency to act more aggressively on the playground have led to voluntary rating systems adopted by the industry, such as the ESRB rating system in the United States and the PEGI rating system in Europe. They are aimed at educating parents about the types of games their children are playing, to let them make an informed decision on whether or not to allow them to play. Studies have shown that most parents who complain about their young children acting increasingly aggressive and violent on the school playground due to video games do not follow the ESRB and PEGI rating systems. Many parents complain about their children, as young as 8, acting out violence depicted in Call of Duty or &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot;, even though their ratings indicate the recommended age as 18 and above. 
Most studies, however, reached the conclusion that violence in video games is not causally linked with aggressive tendencies. This was the conclusion of a 1999 study by the United States government, prompting Surgeon General David Satcher to say, &quot;[...] we clearly associate media violence to aggressive behavior, but the impact was very small compared to other things. Some may not be happy with that, but that’s where the magic is.&quot; This was also the conclusion of a meta-analysis by psychologist Jonathan Freedman, who reviewed over 200 published studies and found that the majority did not find a causal link between violent tendencies and violence depicted in entertainment. 
Video game consoles were banned in China between June 2000 and July 2015.

<text>In the United States, the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Homeland Security]] Advisory System (HSAS) was a color-coded terrorism threat advisory scale created in March 2002 under the Bush administration in response to the September 11 attacks. The different levels triggered specific actions by federal agencies and state and local governments, and they affected the level of security at some airports and other public facilities. It was often called the &quot;terror alert level&quot; by the U.S. media. The system was replaced on April 27, 2011, with a new system called the National Terrorism Advisory System.

==History==
The system was created by Homeland Security Presidential Directive 3 on March 11, 2002, in response to the September 11 attacks. It was meant to provide a &quot;comprehensive and effective means to disseminate information regarding the risk of terrorist acts to federal, state, and local authorities and to the American people.&quot; It was unveiled March 12, 2002, by Tom Ridge, then the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security. However, responsibility for developing, implementing and managing the system was given to the U.S. Attorney General.

In January 2003, the new Department of Homeland Security (DHS) began administering the system. The decision to publicly announce threat conditions is made by the Secretary of Homeland Security in consultation with the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security, according to Homeland Security Presidential Directive-5.
On January 27, 2011, Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano announced that the Homeland Security Advisory System would be replaced by a new two-level National Terrorism Advisory System in April 2011. Napolitano, who made the announcement at George Washington University, said the color-coded system often presented &quot;little practical information&quot; to the public and that the new system will provide alerts &quot;specific to the threat&quot; and that &quot;they will have a specified end date.&quot;

==Description==
Inspired by the success of the forest fire color system, the scale consists of five color-coded threat levels, which were intended to reflect the probability of a terrorist attack and its potential gravity.

The specific government actions triggered by different threat levels were not always revealed to the public, although the government had provided general guidance for civilians and federal agencies. Actions previously included increasing police and other security presence at landmarks and other high-profile targets, a closer monitoring of international borders and other points of entry, ensuring that emergency response personnel were ready, and, in some cases, deployment of members of the National Guard and State Guard were sent to assist local law enforcement on security details.

Some of the actions taken as a result of the threat levels have been challenged as being illegal under the U.S. Constitution&#x27;s Fourth Amendment. For example, in November 2002, the city of Columbus, Georgia, forced all people wishing to protest at the School of the Americas to first submit to a metal detector search. The advocacy group School of the Americas Watch asked a federal trial court to enjoin the mass searches, but the court refused and simply dismissed the complaint. When the protestors appealed, the city justified the metal detector searches in part because of the &quot;yellow&quot; threat level. However, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit found that this was merely a &quot;post hoc&quot; justification for the searches, because the city had not even mentioned the terror alert system in its arguments at the trial court level. Even if the city did in fact rely on the alert system at the time it acted, said the court,

We ... reject the notion that the Department of Homeland Security&#x27;s threat advisory level somehow justifies these searches. Although the threat level was &quot;elevated&quot; at the time of the protest, &quot;[t]o date, the threat level has stood at yellow (elevated) for the majority of its time in existence. It has been raised to orange (high) six times.&quot; Given that we have been on &quot;yellow alert&quot; for over two and a half years now, we cannot consider this a particularly exceptional condition that warrants curtailment of constitutional rights. We cannot simply suspend or restrict civil liberties until the War on Terror is over, because the War on Terror is unlikely ever to be truly over. September 11, 2001, already a day of immeasurable tragedy, cannot be the day liberty perished in this country. Furthermore, a system that gave the federal government the power to determine the range of constitutionally permissible searches simply by raising or lowering the nation&#x27;s threat advisory system would allow the restrictions of the Fourth Amendment to be circumvented too easily. Consequently, the &quot;elevated&quot; alert status does not aid the City&#x27;s case.

&quot;Bourgeois v. Peters&quot;, 387 F.3d 1303, 1312 (11th Cir. 2004) Incidentally, this was also the first time that Wikipedia was quoted in a published decision of a federal appeals court.

The published terror alert notices urged American citizens, especially those traveling in the transportation systems, to &quot;be vigilant, take notice of their surroundings, and report suspicious items or activities to local authorities immediately.&quot; In addition, DHS advised the public to prepare an emergency preparedness kit and a family emergency plan.

==Criticism of the system==
===Objective criteria===
There were no published criteria for the threat levels, and thus no independent way to tell whether the current threat level was accurate. The threat levels Green (low risk) and Blue (general risk) were never used. The evidence cited to justify changes in threat levels had been stated vaguely (see below) and its sources were seldom revealed. Supporters of the system defended this by stating that providing detailed, current intelligence about terror organizations would endanger the ability to gather similar information in the future.

Some critics worried that the absence of clearly defined, objective criteria had allowed the baseline threat level to be established as elevated (yellow), thus precluding the system from ever dropping down to low (green) or general (blue). That limited the communicative value and options of the system to the three highest values. As persons become habituated to the threat level being perpetually elevated, they were increasingly likely to pay less attention to warnings issued.

===Political manipulation===
The lack of disclosure made the system vulnerable to manipulation by government officials. These attributes had been criticized by cartoonists, journalists, entertainers, and security experts.

The alert level was raised once in 2004, an election year, leading some critics to speculate that the Bush administration used them for political rather than strictly security reasons. In 2009, Ridge alleged in his book &quot;The Test of Our Times: America Under Siege ... and How We Can Be Safe Again&quot; that top aides to President Bush (including defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld and attorney general John Ashcroft) pressured him to raise the alert level on the eve of the November 2004 presidential election. Ridge refused. &quot;After that episode, I knew I had to follow through with my plans to leave the federal government for the private sector,&quot; he said.

In December 2004, the Homeland Security Advisory Council voted to review the color-coded system. One panel member suggested that it had outlived its usefulness. In a public forum, Ridge conceded the system had invited &quot;questions and even occasional derision.&quot; Ridge also said that he had not always agreed when others pushed to raise the threat level. &quot;Sometimes we disagreed with the intelligence assessment,&quot; Ridge said. &quot;Sometimes we thought even if the intelligence was good, you don&#x27;t necessarily put the country on [alert]. ... There were times when some people were really aggressive about raising it, and we said, &#x27;For that?&#x27;&quot;

On its terror alert page, DHS made clear that &quot;Raising the threat condition has economic, physical, and psychological effects on the nation.&quot; A study published in the January 2009 issue of the &quot;American Journal of Public Health&quot; found that the mentally ill, the disabled, African Americans, Latinos, Chinese Americans, Korean Americans, and non-U.S. citizens were likelier to think that the HSAS alert level was higher than it was, and to worry more and change their behavior due to those fears.

===Finding of flawed and bloated target list===
The inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) found that the list of terrorist target sites contained in the DHS &quot;National Asset Database&quot;, the sites that are supposed to receive extra security in response to heightened terror alerts, included many sites “whose criticality is not readily apparent” and should not be included on the list. For example, the list included a beach at the end of a street, a popcorn factory, a doughnut shop, and a petting zoo. By July 2006, the list included 77,069 target sites. The inspector general&#x27;s report found other wild discrepancies, for example, that the State of Indiana had 8,591 potential terrorist targets, 50% more targets than New York State with 5,687 targets, and more than twice as many as the State of California, which had only 3,212, even though New York and California are larger than Indiana and include more prominent American landmarks. DHS officials denied that there was anything wrong with the list.

===Task force===
A September 2009 report from the HSAS Task Force found that the &quot;current system had functioned reasonably well&quot; for institutional audiences, but that the &quot;system&#x27;s ability to communicate useful information in a credible manner to the public is poor&quot;, and that &quot;there is a disturbing lack of confidence in the system.&quot; The task force recommended that future threats be more narrowly targeted by &quot;specific region and sector under threat&quot;, rather than &quot;elevating the alert status of the nation as a whole&quot;, and that the number of levels be reduced from five to three to acknowledge that &quot;the new baseline for the United States is guarded.&quot; The task force was divided on whether to recommend abandonment of color-coding in the system, but asserted that if such a coding remains in use, &quot;substantial reform is required.&quot;

==Threat level changes==
The HSAS threat level changed 17 times . In August 2004, DHS began identifying specific sectors under possible threat, including aviation, financial services, and mass transit.

===Severe (Red)===
The threat level was raised to Severe only once, which applied only to flights coming from the United Kingdom:

*August 10–September 14, 2006, in response to British law enforcement announcing it had disrupted a major terror plot to blow up aircraft, DHS raised the threat level for commercial flights from the United Kingdom to the United States to Severe. The alert was extended into mid-September 2006 to coincide with the 5th Anniversary of the September 11 Attacks. Other noticeable recent attacks are the targeting of U.S. military and Frankfurt Airport.

===High (Orange)===
New York City&#x27;s threat level was High from the system&#x27;s introduction.
On a nationwide level, it was raised to High five times:

*September 10–24, 2002, the first anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks.
*February 7–27, 2003, near the end of the Muslim religious holiday Hajj. Intelligence reports suggested the possibility of terrorist attacks against &quot;apartment buildings, hotels, and other soft or lightly secured targets.&quot;
*March 17 – April 16, 2003, around the beginning of U.S. and Coalition military action in Iraq.
*May 20–30, 2003, after the Riyadh compound bombings and the Casablanca bombings. According to Tom Ridge: &quot;The U.S. Intelligence Community believes that Al Qaeda has entered an operational period worldwide, and this may include terrorist attacks in the United States.&quot;
*December 21, 2003 – January 9, 2004, citing intelligence information suggesting large-scale attacks around the holiday season. Since New York City&#x27;s level was already at High, NYPD commissioner Ray Kelly characterized this increased threat level as &quot;Orange Plus&quot;.

In addition, the alert was raised to High on a select or partial basis three times:

*August 1 – November 10, 2004, for specific financial institutions in northern New Jersey, New York, and Washington, D.C., citing intelligence pointing to the possibility of a car or truck bomb attack, naming specific buildings as possible targets.
*July 7, 2005 – August 12, 2005, for mass transit systems only. The DHS secretary announced the level after the 7 July 2005 London bombings despite the absence of &quot;specific, credible information suggesting imminent attack&quot; in the United States.
*August 10, 2006 – April 27, 2011, for all domestic and international flights to or from the United States, with the exception of flights from the United Kingdom to the United States, which had been under a Severe alert due to the 2006 transatlantic aircraft plot, but were downgraded to High on August 13, 2006.

===Elevated (Yellow)===
*March 12 – September 10, 2002
*September 25, 2002 – February 6, 2003
*February 28 – March 16, 2003
*April 17 – May 20, 2003
*May 31, 2003 – August 1, 2004
*November 10, 2004 – July 8, 2005
*August 12, 2005 – April 27, 2011 (Replaced by the National Terrorism Advisory System, but excludes domestic and international flights)

===Guarded (Blue) and Low (Green)===
The threat level was never lowered to Low (Green) or Guarded (Blue). It was recommended in a September 2009 Task Force report to remove the Low and Guarded conditions from the Alert System altogether and set Yellow (Elevated) to &quot;Guarded&quot; as the new baseline of the system, without changing the baseline conditions issued when under Yellow in the current system.

===Other terror warnings===

Other official terrorism warnings issued without raising the threat level above Elevated:

*July 11, 2007, reports that Al Qaeda has rebuilt operating capability, strength to level not seen before the September 11 attacks; strongest since summer of 2001.
*July 12, 2007, reports that Al Qaeda is stepping up efforts to sneak terrorists into the United States and has rebuilt capability to strike there.

<doc id="392696" wikidata="Q5228369" url="?curid=392696" title="United States v. Eichman">
<text>United States v. Eichman, 496 U.S. 310 (1990), was a United States Supreme Court case that by a 5–4 decision invalidated a federal law against flag desecration as a violation of free speech under the First Amendment. It was argued together with the case United States v. Haggerty. It built on the opinion handed down in the Court&#x27;s decision the prior year in &quot;Texas v. Johnson&quot; (1989), which invalidated on First Amendment grounds a Texas state statute banning flag burning.

==Background==
In response to &quot;Texas v. Johnson&quot;, the 101st Congress passed the Flag Protection Act of 1989, which attempted to circumvent the &quot;Johnson&quot; ruling by prohibiting mistreatment of the flag without regard to any message being conveyed. On the day that the law took effect, protests were staged around the nation. Demonstrators at two of these incidents, in Seattle and Washington, D.C., were arrested and charged under the revised statute.

In Seattle, flags were burned at a demonstration organized by Vietnam Veterans Against the War outside the Capitol Hill post office shortly after midnight, moments after the law took effect. No one was arrested during the demonstration, but four people identified from photographs were later charged with violating the federal Flag Protection Act of 1989: Mark Haggerty, Jennifer Campbell, Darius Strong and Carlos Garza. None of the four were members or supporters of VVAW-AI or the Revolutionary Communist Party. None of the four had been among the organizers of the demonstration or had previously known each other. 

In Washington, D.C., Gregory Lee Johnson, the defendant in &quot;Texas v. Johnson&quot;, staged a protest together with three companions – artists Dread Scott and Shawn Eichman and Vietnam veteran David Blalock – by burning flags on the steps of the United States Capitol building before a crowd of reporters and photographers. Scott had recently aroused controversy with a &quot;flag on the floor&quot; exhibit at the Art Institute of Chicago. Eichman was a member of the Coalition Opposed to Censorship in the Arts, and Blalock was a member of the Vietnam Veterans Against the War Anti-Imperialist. All four were supporters of the Revolutionary Communist Party and/or the Revolutionary Communist Youth Brigade. On the day of the protest they released a statement calling for others to express opposition to &quot;compulsory patriotism&quot; by burning the flag.

In both cases, federal district judges in Seattle and Washington, D.C. dismissed charges brought against the protesters, citing &quot;Texas v. Johnson&quot;. U.S. attorneys appealed the decisions directly to the Supreme Court. Because the Flag Protection Act called for expedited review, the two cases were consolidated into &quot;United States v. Eichman&quot; (1990), which would serve as a test case for the amended statute.

==Opinion of the Court==
In a 5–4 decision by Justice Brennan joined by Marshall, Blackmun, Scalia, and Kennedy, with 
Stevens, Chief Justice Rehnquist, White, and O&#x27;Connor dissenting (the same as in &quot;Texas v. Johnson&quot;), the Court held that the federal government, like the states, cannot prosecute a person for desecration of a United States flag, because to do so would be inconsistent with the First Amendment. The Government conceded that desecration of the flag constitutes expressive conduct and enjoys the First Amendment&#x27;s full protection. It is clear that the &quot;Government&#x27;s asserted interest&quot; in protecting the &quot;physical integrity&quot; of a privately owned flag in order &quot;to preserve the flag&#x27;s status as a symbol of the Nation&quot; and certain national ideals, is related to the suppression, and concerned with the content, of free expression.

The majority wrote that mere destruction or disfigurement of a symbol&#x27;s physical manifestation does not diminish or otherwise affect the symbol itself. The Government&#x27;s interest is implicated only when a person&#x27;s &quot;treatment of the flag communicates a message&quot; to others that is inconsistent with the identified ideals of the flag. The precise language of the Act&#x27;s prohibitions confirms Congress&#x27; interest in the communicative impact of flag destruction, since each of the specified terms – with the possible exception of &quot;burns&quot; – unmistakably connotes disrespectful treatment of the flag and suggests a &quot;focus on those acts likely to damage the flag&#x27;s symbolic value.&quot; This is further supported by the Act&#x27;s explicit exemption for disposal of worn or soiled flags, which the Act protects from prosecution since disposing a worn or soiled flag does not desecrate the flag&#x27;s symbolic nature. Thus, the Act is struck down as its restriction on expressive conduct cannot &quot;be justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech.&quot; It must therefore be subjected to &quot;the most exacting scrutiny,&quot; which cannot justify its infringement on First Amendment rights. While flag desecration – like virulent ethnic and religious epithets, vulgar repudiations of the draft, and scurrilous caricatures – is deeply offensive to many, &quot;the Government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable.&quot;

==Subsequent developments==

On remand, Eichman&#x27;s case was dismissed, as she and her fellow defendants had only been charged with flag desecration. However, the defendants in the &quot;Haggerty&quot; case had faced an additional charge of destruction of government property, as the burned flag was alleged to have been stolen from Seattle&#x27;s Capitol Hill Post Office. On those charges, all four Seattle defendants pleaded guilty and were fined. Carlos Garza and Darius Strong each served three days in jail.

When Republicans retook control of Congress in 1995 for the 104th session, the Flag Desecration Amendment was first proposed, which would grant the federal government the authority to proscribe flag burning. A resolution for this Amendment passed the House in every session from the 104th until the 109th Congress, but never got past the Senate (in the most recent vote in 2006 it failed by one vote 66–34), and has not been considered since.

<doc id="392704" wikidata="Q3369894" url="?curid=392704" title="League of Women Voters">
<text>The League of Women Voters (LWV) is a nonpartisan American nonprofit political organization. Founded in 1920, its ongoing major activities include registering voters, providing voter information, boosting voter turnout and advocating for voting rights. In addition, the LWV works with partners for specific campaigns including support for campaign finance reform, women&#x27;s rights, health care reform and gun control.

The League was founded as the successor to the National American Woman Suffrage Association, which had led the nationwide fight for women&#x27;s suffrage. The initial goals of the League were to educate women to take part in the political process and to push forward legislation of interest to women. As a nonpartisan organization, an important part of its role in American politics has been to register and inform voters, but it also lobbies for issues of importance to its members, which are selected at its biennial conventions. Its effectiveness has been attributed to its policy of careful study and documentation of an issue before taking a position. Its bylaws do not allow it to endorse candidates or political parties. In the Trump era, the strong response by the league to political polarization and core issues such as voting rights has weakened support for it on the right.

== Activities ==

=== VOTE411.org ===
VOTE411.org is a nonpartisan bilingual website in English and Spanish that allows voters to input their address and get candidate and election information tailored to their location. Candidate survey responses to three questions specific to the office are included on the site. The League of Women Voters, including state and local leagues, runs the site which received a 2020 Webby Award.

=== National Voter Registration Day ===
In 2012, LWV created National Voter Registration Day, a day when volunteers work to register voters and increase participation.

=== Sponsoring debates ===
State and local leagues host candidate debates to provide candidates&#x27; positions at all levels of government.

== History ==

===Founding===

The League of Women Voters was created in 1920 as the merger of two existing organizations, the long-established National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) and the National Council of Women Voters (NCWV).

The founding goals of the National League of Women Voters were to educate women on election processes and lobby for favorable legislation on women&#x27;s issues. These were the same as the goals of the NCWV, which had been founded by Emma Smith DeVoe after her proposal for such an organization was rebuffed at the 1909 National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) convention in Seattle. When her proposal was ignored, DeVoe founded the National Council of Women Voters in 1911. She recruited western suffragists and organizations to join the NCWV.

Ten years later, prior to the 1919 Convention of the NAWSA (in St. Louis, Missouri), Carrie Chapman Catt began negotiating with DeVoe to merge her organization with a new league that would be the successor to the NAWSA. Even though continuing as the NCWV might have made sense because the goals were essentially those that Catt proposed for the new organization, Catt was concerned that DeVoe&#x27;s alignment with the more radical Alice Paul might discourage conservative women from joining it and thus proposed the formation of a new league. In founding the League of Women Voters, Catt sought to create a political process that was rational and issue-oriented, dominated by citizens, not politicians. She feared that alliance with political parties would reduce the independence of these organizations and swallow up their concerns in more partisan concerns. In addition, by endorsing one candidate the organization would inevitably lose the support of the opposing candidate. As fifteen states had already ratified the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the women wanted to move forward with a plan to educate women on the voting process and shepherd their participation.

A motion was made at the 1919 NAWSA convention to merge the two organizations into a successor, the National League of Women Voters. Although not all members of either organization were in favor of a merger, the merger was officially completed on January 6, 1920. For the first year the league operated as a committee of the NAWSA. The formal organization of the League was drafted at the 1920 Convention held in Chicago.

In her presidential address on March 24, 1919, at the above-mentioned NAWSA convention, Catt had said:

Carrie Chapman Catt was named honorary chairman of the League instead of president because she insisted that it was for younger and fresher women to lead the new work.

As time passed, women&#x27;s political organizations did find that political parties redefined issues of concern to them as &quot;women&#x27;s issues&quot; and pushed them aside.

Throughout the first part of its history, the League of Women Voters was not welcoming to women of color and its predecessor NAWSA ignored issues involving race due to fears that it would reduce support for equal suffrage. 

In subsequent years, due to the increasing influence of women in politics, the league has evolved a more inclusive mission, to &quot;protect and expand voting rights and ensure everyone is represented in our democracy.&quot;

===1920–1930===
The issues of primary concern to the League in the 1920s were extending the Sheppard-Towner Act first passed in 1921, a Child Labor Amendment to the Constitution, and voter education.

The Sheppard-Towner Act, first passed in 1921, provided federal subsidies to those states that provided education in maternity and infant care. It was initially slated for five years, and was twice extended in the 1920s, but finally failed to pass in 1929.

On October 17, 1929, Belle Sherwin, the president of the League of Women Voters, and Ruth Morgan of New York City headed a delegation to ask President Herbert Hoover to support the renewal of Federal aid to the States in maternity and infancy work.
It was later revived as part of the Social Security Act of 1935.


In 1923, a special committee of the national League of Women Voters picked twelve women as the &quot;greatest living American women.&quot; They were Jane Addams, Cecilia Beaux, Annie Jump Cannon, Carrie Chapman Catt, Anna Botsford Comstock, Minnie Maddern Fiske, Louise Homer, Julia Lathrop, Florence Rena Sabin, M. Carey Thomas, Martha Van Rensselaer, and Edith Wharton.

At the 1926 convention of the national League, Belle Sherwin, the League president, emphasized education in politics as the right road toward true democracy.
Whether it is possible to develop in this country an education which will qualify citizens to be partners in government is a question to face squarely.

For many, education today is either remote and limited to a brief period or is highly specialized for vocational purposes. Education for active citizenship has hardly been tried. 
She went on to mention &quot;the modest attempts of schools here and there to teach critical reading of the newspapers and other means of avoiding mob-mindedness.&quot;
Prohibition and birth control were hot issues that year, but were not included in the subjects for study and legislation during the ensuing year.

In 1926, The New York League together with the Women&#x27;s National Republican Club established information booths in seven department stores, explaining to women how to register to vote, and installed a voting machine at League headquarters to demonstrate how to vote. The League members explained literacy tests and requirements and hours for registration. A frequent question involved the status of an American woman married to an immigrant. The League also presented a series of pre-election talks, including a talk on &quot;National and State Legislators,&quot; &quot;The Judiciary,&quot; and &quot;Machinery of Elections.&quot;

At the 1929 convention of the League of Women Voters of New York, the members voted for a New York State prohibition enforcement act. They also voted to favor old age pensions and ask the Legislature to give women the right to do jury service, to permit physicians to give contraceptive information to married persons, and to extend the benefits of workmen&#x27;s compensation for all occupational diseases.

During the 1920s, the League of Women Voters of New York sent an annual questionnaire to candidates for local office, and published the answers in the publication &quot;Information for Voters.&quot;
In 1929, the questionnaire covered maintaining the 5 cent subway fare, creation of a permanent city planning board, immediate action on a sewage and waste disposal plant, unlimited building heights in certain districts, and reclassification of civil service employees to provide automatic salary increases.

In the 1930s, the League was supportive of New Deal programs such as Social Security and the Food and Drug Acts.

=== 1940–1969 ===
In 1945, the League advocated for the United Nations, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund, and was recognized by the UN as a permanent observer, giving it access to most meetings and relevant documentation.
 
In the 1950s, League member Dorothy Kenyon was attacked as a Communist by Joseph McCarthy and president Percy Maxim Lee testified before Congress against Senator Joseph McCarthy&#x27;s abuse of congressional investigative powers.
In 1960, the League supported the Resources and Conservation Act of 1960 (S. 2549), beginning a long history of environmental engagement. 
The league ultimately supported the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, but their efforts came too late to have major impact. After first refusing to oppose discrimination in housing in 1966, the 1968 program included opposition to discrimination in housing and support for presidential suffrage for citizens of Washington, DC.

In 1969, the League was one of the first organizations in the United States calling for normalizing relations with China.

===1970–2000===
In the 1970s, after years of opposition to the Equal Rights Amendment as proposed by the National Women&#x27;s Party, the League offered support to an Equal Rights Amendment.

In 1974, the League began to admit men.

In 1975, a bill entitled &quot;The Indian Law Enforcement Improvement Act&quot; was introduced in the Senate and supported by the League of Women Voters of Nebraska, saying &quot;We support self determination and therefore self government of all citizens, in this case Native Americans.&quot; After two days of hearings, the bill was not reported out of committee.

The LWV sponsored the United States presidential debates in 1976, 1980 and 1984. On October 2, 1988, the LWV&#x27;s 14 trustees voted unanimously to pull out of the debates, and on October 3 they issued a press release condemning the demands of the major candidates&#x27; campaigns. LWV President Nancy Neuman said that the debate format would &quot;perpetrate a fraud on the American voter&quot; and that the organization did not intend to &quot;become an accessory to the hoodwinking of the American public.&quot; All presidential debates from 1988 until 2020 were sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, a bipartisan organization run by the two major parties that some argue has established rules with the intent to exclude airing candidates associated with other parties.

In 1998, the League elected its first African-American president, Carolyn Jefferson-Jenkins.
 She served two terms, until 2002, and wrote a book &quot;The untold story of women of color in the League of Women Voters&quot; documenting the history of the League and women of color.

The League fought for the 1982 Amendments to the Voting Rights Act and in the 1990s was important in the passage of National Voter Registration Act of 1993, popularly known as the Motor Voter Act.
 The act requires states to offer voter registration at all driver&#x27;s license agencies, at social service agencies, and through the mail.

===2000–present===
In 2002, the League supported the Help America Vote Act (with some reservations about the final compromise)
 and the Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Act.

In 2014, the League sponsored voter guides including Smart Voter and Voter&#x27;s Edge in collaboration with MapLight.

In 2018, the league took an extraordinary step in opposing Brett Kavanaugh&#x27;s confirmation due in part to his sexual assault allegations and fears around judicial independence.

In 2020, the League of Women Voters supported Native Americans in seeking to remove restrictions on ballot delivery from reservations.

The Native American voting rights group Four Directions filed a suit on behalf of six voters from the Navajo Nation asking the court to extend the deadline for Arizona counties to receive the ballots of voters, because of &quot;lack of home mail delivery, the need for language translation, lack of access to public transportation and lack of access to any vehicle.&quot; The court declined to extend the deadline due to lack of standing of the plaintiffs.

The League of Women Voters of Arizona filed an amicus curiae, saying that 
Most Arizonans take access to mail receipt and delivery as a given. By contrast, the District Court recognized the painful reality that &quot;several variables make voting by mail difficult” for Native American voters. More specifically, “[m]ost Navajo Nation residents do not have access to standard mail service,” including home delivery, and must travel “lengthy distance[s]” to access postal servicesa burden compounded by “socioeconomic factors.”

In 2021, the League of Women Voters of Florida partnered with VoteRiders to get word out to eligible voters about the changes made due to Floria Senate Bill 90, signed into law in May 2021. The Florida League also partnered with the Black Voters Matter Fund and the Florida Alliance for Retired Americans to file lawsuits against the changes. The trial court struck down multiple provisions of the law but the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a stay reinstating the restrictive law.

After the United States Capitol attack of January 6, 2021, the league&#x27;s board called Trump a &quot;tyrannical despot&quot; and advocated his removal by legal means. This, among other positions such as around transgender rights and police accountability, have led more Republicans to criticize the league and not respond to VOTE411 candidate surveys. Some Republican-led states have been making voter registration more difficult, prompting the league to stop registering voters in Kansas, for example, for fear of its members facing prosecution. Richard Hasen argues that it would be tough to be seen as neutral when voting rights, a foundational issue for the league, have become a seemingly partisan issue.

==Policy views==

The League lobbies for legislation at the national, state, and local levels. Positions on national issues are determined by decisions at the most recent national convention. Members of state and local leagues determine their leagues&#x27; positions on state and local issues, consistent with the national positions.

The League was founded by suffragists fighting for the right of women to vote and has always been concerned with issues around voting and representative government. Other issue areas in which the League currently advocates are international relations, natural resources, and social policy.

===Voting and representative government===

In 1993, the League pushed for the adoption of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, which requires states to offer voter registration at all driver&#x27;s license agencies, at social service agencies, and through the mail.
The League works with the non-partisan VoteRiders organization to spread state-specific information on voter ID requirements. In 2002, the League endorsed passage of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, which banned soft money in federal elections and made other reforms in campaign finance laws. It was also a major proponent of the Help America Vote Act.

In 2010, the League opposed the Supreme Court decision &quot;Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission&quot;, which removed limits on corporate contributions to candidates. It filed an amicus brief in support of the FEC.

The League supports the DISCLOSE Act, which would provide for greater and faster public disclosure of campaign spending and combat the use of &quot;dark money&quot; in U.S. elections.

The League currently opposes restrictive photo ID laws and supports campaign finance reform in the United States, including public financing of elections, restrictions on spending by candidates, and abolishing super-PACs.

===International relations===

The League lobbied for the establishment of the United Nations, and later became one of the first groups to receive status as a nongovernmental organization with the U.N. The League was active from the beginning in promoting world peace and international organizations.

===Natural resources===

The League supported the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Kyoto Protocol. The League opposes the proposed Keystone Pipeline project. In January 2013, the League of Women Voters in Hawaii urged President Obama to take action on climate change under the authority given him by the Clean Air Act of 1963.

===Social policy===
The League opposes school vouchers. In 1999, the League of Women Voters of Florida challenged a Florida law that allowed students to use school vouchers to attend other schools.
The League supports universal health care and endorses both Medicaid expansion and the Affordable Care Act.

The League supports the abolition of the death penalty.

===LGBT+ rights===
LWV supports LGBT+ rights and has stated that &quot;defending our democracy and ending discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community go hand in hand.&quot; It has also supported the rights of transgender athletes.

==Governance==
===National===
A national board of directors consisting of four officers, eight elected directors, and not more than eight board-appointed directors, most of whom reside in the Metro Washington D.C. area, govern the League subject to the Bylaws of the League of Women Voters of the United States. The national board is elected at the national convention and sets position policy.

===State and local leagues===
Local Leagues and state Leagues are organized in order to promote the purposes of the League and to take action on local and state governmental matters. These Leagues (chapters) have their own directors and officers. The national board may withdraw recognition from any state or local League for failure to fulfill recognition requirements.

The League of Women Voters has state and local leagues in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Virgin Islands, and Hong Kong.

<doc id="392707" wikidata="Q794605" url="?curid=392707" title="Biblical studies">
<text>Biblical studies is the academic application of a set of diverse disciplines to the study of the Bible, with &quot;Bible&quot; referring to the books of the canonical Hebrew Bible in mainstream Jewish usage and the Christian Bible including the canonical Old Testament and New Testament, respectively. For its theory and methods, the field draws on disciplines ranging from ancient history, historical criticism, philology, theology, textual criticism, literary criticism, historical backgrounds, mythology, and comparative religion.

==Definition==

The &quot;Oxford Handbook of Biblical Studies&quot; defines the field as a set of various, and in some cases independent disciplines for the study of the collection of ancient texts generally known as the Bible. These disciplines include but are not limited to historical criticism, archaeology, hermeneutics, textual criticism, cultural anthropology, history, the history of interpretation, sociology, theology, and patristics.

==Academic societies==

Several academic associations and societies promote research in the field. The largest is the Society of Biblical Literature (SBL) with around 8,500 members in more than 80 countries. It publishes many books and journals in the biblical studies, including its flagship, the &quot;Journal of Biblical Literature&quot;. SBL hosts one academic conference in North America and another international conference each year, as well as smaller regional meetings. Others include the European Association of Biblical Studies, the Canadian Society of Biblical Studies, the Evangelical Theological Society, the Institute for Biblical Research, the American Schools of Oriental Research, and the Catholic Biblical Association.

==Biblical criticism==

Biblical criticism is the scholarly &quot;study and investigation of biblical writings that seeks to make discerning judgments about these writings&quot;. Viewing biblical texts as being ordinary pieces of literature, rather than set apart from other literature, as in the traditional view, biblical criticism asks when and where a particular text originated; how, why, by whom, for whom, and in what circumstances it was produced; what influences were at work in its production; what sources were used in its composition; and what message it was intended to convey. It varies slightly depending on whether the focus is on the Hebrew Bible, the Old Testament, the letters of New Testament or the canonical gospels. It also plays an important role in the quest for a historical Jesus.

It also addresses the physical text, including the meaning of the words and the way in which they are used and its preservation, history and integrity. Biblical criticism draws upon a wide range of scholarly disciplines, including archaeology, anthropology, folklore, comparative religion, oral tradition studies and historical and religious studies.

New Testament and Old Testament rhetorical analysis differ because of the context in which they were written. The New Testament was written during a time that had many new Greek and Roman ideas on literature and rhetoric, which provide an avenue for what was known and give additional resources to study New Testament texts in those contexts.

Old Testament texts were not written in the same context, and due to their ancient nature have few additional resources to refer to for common themes in rhetoric and literature. There are many abstract text styles in the Old Testament, including historical accounts, proverbs, poetic texts, praise texts (such as psalms) and prophetic texts. The New Testament is different in that it has primarily two styles present: the gospels, which are mostly historical accounts, and the letters, or epistles.

When it comes to textually analyzing and criticizing the New Testament, there are a couple of eclectic approaches to understanding the text on a deeper level. External criticism in the context of biblical studies involves understanding the who, what, and when of New Testament texts. It does not analyze within the text itself, which is referred to as internal criticism. External criticism focuses on the source and dates of text and what type of text it is (in the New Testament, that is mostly a gospel account or a letter to a church or person). Internal criticism focuses specifically on the content and nature of the texts. Things like the literary style and the theology of the author may affect how one reads the text. That may require some external criticism knowledge since who the author is will shine light on why they may be saying what they are saying.

== Biblical exegesis ==
Biblical exegesis is the explanation or interpretation of the scriptures traditionally known as The Bible. Much biblical exegesis is founded upon historical-literary dynamics, either using scripture to interpret history and science, or using science and history to interpret scripture.

This is particularly important when applied to the person of Jesus Christ and the Gospels in the New Testament. Many people agree that Jesus was a real historical person, but whether he was truly the Son of God is debatable among many people, and this distinction proves to be important for one&#x27;s interpretation of texts and whether the Gospels should be read literally or symbolically.

The Book of Revelation is very different from the other books of the Bible, drawing need for additional analysis to determine whether it should be read literally or symbolically. The goals of the author of the book (John) also have implications toward how one reads the book. If one reads Revelation as a literal unfolding of the end times vs reading Revelation as a highly symbolic book, there will be different outcomes in the interpretation of particular sections.

Additionally, one&#x27;s view of the scriptures as sacred and written by God or as a historical text has implications on one&#x27;s interpretation of text.

==Textual criticism==

Textual criticism is a branch of textual scholarship, philology, and literary criticism that is concerned with the identification and removal of transcription errors in texts, both manuscripts and printed books. Ancient scribes made errors or alterations when copying manuscripts by hand. Given a manuscript copy, several or many copies, but not the original document, the textual critic seeks to reconstruct the original text (the urtext, archetype or autograph) as closely as possible. The same processes can be used to attempt to reconstruct intermediate editions, or recensions, of a document&#x27;s transcription history. The ultimate objective of the textual critic&#x27;s work is the production of a &quot;critical edition&quot; containing a text most closely approximating the original.

There are three fundamental approaches to textual criticism: eclecticism, stemmatics, and copy-text editing. Techniques from the biological discipline of cladistics are currently also being used to determine the relationships between manuscripts.

The phrase &quot;lower criticism&quot; is used to describe the contrast between textual criticism and &quot;higher criticism&quot;, which is the endeavor to establish the authorship, date, and place of composition of the original text.

== Biblical history ==

Historical research has often dominated modern biblical studies. Biblical scholars usually try to interpret a particular text within its original historical context and use whatever information is available to reconstruct that setting. Historical criticism aims to determine the provenance, authorship, and process by which ancient texts were composed. Famous theories of historical criticism include the documentary hypothesis, which suggests that the Pentateuch was compiled from four different written sources, and different reconstructions of &quot;the historical Jesus&quot;, which are based primarily on the differences between the canonical Gospels.

There is much controversy around using the Bible as a historical source. The Old Testament is supposed to serve as a continuous account of the establishment of ancient Israel. While many historians agree that figures like King David and King Solomon are real historical figures, there comes trouble when seeking to affirm or deny events like the creation of the world and the flood of Noah. The use of terms like &quot;myth&quot; vs &quot;history&quot; also creates controversy due to some connotations that each word has. Oftentimes &quot;myth&quot; or &quot;mythical&quot; texts are seen as not true stories, where as &quot;history&quot; or &quot;historical&quot; texts are seen as fact. Mythical stories can also sometimes be seen as stories which serve some sort of religious or moral lesson, but are not necessarily true, however this does not mean that true historical stories do not have religious and moral lessons that accompany them. These views on myth and history are examples of a few difficulties when it comes to analyzing the Old Testament as a historical text.

New Testament historical analysis is also difficult due to the nature of the original texts that we can analyze, specifically their translatability as well as how oral tradition had effects on written tradition during the formation and canonization of gospel texts and the teachings of Jesus.

==Original languages==

The Hebrew Bible, the textual basis of the Christian Old Testament (although with order rearranged and some books split into two), was written in Biblical Hebrew, although a few chapters were written in Biblical Aramaic. Deuterocanonical books removed from the Old Testament in some Protestant Christian Bibles are variously written in Hebrew, Greek or Aramaic. The New Testament was written in Koine Greek, with possible Aramaic undertones, as was the first translation of the Hebrew Bible, known as the Septuagint or Greek Old Testament. Therefore, Hebrew, Greek and sometimes Aramaic continue to be taught in most universities, colleges and seminaries with strong programs in biblical studies.

There are few original Old Testament/Hebrew Bible manuscripts, and while the ancient translations (such as the Septuagint) are available, there comes a problem with comparing the translation to the original Hebrew (because we have it). This may lead to problems of establishing the reliability of translations like the Septuagint. In order to overcome this, researches have come up with methods to use the very few manuscripts we have and continually draw conclusions and compare to original texts using those conclusions to provide more reliability to available texts. In order to indicate if a translation is authentic or not, it is crucial to look for keywords that may seem unique and that are not translated from a root language such as Hebrew or any of the other original languages. This shows that there are many other languages present in the translations that seems as if it was reinvented over and over again. However, it is normal to see such a change, and it shows the difference between the original writings versus the final outcome of the translations. Although the Bible was originally written in Hebrew, it was first translated into Old Greek in the 3rd century BC. This was still translated into the Old Testament. However, when the Bible was translated into the New Testament, it was now in Greek, or in other words, Koine Greek which is also known as Biblical Greek.

<text>Education in Argentina is a responsibility shared by the national government, the provinces and federal district and private institutions. Education at all levels, including university, is free. President Domingo Sarmiento&#x27;s assertion that &quot;the sovereign should be educated&quot; has been a keystone of Argentine Education since 1918. Education has been extended nearly universally and its maintenance remains central to political and cultural debate. There are a significant number of private schools and universities despite free schooling.

Education in state institutions is at the initial, primary, secondary and tertiary levels and in the undergraduate university level (not for graduate programs). Private education is paid, although in some cases (especially in primary and secondary schools) state subsidies support its costs. 

According to studies by UNESCO, guarantee equality to have institutional features that hinder the commercialization of education, as well as Finland has characteristics that favor multiethnic population education and special education, education favors Argentina equality. Illiteracy rates in Argentina are very low. According to the last census, the illiteracy rate is 1.9%, the second lowest in Latin America. In the last decade, Argentina has created nine new universities, while the outflow of university students increased by 68%.

==History==
The education in Argentina known as the &quot;Latin American docta&quot; has had a convoluted history. There was no effective education plan until President Domingo Sarmiento (1868–1874) placed emphasis on bringing Argentina up-to-date with practices in developed countries. Sarmiento encouraged the immigration and settling of European educators and built schools and public libraries throughout the country, in a program that doubled the enrollment of students during his term. Teacher&#x27;s Day (on September 11) commemorates his death. The first national laws mandating universal, compulsory, free and secular education (Law 1420 of Common Education) were sanctioned in 1884 during the administration of President Julio Roca. The non-religious character of this system, which forbade parochial schools from issuing official degrees directly but only through a public university, harmed the relations between the Argentine State and the Catholic Church, leading to resistance from the local clergy and a heated conflict with the Holy See (through the Papal Nuncio).

Following the University Reform of 1918, Argentine education, especially at university level, became more independent of the government, as well as the influential Catholic Church. The church began to re-emerge in country&#x27;s secular education system during the administration Juan Perón, when in 1947, catechism was reintroduced in public schools, and parochial institutions began again receiving subsidies. A sudden reversal in the policy in 1954 helped lead to Perón&#x27;s violent overthrow, after which his earlier, pro-clerical policies were reinstated by General Pedro Aramburu. Aramburu&#x27;s Law 6403 of 1955, which advanced private education generally, and parochial, or more often, Catholic-run schools (those staffed with lay teachers), in particular, helped lead to the establishment of the Argentine Catholic University.

The program of deregulation and privatization pursued by President Carlos Menem in reaction to the country&#x27;s socio-economic crisis of 1989 led to the decentralization of the Argentine secondary school system, whereby, from 1992 onward, the schools&#x27; administration and funding became a provincial responsibility. The policy&#x27;s weakness, however, lay in that federal revenue sharing did not increase accordingly, particularly given the decision to shift two primary school years to the secondary system.

Real government spending on education increased steadily from the return of democratic rule in 1983 (with the exception of the crises in 1989 and 2002) and, in 2007, totaled over US$14 billion.

==Achievements==
In spite of its many problems, Argentina&#x27;s higher education managed to reach worldwide levels of excellence in the 1960s. Up to 2013 Argentina educated five Nobel Prize winners, three in the sciences: Luis Federico Leloir, Bernardo Houssay and César Milstein and two in peace: Carlos Saavedra Lamas and Adolfo Pérez Esquivel, the highest number surpassing countries economically more developed and populated as Ireland or Spain. In addition, as of 2010, Argentines are the only South Americans to have ever been honoured with a Rolf Schock Prize.

The Argentine population benefits from a relatively high level of educational attainment, by regional standards. Among those age 20 and over, the highest level attained, per the 2010 Census, was distributed thus:

==Characteristics==
Education in Argentina has four levels and two different systems: initial level (kindergarten, &quot;educación inicial&quot;), primary level (&quot;educación primaria&quot;), secondary level (&quot;educación secundaria&quot;) and tertiary level (&quot;educación superior&quot;).

In some provinces, primary level is called &quot;educación primaria&quot; or &quot;EP&quot; (Spanish for &quot;primary education&quot;) and comprises grades first to sixth. Secondary level, called &quot;educación secundaria&quot; or &quot;ES&quot; (Spanish for &quot;secondary education&quot;) comprises grades first to sixth (called &quot;years&quot;). EP and ES are divided in two stages, called &quot;ciclos&quot; (&quot;cycles&quot;):

# EP: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th school grades
# ES: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th school years

In some other provinces EP comprises grades first to seventh (the traditional system, established by Argentine law 1420/1884). ES comprises grades first to fifth (the traditional system, in use throughout the 20th century).

In both systems EP is mandatory to all students, as well as secondary education, according to the National Educational Law established in 2011.

The fourth stage is tertiary education, which includes both college and university education.

Education is funded by tax payers at all levels except for the majority of graduate studies. There are many private school institutions in the primary, secondary and university levels. Around 11.4 million people were enrolled in formal education of some kind in 2005:

1 &quot;excludes 185,776 teachers not classified by level&quot;
===Qualification modes of grading===

The scale to grade up the academic performance in students at most of the primary and secondary schools rests in the 1-10 ladder as is described in the following frame.

As of the start of the 2019 school year, in 16 out of 24 jurisdictions (23 provinces + the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires), 6 is the minimum passing grade, while in the others is 7.
In the University System however the scale can vary depending on the independent policies and statutes of grading of each independent Argentine University.

===Primary education===

Accepted between ages 6 and 14.
Primary education is the first EP cycle (grades 1–6). Because of the system that was in place during 1995–2007, most schools that offered 7 years of primary school prior to 1995 were forced to be converted and accept grades 8th and 9th, while others chose to eliminate 7th grade altogether, forcing students to complete the 3rd cycle in another institution.

===Secondary education===
Secondary education in Argentina comprises two levels. Years 1st to 3rd are common to all schools (&quot;Ciclo básico&quot;). Years 4th to 6th (in some provinces 4th to 5th) are organized in orientations (&quot;Ciclo orientado&quot;) such as Social Sciences, Natural Sciences, Arts, Sport, Design, etc. An additional year is offered in certain schools (Technical-Professional schools), which grants a professional title, also with orientations (agriculture, electricity, mechanics, construction, etc.).

In many provinces the secondary education system is still divided in three traditional large groups, &quot;Bachiller&quot; schools (very similar to grammar schools with a huge emphasis on humanistic studies), &quot;Comercial&quot; schools (focusing on economic sciences and everything related to it) and &quot;Escuelas Técnicas&quot; (with a focus on technical and scientific assignments, this one having the particularity of lasting six/seven years instead of five/six, it used to be called &quot;Industrial&quot;) each one subdivided in more specific orientations related to its main branch.

In December 2006 the Chamber of Deputies of the Argentine Congress approved a new National Education Law restoring the old system of primary followed by secondary education, making secondary education obligatory and a right, and increasing the length of compulsory education to 12 years. The transitional period ended in 2011.

In addition an adult system of high schools (usually called &quot;Acelerados&quot;, Spanish for accelerated) exists in order to guarantee secondary education to people over 18. Normally it consists in 2 or 3 years of intensive program of study, which includes a 16 hour school day starting from 6am to 10pm, and it is provided by a large number of public and private schools varying on each province. Night shift is available in order to satisfy those who work during the day. These high school diplomas are accepted to enroll in a university.

Argentina&#x27;s network of vocational schools, many under the auspices of the National Technological University (UTN) or the provincial educational systems, have historically given students viable alternatives, as well.

===International education===
As of January 2015, the International Schools Consultancy (ISC) listed Argentina as having 160 international schools. ISC defines an &#x27;international school&#x27; in the following terms &quot;ISC includes an international school if the school delivers a curriculum to any combination of pre-school, primary or secondary students, wholly or partly in English outside an English-speaking country, or if a school in a country where English is one of the official languages, offers an English-medium curriculum other than the country’s national curriculum and is international in its orientation.&quot; This definition is used by publications including The Economist.

===Higher Education in Argentina===

Argentine higher education system is based on the Spanish higher education system, a Continental education system. This is notable in its difference from the Anglo-Saxon Model. This has been true since its conception during the colonial period. The University Reform of 1918, took place in the oldest university in the Country, the Universidad de Córdoba. This revolution paved the way to the modernization of the Argentinian higher university systems as it is known nowadays. Since its foundation, it was focused on the teaching of Professions offering Professional degrees.

* Higher education institutes: 1- to 5-year degrees related to education or technical professions like Teachers, Professorship, Technicians.
* Universities: 4- to 7-years of professional education taught at universities offering many different degrees, such as Licentiate, Engineer&#x27;s degree, Medic Title, Attorney Title, Professorships, Translation degrees, etc.
* Post-graduate degrees: This is a specialized and research-oriented education level. It is roughly divided in a first sub-level where a Specialist degree can be obtained in a 12–18 months period or Master&#x27;s degree, requiring 24–30 months and an original research work and a higher sub-level where a Doctorate degree could be achieved.

====Funding====

One important aspect is that Public universities at tertiary education level and at university level are tuition-free and open to anyone. Although it is not required to pay any kind of fee at universities, hidden costs of education, like transportation and materials, are often neglected. The lack of a well-developed and widespread scholarship system makes it hard for students from low-income families to enroll in public universities: for each eight students from the 20% upper-income class, there is only one student from the 20% lower-income class. In contrast, post-graduate education requires some form of funding and it is generally not free.

Additionally, financial pressure to freshman college students force them to join the work force before graduation, thus it is very common for young students to have full-time jobs and at the same time study at the University. This is considered beneficial because when the students graduate they already have working experience, though this could also be one of the causes of the high ratio of dropouts.

====College education====
Argentina maintains a network of 39 National universities, financed by the Ministry of Education since 1946. Private and parochial universities are also abundant, numbering 46 among the active institutions and they enroll about a sixth of the collegiate student body (see University reform in Argentina and List of universities in Argentina). Summing up, over 1.5 million students attend institutions of higher learning in Argentina, annually (roughly half the population of college age).

Argentina does not have a standard and common system of examination after high school, thus admission to universities is strictly defined by each university. Moreover, a steady degradation in primary and secondary education created a huge difference between the required level to enter a university and the level achieved by the high school students. Some universities like University of Buenos Aires cope with this issue by creating a 1-year shared program called &quot;CBC&quot; that students need to complete in order to join the university. In April 2024, tens of thousands of people took to the streets in Argentina&#x27;s capital Buenos Aires to demand increased funding for public universities.

====Graduate school====

The doctoral fields of study in Argentina are generally research-oriented doctoral studies, leading mostly to the awarding of the degrees of Doctor of Philosophy, Doctor of Science, Doctor of Medicine, and Doctor of Law, among others. Enrollment in doctorate programs in Argentina is available to candidates having earned a Licentiate, Professorships Engineer&#x27;s degree or Master&#x27;s degree in a related area of study.

Doctoral fields of study mostly pertain to one of five fields of knowledge: Applied Sciences, Basic Sciences, Health Sciences, Human Sciences and Social Sciences. The doctoral studies offered by the Argentine universities include multiple fields and do have national and international validity of the degrees granted.

Academic regulations governing doctorates, and their corresponding fields, in Argentina prescribe that all graduate courses must be accredited by the . This entity stands as a public and decentralized body working under the jurisdiction of the Department of Education, Science and Technology. It administers the process of evaluation and accreditation for all doctorate programs, and is responsible for the institutional evaluation of all such programs at a national level. Graduate programs, including the &quot;Doctorados&quot; (PhDs), set standards per guidelines set forth by the Ministry of Science and Technology, together with the Universities Council.

Additionally, external evaluations of the doctoral programs are carried out by the National Commission for University Evaluation and Accreditation, or private entities created to that effect, together with the participation of academic peers. Argentine institutions of higher education provide further accreditation by international establishments to many of their courses of studies.

<text>The National Civic League is an American nonpartisan, non-profit organization founded in 1894 as the &quot;National Municipal League”; it adopted its new name in 1986. Its mission is to advance civic engagement to create equitable, thriving communities. To upgrade quality and efficiency of government in cities it 
enlists the business and professional classes, and promotes greater involvement in government. It also sought create merit-based systems for selecting public officials. The League envisions a country where the full diversity of community members are actively and meaningfully engaged in local governance, including both decision making and implementation of activities to advance the common good. It also promotes professional management of local government through publication of &quot;model charters&quot; for both city and county governments.

The National Civic League applies civic engagement principles through key programs: community assistance, research and publications, and awards and events. Key issue areas include, but are not limited to: racial equity, environmental sustainability, health equity, youth leadership, education, and housing.

== History ==
The National Civic League was founded as the National Municipal League in 1894 at the &quot;National Conference for Good City Government&quot; in Philadelphia. The convention of politicians, policy-makers, journalists, and educators (including Theodore Roosevelt, Louis Brandeis, Marshall Field, and Frederick Law Olmsted) met to discuss &quot;incompetence, inefficiency, patronage and corruption in local governments.&quot; During the next 120+ years, the National Civic League led major reforms in the way local communities were governed, including the professionalism of city services, the creation of the city manager system, the nonpartisan makeup of many local elected bodies, electoral reform and inclusive civic engagement.

== Events and Programs ==

=== All-America City Award ===

The League is best known for its All-America City Award, celebrating the best in civic innovation since 1949. The Award, bestowed yearly on 10 communities recognizes the work of communities in using inclusive civic engagement to address critical issues and create stronger connections among residents, businesses and nonprofit and government leaders. Once called the &quot;Nobel Prize for constructive citizenship&quot; – it has been awarded to more than 500 communities across the country. The Award is open to all American communities, from major cities, counties and regions to tribes, neighborhoods, towns and villages. In applying, communities reflect on their strengths, weaknesses, challenges and the progress they have made. Each year hundreds of leaders, volunteers, and young people from the finalist communities travel to Denver to present the story of their work and their community to a jury of national experts. The awards conference includes workshops on promising practices.

=== National Conference on Local Governance ===

The National Civic League hosted the 109th National Conference on Local Governance in Denver on June 22, 2018. The Conference focused on inclusive civic engagement, innovation and collaboration as essential elements for making progress on complex issues. The conference featured three issue tracks: Health Equity, Youth and Education, Police-Community Relations.

Confirmed speakers included:

* Jandel Allen-Davis, MD: Kaiser Permanente, Vice President of Government and External Relations

=== Community assistance ===

National Civic League facilitates strategic planning processes, community engagement trainings, and development of local engagement plans and materials—helping local governments and institutions engage and involve residents in ways that lead to tangible outcomes.

The National Civic League consults with communities in a variety of capacities, including:

* Resident-led strategic planning
* Lead local engagement trainings to increase institution&#x27;s internal engagement capacity
* Partner with local communities to develop specific conversation guides, engagement plans and other relevant tools.

* Ray Town, Missouri
* Palm Desert, California
* Lees Summit, Missouri

=== SolSmart ===

The National Civic League&#x27;s focus on civic engagement and environmental sustainability led it to partner with the International City/County Management Association on SolSmart. SolSmart is funded by the U.S. Department of Energy SunShot Initiative and works to make it faster, cheaper and easier to go solar. The League works to support the designation program and to encourage communities to engage residents around solar and sustainability issues.

The SolSmart designation program recognizes communities that have taken steps to make it easier for businesses and residents to go solar. Communities pursuing SolSmart designation are eligible for no-cost technical assistance from a team of national solar experts. National Civic League is working to see 300 communities become designated and advocate for strong community engagement practices in creating and further local community solar goals.

=== Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Health Equity Award ===

Together with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, National Civic League is recognizing, celebrating and rewarding individuals who are making health equity a reality in their community. The RWJF-National Civic League Health Equity Award recognizes individuals who are leveraging engagement to improve health outcomes for those most impacted by health disparities.

The RWJF-National Civic League Health Equity Award recognizes and honors individuals that have successfully implemented a systems change approach within the past two years to improve health outcomes for those most impacted by health disparities. In addition to national recognition at the National Civic League&#x27;s annual All-America City Award and an invitation to participate in Robert Wood Johnson Foundation&#x27;s yearly Health Equity Award annual learning and recognition the winner will receive a $3,000.00 prize.

The 2018 Health Equity Award Winner was Angela Bannerman Ankoma and Sharon Conard Wells, of the Sankofa Initiative in Providence, RI. The Sankofa Community Initiative is a unique urban agricultural project integrating food production and economic development with high-quality, stable affordable housing for the sizable refugee and immigrant population of Providence, Rhode Island.

=== Truth, Racial Healing and Transformation ===
Due to the League&#x27;s focus on civic engagement and racial equity, they have engaged with W.K. Kellogg Foundation&#x27;s Truth, Racial Healing and Transformation (TRHT) initiative. Kellogg&#x27;s TRHT is a comprehensive, national and community-based process to plan for, and bring about transformational and sustainable change, and to address the historic and contemporary effects of racism.

As a partner of the Kellogg Foundation, the National Civic League introduced the TRHT initiative to their All-America City network. The hope is to see communities face and embrace an accurate narrative of all residents&#x27; experiences, pursue healing where divisions exist and experience transformation that comes with addressing inequities. Using the TRHT framework, local communities can address segregated and impoverished neighborhoods, provide equitable opportunities in the economy and ensure fair treatment in public policies as well as civil and criminal law.

TRHT was launched in January 2016 with a year-long design phase, and builds upon and complements the foundation&#x27;s decades-long commitment to advancing racial healing and racial equity throughout the U.S. In June 2017 WKKF awarded 10 grants for nearly $24 million over the next two to five years to help diverse, multi-sector coalitions in 14 places implement the foundation&#x27;s TRHT process and framework.

=== All-America Conversations ===

The National Civic League has worked with communities across the U.S. to hold &quot;All-America Conversations&quot; across dividing lines and identify ways that we can work together. All-America Conversations are designed to help cities and other groups understand residents&#x27; aspirations for the community, the divisions facing the community, and most importantly, the small, specific actions that give people confidence that we can work across dividing lines.

The League created the All-America Conversations Toolkit to provide communities with everything necessary to hold a productive and meaningful conversation. The toolkit walks readers through every step of holding a conversation from:

* Identifying whom to engage and recruiting participants
* Picking a location for your conversation
* Finding and preparing facilitators and note takers
* Knowing what to ask
* Making sense of what you heard

The kit also includes tips for facilitators and note takers, a note-taking tool, ground rules, a sign-in sheet, sample recruitment letter, and many other resources.

== Resources ==

=== Healthy Democracy ===
In October 2024, the Healthy Democracy Map was launched which tracks and maps all the organizations in the United States working to improve democracy as well as showing links between groups that are members of coalitions. It is designed to help people who want to get involved in promoting and protecting democracy.

=== National Civic Review ===

One of the nation&#x27;s oldest and most respected journals of civic affairs, the &quot;National Civic Review&quot; includes case studies, reports, interviews and essays to help communities learn about the latest developments in collaborative problems-solving, civic engagement, local government innovation and democratic governance. Some of the country&#x27;s leading doers and thinkers have contributed articles to this invaluable resource for elected officials, public managers, nonprofit leaders, grassroots activists, and public administration scholars seeking to make America&#x27;s communities more inclusive, participatory, innovative and successful.

=== Promising practices monthly webinars ===

Th League hosts a free monthly webinar series highlighting successful projects around the country with speakers from cities implementing creative strategies for civic engagement. By equipping individuals, institutions and local governmental bodies through this series with ideas, models and insights that can be adopted/adapted to individual communities National Civic League hopes to accelerate the pace of change in communities across the country. Webinar topics include:

* Building community trust using police data
* Community dialogues with On the Table
* Infusing engagement in city planning and visioning
* Infusing equity in city government
* Building equity in parks and recreation
* The power of libraries to foster inclusive civic engagement
* Racial equity and healing

=== Civic Index ===

For 30+ years, the Civic Index has been a way to measure a community&#x27;s civic infrastructure—the formal and informal relationships, networks and capacities communities use to make decisions and solve problems. Building on decades of work in communities, the fourth edition updates the Civic Index with a specific focus on equity and engagement; key components for healthy, thriving communities.

=== Promising Practices Database ===

The database includes summaries of projects that leverage civic engagement from some of the 500 All-America Cities and other communities. Highlighted projects tackle how cities make progress on issues like health, racial equity, youth and education, housing and neighborhood development, sustainability and conservation, community-police relations and more.

=== Model City Charter ===

The Model City Charter serves as a &quot;blueprint&quot; for communities seeking to draft or revise their own home-rule charters. A city charter establishes the framework for how a municipal government operates—its structure, responsibilities, functions, and processes.

Currently in its eighth edition, the National Civic League&#x27;s model calls for a small city council with deliberative powers to make decisions on policy and an appointed city manager to oversee day-to-day administrative matters. The model provides communities with detailed provisions for the conduct of local elections, the administration of budgets and duties of city officials and managers.

The Second Printing (2011), Eighth Edition of the Model City Charter expands diversity and inclusiveness language in the charter preamble to underscore the right of every individual to equal opportunities and establish policies to prohibit discrimination.

=== Community Visioning and Strategic Planning Handbook ===

Based on decades of hands-on experience by National Civic League staff, the &quot;Community Visioning and Strategic Planning Handbook&quot; (2000) aims to help communities convene diverse groups of stakeholders to envision and implement ambitious goals for the future with an inclusive process for planning and decision-making. The handbook also gives communities useful tips on action planning to implement the ambitious goals they have set for themselves.

=== Framework for a Financial Sustainability Index ===

A joint project of the National Civic League, the Government Finance Officers Association, the University of Southern California and the University of San Francisco, the Framework for a Financial Sustainability Index was developed with support from the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy. It provides a new set of tools and techniques to help local government leaders develop systems of governance and decision-making that will make their communities more financially sustainable. It addresses both technical concerns and the psychological and interpersonal aspects of financial governance that have a critical impact on how decisions are made.

=== Guide for Charter Commissions ===

A local charter is the foundation of a local government and functions as the municipal equivalent of a state or federal constitution, setting forth guiding principles for governance. Composed by citizens, a charter specifies the most fundamental relationships between a government and its community. This publication, from 2011, helps communities decide when and how to draft or review their home rule charters. It provides useful information on how to set up a charter review commission, who should serve on it and how to engage community members in the process.

=== Making Public Participation Legal ===

This publication helps city attorneys and other legal advisors make recommendations in an ever-changing context of public participation and democratic governance for which there are few clear laws or legal precedents.

Over the last two decades, a wide range of participatory meeting formats and dynamic online tools have emerged. So why do communities continue conducting public business in such an outdated fashion? One obstacle is the legal framework that governs public participation. At the local, state, and federal levels, these laws can stifle innovation and discourage public officials and employees from reaching out to citizens while failing to achieve the intended goal of greater transparency.

A working group of representatives from the International Municipal Lawyers&#x27; Association, International City/County Management Association, American Bar Association, National League of Cities, National Civic League, Policy Consensus Initiative, National Coalition for Dialogue and Deliberation, and Deliberative Democracy Consortium developed new set of legal tools for public participation, including:

* Model public participation ordinance for local governments
* Model public participation act for state governments
* Local policy options and techniques for strengthening public participation

=== Model Executive Orders for Equity ===

The National Civic League has researched executive orders and ordinances designed to improve equity and inclusiveness. Cities are encouraged to use these models to develop ordinances or other public policies. Model Executive Orders include:

* Diversity training for Board and Commission members
* Creation of chief diversity and inclusion officer
* Establishes public engagement and outreach principles
* Police accountability and racial justice
* Use &quot;Rooney Rule&quot; for city openings
* Use &quot;returning citizen&quot; instead of &quot;ex-offender&quot; in city efforts policy
* Executive order re: pay equity
* Proclamation about National Day of Racial Healing

<doc id="392717" wikidata="Q6971831" url="?curid=392717" title="National Consumers League">
<text>The National Consumers League, founded in 1899, is an American consumer organization. The National Consumers League is a private, nonprofit advocacy group representing consumers on marketplace and workplace issues. The NCL provides government, businesses, and other organizations with the consumer&#x27;s perspective on concerns including child labor, privacy, food safety, and medication information.

The organization was chartered in 1899 by social reformers Jane Addams and Josephine Lowell. Its first general secretary was Florence Kelley. Under Kelley&#x27;s direction, the League&#x27;s early focus was to oppose the harsh, unregulated working conditions many Americans were forced to endure. The founding principles of the NCL are: &quot;That the working conditions we accept for our fellow citizens should be reflected by our purchases, and that consumers should demand safety and reliability from the goods and services they buy.&quot; The league&#x27;s focus continues to be to promote a fair marketplace for workers and consumers.

== Goals ==
The NCL based their organization on the ideals of consumer citizenship, in which it is a citizens duty to advocate for government legislation and use their individual purchasing power to shape a more ethical consumer market. The league used tools such as investigating and educating to promote change. League members would often do thorough investigations in order to study the relevant social problems within their community. They would then create a report and present it to other women and community members often through public events, women&#x27;s talk clubs, or fairs.  In its early years it would award a company or producer with a &quot;White Label&quot; which signified that the league was in approval of their ethicality and it would be recognized by other informed consumers. As they progressed they turned their attention more toward implementing legislation that would provide protection to exploited workers and consumers. In the 1970s they shifted their focus onto the well being of consumers as individuals rather than the focus on working conditions.

==Prominent Members==

=== Florence Kelley===
Florence Kelley was the general secretary of the National Consumers League from its founding in 1899 to her death in 1931.

In founding the National Consumers League in 1899, one of Kelley&#x27;s primary concerns was that the league oppose sweatshop labor. Kelley also worked to establish a work-day limited to eight hours. She worked in support of unionization to further protect workers. In 1907 she participated in the Supreme Court case &quot;Muller v. Oregon&quot;, which sought to overturn limits to the hours female workers could work in non-hazardous professions. Kelley helped to file the Brandeis Brief, which included sociological and medical evidence of the hazards of working long hours, and set the precedent of the Supreme Court&#x27;s recognition of sociological evidence, which was used to great effect later in the case &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;. In addition, Kelley assisted in organizing the National Association For Advancement of Colored People.

=== Esther Peterson===
Esther Peterson&#x27;s involvement in the NCL played an important role in consumer politics and worked within government office as well as the consumer market itself. She was a long time member of the NCL having worked with them as early as 1944 and served as the organizations president from 1974-1976. Peterson worked with the White House as a Special Assistant on Consumer Affairs from 1964-70 during Lyndon B.Johnson&#x27;s presidency. She carried on her position as director of the Office of Consumer Affairs until 1981. Peterson was also a consumer advisor for the supermarket chain, Giant, from 1970-1976. Peterson also worked closely with president Jimmy Carter&#x27;s office to represent consumers in policy making. Peterson dedicated her work to consumer protections like accurate food labeling and advocated for protections regarding class, race, and gender in the workforce and consumer market. Peterson made efforts to improve the market in ways that would benefit both business and consumer.

== Eras of Activism ==

=== New Deal Era===
In the 1920s and 1930&#x27;s the NCL focus was set on lobbying for a gendered-minimum wage. As the U.S. entered the depression they began to lobby for both male and female working conditions and contributed to the passing of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 which is one of their first legislative achievements that set a standard for working conditions and outlawed child labor. In addition they fought for the use of the codes for fair competition through pressuring the National Recovery Administration. The NCL experienced some opposition through the New Deal Era from the National Women&#x27;s Party over differing beliefs of gendered-wages.

==Current leadership==
Sally Greenberg, formerly a senior attorney at Consumers Union (CU), is the chief executive officer of the National Consumers League. Greenberg has worked with members of Congress, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, other federal agencies, the media and consumer safety organizations to shape policy on such issues as product safety, auto safety, and legal and liability reform.

==Programs==
LifeSmarts (www.LifeSmarts.org) is a free program designed to teach teenagers consumer rights and responsibilities as they pertain to health, finance, technology, and the environment.

Fraud.org is a reporting platform through which the National Consumers League collects information about scams, extracts trends from data, and forwards reports to law enforcement.

The Child Labor Coalition (www.StopChildLabor.org) was formed in 1989 to combat child labor and protect teen workers from health and safety hazards. It is co-chaired by the National Consumers League and the American Federation of Teachers.

Script Your Future (www.ScriptYourFuture.org) is a public awareness initiative which teaches patients undergoing long-term prescription therapy the importance of communicating with healthcare professionals and following regimens carefully.

==Criticism==

NCL has faced criticism from progressive groups and labor unions for receiving funding from corporations with a financial stake in the industries where NCL offers policy recommendations. In 1998, Mother Jones argued that NCL &quot;has been saturated in recent years with financial contributions from major U.S. corporations to the point where it can no longer be considered a legitimate independent consumer or public interest group.&quot;

In 2021, union leaders at Communications Workers of America, United Food and Commercial Workers, and United Auto Workers resigned from NCL&#x27;s board over NCL&#x27;s involvement with and financial support from Amazon.

<text>Civitan International, based in Birmingham, Alabama, is an association of community service clubs founded in 1917. The organization aims &quot;to build good citizenship by providing a volunteer organization of clubs dedicated to serving individual and community needs with an emphasis on helping people with developmental disabilities.&quot; The organization includes 40,000 members (referred to as &quot;Civitans&quot;) in almost 1,000 clubs around the world.

==History==
In 1917, a group of Birmingham, Alabama, businessmen were members of the local Rotary club. Many of the men thought that the club focused too much on increasing the business of club members, so they surrendered their club&#x27;s charter. Led by Courtney Shropshire, a local doctor, they formed an independent service club named &quot;Civitan&quot;, derived from the Latin word for &quot;citizenship&quot;.

The United States entered World War I just one month after the club formed. With all attention focused on the war, Civitan remained a local organization. Some of the earliest projects the club undertook supported soldiers, helped European war orphans, and encouraged voter participation through the payment of poll taxes.

Shropshire envisioned an international organization of Civitan clubs dedicated to serving humanity. The process to incorporate was begun, and the International Association of Civitan Clubs was founded in 1920. In the years immediately following World War I, the organization saw rapid growth. By June 1922 at the second international convention, delegates from 115 clubs attended; there were more than 3,300 Civitans throughout the United States. Service clubs like Civitan were extremely popular, since they promoted the spirit of optimism which characterized much of the Roaring Twenties.

The club suffered sharp declines in membership and fundraising during the Great Depression. Some also questioned the necessity of service clubs after the New Deal&#x27;s creation of relief programs. The organization persevered, in part due to cooperation with Rotary, Kiwanis, and Lions clubs. One of the few bright spots in the 1930s was the creation and rapid growth of the first Junior Civitan clubs.

The organization experienced another noticeable drop in membership at the outbreak of World War II, since many of its civic-minded members were among the first to volunteer for military service. Civitans who remained at home organized scrap metal collections, war bond sales, and blood drives. One club in Birmingham, Alabama, held so many successful bond drives that the Army Air Forces named a B-25 and a P-47 in the club&#x27;s honor.

The period after World War II saw another surge in growth. There were 10,000 members by 1947, with membership tripling in size between 1946 and 1956 as Civitan became the sixth largest service club in the United States. By 1960, there were 34,000 active Civitans in 998 clubs. One reason that Civitan expanded so quickly was the flexibility that it allowed to clubs in other countries. Compromises over issues such as the Civitan creed and membership dues allowed the ethnically diverse organization to maintain a strong sense of unity.

By the 1950s, Civitan&#x27;s focus had shifted to helping the developmentally disabled. The Civitan International Foundation, established in 1960, provided financial support for many organizations and programs which benefited developmentally disabled individuals. By 2005, the Civitan International Foundation had provided $13,000,000 in grants to the UAB Civitan International Research Center, the first institution in the United States to focus solely on researching developmental disabilities.

==Charitable work==

===Service projects===
On a local level, individual Civitan clubs undertake various service projects which benefit their local communities. Examples of club projects include maintaining a section of highway (the Tyler Civitan Club was the first to volunteer for the Adopt a Highway program), promoting the creation of hospitals, honoring community leaders, supporting local reading programs, sponsoring children in financial need, purchasing playground equipment for developmentally disabled children, and holding events for developmentally disabled individuals. Clubs operate independently of the international organization or other clubs, leaving them free to participate in whatever service they deem appropriate.

===Focus on developmental disabilities===
While individual clubs are free to pursue their own projects, on an international level Civitan is focused on service to the developmentally disabled. This emphasis was adopted in 1956, with Civitans becoming some of the first to provide special training for teachers of developmentally disabled children.

Civitan continues to focus on assisting those with developmental disabilities. In 1990, the Civitan International Research Center was established on the campus of the University of Alabama at Birmingham with a $20,000,000 grant from the Civitan International Foundation. The Civitan International Research Center was the first institution of its kind in the United States to be focused solely on the research of developmental disabilities. Medical professionals from all over the world also come to the center for training on developmental disabilities.

===Clergy Appreciation Week===
One of Civitan&#x27;s most significant international events is Clergy Appreciation Week, inspired by the story of the Four Chaplains. Begun in 1964, the interfaith event honors the sacrifice of the Four Chaplains by encouraging citizens to thank the clergy who serve their communities. The week usually involves Civitan clubs presenting local clergy with an award or certificate of appreciation. Local mayors often sign a proclamation recognizing Clergy Appreciation Week and encouraging its observance.

===Junior Civitan International===

Junior Civitan International is one of Civitan&#x27;s oldest and most successful programs. Students between the ages of 13 and 18 can join a Junior Civitan club at their school or in their community. Each Junior Civitan club is sponsored by a senior Civitan club and promotes student leadership, character development, and community service.

===YP Civitan===
YP Civitan clubs are designed to provide community service and networking opportunities for young professionals aged 21 to 35. YP Civitan of Greensboro, North Carolina was chartered on June 25, 2013 as the first YP Civitan club.

===World Citizenship Award===
Civitan has awarded its World Citizenship Award to those &quot;who have made significant contributions to mankind.&quot; Recipients of the award include Winston Churchill, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Wernher von Braun, Thor Heyerdahl, and Eunice Kennedy Shriver.

===Candy Box Project===
The Civitan Candy Box Project, one of Civitan&#x27;s oldest and most successful fundraising programs, has raised $50,000,000 since its inception in 1976. Civitan volunteers place boxes of mints at businesses in their community, and patrons donate money to take a piece of candy. Volunteers collect the money, keeping some for club service projects and sending the rest to Civitan International for its charitable projects.

===Claxton fruitcake sales===
Civitan&#x27;s other important fundraiser involves the sale of Claxton Bakery&#x27;s fruitcakes. This partnership began in 1951 when Tampa Civitan club (#0202) member Earl Carver enjoyed the cake so much that he suggested they be sold nationally as a fundraiser. Each year during the holiday season, local Civitan clubs sell millions of pounds of fruitcake. The proceeds from these sales benefit Civitan International&#x27;s work with developmentally disabled persons.

==International activities==
Civitan has clubs in 49 countries and maintains a strong international focus. Because of its long history of service in West Africa, Civitan was invited by the Special Court for Sierra Leone to monitor the war crimes trial of former Liberian President Charles Taylor, held at the International Criminal Court facilities in The Hague.

<text>Peter David Tomarken (December 7, 1942March 13, 2006) was an American television personality primarily known as the host of the game show &quot;Press Your Luck&quot;.

==Early life==
Tomarken was born in Olean, New York, the middle son of Barnett and Pearl Tomarken, who owned Dee&#x27;s Jewelry store in Olean. His family was Jewish, members of Temple B&#x27;nai Israel. They relocated to Beverly Hills, California, in the early 1950s. Peter graduated from Beverly Hills High School in 1960 and from UCLA with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English. Before hosting game shows, he appeared as a contestant on &quot;The Rebus Game&quot; in the 1960s.

After graduating from college, Tomarken married his first wife, Dana, who later served on the Beverly Hills Board of Education from 1985 to 1993. He and Dana had three children: Jason, and fraternal twin sisters, Alexis and Candace.

Tomarken worked on the magazines &quot;Women&#x27;s Wear Daily&quot; and &quot;Business Week&quot; in New York City during the late 1960s before moving back to California to work at various advertising agencies. He made an appearance as a reporter in the 1978 film &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot;, as well as the character Roe in &quot;The Secret Empire&quot; portion of the short lived NBC series &quot;Cliffhangers&quot;.

==Game show career==
He later started his own advertising firm, which put him behind and in front of the camera for many commercials in the late 1970s. His agent then suggested that he should try his hand at game-show hosting, to which Tomarken replied, &quot;Why would I want to do that?&quot; His agent said, &quot;Because you work four days a month and get paid six figures!&quot; After a pair of failed pilots for NBC — &quot;Rodeo Drive&quot; in October 1980 (later picked as a series for Lifetime in 1990, ten years later) and &quot;Duel in the Daytime&quot; in August 1981, both produced by Jay Wolpert — Tomarken got his first network job of another Wolpert production as the host of &quot;Hit Man&quot; for NBC; it lasted just 13 weeks, from January 3 to April 1 of 1983. He also co-anchored a newsmagazine show on Playboy TV called &quot;Playboy on the Scene&quot;. Later that year, Bill Carruthers hired Tomarken to host &quot;Press Your Luck&quot;, a revival of his 1977 game show &quot;Second Chance&quot;, originally hosted by Jim Peck on ABC. Tomarken hosted for three seasons on CBS until its cancellation in 1986. He also co-produced and co-wrote the 1984 NBC special &quot;Those Wonderful TV Game Shows&quot;.

Tomarken then hosted the pilot for &quot;Wordplay&quot; in October 1986 with announcer Rod Roddy, but Tom Kennedy hosted and Charlie O&#x27;Donnell announced the series. Next he hosted the short-lived &quot;Bargain Hunters&quot; for ABC during the summer of 1987. After a year hiatus, he returned to host &quot;Wipeout&quot; (which he also produced), which ran in syndication for one season (1988–89).

Tomarken&#x27;s next project was a pilot for a game-show adaptation of the board game &quot;Monopoly&quot;, which was produced by Merv Griffin and intended to air daily in syndication. Tomarken (and stations) balked at the use of a midget (Patty Maloney) to portray &quot;Rich Uncle Pennybags&quot;, making it impossible to sell. The project was reworked into a summer replacement weekly series for ABC in 1990; Tomarken was replaced by Mike Reilly, a contestant on the pilot, and &quot;Rich Uncle Pennybags&quot; was removed. He hosted several other unsold pilots, including &quot;TKO&quot; for Mark Goodson, &quot;Two Heads Are Better Than One&quot; and &quot;Live Wire&quot; for &quot;PYL&quot; producer Bill Carruthers, &quot;Winds of Fortune&quot;, and &quot;Show Me the World&quot; before the game show market stalled in the early 1990s.

Tomarken then turned to working behind the scenes as a producer and writer. He joined the staff of ABC&#x27;s &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest People&quot; as a segment producer for one season in 1991. He also wrote and produced episodes for &quot;Real Stories of the Highway Patrol&quot;. He returned to the game-show arena in 1994 when he was hired by the fledgling GSN during its conception and early years in the mid-to-late 1990s, and served as host for their evening interactive telephone games, &quot;Prime Games&quot;, which featured &quot;Decades&quot; and &quot;Race for the Numbers&quot;. In 2000, Tomarken took his final hosting position on the Fox Family Channel game show &quot;Paranoia&quot;. He also appeared on several infomercials and acted in small roles, including on the TV show &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;, during that time. He semi-retired from television to work as a real estate agent.

When GSN decided to revive Tomarken&#x27;s most successful series as &quot;Whammy! The All-New Press Your Luck,&quot; Tomarken taped a pilot episode. Todd Newton (who also hosted a pilot) was eventually selected to host the revival, which lasted for two seasons.

In 2003, Tomarken returned to GSN to participate in a documentary based on Michael Larson&#x27;s run on &quot;Press Your Luck&quot; in 1984. He narrated the program, titled &quot;Big Bucks: The Press Your Luck Scandal&quot;, and also gave his own take on the event. As part of the special, he hosted a segment of &quot;Whammy! The All-New Press Your Luck&quot; (making a surprise appearance to host the question round) which reunited the two contestants who competed against Michael Larson with Larson&#x27;s brother, James, for a grudge match; James won, with a total of $6,695. (Michael Larson had died in February 1999 of throat cancer.)

==Death==
Tomarken—a private pilot—and his second wife, Kathleen (born June 12, 1964), were killed when his Beechcraft Bonanza A36, N16JR, crashed a few hundred feet offshore in Santa Monica Bay during climb-out from the Santa Monica Airport in California on the morning of March 13, 2006. The aircraft lost power shortly after takeoff and Tomarken attempted to turn back to the airport before crashing into the bay. The National Transportation Safety Board determined that the Tomarkens&#x27; chances of survival &quot;would have significantly increased&quot; had the plane been equipped with shoulder harnesses in addition to lap seat belts. The cause of the crash was determined to be an improper repair to the aircraft engine that resulted in a complete loss of power.

The Tomarkens were volunteers with Angel Flight West, a nonprofit organization that provides free air transportation to needy medical patients. They were en route to San Diego to pick up a cancer patient who needed transportation to UCLA Medical Center for treatment when their airplane crashed. The charity and the Tomarken children have since established a &quot;Tomarken Heroes&quot; fund in memory of the couple.

Tomarken and his wife are buried in the same plot at Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in Culver City, California.

<text>Luis Federico Leloir (September 6, 1906 – December 2, 1987) was an Argentine physician and biochemist who received the 1970 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his discovery of the metabolic pathways by which carbohydrates are synthesized and converted into energy in the body. Although born in France, Leloir received the majority of his education at the University of Buenos Aires and was director of the private research group Fundación Instituto Campomar until his death in 1987. His research into sugar nucleotides, carbohydrate metabolism, and renal hypertension garnered international attention and led to significant progress in understanding, diagnosing and treating the congenital disease galactosemia. Leloir is buried in La Recoleta Cemetery, Buenos Aires.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Leloir&#x27;s parents, Federico Augusto Rufino and Hortencia Aguirre de Leloir, traveled from Buenos Aires to Paris in the middle of 1906 with the intention of treating Federico&#x27;s illness. However, Federico died in late August, and a week later Luis was born in an old house at 81 Víctor Hugo Road in Paris, a few blocks away from the Arc de Triomphe. After returning to Argentina in 1908, Leloir lived together with his eight siblings on their family&#x27;s extensive property &quot;El Tuyú&quot; that his grandparents had purchased after their immigration from the Basque Country of northern Spain: El Tuyú comprises 400 km2 of sandy land along the coastline from San Clemente del Tuyú to Mar de Ajó which has since become a popular tourist attraction.

During his childhood, the future Nobel Prize winner found himself observing natural phenomena with particular interest; his schoolwork and readings highlighted the connections between the natural sciences and biology. His education was divided between Escuela General San Martín (primary school), Colegio Lacordaire (secondary school), and for a few months at Beaumont College in England. His grades were unspectacular, and his first stint in college ended quickly when he abandoned his architectural studies that he had begun in Paris&#x27; .

It was during the 1920s that Leloir invented &quot;salsa golf&quot; (golf sauce). After being served prawns with the usual sauce during lunch with a group of friends at the Ocean Club in Mar del Plata, Leloir came up with a peculiar combination of ketchup and mayonnaise to spice up his meal. With the financial difficulties that later plagued Leloir&#x27;s laboratories and research, he would joke, &quot;If I had patented that sauce, we&#x27;d have a lot more money for research right now.&quot;

===Career===

====Buenos Aires====

After returning again to Argentina, Leloir obtained his Argentine citizenship and joined the Department of Medicine at the University of Buenos Aires in hopes of receiving his doctorate. However, he got off to a rocky start, requiring four attempts to pass his anatomy exam. He finally received his diploma in 1932 and began his residency in the Hospital de Clínicas and his medical internship in Ramos Mejía hospital. After some initial conflicts with colleagues and complications in his method of treating patients, Leloir decided to dedicate himself to research in the laboratory, claiming that &quot;we could do little for our patients... antibiotics, psychoactive drugs, and all the new therapeutic agents were unknown [at the time].&quot;

In 1933, he met Bernardo Houssay, who pointed Leloir towards investigating in his doctoral thesis the suprarenal glands and carbohydrate metabolism. Houssay happened to be friends with Carlos Bonorino Udaondo, the brother-in-law of Victoria Ocampo, one of Leloir&#x27;s cousins. Following the recommendation of Udaondo, Leloir began working with Houssay, who in 1947 would later win the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. The two would develop a close relationship, collaborating on various projects until Houssay&#x27;s death in 1971; in his lecture after winning the Nobel Prize, Leloir claimed that his &quot;whole research career has been influenced by one person, Prof. Bernardo A. Houssay&quot;.

====Cambridge====
After only two years, Leloir received recognition from the medical department at the University of Buenos Aires for having produced the best doctoral thesis. Feeling that his knowledge in fields such as physics, mathematics, chemistry, and biology is lacking, he continued attending classes at the university as a part-time student. In 1936 he traveled to England to begin advanced studies at the University of Cambridge, under the supervision of another Nobel Prize winner, Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins, who had obtained that distinction in 1929 for his work in physiology and in revealing the critical role of vitamins in maintaining good health. Leloir&#x27;s research in the Biochemical Laboratory of Cambridge centered around enzymes, more specifically the effects of cyanide and pyrophosphate on succinic dehydrogenase; from this moment Leloir began to specialize in researching carbohydrate metabolism.

====United States====
Leloir returned to Buenos Aires in 1937 after his brief stay at Cambridge. 1943 saw Leloir marry; Luis Leloir and Amelia Zuberbuhler (1920-2013) would later have a daughter also named Amelia. However, his return to Argentina was amidst conflict and strife; Houssay had been expelled from the University of Buenos Aires for signing a public petition opposing the Nazi regime in Germany and the military government led by Pedro Pablo Ramírez. Leloir fled to the United States, where he assumed the position of associate professor in the Department of Pharmacology at Washington University in St. Louis, collaborating with Carl Cori and Gerty Cori and thereafter worked with David E. Green at the College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University as a research assistant. Leloir would later credit Green with instilling within him the initiative to establish his own research in Argentina.

====Fundación Instituto Campomar====

In 1945, Leloir ended his exile and returned to Argentina to work under Houssay at the Instituto de Investigaciones Bioquímicas de la Fundación Campomar, which Leloir would direct from its creation in 1947 by businessman and patron Jaime Campomar. Initially, the institute was composed of five rooms, a bathroom, central hall, patio, kitchen, and changing room. During the final years of the 1940s, although lacking financial resources and operating with very low-cost teams, Leloir&#x27;s successful experiments would reveal the chemical origins of sugar synthesis in yeast as well as the oxidation of fatty acids in the liver; together with J. M. Muñoz, he produced an active cell-free system, a first in scientific research. It had initially been assumed that in order to study a cell, scientists could not separate it from its host organism, as oxidation could only occur in intact cells. Along the way, Muñoz and Leloir, unable to procure the costly refrigerated centrifuge needed to separate cell contents, improvised by spinning a tire stuffed with salt and ice.

By 1947 he had formed a team that included 
Ranwel Caputto, Enrico Cabib, Raúl Trucco, Alejandro Paladini, Carlos Cardini and José Luis Reissig, with whom he investigated and discovered why a malfunctioning kidney and angiotensin helped cause hypertension. That same year, his colleague Caputto, in his investigations of the mammary gland, made discoveries regarding carbohydrate storage and its subsequent transformation into a reserve energy form in organisms.

====Sugar nucleotides====

At the beginning of 1948, Leloir and his team identified the sugar nucleotides that were fundamental to the metabolism of carbohydrates, turning the Instituto Campomar into a biochemistry institution well known throughout the world. Immediately thereafter, Leloir received the Argentine Scientific Society Prize, one of the many awards he would receive both in Argentina and internationally. During this time, his team dedicated itself to the study of glycoproteins; Leloir and his colleagues elucidated the primary mechanisms of galactose metabolism

 (now called the Leloir pathway) and determined the cause of galactosemia, a serious genetic disorder that resulted in lactose intolerance.

The following year, he reached an agreement with Rolando García, dean of the Faculty of Exact and Natural Sciences at the University of Buenos Aires, which named Leloir, Carlos Eugenio Cardini and Enrico Cabib as titular professors in the university&#x27;s newly founded Biochemical Institute. The institute would help develop scientific programs in budding Argentine universities as well as attract researchers and scholars from the United States, Japan, England, France, Spain, and other Latin American countries.

Following Jaime Campomar&#x27;s death in 1957, Leloir and his team applied to the National Institutes of Health in the United States desperate for funding, and surprisingly was accepted. In 1958, the institute found a new home in a former all-girls school, a donation from the Argentine government. As Leloir and his research gained greater prominence, further research came from the Argentine Research Council, and the institute would later become associated with the University of Buenos Aires.

===Later years===
In his later years Leloir continued to study glycogen
and other aspects of carbohydrate metabolism.

As his work in the laboratory was coming to an end, Leloir continued his teaching position in the Department of Natural Sciences at the University of Buenos Aires, taking a hiatus only to complete his studies at Cambridge and at the Enzyme Research Laboratory in the United States.

In 1983, Leloir became one of the founding members of the Third World Academy of Sciences, later renamed the TWAS.

====Nobel Prize====
On December 2, 1970, Leloir received the Nobel Prize for Chemistry from the King of Sweden for his discovery of the metabolic pathways in lactose, becoming only the third Argentine to receive the prestigious honor in any field at the time. In his acceptance speech at Stockholm, he borrowed from Winston Churchill&#x27;s famous 1940 speech to the House of Commons and remarked, &quot;never have I received so much for so little&quot;. Leloir and his team reportedly celebrated by drinking champagne from test tubes, a rare departure from the humility and frugality that characterized the atmosphere of Fundación Instituto Campomar under Leloir&#x27;s direction. The $80,000 prize money was spent directly on research, and when asked about the significance of his achievement, Leloir responded:
====Legacy====
Leloir published a short autobiography, entitled &quot;Long Ago and Far Away&quot; in the 1983 &quot;Annual Review of Biochemistry&quot;. The title, Leloir claims, is derived from one of William Henry Hudson&#x27;s novels that depicted the country wildlife and scenery of Leloir&#x27;s childhood.

He died in Buenos Aires on December 2, 1987, of a heart attack soon after returning to his home from the laboratory, and is buried in La Recoleta Cemetery. Mario Bunge, a friend and colleague of Leloir, claims that his lasting legacy was proving that &quot;scientific research on an international level, although precarious, was possible in an underdeveloped country in the middle of political strife&quot; and credits Leloir&#x27;s vigilance and will for his ultimate success. With his research in dire financial straits, Leloir often resorted to homemade gadgets and contraptions to continue his work in the laboratory. In one instance, Leloir reportedly used waterproof cardboard to create makeshift gutters in order to protect his laboratory&#x27;s library from the rain.

Leloir was known for his humility, focus and consistency, described by many as a &quot;true monk in science&quot;. Every morning his wife Amelia would drive him in their Fiat 600 and drop him off at 1719 Julián Alvarez Street, location of Fundación Instituto Campomar, with Leloir wearing the same worn out, gray overalls. He worked sitting on the same straw seat for decades and encouraged colleagues to eat lunch in the laboratory to save time, bringing enough meat stew to share with everyone. Indeed, despite Leloir&#x27;s frugality and extreme dedication to his research, he was a sociable man, claiming not to like working alone.

The Fundación Instituto Campomar has since been renamed Fundación Instituto Leloir, and has grown to become a building with 20 senior researchers, 42 technicians and administrative personnel, 8 post doctorate fellows, and 20 Ph.D. candidates. The institute conducts research in a variety of fields, including Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and multiple sclerosis.

<text>A parent–teacher association/organization (PTA/PTO), parent–teacher–friend association (PTFA), is a formal organization comprising parents, teachers and staff that is intended to facilitate parental participation in a school. A parent–teacher–student association (PTSA) additionally invites students to participate and give input. 

==Australia and New Zealand==
In Australia, the function of PTAs is filled by parents and citizens associations, which are governed by both state and national organizational bodies.

==India==

=== National Policy on Education, 1986 ===
A 1992 &#x27;Program on Action&#x27; for the 1986 National Policy on Education encouraged giving pre-eminence to people&#x27;s involvement, including the association of non-governmental and voluntary efforts.

=== Government schemes ===
Government education schemes such as Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) have advocated for community mobilization and involvement. RMSA dictates that every school should have a PTA, School Development Management Committees (SDMCs) should co-exist with PTAs and leverage their functions, PTAs should conduct meetings at least once a month and present SDMCs with a register of complaints, suggestions, and actions taken. From 2013 to 2014, 37.54 percent of schools in India had a PTA. A 2010 study suggested that 50% of parents in rural areas and 45% in urban areas were aware of the existence of school PTAs.

=== State guidelines===

==== Maharashtra ====
In 1996, the Maharashtra government declared PTAs mandatory for all schools within the state. By 2014, 50% of the schools had a PTA.
State guidelines for PTAs include:
* The parents of every student shall be members of a PTA 
* The PTA does not interfere in the day-to-day administration of the schools
* 50% of PTA members should be women
* The duties of the PTA committee should involve assisting the school in planning and organizing educational programs, monitoring the completion of syllabi, and collecting/presenting information regarding school fees

==== Delhi ====
The government of Delhi made PTAs mandatory in government-aided and private unaided schools. All parents are members of the PTA. Elections should be held every other year, and the PTA should hold a general meeting at least once a year. 78.21% of the schools in Delhi have a PTA.

==== Madhya Pradesh ====
Decentralization of school management was promoted through the installation of PTAs under Sarva Siksha Abhiyan. A 2016 government report stated that 25% of parents were aware of the existence of PTAs, 43% of schools had PTAs, and 39% of PTAs met regularly.

==== Tamil Nadu ====
Tamil Nadu government policy dictates that PTAs should work towards pupil enrolments and attendance as well as assist in enhancing the quality of teaching and learning.

=== PTAs in India ===
A 2010 survey of parents of schoolchildren for the government of India reported that 50% of respondents were aware of PTAs or MTAs (Mother Teacher Associations) and 16% were members.

==United Arab Emirates==
There are plans to organize a PTA in the United Arab Emirates at government schools such as ATHS (Applied Technology High School).

==United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom, parent–teacher associations are common and present in the majority of schools. They are sometimes referred to as home school associations. A 2007 NFER study found that 83% of primary schools in England and Wales and 60% of secondary schools had a &quot;PTA or equivalent&quot;.

In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, PTAs may choose to join Parentkind, which describes itself as &quot;the national charity representing over 13,750 PTAs across England, Wales and Northern Ireland&quot; that seeks &quot;to advance education by encouraging the fullest co-operation between home and school, education authorities, central government and all other interested parties and bodies.&quot; Unlike the USA, the fact that a body is called a PTA does not, in itself, imply membership with any national organization. There is a separate, similar body for Scotland entitled &quot;The Scottish Parent Teacher Council&quot;.

PTAs are generally not involved in the management of schools – that is a matter for the school governing bodies — but in practice, parents who are active in the PTA will tend to engage in the election of parent representatives (parent governors).

==Japan==

===History===

When the modern school system was introduced to Japan during the Meiji period (1868-1912), the cost of establishing and maintaining each school was considered to be mainly borne by town and village expenses, but school budgets were not necessarily abundant. To reduce the financial and labor burden on school management, many voluntary groups such as &quot;Parents Association&quot; and &quot;Mothers&#x27; Association&quot; were formed by parents of students attending school and residents of school districts.

Since the Showa 10&#x27;s (1935), due to the intensification of World War II and the subsequent confusion, group activities had stagnated temporarily. After the end of the war, the activities started again. Activities and movements anticipating the spirit of the later PTA were also attempted across various locations.

In the spring of Showa 21 (1946), the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers announced the &quot;Report of the United States Education Mission to Japan&quot;. In the report, ideas that extend to the PTA were presented. In October Showa 27 (1952), the &quot;Japan Parents and Teachers National Association Formation Conference&quot; was held in Tokyo, and the Japan PTA National Assembly was formed.

==United States==

===PTA===

In the U.S., PTAs are part of the National Parent Teacher Association (National PTA), a non-profit organization based in Alexandria, Virginia.

Most public and private elementary and middle schools have either a PTA (public schools only), a parent–teacher organization (PTO), or an equivalent local organization. These organizations also exist, although less frequently, at high schools and preschools. Every person who joins a local PTA automatically becomes a member of both the state&#x27;s PTA and National PTA. PTA membership – including the number of affiliated units and of individual members – has been declining for several decades.

Today, there are 54 PTA congresses: U.S. states, the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and Europe (military families, through the U.S. Department of Defense). There are 23,000 local organizations recognized by the National PTA in the United States.

====Programs====
* The Reflections Arts in Education Program is a preschool-12th grade national art contest program, often featuring school-wide displays at schools with PTAs. It was founded in 1969 by Mary Lou Anderson.

====Early history====
The National Parent Teacher Association was founded on 17 February 1897, in Washington, D.C., as the National Congress of Mothers by Alice McLellan Birney and Phoebe Apperson Hearst at a meeting of over 2,000 parents, teachers, workers, and legislators. In 1908, the organization changed its name to the National Congress of Mothers and Parent-Teacher Associations..

Alice Birney&#x27;s original vision coupled with Phoebe Hearst&#x27;s (wife of California U.S. Senator George Hearst and mother of publisher William Randolph Hearst) social and financial assistance came together in a burst of synergy that drew 2,000 people from across the country to discuss the issues affecting their children at a three-day event. The National Congress of Mothers quickly fanned out into a grassroots organization at national, state, and local levels.

====History notes====
* In 1908, the organization delegates voted to change its name to the National Congress of Mothers and Parent-Teacher Associations.
* In 1910, charter and board member, Mary Grinnell Mears, moved that &quot;Founders Day be observed every February 17th of the year…&quot;
* In 1925, the association adopted the name the National Congress of Parents and Teachers.
* In 1926, National PTA President Mrs. A. H. Reeve helped set up the National Congress of Colored Parents and Teachers to function in the District of Columbia and states where separate schools for the races were maintained, so that African-American children might have PTA service. On 7 May, the National Congress of Colored Parents and Teachers was formed.
* In 1966, the National PTA registered the terms PTA and Parent-Teacher Association as service marks with the U.S. government.
* In 1970, the National Congress of Parents and Teachers (National PTA) and the National Congress of Colored Parents and Teachers (NCCPT)—founded by Selena Sloan Butler in Atlanta, Ga.—merged to serve all children.

====Advocacy====
The National Congress of Mothers, now known as the National Parent Teacher Association, became a grassroots organization that influenced the local, state, and national levels. Pamphlets written on how to organize &quot;parents&#x27; auxiliaries&quot; in public schools and offer suggestions on formation and meeting were distributed. Collections of loaned materials on child-development and parenting skills were made available to parents. 

The PTA has helped institute countless changes, from the institution of school lunch and inoculation programs to the institution of child labor laws to the promotion of transportation safety, sex education, and tobacco and alcohol education. 

National PTA&#x27;s Annual Public Policy

National PTA&#x27;s annual public policy agenda outlines policy priorities and recommendations for Congress. The priorities are selected based on the timeliness of issue, opportunities for National PTA to provide leadership and expertise to Congress, alignment to National PTA&#x27;s mission and resolution and ability to achieve a meaningful policy change that will produce positive results for children and their families

Examples include:
* Creation of Kindergarten classes
* Child labor laws
* Public health service
* Hot and healthy lunch programs
* Juvenile justice system
* Mandatory immunization 
* Arts in Education
* School Safety
* Special Education
* Education Funding
* Early Childhood Education
* Elementary and Secondary Education
* Child nutrition

====&quot;Our Children&quot; magazine====
The first issue of National Parent Teacher Association&#x27;s &quot;Our Children&quot; magazine – then named &quot;The National Congress of Mothers Magazine&quot; – was printed in November 1906. The purpose of the magazine was to voice the National PTA&#x27;s ambitions and to spread the word of its work and mission.

The magazine&#x27;s title was changed in December 1909 to &quot;Child Welfare&quot; as this was the organization&#x27;s main concern at the time. By the 1930s, the magazine then featured longer articles by leading experts in fields such as education, health and child welfare. Starting in September 1934, the magazine received another makeover where it was published in an oversized format and renamed as the National Parent-Teacher, &quot;to more definitely associate the publication with the parent–teacher movement.&quot; 

More changes came in 1961 with another new name—&quot;The PTA Magazine&quot;—under the editorial leadership of Eva Grant. She led the magazine to its period of widest influence and greatest circulation from 1939 to 1972. During that time, the magazine featured prominent regular contributors such as J. Edgar Hoover and Margaret Mead.

In 1975, The PTA Magazine was replaced by PTA Today, publication that evolved from the former National PTA Bulletin and initially appeared in tabloid form for its first three years. Eventually, &quot;PTA Today&quot; returned to a typical magazine format that was circulated mostly to local PTA units and kept them abreast of National PTA events and programs and provided parenting information.

The final major makeover took place in September 1995 when it was made more colorful and became &quot;Our Children&quot; in line with the founders&#x27; theme of the first convention that &quot;All Children Are Our Children.&quot; In recent years, &quot;Our Children&quot; was published bi-monthly, five times per year and distributed to local and state PTA presidents, state PTA board members, state office personnel and a limited number of paid subscribers.

In fall 2015, &quot;Our Children&quot; moved to a digital online format geared towards parents. It is now a monthly online publication, with one print edition distribution in the spring.

===Parent teacher organization===
A parent teacher organization (PTO) is a formal organization that consists of parents, teachers, and school staff. The organization&#x27;s goals may vary from organization to organization but the core goals include parent volunteerism, teacher and student encouragement, community involvement, and student and family welfare. It is not affiliated with the national Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or Parent-Teacher-Student Association (PTSA). The PTA is a national association of millions of members and thousands of local units that provides leadership training and staff support.

==== Goals and/or mission statement ====

Individual organizations typically establish goals and/or a mission statement. Here is a sample PTO Mission Statement from the New Franklin School PTO:

==== PTO board ====
A PTO generally consists of a board. These members may include a president, vice president, secretary and treasurer. They may also include various specialty positions, such as hospitality, or programs. The board typically governs the PTO by creating and voting on meeting dates, general meeting programs, etc.

==== PTO versus PTA ====
A PTO is not the same as a parent–teacher association (PTA). They are similar in that both promote parent participation, but the PTA takes a more active role in developing programs, advocacy, and training. PTA operates at the school building, district, state and national levels and works on policy to better support children. Local PTA units set their own goals and missions, but they also join together to advocate and partner as a larger group. PTA is membership based and uses money from dues to offer staff support and grants and to develop national programs, such as their Reflections arts in education program and their Standards for Family-School Partnerships implementation guide. A PTO is unaffiliated, local and does not pay dues to a national umbrella organization.

==== Activities ====
PTOs encourage parent, teacher, and community involvement by providing programs that facilitate various activities, including bicycle safety, drug awareness, energy conservation, reading programs, science programs, math programs, and pedestrian safety.

PTO parents get involved by supporting their students, teachers and staff. Parents can volunteer to be room parents to assist with class parties or field trips. They can help set up at a carnival or health fair. They can help teachers and staff by making copies for the class.

Teachers and staff may become involved by helping to plan events that encourage the education of the students. These may include workshops, tutoring or special family nights (math, science, reading).

The students reap the benefits by the involvement and support of all the adults involved in the PTO. The PTO supports the educational goals of the school, thus extending those goals to the students.

<text>Eberhard Arnold (26 July 1883 – 22 November 1935) was a German theologian and Christian writer. He was the founder of the Bruderhof in 1920.

==Early life==
Arnold was born in Königsberg, East Prussia, Germany, the third child of Carl Franklin and Elizabeth (Voight) Arnold. His father was a doctor of theology and philosophy, and his paternal grandfather was a pastor and missionary of the Evangelical State Church of Prussia&#x27;s older Provinces. Eberhard Arnold&#x27;s life as a youth was unconventional. In 1899 at age 16, Arnold experienced an inner change, which he acknowledged as God&#x27;s acceptance and the forgiveness of sins, and felt a calling to &quot;go and witness to my truth.&quot;

After he finished school, Arnold studied education, philosophy, and theology in Breslau, Halle, and Erlangen. He engaged in Christian youth work and in evangelism among the poor through the Salvation Army. While in Halle, he became part of the &quot;German Student Christian Movement&quot;, and its General Secretary. In 1907 he and his wife von Hollander seceded from the Evangelical State Church, or &quot;Evangelische Kirche&quot;. His work with the Salvation Army increased his sympathy for the oppressed classes of people and strengthened his stand for preaching conversion and salvation. Here in Halle, he also met Emmy von Hollander and married her in 1909.

Arnold was a sought-after speaker in early 20th-century Germany. He became troubled by the church&#x27;s connection to the state, and in 1908, at age 25, Arnold was baptized and left the Protestant state church. He began to thoroughly investigate Anabaptist history, which apparently influenced his taking his life and ministry in a radical direction. In 1915 he became editor of &quot;Die Furche&quot; (The Furrow), the periodical of the Student Christian Movement, and editor of the &quot;Das Neue Werk&quot; (New Venture) Publishing House in Schlüchtern, Germany, in 1919.

==Founding the Bruderhof Community==

At age 37, he abandoned middle-class life and the established church, believing it to be complicit in the atrocities of the war. In 1920, he moved with his wife and children to the village of Sannerz in central Germany, and founded the Bruderhof with seven adult members and five children. The community experienced both trouble and growth, but by the mid-1920s the Sannerz farm was too small. In 1926, they bought a farm in the Fulda district and established the Rhön Bruderhof. When Arnold discovered that Hutterite communities still existed in North America, he contacted them and engaged in a long period of correspondence. In 1930 he traveled to America and stayed for about a year, visiting all the communities of Hutterian brethren in the United States and Canada. In December of that year, he was commissioned by them as a missionary to Europe.

In November 1933, the Bruderhof community was raided by the Gestapo, who searched for arms and anti-Nazi literature, and closed the community&#x27;s school. The Bruderhof sent their school children to Switzerland, and began to search for another place to establish their community. When the teacher sent by the government arrived in 1934, he found no children to teach. Property was acquired in the Alps in Liechtenstein, and in March 1934, the &quot;Alm Bruderhof&quot; was founded. Arnold spent the last two years of his life suffering from a leg injury that would lead to his death, while attempting to shepherd his flock to safety. Nevertheless, he remained active in travelling, lecturing and writing until his death in Darmstadt on 22 November 1935.

The Bruderhof is still operational as an intentional community in the United States, Paraguay, the United Kingdom, Germany, Austria, and Australia. Plough, the publishing house he helped to found, is still operated by the Bruderhof, and carries many of his works.

==Family==
Eberhard Arnold married his wife Emmy (1884–1980), née von Hollander, 20 December 1910. She outlived her husband by 45 years, following the Bruderhof to England, Paraguay, and eventually the United States. The couple had five children: Emi-Margret, born 1911, Eberhard-Heinrich, called Hardy, born 1912, Johann Heinrich, called Heini, born 1913, Hans-Hermann, born 1916 and Monika, born 1918.

Its name is a reference to the occurrence of the initial letter H four times in the organization&#x27;s original motto head, heart, hands, and health, which was later incorporated into the fuller pledge officially adopted in 1927. In the United States, the organization is administered by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). 4-H Canada is an independent non-profit organization overseeing the operation of branches throughout Canada. There are 4-H organizations in over 80 countries; the organization and administration varies from country to country.

The goal of 4-H is to develop citizenship, leadership, responsibility and life skills of youth through experiential learning programs and a positive youth development approach. Though typically thought of as an agriculturally focused organization as a result of its history, 4-H today focuses on citizenship, healthy living, science, engineering, and technology programs. Clubs in today&#x27;s 4-H world consist of a wide range of options each allowing for personal growth and career success. The 4-H motto is &quot;To make the best better&quot;, while its slogan is &quot;Learn by doing&quot; (sometimes written as &quot;Learn to do by doing&quot;). As of 2016, the organization had nearly 6 million active participants and more than 25 million alumni.

==History==


The foundations of 4-H began in 1902 with the work of several people in different parts of the United States. The focal point of 4-H has been the idea of practical and hands-on learning, which came from the desire to make public school education more connected to rural life. Early programs incorporated both public and private resources. 4-H was founded with the purpose of instructing rural youth in improved farming and farm-homemaking practices. By the 1970s, it was broadening its goals to cover a full range of youth, including minorities, and a wide range of life experiences.

During this time, researchers at experiment stations of the land-grant universities and USDA saw that adults in the farming community did not readily accept new agricultural discoveries. However, educators found that youth would experiment with these new ideas and then share their experiences and successes with the adults. As a result rural youth programs became a way to introduce new agriculture technology to the adults.

Club work began wherever a public-spirited person did something to give rural children respect for themselves and their ways of life and it is very difficult to credit one sole individual. Instances of work with rural boys and girls can be found all throughout the 19th century. In the spring of 1882, Delaware College announced a statewide corn contest for boys, in which each boy was to plant a quarter of an acre, according to instructions sent out from the college, and cash prizes, certificates, and subscriptions to the &quot;American Agriculturist&quot; were rewarded.

In 1892, in an effort to improve the Kewaunee County Fair, Ransom Asa Moore, the president of the Kewaunee Fair, the Agricultural Society, and Superintendent of the Kewaunee County Schools in Wisconsin, organized a &quot;youth movement&quot;, which he called &quot;Young People&#x27;s Contest Clubs&quot;, in which he solicited the support of 6,000 young farm folks to produce and exhibit fruits, vegetables, and livestock. The fairs were quite successful. In 1904, while working for the University of Wisconsin–Madison and trying to repeat what he had accomplished in Kewaunee County over a decade before but with different intentions, &quot;Daddy&quot; R.A. Moore convinced R.H. Burns, then Superintendent of Schools of Richland County, Wisconsin, to have the Richland County Boys and Girls organize and assist in a corn-project activity to help market and distribute improved seeds to the farmers in the state of Wisconsin (and beyond).

A. B. Graham began one of the youth programs in Clark County, Ohio, in 1902, which is also considered one of the births of the 4-H program in the United States. The first club was called &quot;The Tomato Club&quot; or the &quot;Corn Growing Club&quot;. T.A. &quot;Dad&quot; Erickson of Douglas County, Minnesota, started local agricultural after-school clubs and fairs also in 1902. Jessie Field Shambaugh developed the clover pin with an H on each leaf in 1910, and, by 1912, they were called 4-H clubs. Early 4-H programs in Colorado began with youth instruction offered by college agricultural agents as early as 1910, as part of the outreach mission of the Colorado land grant institutions. 

The national 4-H organization was formed in 1914, when the United States Congress created the Cooperative Extension Service of the USDA by passage of the Smith-Lever Act of 1914, it included within the CES charter the work of various boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; clubs involved with agriculture, home economics and related subjects. The Smith-Lever Act formalized the 4-H programs and clubs that began in the midwestern region of the United States. Although different activities were emphasized for boys and girls, 4-H was one of the first youth organizations to give equal attention to both genders (cf., erstwhile Boys Clubs of America). The first appearance of the term &quot;4-H Club&quot; in a federal document was in &quot;Organization and Results of Boys&#x27; and Girls&#x27; Club Work,&quot; by Oscar Herman Benson (1875–1951) and Gertrude L. Warren, in 1920. By 1924, the clubs were organized as 4-H clubs, and the clover emblem was adopted. Warren expanded the scope of girls&#x27; activities under the program (promoting garment making, room decorating, and hot lunches), and wrote extensive training materials.

The first 4-H camp was held in Randolph County, West Virginia. Originally, these camps were for what was referred to as &quot;Corn Clubs&quot;. Campers slept in corn fields in tents, only to wake up and work almost the entirety of each day. Superintendent of Schools G. C. Adams began a boys&#x27; corn club in Newton County, Georgia, in 1904.

4-H membership hit an all-time high in 1974 as a result of its popular educational program about nutrition, &quot;Mulligan Stew&quot;, shown in schools and on television across the country. Today, 4-H clubs and activities are no longer focused primarily on agricultural activities, instead emphasizing personal growth and preparation for lifelong learning. Participation is greatest during the elementary school years, with enrollment in programs and activities peaking in the 4th grade.

In the southern United States during the mid-1960s 4-H began to broaden its programming to cover life experiences unrelated to agriculture. It merged its segregated African
American and white programs, but full-fledged integration proved elusive. 4-H was successful in removing gender-based restrictions on participation.

The organization is funded by the USDA and by state and local governments. The National 4-H Council&#x27;s programs are also supported by a number of corporations including Google, Verizon, Microsoft, Land O&#x27;Lakes Inc., and Tractor Supply Co.

Past Honorary Chairmen of Council have included U.S. Presidents Calvin Coolidge, Herbert Hoover, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and Bill Clinton.
==Pledge==
The 4-H pledge is:
Otis E. Hall wrote the original pledge of Kansas in 1918. Some California 4-H clubs add either &quot;As a true 4-H member&quot; or &quot;As a loyal 4-H member&quot; at the beginning of the pledge. Minnesota and Maine 4-H clubs add &quot;for my family&quot; to the last line of the pledge. Initially, the pledge ended in &quot;and my country,&quot; but in 1973, &quot;and my world&quot; was added. 
It is a common practice to involve hand motions to accompany these spoken words. While reciting the first line of the pledge, the speaker points to their head with both of their hands. As the speaker recites the second line, they place their right hand over their heart much like during the Pledge of Allegiance. For the third line, the speaker presents their hands, palm side up, before them. For the fourth line, the speaker motions to their body down their sides. For the final line, the speaker usually places their right hand out for the club, left hand for the community, brings them together for the country, and then brings their hands upwards in a circle representing the world.

==Emblem==
The official 4-H emblem is a green four-leaf clover with a white &quot;H&quot; on each leaf standing for &quot;Head&quot;, &quot;Heart&quot;, &quot;Hands&quot;, and &quot;Health&quot;. The stem of the clover always points to the right.

The idea of using the four-leaf clover as an emblem for the 4-H program is credited to Oscar Herman Benson (1875–1951) of Wright County, Iowa. He awarded three-leaf and four-leaf clover pennants and pins for students&#x27; agricultural and domestic science exhibits at school fairs.

The 4-H name and emblem had U.S. federal protection, previous under federal code 18 U.S.C. 707. The federal protection made it a mark unto and of itself with protection that supersedes the limited authorities of both a trademark and a copyright. The Secretary of Agriculture is given responsibility and stewardship for the 4-H name and emblem, at the direct request of the U.S. Congress. These protections placed the 4-H emblem in a unique category of protected emblems, also along with the U.S. Presidential Seal, Red Cross, Smokey Bear, and the Olympic rings. Protections for the 4-H emblem were repealed by Title XI of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021.

==Youth development research==
Through the program&#x27;s tie to land-grant institutions of higher education, 4-H academic staff are responsible for advancing the field of youth development. Professional academic staff are committed to innovation, the creation of new knowledge, and the dissemination of new forms of program practice and research on topics like University of California&#x27;s study of thriving in young people. Youth development research is undertaken in a variety of forms including program evaluation, applied research, and introduction of new programs.

==Volunteers==
Over 540,000 volunteer leaders help to coordinate the 4-H program at the county level. Volunteers plan and conduct 4-H related activities, develop and maintain educational programs, or assist in fundraising. Activities include youth development programs, project groups, camps, conferences, or animal shows. The volunteers&#x27; goal is to help youth achieve greater self-confidence and self-responsibility, learn new skills, and build relationships.

Volunteers are directed by 4-H&#x27;s professional staff.

The National 4-H Hall of Fame honors 4-H volunteers, extension professionals and staff employees, donors and others, according to a criterion of &quot;significant impact on the 4-H program and/or 4-H members through the contribution of time, energy, financial resources, etc.&quot;. The hall of fame was established in 2002 by the National Association of Extension 4-H Youth Development Professionals (NAE4-HYDP).

==Additional programs==

===After-school===

4-H Afterschool helps 4-H and other youth-serving organizations create and improve programs for students in communities across the U.S. 4-H Afterschool is an extension-enhanced program that:
*Offers youth a safe, healthy, caring and enriching environment.
*Engages youth in long-term, structured learning in partnership with adults.
*Addresses the interests of youth and their physical, cognitive, social and emotional needs.
4-H Afterschool programs utilize experimental and cooperative learning activities and provide interaction with competent adults. Results of retrospective pre/post-surveys indicate that children enrolled in the program showed life skill gain over time, and that gains on specific life skills differed as a function of age, gender, and ethnicity.

The life skills gained through 4-H Afterschool give children the tools they need for perceiving and responding to diverse life situations and achieving their personal goals. Participation in these quality programs which use experiential and cooperative learning have all been found to contribute to children&#x27;s social development and academic success.

===Camping===

Each state runs its own camping program. The world&#x27;s first 4-H camp was held in July 1915 on the Crouch family farm along the Tygart Valley River near Elkwater, West Virginia. The youth in attendance named the location Camp Good Luck.

The first &quot;state&quot; 4-H camp was held at Jackson&#x27;s Mill outside of Weston, West Virginia. 4-H camping programs in most states are run through land-grant institutions, such as Washington State University, which runs the Washington program, and Pennsylvania State University runs Pennsylvania&#x27;s. The Georgia 4-H camping program has the largest youth center in the world, called Rock Eagle.

On July 8, 2015, to mark the centennial of 4-H camping, youth from Randolph County, West Virginia traveled back to the original Camp Good Luck site for a special commemoration and campfire program. A stone marker honoring Camp Good Luck had been placed adjacent to US 219 near the site, but was moved to a spot off of Bell Crouch Rd. for greater safety and accessibility through the efforts of Randolph County 4-H volunteers and the West Virginia Division of Highways.

===Five- to eight-year-old youth===
Some states offer programs for youth in grades K-2 called Cloverbuds, Cloverkids, 4-H Adventurers, Primary Members, or Mini 4-H. Some states prohibit this age group from competition due to research in child development demonstrating that competition is unhealthy for youth ages five to eight.

===Collegiate===
Many colleges and universities have collegiate 4-H clubs. Usually members are students who are 4-H alumni and want to continue a connection to 4-H, but any interested students are welcome. Clubs provide service and support to their local and state 4-H programs, such as serving as judges and conducting training workshops. They are also a service and social group for campus students. The first collegiate 4-H club started in 1916 on the Oklahoma State University - Stillwater campus.

===All Stars===
Finding its roots in the early 4-H movement in West Virginia, the 4-H All-Star program strives to recognize and challenge 4-H members and volunteers. State 4-H Club Leader William H. &quot;Teepi&quot; Kendrick sought to develop youth to &quot;be yourself at your best&quot; and to &quot;make the best better&quot; through a fourfold personal development pattern involving the head, hands, heart, and, at that time, hustle. It was with this philosophy, in collaboration with others, that the 4-H emblem was born. In an attempt to harbor further individual growth, Kendrick recognized excellence with pins bearing one, two, three, and four H&#x27;s. Recognition for outstanding participation was rewarded from 1917 to 1921 with trips to a Prize Winner&#x27;s Course at West Virginia University. Members who demonstrated outstanding qualities at these courses were awarded five-pointed red pins with five H&#x27;s, with this additional &quot;H&quot; to symbolize honor. The recipients of these pins were referred to by Kendrick as &quot;All Stars&quot;. It was following the pin consecration ceremony in 1919 that the official West Virginia 4-H All Stars organization was chartered, becoming the Alpha chapter of the nationwide 4-H honorary.

The symbol of the All Stars is a red star enveloping a gemstone chip over the 4-H emblem. Each point of the star represents a pillar of character: &quot;Beauty, Fortitude, Service, Truth, and Love&quot;.

Many states have All Star programs, although All Star programs vary from state to state. Selection as a 4-H All Star is a recognition of achievement. In California for example, it is the highest achievement award at the county level and is a position awarded annually. Similarly, the capstone award in Texas 4-H is the Gold Star Award, which is given to Seniors who have shown outstanding leadership and proficiency in their project areas.

In Virginia, on the other hand, All-Stars are not simply those who have achieved an All-Star award, but are those who have gained membership into the Virginia All-Stars organization. After reaching the age of 15, 4-H members are eligible to apply for membership into the All-Stars organization, which promotes the continuation of 4-H principles.

==Conferences==
Many conferences are held at various levels of the 4-H program for youth and adults. The National 4-H Conference, which was held at the National 4-H Youth Conference Center in Chevy Chase, Maryland, until it was sold in 2021, is the USDA Secretary&#x27;s premier youth development opportunity to engage youth in developing recommendations for the 4-H Youth Development Program. The Conference still meets annually in and around Washington, DC. The 2024 National 4-H Conference will be held in Arlington, VA. 

The National 4-H Congress is an annual educational conference that brings together 4-H delegates between the ages of 14 and 19 from across America to share cultural experiences and discuss important issues facing youth. This five-day event is typically held during the weekend of Thanksgiving and has been hosted in Atlanta, since 1998. Throughout the conference, 4-H delegates attend numerous workshops, participate in community service activities, and listen to speakers in an effort to develop compassion and increase social awareness.

Citizenship Washington Focus is a week-long conference offered for high school-aged students. At the conference, students have the opportunity to learn how to be citizen leaders in their communities. Throughout the week in Washington, D.C., participants visit monuments, meet with members of Congress, and develop communication, leadership and citizenship skills.

The following national conferences are held yearly, and are focused on specific activities inside of 4-H:

* National 4-H Dairy Conference
* Eastern National 4-H Horse Roundup
* Western National 4-H Horse Roundup
* National 4-H Shooting Sports Invitational Match
*National 4-H True Leaders in Equity Institute
*National 4-H Youth Summit Series
**STEM Summit
**Healthy Living Summit
**Agri-science Summit
Other conferences are held by regional and state entities for youth, for volunteer development, or for professional development for staff.

==Use of Native American terminology==
For many years, use of Native American names and certain themed activities was part of the summer camping programs of some eastern states. However, the practice was considered to be offensive and protests were raised. A complaint to the U.S. Department of Agriculture&#x27;s Office of Civil Rights in 2002 and an ensuing investigation that threatened to cut off funds to the state&#x27;s program prompted the West Virginia University Extension Service to abandon offensive and stereotypic practices such as face-painting, and use of imagery not a part of the culture of local Native people, such as tepees and totem poles. They also eliminated the practice of having children wear feather headdresses, and stopped having campers engage in &quot;stereotypical motions and dances,&quot; including chanting &quot;Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!&quot;. However, the state program deemed the dividing of campers into groups, called &quot;tribes&quot; named after actual Indian Nations, to be respectful and acceptable. In the same year, the Virginia Extension Service removed all references to symbols or camp &quot;traditions&quot; related to Native Americans, including the decades-long practice of dividing campers into &quot;tribes&quot; using names of nations considered native to Virginia, replacing the group names with animal names.

==Alumni==

Some 4-H alumni credit the program with helping them in later life.

In 2021, Minnesota-based photographer R. J. Kern, along with writer Alison Nordström, published &quot;The Unchosen Ones: Portraits of an American Pastoral&quot;. The book highlights portraits of dozens of youth, who spent a year raising and training their animal and then entered into a 4-H livestock competition, but were unsuccessful in winning the top award in their competitions, then revisits the same youth four years later, and asked the young subjects what they had carried forward from their previous experience.

<text>AS-101 (also designated SA-6) was the sixth flight of the Saturn I launch vehicle, which carried the first boilerplate Apollo spacecraft into low Earth orbit. The test took place on May 28, 1964, lasting for four orbits (about six hours). The spacecraft and its upper stage completed a total of 54 orbits before reentering the atmosphere and crashing in the Pacific Ocean on June 1, 1964.

The flight experienced a single anomaly: one of the eight first-stage Saturn I engines shut down early, but the guidance system compensated by burning the remaining seven engines longer. AS-101 was followed by four more flights to verify the launch aerodynamics of the Apollo command and service module (CSM) and its launch escape system (LES) tower.

==Boilerplate Apollo ==
The first five launches of the Saturn I had carried Jupiter nosecones, a proven design which allowed engineers to focus on development of the rocket. To verify the launch aerodynamics of the CSM, AS-101 carried BP-13, a boilerplate spacecraft that weighed and duplicated the size and shape of the CSM, and a dummy LES tower. A flight-weight command module (CM) weighed around . The boilerplate spacecraft was instrumented with 116 sensors reading strain, pressure, temperature, heat flux, and acceleration.

== Flight ==

It took three attempts to launch the rocket from Cape Kennedy Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 37B. The first attempt was scrubbed after the liquid oxygen damaged a wire mesh screen during a test, causing fuel contamination. The second attempt was scrubbed after the rocket&#x27;s guidance system overheated due to failure of an air conditioning compressor.

The vehicle finally lifted off on May 28, 1964. There had been several delays during the countdown as liquid oxygen vapors obscured an optical window in the SA-6&#x27;s instrument unit, so that a ground-based theodolite could not see it. This theodolite was required by the countdown computer in order for launch to proceed. Engineers deemed it non-critical and reprogrammed the computer, allowing the launch to proceed.

The ascent was normal up to 116.9 seconds after liftoff, at which point engine number eight shut off early. This was not planned, as it had been on SA-4 as a test, but the rocket compensated perfectly by burning the remaining fuel in the other seven engines for 2.7 seconds longer than planned. The first stage separated and the second stage ignited. Ten seconds later, the launch escape system was jettisoned as planned. Also jettisoned from the first stage were eight film cameras that observed separation of the stages.

The second stage cut off at 624.5 seconds after launch (1.26 seconds earlier than predicted), with the stage and boilerplate spacecraft in a by orbit. It continued to transmit data for four orbits, after which the batteries failed. The vehicle made a total of 54 orbits, re-entering the atmosphere east of Kanton Island in the Pacific Ocean on June 1.

== Engine failure cause ==
Engineers were quick to find the cause of the failure of engine number eight. The teeth on one of the gears in the turbopump were stripped off. This did not cause any delays in the next launches as engineers had already decided that the gear design was inferior and were planning to change it for the next launch. This was the only problem encountered with an H-1 engine during a flight.

<text>Microcar is a term often used for the smallest size of cars, with three or four wheels and often an engine smaller than . Specific types of microcars include bubble cars, cycle cars, invacar, quadricycles and voiturettes. Microcars are often covered by separate regulations to normal cars, having relaxed requirements for registration and licensing.

== Predecessors ==

Voiturette is a term used by some small cars and tricycles manufactured from 1895 to 1910.

Cyclecars are a type of small, lightweight and inexpensive car manufactured mainly between 1910 and the late 1920s.
== Europe 1940–1970: Microcars ==
The first cars to be described as microcars (earlier equivalents were called voiturettes or cyclecars) were built in the United Kingdom and Germany following World War II, and remained popular until the 1960s. They were originally called minicars, but later became known as microcars.

France also produced large numbers of similar tiny vehicles called voiturettes, but they were rarely sold abroad.

=== Characteristics ===
Microcars have three or four wheels, although most were three-wheelers which, in many countries, meant that they qualified for lower taxes and were licensed as motorcycles. Another common characteristic is an engine displacement of less than , although several cars with engines up to have also been classified as microcars. Often, the engine was originally designed for a motorcycle.

=== History ===
Microcars originated in the years following World War II, when motorcycles were commonly used. To provide better weather protection, three-wheeled microcars began increasing in popularity in the United Kingdom, where they could be driven using only a motorcycle licence. One of the first microcars was the 1949 Bond Minicar.

Microcars also became popular in Europe. A demand for cheap personal motorised transport emerged, and their greater fuel efficiency meant that microcars became even more significant when fuel prices rose, partly due to the 1956 Suez Crisis.

The microcar boom lasted until the late 1950s, when larger cars regained popularity. The 1959 introduction of the Mini, which provided greater size and performance at an affordable price, contributed to the decline in popularity of microcars. Production of microcars had largely ceased by the end of the 1960s, due to competition from the Mini, Citroën 2CV, Fiat 500 and Renault 4.

=== Bubble cars ===

Several microcars of the 1950s and 1960s were nicknamed &quot;bubble cars&quot;. This was due to the aircraft-style bubble canopies of vehicles such as the Messerschmitt KR175, Messerschmitt KR200 and the FMR Tg500. Other microcars, such as the Isetta, also had a bubble-like appearance.

German manufacturers of bubble cars included former military aircraft manufacturers Messerschmitt and Heinkel. BMW manufactured the Italian Iso Rivolta Isetta under licence, using an engine based on one from one of their own motorcycles.

The United Kingdom had licence-built right-hand-drive versions of the Heinkel Kabine and the Isetta. The British version of the Isetta was built with only one rear wheel, instead of the narrow-tracked pair of wheels in the normal Isetta design, in order to take advantage of the three-wheel vehicle laws in the United Kingdom. There were also indigenous British three-wheeled microcars, including the Peel Trident.

Examples include the Citroën Prototype C, FMR Tg500, Fuldamobil, Heinkel Kabine, Isetta, Messerschmitt KR175, Messerschmitt KR200, Peel P50, Peel Trident, SMZ S-1L, Trojan 200, and Kleinschnittger F125.

== Worldwide 1990–present ==
Recent microcars include the 2001 Aixam 5xx series, Renault Twizy, Citroën Ami, and XEV Yoyo.

Electric-powered microcars which have reached production include the 1987 CityEl, the 1990 Automobiles ERAD Spacia, the 1999 Corbin Sparrow, the 2001 REVAi, the 2005 Commuter Cars Tango, the 2009 Tazzari Zero and the resurrected Peel P50 of 2011 (the original model of 1962 - 65 being petrol powered).

The Smart Fortwo is often called a microcar in the United States; although it requires a regular licence to drive.

=== Quadricycle legislation ===
The European Union introduced the quadricycle category in 1992. In several European countries since then, microcars are classified by governments separately from normal cars, sometimes using the same regulations as motorcycles or mopeds. Therefore, compared with normal cars, microcars often have relaxed requirements for registration and licensing, and can be subject to lower taxes and insurance costs.

== Junior cars==

Junior cars are motorized cars for children, typically copies of real designs. Originally powered either by electric engines or small internal combustion engines, electric engines currently dominate. From the 1926 Baby Bugatti until today, junior cars are often as expensive as a real car and are built to a higher standard than a ride-in toy car. As with the Bugatti, these are frequently sold directly by real car manufacturers such as Porsche and Ferrari. In the 1990s Aston Martin built a half-scale junior car version of the then-new Aston Martin Virage Volante, with a handmade aluminium body, leather interior, and 160-cc Honda engine. It cost as much as a brand new Mercedes-Benz 190E.

Manufacturers include Pocket Classics, the Little Car Company, Eshelman, and Hackney.

== Microcar trucks ==
There are also a variety of microcar trucks, usually of the &quot;forward control&quot; or van style to provide more cargo room. These might be used for local deliveries on narrow streets that are unsuited to larger vehicles. The Piaggio Ape is a three-wheeled example. The Honda Acty is a four-wheeled example.

<text>Zhang Qun (May 9, 1889 – December 14, 1990) was a Chinese politician and premier of the Republic of China and a prominent member of the Kuomintang. He served as secretary general to the President of the Republic from 1954 to 1972 and senior advisor to Presidents Chiang Kai-shek, Yen Chia-kan, Chiang Ching-kuo, and Lee Teng-hui. Under the influence of his wife, Ma Yu-ying, he became a Christian in the 1930s.

==Education and early career==
Born in the Huayang County (now part of Shuangliu County), Sichuan province, Chang was admitted in 1906 to the Baoding Military Academy, just southwest of Beijing. The next year, he was selected to go to Japan to study at the Tokyo Shimbu Gakko, a preparatory military school, where he specialized in artillery. Together with his classmate, Chiang Kai-shek, he joined the Tongmenghui the same year. After completing their preparatory studies, they both served in the Takada regiment of the Imperial Japanese Army’s 13th Field Artillery Brigade, stationed in Niigata Prefecture before returning to China to serve under Sun Yat-sen in the Xinhai Revolution which would overthrow the Qing monarchy in 1911. During this period, a lifelong friendship between the two men and Huang Fu was formed and the three became sworn, or blood, brothers. Chang married Ma Yu-ying (馬育英) in 1913; because their first child was born in 1917, he later joked to have practiced family planning long before it became popular.

When Yuan Shikai attempted to restore the monarchy, Chang fled to Japan, finished his military training at the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in 1915, and then went to the Netherlands East Indies, where he taught in an overseas Chinese school. Returning to China to participate in Yuan&#x27;s overthrow in the National Protection War, he served as adjutant-general to Cen Chunxuan, president of the southern provinces, which repudiated Yuan&#x27;s regime. With the restoration of the Republic, Chang held several posts. Becoming a major general of the National Revolutionary Army at age 28, he later became a member of the Kuomintang&#x27;s Central Executive Committee, mayor of Shanghai and president of Tongji University, governor of Hubei province and foreign minister. In the KMT, he led the Political Science Clique (政學系), which included military men such as Huang Fu and Xiong Shihui (熊式輝), intellectuals, such as Yang Yongtai and Wang Chonghui, and bankers and industrialists, including Wu Dingchang (吳鼎昌) and Chang Kia-ngau. During World War II, he served as secretary general of the National Security Council and governor of Sichuan province.

==Post-war career==

In 1946, Chang, representing the national government, was a member of the Committee of Three (also known as the Marshall Mission) along with General George C. Marshall, then head of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Chinese Communist Party representative Zhou Enlai, which had been established in Nanjing in January 1946 to effect a Kuomintang-Communist truce and head off civil war. The Marshall Mission helped to bring about a temporary ceasefire, but its plans for a political-military settlement did not succeed.

In 1947, Chang headed the first coalition government as president of the Executive Yuan, a position also known as premier of the Republic of China. His platform was to prepare China for constitutional government, land reform, and price control. Despite his long ties with Chiang Kai-shek, he could not bring about the political reforms that he favored. After the transfer of the capital from Nanjing to Taipei, he became chief of staff and secretary general to the president in 1954. Among his duties were planning the government&#x27;s foreign policy and representing the president in Japan, Africa and Europe, including the Second Vatican Council in 1965. In 1972, he played a large role in the difficult negotiations regarding Japan&#x27;s switch of diplomatic recognition to the People&#x27;s Republic of China. His last official position was chairman of the Presidium of the Kuomintang&#x27;s Central Advisory Committee.

==Personal life==
A member of the board of the National Palace Museum, Chang was a renowned calligrapher, keen art collector, friend of great artists such as Chang Dai-chien, Huang Jun-bi and Ran In-ting, and recipient of honorary doctorates from several universities, including the University of Illinois, Seoul National University, St. John&#x27;s University (New York), Sungkyunkwan University and Soochow University (Taiwan). He died at the age of , of heart and kidney failure, at Veterans General Hospital in Taipei, on December 14, 1990. From 20 January 1990, when former Japanese Prime Minister Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni died until his own death, Chang was the world&#x27;s oldest living former head of government.

Chang&#x27;s wife, Ma Yu-ying (馬育英; pinyin: Ma Yuying), was a devout Christian and died in 1974. His daughter, Yalan Chang Lew (劉張亞蘭; pinyin: Liu Zhang Yalan), died on July 14, 2014, at age 97 in Seattle, US; she was the widow of Ambassador Yu-tang Daniel Lew (劉毓棠; pinyin: Liu Yutang), who had died in 2005 at age 92 in Taipei. His son, Dr. Philip Chi-cheng Chang (張繼正; pinyin: Zhang Jizheng), who died on October 24, 2015, at age 96 in Taipei, was former communications minister 1969–72, chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development 1973–76, finance minister 1978–81 and governor of the Central Bank of China 1984–89. His second son, Rev. Dr. , who died on October 26, 2020, at age 92 in California, was vice president of the Truth Theological Seminary and pastor emeritus of the Mandarin Baptist Church of Pasadena, California.

<doc id="392782" wikidata="Q4743741" url="?curid=392782" title="American Farm Bureau Federation">
<text>The American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF), more informally called the American Farm Bureau (AFB) or simply the Farm Bureau, is a United States–based 501(c)(5) tax-exempt agricultural organization and lobbying group. Headquartered in Washington, D.C., the Farm Bureau has affiliates in all 50 states and Puerto Rico. Each affiliate is a (state or county) Farm Bureau, and the parent organization is also often called simply the Farm Bureau.

Founded in 1919, the AFBF represents the 2 million farms in the United States, and is among the agriculture industry&#x27;s largest lobby groups. Some observers contend that its federal lobbying efforts, which began in the 1930s, helped drive the subsequent three-decade shift to larger farms.

In 2022, the AFBF spent $2,120,000 on lobbying, including for policies benefitting the for-profit activities of state farm bureaus, such as federal subsidies for the crop insurance sold by affiliate companies. Until 2019, it denied that climate change was real.

AFBF itself does not sell insurance, but all but a handful of its non-profit state affiliates have affiliated for-profit insurance companies. Most of AFBF&#x27;s revenue comes from dues paid by its nearly 5.9 million members, most of whom are not farmers but insurance customers who pay the dues as a condition of their policies.

Every year, the organization holds an annual convention and adopts new policies to guide its work. The convention is attended by farmer and rancher delegates from across the United States.

== History ==

The Farm Bureau movement started in 1911 when John Barron, a farmer who graduated from Cornell University, worked as an extension agent in Broome County, New York. He served as a Farm Bureau representative for farmers with the Chamber of Commerce of Binghamton, New York. The effort was financed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Lackawanna Railroad. The Broome County Farm Bureau was soon separated from the Chamber of Commerce. Other farm bureaus later formed in counties across the U.S., as listed with dates at &quot;List of Farm Bureaus&quot;.

In 1914, with the passage of the Smith–Lever Act of 1914, Congress agreed to share with the states the cost of programs for providing &quot;county agents&quot;, who supplied information to farmers on improved methods of animal husbandry and crop production developed by agricultural colleges and experiment stations, which has evolved into the modern-day Cooperative Extension Service.

In 1915, farmers meeting in Saline County, Missouri, formed the first statewide Farm Bureau.

=== 1919–1929 ===
In 1919, a group of farmers from 30 states gathered in Chicago. They founded the American Farm Bureau Federation with the goal of &quot;speaking for themselves through their own national organization&quot;. But they also sought to forestall populist organization of small farmers. &quot;The inception of this national farm bureau association is taking place at a most opportune time,&quot; Harvey J. Sconce, president of the Illinois Agricultural Association, said at the meeting. &quot;The United States is at present experiencing the greatest period of industrial unrest in its entire history. It is now just one year since the signing of the armistice. During this interval more than 3,000 strikes have been inaugurated in this country. Is it any wonder that production has dwindled and cost of living has so greatly increased? It is our duty in creating this organization to avoid any policy that will align organized farmers with the radicals of other organizations. The policy should be thoroughly American in every respect – a constructive organization instead of a destructive organization.&quot; Wrote Brian Campbell, now a professor at Berry College: &quot;Farm Bureau began as a counter-move to various farm organizations that represented small farmers.&quot;

The initial organization papers said:

The initial local and state farm bureaus (1910s–1940s) had a social and educational function furthering the extension service efforts, and they also pursued the functions of pooled negotiating power for purchasing of supplies such as seed and equipment (comparable in that respect to farm co-operatives, but with potential for larger/wider unification). The bureaus also pooled capability to provide fire insurance and vehicle insurance for their farms, via both negotiating power (in group purchasing of insurance) and self-insuring capability (in forming new insurance companies of their own); they were comparable in that respect to mutual insurance companies (and indeed founded various such companies). In all of these functions, local and state farm bureaus thus became an analogue of a farmers&#x27; union or a trade association for farmers in the United States; the National Farmers Union was the other such effort, outside of small co-ops. More precisely, the local and state farm bureaus formed a network of such unions or associations with a national parent organization. They were thus somewhat analogous in that respect to a federation of trade unions (such as the AFL–CIO) – but with individual family farms being self-employed, the parallel with trade associations is the more relevant analogy.

=== 1930–1939 ===
In the 1930s, the American Farm Bureau Federation developed a lobbying presence in Washington, D.C., where it pushed for changes in New Deal programs to favor large farms with many employees over family farms. Meanwhile, the Minnesota Farmer–Labor Party (FLP), a political party which represented small operators and favored radical programs, was left without power by the New Deal policies, and so in the 1940s the FLP and similar groups in the upper Midwest died or were merged into the Democratic or Republican parties.

Along with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Farm Bureau and other &quot;advocates of a mechanized, highly commercialized agriculture helped initiate an abrupt two-decade shift to machines and wage labor.&quot; By World War II, the organization was &quot;the most influential representative of large farmers.&quot;

In a study of the organization&#x27;s New Deal period during the 1930s, Christian McFayden Cambell concluded that it was &quot;...largely controlled from the top. Its leadership is self-perpetuating, and its policy, although nursed through an elaborate procedural labyrinth, is rarely permitted to wander very far afield. &#x27;The Farm Bureau&#x27;s cherished belief that its policy was made at the grass roots and adopted by democratic process turned out to be partly illusion,&#x27; concluded Christiana McFayden Cambell in her study of the organization&#x27;s New Deal period. There appears to be no reason to change that assessment today,&quot; Samuel R. Berger wrote in &quot;Dollar Harvest&quot; (2nd ed., 1978)&quot;.&quot;

=== Since 2000 ===
By the 21st century, the AFBF, through its state and local affiliates, was entwined financially with large agribusiness corporations. &quot;In recent years, its insurance affiliates have bought stock in companies like Cargill, ConAgra, Dow Chemical, DuPont, Tyson and Archer Daniels Midland, all major food industry players. The Southern Farm Bureau Annuity Insurance Co. [co-owned by 10 state Farm Bureaus] once owned more than 18,000 shares of Premium Standard stock,&quot; &quot;The Nation&quot; wrote in 2012.

Bob Stallman, a Texan, served as AFBF president from 2001 to 2016, earning a salary of $832,216 in his final year. Duval took over in January 2017, earning a salary of $648,111 in his first year.

In 2020, around 500 dairy farmers and haulers received letters demanding repayment (for up to $50,000) for milk shipped to Dean Foods, just before the company filed for bankruptcy (it was subsequently acquired by Dairy Farmers of America). AFBF, which called the demands a &quot;predatory shakedown&quot;, was one of several groups that provided legal assistance to the farmers and haulers.

In 2023, AFBF announced several memorandums of understanding with equipment manufacturers, establishing repair agreements that make manufacturers&#x27; tools, software, and manuals available to farmers under &quot;fair and reasonable&quot; terms so farmers can make needed repairs. Under these, AFBF also agrees not to lobby on right to repair legislation, and to “encourage state-level Farm Bureaus to recognize the commitments made in the MOU and refrain from promoting “right to repair” legislation at the state or federal level”. In January, MOUs were signed with John Deere and in March, with CNH Industrial, Case IH and New Holland Agriculture.

== Lobbying ==
A 2012 investigation by &quot;The Nation&quot; detailed the large-scale federal and state political operations of the Farm Bureau, and alleged the Bureau recruited political candidates (mostly Republicans) to affect legislative elections and appointments to state committees.

As of 2012, the organization retains 22 registered lobbyists. From 2002 to 2012, the Farm Bureau spent $16 million, which was 45% of the total amount spent by the 10 largest agribusiness interests in the U.S.

The Farm Bureau supported the Fighting Hunger Incentive Act of 2014 (H.R. 4719; 113th Congress), a bill that would amend the federal tax laws to permanently extend and expand certain expired provisions that provided a bigger tax deduction for businesses that donated food to charitable organizations. The Farm Bureau argued that without the tax write-off, &quot;it is cheaper in most cases for these types of businesses to throw their food away than it is to donate the food&quot;.

The Farm Bureau has lobbied for increases in federal subsidies for crop insurance, which &quot;is a small, but significant piece of Farm Bureau insurance companies’ portfolio. In 2011, they collected over $300 million in crop insurance premiums&quot;, &quot;The Nation&quot; wrote in 2012.

===Climate change===
The Farm Bureau has long opposed regulation or taxation of greenhouse gases and climate policy, justifying its actions by denying the scientific consensus on climate change. &quot;For decades, the Farm Bureau has derailed climate action, deploying its political apparatus and 6 million members in a forceful alliance with conservative groups and the fossil fuel industry,&quot; &quot;Inside Climate News&quot; wrote in 2018.

In 2003, Farm Bureau economists joined the Heartland and Hudson Institutes in publishing a paper that &quot;called state or federal regulation of greenhouse gases &#x27;unnecessary, enormously expensive, and particularly injurious to the agricultural community.

In 2010, the Farm Bureau&#x27;s official position was that &quot;there is no generally agreed upon scientific assessment of the exact impact or extent of carbon emissions from human activities, their impact on past decades of warming or how they will affect future climate changes&quot;. The climate change session at the Farm Bureau&#x27;s national meeting that year was entitled &quot;Global Warming: A Red Hot Lie?&quot; It featured Christopher C. Horner, a climate change denier and lawyer for the libertarian Competitive Enterprise Institute, a largely industry-backed group that strongly opposes limits on greenhouse gases. At the meeting, delegates unanimously approved a resolution that &quot;strongly supports any legislative action that would suspend EPA&#x27;s authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act&quot;. Right before the meeting, the Union of Concerned Scientists sent the group a letter pointing out that its climate change position runs counter to that of every major scientific organization and urged it to support action on climate change. U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack said that farmers have more to gain from cap and trade than they stand to lose.

By 2019, the Farm Bureau had ceased to publicly deny climate change, but remained opposed to non-market-based solutions, including opposing taxes on carbon uses or emissions. &quot;Politico&quot; called it a “longtime, powerful foe of federal action on climate.&quot;

==== Food and Agriculture Climate Alliance ====
In 2020, the Farm Bureau became one of four co-founders of the Food and Agriculture Climate Alliance (FACA), a coalition of groups advocating for voluntary, incentive-based and market-oriented programs in the food and agriculture sector to respond to climate change. The coalition&#x27;s website says its 80-plus member organizations represent &quot;farmers, ranchers, forest owners, agribusinesses, manufacturers, the food and innovation sector, state governments, sportsmen, and environmental advocates&quot;, who cooperate to &quot;develop and promote shared climate policy priorities across the entire agriculture, food and forestry value chains. While &quot;The New Republic&quot; reported in 2022 that the organization &quot;wants guarantees that farmers will get paid for soil sequestration without anything else in agricultural business-as-usual changing&quot;, FACA has called for “a comprehensive effort involving financial and technical assistance, research investments, proactive response to innovation, public-private partnerships, and a commitment to equitable opportunities for all producers” to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

In 2022, FACA and AFBF supported the Senate&#x27;s passing of the Growing Climate Solutions Act. In February 2023, FACA released policy recommendations for the 2023 farm bill, calling for voluntary bipartisan climate solutions. The recommendations included incentives for farmers to plant cover crops and use precision agriculture equipment that more efficiently uses fertilizers and pesticides; a USDA grant program to improve soil health; a study to look for barriers to climate-smart practices in the crop insurance program; and changes to income limits so that all farmers can participate in “landscape level projects” to advance conservation and climate goals.

=== 2012 Farm Bill ===
The AFBF was heavily involved in lobbying for the 2012 farm bill, which included $9 billion in federal subsidies for crop insurance.

=== Animal welfare ===

In 2022, the Farm Bureau joined the National Pork Producers Council in petitioning the Supreme Court of the United States to overturn California&#x27;s Prevention of Cruelty to Farm Animals Act in &quot;National Pork Producers Council v. Ross&quot;.

=== WOTUS ===
In 2023, AFBF was one of several organizations to legally challenge the new Waters of the United States rule.

==Insurance==
In addition to its political lobbying, the Farm Bureau is &quot;a multi-billion dollar network of for-profit insurance companies&quot; and the third-largest insurance group in the United States, &quot;The Nation&quot; wrote in 2012. Although AFBF itself does not sell insurance, all but a handful of its non-profit state affiliates have affiliated for-profit insurance companies. Most of these companies were founded by the state Farm Bureaus and retain &quot;Farm Bureau&quot; in their corporate names; some use the NFBF logo. &quot;In many states, Missouri among them, members of the Farm Bureau board and the board of its affiliated insurance company are one and the same, sharing office buildings and support staff,&quot; &quot;The Nation&quot; wrote.

In many states, the non-profit state Farm Bureau owns the affiliated for-profit insurance company. FBL Financial Group, for example, was established in 1939 as Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Company by the Iowa chapter of the Farm Bureau. Through expansion and mergers, FBL has grown to operate in 14 states, generally selling to consumers under the name Farm Bureau Financial Services. In 2022, it had profits of $72.51 million on revenues of $732.3 million. Its parent, the Iowa Farm Bureau, reported 2020 revenue of about $100 million and an investment portfolio worth more than $1 billion, while executive compensation was in the high six figures.&quot;

Similarly, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company began as an insurance company for members of the Ohio Farm Bureau Federation and today serves as an insurance provider to Farm Bureaus in nine states. Farm Family Insurance, founded in 1955 by Farm Bureaus of several northeastern states, had 2000 revenues of $313 million and assets of more than $1.3 billion. Country Financial, founded by the Illinois Farm Bureau in 1925, served clients in 17 states as of 2017.

&quot;The Farm Bureau has many for-profit interests outside of traditional farming,&quot; &quot;60 Minutes&quot;&#x27; Mike Wallace reported in 2000. &quot;Its Iowa chapter alone owns and operates a $3.5 billion insurance and financial services company that is traded on the New York Stock Exchange. That company, FBL Financial Group, gave thousands of stock options to its directors, including the presidents of 14 state Farm Bureaus.&quot; Ed Wiederstein, president of the Iowa Farm Bureau and chairman of FBL Financial, cashed in a &quot;couple of hundred thousand bucks from stock options&quot; in 1998.

=== American Agricultural Insurance Company ===
The American Agricultural Insurance Company was formed in 1948 as a capital stock company. It is owned by the “insurance company affiliates of various state Farm Bureau insurance companies and by AFBF.”It was reincorporated in 1954, and became a mutual carrier under the name American Agricultural Mutual Insurance Company, and then was reincorporated again in 1968 as a capital stock company under its current name.

The Farm Bureau also owns crop insurer American Farm Bureau Insurance Services, formed in 1995. AAIC began selling crop insurance in 1997. In 1999, the AAIC purchased Nationwide-Re as part of its plan to expand into Non-Farm Bureau premium writings. The AAIC is a reinsurer primarily assuming business from Farm Bureau insurance companies.

The company’s bylaws require its board of directors to include the president of the Federation and designated shareholders that are “affiliated with a state Farm Bureau organization that is a member of AFBF.”

Similarly, AFBF president Zippy Duval simultaneously serves as president and chairman of the board of American Agricultural Insurance Company, whose directors are the presidents of 16 of the state Farm Bureaus. Its common stock is held by AFBF (443 shares in 2018) and various state Farm Bureau insurance companies (a total of 265,830 shares in 2018); it is unclear who owns its premium stock, which has a par value ten times that of the common stock. In 2021, AAIC reported total assets of $1.8 billion (up from $1.35 billion in 2018), premiums of $464 million (up from $328 million in 2018), and cash on hand of $120 million.

These kinds of ties can create conflicts of interest. &quot;Nonprofit executives are supposed to operate in the best interest of the nonprofit, not themselves. But, by not taking salaries and having their income tied to FBL’s performance, the [Iowa] Farm Bureau’s executives open themselves up to questions,&quot; wrote Investigate Midwest, an independent, nonprofit newsroom.

The AFBF and its affiliated insurance companies are entwined in other ways as well. Most of the people it claims as &quot;members&quot; are not farmers but insurance customers: &quot;In many states, anyone who signs up for Farm Bureau insurance becomes a member of the Farm Bureau automatically, which explains why the American Farm Bureau Federation boasts 6 million members when the United States has only about 2 million farmers.&quot; Sometimes annual-dues-paying membership in a state Farm Bureau is required to purchase the insurance; sometimes the insurance companies pay the state or county Farm Bureau a fee per member to access their contact information for marketing purposes. In 2019, AFBF collected $28.4 million in member dues, which accounted for more than three-quarters of its total revenue of $37.6 million.

The process of determining if a word is from the substratum involves comparison to Latin, languages with which Romanian came into contact, or determining if it is an internal construct. If there are no matching results, a comparison to Albanian vocabulary, Thracian remnants or Proto-Indo-European reconstructed words is made.

In addition to vocabulary, some other features of Eastern Romance, such as phonological features and elements of grammar (see Balkan sprachbund) may also be from Paleo-Balkan languages.

Romanian developed from the Common Romanian language, which in turn developed from Vulgar Latin. According to a widely accepted theory, the territory where the language formed was a large one, consisting of both the north and the south of the Danube (encompassing the regions of Dacia, Moesia, and possibly Illyria), more precisely to the north of the Jireček Line. Other scholars place the origin of the Romanian language in the Balkan Peninsula, strictly south of the Danube. &quot;The Cambridge History of the Romance Languages&quot;, published in 2013, came to the conclusion that the &quot;historical, archaeological and linguistic data available do not seem adequate&quot; to determine the territory where the development of the Romanian language began.

==Lexical items==

The study of the substrate involves comparative methods applied to:
#Albanian and its reconstructed ancient precursor – Proto-Albanian – an Indo-European language and the only surviving representative of the Albanoid branch, belonging to the Paleo-Balkan group of antiquity. Albanian varieties are today spoken by approximately 6 million people in the Balkans, primarily in Albania, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Serbia, Montenegro and Greece. Albanian, especially the Tosk dialect, also represents one of the core languages of the Balkan Sprachbund.
# Thraco-Dacian or Thracian, a language that although almost unattested has left traces in toponomy and inscriptions.
# Proto-Indo-European, if none of the other languages yielded any results.

===Comparative methods applied to Albanian===

In general, words assumed to belong to substratum can be placed into two categories:

those related to nature and natural world
* terrain: , , , , ; 
* bodies of water: , ;
* flora: , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ;
* fauna: , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ;
and those used in pastoral life for:
* food: , , , , , , urdă, ;
* clothing: , , , ;
* housing: &quot;argea, cătun, gard&quot;;
* body (some initially used for livestock): &quot; buză, ceafă, ciuf, grumaz, guşă, rânză&quot;;
* related activities: &quot;baci, bâr, buc, grapă, gresie, lete, strungă, ţarc, zgardă&quot;.

Other words from substratum are: &quot;bucur(ie), ciupi, copil, cursă, fluier, droaie, gata, ghiuj, jumătate, mare (adj), moş, scăpăra.&quot;
Words possibly of substratum but not generally agreed among linguists are: &quot;arichiță, băiat, băl, brâncă, orbalţ, borţ, bulz, burduf, burtă, codru, Crăciun, creţ, cruţa, curma, daltă, dărâma, fluture, lai, mătură, mire, negură, păstaie, scorbură, spuză, stăpân, sterp, stână, traistă&quot;.

===Comparative methods applied to Thraco-Dacian and/or other Indo-European languages===

The comparative method can be extended to other languages of the Indo-European family, including ones from which Romanian could not have borrowed directly or indirectly, in order to reconstruct Thraco-Dacian substratum words. This yields results with varying degrees of probability. Between 80 and 100 words belong to this category.

Substratum words like &quot;mal&quot; (1. shore, bank; 2. ravine, reg. a raised portion of land smaller than a hill and with abrupt sides) have almost identical correspondents in Albanian &quot;mal&quot; (mountain), but they can also be related to toponyms like Dacia Maluensis later renamed by Romans to Dacia Ripensis (&quot;rīpa&quot; - meaning bank, shore - has been inherited in Romanian as &quot;râpă&quot; - the abrupt side of a hill).

All river names over 500 km and half of those between 200 and 500 km derive from pre-Latin substratum, according to linguist and philologist Oliviu Felecan. Similarly, linguist Grigore Brâncuș states that almost the entire major hydronymy has been transmitted from Dacian to Romanian. Other linguists have pointed out that the present Romanian forms of these hydronyms indicate that they were borrowed from Slavs or Hungarians.

==Phonetic, morphological and syntactic features==

A couple of phonetic changes have been agreed on as substratum influence:

* the fricative post-alveolar consonant &quot;ș&quot; - /ʃ/ - comes from the voiceless fricative &quot;s&quot; in a soft position for example Lat. &quot;serpens&quot;&gt; Rom. &quot;șarpe&quot;.
* rhotacism of n consonant, seen only marginally in Romanian, is a general rule for lexical items of Istro-Romanian and Tosk Albanian prior to the contact with Slavic languages (before ).

Several other have been attributed to the influence of substratum by some researchers, but there is no general consensus among scholars. For example, the development of &quot;ă&quot; vowel: linguists Al. Phillipide and Grigore Brâncuș consider the spontaneous evolution of unstressed &quot;a&quot; from words like Lat. &quot;camisia&quot;&gt;Rom. &quot;cămașă&quot;, and stresses &quot;a&quot; before a /n/ or a consonant cluster beginning with /m/, a vowel found also in Bulgarian and Albanian, as the substratum influence in Romanian, while linguist Marius Sala points this changes can also be seen as the tendency of the oral language to differentiate between forms of a paradigm, comparable to the development of similar central vowels in Portuguese or Neapolitan.

Likewise, the morphological and syntactical features attributed to substratum, identified by comparison to Albanian and other languages of the Balkan sprachbund, are subject to scholarly debate since the grammatical structure of the ancient languages of the Balkans, except Greek, is unattested.

==A difficult research topic==

Numerous language studies and research papers discuss the problems of the Substrate in Romanian, considered by some to be the most controversial and difficult part of Romanian language since its nature and development could explain the evolution of Latin to Romanian.

Some linguists (including Sorin Olteanu, Sorin Paliga and Ivan Duridanov) propose that a number of words presented as borrowings from a Slavic language or from Hungarian in standard literature may have actually developed from reconstructed (not attested) words of local Indo-European languages and they were borrowed from Romanian by the neighboring languages. Though the substratum status of many Romanian words is not much disputed, their status as Dacian words is controversial, some more than others since there are no significant surviving written examples of the Dacian language. Many of the possible pre-Roman lexical items of Romanian have Albanian parallels, and if they are in fact substratum words cognates with the Albanian ones, and not loanwords from Albanian, it indicates that the substrate language of Romanian may have been on the same Indo-European branch as Albanian.

==Other languages==

The Bulgarian Thracologist Vladimir Georgiev developed the theory that the Romanian language has a &quot;Daco-Moesian&quot; language as its substrate, a hypothecised language that according to him had a number of features which distinguished it from the Thracian language spoken further south, across the Haemus range.

There are also some Romanian substratum words in languages other than Romanian, these examples having entered via Romanian dialects. For example, Bryndza is a type of cheese made in Eastern Austria, Poland, the Czech Republic (Moravian Wallachia), Slovakia and Ukraine, the name being derived from the Romanian word for cheese (&quot;brânză&quot;).

<doc id="392792" wikidata="Q2141950" url="?curid=392792" title="Tank Girl">
<text>Tank Girl is a British comic book character created by Alan Martin and Jamie Hewlett. It first appeared in print in 1988 in the British comics magazine &quot;Deadline&quot;, and then in the solo comic book series Tank Girl. After a period of intense popularity in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Tank Girl inspired a 1995 feature film. After a long hiatus, the character returned to comics in 2007 and has appeared regularly in the years since.

Originally written by Martin and drawn by Hewlett, the character has also been drawn by Philip Bond, Glyn Dillon, Ashley Wood, Warwick Johnson-Cadwell, Jim Mahfood, Brett Parson, Jonathan Edwards, Craig Knowles, Rufus Dayglo, Andy Pritchett, and Mike McMahon.

Tank Girl (Rebecca Buck – later revealed to have been born as Fonzie Rebecca Buckler) drives a tank, which is also her home. She undertakes a series of missions for a nebulous organization before making a serious mistake and being declared an outlaw for her sexual inclinations and her substance abuse. The comic centres on her misadventures with her boyfriend, Booga, a mutant kangaroo. The comic&#x27;s irreverent style is heavily influenced by punk visual art, and strips are frequently deeply disorganized, anarchic, absurdist, and psychedelic. The strip features various elements with origins in surrealist techniques, fanzines, collage, cut-up technique, stream of consciousness, and metafiction, with very little regard or interest for conventional plot or committed narrative.

The strip was initially set in a post-apocalyptic (rendered self-fending due to an implied nuclear armageddon) Australia, although it drew heavily from contemporary British pop culture.

==Publication history==
Martin and Hewlett first met in the mid-1980s in Worthing, while studying at The West Sussex College of Art and Design (WSCD, later renamed Northbrook College). Martin was in the college band The University Smalls with fellow comics enthusiast Philip Bond. One of their songs was called &quot;Rocket Girl&quot;. They had started adding the suffix &#x27;girl&#x27; to everything habitually after the release of the &quot;Supergirl&quot; movie, but &quot;Rocket Girl&quot; was a student at college on whom Bond had a crush and who apparently bore a striking resemblance to a &quot;Love and Rockets&quot; character. Martin and Hewlett began collaborating on a comic/fanzine called &quot;Atomtan&quot;, and while working on this, Hewlett had drawn:
The image was published in the fanzine as a one-page ad, but the &quot;Tank Girl&quot; series first appeared in the debut issue of &quot;Deadline&quot; (1988), a UK magazine intended as a forum for new comic talent, and it continued until the end of the magazine in 1995.

&quot;Tank Girl&quot; became quite popular in the politicized indie counterculture zeitgeist as a cartoon mirror of the growing empowerment of women in punk rock culture. Posters, shirts, and underpants began springing up everywhere, including one especially made for the Clause 28 march against Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s legislation. Clause 28 stated that a local authority &quot;shall not intentionally promote homosexuality or publish material with the intention of promoting homosexuality&quot; or &quot;promote the teaching in any maintained school of the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship.&quot; &quot;Deadline&quot; publisher Tom Astor said, &quot;In London, there are even weekly lesbian gatherings called &#x27;Tank Girl nights.&#x27;&quot;

With public interest growing, Penguin, the largest publishing company in Britain, bought the rights to collect the strips as a book, and before long, &quot;Tank Girl&quot; had been published in Spain, Italy, Germany, Scandinavia, Argentina, Brazil and Japan, with several United States publishers fighting over the licence. Finally Dark Horse Comics won, and the strips were reprinted beginning in 1991, with an extended break in &#x27;92, and ending in September &#x27;93. A graphic novel-length story named &quot;Tank Girl: The Odyssey&quot; was also published in 1995 (released in four issues by Vertigo Comics), written by Peter Milligan and loosely inspired by Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;, and a considerable quantity of junk TV. This was followed by another four issue series, &quot;Tank Girl: Apocalypse&quot;, written by Alan Grant and published by Vertigo from November 1995 to February 1996.

===After 1996 ===
After the 1995 film, Hewlett went on to create the band Gorillaz with Blur&#x27;s Damon Albarn. Martin has also played in various bands, and written various screenplays and scripts.

After a long publishing hiatus, the character returned in 2007 in &quot;Tank Girl: The Gifting&quot;, a four-issue limited series written by Martin and illustrated by Australian artist Ashley Wood, which was published by IDW Publishing. This was the first new Tank Girl comic material since the final two issues of the four issue series &quot;Tank Girl: Apocalypse&quot; in 1996. The four-issue limited series &quot;Tank Girl: Visions of Booga&quot;, by Martin and artist Rufus Dayglo, was released in 2008 by IDW, as was &quot;Tank Girl: Armadillo and a Bushel of Other Stories&quot;, a Tank Girl novel authored by Martin and published by Titan Books.

Since then, Tank Girl has appeared on a regular basis in various one-shots and limited series, published by IDW, Image Comics, and Titan Comics. The regular creative team is Alan Martin and Brett Parson.

Titan Books released &quot;The Hole of Tank Girl&quot; on 28 September 2012, which encompasses the original Hewlett and Martin material, as well as additional content.

The three-issue limited series &quot;21st Century Tank Girl&quot; debuted on 10 June 2015.

Martin and artist Warwick Johnson-Cadwell have also created a kid-friendly spin-off called &quot;Young Tank Girl&quot;, published in the digital anthology &quot;Moose Kid Comics&quot;.

In 2019, Titan Comics debuted &quot;Tank Girl&quot;, publicized as Tank Girl&#x27;s first ongoing series, with an indicia listing the book as &quot;Tank Girl Ongoing&quot;. From January to May 2019, the first four issues were cover-titled &quot;Tank Girl: Action Alley&quot;, and from July to December 2019, the next four issues were cover-titled &quot;Tank Girl Forever&quot;.

==Characters==
* Tank Girl: Her real name in the strip is Rebecca Buck, but this is very rarely mentioned. She became a tank driver and worked as a bounty hunter, before shooting a heavily decorated officer, having mistaken him for her father, and failing to deliver colostomy bags to President Hogan, the incontinent Head of State in Australia, resulting in him publicly embarrassing himself at a large international trade conference. These events resulted in Tank Girl becoming an outlaw with a multi-million dollar bounty on her head. She is prone to random acts of sex and violence, hair dyeing, flatulence, nose picking, vomiting, spitting, and more than occasional drunkenness. She also has the ability to outrun any ice cream van – even Mr. Whippy. Tank Girl typically wears cut-off T-shirts or simply a bra, along with shorts and plenty of earrings and necklaces. Her natural hair color appears to be blonde, though she has appeared in many different hairstyles. 
* Booga: A mutated kangaroo, formerly a successful toy designer of &quot;products Santa would&#x27;ve sacrificed a reindeer for,&quot; and presently Tank Girl&#x27;s devoted boyfriend. She met him when he sneaked into her tank one night to pinch a pair of her knickers. He is a big Dame Edna fan and once impersonated Bill Clinton. Booga, often against his will, always does the cooking, particularly the great British institution of tea. He follows Tank Girl everywhere and does, by his own admission, whatever she tells him. This includes murder.
* The talking stuffed animals:
:*Camp Koala: A stitchy, brown, gay, koala-shaped stuffed toy described as &quot;the Jeremy Thorpe of comics&quot;, whom TG sodomizes with a hot banana. Camp Koala died tragically when they were playing baseball with live hand grenades which Camp eagerly caught in the outfield, exploding on impact, resulting in a violent, bloody, and gruesome death. After a tearless and comical funeral service, the other characters go to a toy store and buy a new one. Camp Koala is known for visiting occasionally as a guardian angel. He is the only character TG has ever admitted to loving.
:*Squeaky toy rat: A squeaky toy rat.
:*Mr. Precocious: A &quot;small Shakespearean mutant&quot; who looks a bit like a mini bipedal , though may possibly be a bilby.
* Stevie: A wild-haired blond Aboriginal man who owns a convenience store and chain-smokes. Since he is TG&#x27;s ex-boyfriend, Booga is always a bit jealous of him. He has various familial ties and connections with Aboriginal culture and remote traditionalist tribespeople.
* Barney: Busted out of a mental hospital by TG, she is more or less insane. In &quot;The Odyssey&quot;, she is responsible for killing the whole cast, thereby sending them all to the land of the dead, from which TG was forced to save them by finding the Prince of Farts.
* Sub Girl (real name unknown, although a trading card for the film once listed her real name as &#x27;Subrina&#x27;): Described as &quot;like a beautiful flower floating in the loo&quot;, she pilots a submarine. A friend of TG&#x27;s since childhood, she used to come round her house with Jet Girl and try on her mum&#x27;s underwear.
* Jet Girl (real name unknown): A talented mechanic who flies a jet. All her friends call her &quot;boring&quot; (she has admitted to being a big fan of Rod Stewart).

==Collected editions==
Tank Girl has been collected into a number of trade paperbacks over the years. The entire back catalogue was reprinted by Titan Books in 2002 and these books were &quot;re-mastered&quot; in anniversary editions, stripped of their subsequently-added computer colouring and line work repaired. In 2018 the entire Hewlett and Martin back catalogue was once again reprinted under the &quot;Tank Girl Colour Classics&quot; banner, this time as collectible hardbacks, with all-new colouring and extra material.

The comic was also adapted into a critically and financially unsuccessful film, albeit with a small cult following. The film featured Lori Petty as Tank Girl and Naomi Watts as Jet Girl. Martin and Hewlett are known for speaking poorly of the experience, with Martin calling it &quot;a bit of a sore point&quot; for them.

In September 2019, a &quot;Tank Girl&quot; reboot movie was reported to be in development with Margot Robbie&#x27;s production company LuckyChap Entertainment optioned rights from MGM, Robbie co-produce with her partners Tom Ackerley and Josey McNamara, Mallory Westfall writing and Miles Joris-Peyrafitte directing.

<text>Big Brothers Big Sisters of America is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization whose mission is to &quot;create and support one-to-one mentoring relationships that ignite the power and promise of youth&quot;. Adult volunteers are matched with children from age 5 to young adulthood. It was founded by Ernest Kent Coulter.

==Congressional charter==
The group holds a congressional charter under Title 36 of the United States Code.

==Impact==
Public/Private Ventures, an independent Philadelphia-based national research organization, conducted a study from 1994 to 1995, monitoring 950 boys and girls nationwide to study the effects of Big Brothers Big Sisters. CEO Karen J. Mathis reported that the study found favorable outcomes to the organization.

Public/Private Ventures conducted another study in 2011 that evaluated the school-based Big Brothers Big Sisters Program. This program also found favorable outcomes.

==History==
In 1904, a young New York City court clerk named Ernest Kent Coulter was seeing many boys come through his courtroom. He recognized that caring adults could help many of these boys stay out of trouble, and he set out to find volunteers. That marked the beginning of Big Brothers Big Sisters of New York City and the Big Brothers movement. By 1916, Big Brothers had spread to 96 cities across the country.

At around the same time, the members of a group called Ladies of Charity were befriending girls who had come through the New York Children&#x27;s Court. That group would later become Catholic Big Sisters, an independent organization.

In 1958, the Big Brothers Association was granted a Congressional charter. Big Sisters International was founded in 1970. Both groups continued to work independently until 1977, when Big Brothers of America and Big Sisters International joined forces and became Big Brothers Big Sisters of America.

Big Brothers Big Sisters received the American Institute of Philanthropy&#x27;s highest rating, an A+. In 2011, Philanthropedia listed BBBS as the #1 Nonprofit for At-Risk Youth.

In 2013, Big Brothers Big Sisters of America (BBBSA) found itself at the center of a scandal involving grant funding, which led to sweeping changes at the organization. On June 24, 2013, the United States Department of Justice issued an Audit Report stating it was freezing the disbursement of all grant funds to BBBSA, noting that the organization was &quot;in material non-compliance with the majority of the grant requirements&quot; that were tested by the audit. &quot;As a result of these weaknesses,&quot; the audit noted, the agency &quot;questioned $19,462,448 in funding that the grantee has received and recommended the $3,714,838 in funds not yet disbursed be put to better use&quot;. The audit further stated that &quot;most significantly&quot;, it &quot;found that BBBSA&#x27;s practices for recording and supporting grant-related expenditures were inadequate to safeguard grant funds and ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the grants&quot;.

In the wake of the 2013 audit, Big Brothers replaced its management team and implemented policies governing the use of federal grant funds to bring the organization back into compliance. As part of a settlement with the Justice Department, BBBSA paid $1.6 million and agreed to institute a strict compliance program that requires the organization to engage in regular audits, establish a compliance team, an employee code of conduct, whistleblower policies and a disciplinary policy for employees who engage in or fail to disclose abuses of federal grant funds. The organization also provides regular employee training on these policies and employs risk assessment tools to detect abuses that might otherwise go undetected.

The claims resolved by this settlement are allegations only; there has been no determination of liability. BBBSA and many of its affiliates remain partnered with OJJDP today.

<doc id="392794" wikidata="Q24722801" url="?curid=392794" title="Plastocyanin">
<text>Plastocyanin is a copper-containing protein that mediates electron-transfer. It is found in a variety of plants, where it participates in photosynthesis. The protein is a prototype of the blue copper proteins, a family of intensely blue-colored metalloproteins. Specifically, it falls into the group of small type I blue copper proteins called &quot;cupredoxins&quot;.

== Function ==
In photosynthesis, plastocyanin functions as an electron transfer agent between cytochrome f of the cytochrome &quot;b&quot;6&quot;f&quot; complex from photosystem II and P700+ from photosystem I. Cytochrome &quot;b&quot;6&quot;f&quot; complex and P700+ are both membrane-bound proteins with exposed residues on the lumen-side of the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts. Cytochrome f acts as an electron donor while P700+ accepts electrons from reduced plastocyanin.

== Structure ==
Plastocyanin was the first of the blue copper proteins to be characterised by X-ray crystallography. It features an eight-stranded antiparallel β-barrel containing one copper center.

Structures of the protein from poplar, algae, parsley, spinach, and French bean plants have been characterized crystallographically. In all cases the binding site is generally conserved. Bound to the copper center are four ligands: the imidazole groups of two histidine residues (His37 and His87), the thiolate of Cys84 and the thioether of Met92. The geometry of the copper binding site is described as a ‘distorted tetrahedral’. The Cu-S (Cys) contact is much shorter (207 picometers) than Cu-S (Met) (282 pm) bond. The elongated Cu-thioether bond appears to destabilise the CuII state thereby enhancing its oxidizing power. The blue colour (597 nm peak absorption) is assigned to a charge transfer transition from Spπ to Cudx2-y2.

In the reduced form of plastocyanin, His-87 becomes protonated.

While the molecular surface of the protein near the copper binding site varies slightly, all plastocyanins have a hydrophobic surface surrounding the exposed histidine of the copper binding site. In plant plastocyanins, acidic residues are located on either side of the highly conserved tyrosine-83. Algal plastocyanins, and those from vascular plants in the family Apiaceae, contain similar acidic residues but are shaped differently from those of plant plastocyanins—they lack residues 57 and 58. In cyanobacteria, the distribution of charged residues on the surface is different from eukaryotic plastocyanins and variations among different bacterial species is large. Many cyanobacterial plastocyanins have 107 amino acids. Although the acidic patches are not conserved in bacteria, the hydrophobic patch is always present. These hydrophobic and acidic patches are believed to be the recognition/binding sites for the other proteins involved in electron transfer.

==Reactions==
Plastocyanin (Cu2+Pc) is reduced (an electron is added) by cytochrome f according to the following reaction:

:Cu2+Pc + e− → Cu+Pc

After dissociation, Cu+Pc diffuses through the lumen space until recognition/binding occurs with P700+, at which point P700+ oxidizes Cu+Pc according to the following reaction:

:Cu+Pc → Cu2+Pc + e−

The redox potential is about 370 mV and the isoelectric pH is about 4.

== Entatic state ==
A catalyst&#x27;s function is to increase the speed of the electron transfer (redox) reaction. Plastocyanin is believed to work less like an enzyme where enzymes decrease the transition energy needed to transfer the electron. Plastocyanin works more on the principles of entatic states where it increases the energy of the reactants, decreasing the amount of energy needed for the redox reaction to occur. Another way to rephrase the function of plastocyanin is that it can facilitate the electron transfer reaction by providing a small reorganization energy, which has been measured to about .

To study the properties of the redox reaction of plastocyanin, methods such as quantum mechanics / molecular mechanics (QM/MM) molecular dynamics simulations. This method was used to determine that plastocyanin has an entatic strain energy of about .

Four-coordinate copper complexes often exhibit square planar geometry, however plastocyanin has a trigonally distorted tetrahedral geometry. This distorted geometry is less stable than ideal tetrahedral geometry due to its lower ligand field stabilization as a result of the trigonal distortion. This unusual geometry is induced by the rigid “pre-organized” conformation of the ligand donors by the protein, which is an entatic state. Plastocyanin performs electron transfer with the redox between Cu(I) and Cu(II), and it was first theorized that its entatic state was a result of the protein imposing an undistorted tetrahedral geometry preferred by ordinary Cu(I) complexes onto the oxidized Cu(II) site. However, a highly distorted tetrahedral geometry is induced upon the oxidized Cu(II) site instead of a perfectly symmetric tetrahedral geometry. A feature of the entatic state is a protein environment that is capable of preventing ligand dissociation even at a high enough temperature to break the metal-ligand bond. In the case of plastocyanin, it has been experimentally determined through absorption spectroscopy that there is a long and weak Cu(I)-SMet bond that should dissociate at physiological temperature due to increased entropy. However, this bond does not dissociate due to the constraints of the protein environment dominating over the entropic forces.

In ordinary copper complexes involved in Cu(I)/Cu(II) redox coupling without a constraining protein environment, their ligand geometry changes significantly, and typically corresponds to the presence of a Jahn-Teller distorting force. However, the Jahn-Teller distorting force is not present in plastocyanin due to a large splitting of the dx2-y2 and dxy orbitals (See Blue Copper Protein Entatic State). Additionally, the structure of plastocyanin exhibits a long Cu(I)-SMet bond (2.9Å) with decreased electron donation strength. This bond also shortens the Cu(I)-SCys bond (2.1Å), increasing its electron donating strength. Overall, plastocyanin exhibits a lower reorganization energy due to the entatic state of the protein ligand enforcing the same distorted tetrahedral geometry in both the Cu(II) and Cu(I) oxidation states, enabling it to perform electron transfer at a faster rate. The reorganization energy of blue copper proteins such as plastocyanin from 0.7 to 1.2 eV (68-116 kJ/mol) compared to 2.4 eV (232 kJ/mol) in an ordinary copper complex such as [Cu(phen)2]2+/+.

== In the ocean ==
Usually, plastocyanin can be found in organisms that contain chlorophyll b and cyanobacteria, as well as algae that contain chlorophyll c. Plastocyanin has also been found in the diatom, &quot;Thalassiosira oceanica&quot;, which can be found in oceanic environments. It was surprising to find these organisms containing the protein plastocyanin because the concentration of copper dissolved in the ocean is usually low (between 0.4 – 50 nM). However, the concentration of copper in the oceans is comparatively higher compared to the concentrations of other metals such as zinc and iron. Other organisms that live in the ocean, such as other phytoplankton species, have adapted to where they do not need as high of concentrations of these low concentration metals (Fe and Zn) to facilitate photosynthesis and grow.

<doc id="392795" wikidata="Q940409" url="?curid=392795" title="Penis captivus">
<text>Penis captivus is a supposed occurrence during human sexual intercourse when the muscles in the vagina clamp down on the penis much more firmly than usual, making it impossible for the penis to be withdrawn from the vagina. According to a 1979 article in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot;, this condition was unknown in the twentieth century, but a subsequent letter to the same journal reported an apparent case of &quot;penis captivus&quot; in 1947. &quot;Penis captivus&quot; should not be confused with vaginismus, though a relation between the supposed event of &quot;penis captivus&quot; and the occurrence of vaginismus is assumed in the existing descriptions.

==Reported cases==
In an article published in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; in 1979, Dr F. Kräupl Taylor reviewed the literature on &quot;penis captivus&quot; and concluded that while &quot;almost all the cases mentioned in medical publications and in textbooks are based on hearsay and rumour&quot;, two papers published by nineteenth-century German gynaecologists – Scanzoni (1870) and Hildebrandt (1872) – who had personally dealt with cases of the condition &quot;leave no doubt about the reality of this unusual symptom&quot;, which, however, &quot;is so rare that it is often regarded nowadays as no more than a prurient myth&quot;. Scanzoni&#x27;s patient was &quot;a completely healthy young woman, married for six months&quot;. She and her husband had to abstain from sexual intercourse because her intense vaginal contractions were &quot;most painful to him and ... did on several occasions end in a spasm ... which sometimes lasted more than ten minutes and made it impossible for the couple to separate&quot;. Hildebrandt&#x27;s patient had been married for about a year. Sexual intercourse with her husband had always been painless until one particular evening. Hildebrandt gives the husband&#x27;s account of what happened:

Finding no later reports that were properly authenticated, Kräupl Taylor was of the opinion that the symptom &quot;does not seem to have occurred in the past 100 years or so. If there had been, during that time, a case of &quot;penis captivus&quot; that needed medical intervention or admission to hospital it would have been eagerly reported in a medical journal with as much detail and evidence as possible.&quot;

In a letter published in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; in 1980 in response to Kräupl Taylor&#x27;s article, Dr Brendan Musgrave recalled that in 1947 when he was a houseman at the Royal Isle of Wight County Hospital he had seen a case of this seemingly rare condition. &quot;I can distinctly remember the ambulance drawing up and two young people, a honeymoon couple I believe, being carried on a single stretcher into the casualty department. An anaesthetic was given to the female and they were discharged later the same morning.&quot; To check the veracity of his memory, Dr. Musgrave had rung his old friend Dr S.W. Wolfe, &quot;who was the other houseman at the hospital at the time. He confirmed my story, his exact words being &#x27;I remember it well.&#x27;&quot;

In her memoir &quot;An Impossible Woman&quot; (1975), Graham Greene&#x27;s friend dottoressa Elisabeth Moor recounts how she was once urgently called to the Hotel Eden-Paradiso in Anacapri, Italy. &quot;And there I found a young German girl, in the bathtub in a pool of blood, who begged me to do what I could; I should help her as she was bleeding to death&quot; from &quot;a tear in the vagina&quot;. The girl had been having sex with a man and her vagina had clamped tightly around his swollen penis. In freeing his penis, the man had inflicted &quot;a heavily bleeding tear. A very deep wound.&quot; He had then fled. After Dottoressa Moor had staunched the bleeding, she and a colleague she had summoned stitched the girl up. &quot;She healed very well.&quot; Dottoressa Moor adds, &quot;These cases are not as rare as you think.&quot; She mentions – though only as hearsay – &quot;a much worse case&quot; involving a Swiss girl that occurred in Lucerne, Switzerland, during the war and resulted in &quot;dreadful injuries&quot; when the man panicked: &quot;they had got stuck inside each other. It needed two or three doctors to help to undo them.&quot;

==Hoax report==
A report of the phenomenon in an 1884 article by one Egerton Yorrick Davis in the &quot;Philadelphia Medical News&quot; was later discovered to be a hoax perpetrated by Sir William Osler. Historians speculate that he was annoyed by an editorial published in the same journal by Dr. Theophilus Parvin, &quot;An Uncommon Form of Vaginismus&quot;. Both men served on that respected journal&#x27;s editorial board.

<text>Juan Alberto González Vázquez (born October 20, 1969) is a Puerto Rican former baseball outfielder. He played 16 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for four teams, but is most identified with the Texas Rangers, for whom he played from 1989 to 1999 and again from 2002 to 2003. One of the premier run producers and most feared hitters of the 1990s and early 2000s, González hit over 40 home runs five times and amassed at least 100 runs batted in (RBI) eight times. He also had a batting average of .310 or higher in five seasons.

In his career as a whole, González averaged 42 home runs, 135 RBI, 81 extra-base hits, and 353 total bases per 162 games, placing him well within the top ten all-time in these season-adjusted statistics.

González was known as a line drive hitter, not a fly-ball home run hitter, as were many power hitters of the 1990s. He was a full-time player at the age of 21 and a two-time Most Valuable Player before his 30th birthday. González explained his propensity for bringing runners home by saying, &quot;I concentrate more when I see men on base.&quot;

==Early life==
González grew up in a rough area of Puerto Rico, where as a young boy he learned to hit bottlecaps and corks with a broomstick handle in the Alto de Cuba barrio. In the Puerto Rico youth league, González batted cleanup behind future Yankee center fielder Bernie Williams, where both competed against González&#x27;s future teammate Iván Rodríguez. When the Yankees scouted the teenage Williams, he requested that they also bring his friend González to their scouting camp on the east coast; however, due to a lack of funding, González would remain in Puerto Rico.

==Professional career==
===Minors===
The Texas Rangers signed González as an amateur free agent on May 30, 1986, at the age of 16. González has always wanted to serve as a role model for the kids of Puerto Rico, as they are faced with the downfalls of drugs and prostitution frequently. González avoided such temptations growing up. His father, a math teacher, and mother, a housewife, made sure González and his two sisters behaved properly and stayed away from negative influences. González moved his family out of the barrio early in his MLB career. He paid utility bills for down-on-their-luck friends and plans on working to construct recreation facilities and a baseball diamond in his home town. One of Juan&#x27;s managers, Johnny Oates, believed that until you&#x27;ve walked where Juan González has walked, you just won&#x27;t understand. Speaking from experience, as Oates has walked the streets of Vega Baja, Puerto Rico, during visits multiple times, he had this to say: &quot;I don&#x27;t think you can appreciate how far he&#x27;s come until you&#x27;ve been there&quot;, Oates said. &quot;We might be making choices between going to the movies or going to the skating rink. But look at the choices the kids there were faced with growing up – do you want to do drugs or get beaten up? I think it says so much about him that he was able to rise above the peer pressure in Vega Baja. He had enough intelligence to say, &#x27;I don&#x27;t want to do that.&#x27;&quot;

In Puerto Rico he is known as &quot;Igor&quot;, the nickname he has carried since he was a nine-year-old fascinated by the professional wrestler &quot;Igor the Magnificent.&quot;
&quot;I watched wrestling all the time and I still like it&quot;, González said. &quot;One day when I was nine, I told another guy, &#x27;I&#x27;m Igor.&#x27; And he said, &#x27;Okay, your name is Igor from now on.&#x27; And I&#x27;ve been Igor since then.&quot;

González debuted with the 1986 GCL Rangers and finished with .240 batting average, .303 on-base percentage, and a .266 slugging percentage in 60 games. He only had five extra-base hits (none of them home runs) in 233 AB and struck out 57 times. He tied Harvey Pulliam by grounding into a Gulf Coast League-leading 9 double plays.

In 1987, González showed some improvement with the Gastonia Rangers, though Mark Whiten and Junior Felix were deemed better outfield prospects in the South Atlantic League. In ratings by Baseball America, González tied Ryan Bowen for 10th place on the prospect listing. He finished with .265 batting average, .306 on-base percentage, and .401 slugging percentage with 14 home runs and 74 RBI.

González spent 1988 with the Charlotte Rangers and batted .256/~.327/.415 with 8 home runs in 277 AB. One of his outfield teammates that year was Sammy Sosa. The next year, he showed more improvement with the Tulsa Drillers hitting .293/~.322/.506 with 21 home runs and led the Texas League with 254 total bases. He outhomered Sosa by 14 and was third in the League in home runs, behind teammate Dean Palmer (25) and Chris Cron (22). González was rated the league&#x27;s No. 4 prospect by Baseball America, behind Ray Lankford, Andy Benes and José Offerman. Lankford and Warren Newson joined him in the TL All-Star outfield.

===Texas Rangers (1989–1999)===
González was called up by the Texas Rangers in September of that year, but only hit .150/.227/.250. During his time with the Rangers that year, González only hit one home run. He became the youngest player in Rangers history (19 yrs old) to hit a home run.

In 1990, González – playing with the Oklahoma City 89ers – led the American Association in home runs (29), RBI (101) and total bases (252). He made the AAA All-Star outfield alongside Lankford and Bernard Gilkey and was named the league MVP. Baseball America named him the top prospect in the league in a poll of managers. He finished with .258/~.343/.508 for the 89ers. In the AAA All-Star Game, González hit 4th for the AL prospects and played as a designated hitter. He went 2 for 5 with a double, one of the game&#x27;s two homers, two runs and two RBI in the AL&#x27;s 8–5 loss. González was again called up by the Rangers and did far better this time, batting .289/.316/.522.

In 1991, Texas gave González a chance to be an everyday player. He batted .264 while hitting 27 home runs and recording 102 runs batted in (RBIs). González came up as a center fielder, as did teammate Sammy Sosa; but the Rangers opted to keep González and trade Sosa. González split his time in the OF between CF (93 games) and LF (92 games). González thrilled the club in his first full season at the young age of 21, as his 27 home runs led the Rangers. His 102 RBI was good enough for 2nd on the club, and 7th in the AL.

In 1992, González finished with a .260 batting average, 43 home runs, and 109 RBIs. He spent most of his time in CF in &#x27;92, playing 123 games there, 31 in LF and making just one appearance in RF, while DH-ing 4 games. He was the American League home run champion (one more than Mark McGwire) while also ranking 3rd in TB (309), 4th in extra-base hits (69), 5th in slugging percentage (.529), 7th in RBIs (109) while winning his first Silver Slugger Award. Winning the home run crown at the age of 22 made him the youngest player to lead the majors since Johnny Bench in 1970.

In 1993, González broke through to true stardom. He led the AL for the second consecutive year with 46 bombs, while raising his batting average an impressive 50 points to .310, all this to go along with a league-leading slugging percentage of .632. That production garnered González an invite to his first All-Star team. During the 1993 All-Star Weekend, he participated in the only Home Run Derby of his career. González and Ken Griffey Jr. put on an amazing display of raw-power, as they each golfed 7 homers a piece. González, however, wowed the national audience even more, becoming the first player to hit a homer into the facade of the upper deck in left field (estimated 473 feet) at Oriole Park at Camden Yards and the green wall behind the center-field fence (estimated 455 feet). González then defeated Griffey in a winner-take-all playoff for the individual Home Run Derby title, 5–4. When asked about the title, González responded: &quot;It was very exciting to surprise everybody. I never thought in my mind that I&#x27;d win the Home Run Derby. I even surprised myself.&quot; He also finished fourth in voting for the 1993 AL MVP and earned his second consecutive Silver Slugger Award.

In 1994, the Rangers moved from Arlington Stadium to The Ballpark in Arlington. González batted 19 home runs in 1994 during the strike-shortened season, but belted 27 home runs in 1995, in just 90 games.

From 1995–98, González was an RBI machine, averaging more than an RBI per game (514 RBI, 511 games). This made him the first player since World War II to drive in a run per game for any four-year period. He won two MVP awards in this stretch (1996 and 1998). The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract listed him as the player who had the highest ratio of slugging percentage to on-base percentage in baseball history at that time, ahead of Dave Kingman and Tony Armas and 4th in RBI per game by an outfielder (behind Sam Thompson, Joe DiMaggio and Babe Ruth). James also ranked González as the 52nd-best right fielder in baseball history as of mid-2000.

In 1996, González had one of his best seasons hitting .314 with a .643 slugging percentage. He edged Alex Rodríguez by one first-place vote (11–10) and 3 award points (290–287) in a very close vote to win the American League MVP. He won his third Silver Slugger as an outfielder and was second in the AL in slugging (87 points behind McGwire). He was selected to the Associated Press Major League All-Star Team and The Sporting News AL All-Star squad at season&#x27;s end. González was also named the Puerto Rico Pro Athlete of the Year by Associated Press and the DFW Metroplex Pro Athlete of the Year by the Dallas All Sports Association. He received the honorable selection of American League Player of the Month in July, leading the majors in batting (.407), homers (15), RBI (38), slugging (.917) and total bases (99). González was also the AL Player of the Week for July 29 – August 4. González had a pair of 21-game hitting streaks, June 25 – July 19 and August 8–31, matching the 3rd longest hitting streaks in team history with Mickey Rivers (1980) being the only other Ranger with 2 20-game hitting streaks in the same season. On July 30, González went 5–5 vs. New York, a career best and tied the club record for hits in a game. González was also chosen as a member of the Major League Baseball All-Star Team that traveled to Japan for an eight game exhibition series in November, batting .500 (10–20) with one homer and 3 RBI in 7 games. That year, the Texas Rangers made the playoffs, and in the 1996 American League Division Series, González homered five times in four games and batted .438/.526/1.375 with 9 RBI. Texas ended up losing in four games to the New York Yankees. González tied Jeffrey Leonard&#x27;s 1987 NLCS record by homering in four straight post-season games and joined Reggie Jackson and Ken Griffey Jr. as the only players to hit five home runs in a single post-season series. González, however, accomplished this feet in less games (4) than Leonard, Jackson and Griffey Jr; all of whom needed at least 5 games to accomplish said feat. Combining the regular season and postseason, González hit .315 with 52 home runs, 153 RBIs, and .664 slugging percentage in 1996.

In 1997, González batted .296/.335/.589 as a DH-RF for the Rangers, winning his fourth Silver Slugger Award. In 133 games he was 4th in slugging, 6th in total bases (314), third in homers (42) and RBI (131), 10th in extra-base hits (69) and tied for 6th with 10 sacrifice flies. González missed the first month of the season and was not activated from the DL until May 2 due to a torn ligament in his left thumb. Despite the injury he still managed to earn American League Player of the Month honors in September (.337, 10 home runs, 26 RBI) and was the Rangers Player of the Month in both August and September. González was selected to Baseball America&#x27;s American League All-Star Team.

In 1998, he reached the 100 RBI mark before the All-Star break (101), being the first player (and still most recent) to do so since Hank Greenberg 63 years earlier. He hit cleanup for the AL in the 1998 All-Star Game and decisively won the AL MVP award. González was 10th in the 1998 AL in batting average, second in slugging, fourth in OPS, 6th in hits (193), 4th in total bases (382), first in doubles (50), tied for fourth in home runs (45), first in RBI (157) in 154 games, tied for 8th in OPS+ (149), second in extra-base hits (97), tied for third in sac flies (11), tied for sixth in intentional walks (9) and tied for third in double plays ground into (20). In April, he drove in 35 runs, a major league record for the month that still stands today. González produced the 5th season ever of at least 50 doubles and 40 home runs. González started 115 games in Right and 36 as the DH.

González became the 1st 5-time winner of the Rangers Player of the Year Award and was also named as the AL&#x27;s Most Valuable Player by &quot;USA Today&quot; and &quot;USA Today Baseball Weekly&quot;. González was selected to major league all-star teams selected by the Associated Press (OF) and &quot;Baseball America&quot; (DH) and to the &quot;Sporting News&quot; AL all-star squad (OF). He was named as an outfielder on the AL Silver Slugger Award team for the 5th time in his career, his 3rd consecutive year. González shared Rangers Player of the Month honors with Iván Rodríguez in April and won the award outright in May. González also received the American League Player of the Week, for August 31 – September 6. He received 21 of 28 1st place mvp votes and 7 2nd place votes for 357 total points to defeat Boston&#x27;s Nomar Garciaparra, who had 5 1st place votes and 232 points. González also became the 1st native of Latin America to ever win multiple MVP&#x27;s since the award was instituted in 1931. This award also made him the 16th player to capture 2 MVP&#x27;s in a 3-year span. The Rangers reached the playoffs, only to be swept by the Yankees. The Rangers offense was miserable in the Division Series, scoring just one run on a Pudge Rodriguez single after doubling to lead off the inning.

In 1999, González was 9th in the AL in average, 4th in slugging, 6th in OPS, 10th in runs (114), 6th in total bases (338), 6th in home runs (39), 5th in RBI (128), 7th in extra-base hits (76) and 2nd in sacrifice flies (12). However, he and the Rangers wound up being swept for the second consecutive year by the Yankees in the Division Series. González wasn&#x27;t able to do much in the 3-game series, hitting .182/.250/.455 with one home run, but his solo bomb was the only run the Rangers scored in the series.

González announced just before the 1999 All-Star Game that if the fans did not elect him to the starting lineup, he would refuse an invitation to be added to the roster (as a result he was not invited). González believed that the system was flawed; he thought the managers and players should vote for the starters. A few weeks later González didn&#x27;t dress for the Hall of Fame exhibition game because (according to the media) the uniform pants the Rangers brought for him were too large. González later had this to say about the incident &quot;I couldn&#x27;t play because my right wrist was sore. The pants they gave me were size 40. I wear 34. They were clown pants.&quot;

===Detroit Tigers (2000)===
Following the 1999 season, with one year left on his contract, the slugger was traded by the Texas Rangers along with Danny Patterson and Gregg Zaun in a blockbuster nine-player deal with the Detroit Tigers for Frank Catalanotto, Francisco Cordero, Bill Haselman, Gabe Kapler, Justin Thompson, and Alan Webb. He became the first two-time MVP to be traded since Dale Murphy was sent from Atlanta to Philadelphia in 1990. Detroit Tiger general manager Randy Smith was paying a high price for González by trading multiple young players, but he couldn&#x27;t pass up on acquiring González, whom he referred to as &quot;a two-time MVP and future Hall-of-Famer,&quot; even though González would more likely be a one-year rental (and was).

Gambling that they would be able to extend his contract past the 2000 season, the Tigers reportedly offered González an eight-year, $140 million contract soon after the deal was struck. González refused, which turned out to be the bigger gamble. He began the season badly, hobbled by foot pain and unable to adjust to the spacious dimensions of Detroit&#x27;s new Comerica Park, where the left-center field fence stood nearly 400 feet from home plate (he did however hit the park&#x27;s first home run on April 14). By mid-season he had announced that the Tigers would have to bring the fences in if they wanted to re-sign him as a free agent.

Detroit shopped González before the trading deadline, but a deal that would have sent him to the Yankees for outfielder Ricky Ledée and two minor leaguers was scuttled when the outfielder made it clear that he didn&#x27;t want to play in New York. The Puerto Rico native stumbled through the rest of the season and saw his production dip to an all-time low (22 home runs, 67 RBI in 115 games). After missing the last weeks of the 2000 season, he was granted free agency on November 1.

===Cleveland Indians (2001)===
On January 9, 2001, he signed a one-year $10 million contract with the Cleveland Indians. González opened the season with a great start, batting .388 (40–103) with 9 homers and 32 RBIs in season&#x27;s first 25 games through May 2. González completed the first half on a torrid pace. He was voted in as an All-Star starter and batted 5th in the 2001 All-Star Game. González hit .347 with 23 home runs and 83 RBI in 79 games in the first half.

He appeared to be on his way to easily capturing the RBI title, but an RBI drought at the end of the season (0 RBI in last 10 games) allowed Bret Boone to pass him by one. González hit over .300 in each of season&#x27;s 1st 5 months before dropping to .299 for the month of September. His top months were .387 (36–93) in April and .356 (26–73) in July. González was hitting as high as .360 on June 5, then went 17–64 (.266) in next 17 contests, dropping to .338 through June 26. Had a .351 (73–208) mark in next 56 games and was at .344 overall, 2nd in the AL, through September 9. After this he hit just .130 (6–46) in final 13 games, going 3–34 (.088) in last 10 contests. González was hitless in his final 15 trips after his single on September 24. Despite his cold streak over the last week and a half of the season, he still finished with a .325/.370/.590 slash line and a 147 OPS+, close to his MVP seasons. He also won his sixth Silver Slugger and finished fifth in the MVP voting. His .325 average was one point shy of his career high (1999) and marked his 5th .300 season, his third in the last four years.

He was sixth in the 2001 AL in batting average, 5th in slugging, 6th in OPS, 9th in home runs (35), second in RBI (140, (in 140 games) one behind leader Bret Boone), 8th in OPS+, tied for third in double plays grounded into (18) and led the league with 16 sacrifice flies. González was also a 2nd team selection on Baseball America&#x27;s Major League all-star squad and was named as the Indians player of the year by Baseball America. This proved to be the last season in which González averaged an RBI a game. Although González finished the regular season rather slowly, he showed up in a big way in the playoffs where he hit .348/.348/.739 for Cleveland in the Division Series with 3 doubles, 2 homers and 5 RBI in 5 games. Despite this Cleveland still fell in defeat.

González had a season best 15-game hitting streak from August 29 – September 19 at .345 (20–58) and hit safely in 10 straight games from April 17–27. González also had a 4 hit game April 11 at the Chicago White Sox. González batted .368 (43–117) vs. left-handers, 3rd best in the AL and had a .335 (53–158) mark with runners in scoring position, the 8th highest. As the DH, he hit .392 (31–79), this was the highest average in AL among players with 35 or more DH at bats, with 8 homers and 33 RBI in 21 games.

Through 11 full major league seasons (1991-2001), González had 392 homers and 1,263 RBI, an average of 36 homers and 115 RBI per year. His RBI total was the most in MLB in during that time frame by 40, despite having 1,000 fewer plate appearances than the player with the second-most RBIs for the time period, Jeff Bagwell (who was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2017).

===Second stint with Texas Rangers (2002–2003)===
On January 8, 2002, González made his return to Arlington by signing a two-year $24 million contract with the Texas Rangers. He hit .282/.324/.451 (94 OPS+) the first year in 70 games. On June 18, he participated in the first MLB game ever with four players with 400+ home runs to that point. Rafael Palmeiro and Fred McGriff joined Sosa and González in a game which Texas lost to the Chicago Cubs, 4–3. His first season back in Arlington he had a .358 (29–81) average versus Lefties and hit .328 (21–64) with runners in scoring position while posting a .307 mark(42–137) in Arlington. He hit just .171 (6–35) with 2 homers and 4 RBI as the DH. He had Texas&#x27; only hit, a leadoff double in the 8th, off Cory Lidle on July 19 at Oakland.

In 2003, González started the first few weeks rather slowly. He had a .230 average with 4 homers and 8 RBI in his first 18 games through April 20. He quickly picked it up though and went on a .349 (29–83) tear with 9 homers and 24 RBI in his next 21 games, improving to .293 by May 5. As of May 7, González was tied for the Major League Lead in home runs with 12. He followed that up by going just 8-for-39 (.205) in his next 9 games, falling to .276 through May 25. He started a hot streak yet again though by hitting .321 (42–131) with 10 homers and 36 RBI in the next 34 games. But his season was cut short by a tear in his calf muscle on July 19. At the time, González was hitting .294 and ranked 3rd in home runs (24) 4th in slugging percentage (.572) and 7th in RBI (70) in the AL. González was on pace to recapture his 2001 Indians form, but the tear lingered and the injury proved to be the end of his season.

González hit 2 homers in a game 4 times: April 5 vs. Seattle; April 29 and May 1 at Toronto and July 10 against Minnesota. His 47 career multi-homer games are 12th most all-time. He also hammered 5 homers in 3 games, April 29 – May 1 at Toronto, the 4th time in Rangers history that feat had been accomplished. He had a season best 5 RBI on April 29 at Toronto and drove in 4 runs in a game on 3 occasions. González had 18 RBI in a 9-game span, April 22 – May 1, including 10 in 3-game series at Toronto, April 29 – May 1. He was selected as AL co-player of the week for April 28 – May 4. He also had a season high 9-game hitting streak, June 3–17.

He started 57 games in right field and 24 games as the designated hitter. He did not make an error in 108 total chances in the outfield and was tied for 6th in the league in outfield assists (10), despite his short season. He ranked 5th on the club in home runs (24), and completed his 11th season with 20 or more home runs. The Rangers, however, were preparing for a youth movement and on October 26, 2003, he was granted free agency.

===Kansas City Royals (2004)===
On January 6, 2004, González was signed by the Kansas City Royals to a one-year, $4.5 million deal with an option for the next season. However, his back worsened in the middle of May and his season came to an end after May 21. He ended up hitting .276/.326/.441 with five home runs and 17 RBI in 33 games. The Royals declined to renew his option, making him a free agent.

===Second stint with Cleveland Indians (2005)===
He was signed by the Cleveland Indians for the 2005 season, and was activated in May. Despite a thorough workout regimen, González suffered a major hamstring injury (he tore his right medial hamstring totally off the bone at the knee joint) in his first plate appearance of the season while running out a grounder. This put him out for the season after just one at-bat.

González signed on with the independent Atlantic League in 2006, playing for the Long Island Ducks. He hit .323/.377/.515 in 36 games, with 6 home runs and 23 RBI. His time was again limited by injuries.

The St. Louis Cardinals invited González to spring training prior to the 2008 season. He was one of 26 non-roster invitees, participating in full roster workouts that began on February 19, 2008. He hit .308 with a .462 slugging percentage in spring training with 1 home run, 1 double and 5 RBI in 9 games. However, he was put on the inactive list with an abdominal strain and he returned to Puerto Rico with an invitation to rejoin the Cardinals once he was healthy. González decided to stay in Puerto Rico, and did not rejoin the Cardinals.

In June 2013, González was invited to become a member of the Texas Rangers Hall of Fame. He declined the invitation at the time, saying, &quot;I closed the Texas Rangers chapter in my life a long time ago.&quot; A couple years later, though, he accepted the invitation and was inducted on July 11, 2015. González is the Rangers&#x27; all-time leader with 372 home runs, 1,180 RBIs and a .565 slugging percentage. His 157 RBIs in 1998 and .643 slugging percentage in 1996 are also club records. González ranks in the top 5 in club history in almost every other major offensive category.

===Career statistics===

In four American League Division Series covering 15 games, González hit .290 (18-for-62) scoring 11 runs, with 8 home runs and 15 RBI.

==Career in Puerto Rico==
In the 1989–1990 Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League, González hit .269/~.345/.500 for the Criollos de Caguas and hit 9 home runs, one less than former league leader Greg Vaughn.

During the 1992–1993 season, he batted .333 for the Santurce Crabbers and won the league MVP award despite not playing until after the All-Star break. He hit 7 home runs and led the league despite playing in only 66 games. González did not accompany Santurce to the 1993 Caribbean Series. The next season, he ended up hitting .268 with 7 homers, 3 behind Phil Hiatt.

In 1995, González joined the San Juan Senators for the 1995 Caribbean Series and hit .375 with 6 RBI as the Puerto Rican &quot;Dream Team&quot; won the title. González hit 5th, between Carlos Delgado and Rubén Sierra on a team that also boasted Roberto Alomar, Bernie Williams, Carlos Baerga and Edgar Martínez. San Juan outscored their opponents 49–15.

During the 2006–2007 Puerto Rican League, in 33 games playing for the champion Carolina Giants, González hit .281 with 18 RBIs and 4 homers. In 12 playoff games, he batted .369 with 3 home runs and 5 RBIs. González claims he is healthy and no longer feels pain in his legs. He was 10 for 26 (.385) in the 2007 Caribbean Series and made the All-Star team at DH.

Presently, he is the owner of the baseball team in his hometown, Vega Baja, in the Confederative Baseball League in Puerto Rico, where he also plays as a DH. Aside from baseball, he focuses on helping the community, with the condition that no attention from the media occurs when he becomes involved in a cause, stating &quot;What value does it have to help someone and then publicizing it in newspapers? That is not giving. I help, but I ask them to please not say anything.&quot;

For the 2015-2016 season, González served as coach of the Double A Vega Baja team, the Caimanes del Melao Melao. However, after a 3-11 record, he was fired.

==Steroid allegations==
González was one of several players whom Jose Canseco claimed to have introduced to steroids. Canseco made these allegations in his best-seller, &quot;Juiced&quot;, but without citing any corroborating evidence. González was also briefly mentioned in the Mitchell Report regarding a 2001 incident in which an unmarked bag in the Indians&#x27; team luggage was detained by customs in Toronto, Canada. González&#x27;s assistant stated that the bag belonged to Angel Presinal, a prominent personal trainer for a number of professional players, but Presinal claimed that the bag belonged to González. It was also disputed whether or not the bag actually contained steroids. Although Presinal claimed the bag was not his, he said that he was aware of its contents and that they were not, in fact, steroids. He stated that the bag contained Soladek (a painkiller), Dolo-neurobion (a vitamin B complex used in fighting the flu), and Clenbuterol (a stimulant similar to ephedrine, which is believed by some to promote muscle tone and weight loss). González immediately cut ties with the trainer following the incident. In 2007, ESPN published an article about Presinal on its website, describing him as &quot;fitness guru, massage therapist and personal trainer to baseball&#x27;s Latino elite.&quot; In the same article, ESPN asked John Hart, the Indians&#x27; former general manager, about the 2001 incident involving Presinal. Hart said that the team looked into the matter and ultimately exonerated Gonzalez.

In 2007, Rangers&#x27; owner Tom Hicks speculated that González had used steroids, saying in an interview that the team had acquired &quot;Juan González for $24 million after he came off steroids, probably, we just gave that money away.&quot; Hicks later acknowledged that his statement was not based on personal knowledge, only a suspicion that steroids were the cause of injuries: &quot;The way his body broke down at a young age and his early retirement makes me suspicious.&quot; Luis Mayoral, a former Ranger employee and good friend of González, reasoned that Hicks&#x27; comments were why González declined his first invitation to join the Texas Rangers Hall of Fame in 2013. Instead, he was inducted in 2015.

Like his former teammate, hall-of-famer Iván Rodríguez, who was also accused of steroid use, González has consistently stated over the years that he has never taken steroids, and is, in fact, a vegetarian. &quot;I have nothing to hide,&quot; said González. &quot;Nothing. And I offered to be tested, whenever they wanted. If you have nothing to hide, there is nothing to worry [about],&quot; González said. In Rodriguez&#x27;s case, similar unproven allegations from baseball&#x27;s &quot;steroid era&quot; did not prevent him from being elected to the Hall of Fame on the first ballot.

==Personal life==
González has been married four times. He was married to Puerto Rican volleyball player Elaine López, sister of fellow major leaguer Javy López, during the early 1990s. This marriage broke down when a local newspaper released a cover photo of singer Olga Tañón kissing González during a concert in San Juan. A scandal followed, with González divorcing Elaine López and marrying Tañón, who said she had no idea González was married to Lopez when she kissed him. González and Tañon had a daughter together, Gabriela González Tañón, in 1996. They got married in December 1999. González and Tañon divorced less than two years later. His daughter later became one of only 50 people in the world (and the first Puerto Rican) ever to have been diagnosed with Sebastian syndrome, a mild blood clotting disorder.

González has a friendship with George W. Bush which began when González debuted with the Texas Rangers who at the time were owned by Bush.
 González stated that &quot;a friendship that goes beyond baseball was created between them&quot; and during his time in office Bush invited González to the White House twice. The first of reunions took place on April 16, 2001 and the second on December 3, 2007; in this reunion he was accompanied by historian Luis Rodriguez Mayoral. The discussion lasted 35 minutes and involved González&#x27;s future in the Major Leagues and other baseball related topics, as well as the happenings of their respective careers. During this visit to Washington, D.C. González was also involved in a meeting with Rudy Giuliani and a visit to Walter Reed Army Medical Center in order to visit Puerto Rican soldiers that were injured in the Iraq War.

After a history of personal setbacks, González stated in a 2007 interview that his personal life was now in order. &quot;I&#x27;d rather have health and my family, my relationship with God than money,&quot; he said. &quot;How many people who can buy whatever they want have committed suicide? God is first, then your kids, your family, good health.&quot;

==Success as manager of Puerto Rico national team==

After serving as a coach in 2017, González was named manager and head coach of the Puerto Rico national baseball team in 2018, leading the team to gold medals in both 2018 and 2019.

González made his debut as manager at the 2018 Central American and Caribbean Games (CACG). Unable to request athletes contracted to MLB (or active in MiLB), González assembled a team consisting of players active in foreign independent leagues, the local Double A amateur league, and veteran free agents with previous professional experience, making the final cut following a preparatory tournament. González made his official debut as manager in a 5-3 victory over Venezuela. In its next outing, Puerto Rico defeated Cuba 8-1 to snap Cuba&#x27;s 36-year (43-game) winning streak at the CACG. This was followed by wins over the Dominican Republic (4-1) and Mexico (7-1). González closed his first participation as manager by leading Puerto Rico to the CACG gold medal, defeating second-place Colombia 2-1.

In 2019, González found continued success by guiding Puerto Rico to win gold at the 2019 Lima Pan American Games, going undefeated and besting Canada 6-1 in the final. This was Puerto Rico&#x27;s first-ever gold medal in baseball in the history of the Pan American Games.

Also in 2019, the Puerto Rican Baseball Federation announced that González would be the manager of the Puerto Rican National Team in November’s WBSC Premier12, the biggest international baseball event of the year, in preparation for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games.

<text>The Nedelin catastrophe or Nedelin disaster, known in Russia as the Catastrophe at Baikonur Cosmodrome (), was a launch pad accident that occurred on 24 October 1960 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Soviet Kazakhstan. As a prototype of the R-16 intercontinental ballistic missile was being prepared for a test flight, an explosion occurred when the second stage engine ignited accidentally, killing an unknown number of military and technical personnel working on the preparations. Despite the magnitude of the disaster, information was suppressed for many years and the Soviet government did not acknowledge the event until 1989. With more than 54 recognized casualties, it is the deadliest disaster in space exploration history. The catastrophe is named for the Chief Marshal of Artillery Mitrofan Ivanovich Nedelin, who was the head of the R-16 development program and perished in the explosion.

== Launch preparations ==
On 23 October 1960, the prototype R-16 intercontinental ballistic missile had been installed on launching pad 41 () awaiting final tests before launch. The missile was over long, in diameter and had a launch weight of 141 tons. The rocket was fueled with the hypergolic pair of UDMH as fuel and a saturated solution of  in nitric acid as the oxidizer—nicknamed &quot;Devil&#x27;s venom&quot;—which was used because of the high boiling temperatures and hence storability of the fuel and oxidizer, despite being extremely corrosive and toxic. These risks were accounted for in the safety requirements of the launch procedures, but Nedelin&#x27;s insistence on achieving a test launch ahead of the 7 November 1960 anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution resulted in extreme schedule pressure, in a context of substantial emerging engineering difficulties. Ultimately pre-launch tests began to overlap with launch preparations.

== Accident ==
A short circuit in the replaced main sequencer caused the second-stage engine to fire while being tested before launch. This detonated the first stage fuel tanks directly below, causing an explosion which destroyed the missile. Before seeking refuge, the camera operator remotely activated automatic cameras set around the launching pad that filmed the explosion in detail. 

People near the rocket were instantly incinerated; those farther away were burned to death or poisoned by the toxic fuel component vapors. Andrei Sakharov described many details: as soon as the engine fired, most of the personnel there ran to the perimeter, but were trapped inside the security fence and then engulfed in the fireball of burning fuel. The explosion incinerated or asphyxiated Nedelin, a top aide, the USSR&#x27;s top missile-guidance designer, and over 70 other officers and engineers. Still others died later of burns or poisoning. Missile designer Mikhail Yangel survived only because he had left to smoke a cigarette behind a bunker a few hundred metres away, but nonetheless suffered burn injuries.

===Casualties===
The exact death toll of the explosion is not known. The first Western reporting of the accident via the Italian Continentale News Agency in December 1960 said that 100 people were killed, while &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported in 1965, citing information from spy Oleg Penkovsky who had passed information to the West, that as many as 300 had died. The Soviet Union said only that a &quot;significant number&quot; had died when it first acknowledged the incident in a 1989 &quot;Ogoniok&quot; article, but later in the year, the government put the number of dead at 54. The most recent estimated death toll, released by Roscosmos on the 50th anniversary of the accident and originating with agency engineer Boris Chertok, was that 126 people had died, but the agency qualified the number by saying that the actual number could be anywhere from 60 to 150 dead.

== Aftermath ==
Complete secrecy was immediately imposed on the events of 24 October 1960 by Nikita Khrushchev. A news release stated that Nedelin had died in a plane crash and the families of the other engineers were advised to say their loved ones had died of the same cause. Khrushchev also ordered Leonid Brezhnev to head an investigation commission and go to the site. Among other things, the commission found that many more people were present on the launch pad than should have been—most were supposed to be safely offsite in bunkers.

When Brezhnev arrived at the firing range on 25 October 1960, he said: &quot;Comrades! We do not intend to put anyone on trial; we are going to investigate the causes and take actions to recover from the disaster and continue operations&quot;. Despite this, I. A. Doroshenko was held accountable for the event.

Afterwards, when Nikita Khrushchev asked Yangel, &quot;But why have you remained alive?&quot;, Yangel answered in a trembling voice, &quot;Walked away for a smoke. It&#x27;s all my fault&quot;. Yangel later suffered a heart attack and was off work for months.

After the committee presented its report, the R-16 program resumed in January 1961 with first successful flight on 2 February 1961. The delay to the R-16 spurred the USSR toward the development of more effective ICBMs and sparked Khrushchev&#x27;s decision to install intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBMs) in Cuba. Before the disaster Yangel had ambitions to challenge Sergei Korolev as leader of the Manned Space program, but he was directed to focus on the R-16.

A memorial to the victims of the test was erected in the first half of the 1960s in the Park of Baikonur and is still visited by RKA officials before any manned launch.

Another fatal accident, with the R-9 missile, occurred at Baikonur exactly three years after the Nedelin catastrophe, causing 24 October to be referred to as Baikonur&#x27;s &quot;Black Day.&quot; No launches have been attempted on that date at Baikonur ever since.

== Official acknowledgment ==
A news release stated that Nedelin had died &quot;in a plane crash while on an undisclosed mission&quot;. The Italian news agency Continentale first reported on 8 December 1960, from undisclosed sources, that Marshal Nedelin and 100 people had been killed in a rocket explosion. &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported on 16 October 1965 that captured spy Oleg Penkovsky had confirmed details of the missile accident, and exiled scientist and Soviet dissident Zhores Medvedev provided further details in 1976 in the British weekly magazine &quot;New Scientist&quot;. However, it was not until 16 April 1989 that the Soviet Union acknowledged the events, with a report appearing in the weekly newsmagazine &quot;Ogoniok&quot;.

<text>The Book of Enoch (also 1 Enoch;
Hebrew: סֵפֶר חֲנוֹךְ, &quot;Sēfer Ḥănōḵ&quot;; , ) is an ancient Jewish apocalyptic religious text, ascribed by tradition to the patriarch Enoch who was the father of Methuselah and the great-grandfather of Noah. The Book of Enoch contains unique material on the origins of demons and Nephilim, why some angels fell from heaven, an explanation of why the Genesis flood was morally necessary, and a prophetic exposition of the thousand-year reign of the Messiah. Three books are traditionally attributed to Enoch, including the distinct works 2 Enoch and 3 Enoch. 

1 Enoch is not considered to be canonical scripture by most Jewish or Christian church bodies, although it is part of the biblical canon used by the Ethiopian Jewish community Beta Israel, as well as the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church. 

The older sections of 1 Enoch are estimated to date from about 300–200 BCE, and the latest part (Book of Parables) is probably from around 100 BCE. Scholars believe Enoch was originally written in either Aramaic or Hebrew, the languages first used for Jewish texts. Ephraim Isaac suggests that the Book of Enoch, like the Book of Daniel, was composed partially in Aramaic and partially in Hebrew. No Hebrew version is known to have survived. Copies of the earlier sections of 1 Enoch were preserved in Aramaic among the Dead Sea Scrolls in the Qumran Caves.

Authors of the New Testament were also familiar with some content of the book. A short section of 1 Enoch is cited in the New Testament Epistle of Jude, , and attributed there to &quot;Enoch the Seventh from Adam&quot; (1 Enoch 60:8), although this section of 1 Enoch is a midrash on , which was written long after the supposed time of Enoch. The full Book of Enoch only survives in its entirety in Ge&#x27;ez (Ethiopic) translation. 

==Canonicity==
===Judaism===
Judging by the number of copies found in the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Book of Enoch was widely read during the Second Temple period. Today, the Ethiopic Beta Israel community of Haymanot Jews is the only Jewish group that accepts the Book of Enoch as canonical and still preserves it in its liturgical language of Geʽez, where it plays a central role in worship. Except for this community, the Book of Enoch was excluded from both the formal canon of the Tanakh and the Septuagint and therefore, also from the writings known today as the Deuterocanon.

The main reason for Jewish rejection of the book is that it is inconsistent with the teachings of the Torah. From the standpoint of Rabbinic Judaism, the book is considered to be heretical. For example, in the angel Phanuel presides over those who repent of sin and are granted eternal life. Some claim that this refers to Jesus Christ, as &quot;Phanuel&quot; translates to &quot;the Face of God&quot;.

Another reason for the exclusion of the texts might be the textual nature of several early sections of the book that make use of material from the Torah; for example, 1 En 1 is a midrash of Deuteronomy 33.
The content, particularly detailed descriptions of fallen angels, would also be a reason for rejection from the Hebrew canon at this period, as is illustrated by the comments of Trypho the Jew when debating with Justin Martyr on this subject: &quot;The utterances of God are holy, but your expositions are mere contrivances, as is plain from what has been explained by you; nay, even blasphemies, for you assert that angels sinned and revolted from God.&quot;
===Christianity===
By the fifth century, the Book of Enoch was mostly excluded from Christian biblical canons and it is now regarded as scripture only by the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church and the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church.

====References in the New Testament====
&quot;Enoch, the seventh from Adam&quot; is quoted in :
: And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints, To execute judgment upon all, and to convict all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.

Compare this with Enoch 1:9, translated from the Ethiopic (found also in Qumran scroll 4Q204=4QEnochc ar, col I 16–18):
:And behold! He cometh with ten thousands of His Saints to execute judgment upon all, and to destroy all the ungodly: And to convict all flesh of all the works of their ungodliness which they have ungodly committed, and of all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against Him.

Compare this also with what may be the original source of in Deuteronomy 33:2: In &quot;He cometh with ten thousands of His holy ones&quot; the text reproduces the Masoretic of Deuteronomy 33 in reading = , whereas the three Targums, the Syriac and Vulgate read , = . Here the Septuagint diverges wholly. The reading is recognized as original. The writer of 1–5 therefore used the Hebrew text and presumably wrote in Hebrew.
Under the heading of canonicity, it is not enough to merely demonstrate that something is quoted. Instead, it is necessary to demonstrate the nature of the quotation.

In the case of the Jude 1:14 quotation of it would be difficult to argue that Jude does not quote Enoch as a historical prophet, since he cites Enoch by name. However, there remains a question as to whether the author of Jude attributed the quotation believing the source to be the historical Enoch before the flood, or as a midrash of Deut 33:2–3. The Greek text might seem unusual in stating that &quot;Enoch the Seventh from Adam&quot; prophesied &quot;to&quot; (dative case) not &quot;of&quot; (genitive case) the men. However this Greek grammar might indicate the meaning &quot;against them&quot; – the dative as a dative of disadvantage (&quot;dativus incommodi&quot;).

Davids (2006) points to Dead Sea Scrolls evidence but leaves it open as to whether Jude viewed 1 Enoch as canon, deuterocanon, or otherwise: &quot;Did Jude, then, consider this scripture to be like Genesis or Isaiah? Certainly he did consider it authoritative, a true word from God. We cannot tell whether he ranked it alongside other prophetic books such as Isaiah and Jeremiah. What we do know is, first, that other Jewish groups, most notably those living in Qumran near the Dead Sea, also used and valued 1 Enoch, but we do not find it grouped with the scriptural scrolls.&quot;

The attribution &quot;Enoch the Seventh from Adam&quot; is apparently itself a section heading taken from 1 Enoch ( Jude 1:14a) and not from Genesis.

Enoch is referred to directly in the Epistle to the Hebrews. The epistle mentions that Enoch received testimony from God before his translation,() which may be a reference to 1 Enoch.

It has also been alleged that the First Epistle of Peter () and the Second Epistle of Peter () make reference to some Enochian material.

====Reception====

The Book of Enoch was considered as scripture in the Epistle of Barnabas (4:3) and by some of the early Church Fathers, such as Athenagoras, Clement of Alexandria, and Tertullian, who wrote c. 200 that the Book of Enoch had been rejected by the Jews because it purportedly contained prophecies pertaining to Christ.

===Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints does not consider 1 Enoch to be part of its standard canon, although it believes that a purported &quot;original&quot; Book of Enoch was an inspired book. The Mormon Book of Moses, first published in the 1830s, is part of the standard works of the Church, and has a section which claims to contain extracts from the &quot;original&quot; Book of Enoch. This section has many similarities to 1 Enoch and other Enoch texts, including 2 Enoch, 3 Enoch, and &quot;The Book of Giants&quot;.
The Enoch section of the Book of Moses is believed by the Church to contain extracts from &quot;the ministry, teachings, and visions of Enoch&quot;, though it does not contain the entire Book of Enoch itself. The Church considers the portions of the other texts which match its Enoch excerpts to be inspired, while not rejecting but withholding judgment on the remainder.

==Manuscript tradition==
===Ethiopic===
The most extensive surviving early manuscripts of the Book of Enoch exist in the Ge&#x27;ez language. Robert Henry Charles&#x27;s critical edition of 1906 subdivides the Ethiopic manuscripts into two families:

Family : thought to be more ancient and more similar to the earlier Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek versions:
* A – ms. orient. 485 of the British Museum, 16th century, with Jubilees
* B – ms. orient. 491 of the British Museum, 18th century, with other biblical writings
* C – ms. of Berlin orient. Petermann II Nachtrag 29, 16th century
* D – ms. abbadiano 35, 17th century
* E – ms. abbadiano 55, 16th century
* F – ms. 9 of the Lago Lair, 15th century

Family : more recent, apparently edited texts
* G – ms. 23 of the John Rylands University Library of Manchester, 18th century
* H – ms. orient. 531 of the Bodleian Library of Oxford, 18th century
* I – ms. Brace 74 of the Bodleian Library of Oxford, 16th century
* J – ms. orient. 8822 of the British Museum, 18th century
* K – ms. property of E. Ullendorff of London, 18th century
* L – ms. abbadiano 99, 19th century
* M – ms. orient. 492 of the British Museum, 18th century
* N – ms. Ethiopian 30 of Munich, 18th century
* O – ms. orient. 484 of the British Museum, 18th century
* P – ms. Ethiopian 71 of the Vatican, 18th century
* Q – ms. orient. 486 of the British Museum, 18th century, lacking chapters 1–60

Additionally, there are the manuscripts used by the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church for preparation of the deuterocanonicals from Ge&#x27;ez into the targumic Amharic in the bilingual Haile Selassie Amharic Bible (&quot;Mashaf qeddus bage&#x27;ezenna ba&#x27;amaregna yatasafe&quot; 4 vols. ).

===Aramaic===
Eleven Aramaic-language fragments of the Book of Enoch were found in cave 4 of Qumran in 1948 and are in the care of the Israel Antiquities Authority. They were translated for and discussed by Józef Milik and Matthew Black in &quot;The Books of Enoch&quot;. Another translation has been released by Vermes and Garcia-Martinez. Milik described the documents as being white or cream in color, blackened in areas, and made of leather that was smooth, thick and stiff. It was also partly damaged, with the ink blurred and faint.

===Greek===

The 8th-century work &quot;Chronographia Universalis&quot; by the Byzantine historian George Syncellus preserved some passages of the Book of Enoch in Greek (6:1–9:4, 15:8–16:1). Other Greek fragments known are:
* Codex Panopolitanus (Cairo Papyrus 10759), named also &quot;Codex Gizeh&quot; or Akhmim fragments, consists of fragments of two 6th-century papyri containing portions of chapters 1–32 recovered by a French archeological team at Akhmim in Egypt and published five years later, in 1892.

According to Elena Dugan, this Codex was written by two separate scribes and was previously misunderstood as containing errors. She suggests that the first scribe actually preserves a valuable text that is not erroneous. In fact the text preserves &quot;a thoughtful composition, corresponding to the progression of Enoch&#x27;s life and culminating in an ascent to heaven&quot;. The first scribe may have been working earlier, and was possibly unconnected to the second.

* Vatican Fragments, f. 216v (11th century): including 89:42–49
* Chester Beatty Papyri XII : including 97:6–107:3 (less chapter 105)
* Oxyrhynchus Papyri 2069: including only a few letters, which made the identification uncertain, from 77:7–78:1, 78:1–3, 78:8, 85:10–86:2, 87:1–3
It has been claimed that several small additional fragments in Greek have been found at Qumran (7QEnoch: 7Q4, 7Q8, 7Q10-13), dating about 100 BCE, ranging from 98:11? to 103:15 and written on papyrus with grid lines, but this identification is highly contested.

Portions of 1 Enoch were incorporated into the chronicle of Panodoros () and thence borrowed by his contemporary Annianos.

===Coptic===
A sixth- or seventh-century fragmentary manuscript contains a Coptic version of the Apocalypse of Weeks. How extensive the Coptic text originally was cannot be known. It agrees with the Aramaic text against the Ethiopic, but was probably derived from Greek.

===Latin===
Of the Latin translation, only 1:9 and 106:1–18 are known. The first passage occurs in the Pseudo-Cyprianic &quot;Ad Novatianum&quot; and the Pseudo-Vigilian &quot;Contra Varimadum&quot;; the second was discovered in 1893 by M. R. James in an 8th-century manuscript in the British Museum and published in the same year.

===Syriac===
The only surviving example of &quot;1 Enoch&quot; in Syriac is found in the 12th century &quot;Chronicle&quot; of Michael the Great. It is a passage from Book VI and is also known from Syncellus and papyrus. Michael&#x27;s source appears to have been a Syriac translation of (part of) the chronicle of Annianos.

==History==
===Origins===
Ephraim Isaac, the editor and translator of 1 Enoch in &quot;The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha&quot;, writes that &quot;1 Enoch is clearly composite representing numerous periods and writers&quot;. And that the dating of the various sections spans from early pre-Maccabean (i.e. ) to 160 CE. George W. E. Nickelsburg writes that &quot;1 Enoch is a collection of Jewish apocalyptic traditions that date from the last three centuries before the common era&quot;.

===Second Temple period===
Paleographic analysis of the Enochic fragments found in the Qumran caves dates the oldest fragments of the Book of the Watchers to 200–150 BCE. Since this work shows evidence of multiple stages of composition, it is probable that this work was already extant in the 3rd century BCE. The same can be said about the Astronomical Book.

Because of these findings, it was no longer possible to claim that the core of the Book of Enoch was composed in the wake of the Maccabean Revolt as a reaction to Hellenization. Scholars thus had to look for the origins of the Qumranic sections of 1 Enoch in the previous historical period, and the comparison with traditional material of such a time showed that these sections do not draw exclusively on categories and ideas prominent in the Hebrew Bible. David Jackson speaks even of an &quot;Enochic Judaism&quot; from which the writers of Qumran scrolls were descended. Margaret Barker argues, &quot;Enoch is the writing of a very conservative group whose roots go right back to the time of the First Temple&quot;. The main peculiar aspects of this Enochic Judaism include:
* the idea that evil and impurity on Earth originated as a result of angels that had intercourse with human women and were subsequently expelled from Heaven;
* the absence of references to terms of the Mosaic covenant (such as the observance of Shabbat or the rite of circumcision), as found in the Torah;
* the concept of &quot;End of Days&quot; as the time of final judgment that takes the place of promised earthly rewards;
* the rejection of the Second Temple&#x27;s sacrifices considered impure: according to Enoch 89:73, the Jews, when returned from the exile, &quot;reared up that tower (the temple) and they began again to place a table before the tower, but all the bread on it was polluted and not pure&quot;;
* the presentation of heaven in 1 Enoch 1–36, not in terms of the Jerusalem temple and its priests, but modelling God and his angels as a court, with its king and courtiers;
* a solar calendar in opposition to the lunar calendar used in the Second Temple (a very important aspect for the determination of the dates of religious feasts);
* an interest in the angelic world that involves life after death.
Most Qumran fragments are relatively early, with none written from the last period of the Qumranic experience.

The relation between 1 Enoch and the Essenes was noted even before the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls. While there is consensus to consider the sections of the Book of Enoch found in Qumran as texts used by the Essenes, the same is not so clear for the Enochic texts not found in Qumran (mainly the Book of Parables): it was proposed to consider these parts as expression of the mainstream, but not-Qumranic, essenic movement. The main peculiar aspects of the not-Qumranic units of 1 Enoch are the following:
* a Messiah called &quot;Son of Man&quot;, with divine attributes, generated before the creation, who will act directly in the final judgment and sit on a throne of glory (1 Enoch 46:1–4, 48:2–7, 69:26–29)
* the sinners usually seen as the wealthy ones and the just as the oppressed (a theme we find also in the Psalms of Solomon).

===Early influence===
Classical rabbinic literature is characterized by near silence concerning Enoch. It is possible that rabbinic polemics against Enochic texts and traditions might have led to the fall from use of these books in Rabbinic Judaism.

However, the book of Enoch plays an important role in the history of Jewish mysticism: the scholar Gershom Scholem wrote, &quot;The main subjects of the later Merkabah mysticism already occupy a central position in the older esoteric literature, best represented by the &quot;Book of Enoch&quot;.&quot; Particular attention is paid to the detailed description of the throne of God included in chapter 14 of 1 Enoch.

For the quotation from the Book of the Watchers in the New Testament Epistle of Jude:
14 And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, &quot;Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousand of His saints

15 to execute judgment upon all, and to convince all who are ungodly among them of all their godless deeds which they have godlessly committed, and of all the harsh speeches which godless sinners have spoken against Him.&quot;

There is little doubt that 1 Enoch was influential in molding New Testament doctrines about the Messiah, the Son of Man, the messianic kingdom, demonology, the resurrection, and eschatology. The limits of the influence of 1 Enoch are discussed at length by R.H. Charles, Ephraim Isaac, and G.W. Nickelsburg in their respective translations and commentaries. It is possible that the earlier sections of 1 Enoch had direct textual and content influence on many Biblical apocrypha, such as Jubilees, 2 Baruch, 2 Esdras, Apocalypse of Abraham and 2 Enoch, though even in these cases, the connection is typically more branches of a common trunk than direct development.

The Greek text was known to, and quoted, both positively and negatively, by many Church Fathers: references can be found in Justin Martyr, Minucius Felix, Irenaeus, Origen, Cyprian, Hippolytus, Commodianus, Lactantius and Cassian. After Cassian and before the modern &quot;rediscovery&quot;, some excerpts are given in the Byzantine Empire by the 8th-century monk George Syncellus in his chronography, and in the 9th century, it is listed as an apocryphon of the New Testament by Patriarch Nicephorus.

===Rediscovery===
Sir Walter Raleigh, in his &quot;History of the World&quot; (written in 1616 while imprisoned in the Tower of London), makes the curious assertion that part of the Book of Enoch &quot;which contained the course of the stars, their names and motions&quot; had been discovered in Saba (Sheba) in the first century and was thus available to Origen and Tertullian. He attributes this information to Origen,
although no such statement is found anywhere in extant versions of Origen.

Outside of Ethiopia, the text of the Book of Enoch was considered lost until the beginning of the seventeenth century, when it was confidently asserted that the book was found in an Ethiopic (Ge&#x27;ez) language translation there, and Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc bought a book that was claimed to be identical to the one quoted by the Epistle of Jude and the Church Fathers. Hiob Ludolf, the great Ethiopic scholar of the 17th and 18th centuries, soon claimed it to be a forgery produced by Abba Bahaila Michael.

Better success was achieved by the famous Scottish traveller James Bruce, who, in 1773, returned to Europe from six years in Abyssinia with three copies of a Ge&#x27;ez version. One is preserved in the Bodleian Library, another was presented to the royal library of France, while the third was kept by Bruce. The copies remained unused until the 19th century; Silvestre de Sacy, in &quot;Notices sur le livre d&#x27;Enoch&quot;, included extracts of the books with Latin translations (Enoch chapters 1, 2, 5–16, 22, and 32). From this a German translation was made by Rink in 1801.

The first English translation of the Bodleian / Ethiopic manuscript was published in 1821 by Richard Laurence. Revised editions appeared in 1833, 1838, and 1842.

In 1838, Laurence also released the first Ethiopic text of 1 Enoch published in the West, under the title: &quot;Libri Enoch Prophetae Versio Aethiopica&quot;. The text, divided into 105 chapters, was soon considered unreliable as it was the transcription of a single Ethiopic manuscript.

In 1833, Professor Andreas Gottlieb Hoffmann of the University of Jena released a German translation, based on Laurence&#x27;s work, called &quot;Das Buch Henoch in vollständiger Uebersetzung, mit fortlaufendem Kommentar, ausführlicher Einleitung und erläuternden Excursen&quot;. Two other translations came out around the same time: one in 1836 called &quot;Enoch Restitutus, or an Attempt&quot; (Rev. Edward Murray) and one in 1840 called &quot;Prophetae veteres Pseudepigraphi, partim ex Abyssinico vel Hebraico sermonibus Latine bersi&quot; (A. F. Gfrörer). However, both are considered to be poor—the 1836 translation most of all—and is discussed in Hoffmann.

The first critical edition, based on five manuscripts, appeared in 1851 as &quot;Liber Henoch, Aethiopice, ad quinque codicum fidem editus, cum variis lectionibus&quot;, by August Dillmann. It was followed in 1853 by a German translation of the book by the same author with commentary titled &quot;Das Buch Henoch, übersetzt und erklärt&quot;. It was considered the standard edition of 1 Enoch until the work of Charles.

The generation of Enoch scholarship from 1890 to World War I was dominated by Robert Henry Charles. His 1893 translation and commentary of the Ethiopic text already represented an important advancement, as it was based on ten additional manuscripts. In 1906 R.H. Charles published a new critical edition of the Ethiopic text, using 23 Ethiopic manuscripts and all available sources at his time. The English translation of the reconstructed text appeared in 1912, and the same year in his collection of &quot;The Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha of the Old Testament&quot;.

The publication, in the early 1950s, of the first Aramaic fragments of 1 Enoch among the Dead Sea Scrolls profoundly changed the study of the document, as it provided evidence of its antiquity and original text. The official edition of all Enoch fragments appeared in 1976, by Jozef Milik.

The renewed interest in 1 Enoch spawned a number of other translations: in Hebrew (A. Kahana, 1956), Danish (Hammershaimb, 1956), Italian (Fusella, 1981), Spanish (1982), French (Caquot, 1984) and other modern languages. In 1978 a new edition of the Ethiopic text was edited by Michael Knibb, with an English translation, while a new commentary appeared in 1985 by Matthew Black.

In 2001 George W.E. Nickelsburg published the first volume of a comprehensive commentary on 1 Enoch in the Hermeneia series. Since the year 2000, the Enoch seminar has devoted several meetings to the Enoch literature and has become the center of a lively debate concerning the hypothesis that the Enoch literature attests the presence of an autonomous non-Mosaic tradition of dissent in Second Temple Judaism.

==Synopsis==
The first part of the Book of Enoch describes the fall of the Watchers, the angels who fathered the angel-human hybrids called Nephilim. The remainder of the book describes Enoch&#x27;s revelations and his visits to heaven in the form of travels, visions, and dreams.

The book consists of five quite distinct major sections (see each section for details):
# The Book of the Watchers (1 Enoch 1–36)
# The Book of Parables of Enoch (1 Enoch 37–71) (also called the Similitudes of Enoch)
# The Astronomical Book (1 Enoch 72–82) (also called the Book of the Heavenly Luminaries or Book of Luminaries)
# The Book of Dream Visions (1 Enoch 83–90) (also called the Book of Dreams)
# The Epistle of Enoch (1 Enoch 91–108)

Most scholars believe that these five sections were originally independent works (with different dates of composition), themselves a product of much editorial arrangement, and were only later redacted into what is now called 1 Enoch.

===The Book of the Watchers===
This first section of the Book of Enoch describes the fall of the Watchers, the angels who fathered the Nephilim (cf. the &quot;bene Elohim&quot;, ) and narrates the travels of Enoch in the heavens. This section is said to have been composed in the 4th or 3rd century BCE according to Western scholars.

====Description====
The introduction to the book of Enoch tells us that Enoch is &quot;a righteous man, whose eyes were opened by God, saw the vision of the Holy One in the heavens, which the angels showed me, and from them I heard everything, and from them I understood as I saw, but not for this generation, but for a remote one which is for to come&quot;

It discusses God coming to Earth on Mount Sinai with His hosts to pass judgment on mankind. It also tells us about the luminaries rising and setting in the order and in their own time and never change:

&quot;Observe and see how (in the winter) all the trees seem as though they had withered and shed all their leaves, except fourteen trees, which do not lose their foliage but retain the old foliage from two to three years till the new comes.&quot;

The book also discusses how all things are ordained by God and take place in his own time. The sinners shall perish and the great and the good shall live on in light, joy and peace.
And all His works go on thus from year to year for ever, and all the tasks which they accomplish for Him, and their tasks change not, but according as God hath ordained so is it done.

The first section of the book depicts the interaction of the fallen angels with mankind; Sêmîazâz compels the other 199 fallen angels to take human wives to &quot;beget us children&quot;.
And Semjâzâ, who was their leader, said unto them: &quot;I fear ye will not indeed agree to do this deed, and I alone shall have to pay the penalty of a great sin.&quot; And they all answered him and said: &quot;Let us all swear an oath, and all bind ourselves by mutual imprecations not to abandon this plan but to do this thing.&quot; Then swore they all together and bound themselves by mutual imprecations upon it. And they were in all two hundred; who descended in the days of Jared on the summit of Mount Hermon, and they called it Mount Hermon, because they had sworn and bound themselves by mutual imprecations upon it.
The names of the leaders are given as &quot;Samyaza (Shemyazaz), their leader, Araqiel, Râmêêl, Kokabiel, Tamiel, Ramiel, Dânêl, Chazaqiel, Baraqiel, Asael, Armaros, Batariel, Bezaliel, Ananiel, Zaqiel, Shamsiel, Satariel, Turiel, Yomiel, Sariel.&quot;

This results in the creation of the Nephilim (Genesis) or Anakim / Anak (giants) as they are described in the book:
And they became pregnant, and they bare great giants, whose height was three hundred ells:
Who consumed all the acquisitions of men. And when men could no longer sustain them, the giants turned against them and devoured mankind. And they began to sin against birds, and beasts, and reptiles, and fish, and to devour one another&#x27;s flesh, and drink the blood.

It also discusses the teaching of humans by the fallen angels, chiefly Azâzêl:
And Azâzêl taught men to make swords, and knives, and shields, and breastplates, and made known to them the metals of the earth and the art of working them, and bracelets, and ornaments, and the use of antimony, and the beautifying of the eyelids, and all kinds of costly stones, and all colouring tinctures. And there arose much godlessness, and they committed fornication, and they were led astray, and became corrupt in all their ways. Semjâzâ taught enchantments, and root-cuttings, Armârôs the resolving of enchantments, Barâqîjâl, taught astrology, Kôkabêl the constellations, Ezêqêêl the knowledge of the clouds, Araqiêl the signs of the earth, Shamsiêl the signs of the sun, and Sariêl the course of the moon.

Michael, Uriel, Raphael, and Gabriel appeal to God to judge the inhabitants of the world and the fallen angels. Uriel is then sent by God to tell Noah of the coming cataclysm and what he needs to do.
Then said the Most High, the Holy and Great One spoke, and sent Uriel to the son of Lamech, and said to him: Go to Noah and tell him in my name &quot;Hide thyself!&quot; and reveal to him the end that is approaching: that the whole earth will be destroyed, and a deluge is about to come upon the whole earth, and will destroy all that is on it. And now instruct him that he may escape and his seed may be preserved for all the generations of the world.

God commands Raphael to imprison Azâzêl:
[T]he Lord said to Raphael: &quot;Bind Azâzêl hand and foot, and cast him into the darkness: And make an opening in the desert, which is in Dûdâêl (God&#x27;s kettle / crucible / cauldron), and cast him therein. And place upon him rough and jagged rocks, and cover him with darkness, and let him abide there for ever, and cover his face that he may not see light. And on the day of the great judgement he shall be cast into the fire. And heal the earth which the angels have corrupted, and proclaim the healing of the earth, that they may heal the plague, and that all the children of men may not perish through all the secret things that the Watchers have disclosed and have taught their sons. And the whole earth has been corrupted through the works that were taught by Azâzêl: To him ascribe all sin.&quot;

God gave Gabriel instructions concerning the Nephilim and the imprisonment of the fallen angels:
And to Gabriel said the Lord: &quot;Proceed against the biters and the reprobates, and against the children of fornication: and destroy [the children of fornication and] the children of the Watchers from amongst men [and cause them to go forth]: send them one against the other that they may destroy each other in battle ...&quot;

The Lord commands Michael to bind the fallen angels.
And the Lord said unto Michael: &quot;Go, bind Semjâzâ and his associates who have united themselves with women so as to have defiled themselves with them in all their uncleanness. 12. And when their sons have slain one another, and they have seen the destruction of their beloved ones, bind them fast for seventy generations in the valleys of the earth, till the day of their judgement and of their consummation, till the judgement that is for ever and ever is consummated. 13. In those days they shall be led off to the abyss of fire: (and) to the torment and the prison in which they shall be confined for ever. And whosoever shall be condemned and destroyed will from thenceforth be bound together with them to the end of all generations. ...&quot;

===Book of Parables===

Chapters 37–71 of the Book of Enoch are referred to as the &#x27;Book of Parables&#x27;. The scholarly debate centers on these chapters. The Book of Parables appears to be based on the Book of the Watchers, but presents a later development of the idea of final judgment and of eschatology, concerned not only with the destiny of the fallen angels but also that of the evil kings of the earth. The Book of Parables uses the expression &quot;The Son of Man&quot; for the eschatological protagonist, who is also called &quot;Righteous One&quot;, &quot;Chosen One&quot;, and &quot;Messiah&quot;, and sits on the throne of glory in the final judgment. The first known use of &quot;Son of Man&quot; as a definite title in Jewish writings is in 1 Enoch, and its use may have played a role in the early Christian understanding and use of the title.

It has been suggested that the Book of Parables, in its entirety, is a later addition. Pointing to similarities with the Sibylline Oracles and other earlier works, in 1976, J.T. Milik dated the Book of Parables to the third century. He believed that the events in the parables were linked to historic events dating from 260 to 270 CE. According to this theory, these chapters were written in later Christian times by a Jewish Christian, to enhance Christian beliefs with Enoch&#x27;s authoritative name. Knibb followed Milik&#x27;s reasoning, and suggested that because no fragments of chapters 37–71 were found at Qumran, a later date was likely. Knibb would continue this line of reasoning in later works. In addition to being missing from Qumran, Chapters 37–71 are also missing from the Greek translation. Currently no firm consensus has been reached among scholars as to the date of the writing of the Book of Parables. Milik&#x27;s date of as late as 270 CE, however, has been rejected by most scholars. David W. Suter suggests that there is a tendency to date the Book of Parables to between 50 BCE – 117 CE.

In 1893, R. Charles judged Chapter 71 to be a later addition. He later changed his opinion and gave an early date for the work between 94 and 64 BCE. The 1906 article by Emil G. Hirsch in the &quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; states that &quot;Son of Man&quot; is found in the Book of Enoch, but never in the original material. It occurs in the &quot;Noachian interpolations&quot; (lx. 10, lxxi. 14), in which it has clearly no other meaning than &#x27;man&#x27;. The author of the work mis-uses or corrupts the titles of the angels. Charles views the title &quot;Son of Man&quot;, as found in the Book of Parables, as referring to a supernatural person, a Messiah who is not of human descent. In that part of the Book of Enoch known as the Similitudes, it has the technical sense of a supernatural Messiah and judge of the world (xlvi. 2, xlviii. 2, lxx. 27); universal dominion and preexistence are predicated of him (xlviii. 2, lxvii. 6). He sits on God&#x27;s throne (xlv. 3, li. 3), which is his own throne. Though Charles does not admit it, according to Emil G. Hirsch these passages betray Christian redaction and emendation. Many scholars have suggested that passages in the Book of Parables are Noachian interpolations. These passages seem to interrupt the flow of the narrative. Darrell D. Hannah suggests that these passages are not, in total, novel interpolations, but rather derived from an earlier Noah apocryphon. He believes that some interpolations refer to Herod the Great and should be dated to around 4 BCE.

In addition to the theory of Noachian interpolations, which perhaps a majority of scholars support, most scholars currently believe that Chapters 70–71 are a later addition in part or in whole. Chapter 69 ends with, &quot;This is the third parable of Enoch.&quot; Like Elijah, Enoch is generally thought to have been brought up to Heaven by God while still alive, but some have suggested that the text refers to Enoch as having died a natural death and ascending to Heaven. The Son of Man is identified with Enoch. The text implies that Enoch had previously been enthroned in heaven. Chapters 70–71 seem to contradict passages earlier in the parable where the Son of Man is a separate entity. The parable also switches from third person singular to first person singular. James H. Charlesworth rejects the theory that chapters 70–71 are later additions. He believes that no additions were made to the Book of Parables. In his earlier work, the implication is that a majority of scholars agreed with him.

===The Astronomical Book===

Four fragmentary editions of the Astronomical Book were found at Qumran, 4Q208-211. 4Q208 and 4Q209 have been dated to the beginning of the 2nd century BCE, providing a &quot;terminus ante quem&quot; for the Astronomical Book of the 3rd century BCE. The fragments found in Qumran also include material not contained in the later versions of the Book of Enoch.

This book contains descriptions of the movement of heavenly bodies and of the firmament, as a knowledge revealed to Enoch in his trips to Heaven guided by Uriel, and it describes a Solar calendar that was later described also in the Book of Jubilees which was used by the Dead Sea sect. The use of this calendar made it impossible to celebrate the festivals simultaneously with the Temple of Jerusalem.

The year was composed from 364 days, divided in four equal seasons of ninety-one days each. Each season was composed of three equal months of thirty days, plus an extra day at the end of the third month. The whole year was thus composed of exactly fifty-two weeks, and every calendar day occurred always on the same day of the week. Each year and each season started always on Wednesday, which was the fourth day of the creation narrated in Genesis, the day when the lights in the sky, the seasons, the days and the years were created. It is not known how they used to reconcile this calendar with the tropical year of 365.24 days (at least seven suggestions have been made), and it is not even sure if they felt the need to adjust it.

===Animal Apocalypse===
The second dream vision in this section of the Book of Enoch is an allegorical account of the history of Israel, that uses animals to represent human beings and human beings to represent angels.

One of several hypothetical reconstructions of the meanings in the dream is as follows based on the works of R. H. Charles and G. H. Schodde:

====Description====

There are a great many links between the first book and this one, including the outline of the story and the imprisonment of the leaders and destruction of the Nephilim. The dream includes sections relating to the Book of the Watchers:
And those seventy shepherds were judged and found guilty, and they were cast into that fiery abyss. And I saw at that time how a like abyss was opened in the midst of the earth, full of fire, and they brought those blinded sheep. (The fall of the evil ones)

And all the oxen feared them and were affrighted at them, and began to bite with their teeth and to devour, and to gore with their horns. And they began, moreover, to devour those oxen; and behold all the children of the earth began to tremble and quake before them and to flee from them. (The creation of the Nephilim et al.)

86:4, 87:3, 88:2, and 89:6 all describe the types of Nephilim that are created during the times described in The Book of the Watchers, though this doesn&#x27;t mean that the authors of both books are the same. Similar references exist in Jubilees 7:21–22.

The book describes their release from the Ark along with three bulls – white, red, and black, which are Shem, Ham, and Japheth – in 89:9. It also covers the death of Noah, described as the white bull, and the creation of many nations:

And they began to bring forth beasts of the field and birds, so that there arose different genera: lions, tigers, wolves, dogs, hyenas, wild boars, foxes, squirrels, swine, falcons, vultures, kites, eagles, and ravens (89:10)

It then describes the story of Moses and Aaron (89:13–15), including the miracle of the river splitting in two for them to pass, and the creation of the stone commandments. Eventually they arrived at a &quot;pleasant and glorious land&quot; (89:40) where they were attacked by dogs (Philistines), foxes (Ammonites, Moabites), and wild boars (Esau).
And that sheep whose eyes were opened saw that ram, which was amongst the sheep, till it forsook its glory and began to butt those sheep, and trampled upon them, and behaved itself unseemly. And the Lord of the sheep sent the lamb to another lamb and raised it to being a ram and leader of the sheep instead of that ram which had forsaken its glory. (David replacing Saul as leader of Israel)

It describes the creation of Solomon&#x27;s Temple and also the house which may be the tabernacle: &quot;And that house became great and broad, and it was built for those sheep: (and) a tower lofty and great was built on the house for the Lord of the sheep, and that house was low, but the tower was elevated and lofty, and the Lord of the sheep stood on that tower and they offered a full table before Him&quot;. This interpretation is accepted by Dillmann (p. 262), Vernes (p. 89), and Schodde (p. 107). It also describes the escape of Elijah the prophet; in 1 Kings 17:2–24, he is fed by &quot;ravens&quot;, so if Kings uses a similar analogy, he may have been fed by the Seleucids. &quot;... saw the Lord of the sheep how He wrought much slaughter amongst them in their herds until those sheep invited that slaughter and betrayed His place.&quot; This describes the various tribes of Israel &quot;inviting&quot; in other nations &quot;betraying his place&quot; (i.e., the land promised to their ancestors by God).

This part of the book can be taken to be the kingdom splitting into the northern and southern tribes, that is, Israel and Judah, eventually leading to Israel falling to the Assyrians in 721 BCE and Judah falling to the Babylonians a little over a century later 587 BCE. &quot;And He gave them over into the hands of the lions and tigers, and wolves and hyenas, and into the hand of the foxes, and to all the wild beasts, and those wild beasts began to tear in pieces those sheep&quot;; God abandons Israel for they have forsaken him.

There is also mention of 59 of 70 shepherds with their own seasons; there seems to be some debate on the meaning of this section, some suggesting that it is a reference to the 70 appointed times in 25:11, 9:2, and 1:12. Another interpretation is the 70 weeks in . However, the general interpretation is that these are simply angels. This section of the book and another section near the end describe the appointment by God of the 70 angels to protect the Israelites from enduring too much harm from the &quot;beasts and birds&quot;. The later section (110:14) describes how the 70 angels are judged for causing more harm to Israel than he desired, found guilty, and &quot;cast into an abyss, full of fire and flaming, and full of pillars of fire.&quot;

&quot;And the lions and tigers eat and devoured the greater part of those sheep, and the wild boars eat along with them; and they burnt that tower and demolished that house&quot;; this represents the sacking of Solomon&#x27;s temple and the tabernacle in Jerusalem by the Babylonians as they take Judah in 587–586 BCE, exiling the remaining Jews. &quot;And forthwith I saw how the shepherds pastured for twelve hours, and behold three of those sheep turned back and came and entered and began to build up all that had fallen down of that house&quot;. &quot;Cyrus allowed Sheshbazzar, a prince from the tribe of Judah, to bring the Jews from Babylon back to Jerusalem. Jews were allowed to return with the Temple vessels that the Babylonians had taken. Construction of the Second Temple began&quot;; this represents the history of ancient Israel and Judah; the temple was completed in 515 BCE.

The first part of the next section of the book seems, according to Western scholars, to clearly describe the Maccabean revolt of 167 BCE against the Seleucids.
The following two quotes have been altered from their original form to make the hypothetical meanings of the animal names clear.
And I saw in the vision how the (Seleucids) flew upon those (faithful) and took one of those lambs, and dashed the sheep in pieces and devoured them. And I saw till horns grew upon those lambs, and the (Seleucids) cast down their horns; and I saw till there sprouted a great horn of one of those (faithful), and their eyes were opened. And it looked at them and their eyes opened, and it cried to the sheep, and the rams saw it and all ran to it. And notwithstanding all this those (Macedonians) and vultures and (Seleucids) and (Ptolemies) still kept tearing the sheep and swooping down upon them and devouring them: still the sheep remained silent, but the rams lamented and cried out. And those (Seleucids) fought and battled with it and sought to lay low its horn, but they had no power over it. (109:8–12)

All the (Macedonians) and vultures and (Seleucids) and (Ptolemies) were gathered together, and there came with them all the sheep of the field, yea, they all came together, and helped each other to break that horn of the ram. (110:16)

According to this theory, the first sentence most likely refers to the death of High Priest Onias III, whose murder is described in (died c. 171 BCE). The &quot;great horn&quot; clearly is not Mattathias, the initiator of the rebellion, as he dies a natural death, described in . It is also not Alexander the Great, as the great horn is interpreted as a warrior who has fought the Macedonians, Seleucids, and Ptolemies. Judas Maccabeus (167 - 160 BCE) fought all three of these, with a large number of victories against the Seleucids over a great period of time; &quot;they had no power over it&quot;. He is also described as &quot;one great horn among six others on the head of a lamb&quot;, possibly referring to Maccabeus&#x27;s five brothers and Mattathias. If taken in context of the history from Maccabeus&#x27;s time, Dillman Chrest Aethiop says the explanation of Verse 13 can be found in 1 Maccabees iii 7; vi. 52; v.; 2 Maccabees vi. 8 sqq., 13, 14; 1 Maccabees vii 41, 42; and 2 Maccabees x v, 8 sqq. Maccabeus was eventually killed by the Seleucids at the Battle of Elasa, where he faced &quot;twenty thousand foot soldiers and two thousand cavalry&quot;. At one time, it was believed this passage might refer to John Hyrcanus; the only reason for this was that the time between Alexander the Great and John Maccabeus was too short. However, it has been asserted that evidence shows that this section does indeed discuss Maccabeus.

It then describes: &quot;And I saw till a great sword was given to the sheep, and the sheep proceeded against all the beasts of the field to slay them, and all the beasts and the birds of the heaven fled before their face.&quot;
This might be simply the &quot;power of God&quot;: God was with them to avenge the death. It may also be Jonathan Apphus taking over command of the rebels to battle on after the death of Judas. John Hyrcanus (Hyrcanus I, Hasmonean dynasty) may also make an appearance; the passage &quot;And all that had been destroyed and dispersed, and all the beasts of the field, and all the birds of the heaven, assembled in that house, and the Lord of the sheep rejoiced with great joy because they were all good and had returned to His house&quot; may describe John&#x27;s reign as a time of great peace and prosperity. Certain scholars also claim Alexander Jannaeus of Judaea is alluded to in this book.

The end of the book describes the new Jerusalem, culminating in the birth of a Messiah:
And I saw that a white bull was born, with large horns and all the beasts of the field and all the birds of the air feared him and made petition to him all the time. And I saw till all their generations were transformed, and they all became white bulls; and the first among them became a lamb, and that lamb became a great animal and had great black horns on its head; and the Lord of the sheep rejoiced over it and over all the oxen.
Still another interpretation, which has just as much as credibility, is that the last chapters of this section simply refer to the infamous battle of Armageddon, where all of the nations of the world march against Israel; this interpretation is supported by the War Scroll, which describes what this epic battle may be like, according to the group(s) that existed at Qumran.

===The Epistle of Enoch===
This section can be seen as being made up of five subsections, mixed by the final redactor:
* Apocalypse of Weeks (93:1–10, 91:11–17): this subsection, usually dated to the first half of the 2nd century BCE, narrates the history of the world using a structure of ten periods (said &quot;weeks&quot;), of which seven regard the past and three regard future events (the final judgment). The climax is in the seventh part of the tenth week where &quot;new heaven shall appear&quot; and &quot;there will be many weeks without number for ever, and all shall be in goodness and righteousness&quot;.
* Exhortation (91:1–10, 91:18–19): this short list of exhortations to follow righteousness, said by Enoch to his son Methuselah, looks to be a bridge to next subsection.
* Epistle (92:1–5, 93:11–105:2): the first part of the epistle describes the wisdom of the Lord, the final reward of the just and the punishment of the evil, and the two separate paths of righteousness and unrighteousness. Then there are six oracles against the sinners, the witness of the whole creation against them, and the assurance of the fate after death. According to Boccaccini the epistle is composed of two layers: a &quot;proto-epistle&quot;, with a theology near the deterministic doctrine of the Qumran group, and a slightly later part (94:4–104:6) that points out the personal responsibility of the individual, often describing the sinners as the wealthy and the just as the oppressed (a theme found also in the Book of Parables).
* Birth of Noah (106–107): this part appears in Qumran fragments separated from the previous text by a blank line, thus appearing to be an appendix. It tells of the deluge and of Noah, who is born already with the appearance of an angel. This text probably derives, as do other small portions of 1 Enoch, from an originally separate book (see Book of Noah), but was arranged by the redactor as direct speech of Enoch himself.
* Conclusion (108): this second appendix was not found in Qumran and is considered to be the work of the final redactor. It highlights the &quot;generation of light&quot; in opposition to the sinners destined to the darkness.

==Names of the fallen angels==
Some of the fallen angels that are given in 1 Enoch have other names, such as &quot;Rameel&quot; (&#x27;morning of God&#x27;), who becomes Azazel, and is also called &quot;Gadriel&quot; (&#x27;wall of God&#x27;) in Chapter 68. Another example is that &quot;Araqiel&quot; (&#x27;Earth of God&#x27;) becomes &quot;Aretstikapha&quot; (&#x27;world of distortion&#x27;) in Chapter 68.

&quot;Azaz&quot;, as in &quot;Azazel&quot;, means strength, so the name &quot;Azazel&quot; can refer to &#x27;strength of God&#x27;. This is also a key point in modern thought that Azazel was one of Lucifer’s chief leaders of the revolt against God.
Also important in this identification is the fact that the original name Rameel, is very similar in meaning to the word Lucifer (&#x27;Morning Star&#x27;) which is a common Latin name of Satan in Christianity.

Nathaniel Schmidt states, &quot;the names of the angels apparently refer to their condition and functions before the fall,&quot; and lists the likely meanings of the angels&#x27; names in the Book of Enoch, noting that &quot;the great majority of them are Aramaic.&quot;

The name suffix &quot;-el&quot; comes from the Hebrew text and the Lord’s name Emmanuel, (see list of names referring to El), and is used in the names of high-ranking angels. The archangels&#x27; names all include &quot;-el&quot;, such as &quot;Uriel&quot; (&#x27;flame of God&#x27;) and &quot;Michael&quot; (&#x27;who is like God&#x27;).

&quot;Gadreel&quot; () is listed as one of the chiefs of the fallen Watchers. He is said to have been responsible for deceiving Eve. Schmidt lists the name as meaning &#x27;the helper of God.&#x27;

==Enoch and contemporary theology==
Enochic studies have traditionally been historical, focusing on the meanings of the text for its ancient audiences. 1 Enoch counts as Old Testament scripture in the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church and has played a significant role in its theology, especially via the &quot;andemta&quot; tradition of interpretation. In 2015 a group of scholars from Ethiopia and other countries held meetings in Ethiopia and the UK to explore the significance of Enoch for contemporary theology. The initial outcome was a collection of essays published in 2017 on various theological topics, including justice, political theology, the environment, the identity of the Son of Man, suffering and evil.
