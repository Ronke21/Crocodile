The city is situated in the Silesian Voivodeship since its formation in 1999, previously (1975–1999) it was in Katowice Voivodeship. Jaworzno is one of the cities of the 2,7 million conurbation – Katowice urban area and within a greater Katowice-Ostrava metropolitan area populated by about 5,294,000 people.

== Geography ==

=== Location ===
The municipality is situated a short distance to the north-east of Junction 41 on the A4 Highway. It lies in the Silesian Highlands, in the historical region of Lesser Poland, and since its foundation until 1975, it was administratively tied with Lesser Poland&#x27;s capital, Kraków. Until 1795, it belonged to Kraków Voivodeship, then, together with Kraków, was seized by the Habsburg Empire in the Partitions of Poland. In 1815–1846 it belonged to the Free City of Kraków, which was annexed by Austria and merged with Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria. In 1918 Jaworzno returned to Poland. The name of the city comes from the &quot;jawor&quot; trees (sycamore maple), which in the past were abundant in this area.

=== Administrative position ===
Jaworzno was placed into the Silesian Voivodeship (province) effective January 1, 1999, under the Local Government Reorganization Act. Previously, it was attached to the Katowice Voivodeship (1975–1998) and before that to the Kraków Voivodeship. Jaworzno lies in the east of the largest metropolis in Poland and one of the largest in the European Union, numbering about 3,5 million. This urban expansion bloomed in the 19th century thanks to the rapid development of mining and metallurgical industries. In 2006 Jaworzno and 14 neighboring cities formed a multimunicipal structure, the Upper Silesian Metropolitan Union. Its population was 2 million and its area was . In 2016 Jaworzno left the Union, and in 2017 refused to join the Metropolis GZM (which eventually superseded the Union), mainly due to concerns about public transport quality.

=== Climate ===
The climate of the area is continental and humid. The annual average temperature is (January average and July average °C). Yearly rainfall averages at , the most rainy month being July. The area&#x27;s characteristic weak winds blow at about 2 m/s from the west (Moravian Gate).

== History ==
In the Middle Ages, a gord was established on the &quot;Grodzisko&quot; hill, traces of which can still be found. The first known mention of Jaworzno comes from 1229, and in 1335, a parish church of St. Wojciech existed here. Jaworzno remained a small village, located in western Lesser Poland, near the much larger and more important town of Chrzanów. From 1179, the nearby Przemsza river marked the border between Lesser Poland and Silesia. It also became a state border of Poland until 1922. The area of Jaworzno was originally under the rule of the bishops of Kraków. After Austria seized Silesia at the end of the 17th century, several coal mines were developed near Jaworzno. In the 18th century, silver, lead, iron, and zinc deposits were found here. In 1767, the first coal mine in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was opened in Szczakowa.
After the Partitions of Poland Jaworzno belonged to the Habsburg Empire, in 1809 – 1815 it was part of the Duchy of Warsaw, and in 1815–1846, it belonged to the Free City of Krakow, which in 1846 was annexed by the Austrian Empire. Jaworzno remained in Austrian Galicia until November 1918. In the 19th century, the village became famous for the so-called Three Emperors&#x27; Corner, where the borders of three powers met (German Empire, Russian Empire and Austria-Hungary). In 1847 a new railway line connected Jaworzno&#x27;s Szczakowa district with Kraków and Prussian Upper Silesia. The village became a center of industrialization. A power plant was opened in 1898, and Jaworzno&#x27;s coal mines extracted 84% of Galician coal. Several new factories were established here in the late 19th and early 20th century. As a result, on September 21, 1901, Emperor Franz Joseph I granted a town charter to Jaworzno.

Following World War I, in 1918, Poland regained independence and control of the town. In the Second Polish Republic, Jaworzno belonged to the Kraków Voivodeship, in which it also remained after the war, until 1975.

Following the joint German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II in September 1939, the town was occupied by Germany. The Germans operated several forced labour camps in the town, including a Nazi prison/forced labour camp, a subcamp of the Auschwitz concentration camp and the E596 subcamp of the Stalag VIII-B/344 prisoner-of-war camp for Western Allied POWs at the Jan Kanty Coal Mine (under occupation named &quot;Dachsgrube&quot;), and the E561, E563 and E732 subcamps of Stalag VIII-B/344, located at a local railway depot, at the Sobieski Coal Mine (then renamed &quot;Robertsgrube&quot;) and in the present-day district of Szczakowa, respectively.

After the war, the town was restored to Poland, although with a Soviet-installed communist regime, which stayed in power until the Fall of Communism in the 1980s. The communists converted the former Nazi German subcamp of Auschwitz into the Central Labour Camp Jaworzno. In the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland Jaworzno developed as an important center of industry. Its population quickly grew, when thousands of migrants came here in search of work at coal mines, power plants, and other factories. Furthermore, several villages were integrated with Jaworzno. As a result, Jaworzno&#x27;s area reaches . In 1975 the city became part of Katowice Voivodeship. Although most towns of pre-1975 Chrzanów County returned to Lesser Poland, Jaworzno was attached to the Silesian Voivodeship in 1999.

== Environment ==

Greens, forests, and undeveloped land constitute 60 percent of the town&#x27;s area. Jaworzno has environmentally valuable areas which as a group present a diversity of landscapes and vegetation as well as a richness of flora and fauna. These include the Dolina Zabnika Nature Reserve, the Dobra Wilkoszyn landscape protection area, the Sasanka Natural Surface Monument, Grodzisko Hill, and Sosina Lake. Within Jaworzno&#x27;s boundaries, there are 41 plant species under strict protection and 11 under partial protection.

<text>The Doric Club was an association of Loyals set up in Lower Canada by Adam Thom, a lawyer and journalist, in March 1836. A noted opponent of the Patriotes, the group was both a social club and a paramilitary organization. It was used as the armed faction of the Constitutional Party and many of its members took part in the Lower Canada Rebellions of 1837 and 1838 on the British side.

== History ==
The members of the club were mostly young anglophone radicals who had been forced to leave the British Rifle Corps after its dissolution by Lord Gosford in January 1836. Gosford affirmed that British subjects were not in danger, being adequately protected by the army, and that such groupings were useless. Believing them to be about 2,000 in number, he judged them to be troublemakers.

On March 16, 1836, the Club published its manifesto, calling all loyal British men to unite against what it had called the &quot;French domination&quot; in Lower Canada. &quot;If we are deserted by the British government and the British people, rather than submit to the degradation of being subject of a French-Canadian republic, we are determined by our own right arms to work out our deliverance&quot;, read the document.

Despite the opposition of Lord Gosford, the Doric Club was tolerated by General John Colborne, as were many other Loyal armed groups. On November 6, 1837, after an assembly of the Société des fils de la liberté, a group of young Patriote supporters, a violent skirmish erupted between the latter and the club. Finally, during the Lower Canada Rebellions, Colborne recruited several of its members as volunteers to quell the rebels.

<text>The Donghak Peasant Revolution () was a peasant revolt that took place between 11 January 1894 and 25 December 1895 in Korea. The peasants were primarily followers of Donghak, a Neo-Confucian movement that rejected Western technology and ideals.

The Revolution began in the province of Gobu-&quot;gun&quot;. In the early 1890s, , nominated magistrate of the &quot;gun&quot; in 1892, enforced harsh, oppressive policies upon the local peasant population. Correspondingly, in March 1894, a group of peasants led by Jeon Bong-jun and Kim Gae-nam began an uprising against local authorities. The initial revolt was suppressed under Yi Yong-tae, and Jeon Bong-jun fled to nearby Taein. Jeon gathered an army in Mount Paektu and recaptured Gobu in April. The rebels then defeated governmental forces in the Battle of Hwangtojae and the Battle of the Hwangryong River. Jeon then captured Jeonju Fortress and fought in a siege against Hong Gye-hun&#x27;s government forces. In May, the rebels agreed on a truce through the . However, an unstable peace continued throughout the summer.

The alarmed government requested the Qing dynasty for military intervention, to which the Qing responded with a deployment of 2,700 soldiers. Angered that the Qing government had not informed them before intervening (as promised in the Convention of Tientsin), Japan started the First Sino-Japanese War. The war resulted in an expulsion of Chinese influence in Korea and also signaled an end to the Self-Strengthening Movement in China itself.

Growing Japanese dominance in the Korean Peninsula caused anxiety amongst the rebels. From September to October, the Southern and Northern leaders negotiated the plans for the future in Samrye. On 12 October, a coalition army of Northern and Southern Jeobs was formed, and the army, numbering 25,000–200,000 (records differ), attacked Gongju. After several battles, the rebel army was decisively defeated in the Battle of Ugeumchi, and the rebels were again overthrown in the Battle of Taein. Hostility continued deep into the spring of 1895. The rebel leaders were captured in various locations in the Honam Region, and most were executed by a mass hanging in March.

==Background==

During the late 19th century, Korean society faced various social problems such as inequality, corruption, and excessive taxation. These problems later sparked a series of peasant-led rebellions, which began with the Gwanseo Peasant War. These events weakened the Joseon government and undermined its control over various regions of Korea outside of Hanseong.

===Founding of Donghak===
Various secret societies formed, apart from the rebellions, including the Salbangye, &#x27;Association of the Killers of the Yangban (aristocrats),&#x27; the Saljugye, &#x27;Association of the Killers of the (slave&#x27;s) masters,&#x27; the Salryakgye, &#x27;Association of Killers and robbers,&#x27; the Geomgye, &#x27;Sword association,&#x27; the Judogye, &#x27;Association of the drunk,&#x27; the Yudan, &#x27;League of Wanderers&#x27;, and the Nokrimdang, &#x27;Group of the Green Woods&#x27; (Nokrimdang were &#x27;noble thieves,&#x27; who stole from the rich and gave to the poor).

In this turbulent age, the Donghak religion was formed. Its founder, Choe Je-u, described the founding of the religion, which Choe Sihyeong, the second Donghak leader, later transcribed:

Donghak was a mixture of various religions. Its core tenets and beliefs (monotheism, sacred books, organized religion) are similar to Christianity. Choe himself said that &quot;the meanings [between Christianity and Donghak] are the same; only the words are different&quot;. The Donghak conversion rite, in which hundreds of people gathered in an open place and knelt before a cup of clean water, was partly influenced by the Christian baptism ritual.

However, many direct influences were from shamanism and folk beliefs. Witnesses record that Choe Je-u participated in animistic rituals to mountain deities. His chants and the Sword Dance were also derived from shamanism.

Certain beliefs were unique to Donghak. Choe Je-u said that &quot;All humans are Hanulnim&quot;. Choe promoted human equality and created certain ideologies, such as the belief that the world was a cycle of 5,000 years (&quot;Jeoncheon&quot; and &quot;Hucheon&quot;) and that this cycle was ending to make way for a new world. This made Donghak potentially dangerous to the Joseon Dynasty, which banned the religion and executed Choe in 1864 for &#x27;Tricking and Lying to the Foolish People.&#x27;

Nevertheless, Donghak spread across Gyeongsang Province by the 1870s, causing the need for a better organization. Donghak was organized into &#x27;Jeob&#x27; and &#x27;Po.&#x27; A &#x27;Jeobju&#x27; administered a &#x27;Jeob.&#x27; For example, Jeon Bong-jun, the leader of the revolution, was Jeobju of Gobu. Under a Jeobju was a &#x27;Myeonjeobju.&#x27; In large towns (such as Taein or Jeonju) were a &#x27;Great Jeobju,&#x27; as Kim Gae-nam was the Great Jeobju of Taein. Various Jeobs were organized into a &#x27;Po,&#x27; and a &#x27;Poju&#x27; led a Po. The &#x27;Gyoju,&#x27; at the time Choe Sihyeong, led the whole Donghak religion.

===Yi Pil-je&#x27;s Revolt===
In 1871, Yi Pil-je, Jeobju of Yeonghae, revolted using the Donghak infrastructure. The revolt failed but proved that Donghak was dangerous to the feudalistic Korean society.

Yi Pil-je&#x27;s Revolt seriously undermined Donghak in Gyeongsang Province, causing Choe Sihyeong to spread the religion to the populous provinces of Chungcheong and Jeolla. Choe wandered around these two provinces, spreading Donghak. was one of the first to convert in 1881, and he converted Jeon in 1891. Son Byong-hi was converted in 1882 by Choe, as did Kim Gae-nam in 1890. As seen below, he claimed conversion in 1891.

==Gyojo Shinwon movement==
By the 1890s, Donghak believers began a petition to overturn the 1863 Choe Je-u&#x27;s execution charges. The religion was split by this time into the &#x27;Northern Jeob&#x27; and the &#x27;Southern Jeob.&#x27; Seo Inju, leader of the Southern Jeob, asked Choe Sihyeong, the Gyoju, for a petition. Choe did not answer the request, presumably remembering the effects of Yi Pil-je&#x27;s Revolt on Donghak in Gyeongsang. Seo Inju and the Southern Jeob independently held a petition to free imprisoned Donghak believers and to restore the honor of Choe Je-u, which was not easily granted. In November 1892, Jeon Bong-jun led the Samrye Petition, petitioning for:
# Do not ban Donghak.
# Expel all Western missionaries and merchants.
# Kill corrupt officials.
In December, there was another petition in the market of Boeun. Many Southern Jeob believers thought they should march into Seoul and petition before the king, but Choe Sihyeong finally quelled the Boeun petition, instead penning a letter to King Gojong:
In response, Gojong ordered the Northern messengers to &quot;go to your homes. If you do, I may grant your plea&quot;. Meanwhile, Seo Inju and the Southern Jeob were threatening Westerners and Japanese with bodily harm, saying, &quot;If you do not flee by March the seventh, we shall all kill you. You are causing injustice in a foreign land.&quot; This was attached to American, French, and Japanese legations, Christian churches and schools, and districts with a large number of foreigners taking residence.

Jeon Bong-jun, meanwhile, led his followers into Boeun, which became the most violent and revolutionary petition in the Gyojo Shinwon Movement. His followers all wore blue clothes with red gloves. About 80,000 believers, with the flags &quot;Expel Westerners and Japanese,&quot; gathered in the market and built an earthen fortress. Revolutionary thoughts include, &quot;In other countries, the people hold councils and decide upon the government. This petition is like that. Why suppress it?&quot; formed. The petition was also more extreme. The requests were:
* Reclaim the honour of founder Choe Je-u.
* Cease the persecution of Donghak believers.
* Chase away colonial powers.
* Cease all imports of foreign merchandise, wear cotton, and use necessities made in Korea.
* Dispose of the Min family of oligarchical power.
* Lower taxes.
* Ban the inflation-causing Dangojeon coin.
* Stop illegal taxation.
Northern Jeob leaders, such as Choe Sihyeong and Son Byong-hi, feared that the government would execute Donghak believers and stopped the petition within three days. Jeon Bong-jun returned to Gobu.

== Gobu Revolt ==

The rebellion&#x27;s immediate cause was the conduct of , the ruling official of Gobu. After his capture, Jeon gave a detailed account of Jo&#x27;s misdeeds:
* He built the Manseokbo Reservoir under the existing Min Reservoir (now Yedeung Reservoir). He took water taxes from the peasants, two sacks of rice for using the upper reservoir, and a sack of rice for using the lower reservoir. He collected seven hundred sacks of rice in total.
* He promised peasants who farmed abandoned land would be exempt from taxes for five years, but he forced them to pay taxes in the autumn of 1893.
* He fined affluent peasants for dubious crimes, including &#x27;infidelity,&#x27; &#x27;lack of harmony,&#x27; &#x27;adultery,&#x27; and &#x27;needless talents,&#x27; by which he collected 20,000 nyang (&quot;nyang&quot; a unit of Korean currency, equivalent to seventy US dollars, making 20,000 nyang comparable 1.4 million U.S. dollars).
* He taxed a thousand nyang (the equivalent of 700 thousand US dollars) to build a monument to his father, Jo Hugyun, who had been the magistrate of Taein.
* To send sacks of rice to the government, he sent only sacks of spoiled rice to Seoul, taking unspoiled sacks for himself.
* While he was building the reservoir, he heedlessly cut down trees centuries old and did not give any wages to the workers.
Of these, the construction of the Manseokbo reservoir caused the most fury. Yedeung Reservoir had caused the Baedeul fields to not suffer from starvation ever since Yedeung was built. However, the construction of the new reservoir blocked creeks in the region, causing widespread damage through flooding.

Donghak believers and angered peasants began forming a rebel army. They used the Sabal Tongmun, whose names were written around a circular cone to form a circle. The Sabal Tongmun made the leader of the writers unclear (because it was impossible to know who had signed their name first). On 10 January 1894, a thousand rebels gathered in an abandoned horse ranch. Splitting into two armies, they destroyed three of the four gates of Gobu and occupied the government office. Jo fled Gobu to Jeonju (he was exiled after the war ended and returned from his exile to become a judge).

For a week, the rebels destroyed prisons and freed innocent prisoners, armed themselves with weapons from the local armory, punished corrupt officials who had been captured, returned taxed and fined property to original owners, and destroyed Manseokbo Reservoir. However, the crisis ended when Jo was replaced by Park Won-myeong, who convinced the rebels to disband.

==First revolt==

Jeon and Kim went south to Mujang, where they met Son Hwa-jung. The rebels organized adequately in Mujang, and on 20 March, the 4,000 rebels of Mujang turned towards Mount Baek, Gobu. While camped in Mount Baek, the army grew to tens of thousands. Choe Deokyeong&#x27;s 300 peasants joined them from the north. Here, the aphorism came: &quot;When sitting, a white mountain; when standing, a bamboo mountain.&quot; (rebels mostly wore white and used bamboo spears. The term may have appeared earlier, however, as Mount Juk, meaning &#x27;bamboo mountain,&#x27; could only be seen when standing, as it was covered by smaller Mount Baek, &#x27;white mountain.&#x27;) On 22 March, the rebels destroyed the reservoir and burned down governmental offices and storage.

The rebels camped for four days in Gobu, and new rebels joined them daily. After making Jeon Bong-jun the leader and Kim Gae-nam and Son Hwa-Jung as generals, the rebels occupied Taein (1 April) and Buan (4 April). The leaders also ordered the rebels to follow the four guidelines:
# Do not kill the innocent, and refrain from eating farm animals.
# Open the Hucheon through loyalty and piety and appease the people.
# Defeat every single barbarian of Japan and purify the holy land.
# Drive the army into Seoul and kill every member of the Min family.
The rebels also &quot;did not seek alcohol and women and did not smoke tobacco.&quot; They did not forcefully take food but paid for them in money.

===Battle of Hwangtojae===
The government sent Yi Gyeonghyo to quell the rebellion and made an emergency army of 700 soldiers and 600 merchants. The 10,000 rebels lured governmental forces into Hwangto Pass. In the dawn of April the 7th, the governmental soldiers charged into the rebel camp but found it empty. Soldiers were in chaos. Suddenly, the rebels, moving under the cover of fog, emerged from the mountains and attacked the governmental forces, killing a thousand soldiers. Most of the rebels were unharmed in the thus concluded Battle of Hwangtojae.

===Battle of Hwangryong River===
By 17 April, however, Jeon turned south to Yeonggwang, where Hong Gyehun&#x27;s governmental troops were waiting. Jeon attempted to lure the troops to Jangseong, and General Yi Hakseung chased after them. Yi Hakseung attacked while the rebels were camped on the Hwangryong River, eating lunch. The rebel leader Yi Bangeon envisioned a new strategy. The rebels fled to the mountains, then ran downhill, rolling thousands of &quot;Jangtae&quot;, or chicken cages. The Jangtae blocked most bullets, thus rendering the government&#x27;s superior weapons useless. Moreover, Jeon placed the rebel army so that they would divide Yi Hakseung&#x27;s troops into three separate divisions. Yi Hakseung ordered the troops to use their cannons. Still, they did not work because the pro-rebel villagers had put water inside the cannons (following the incident, rumours spread throughout the government forces that a ghost had destroyed the cannons). More than 300 governmental forces but only two rebels died in the Battle of Hwangryong River.

===Siege of Jeonju Fortress===
After the Hwangryong, a royal messenger brought bribes to quell the rebellion to Jeon. Jeon killed the messenger but took the needed money. Jeon then turned north and occupied Jeonju, the largest city in Jeolla province. not choosing to take Naju to the south. Hong Gyehun quickly returned north, beginning the Siege of Jeonju Fortress.

Meanwhile, on 29 April, the administrator of Jeonju, Kim Mun-hyeon, appeared in Gongju and told the government of the fall of Jeonju. Unable to control the rebellion, the government of Joseon formally requested military assistance from Japan and China. On 3 May, 1,500 Qing Dynasty forces appeared in Incheon. The same day, 6,000 Japanese forces landed in Incheon. The Japanese inquired why the Qing had not notified the Japanese government by the Convention of Tientsin, and soon caused the First Sino-Japanese War.

====Treaty of Jeonju====
On 7 May, Kim Hak-jin, the new administrator of Jeonju, ordered Hong to make peace with the rebels. The rebels, suffering from lack of food, accepted. This came to be called the Treaty of Jeonju (全州和約) or Jeonju Truce. Hong accepted twelve rebel requests:
# Accept the Donghak religion.
# Punish corrupt officials.
# Punish those who became illegally rich.
# Punish corrupt Yangban and Seonbi.
# Free all slaves.
# Free the Cheonmin class, and cease the branding of butchers.
# Legalize the remarriage of widows.
# Lower taxes.
# Pick politicians based on qualities, not families.
# Punish those who cooperate with the Empire of Japan.
# Illegalize debts.
# Give their land to all peasants.
Following the truce, the rebels climbed out of the fortress using ladders, and Hong entered the empty fortress.

Both sides celebrated their &#x27;victory&#x27;. Hong held a feast with his soldiers inside Jeonju Fortress, while the rebels sang the &quot;Geomgyeol&quot;, a Donghak religious hymn which begins: 
== Summer of 1894 ==


The summer of 1894 was marked by rebel rule over most of Southwest Korea. Jeon Bong-jun established the Jeollajwaudo Daedoso (&quot;Great Capital of the Two Jeolla Provinces&quot;) in Jeonju and built &quot;Jibgangso&quot; in most towns. In Naju, Namwon, and Unbong, however, the rebels met fierce resistance from landowners. Jeon had not subdued these southern cities, as he went north after the Battle of the Hwangryong. attacked Naju with 3,000 rebels, and the landowners of Naju began to fortify Naju against rebel attacks. Jeon met the Naju landowners and convinced them to allow Jibgangso construction in Naju. However, Naju was still not under complete rebel control and later became the center of rebel persecution. In Namwon, Kim Kaenam also battled landowners with 3,000 rebels, took the fortress, and hanged Kim Yongheon, the anti-rebel leader. Unbong surrendered at the sight of the rebels. Remaining Jibgangso include Daechang High School in Yecheon, Jinnam Office in Yeosu, Geumseong Office in Naju, Mujang Hall in Mujang (preserved by Mujang magistrates as a historical relic), and Yeosan Office in Yeosan (now a town hall).

The Jeobju of the town and his assistant, the Jeobsa, administered a &quot;Jibgangso&quot; agency. Under the Jeobju were the Seogi, the Seongchal, the Jibsa, the Posa, and the Dongmong. For deciding on matters, there was a council, with the Jeobjang and Jeobsa at its head, who voted on town matters. Yi Yihwa sees this as a rudimentary democracy.

Among the Seogi, Seongchal, the Jibsa, and the Dongmong, the Seogi were scribes who kept records of the activities and decisions of the &quot;Jibgangso&quot;. They also reprinted orders and publications from the rebel leaders, displayed them on marketplaces, and gave them to the people. Most Seogi were progressive Yangban, as the scribes had to have literacy.

Meanwhile, the Seongchal were town police who administered the law and reported corrupt officials or Yangban to the Dongmong and Posa. Most Seongchal were killed in the Second Revolt.

Dongmong were young men who were arrested, imprisoned, or even flogged those reported by the Seongchal. They also had a powerful hatred for Yangban, often castrating them and using Yangban women to light candles or pour water. Dongmong also led to a curious marriage practice called &#x27;three-day marriage.&#x27; Dongmong, searching for partners, hung white scarves on the door of the house of a Yangban who had an unmarried daughter. This meant that the daughter had to marry the Dongmong. To escape the forced marriage, fathers often found another suitable young man and made the daughter marry him within three days in secret. By November, three-day marriage had become so prevalent that the only virgins left were girls under fourteen years of age. Posa, tiger hunters who served effectively as soldiers, cooperated with the Seongchal and Dongmong to fight against the Yangban resistance.

The rebels referred to their cause as the &quot;Dongdo&quot; (another name for &#x27;Donghak&#x27;) and their army as the &quot;Dongdo Euibyeong&quot;, the &quot;Righteous army of Donghak.&quot; Rebels called themselves &#x27;Hajeob,&#x27; after the lowest Donghak initiate, and called any other person, even children, &#x27;Jeobjang,&#x27; a rendering of Jeobju.

==Second revolt==
While the First Sino-Japanese War raged on, Japanese troops occupied Seoul and made a pro-Japanese government there. Before the Battle of Pyongyang, Jeon&#x27;s strategy seemed to crush the fleeing Japanese from the South while the Chinese soldiers chased them from the North. However, his prediction was proved wrong, with a major Chinese defeat in Pyongyang. Jeon decided he should defeat the Japanese by taking control of Korea and severing Japanese supply lines. However, he knew he would have to get the support of the Northern Jeob, who commanded all Donghak outside &quot;Jibgangso-controlled areas.

Choe Sihyeong was staunchly anti-rebel, as he feared that a large-scale rebellion based on the Donghak religion would end with the destruction of Donghak. The Northern Jeob had to fight against the largely Southern Jeob rebels to escape persecution. Here is an excerpt of his words:
===Samrye Council===
On 14 September, Northern and Southern leaders gathered in Samrye. It is said that Jeon rode a white horse in this meeting. The Northern flags said &#x27;Conquer the South,&#x27; while Southern ones said &#x27;Conquer the Foreigners&#x27; or &#x27;Protect the Nation.&#x27; After a month of negotiations, on 12 October, Choe Sihyeong finally cried out to the Northern Jeob: &quot;Shall we die while seated?&quot;.

The Northern leader, Son Byong-hi, led 10,000–100,000 Northern Jeob followers as the General of the Northern Jeob. Jeon also led 12,000–100,000 Southerners as the General of the Southern Jeob (most recent estimates give a total army of about 50,000). However, Kim Kaenam was absent; he led 5,000 rebels in an attack on Cheongju. Together, they marched north to Gongju, the capital of Chungcheong Province. As they marched, Jeon said:

===Battle of Ugeumchi===
Although the army had started with 40,000 rebels, when they camped at Non Stream, 12 kilometers south of Gongju, the army was 10,000; peasants joined them as they marched. There were also 50 Chinese soldiers, who had fled from the Sino-Japanese War. Inside the Fortress of Gongju were perhaps 3,000 governmental forces led by Gu Sangjo, Seong Hayeong, Jang Yongjin, and Yi Gidong, and some 400 Japanese soldiers led by Colonel Moriya.

The Donghak army&#x27;s strategy was to surround Gongju from Buyeo and Nonsan. On 23 October, a rebel battalion took Yiyin and Hyopyo, four kilometers south of Gongju.

On 24 and 25 October, the Battle of Ung Pass, or Ungchi, occurred between rebels and a coalition army of Japanese soldiers, governmental forces, and anti-rebel guerrillas. Ungchi was a pass that led straight to Gongju, a crucial location for the rebels. However, the rebels were not able to take Ungchi. Most were armed with only bows and arrows, spears, swords, and seventeenth-century-style muskets, which could not defeat the coalition&#x27;s superior firepower. The Northern Jeob experienced severe casualties in Ungchi because they lacked proper training in war.

The rebels retreated south to Nonsan. Jeon and Son decided to capture Gongju through a different pass: Ugeum Pass, or Ugeumchi.

On 8 November, two battalions lured governmental forces so that the major rebel forces would not meet a large governmental army in Ugeumchi. At 3:00 in the afternoon, the rebels concentrated the governmental forces in Yiyin and Hyopyo, where 10,000 rebels were. The other 200,000 rebels were crossing Ugeumchi. However, they encountered a Japanese battalion of 280 soldiers. The Japanese gathered the Korean forces into Ugeumchi. After a night passed, the two armies clashed in Ugeumchi at the dawn of 9 November.

Jeon placed his army so the rebels stretched sixteen kilometers from Panchi to Mount Bonghwang. Jeon was at the center of this line, surrounded by flags and riding his white horse. The government forces defended the sides (Hyopyo, Ungchi, Mount Bonghwang) while the Japanese were stationed in Ugeumchi proper. At 10:00 am, the rebels charged at Ugeumchi.

Because of their weak weapons, they were unable to cross Ugeumchi. The Japanese used cannons and rifles and had proper military training. Although small groups of rebels crossed the &#x27;death line&#x27; more than forty times, they were all shot down. After one charge at the Japanese, only 10,000 of the original 200,000 rebels were left. After the following charge, there were 3,000 rebels left. When the rebels finally retreated on 10 November, only 500 out of an army of 200,000 remained.

Meanwhile, in Hyopyo, the 10,000 rebels captured various peaks, but the Japanese instantly reinforced them whenever the governmental forces seemed to break. By 10 November, both armies retreated to Nonsan. The Battle of Ugeumchi was over. A spectator of the battle expressed the battle:
===Retreat from Gongju===
Jeon and his 500 remaining rebels retreat south from Gongju while the allied forces of the Joseon Army and the Imperial Japanese Army pursue them. They arrived in Nonsan to rendezvous with the other Donghak peasants defeated by government and Japanese troops. But they were defeated and forced back to Jeonju Fortress to gather an army of 8,000 rebels. However, they abandoned the fort because of the lack of supplies and retreated to Wonpyeong and Taein, the rebel center, to reorganize their army.

On 25 November, the Japanese caught up with the rebels and camped in Mount Gumi. Despite rebel strategic superiority, the Japanese firepower annihilated both the rebels and the city of Taein. A historian, Park Eunsik, recorded &quot;nothing left in Taein for 40 kilometers&quot;. Forty civilian houses, along with perhaps 400 rebels, were killed.

After the Battle of Taein, on 28 November 1894, Jeon formally dissolved the Donghak Army. The rebels cried: &quot;We thought Jeon Nokdu (Jeon&#x27;s nickname) would save us, but now we are all going to die.&quot; Jeon answered: &quot;War is a game of luck. Why is it that you blame me?&quot;. He then dressed up as a peasant and headed east.

== Battles outside the main front ==
=== Jeolla ===
Jeolla Province was the revolution&#x27;s center, completely seized by the rebels. They formed the core of the Anti-Japanese Frontier and often aided Gyeongsang and Chungcheong rebels. Kim Inbae of Gwangyang and Yi Bangeon of Jangheung formed the core of South Jeolla rebels.

====Namwon and Unbong====
Namwon and Unbong were ruled by Kim Gae-nam&#x27;s rebels. However, Kim Gae-nam had gone to attack Cheongju far to the north, and in his absence, the governmental soldiers attacked Namwon. On 13 November, the rebels were driven away from the outskirts of Namwon in a small battle. The 3,000 rebels fled to Namwon Fortress. Jo Byeongho, the governmental leader, led 2,000 soldiers armed with modern weapons to besiege Namwon. Although the fortress was bombed and shelled, the rebels did not come out. Finally, the governmental troops stacked hay around the east, west, and south walls and burned the hay. The wooden doors burned along, and the rebels fled through the north door. Hundreds of rebels were killed in the Siege of Namwon.

==== Jindo ====
In Jindo, the third largest island of Korea (after Jeju and Geoje), Na Chihyeon of Naju converted the population to Donghak in January 1892. After the fall of Jeonju Fortress, the Jindo magistrate Yi Heuiseung (who, like Jo, built two monuments to himself) fled. However, Confucian scholars maintained order on the island through an army called Suseonggun.
In July, Son Haenggwon assaulted Susseonggun bases, taking matchlock rifles, swords, bullets, gunpowder, and tridents. At a similar time, Park Jungjin attacked the Suseonggun at Shimijang village. He was killed, and his daughter captured; descendants destroyed the family tree and burned down the house.

After the arrival of new officials, the Jindo rebels joined the Naju rebels. Most were captured and returned to Jindo. On 10 October, 1,322 soldiers, composed mainly of slaves and lower officials, were sent to defend Jindo against possible rebel attacks.

In December, rebels who had fought under Yi Bangeon hid in Jindo after the Battle of Seokdae Fields. However, the rebels had lost all military power and were captured and imprisoned. On 27 December, Japanese soldiers executed fifty rebels. Cheondoism remained in Jindo until the 1950s.

=== Gyeongsang ===
Gyeongsang Province had a solid Confucian influence, and the casualties of Yi Pil-je&#x27;s Revolt in 1871 were still fresh. It took until August for Gyeongsang rebels to begin revolting. Suppression of revolts was an organized effort, with &quot;Toposa&quot; officials specializing in anti-rebel campaigns.

==== Jinju ====
The forces of the Southwest coasts of Korea were unique in that the Jeolla and Gyeongsang Provinces cooperated to attack Jinju Fortress. They are collectively termed under the name &#x27;Jinju Rebels.&#x27;

On 7 May, Kim Inbae, the Great Jeobju of Geumgu, built a &quot;Jibgangso&quot; in Suncheon, Jeolla Province. On 1 September, Kim crossed the Gyeongsang-Jeolla boundary. His strategy was to charge through the southern coastline to Busan and thus grasp the Japanese-Korean borderline.

Meanwhile, Hadong and Jinju, who were Kim&#x27;s targets, were experiencing rebel activities. Hadong rebels were chased west by the government, joining Kim Inbae. With the guidance of the Hadong rebels, Kim Inbae captured Hadong on 7 September.

The leadership recruited rebels in Jinju by sending out public documents in significant markets. On 8 September 1894, 7,000 rebels gathered in Sugok Market and established the Chungyeong Daedoso, a center of rebel activities. By 17 September, a joint army of Suncheon and Jinju rebels had captured the Jinju fortress.

The rebels held flags signaling their Po and Jeob and spread manifestos titled &quot;To the People of the Towns of Gyeongsang&quot; throughout nearby villages. The manifesto said the following.
* The state is the people, and the people are the state.
* We have had a council in Jinju to punish the Japanese invasion.
* All believers in Donghak must rise and punish corrupt officials who support the Japanese.
* Report anti-rebel armies to the Chunggyeong Daedoso.

In response to the fall of the Jinju Fortress, the government sent Ji Seokyeong as &quot;Toposa&quot; of Jinju, a government official who specialized in suppressing the Donghak revolutions.

On 10 October, 400 rebels gathered in Mount Geumo, a few kilometers west of Jinju, where Japanese forces ambushed them. Although the rebels lost more than seventy men in the Battle of Mount Geumo, the rebels still held Jinju Fortress.

On 14 October, 5,000 rebels defended Mount Goseong Fortress against the Japanese. Using the fortress, the rebels fought fiercely against Colonel Suzuki&#x27;s Japanese battalion but were ultimately defeated by Japanese firepower. One hundred eighty-seven rebels were killed, causing Mount Goseong to be called Mount Gosireong after the sound that a decomposing corpse makes when it rains. The remnants of the rebels fled to Mount Jiri, where they became the Righteous Army.

=== Chungcheong ===
Chungcheong rebels were under the command of Son Byong-hi, who led the Northern Jeob into battle at Ugeumchi. After the defeat at Ugeumchi, Son continued the rebellion until the Battle of Jonggok on 18 December. Chungcheong was the location of the December battles.

==== Cheongju ====

On 9 October, before the Council of Samrye had reached its conclusion, there was a minor skirmish in Daejeon, at the time a small village called Hanbat, between rebels and governmental forces. This came to be called the Daejeon Massacre. Seventy-eight rebels gave 78 government soldiers alcohol, then killed them while drunk.

Meanwhile, the city of Cheongju was the Donghak division commanded by the Great Jeobju, Son Cheonmin. Kim Gae-nam and Son Cheonmin cooperated to attack Cheongju in the Battle of Cheongju on 9 December 1894. Because Kim did not fight at Ugeumchi, his army of 25,000 was still strong.

When Jeon and Son gathered the rebel forces in Samrye, Kim did not cooperate. He began his attack only after the Battle of Ugeumchi, and by 9 December, he reached Cheongju Fortress.

Kim&#x27;s opponent was Kuwabara Eiziro and his Japanese battalion, along with governmental troops with little morale. Kim&#x27;s 15,000 men attacked from the South, while Son Cheonmin&#x27;s 10,000 attacked from the North. The defenders of Cheongju lacked morale due to the Daejeon Massacre, and Kim nearly broke through the south door. Eiziro suddenly assaulted the rebels, and Kim retreated to Muneui.

Two hundred rebels were killed in the Battle of Cheongju. The rebels also lost large amounts of weaponry, including many rebel banners, thousands of bows and arrows, 140 rifles, 2,000 flintlock muskets, 150 kilograms of gunpowder, two cannons, and 50 horses.
After the Battle of Cheongju, Kim went south to Muneui but was defeated again. He went into hiding, just as Jeon Bong-jun did.

==== Northern Chungcheong ====
Although Choe Sihyeong had banned rebel activities among the Northern Jeob during the spring of 1894, many Chungcheong rebels were Northern Jeob. By 22 March, rebels of Hoenggang, Yeongdeung, Cheongsan, Boeun, Okcheon, Jinjam, Muneui, Goesan, and Yeongpung were already giving the wealth of the rich to the poor, and beat and castrated corrupt Yangban. However, the Chungju rebels temporarily stopped activities due to the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War.

The Battle of Pungdo and the Battle of Seonghwan were both fought in Chungcheong Province, and the war sparked anti-Japanese sentiment among the former rebels. In July, 1,000 rebels wandered through various towns, building earthen fortresses in preparation for a Japanese invasion of Chungcheong. The rebels took weaponry from the governmental storages and trained themselves. In August, a small battle was between the Northern and the Southern Jeob.

On 12 October, Choe Sihyeong ordered the Northern Jeob to revolt. The rebels of Northern Chungcheong organized under the Jeob and Po and began active revolts.

More than a hundred battles took place in Northern Chungcheong in this period. The Gwandong Po won against a Japanese battalion in the Battle of Goesan under the leadership of Sim Songhak. The rebels then reached Boeun, thus severing all direct roads between Seoul and Jeolla. The revolt flared even greater when Son Byong-hi joined the Northern Chungcheong rebels. Survivors of the Battle of Taein joined the rebels as well.

On 18 December, 2,600 rebel forces gathered in Jonggok. The rebels included the great Northern leader Son Byeonghui, whose family lived near Jonggok, and the patriarch of Donghak, Choe Sihyeong. Japanese sources report that the rebels were cooking meals when the Japanese attacked them. Because of the surprise attack, the rebels were not able to put up a suitable defense, leading to 2,500 rebels out of 2,600 being killed. (Some scholars prefer the term Jonggok Massacre.) Both Choe and Son survived but fled towards the South. Minor skirmishes continued in this region until 28 December.

==== Battle of Mount Seseong ====
The rebels of Cheonan, Hongseong, and northwestern Chungcheong were defeated in the Battle of Mount Seseong. This battle was also the key to Jeon Bong-jun&#x27;s plan to capture Seoul.

In August, 1,500 rebels revolted in Cheonan and took governmental weapons. After organizing their army in Mount Soto, the rebels camped in Mount Seseong with their newfound weaponry. Mount Seseong was more of a low hill, 22 meters high, defended by a low wall, which has been in use since the Proto-Three Kingdoms Age. The rebel leaders were Kim Yongheui, Kim Hwaseong, Kim Seongji, Kim Bokyong, Kim Yeongu, and Won Keumok.

On 18 November, two Japanese platoons were located on the northern slopes, another platoon to the northeast and another to the southeast. At dawn, the southeast platoon ambushed the rebels, who resisted for two hours, aided by their superior knowledge of the terrain. However, they were forced to retreat to the west, where they were ambushed again by the two northern platoons.

Three hundred seventy rebels were killed, 770 were wounded, and 17 were captured. The rebels also lost 140 guns, two trumpets, 228 spears, 26,500 Chinese bullets, 30 flags, 226 sacks of rice, and 13 sacks of barley. Kim Bokyong was captured and executed on the spot, and the other leaders were executed on 24 and 27 November. The hill was known as Mount Siseong, meaning &#x27;Mountain washed with blood.&#x27;

=== Gyeonggi ===
Because Gyeonggi was very close to Seoul, rebel activities in Gyeonggi were few. The largest Gyeonggi rebel groups, numbering 1,000 rebels, were in Yicheon, Yeoju, Anseong, and other parts of Southeastern Gyeonggi. The Gyeonggi rebels retreated south to Chungcheong, joining the rebels of Northern Chungcheong. Most were killed in the Battle of Jonggok (see above).

=== Gangwon ===
Gangwon rebels can be divided into two groups: the rebels of Gangneung and the rebels of Hoengseong and Wonju. Rebels from Northern Chungcheong or Gyeonggi occasionally crossed into Wonju. Gangwon rebels were especially marked by guerrilla warfare.

==== Gangneung and Pyeongchang ====
In these regions, rebels would occupy Gangneung, then flee to mountainous locations such as Pyeongchang, then return to Gangneung.

In September, more than 1,000 rebels attacked Gangneung, which lacked defenses. The rebels gave one sack of rice to each peasant by taking the wealth of the rich and built strongholds in most marketplaces. The rebels formed their court, lowered taxes, and punished corrupt Yangban and rich Sangmin.

On 7 September, an anti-rebel battalion led by Yi Hoewon assaulted the sleeping rebels in the rainy dawn. Twenty rebels were killed, and Yi&#x27;s forces took seven guns, 157 spears, and two horses. The rebels passed the Daegwanryeong Pass into Pyeongchang.

By late September, the rebels had reorganized and recaptured Gangneung. they also occupied Pyeongchang, Yeongweol, and Jeongseon. In response, the Japanese army sent Captain Ishimori against the Gangneung rebels on 3 November. On 5 November, 10,000 rebels had a two-hour-long battle against Ishimori&#x27;s troops but were ultimately defeated. The rebels fled to Jeongseon.

On 6 November, the governmental troops killed ten rebels in Jeongseon and burned down 70 houses. The rebels again fled to Pyeongchang.

Ishimori fought against 3,000 rebels in Pyeongchang on 1 December 1894. The rebels scattered after an hour of battle. Seventy rebels were instantly killed, 30 died from their wounds, and ten prisoners were killed for attempted rebellion. The Gangneung rebels ceased to exist after this battle.

==== Hoengseong, Wonju, and Hongcheon ====
Rebels of these regions were primarily guerrillas in mountainous terrain. The rebel leader was the legendary Cha Giseok, the Great Jeobju of the Gwandong Region. He led 1,000 rebels, who punished corrupt Yangban and collected taxes from merchants. It is said that Cha killed hundreds of Yangban.

On 13 October, Cha attacked Dongchang, where the taxes collected in Gangwon were brought to Seoul by boat. He burned down Dongchang and gave the taxes to the peasants. The magistrate of Hongcheon reports that after the destruction of Dongchang, more and more people joined Cha&#x27;s army.

The government asked Maeng Yeongjae, a Confucian scholar, to conquer Cha&#x27;s &#x27;crowd of roving thieves.&#x27; Maeng, suppressing the rebels of Yicheon at the time, gladly obliged. On 21 October, Maeng and Cha battled in the Jangya Fields, in which more than 30 rebels were killed. The rebels fled to Seoseok, into the &#x27;Seonang Pass.&#x27; It was so named because there was an altar to the deity Seonangshin in the past.

On 22 October, 2,000 rebels were killed in the consequent Battle of Jajak Pass, the largest battle in Gangwon Province before the Korean War. The rebels lacked guns, and they used birch branches as weapons. They also lacked pots and cooked rice over cattle hide. Because of the narrowness of the pass, the rebels were crowded, and it was easy for Maeng&#x27;s troops to fire into the camp and kill the rebels. Maeng himself reports that &quot;it was impossible to see how many died,&quot; but descendants have estimated 1,800~2,000. Descendants also note that the battle continued for three or four days. The Seonang Pass was renamed Jajak Pass because the blood made a &#x27;Jajak&#x27; sound as it rolled down the pass.

On 26 October, the survivors, including Cha, regathered. On 11 November, they began the Battle of Mount Odae, in which Maeng&#x27;s soldiers surrounded Mount Odae and began to climb it and defeat the rebels inside. One hundred rebels were killed, and 40 houses were burned. Cha was captured on 14 November and beheaded for treason in Chuncheon.

=== Hwanghae ===
1893, the Joseon Dynasty banned gold mining in Hwanghae Province. Although Hwanghae leaders, such as Kim Gu the &#x27;Baby Jeobju&#x27; (Kim Gu was eighteen at the time, compared to the 40-year-old Jeon Bong-jun or the 32-year-old Son Byong-hi), were believers in Donghak, most of the rebels were gold miners. Lieutenant Suzuku classified Hwanghae rebels in three ways:
# True Donghak, &quot;who mutter incantations and believe that their faith shall cure diseases, bring wealth, and lengthen life.&quot;
# Temporary Donghak, &quot;who do not believe the teachings... but join the Donghak religion.&quot;
# False Donghak, &quot;those... who hate foreigners... are suppressed by local magistrates, suffer from inflation, or can no longer mine for gold. Most are gold miners, and that is because... gold mining was banned last year, and... they no longer have money, and they wish for revenge&quot;.

==== Haeju ====
Haeju was one of the two provincial capitals to fall to the rebels (the other being Jeonju). The defeat of the Haeju rebels is documented in Lieutenant Suzuku&#x27;s &quot;Conquest of the Donghak of Hwaghae&quot;.

By 27 November, the rebels had captured most of the Hwanghae coast, including Haeju, without a significant battle. However, at the dawn of 27 November, 400 rebels camped on Pyeongsan were assaulted by governmental forces and fled south to Nucheon. Knowing that the Japanese and the government troops were chasing them, they hurriedly ran to Nucheon. Suzuku captured many Donghak food supplies in Nucheon, including &quot;hundreds of sacks of millet.&quot; 

On 29 November, Suzuku captured the town of Gajichon. However, there were no men in Gajichon. When the women of Gajichon were interrogated, they revealed that all grown men had been ordered to go to the town of Onjeong. Suzuku&#x27;s soldiers burned four sacks of rice cakes in Gajichon.

The Japanese reached Onjeong, only to find it empty. The magistrate of Onjeong said that the rebels had never come and that they were to go to Haeju rather than Onjeong. Haeju, too, was empty. The governor of Hwanghae said that &quot;every town outside of Haeju is full of thieves... two-thirds of all towns in Hwanghae are full of the Donghak raiders&quot;.

With the guidance of the officials of Haeju, the Japanese defeated hundreds of rebels in the hour-long Battle of Gohyeonjang, killing &quot;tens of thieves.&quot; 
They also captured and beheaded several rebels and burned five houses.

Kim Gu and his rebels sought to reoccupy Haeju and attacked Japanese scouts at 6:00 am on 2 December 1894. The battle continued until 8:00 when the rebels finally fled. Tens of rebels were again killed, and many were captured. Suzuku discovered a manifesto from the captured rebels written by Choe Sihyeong, the Donghak patriarch. The manifesto proved that the Haeju rebels were under the command of Choe Sihyeong and the Northern Jeob leaders.

The rebels gathered in Cheongdan, 2.5 kilometers away from Haeju. Seven thousand rebels were camped in the east and the South, and 400 were hidden in the pine forests. Ten thousand were camped 400 meters away, and 14,000 were camped a kilometer away. Because the rebels lacked rifles and other modern weaponry, they were crushed after three Japanese strikes. However, the rebels did not retreat. Because the Japanese also lacked ammunition due to the large number of rebels, they finally directly charged at the rebels. Although the rebels only had old-fashioned muskets, the superior numbers of the rebels wore out the Japanese soldiers. The rebels fled and were chased for 600 meters. Minor skirmishes continued until January 1895, and Kim Gu hid in the house of An Taehun, a Catholic and the father of An Junggeun, until 1896.

=== Pyongan and Hamgyong ===
Pyongan Province had little rebel activity. It suffered extreme casualties in the First Sino-Japanese War, especially at the Battle of Pyongyang. There were occasional reports of rebels killing magistrates or attacking Japanese support lines, but such instances were rare. Also, there were only two Jeobju for all of Pyongan, compared with seven for Hwanghae and Gyeonggi, ten for Gangwon, seventeen for Chungcheong, nineteen for Gyeongsang, and twenty-five for Jeolla.

There were minor incidents of rebellions in Hamgyong:
== Fall ==

Although Jeon Bong-jun officially disbanded the rebel army after the Battle of Taein, many other commanders did not disband their respective armies until December. On 1 December, Son Hwa-jung and Choe Gyeong-seon disbanded their rebel armies in Gwangju and went into hiding. The same day, the great rebel leader Kim Gae-nam was captured. Kim had been betrayed by a friend named Yim Byeongchan and captured by 80 governmental soldiers who surrounded the house of Kim&#x27;s brother-in-law. Kim was dragged to Naju. On 13 December, he was put to death by beheading, and his corpse was ripped apart in five. The magistrate of Naju ate Kim&#x27;s intestines and liver.

On 2 December, Jeon Bong-jun was also captured in a village called Pinori in modern Sunchang (see left), betrayed by his lieutenant Kim Gyeongcheon. Jeon suspected Kim had betrayed him and leaped out of the two-story house holding his musket. However, the house was surrounded by governmental soldiers, and he was hit many times with large sticks, causing him to break his legs. Jeon was imprisoned and taken to Seoul. Kim Gyeongcheon went into hiding because he feared that the rebels would kill him. Trials were not held because the government wanted to immediately put Jeon, Son Hwa-jung, Choe Gyeong-Seon, and Kim Deokmyeong on trial. (these four, along with Kim Gae-Nam, are known as the Five Donghak Generals)

Also, by December, the Anti-Japanese Frontier had been pushed down to the southern coast of Korea. On 7 December, the Japanese finally killed Kim Inbae, the Great Jeobju of Geumgu, who had aided the Jinju rebels in the Battle of Gwangyang Fortress. Kim Inbae&#x27;s head was tied to a pole and displayed in Gwangyang. However, in Jangheung, the rebel leader Yi Bangeon captured Gangjin on 7 December. On 11 December, Son Hwa-jung was also arrested.

Meanwhile, the Japanese were attacking Yi Bangeon and the Jangheung rebels, forming the region&#x27;s last organized rebel army. On 15 December, the final major battle in Jeolla Province, the Battle of the Seokdae Fields, was fought between Yi Bangeon&#x27;s rebels and the Japanese. This battlefield is now one of the Four Battlefields of the Donghak Revolution. Thirty thousand rebels were present, and 2,000 were killed. As the 800 Japanese soldiers moved through Yeongam, Gangjin, Haenam, and Jindo Island, they engaged in a scorched-earth strategy, killing 600 civilians and burning villages and sacks of rice. Yi Bangeon was finally captured in Christmas 1894 and beheaded with his son in Seoul. With the death of Yi Bangeon, the rebels had been completely exterminated, except for 30 rebels who hid in Mount Daedun.

Sometime in December, Choe Gyeong-seon was also captured. On 1 January 1895, the last rebel leader, Kim Deokmyeong, was captured in Wonpyeong. The four leaders were put on trial, and Jeon Bong-jun&#x27;s testimony during the trials formed the &quot;Testimony of Jeon Bong-jun&quot;. In his testimony, Jeon emphasized that Donghak believers formed only a small fragment of the rebels, the majority being peasants seeking vengeance. However, he also explained the theology of Donghak to the court. He also denied connections with the Great Regent Heungseon.

On 29 March, the four leaders were hanged for treason. Later, Confucian scholars stole the bodies, beheaded them, and displayed the heads in public. Only Choe Gyeong-seon&#x27;s body has been identified, and the locations of the other three are unknown.

The last battle in the Donghak Revolution was the Battle of Mount Daedun on 17 February. The 30 rebels held the mountain for three days until a Japanese battalion attacked them by climbing up the rocky cliffs. Only a young child survived. However, rebels were still killed in 1895 in various ways. Those included:
* Chaining rebels together, then burying them alive in a pit
* Chaining rebels together, then drowning them in the sea. The coast was said to be littered with corpses.
* Piercing the skull with a sharp wooden stick, then burning the stick so that the brain would explode.
* Ripping apart rebels by using horses or cows
* Shredding a rebel to parts using a chariot
* Piercing the stomach with a bamboo stick
* Cutting open the chest and eating the liver and intestines
Meanwhile, the Northern leaders Choe Sihyeong and Son Byong-hi had fled after the defeat at Jonggok. In January 1898, Choe and Son escaped arrest because Kim Yeonguk had been misidentified for Choe Sihyeong. In April 1898, however, Choe was captured and put on trial. Because the government wished to execute Choe before he died of disease, the trials were speedily done. Son Byong-hi and a group of other believers attempted to free Choe by bribing the judges with land, but Choe was executed after a month. He was buried in the cemetery with a small marker saying &#x27;Donghak Ringleader Choe Sihyeong.&#x27; That night, Son and the others secretly entered the cemetery and took Choe&#x27;s body. Choe was reburied in Gwangju.

== Legacy ==

A part of the rebel requests, including the remarriage of widows and the freeing of enslaved people, was included in the Gabo Reform. However, the reform was not supported because it did not have land reform, which was the peasants&#x27; greatest need.

Many rebels later joined the Righteous Army. The 1895 Righteous Army was led by Confucian scholars who killed rebels when they attempted to enter. However, the Righteous Armies of 1905 and 1907 were almost entirely composed of rebels. For example, Yu Eunshik of Chungju killed his lieutenant when he revealed himself as a former rebel. Jeon Haesan, the most famous of the Jeolla Righteous Army leaders, was often called the &#x27;son of Jeon Bong-jun&#x27; and participated in more than 70 battles from 1905 to 1910 against the Japanese before he was hanged in 1910. However, in his &quot;War Diary of Jeon Haesan&quot;, Jeon Haesan says that he &quot;did not like to be called the &#x27;son of Jeon Nokdu&#x27;(Jeon Bong-jun&#x27;s nickname),&quot; presumably meaning he was not Jeon Bong-jun&#x27;s son. However, the current edition of the North Korean history textbook claims that &#x27;the patriotic line&#x27; descends from Jeon Changhyeok (Jeon Bong-jun&#x27;s father and Gyojo Shinwon leader) through Jeon Bong-jun to Jeon Haesan. The South Korean Ministry of Education claims that this is North Korean textbook revisionism to glorify Kim Il Sung by comparing the Kim family to the Jeon family.

Many former rebels became nationalists and independence activists. The tiger hunter Hong Beomdo, whom Donghak influenced, became a guerrilla leader of Manchuria. Kim Gu the &#x27;Baby Jeobju,&#x27; who fought at the Battle of Haeju, became a profound nationalist and one of the most respected Korean leaders.

The Donghak religion also experienced a profound change. With the death of Choe Sihyeong, Son Byong-hi became the third patriarch. To escape persecution as &#x27;rebels,&#x27; he renamed Donghak &#x27;Cheondoism&#x27; and fully established the &#x27;Human is Hanulnim&#x27; doctrine, thus making Cheondoism a fully pantheistic religion (Choe Je-u seems to have been a panentheist). Cheondoism was legalized in 1905, but Son was imprisoned in 1919 for leading the March 1st Movement and died in prison. Son&#x27;s son-in-law, Bang Jeonghwan, was also a Cheondoist who became a famous child activist and founded the Children&#x27;s Day in Korea. The artist Suh Yong-sun drew a work titled &quot;Donghak Peasant Revolution&quot; on canvas using acrylic paint.

== Controversies ==

=== Role played by Donghak ===
There is an ongoing controversy about the naming of the revolution, connected to the exact role that the Donghak religion played in the revolution. Theories include:
# The revolution was fundamentally based on the Donghak religion and should thus be called the &#x27;Donghak Rebellion&#x27; or the &#x27;Donghak Revolution.&#x27; This argument is based on the fact that every pre-1922 source called the &#x27;Donghak Rebellion,&#x27; and every major leader was a Jeobju or Poju. This was the stance by South Korea when it was ruled under a military junta.
# The revolution was fundamentally based on the peasants who were suppressed by the government and should thus be called the &#x27;Peasant Rebellion of 1894&#x27;, the &#x27;Peasant Revolution of 1894&#x27;, or the &#x27;Peasant War of 1894&#x27;. This argument is based on Jeon Bong-jun&#x27;s testimony: &quot;There were many angered peasants and few Donghak.&quot; This is the official stance made by North Korea.
# The rebel leaders were Donghak believers, but the armies were aggravated peasants. They should thus be called the &#x27;Donghak Peasant Revolution,&#x27; &#x27;Donghak Peasant Rebellion,&#x27; &#x27;Donghak Peasant War,&#x27; or the &#x27;Donghak Peasant Movement.&#x27; Jeon testified, &quot;Our leaders were Donghak, but the army were peasants.&quot; This is the current South Korean position.

=== Role played by the Great Regent Heungseon ===
The role played by King Gojong&#x27;s father, the Great Regent Heungseon, is open to controversy. Jeon Bong-jun first met Heungseon in 1890 in Unhyeon Palace. Jeon lived with the Great Regent Heungseon from 1890 to 1892 and revisited him in February 1893. In the meeting, Jeon said to the Heungseon: &quot;I wish to die for the country and the people.&quot; There were many rumors that the Heungseon had secretly caused the rebellion in this meeting.

It is also said that the Heungseon (or occasionally Gojong himself) sent a messenger to Jeon after the Jeonju Truce, asking him to drive out the Japanese. This has not been confirmed. For evidence, the message of Mikhail Hitrovo, the Russian envoy to Japan who sent his message to the Russian envoy to Korea a month before the start of the revolution, is often cited:
In &quot;A History of Donghak&quot;, Oh Jiyeong claims that the Great Regent attempted a massacre of pro-Japanese politicians in August 1894, simultaneous with the time when Jeon had planned an attack on Seoul.

During his execution, Kim Gae-nam testified that Jeon had been secretly meeting the Great Regent Heungseon. However, the other four leaders refused to connect the Great Regent with the revolution.

=== Connections with Genyosha ===
The Japanese historian Seito argued that the Donghak Peasant Revolution had been backed by a Samurai group named Genyōsha, who landed in Busan on 27 June 1894. The claim is however heavily contended by Korean historians.

Seito&#x27;s account is generally regarded as pseudohistorical by Korean historians. Jeon only had 20 followers at the beginning of the Gobu Revolt, compared with 600 in Seito&#x27;s account. Also, Seito&#x27;s list of battles and Jeon Bong-jun&#x27;s account in the &quot;Jeon Bong-jun Gongcho&quot; are different. Additionally, Seito records that an alliance of rebels and Genyosha defeated governmental forces from June to August, in which Jeon would install &quot;Jibgangso&quot; agencies. However, certain Korean historians such as Yi Yihwa and Japanese historians generally regard Saito&#x27;s account to be partially valid, especially as there was a large body of Japanese soldiers in Korea at the time.

In &quot;The Founding of Cheondoism&quot;, it is recorded that two Japanese men named Danaka Jiro and Dakeda Hanshi and their fifteen followers, holding dynamite, gave Jeon a gold watch and a horse and had a council with Jeon, which was done not with translation but by using written sentences (both knew Chinese characters). The Japanese asked Jeon to ally with Japan and drive out China to make Korea genuinely independent. Later, in 1895, Danaka attempted to free the imprisoned Jeon and take him to Japan, but Jeon refused, calling Japan &quot;my enemy&quot; and saying, &quot;It is not my purpose to seek my petty life through the hands of an enemy.&quot; He also said, &quot;I am your enemy, and you are my enemy.&quot; 
However, Jeon also asked the Genyosha to attempt to protect the rebels from execution.

The Great Regent Heungseon has hired ronin, or former Samurai, to kill political enemies. It has also been speculated that it was Genyosha members who killed Empress Myeongseong, the last queen of Korea.

=== War crimes by Donghak rebels ===
The Donghak rebels committed heinous war crimes out of vengeance against the ruling castes. Due to the violent nature of the rebellion, Choi has denied his direct involvement to Jeon and the peasant rebels. The war crimes are not only limited to arson and pillages, but also included frequent rapes and torture. This was well recorded in Ohagimun, which was written by Hwang Hyeon, a late Joseon scholar.

== In popular culture ==

=== Folk songs ===
The Donghak Peasant Revolution gave way to various folk songs. The most famous is the &quot;Oh Bird, Oh Bird, Oh Roller&quot; (the &#x27;roller&#x27; being mentioned is the oriental dollarbird).

In this song, the &#x27;roller&#x27; are the Japanese soldiers (who wore blue uniforms). The &#x27;Nokdu Fields&#x27; is Jeon Bong-jun, and &#x27;When the Nokdu Flower Falls&#x27; is the execution of Jeon Bong-jun. The &#x27;jelly sellers&#x27; are the peasants of Korea. &#x27;Summer&#x27; refers to the &quot;Hucheon&quot;, the Donghak concept of Paradise, and &#x27;winter&#x27; refers to the persecution of the rebels. &#x27;Why did you come out&#x27; refers to the peasants&#x27; anger at foreign intervention. This song is sung all over Korea and seems to have been first sung at the execution of Jeon. There are many versions of this song, with different lyrics.

Another song was sung in September, at the revolution&#x27;s zenith, but was soon forgotten after the fall of the rebels. This contrasts the &quot;Oh Bird, Oh Bird, Oh Roller&quot; above.

This is a wordplay. The first line, &#x27;Gabo,&#x27; can mean &#x27;Let us go&#x27; and &#x27;1894&#x27;. &#x27;Eulmi&#x27; refers to &#x27;slow&#x27; and &#x27;1895&#x27;, and &#x27;Byeongshin&#x27; refers to &#x27;Destruction&#x27; and &#x27;1896&#x27;. This song&#x27;s literal meaning is &#x27;Let us go in 1894, for if we do not win by 1895, we shall be destroyed by 1896.&#x27;

==== Son Hwa-Jung and the Buddha&#x27;s Navel ====
The Dosol Cliff Buddha has been connected to Son Hwa-jung and the rebels, and the legend surrounding it appears in the 1940 &quot;History of Donghak&quot;, meaning that the legend was already existent at the time. It is one of the few legends relating to the Donghak Peasant Revolution.

Later stories claim that the parchment in question was a secret guideline on revolutions that was written by Jeong Yakyong, a Silhak scholar, and that Jeon Bong-jun modeled the revolution after the book. Others claim that the parchment&#x27;s destiny was to bring the downfall of the Joseon Dynasty.

The current Dosol Cliff Buddha has a squarely shaped hole in place of the navel.

=== Film ===

Fly High Run Far, a 1991 South Korean film directed by Im Kwon-taek, tells about the Revolution.

Nokdu Flower, a historical drama of SBS in 2019, directed and written by Shin Kyung-soo, Jung Hyun-Min, tells about Baek Yi-kang (this is an unreal character in history) join in Donghak Peasant Revolution.

<text>José Hernández (born José Rafael Hernández y Pueyrredón; 10 November 1834 in Chacras del Perdriel – 21 October 1886 in Buenos Aires) was an Argentine journalist, poet, and politician best known as the author of the epic poem &quot;Martín Fierro&quot;. In his tribute, his birthday is celebrated as a national argentinian holiday, called Tradition Day.

== Biography ==
Hernández, whose ancestry was Spanish, was born on a farm near San Martín (Buenos Aires Province). His father was a majordomo or foreman of a series of cattle ranches. His career was to be an alternation between stints on the &quot;Federal&quot; side in the civil wars of Argentina and Uruguay and life as a newspaperman, a short stint as an employee of a commercial firm, and a period as stenographer to the legislature of the Confederation.

Hernández founded the newspaper &quot;El Río de la Plata&quot;, which advocated local autonomy, abolition of the conscripted &quot;frontier contingents&quot;, and election of justices of the peace, military commanders, and school boards. He opposed immigration because he believed it undermined the pastoral foundation of the region&#x27;s wealth. He envisioned a federal republic based in pastoralism, but also featuring a strong system of education and a literate population.

Although a federalist opposed to the centralizing, modernizing, and Europeanizing tendencies of Argentine president Domingo Sarmiento, Hernández was no apologist for General Juan Manuel de Rosas, whom he characterized as a tyrant and a despot.

Hernández is known today almost exclusively for his masterpiece &quot;Martín Fierro&quot;, the epic poem that stands as the pinnacle of gauchesque literature. The poem was apparently begun during a period of exile in Brazil following the defeat at Ñaembé (1870) and was published in two parts (in 1872 and 1879).

Hernández died of heart disease on 21 October 1886, in Belgrano, which was at that time a separate suburb, and is currently a neighborhood of the city of Buenos Aires. He was buried in La Recoleta Cemetery in Buenos Aires.

<doc id="387127" wikidata="Q27074644" url="?curid=387127" title="American purple gallinule">
<text>The purple gallinule (Porphyrio martinica) is a swamphen in the genus &quot;Porphyrio&quot;. It is in the order Gruiformes, meaning &quot;crane-like&quot;, an order which also contains cranes, rails, and crakes. The purple gallinule is a rail species, placing it into the family Rallidae. It is also known locally as the yellow-legged gallinule. The specific name &quot;martinica&quot; denotes &quot;of Martinique&quot;.

==Description==
The purple gallinule is a medium-sized rail, measuring in length, spanning across the wings and weighing . Males, averaging in mass, are slightly larger than females, at on average. An adult purple gallinule has purple-blue plumage that will shine green and turquoise when in good lighting. Adults also have a pale blue shield on their forehead, which connects with the red and yellow bill. Darkness or low light can dim the bright purple-blue plumage of the adult to make them look dusky or brownish, although the forehead shield color differentiates them from similar species such as common gallinules. Immature purple gallinules are a brown-bronze color, with purple feathers on chest, and the bill and forehead shield is pale in color. Juvenile birds are light brown with hints of green-bronze on the wings and back, and white under-tail coverts.

Purple gallinules have long toes that help them walk onto floating vegetation, by distributing their weight across a large surface area. They have an anisodactyl toe arrangement that also helps them to cling to plant stems. Adults have bright yellow legs and feet, immatures have brown-yellowish legs and feet, and juveniles have brown legs and feet. When they fly, their legs hang down. They usually fly short distances.

==Distribution and habitat==
These birds are found in the southeastern states of the United States during the breeding season. They are resident species in southern Florida, the Gulf and Pacific coast of Mexico, parts of Central America, and the Caribbean. During the non-breeding season, they are found more inland in parts of Central America. They can also be found within South America during migration, and sometimes strays can be found as far north as Canada. The species&#x27; habitat is freshwater marsh with dense stands of vegetation.

The species has the greatest pattern of vagrancy amongst rails, with individuals recorded as far west as California and the Galápagos Islands, as far north as Iceland and Labrador, as far south as Tierra del Fuego, and as far east as Great Britain, Portugal and Cape Verde.

This species has been recorded in the Cape Province of South Africa twenty-one times. Most of the birds were juveniles, so it is very unlikely that a breeding ground will be established there.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Breeding===
The courtship of purple gallinules occurs while they are standing and can be displayed by both sexes. Courtship occurs when the birds of a pair have been separated and then wander close to one another. They then perform the principal display, which is performed by both sexes at the same time. The display entails the bird standing in a slightly bent forward position, with the neck outstretched. The wings are held at an almost right angle to the body and bent at the wrist, so that the primaries are angled down. Following the principal display, one or both of the birds will strut and cut across the path of the other with half-lowered wings, or they will make a deep bow as they approach each other.

The floating nest is placed within the dense vegetation along the shallow margins of lakes, rivers, and marshes&#x27; shorelines. They lay between five and ten eggs that are buff or pale pink with brown and purple spots. Purple gallinules&#x27; nest and territories are defended by the monogamous pair, and the juveniles remain in the territory to help care for siblings. 

===Food and feeding===
Purple gallinules are omnivorous ground feeders. There is a variety of plant and animal matter within their diet. Some of the foods they consume are seeds, leaves and fruits of both aquatic and terrestrial plants, insects, insect larvae, spiders, other invertebrates, frogs, snails, earthworms, and fish. They have also been known to prey upon the eggs and young of other bird species, such as the jacana.

<doc id="387128" wikidata="Q269995" url="?curid=387128" title="Adélaïde d'Orléans">
<text>Louise Marie Adélaïde Eugénie d&#x27;Orléans (23 August 1777 – 31 December 1847) was a French princess, one of the daughters of Philippe d&#x27;Orléans, known as &quot;Philippe Égalité&quot; during the French Revolution, and Louise Marie Adélaïde de Bourbon. She was titled &quot;Mademoiselle de Chartres&quot; at birth, &quot;Mademoiselle d&#x27;Orléans&quot; at the death of her older twin sister in 1782, &quot;Mademoiselle&quot; (1783–1812), &quot;Madame Adélaïde&quot; (1830). As a member of the reigning House of Bourbon, she was a &quot;princesse du sang&quot;.

== Biography ==

Adélaïde and her older twin sister Françoise were born at the Palais Royal on 23 August 1777 to Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans and Louise Marie Adélaïde de Bourbon. Françoise died in 1782, aged four. She was raised according to the liberal principles of her governess, Madame de Genlis, principles which also became her own political conviction. She received an excellent but also very hard and strenuous education; to harden herself, she learned to sleep on a hard bed and arise at six every day. She was deeply attached to her governess, and her mother&#x27;s demand that de Genlis be replaced, though without success, was reportedly a cause of great worry for her. She was considered for marriage to the Duke of Angoulême, but the plans were prevented by queen Marie Antoinette. Later on, she was also considered for marriage to the Duke of Berry, which did not materialise either.

During the French Revolution, de Genlis on at least one occasion took her to the radical Cordelieres Club. In 1791, her father asked de Genlis to take her to England for her safety. The year after, he summoned them back to prevent Adelaide&#x27;s name from being placed on the list of émigrés. When they arrived, however, de Genlis discovered that Adélaïde was already on the list and that her father, whose political situation had deteriorated, asked her to take Adélaïde out of the country again.

Adelaide received painting lessons from Pierre-Joseph Redouté and produced some highly regarded botanical studies as a result.

===Life in exile===

In 1792, she left France with de Genlis to the Austrian Netherlands and then to Switzerland, where she was placed in a convent in Bremgarten. During the Terror her father was guillotined, and her mother was banished to Spain. Sometime in the spring of 1794, Adélaïde moved to the home of her aunt, the Princess of Conti. They moved to Bavaria in 1798 and thereafter to Bratislava, and in 1801, she joined her mother in Barcelona in Spain. Her relationship with her mother was not good, as she disapproved of her mother&#x27;s relationship with chancellor de Folmont.

On 25 November 1809, she and her mother attended the wedding of her brother Louis Philippe to Maria Amalia of Naples and Sicily in Palermo on Sicily. After the wedding, she did not return with her mother to Spain, but preferred to live with her brother and sister-in-law at Palazzo Orléans in Palermo. She was described as completely devoted to her brother and his family: united with her sister-in-law in their mutual love and concern for him, and a second mother to his children.

===Return to France===
After the fall of Napoleon in 1814, she returned with her brother and his family to Paris and settled with them in Palais-Royal. During the Bourbon Restoration, Palais-Royal was described as a center of high society social life in the capital, and reportedly, despite the fact that custom dictated that she as an unmarried &quot;spinster&quot; was expected to live in the background, it was she rather than her more reserved sister-in-law who took the role of hostess.

She was described as firm, intellectual, and frank, and she was a leading force in the family councils of the House of Orléans. Her loyalty to her brother has been described as due to the fact that, early separated from her family, she was treated with reserve during her exile because of the political actions of her father during the revolution, and her brother was the first person she could lavish her affection upon. Louis Philippe, in turn, relied upon her intelligence and loyalty, made her his confidant and listened to her advice, and consequently, she came to exert great political influence upon him. Being brought up a liberal, she supported the idea of a constitutional monarchy and a representative government.

She was not on good terms with the reigning Bourbon family; because of their reactionary ideas, and also because the hostility shown by them toward the Orléans line, and to her particularly by Marie Thérèse of France. Adélaïde rather than her brother are described as the active head of the Orléans fraction, and she had the active desire and ambition to make him monarch. In her apartment at Palais-Royal, she hosted a salon which became the center of liberal opposition toward the regime, and by use of her great personal fortune, she supported the liberal press and various political actors, artists, intellectuals and influential figures to gather support for her brother, among them Talleyrand.

===July Monarchy===
When Louis-Philippe became King of the French in the reign known as the July Monarchy (1830–1848), she was known as &quot;Madame Adélaïde&quot;. All her life, she was his loyal advisor or, in 19th century parlance, his &quot;Egeria&quot;. It was she who, reportedly, encouraged him to accept the crown during the July Revolution, and her influence continued undisturbed during his reign. When tumult followed the publication of the Ordinances in 1830 and erupted in the July revolution in Paris, the Orléans family was at the country estate Neuilly.

Adélaïde convinced Louis-Philippe that the moment was right for him to place himself as the leader of the opposition against the absolute monarchy of Charles X, and present himself as the candidate of a constitutional monarchy, in between the unpopular absolute monarchy and the republicanism. In this, she defeated the view of her sister-in-law Maria Amalia, who was loyal to the reigning older branch. When rumors arrived that the royalists were going to arrest Louis-Philippe, he evacuated to Raincy and the children were sent to Villiers-Coterets, but Adélaïde and Maria Amalia remained at Neuilly. When a delegation reached Neuilly and offered Louis-Philippe the crown, Maria Amalia refused the offer on behalf of herself and her spouse as an insult, reproaching Scheffer and Thiers for insulting them by having made it. Adélaïde, however, accepted it with the argument that her brother would do anything to prevent the country he loved from anarchy. Thiers accepted the answer of Adélaïde rather than the one from Maria Amalia with the words: &quot;Madame, you have given the crown to your family&quot;. After this, several other visits followed from people asking Louis-Philippe to accept the crown: to all, Maria Amalia answered that Louis-Philippe was an honest man and thus could not do it, while Adélaïde contradicted her by stating, that the offer should be made to Louis-Philippe by the chamber of deputies; and if he should hesitate, she would herself go to Paris and accept the crown for him. Soon after, the Chamber of Deputies called Louis-Philippe to Paris to formally present him their offer. It has been estimated that he accepted the crown largely because of Adélaïde.

At 6 August 1830, she and her sister-in-law were present at the tribune on the ceremony at the chambers in Paris when Louis Philippe was declared King of the French. She and her sister-in-law visited those who had been wounded during the revolution, and supported them financially. 
In October 1830, a mob broke into the Palais-Royal, and repeated attempts were made to execute the ministers of the former regime, which was refused by Louis-Philippe. When marshal Gerard remarked that it would be difficult to save them, she replied: &quot;Well Monsieur, then we will all perish in the attempt&quot;. During his reign, Louis-Philippe visited her daily, discussed the matters of state and family with her, and followed her advice. Her death was therefore regarded as a great loss not only on an emotional but also a political scale.

Adélaïde d&#x27;Orléans died on 31 December 1847, two months before Louis Philippe&#x27;s abdication on 24 February 1848. She is buried in the Orléans family necropolis in the Royal Chapel of Dreux.

<doc id="387135" wikidata="Q1285723" url="?curid=387135" title="Saturn (rocket family)">
<text>The Saturn family of American rockets was developed by a team of former German rocket engineers and scientists led by Wernher von Braun to launch heavy payloads to Earth orbit and beyond. The Saturn family used liquid hydrogen as fuel in the upper stages. Originally proposed as a military satellite launcher, they were adopted as the launch vehicles for the Apollo Moon program. Three versions were built and flown: the medium-lift Saturn I, the heavy-lift Saturn IB, and the super heavy-lift Saturn V.

Von Braun proposed the Saturn name in October 1958 as a logical successor to the Jupiter series as well as the Roman god&#x27;s powerful position.

In 1963, President John F. Kennedy identified the Saturn I SA-5 launch as being the point where US lift capability would surpass the Soviets, after having been behind since Sputnik. He last mentioned this in a speech given at Brooks Air Force Base in San Antonio on the day before he was assassinated.

To date, the Saturn V is the only launch vehicle from the Apollo Space Program (Artemis Program)to transport human beings beyond low Earth orbit. A total of 24 humans were flown to the Moon in the four years spanning December 1968 through December 1972. No Saturn rocket failed catastrophically in flight, except on the pad during the Apollo 1 test flight, when a fire ignited in the crew module, burning alive and killing all the astronauts.

==Summary of variants==
All the Saturn family rockets are listed here by date of introduction.

==History==

===Early development===
In the early 1950s, the US Navy and US Army actively developed long-range missiles with the help of German rocket engineers who were involved in developing the successful V-2 during the Second World War. These missiles included the Navy&#x27;s Viking, and the Army&#x27;s Corporal, Jupiter and Redstone. Meanwhile, the US Air Force developed its Atlas and Titan missiles, relying more on American engineers.

Infighting among the various branches was constant, with the United States Department of Defense (DoD) deciding which projects to fund for development. On November 26, 1956, Defense Secretary Charles E. Wilson issued a memorandum stripping the Army of offensive missiles with a range of or greater, and turning their Jupiter missiles over to the Air Force. From that point on, the Air Force would be the primary missile developer, especially for dual-use missiles that could also be used as space launch vehicles.

In late 1956, the Department of Defense released a requirement for a heavy-lift vehicle to orbit a new class of communications and &quot;other&quot; satellites (the spy satellite program was top secret). The requirements, drawn up by the then-unofficial Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), called for a vehicle capable of putting 9,000 to 18,000 kilograms into orbit, or accelerating 2,700 to 5,400 kg to escape velocity.

Since the Wilson memorandum covered only weapons, not space vehicles, the Army Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA) saw this as a way to continue the development of their own large-rocket projects. In April 1957, von Braun directed Heinz-Hermann Koelle, chief of the Future Projects design branch, to study dedicated launch vehicle designs that could be built as quickly as possible. Koelle evaluated a variety of designs for missile-derived launchers that could place a maximum of about 1,400 kg in orbit, but might be expanded to as much as 4,500 kg with new high-energy upper stages. In any event, these upper stages would not be available until 1961 or 1962 at the earliest, and the launchers would still not meet the DoD requirements for heavy loads.

In order to fill the projected need for loads of 10,000 kg or greater, the ABMA team calculated that a booster (first stage) with a thrust of about thrust would be needed, far greater than any existing or planned missile. For this role they proposed using a number of existing missiles clustered together to produce a single larger booster; using existing designs they looked at combining tankage from one Jupiter as a central core, with eight Redstone diameter tanks attached to it. This relatively cheap configuration allowed existing fabrication and design facilities to be used to produce this &quot;quick and dirty&quot; design.

Two approaches to building the Super-Jupiter were considered; the first used multiple engines to reach the mark, the second used a single much larger engine. Both approaches had their own advantages and disadvantages. Building a smaller engine for clustered use would be a relatively low-risk path from existing systems, but required duplication of systems and made the possibility of a stage failure much higher (adding engines generally reduces reliability, as per Lusser&#x27;s law). A single larger engine would be more reliable, and would offer higher performance because it eliminated duplication of &quot;dead weight&quot; like propellant plumbing and hydraulics for steering the engines. On the downside, an engine of this size had never been built before and development would be expensive and risky. The Air Force had recently expressed an interest in such an engine, which would develop into the famed F-1, but at the time they were aiming for and the engines would not be ready until the mid-1960s. The engine-cluster appeared to be the only way to meet the requirements on time and budget.

Super-Jupiter was the first-stage booster only; to place payloads in orbit, additional upper stages would be needed. ABMA proposed using either the Titan or Atlas as a second stage, optionally with the new Centaur upper-stage. The Centaur had been proposed by General Dynamics (Astronautics Corp.) as an upper stage for the Atlas (also their design) in order to quickly produce a launcher capable of placing loads up to into low Earth orbit. The Centaur was based on the same &quot;balloon tank&quot; concept as the Atlas, and built on the same jigs at the same diameter. As the Titan was deliberately built at the same size as well, this meant the Centaur could be used with either missile. Given that the Atlas was the higher priority of the two ICBM projects and its production was fully accounted for, ABMA focused on &quot;backup&quot; design, Titan, although they proposed extending it in length in order to carry additional fuel.

In December 1957, ABMA delivered &quot;Proposal: A National Integrated Missile and Space Vehicle Development Program&quot; to the DoD, detailing their clustered approach. They proposed a booster consisting of a Jupiter missile airframe surrounded by eight Redstones acting as tankage, a thrust plate at the bottom, and four Rocketdyne E-1 engines, each having of thrust. The ABMA team also left the design open to future expansion with a single engine, which would require relatively minor changes to the design. The upper stage was the lengthened Titan, with the Centaur on top. The result was a very tall and skinny rocket, quite different from the Saturn that eventually emerged.

Specific uses were forecast for each of the military services, including navigation satellites for the Navy; reconnaissance, communications, and meteorological satellites for the Army and Air Force; support for Air Force crewed missions; and surface-to-surface logistics supply for the Army at distances up to 6400 km. Development and testing of the lower stage stack were projected to be completed by 1963, about the same time that the Centaur should become available for testing in combination. The total development cost of $850 million during the years 1958-1963 covered 30 research and development flights.

===Sputnik stuns the world===

While the Super-Jupiter program was being drawn up, preparations were underway for the first satellite launch as the US contribution to the International Geophysical Year in 1957. For complex political reasons, the program had been given to the US Navy under Project Vanguard. The Vanguard launcher consisted of a Viking lower stage combined with new uppers adapted from sounding rockets. ABMA provided valuable support on Viking and Vanguard, both with their first-hand knowledge of the V-2, as well as developing its guidance system. The first three Vanguard suborbital test flights had gone off without a hitch, starting in December 1956, and a launch was planned for late 1957.

On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union surprised the world with the launch of Sputnik I. Although there had been some indications that the Soviets were working towards this goal, few in the U.S. military and scientific establishment considered these efforts seriously.

When asked in November 1954 about the possibility of the Soviets launching a satellite, Defense Secretary Wilson replied: &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t care if they did.&quot; The public did not see it the same way, however, and the event was a major public relations disaster for the US. Vanguard was planned to launch shortly after Sputnik, but a series of delays pushed this into December, when the rocket exploded in spectacular fashion. The press was harsh, referring to the project as &quot;Kaputnik&quot; or &quot;Project Rearguard&quot;. As &quot;Time&quot; magazine noted at the time:

:But in the midst of the cold war, Vanguard&#x27;s cool scientific goal proved to be disastrously modest: the Russians got there first. The post-Sputnik White House explanation that the U.S. was not in a satellite &quot;race&quot; with Russia was not just an after-the-fact alibi. Said Dr. Hagen ten months ago: &quot;We are not attempting in any way to race with the Russians&quot;. But in the eyes of the world, the U.S. was in a satellite race whether it wanted to be or not, and because of the Administration&#x27;s costly failure of imagination, Project Vanguard shuffled along when it should have been running. It was still shuffling when Sputnik&#x27;s beeps told the world that Russia&#x27;s satellite program, not the U.S.&#x27;s, was the vanguard.

Von Braun responded to Sputnik I&#x27;s launch by claiming he could have a satellite in orbit within 90 days of being given a go-ahead. His plan was to combine the existing Jupiter C rocket (confusingly, a Redstone adaptation, not a Jupiter) with the solid-fuel engines from the Vanguard, producing the Juno I. There was no immediate response while everyone waited for Vanguard to launch, but the continued delays in Vanguard and the November launch of Sputnik II resulted in the go-ahead being given that month. Von Braun kept his promise with the successful launch of Explorer I on 1 February 1958. Vanguard was finally successful on March 17, 1958.

===ARPA selects Juno===

Concerned that the Soviets continued to surprise the U.S. with technologies that seemed beyond their capabilities, the DoD studied the problem and concluded that it was primarily bureaucratic. As all of the branches of the military had their own research and development programs, there was considerable duplication and inter-service fighting for resources. Making matters worse, the DoD imposed its own Byzantine procurement and contracting rules, adding considerable overhead. To address these concerns, the DoD initiated the formation of a new research and development group focused on launch vehicles and given wide discretionary powers that cut across traditional Army/Navy/Air Force lines. The group was given the job of catching up to the Soviets in space technology as quickly as possible, using whatever technology it could, regardless of the origin. Formalized as Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) on February 7, 1958, the group examined the DoD launcher requirements and compared the various approaches that were currently available.

At the same time that ABMA was drawing up the Super-Jupiter proposal, the Air Force was in the midst of working on their Titan C concept. The Air Force had gained valuable experience working with liquid hydrogen on the Lockheed CL-400 Suntan spy plane project and felt confident in their ability to use this volatile fuel for rockets. They had already accepted Krafft Ehricke&#x27;s arguments that hydrogen was the only practical fuel for upper stages, and started the Centaur project based on the strength of these arguments. Titan C was a hydrogen-burning intermediate stage that would normally sit between the Titan lower and Centaur upper, or could be used without the Centaur for low-Earth orbit missiles like Dyna-Soar. However, as hydrogen is much less dense than &quot;traditional&quot; fuels then in use, especially kerosene, the upper stage would have to be fairly large in order to hold enough fuel. As the Atlas and Titan were both built at 120&quot; diameters it would make sense to build Titan C at this diameter as well, but this would result in an unwieldy tall and skinny rocket with dubious strength and stability. Instead, Titan C proposed building the new stage at a larger 160&quot; diameter, meaning it would be an entirely new rocket.

In comparison, the Super-Jupiter design was based on off-the-shelf components, with the exception of the E-1 engines. Although it too relied on the Centaur for high-altitude missions, the rocket was usable for low-Earth orbit without Centaur, which offered some flexibility in case Centaur ran into problems. ARPA agreed that the Juno proposal was more likely to meet the timeframes required, although they felt that there was no strong reason to use the E-1, and recommended a lower-risk approach here as well. ABMA responded with a new design, the Juno V (as a continuation of the Juno I and Juno II series of rockets, while Juno III and IV were unbuilt Atlas- and Titan-derived concepts), which replaced the four E-1 engines with eight H-1s, a much more modest upgrade of the existing S-3D already used on the Thor and Jupiter missiles, raising thrust from 150,000 to 188,000 lbf (670 to 840 kN). It was estimated that this approach would save as much as $60 million in development and cut as much as two years of R&amp;D time.

Happy with the results of the redesign, on August 15, 1958, ARPA issued Order Number 14-59 that called on ABMA to:

:Initiate a development program to provide a large space vehicle booster of approximately 1 500 000-lb. thrust based on a cluster of available rocket engines. The immediate goal of this program is to demonstrate a full-scale captive dynamic firing by the end of CY 1959.

This was followed on September 11, 1958, with another contract with Rocketdyne to start work on the H-1. On September 23, 1958, ARPA and the Army Ordnance Missile Command (AOMC) drew up an additional agreement enlarging the scope of the program, stating &quot;In addition to the captive dynamic firing..., it is hereby agreed that this program should now be extended to provide for a propulsion flight test of this booster by approximately September 1960&quot;. Further, they wanted ABMA to produce three additional boosters, the last two of which would be &quot;capable of placing limited payloads in orbit.&quot;

By this point, many in the ABMA group were already referring to the design as Saturn, as von Braun explained it as a reference to the planet after Jupiter. The name change became official in February 1959.

===NASA involvement===

In addition to ARPA, various groups within the US government had been considering the formation of a civilian agency to handle space exploration. After the Sputnik launch, these efforts gained urgency and were quickly moved forward. NASA was formed on July 29, 1958, and immediately set about studying the problem of crewed space flight, and the launchers needed to work in this field. One goal, even in this early stage, was a crewed lunar mission. At the time, the NASA panels felt that the direct ascent mission profile was the best approach; this placed a single very large spacecraft in orbit, which was capable of flying to the Moon, landing and returning to Earth. To launch such a large spacecraft, a new booster with much greater power would be needed; even the Saturn was not nearly large enough. NASA started examining a number of potential rocket designs under their Nova program.

NASA was not alone in studying crewed lunar missions. Von Braun had always expressed an interest in this goal, and had been studying what would be required for a lunar mission for some time. ABMA&#x27;s Project Horizon proposed using fifteen Saturn launches to carry up spacecraft components and fuel that would be assembled in orbit to build a single very large lunar craft. This Earth orbit rendezvous mission profile required the least amount of booster capacity &quot;per launch&quot;, and was thus able to be carried out using the existing rocket design. This would be the first step towards a small crewed base on the moon, which would require several additional Saturn launches every month to supply it.

The Air Force had also started their Lunex Project in 1958, also with a goal of building a crewed lunar outpost. Like NASA, Lunex favored the direct ascent mode, and therefore required much larger boosters. As part of the project, they designed an entirely new rocket series known as the Space Launcher System, or SLS (not to be confused with the Space Launch System part of the Artemis program), which combined a number of solid-fuel boosters with either the Titan missile or a new custom booster stage to address a wide variety of launch weights. The smallest SLS vehicle consisted of a Titan and two strap-on solids, giving it performance similar to Titan C, allowing it to act as a launcher for Dyna-Soar. The largest used much larger solid-rockets and a much-enlarged booster for their direct ascent mission. Combinations in-between these extremes would be used for other satellite launching duties.

===Silverstein Committee===

A government commission, the &quot;Saturn Vehicle Evaluation Committee&quot; (better known as the Silverstein Committee), was assembled to recommend specific directions that NASA could take with the existing Army program. The committee recommended the development of new, hydrogen-burning upper stages for the Saturn, and outlined eight different configurations for heavy-lift boosters ranging from very low-risk solutions making heavy use of existing technology, to designs that relied on hardware that had not been developed yet, including the proposed new upper stage. The configurations were:

==== Saturn A ====
*A-1 – Saturn lower stage, Titan second stage, and Centaur third stage (von Braun&#x27;s original concept).
*A-2 – Saturn lower stage, proposed clustered Jupiter second stage, and Centaur third stage.

==== Saturn B ====
*B-1 – Saturn lower stage, proposed clustered Titan second stage, proposed S-IV third stage and Centaur fourth stage.

==== Saturn C ====
*C-1 – Saturn lower stage, proposed S-IV second stage (similar to the actual Saturn I).
*C-2 – Saturn lower stage, proposed S-II second stage, proposed S-IV third stage.
*C-3, C-4, and C-5 – all based on different variations of a new lower stage using F-1 engines, variations of proposed S-II second stages, and proposed S-IV third stages (with C-5 being similar to the actual Saturn V).
Contracts for the development of a new hydrogen-burning engine were given to Rocketdyne in 1960 and for the development of the Saturn IV stage to Douglas the same year.

===Launch history===

==Apollo program==
The challenge that President John F. Kennedy put to NASA in May 1961 to put an astronaut on the Moon by the end of the decade put a sudden new urgency on the Saturn program. That year saw a flurry of activity as different means of reaching the Moon were evaluated.

Both the Nova and Saturn rockets, which shared a similar design and could share some parts, were evaluated for the mission. However, it was judged that the Saturn would be easier to get into production, since many of the components were designed to be air-transportable. Nova would require new factories for all the major stages, and there were serious concerns that they could not be completed in time. Saturn required only one new factory, for the largest of the proposed lower stages, and was selected primarily for that reason.

The Saturn C-5 (later given the name Saturn V), the most powerful of the Silverstein Committee&#x27;s configurations, was selected as the most suitable design. At the time the mission mode had not been selected, so they chose the most powerful booster design in order to ensure that there would be ample power. Selection of the lunar orbit rendezvous method reduced the launch weight requirements below those of the Nova, into the C-5&#x27;s range.

At this point, however, all three stages existed only on paper, and it was realized that it was very likely that the actual lunar spacecraft would be developed and ready for testing long before the booster. NASA, therefore, decided to also continue development of the C-1 (later Saturn I) as a test vehicle, since its lower stage was based on existing technology (Redstone and Jupiter tankage) and its upper stage was already in development. This would provide valuable testing for the S-IV as well as a launch platform for capsules and other components in low earth orbit.

The members of the Saturn family that were actually built were:
* Saturn I – ten rockets flew: five development flights, and five launches of boilerplate Apollo spacecraft and Pegasus micrometeoroid satellites.
* Saturn IB – nine launches; a refined version of the Saturn I with a more powerful first stage (designated the S-IB) and using the Saturn V&#x27;s S-IVB as a second stage. These carried the first Apollo flight crew, plus three Skylab and one Apollo-Soyuz crews, into Earth orbit.
* Saturn V – 13 launches; the Moon rocket that sent Apollo astronauts to the Moon, and carried the Skylab space station into orbit.

<doc id="387139" wikidata="Q1352007" url="?curid=387139" title="José Alfredo Jiménez">
<text>José Alfredo Jiménez Sandoval (; 19 January 1926 – 23 November 1973) was a Mexican singer-songwriter, whose songs are regarded as the basis of modern Regional Mexican music and Rancheras.

==Early life==
Jiménez was born in Dolores Hidalgo, Guanajuato, Mexico. His father died when he was ten years old, and his mother moved the family to Mexico City. Jiménez worked from a young age to help support his family. He took a job as a waiter at a Yucatacan restaurant in Santa María de la Ribera named La Sirena. While working there, he started writing songs and singing with a group called Los Rebeldes.

== Career ==
The singer Miguel Aceves Mejía claims to have discovered him from Los Rebeldes. According to Mejía, Jiménez did not play an instrument and did not even know the Spanish word for &quot;waltz&quot; or what keys his songs were in. Following Mejía&#x27;s instruction, Jiménez auditioned at the Radio Station XEW&#x27;s &quot;Amanecer Ranchero&quot; together with the Mariachi Vargas and Rubén Fuentes. Jiménez performed a cappella, including his song &quot;Ella&quot;. Don Miguel subsequently recorded &quot;Ella, &quot;Yo&quot;, &quot;Serenata huasteca&quot; and &quot;Tu Recuerdo y yo&quot;.

After this, he composed more than 1,000 songs. Among the most famous are &quot;Yo&quot;, &quot;Me equivoqué contigo&quot;, &quot;Ella&quot;, &quot;Paloma querida&quot;, &quot;Que se me acabe la Vida &quot;, &quot;Tú y la mentira&quot;, &quot;Media vuelta&quot;, &quot;El Rey&quot;, &quot;Sin sangre en las venas&quot;, &quot;El jinete&quot;, &quot;Si nos dejan&quot;, &quot;Amanecí en tus brazos&quot;, &quot;Llegando a ti&quot;, &quot;Tu recuerdo y yo&quot;, El hijo del pueblo&quot;, &quot;Cuando el destino&quot;, &quot;El caballo blanco&quot;, &quot;Llegó borracho el Borracho&quot; and &quot;Que te vaya bonito&quot;, as well as &quot;Camino de Guanajuato&quot;, where he sang about his home state of Guanajuato.

One of his last appearances on Mexican television occurred in 1973, just months prior to his death, where he introduced his last song, &quot;Gracias&quot;, accompanied by his wife, singer Alicia Juarez. Later, Jiménez died at the age of forty-seven years old in Mexico City on 23 November 1973 due to complications resulting from cirrhosis of the liver.

==Tribute==
Jiménez is buried in his hometown of Dolores Hidalgo, Guanajuato. His tomb, the &quot;Mausoleum of José Alfredo Jiménez&quot;, is in the shape of a traditional shawl and sombrero, much like the ones Jiménez would wear during his performances.

Son of José Alfredo Jiménez, singer José Alfredo Jiménez Medel, wrote a prologue to a 214-page book commemorating him that is titled &quot;En el último trago nos vamos&quot;. His daughter, Paloma Jiménez Gálvez, also released a book titled &quot;Es Inútil Dejar De Quererte: 50 Años Sin José Alfredo&quot; in the 37th edition of the Guadalajara International Book Fair.

His songs have been recorded by many artists, such as Selena, Miguel Aceves Mejía, Little Joe Hernández &amp; The Latinaires, and the Mexican rock group Maná. Joaquín Sabina paid homage to Jiménez with his song, &quot;Por el Bulevar de los Sueños Rotos&quot; (&quot;On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams&quot;). The country artist Luke Tan recorded a disc of his favorite Jiménez songs in Spanish, including some with English translations.

<text>Peggy Gale Fleming (born July 27, 1948) is a retired American figure skater. She is the 1968 Winter Olympic Champion in the ladies&#x27; singles, being the only American gold medalist at these Games, and a three-time World Champion (1966–1968) in the same event. Fleming has been a television commentator in figure skating for over 20 years, including at several Winter Olympic Games.

==Career==
Fleming was born and grew up in San Jose, California, the daughter of Doris Elizabeth (née Deal) and Albert Eugene Fleming, a newspaper journalist and former U.S. Marine. She began skating at age nine when her father took Peggy and her three sisters skating. In 1961, when Peggy was twelve years old, her coach William Kipp was killed in the crash of Sabena Flight 548 along with the rest of the United States figure skating team while en route to the 1961 World Figure Skating Championships. Fleming was subsequently coached by Carlo Fassi. Her unusual style led her to unprecedented success and five U.S. titles, three World titles and the gold medal at the 1968 Olympics in Grenoble, France. Philosopher Spencer Wertz called Fleming&#x27;s Olympic free skating program &quot;a watershed in the development of an artistic component of competitive skating.&quot;

Fleming&#x27;s mother selected a color for her Grenoble skating costume, chartreuse, named after the liqueur of that color produced by neighboring Carthusians in their founding monastery, which also gives the name &quot;chartreuse&quot; to the region, thereby perhaps inspiring local French audience support for Peggy&#x27;s virtually flawless performance. Her award in Grenoble was singularly important for the American athletes and the nation as a whole, for this was the only gold medal that the U.S. Olympic team won in the 1968 Winter Olympics. It signaled a return to American dominance in the sport of women&#x27;s figure skating following the unprecedented tragedy of the 1961 Sabena plane crash.

Figure skating writer and historian Ellyn Kestnbaum states that although Fleming was from a working-class background, she presented the image of &quot;well-groomed, well-disciplined...upper-class femininity.&quot; Fleming&#x27;s costumes were made by her mother; and as Kestnbaum puts it, &quot;reflected the simple elegance of classic lines.&quot; Fleming also drew upon ballet conventions, displaying &quot;graceful classical positions&quot;, as well as her use of classical music, and, encouraged by compulsory figures, an upright and a relaxed upper-body carriage. Kestnbaum recognizes, however, that Fleming&#x27;s fame advanced women&#x27;s visibility in the male-dominated sports world, which &quot;paved some steps along the way to women&#x27;s visibility in widening spheres of public life.&quot;

After becoming an Olympic champion, Fleming turned professional, performed on TV shows including five NBC specials of her own and toured with many skating shows, like Ice Capades. Fleming had also filmed a TV show in the USSR and skated to &quot;Butterfly Lovers&#x27; Violin Concerto&quot; in China. Since 1981, she has been a skating commentator for ABC Sports. In 1993, the Associated Press released results of a national sports study that ranked Fleming as the third most popular athlete in America, behind fellow Olympians Mary Lou Retton and Dorothy Hamill.

==Personal life==
On June 13, 1970, Fleming married her teenage sweetheart Greg Jenkins, a dermatologist and a former amateur figure skater. The couple have two sons, Andy (born in 1977) and Todd (born in 1988), and three grandchildren. They currently reside in Denver, Colorado.

Peggy Fleming was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1998. The cancer was detected in its early stages, and surgery was successful. She became a breast cancer activist who recommends not procrastinating and advocates for early detection.

Fleming and her husband owned and operated Fleming Jenkins Vineyards &amp; Winery in California. The winery produced close to 2,000 cases of wine a year with names as &quot;Choreography&quot; a bordeaux-style blend from Napa Valley and a &quot;Victories Rose&quot; from the San Francisco Bay Syrah. Profits from the &quot;Victories Rosé&quot; went toward charities that supported research towards breast cancer. They had a tasting room in Los Gatos, California. The winery closed in 2011.

In 1988, a Peggy Fleming all-porcelain doll was made by Franklin Mint Heirloom Porcelain Dolls.
In 2007, Fleming appeared in the movie &quot;Blades of Glory&quot; as a judge.

In 2010, Art of the Olympians produced a 30-minute documentary about Fleming. She is also an artist with works on display with the Art of the Olympians.

Along with former Olympian Vonetta Flowers, Fleming was injured and briefly hospitalized after a traffic accident while riding in U.S. Vice President Joe Biden&#x27;s motorcade at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.

== Awards and honors ==
*ABC&#x27;s &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot; Athlete of the Year, 1967.
*In 2003, Fleming was honored with the &quot;Lombardi Award of Excellence&quot; from the Vince Lombardi Cancer Foundation. The award was created to honor Coach Lombardi&#x27;s legacy, and is awarded annually to an individual who exemplifies the spirit of the Coach.

<doc id="387149" wikidata="Q129413" url="?curid=387149" title="Bulwer's petrel">
<text>Bulwer&#x27;s petrel (Bulweria bulwerii) is a small petrel in the family Procellariidae that is found in tropical and subtropical regions of the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans. It is named after the English naturalist James Bulwer.

==Taxonomy==
Bulwer&#x27;s petrel was formally described in 1828 by the naturalists Jardine and Selby who coined the binomial name &quot;Procellaria bulwerii&quot;. The specific epithet was chosen to acknowledge the artist and naturalist James Bulwer who had collected the type specimen on the island of Madeira. Bulwer&#x27;s petrel is now placed in the genus &quot;Bulweria &quot; that was introduced in 1843 by the French naturalist Charles Lucien Bonaparte. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

== Description ==
This very long-winged petrel is in length with a wingspan. It has mainly brown plumage and a long pointed tail. It has a buoyant twisting flight as it picks planktonic food items from the ocean surface.
== Distribution and habitat ==
The species has a wide distribution through tropical and subtropical regions of the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific oceans, it is a year-round resident in Cabo Verde, China, French Guiana, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mauritania, Morocco, Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, Senegal and Taiwan, it breeds in the Macaronesian Islands and continental Portugal in the Atlantic; and from eastern China and the Bonin Islands, east to the Hawaiian Islands, the Marquesas Islands, the United States Minor Outlying Islands and Kiribati in the Pacific. It is marine and highly pelagic, usually found far from land except during the breeding season. This species has been sighted in Europe as a rare vagrant to Ireland, the Netherlands, France and Italy. It has also appeared as a vagrant in North America, with rare sightings far off the coast of both California and North Carolina and Australia.

==Behaviour==
===Breeding===

Nests are built in burrows, vegetation, cliff caves/crevices, and under man-made debris and onshore driftwood. It does not excavate these burrows.

The breeding season for Bulwer&#x27;s petrel starts in April and May. When breeding, it will always return to its previous nest site and mate with its previous mate. Breeding pairs form colonies of 7,000-9,000 pairs during the breeding season.

This petrel lays a clutch of one egg, although young and inexperienced birds will occasionally lay two eggs. The egg is beige-white and usually measures . Both sexes incubate the eggs for a period of 42 to 46 days. They will also both feed the chicks.

===Feeding===
Bulwer&#x27;s petrel is highly pelagic, and rarely found near land (except during the breeding season). Its diet mainly consists of small fish (such as sardines) and squid, with some additional crustaceans (such as crabs, krill, and shrimp) and plankton.

==Threats==
In the North East Atlantic, the species is predated by cats, house rats and endemic invertebrates. Feral cats are considered a major driver of the present distribution of the species. In the Azores, breeding areas are restricted to steep cliffs to avoid cat predation. In one colony on Madeira, predation of Shearwater chicks by Madeiran wall lizards has been recorded in up to 10% of nests, though it is highly unlikely to have an impact on the species on a population level. The large colony in the Desertas Islands suffers intense human exploitation for food or fish bait, which also occurs at a lower level in other North East Atlantic sites, although not in the Salvage Islands following the declaration of the islands as a nature reserve.

The Bulwer&#x27;s petrel is thought to suffer a heightened risk of mortality from oil spills and other marine pollution, including light pollution at night. Tourism and recreational developments may reduce available habitat in breeding colonies.

<text>SMS was the lead ship of the of dreadnought battleships of the Imperial German Navy. was built by the Imperial Dockyard at Kiel, launched on 22 March 1911 and commissioned on 1 August 1912. The ship was equipped with ten guns in five twin turrets, and had a top speed of . was assigned to III Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet for the majority of World War I.

In 1913, and her sister conducted a cruise to South America and South Africa. The ship participated in most of the major fleet operations during the war. She fought at the Battle of Jutland on 31 May – 1 June 1916, during which she was hit twice and suffered negligible damage. The ship was also present during Operation Albion in the Baltic Sea in September and October 1917, and at the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight in November 1917.

During peace negotiations after the end of the war in 1918, she was interned with other ships of the High Seas Fleet at Scapa Flow. On 21 June 1919 the commander of the interned fleet, Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, ordered the fleet to be scuttled to ensure that the British would not be able to seize the ships. The wreck was raised in 1929 and broken up in Rosyth in 1930.

== Design ==
The German 1909 construction program included the last two members of the s, along with two additional dreadnoughts to be built to a new design. The primary change was intended to be the adoption of steam turbines in favor of triple-expansion steam engines used in the earlier vessels. The space savings of turbines permitted a more efficient superfiring arrangement of the main battery, along the same model as the s. The new ships&#x27; armor layout was significant improved over earlier designs; the &quot;Kaiser&quot; class was also far superior in defensive characteristics to their British counterparts of the and es, even if markedly inferior in terms of firepower.

The ship was long overall and displaced a maximum of at full load. She had a beam of and a draft of forward and aft. was powered by three sets of Parsons turbines, supplied with steam by sixteen coal-fired water-tube boilers. The powerplant produced a top speed of . She carried of coal, which enabled a maximum range of at a cruising speed of .

 was armed with a main battery of ten 30.5 cm SK L/50 guns in five twin turrets. The ship dispensed with the inefficient hexagonal arrangement of previous German battleships; instead, three of the five turrets were mounted on the centerline, with two of them arranged in a superfiring pair aft. The other two turrets were placed &quot;en echelon&quot; amidships, so that both could fire on the broadside. The ship was also armed with a secondary battery of fourteen SK L/45 guns in casemates amidships. For close-range defense against torpedo boats, she carried eight SK L/45 guns in casemates. The ship was also armed with four 8.8 cm L/45 anti-aircraft guns. The ship&#x27;s armament was rounded out by five torpedo tubes, all mounted in the ship&#x27;s hull; one was in the bow, and the other four were on the broadside.

Her main armored belt was thick in the central citadel, and was composed of Krupp cemented armor (KCA). Her main battery gun turrets were protected by of KCA on the sides and faces. ″s conning tower was heavily armored, with sides.

== Service history ==
Ordered under the contract name as a replacement for the obsolete coastal defense ship , was laid down at the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel in September 1909. The hull was completed by 22 March 1911, when the ship was launched; this date was specifically chosen, as it was the birthday of (Emperor) Wilhelm I. His grandson, Wilhelm II, attended the launching ceremony, where German Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg gave a speech while (Empress) Augusta Victoria christened the ship. Fitting-out work then began, which was completed by the end of July 1912. On 1 August, the ship was commissioned for sea trials. These were concluded by 7 December; the following day joined the fleet as the flagship of V Division. Her crew consisted largely of men who had been transferred from the recently decommissioned battleships and .

After joining the active fleet in December 1912, was stationed in Kiel. The ship then conducted individual training. In February 1913, was transferred to Wilhelmshaven, along with her sister ship . She then took part in several training exercises with the rest of the High Seas Fleet. These included maneuvers in the North Sea in March and April, artillery drills in the Baltic at the end of the month, and further fleet maneuvers in May. In June, took part in the Kiel Week regatta. Kaiser Wilhelm II and Italian King Victor Emmanuel III inspected the ship. The annual summer cruise to Norway was conducted in July and August, followed immediately by the autumn maneuvers in August and September. In September 1913, Captain Adolf von Trotha became the ship&#x27;s commanding officer, a post he held until January 1916.

 was selected to participate in a long-distance cruise to test the reliability of the new turbine propulsion system. The ship was joined by her sister and the light cruiser in a special &quot;Detached Division&quot;. The trio departed Germany on 9 December 1913 and proceeded to the German colonies in western Africa. The ships visited Lomé in Togoland, Duala and Victoria in Kamerun, and Swakopmund in German South-West Africa. From Africa, the ships sailed to St. Helena and then on to Rio de Janeiro, arriving on 15 February 1914. was detached to visit Buenos Aires, Argentina before returning to meet the two battleships in Montevideo, Uruguay. The three ships sailed south around Cape Horn and then north to Valparaiso, Chile, arriving on 2 April and remaining for over a week.

On 11 April, the ships departed Valparaiso for the long journey back to Germany. On the return trip, the ships visited several more ports, including Bahía Blanca, Argentina, before returning to Rio de Janeiro. On 16 May the ships left Rio de Janeiro for the Atlantic leg of the journey; they stopped in Cape Verde, Madeira, and Vigo, Spain while en route to Germany. , , and arrived in Kiel on 17 June 1914. In the course of the voyage, the ships traveled some . A week later, on 24 June, the Detached Division was dissolved and returned to III Squadron. then participated in squadron exercises in July. joined the High Seas Fleet for its annual summer cruise to Norway in July 1914, about two weeks after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo. As a result of rising international tensions, the cruise was cut short and the German fleet was back in Wilhelmshaven by 29 July. At midnight on 4 August, the United Kingdom declared war on Germany.

=== World War I ===
The High Seas Fleet, including , conducted a number of sweeps and advances into the North Sea. The first occurred on 2–3 November 1914, though no British forces were encountered. Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl, the commander of the High Seas Fleet, adopted a strategy in which the battlecruisers of Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper&#x27;s I Scouting Group raided British coastal towns to lure out portions of the Grand Fleet where they could be destroyed by the High Seas Fleet. The raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby on 15–16 December 1914 was the first such operation. On the evening of 15 December, the German battle fleet of some twelve dreadnoughts—including and her four sisters—and eight pre-dreadnoughts came to within of an isolated squadron of six British battleships. However, skirmishes between the rival destroyer screens in the darkness convinced Ingenohl that he was faced with the entire Grand Fleet. Under orders from Kaiser Wilhelm II to avoid risking the fleet unnecessarily, Ingenohl broke off the engagement and turned the battlefleet back toward Germany.

Following the loss of at the Battle of Dogger Bank in January 1915, the Kaiser removed Ingenohl from his post on 2 February. Admiral Hugo von Pohl replaced him as commander of the fleet. Pohl conducted a series of fleet advances in 1915 in which took part; in the first one on 29–30 March, the fleet steamed out to the north of Terschelling and return without incident. Another followed on 17–18 April, where and the rest of the fleet covered a mining operation by II Scouting Group. Three days later, on 21–22 April, the High Seas Fleet advanced towards the Dogger Bank, though again failed to meet any British forces. was in dock in Kiel for periodic maintenance during the operation on 17–18 May, but she was back with the fleet for the sortie on 29–30 May, during which the fleet advanced as far as Schiermonnikoog before being forced to turn back by inclement weather. On 10 August, the fleet steamed to the north of Helgoland to cover the return of the auxiliary cruiser . A month later, on 11–12 September, the fleet covered another mine-laying operation off the Swarte Bank. The last operation of the year, conducted on 23–24 October, was an advance without result in the direction of Horns Reef.

On 12 January 1916, Admiral Reinhard Scheer replaced Pohl as the fleet commander. was present during the fleet advance on 5–7 March, though this too ended without action. While in port in Kiel, the old pre-dreadnought accidentally collided with , though neither ship was seriously damaged. Scheer continued the series of fleet operations practiced by his predecessors; the fleet conducted sweeps of the North Sea on 26 March, 2–3 April, and 21–22 April. The battlecruisers conducted another raid on the English coast on 24–25 April, during which and the rest of the fleet provided distant support. Scheer planned another raid for mid-May, but the battlecruiser had struck a mine during the previous raid and the repair work forced the operation to be pushed back until the end of the month.

==== Battle of Jutland ====

Almost immediately after the Lowestoft raid, Scheer began planning another foray into the North Sea. He had initially intended to launch the operation in mid-May, by which time the mine damage to was scheduled to be repaired—Scheer was unwilling to embark on a major raid without his battlecruiser forces at full strength. On 9 May, however, several battleships developed problems with their engines, which delayed the operation further, to 23 May. On 22 May, was still not fully repaired, and the operation was again postponed, this time to 29 May. At noon on 29 May, the repairs to were finally completed, and the ship returned to I Scouting Group. The plan called for Hipper&#x27;s battlecruisers to steam north to the Skagerrak, with the intention of luring out a portion of the British fleet so it could be destroyed by Scheer&#x27;s waiting battleships.

 and the rest of III Battle Squadron were the leading unit of the High Seas Fleet; the four s led the line. , the flagship of H. Nordmann, was directly astern of the four s. I Battle Squadron, composed of the eight - and s, followed III Squadron, with the six elderly pre-dreadnoughts of II Battle Squadron bringing up the rear. Hipper&#x27;s five battlecruisers left the Jade estuary at 02:00 on 31 May; Scheer, with the High Seas Fleet, followed an hour and a half later.

Shortly before 16:00 CET, the battlecruisers of I Scouting Group encountered the British 1st Battlecruiser Squadron, under the command of David Beatty. The opposing ships began an artillery duel that saw the destruction of , shortly after 17:00, and , less than half an hour later. By this time, the German battlecruisers were steaming south in order to draw the British ships towards the main body of the High Seas Fleet. At 17:30, ″s crew spotted both I Scouting Group and the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron approaching. The German battlecruisers were steaming to starboard, while the British ships steamed to port. At 17:45, Scheer ordered a two-point turn to port to bring his ships closer to the British battlecruisers, and a minute later at 17:46, the order to open fire was given.

Between 17:48 and 17:52, , , , and all eight battleships of I Squadron opened fire on several ships of the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron; , , and engaged , though only managed to score a hit on the cruiser. In the span of eight minutes, fired eleven salvos at &quot;Southampton&quot; without success. The 2nd LCS then moved back out of range, having largely escaped unscathed. At 17:58, Scheer ordered the fleet to maximum speed; the greater speed of the s caused the distance between and to rapidly increase. At 18:05, &quot;Southampton&quot; again came into range, and opened fire. fired four salvos at a range of , though again without scoring any hits. After three minutes of firing, ″s guns again fell silent.

Starting at 18:10, began firing on the 5th Battle Squadron battleship ; in the span of 25 minutes, fired 27 salvos at an average range of . The British destroyers and , which had been disabled earlier in the engagement, lay directly in the path of the advancing High Seas Fleet. Shortly before 18:30, and her three sister ships opened fire on &quot;Nomad&quot; with their secondary batteries. The hail of 15-cm shells smothered the ship; a fire was started and one shell detonated the ship&#x27;s forward ammunition magazine. &quot;Nomad&quot; sank stern first at 18:30. &quot;Nestor&quot; was meanwhile destroyed by the battleships of I Squadron.

Shortly after 19:00, the German cruiser had become disabled by a shell from the British battlecruiser ; Rear Admiral Behncke in attempted to maneuver III Squadron to cover the stricken cruiser. Simultaneously, the British 3rd and 4th Light Cruiser Squadrons began a torpedo attack on the German line; while advancing to torpedo range, they smothered with fire from their main guns. The eight III Squadron battleships fired on the British cruisers, but even sustained fire from the battleships&#x27; main guns failed to drive off the British cruisers. The armored cruisers , , and joined in the attack on the crippled . Between 19:14 and 19:17, and several other battleships and battlecruisers opened fire on &quot;Defence&quot; and &quot;Warrior&quot;. &quot;Defence&quot; was struck by several heavy caliber shells from the German dreadnoughts. One salvo penetrated the ship&#x27;s ammunition magazines and, in a massive explosion, destroyed the cruiser.

As &quot;Warrior&quot; limped away to the west, the s of the 5th Battle Squadron joined the Grand Fleet as it entered the battle from the north. However, was forced to haul out of line to the south, towards the oncoming German fleet. &quot;Warspite&quot; came under intense fire from the approaching German battleships; scored a hit on &quot;Warspite&quot; that damaged her steering gear and forced her to steam in a circle, out of control. After completing two full circles and sustaining 13 heavy hits, &quot;Warspite&quot; came back under control and rejoined the squadron. However, by 20:00 the steering gear had again failed, so the ship was forced to withdraw from the engagement.

By 20:15, the German fleet had faced the Grand Fleet for a second time and was forced to turn away; in doing so, the order of the German line was reversed. was now the fifth ship from the rear of the German line, ahead of only the four -class battleships. was hit twice in quick succession by heavy-caliber shells, at 20:23 and three minutes later. The Common Pointed, Capped, shells came from the guns of . One shell penetrated the upper deck and landed in a hammock stowage compartment below the No. 7 casemate; the shell failed to explode and instead broke up on impact, starting a small fire that was quickly put out. The other shell probably exploded outside the ship.

Shortly before 21:30, , , and spotted British light forces approaching. The German ships opened fire at a range of around with both their main and secondary armament. The light cruiser was badly damaged, which forced the British ships to withdraw. At around 23:30, the German fleet reorganized into the night cruising formation. was the twelfth ship, in the center of the 24-ship line.

After a series of night engagements between the leading battleships and British destroyers, the High Seas Fleet punched through the British light forces and reached Horns Reef by 04:00 on 1 June. The German fleet reached Wilhelmshaven a few hours later; the I Squadron battleships took up defensive positions in the outer roadstead and , , , and stood ready just outside the entrance to Wilhelmshaven. The remainder of the battleships and battlecruisers entered Wilhelmshaven, where those that were still in fighting condition replenished their stocks of coal and ammunition. The two shell hits suffered by had been largely ineffectual, wounding only one crewmember.

==== Subsequent operations ====
On 18 August, Admiral Scheer attempted a repeat of the 31 May operation; the two serviceable German battlecruisers— and —supported by three dreadnoughts, were to bombard the coastal town of Sunderland in an attempt to draw out and destroy Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers. The rest of the fleet, including , would trail behind and provide cover. The British were aware of the German plans and sortied the Grand Fleet to meet them, leading to the action of 19 August 1916. By 14:35, Admiral Scheer had been warned of the Grand Fleet&#x27;s approach and, unwilling to engage the whole of the Grand Fleet just eleven weeks after the decidedly close call at Jutland, turned his forces around and retreated to German ports.

Another fleet advance followed on 18–20 October, though it ended without encountering any British units. Two weeks later, on 4 November, took part in an expedition to the western coast of Denmark to assist two U-boats— and —that had become stranded there. On 1 December, the High Seas Fleet was reorganized; and her sisters were transferred to the newly created IV Battle Squadron, with as the flagship. In 1917, the policy of unrestricted submarine warfare was reinstated; the surface units of the German navy were therefore tasked with covering the departures and arrivals of the U-boats. As a result, spent most of the year on picket duty in the German Bight. In May 1917, went into the dock for periodic maintenance.

==== Operation Albion ====

In early September 1917, following the German Army&#x27;s conquest of the Russian port of Riga, the Navy decided to eliminate the Russian naval forces that still held the Gulf of Riga. The (the Navy High Command) planned an operation to seize the Baltic island of Ösel, and specifically the Russian gun batteries on the Sworbe peninsula. On 18 September, the order was issued for a joint operation with the army to capture Ösel and Moon islands; the primary naval component was organized into a Special Unit, which comprised the flagship, , along with IV Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet. IV Squadron was composed of V and VI Divisions. V Division included the four -class ships, and was by this time augmented with the new battleship . VI Division consisted of the five -class battleships. Along with 9 light cruisers, 3 torpedo boat flotillas, and dozens of mine warfare ships, the entire force numbered some 300 ships, supported by over 100 aircraft and 6 zeppelins. The invasion force amounted to approximately 24,600 officers and enlisted men. Opposing the Germans were the old Russian pre-dreadnoughts and , the armored cruisers , , and , 26 destroyers, and several torpedo boats and gunboats. The garrison on Ösel numbered some 14,000 men.

On 24 September, left Kiel, bound for the Putziger Wiek, where she rendezvoused with several other battleships. From there, the ship went to Libau, which she reached on 10 October. Two days later, on the morning of 12 October, , joined by her sisters and , opened fire on the Russian shore batteries at Cape Hundsort. On 14 October engaged the Russian destroyer and disabled the ship&#x27;s engine with a single hit. was captured and taken in tow, but she quickly foundered. then bombarded Russian positions on Cape Toffri on 16 October.

By 20 October, the fighting on the islands was winding down; Moon, Ösel, and Dagö were in German possession. The previous day, the had ordered the cessation of naval actions and the return of the dreadnoughts to the High Seas Fleet as soon as possible. On 31 October and the rest of the Special Unit were detached from the operation and sent back to Kiel, which they reached by 2 November. was back in the North Sea on 7 November.

==== Final operations ====
 and were assigned to security duty in the Bight on 17 November; they were tasked with providing support to II Scouting Group (II SG) and several minesweepers. Two British light cruisers, and , attacked the minesweepers and II SG in the Second Battle of Helgoland Bight. and her sister intervened and hit one of the light cruisers. The two ships briefly engaged the battlecruiser , but neither side scored any hits and the German commander failed to press the attack.

On 2 February 1918, the light cruiser struck a mine; was among those ships that sortied to escort the damaged cruiser back to port. The ship was also present during the fleet advance on 23–24 April. The operation was intended to intercept a heavily escorted British convoy to Norway on 23–25 April, though the operation was canceled when the battlecruiser suffered mechanical damage. In the final months of the war, Captain Hermann Bauer took command of the ship; his period in command lasted from August to November.

 was to have taken part in a final fleet action days before the Armistice, an operation which envisioned the bulk of the High Seas Fleet sortieing from their base in Wilhelmshaven to engage the British Grand Fleet. In order to retain a better bargaining position for Germany, Admirals Hipper and Scheer intended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy, whatever the cost to the fleet. Consequently, on 29 October 1918, the order was given to depart from Wilhelmshaven to consolidate the fleet in the Jade roadstead, with the intention of departing the following morning. However, starting on the night of 29 October, sailors on mutinied. The unrest spread to other battleships, which forced Hipper and Scheer to cancel the operation.

=== Fate ===

Following the capitulation of Germany in November 1918, most of their fleet ships were interned in the British naval base in Scapa Flow under the command of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter. Prior to the departure of the German fleet, Admiral Adolf von Trotha made clear to Reuter that he could not allow the Allies to seize the ships, under any conditions. The fleet rendezvoused with the British light cruiser , which led the ships to the Allied fleet that was to escort the Germans to Scapa Flow. The massive flotilla consisted of some 370 British, American, and French warships. Once the ships were interned, their guns were disabled through the removal of their breech blocks. The fleet remained in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the Versailles Treaty.

A copy of &quot;The Times&quot; informed Reuter that the Armistice was to expire at noon on 21 June 1919, the deadline by which Germany was to have signed the peace treaty. Reuter came to the conclusion that the British intended to seize the German ships after the Armistice expired. Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd, Reuter ordered the ships to be sunk. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships. sank at 13:24; the ship was raised in 1929 and broken up for scrap in Rosyth starting in 1930.

<text>Poppaea Sabina (30 AD – 65 AD), also known as Ollia, was a Roman empress as the second wife of the emperor Nero. She had also been wife to the future emperor Otho. The historians of antiquity describe her as a beautiful woman who used intrigues to become empress.

The large Villa Poppaea at Oplontis near Pompeii bears her name because of the archaeological finds there. It has been largely excavated and can be visited today.

==Early life==

===Birth===
Poppaea Sabina the Younger was born in Pompeii in AD 30 as the daughter of Titus Ollius and Poppaea Sabina the Elder. At birth and for most of her childhood she went by her proper patronymic nomen &quot;Ollia&quot;, belonging to women of her father&#x27;s gens, the Ollii, but at some point, probably before her first marriage, decided to start going by her mother&#x27;s name instead, potentially due to her father&#x27;s disgrace and suicide.

It is very likely that Poppaea&#x27;s family came from Pompeii, and the common belief is that they might have been the owners of the Casa del Menandro (a house in Pompeii named for the painting of the 4th century BC playwright Menander that is found there). Most evidence suggesting Poppaea&#x27;s Pompeiian origins comes from the 20th-century excavations of a town that was destroyed in the Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79. For instance, legal documents found during excavations in nearby Herculaneum described her as being the owner of a brick- or tile-work business in the Pompeii area. In particular, the sumptuous Villa Poppaea at Oplontis near Herculaneum is thought to have been her main residence outside Rome.

===Family===
Titus Ollius was a quaestor in the reign of the Emperor Tiberius. Ollius&#x27; friendship with the infamous praetorian prefect Lucius Aelius Sejanus ruined him before gaining public office. Titus Ollius was from Picenum (modern Marche and Abruzzo, Italy) and he was an unknown minor character in imperial politics. Titus Ollius died in 31AD.

Poppaea Sabina the Elder, her mother, was a distinguished woman, whom Tacitus praises as wealthy and &quot;the loveliest woman of her day&quot;. In 47 AD, she committed suicide as an innocent victim of the intrigues of the Roman Empress Valeria Messalina, having been charged with committing adultery with former consul Decimus Valerius Asiaticus.
The father of Poppaea Sabina the Elder was Gaius Poppaeus Sabinus. This man of humble birth was consul in 9 AD and was the governor of Moesia from 12 to 35 AD. Passed during his consulship was the Lex Papia Poppaea, a law meant to strengthen and encourage marriage. Sabinus received a military triumph for ending a revolt in Thrace in 26 AD. From 15 AD until his death, he served as imperial Proconsul (or governor) of Greece and in other provinces. This competent administrator enjoyed the friendship of the Emperors Augustus and Tiberius. He died in late December of AD 35 from natural causes. After his death, Poppaea Sabina the Younger assumed the name of her maternal grandfather.

After Titus Ollius&#x27;s death, Poppaea&#x27;s mother married Publius Cornelius Lentulus Scipio the Elder, suffect consul, in 24 AD. Her siblings included stepbrother Publius Cornelius Lentulus Scipio the Younger, consul in 56 AD, and half-brother Publius Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus, suffect consul in 68 AD.

==First marriage to Rufrius Crispinus==
Poppaea&#x27;s first marriage was to Rufrius Crispinus, a man of equestrian rank. They married in 44 AD, when Poppaea was 14 years old. He was the leader of the Praetorian Guard during the first 10 years of the reign of the Emperor Claudius until 51 AD, when Claudius&#x27; new wife, Agrippina the Younger, removed him from this position. Agrippina regarded him as loyal to the deceased Messalina&#x27;s memory and replaced him with Sextus Afranius Burrus. Later, under Nero, he was executed. During their marriage, Poppaea gave birth to their son, a younger Rufrius Crispinus, who, after her death, would be drowned by Nero while on a fishing trip.

==Second marriage to Otho==
Poppaea then married Otho, a good friend of the new Emperor Nero who was seven years younger than she was. According to Tacitus, Poppaea married Otho only to get close to Nero. Nero fell in love with Poppaea, and she became his mistress.

Poppaea later divorced Otho and focused her attentions solely on becoming Nero&#x27;s new wife. Otho was ordered away to be governor of Lusitania. (A decade later, after Nero&#x27;s death, Otho became emperor, in succession to Galba.) Sources differ on when Poppaea divorced Otho: Tacitus dates the divorce to 58 AD, Suetonius dates it to after 59 AD.

==Marriage to Nero and Empress of Rome==
Tacitus depicts Poppaea as inducing Nero to murder his mother, Agrippina in 59 AD so that she could marry him. Modern scholars, however, question the reliability of this story as Nero did not marry Poppaea until 62 AD and point to Suetonius&#x27;s dating of the divorce from Otho. Some modern historians theorize that Nero&#x27;s decision to kill Agrippina was prompted by her plot to set Gaius Rubellius Plautus (Nero&#x27;s maternal second cousin) on the throne rather than as a result of Poppaea&#x27;s scheming.

With Agrippina gone, Poppaea pressured Nero to divorce and later execute his first wife and stepsister, Claudia Octavia, in order to marry her. During his eight-year marriage to Octavia, Nero fathered no children, but in 62 AD, Poppaea became pregnant. When this happened, Nero divorced Octavia, claimed she was barren, and married Poppaea 12 days after the divorce. Octavia was initially exiled to Campania before being imprisoned on the island of Pandateria, a common sentence for members of the imperial family who fell from favor because of a charge of adultery. Poppaea bore Nero one daughter, Claudia Augusta, born on 21 January 63, who died at four months of age. At the birth of Claudia, Nero honoured mother and child with the title of Augusta.

Tacitus and Suetonius portray Poppaea as an ambitious and ruthless schemer. The Jewish historian Josephus paints a different picture. He calls Poppaea a worshipper of the God of Israel and writes that she urged Nero to show compassion to the Jewish people. In one account, Josephus shows how Poppaea advocated for the Jewish priests when an issue was brought before Nero by Herod Agrippa II, who was the Tetrarch of Jerusalem, concerning a wall that was built blocking Agrippa&#x27;s view of the temple. She convinced Nero to not order the Jewish priests to tear down the wall and to leave the temple as is. However, in 64, Poppaea secured the position of procurator of Judaea for Gessius Florus, her friend&#x27;s husband, who was harmful to the Jews.

==Death==
The cause and timing of Poppaea&#x27;s death is uncertain. According to Suetonius, while she was awaiting the birth of her second child in the summer of 65, she quarrelled fiercely with Nero over him spending too much time at the races. In a fit of rage, Nero kicked her in the abdomen, causing her death. Tacitus, on the other hand, places her death after the Quinquennial Neronia (in 65 AD) and claims Nero&#x27;s kick was a &quot;casual outburst&quot;. Tacitus also mentions that some writers claimed Nero poisoned her, though Tacitus does not believe them. Cassius Dio claims Nero leapt upon her belly, but admitted that he did not know if it was intentional or accidental.

Modern historians, though, keep in mind Suetonius&#x27;s, Tacitus&#x27;s, and Cassius Dio&#x27;s severe biases against Nero, and hence recognize that Poppaea may have died due to complications of miscarriage or childbirth. Furthermore, a Greek poem encrypted on a frayed piece of papyrus reads that a deified Poppaea &quot;made a loving farewell speech to Nero, before [ascending] off to heaven on a chariot driven by a goddess&quot;, indicating her death was not caused by an act of violence of Nero&#x27;s.

When Poppaea died in 65, Nero went into deep mourning. Per the Roman imperial tradition, Poppaea was given a state funeral. In a departure from this cultural norm, however, she was not only embalmed, but also given divine honours alongside her daughter Claudia Augusta. Tacitus writes that Poppaea was embalmed by having her body filled with various herbs and spices and was buried in the Tomb of the Julii, but her actual burial spot is unknown. Nero supposedly burned a year&#x27;s worth of Arabia&#x27;s incense production at her funeral.

At the beginning of 66 AD, Nero married Statilia Messalina. After that, in 67 AD, Nero castrated and married a young freedman named Sporus. According to Cassius Dio, Sporus bore an uncanny resemblance to Poppaea, and Nero even called him by his dead wife&#x27;s name.

==Cultural references==
===In opera===
Fifteen centuries after her death, Poppaea was depicted in Claudio Monteverdi&#x27;s last opera, &quot;L&#x27;incoronazione di Poppea&quot; (&quot;The coronation of Poppaea&quot;) in 1642. Her story clearly was chosen to appeal to the titillation favoured in the nascent culture of the Venetian public opera theaters, and its prologue immediately explains that it is not a drama that promotes the triumph of virtue. Poppaea is portrayed as cynically plotting to become empress of Rome by manipulating the emperor Nero into marrying her, and her machinations include the execution of Seneca the Younger, who opposes her plans, which are successful at the end of the drama.

Poppaea is a principal character also in Handel&#x27;s 1709 opera &quot;Agrippina&quot;, but as a victim, not a perpetrator, of deceit and manipulation. Here the schemer is Agrippina, Nero&#x27;s mother, intent on promoting her son&#x27;s claim to the throne. Poppaea, the ingenue, is portrayed as the object of desire of Claudius, Nero, and Otho, each of whom served for a time as Roman Emperor, whose rivalries Agrippina attempts to leverage to her advantage. Once Poppaea sees through Agrippina&#x27;s deceit, she responds in kind, but only in order to be united with Otho, portrayed as her one true love.

===In film===
Poppaea appears as a character in the several cinema and TV versions of Henryk Sienkiewicz&#x27;s novel &quot;Quo Vadis&quot;:
* In the 1951 film version — in which she is played by Patricia Laffan in a widely praised performance — she is strangled to death by Nero, who blames her for turning his &quot;loyal subjects&quot;, the Roman populace, against him. (This form of murder may have been suggested to the screenwriters by Suetonius&#x27; claim that Nero made several attempts to strangle his first wife, Octavia.)
* In the 1985 international TV miniseries, &quot;Quo vadis&quot;, Poppaea was portrayed by Cristina Raines.
* In the 2001 adaptation, &quot;Quo Vadis&quot;, Poppaea was portrayed by Agnieszka Wagner

Another portrayal of Poppaea is featured in the 1932 film &quot;The Sign of the Cross&quot;. Daringly for the time, she is portrayed (by Claudette Colbert) as being openly bisexual, suggestively inviting a female companion to bathe with her, but lusting after Roman soldier Marcus Superbus (Fredric March).

In the 1976 BBC TV series &quot;I, Claudius&quot;, Poppaea was played by Sally Bazely.

In the 1956 Italian film &quot;Nero&#x27;s Mistress&quot;, Poppaea was played by Brigitte Bardot.

Kara Tointon played Poppaea in 2003&#x27;s &quot;Boudica&quot;, also known as &quot;Warrior Queen&quot; in the United States.

Poppaea is portrayed by Catherine McCormack in the 2006 BBC docudrama &quot;Ancient Rome: The Rise and Fall of an Empire&quot;. In this interpretation, she is kicked to death by Nero after offhandedly and uncritically mentioning a minor glitch during his performance at the Quinquennial Neronia. Her corpse is later shown mounted on display.

Rachel Yakar performs the role of Poppea in the 1979 opera film of &quot;L&#x27;incoronazione di Poppea&quot;, directed by Jean-Pierre Ponnelle and conducted by Nikolaus Harnoncourt.

She is also a character in the 2004 drama film &quot;Nero&quot;, played by Elisa Tovati.

In Mel Brooks&#x27; 1968 film &quot;The Producers&quot;, Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder) is terrified by Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel) when the large man stands over him, and — in reference to Cassius Dio&#x27;s account of Poppaea&#x27;s death — screams: &quot;You&#x27;re going to jump on me. I know you&#x27;re going to jump on me – like Nero jumped on Poppaea... Poppaea. She was his wife. And she was unfaithful to him. So he got mad and he jumped on her. Up and down, up and down, until he squashed her like a bug. Please don&#x27;t jump on me!&quot;

In the 2013 Polish film &quot;Imperator&quot;, done entirely in Latin, Poppaea is played by Ewa Horwich. Here, Poppaea is depicted as outliving Nero and meeting her death in Germania after reuniting with Otho.

In the 1965 Doctor Who story &quot;The Romans&quot;, Poppaea is played by Kay Patrick.

===In music===
The Gothic metal band Theatre of Tragedy wrote a song titled &quot;Poppæa&quot;, inspired by her story, on their myth-based album &quot;Aégis&quot;.

<text>The Landsat program is the longest-running enterprise for acquisition of satellite imagery of Earth. It is a joint NASA / USGS program. On 23 July 1972, the [[Landsat 1|Earth Resources Technology Satellite]] was launched. This was eventually renamed to Landsat 1 in 1975. The most recent, Landsat 9, was launched on 27 September 2021.

The instruments on the Landsat satellites have acquired millions of images. The images, archived in the United States and at Landsat receiving stations around the world, are a unique resource for global change research and applications in agriculture, cartography, geology, forestry, regional planning, surveillance and education, and can be viewed through the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) &quot;EarthExplorer&quot; website. Landsat 7 data has eight spectral bands with spatial resolutions ranging from ; the temporal resolution is 16 days. Landsat images are usually divided into scenes for easy downloading. Each Landsat scene is about 115 miles long and 115 miles wide (or 100 nautical miles long and 100 nautical miles wide, or 185 kilometers long and 185 kilometers wide).

== History ==
In 1965, William T. Pecora, the then director of the United States Geological Survey, proposed the idea of a remote sensing satellite program to gather facts about the natural resources of our planet. Pecora stated that the program was &quot;conceived in 1966 largely as a direct result of the demonstrated utility of the Mercury and Gemini orbital photography to Earth resource studies.&quot; While weather satellites had been monitoring Earth&#x27;s atmosphere since 1960 and were largely considered useful, there was no appreciation of terrain data from space until the mid-1960s. So, when Landsat 1 was proposed, it met with intense opposition from the Bureau of Budget and those who argued high-altitude aircraft would be the fiscally responsible choice for Earth remote sensing. Concurrently, the Department of Defense feared that a civilian program such as Landsat would compromise the secrecy of their reconnaissance missions. Additionally, there were geopolitical concerns about photographing foreign countries without permission. In 1965, NASA began methodical investigations of Earth remote sensing using instruments mounted on planes. In 1966, the USGS convinced the Secretary of the Interior, Stewart Udall, to announce that the Department of the Interior (DOI) was going to proceed with its own Earth-observing satellite program. This savvy political stunt coerced NASA to expedite the building of Landsat. But budgetary constraints and sensor disagreements between application agencies (notably the Department of Agriculture and DOI) again stymied the satellite construction process. Finally, by 1970 NASA had a green light to build a satellite. Remarkably, within only two years, Landsat 1 was launched, heralding a new age of remote sensing of land from space.

The Hughes Aircraft Company from Santa Barbara Research Center initiated, designed, and fabricated the first three Multispectral Scanners (MSS) in 1969. The first MSS prototype, designed by Virginia Norwood, was completed within nine months, in the fall of 1970. It was tested by scanning Half Dome at Yosemite National Park. For this design work Norwood was called &quot;The Mother of Landsat&quot;.

Working at NASA&#x27;s Goddard Space Flight Center, Valerie L. Thomas managed the development of early Landsat image processing software systems and became the resident expert on the Computer Compatible Tapes, or CCTs, that were used to store early Landsat imagery. Thomas was one of the image processing specialists who facilitated the ambitious &#x27;Large Area Crop Inventory Experiment&#x27;, known as LACIE — a project that showed for the first time that global crop monitoring could be done through remote sensing with Landsat satellite imagery.

The program was initially called the Earth Resources Technology Satellites Program, which was used from 1966 to 1975. In 1975, the name was changed to Landsat. In 1979, President of the United States Jimmy Carter&#x27;s Presidential Directive 54 transferred Landsat operations from NASA to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), recommended development of a long term operational system with four additional satellites beyond Landsat 3, and recommended transition to private sector operation of Landsat. This occurred in 1985 when the Earth Observation Satellite Company (EOSAT), a partnership of Hughes Aircraft Company and RCA, was selected by NOAA to operate the Landsat system with a ten-year contract. EOSAT operated Landsat 4 and Landsat 5, had exclusive rights to market Landsat data, and was to build Landsats 6 and 7.

In 1989, this transition had not been fully completed when NOAA&#x27;s funding for the Landsat program was due to run out (NOAA had not requested any funding, and U.S. Congress had appropriated only six months of funding for the fiscal year) and NOAA directed that Landsat 4 and Landsat 5 be shut down.

The head of the newly formed National Space Council, Vice President Dan Quayle, noted the situation and arranged emergency funding that allowed the program to continue with the data archives intact.

Again in 1990 and 1991, Congress provided only half of the year&#x27;s funding to NOAA, requesting that agencies that used Landsat data provide the funding for the other six months of the upcoming year.

In 1992, various efforts were made to procure funding for follow on Landsats and continued operations, but by the end of the year EOSAT ceased processing Landsat data. Landsat 6 was finally launched on 5 October 1993, but was lost in a launch failure. Processing of Landsat 4 and 5 data was resumed by EOSAT in 1994. NASA finally launched Landsat 7 on 15 April 1999.

The value of the Landsat program was recognized by Congress in October 1992 when it passed the Land Remote Sensing Policy Act (Public Law 102-555) authorizing the procurement of Landsat 7 and assuring the continued availability of Landsat digital data and images, at the lowest possible cost, to traditional and new users of the data.

== Spatial and spectral resolution ==
Landsat 1 through 5 carried the Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS). Landsat 4 and 5 carried both the MSS and Thematic Mapper (TM) instruments. Landsat 7 uses the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) scanner. Landsat 8 uses two instruments, the Operational Land Imager (OLI) for optical bands and the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) for thermal bands. The band designations, bandpasses, and pixel sizes for the Landsat instruments are:

* Original MSS pixel size was 79 x 57 meters; production systems now resample the data to 60 meters.

* TM Band 6 was acquired at 120-meter resolution, but products are resampled to 30-meter pixels.

* ETM+ Band 6 is acquired at 60-meter resolution, but products are resampled to 30-meter pixels.


* TIRS bands are acquired at 100 meter resolution, but are resampled to 30 meter in delivered data product.

An advantage of Landsat imagery, and remote sensing in general, is that it provides data at a synoptic global level that is impossible to replicate with in situ measurements. However, there are tradeoffs between the local detail of the measurements (radiometric resolution, number of spectral bands) and the spatial scale of the area being measured. Landsat imagery is coarse in spatial resolution compared to using other remote sensing methods, such as imagery from airplanes. Compared to other satellites, Landsat&#x27;s spatial resolution is relatively high, yet revisit time is relatively less frequent.

== MultiSpectral Scanner (MSS) ==
The Landsat program incorporated the Multispectral Scanner (MSS) from its first mission up to its fifth. The MSS gave the United States an advantage in satellite imaging, facilitating the launch of Landsat ahead of the French SPOT satellite.

The MSS was unique in its design. Rather than a static camera, it employed a moving mirror, capturing Earth&#x27;s images in four distinct spectral bands. This capability allowed the MSS to record variations in sunlight reflected from the Earth. Notably, Landsat 3&#x27;s MSS was further advanced, with an added capability to detect heat radiation.

One of the prominent features of the MSS was its consistent imaging. Each captured frame represented an area on the Earth&#x27;s surface approximately 83 meters in length and 68 meters in width. Additionally, the system was designed to ensure a continuous image sweep across a swath equivalent to 185 km on the Earth&#x27;s surface. The MSS&#x27;s design also emphasized precision; by precisely timing the mirror&#x27;s movements, it ensured that consecutive images did not overlap.

However, by the 1980s, the cost dynamics shifted. Accessing Landsat&#x27;s imagery became substantially more expensive, making the French SPOT satellite&#x27;s images a more cost-effective alternative for many users. The rise in Landsat&#x27;s prices can be attributed to U.S. policy shifts, initiated under President Carter&#x27;s leadership and finalized during President Reagan&#x27;s administration.

== Uses of Landsat imagery ==

Landsat data provides information that allows scientists to predict the distribution of species, as well as detecting both naturally occurring and human-generated changes over a greater scale than traditional data from field work. The different spectral bands used on satellites in the Landsat program provide many applications, ranging from ecology to geopolitical matters. Land cover determination is a common use of Landsat imagery around the world.

Landsat imagery provides one of the longest uninterrupted time series available from any single remote sensing program, spanning from 1972 to present. Looking to the future, the successful launch of Landsat-9 in 2021 shows that this time series will be continued forward.
In 2015, the Landsat Advisory Group of the National Geospatial Advisory Committee reported that the top 16 applications of Landsat imagery produced savings of approximately 350 million to over 436 million dollars each year for federal and state governments, NGO&#x27;s, and the private sector. That estimate did not include further savings from other uses beyond the top sixteen categories. The top 16 categories for Landsat imagery use, listed in order of estimated annual savings for users, are: 
# U.S. Department of Agriculture risk management
# U.S. Government mapping
# Agricultural water use monitoring
# Global security monitoring
# Support for fire management
# Detection of forest fragmentation
# Detection of forest change
# World agriculture supply and demand estimates
# Vineyard management and water conservation
# Flood mitigation mapping
# Agricultural commodities mapping
# Waterfowl habitat mapping and monitoring
# Coastal change analysis
# Forest health monitoring
# National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency global shoreline mapping
# Wildfire risk assessment 

Further uses of Landsat imagery include, but are not limited to: fisheries, forestry, shrinking inland water bodies, fire damage, glacier retreat, urban development, and discovery of new species. A few specific examples are explained below.

=== Natural resources management ===

==== Fisheries ====
In 1975, one potential application for the new satellite-generated imagery was to find high yield fishery areas. Through the Landsat Menhaden and Thread Investigation, some satellite data of the eastern portion of the Mississippi sound and another area off the coast of the Louisiana coast data was run through classification algorithms to rate the areas as high and low probability fishing zones, these algorithms yielded a classification that was proven with in situ measurements – to be over 80% accurate and found that water color, as seen from space, and turbidity significantly correlate with the distribution of menhaden – while surface temperature and salinity do not appear to be significant factors. Water color – measured with the multispectral scanners four spectral bands, was used to infer Chlorophyll, turbidity, and possibly fish distribution.

==== Forestry ====
An ecological study used 16 ortho-rectified Landsat images to generate a land cover map of Mozambique&#x27;s mangrove forest. The main objective was to measure the mangrove cover and above ground biomass on this zone that until now could only be estimated, the cover was found with 93% accuracy to be 2909 square kilometers (27% lower than previous estimates). Additionally, the study helped confirm that geological setting has a greater influence on biomass distribution than latitude alone - the mangrove area is spread across 16° of latitude but it the biomass volume of it was affected more strongly by geographic conditions.

=== Climate change and environmental disasters ===
==== Shrinking of the Aral Sea ====
The shrinking of the Aral Sea has been described as &quot;One of the planet&#x27;s worst environmental disasters&quot;. Landsat imagery has been used as a record to quantify the amount of water loss and the changes to the shoreline. Satellite visual images have a greater impact on people than just words, and this shows the importance of Landsat imagery and satellite images in general.

==== Fires in Yellowstone National Park ====
The Yellowstone fires of 1988 were the worst in the recorded history of the national park. They lasted from 14 June to 11 September 1988, when rain and snow helped halt the spread of the fires. The area affected by the fire was estimated to be 3,213 square kilometers – 36% of the park. Landsat imagery was used for the area estimation, and it also helped determine the reasons why the fire spread so quickly. Historic drought and a significant number of lightning strikes were some of the factors that created conditions for the massive fire, but anthropogenic actions amplified the disaster. On images generated previous to the fire, there is an evident difference between lands that display preservation practices and the lands that display clear cut activities for timber production. These two type of lands reacted differently to the stress of fires, and it is believed that that was an important factor on the behavior of the wildfire. Landsat imagery, and satellite imagery in general, have contributed to understanding fire science; fire danger, wildfire behavior and the effects of wildfire on certain areas. It has helped understanding of how different features and vegetation fuel fires, change temperature, and affect the spreading speed.

==== Glacier retreat ====
The serial nature of Landsat missions and the fact that is the longest-running satellite program gives it a unique perspective to generate information of Earth. Glacier retreat in a big scale can be traced back to previous Landsat missions, and this information can be used to generate climate change knowledge. The Columbia glacier retreat for example, can be observed in false-composite images since Landsat 4 in 1986.

====Urban development====
Landsat imagery gives a time-lapse like series of images of development. Human development specifically, can be measured by the size a city grows over time. Further than just population estimates and energy consumption, Landsat imagery gives an insight of the type of urban development, and study aspects of social and political change through visible change. In Beijing for example, a series of ring roads started to develop in 1980s following the economic reform of 1970, and the change in development rate and construction rate was accelerated in these time periods.

===Ecology===
==== Discovery of new species ====
In 2005, Landsat imagery assisted in the discovery of new species. Conservation scientist Julian Bayliss wanted to find areas that could potentially become conservation forests using Landsat generated satellite images. Bayliss saw a patch in Mozambique that until then had no detailed information. On a reconnaissance trip, he found great diversity of wildlife as well as three new species of butterflies and a new snake species. Following his discovery, he continued to study this forest and was able to map and determine the forest extent.

== Recent and future Landsat satellites ==
Landsat 8 launched on 11 February 2013. It was launched on an Atlas V 401 from Vandenberg Air Force Base by the Launch Services Program. It will continue to obtain valuable data and imagery to be used in agriculture, education, business, science, and government. The new satellite was assembled in Arizona by Orbital Sciences Corporation.

Landsat 9 launched on September 27, 2021. During FY2014 financial planning &quot;appropriators chided NASA for unrealistic expectations that a Landsat 9 would cost US$1 billion, and capped spending at US$650 million&quot; according to a report by the Congressional Research Service. United States Senate appropriators advised NASA to plan for a launch no later than 2020. In April 2015, NASA and the USGS announced that work on Landsat 9 had commenced, with funding allocated for the satellite in the president&#x27;s FY2016 budget, for a planned launch in 2023. Funding for the development of a low-cost thermal infrared (TIR) free-flying satellite for launch in 2019 was also proposed, to ensure data continuity by flying in formation with Landsat 8.

In the future, there may also be more collaboration between Landsat satellites and other satellites with similar spatial and spectral resolution, such as the ESA&#x27;s Sentinel-2 constellation.

Landsat Next is planned to launch in late 2030/early 2031 and will measure 26 spectral bands; current Landsat&#x27;s 8 and 9 measure 11 each.

<text>Paul Okalik (, ; born May 26, 1964) is a Canadian politician. He is the first Inuk to have been called to the Nunavut Bar. He was also the first premier of Nunavut.

On November 4, 2010, he was elected Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut. Okalik represented the electoral district of Iqaluit West in the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut until April 6, 2011 when he announced he would be resigning in order to run for the Liberal Party of Canada in the riding of Nunavut in the 2011 Canadian federal election. He returned to the Legislative Assembly in 2013 until being defeated in the 2017 Nunavut general election.

== Early life ==

Okalik was born on May 26, 1964, in Pangnirtung, Northwest Territories (now Nunavut), the youngest of ten children born to Auyaluk and Annie Okalik. He was sent to residential school in Frobisher Bay, now Iqaluit, at 15, returning to Pangnirtung after one year. He began a series of temporary jobs and pursuits including time as an apprentice underground at the Nanisivik Mine in northern Baffin Island. In the early 1980s, he became interested in the political development of Inuit communities and began to work for the Tunngavik Federation of Nunavut, the predecessor of Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated, as a deputy negotiator on the Inuit land claim, the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement. That claim, the largest in Canadian history, was signed in 1993 after decades of negotiations between Canada and the Inuit of Nunavut and would lead to the creation of Nunavut that he was to lead as premier through its first decade.

Okalik continued his claims work, and began University as a mature student, serving as a representative on the Nunavut Implementation Panel. Okalik has been overt in acknowledging the role alcohol played in his earlier years and his commitment during his university years to stop drinking altogether. He went on to obtain a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in Political Science at Carleton University in Ottawa, and a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) from the University of Ottawa.

In 1998 he returned to Iqaluit to article at Crawford Law Office, working briefly in Yellowknife and with the Maliganik Tukisiniakvik legal aid clinic. In 1999 he was called to the Northwest Territories Bar, becoming the first Inuk lawyer in NWT/Nunavut history. His dream was to help his people in their dealings with the Canadian justice system.

==Political life==

At the first Nunavut election held February 15, 1999, Okalik was elected to represent Iqaluit West in the first Legislative Assembly of Nunavut, defeating Ben Ell and Matthew Spence, with 51% of ballots cast. The First Nunavut Assembly met prior to the official creation of the territory in order to elect the territory&#x27;s first premier and ministers. There are no political parties in Nunavut. Instead, all members of the Assembly are elected as independents, with the Assembly then recommending a ministry from among its elected members via a consensus model. The Commissioner of Nunavut then formally appoints them to office.

Former federal MP Jack Anawak had been widely touted as the future Premier. However, Anawak was seen as Ottawa&#x27;s choice, while Okalik was a dark horse and perceived as his own man. On March 5, 1999 after an extensive Leadership Forum question and answer period in the Assembly, Okalik was elected the first Premier of Nunavut. His mandate as premier became effective on April 1, 1999, the day Nunavut territory came into existence.

He stood for reelection in the 2004 general election, and was returned to the Legislative Assembly. On March 5, 2004, the Legislative Assembly again selected him premier over challenger Tagak Curley. By 2007, Okalik was the longest-serving sitting premier in Canada.

In the 2008 Nunavut General Election he won his third election and ran for a third term as Premier. On November 14, 2008, Okalik was defeated by Eva Aariak for the premiership. Okalik declined a nomination to cabinet and subsequently sat as a regular member in the Nunavut Assembly.

One of Okalik&#x27;s primary goals as premier of Nunavut was to make the territory economically self-sufficient, as currently 90% of their budget comes from the federal government. Despite this, Okalik continues to have high hopes for the territory and believes that Nunavut has great economic potential. He cites resources such as diamonds, and also Inuit art and tourism as potential sources of income for the territory.

On November 4, 2010, Okalik was elected the Speaker of the Nunavut Legislative Assembly, replacing James Arreak who had resigned to become a cabinet minister.

He announced on April 6, 2011 that he would resign from the Legislative Assembly in order to run for the Liberal Party of Canada in the federal riding of Nunavut in the 2011 Canadian federal election. He finished second in the election behind Conservative incumbent Leona Aglukkaq.

Okalik returned to the legislature at the 2013 Nunavut general election as the member for Iqaluit-Sinaa, which includes much of his old riding. Soon afterward, he returned to cabinet as Justice Minister. However, in 2016, Okalik resigned from cabinet because of his opposition to a proposed liquor store in Iqaluit and the lack of addictions support. Okalik told the Assembly that as a recovering alcoholic who had his last drink in 1991, he could not support a liquor store in the territorial capital without improved facilities for recovering alcoholics.

During the 2015 Canadian federal election, Okalik protested a 2014 incident in which Aglukkaq read a newspaper during Question Period while opposition parties asked about exorbitant food prices in the North by reading a newspaper whenever Aglukkaq spoke at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation election forum in Iqaluit.

==Accomplishments as Premier==

The first two terms (1999–04, 2004–08) of the Nunavut Government were defining for the Nunavut territory. The creation of a new government in a territory where no prior government structures existed was an accomplishment achieved by the hard work, idealism and commitment of many individuals, including Ministers, MLAs, public servants, Inuit organizations and municipal leaders – but the period is likely to be viewed as the Okalik legacy.

The First Assembly set out its goals in the mandate statement, with priorities on education and housing. The Second Assembly released its mandate statement, with priorities on Inuit culture and economic growth. In the Nunavut consensus system, where assembly members are elected on personal and individual platforms, the mandate statement represents the collective assertion of goals and political will and values for each Assembly.

Immediately in 1999 the new Nunavut government recommenced the construction of public housing, which the NWT had abandoned, taking the first steps to address the massive overcrowding and severe housing deficit facing all Nunavut communities, as well as developing innovations in assisting home ownership and first time purchasers. The monies spent on housing increased steadily over this period and persistent efforts eventually secured $300M in federal dollars for a huge construction program, the &quot;Nunavut Housing Trust&quot;.

The construction of schools was a massive annual commitment during this decade, with almost every Nunavut community getting upgraded, new and impressive community schools at some point during the decade. Nunavut developed enhanced training for teachers, created a Nunavut program for registered nurses and supported the very successful Akitsiraq Law School, built Nunavut&#x27;s first trades school in Rankin Inlet, put in place the process and approvals for a Nunavut Cultural School slated for Clyde River, improved levels of post-secondary student financial assistance, and funded Inuit and Inuktitut/Inuinnaqtun curriculum development. The decade saw a steady rise in Grade 12 graduations for Nunavummiut youth across the territory, although still falling short of Canadian national rates.

Long overdue health facilities were constructed in the regional centres of Iqaluit, Rankin Inlet and Cambridge Bay, infant and child inoculation rates were expanded, more physicians took up residence in the territory, the first Inuit certified midwives graduated and a series of elder-care facilities were planned and constructed. None of these measures narrowed the huge health and wellness gaps between Nunavummiut and other Canadians. Of particular concern was the huge impact of youth suicides, eventually leading to Nunavut&#x27;s support for The Nunavut Suicide Prevention Project.

The Nunavut Land Claims Agreement requires that governments work towards a public service representative of the public it serves. In the first ten years of Nunavut, Inuit employment rates far exceeded those in the former Northwest Territories and showed stead improvement since 1999; however, these rates were still highest in the lowest education and pay categories, skilled positions remained unfilled in many communities, and the classic issues around minority employment efforts became part of the Nunavut public agenda.

He lost re-election in the 2017 general election.

==Legislation==

The Legislative legacy of the first two Nunavut Assemblies is substantial and fundamental in impact. Okalik introduced the first Nunavut Human Rights Act, which had never been done in the former NWT, and took a principled stand on its need to cover homosexuals. New structures for energy generation and regulation were created with the Qulliq Energy Corporation Act (dividing the assets of the joint Nunavut/NWT Crown Energy utility and creating its Nunavut successor) and the Utilities Rates Review Council Act. Regional Education and Health Boards were abolished and these functions and employees were moved into the departments of Education and Health and Social Services (respectively). These changes and Acts were original creations, scoped for the modest scale and limited capacity of Nunavut.

The consultative process of the Wildlife Act, which implemented and supported the hunting rights set out in the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement, was an extensive piece of work, frequently attempted but never accomplished in the former Northwest Territories. It took two attempts to gain a consensus on an original, some might say courageous and revolutionary Education Act which was so comprehensive it is still being implemented, and the linguistic, legal and cultural pitfalls of the Official Languages Act and the Inuit Language Protection Act guarantee that these pieces of legislation will be formative documents for many years to come.

Innovative and strong controls on purchasing and youth access were instituted by the Tobacco Control Act and a unique set of timely and accessible remedies was delivered into the hands of Justice of the Peace and community member through the terms of the Family Abuse Intervention Act.

==Controversy==

Nunavut managed to create its first political crisis on the issue of time zones in 1999, with Okalik and most of Cabinet supporting a unified time zone across the three current time zones and Nunavut regions. Most municipalities – despite originally supporting time zone unification at their annual meetings – responded to the government initiative with overt resistance, leading to a stand-off where Hamlets ran clocks at their preferred time and schools and airports frequently operated on another. Ultimately Okalik and the government backed down and the historic three time zones, Eastern Time Zone for the Qikiqtaaluk, Central Time Zone for the Kivalliq and Mountain Time Zone for the Kitikmeot have continued in effect.

The consolidation of the Health and Education Boards was accomplished in the first year of the first Assembly, when the value of common institutions was generally accepted. The corresponding change has been frequently recommended but not yet implemented in the NWT. While the Health Boards are not generally lamented the loss of the Divisional Boards of Education is seen in some quarters as leading to a less nimble and more encumbered Inuktitut and Inuinnaqtun curriculum.

The issue of &quot;decentralization&quot; or the location of territorial- and headquarters-level government functions in one or more of the 10 &quot;decentralized&quot; Nunavut communities was an integral part of the planning of Nunavut from the time of the Nunavut Implementation Commission, and the Office of the Interim Commissioner. Practical adjustments were made to the locations recommended by the Office of the Interim Commissioner for many functions in 1999 and 2000, but many other positions were assigned to communities on a community development rather than a functional basis. There remain serious contentions around the effectiveness of specific functions and the over-all value of the decentralization initiative, but Okalik remained committed to the principle, and to seeing jobs delivered to communities outside the major centres.

The Okalik terms were remarkable for a general lack of corruption. Okalik along with colleagues Ed Picco and Hunter Tootoo and Rebekah Williams refused to accept a supplementary pension for members created by the Assembly which he deemed &quot;excessive&quot;. Okalik was a modest spender by most accounts, and financial and political decisions taken were largely policy driven. During those years, Ministers who were perceived as not performing, were charged with criminal offences or found in a conflict of interest, lost their portfolios and/or resigned promptly, and in one instance were removed by the Assembly after being created Minister Without Portfolio.

Okalik was perceived as strategic, intelligent, a very quick and thorough study in his work, while his adversaries characterized him as short-tempered and aggressive, especially in his second term. During his almost ten years in office he was a reliable advocate for Nunavut among Canadian First Ministers, leading a public challenge to Prime Minister Jean Chrétien on the terms of access to medical care for Nunavut, revitalizing the Northern Premiers Forums, and being a founding member of the Council of the Federation.

During the last week of June 2007, Okalik reportedly made derogatory comments to Iqaluit mayor Elisapee Sheutiapik about Lynda Gunn, an executive from the Nunavut Association of Municipalities, allegedly calling her a &quot;fucking bitch&quot;. Although Okalik apologized, both publicly and in private, the apology was refused. On September 17, 2007, MLAs voted to censure Okalik. Okalik himself abstained from voting, but asked his fellow MLAs to censure him as a formal recognition of his mistake. Sheutiapik subsequently challenged Okalik for the Iqaluit West seat in the 2008 election. Okalik was re-elected.

In November 2009, a report by the Integrity Commissioner declared that Okalik violated the territory&#x27;s &quot;Integrity Act&quot; by soliciting campaign donations from deputy ministers, whom premiers appoint, and that Okalik should apologize.

On June 18, 2005, Carleton University conferred on Okalik an honorary doctorate in law.

On November 24, 2008, Okalik was the sole recipient at the 16th Annual National Aboriginal Achievement Awards, now the Indspire Awards, in the category of Politics.

Okalik has three children, Shasta, Jordan and Béatrice, and at least one grandchild.

<text>This list contains &quot;only&quot; complete, printed English-language editions of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; by J. R. R. Tolkien. It is not for derived or unprinted works such as screenplays, graphic novels, or audio books.

== Introduction ==

For this list, a printing is a separate edition if &quot;any&quot; of the following criteria is met:
* The publisher declares it to be a new edition.
* Substantial changes to the text have been introduced beyond correcting typographical errors.
* A publisher prints the basic design for the first time.
* The dust jacket or cover design has changed appreciably.
* The height or width of the book has changed.
* The binding materials have changed.

For this list, a printing is a variant of a separate edition if both it is not a separate edition itself and also &quot;any&quot; of the following criteria is met:
* Inconspicuous marks or annotations declare it to be from a different publisher than an edition it is otherwise identical to (e.g., book club edition).
* Some internal illustrations appear as color instead of black-and-white, or vice versa.
* Some small change has been made in the design of the book or its binding or dust jacket without affecting the whole design.

A printing is &#x27;not&#x27; a separate edition or variant solely because of any of the following:
* Binding color changed.
* Dust jacket color scheme changed but design remained the same.
* Typographical errors were corrected.

&quot;Numbered pages&quot; means the page number of the last page of the story itself, regardless of whether the page number actually appears on the page. It does not include end papers or advertisement pages, even if they are numbered.

== List of editions ==

== Early American editions ==

The early United States editions of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; were published by the Houghton Mifflin Company of Boston and New York City and are particularly collectible but difficult to identify. Tolkien&#x27;s publisher was George Allen &amp; Unwin of London (A&amp;U). Houghton Mifflin of Boston and New York arranged to publish Tolkien&#x27;s books in the United States. Houghton Mifflin printed sheets for the first edition from plates etched from a photo-enlargement of the Allen &amp; Unwin first edition. For the second edition they imported sheets directly from A&amp;U. However, they bound their own volumes, usually distinctly from their British counterparts. The American versions differed from the British in one respect crucial to the collectibles market: beyond the first printing, most of Houghton Mifflin&#x27;s impressions did not identify which printing run they came out of or even a copyright date. This failure caused confusion in the collectibles market, as few people can identify the Houghton Mifflin second editions, which were extant from 1951 to 1966.

Very roughly, earlier printings are valued more than later. In particular, the first edition, with its different account of &quot;Riddles in the Dark&quot;, is in great demand. However, the fifth overall impression, or the first printing of the second edition, seems to be garnering prices as high as the British fourth printing, which was the cheapest and most common of the first edition printings. Later second edition printings are valued much less than first edition printings or the first printing of the second edition. The presence of the matching dust-jacket often doubles the value of any of these printings, particularly if it is in good shape. However, because the second American edition changes its binding color from printing to printing, they gain considerable charm displayed in array without their jackets.

=== The first edition ===


Houghton Mifflin published the first American edition of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; in spring of 1938 following its September, 1937 debut in the United Kingdom. For this first edition Houghton Mifflin printed the sheets in the United States. They chose to print it in a larger size and on heavier stock than Allen &amp; Unwin&#x27;s first edition, and they included four color plates of Tolkien&#x27;s original artwork. Margins are ample and the typesetting well crafted for readability. The lettering on the tan cloth cover is printed in deep blue. The bowing hobbit emblem on the front and the dwarf&#x27;s hood emblem on the spine are filled with bright red. The end-paper maps were printed in red only, instead of the black and red chosen by Allen &amp; Unwin. The publisher mistakenly put the Wilderland map at the front and the Lonely Mountain map at the back, the reverse of the description in the text.

Surviving dust-jackets on the first edition are rare. It is not known whether that is because of attrition, because some printings were not jacketed, or because lots directed to some markets did not come with jackets. What is known is that jackets have been reported on more than one of the printings, most commonly on the first printing. The jacket has a medium blue field all around. The front announces the title in white, beneath which appears, in color and framed in red, Tolkien&#x27;s illustration of Hobbiton. The reverse displays Tolkien&#x27;s illustration of Smaug on his trove, also in color.

A series of changes to the book suggest that Houghton Mifflin printed the first edition several times. The earliest copies show the same bowing hobbit emblem on the title page as is visible on the cover, but in outline. The first printing appeared on March 1, 1938. This earliest printing also has no half-title page. At some point the publisher replaced the emblem on the title page with a seated flautist. The first two printings mistakenly identify Chapter VII as Chapter VI on page 118, a defect corrected in the third. The binding&#x27;s cloth changes slightly in color and texture in step with other changes. The first printing&#x27;s table of illustrations lists Thrór&#x27;s map as the front endpaper, in accordance with the text (page 30) but contradicting the actual order. The later printings of the first edition list the Wilderland map as the front endpaper, in accordance with the actual order but contradicting the text.

(Regarding the bowing Hobbit emblem, some say the boots the hobbit wears conflicted with the text&#x27;s description of a bare-footed hobbit, prompting the publisher to replace it. Yet the device comes directly from Tolkien&#x27;s picture of Bilbo bowing to Smaug on his horde of treasure. Tolkien defended the boots to an astute reader by explaining that Bilbo had acquired them along the way.)

Hammond &amp; Anderson refer to these variations as &quot;states&quot; within the &quot;first printing&quot;, and recorded only two: one with the bowing hobbit on the title page, and one with the seated flautist. Houghton Mifflin&#x27;s practice was to place the publication year at the foot of the title page for the first printings of its first editions. All first edition Hobbit copies, of all variations, with or without the bowing hobbit of the first printing, show &quot;1938&quot; as the date on the title page, perhaps discouraging bibliographers from ascribing different printings to them.

Other library bindings have been reported. A red library binding with yellow title and a simple geometric design in black, and including free-leaf maps, has been seen with the stamp &quot;New Method Book Bindery&quot;, a company well known in the trade at the time (later becoming &quot;Bound to Stay Bound Books Inc&quot;.)

All printings of the first edition measure 15.0 x 21.0 cm. They contain 310 numbered pages.

=== The second edition ===

==== Basics ====

Tolkien began work on &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; in the years after &quot;The Hobbit&#x27;s&quot; publication. As the story evolved, Tolkien realized he needed to change how Bilbo and Gollum interacted in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; to suit the plot of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. He also wrote a new version of the introductory note to explain an apparent discrepancy between the map, saying that Thrain had been king under the mountain despite Thorin&#x27;s father Thrain never having held that title. This was explained as the map referring to a distant ancestor, Thrain I. However, this introduced contradictions with the text, such as statements that Erebor had been founded in the time of Thorin&#x27;s grandfather, thus precluding an ancient Thrain I having ruled there. These issues were eventually addressed with changes for the third edition. Allen &amp; Unwin prepared a new edition of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; for release in 1951, and Houghton Mifflin followed suit. These American impressions from the 5th through the 14th were bound from sheets printed in Great Britain, corresponding to the same George Allen &amp; Unwin printings of the second edition. Unlike the AU printings, the American copies do not state the printing until the 18th in the second edition, making them very difficult to identify in isolation. The only exceptions are the 11th, 12th, and one of the two variants of the 5th impression, each of which states the full printing history. The following list of &quot;points&quot; was developed by Strebe by comparing unknown American printings to known British printings. Steve Frisby untangled the 9th printing, which differs from its Allen &amp; Unwin counterpart on page 315. (This divergence likely resulted from the cancel title pages AU was obliged to supply when they converted 9th printing sheets intended for British domestic use into Houghton Mifflin sets.) Information regarding the print run sizes of the Second American Edition of the Hobbit is held by the University of Reading Special Collections Service.

The American second editions from the 5th through 14th printings measure 12.7 x 19.0 cm, contain 315 numbered pages, and have end-paper maps printed in black, white, and red. The frontispiece is printed in color, but the remaining color plates of the first edition have been eliminated. With the exception of the 5th printing, the cover design is similar to the American first edition, only smaller, differently colored, and lacking the bowing hobbit emblem on the front board. Both variants of the 5th printing, on the other hand, are bound identically to the British printings, with the only distinction being the notation &quot;Houghton Mifflin Company&quot; at the base of the book&#x27;s spine.

==== Print runs ====

The following table lists the printing dates, export dates, and number of sheets exported from George Allen &amp; Unwin to Houghton Mifflin across the second edition, as determined from George Allen &amp; Unwin records. The &quot;Stated&quot; date is the date listed in the corresponding UK impression&#x27;s printing history on the copyright page.

====5th printing variants====

Houghton Mifflin issued two distinct variants corresponding to the British 5th printing.

The earlier variant (5a) is constructed in a similar style to the subsequent American printings of the second edition. That is, the title page states &quot;Houghton Mifflin Company - Boston, The Riverside Press - Cambridge&quot;, and the book lacks the printing history and colophon entirely. Even so, the sheets for the text body came from A&amp;U and thus are identical to the British 5th printing.

The later variant (5b) is identical to the British 5th printing in every regard except for the &quot;Houghton Mifflin&quot; notation at the base of the spine. In particular, the title page states &quot;London, George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd, Museum Street&quot;; the colophon shows the A&amp;U St. George and the Dragon insignia and the addresses of the publishers offices worldwide; and the title page verso shows the full printing history.

====Dust-jackets====

American second edition dust-jackets are nearly identical to British, except that Houghton Mifflin is printed at the bottom of the spine instead of George Allen Unwin. The design is basically unchanged from the original 1937 edition of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. Dust-jackets declare the impression and often may be used to ascertain at least the approximate printing of the book. Sometimes, however, the publisher put dust-jackets from one printing onto books of a neighboring printing. Also lost, damaged or discarded dust-jackets are sometimes replaced with ones acquired elsewhere. Hence the jacket cannot be considered definitive.

==== Collation ====

The 5th and 6th impression signature marks are at the bottom center:
[B] on page 17, henceforth incrementing one letter every 16 pages.
[*] on page 307.

The 7th, 8th, and 9th impression signature marks start with [B] on page 17, henceforth incrementing one letter every 32 pages.
[*] on page 307.

Signature marks change on the 10th impression: [A*] at the bottom of the Table of Contents; [B] at bottom left of page 33 etc. These signature marks remain unchanged through the 14th impression.

==== Paper ====

Paper weight, measured as thickness, varies from printing to printing. Generally the earlier impressions are thinner than the later. Measurements exclude the binding and end papers; they start from the half-title page and extend to the last story page. The leaves should be pressed tightly when measuring. Measurements are rounded to the nearest half millimeter.

==== Binding ====

The 5th through 14th impressions come in a variety of colors. Generally all the books from one printing are bound in the same color, but exceptions may have been found, perhaps when bindings intended for one printing were left over and found use at the beginning of the next printing. Hence the color of the covers cannot conclusively identify a book.

==== Advertisements ====

Commencing with the 7th impression, the final page of the story advertises &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. The distance between the advertisement and the main body of the text varies from impression to impression. Here the distance is measured from the baseline of the last line of the story&#x27;s text down to the baseline of the first line of the advertisement.

* The 5th impression advertises &quot;Farmer Giles of Ham&quot; on the reverse of the half-title page.
* The 6th impression advertises &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; on the reverse of the half-title page but not on the last page of the text. 
* The 6th through 13th impressions advertise &quot;Farmer Giles of Ham&quot; and &quot;Lord of the Rings*&quot; on the reverse of the half-title page.
* The 14th impression advertises &quot;The Adventures of Tom Bombadil&quot;, &quot;Farmer Giles of Ham&quot;, and &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; on the reverse of the half-title page.
* The 15th impression of the Allen &amp; Unwin British edition advertises &quot;The Adventures of Tom Bombadil&quot;, &quot;Farmer Giles of Ham&quot;, &quot;(The) Lord of the Rings&quot;, and &quot;Tree and Leaf&quot; on the reverse of the half-title page. Houghton Mifflin probably did not issue a printing from these sheets.

* The advertisement for &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; on the half-title page is missing &quot;&#x27;The&quot;&#x27; until the 24th printing.

====Printing flaws====

Starting with the 7th impression, the first &quot;o&quot; on page 22 is broken at 5:00 o&#x27;clock.

The 13th impression, on the bottom of page 315, displays an illegible &quot;ab&quot; in &quot;you will learn a lot more &quot;&#x27;ab&quot;out them&quot;. The 7th through 12th impressions, on the other hand, are clean. The illegible &quot;ab&quot; persists throughout remaining printings of the second edition, both British and American.

==== Later printings of second edition ====

Houghton Mifflin enlarged the book to 14.0 x 21.0 cm commencing with the 15th printing, probably in 1964. At that point they abandoned importing sheets from George Allen and Unwin. Parallel to the single British 15th printing, Houghton Mifflin reprinted &quot;The Hobbit&quot; nine times from their own plates until the advent of the third edition. They dropped the red color from the maps and removed the color frontispiece so that no color remained in the book&#x27;s interior. The 15th and remaining printings of the second edition are bound in light green with lettering in dark blue. Beginning with the 18th impression the volumes state the printing number on the reverse of the title page. The 23rd impression is the final impression of the second edition.

The 24th printing belongs to the third edition: it replaces the second edition&#x27;s description of the revised edition with a description of runes; the type is completely reset; and the page count increases to 317.

While the Allen and Unwin sheets appear to have been printed from Linotype plates, clues suggest that Houghton Mifflin opted to filmset the later printings of the second edition. They did not phototypeset new plates; rather they seem to have photographed the 14th impression. While the sheets are larger, the type block itself is identical. All the print surface flaws that the Allen and Unwin plates had accumulated up to that point were faithfully reproduced in film for the remaining printings. Because any number of copies of the film can be made and stored for future use, the type does not degrade from printing to printing the way it would with Linotype. If the film tears or loses its crispness, it may simply be replaced with a duplicate. Indeed, the 23rd impression&#x27;s type block is effectively identical.

By settling on a single binding color and dropping all color from the interior, Houghton Mifflin cheapened later printings of the second edition, making them less &#x27;collectible&#x27;.

=== The third edition ===

In 1965, finding a grey area in copyright law and irregularities in Houghton Mifflin&#x27;s copyright and import compliance, publisher Ace Books issued a paperback edition of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; against Tolkien&#x27;s wishes. Already aware of potential copyright weakness and now having learned of Ace&#x27;s plans, that same year George Allen &amp; Unwin asked Tolkien to prepare a list of revisions to both &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, so that their copyrights could be renewed. Several dozen short changes were then introduced in the next few impressions of The Hobbit, starting with the 24th printing in 1966 and being complete by 1968. These were primarily minor stylistic variations (e.g. &quot;They hadn&#x27;t been riding...&quot; to &quot;They had not been riding...&quot;) and revisions to bring the story more in line with Tolkien&#x27;s latest ideas about the broader mythology of his Middle-earth stories. Collectively, these changes are considered the third edition. The printings of the standard third edition are not marked as such. Instead, they list their printing on the reverse of the title page in the original succession, dating right back to the first UK printing. They are bound identically to the later printings of the second edition. The first impression of the third edition is the one marked as the 24th printing with a copyright date of 1966. Second editions contain the original description of the revised edition, beginning with, &quot;In this reprint several minor inaccuracies...&quot;. The third edition&#x27;s foreword, on the other hand, describes the runic characters seen on the maps and in the text. It commences with, &quot;This is a story of long ago.&quot; Also, third editions contain 317 numbered pages, as compared to the 315 of the second edition.

<doc id="387188" wikidata="Q319315" url="?curid=387188" title="Colorado tick fever">
<text>Colorado tick fever (CTF) is a viral infection (Coltivirus) transmitted from the bite of an infected Rocky Mountain wood tick (&quot;Dermacentor andersoni&quot;). It should not be confused with the bacterial tick-borne infection, Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Colorado tick fever is probably the same disease that American pioneers referred to as &quot;mountain fever&quot;.

Colorado tick fever virus (CTFV) infects haemopoietic cells, particularly erythrocytes, which explains how the virus is transmitted by ticks and also accounts for the incidence of transmission by blood transfusion.

==Signs and symptoms==
The first signs and symptoms of Colorado Tick Fever are shown between the 1 and 14th day after the bite from the tick. Once bit by the tick and the onset of symptoms is presented, one will more often than not experience a biphasic fever. A biphasic fever, is a fever that will attack, only to let you feel better, just to infect you once again. Although the virus may only last a couple of weeks, the Virus can be found in the red blood cells for up to 6 months after being cured .

Initial symptoms include fever, chills, headaches, pain behind the eyes, light sensitivity, muscle pain, generalized malaise, abdominal pain, hepatosplenomegaly, nausea and vomiting, and a flat or pimply rash. During the second phase of the virus, a high fever can return with an increase in symptoms. CTF can be very severe in cases involving children and can even require hospitalization. Complications with this disease have included aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, and hemorrhagic fever, but these are rare.

CTF is seasonal, mostly occurring in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States and usually in altitudes from 4,000 to 10,000 feet (1,600 to 3,000 meters). Patients with CTF are mostly campers and young males, who most likely have been bitten because of their activities.

==Cause==
===Virology===

The virus particle, like other coltiviruses, is about 80 nm in diameter and is generally not enveloped. The double-stranded RNA viral genome is about 20,000 bp long and is divided into 12 segments, which are termed Seg-1 to Seg-12. Viral replication in infected cells is associated with characteristic cytoplasmic granular matrices. Evidence suggests the viral presence in mature erythrocytes is a result of replication of the virus in hematopoietic erythrocyte precursor cells and simultaneous maturation of the infected immature cells rather than of direct entry and replication of CTFV in mature erythrocytes.

===Tick===

The Rocky Mountain wood tick is usually found attached to a host, but when it is without a host, it hides in cracks and crevices, as well as soil. If for some reason the tick is not able to find a host before the winter, it will stay under ground cover until spring, when it can resume its search. The behavior of the Rocky Mountain wood tick varies with its life stages: adults are active as early as March, peaking in April and May, while nymphs and larvae are active around April and June respectively. By late summer or early fall, all these stages typically disappear. Small mammals are common hosts for larvae and nymphs, while adults generally feed on larger mammals such as horses, cattle, and deer.

===Transmission===
Colorado tick fever (CTF) is transmitted through the bite of an infected Rocky Mountain wood tick. The ticks become carriers of the CTF virus by feeding on infected reservoir animals like small rodents. Transmission from a tick to person is the most common cause of infection. Person-to-person transmission is not typical but can occur rarely through blood transfusions. Post-infection, the CTF virus can linger in red blood cells for several months, hence, blood and bone marrow donations are discouraged for six months following infection.

==Diagnosis==
A combination of clinical signs, symptoms, and laboratory tests can confirm the likelihood of having CTF. Some tests include complement fixation to Colorado tick virus, immunofluorescence for Colorado tick fever, and some other common laboratory findings suggestive of CTF, including leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, and mildly elevated liver enzyme levels.

Detection of viral antibodies on red blood cells is possible.

==Prevention==

To avoid tick bites and infection, experts advise:
* Avoid tick-infested areas, especially during the warmer months.
* Wear light-colored clothing so ticks can be easily seen. Wear a long sleeved shirt, hat, long pants, and tuck pant legs into socks.
* Walk in the center of trails to avoid overhanging grass and brush.
* Clothing and body parts should be checked every few hours for ticks when spending time outdoors in tick-infested areas. Ticks are most often found on the thigh, arms, underarms, and legs. Ticks can be very small (no bigger than a pinhead). Look carefully for new &quot;freckles&quot;.
* The use of insect repellents containing DEET on skin or permethrin on clothing can be effective. Follow the directions on the container and wash off repellents when going indoors.
* Remove attached ticks immediately.

Contracting the CTF virus is thought to provide long-lasting immunity against reinfection. However, it is always wise to be on the safe side and try to prevent tick bites.

==Treatment==

No specific treatment for CTF is yet available. The first action is to make sure the tick is fully removed from the skin, then acetaminophen and analgesics can be used to help relieve the fever and pain. Aspirin is not recommended for children, as it has been linked to Reye’s syndrome in some viral illnesses. Salicylates should not be used because of thrombocytopenia, and the rare occurrence of bleeding disorders. People who suspect they have been bitten by a tick or are starting to show signs of CTF should contact their physicians immediately.

===Tick removal===
Ticks should be removed promptly and carefully with tweezers and by applying gentle, steady traction. The tick&#x27;s body should not be crushed when it is removed and the tweezers should be placed as close to the skin as possible to avoid leaving tick mouthparts in the skin. Mouthparts left in the skin can allow secondary infections. Ticks should not be removed with bare hands. Hands should be protected by gloves or tissues and thoroughly washed with soap and water after the removal process.

A match or flame should not be used to remove a tick. This method, once thought safe, can cause the tick to regurgitate expelling any disease it may be carrying into the bite wound.

==Epidemiology==
The disease develops from March to September, with the highest infections occurring in June. The disease is found almost exclusively in the western United States and Canada, mostly in high mountain areas such as Colorado and Idaho. The CTFV was first isolated from human blood in 1944.

<doc id="387199" wikidata="Q1059178" url="?curid=387199" title="Open-source intelligence">
<text>Open source intelligence (OSINT) is the collection and analysis of data gathered from open sources (overt sources and publicly available information) to produce actionable intelligence. OSINT is primarily used in national security, law enforcement, and business intelligence functions and is of value to analysts who use non-sensitive intelligence in answering classified, unclassified, or proprietary intelligence requirements across the previous intelligence disciplines.

== Categories ==
OSINT sources can be divided up into six different categories of information flow:

*Media: print newspapers, magazines, radio, and television from across and between countries.
*Internet: online publications, blogs, discussion groups, citizen media (i.e. – cell phone videos, and user created content), YouTube, and other social media websites (i.e. – Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.). This source also outpaces a variety of other sources due to its timeliness and ease of access.
*Public government data: public government reports, budgets, hearings, telephone directories, press conferences, websites, and speeches. Although this source comes from an official source they are publicly accessible and may be used openly and freely.
*Professional and academic publications: information acquired from journals, conferences, symposia, academic papers, dissertations, and theses.
*Commercial data: commercial imagery, financial and industrial assessments, and databases.
*Grey literature: technical reports, preprints, patents, working papers, business documents, unpublished works, and newsletters.

OSINT is distinguished from research in that it applies the process of intelligence to create tailored knowledge supportive of a specific decision by a specific individual or group.

== OSINT collection methodologies ==
Collecting open-source intelligence is achieved in a variety of different ways, such as:

* Social Media Intelligence, which is acquired from viewing or observing a subjects online social profile activity.
* Search engine data mining or scraping.
* Public records checking.
* Information matching and verification from data broker services.

==Definition==
OSINT, broadly defined, involves gathering and analyzing publicly accessible information to produce actionable insights.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security defines OSINT as intelligence derived from publicly available information, collected and disseminated promptly to address specific intelligence needs.

NATO describes OSINT as intelligence obtained from publicly available information and other unclassified data with limited public distribution or access.

The European Union defines OSINT as the collecting and analyzing information from open sources to generate actionable intelligence, supporting areas like national security, law enforcement, and business intelligence.

The United Nations has also recognized OSINT’s potential, noting its value in monitoring member states’ compliance with international regulations across various sectors, including public health and human rights.

In the private sector, companies like IBM define OSINT as the process of gathering and analyzing publicly available information to assess threats, inform decisions, or answer specific questions. Similarly, cybersecurity firms such as CrowdStrike describe OSINT as the act of collecting and analyzing publicly available data for intelligence purposes.

==History==

OSINT practices have been documented as early as the mid-19th century in the United States and early 20th century in the United Kingdom.

OSINT in the United States traces its origins to the 1941 creation of the Foreign Broadcast Monitoring Service (FBMS), an agency responsible for the monitoring of foreign broadcasts. An example of their work was the correlation of changes in the price of oranges in Paris with successful bombings of railway bridges during World War II.

The Aspin-Brown Commission stated in 1996 that US access to open sources was &quot;severely deficient&quot; and that this should be a &quot;top priority&quot; for both funding and DCI attention.

In July 2004, following the September 11 attacks, the 9/11 Commission recommended the creation of an open-source intelligence agency. In March 2005, the Iraq Intelligence Commission recommended the creation of an open-source directorate at the CIA.

Following these recommendations, in November 2005 the Director of National Intelligence announced the creation of the DNI Open Source Center. The Center was established to collect information available from &quot;the Internet, databases, press, radio, television, video, geospatial data, photos and commercial imagery.&quot; In addition to collecting openly available information, it would train analysts to make better use of this information. The center absorbed the CIA&#x27;s previously existing Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS), originally established in 1941, with FBIS head Douglas Naquin named as director of the center. Then, following the events of 9/11 the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act merged FBIS and other research elements into the Office of the Director of National Intelligence creating the Open Source Enterprise.

Furthermore, the private sector has invested in tools which aid in OSINT collection and analysis. Specifically, In-Q-Tel, a Central Intelligence Agency supported venture capital firm in Arlington, VA assisted companies develop web-monitoring and predictive analysis tools.

In December 2005, the Director of National Intelligence appointed Eliot A. Jardines as the Assistant Deputy Director of National Intelligence for Open Source to serve as the Intelligence Community&#x27;s senior intelligence officer for open source and to provide strategy, guidance and oversight for the National Open Source Enterprise. Mr. Jardines has established the National Open Source Enterprise and authored intelligence community directive 301. In 2008, Mr. Jardines returned to the private sector and was succeeded by Dan Butler who is ADDNI/OS and previously Mr. Jardines&#x27; Senior Advisor for Policy.

=== Tools ===

The web browser is a powerful OSINT tool that provides access to numerous websites and both open source and proprietary software tools that are either purpose-built for open source information collection or which can be exploited for the purposes of either gathering of open source information or to facilitate analysis and validation to provide intelligence. A cottage industry of both for-profit and not-for-profit investigative and educational groups such as Bellingcat, IntelTechniques, SANS and others offer indices, books, podcasts and video training materials on OSINT tools and techniques. Books such as Michael Bazzell&#x27;s &quot;Open Source Intelligence Techniques&quot; serve as indices to resources across multiple domains but according the author, due to the rapidly changing information landscape, some tools and techniques change or become obsolete frequently, hence it is imperative for OSINT researchers to study, train and survey the landscape of source material regularly. A guide by Ryan Fedasiuk, an analyst at the Center for Security and Emerging Technology, lists six tools open-source analysts can use to stay safe and utilize operational security (OPSEC) when conducting online investigations. These include VPNs, cached webpages, digital archive services, URL and file scanners, browser sandbox applications, and antivirus software.

Numerous lists of aggregated OSINT content are available on the web. The OSINT Framework contains over 30 primary categories of tools and is maintained as an open source project on GitHub.

== Risks for practitioners ==
A main hindrance to practical OSINT is the volume of information it has to deal with information explosion. The amount of data being distributed increases at a rate that it becomes difficult to evaluate sources in intelligence analysis. To a small degree the work has sometimes been done by amateur crowd-sourcing.

Private individuals illegally collecting data for a foreign military or intelligence agency is considered espionage in most countries. Espionage that is not treason (e.g. betraying one&#x27;s country of citizenship) has been a tool of statecraft since ancient times.

==Professional associations and certifications==
The OSINT Foundation is a professional association for OSINT practitioners in the United States Intelligence Community. It is open to U.S. Citizens and seeks to raise the prominence of the open-source intelligence discipline.

OSMOSIS (an association for OSINT professionals) provides courses and conferences that lead to the designation of being Open-Source Certified (OSC). OSMOSIS is an offshoot of the Hetherington Group, a private investigation and corporate &amp; market intelligence group. According to the OSC, its goal is to &quot;help standardize our profession and demonstrate that our members are Legal, Ethical, and Competent practitioners of investigating and analyzing Publicly Available Information.&quot; Further they state that, &quot;To obtain the OSC designation, practitioners must meet certain requirements to demonstrate dedication to their craft and pass a 100-question exam.&quot;

The company IntelTechniques offers online and live training that can lead to the Open Source Intelligence Professional Certification (OSIP) and/or help individual practitioners develop and formalize their skills, sans certification. Their certification program &quot;provides participants with an opportunity to work through a real-world scenario and demonstrate that they can produce an intelligence product that meets a high professional standard.&quot; In addition to their training program, IntelTechniques.com offers a community that serves supports those seeking the OSIP certificiation, but is also open to practitioners who enroll in the training program itself without the intention of seeking certificiation. This community facilitates an exchange of information about best practices, the training itself and tradecraft &amp; methodology in a moderated environment.

Other organizations including Bellingcat, offer training as well other options for OSINT practitioners to associate and exchange information on OSINT best practices and issues.

<doc id="387215" wikidata="Q2418760" url="?curid=387215" title="Crystal (character)">
<text>Crystal (Crystalia Amaquelin) is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Crystal first appeared in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #45 (Dec. 1965) and was created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby.

Within the Marvel Universe, Crystal is a member of a fictional human subspecies known as Inhumans, who (due to genetic modifications performed by the Kree) became capable of developing superhuman abilities once exposed to the Terrigen Mist. Exposure to the Terrigen Mist grants abilities to psionically control the four classical elements: earth, wind, fire, and water and, by extension, can also grant the ability to manipulate various other natural materials and phenomena such as metals and electricity. Crystal was the first character to be identified as an Inhuman, and is one of the most prominent Inhuman characters. Crystal is a princess of the Inhuman Royal Family and sister to Medusa, Queen of the Inhumans. She often appears with her giant super-powered canine companion, Lockjaw.

The character has regularly appeared as a main character in several comic book titles, including various incarnations of the &quot;Inhumans&quot; as well as the &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; and the &quot;Avengers&quot;. The character is unique in her affiliation with all three of these groups. Earlier in her history, she was romantically involved with the Human Torch from the Fantastic Four. In later stories, she becomes more associated with the X-Men family of characters due to her short-lived marriage to Quicksilver, which resulted in the conception of their daughter, Luna. Crystal has also appeared in various other Marvel media such as television series and video games, as well as merchandise such as trading cards and action figures.

Crystal has been described as one of Marvel&#x27;s most notable and powerful female heroes.

She made her live action debut in the 2017 Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) television series &quot;Inhumans&quot;, portrayed by Isabelle Cornish.

==Publication history==
Crystal first appeared in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #45 (Dec. 1965), written by Stan Lee and illustrated by Jack Kirby, titled &quot;Among Us Hide...The Inhumans&quot;. When asked, &quot;Who created the Inhumans, you or Stan Lee?&quot; in a 1968 interview for &quot;Excelsior&quot; magazine, Jack Kirby replied, &quot;I did.&quot; Like other early Fantastic Four characters, there is debate about how much Stan Lee and Jack Kirby each contributed to the characters&#x27; creation.

Throughout her many appearances, Crystal has been depicted as brave, intelligent, and compassionate. While she is undoubtedly very kind and emotional, this is in stark contrast to her remarkable power, and she is more than capable of defending herself and others.

===Fantastic Four (1965–1973)===
Crystal was first introduced, along with the rest of the Inhuman Royal Family and the Inhuman race as a whole, in the pages of &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;. Upon their first meeting, she and Johnny Storm fell in love with one another, a fact that led to her continued presence among the team. From this time, she would become a mainstay of the team for the duration of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby&#x27;s stint on the series. She was the first character to join the Fantastic Four, outside of its original members, when she officially joined the team as a replacement for Sue Richards, who was pregnant with Franklin Richards. She remained a member of the team, even after Sue&#x27;s return. During her time with the team, she became very close to its members, particularly Ben Grimm and accompanied them on many adventures. Crystal was written out of &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; in issue #105, the first story arc after Jack Kirby&#x27;s departure. At this time, the character returned to her family in Attilan due to her apparent inability to survive long-term in Earth&#x27;s polluted atmosphere. Her time with the team and her status as a friend and ally would continue to be part of her identity as a character, up to the present.

===Quicksilver and Luna (1973–1990)===
After her return to Attilan, Crystal meets and falls in love with Quicksilver, Pietro Maximoff. During this time, Crystal is mostly featured alongside Quicksilver in a number of different series including &quot;Inhumans&quot; and &quot;Vision and the Scarlet Witch&quot;, along with guest appearances in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;, &quot;Avengers&quot;, and other titles. In addition to her marriage to Quicksilver, this time period saw the introduction of Luna, the daughter of Crystal and Pietro and the development of close friendship between Crystal and Pietro&#x27;s twin sister, Scarlet Witch (Wanda Maximoff), and her then-husband, Vision. In Steve Englehart&#x27;s series, &quot;Vision and the Scarlet Witch&quot; vol. 2 (1986), Crystal has an affair with Vision and Wanda&#x27;s &quot;regular Joe&quot; neighbor, Norm Webster. Crystal is purported to have committed this betrayal as a result of her mistreatment by Pietro. A few months later in &quot;X-Factor&quot; Annual #2 (October 1987), it is revealed that the behavior exhibited by both Crystal and Pietro was the result of mind control orchestrated by Maximus. From 1987 to 1988, Crystal again rejoins the eponymous team in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;, which was also being written by Steve Englehart, at the time. Crystal departs the team abruptly in &quot;Fantastic Four Annual&quot; #21 after being convinced to do so by her king and brother-in-law, Black Bolt. The artwork at the end of the issue features character pages for the Fantastic Four and many supporting characters. Despite this being Crystal&#x27;s last issue, her character page reads &quot;It&#x27;s great to be back with the Fantastic Four! I&#x27;ll never leave again!&quot;

===Avenger (1991–1998)===
Crystal has also appeared as a member of the Avengers. She was a prominent member of the main Avengers team for the term of Bob Harras&#x27; time as writer for the title, but declined in prominence shortly after he left to become Editor-in-Chief of Marvel Comics. In addition to starring in &quot;Avengers&quot;, the character also appeared in the solo books of her Avengers teammates during these years such as &quot;Captain America&quot;, &quot;Invincible Iron Man&quot;, and &quot;The Vision&quot;. While serving on the team, the character lived in Avengers Mansion with Luna and her nanny, Marilla. During this time period, the character would attempt to reconcile with Quicksilver off-and-on. Crystal was featured as an Avenger through many important storylines and events including &quot;&quot;, &quot;Infinity War&quot;, &quot;Infinity Crusade&quot;, &quot;Bloodties&quot;, &quot;Onslaught&quot;, and &quot;Heroes Return&quot;. Crystal proved invaluable to the team many times during her tenure and was well-loved by her teammates. The character also featured prominently in the series &quot;Quicksilver&quot; toward the end of her tour as an active Avenger.

===Return to Attilan (1998–2007)===
This time period was a departure from Crystal&#x27;s previous appearances because it marked the first time the character had returned to Attilan by her own choice for a significant amount of time since she first encountered the Fantastic Four. Crystal appeared in &quot;Inhumans&quot; vol. 2 (1998–1999), a limited series by Paul Jenkins and Jae Lee. The series, which was part of the Marvel Knights line, was critically acclaimed, popular with readers, and earned Jenkins an Eisner Award. From 2000 to 2005, the character mostly made guest appearances in &quot;Avengers&quot;, &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;, and other titles. &quot;Son of M&quot; (2006) and &quot;Silent War&quot; (2007), written by David Hine would bring the next major arc for Crystal. These books chronicled Quicksilver&#x27;s betrayal of Crystal and the Inhumans in an attempt to use the Terrigen Mist to restore the mutants depowered during the events of &quot;House of M&quot; and the resulting conflict between Attilan and a fictional version of the United States.

===Cosmic Inhumans (2008–2013)===
This time period marked another new development for Crystal&#x27;s character as she and her fellow Inhumans became involved in intergalactic conflicts. &quot;Secret Invasion: Inhumans&quot; (2008–2009) by Joe Pokaski marked the beginning as it was discovered that Black Bolt had been replaced by a Skrull. This revelation leads to a series of events that eventually sees the Inhumans ascend to become sovereigns of the Kree Empire and Crystal betrothed to Ronan the Accuser. Crystal was then featured through a series of books by Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning including &quot;War of Kings&quot; (2009), &quot;Realm of Kings: Inhumans&quot; (2010), and &quot;The Thanos Imperative&quot; (2010). During this time, Crystal showed her prowess not only as a warrior, but as a leader, as she and her family navigated political and military conflicts, particularly against Vulcan and the Shi&#x27;ar Imperium. From 2010 to 2013, her story continues in the pages of &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; and &quot;FF&quot;, in which she is forcibly separated from Ronan against both of their wishes. Although present in &quot;Infinity&quot; (2013) and &quot;Inhumanity&quot; (2013–2014), which, under new authorship, continue the events portrayed in Abnett and Lanning&#x27;s aforementioned series, she does not play a major part in these books.

===All-New, All-Different Marvel (2015–)===
Despite her unexplained absence in Charles Soule&#x27;s Marvel NOW! series &quot;Inhuman&quot; (2014–2015), Marvel has indicated that Crystal will be returning to the spotlight as a part of their All-New, All-Different Marvel initiative. She has been announced to appear in the upcoming &quot;Uncanny Inhumans&quot; series, and leaked information indicated the character would be featured in a starring role in &quot;All-New Inhumans&quot;, both also written by Charles Soule. The character has also appeared on the teaser image for &quot;All-New All-Different Marvel Point One&quot;, which is to be an introduction to the new series that are being launched as a part of All-New, All-Different Marvel. On August 19, 2015, it was officially announced that Crystal would be the leader of a team of Inhumans in &quot;All-New Inhumans&quot;, which will be co-written by Charles Soule and James Asmus with art by Stefano Caselli. &quot;These stories follow a diplomatic mission/covert strike team effort led by Crystal,&quot; relates Asmus. &quot;She&#x27;s been at the center of the Inhumans, but also served as an Avenger, alongside the Fantastic Four, and even dabbled with the X-Men when she was married to Quicksilver. She&#x27;s been a constant presence in the Marvel Universe, but leading this faction of NuHumans is her stepping up in a big way.&quot; The character&#x27;s appearance has been significantly changed, having an updated costume and a pixie cut.
==Fictional character biography==
Crystal is the daughter of Inhumans Quelin and Ambur, and lived in Attilan with the other Inhumans, until the Inhuman Royal Family was forced out of the Great Refuge by Maximus. Her first encounters with the outside world were via the Fantastic Four. She encountered the Human Torch, and brought him to the Inhumans&#x27; secret New York base. She left New York with her family members to escape the Seeker, but became trapped inside Maximus&#x27; &quot;negative zone&quot; barrier dome around the Great Refuge. She fell in love with the Human Torch, although their romance was blocked by a literal barrier, around the Inhumans&#x27; city. The Inhumans were eventually freed from the &quot;negative zone&quot; barrier, and left the Great Refuge along with the Royal Family to visit the outside world. She brought Triton to rescue Mister Fantastic from the real Negative Zone and aided the Fantastic Four in battle against Blastaar.

===Joining the Fantastic Four===
Crystal would later leave the city for a brief career with the Fantastic Four. Soon after joining, she battled the Wizard, and helped defeat Maximus. She also fought Doctor Doom alongside the Fantastic Four. She was temporarily blinded by the Mole Man, but helped the Fantastic Four defeat him. She was abducted by Medusa and reunited with the Torch in Attilan. She revealed how she had used her powers to save Black Bolt&#x27;s life, and then rejoined the Fantastic Four. She fell under the mental control of Diablo, but soon regained her free will and returned to the Great Refuge.

===Marriage===
It was later revealed how she had rescued a dying Quicksilver (Pietro Maximoff). She chose Quicksilver over the Torch as the man she loved. Not long after that, she married Quicksilver. She later gave birth to their daughter, Luna, and accompanied the Inhumans when Attilan was relocated to Earth&#x27;s Moon. During the time when the Inhumans lived on the Moon, Crystal defied the power structure of her society and fled with many Inhumans to an isolated part of Earth. They were there to help Medusa, their queen, give birth in secret. Crystal used her powers to eliminate the pollution from a wide area around their hideout, a mistake which led to even worse consequences.

Quicksilver and Crystal have had a rocky marriage. Pietro has always had a quick temper and Crystal had once had an affair with a real estate agent named Norman Webster. She and the Human Torch still had feelings for each other during his marriage to the supposed Alicia Masters (later revealed to be a Skrull named Lyja merely pretending to be Alicia). She also developed feelings for Dane Whitman, the Black Knight, but nothing physical came from it. These reasons have caused them to separate several times, egged on by Maximus the Mad taking credit for Pietro&#x27;s descent into madness. One such reconciliation attempt occurred in a small town, in a rented cabin, where Crystal had to urge Quicksilver to &quot;go slow&quot;. Unfortunately, even this was affected by outside forces.

===Joining the Avengers===
At one point, Crystal summoned the Avengers to help battle the Brethren. Soon after, she joined the Avengers as a provisional member. Shortly after that, she became a full Avengers member. During Crystal&#x27;s time with the Avengers, Magneto&#x27;s Acolytes kidnapped her daughter, causing great damage to the mansion. Luna ended up in Genosha under the control of the Acolytes. The Avengers teamed up with the X-Men and managed to recover her safely.

===Decimation===
After the events of &quot;House of M&quot;, Crystal was reunited with her depowered husband, only for him to steal the Terrigen Mist from Attilan, in an attempt to use it to restore the depowered mutants. He also kidnapped Luna and exposed her to the mists, granting her various abilities. Luna had previously been baseline human, thought of by some as an affront to her mutant heritage.

===Silent War===
When the Inhumans located Quicksilver, he allowed Black Bolt to beat him, in response to his betrayal. Crystal and Quicksilver&#x27;s marriage was annulled and she participated in a series of battles against S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Mighty Avengers when the Inhumans declared war on United States.

===Secret Invasion===
Crystal and her sister Medusa are called upon by Iron Man to a meeting where he reveals Black Bolt has been replaced by a Skrull. When the Skrulls invade Attilan, Crystal uses her abilities to defeat a Skrull who possesses the powers of Colossus, Cyclops, and Wolverine, and a Skrull who is an amalgam of Captain America and Spider-Man. After an attack on Attilan by the Skrulls, the Royal Family travel into Kree space, seeking an alliance against the invading Skrulls. Ronan the Accuser welcomes this alliance, but only on the condition that Crystal becomes his bride. Medusa agrees, much to Crystal&#x27;s chagrin.

In an attempt to crack the Skrull communication network, the Inhumans split up. Crystal and Medusa infiltrate Thundra&#x27;s tribe as fellow tribeswomen. However, when they argue, per the tribe&#x27;s laws, their squabble is moved to the arena. In their fight, Crystal gets Medusa to treat her more like an adult and allow her to speak to Thundra. She negotiates the release of a captured Skrull communications officer, enabling them to track down Black Bolt&#x27;s prison.

===War of Kings===
Crystal&#x27;s marriage to Ronan proceeds, even following Black Bolt&#x27;s decision to usurp the throne of the Kree. She comes to accept the idea of the marriage, defending it to her sister-in-law Polaris as a matter of statecraft (though there are indications that Ronan wishes for more). The wedding proceedings are interrupted by the Shi&#x27;ar Imperial Guard, who attack as part of Emperor Vulcan&#x27;s invasion of the Kree Imperium. Ronan is beaten nearly to death in this attack. While visiting Ronan in recuperation, Crystal inadvertently helps rally the Kree people when she shows compassion towards a ward filled with injured Kree commoners, acts which (thanks to her sister in law Polaris) were eventually broadcast over the Kree networks. This has led to her being referred to as the &quot;people&#x27;s princess&quot; among some of the Kree people.

When Black Bolt attempted to set off an explosion that would spread the Terrigen Mists across the galaxy, reasoning that this action would render all equal, Crystal defied his orders and risked her life to take Lockjaw to confront him, disabling the Terrigen qualities of the explosion and convincing Black Bolt that the powers that would be created by his plan would cause more harm than good. Although Black Bolt acknowledged her wisdom, an attack by Vulcan meant that Black Bolt was kept too busy to accompany Crystal and Lockjaw when they were forced to flee before the bomb — now a simple explosive device — went off, apparently killing Black Bolt and Vulcan. After some time with Medusa ruling in Black Bolt&#x27;s stead, he is resurrected and returns to the throne. Shortly thereafter, Black Bolt makes a decree that the Inhumans would return to Earth, leaving Ronan the Accuser in charge of the empire; Crystal is given the choice to leave with the royal family or stay by her husband. She decides to stay with family.

In &quot;Civil War II&quot;, Crystal and Medusa introduce the Inhuman Ulysses to Captain Marvel, War Machine, and Black Panther. Crystal was present when Iron Man infiltrated New Attilan to claim Ulysses. Iron Man managed to defeat Crystal. She later joined Medusa, Karnak, and the other Inhumans with them in their trip to Stark Tower to reclaim Ulysses. During the confrontation with Iron Man, Crystal was present when Ulysses&#x27; latest vision projected to everyone present showing a rampaging Hulk standing over the corpses of the superheroes.

During the &quot;Inhumans vs. X-Men&quot; storyline, Crystal and Gorgon are ambushed by Magneto.

==Powers and abilities==

Crystal is often described in her appearances as an elemental due to her unique ability to psionically control the four classical elements: air, earth, fire, and water. The character&#x27;s proficiency in controlling these &quot;elements&quot; allows her to achieve a variety of effects and additional abilities. Her psionic powers are a result of exposure to the Terrigen Mists, which coupled with genetic engineering of the Inhumans by the Kree in the distant past, grant Inhumans abilities beyond the capabilities of an ordinary Inhuman that are unique to each individual.

===Inhuman physiology===
As a member of the fictional offshoot of humanity, Inhumans, Crystal possesses physical strength, durability, speed, endurance, and reflexes significantly greater than the maximum potential attainable by humans. Her physical prowess, coupled with combat training received from her cousin, Karnak, and the Avengers make her a formidable hand-to-hand combatant.

===Air manipulation===
Crystal can control oxygen atoms and oxygen-containing molecules to create atmospheric disturbances of various kinds. By intermingling air with earth she can cause a dust storm, air with water a typhoon, and air with fire a firestorm. She is able to create a wind of tornado intensity, approximately 115 miles per hour. She has demonstrated the ability to control air as far away as within a 30-mile radius. Using this ability, Crystal can summon wind currents strong enough to support her weight and others&#x27; and elevate herself to fly at high altitudes and speeds. By controlling air molecules, Crystal is able to bind them together psionically and compact them into a boundary to such a degree that matter cannot pass through. She uses this ability to various effects, including creating a field around her, allowing her to breathe while submerged in water and molten lava. She has also used this ability to deflect attacks and contain the atmosphere when the hull of a spaceship was compromised. She has demonstrated the ability to determine what may or may not pass through the barrier.

===Earth manipulation===
Crystal can control the various substances that make up common bedrock (earth: iron, granite, shale, limestone, etc.), creating seismic tremors of up to 6.7 on the Richter scale (greater if tectonic plate fault lines are nearby) by causing a sudden shifting of the earth. The upper limit of this power is unknown, although she has demonstrated the ability to lift the entire fictional city of Attilan for a significant amount of time. Her ability to control earth extends to many metals which are naturally occurring, including iron.

===Fire manipulation===
Crystal possesses the psionic ability to manipulate fire, cause it to grow in size and intensity, and take any form that she desires. She can also douse any oxidizing flame by altering the ionization potential of the outer electron shells of oxygen atoms. By accelerating oxygen molecules in the air, she is able to cause fire to spontaneously ignite.

===Water manipulation===
Further, Crystal can control the movement of water to a certain extent, via manipulation of inter-atomic van der Waals force controlling surface tension, divining water from the ground, and causing it to flow in designated directions. The maximum volume is unknown, although she has demonstrated the ability to create a maelstrom large and powerful enough to trap at least a dozen individuals, including Namor, and brought down what was described as &quot;a sea from the sky,&quot; at least several thousand gallons. The character&#x27;s control of water molecules extends to all of its forms, including ice. She is able to instantly freeze water to create ice blasts. She can also cause hydrogen and oxygen atoms in the air to recombine and form water molecules, summoning these atoms from a volume of atmosphere within a radius of approximately two miles. This allows her to spontaneously create water, even in a dry environment, provided oxygen and hydrogen are present.

===Other elemental effects===
Crystal possesses the ability to rearrange and manipulate the individual atoms of the elements that she controls to various effects. She is able to affect the elements she controls on an atomic level, giving them an electrical charge. Once the molecules are charged, she retains her control over them, allowing her to control the flow of the current, including the ability to summon lightning bolts. Her control over the elements at the atomic level also allows her to increase or decrease their molecular movement. This effectively allows her to instantly heat or cool the elements which she psionically controls. For example, she can instantly freeze water or ignite oxygen. By heating or cooling her surroundings, she is able to survive in environments of extreme heat or cold. She has demonstrated a limited capacity to manipulate the magnetic polarity of the metals she can psionically control. By combining her abilities to manipulate air, water, electricity, ice, and temperature, the character is able to effectively control the weather within a 30-mile radius. Also, because of her psionic connection to the elements around her, she has the ability to sense things an ordinary human or Inhuman would not, such as sensing how much moisture is contained within the air or other matter, being aware of movement in the air or water around herself, and being able to determine that a soil sample was not &quot;native&quot; to a particular area.

== Reception ==

=== Critical reception ===
Steve Morris of &quot;ComicsAlliance&quot; asserted, &quot;Crystal&#x27;s elemental powers offer infinite possibility, but her most important trait may be her pragmatism. She&#x27;s the most aware and self-conscious member of the Inhumans, with a better handle on how to interact with other species than the rest of her family. As a result, she offers a fascinating counterpoint to the bigger-name Inhumans, and drives a more empathetic perspective for readers. She&#x27;s smart, composed, and understanding; of course she was the one to drive the forging of relationships with the Fantastic Four and the Avengers.&quot; Sara Century of &quot;Syfy&quot; stated, &quot;We like Crystal a lot because she is a character who tries to choose her own happiness, only to get shunted off into politically convenient arranged marriages off-planet at the drop of a hat by the people closest to her. ...For Crystal, the real love story is learning to love herself enough to say &quot;no&quot; to the demands of others.&quot;

<doc id="387219" wikidata="Q102" url="?curid=387219" title="Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis">
<text>() is a 45-letter word coined in 1935 by the then-president of the National Puzzlers&#x27; League, Everett M. Smith. It has sometimes been used as a synonym for the occupational disease known as silicosis, but it should not be as most silicosis is not related to mining of volcanic dusts. It is the longest word in the English language published in a popular dictionary, Oxford Dictionaries, which defines it as &quot;an artificial long word said to mean a lung disease caused by inhaling very fine ash and sand dust&quot;.

Clinical and toxicological research conducted on volcanic crystalline silica has found little to no evidence of its ability to cause silicosis/-like diseases and geochemical analyses have shown that there are inherent factors in the crystalline structure which may render volcanic crystalline silica much less pathogenic than some other forms of crystalline silica.

Silicosis is a form of occupational lung disease caused by inhalation of crystalline silica dust, and is marked by inflammation and scarring in the form of nodular lesions in the upper lobes of the lungs. It is a type of pneumoconiosis.

==Etymology==
 is the longest word in the English language. 
The word can be analysed as follows:

# &quot;Pneumono&quot;: from ancient Greek (, ) which means lungs
# &quot;ultra&quot;: from Latin, meaning beyond
# &quot;micro&quot; and &quot;scopic&quot;: from ancient Greek, meaning small looking, referring to the fineness of particulates
# &quot;silico-&quot;: from Latin, silicon
# &quot;volcano&quot;: from Latin, referring to volcano
# &quot;coni&quot;: from ancient Greek (, ) which means dust
# &quot;-osis&quot;: from ancient Greek, suffix to indicate a medical condition

This word was invented at a meeting of the National Puzzlers&#x27; League (N.P.L.) by its president Everett M. Smith. The word featured in the headline for an article published by the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; on February 23, 1935, titled &quot;Puzzlers Open 103rd Session Here by Recognizing 45-Letter Word&quot;:

Although it has been defined as an extension of &quot;pneumoconiosis&quot;, there is no scientific evidence for a similar disease related to volcanic silica particle exposures.

Subsequently, the word was used in Frank Scully&#x27;s puzzle book &quot;Bedside Manna&quot;, after which time, members of the N.P.L. campaigned to include the word in major dictionaries.

This 45-letter word, referred to as &quot;p45&quot;, first appeared in the 1939 supplement to the &quot;Merriam-Webster New International Dictionary, Second Edition&quot;.

Any references on the internet to or silicosis being caused by &#x27;sharp particles [which] lacerate lining of lungs; causing victim to leak air from their lungs while simultaneously bleeding into their lung cavity&#x27; are inaccurate. Particles of a size able to enter the lung (&lt; 10 μm diameter) gently settle on the lung lining rather than cutting or abrading the surface.

<text>In geometry, an incidence relation is a heterogeneous relation that captures the idea being expressed when phrases such as &quot;a point &quot;lies on&quot; a line&quot; or &quot;a line is &quot;contained in&quot; a plane&quot; are used. The most basic incidence relation is that between a point, , and a line, , sometimes denoted . If &quot;P&quot; and &quot;l&quot; are incident, , the pair is called a &quot;flag&quot;.

There are many expressions used in common language to describe incidence (for example, a line &quot;passes through&quot; a point, a point &quot;lies in&quot; a plane, etc.) but the term &quot;incidence&quot; is preferred because it does not have the additional connotations that these other terms have, and it can be used in a symmetric manner. Statements such as &quot;line intersects line &quot; are also statements about incidence relations, but in this case, it is because this is a shorthand way of saying that &quot;there exists a point that is incident with both line and line &quot;. When one type of object can be thought of as a set of the other type of object (&quot;viz&quot;., a plane is a set of points) then an incidence relation may be viewed as containment.

Statements such as &quot;any two lines in a plane meet&quot; are called &quot;incidence propositions&quot;. This particular statement is true in a projective plane, though not true in the Euclidean plane where lines may be parallel. Historically, projective geometry was developed in order to make the propositions of incidence true without exceptions, such as those caused by the existence of parallels. From the point of view of synthetic geometry, projective geometry &quot;should be&quot; developed using such propositions as axioms. This is most significant for projective planes due to the universal validity of Desargues&#x27; theorem in higher dimensions.

In contrast, the analytic approach is to define projective space based on linear algebra and utilizing homogeneous co-ordinates. The propositions of incidence are derived from the following basic result on vector spaces: given subspaces and of a (finite-dimensional) vector space , the dimension of their intersection is . Bearing in mind that the geometric dimension of the projective space associated to is and that the geometric dimension of any subspace is positive, the basic proposition of incidence in this setting can take the form: linear subspaces and of projective space meet provided .

The following sections are limited to projective planes defined over fields, often denoted by , where is a field, or . However these computations can be naturally extended to higher-dimensional projective spaces, and the field may be replaced by a division ring (or skewfield) provided that one pays attention to the fact that multiplication is not commutative in that case.


Let be the three-dimensional vector space defined over the field . The projective plane consists of the one-dimensional vector subspaces of , called &quot;points&quot;, and the two-dimensional vector subspaces of , called &quot;lines&quot;. Incidence of a point and a line is given by containment of the one-dimensional subspace in the two-dimensional subspace.

Fix a basis for so that we may describe its vectors as coordinate triples (with respect to that basis). A one-dimensional vector subspace consists of a non-zero vector and all of its scalar multiples. The non-zero scalar multiples, written as coordinate triples, are the homogeneous coordinates of the given point, called &quot;point coordinates&quot;. With respect to this basis, the solution space of a single linear equation } is a two-dimensional subspace of , and hence a line of . This line may be denoted by &quot;line coordinates&quot; , which are also homogeneous coordinates since non-zero scalar multiples would give the same line. Other notations are also widely used. Point coordinates may be written as column vectors, T, with colons, , or with a subscript, . Correspondingly, line coordinates may be written as row vectors, , with colons, or with a subscript, . Other variations are also possible.

==Incidence expressed algebraically==

Given a point and a line , written in terms of point and line coordinates, the point is incident with the line (often written as ), if and only if,

This can be expressed in other notations as:
:formula_1

:formula_2

No matter what notation is employed, when the homogeneous coordinates of the point and line are just considered as ordered triples, their incidence is expressed as having their dot product equal 0.

==The line incident with a pair of distinct points==
Let and be a pair of distinct points with homogeneous coordinates and respectively. These points determine a unique line with an equation of the form and must satisfy the equations:
: and
In matrix form this system of simultaneous linear equations can be expressed as:
:formula_3
This system has a nontrivial solution if and only if the determinant,
:formula_4 
Expansion of this determinantal equation produces a homogeneous linear equation, which must be the equation of line . Therefore, up to a common non-zero constant factor we have where:
: , and

In terms of the scalar triple product notation for vectors, the equation of this line may be written as:
where is a generic point.

===Collinearity===
Points that are incident with the same line are said to be &quot;collinear&quot;. The set of all points incident with the same line is called a range.

If , and , then these points are collinear if and only if
:formula_5
i.e., if and only if the determinant of the homogeneous coordinates of the points is equal to zero.

==Intersection of a pair of lines==

Let and be a pair of distinct lines. Then the intersection of lines and is point a that is the simultaneous solution (up to a scalar factor) of the system of linear equations:
: and
The solution of this system gives:
: , and

Alternatively, consider another line passing through the point , that is, the homogeneous coordinates of satisfy the equation:
Combining this equation with the two that define , we can seek a non-trivial solution of the matrix equation:
:formula_6
Such a solution exists provided the determinant,
:formula_7 
The coefficients of and in this equation give the homogeneous coordinates of .

The equation of the generic line passing through the point in scalar triple product notation is:

===Concurrence===
Lines that meet at the same point are said to be &quot;concurrent&quot;. The set of all lines in a plane incident with the same point is called a &quot;pencil of lines&quot; centered at that point. The computation of the intersection of two lines shows that the entire pencil of lines centered at a point is determined by any two of the lines that intersect at that point. It immediately follows that the algebraic condition for three lines, to be concurrent is that the determinant,
:formula_8

<text>The Rolls-Royce RB211 is a British family of high-bypass turbofan engines made by Rolls-Royce. The engines are capable of generating of thrust. The RB211 engine was the first production three-spool engine and turned Rolls-Royce from a significant player in the aero-engine industry into a global leader.

Originally developed for the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar, it entered service in 1972 and was the exclusive engine to power the L-1011. Mismanagement of the initial development and consequent cost issues led to the effective nationalisation of Rolls-Royce Limited, to save the workforce and the engine businesses important to the UK and many other aerospace and aircraft operating companies.

In the early 1970s, the engine was reckoned by the company to be capable of at least 50 years of continuous development. The RB.211 was renamed, in 1989, to become the basis of the Rolls-Royce Trent family of engines when the RB211-524L was renamed to the Trent.

== History ==

=== Background ===

In 1966, American Airlines announced a requirement for a new short-medium range airliner with a focus on low-cost per-seat operations. While it was looking for a twin-engined plane, aircraft manufacturers needed more than one customer to justify developing a new airliner. Eastern Airlines had expressed interest, but required greater range and needed to operate long routes over water. At the time, this demanded three engines to provide redundancy. Other airlines also favored three engines. Lockheed and Douglas responded with designs, the L-1011 TriStar and DC-10 respectively. Both had three engines, transcontinental range and seated around 300 passengers in a widebody layout with two aisles.

The wide-body McDonnell-Douglas DC-10 was representative of the innovative aircraft and aero-engine technologies which were then being adopted by US and European airframe manufacturers to provide airlines with aircraft of very large carrying capacity and short/medium to long range. These very large capacity aircraft were needed to address the significant increases in passenger numbers and air traffic which were then being forecast by the industry. In Europe, large capacity airliner concept studies had been carried out by both private and government organisations since the late 1950s and early 1960s. Many of the studies conducted by the aviation companies were weighted towards a 200 to 300 seat aircraft, with a high cycle performance that was based on the utilisation of the game-changing new technology of the high by-pass ratio aero-engine.

Between 1964 and 1967, Hawker Siddeley&#x27;s examination of British European Airways (BEA)&#x27;s requirements produced the 160-seat HS.132 and the 185-seat HS.134; both offered the prospect of a 25–30% reduction in seat mile costs over aircraft then in service. Both of the designs would have used two new-technology Rolls-Royce RB.178 aero-engines of 30,000lbf to provide superior operating performance over the first generation three-engine jets.

According to Cownie, Gunston, Hayward and the UK Department of Trade &amp; Industry (DTI), the roots of the advanced RB.178 go back to 1961 when Rolls-Royce officially initiated work on a high by-pass ratio aero-engine as a replacement for the Conway. The company went ahead with the project and under the leadership of Adrian Lombard built the twin-spool demonstrator. Overall development costs of the RB.178 was £2.6 million. As a comparison, the GE and P&amp;W companies were awarded nearly $20 million by the US Department of Defense to develop and build the TF39 and STF200 technology demonstrators.

The RB.178 was built on the reliable and economic advantages inherent in the Conway and, given that engine&#x27;s heritage, the new engine&#x27;s performance looked certain. The RB.178 (designated the 16 series) appears to have been the engine proposed for the Vickers Superb DB.265 (VC10), with four engines powering the high capacity transatlantic airliner.

There are perhaps many reasons why the RB.178 failed. Chief among them was Boeing declining to offer the Rolls-Royce engine on the 747.

The RB.178 was cancelled in May 1966 and in June 1966 Rolls-Royce indicated it did not want to battle with P&amp;W over the Boeing 747. In September 1966 Rolls-Royce revealed its decision to launch an Advanced Technology Engine (A.T.E) family covering thrusts ranging from 10,000lbf (RB.203) through to 60,000lbf. (RB.207). The A.T.E family introduced new technologies such as the triple-shaft architecture, an annular combustor and a structurally integrated power-plant (nacelle).

Both planes also required new engines. Engines were undergoing a period of rapid advance due to the introduction of the high bypass concept, which provided for greater thrust, improved fuel economy and less noise than the earlier low-bypass designs. Rolls-Royce had been working on an engine of the required 45,000 lbf (200 kN) thrust class for an abortive attempt to introduce an updated Hawker Siddeley Trident as the RB178. This work was later developed for the 47,500 lbf (211 kN) thrust RB207 to be used on the Airbus A300, before, with the withdrawal of the UK from the Airbus programme, it was cancelled in favour of the RB211 programme.

Rolls-Royce was also working on a series of triple-spool designs as replacements for the Conway, which promised to deliver higher efficiency. In this configuration, three groups of turbines spin three separate concentric shafts to power three sections of the compressor area running at different speeds. In addition to allowing each stage of the compressor to run at its optimal speed, the triple-spool design is more compact and rigid, although more complex to build and maintain. Several designs were being worked on at the time, including a 10,000 lbf (44 kN) thrust design known as the RB203 intended to replace the Spey. Work started on the Conway replacement engine in July 1961 and a twin-spool demonstrator engine to prove the HP compressor, combustor, and turbine system designs, had been run by 1966. Rolls-Royce chose the triple-spool system in 1965 as the simplest, lowest cost solution to the problem of obtaining lower fuel consumption and reduced noise levels at a constant power setting. Work on the RB211 as essentially a scaled-down RB207 began in 1966-7 with the first certificated engines being scheduled to be available by December 1970 at 33,260lb take-off thrust and at a price of $511,000 each.

In February 1968, American Airlines had chosen the Rolls-Royce RB211 to power its order for up to 50 McDonnell-Douglas DC-10s. On 7 March 1968, the Washington correspondent of &quot;The Times&quot; wrote of an attempt being made by Congress to block Rolls-Royce&#x27;s bid to supply engines for the projected United States airbus. Representative Robert Taft Jr. of Ohio had marshalled opposition because of a report that Rolls-Royce had won approval for the engine. On 9 March 1968, &quot;The Times&quot; reported that President Lyndon Johnson had received written protests from six senators and five representatives, from Ohio and New Mexico – states that would benefit if a US manufacturer was selected. Their complaint was that &#x27;not adequately balanced information was given during talks between representatives of airlines and the British Government concerning the American Government&#x27;s position on buying foreign engines&#x27;. The US Congress was concerned that the import of foreign engines would result in a US payments deficit of $3,800 million and the loss of 18,000 to 20,000 jobs.

=== Finalisation of design ===

On 23 June 1967, Rolls-Royce offered Lockheed the RB211-06 for the L-1011. The new engine was to be rated at thrust and combined features of several engines then under development: the large high-power, high-bypass design from the RB207 and the triple-spool design of the RB203. To this was added one new piece of technology, a fan stage built of a new carbon fibre material called &quot;Hyfil&quot; developed at the RAE Farnborough. The weight saving was considerable over a similar fan made of titanium, and gave the RB211 an advantage over its competitors in terms of power-to-weight ratio. Despite knowing that the timetable was challenging for an engine incorporating these new features, Rolls-Royce committed to putting the RB211 into service in 1971.

Lockheed felt that the new engine enabled the L-1011 to offer a distinct advantage over the otherwise similar DC-10 product. However, Douglas had also requested proposals from Rolls-Royce for an engine to power its DC-10, and in October 1967 the response was a thrust version of the RB211 designated RB211-10. There followed a period of intense negotiation between airframe manufacturers Lockheed and Douglas, engine suppliers Rolls-Royce, General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney, and the major US airlines. During this time prices were negotiated downwards and the required thrust ratings were increased. By early 1968, Rolls-Royce was offering a thrust engine designated RB211-18. On 29 March 1968 Lockheed announced that it had received orders for 94 TriStars, and placed an order with Rolls-Royce for 150 sets of engines designated RB211-22.

=== RB211-22 series ===
==== Development and testing ====

The RB211&#x27;s complexity required a lengthy development and testing period. By Autumn 1969 Rolls-Royce was struggling to meet the performance guarantees to which it had committed: the engine had insufficient thrust, was over weight and its fuel consumption was excessive. The situation deteriorated further when in May 1970 the new &quot;Hyfil&quot; (a carbon fibre composite) fan stage, after passing other tests, shattered when a chicken carcass was fired into it at high speed as part of the bird ingestion test. The company had been developing a titanium blade as an insurance against difficulties with &quot;Hyfil&quot;, but this meant extra cost and more weight. It also brought its own technical problems when it was discovered that only one side of the titanium billet was of the right metallurgical quality for blade fabrication.

In addition, the project suffered a setback with the death of Chief Engineer Adrian &quot;Lom&quot; Lombard in July 1967, a loss that was described as Rolls-Royce having been &quot;deprived of one of the finest trouble-shooting engineers in the industry&quot;.

&quot;It was all too obvious that the Derby engineers, normally proud and self-confident to the point of arrogance, had slid from bad to worse when their great leader, Lombard, had been so suddenly plucked from them in 1967. His death had left a vacuum which nobody could fill ... &quot; – Stanley Hooker

In September 1970, Rolls-Royce reported to the government that development costs for the RB211 had risen to £170.3 million – nearly double the original estimate. The estimated production costs now exceeded the £230,375 selling price of each engine. The project was in crisis.

==== Insolvency and aftermath ====
By January 1971 Rolls-Royce had become insolvent, and on 4 February 1971 was placed into receivership, seriously jeopardising the L-1011 TriStar programme. Because of its strategic importance, the company was nationalised by the Conservative government of Edward Heath, allowing development of the RB211 to be completed.

As Lockheed was itself in a vulnerable position, the British government required that the US government guarantee the bank loans that Lockheed needed to complete the L-1011 project. If Lockheed (which was itself weakened by the difficulties) had failed, the market for the RB211 would have evaporated. Despite some opposition, the US government provided these guarantees. In May 1971, a new company called &quot;Rolls-Royce (1971) Ltd.&quot; acquired the assets of Rolls-Royce from the Receiver, and shortly afterwards signed a new contract with Lockheed. This revised agreement cancelled penalties for late delivery, and increased the price of each engine by £110,000.

Hugh Conway (managing director RR Gas Turbines), persuaded Stanley Hooker to come out of retirement and return to Rolls-Royce. As technical director he led a team of other retirees - including Cyril Lovesey and Arthur Rubbra - to fix the remaining problems on the RB211-22. The engine was finally certified on 14 April 1972, about a year later than originally planned, and the first TriStar entered service with Eastern Air Lines on 26 April 1972. Hooker was knighted for his role in 1974.

Speaking of a famous banker in relation to the RB211:

&quot;We (Rolls-Royce) added a zero to his stature; he used to think £5 million a lot of money, but after a few weeks on the RB211 he came to understand that £50 million is peanuts.&quot; – Stanley Hooker.

The RB211&#x27;s initial reliability in service was not as good as had been expected because of the focus of the development programme on meeting the engine&#x27;s performance guarantees. Early deliveries were of the RB211-22C model, derated slightly from the later -22B. A programme of modifications during the first few years in service improved matters considerably, and the series has since matured into a highly reliable engine.

=== RB211-524 series ===

Although originally designed for the L-1011-1, Rolls-Royce knew that the RB211 could be developed to provide greater thrust. By redesigning the fan and the IP compressor, Hooker&#x27;s team increased the engine&#x27;s thrust to . The new version, which first ran on 1 October 1973, was designated RB211-524, and would be able to power new variants of the L-1011, as well as the Boeing 747.

Rolls-Royce tried unsuccessfully to sell the RB211 to Boeing in the 1960s, but the new -524 offered significant performance and efficiency improvements over the Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D which Boeing had originally selected to power the 747. In October 1973 Boeing agreed to offer the RB211-524 on the 747-200, and British Airways became the first airline to order this combination which entered service in 1977. &quot;Flight International&quot; stated in 1980:

&quot;The importance placed on fuel saving by airlines is emphasised by Qantas&#x27; adoption of RB.211-524 power for its new Boeing 747s – the only aircraft on which all big three fans are available. Qantas found that British Airways&#x27; Boeing 747s fitted with RB211s burnt roughly 7% less fuel than its JT9D-equipped fleet, a saving of about $1 million a year per aircraft, at today&#x27;s prices.&quot;

Rolls-Royce continued to develop the -524, increasing its thrust through with the -524C, then in the -524D which was certificated in 1981. Notable airline customers included Qantas, Cathay Pacific, Air New Zealand, Cargolux and South African Airways. When Boeing launched the heavier 747-400 more thrust was required, and Rolls responded with the -524G rated at thrust and then the -524H with 60,600, both introducing a full cowl nacelle with deep-chute forced mixer as already present on the -535E4. These were the first versions to feature FADEC. This was later adopted by GE and Pratt &amp; Whitney for their engines. The -524H was also offered as a third engine choice on the Boeing 767, and the first of these entered service with British Airways in February 1990.

These would have been the final developments of the -524, but when Rolls developed the successor Trent engine, it was found it could fit the Trent 700&#x27;s improved HP system to the -524G and -524H. These variants were lighter and offered improved fuel efficiency and reduced emissions; they were designated -524G-T and -524H-T respectively. It was also possible to upgrade existing -524G/H engines to the improved -T configuration, and a number of airlines did this.

The -524 became increasingly reliable as it was developed, and the -524H achieved 180-minute ETOPS approval on the 767 in 1993. An RB211 may have a thrust specific fuel consumption around 0.6 lb/(lbf·h).

The -524L, begun in 1987 to allow further growth in the A330 and 777 market, was more extensively redesigned, the considerable differences incorporated leading to the engine eventually receiving the name Trent, under which name development has continued.

=== RB211-535 series ===

==== RB211-535C ====
In the mid 1970s, Boeing was considering designs for a new twin-engined aircraft to replace its successful 727. As the size of the proposed plane grew from 150 passengers towards 200, Rolls-Royce realised that the RB211 could be adapted by reducing the diameter of the fan and removing the first IP compressor stage to produce an engine with the necessary thrust. The new version was designated RB211-535. On 31 August 1978 Eastern Airlines and British Airways announced orders for the new 757, powered by the -535. Designated RB211-535C, the engine entered service in January 1983. This was the first time that Rolls-Royce had provided a launch engine on a Boeing aircraft. Eastern Airlines president Frank Borman called the -535C &quot;The finest airline engine in the world&quot;.

==== RB211-535E, RB211-535E4 ====

In 1979 Pratt &amp; Whitney launched its PW2000 engine, claiming 8% better fuel efficiency than the -535C for the PW2037 version. Boeing put Rolls-Royce under pressure to supply a more competitive engine for the 757, and using the more advanced -524 core as a basis, the company produced the thrust RB211-535E4 which entered service in October 1984. While not as efficient as the PW2037, it was more reliable and quieter. Visible differences include a long cowl with no jet nozzle protruding beyond the bypass duct. Partial mixing of hot and cold airflows takes place in the integrated or common nozzle. It was also the first to use a wide chord fan blade which increases efficiency, reduces noise and gives added protection against foreign object damage.

Probably the most important single -535E order came in May 1988 when American Airlines ordered 50 757s powered by the -535E4 citing the engine&#x27;s low noise as an important factor: this was the first time since the TriStar that Rolls-Royce had received a significant order from a US airline, and it led to the -535E4&#x27;s subsequent market domination on the 757. Unusually, at the time of the announcement made by American, selection of the -535E4 was made public prior to the selection of the 757, though this was welcome news to both Rolls-Royce and Boeing.

After being certified for the 757, the E4 was offered on the Russian Tupolev Tu-204-120 airliner, entering service in 1992. This was the first time a Russian airliner had been supplied with western engines. The -535E4 was also proposed by Boeing for re-engining the B-52H Stratofortress, replacing the aircraft&#x27;s eight TF33s with four of the turbofans. Further upgrading of the -535E4 took place in the late 1990s to reduce emissions, borrowing technology developed for the Trent 700.

The -535E4 is considered by many to be an extremely reliable engine, and achieved 180-minute ETOPS approval on the 757 in 1990.

=== Industrial RB211 ===

When Rolls-Royce was developing the -22, it realised that it would be straightforward to develop a version of the engine for land-based power generation, and in 1974 the industrial RB211 was launched. When the -524 arrived shortly afterwards, its improvements were incorporated in the industrial RB211 which was designated RB211-24. The generator was gradually developed over the following years and is still marketed today as a range of generators producing 25.2–32 MW. Many of its installations have been in the offshore oil and gas production industries.

=== Marine WR-21 ===

An advanced 25 MW class WR-21 Intercooled Recuperated (ICR) gas turbine was derived for marine propulsion.

<text>In music and music theory, the beat is the basic unit of time, the pulse (regularly repeating event), of the &quot;mensural level&quot; (or &quot;beat level&quot;). The beat is often defined as the rhythm listeners would tap their toes to when listening to a piece of music, or the numbers a musician counts while performing, though in practice this may be technically incorrect (often the first multiple level). In popular use, &quot;beat&quot; can refer to a variety of related concepts, including pulse, tempo, meter, specific rhythms, and groove.

Rhythm in music is characterized by a repeating sequence of stressed and unstressed beats (often called &quot;strong&quot; and &quot;weak&quot;) and divided into bars organized by time signature and tempo indications.

Beats are related to and distinguished from pulse, rhythm (grouping), and meter:

Metric levels faster than the beat level are division levels, and slower levels are multiple levels. Beat has always been an important part of music. Some music genres such as funk will in general de-emphasize the beat, while other such as disco emphasize the beat to accompany dance.

==Division==
As beats are combined to form measures, each beat is divided into parts. The nature of this combination and division is what determines meter. Music where two beats are combined is in duple meter, music where three beats are combined is in triple meter. Music where the beat is split in two are in simple meter, music where the beat is split in three are called compound meter. Thus, simple duple (, , etc.), simple triple (), compound duple (), and compound triple (). Divisions which require numbers, tuplets (for example, dividing a quarter note into five equal parts), are irregular divisions and subdivisions. Subdivision begins two levels below the beat level: starting with a quarter note or a dotted quarter note, subdivision begins when the note is divided into sixteenth notes.

==Downbeat and upbeat==
The &quot;downbeat&quot; is the first beat of the bar, i.e. number 1. The &quot;upbeat&quot; is the last beat in the previous bar which immediately precedes, and hence anticipates, the downbeat. Both terms correspond to the direction taken by the hand of a conductor.

An anticipatory note or succession of notes occurring before the first barline of a piece is sometimes referred to as an upbeat figure, section or phrase. Alternative expressions include &quot;pickup&quot; and &quot;anacrusis&quot; (the latter ultimately from Greek &quot;ana&quot; [&quot;up towards&quot;] and &quot;krousis&quot; [&quot;strike&quot;/&quot;impact&quot;] through French &quot;anacrouse&quot;). In English, &quot;anákrousis&quot; translates literally as &quot;pushing up&quot;. The term anacrusis was borrowed from the field of poetry, in which it refers to one or more unstressed extrametrical syllables at the beginning of a line.

==On-beat and off-beat==

In typical Western music time, counted as &quot;&quot;, the first beat of the bar (downbeat) is usually the strongest accent in the melody and the likeliest place for a chord change, the third is the next strongest: these are &quot;on&quot; beats. The second and fourth are weaker—the &quot;off-beats&quot;. Subdivisions (like eighth notes) that fall between the pulse beats are even weaker and these, if used frequently in a rhythm, can also make it &quot;off-beat&quot;.

The effect can be easily simulated by evenly and repeatedly counting to four. As a background against which to compare these various rhythms a bass drum strike on the downbeat and a constant eighth note subdivision on ride cymbal have been added, which would be counted as follows (bold denotes a stressed beat):
* — the stress here on the &quot;on&quot; beat But one may syncopate that pattern and alternately stress the odd and even beats, respectively:
* — the stress is on the &quot;unexpected&quot; or syncopated beat 

So &quot;off-beat&quot; is a musical term, commonly applied to syncopation, that emphasizes the weak even beats of a bar, as opposed to the usual on-beat. This is a fundamental technique of African polyrhythm that transferred to popular western music. According to Grove Music, the &quot;Offbeat is [often] where the downbeat is replaced by a rest or is tied over from the preceding bar&quot;. The downbeat can never be the off-beat because it is the strongest beat in time. Certain genres tend to emphasize the off-beat, where this is a defining characteristic of rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll and ska music.

==Backbeat==


A back beat, or backbeat, is a syncopated accentuation on the &quot;off&quot; beat. In a simple rhythm these are beats 2 and 4.

&quot;A big part of R&amp;B&#x27;s attraction had to do with the stompin&#x27; backbeats that make it so eminently danceable,&quot; according to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Percussion&quot;. An early record with an emphasised back beat throughout was &quot;Good Rockin&#x27; Tonight&quot; by Wynonie Harris in 1948. Although drummer Earl Palmer claimed the honor for &quot;The Fat Man&quot; by Fats Domino in 1949, which he played on, saying he adopted it from the final &quot;shout&quot; or &quot;out&quot; chorus common in Dixieland jazz. There is a hand-clapping back beat on &quot;Roll &#x27;Em Pete&quot; by Pete Johnson and Big Joe Turner, recorded in 1938. A distinctive back beat can be heard on &quot;Back Beat Boogie&quot; by Harry James And His Orchestra, recorded in late 1939. Other early recorded examples include the final verse of &quot;Grand Slam&quot; by Benny Goodman in 1942 and some sections of The Glenn Miller Orchestra&#x27;s &quot;(I&#x27;ve Got A Gal In) Kalamazoo&quot;, while amateur direct-to-disc recordings of Charlie Christian jamming at Minton&#x27;s Playhouse around the same time have a sustained snare-drum backbeat on the hottest choruses.

Outside U.S. popular music, there are early recordings of music with a distinctive backbeat, such as the 1949 recording of Mangaratiba by Luiz Gonzaga in Brazil.

Slap bass executions on the backbeat are found in styles of country western music of the 1930s, and the late 1940s early 1950s music of Hank Williams reflected a return to strong backbeat accentuation as part of the honky tonk style of country.
In the mid-1940s &quot;hillbilly&quot; musicians the Delmore Brothers were turning out boogie tunes with a hard driving back beat, such as the No. 2 hit &quot;Freight Train Boogie&quot; in 1946, as well as in other boogie songs they recorded. Similarly Fred Maddox&#x27;s characteristic backbeat, a slapping bass style, helped drive a rhythm that came to be known as rockabilly, one of the early forms of rock and roll. Maddox had used this style as early as 1937.

In today&#x27;s popular music the snare drum is typically used to play the backbeat pattern. Early funk music often delayed one of the backbeats so as &quot;to give a &#x27;kick&#x27; to the [overall] beat&quot;.

Some songs, such as The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Please Please Me&quot; and &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot;, The Knack&#x27;s &quot;Good Girls Don&#x27;t&quot; and Blondie&#x27;s cover of The Nerves&#x27; &quot;Hanging on the Telephone&quot;, employ a double backbeat pattern. In a double backbeat, one of the off beats is played as two eighth notes rather than one quarter note.

==Cross-beat==
Cross-rhythm. A rhythm in which the regular pattern of accents of the prevailing meter is contradicted by a conflicting pattern and not merely a momentary displacement that leaves the prevailing meter fundamentally unchallenged
: —&quot;New Harvard Dictionary of Music&quot; (1986: 216).&lt;ref name=&quot;Neal 2000 https://archive.org/details/countrymusicannu00char/page/115 115&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hyperbeat==
A hyperbeat is one unit of hypermeter, generally a measure. &quot;Hypermeter is meter, with all its inherent characteristics, at the level where measures act as beats.&quot;

==Beat perception==
Beat perception refers to the human ability to extract a periodic time structure from a piece of music.
This ability is evident in the way people instinctively move their body in time to a musical beat, made possible by a form of sensorimotor synchronization called &#x27;beat-based timing&#x27;. This involves identifying the beat of a piece of music and timing the frequency of movements to match it.
Infants across cultures display a rhythmic motor response but it is not until between the ages of 2 years 6 months and 4 years 6 months that they are able to match their movements to the beat of an auditory stimulus.

==Related concepts==
* &quot;Tatum&quot; refers to a subdivision of a beat which represents the &quot;time division that most highly coincides with note onsets&quot;.
*&quot;Afterbeat&quot; refers to a percussion style where a strong accent is sounded on the second, third and fourth beats of the bar, following the downbeat.
* In reggae music, the term one drop reflects the complete de-emphasis (to the point of silence) of the first beat in the cycle.
* James Brown&#x27;s signature funk groove emphasized the downbeat – that is, with heavy emphasis &quot;on the one&quot; (the first beat of every measure) – to etch his distinctive sound, rather than the back beat (familiar to many R&amp;B musicians) which places the emphasis on the second beat.

<text>In musical notation, a bar (or measure) is a segment of music bounded by vertical lines, known as bar lines (or barlines), usually indicating one or more recurring beats. The length of the bar, measured by the number of note values it contains, is normally indicated by the time signature.

==Types of bar lines==
Regular bar lines consist of a thin vertical line extending from the top line to the bottom line of the staff, sometimes also extending between staves in the case of a grand staff or a family of instruments in an orchestral score. 

A &quot;double bar line&quot; (or &quot;double bar&quot;) consists of two single bar lines drawn close together, separating two sections within a piece, or a bar line followed by a thicker bar line, indicating the end of a piece or movement. Note that &quot;double bar&quot; refers not to a type of &quot;bar&quot; (i.e., measure), but to a type of &quot;bar line&quot;. Typically, a double bar is used when followed by a new key signature, whether or not it marks the beginning of a new section.

A &quot;repeat sign&quot; (or, &quot;repeat bar line&quot;) looks like the music end, but it has two dots, one above the other, indicating that the section of music that is before is to be repeated. The beginning of the repeated passage can be marked by a &quot;begin-repeat sign&quot;; if this is absent, the repeat is understood to be from the beginning of the piece or movement. This begin-repeat sign, if appearing at the beginning of a staff, does not act as a bar line because no bar is before it; its only function is to indicate the beginning of the passage to be repeated.

A mensurstrich is a bar line which stretches only between staves of a score, not through each staff; this is a specialized notation used by editors of early music to help orient modern musicians when reading music which was originally written without bar lines.

Lines extending only partway through the staff are rarely used, sometimes to help orient the reader in very long measures in complex time signatures, or as brief section divisions in Gregorian chant notation.Some composers use dashed or dotted bar lines; others (including Hugo Distler) have placed bar lines at different places in the different parts to indicate different stress patterns from part to part.

If many consecutive bars contain only rests, they may be replaced by a single bar containing a multirest, as shown. The number above shows the number of bars replaced.

== Bars and stresses ==
Whether the music contains a regular meter or mixed meters, the first note in the bar (known as the downbeat) is usually stressed slightly in relation to the other notes in the bar. 

Igor Stravinsky said of bar lines:

Bars and bar lines also indicate grouping: rhythmically of beats within and between bars, within and between phrases, and on higher levels such as meter.

==Numbering bars==
The first metrically complete bar within a piece of music is called &quot;bar 1&quot; or &quot;m. 1&quot;. When the piece begins with an anacrusis (an incomplete bar at the beginning of a piece of music), &quot;bar 1&quot; or &quot;m. 1&quot; is the following bar. Bars contained within first or second endings are numbered consecutively.

==History==
The earliest bar lines, used in keyboard and vihuela music in the 15th and 16th centuries, didn&#x27;t reflect a regular meter at all but were only section divisions, or in some cases marked off every beat.

Bar lines began to be introduced into ensemble music in the late 16th century but continued to be used irregularly. Not until the mid-17th century were bar lines used in the modern style with every measure being the same length, and they began to be associated with time signatures.

Modern editions of early music that was originally notated without bar lines sometimes use a mensurstrich as a compromise.

==Hypermeasure==


A hypermeasure, large-scale or high-level measure, or measure-group is a metric unit in which, generally, each regular measure is one beat (actually hyperbeat) of a larger meter. Thus a beat is to a measure as a measure/hyperbeat is to a hypermeasure. Hypermeasures must be larger than a notated bar, perceived as a unit, consist of a pattern of strong and weak beats, and along with adjacent hypermeasures, which must be of the same length, create a sense of hypermeter. The term was coined by Edward T. Cone in &quot;Musical Form and Musical Performance&quot; (New York: Norton, 1968), and is similar to the less formal notion of a phrase.

<doc id="387243" wikidata="Q241284" url="?curid=387243" title="Geosphere">
<text>There are several conflicting usages of geosphere, variously defined. 

In Aristotelian physics, the term was applied to four spherical &quot;natural places&quot;, concentrically nested around the center of the Earth, as described in the lectures &quot;Physica&quot; and &quot;Meteorologica&quot;. They were believed to explain the motions of the four &quot;terrestrial elements:&quot; &quot;Earth&quot;, &quot;Water&quot;, &quot;Air&quot;, and &quot;Fire&quot;.

In modern texts and in Earth system science, geosphere refers to the solid parts of the Earth; it is used along with atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere to describe the systems of the Earth (the interaction of these systems with the magnetosphere is sometimes listed). In that context, sometimes the term lithosphere is used instead of geosphere or solid Earth. The lithosphere, however, only refers to the uppermost layers of the solid Earth (oceanic and continental crustal rocks and uppermost mantle).

&quot;Geosphere&quot; may also be taken as the collective name for the lithosphere, the hydrosphere, the cryosphere, and the atmosphere. The different collectives of the geosphere are able to exchange different mass and/or energy fluxes (the measurable amount of change). The exchange of these fluxes affects the balance of the different spheres of the geosphere. An example is how the soil acts as a part of the biosphere, while also acting as a source of flux exchange.

Since space exploration began, it has been observed that the extent of the ionosphere or plasmasphere is highly variable, and often much larger than previously appreciated, at times extending to the boundaries of the Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere. This highly variable outer boundary of &quot;geogenic&quot; matter has been referred to as the &quot;geopause&quot; (or magnetopause), to suggest the relative scarcity of such matter beyond it, where the solar wind dominates.

<doc id="387245" wikidata="Q1314688" url="?curid=387245" title="Rusty blackbird">
<text>The rusty blackbird (Euphagus carolinus) is a medium-sized New World blackbird, closely related to grackles (&quot;rusty grackle&quot; is an older name for the species). It is a bird that prefers wet forested areas, breeding in the boreal forest and muskeg across northern Canada, and migrating southeast to the United States during winter.

Formerly abundant, the rusty blackbird has undergone one of the most rapid declines of any abundant bird species in North America in recent years, for reasons that are not well understood.

==Description==
Adults have a pointed bill and a pale yellow eye. They have black plumage with faint green and purple gloss; the female is greyer. &quot;Rusty&quot; refers to the brownish winter plumage. They resemble the western member of the same genus, the Brewer&#x27;s blackbird; however, Brewer&#x27;s has a longer bill and the male&#x27;s head is iridescent green.

==Habitat==
Their breeding habitat is wet temperate coniferous forests and muskeg across Canada, New England, the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, the Adirondack Mountains in New York and Alaska. Birds usually nest at the edge of ponds and wetlands with the cup nest located in a tree or dense shrub, often over the water. Emerging dragonflies and their larvae are important food items during the summer.

These birds migrate to the eastern and southeastern United States, into parts of the Grain Belt, sometimes straying into Mexico. Additional vagrants have been reported inn Greenland and Russian Siberia.

==Behavior==

They forage on wet ground or in shallow water, mainly eating insects, small fish and some seeds. Their most common mode of foraging is to vigorously flip leaves and rip at submerged aquatic vegetation. The mast of small-acorn producing oaks, such as willow oak, is also important. In some areas, the nuts of planted pecans are heavily used. They very rarely will attack small passerine birds, and have been known to kill species as large as the Wilson&#x27;s snipe. They feed in flocks during migration and on the wintering grounds, sometimes joining other blackbirds, both often occurring in single species flocks. They more often roost with other blackbirds; some small roosts are in brushy vegetation in old fields and others are in massive mixed flocks—sometimes in the urban areas.

The species nests relatively early for a boreal forest bird. They linger in the boreal zone to complete their . Their autumn migration is slow, with birds often remaining in the northern states well into December; spring migration is much more rapid. The largest wintering concentrations are found in the lower Mississippi Valley, with smaller concentrations in the Piedmont and south Atlantic coastal plain.

Fairly quiet in fall migration and most of the winter, both males and females will sing (particularly on warm days) in the late winter and spring. The song consists of gurgling and high-pitched squeaks.

==Population==
Rusty blackbirds have declined significantly in recent decades. The reasons are unclear, but habitat loss is likely a major contributor to the decline. The habitat loss is likely due to multiple factors, including development for oil, gas, and mining industries, hydroelectric projects, and the clearing of forests for forestry. Mercury contamination may be a problem for populations in northeastern North America. Rarer than previously believed, it was uplisted from a species of Least Concern to Vulnerable status on the 2007 IUCN Red List. Deliberate poisoning of mixed-species blackbird flocks, targeting brown-headed cowbird, common grackle and red-winged blackbird, in the southeastern U.S. may also be playing a role; there is currently no estimate of the number of rusty blackbirds killed by these poisonings. In the eastern part of its range, acid rain may be decreasing the availability of calcium-rich invertebrates that the rusty blackbird depends on for food.

Additionally, citizen science projects such as the North American Breeding Bird Survey and Christmas Bird Count have determined that rusty blackbirds have dropped 85%–98% in the past 40 years. This is very worrisome for many people, as scientists are desperately trying to figure out what exactly went wrong. Sighting submission services such as eBird are encouraging birders to keep track of rusty blackbirds. The International Rusty Blackbird Working Group has been actively coordinating and conducting research on this species since 2005.

<text>Eyak is an extinct Na-Dené language, historically spoken by the Eyak people, indigenous to south-central Alaska, near the mouth of the Copper River. The name Eyak comes from a Chugach Sugpiaq name () for an Eyak village at the mouth of the Eyak River. 

The closest relatives of Eyak are the Athabaskan languages. The Eyak–Athabaskan group forms a basic division of the Na-Dené language family, the other being Tlingit.

Numerous Tlingit place names along the Gulf Coast are derived from names in Eyak; they have obscure or even nonsensical meanings in Tlingit, but oral tradition has maintained many Eyak etymologies. The existence of Eyak-derived Tlingit names along most of the coast towards southeast Alaska is strong evidence that the prehistoric range of Eyak was once far greater than it was at the time of European contact. This confirms both Tlingit and Eyak oral histories of migration throughout the region.

==Current status and revival==
The last surviving native speaker was Marie Smith Jones (May 14, 1918 – January 21, 2008) of Cordova.

The spread of English and suppression of aboriginal languages are not the only reasons for the decline of the Eyak language. The northward migration of the Tlingit people around Yakutat in precontact times encouraged the use of Tlingit rather than Eyak along much of the Pacific Coast of Alaska. Eyak was also under pressure from its neighbors to the west, the Alutiiq people of Prince William Sound, as well as some pressure from the people of the Copper River valley. Eyak and Tlingit culture began to merge along the Gulf Coast, and a number of Eyak-speaking groups were absorbed by the Gulf Coast Tlingit populations. This resulted in the replacement of Eyak by Tlingit among most of the mixed groups after a few generations, as reported in Tlingit oral histories of the area.

===Revival===
In June 2010, the &quot;Anchorage Daily News&quot; published an article about Guillaume Leduey, a French college student with an unexpected connection to the Eyak language. Beginning at age 12, he had taught himself Eyak, utilizing print and audio instructional materials he obtained from the Alaska Native Language Center. During that time, he never traveled to Alaska or conversed with Marie Smith Jones, the last native speaker.

The month that the article was published, he traveled to Alaska and met with Dr. Michael Krauss, a noted linguist and Professor Emeritus at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Dr. Krauss assisted Leduey with proper Eyak phonological pronunciation and assigned further instruction in grammar and morphology—including morphemic analyses of traditional Eyak stories.

In June 2011, Leduey returned to Alaska to facilitate Eyak language workshops in Anchorage and Cordova. He is now regarded as a fluent speaker, translator, and instructor of Eyak. Despite his fluency, Eyak remains classified as &quot;dormant&quot; as there are no native speakers. On the Expanded Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scale (EGIDS) Eyak is graded a 9 (dormant); the language serves as a reminder of heritage identity for an ethnic community, but no one has more than symbolic proficiency. Currently, Leduey provides instruction and curriculum assistance to the Eyak Language Project from France.

The Eyak Preservation Council received an Alaska Humanities Forum Grant that enabled them to start a website devoted to the preservation of the Eyak Language. Other funding supports the annual Eyak Culture Camp every August in Cordova. The Project provides countless language resources including immersion workshops, an online dictionary with audio samples, and a set of eLearning lessons, among others.

In June 2014, the Eyak Language Revitalization Project announced an online program called &quot;dAXunhyuuga&#x27;&quot;, which means &quot;the words of the people.&quot;

==Language family==

Eyak is a part of the Eyak-Athabaskan language family and Na-Dené larger grouping, which includes Eyak-Athabaskan and Tlingit with a controversial but possible inclusion of Haida. The Athabaskan family covers three distinct geographic areas, forming three subgroups: Northern Athabaskan in Alaska and the Yukon; Pacific Coast Athabaskan in California and Oregon; and Southern Athabaskan, also called Apache, spoken mainly in the American Southwest, which includes Navajo. There has been extensive comparative reconstruction of a Proto-Athabaskan-Eyak (PAE). A recent proposal of a Dené–Yeniseian stock has been widely well received by linguists, linking the Dené languages to the Yeniseian languages of central Siberia. If it proves correct, it will be the first validated genetic link between Old and New World languages. Far less accepted is a possible Dené–Caucasian stock that has been pursued for decades.

==Phonology==
The following charts are based on the material in Krauss (1965); IPA equivalents are shown in square brackets. The orthography used by Krauss is also used by the Eyak people. An alternative version uses instead of for , and instead of for respectively. 

===Consonants===

Aspirated stops contrast with unaspirated stops only before vowels.

All consonants may be found stem-initially, except /h/, which is interpreted as zero. /h/ has the allophone [h] only word-initially or directly following a vowel.

===Vowels===
Eyak has five vowel qualities /ɪ e a ə ʊ/, three of which also distinguish duration, nasalization, creaky voice (i.e. glottalization), and breathy voice (‘aspiration’ in Krauss&#x27;s terminology). The vowel only occurs as short and in modal voice, without nasalization. can also vary between or , and can vary between , , or . Breathy voice vowels are all short , although most of them can also be nasalized .

==== Writing vowels in Eyak ====
In the system developed to represent Eyak in writing, long vowels are represented by characters following the basic vowel: a colon &lt;:&gt; for long vowels, an apostrophe &lt; ’&gt; for glottalized (or creaky voice) vowels, an &lt;h&gt; for breathy voiced (“aspirated”) vowels and an &lt;n&gt; for nasalized vowels. 
===Suprasegmentals===
All syllables begin with an onset, so that no two vowels may occur consecutively. Only vowels can be the nuclei of syllables. Stems are heavy syllables, whereas affixes tend to be light. 

Unlike many of the Athabascan languages to which it is related, Eyak is not tonal. It does not use variations in fundamental frequency (i.e. ‘pitch accents’) to convey contrast. Lexical stress usually falls on stems and/or heavy syllables. In sequences of heavy syllables, the stress falls on the penultimate syllable, as in &quot;qʼahdiʼlah&quot; /qʼa̤ˈtɪ̰la̤/ “goodbye”.

==Morphology==
Eyak is an agglutinative, polysynthetic language.

===Nouns===
With few exceptions, Eyak nouns are morphophonemically invariable. Kinship and anatomical stems are the only noun stems that may take pronominal possessive prefixes, which are as follow:
* First person singular: &quot;si- (siya:q’e’&quot;, &quot;my aunt [mother&#x27;s sister]&quot;)
* Second person singular: &quot;’i-&quot; (&quot;’ita:’&quot;, &quot;your (sg.) father&quot;)
* Third person singular and plural: &quot;’u-&quot;
* First person plural: &quot;qa:-&quot;
* Second person plural: &quot;lAX-&quot;
* Indefinite: &quot;k’u-&quot;
* Reciprocal: &quot;’Ad-&quot;

===Preverbals===

Preverbals in Eyak are the category of words made up of preverbals and postpositions. The two are grouped together because one morpheme may often be used as the stem in both categories. Preverbals are individual words that occur in conjunction with the verb. These combinations may almost be said to form lexemes, especially due to the fact that preverbals are rarely if ever used in isolation in natural speech. Preverbals are nearly always unbound and are phonologically separate from the verb, contrasting with the corresponding class in Athabaskan which may be incorporated or not. One preverbal is most common, but combinations of two are equally possible, as in &quot;’uya’ ’Adq’Ach’ k’udAdAGu’&quot; &quot;hot water bottle&quot; (in it onto self something/someone is kept warm). There are more than 100 Eyak basic preverbal morphemes.

Postpositions relate directly to an object outside of the verb. Current analysis by Krauss has been phonological rather than semantic, but there is at least one semantically grouped category of postpositions to consider, that of comparatives. This grouping includes P-ga’ &quot;like P&quot;, P-’u’X &quot;less than P&quot;, and P-lAX &quot;more than P&quot; where P is any postpositional phrase. Eyak lacks conjunctions and many postpositions assume a similar function, creating subordinate clauses. These postpositions attach to the verb, the most common example being -da:X &quot;and&quot; or &quot;if, when&quot;.

===Verbs===
Eyak verb stems take many affixes: there are nine prefix positions before the verb (many of which may be subdivided) and four suffix positions after. All positions may be filled with zero, except the stem, which can be filled by any of several hundred morphemes but not zero.

====Affix position====
# Object
## Direct object: xu (1 sg.), ’i (2 sg.), ø~A (3 sg. and pl.), lAXi: (2 pl.), ’Ad(A)~’Ad(u) (reflexive), ’i~’i(dA) (indeterminate)
## Indefinite subject or object: k’u’
##* The indeterminate is used where there is no specific object (such as in intransitive verbs), while the indefinite is used where there is a specific but unspecified subject or object. 
## Mark of semitransitive: ’~:
# Tense/aspect/mood A (inceptive imperfect): qu’~qa’~qe’~qi’ 
# ’i:lih ~ :lih
#* This position is filled only in a few verbs of thought or emotion, such as ilih
# Plurality emphasizer: qA (subject &quot;and&quot; object)
# Classificatory (nominal) and thematic (verbal) qualifiers: the most variable and characteristically Eyak affix position. gu, XA, lAXA, dA, yA, and lA may occur singly, the rest occur in combinations of two or three. 
## GA, gu
## XA
## qi:, lAXA, ti:, ku:n, k’ush, tsin, tsi:
## dA, yA
## lA~:n
#* Only in position C. do the morphemes have specified meaning, and only nominally, for example: lAXA, &quot;berry-like, ball-like, eye&quot; or qi: + dA &quot;foot&quot;. The other morphemes have unlimited, much broader meanings, but tend to concentrate in certain areas. They may be nominal classificatory or verbal thematic. 
#** gu+lA is nominally classificatory and refers to liquid or viscous matter; when gu appears by itself it refers nominally to basket-roots, thread, or hair, (but not rope), as well as thematically with -L-qu, &quot;chase&quot;. 
#** XA+dA may nominally refer to matches or logs (but not sticks) or to clouds, among others. dA alone thematically refers to an unusually broad selection including but not limited to hunger, sleds, arrows, noises (only certain types), and non-solid round objects (including eggs, severed heads, and hearts). 
#** This is a very limited sampling of the breadth of the meanings of the possible morphemes in position 5. 
# Tense/aspect/mood B1: GA, ø ~ A, : ~ A
# Subject: xw (1 sg.), ø ~ y(i) (2 sg.), lAX (2 pl.), ø (all else)
# Tense/aspect/mood B2: &quot;sA ~ s&quot; (perfective), (y)i ~ ø (inconclusive function)
# Verb voice classifier: ø, dA~di, L, LA~Li
# Verb stem

# Derivational: g (habitual action), X ~ ø (progressive)
# Aspectival: L (perfective); Derivational: k’ (customary)
# Negative: G
# Human subject or object of third person: inh (sg.), inu: (pl.); non-human object of imperative: uh

An artificial but grammatical example presents near-maximum affixal positions filled: dik’ lAXi:qAqi’dAxsLXa’Xch’gLG &quot;I did not tickle your (plural, emphatically) feet.&quot; This gives:
* dik’, negative particle
* Prefix position 1: lAXi:, direct object, you pl. 
* Position 4: qA, emphasizing plurality
* Positions 5C &amp; D: qi’ + dA, pertaining to feet
* Position 6: ø, negative active perfective 
* Position 7: x, 1st pers. sg. subject
* Position 8: s, perfective
* Position 9: L
* Stem: Xa’Xch’, tickle
* Suffix position 1: g, repetitive
* Position 2: L, perfective
* Position 3: G, negative

====Tense, mood, and aspect====

There are two moods, optative and imperative, and two aspects, perfective and imperfective. Verbs may be inceptive, &#x27;active,&#x27; or &#x27;neuter&#x27;, such that the possibilities are as follows:

Morphemes in prefix position 2 modify the inceptive imperfective; in position 6 the perfective, optative, and imperative in inceptive, active and neuter; in position 8 the inceptive optative, active perfective and optative, and neuter perfective, imperfective, optative, and imperative; in suffix position 2 the inceptive, active, and neuter perfective; and in suffix position 3, negativity.

There are also three derivational modes, a repetitive, a customary, and a progressive. The infinitive takes approximately the same form as the imperative, with some variation.

==Syntax==
The majority of the Eyak corpus is narrative, with very little spontaneous conversation (and that only when embedded in the narratives). There is a better understanding therefore of the syntax of Eyak narrative style and performance than of natural speech. The basic word order of Eyak is subject-object-verb, or SOV, as in &quot;Johnny ’uyAqa’ts’ sALxut’L&quot; &quot;Johnny shot his (own) hand.&quot; Relatively few sentences, however, follow this exact pattern; it is far more common to find SV or OV. The full word order of a transitive sentence is I S O [[C P] V]:
*I, introductory sector: consists of two parts, a connective (e.g. &#x27;and so,&#x27; &#x27;then,&#x27; etc.) and one or more adverbs, especially temporal and spatial adverbs. 
*S, subject
*O, object
*V, verb sector: includes two subsectors in addition to the verb. 
**C, complement subsector: in Eyak syntax a complement is a noun or noun phrase (e.g. not a demonstrative pronoun) and does not have the same meaning as the usual use of &#x27;complement&#x27; in ordinary syntax. This is due to traditional classifications of Eyak. 
**P, preverbal subsector: includes preverbals (preverbs and postpositions) and pronouns.

The subject and object categories can consist of a [[noun]], a [[noun phrase]], or a [[demonstrative]] phrase. All constituents may be filled by zero, excepting the verb.

<text>Brewer&#x27;s blackbird (Euphagus cyanocephalus) is a medium-sized New World blackbird. It is named after the ornithologist Thomas Mayo Brewer.

== Description ==
Adult males have black plumage with an iridescent purple head and neck and glossy bluish-green highlights on the rest of the body. The feet and legs are black and the eye is bright yellow. The female is brownish-grey with slight hints of the male&#x27;s iridescence. The female&#x27;s eye is dark brown, while the male&#x27;s is bright yellow. Overall, they resemble the eastern member of the same genus, the rusty blackbird; Brewer&#x27;s blackbird, however, has a shorter bill and the male&#x27;s head is iridescent purple. This bird is often mistaken for the common grackle but has a shorter tail. The call is a sharp check which is also distinguishable. This bird is in a different family from the Eurasian blackbird.

==Habitat==
Their breeding habitat is open and semi-open areas, often near water, across central and western North America. They are also very common in parking lots or around schools, and easily acclimate to the presence of people. They can live in low elevation, as low as below sea level in Southern California, and elevation as high as 8,000 feet. They are capable of surviving in diverse environments, including marshlands and forests. 

These birds are often permanent residents in the west. Other birds migrate to the Southeastern United States and Mexico in Spring. The range of this bird has been expanding east in the Great Lakes region. They have expanded their habitat as recently as the 20th century.

== Behavior ==
When Brewer&#x27;s blackbirds identify threats, such as hawks or even humans, they dive towards them and emit an alarm call. Sometimes, when particularly threatened, they will use physical force on predators. 

Brewer&#x27;s blackbirds often walk along the ground. They can be seen making jerking motions with their heads. In colder months, these birds tend to flock together and forage. Sometimes, other species of blackbirds will join these flocks. During nesting season, their foraging behavior becomes more independent. Brewer&#x27;s blackbirds have been seen cleverly following vehicles plowing fields, eating the churned up insects.

==Feeding==
They forage in shallow water or in fields, mainly eating seeds and insects, some berries. They sometimes catch insects in flight. They feed in flocks outside of the breeding season, sometimes with other blackbirds. In marshy areas, they are known to stand on aquatic plants and wade in shallow water to catch insects. Some have even been known to eat smaller mammals, amphibians, and the nestlings of other birds.

== Reproduction ==

These birds have mates but the mates don&#x27;t stay together all year round. The same pair tends to reunite for mating season and both parents take a role in feeding. During mating, male Brewer&#x27;s blackbirds will puff up their feathers while simultaneously spreading out their wings and tail to look as large as possible. They will point their beak out forward. Their clutch size can vary, usually between 3–7. Eggs are usually a tan color with darker speckles throughout to allow for camouflage. The female bird primarily incubates for 12–14 days. The chicks leave the nest only 2 weeks after hatching.

Nests are not built in isolation, but in colonies of up to 30 pairs. Pairs prefer to nest in areas that are around 20–40&#x27; in treetops. However, colonies that live near water may also nest in reeds and other freshwater plants. Nests are made from nearby material such as reeds, sticks and hair. They are built by the female in a cup-like shape and are bonded with mud or other securing substances. The color of the nest usually matches the coloration of the eggs and the surrounding environment as it is crucial to survival. Brewer&#x27;s blackbird chicks do not immediately open their eyes upon hatching and do not hatch with feathers. 

==Protected status==
Brewer&#x27;s blackbird (&quot;Euphagus cyanocephalus&quot;) is protected in the United States under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, however exceptions are granted under 50 CFR part 21 (2014) for animals &quot;committing or about to commit depredations upon ornamental or shade trees, agricultural crops, livestock, or wildlife, or when concentrated in such numbers and manner that they are a health hazard or other nuisance.&quot; They are moderately threatened by climate change. However, this could change if temperatures continue to rise. If temperatures rise by 3 degrees celsius, they could lose 30% of their range. Heat and wildfires are particularly threatening. Their numbers have dropped 57% from 1966 to 2019. It is estimated that there are currently 23 million Brewer&#x27;s blackbirds in the wild.

<text>Pehr Kalm (6 March 1716 – 16 November 1779), also known as Peter Kalm, was a Swedish explorer, botanist, naturalist, and agricultural economist. He was one of the most important apostles of Carl Linnaeus.

In 1747, he was commissioned by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences to travel to the North American colonies in order to bring back seeds and plants that might be useful to agriculture. Among his many scientific accomplishments, Kalm can be credited with the first description of Niagara Falls written by a trained scientist. In addition, he published the first scientific paper on the North American 17-year periodical cicada, &quot;Magicicada septendecim.&quot;

Kalm wrote an account of his travels that was translated into numerous European languages; a 20th-century translation remains in print in English as &quot;Peter Kalm&#x27;s Travels in North America: The English Version of 1770,&quot; translated by Swedish-American scholar Adolph B. Benson.

==Biography==
Kalm was born to Gabriel Kalm and Katarina Ross in Ångermanland, Sweden, where his parents had taken refuge from Finland during the Great Northern War. His father was a Finnish clergyman and his mother was of Scottish ancestry. His father died six weeks after his birth. When the hostilities were over, his widowed mother returned with him to Närpes in Ostrobothnia, where Kalm&#x27;s father had been a Lutheran minister.

Kalm studied at the Royal Academy of Turku from 1735. In 1740, he entered the University of Uppsala, where he became one of the first students of the renowned naturalist Carl Linnaeus. In Uppsala, Kalm became the superintendent of an experimental plantation owned by his patron, Baron Sten Karl Bielke.

Kalm did field research in Sweden, Russia, and Ukraine from 1742 to 1746, when he was appointed docent of natural history and economics at the Royal Academy of Turku. In 1747, the academy elevated him to professor of economics. That same year, he was also appointed by Linnaeus and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (of which he had been a member since 1745) to travel to North America to find seeds and plants that might prove useful for agriculture or industry. In particular, they wanted him to bring back the red mulberry in the hope of starting a silk industry in Finland (which was then an integral part of Sweden).

On his journey from Sweden to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Kalm spent six months in England, where he met many of the important botanists of the day. Kalm arrived in Pennsylvania in 1748; there he was befriended by Benjamin Franklin and naturalist John Bartram. Kalm based his explorations at the Swedish-Finnish community of Raccoon, which is now Swedesboro, New Jersey in South Jersey. This town had been founded as part of the former Swedish colony of New Sweden. There, he also served as the substitute pastor of Trinity Church, the local Swedish Lutheran church. Kalm subsequently married Anna Margaretha Sjöman, the widow of Johan Sandin, the former pastor. He remained in Raccoon until 19 May 1749.

Kalm made trips as far west as Niagara Falls and as far north as Montreal and Quebec before returning to Finland in 1751. He took a post as professor at the Royal Academy of Turku. In addition to teaching and directing students, he established botanical gardens in Turku. He taught at the academy until his death in Turku in 1771.

Anders Chydenius, another noted scientist, was a student of Pehr Kalm&#x27;s.

==Legacy==

*Kalm&#x27;s journal of his travels was published as &quot;En Resa til Norra America&quot; (Stockholm, 1753–1761). It was translated into German, Dutch, and French. Kalm described not only the flora and fauna of the New World, but also the lives of the Native Americans and the British and French colonists whom he met. A United States edition was later translated and edited by Swedish-American scholar and literary historian Adolph B. Benson (1881–1961). It was published as &quot;Peter Kalm&#x27;s Travels in North America: The English Version of 1770&quot; (Wilson-Erickson Inc., 1937). This version has become an important standard reference regarding life in colonial North America and has been in continuous print in several updated editions.
*Kalm&#x27;s paper on the lifecycle of the North American 17-year periodical cicada, &quot;Magicicada septendecim&quot;, was the first published scientific description of the species and its recurrent appearances.
*In his &quot;Species Plantarum,&quot; Linnaeus cites Kalm for 90 species, 60 of them new, including the genus &quot;Kalmia&quot;, which Linnaeus named after Kalm. &quot;Kalmia latifolia&quot; (Mountain-laurel) is the state flower of Pennsylvania and Connecticut.
*The Mint of Finland issued a coin in Kalm&#x27;s honor. He is regarded as one of the most notable Finnish explorers. In Finland he is also known as Pietari Kalm.

<text>Coal gas is a flammable gaseous fuel made from coal and supplied to the user via a piped distribution system. It is produced when coal is heated strongly in the absence of air. Town gas is a more general term referring to manufactured gaseous fuels produced for sale to consumers and municipalities.

The original coal gas was produced by the coal gasification reaction, and the burnable component consisted of a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen in roughly equal quantities by volume. Thus, coal gas is highly toxic. Other compositions contain additional calorific gases such as methane, produced by the Fischer–Tropsch process, and volatile hydrocarbons together with small quantities of non-calorific gases such as carbon dioxide and nitrogen. 

Prior to the development of natural gas supply and transmission—during the 1940s and 1950s in the United States and during the late 1960s and 1970s in the United Kingdom and Australia—almost all gas for fuel and lighting was manufactured from coal. Town gas was supplied to households via municipally owned piped distribution systems. Sometimes, this was called [[Syngas|syn gas]], in contrast to natural gas. At the time, a frequent method of committing suicide was the inhalation of gas from an unlit oven. With the head and upper body placed inside the appliance, the concentrated carbon monoxide would kill quickly. Sylvia Plath famously ended her life with this method.

Originally created as a by-product of the coking process, its use developed during the 19th and early 20th centuries tracking the Industrial Revolution and urbanization. By-products from the production process included coal tars and ammonia, which were important raw materials (or &quot;chemical feedstock&quot;) for the dye and chemical industry with a wide range of artificial dyes being made from coal gas and coal tar. Facilities where the gas was produced were often known as a manufactured gas plant (MGP) or a gasworks.

In the United Kingdom the discovery of large reserves of natural gas, or sea gas as it was known colloquially, in the Southern North Sea off the coasts of Norfolk and Yorkshire in 1965 led to the expensive conversion or replacement of most of Britain&#x27;s gas cookers and gas heaters, from the late 1960s onwards, the process being completed by the late 1970s. Any residual gas lighting found in homes being converted was either capped off at the meter or, more usually, removed altogether. As of 2023, some gas street lighting still remains, mainly in central London and the Royal Parks.

The production process differs from other methods used to generate gaseous fuels known variously as manufactured gas, syngas, Dowson gas, and producer gas. These gases are made by partial combustion of a wide variety of feedstocks in some mixture of air, oxygen, or steam, to reduce the latter to hydrogen and carbon monoxide although some destructive distillation may also occur.

Manufactured gas can be made by two processes: carbonization or gasification. Carbonization refers to the devolatilization of an organic feedstock to yield gas and char. Gasification is the process of subjecting a feedstock to chemical reactions that produce gas.

The first process used was the carbonization and partial pyrolysis of coal. The off gases liberated in the high-temperature carbonization (coking) of coal in coke ovens were collected, scrubbed and used as fuel. Depending on the goal of the plant, the desired product was either a high quality coke for metallurgical use, with the gas being a side product, or the production of a high quality gas, with coke being the side product. Coke plants are typically associated with metallurgical facilities such as smelters or blast furnaces, while gas works typically served urban areas.

A facility used to manufacture coal gas, carburetted water gas (CWG), and oil gas is today generally referred to as a manufactured gas plant (MGP).

In the early years of MGP operations, the goal of a utility gas works was to produce the greatest amount of illuminating gas. The illuminating power of a gas was related to amount of soot-forming hydrocarbons (&quot;illuminants&quot;) dissolved in it. These hydrocarbons gave the gas flame its characteristic bright yellow color. Gas works would typically use oily bituminous coals as feedstock. These coals would give off large amounts of volatile hydrocarbons into the coal gas, but would leave behind a crumbly, low-quality coke not suitable for metallurgical processes.

Coal or coke oven gas typically had a calorific value between ; with values around being typical.

The advent of electric lighting forced utilities to search for other markets for manufactured gas. MGPs that once almost exclusively produced lighting gas shifted their efforts towards supplying gas for heating and cooking, and even refrigeration and cooling.

== Gas for industrial use ==
Fuel gas for industrial use was made using producer gas technology. Producer gas is made by blowing air through an incandescent fuel bed (commonly coke or coal) in a gas producer. The reaction of fuel with insufficient air for total combustion produces carbon monoxide (CO); this reaction is exothermic and self-sustaining. It was discovered that adding steam to the input air of a gas producer would increase the calorific value of the fuel gas by enriching it with CO and hydrogen (H2) produced by water gas reactions. Producer gas has a very low calorific value of ; because the calorific gases CO/H2 are diluted with much inert nitrogen (from air) and carbon dioxide (CO2) (from combustion)

:2C (s) + O2 → 2 CO (exothermic producer gas reaction)
:C (s) + H2O (g) → CO + H2 (endothermic water gas reaction)
:C + 2 H2O → CO2 + 2 H2 (endothermic)
:CO + H2O → CO2 + H2 (exothermic water gas shift reaction)

The problem of nitrogen dilution was overcome by the blue water gas (BWG) process, developed in the 1850s by Sir William Siemens. The incandescent fuel bed would be alternately blasted with air followed by steam. The air reactions during the blow cycle are exothermic, heating up the bed, while the steam reactions during the make cycle, are endothermic and cool down the bed. The products from the air cycle contain non-calorific nitrogen and are exhausted out the stack while the products of the steam cycle are kept as blue water gas. This gas is composed almost entirely of CO and H2, and burns with a pale blue flame similar to natural gas. BWG has a calorific value of .

Blue water gas lacked illuminants; it would not burn with a luminous flame in a simple fishtail gas jet as existed prior to the invention of the gas mantle in the 1890s. Various attempts were made to enrich BWG with illuminants from gas oil in the 1860s. Gas oil (an early form of gasoline) was the flammable waste product from kerosene refining, made from the lightest and most volatile fractions (tops) of crude oil.
In 1875 Thaddeus S. C. Lowe invented the carburetted water gas process. This process revolutionized the manufactured gas industry and was the standard technology until the end of manufactured gas era. A CWG generating set consisted of three elements; a producer (generator), carburettor and a super heater connected in series with gas pipes and valves.

During a make run, steam would be passed through the generator to make blue water gas. From the generator the hot water gas would pass into the top of the carburettor where light petroleum oils would be injected into the gas stream. The light oils would be thermocracked as they came in contact with the white hot checkerwork fire bricks inside the carburettor. The hot enriched gas would then flow into the superheater, where the gas would be further cracked by more hot fire bricks.

==Gas in post-war Britain==
=== New manufacturing processes ===
Following the Second World War the slow recovery of the British coal mining industry led to shortages of coal and high prices. 

The decline of coal as a feedstock for town gas production using carbonisation is demonstrated in this graph.

}&lt;/graph&gt;New technologies for manufacturing coal gas using oil, refinery tail gases, and light distillates were developed. Processes included the Lurgi Process, catalytic reforming, the catalytic rich gas process, steam reforming of rich gas, and the gas recycle hydrogenator process. The catalytic rich gas process used natural gas as a feedstock to manufacture town gas. These facilities utilised the chemical reaction processes described above.

The rise of oil as a feedstock to manufacture town gas is shown on the graph below. The peak usage in 1968/9 and subsequent decline coincides with the availability of North Sea gas which, over the next few years, displaced town gas as a primary fuel and led to the decline of oil as a feedstock for gas making, as shown.

=== Domestic heating ===
By the 1960s, manufactured gas, compared with its main rival in the energy market, electricity, was considered &quot;nasty, smelly, dirty and dangerous&quot; (to quote market research of the time) and seemed doomed to lose market share still further, except for cooking where its controllability gave it marked advantages over both electricity and solid fuel. The development of more efficient gas fires assisted gas to resist competition in the market for room heating. Concurrently a new market for whole house central heating by hot water was being developed by the oil industry and the gas industry followed suit. Gas warm air heating found a market niche in new local authority housing where low installation costs gave it an advantage. These developments, the realignment of managerial thinking away from commercial management (selling what the industry produced) to marketing management (meeting the needs and desires of customers) and the lifting of an early moratorium preventing nationalised industries from using television advertising, saved the gas industry for long enough to provide a viable market for what was to come.

=== Natural gas as feedstock ===
In 1959 the Gas Council in Great Britain demonstrated that liquid natural gas (LNG) could be transported safely, efficiently and economically over long distances by sea. The &quot;Methane Pioneer&quot; shipped a consignment of LNG from Lake Charles, Louisiana, US, to a new LNG terminal on Canvey Island, in the Thames estuary in Essex, England. A long high-pressure trunk pipeline was built from Canvey Island to Bradford. The pipeline and its branches provided Area Gas Boards with natural gas for use in reforming processes to make town gas. A large-scale LNG reception plant was commissioned on Canvey in 1964, which received LNG from Algeria in two dedicated tankers, each of 12,000 tonnes.

===Conversion to natural gas===
The slow decline of the town gas industry in the UK was driven by the discovery of natural gas by the drilling rig &quot;Sea Gem&quot;, on 17 September 1965, some forty miles off Grimsby, over below the seabed. Subsequently, the North Sea was found to have many substantial gas fields on both sides of the median line defining which nations should have rights over the reserves.

In a pilot scheme customers on Canvey Island were converted from town gas to natural gas supplied from the LNG plant on Canvey.

The Fuel Policy White Paper of 1967 (Cmd. 3438) pointed the industry in the direction of building up the use of natural gas speedily to &#x27;enable the country to benefit as soon as possible from the advantages of this new indigenous energy source&#x27;. As a result, there was a &#x27;rush to gas&#x27; for use in peak load electricity generation and in low grade uses in industry.

The growth in availability of natural gas is shown in the graph below. Until 1968 this was from supplies of LNG from Algeria, until North Sea gas was available from 1968.

The exploitation of the North Sea gas reserves, entailing landing gas at Easington, Bacton and St Fergus made viable the building of a national distribution grid, of over , consisting of two parallel and interconnected pipelines running the length of the country. This became the National Transmission System. All gas equipment in Great Britain (but not Northern Ireland) was converted (by the fitting of different-sized burner jets to give the correct gas/air mixture) from town gas to natural gas (mainly methane) over the period from 1967 to 1977 at a cost of about £100 million, including writing off redundant town gas manufacturing plants. All the gas-using equipment of almost thirteen million domestic, four hundred thousand commercial, and sixty thousand industrial customers were converted. Many dangerous appliances were discovered in this exercise and were taken out of service. 

The UK town gas industry ended in 1987 when operations ceased at the last town gas manufacturing plants in Northern Ireland (Belfast, Portadown and Carrickfergus; Carrickfergus gas works is now a restored gasworks museum). The Portadown site has been cleared and is now the subject of a long-term experiment into the use of bacteria for the purpose of cleaning up contaminated industrial land.

As well as requiring little processing before use, natural gas is non-toxic; the carbon monoxide (CO) in town gas made it extremely poisonous, accidental poisoning and suicide by gas being commonplace. Poisoning from natural gas appliances is only due to incomplete combustion, which creates CO, and flue leaks to living accommodation. As with town gas, a small amount of foul-smelling substance (mercaptan) is added to the gas to indicate to the user that there is a leak or an unlit burner, the gas having no odour of its own.

The organisation of the British gas industry adapted to these changes, first, by the Gas Act 1965 by empowering the Gas Council to acquire and supply gas to the twelve area gas boards. Then, the Gas Act 1972 formed the British Gas Corporation as a single commercial entity, embracing all the twelve area gas boards, allowing them to acquire, distribute and market gas and gas appliances to industrial commercial and domestic customers throughout the UK. In 1986, British Gas was privatised and the government no longer has any direct control over it.

During the era of North Sea gas, many of the original cast iron gas pipes installed in towns and cities for town gas were replaced by plastic.

As reported in the DTI Energy Review &#x27;Our Energy Challenge&#x27; January 2006 North Sea gas resources have been depleted at a faster rate than had been anticipated and gas supplies for the UK are being sought from remote sources, a strategy made possible by developments in the technologies of pipelaying that enable the transmission of gas over land and under sea across and between continents. Natural gas is now a world commodity. Such sources of supply are exposed to all the risks of any import.

====In popular culture====
Monty Python parodied the conversion from coal to North Sea gas, and the jumping through hoops some encountered, in their &quot;New Cooker Sketch,&quot; as part of the episode that began its second series in 1970.

Coal gas was used to power several historic balloon ascents in the 19th century (see &quot;The Aeronauts&quot;).

==Gas production in Germany==

In many ways, Germany took the lead in coal gas research and carbon chemistry.
With the labours of August Wilhelm von Hofmann, the whole German chemical industry emerged.
Using the coal gas waste as feedstock, researchers developed new processes and synthesized
natural organic compounds such as Vitamin C and aspirin.

The German economy relied on coal gas during the Second World War as petroleum shortages forced
Nazi Germany to develop the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis to produce synthetic fuel for aircraft and tanks.

==Issues in gas processing==
* Tar aerosols (tar extractors, condensers/scrubbers, Electrostatic precipitators in 1912)
* Light oil vapors (oil washing)
* Naphthalene (oil/tar washing)
* Ammonia gas (scrubbers)
* Hydrogen sulfide gas (purifier boxes)
* Hydrogen cyanide gas (purifier)

==WWI-interwar era developments==
* Loss of high-quality gas oil (used as motor fuel) and feed coke (diverted for steelmaking) leads to massive tar problems. CWG (carburetted water gas) tar is less valuable than coal gasification tar as a feed stock. Tar-water emulsions are uneconomical to process due to unsellable water and lower quality by products.
:: CWG tar is full of lighter polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, good for making pitch, but poor in chemical precursors.
* Various &quot;back-run&quot; procedures for CWG generation lower fuel consumption and help deal with issues from the use of bituminous coal in CWG sets.
* Development of high-pressure pipeline welding encourages the creation of large municipal gas plants and the consolidation of the MG industry. Sets the stage for rise of natural gas.
* Electric lighting replaces gaslight. MG industry peak is sometime in the mid-1920s.
* 1936 or so. Development of Lurgi gasifier. Germans continue work on gasification/synfuels due to oil shortages.

* The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, in the US, forces break up of integrated coke and gas companies in the United States.
* Fischer–Tropsch process for synthesis of liquid fuels from / gas.
* Haber-Bosch ammonia process creates a large demand for industrial hydrogen.

==Post WWII: the decline of manufactured gas==
* Development of natural gas industry. Natural gas has an energy content of 37 MJ/m3, compared to the 10-20 MJ/m3 of town gas.
* Petrochemicals kill much of the value of coal tar as a source of chemical feed stocks. (BTX, Phenols, Pitch)
* Decline in creosote use for wood preserving.
* Direct coal/natural gas injection reduces demand for metallurgical coke. 25 to 40% less coke is needed in blast furnaces.
* BOF and EAF processes obsolete cupola furnaces. Reduce need for coke in recycling steel scrap. Less need for fresh steel/iron.
* Cast iron &amp; steel are replaced with aluminum and plastics.
* Phthalic anhydride production shifts from catalytic oxidation of naphthalene to the o-xylol process.

==Post WWII positive developments==
* Catalytic upgrading of gas by use of hydrogen to react with tarry vapours in the gas
* The decline of coke making in the US leads to a coal tar crisis since coal tar pitch is vital for the production of carbon electrodes for EAF/aluminium. US now has to import coal tar from China
* Development of process to make methanol via hydrogenation of CO/H2 mixtures.
* Mobil M-gas process for making petrol from methanol
* SASOL coal process plant in South Africa.
* Direct hydrogenation of coal into liquid and gaseous fuels
* Dankuni Coal Complex is the only plant in India that is producing coal gas (town gas) in Kolkata using the Continuous Vertical Retort Technology of Babcock-Woodall Duckham (UK), constructed on the recommendation of GoI&#x27;s Fuel Policy Committee of 1974 after the crippling 1973 Oil Crisis. The plant uses a modified low temperature carbonisation to produce the town gas and soft coke. The plant in the 1990s produced various chemicals like xylenol, cresol and phenol.

The by-products of coal gas manufacture included coke, coal tar, sulfur and ammonia and these were all useful products. Dyes, medicines such as sulfa drugs, saccharine, and dozens of organic compounds are made from coal tar.

The coal used, and the town gas and by-products produced, by the major three gas companies of London are summarised in the table.
====Coke====

Coke is used as a smokeless fuel and for the manufacture of water gas and producer gas.

====Coal tar====

Coal tar was subjected to fractional distillation to recover various products, including

* tar, for roads
* benzole, a motor fuel
* creosote, a wood preservative
* phenol, used in the manufacture of plastics
* cresols, disinfectants

====Sulfur====

Used in the manufacture of sulfuric acid

====Ammonia====

Used in the manufacture of fertilisers

===Structure of the UK coal gas industry===

Coal gas was initially manufactured by independent companies but in the United Kingdom many of these later became municipal services. In 1948 there was a total of 1,062 gas undertakings. Both the private companies, about two-thirds of the total, and the municipal gas undertakings, about one-third, were nationalised under the Gas Act 1948. Further restructuring took place under the Gas Act 1972. For further details see British Gas plc.

Apart from in the steel industry&#x27;s coke ovens&#x27; by-products plants, coal gas is no longer made in the UK. It was replaced first by gas made from oil and later by natural gas from the North Sea.

<text>Jean Van Hamme (born 16 January 1939) is a Belgian novelist and comic book writer. He has written scripts for a number of Belgian/French comic series, including &quot;Histoire sans héros&quot;, &quot;Thorgal&quot;, &quot;XIII&quot; and &quot;Largo Winch&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early years===
After studying business administration at the Solvay Brussels School of Economics and Management, he worked as a journalist and in the marketing department of Philips. In the meantime, he started writing, and one of his first scripts was adapted by Paul Cuvelier in 1968. This erotic comic named &quot;Epoxy&quot; was published by the controversial publisher Éric Losfeld, who prior to that also had published similarly themed comics like Jean-Claude Forest&#x27;s &quot;Barbarella&quot; and Robert Gigi&#x27;s &quot;Scarlett Dream&quot;. In 1976, Van Hamme became a full-time writer, and in the next few years he published seven novels and some movie scripts, e.g. for &quot;Diva&quot;.

===Thorgal, XIII and Largo Winch===
Van Hamme&#x27;s main breakthrough came in 1977, when he created the Viking hero &quot;Thorgal&quot; for Grzegorz Rosiński, a relatively unknown Polish comic artist. The mix of medieval legends and heroic fantasy soon became a huge success in the Franco-Belgian comics magazine &quot;Tintin&quot;. The duo won major awards in the French and Belgian comic book industry.

In the next decade, Jean Van Hamme created two new bestselling series, &quot;XIII&quot; with William Vance and &quot;Largo Winch&quot; (based on his own novels) with Philippe Francq. Other series like &quot;Les maîtres de l&#x27;orge&quot; (lit. &quot;The Masters of Barley&quot;) and &quot;Chninkel&quot; have received more critical acclaim but lower sales.

The fame of Van Hamme as one of the major comic authors of Europe is quite established. The artists he works with draw the characters in a realistic style, even if the stories themselves tend to verge towards fantasy.

&quot;Les maîtres de l&#x27;orge&quot; and &quot;Largo Winch&quot; have both been made into TV series, and &quot;XIII&quot;, Thorgal, and &quot;Largo Winch&quot; have been adapted into video games.

===Blake and Mortimer===
After the death of Edgar Pierre Jacobs, the last unfinished &quot;Blake and Mortimer&quot; story was finished by Bob de Moor, and Van Hamme was approached by the publisher to write new stories. The first one, &quot;The Francis Blake Affair&quot;, appeared in 1996 and was a huge success, and Van Hamme has since created two more &quot;Blake and Mortimer&quot; stories.

In 2002, Jean Van Hamme announced his intention to write fewer comics, and to concentrate more on theatre and film scripts, but seems to have changed his mind again and has since created two new stories. In 2006, he ended his run on &quot;Thorgal&quot; with album 29, &quot;Le Sacrifice.&quot; He has also announced his intention to create a spin-off series of &quot;Thorgal&quot;, focusing on his son Jolan. In fact, a new duo, Grzegorz Rosinski and Yves Sente continued the series with four more albums (#30 to #33) which constitute the &quot;Jolan Cycle&quot;.

Van Hamme is one of the best selling European comics writers, with many of his series in the comics bestseller lists each year. In 2006, Van Hamme&#x27;s final volume of &quot;Thorgal&quot; placed fifth in the French list with 280,000 copies published, while &quot;Lady S.&quot;, with Philippe Aymond, had 90,000 copies. In 2005, &quot;XIII&quot; and &quot;Largo Winch&quot; shared the fourth place with 500,000 copies each. In 2010, he was the second-bestselling author of comics in France, after Christophe Arleston but before Albert Uderzo and Hergé, with 1.05 million copies sold.

<doc id="387271" wikidata="Q128277" url="?curid=387271" title="Thorgal">
<text>Thorgal is a fantasy adventure series created in the Franco-Belgian &quot;bandes dessinées&quot; (BD) tradition by Belgian writer Jean Van Hamme and Polish graphic artist Grzegorz Rosiński. Debuting in 1977, it has incorporated elements of Norse mythology and the legend of Atlantis, as well as science fiction and horror.

In 2002, it was adapted as an adventure video game, &quot;&quot;, by Cryo Interactive Entertainment.

==Development==
The comic first appeared in serial form in &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine in 1977, with the story &quot;La Magicienne Trahie&quot;. Originally a stand-alone 30-page project, its early success encouraged turning it into a longer series. 

It has subsequently been published in hardcover volumes by Le Lombard from 1980 on. Translations have appeared in among others, English, Dutch, German, Polish, Italian, Spanish, Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, Tamil and Greek.

Covers for all comic books, or rather comic albums &quot;c.q.&quot; BDs (in North-American understanding though, &quot;graphic novel&quot; is the more applicable terminology in this case, particularly where the physical properties of the book format are concerned, the distinction being otherwise a non-issue in native Francophone Europe) are drawn by Rosiński, even for the spin-off albums which sometimes are drawn by other artists.

== Reception and significance ==
&quot;Thorgal&quot; is critically acclaimed and one of the most popular French language BDs, with more than 11 million Thorgal books in print. There are currently three ongoing successful spin-off series, in addition to the continuation of the main Thorgal series.

It has been called the most popular series published by Le Lombard.

D. Aviva Rothschild in her 1995 book &quot;Graphic Novels: A Bibliographic Guide to Book-length Comics&quot; praised the series, stating that it is &quot;better than an American swords-and-sorcery comic&quot; when it comes to both art and stories. Commenting on &quot;The Archers&quot; volume, Rothschild described it as &quot;one of the finest pieces of heroic fantasy I have ever set my eyes on&quot;.

The series has also been credited with popularizing the BD in Poland.

==Main characters==

*Thorgal Aegirsson: Son of Varth and Haynee, grandson of Xargos – a captain of a spaceship on a way to Earth in search of energy. He is raised by Vikings after his ship crash-lands. He possesses character traits and morality that many Vikings consider a sign of weakness. Thorgal is still a courageous and skillful warrior and an archer of phenomenal skill. His life&#x27;s goal is to find a place for his family to live in peace. For a time, he is stripped of his memory, and becomes the pirate lord Shaigan, though his compassion remained unaltered.
*Aaricia: Thorgal&#x27;s wife and the daughter of Gandalf the Mad, a Viking leader. She is bound to Thorgal from the moment of her birth by a magic object named Tjahzi&#x27;s Tears. Aaricia is a spirited and strong-willed woman, who loves her family dearly despite all the mishaps Thorgal&#x27;s fate brings to their lives.
*Jolan: Thorgal&#x27;s son. He possesses supernatural powers as the heritage of Thorgal&#x27;s mysterious ancestry. For most of the series his power is limited to molecular agitation (usually the ability to disintegrate objects). He gradually learns to hone his ability.
*Louve: Thorgal and Aaricia&#x27;s daughter, who has the ability to communicate with animals.
*Kriss of Valnor: A young, beautiful, unscrupulous and deadly warrior, and also a skilled archer. She first appears in &quot;Les Archers&quot;, and then intermittently in the following stories. She is in some ways Thorgal&#x27;s greatest nemesis, and repeatedly tries to hurt him and his family, but occasionally shows hints of admiration and even secret love for Thorgal. When Thorgal loses his memory, she tricks him into believing that they are married, and convinces Thorgal that he is the ruthless pirate lord Shaigan. She becomes pregnant with his son Aniel, whom her father Kahaniel of Valnor wished to reincarnate himself, but Thorgal eventually regains his memory and leaves to find his true family. Later, she ends up as a slave in Byzantium and apparently sacrifices her life to help Thorgal&#x27;s family escape from the same slave pits, but is later revealed to be alive and queen in the northern lands. 
*Aniel: the young son of Thorgal and Kriss of Valnor, conceived while Thorgal lived as the pirate lord Shaigan. He and his mother fall prey to Byzantian slavers, and his vocal cords are cut to forestall crying, leaving him mute. Later, Kriss and Aniel escape the slave pits with Aaricia, Jolan and Louve, who had also been brought there. When Kriss is wounded by her pursuers and prepared to make her last stand, she asks Aaricia to take care of Aniel. Aaricia agrees and takes Aniel in as one of her own children. Aniel is later kidnapped to serve as a host body for Kahlim, grand master of the Red Mages of the oriental city of Bag Dadh (&quot;Le Feu écarlate&quot;). With the help of Armenos the Mage, both Kahaniel and Kahlim are exorcised from him, but having become hateful of Thorgal, he leaves with his mother.





==Other characters==
*Ogotai (also known as Varth): the war-loving, merciless &quot;god&quot; brought by the sea into the land of Qâ (a presumably South American pre-Columbian civilization). He leads his people into countless conquests of the neighboring tribes and orders endless human sacrifices to himself. He has superior intelligence, knowledge of highly advanced technology, and supernatural powers, which he uses to trick people into believing he is a true god. In reality, he is a grief-stricken, crazed man, driven by the vengeance against the planet he believes responsible for the death of his beloved wife and son.
*Tanatloc (also known as Xargos): another &quot;god&quot; living in the land of Qâ. He is the nemesis of Ogotai, with whom he shares a secret past. He is kept hidden from his people.
*Darek and Lehla: brother and sister children of banished Vikings who met Aaricia and her family after they had been banished from their village following Shaigan&#x27;s raids against their people. They joined Thorgal and his family on their journey, but after a few adventures they decided to stay behind on an island Thorgal and Louve had just liberated from a tyrant (&quot;Arachneà&quot;). However, Lehla later turns up a slave in the northern lands, where she is liberated by Thorgal and taken along for his search for Aniel (&quot;Le bateau-sabre&quot;). They later recover Darek from slavery in the jungle kingdom of Zhari (&quot;Aniel&quot;), and they subsequently join Thorgal&#x27;s extended family.
*The Key Guardian: a powerful magician, who is (or maybe just assumes the form of) a beautiful woman. The gods have entrusted her with the task of guarding the passages between worlds. She walks between the worlds, wearing nothing but a golden girdle that grants her powers and immortality. She has (like many other female characters appearing in the series) a crush on Thorgal, but she respects his loyalty to his family. Because of her love, she is eventually dismissed as a Guardian, cast out into the mortal world, and adopts the name Cleo (&quot;Louve&quot; #6: &quot;La Reine des Alfes noirs&quot;).
*Tjall (called by some people &quot;Tjall-The-Fiery&quot;): the young, hot-headed nephew of Treefoot and friend of Thorgal. An excellent archer with a good heart and a silly mind, who has a crush on Kriss. He later dies while accompanying Thorgal to the City of the Lost God (&quot;La Cité du Dieu Perdu&quot;), saving him from a raging mob.
*Argun Treefoot: He&#x27;s uncle of Tjall. He&#x27;s a warrior past his prime and with a pegleg, but still an exceptional archer and bowmaker. One of Thorgal&#x27;s few friends.
*Solveig: she is a Viking who is the best friend of Aaricia. Devoted friend she will help the family Aegirsson.
*Shaniah: a teenage girl from a village enamored in the adult and married Thorgal. Out of jealousy she causes a great tragedy in Thorgal&#x27;s life, but later redeems herself by giving her own life to save Aaricia.
*Gandalf the Mad: Aaricia&#x27;s father and king of the Vikings of the North. He became the leader of his tribe after Thorgal&#x27;s adoptive father&#x27;s death. Greedy, cruel and mad, he makes repeated attempts at Thorgal&#x27;s life, whom he perceives a threat to the legitimacy of his own rule.
*Tiago and Ileniya: brother and sister descendants of a group of space-farers who had landed on Midgard and formed the fabled kingdom of Atlantis. They foiled their elders&#x27; plan to enslave the world and travelled together with Thorgal and his family. Soon afterwards, however, they were all taken as slaves to a Byzantinian governor and his sadistic son Heraclius, who made Ilyena his personal &#x27;pet&quot;. When Tiago tried to stop Heraclius from abusing his sister, the nobleman murdered him; in revenge, Ileniya killed Heraclius later on and, facing imminent death, joined her brother by throwing herself off a cliff.
*Snake Nidhogg: a powerful, mythological monster creature, which Thorgal dared to go against in his youth with the help of the goddess Frigg. Based on Níðhöggr from Norse mythology.
*Volsung of Nichor: A cunning, treacherous schemer. He first appears as Thorgal&#x27;s competitor in &quot;Three Elders of Aran&quot;, but apparently dies in the tests they have to face. Actually, Nidhogg saves him to be her servant; his mission is to gain the Girdle of Immortality from the Guardian of the Keys. For betraying her, she transforms Volsung into a toad and keeps him with her trapped in the neverness.
*Muff: A dog that belongs to Jolan &amp; Louve. He appears for the last time in &quot;The Blue Sickness&quot;, when he stayed on the island of &quot;Our Ground&quot;, together with Darek de Svear and his sister Lehla, because he was too old to travel any further.
*Alinoë: Appeared in the volume of the same name as a violent, primitive boy with green hair, later revealed to be part of Jolan&#x27;s imagination. He vanished when Jolan&#x27;s mysterious bracelet was removed by Thorgal.
*Manthor: a Viking Half-God who cures Thorgal in &quot;Sacrifice&quot;. He is the son of Kahaniel of Valnor and the half-brother of Kriss of Valnor.
*Vigrid: One of the lesser Gods of Asgard who is indebted towards Aaricia for having helped him after having gone blind. He repays this debt by helping her husband reach Manthor and bringing her back to her ancestral home. However, his love for Aaricia eventually made him abandon a task set by the gods, compelling Frigg to banish him from Asgard to Svartalfheim (&quot;Louve&quot; #5: &quot;Skald&quot;). However, he finally earns his eventual pardon by taking the recalcitrant Niddhog&#x27;s destined place as the guardian of Yggdrasil (&quot;Louve&quot; #7: &quot;Niddhog&quot;).
*The Kingdom of Zhar (first featured in &quot;Le Mal Bleu&quot;)
**Zarkaj and Zajkar: The twin princes of Zhar. To avoid dynastic disputes, Zajkar was chosen to be killed right after birth, but survived and was taken in by the Myrms. After growing to manhood, and with Thorgal&#x27;s help, he reclaims his rightful place and reconciles with his brother, with whom he rules the realm as a diarchy.
**Armenos: A reclusive mage and inventor. He first saves Thorgal and his family from the Blue Death disease, and later Aniel from his dual possession (&quot;Aniel&quot;).
**Zim: A member of the Myrms, Zharians afflicted with dwarfism and made outcast swamp-dwellers. Zim falls in love with Thorgal upon his first visit, but respects his faithfulness to his family. When Thorgal returns to Zhar after completing his search for Aniel, Zim loses her life in the last decisive battle against a horde of Amazons.
*Gilli and Ava: The children of Grimur from the village of Mikladalur, a henchman of the sysselmann of Kalsoy. While Gilli is a normal human boy, Ava is half selkie, the result of Grimur having captured himself one of the seal-folk as his wife. When Grimur kidnapped Louve to rear her as a new wife, Thorgar and Jolan went to her rescue, which set off a chain of events which lifted a curse bestowed on the islanders by the selkies; Grimur is killed in an uprising against the tyrannical sysselmann, while Ava&#x27;s mother recovers her pelt and returns into the sea. With their parents gone, the two children are taken in as part of Thorgal&#x27;s family (&quot;La selkie&quot;).

==Fictional character biography==
After being lost at sea, the ship of Viking leader Leif Haraldson suddenly finds its way home, guided by a mysterious light in the fog. To the superstitious Vikings, the light is seen as a sign from the gods. Once on shore, they find a sort of capsule, which appears to be the source of the mysterious light. Leif opens the capsule and finds a newborn baby boy. He names the child Thor-gal Aegirs-son, after Thor, the Norse God of Thunder, and Aegir, the ruler of the sea, because he considers Thorgal to be a gift from the Gods. Leif takes Thorgal under his care as his adoptive son.

As Thorgal grows up, he is curious about his origins and often ostracized by his peers for not being a &quot;real&quot; Viking. On his sixth birthday, Leif gives him two strange artifacts taken from the capsule he was found in. One is a jewel made from &quot;the metal that doesn&#x27;t exist&quot;. The jewel brings Thorgal on his first adventure, and binds his fate forever with that of Aaricia (his future wife). When Thorgal is twelve, the other gift prompts him to visit an old wiseman, who reveals to Thorgal his origins and true identity. He tells him that he&#x27;s one of the last survivors of a group of technologically advanced space-farers who came to the planet in search of new energy sources. His people have great supernatural powers like changing the molecular composition of matter with their mind; powers that Thorgal himself seems not to have. Thorgal learns about his real parents and grandfather, and the events that preceded his birth. The old man decides to erase Thorgal&#x27;s memory of their encounter and the knowledge he just learned, believing that it will be better for Thorgal to grow up as a &quot;normal&quot; Viking boy with no supernatural powers. Thorgal, however, continues to grow up as curious and conflicted about his true identity as ever.

Soon after this event Leif Haraldson dies and Gandalf the Mad is chosen as his successor. Gandalf repeatedly tries to get rid of Thorgal, because -– as he constantly reminds everyone – Thorgal is an outsider and not of Viking blood. In reality, Gandalf feels threatened because Thorgal is Leif&#x27;s heir. In the meantime, Thorgal&#x27;s relationship with Aaricia, Gandalf&#x27;s daughter, develops and strengthens. While her wishes do not have much influence on her father, she is able to save Thorgal from certain death (by her father&#x27;s hand) through her determination and ingenuity.

The first album of the series starts some years later, when Thorgal is already an adult, and Gandalf devises a plan to kill him after realizing how deep the love his daughter has for Thorgal really is.

==Collected French language editions==
The albums consist of several story arcs and many stand-alone stories.

Notes

The 29th volume, &quot;The Sacrifice&quot;, was the final volume scripted by Jean Van Hamme. Here, Thorgal escapes the curse of Odin. He finds peace in the only home he knows: the Viking village of his adopted father, but then must make a choice.

Danish translation of the series appeared in a different order, beginning with the chronicles of Thorgal&#x27;s youth.
The first album in the series &quot;La Magicienne Trahie&quot; is number 22 in the Danish series.

In Denmark numbers 22-23 (#1-2) were first published by the publisher Interpresse under the name &quot;&quot;Cormak&quot;, probably to capitalize upon the popular series &quot;Conan&quot;. The name was soon changed back to &quot;Thorgal&quot;&quot; when Carlsen Comics took over the series.

==English releases==
All English-language &quot;Thorgal&quot; album releases have to date adhered to the approximately standard European BD A4-format, a book format US and UK readerships have historically not been accustomed to, they instead being born and bred with the much smaller, standard US comic book format. The closest format resembling the European one, US and UK readership are traditionally familiar with, is that of the US graphic novel format, though it too is somewhat smaller.

Donning Company Publishers (US) had the earliest three English-language titles published in the 1980s
#&quot;Thorgal, Child of the Stars&quot; hardcover was published in 1986 with 
#&quot;The Archers&quot; hardcover was published in 1987 with (a softcover version was a year later published under the company&#x27;s &quot;Schiffer Pub&quot; imprint with 
#&quot;The Sorceress Betrayed&quot; a 96 page softcover omnibus collecting the series&#x27; first two volumes &quot;La Magicienne Trahie&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Ile des Mers gelées&quot;, was published in 1988 with under the company&#x27;s &quot;Ink Publishing Company&quot; imprint

Cinebook Ltd (UK) released the English-language (main) series up until volume 24 in the softcover print format starting with &quot;Child of the Stars&quot; and &quot;Aaricia&quot; in 2007. Europe Comics, partnered with Cinebook along with other publishers, took over the English language publications following their formation in 2015 and released the main series (including rereleases of older titles) plus the spin-off series in digital format only. They started in 2019 with the digital release of the main series, starting with volume 21 which was as the only one released under the same ISBN for both formats. With volume 22 digital releases had from 2020 onward overtaken Cinebook&#x27;s print releases, which from then on was lagging far behind with their print releases, aside from the circumstance that Cinebook did none of the spin-off series.

<text>Diageo plc ( ) is a British multinational alcoholic beverage company, with its headquarters in London, England. It operates from 132 sites around the world. It is a major distributor of Scotch whisky and other spirits. Distilleries owned by Diageo produce 40 percent of all Scotch whisky with over 24 brands, such as Johnnie Walker, J&amp;B and Buchanan&#x27;s. Its leading brands outside whisky include Guinness, Smirnoff, Baileys liqueur, Captain Morgan rum and Tanqueray and Gordon&#x27;s gin.

Diageo has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. It has a secondary listing on the New York Stock Exchange as American depositary receipts.

==Name==
Diageo is an invented name that was created by the branding consultancy Wolff Olins in 1997. The name is composed of the Latin word &quot;diēs&quot;, meaning &quot;day&quot;, and the Greek root &quot;geo-&quot;, meaning &quot;earth&quot;; and is meant to reference the company slogan &quot;Celebrating Life, Every Day, Everywhere&quot;.

==History==
===Formation===
Diageo was formed in 1997 from the merger of Guinness plc and Grand Metropolitan. Its creation was driven by the executives Anthony Greener and Philip Yea at Guinness, along with George Bull and John McGrath of Grand Metropolitan. Anthony Greener was the first executive chairman. Shares in Diageo began trading on the London Stock Exchange on 17 December 1997.

===Exit from non-core assets===
As a legacy of the merger, Diageo owned a number of brands, businesses, and assets which were not in the core alcoholic drinks category. The company has gradually disposed of these assets to focus on beverages as its core business. This included the sale of the Pillsbury Company to General Mills in 2000, and the 2002 sale of the Burger King fast food restaurant chain to a consortium led by US firm Texas Pacific for US$1.5 billion.

The predecessor company Grand Metropolitan had been a major owner of hotels, owning what is now Intercontinental Hotels prior to divestment before merging into Diageo, but the company still owned the Gleneagles Hotel in Perthshire, which had hosted events including the Ryder Cup and G8 summit. In 2015 Diageo reached an agreement to sell the hotel to the Ennismore Group, already owners of The Hoxton hotels.

In November 2016, Diageo announced its intention of selling at auction Sir Edwin Landseer&#x27;s iconic 1851 painting &quot;The Monarch of the Glen&quot; – which the company owned, but which has been on loan to the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh since 1999 – as it has &quot;no direct link to our business or brands&quot;, being used on the label of rival brand Glenfiddich, owned by William Grant &amp; Sons. Following a fundraising campaign, the painting was sold to the National Galleries of Scotland for around half its assayed value of £8 million.

===Divestment of beer and wine===
In 2015, the company made major sales in both the beer and wine categories, selling the Red Stripe beer brand, along with interests in other breweries, and the rights to Guinness in some territories to Heineken, as well as the sale of most of its wine business to Treasury Wine Estates. The separate 2019 sale of the remaining wine brands including Navarro Correas and Chalone Vineyard saw Diageo exit the category.

Whilst Diageo did acquire South African beer producer United National Breweries (UNB) in April 2015 shortly before the Red Stripe sale was made, they divested it again in the second half of 2019.

In December 2023 it was speculated in the media that Diageo would exit from the beer market entirely, potentially including the Guinness brand, but this was denied by the company.

===International expansion===
The business has grown with purchases of alcohol businesses around the world, including the 2011 part-ownership and 2013 full acquisition of the Chinese baijiu manufacturer Sichuan Shuijingfang Company in China.

The company further acquired Turkish liquor company Mey Icki for US$2.1 billion in 2011, and in 2012 followed this with Brazilian cachaça manufacturer Ypióca for £300 million, and the Indian United Spirits which they acquired a majority stake for £1.28 billion.

===Expansions and investments===
In June 2012, Diageo announced a £1 billion investment in Scotch whisky production over the following five years, with at least one new distillery to be constructed, several existing facilities to be expanded, and overall production capacity to be increased by 30 to 40 per cent.

In December 2015, Diageo announced a US$10 million investment in Danish whisky brand Stauning, to facilitate expansion of production.

In February 2017, Diageo announced plans to open a Guinness brewery and tourist attraction in Baltimore County, Maryland. The brewery could potentially host as many as 300,000 visitors per year.

In October 2021, Diageo completed a £185m investment in Scotch whisky tourism with the royal opening by Prince Charles, Duke of Rothesay, of its centrepiece visitor centre in Edinburgh, Scotland, promoting the Johnnie Walker brand of blended Scotch whisky.

In October 2021, Diageo announced plans to invest $500m to expand its manufacturing in Mexico for the tequila category. Construction of the new facilities in Jalisco, Mexico is expected to begin in 2021.

Diageo announced plans to build a €200 million brewery in Newbridge, County Kildare, Ireland in July 2022. In February 2024, High Court proceedings were lodged against An Bord Pleanála by an Athy resident opposing the decision to approve the project. After mediation talks with Diageo, the challenge was withdrawn in April.

===Non-alcoholic expansion===
In August 2019, Diageo bought the majority stake in Seedlip, a non-alcoholic spirits brand.

In September 2024, it was announced Diageo had acquired Ritual Zero Proof a non-alcoholic spirits brand.

===Corporate changes===
In March 2023, it was announced that Debra Crew would succeed Sir Ivan Menezes as CEO of the company. Crew started her role a month ahead of plan after Menezes died on 7 June 2023.

In May 2023, it was announced that Diageo has provided funding to establish the British Aluminium Consortium for Advance Alloys (BACALL), a collective of industry experts who will create a circular economy in the UK.

===Spirits acquisition and disposal===
In 1998, Diageo sold the John Dewar &amp; Sons, Ltd. company including Aberfeldy, Aultmore, Craigellachie, Royal Brackla distilleries and Bombay Sapphire gin to Bacardi Limited.

In 2001, Diageo acquired the collapsed Seagram&#x27;s spirits and wine businesses which included Captain Morgan and Seagram&#x27;s blended whiskey.

In 2002, Diageo sold Malibu rum to Allied Domecq for £560m ($800m).

In 2002, Diageo sold the inactive Rosebank distillery buildings and contents to British Waterways.

Diageo acquired a 50% stake in Don Julio tequila through a joint venture with owner Jose Cuervo, for which they paid US$100 million in 2003. They later obtained full ownership of the brand after agreeing to sell Bushmills Irish whiskey to Proximo Spirits, who had since acquired Jose Cuervo, in exchange for US$408 million and full ownership of the tequila brand.

In 2004, Diageo sold the inactive Coleburn distillery buildings and contents to the Winchester Brothers with plans to transform the distillery grounds into a whisky resort.

Diageo formed a relationship with rapper Sean Combs in an &quot;equal-share venture&quot; in 2007 to promote the Cîroc vodka brand, and this led to the joint purchase of the DeLeón Tequila brand in 2013. The partnership was terminated in 2024 after a legal dispute, leaving Diageo the sole owner of both brands.

In 2007, Diageo sold the inactive Port Charlotte distillery buildings and contents to The Bruichladdich Distillery Co. Ltd.

In 2010, Diageo opened Roseisle distillery at a cost of £40 million.

In 2010, Diageo closed Port Dundas grain distillery that was demolished in 2011.

In March 2016, the company sold Grand Marnier, a cognac and bitter orange-based liqueur, to the Italian beverage company Campari Group.

In June 2017, the Casamigos tequila brand – a US-based tequila, launched in 2013 was acquired by Diageo.

In November 2018, Diageo sold Seagram&#x27;s whiskey brand, along with Myers&#x27;s Rum, Popov vodka, Booth&#x27;s Gin, Goldschläger, Yukon Jack, Sambuca, and 11 other brands to the Sazerac Company for US$550 million, but kept the Seagram&#x27;s Seven Crown brand.

In September 2022, Diageo sold Archers brand to De Kuyper Royal Distillers.

In October 2022, it was announced Diageo had acquired the Australian cold-brew coffee liqueur brand, Mr Black.

In November 2022, it was announced that Diageo would acquire Balcones Distilling, a whiskey distillery based in Texas.

In October 2023, Diageo sold Windsor Global, which owns blended Scotch brand Windsor, to private equity firm PT W Co of South Korea, sponsored by the Pine Tree Investment &amp; Management Co.

In February 2024, a report claimed Diageo was looking to sell the brands &quot;Pimm&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Safari&quot; and &quot;Pampero Rum&quot;. Both &quot;Safari&quot; and &quot;Pampero rum&quot; were sold in July 2024.

On 19 March 2024, Diageo reopened Port Ellen distillery after 40 years of closure and a £185 million (US$235m) restoration.

In November 2024, the company formed Diageo Luxury Group, a new luxury division to combine its luxury spirits and experiences, with brands like Brora, Port Ellen and the company&#x27;s 15 brand homes and distiller experiences. The company said it would also help to grow Justerini &amp; Brooks.

In January 2025, Diageo sold Cacique to La Martiniquaise for an undisclosed sum.

Diageo&#x27;s head office is in Great Marlborough Street, London after moving in 2022 from its previous location in Park Royal, London Borough of Brent, on the site of a former Guinness brewery which had closed in 2004 after producing beer since 1936. Diageo&#x27;s previous head office facility had been located in Henrietta Place, in the Marylebone district of the City of Westminster in London, since 1996. In 2009, Diageo announced that it was closing the Henrietta Place facility as part of a cost reduction programme and moved its employees to the Park Royal site.

==Controversies and legal issues==
===Criticism===
In December 2003, Diageo provoked controversy over its decision to change its Cardhu brand Scotch whisky from a single malt to a blended malt whilst retaining the original name and bottle style. Diageo took this action because it did not have sufficient reserves to meet demand in the Spanish market, where Cardhu had been successful. After a meeting of producers, Diageo agreed to make changes. In 2006, the Cardhu brand changed back to being a single malt.

In May 2012, Scottish craft brewery BrewDog revealed that Diageo had threatened to withdraw funding from the British Institute of Innkeeping Scotland&#x27;s annual awards if BrewDog was to be named winner of the Best Bar Operator award. Diageo was forced to issue an apology.

In March 2015, Diageo released an advertising campaign showing a young woman crying after a night out, as an older woman, likely her mother, looks at her from the doorway, and the caption, &quot;Who&#x27;s following in your footsteps? Out of control drinking has consequences&quot;. The ad probably implied that the girl had been assaulted on the way home, as a result of her drinking that night. The director of Rape Crisis Network Ireland said Diageo &quot;blames victims of sexual violence for the crimes that have been committed against them. This is a harmful, regressive and hurtful message which targets the vulnerable.&quot;

===Factory closures and moves===

In July 2009, Diageo announced that, after nearly 200 years of association with the town of Kilmarnock, Scotland, they would be closing the Johnnie Walker blending and bottling plant as part of a restructuring to the business, with work moved to Diageo&#x27;s other two sites in Shieldhall and Leven. It would make 700 workers unemployed and caused outrage from the press, local people, and politicians. A campaign against the decision was launched by the local SNP MSP Willie Coffey and Labour MP Des Browne. A petition was drawn up against the plans, which also involved the closure of the historic Port Dundas grain distillery in Glasgow. The Johnnie Walker plant in Kilmarnock closed its doors in March 2012 and the buildings were subsequently demolished a year later.

In April 2011, the National Puerto Rican Coalition planned to run a series of ads in New York City and Puerto Rico urging a boycott of Diageo-owned alcoholic drinks to protest the corporation&#x27;s production move of its Captain Morgan rum from Puerto Rico to the U.S. Virgin Islands, which will provide it with US$2.7 billion in tax benefits over 30 years.

===Regulatory issues===
In August 2011, Diageo agreed to pay more than US$16 million to settle U.S. civil regulatory charges that it made improper payments to foreign officials. Regulators accused the British company of violating the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act through its subsidiaries to obtain lucrative sales and tax benefits for its Johnnie Walker and Windsor Scotch whiskies and other brands.

In January 2020, Diageo agreed to pay US$5 million to settle charges brought by the US Securities and Exchange Commission that alleged the company had pressured distributors to buy products in excess of demand in order to hit performance goals.

<text>Largo Winch is a Belgian comic book series by Philippe Francq and Jean Van Hamme, published by Dupuis. It started as a series of novels by Van Hamme in the late 1970s, but stopped due to a lack of success and the huge amount of work Van Hamme had in the meantime with his comic books (e.g. &quot;Thorgal&quot;). When artist Philippe Francq wanted to start a series with Van Hamme, he revived his old hero, and reworked the novels into the first albums of the comic book series. Later, more stories followed.

== Synopsis ==

The main character is Largo Winch; birth name Largo Winczlav, who was born in Yugoslavia. Other important characters include Nerio Winch (his adoptive father, though they share a great-grandparent), senior Group W executives John D. Sullivan and Dwight E. Cochrane, and his friend Simon Ovronnaz. In the first two volumes of the series, &quot;L&#x27;héritier&quot; and &quot;Le Groupe W&quot;, Largo, a young and handsome orphan, is propelled to the head of a business empire, &quot;Group W&quot; (of no relation to the real-life broadcasting division of American conglomerate Westinghouse Electric Corporation), after his adoptive father Nerio is murdered, and goes through a lot of troubles to preserve his inheritance and avenge Nerio. The following albums are more or less based on the same basic plot: someone is trying to harm Largo&#x27;s company or to take control of it from him, and he has to fight that someone to ensure the survival of his holdings. Almost every story arc involves corrupt authority figures of a type which Nerio easily manipulated, but Largo confronts from the viewpoint of an &quot;everyman&quot;.

All the stories of the series are published in two volumes, the first one being the one putting Largo in an impossible situation, and the second one letting him get out of it. In addition, both volumes share the same background color on the cover. The stories appear originally in French, and have been translated into various languages, including Croatian, Danish, Dutch, English, German, Greek, Polish, Portuguese, Serbian, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, Italian and Tamil. The series is among the most popular comics series in French, with annual sales of nearly 500,000 copies.

==History==

The birth of the character came in 1973, while Van Hamme was having lunch in New York City with Greg, chief editor of &quot;Tintin&quot;. The magazine sought to expand to the American market and Van Hamme was tasked with creating the comic character and genre interesting for an American audience. He thus opted for a business-thriller idea about a young mysterious billionaire, which would allow him to demonstrate his knowledge of economics. John Prentice, noted for his work on &quot;Rip Kirby&quot;, was chosen as the artist, and he drew a couple of boards before withdrawing from the project that was soon abandoned. Van Hamme first revived the character in form of an airport novel in 1978, encouraged by the huge popularity of Gérard de Villiers&#x27; SAS novels. The series lasted through 1985 when it came to a halt again. Finally, in 1990, being approached by Francq, Van Hamme used the character yet again in comic form, and it had instant success.

===TV===
An English-language TV series loosely based on the comics was launched in 2001 and lasted two seasons, starring Paolo Seganti as Largo Winch and Diego Walraff as Simon Ovronnaz. It aired in France on M6 and in Canada on Showcase Television as &quot;Largo&quot;. The complete series is available on DVD in France, with the episodes however only in dubbed French.

===Film===
A film, written and directed by Jérôme Salle and starring Tomer Sisley as Largo Winch, was released in France on December 17, 2008, loosely adapting the first two issues with elements of the next two.

A sequel, also by Salle, was released in 2011. Not adapting a particular storyline, it drew inspiration from the events of the fifth and six issues to create a new story. A third film is in the works, based on issues 13 and 14, without the involvement of Salle and Sisley but with a screenplay by series creator Jean Van Hamme himself, who&#x27;d been critical of the past films, and of Salle in particular.

A documentary, &quot;Largo&quot;, directed by Yves Legrain-Crist with Jean Van Hamme and Philippe Francq, was released in France in Autumn 2007. This film shows two authors are searching for the answer to the question:
&quot;How is a comic book created?&quot; It is available, with English subtitles, directly from the producers through VOD

<text>Neuropsychological tests are specifically designed tasks that are used to measure a psychological function known to be linked to a particular brain structure or pathway. Tests are used for research into brain function and in a clinical setting for the diagnosis of deficits. They usually involve the systematic administration of clearly defined procedures in a formal environment. Neuropsychological tests are typically administered to a single person working with an examiner in a quiet office environment, free from distractions. As such, it can be argued that neuropsychological tests at times offer an estimate of a person&#x27;s peak level of cognitive performance. Neuropsychological tests are a core component of the process of conducting neuropsychological assessment, along with personal, interpersonal and contextual factors.

Most neuropsychological tests in current use are based on traditional psychometric theory. In this model, a person&#x27;s raw score on a test is compared to a large general population normative sample, that should ideally be drawn from a comparable population to the person being examined. Normative studies frequently provide data stratified by age, level of education, and/or ethnicity, where such factors have been shown by research to affect performance on a particular test. This allows for a person&#x27;s performance to be compared to a suitable control group, and thus provide a fair assessment of their current cognitive function.

According to Larry J. Seidman, the analysis of the wide range of neuropsychological tests can be broken down into four categories. First is an analysis of overall performance, or how well people do from test to test along with how they perform in comparison to the average score. Second is left-right comparisons: how well a person performs on specific tasks that deal with the left and right side of the body. Third is pathognomic signs, or specific test results that directly relate to a distinct disorder. Finally, the last category is differential patterns, which are typically used to diagnose specific diseases or types of damage.

==Categories==
Most forms of cognition actually involve multiple cognitive functions working in unison, however tests can be organised into broad categories based on the cognitive function which they predominantly assess.

===Intelligence===
Intelligence testing in a clinical setting intelligence can involve premorbid estimates, determined through a number of methods, for comparison with obtained results. For example, test results can be compared to expected achievement levels based on prior education and occupation.

===Memory===
Memory is a very broad function which includes several distinct abilities, all of which can be selectively impaired and require individual testing. There is disagreement as to the number of memory systems, depending on the psychological perspective taken. From a clinical perspective, a view of five distinct types of memory, is in most cases sufficient. Semantic memory and episodic memory (collectively called declarative memory or explicit memory); procedural memory and priming or perceptual learning (collectively called non-declarative memory or implicit memory) all four of which are long term memory systems; and working memory or short term memory. Semantic memory is memory for facts, episodic memory is autobiographical memory, procedural memory is memory for the performance of skills, priming is memory facilitated by prior exposure to a stimulus and working memory is a form of short term memory for information manipulation.}

== Benefits of Neuropsychological Testing ==
The most beneficial factor of neuropsychological assessment is that it provides an accurate diagnosis of the disorder for the patient when it is unclear to the psychologist what exactly the patient has. This allows for accurate treatment later on in the process because treatment is driven by the exact symptoms of the disorder and how a specific patient may react to different treatments. The assessment allows the psychologist and patient to understand the severity of the deficit and to allow better decision-making by both parties.

<doc id="387292" wikidata="Q219608" url="?curid=387292" title="Ambon Island">
<text>Ambon Island is part of the Maluku Islands. The island has an area of and is mountainous, well watered, and fertile. Ambon Island consists of two territories: the city of Ambon to the south, and three districts (&quot;kecamatan&quot;) of the Central Maluku Regency to the north. The main city and seaport is Ambon (with a 2020 Census population of 347,288), which is also the capital of Maluku province, while those districts of Maluku Tengah Regency situated on Ambon Island had a 2020 Census population of 128,069. By mid 2023 those populations were estimated to have become 354,052 and 128,754 respectively, resulting in an all-island population of 482,806.

Ambon has an airport and is home to the Pattimura University and Open University (Universitas Terbuka), state universities, and a few private universities, which include Darussalam University (Universitas Darussalam, UNDAR) and Universitas Kristen Indonesia Maluku (UKIM).

==Geography==
Ambon Island lies off the southwest coast of the much larger Seram island. It is on the north side of the Banda Sea, part of a chain of volcanic islands that encircle the sea. It is long and is of very irregular shape, being almost divided in two by a large inlet (Ambon Bay). The southeastern and smaller portion, (thereby forming a peninsula called Leitimur) is united to the larger northern portion (called Leihitu or Hitoe) by a narrow neck of land. The Ambon Bay thus formed cuts about into the island with the airport on the northern shore and the city of Ambon on the northern, eastern and southern sides. The city of Ambon covers the entirety of Leitimur, with its centre on the northwest coast of Leitimur, but also includes the south-central part of Leihitu, and has a safe harbor on Amboina Bay.

The highest mountains, Wawani at and Salahutu at , have hot springs and solfataras. They are volcanoes, and the mountains of the neighboring Lease Islands are extinct volcanoes. Granite and serpentine rocks predominate, but the shores of Amboina Bay are of chalk and contain stalactite caves.

Wild areas of Ambon Island are covered by tropical rainforest, part of the Seram rain forests ecoregion, together with neighboring Seram. Seram, Ambon, and most of Maluku are part of Wallacea, the group of Indonesian islands that are separated by deep water from both the Asian and Australian continents and have never been linked to the continents by land.

As a result of this isolation, Ambon has few indigenous mammals; birds are more abundant. The insect diversity of the island, however, is rich, particularly in butterflies. Seashells are obtained in great numbers and variety. Tortoise shell is also exported. The coast of Ambon is identified as a site of highest marine biodiversity importance in the Coral Triangle.

The population of the island (administered as Kota Ambon in the south, and Kecamatan Leihitu, Kecamatan Leihitu Barat, and Kecamatan Salahutu in the rural north) was just below 441,000 in the 2010 Census, but by 2020 had risen to over 475,000, and was over 482,800 in mid 2023. This included three tiny and sparsely populated islands (Lain, Hatala and Ela Islands) off the northwest coast,

== Geology ==
Ambon Island is one of many islands influenced by the tectonics driven by the convergence of the Pacific, Indo-Australian, and Eurasian Plates. The northeastern region of the Banda Sea is dominated by the western motion of the Pacific Plate, which has resulted in the formation of a large zone of strike slip faulting. Evidence of slab rollback is also present in the region, expressed in troughs such as the Weber Deep. This motion also is expressed in extensional normal faults across Ambon. Several marine terraces are exposed in the bay regions of the island, supporting theories of uplift in the Banda Sea due to the subduction of the Indo-Australia Plate. These terraces are aged to a period of late Pleistocene to Holocene and are cut by the many faults of the island and are uplifted vertically up to 100 m. Terraces, fault scarps, and recorded seismicity reveal that active faulting continues and indicate that the seismic hazard on the island is high in the future. 

==Climate==
The average temperature is , rarely falling below . Rainfall can be heavy, especially after the eastern monsoons, and the island is vulnerable to violent typhoons. The wet season (October to April) coincides with the period of the west monsoon.

==Economy==

Cassava and sago are the chief crops, which also include breadfruit, sugarcane, coffee, cocoa, pepper and cotton. In addition to these, hunting and fishing supplement the local diet. Nutmeg and cloves were once the dominant export crops but are now produced in limited quantities. Copra is also exported. Amboina wood, obtained from the angsana tree and highly valued for ornamental woodwork, is now mostly grown on Seram. The main employers in Ambon Island are the Gubernatorial Office (PEMDA), the Mayoral Office (PEMKOT), Raiders 733 (Indonesian military unit).

The whole economy of Ambon Island is starting to shift out of the &quot;Old Towne&quot; (&quot;Kota Lama&quot;) toward Passo, which is the newly appointed central business district of the island region. The economy of Ambon Island was recently boosted by the investment made by Ciputra Group in creating a whole new satellite city in Lateri, Kotamadya Ambon, Maluku: Citraland Bay View City. The new international standard shopping center, Ambon City Center, opened in 2012.

==Demographics==

The Ambonese are of mixed Malay-Papuan origin. They are mostly Christians or Muslims. The predominant language of the island is Ambonese Malay, also called &quot;Ambonese&quot;. It developed as the trade language of central Maluku and is spoken elsewhere in Maluku as a second language. The old creole trade language called Portugis has died out. Bilingualism in Indonesian is high around Ambon City. There have been strong religious tensions on the island between Muslims and Christians and ethnic tensions between indigenous Ambonese and migrants from Sulawesi, primarily Butonese, Bugis and Makassarese migrants.

==History==
===Colonial era===

In 1512, the Portuguese were the first Europeans to land in Ambon, and it alongside Timor became a center for Portuguese activities in Maluku following their expulsion from Ternate. The Portuguese, however, were regularly attacked by native Muslims on the island&#x27;s northern coast, in particular Hitu, which had trading and religious links with major port cities on Java&#x27;s north coast. They established a factory in 1521 but did not obtain peaceable possession of it until 1580. Indeed, the Portuguese never managed to control the local trade in spices and failed in attempts to establish their authority over the Banda Islands, the nearby centre of nutmeg production. The creole trade language Portugis, however, was spoken well into the 19th century, and many families still have Portuguese names and claim Portuguese ancestry, for example Muskita and De Fretes.
The Dutch dispossessed the Portuguese in 1605, when Steven van der Hagen took over the fort without a single shot. Ambon was the headquarters of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) from 1610 to 1619 until the founding of Batavia (now Jakarta) by the Dutch. About 1615 the English formed a settlement on the island at Cambello, which they retained until 1623, when the Dutch destroyed it. Frightful tortures inflicted on its unfortunate inhabitants were connected with its destruction. In 1654, after many fruitless negotiations, Oliver Cromwell compelled the United Provinces to give the sum of 300,000 gulden, as compensation to the descendants of those who suffered in the &quot;Ambon Massacre&quot;, together with Manhattan. In 1673, the poet John Dryden produced his tragedy &quot;Amboyna; or the Cruelties of the Dutch to the English Merchants&quot;. 

Meanwhile, the VOC imposed a monopoly on clove production that was concentrated in Ambon and a few adjacent islands. The Dutch dispositions created great displeasure among local populations. The Muslim state Hitu, in the north of Ambon, was especially recalcitrant, while the southern peninsula Leitimor was largely Christianized and mostly stayed in the European orbit. Moreover, the autonomous governors for the Sultanate of Ternate in Hoamoal in western Seram Island held a generally anti-Dutch stance. All this led to a series of colonial wars during the 17th century. The leader of Hitu, Kakiali, led the resistance from his stronghold Wawani but was murdered by a traitor in 1643, after which Wawani was stormed by the VOC troops and their local allies. A last stand was made by Telukibesi who held out with 300 fighters in the elevated and inaccessible fortification Kapahaha. In July 1646, finally, the VOC troops found a steep track to scale the rock and conquered Kapahaha after a bitter fight. The defeat and death of Telukibesi broke resistance on Ambon Island. However, another conflict involving Hoamoal and several surrounding islands broke out in 1651, known as the Great Ambon War. Although the rebels were assisted by Makassarese auxiliaries, the rebellion was eventually defeated by the VOC commander Arnold Vlaming van Oudshoorn with great loss of life, in 1656. The colonial administration and regulated economy was then conscientiously upheld by the Dutch until European rivals arrived on the scene. Christian Ambonese often served in minor clerical position and as colonial troops in various parts of the Archipelago.

The British, under Admiral Peter Rainier, captured Ambon in 1796, but they restored it to the Dutch at the Peace of Amiens in 1802. They retook the island in 1810 but once more restored it to the Dutch in 1814. Ambon used to be the world center of clove production; until the nineteenth century, the Dutch prohibited the rearing of the clove tree on all the other islands subject to their rule, in order to secure the monopoly to Ambon.

Under the Dutch Empire, Ambon city was the seat of the Dutch resident and military commander of the Moluccas. The town was protected by Fort Victoria, and a 1902 Encyclopædia characterized it as &quot;a clean little town with wide streets, well planted&quot;. The population was divided into two classes: &quot;orang burger&quot; or citizens and &quot;orang negri&quot; or villagers, the former being a class of native origin enjoying certain privileges conferred on their ancestors by the old Dutch East India Company. There were also, besides the Dutch, some Arabs, Chinese and a few Portuguese settlers.

Ambon city was the site of a major Dutch military base that Imperial Japanese forces captured from Allied forces in the World War II Battle of Ambon in 1942. The battle was followed by the summary execution of more than 300 Allied prisoners of war in the Laha massacre.

A large Far East prisoner of war camp was situated in the north near Liang. This was made up of British men of the 77th HAA, 3rd Kings Own Hussars and some RAF volunteers. Approximately 1,000 men arrived in April 1943 and were marched from Ambon town over two days without food or water (see 1000 men of Liang to follow).

The FEPOWs built the camp including a water pipeline. They were ordered to build an airfield and runway alongside the beach and cleared coconut trees for the task. They did all they could to sabotage construction.

Conditions were horrendous and many men died due to disease, starvation and ill treatment by the Japanese. Many men also suffered blindness due to working chipping at the coral.

===Conflicts since independence===
Indonesia won its independence in 1945–49. As a consequence of ethnic and religious tensions, and President Sukarno making Indonesia a unitary state, Ambon was the scene of a revolt against the Indonesian government, resulting in the rebellion of the Republic of South Maluku in 1950.

In April and May 1958 during the Permesta rebellion in North Sulawesi, the USA supported and supplied the rebels. Pilots from a Taiwan-based CIA front organisation, Civil Air Transport, flying CIA B-26 Invader aircraft, repeatedly bombed and machine-gunned targets on Ambon. From 27 April until 18 May there were CIA air raids on Ambon city. Also, on 8 May 1958 CIA pilot Allen Pope bombed and machine-gunned the Indonesian Air Force base at Liang in the northeast of the island, damaging the runway and destroying a Consolidated PBY Catalina. The Indonesian Air Force had only one serviceable fighter aircraft on Ambon Island, a North American P-51 Mustang at Liang. Pope&#x27;s last air raid was on 18 May, when an Indonesian pilot at Liang, Captain Ignatius Dewanto, was scrambled to the P-51. Pope had attacked Ambon city before Dewanto could catch him, but Dewanto intercepted him just as Pope was attacking one of a pair of troop ships in an Indonesian fleet west of Ambon Island. The B-26 was brought down by fire from both Dewanto and shipborne anti-aircraft gunners. Pope and his Indonesian radio operator bailed out and were captured, which immediately exposed the level of CIA support for the Permesta rebellion. Embarrassed, the Eisenhower administration quickly ended CIA support for Permesta and withdrew its agents and remaining aircraft from the conflict.

Between 1999 and 2002, Ambon was at the centre of sectarian conflict across the Maluku Islands. In 2007, Ambon resident Leonard Joni Sinay was sentenced to fifteen years&#x27; imprisonment for treason after he and other activists protested a visit by President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono with a dance and a raising of the banned regional flag; both Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International called for his release, the latter organization designating him a prisoner of conscience.

<text>In mathematics, the Mellin transform is an integral transform that may be regarded as the multiplicative version of the two-sided Laplace transform. This integral transform is closely connected to the theory of Dirichlet series, and is
often used in number theory, mathematical statistics, and the theory of asymptotic expansions; it is closely related to the Laplace transform and the Fourier transform, and the theory of the gamma function and allied special functions.

The Mellin transform of a complex-valued function defined on formula_1 is the function formula_2 of complex variable formula_3 given (where it exists, see Fundamental strip below) by
formula_4
Notice that formula_5 is a Haar measure on the multiplicative group formula_6 and formula_7 is a (in general non-unitary) multiplicative character.
The inverse transform is 
formula_8
The notation implies this is a line integral taken over a vertical line in the complex plane, whose real part &quot;c&quot; need only satisfy a mild lower bound. Conditions under which this inversion is valid are given in the Mellin inversion theorem.

The transform is named after the Finnish mathematician Hjalmar Mellin, who introduced it in a paper published 1897 in &quot;Acta Societatis Scientiarum Fennicæ.&quot;

==Relationship to other transforms==
The two-sided Laplace transform may be defined in terms of the Mellin transform by
formula_9
and conversely we can get the Mellin transform from the two-sided Laplace transform by
formula_10

The Mellin transform may be thought of as integrating using a kernel with respect to the multiplicative Haar measure, formula_11, which is invariant under dilation formula_12, so that formula_13 the two-sided Laplace transform integrates with respect to the additive Haar measure formula_14, which is translation invariant, so that formula_15

We also may define the Fourier transform in terms of the Mellin transform and vice versa; in terms of the Mellin transform and of the two-sided Laplace transform defined above
formula_16
We may also reverse the process and obtain
formula_17

The Mellin transform also connects the Newton series or binomial transform together with the Poisson generating function, by means of the Poisson–Mellin–Newton cycle.

The Mellin transform may also be viewed as the Gelfand transform for the convolution algebra of the locally compact abelian group of positive real numbers with multiplication.

==Examples==

===Cahen–Mellin integral===
The Mellin transform of the function formula_18 is
formula_19
where formula_20 is the gamma function. formula_20 is a meromorphic function with simple poles at formula_22. Therefore, formula_20 is analytic for formula_24. Thus, letting formula_25 and formula_26 on the principal branch, the inverse transform gives
formula_27

This integral is known as the Cahen–Mellin integral.

===Polynomial functions===
Since formula_28 is not convergent for any value of formula_29, the Mellin transform is not defined for polynomial functions defined on the whole positive real axis. However, by defining it to be zero on different sections of the real axis, it is possible to take the Mellin transform. For example, if
formula_30
then
formula_31

Thus formula_32 has a simple pole at formula_33 and is thus defined for formula_34. Similarly, if
formula_35
then
formula_36
Thus formula_32 has a simple pole at formula_38 and is thus defined for formula_39.

===Exponential functions===
For formula_40, let formula_41. Then
formula_42

===Zeta function===
It is possible to use the Mellin transform to produce one of the fundamental formulas for the Riemann zeta function, formula_43. Let formula_44. Then
formula_45
Thus,
formula_46

===Generalized Gaussian===
For formula_47, let formula_48 (i.e. formula_49 is a generalized Gaussian distribution without the scaling factor.) Then
formula_50
In particular, setting formula_51 recovers the following form of the gamma function
formula_52

===Power series and Dirichlet series===

Generally, assuming the necessary convergence, we can connect Dirichlet series and power series
formula_53
by this formal identity involving the Mellin transform:
formula_54

==Fundamental strip==

For formula_55, let the open strip formula_56 be defined to be all formula_57 such that formula_58 with formula_59 The fundamental strip of formula_60 is defined to be the largest open strip on which it is defined. For example, for formula_61 the fundamental strip of
formula_62
is formula_63 As seen by this example, the asymptotics of the function as formula_64 define the left endpoint of its fundamental strip, and the asymptotics of the function as formula_65 define its right endpoint. To summarize using Big O notation, if formula_49 is formula_67 as formula_64 and formula_69 as formula_70 then formula_60 is defined in the strip formula_63

An application of this can be seen in the gamma function, formula_73 Since formula_74 is formula_75 as formula_64 and formula_77 for all formula_78 then formula_79 should be defined in the strip formula_80 which confirms that formula_20 is analytic for formula_82

==Properties==

The properties in this table may be found in and .

===Parseval&#x27;s theorem and Plancherel&#x27;s theorem===

Let formula_83 and formula_84 be functions with well-defined
Mellin transforms formula_85
in the fundamental strips formula_86.
Let formula_87 with formula_88.
If the functions formula_89 and formula_90 
are also square-integrable over the interval formula_91, then Parseval&#x27;s formula holds:

formula_92
The integration on the right hand side is done along the vertical line formula_93 that
lies entirely within the overlap of the (suitable transformed) fundamental strips.

We can replace formula_84 by formula_95. This gives following alternative form of the theorem:
Let formula_83 and formula_84 be functions with well-defined
Mellin transforms formula_85
in the fundamental strips formula_86.
Let formula_87 with formula_101 and
choose formula_102 with formula_103.
If the functions formula_89 and formula_105 
are also square-integrable over the interval formula_91, then we have

formula_107
We can replace formula_84 by formula_109.
This gives following theorem:
Let formula_110 be a function with well-defined Mellin transform formula_111 in the fundamental strip formula_112.
Let formula_87 with formula_114.
If the function formula_115 is also square-integrable over the interval formula_91, then Plancherel&#x27;s theorem holds:
formula_117

== As an isometry on &quot;L&quot;2 spaces ==
In the study of Hilbert spaces, the Mellin transform is often posed in a slightly different way. For functions in formula_118 (see Lp space) the fundamental strip always includes formula_119, so we may define a linear operator formula_120 as
formula_121
formula_122
In other words, we have set
formula_123
This operator is usually denoted by just plain formula_124 and called the &quot;Mellin transform&quot;, but formula_120 is used here to distinguish from the definition used elsewhere in this article. The Mellin inversion theorem then shows that formula_120 is invertible with inverse
formula_127
formula_128
Furthermore, this operator is an isometry, that is to say formula_129 for all formula_130 (this explains why the factor of formula_131 was used).

==In probability theory==
In probability theory, the Mellin transform is an essential tool in studying the distributions of products of random variables. If &quot;X&quot; is a random variable, and } denotes its positive part, while } is its negative part, then the &quot;Mellin transform&quot; of &quot;X&quot; is defined as
formula_132
where &quot;γ&quot; is a formal indeterminate with . This transform exists for all &quot;s&quot; in some complex strip , where .

The Mellin transform formula_133 of a random variable &quot;X&quot; uniquely determines its distribution function &quot;FX&quot;. The importance of the Mellin transform in probability theory lies in the fact that if &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are two independent random variables, then the Mellin transform of their product is equal to the product of the Mellin transforms of &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;:
formula_134

==Problems with Laplacian in cylindrical coordinate system==

In the Laplacian in cylindrical coordinates in a generic dimension (orthogonal coordinates with one angle and one radius, and the remaining lengths) there is always a term:
formula_135

For example, in 2-D polar coordinates the Laplacian is:
formula_136
and in 3-D cylindrical coordinates the Laplacian is,
formula_137

This term can be treated with the Mellin transform, since:
formula_138

For example, the 2-D Laplace equation in polar coordinates is the PDE in two variables:
formula_139
and by multiplication:
formula_140
with a Mellin transform on radius becomes the simple harmonic oscillator:
formula_141
with general solution:
formula_142

Now let&#x27;s impose for example some simple wedge boundary conditions to the original Laplace equation:
formula_143
these are particularly simple for Mellin transform, becoming:
formula_144

These conditions imposed to the solution particularize it to:
formula_145

Now by the convolution theorem for Mellin transform, the solution in the Mellin domain can be inverted:
formula_146
where the following inverse transform relation was employed:
formula_147
where formula_148.

==Applications==
The Mellin transform is widely used in computer science for the analysis of algorithms because of its scale invariance property. The magnitude of the Mellin Transform of a scaled function is identical to the magnitude of the original function for purely imaginary inputs. This scale invariance property is analogous to the Fourier Transform&#x27;s shift invariance property. The magnitude of a Fourier transform of a time-shifted function is identical to the magnitude of the Fourier transform of the original function.

This property is useful in image recognition. An image of an object is easily scaled when the object is moved towards or away from the camera.

In quantum mechanics and especially quantum field theory, Fourier space is enormously useful and used extensively because momentum and position are Fourier transforms of each other (for instance, Feynman diagrams are much more easily computed in momentum space). In 2011, A. Liam Fitzpatrick, Jared Kaplan, João Penedones, Suvrat Raju, and Balt C. van Rees showed that Mellin space serves an analogous role in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence.

==Examples==
* Perron&#x27;s formula describes the inverse Mellin transform applied to a Dirichlet series.
* The Mellin transform is used in analysis of the prime-counting function and occurs in discussions of the Riemann zeta function.
* Inverse Mellin transforms commonly occur in Riesz means.
* The Mellin transform can be used in audio timescale-pitch modification .

<doc id="387307" wikidata="Q1871572" url="?curid=387307" title="Louis Capone">
<text>Louis Capone (September 5, 1896 – March 4, 1944) was a New York organized crime figure who became a supervisor for Murder, Inc. Louis Capone was not related to Al Capone, the boss of the Chicago Outfit. Capone was convicted of murder in 1941, and sentenced to death. He was electrocuted at Sing Sing Prison on March 4, 1944.

==Early life==
Capone was born in Naples, Italy, and moved to New York City with his family as a child, where he grew up in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn. As an adult, Capone moved to Brownsville, Brooklyn.

Capone was described as a suave, well-groomed man who projected sympathy. He had watery blue eyes and a broken nose.

==Mob rackets==
Capone&#x27;s legitimate business was a &quot;pasticceria&quot; (an Italian-style cafe serving coffee and pastries) in Brooklyn. The &quot;pasticceria&quot; became a popular hangout for teenagers, including future street gang leaders Abe Reles and Harry Maione. Capone built up a rapport with the boys by giving them free food. These young men soon became Capone&#x27;s protégés in crime.

Capone had strong connections with the Purple Gang of Detroit, and was operating loansharking operations in both Detroit and New York. He was also involved in labor racketeering with the local Plasterers Union and had close ties with mobster Joe Adonis.

==Murder, Inc.==
With the end of the Castellammarese War in 1931, Reles&#x27; and Maione&#x27;s gangs developed into a network of contract killers that became known as Murder, Inc. Albert Anastasia, a patron of Capone&#x27;s restaurant, persuaded the two gang leaders that they could make a lot of money by working together for the Cosa Nostra. Anastasia would send Cosa Nostra murder contracts to mobster Louis &quot;Lepke&quot; Buchalter, the boss of Murder, Inc. Capone would recruit the individual hitmen from the Reles and Maione gangs. These hitmen were mainly Jewish and Italian-American hoodlums from Brooklyn. By 1934, all the Cosa Nostra families were using Murder, Inc. As time progressed, Capone spent considerable energy mediating disputes between the two gang leaders.

==Murders==
In 1936, Capone participated in the murder of Joseph Rosen. Buchalter had previously ruined Rosen&#x27;s trucking business and was now afraid that Rosen would implicate him in criminal activity. To protect himself, Buchalter ordered Rosen&#x27;s murder. On September 13, 1936, Harry Strauss, Emanuel Weiss and James Ferraco shot Rosen 17 times in his Brooklyn candy store, killing him instantly. Capone identified the victim and worked out a plan for the gunmen. 

In 1939, Capone allegedly participated in the murder of Irving Penn. Buchalter had ordered Capone to plan the murder of Philip Orlovsky, a mobster who was cooperating with the government in an investigation of Buchalter. Capone gave the job of identifying the target to mobster Jacob &quot;Kuppy&quot; Migden. On July 25, 1939, Migden mistakenly identified Penn, a publishing executive, to the alleged hitman Gioacchino &quot;Jack the Dandy&quot; Parisi, who then shot and killed Penn in front of his home in the Bronx.

==Indictments==
In 1940, Reles became a government witness and helped break up Murder, Inc. In jail on a pending 1933 murder charge, Reles gave in to pleas from his wife and agreed to help prosecute Capone and the rest of the organization. In early 1941, as a result of Reles&#x27; assistance, Capone was indicted in the Penn murder. However, Capone never went to trial on these charges.

On November 30, 1941, Capone and the other defendants were convicted of first degree murder in the 1936 Rosen killing. At that time, New York state law mandated the death penalty for this offense. Over the next two and a half years, Capone and his co-defendants filed a series of legal appeals that culminated in a case review by the United States Supreme Court. After their legal appeals were exhausted, the condemned men submitted clemency petitions to the governor of New York, which were all denied.

==Death==
On March 4, 1944, Louis Capone went to the electric chair at Sing Sing Prison in Ossining, New York. Capone had no final words. He was followed in the chair by Weiss and Buchalter.

Capone was buried in Holy Cross Cemetery in Brooklyn.

==In popular culture==
In the 1960 film &quot;Murder, Inc.&quot;, Capone was portrayed by Lou Polan.

<doc id="387308" wikidata="Q1326691" url="?curid=387308" title="Transpersonal psychology">
<text>Transpersonal psychology, or spiritual psychology, is an area of psychology that seeks to integrate the spiritual and transcendent human experiences within the framework of modern psychology.

Evolving from the humanistic psychology movement, transpersonal psychology emerged in the late 1960s, integrating spirituality and consciousness studies into psychological theory, as a response to perceived limitations of mainstream psychological approaches.

The empirical validity and recognition of transpersonal psychology remains contentious in modern psychology. Early critics such as Ernest Hilgard have viewed it as a fringe movement that attracted extreme followers of humanistic psychology, while scholars such as Eugene Taylor have acknowledged the field&#x27;s interdisciplinary approach, at the same time noting its epistemological and practical challenges. The field&#x27;s connections to psychedelic substances, religious ideas, and the new age movement have also further fueled controversy.

Transpersonal psychology has influenced various related and transpersonal disciplines, including transpersonal anthropology, business studies, near-death studies, and parapsychology. The field has a strong institutional presence in California, where the Association for Transpersonal Psychology, Institute of Transpersonal Psychology, and Journal of Transpersonal Psychology were developed.

==History==

=== Origins ===
Early use of the term &quot;transpersonal&quot; can also be credited to Stanislav Grof and Anthony Sutich, who were dissatisfied with the humanistic psychology movement and included spirituality in their new framework. In 1967 to 1968, Abraham Maslow was in close dialogue with both Grof and Sutich regarding the name and orientation of the new field, later describing transpersonal psychology as a &quot;fourth force&quot; in psychology.

According to Powers, the term &quot;transpersonal&quot; starts to show up in academic journals from 1970 onwards. Humanistic and transpersonal psychology are often associated with the Human Potential Movement, a movement in the 1960s that explored various therapies and philosophies at institutions like Esalen in Big Sur, California. Transpersonal psychology was heavily influenced by Western culture, and had not been regarded as a “hard science”.

===Formative period===
Gradually, during the 1960s, the term &quot;transpersonal&quot; became associated with a distinct school of psychology within the humanistic psychology movement. This branch of psychology was introduced to a time where the majority of schools were teaching Freudian Psychology.

In 1969, Maslow, Grof and Sutich were among the initiators behind the publication of the first issue of the &quot;Journal of Transpersonal Psychology&quot;. The Association for Transpersonal Psychology was established in 1972, the International Transpersonal Psychology Association in 1973, and the Institute of Transpersonal Psychology in 1975 . The institute was founded by Robert Frager and James Fadiman in response to an academic climate that they felt was hostile to such ideas.

Soon, other institutions began offering curricula in transpersonal psychology including Saybrook Graduate School, the California Institute of Asian Studies (now California Institute of Integral Studies), JFK University, and Naropa. Other proponents of transpersonal psychology included Ram Dass; Elmer and Alyce Green who were affiliated with the Menninger Foundation; and Ken Wilber.

Transpersonal psychology has been influenced by various Eastern spiritual traditions, such as Buddhism and Hinduism, which emphasize practices like meditation, mindfulness, and the dissolution of the ego. In 1969, Anthony Sutich, along with Maslow and other humanistic psychologists, founded the &quot;Journal of Transpersonal Psychology&quot;, formally establishing the field. The creation of the Association for Transpersonal Psychology in 1972 further solidified its identity. Transpersonal psychology focuses on exploring spiritual experiences, mystical states, self-transcendence, and the holistic development of human potential.

An interest group was later re-formed as the Transpersonal Psychology Interest Group (TPIG), which continued to promote transpersonal issues in collaboration with Division 32. Ken Wilber and Michael Washburn delivered the main transpersonal models of development of this period, Wilber in 1977 and Washburn in 1988. Ken Wilber has since distanced himself from the label &quot;transpersonal&quot;, being in favour of the label of &quot;integral&quot; since the mid-1990s. In 1998 he formed the Integral Institute.

In 1998, the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; reported on the holistic studies program at the &quot;John F. Kennedy University&quot; in Orinda, which included a transpersonal psychology department. The program was considered to be unique at the time, but also controversial. Commentators presented their skepticism towards the program.

===Later developments===

Proponents of transpersonal psychology were behind the proposal for a new diagnostic category to be included in the DSM-manual of the American Psychiatric Association called &quot;Psychoreligious or psychospiritual problem&quot;, which was approved by the Task Force on DSM-IV in 1993, after changing its name to &quot;Religious or spiritual problem&quot;. Concurrently, there was an increase in membership for the &quot;Association for Transpersonal Psychology&quot;, stabilizing at approximately 3000 members in the early nineties. In 1996, the &quot;British Psychological Society&quot; established a Transpersonal Psychology Section.

In 2007 the &quot;Journal of Transpersonal Psychology&quot; and the &quot;International Journal of Transpersonal Studies&quot; were accepted for indexing in PsycINFO, the journal database of the American Psychological Association. That same year, Ruzek, noted that the &quot;American Psychological Association (APA) and most academic institutions have not yet recognized transpersonal psychology as an approved area of study; transpersonal psychology is rarely mentioned in mainstream academic journals or textbooks; and relatively few American academicians identify themselves as practitioners of transpersonal psychology. Furthermore, transpersonal psychology is scarcely mentioned, if at all, in history or introductory psychology texts&quot;.

==Reception, recognition and criticism==

Although transpersonal psychology has received some support from both psychologists and non-psychologists, it remains highly controversial and has not been widely accepted by mainstream academic psychology.

Transpersonal psychology has been criticized for lacking conceptual, evidentiary, and scientific rigor. In a review of criticisms of the field, Paul F Cunningham writes, &quot;philosophers have criticized transpersonal psychology because its metaphysics is naive and epistemology is undeveloped. Multiplicity of definitions and lack of operationalization of many of its concepts has led to a conceptual confusion about the nature of transpersonal psychology itself... Biologists have criticized transpersonal psychology for its lack of attention to biological foundations of behavior and experience. Physicists have criticized transpersonal psychology for inappropriately accommodating physic concepts as explanations of consciousness.&quot;

Albert Ellis, a cognitive and humanistic psychologist, has questioned the results of transpersonal psychotherapy. In 1989, he worked with Raymond Yeager for the release of &quot;Why some therapies don&#x27;t work: The dangers of transpersonal psychology&quot;, where the authors compared the results of transpersonal psychology with the effects of rational-emotive therapy and noted the dangers of the transpersonal approach. Ellis has also questioned the scientific status of transpersonal psychology, and its relationship to religion, mysticism and authoritarian belief systems.

Ernest Hilgard, a psychologist at Stanford University, regarded transpersonal psychology as a fringe movement that attracted the more extreme followers of humanistic psychology.

Eugene Taylor, a humanistic psychologist affiliated with Harvard University, viewed transpersonal psychology as &quot;philosophically naive, poorly financed, at times almost anti-intellectual, and frequently overrated as far as its influences&quot;, while at the same time noting the field&#x27;s &quot;integrated approach to understanding the phenomenology of scientific method&quot;, &quot;centrality of qualitative research&quot;, and its emphasised &quot;importance of interdisciplinary communication&quot;. In a later article, Taylor regarded transpersonal psychology as a visionary American folk-psychology with little historical relation to American academic psychology, except through its association with humanistic psychology and the categories of transcendence and consciousness.

Another contentious aspect concerns the topic of psychedelic substances. Commenting upon the controversial status of psychedelic and entheogenic substances in contemporary culture, Elmer, MacDonald &amp; Friedman observe that these drugs have been used for therapeutic effect in the transpersonal movement, but that it is uncommon in contemporary therapy. Bravo and Grob note that &quot;the place of psychedelics in spiritual practice remains controversial&quot;.

Nicole Amity Ruzek, who interviewed founders of transpersonal psychology, as well as historians of American psychology, found that the field of transpersonal psychology had made little impact on the larger field of psychology in America. Among the factors that contributed to this situation was mainstream psychology&#x27;s &quot;resistance to spiritual and philosophical ideas&quot;, and the tendency of transpersonal psychologists to isolate themselves from the larger field.

One of the earliest criticisms of transpersonal psychology was leveled by the humanistic psychologist Rollo May, who &quot;disputed the conceptual foundations of transpersonal psychology&quot;. May also criticized the field for neglecting the personal dimension of the psyche by elevating the pursuit of the transcendental, and for neglecting the &quot;dark side of human nature&quot;.

==Branches and related fields==
Other transpersonal disciplines, such as transpersonal anthropology and transpersonal business studies, are known as transpersonal disciplines. Other fields of study that are related to transpersonal psychology, include near-death studies and parapsychology.

A few commentators have suggested that there is a difference between transpersonal psychology and a broader category of transpersonal theories, sometimes called transpersonal studies. According to Friedman this category might include several approaches to the transpersonal that lie outside mainstream science. However, according to Ferrer the field of transpersonal psychology is &quot;situated within the wider umbrella of transpersonal studies&quot;.

Transpersonal psychology has also be associated with New Age beliefs and pop psychology. However, leading authors in the field, among those Sovatsky, Rowan, and Hartelius have criticized the nature of &quot;New Age&quot;-philosophy and discourse. Rowan even states that &quot;The Transpersonal is not the New Age&quot;. Other commentators, such as Wade, note that the field remains part of the New Age, despite the fact that transpersonal psychologists may want no such association.

Although some consider that the distinction between transpersonal psychology and the psychology of religion is fading (e.g. The Oxford Handbook of Psychology and Spirituality), there is still generally considered to be a clear distinction between the two. Much of the focus of psychology of religion is concerned with issues that would not be considered &#x27;transcendent&#x27; within transpersonal psychology, so the two disciplines have quite distinct focuses. Transpersonal psychology is more so spiritually focused, as it lacks a hierarchy and seeks an altruistic approach.

==Organizations, publications and locations==
Although the perspective of transpersonal psychology has spread to a number of interest groups across the US and Europe, its origins were in California, and the field has always been strongly associated with institutions on the west coast of the US. Both the Association for Transpersonal Psychology and the forerunner to Sofia University were founded in the state of California, and a number of the fields leading theorists come from this area of the US. A European counterpart to the American institution, the European Transpersonal Psychology Association (ETPA), was founded much later.

Leading publications include the &quot;Journal of Transpersonal Psychology&quot; and the &quot;International Journal of Transpersonal Studies&quot;. Smaller publications include the &quot;Transpersonal Psychology Review&quot;, the journal of the Transpersonal Psychology Section of the British Psychological Society.

<doc id="387315" wikidata="Q393769" url="?curid=387315" title="Tanana River">
<text>The Tanana River (Lower Tanana: Tth&#x27;eetoo&#x27;, Upper Tanana: &quot;Tth’iitu’ Niign&quot;) is a tributary of the Yukon River in the U.S. state of Alaska. According to linguist and anthropologist William Bright, the name is from the Koyukon (Athabaskan) &quot;tene no&quot;, &quot;tenene&quot;, literally &quot;trail river&quot;.

The river&#x27;s headwaters are located at the confluence of the Chisana and Nabesna rivers just north of Northway in eastern Alaska. The Tanana flows in a northwest direction from near the border with the Yukon Territory, and laterally along the northern slope of the Alaska Range, roughly paralleled by the Alaska Highway. In central Alaska, it emerges into a lowland marsh region known as the Tanana Valley and passes south of the city of Fairbanks.

In the marsh regions it is joined by several large tributaries, including the Nenana (near the city of Nenana) and the Kantishna. It passes the village of Manley Hot Springs and empties into the Yukon near the town of Tanana.

Ice on the river accumulates each winter to an average maximum thickness of at Nenana. The Nenana Ice Classic, begun in 1917, is an annual guessing game about the date of the ice break-up. In October or November, after the freeze has begun, a tripod is planted in ice in the middle of the river. The tripod is connected to an on-shore clock that stops when the tripod begins to move during the spring thaw. Over the years, the break-up date has varied from April 20 to May 20. Betting on the exact time of the break-up takes the form of a lottery, called the Nenana Ice Classic.

==History==
Human habitation of the Yukon basin, including the Tanana watershed, began more than 12,000 years ago. Several sites in the watershed have produced evidence of occupation by Paleo-Arctic people. Later residents include people of the Tanana tribe, which has had a presence in the region for 1,200 years.
In the summer of 1885, Lieutenant Henry Tureman Allen of the U.S. Army undertook the first recorded exploration of the Tanana River. In 1883, Lieutenant Frederick Schwatka and his party had entered the Yukon watershed by way of Canada and floated to the mouth of the Yukon. Allen&#x27;s goal was to find an all-Alaska route to the Yukon River. He and his men ascended the Copper River, crossed into Tanana River drainage, and descended the Tanana to the Yukon and down it to the mouth. During the five-month trip, the Allen party mapped the courses of the Copper, Tanana, and Koyukuk rivers.

In the early 21st century, the basin is largely wilderness unchanged by human activity. Fairbanks, a metropolitan area with about 100,000 residents in 2019, is a center of placer gold mining, which has continued in the basin since the mid-19th century. Limited farming also occurs in the valley near Fairbanks.

During World War II, it was proposed to resettle Finnish refugees in areas around the Tanana River (Operation Alaska).

==Nenana Ice Classic==
Since the early 1900s, Alaskans have been gambling on when the river would melt. Each year, thousands pay $3.00 to guess the exact date and minute the Tanana River ice will go out in Nenana. The Nenana Ice Classic is a fundraiser for local charities and has awarded some large prizes. In 2010, after the ice went out on April 29, three lottery winners split a jackpot of $279,030. In 2012, the record prize was $350,000.

<doc id="387316" wikidata="Q727076" url="?curid=387316" title="Nicolas Durand de Villegaignon">
<text>Nicolas Durand, sieur de Villegaignon, also Villegagnon (1510 – 9 January 1571) was a commander of the Knights of Malta, and later a French naval officer (vice-admiral of Brittany) who attempted to help the Huguenots in France escape persecution, before turning against them due to Eucharistic disputes.

A notable public figure in his time, Villegaignon was a mixture of soldier, scientist, explorer, adventurer and entrepreneur. He fought pirates in the Mediterranean and participated in several wars.

Villegagnon was born in Provins, Seine et Marne, France, a nephew of Philippe Villiers de L&#x27;Isle-Adam, Grand Master of the Order of Malta. He was received as a Knight of the Order in 1521.

==Ottoman campaigns in the Mediterranean and in Scotland==
Nicolas de Villegagnon fought in numerous campaigns against the Ottoman Empire. Although the French usually refrained from participating in actions against the Ottomans, due to the Franco-Ottoman alliance, Villegagnon&#x27;s first allegiance was with the Order of Malta, which generally supported the Habsburgs and fought the Ottomans. Villegagnon participated in the ill-fated expedition against Algiers in 1541. He also fought against the Ottomans in Hungary in 1542 following the Siege of Buda (1541) until 1546.

In 1548, he commanded the French naval fleet that took Mary, Queen of Scots, then five years old, to France, since she was promised to marry the Dauphin of France. This was a daring operation, covertly sailing galleys around Scotland, while the English fleet was expecting an attack from the other direction. After setting out from Dumbarton Castle, the French ships were forced by an adverse wind back into the Firth of Clyde, and anchored at the &quot;road of Lamlash&quot;, beside the Holy Island, before making a successful voyage to Roscoff.

Back in Scotland in March 1549, in February he helped capture Ferniehirst Castle from the English. The commanders then discussed their next move. Nicolas insisted they should halt and build a fortification at Roxburgh and decided the best position. The Scottish high command held a vote which was inconclusive, but finally, after the intervention of the French ambassador Henri Cleutin, Nicolas&#x27;s plan was adopted.

Commanding the Knights in Mdina, Villegagnon helped repel the Ottomans at Malta in 1551 before they went on to lead the Invasion of Gozo (1551).
He was then present at the Siege of Tripoli (1551) against the Ottoman Empire, and wrote an account about it in 1553. Villegagnon illustrated himself by courageously defending Gaspard de Vallier, the vanquished Commander of Tripoli, who was being heavily criticized by the Grand Master d&#x27;Homedes who wished to assign all the blame for the defeat on him. Nicolas de Villegagnon staunchly defended him and exposed the duplicity of d&#x27;Homedes.

==France Antarctique==

Villegaignon became an important historical figure in the attempt for king Henry II to build a &quot;France Antarctique&quot;, by invading present-day Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 1555 with a fleet of two ships and 600 soldiers and colonists, mainly French Huguenots and Swiss Calvinists who sought to escape Catholic persecution in Europe. A disagreement over Eucharistic theology soon caused Villegagnon and the Calvinists to quarrel. Villegagnon eventually expelled those who held to Calvin&#x27;s view of the Eucharist from his fortified island.

Villegagnon&#x27;s initial plan was to help the Huguenots establish a colony in the New World. He wanted also to secure a permanent base in Brazil in order to exploit brazil wood, then a very valuable source of red dye and hardwood for construction (which gave the name to what was to become Brazil), and to explore precious metals and stones, which the Europeans believed to exist in abundance in the land.

After a number of battles against the Portuguese, the French colonists were defeated by Estácio de Sá, a nephew of the third Portuguese Governor-General of Brazil, Mem de Sá, on 15–16 March 1558.

==Return to France==
Villegaignon had already returned to France, in 1559, disgusted with the infighting between Catholics and Protestants in the small colony. He had left the colony under the command of his nephew , endeavouring to obtain more funds and ships for the colony. The internal fight against the Calvinists however made colonial adventures less of a priority for the Crown. After the colony fell to the Portuguese, Villegagnon finally agreed to give up his claims to France Antarctique after receiving 30,000 écus from the Portuguese Crown.

===Fight against the Protestants===
In 1560, Villegagnon challenged Calvin to a theological debate on the eucharist, which the latter declined. He became actively involved against the Protestants, and participated in the repression of the Amboise conspiracy.
In 1561, Pierre Richier published a pamphlet against Villegagnon&#x27;s actions in Brazil, entitled &quot;Réfutation des folles resveries, excecrable blasphèmes, erreurs et mensonges de Nicolas Durand, qui se nomme Villagagnon&quot; [Refutation of the foolish imaginations, terrible blasphemies, errors and lies of Nicolas Durand, named Villagagnon].

New attempts were made to create a Huguenot colony in the New World, again at the instigation of Coligny, this time in French Florida from 1562 to 1565, under Jean Ribault and René de Laudonnière.

From 1568, Villegagnon became the representative of the Order of Malta at the French Court. The next year, in 1569, he published in Paris a new controversy about the eucharist, entitled &quot;De Consecratione, mystico sacrificio et duplici Christi oblatione&quot;.

Villegagnon became Commander of the Order of Malta Commandery in Beauvais, where he died on 9 January 1571, aged about 60.

The Catholic André Thévet, who had accompanied him on the first trip to Brazil, published in 1572 a description of the Brazil adventure and an attack on the Protestants, in his &quot;Cosmographie Universelle&quot;. The Protestant Jean Léry would respond to it in 1578 with his &quot;Histoire d&#x27;un voyage faict en la terre du Brésil&quot;.

==Legacy==

In his book, &quot;Brazil, A Land of the Future&quot;, Austrian writer Stefan Zweig describes the colorful character of Villegaignon:

On 2012 French-Portuguese-Brazilian TV series &quot;Rouge Brésil&quot;/&quot;Vermelho Brasil&quot; (Red Brazil), on the history of France Antarctique, Villegaignon (spelled Villegagnon) is portrayed by Swedish actor Stellan Skarsgård.

The island in Rio de Janeiro where he resided still bears his name Villegagnon Island.

A street in the Maltese city of Mdina is named after Villegaignon.

He appears as an important supporting character in &quot;The Course of Fortune&quot; by Tony Rothman (J. Boylston, 2015), a novel that concerns the events leading to the Great Siege of Malta, 1565.

He is a supporting character in Dorothy Dunnett&#x27;s novel &quot;The Disorderly Knights&quot;, the third volume of her Lymond Chronicles series.

The knight is featured in &quot;Eight Pointed Cross&quot; by Marthese Fenech (BDL 2011), a historical novel, the first of a trilogy, now completed, that culminates in the Great Siege of Malta, 1565.

<text>The Susitna River (; ; ) is a long river in the Southcentral Alaska. It is the 15th largest river in the United States, ranked by average discharge volume at its mouth. The river stretches from the Susitna Glacier to Cook Inlet&#x27;s Knik Arm.

== Etymology and history ==
The Susitna River was named by the Dena&#x27;ina Alaska Native people meaning &quot;sandy river&quot; (). The river appears to have been first explored by outsiders in 1834 by a &quot;Creole [Indian] named Malakov&quot; and the name may have been obtained by the Russians at that time, recorded by the Russia Hydrography Department on chart 1378 dated 1847 as () &quot;Sushitna River&quot;. The present spelling of the name has evolved due to euphemistic reasons. The 1890 census reported that Susitna Village on the east bank of the river had 146 Kenai Natives and 27 houses.

==Description==
The Susitna River heads at Susitna Glacier, in Alaska Range, flows southwest to Cook Inlet, west of Anchorage, Alaska Cook Inlet Low.

There are several rivers flowing into the Susitna River including East Fork &quot;Susitna River&quot; and West Fork &quot;Susitna River&quot;. The Little Susitna River is a separate river system which flows into the Cook Inlet on the other side of Susitna Flats.

The Susitna along with the Matanuska River, drains the broad Matanuska-Susitna Valley south of the Alaska Range.

It rises in the Susitna Glacier on Mount Hayes in the Alaska Range near . It flows in winding course generally southwest to Curry, then south, along the west side of the Talkeetna Mountains, past Talkeetna, Chulitna River, and Susitna, and drains into Cook Inlet approximately 25 miles (40 km) west of Anchorage. 

It receives the Yentna River from the northwest approximately 5 miles (8 km) north of Susitna. It is navigable to 85 mile (137 km) upstream from its mouth to Talkeetna. Valdez Creek, notable for its 1903 gold mining, is one of the small headwater tributaries of Susitna River.

The Susitna River is one of Southcentral Alaska&#x27;s premier sport fishing streams, with significant runs of Chinook and Coho salmon, along with resident grayling, burbot, and rainbow trout. Located within a roadless area, access to the river is difficult and is made usually by power boat or by floatplane. 

Matanuska-Susitna Borough owns much of the land along the Susitna and Deshka Rivers. The impacts of summer recreational use and tourists have caused loss of riparian vegetation and bank erosion along the Deshka River&#x27;s lower reaches, which has been partially remedied through a restoration project in the summer of 2002. However, the borough currently lacks either regulations to prevent further damage or the means to enforce such regulations.
==Geology==
The Susitna Basin, is located about 50 miles from Anchorage. As of a 2018 USGS assessment, it probably contains technically recoverable oil and gas resources using current technology—in rocks of Tertiary age (about 66 to 2.6 million years old)

==Location==
Susitna River is on the North side of Cook Inlet North-East of North Foreland. Mount Susitna, a prominent landmark along the upper part of the inlet, is about West of the Susitna River at a point above the mouth.

The channels across the flats at the mouth of Susitna River have depths of or less at low water and change during the winter and spring because of ice and freshet action. The channels above the mouth are said to change frequently in the spring and early summer.

Launches navigate Susitna River to Yentna River, about above Cook Inlet, thence run occasionally up the Yentna River to the forks about from the Susitna River. The tides are not felt more than from the inlet, and above this the current is swift. Overhead power cables with a least clearance of cross the Susitna River about above its mouth.

Alexander, Alaska is a small settlement on the west side of Susitna River above the mouth. Susitna, Alaska is on the East side above the mouth and just below the mouth of the Yentna River; launches run to and from Anchorage, Alaska. Mail is delivered to both settlements twice monthly by airplane from Anchorage, Alaska.

Susitna Flats lie between big Susitna River and Little Susitna River and to the East of the latter.

Susitna Flats Light (), above the water, is shown from a skeleton tower and is equipped with a racon.

Little Susitna River, West of Point MacKenzie, is said to be navigable for landing craft and skiffs at high water for about .

The depths offshore and in the approach to Little Susitna River are subject to drastic and continual change.

==Bridges==
The Susitna River Bridge is a railroad bridge of the Alaska Railroad in south-central Alaska. It spans the Susitna River on the eastern edge of Denali State Park near Gold Creek. The bridge is on the National Register of Historic Places.

Construction of the bridge took place from October 1920 to February 1921. The span is 503 ft., with a height of 71 ft. in the center; the steel weighs 2,000 tons, and rests on two concrete piers, each 50 ft. high and 70 x 40 ft. in cross-section, and each containing 1,500 cubic yards of concrete. The location was chosen, just downstream of a curve, after observing the pattern of ice jams through the preceding three years.

It is bridged by the George Parks Highway south of Talkeetna. South of that point, there are no other bridges, which contributes to the isolation of southwest Alaska.

==Ice==
Between approximately October 19 and November 14 the Susitna River ices or freezes over for the winter.
 Between April 12 and May 10 the ice breaks-up for the summer.

<doc id="387321" wikidata="Q7843509" url="?curid=387321" title="Triple fault">
<text>On the x86 computer architecture, a triple fault is a special kind of exception generated by the CPU when an exception occurs while the CPU is trying to invoke the double fault exception handler, which itself handles exceptions occurring while trying to invoke a regular exception handler.

x86 processors beginning with the 80286 will cause a shutdown cycle to occur when a triple fault is encountered. This typically causes the motherboard hardware to initiate a CPU reset, which, in turn, causes the whole computer to reboot.

==Possible causes of triple faults==
Triple faults indicate a problem with the operating system kernel or device drivers. In modern operating systems, a triple fault is typically caused by a buffer overflow or underflow in a device driver which writes over the interrupt descriptor table (IDT). If the IDT is corrupted, when the next interrupt happens, the processor will be unable to call either the needed interrupt handler or the double fault handler because the descriptors in the IDT are corrupted.

==Virtual machines==

In QEMU, a triple fault produces a dump of the virtual machine in the console, with the instruction pointer set to the instruction that triggered the first exception.

In VirtualBox, a triple fault causes a Guru Meditation error to be displayed to the user. A virtual machine in this state has most features disabled and cannot be restarted. If the VirtualBox Debugger is open, a message is printed indicating a Triple fault has occurred, followed by a register dump and disassembly of the last instruction executed, similar to the output of the codice_1 debugger command.

When using Intel VT-x, a triple fault causes a VM exit, with exit reason 2. The exit reason is saved to the VMCS and may be handled by the VMM software.

In VMware, an error message will be displayed and the virtual machine will need to be reset.

==Other uses==
The Intel 80286 processor was the first x86 processor to introduce the now-ubiquitous protected mode. However, the 286 could not revert to the basic 8086-compatible &quot;real mode&quot; without resetting the processor, which can only be done using hardware external to the CPU. On the IBM AT and compatibles, the documented method of doing this was to use a special function on the Intel 8042 keyboard controller, which would assert the RESET pin of the processor. However, intentionally triple-faulting the CPU was found to cause the transition to occur much faster (0.8 milliseconds instead of 15+ milliseconds) and more cleanly, permitting multitasking operating systems to switch back and forth at high speed.

Some operating system kernels, such as Linux, still use triple faults as a last effort in their rebooting process if an ACPI reboot fails. This is done by setting the IDT register to 0 and then issuing an interrupt. Since the table now has length 0, all attempts to access it fail and the processor generates a triple fault.

<doc id="387325" wikidata="Q7514991" url="?curid=387325" title="Silicon Valley Football Classic">
<text>The Silicon Valley Football Classic, sometimes referred to as the Silicon Valley Bowl or Silicon Valley Classic, was an NCAA-certified Division I-A post-season college football bowl game that was played at Spartan Stadium on the South Campus of San Jose State University in San Jose, California, from 2000 to 2004. It had a contractual tie-in with the Western Athletic Conference and the Pac-10. The bowl was initially televised on Fox Sports Net and later moved to ESPN2.

The bowl game consistently struggled financially, due to low television ratings and a lack of corporate sponsorship. Declining attendance contributed to the NCAA de-certifying the bowl after the 2004 season.

==History==
===Creation===
The city of San Jose, San Jose State University President Robert Caret, and the Western Athletic Conference proposed the Silicon Valley Bowl for San Jose in 1999. Caret and other organizers envisioned that with the technology boom of the time, revenue from the bowl game and sponsorships from local technology companies would help fund a $25 million expansion of Spartan Stadium, when then had a capacity around 31,000, to 50,000 seats. 

The NCAA approved the bowl game on April 29, 1999. Participating schools would each receive a $1.2 million guaranteed payout. Due to Spartan Stadium having fewer than 50,000 seats, there was no requirement for schools to purchase a minimum number of tickets. Companies expressing written commitments to sponsor the bowl game included Cisco Systems, Comerica Bank, Hewlett-Packard, and Knight Ridder.

===2000===

The inaugural Silicon Valley Bowl on December 31, 2000 was a 37–34 win for Mountain West Conference team Air Force over Fresno State of the WAC. Fresno State trailed 34–7 at halftime before going on a 24–3 run in the second half. But with 14 seconds left, Fresno State failed on a fake field goal attempt from the Air Force 16.

Attendance was 26,542, and pop group Destiny&#x27;s Child performed in the halftime show. However, the bowl lacked a corporate sponsor.

===2001===

With the bowl game still lacking a corporate sponsor, the San Jose City Council approved $150,000 in funding for the bowl&#x27;s nonprofit organization in June 2001.

The 2001 Silicon Valley Football Classic, again played on December 31, had Michigan State of the Big Ten Conference upset no. 20 (AP) Fresno State 44–35. The game was a near sellout, with 30,456 in attendance. The game featured future NFL players including Fresno State quarterback David Carr, Michigan State quarterback Jeff Smoker, Michigan State wide receiver Charles Rogers, Michigan State running back TJ Duckett, and Fresno State wide receiver Bernard Berrian. In the 2002 NFL draft, Carr would be the first overall pick and Duckett the 18th overall.

A report in the December 23 &quot;San Jose Mercury News&quot; claimed that Silicon Valley Football Classic organizers overstated the economic value the bowl game brought to the city. Additionally, Air Force and Michigan State reported that they lost money participating in the Silicon Valley Classic. Eventually in March 2002, the San Jose Convention and Visitors Bureau estimated that the game contributed to $9.2 million in economic activity, including over 7,500 hotel rooms booked, in San Jose.

===2002===

After two straight years of the Silicon Valley Football Classic having the lowest ratings of Division I-A bowl games, Fox Sports Net withdrew from its five-year contract with the bowl in November 2002. This followed continued financial problems for the Silicon Valley Football Classic, namely the third straight year lacking a title sponsor and two companies that funded the 2000 and 2001 games, Knight Ridder and Palm Inc., deciding not to return. The bowl organization rejected a bid by TicketCity for naming rights to the bowl game, citing an unacceptably low payout.

The third edition of the Silicon Valley Football Classic on December 31, 2002 had a second straight appearance by Fresno State of the WAC, this time a 30–21 win vs. ACC opponent Georgia Tech. Attendance was 10,132 in rainy weather.

===2003===

On top of the drop in attendance for the 2002 Silicon Valley Football Classic, the continuation of this bowl became doubtful after the WAC board of directors voted unanimously in March 2003 to defund the bowl game. Eventually, the bowl would be re-certified by the NCAA in 2003 and hire a new chairperson in San Jose Sharks president Greg Jamison, whose Silicon Valley Sports and Entertainment company would help with marketing and sponsorships.

With 20,126 in attendance, the 2003 Silicon Valley Football Classic played on December 30 was a 17–9 Fresno State win over Pac-10 opponent UCLA in Fresno State&#x27;s third straight appearance. After the 2003 game, the NCAA instituted new rules for the 2004–05 Bowl Season stating that stadiums had to draw at least 70% of their capacity for bowl games in order to continue hosting them.

===2004===

The 2004 game was the final edition of the Silicon Valley Football Classic. Although the bowl again had tie-ins with the WAC and Pac-10, neither conference had enough eligible teams available. Silicon Valley Bowl officials invited Northern Illinois of the MAC and Troy of the Sun Belt as at-large teams. Both schools were offered no upfront payment to participate and were responsible for buying 8,000 tickets worth a total of $720,000.

Game attendance was a series low at 5,494, and a power outage caused a 20-minute delay of kickoff. The city of San Jose and Hewlett-Packard each paid $100,000 to be named as primary bowl sponsors, and the WAC made a $300,000 commitment as well. The Classic also spent very little money on advertising. Despite the low attendance numbers, it was estimated the bowl netted a $200,000 profit in 2004.

On April 20, 2005, the NCAA decided not to renew the license of the Silicon Valley Football Classic, due to low attendance and a limit of 28 bowl games. The SVFC was replaced by the Poinsettia Bowl in San Diego, California.

==Game results==
Rankings are based on the AP Poll prior to the game being played.
Note: The 2004 game featured a MAC vs. Sun Belt matchup- neither the Pac 10 or WAC was able to send a team.

Administratively, it is a part of Chuandao (), Taishan. Located from the mainland, it became the largest island in Guangdong after Hainan Island (the largest island in the country) was carved out of the province in 1988.

The area of the island is , and has a population of 16,320.

It is known for having been the place of death of St. Francis Xavier. Nowadays, it is a tourist site in Guangdong.
==History==
The island was called Shangchuan Shan () in the Ming dynasty, as recorded in the &quot;Records of the Unity of the Great Ming&quot; () published in 1461.

Shangchuan Island was one of the first bases established by the Portuguese off the China coast, during the 16th century. They abandoned this base after the Chinese government gave consent for a permanent and official Portuguese trade base at Macau in 1557.

The Spanish (Navarrese) Jesuit missionary St. Francis Xavier died on the island on December 3, 1552, as he was waiting for a ship to take him to mainland China.
There is a small chapel that commemorates his death place, designed by Achille-Antoine Hermitte and completed in 1869.

==Geography==

The island has been isolated from the mainland since the last ice age. It is located near Xiachuan Island, which lies west of Shangchuan. The two islands, together with smaller islets, form Chuanshan Archipelago.

Shangshuan Island has an area of 137.3 km2 and a 217 km coastline.

Settlements on the island include:
* Dalangwan
* Shadi (), a fishing port on the southwestern coast

==Climate==

==Economy==

Shangchuan and Xiachuan have been established as a Tourism Open Integrated Experimental Zone (旅游开发综合试验区, pinyin: &quot;lǚyóu kāifā zōnghé shìyàn qū&quot;).

Feisha Beach Resort () is a commercial tourist resort located on the island&#x27;s eastern shore.

==Transportation==

Shangchuan Island is linked by ferry to Guanghai, Haiyan (Shanju) and Xiachuan Island.

<text>Alexandre de Prouville de Tracy (; – 1670) was a French military leader, statesman, and the seigneur of Tracy-le-Val and Tracy-le-Mont in Picardy, France. A professional soldier, he was a regimental commander during the Thirty Years Wars, and was later appointed commissary general of French forces in Germany. In 1663, he was commissioned lieutenant-général of the French colonies in the Americas. In 1664, he led an expedition that expelled the Dutch from Guiana. The following year he sailed to New France where, in 1666, he led the Carignan-Salieres Regiment and &quot;Canadien&quot; volunteers in an invasion of the Mohawk homeland. He returned to France after reaching peace settlements with the Mohawk and the other Iroquois nations, and was appointed commandant at Dunkirk, and later governor of the &quot;Château Trompette&quot; in Bordeaux.

==Early life==

Alexandre de Prouville de Tracy, the son of Pierre de Prouville, bailiff of the citadel of Amiens, and Marie Bochart de Champigny, was born in Amiens . He married Marie de Belin in Paris on 17 November 1624. Tracy had had a son, Charles-Henri, who died at Landrecies in 1655 during the Franco-Spanish War, and a daughter, Marie Chrisante. Tracy married his second wife, Louise de Fouilleuse, on 15 April 1657 at Saint-Eustache in Paris.

Tracy was a professional soldier who was recorded as a captain of light horse in 1632. After the French intervened in the Thirty Years War, he served as a regimental commander and fought in several battles including the Battle of Wolfenbüttel, the Battle of Kempen, the Battle of Freiburg, the Siege of Philippsburg, and the Battle of Nordlingen. He was appointed commissary general of the French army in Germany, and represented France in negotiations with Sweden and the Elector of Bavaria that led to the 1647 Truce of Ulm.

==Lieutenant Général of the Americas==

For many years the small French settlements on the north shore of the St. Lawrence River had been the subject of attacks by the Iroquois. By the early 1660s, the colony was on the verge of collapse. After receiving numerous pleas for help, Louis XIV took several steps to ensure the survival of New France, including sending professional soldiers.

In November 1663, Tracy was commissioned by Louis XIV as &quot;lieutenant général throughout the length and breadth of the continental countries under our authority situated in South and North America.&quot; He was assigned two tasks: remove the Dutch from Cayenne (a former French colony in Guiana), and end the threat of the Iroquois to New France. The Carignan-Salières Regiment, commanded by Henri de Chastelard de Salières, was assigned to Tracy and would sail directly to Quebec while the lieutenant général was in the West Indies.

Tracy sailed from La Rochelle in February 1664 accompanied by Antoine Lefèbvre de La Barre, four companies of infantry from the Broglie, Chambellé, Orléans and Poitou regiments, and 650 settlers for the French colonies in the West Indies. Tracy&#x27;s expedition captured Cayenne without opposition in May 1664. Leaving Le Barre and a garrison at Cayenne, Tracy sailed to Martinique where he reappointed the governor, then proceeded to Guadeloupe where a new governor was installed.

In April 1665, Tracy left Guadeloupe for the Gulf of St. Lawrence. After anchoring off Percé, Tracy and the soldiers that had accompanied him to the West Indies transferred to smaller ships and disembarked at Quebec on 30 June, 11 days after the first four companies of the Carignan-Salières had arrived from France. To avoid overcrowding in Quebec, Tracy sent the Carignan-Salières companies to build three forts along the Richelieu River, the main route used by the Mohawk in their raids on French settlements. Fort Richelieu was restored and Fort Sainte Anne was erected the following spring on Isle La Motte at the northern end of Lake Champlain. Salières and eight more companies of the Carignan-Salières landed at Quebec in mid-August. The newly appointed Governor General of New France, Daniel de Rémy de Courcelle, and the newly appointed intendant, Jean Talon, arrived with the final contingent of eight companies in mid-September.

Tracy quickly recognized that of the five Iroquois nations, the Mohawk were the most aggressive towards the French. For many years the Mohawk had raided French settlements, and had disrupted the flow of beaver pelts to Montreal by blockading the Ottawa and St. Lawrence Rivers. While the Onondaga, Oneida, Seneca, and Cayuga appeared willing to discuss peace, the Mohawk did not. In December 1665 an Onondaga and Oneida delegation arrived at Quebec to begin negotiations on behalf of themselves and the Seneca and Cayuga.

Tracy authorized Courcelle to lead an expedition of 500 regulars and &quot;Canadien&quot; volunteers against the Mohawk in the winter of 1666. The French soldiers, however, were ill-equipped to operate in the cold and deep snow. They were unaccustomed to using snowshoes, and many suffered from exhaustion, frostbite or hypothermia. Algonquin guides were to meet the expedition at Fort St. Louis, however, after waiting several weeks, Courcelle set off without them. Without guides the expedition frequently lost their way, and provisions soon became scarce. The expedition eventually reached the Anglo-Dutch settlement of Schenectady where Courcelle was able to purchase supplies. While at Schenectady a French patrol skirmished with the Mohawk resulting in the deaths of one officer, five soldiers and one volunteer. Courcelle decided to abandon the invasion and return to the Richelieu River forts. The Jesuit Relations record that over 60 men died from hunger during the expedition, while Captain Francois de Tapie de Monteil of the Poitou Regiment wrote in his journal that &quot;we lost 400 men who dropped dead from cold.&quot;

A Seneca delegation arrived at Quebec in May and quickly negotiated a treaty of friendship. An Oneida delegation followed in July and within a week had agreed to a similar treaty. Later that month, however, news arrived that a hunting party on Ile La Motte had been ambushed by the Mohawk. Seven soldiers were killed and four others taken captive including Tracy&#x27;s cousin, Lieutenant Louis de Canchy de Lerole. Tracy ordered the Oneida delegation brought back to Quebec and imprisoned. Captain Pierre de Saurel of the Carignan-Salières was tasked with leading 200 men in a retaliatory strike against the Mohawk. The expedition was within two days march of Mohawk territory when they encountered a delegation led by the warrior known as the Flemish Bastard who was bringing the unharmed French prisoners back to Fort Sainte Anne. The expedition turned back and Saurel escorted the Mohawk delegation to Quebec.

Delegations from all five Iroquois nations were in Quebec by late August. Tracy, however, had grown impatient with their lengthy harangues and prevarication. Talon and Courcelle agreed with Tracy that a military solution was needed. 600 French soldiers, 600 &quot;Canadien&quot; volunteers, and 100 Algonquin and Wendat warriors rendezvoused at Fort Sainte Anne at the end of September. The expedition crossed Lake Champlain and Lake George in canoes and bateaux, then marched overland to reach the Mohawk villages in mid-October. All four villages had been hastily abandoned. Tracy ordered the longhouses and surrounding fields burned, then led the expedition back to Fort Sainte Anne. Despite not having engaged the Mohawk in battle, the expedition was considered a success. The only casualties were eight men who drowned when their canoes overturned on Lake Champlain during a storm.

Upon his return to Quebec, Tracy had a Mohawk prisoner hanged and sent the Flemish Bastard and two Oneida back to their people with his terms for peace. The Mohawk were given four months to release their Algonquin and Wendat captives and bring Mohawk and Oneida families to Quebec to serve as hostages. When the Flemish Bastard returned in April 1667 without any hostage families, Tracy threatened another invasion. A peace settlement was finally reached in July when several hostage families arrived at Quebec, and requested Jesuit missionaries be sent to the Mohawk and Oneida homelands.

==Return to France==

In August 1667, Tracy returned to France leaving Courcelle, Talon, and the Sovereign Council to govern New France. Without the threat of Iroquois raids the colony entered a period of growth and prosperity that lasted until 1684.

Marie de l&#x27;Incarnation wrote that Tracy had &quot;won over everyone by his good works and by the great examples of virtue and religion which he has given the whole country.&quot; Tracy sponsored the education of indigenous children, paid for a chapel to be built for the Ursulines, and made a substantial donation to the Jesuits for their chapel. He reorganized the Sovereign Council, and sent the governor of Montreal, Paul de Chomedey, Sieur de Maisonneuve back to France on indefinite leave, replacing him with Zacharie Dupuy. When Tracy returned to France, Intendant Jean Talon wrote that &quot;he has set the affairs of Canada in such good order that I shall have little to do there.&quot;

Tracy was named commandant of Dunkirk shortly after his return, and in October 1668 was appointed governor of the Château Trompette in Bordeaux. He died in Paris in the parish of Saint-Eustache on 28 April 1670.

==Legacy==

Tracy, a city on the south shore of the St Lawrence River at the mouth of the Richelieu River was incorporated in 1952 but merged with the much older City of Sorel in 2000 to form Sorel-Tracy. The Tracy Squadron of cadets at the Royal Military College Saint-Jean is named after Tracy. Some 17th-century Jesuit missionaries referred to Lake Superior as &quot;Lac Tracy&quot; after Alexandre de Prouville de Tracy.

<text>Delicate Sound of Thunder is a live album by the English band Pink Floyd. It was recorded over five nights at the Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, New York, in August 1988, during their A Momentary Lapse of Reason Tour, and mixed at Abbey Road Studios in September 1988. It was released on 21 November 1988, through EMI Records in the UK and Columbia Records in the United States.

The album was remixed, restored and reissued in December 2019 for &quot;The Later Years 1987–2019&quot; box set. This version included songs that were not present on the original release. In November 2020, it was given a standalone release.

==Release and reissue==
The album was released in 1988 as a double LP, double cassette, and a double CD, each format containing a slightly different track listing. The album includes many works from &quot;A Momentary Lapse of Reason&quot; as well as tracks from older Pink Floyd albums. The double LP release did not have &quot;Us and Them&quot; on the track listing. Both the double LP and the double cassette had &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; between &quot;Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2)&quot; and &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;.

Although David Gilmour stated around the time of its release and on a radio interview in 1992 that the album contained no studio overdubbing whatsoever, he embellished the tracks during mixing with some extra acoustic guitar on &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;, according to engineer Buford Jones. In addition, some harmonies were replaced by studio re-takes: Richard Wright re-did his vocal on &quot;Time&quot; and Sam Brown replaced Rachel Fury&#x27;s part in &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; but the rest of the album is as performed at the shows.

Along with &quot;A Collection of Great Dance Songs&quot;, &quot;Delicate Sound of Thunder&quot; was reissued on 180g heavyweight vinyl LP in November 2017. Its artwork replicates that of the original 1988 LP release.

An expanded version of the live album was included in &quot;The Later Years 1987–2019&quot; box set in 2019. Previously unreleased tracks include &quot;Signs of Life,&quot; &quot;A New Machine (Part 1)&quot;, &quot;Terminal Frost&quot;, &quot;A New Machine (Part 2)&quot;, &quot;Welcome to the Machine&quot;, and &quot;One Slip&quot;. All tracks were remixed for the 2019 reissue.

==Commercial performance and reception==
&quot;Delicate Sound of Thunder&quot; reached #11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It was certified gold and platinum on 23 January 1989 and triple platinum in April 1997. In Canada, it was #57 in the 1989 year-end chart.

In December 2020, the album reentered the Billboard album chart at #76, thanks to sales of the deluxe reissue.

&quot;Musician&quot; reviewer J. D. Considine wrote simply: &quot;Further proof that you can&#x27;t listen to a light show.&quot;

&quot;Delicate Sound of Thunder&quot; became the first album to be played in space, when Soviet cosmonauts took it aboard Soyuz TM-7. David Gilmour and Nick Mason attended the mission&#x27;s launch.

==2019 reissue==

&quot;Delicate Sound of Thunder&quot; was reissued on CD on 13 December 2019 as part of the box set &quot;The Later Years 1987–2019&quot; along with the film of the same name. The album has been remixed and remastered and includes tracks omitted from the original 1988 release. A standalone release was released on 20 November 2020 on 2 CD, triple LP, and CD/DVD/BD box set which includes the 2019 cut of the film.

In the 2019 remix, the songs &quot;Sorrow&quot;, &quot;On the Turning Away&quot; and &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; have longer guitar solos by Gilmour than in the 1988 original; &quot;The Dogs of War&quot; has a longer intro; &quot;Money&quot; has been condensed, removing Guy Pratt&#x27;s bass solo and the female &quot;a cappella&quot; section; &quot;Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2)&quot; has extra elements (lifted from 1989 tour recordings) added in - most notably an extra &quot;hey teacher!&quot; between Gilmour&#x27;s and Renwick&#x27;s guitar solos; &quot;Us and Them&quot; has a piano added to the intro; much of the echo has been removed from Wallis&#x27; electronic drums during &quot;Learning to Fly&quot;; &quot;Run Like Hell&quot; has an extended intro and now includes Gilmour thanking the audience; and &quot;Time&quot; guitar&#x27;s intro starts sooner within the &quot;tic-tac&quot; (as performed on Pulse) than the 1988 original.

&quot;Learning to Fly&quot;, &quot;Us and Them&quot;, and &quot;Run Like Hell&quot; from the 2019 remix are also included in the 2019 compilation album &quot;The Later Years 1987–2019 Highlights&quot;, released on 29 November 2019.

<doc id="387369" wikidata="Q55826" url="?curid=387369" title="Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum">
<text>The Paleocene–Eocene thermal maximum (PETM), alternatively ”Eocene thermal maximum 1 (ETM1)“ and formerly known as the &quot;Initial Eocene&quot; or “Late Paleocene thermal maximum&quot;, was a geologically brief time interval characterized by a 5–8 °C global average temperature rise and massive input of carbon into the ocean and atmosphere. The event began, now formally codified, at the precise time boundary between the Paleocene and Eocene geological epochs. The exact age and duration of the PETM remain uncertain, but it occurred around 55.8 million years ago (Ma) and lasted about 200 thousand years (Ka). 

The PETM arguably represents our best past analogue for which to understand how global warming and the carbon cycle operate in a greenhouse world. The time interval is marked by a prominent negative excursion in carbon stable isotope () records from around the globe; more specifically, a large decrease in the 13C/12C ratio of marine and terrestrial carbonates and organic carbon has been found and correlated across hundreds of locations. The magnitude and timing of the PETM () excursion, which attest to the massive past carbon release to our ocean and atmosphere, and the source of this carbon remain topics of considerable current geoscience research.

What has become clear over the last few decades: Stratigraphic sections across the PETM reveal numerous changes beyond warming and carbon emission. Consistent with an Epoch boundary, Fossil records of many organisms show major turnovers. In the marine realm, a mass extinction of benthic foraminifera, a global expansion of subtropical dinoflagellates, and an appearance of excursion taxa, including within planktic foraminifera planktic foraminifera and calcareous nannofossils, all occurred during the beginning stages of the PETM. On land, many modern mammal orders (including primates) suddenly appear in Europe and in North America.

==Setting==
The configuration of oceans and continents was somewhat different during the early Paleogene relative to the present day. The Panama Isthmus did not yet connect North America and South America, and this allowed direct low-latitude circulation between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The Drake Passage, which now separates South America and Antarctica, was closed, and this perhaps prevented thermal isolation of Antarctica. The Arctic was also more restricted. Although various proxies for past atmospheric concentrations across the Cenozoic do not agree in absolute terms, all suggest that levels in the early Paleogene before and after the PETM were much higher than at present-day. In any case, significant terrestrial ice sheets and sea-ice did not exist during the late Paleocene through early Eocene.

Earth surface temperatures gradually increased by about 6 °C from the late Paleocene through the early Eocene. Superimposed on this long-term, gradual warming were at least three (and probably more) &quot;hyperthermals&quot;. These can be defined as geologically brief (&lt;200,000 year) events characterized by rapid global warming, major changes in the environment, and massive carbon addition. Though not the first within the Cenozoic, the PETM was the most extreme hyperthermal, and stands out as a major change in the lithologic, biotic and geochemical composition of sediment in hundreds of records across Earth. Other hyperthermals clearly occurred at approximately 53.7 Ma (now called ETM-2 and also referred to as H-1, or the Elmo event) and at about 53.6 Ma (H-2), 53.3 (I-1), 53.2 (I-2) and 52.8 Ma (informally called K, X or ETM-3). The number, nomenclature, absolute ages, and relative global impact of the Eocene hyperthermals remain a source of current research. Whether they only occurred during the long-term warming, and whether they are causally related to apparently similar events in older intervals of the geological record (e.g. the Toarcian turnover of the Jurassic) are open issues.

==Global warming==

A study in 2020 estimated the global mean surface temperature (GMST) with 66% confidence during the latest Paleocene (c. 57 Ma) as , PETM (56 Ma) as and Early Eocene Climatic Optimum (EECO) (53.3 to 49.1 Ma) as . Estimates of the amount of average global temperature rise at the start of the PETM range from approximately 3 to 6 °C to between 5 and 8 °C. This warming was superimposed on &quot;long-term&quot; early Paleogene warming, and is based on several lines of evidence. There is a prominent (&gt;1‰) negative excursion in the of foraminifera shells, both those made in surface and deep ocean water. Because there was little or no polar ice in the early Paleogene, the shift in very probably signifies a rise in ocean temperature. The temperature rise is also supported by the spread of warmth-loving taxa to higher latitudes, changes in plant leaf shape and size, the Mg/Ca ratios of foraminifera, and the ratios of certain organic compounds, such as TEXH86.

Proxy data from Esplugafereda in northeastern Spain shows a rapid +8 °C temperature rise, in accordance with existing regional records of marine and terrestrial environments. Southern California had a mean annual temperature of about 17 °C ± 4.4 °C. In Antarctica, at least part of the year saw minimum temperatures of 15 °C.

TEXH86 values indicate that the average sea surface temperature (SST) reached over in the tropics during the PETM, enough to cause heat stress even in organisms resistant to extreme thermal stress, such as dinoflagellates, of which a significant number of species went extinct. Oxygen isotope ratios from Tanzania suggest that tropical SSTs may have been even higher, exceeding 40 °C. Ocean Drilling Program Site 1209 from the tropical western Pacific shows an increase in SST from 34 °C before the PETM to ~40 °C. In the eastern Tethys, SSTs rose by 3 to 5 °C. Low latitude Indian Ocean Mg/Ca records show seawater at all depths warmed by about 4-5 °C. In the Pacific Ocean, tropical SSTs increased by about 4-5 °C. TEXL86 values from deposits in New Zealand, then located between 50°S and 60°S in the southwestern Pacific, indicate SSTs of to , an increase of over from an average of to at the boundary between the Selandian and Thanetian. The extreme warmth of the southwestern Pacific extended into the Australo-Antarctic Gulf. Sediment core samples from the East Tasman Plateau, then located at a palaeolatitude of ~65 °S, show an increase in SSTs from ~26 °C to ~33 °C during the PETM. In the North Sea, SSTs jumped by 10 °C, reaching highs of ~33 °C, while in the West Siberian Sea, SSTs climbed to ~27 °C. 

Certainly, the central Arctic Ocean was ice-free before, during, and after the PETM. This can be ascertained from the composition of sediment cores recovered during the Arctic Coring Expedition (ACEX) at 87°N on Lomonosov Ridge. Moreover, temperatures increased during the PETM, as indicated by the brief presence of subtropical dinoflagellates (&quot;Apectodinium spp.&quot;}, and a marked increase in TEX86. The latter record is intriguing, though, because it suggests a 6 °C (11 °F) rise from ~ before the PETM to ~ during the PETM. Assuming the TEX86 record reflects summer temperatures, it still implies much warmer temperatures on the North Pole compared to the present day, but no significant latitudinal amplification relative to surrounding time.

The above considerations are important because, in many global warming simulations, high latitude temperatures increase much more at the poles through an ice–albedo feedback. It may be the case, however, that during the PETM, this feedback was largely absent because of limited polar ice, so temperatures on the Equator and at the poles increased similarly. Notable is the absence of documented greater warming in polar regions compared to other regions. This implies a non-existing ice-albedo feedback, suggesting no sea or land ice was present in the late Paleocene.

Precise limits on the global temperature rise during the PETM and whether this varied significantly with latitude remain open issues. Oxygen isotope and Mg/Ca of carbonate shells precipitated in surface waters of the ocean are commonly used measurements for reconstructing past temperature; however, both paleotemperature proxies can be compromised at low latitude locations, because re-crystallization of carbonate on the seafloor renders lower values than when formed. On the other hand, these and other temperature proxies (e.g., TEX86) are impacted at high latitudes because of seasonality; that is, the &quot;temperature recorder&quot; is biased toward summer, and therefore higher values, when the production of carbonate and organic carbon occurred.

==Carbon cycle disturbance==
Clear evidence for massive addition of 13C-depleted carbon at the onset of the PETM comes from two observations. First, a prominent negative excursion in the carbon isotope composition () of carbon-bearing phases characterizes the PETM in numerous (&gt;130) widespread locations from a range of environments. Second, carbonate dissolution marks the PETM in sections from the deep sea.

The total mass of carbon injected to the ocean and atmosphere during the PETM remains the source of debate. In theory, it can be estimated from the magnitude of the negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE), the amount of carbonate dissolution on the seafloor, or ideally both. However, the shift in the across the PETM depends on the location and the carbon-bearing phase analyzed. In some records of bulk carbonate, it is about 2‰ (per mil); in some records of terrestrial carbonate or organic matter it exceeds 6‰. Carbonate dissolution also varies throughout different ocean basins. It was extreme in parts of the north and central Atlantic Ocean, but far less pronounced in the Pacific Ocean. With available information, estimates of the carbon addition range from about 2,000 to 7,000 gigatons.

==Timing of carbon addition and warming==
The timing of the PETM excursion is of considerable interest. This is because the total duration of the CIE, from the rapid drop in through the near recovery to initial conditions, relates to key parameters of our global carbon cycle, and because the onset provides insight to the source of 13C-depleted .

The total duration of the CIE can be estimated in several ways. The iconic sediment interval for examining and dating the PETM is a core recovered in 1987 by the Ocean Drilling Program at Hole 690B at Maud Rise in the South Atlantic Ocean. At this location, the PETM CIE, from start to end, spans about 2 m. Long-term age constraints, through biostratigraphy and magnetostratigraphy, suggest an average Paleogene sedimentation rate of about 1.23 cm/1,000yrs. Assuming a constant sedimentation rate, the entire event, from onset though termination, was therefore estimated at 200,000 years. Subsequently, it was noted that the CIE spanned 10 or 11 subtle cycles in various sediment properties, such as Fe content. Assuming these cycles represent precession, a similar but slightly longer age was calculated by Rohl et al. 2000. If a massive amount of 13C-depleted is rapidly injected into the modern ocean or atmosphere and projected into the future, a ~200,000 year CIE results because of slow flushing through quasi steady-state inputs (weathering and volcanism) and outputs (carbonate and organic) of carbon. A different study, based on a revised orbital chronology and data from sediment cores in the South Atlantic and the Southern Ocean, calculated a slightly shorter duration of about 170,000 years.

A ~200,000 year duration for the CIE is estimated from models of global carbon cycling.

Age constraints at several deep-sea sites have been independently examined using 3He contents, assuming the flux of this cosmogenic nuclide is roughly constant over short time periods. This approach also suggests a rapid onset for the PETM CIE (&lt;20,000 years). However, the 3He records support a faster recovery to near initial conditions (&lt;100,000 years) than predicted by flushing via weathering inputs and carbonate and organic outputs.

There is other evidence to suggest that warming predated the excursion by some 3,000 years.

Some authors have suggested that the magnitude of the CIE may be underestimated due to local processes in many sites causing a large proportion of allochthonous sediments to accumulate in their sedimentary rocks, contaminating and offsetting isotopic values derived from them. Organic matter degradation by microbes has also been implicated as a source of skewing of carbon isotopic ratios in bulk organic matter.

==Effects==
===Precipitation===

The climate would also have become much wetter, with the increase in evaporation rates peaking in the tropics. Deuterium isotopes reveal that much more of this moisture was transported polewards than normal. Warm weather would have predominated as far north as the Polar basin. Finds of fossils of &quot;Azolla&quot; floating ferns in polar regions indicate subtropic temperatures at the poles. Central China during the PETM hosted dense subtropical forests as a result of the significant increase in rates of precipitation in the region, with average temperatures between 21 °C and 24 °C and mean annual precipitation ranging from 1,396 to 1,997 mm. Similarly, Central Asia became wetter as proto-monsoonal rainfall penetrated farther inland. Very high precipitation is also evidenced in the Cambay Shale Formation of India by the deposition of thick lignitic seams as a consequence of increased soil erosion and organic matter burial. Precipitation rates in the North Sea likewise soared during the PETM. In Cap d&#x27;Ailly, in present-day Normandy, a transient dry spell occurred just before the negative CIE, after which much moister conditions predominated, with the local environment transitioning from a closed marsh to an open, eutrophic swamp with frequent algal blooms. Precipitation patterns became highly unstable along the New Jersey Shelf. In the Rocky Mountain Interior, precipitation locally declined, however, as the interior of North America became more seasonally arid. Along the central California coast, conditions also became drier overall, although precipitation did increase in the summer months. The drying of western North America is explained by the northward shift of low-level jets and atmospheric rivers. East African sites display evidence of aridity punctuated by seasonal episodes of potent precipitation, revealing the global climate during the PETM not to be universally humid. The proto-Mediterranean coastlines of the western Tethys became drier. Evidence from Forada in northeastern Italy suggests that arid and humid climatic intervals alternated over the course of the PETM concomitantly with precessional cycles in mid-latitudes, and that overall, net precipitation over the central-western Tethys Ocean decreased.

===Ocean===
The amount of freshwater in the Arctic Ocean increased, in part due to Northern Hemisphere rainfall patterns, fueled by poleward storm track migrations under global warming conditions. The flux of freshwater entering the oceans increased drastically during the PETM, and continued for a time after the PETM&#x27;s termination.

====Anoxia====

The PETM generated the only oceanic anoxic event (OAE) of the Cenozoic. Oxygen depletion was achieved through a combination of elevated seawater temperatures, water column stratification, and oxidation of methane released from undersea clathrates. In parts of the oceans, especially the North Atlantic Ocean, bioturbation was absent. This may be due to bottom-water anoxia or due to changing ocean circulation patterns changing the temperatures of the bottom water. However, many ocean basins remained bioturbated through the PETM. Iodine to calcium ratios suggest oxygen minimum zones in the oceans expanded vertically and possibly also laterally. Water column anoxia and euxinia was most prevalent in restricted oceanic basins, such as the Arctic and Tethys Oceans. Euxinia struck the epicontinental North Sea Basin as well, as shown by increases in sedimentary uranium, molybdenum, sulphur, and pyrite concentrations, along with the presence of sulphur-bound isorenieratane. The Gulf Coastal Plain was also affected by euxinia. The Atlantic Coastal Plain, well oxygenated during the Late Palaeocene, became highly dysoxic during the PETM. The tropical surface oceans, in contrast, remained oxygenated over the course of the hyperthermal event.

It is possible that during the PETM&#x27;s early stages, anoxia helped to slow down warming through carbon drawdown via organic matter burial. A pronounced negative lithium isotope excursion in both marine carbonates and local weathering inputs suggests that weathering and erosion rates increased during the PETM, generating an increase in organic carbon burial, which acted as a negative feedback on the PETM&#x27;s severe global warming.

====Sea level====

Along with the global lack of ice, the sea level would have risen due to thermal expansion. Evidence for this can be found in the shifting palynomorph assemblages of the Arctic Ocean, which reflect a relative decrease in terrestrial organic material compared to marine organic matter. A significant marine transgression took place in the Indian Subcontinent. In the Tarim Sea, sea levels rose by 20-50 metres.

====Currents====
At the start of the PETM, the ocean circulation patterns changed radically in the course of under 5,000 years. Global-scale current directions reversed due to a shift in overturning from the Southern Hemisphere to Northern Hemisphere. This &quot;backwards&quot; flow persisted for 40,000 years. Such a change would transport warm water to the deep oceans, enhancing further warming. The major biotic turnover among benthic foraminifera has been cited as evidence of a significant change in deep water circulation.

====Acidification====
Ocean acidification occurred during the PETM, causing the calcite compensation depth to shoal. The lysocline marks the depth at which carbonate starts to dissolve (above the lysocline, carbonate is oversaturated): today, this is at about 4 km, comparable to the median depth of the oceans. This depth depends on (among other things) temperature and the amount of dissolved in the ocean. Adding initially raises the lysocline, resulting in the dissolution of deep water carbonates. This deep-water acidification can be observed in ocean cores, which show (where bioturbation has not destroyed the signal) an abrupt change from grey carbonate ooze to red clays (followed by a gradual grading back to grey). It is far more pronounced in North Atlantic cores than elsewhere, suggesting that acidification was more concentrated here, related to a greater rise in the level of the lysocline. Corrosive waters may have then spilled over into other regions of the world ocean from the North Atlantic. Model simulations show acidic water accumulation in the deep North Atlantic at the onset of the event. Acidification of deep waters, and the later spreading from the North Atlantic can explain spatial variations in carbonate dissolution. In parts of the southeast Atlantic, the lysocline rose by 2 km in just a few thousand years. Evidence from the tropical Pacific Ocean suggests a minimum lysocline shoaling of around 500 m at the time of this hyperthermal. Acidification may have increased the efficiency of transport of photic zone water into the ocean depths, thus partially acting as a negative feedback that retarded the rate of atmospheric carbon dioxide buildup. Also, diminished biocalcification inhibited the removal of alkalinity from the deep ocean, causing an overshoot of calcium carbonate deposition once net calcium carbonate production resumed, helping restore the ocean to its state before the PETM. As a consequence of coccolithophorid blooms enabled by enhanced runoff, carbonate was removed from seawater as the Earth recovered from the negative carbon isotope excursion, thus acting to ameliorate ocean acidification.

===Life===
Stoichiometric magnetite () particles were obtained from PETM-age marine sediments. The study from 2008 found elongate prism and spearhead crystal morphologies, considered unlike any magnetite crystals previously reported, and are potentially of biogenic origin. These biogenic magnetite crystals show unique gigantism, and probably are of aquatic origin. The study suggests that development of thick suboxic zones with high iron bioavailability, the result of dramatic changes in weathering and sedimentation rates, drove diversification of magnetite-forming organisms, likely including eukaryotes. Biogenic magnetites in animals have a crucial role in geomagnetic field navigation.

====Ocean====
The PETM is accompanied by significant changes in the diversity of calcareous nannofossils and benthic and planktonic foraminifera. A mass extinction of 35–50% of foraminifera (especially in deeper waters) occurred over the course of ~1,000 years, with the group suffering more during the PETM than during the dinosaur-slaying K-T extinction. At the onset of the PETM, benthic foraminiferal diversity dropped by 30% in the Pacific Ocean, while at Zumaia in what is now Spain, 55% of benthic foraminifera went extinct over the course of the PETM, though this decline was not ubiquitous to all sites; Himalayan platform carbonates show no major change in assemblages of large benthic foraminifera at the onset of the PETM; their decline came about towards the end of the event. A decrease in diversity and migration away from the oppressively hot tropics indicates planktonic foraminifera were adversely affected as well. The Lilliput effect is observed in shallow water foraminifera, possibly as a response to decreased surficial water density or diminished nutrient availability. Populations of planktonic foraminifera bearing photosymbionts increased. Extinction rates among calcareous nannoplankton increased, but so did origination rates. In the Kerguelen Plateau, nannoplankton productivity sharply declined at the onset of the negative excursion but was elevated in its aftermath. The nannoplankton genus &quot;Fasciculithus&quot; went extinct, most likely as a result of increased surface water oligotrophy; the genera &quot;Sphenolithus&quot;, &quot;Zygrhablithus&quot;, &quot;Octolithus&quot; suffered badly too.

Samples from the tropical Atlantic show that overall, dinocyst abundance diminished sharply. Contrarily, thermophilic dinoflagellates bloomed, particularly &quot;Apectodinium&quot;. This acme in &quot;Apectodinium&quot; abundance is used as a biostratigraphic marker defining the PETM. The fitness of &quot;Apectodinium homomorphum&quot; stayed constant over the PETM while that of others declined.

Radiolarians grew in size over the PETM.

Colonial corals, sensitive to rising temperatures, declined during the PETM, being replaced by larger benthic foraminifera. Aragonitic corals were greatly hampered in their ability to grow by the acidification of the ocean and eutrophication in surficial waters. Overall, coral framework-building capacity was greatly diminished.

The deep-sea extinctions are difficult to explain, because many species of benthic foraminifera in the deep-sea are cosmopolitan, and can find refugia against local extinction. General hypotheses such as a temperature-related reduction in oxygen availability, or increased corrosion due to carbonate undersaturated deep waters, are insufficient as explanations. Acidification may also have played a role in the extinction of the calcifying foraminifera, and the higher temperatures would have increased metabolic rates, thus demanding a higher food supply. Such a higher food supply might not have materialized because warming and increased ocean stratification might have led to declining productivity, along with increased remineralization of organic matter in the water column before it reached the benthic foraminifera on the sea floor. The only factor global in extent was an increase in temperature. Regional extinctions in the North Atlantic can be attributed to increased deep-sea anoxia, which could be due to the slowdown of overturning ocean currents, or the release and rapid oxidation of large amounts of methane.

In shallower waters, it&#x27;s undeniable that increased levels result in a decreased oceanic pH, which has a profound negative effect on corals. Experiments suggest it is also very harmful to calcifying plankton. However, the strong acids used to simulate the natural increase in acidity which would result from elevated concentrations may have given misleading results, and the most recent evidence is that coccolithophores (&quot;E. huxleyi&quot; at least) become &quot;more&quot;, not less, calcified and abundant in acidic waters. No change in the distribution of calcareous nannoplankton such as the coccolithophores can be attributed to acidification during the PETM. Nor was the abundance of calcareous nannoplankton controlled by changes in acidity, with local variations in nutrient availability and temperature playing much greater roles; diversity changes in calcareous nannoplankton in the Southern Ocean and at the Equator were most affected by temperature changes, whereas in much of the rest of the open ocean, changes in nutrient availability were their dominant drivers. Acidification did lead to an abundance of heavily calcified algae and weakly calcified forams. The calcareous nannofossil species &quot;Neochiastozygus junctus&quot; thrived; its success is attributable to enhanced surficial productivity caused by enhanced nutrient runoff. Eutrophication at the onset of the PETM precipitated a decline among K-strategist large foraminifera, though they rebounded during the post-PETM oligotrophy coevally with the demise of low-latitude corals.

A study published in May 2021 concluded that fish thrived in at least some tropical areas during the PETM, based on discovered fish fossils including &quot;Mene maculata&quot; at Ras Gharib, Egypt.

====Land====
Humid conditions caused migration of modern Asian mammals northward, dependent on the climatic belts. Uncertainty remains for the timing and tempo of migration. Terrestrial animals suffered mass mortality due to toxigenic cyanobacterial blooms enkindled by the extreme heat.

The increase in mammalian abundance is intriguing. Increased global temperatures may have promoted dwarfing – which may have encouraged speciation. Major dwarfing occurred early in the PETM, with further dwarfing taking place during the middle of the hyperthermal. The dwarfing of various mammal lineages led to further dwarfing in other mammals whose reduction in body size was not directly induced by the PETM. Many major mammalian clades – including hyaenodontids, artiodactyls, perissodactyls, and primates – appeared and spread around the globe 13,000 to 22,000 years after the initiation of the PETM. It is possible that the Indian Subcontinent acted as a diversity hub from which mammalian lineages radiated into Africa and the continents of the Northern Hemisphere. Multiple Eurasian mammal orders invaded North America, but because niche space was not saturated, these had little effect on overall community structure.

The diversity of insect herbivory, as measured by the amount and diversity of damage to plants caused by insects, increased during the PETM in correlation with global warming. The ant genus &quot;Gesomyrmex&quot; radiated across Eurasia during the PETM. As with mammals, soil-dwelling invertebrates are observed to have dwarfed during the PETM.

A profound change in terrestrial vegetation across the globe is associated with the PETM. Across all regions, floras from the latest Palaeocene are highly distinct from those of the PETM and the Early Eocene. The Arctic became dominated by palms and broadleaf forests. The Gulf coast of central Texas was covered in tropical rainforests and tropical seasonal forests.

===Geologic effects===
Sediment deposition changed significantly at many outcrops and in many drill cores spanning this time interval. During the PETM, sediments are enriched with kaolinite from a detrital source due to denudation (initial processes such as volcanoes, earthquakes, and plate tectonics). Increased precipitation and enhanced erosion of older kaolinite-rich soils and sediments may have been responsible for this. Increased weathering from the enhanced runoff formed thick paleosoil enriched with carbonate nodules (&quot;Microcodium&quot; like), and this suggests a semi-arid climate. Unlike during lesser, more gradual hyperthermals, glauconite authigenesis was inhibited.

The sedimentological effects of the PETM lagged behind the carbon isotope shifts. In the Tremp-Graus Basin of northern Spain, fluvial systems grew and rates of deposition of alluvial sediments increased with a lag time of around 3,800 years after the PETM.

At some marine locations (mostly deep-marine), sedimentation rates must have decreased across the PETM, presumably because of carbonate dissolution on the seafloor; at other locations (mostly shallow-marine), sedimentation rates must have increased across the PETM, presumably because of enhanced delivery of riverine material during the event.

==Possible causes==
Discriminating between different possible causes of the PETM is difficult. Temperatures were rising globally at a steady pace, and a mechanism must be invoked to produce an instantaneous spike which may have been accentuated or catalyzed by positive feedback (or activation of &quot;tipping points&quot;). The biggest aid in disentangling these factors comes from a consideration of the carbon isotope mass balance. We know the entire carbon cycle (i.e. the carbon contained within the oceans and atmosphere, which can change on short timescales) underwent a −0.2 % to −0.3 % perturbation in , and by considering the isotopic signatures of other carbon reserves, can consider what mass of the reserve would be necessary to produce this effect. The assumption underpinning this approach is that the mass of exogenic carbon was the same in the Paleogene as it is today – something which is very difficult to confirm.

===Eruption of large kimberlite field===
Although the cause of the initial warming has been attributed to a massive injection of carbon ( and/or CH4) into the atmosphere, the source of the carbon has yet to be found. The emplacement of a large cluster of kimberlite pipes at ~56 Ma in the Lac de Gras region of northern Canada may have provided the carbon that triggered early warming in the form of exsolved magmatic . Calculations indicate that the estimated 900–1,100 Pg of carbon required for the initial approximately 3 °C of ocean water warming associated with the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum could have been released during the emplacement of a large kimberlite cluster. The transfer of warm surface ocean water to intermediate depths led to thermal dissociation of seafloor methane hydrates, providing the isotopically depleted carbon that produced the carbon isotopic excursion. The coeval ages of two other kimberlite clusters in the Lac de Gras field and two other early Cenozoic hyperthermals indicate that degassing during kimberlite emplacement is a plausible source of the responsible for these sudden global warming events.

===Volcanic activity===
==== North Atlantic Igneous Province ====
One of the leading candidates for the cause of the observed carbon cycle disturbances and global warming is volcanic activity associated with the North Atlantic Igneous Province (NAIP), which is believed to have released more than 10,000 gigatons of carbon during the PETM based on the relatively isotopically heavy values of the initial carbon addition. Mercury anomalies during the PETM point to massive volcanism during the event. On top of that, increases in ∆199Hg show intense volcanism was concurrent with the beginning of the PETM. Osmium isotopic anomalies in Arctic Ocean sediments dating to the PETM have been interpreted as evidence of a volcanic cause of this hyperthermal.

Intrusions of hot magma into carbon-rich sediments may have triggered the degassing of isotopically light methane in sufficient volumes to cause global warming and the observed isotope anomaly. This hypothesis is documented by the presence of extensive intrusive sill complexes and thousands of kilometer-sized hydrothermal vent complexes in sedimentary basins on the mid-Norwegian margin and west of Shetland. This hydrothermal venting occurred at shallow depths, enhancing its ability to vent gases into the atmosphere and influence the global climate. Volcanic eruptions of a large magnitude can impact global climate, reducing the amount of solar radiation reaching the Earth&#x27;s surface, lowering temperatures in the troposphere, and changing atmospheric circulation patterns. Large-scale volcanic activity may last only a few days, but the massive outpouring of gases and ash can influence climate patterns for years. Sulfuric gases convert to sulfate aerosols, sub-micron droplets containing about 75 percent sulfuric acid. Following eruptions, these aerosol particles can linger as long as three to four years in the stratosphere. Furthermore, phases of volcanic activity could have triggered the release of methane clathrates and other potential feedback loops. NAIP volcanism influenced the climatic changes of the time not only through the addition of greenhouse gases but also by changing the bathymetry of the North Atlantic. The connection between the North Sea and the North Atlantic through the Faroe-Shetland Basin was severely restricted, as was its connection to it by way of the English Channel.

Later phases of NAIP volcanic activity may have caused the other hyperthermal events of the Early Eocene as well, such as ETM2.

==== Other volcanic activity ====
It has also been suggested that volcanic activity around the Caribbean may have disrupted the circulation of oceanic currents, amplifying the magnitude of climate change.

===Orbital forcing===
The presence of later (smaller) warming events of a global scale, such as the Elmo horizon (aka ETM2), has led to the hypothesis that the events repeat on a regular basis, driven by maxima in the 400,000 and 100,000 year eccentricity cycles in the Earth&#x27;s orbit. Cores from Howard&#x27;s Tract, Maryland indicate the PETM occurred as a result of an extreme in axial precession during an orbital eccentricity maximum. The current warming period is expected to last another 50,000 years due to a minimum in the eccentricity of the Earth&#x27;s orbit. Orbital increase in insolation (and thus temperature) would force the system over a threshold and unleash positive feedbacks. The orbital forcing hypothesis has been challenged by a study finding the PETM to have coincided with a minimum in the ~400 kyr eccentricity cycle, inconsistent with a proposed orbital trigger for the hyperthermal.

===Comet impact===
One theory holds that a 12C-rich comet struck the earth and initiated the warming event. A cometary impact coincident with the P/E boundary can also help explain some enigmatic features associated with this event, such as the iridium anomaly at Zumaia, the abrupt appearance of a localized kaolinitic clay layer with abundant magnetic nanoparticles, and especially the nearly simultaneous onset of the carbon isotope excursion and the thermal maximum.

A key feature and testable prediction of a comet impact is that it should produce virtually instantaneous environmental effects in the atmosphere and surface ocean with later repercussions in the deeper ocean. Even allowing for feedback processes, this would require at least 100 gigatons of extraterrestrial carbon. Such a catastrophic impact should have left its mark on the globe. A clay layer of 5-20m thickness on the coastal shelf of New Jersey contained unusual amounts of magnetite, but it was found to have formed 9-18 kyr too late for these magnetic particles to have been a result of a comet&#x27;s impact, and the particles had a crystal structure which was a signature of magnetotactic bacteria rather than an extraterrestrial origin. However, recent analyses have shown that isolated particles of non-biogenic origin make up the majority of the magnetic particles in the clay sample.

A 2016 report in &quot;Science&quot; describes the discovery of impact ejecta from three marine P-E boundary sections from the Atlantic margin of the eastern U.S., indicating that an extraterrestrial impact occurred during the carbon isotope excursion at the P-E boundary. The silicate glass spherules found were identified as microtektites and microkrystites.

===Burning of peat===
The combustion of prodigious quantities of peat was once postulated, because there was probably a greater mass of carbon stored as living terrestrial biomass during the Paleocene than there is today since plants in fact grew more vigorously during the period of the PETM. This theory was refuted, because in order to produce the excursion observed, over 90 percent of the Earth&#x27;s biomass would have to have been combusted. However, the Paleocene is also recognized as a time of significant peat accumulation worldwide. A comprehensive search failed to find evidence for the combustion of fossil organic matter, in the form of soot or similar particulate carbon.

===Enhanced respiration===
Respiration rates of organic matter increase when temperatures rise. One feedback mechanism proposed to explain the rapid rise in carbon dioxide levels is a sudden, speedy rise in terrestrial respiration rates concordant with global temperature rise initiated by any of the other causes of warming. Mathematical modelling supports increased organic matter oxidation as a viable explanation for observed isotopic excursions in carbon during the PETM&#x27;s onset.

=== Terrestrial methane release ===
Release of methane from wetlands was a contributor to the PETM warming. Evidence for this comes from a decrease in hopanoids from mire sediments, likely reflecting increased wetland methanogenesis deeper within the mires.

===Methane clathrate release===
Methane hydrate dissolution has been invoked as a highly plausible causal mechanism for the carbon isotope excursion and warming observed at the PETM. The most obvious feedback mechanism that could amplify the initial perturbation is that of methane clathrates. Under certain temperature and pressure conditions, methane – which is being produced continually by decomposing microbes in sea bottom sediments – is stable in a complex with water, which forms ice-like cages trapping the methane in solid form. As temperature rises, the pressure required to keep this clathrate configuration stable increases, so shallow clathrates dissociate, releasing methane gas to make its way into the atmosphere. Since biogenic clathrates have a signature of −60 ‰ (inorganic clathrates are the still rather large −40 ‰), relatively small masses can produce large excursions. Further, methane is a potent greenhouse gas as it is released into the atmosphere, so it causes warming, and as the ocean transports this warmth to the bottom sediments, it destabilizes more clathrates.

In order for the clathrate hypothesis to be applicable to PETM, the oceans must show signs of having been warmer slightly before the carbon isotope excursion, because it would take some time for the methane to become mixed into the system and -reduced carbon to be returned to the deep ocean sedimentary record. Up until the 2000s, the evidence suggested that the two peaks were in fact simultaneous, weakening the support for the methane theory. In 2002, a short gap between the initial warming and the excursion was detected. In 2007, chemical markers of surface temperature (TEX86) had also indicated that warming occurred around 3,000 years before the carbon isotope excursion, although this did not seem to hold true for all cores. However, research in 2005 found no evidence of this time gap in the deeper (non-surface) waters. Moreover, the small apparent change in TEX86 that precede the anomaly can easily (and more plausibly) be ascribed to local variability (especially on the Atlantic coastal plain, e.g. Sluijs, et al., 2007) as the TEX86 paleo-thermometer is prone to significant biological effects. The of benthic or planktonic forams does not show any pre-warming in any of these localities, and in an ice-free world, it is generally a much more reliable indicator of past ocean temperatures. Analysis of these records reveals another interesting fact: planktonic (floating) forams record the shift to lighter isotope values earlier than benthic (bottom dwelling) forams. The lighter (lower ) methanogenic carbon can only be incorporated into foraminifer shells after it has been oxidised. A gradual release of the gas would allow it to be oxidised in the deep ocean, which would make benthic foraminifera show lighter values earlier. The fact that the planktonic foraminifera are the first to show the signal suggests that the methane was released so rapidly that its oxidation used up all the oxygen at depth in the water column, allowing some methane to reach the atmosphere unoxidised, where atmospheric oxygen would react with it. This observation also allows us to constrain the duration of methane release to under around 10,000 years.

However, there are several major problems with the methane hydrate dissociation hypothesis. The most parsimonious interpretation for surface-water foraminifera to show the excursion before their benthic counterparts (as in the Thomas et al. paper) is that the perturbation occurred from the top down, and not the bottom up. If the anomalous (in whatever form: CH4 or ) entered the atmospheric carbon reservoir first, and then diffused into the surface ocean waters, which mix with the deeper ocean waters over much longer time-scales, we would expect to observe the planktonics shifting toward lighter values before the benthics.

An additional critique of the methane clathrate release hypothesis is that the warming effects of large-scale methane release would not be sustainable for more than a millennium. Thus, exponents of this line of criticism suggest that methane clathrate release could not have been the main driver of the PETM, which lasted for 50,000 to 200,000 years.

There has been some debate about whether there was a large enough amount of methane hydrate to be a major carbon source; a 2011 paper proposed that was the case. The present-day global methane hydrate reserve was once considered to be between 2,000 and 10,000 Gt C (billions of tons of carbon), but is now estimated between 1500 and 2000 Gt C. However, because the global ocean bottom temperatures were ~6 °C higher than today, which implies a much smaller volume of sediment hosting gas hydrate than today, the global amount of hydrate before the PETM has been thought to be much less than present-day estimates. One study, however, suggests that because seawater oxygen content was lower, sufficient methane clathrate deposits could have been present to make them a viable mechanism for explaining the isotopic changes. In a 2006 study, scientists regarded the source of carbon for the PETM to be a mystery. A 2011 study, using numerical simulations suggests that enhanced organic carbon sedimentation and methanogenesis could have compensated for the smaller volume of hydrate stability. A 2016 study based on reconstructions of atmospheric content during the PETM&#x27;s carbon isotope excursions (CIE), using triple oxygen isotope analysis, suggests a massive release of seabed methane into the atmosphere as the driver of climatic changes. The authors also state that a massive release of methane hydrates through thermal dissociation of methane hydrate deposits has been the most convincing hypothesis for explaining the CIE ever since it was first identified, according to them. In 2019, a study suggested that there was a global warming of around 2 degrees several millennia before PETM, and that this warming had eventually destabilized methane hydrates and caused the increased carbon emission during PETM, as evidenced by the large increase in barium ocean concentrations (since PETM-era hydrate deposits would have been also been rich in barium, and would have released it upon their meltdown). In 2022, a foraminiferal records study had reinforced this conclusion, suggesting that the release of CO2 before PETM was comparable to the current anthropogenic emissions in its rate and scope, to the point that there was enough time for a recovery to background levels of warming and ocean acidification in the centuries to millennia between the so-called pre-onset excursion (POE) and the main event (carbon isotope excursion, or CIE). A 2021 paper had further indicated that while PETM began with a significant intensification of volcanic activity and that lower-intensity volcanic activity sustained elevated carbon dioxide levels, &quot;at least one other carbon reservoir released significant greenhouse gases in response to initial warming&quot;.

It was estimated in 2001 that it would take around 2,300 years for an increased temperature to diffuse warmth into the sea bed to a depth sufficient to cause a release of clathrates, although the exact time-frame is highly dependent on a number of poorly constrained assumptions. Ocean warming due to flooding and pressure changes due to a sea-level drop may have caused clathrates to become unstable and release methane. This can take place over as short of a period as a few thousand years. The reverse process, that of fixing methane in clathrates, occurs over a larger scale of tens of thousands of years.

===Ocean circulation===
The large scale patterns of ocean circulation are important when considering how heat was transported through the oceans. Our understanding of these patterns is still in a preliminary stage. Models show that there are possible mechanisms to quickly transport heat to the shallow, clathrate-containing ocean shelves, given the right bathymetric profile, but the models cannot yet match the distribution of data we observe. &quot;Warming accompanying a south-to-north switch in deepwater formation would produce sufficient warming to destabilize seafloor gas hydrates over most of the world ocean to a water depth of at least 1900 m.&quot; This destabilization could have resulted in the release of more than 2000 gigatons of methane gas from the clathrate zone of the ocean floor. The timing of changes in ocean circulation with respect to the shift in carbon isotope ratios has been argued to support the proposition that warmer deep water caused methane hydrate release. However, a different study found no evidence of a change in deep water formation, instead suggesting that deepened subtropical subduction rather than subtropical deep water formation occurred during the PETM.

Arctic freshwater input into the North Pacific could serve as a catalyst for methane hydrate destabilization, an event suggested as a precursor to the onset of the PETM.

==Recovery==
Climate proxies, such as ocean sediments (depositional rates) indicate a duration of ~83 ka, with ~33 ka in the early rapid phase and ~50 ka in a subsequent gradual phase.

The most likely method of recovery involves an increase in biological productivity, transporting carbon to the deep ocean. This would be assisted by higher global temperatures and levels, as well as an increased nutrient supply (which would result from higher continental weathering due to higher temperatures and rainfall; volcanoes may have provided further nutrients). Evidence for higher biological productivity comes in the form of bio-concentrated barium. However, this proxy may instead reflect the addition of barium dissolved in methane. Diversifications suggest that productivity increased in near-shore environments, which would have been warm and fertilized by run-off, outweighing the reduction in productivity in the deep oceans. Large deposits in the Arctic Ocean floor of the aquatic fern Azolla in the middle Eocene (the &quot;Azolla Event&quot;) may have been a contributory factor in the early stages of the end of the PETM by sequestering carbon in buried decayed Azolla. Another pulse of NAIP volcanic activity may have also played a role in terminating the hyperthermal via a volcanic winter.

==Comparison with today&#x27;s climate change==
Since at least 1997, the PETM has been investigated in geoscience as an analogue to understand the effects of global warming and of massive carbon inputs to the ocean and atmosphere, including ocean acidification. A main difference is that during the PETM, the planet was ice-free, as the Drake Passage had not yet opened and the Central American Seaway had not yet closed. Although the PETM is now commonly held to be a &quot;case study&quot; for global warming and massive carbon emission, the cause, details, and overall significance of the event remain uncertain.

=== Rate of carbon addition ===
Carbon emissions during the PETM were more gradual relative to present-day anthropogenic emissions. Model simulations of peak carbon addition to the ocean–atmosphere system during the PETM give a probable range of 0.3–1.7 petagrams of carbon per year (Pg C/yr), which is much slower than the currently observed rate of carbon emissions. One petagram of carbon is equivalent to a gigaton of carbon (GtC); the current rate of carbon injection into the atmosphere is over 10 GtC/yr, a rate much greater than the carbon injection rate that occurred during the PETM. It has been suggested that today&#x27;s methane emission regime from the ocean floor is potentially similar to that during the PETM. Because the modern rate of carbon release exceeds the PETM&#x27;s, it is speculated the a PETM-like scenario is the best-case consequence of anthropogenic global warming, with a mass extinction of a magnitude similar to the Cretaceous-Palaeogene extinction event being a worst-case scenario.

=== Similarity of temperatures ===
Professor of Earth and planetary sciences James Zachos notes that IPCC projections for 2300 in the &#x27;business-as-usual&#x27; scenario could &quot;potentially bring global temperature to a level the planet has not seen in 50 million years&quot; – during the early Eocene. Some have described the PETM as arguably the best ancient analog of modern climate change. Scientists have investigated effects of climate change on chemistry of the oceans by exploring oceanic changes during the PETM.

=== Tipping points ===
A study found that the PETM shows that substantial climate-shifting tipping points in the Earth system exist, which &quot;can trigger release of additional carbon reservoirs and drive Earth&#x27;s climate into a hotter state&quot;.

=== Climate sensitivity ===
Whether climate sensitivity was lower or higher during the PETM than today remains under debate. A 2022 study found that the Eurasian Epicontinental Sea acted as a major carbon sink during the PETM due to its high biological productivity and helped to slow and mitigate the warming, and that the existence of many large epicontinental seas at that time made the Earth&#x27;s climate less sensitive to forcing by greenhouse gases relative to today, when much fewer epicontinental seas exist. Other research, however, suggests that climate sensitivity was higher during the PETM than today, meaning that sensitivity to greenhouse gas release increases the higher their concentration in the atmosphere.

<text>The Cibi ( ) is a Fijian meke of Bauan origin and war dance, generally performed before or after a battle. It came to prominence in the rugby field in 1939 when it was performed by the Fiji national rugby union team before the match. It is also known as Teivovo (&quot;war fence&quot;, from &quot;tei voavoa&quot; &quot;planting on abandoned land&quot;).
==Origins==
The origins of the cibi date back to the country&#x27;s warring times with their Pacific neighbours and intertribal warfare. On their return home the warriors heralded their victory by displaying flags – one for every enemy slain. They were met by the women who would sing songs with accompanying gestures. The cibi was meant for open battle to inspire the troops, but it was sung with more vigour when the victorious army returned home to celebrate.

In 1939, when Fiji prepared for its first-ever tour of New Zealand, the captain, Ratu Sir George Cakobau, thought his team should have a war dance to match the All Blacks&#x27; haka. He approached Ratu Bola, the high chief of the warrior clan of Navusaradave in Bau, who taught them the Cibi which has been adopted as Fiji&#x27;s pre-match ritual ever since and went on to become the only team to remain unbeaten on a full tour of New Zealand.

==The chant==

The &quot;cibi&quot; had perhaps been used incorrectly though, as the word actually means &quot;a celebration of victory by warriors&quot;, &quot;a dance of triumph&quot; whereas &quot;bole&quot; or &quot;ibole&quot; is the acceptance of a challenge. For this reason, the Cibi was replaced in 2012 with the new Bole ( &quot;mbo-lay&quot;) war cry. The Bole war cry has a lot more energy compared to the Cibi and seems far more fitting for the gruelling match that is about to commence, However, after the 2012 Pacific Nations Rugby Cup, the Cibi returned to be used.

The Bole however has not been used after the 2012 Pacific Nations Rugby Cup match against Tonga. The Flying Fijians have opted to use the Cibi for the rest of their matches. The current reason for the team removing the Bole is unknown.

Composed by Ratu Manoa Rasigatale, the Bole is translated as follows:

<text>The Manu Siva Tau is a Samoan war dance, performed by the Samoan sporting teams before each match.

The national rugby union team used to perform the traditional &#x27;Maulu&#x27;ulu Moa&#x27; on tour. Prior to the 1991 World Cup, the &#x27;Manu&#x27; war chant was composed, it was considered to be more effective at psyching up players.

The national Australian rules football team performs the Siva Tau at its International Cup appearances.

In WWE, The Usos, as faces, performed the Siva Tau as part of their ring entrance.

The Toa Samoa national rugby league team also perform the Siva Tau before each match (with the &quot;Toa&quot; replacing &quot;Manu&quot; in the words).

The song &quot;Le Manu&quot; by the New Zealand metal band Shepherds Reign has the lyrics of the Siva Tau as performed by the Manu Samoa.

==Words==


==Alternate versions==
During the 2007 Rugby World Cup, the Samoa national rugby union team used a more aggressive version of the Siva Tau. However, this version was dropped by the Manu Samoa before the 2007 Rugby World Cup match against United States in favour of the original version.

This version of the Siva Tau, similar to the version used by the Manu Samoa in the 2007 Rugby World Cup, is used by the Samoa national rugby league team, however, differently from the prior version, the final lines are similar to the Siva Tau performed by the Manu Samoa.

<text>The kailao is a cultural dance from the South Pacific country of Tonga. It originates from Wallis and Futuna.

==History==
The kailao originated on the island collectivity of Wallis and Futuna, where it is still performed in public ceremonies. In Tonga it is performed at public and private ceremonies. The men, bearing stylized clubs (pate kailao), dance in a fierce manner that emulates fighting, to the accompaniment of a beaten slit drum or tin box which sets the tempo. Unlike most other Tongan dances, it is performed without singing. The sequences of movements are called by the lead dancer, who calls out the names of the sequences and signals when to do them. They can involve mock combat between dancers, changes in formation, and tricks involving the pate kailao themselves. The moves display the dancers&#x27; discipline, obedience, and skills with their weapons. A similar Rotuman dance, also derived from the &#x27;Uvean original, is similarly called the &quot;ka&#x27;loa&quot;.
The &#x27;Ikale Tahi, the Tongan national rugby union team, used to perform the kailao with kailao clubs or sticks, as they did against Wales in 1974. In the 1980s, they stopped performing the kailao and switched to the &quot;sipi tau&quot;, which is performed without sticks, as it was considered more appropriate for the non-ceremonial setting.

==Sipi Tau (Rugby Union)==
The Tonga rugby union national team&#x27;s pre-game challenge, the Sipi Tau was penned by King Tama Tu&#x27;i Tāufaʻāhau Tupou IV in 1994, but its origins can be traced back much further. In Tonga in the pre-1800s there were no challenges before war. Indeed, talking was considered a sign of weakness in battle. But in the 19th century a war dance was introduced from the neighbouring Wallis and Futuna Islands and Tonga quickly annexed it.
There have been several different Sipi Tau used by the Tongan rugby team over the years, but it is unsure when they were first used in rugby. The latest one was composed in honour of a short, successful tour of New Zealand in 1994. The current words were first used in the 2011 Rugby World Cup.
