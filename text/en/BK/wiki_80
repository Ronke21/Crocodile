<text>Thomas William Osborne (born February 23, 1937) is an American former football player, coach, college athletics administrator, and politician from Nebraska. He served as head football coach of the Nebraska Cornhuskers from 1973 to 1997 (25 seasons). After being inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1999, Osborne was elected to Congress in 2000 from Nebraska&#x27;s third district as a Republican. He served three terms (2001–2007), returned to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln as athletic director in 2007, and retired in 2013.

Osborne played college football as a quarterback and wide receiver at Hastings College, and soon after finishing his brief National Football League (NFL) career, he was hired by Nebraska head coach Bob Devaney as an assistant. Osborne was named Devaney&#x27;s successor in 1973, and over the next 25 years established himself as one of the best coaches in college football history with his trademark I-formation offense and revolutionary strength, conditioning, and nutrition programs. He retired with a career record of 13 conference titles, and three national championships. He coached 53 All-Americans, including 1983 Heisman Trophy winner Mike Rozier.

==Early life==
Born and raised in Hastings, a town in rural central Nebraska, Osborne was a star athlete at Hastings High School in football, basketball, and track. As a senior in 1955, he was named Nebraska High School Athlete of The Year by the &quot;Omaha World-Herald.&quot; He graduated from Hastings College with a BA in history in 1959. Osborne earned a Master&#x27;s degree in educational psychology in 1963 and completed his doctorate in 1965, both at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln. Osborne&#x27;s first job at the university was counselor in the Selleck Quadrangle, where he oversaw a floor of freshmen football players. He also served in the Nebraska Army National Guard from 1960 to 1966.

==Playing career==
At Hastings, Osborne quarterbacked the football team and became the first male athlete in Nebraska to be named both the high school (1955) and college (1959) athlete of the year by the &quot;Omaha World-Herald&quot;. He was also the 1958 recipient of the Emil S. Liston Award, which was given annually to the most outstanding National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics NAIA junior basketball player who displayed high athletic and scholastic achievement.

===San Francisco 49ers===
Osborne was selected in the nineteenth round (222nd overall) of the 1959 NFL draft by the San Francisco 49ers. He was eventually released by the 49ers without playing in a regular season game.

===Washington Redskins===
The Washington Redskins picked up Osborne in 1960 and he made his NFL debut on November 6 against the St. Louis Cardinals. He had one reception for eight yards in a 44–6 Redskins loss. In his second game a few weeks later, Osborne caught six passes for 36 yards against the Cleveland Browns, but Washington lost again, 27–16.

Osborne saw more playing time in 1961, starting twelve games. He scored his first career touchdown against the Browns in Week 4, and his second against the Cardinals in Week 12. Osborne&#x27;s last career game, a 34–24 Washington win over Dallas, was his only career victory.

==Coaching career==
===Nebraska===
In 1962, Osborne joined Nebraska&#x27;s coaching staff as an unpaid assistant to head coach Bob Devaney; his only compensation was the ability to dine at the athletic training table. After disappointing 6–4 seasons in both 1967 and 1968, Devaney named Osborne offensive coordinator for the 1969 season. Osborne immediately overhauled the offense, switching to a balanced attack operated from the I formation. The revamped offense sparked the 1970 Cornhuskers to the first national title in program history. Nebraska defeated LSU 17–12 in the Orange Bowl on New Year&#x27;s night and finished first in the post-bowl AP Poll. Nebraska won the national title again in 1971, becoming the first champion ever to defeat the next three teams in the final AP Poll (Oklahoma, Colorado, and Alabama).

Devaney stepped down as head coach after the 1972 season to concentrate on his duties as athletic director, and named Osborne his successor. Devaney&#x27;s final game was a convincing win over Notre Dame in the Orange Bowl, Nebraska&#x27;s third straight Orange Bowl victory. At age 35, Osborne took over as Nebraska&#x27;s head coach, a position he would hold for 25 years until his retirement following the 1997 season.

In his quarter-century as head coach, Osborne was a model of consistency. His teams never won fewer than nine games in a season, only finished worse than third in conference or division play once, finished in the top 15 of the final AP poll 24 out of 25 years, and were ranked in the top 25 for 304 out of his 307 games as head coach–including every weekly poll from October 12, 1981, onward. Osborne&#x27;s teams won outright national championships in 1994 and 1995, and a share of another in 1997. Osborne&#x27;s Huskers also won or shared 13 conference championships (12 Big Eight, one Big 12). His 255–49–3 record gave him the best winning percentage (83.6%) among active coaches at the time of his retirement and the fifth-best of all time, and he won 250 games faster than any coach in Division I-A history. Osborne finished his coaching career with a bowl record of 12–13.

Osborne&#x27;s teams were known for their powerful rushing attack and strong defense (also known as the Blackshirts—a reference to the black jerseys worn in practice by NU&#x27;s defensive starters). Using Osborne&#x27;s trademark I-form option, Nebraska led the nation in rushing several times in the 1980s and 1990s, due to the efforts of players like Jarvis Redwine, Heisman Trophy winner Mike Rozier, Calvin Jones, Ahman Green, and Lawrence Phillips. Osborne&#x27;s offenses were initially balanced attacks, but after struggling against Oklahoma&#x27;s wishbone option in the 1970s, he switched to a run-based option to better utilize the versatility of dual-threat quarterbacks such as Jeff Quinn, Turner Gill, Tommie Frazier, and Scott Frost.

One of the enduring moments of Osborne&#x27;s tenure was the 1984 Orange Bowl. Nebraska entered the game 12–0 and had been ranked No. 1 the entire season. The Cornhuskers scored a late touchdown against No. 5 Miami to cut the Hurricanes&#x27; lead to 31–30, but rather than kick the extra point to tie (which would have won the national title for NU), Osborne opted to attempt the two-point conversion and go for the win. However, Gill&#x27;s pass attempt was tipped away in the end zone, giving hometown Miami the victory and their first national championship.

Nebraska lost another heartbreaking title game in the 1994 Orange Bowl. Despite going into the game as a 17-point underdog, the Cornhuskers held a 16–15 lead on Florida State with less than two minutes remaining. After Florida State drove to retake the lead 18–16, Nebraska hit a quick downfield pass to get one last field goal attempt as time ran out, which sailed wide.

The next year, Osborne finally earned his first title as head coach, defeating Miami in the Orange Bowl. The Huskers trailed 10–0 after one quarter, but rallied to win 24–17. The next year, the Cornhuskers roared through the regular season, winning every game by at least 14 points and shattering offensive records. Nebraska defeated Florida 62–24 in the 1996 Fiesta Bowl to earn Osborne his second national championship. Many pundits consider NU&#x27;s 1995 team the best college football team of all time.

Osborne announced his retirement late in the 1997 season, selecting longtime I-backs coach Frank Solich to succeed him. In his final game, Nebraska won the national championship with a 42–17 victory over Tennessee. In his final five seasons, Osborne&#x27;s record was a staggering 60–3, which remains the strongest finale to any Division I coaching career.

===Honors===
In 1995, Osborne received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

In 1998, Nebraska renamed the playing surface at Memorial Stadium &quot;Tom Osborne Field.&quot; The stadium nearly doubled in size during his three decades on NU&#x27;s coaching staff, a reflection of Nebraska&#x27;s increased national prominence in that time.

Osborne was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1999 and received the Jim Thorpe Lifetime Achievement Award in 2000. In 1999, ESPN named Osborne the &quot;coach of the decade&quot; for the 1990s. A 2007 poll named Osborne the &quot;greatest college football coach of all time&quot;.

In 2013, the NAIA Football National Championship trophy was named the &quot;Tom Osborne Trophy.&quot; In 2018, Osborne was inducted into the National High School Hall of Fame.

===Coaching tree===
Osborne&#x27;s Nebraska coaching staffs were renowned for their lack of turnover. Several assistants were known to have declined head coaching offers elsewhere to remain with the program. Notable examples include George Darlington (30 seasons), Milt Tenopir (29 seasons), and Charles McBride (23 seasons) all of whom had opportunities to become head coaches. Darlington was the first assistant coach in Division I-A history to be involved in 300 wins at one school. However, several assistant coaches and players under Osborne did go on to become NCAA head coaches:

* Craig Bohl: North Dakota State (2003–13), Wyoming (2014–2023)
* Scott Frost: UCF (2016–2017, 2025-present), Nebraska (2018–2022)
* Turner Gill: Buffalo (2006–09), Kansas (2010–11), Liberty (2012–18)
* Frank Solich: Nebraska (1998–2003), Ohio (2005–2020)
* Tony Samuel: New Mexico State (1997–2004), Southeast Missouri State (2006–13)
* Monte Kiffin: North Carolina State (1980–1982)
* Warren Powers: Washington State (1977), Missouri (1978–1984)

===Head coaching record===










==Athletic director==
From 1979 to 1998, Osborne was an assistant athletic director at Nebraska, under both Bob Devaney and Bill Byrne.

Osborne and the 1997 national championship team were the guests of honor at Nebraska&#x27;s 2007 Homecoming game. Just two days after the resulting 45–14 loss to Oklahoma State – Nebraska&#x27;s worst home loss since being shut out 31–0 by Missouri in 1958 – athletic director Steve Pederson was fired. On October 16, 2007, Osborne was named interim athletic director. On November 24, 2007, Osborne fired head coach Bill Callahan following a 5–7 season. Osborne appointed himself interim head coach so that he could perform recruiting duties while remaining in compliance with NCAA rules. He served in this capacity for less than a week before naming Bo Pelini head coach on December 2. In 2010, Osborne ended Nebraska&#x27;s long-standing relationship with the Big 12 Conference and accepted an invitation for the school to become the twelfth member of the Big Ten.

On December 19, Nebraska removed the interim tag from Osborne&#x27;s title and announced he would remain athletic director through June 30, 2010. Osborne was paid $250,000 per year to manage Nebraska&#x27;s 23-sport program. Osborne later agreed to continue as athletic director after 2010, with his position to be reviewed annually. On September 26, 2012, Osborne announced his retirement, effective January 1 of the following year. Osborne officially resigned on January 2, 2013, after returning to Lincoln with the football team following their participation in the Capital One Bowl.

==Political career==
===House of Representatives===
Early in 2000, Osborne announced that he would run in Nebraska&#x27;s 3rd District as a Republican. He had grown up in Hastings, one of the larger cities in the sprawling district, and claimed a home in Lemoyne, near Ogallala, as his district residence. However, he hadn&#x27;t lived regularly in the district since at least 1964; for most of that time he lived in Lincoln, the heart of the 1st District. Nonetheless, due to his wide popularity in the state, he easily won the Republican primary, which was tantamount to election in what has long been one of the most Republican districts in the nation. He breezed to victory in November with 83 percent of the vote. He was reelected with no major-party opposition in 2002 and against a Democrat in 2004.

In Congress, Osborne&#x27;s voting record was moderate to conservative. He garnered a lifetime rating of 83 from the American Conservative Union.

At one point, Osborne teamed up with Nebraska State Senator Ernie Chambers, normally his political adversary, to oppose efforts to expand gambling in Nebraska.

Following Osborne&#x27;s congressional service, President George W. Bush appointed him as a member of the Board of Directors of the Corporation for National and Community Service in 2007, but he resigned in 2008.

===2006 governor&#x27;s race===

In 2006, Osborne ran for Governor of Nebraska, challenging incumbent Dave Heineman and Omaha businessman Dave Nabity in the Republican primary.

Osborne was initially thought to be the favorite in the race, given his tremendous popularity in the state. However, Heineman took 49 percent of the more than 197,000 votes cast to Osborne&#x27;s 45 percent.

The &quot;Lincoln Journal Star&quot; analyzed the race:

While Osborne captured populous Omaha and Lincoln, Heineman sealed his victory in rural counties and key population centers in western and central Nebraska&#x27;s critical Republican battleground ... it was the political impact of two gubernatorial vetoes that appeared to lift [Heineman] into a late surge, especially in Osborne&#x27;s congressional district.

Heineman&#x27;s opposition to Class I rural school reorganization and the granting of resident college tuition rates to the children of illegal immigrants cut into Osborne&#x27;s support. Osborne declined to sign referendum petitions seeking voter repeal of the rural school legislation and said he would have signed the resident tuition bill.&quot;

<text>Joseph Wright (3 September 1734 – 29 August 1797), styled Joseph Wright of Derby, was an English landscape and portrait painter. He has been acclaimed as &quot;the first professional painter to express the spirit of the Industrial Revolution&quot;.

Wright is notable for his use of tenebrism, an exaggerated form of the better known chiaroscuro effect, which emphasizes the contrast of light and dark, and for his paintings of candle-lit subjects. His paintings of the birth of science out of alchemy, often based on the meetings of the Lunar Society of Birmingham, a group of scientists and industrialists living in the English Midlands, are a significant record of the struggle of science against religious values in the period known as the Age of Enlightenment.

Many of Wright&#x27;s paintings and drawings are owned by Derby City Council, and are on display at the Derby Museum and Art Gallery.

== Life ==
Joseph Wright was born in Irongate, Derby, to a respectable family of lawyers. He was the third of five children of Hannah Brookes (1700–1764) and John Wright (1697–1767), an attorney and the town clerk of Derby. Joseph had two elder brothers, John and Richard Wright.

Deciding to become a painter, as a seventeen-year old youth Wright went to London in 1751 and for two years studied under Thomas Hudson, the master of Joshua Reynolds. Wright acknowledged that he was also influenced by Alexander Cozens and applied his composition ideas to paintings.

After painting portraits for a while in Derby, the young Wright again worked as an assistant to Hudson for fifteen months. In 1753 he returned to, and settled in Derby. He varied his work in portraiture by the production of subjects with strong tenebrism under artificial light, with which his name is chiefly associated, and by landscape painting. Wright also spent a productive period in Liverpool, from 1768 to 1771, painting portraits. These included pictures of a number of prominent citizens and their families.

Having established himself in his profession Wright married Ann (also known as Hannah) Swift, the daughter of a Derbyshire lead miner, on 28 July 1773.

Wright set off in 1773 with John Downman, a newly pregnant Ann Wright, and Richard Hurleston for Italy. Their ship took shelter for three weeks in Nice before they completed their outward voyage in Livorno in Italy in February 1774. Downman returned to Britain in 1775. Although he spent a great deal of productive time in Naples, Wright never witnessed any major eruption of Mount Vesuvius. However, it is possible that he witnessed smaller, less impressive eruptions, which may have inspired many of his subsequent paintings of the volcano.

On his return from his working sojourn in Italy he again established himself in England as a portrait-painter, this time at the fashionable spa resort of Bath. But he met with little encouragement there, and in 1777 returned to Derby where he spent the rest of his life. Over the years he became increasingly asthmatic and nervous about the house, and for these complaints he was treated by his friend and leading medical doctor Erasmus Darwin. His friendship with Darwin had brought him and his works into the orbit of the Lunar Society of Birmingham, and although he was not a formal member of the Society he can be considered a key artistic influence on the men of the Midlands Enlightenment.

In his latter years Wright was a frequent contributor to the exhibitions of the Society of Artists, and to those of the Royal Academy, of which he was elected an associate in 1781 and a full member in 1784. He, however, declined the latter honour on account of a slight that he believed that he had received, and severed his official connection with the Academy, although he continued to contribute to the exhibitions from 1783 until 1794.

His wife Ann Wright died on 17 August 1790, having borne six children from the marriage, three of whom had died in infancy. On 29 August 1797 Wright himself died at his new home at No. 28 Queen Street, Derby, where he had spent his final months with his two daughters.

== Career and works ==
Wright is seen at his best in his candlelit subjects of which the &quot;Three Persons Viewing the Gladiator by Candlelight&quot; (1765), his &quot;A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery&quot; (1766), in the Derby Museum and Art Gallery, and &quot;An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump&quot; (1768), in the National Gallery are excellent examples. His &quot;Old Man and Death&quot; (1774) is also a striking and individual production.

He painted &quot;Dovedale by Moonlight&quot;, capturing the rural landscape of a narrow valley called Dovedale, 14 miles northwest of Wright&#x27;s home town of Derby, at night with a full moon. The painting hangs in the Allen Memorial Art Museum at Oberlin College. Its companion piece, &quot;Dovedale by Sunlight&quot; () captures the colours of day. In another painting, &quot;Moonlight Landscape&quot;, in the John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art, Sarasota, Florida, equally dramatic, the Moon is obscured by an arched bridge over water, but illuminates the scene, making the water sparkle in contrast to the dusky landscape. Another memorable image from his tour of the Lake District is &quot;Rydal Waterfall&quot; of 1795.

&quot;Cave at Evening&quot; (above) is painted with the same dramatic chiaroscuro for which Wright is noted. The painting was executed during 1774, while he was staying in Italy. There are similarities to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston&#x27;s holding, &quot;Grotto by the Seaside in the Kingdom of Naples with Banditti, Sunset&quot; (1778).

=== Painting the British Enlightenment ===

Wright had close contact with the pioneering industrialists of the English Midlands. Two of his most important patrons were Josiah Wedgwood, credited with the industrialization of the manufacture of pottery, and Richard Arkwright, regarded as the creator of the factory system in the cotton industry. One of Wright&#x27;s students, William Tate, was uncle to the eccentric gentleman tunneller, Joseph Williamson, and completed some of Wright&#x27;s works after his death. Wright also had connections with Erasmus Darwin and other members of the Lunar Society, which brought together leading industrialists, scientists, and philosophers. Although meetings were held in or near Birmingham, Darwin, grandfather of Charles Darwin, lived in Derby, and some of the paintings by Wright, which are notable for their use of brilliant light on shade, are of, or were inspired by, Lunar Society gatherings.
&quot;A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery&quot; (1766) shows an early mechanism for demonstrating the movement of the planets around the Sun. The Scottish scientist James Ferguson (1710–1776) undertook a series of lectures in Derby in July 1762 based on his book &quot;Lectures on Select Subjects in Mechanics, Hydrostatics, Pneumatics, Optics &amp;c&quot;. (1760). To illustrate his lectures, Ferguson used various machines, models, and instruments. Wright may have attended these talks, especially as tickets were available from John Whitehurst, Wright&#x27;s close neighbour, a clockmaker and a scientist. Wright could have drawn on Whitehurst&#x27;s practical knowledge to learn more about the orrery and its operation.

&quot;An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump&quot; (1768) shows people gathered to observe an early experiment into the nature of air and its ability to support life.

&quot;The Alchemist in Search of the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; (1771) depicts the discovery of the element phosphorus by German alchemist Hennig Brand in 1669. A flask in which a large quantity of urine has been boiled down is seen bursting into light as the phosphorus, which is abundant in urine, ignites spontaneously in air.

These factual paintings are considered to also have metaphorical meaning, the bursting into light of the phosphorus in front of a praying figure signifying the problematic transition from faith to scientific understanding and enlightenment, and the various expressions on the figures around the bird in the air pump indicating concern over the possible inhumanity of the coming age of science.

These paintings represent a high point in scientific enquiry that began to undermine the power of religion in Western societies. Some ten years later, scientists would find themselves persecuted in the backlash to the French Revolution of 1789. Joseph Priestley, a member of the Lunar Society, left Britain in 1794 after his Birmingham laboratory was smashed and his house burned down by a mob objecting to his outspoken support for the French Revolution. In France, the chemist Antoine Lavoisier was executed by the guillotine at the height of the Terror. The politician and philosopher Edmund Burke, in his famous &quot;Reflections on the Revolution in France&quot; (1790), tied natural philosophers, and specifically Priestley, to the French Revolution; he later wrote in his &quot;Letter to a Noble Lord&quot; (1796) that radicals who supported science in Britain &quot;considered man in their experiments no more than they do mice in an air pump&quot;. In light of this comment, Wright&#x27;s painting of the bird in the air pump, completed more than twenty years earlier, seems particularly prescient.

It was against this background that Charles Darwin, grandson of Erasmus Darwin, would add to the conflict between science and religious belief, half a century later, with the publication of his book &quot;The Origin of Species&quot; in 1859.

== Memorials ==


Wright&#x27;s birthplace at 28 Irongate, Derby, is commemorated with a representation of an armillary sphere on the pavement nearby.

Joseph Wright was buried in the grounds of St Alkmund&#x27;s Church, Derby. The church was demolished in 1968 to make way for a major new section of the inner ring road cutting through the town centre, and its site now lies beneath the road. Wright&#x27;s remains were removed to Nottingham Road Cemetery. In 1997, his tombstone was placed at the side of Derby Cathedral, and in 2002, it was brought inside and wall-mounted in a prominent place near the well-visited memorial to Bess of Hardwick.

Wright&#x27;s name has been given to the sixth-form centre situated on Cathedral Row, Derby (not far from Iron Gate). The Joseph Wright Centre was opened in 2005 as the new flagship site for Derby College. The building is named after the eighteenth-century painter because his &quot;artwork captured the many scientific and technological advances of the Industrial Revolution.&quot;

In early 2013 Derby City Council and Derby Civic Society announced they would erect a blue plaque on his home at 27 Queen Street in Derby.

<text>Bewick Bridge (1767, Linton, Cambridgeshire – 15 May 1833, Cherry Hinton) was an English vicar and mathematical author.

In 1786, he was admitted as a sizar to study mathematics at Peterhouse, Cambridge, where he graduated as senior wrangler and won the Smith&#x27;s Prize in 1790.

In October 1790, he was ordained a deacon at Ely, and became a priest in 1792; in the same year he became a Fellow at Peterhouse, during which he spent time as both as college moderator and as proctor. From 1806 until 1816, he was Professor of Mathematics at the East India Company College, Haileybury. He wrote a number of mathematical texts: his &quot;Algebra&quot; achieved international circulation. He became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1812.

From 1816 until 1833, he was vicar of Cherry Hinton in Cambridge, where in 1818 he built the vicarage, and he founded the village school in 1832 (now a Church of England PrimarySchool). He died on 15 May 1833, aged 66. In September 2011 the Cherry Hinton Community Junior School was named after Bewick, becoming Bewick Bridge Community Primary School.

<doc id="389757" wikidata="Q2560190" url="?curid=389757" title="Alston, Cumbria">
<text>Alston is a town in Westmorland and Furness, Cumbria, England, within the civil parish of Alston Moor. It is located at about above sea level in the North Pennines, the River South Tyne, and shares the title of &#x27;highest market town in England&#x27;, with Buxton, Derbyshire. Despite its relative isolation, the town has road connections to the Tyne Gap to the north, Weardale and Teesdale to the south-east, and Penrith to the south-west.

Much of the town centre is a designated conservation area which includes several listed buildings. It was historically within the county of Cumberland. Alston was historically a centre for mining, with lead, zinc, iron, copper, and coal found in the vicinity.

==Geography==

Alston lies within the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, more than by road from the nearest town, Haltwhistle, and is surrounded by moorland. Nearby villages include Garrigill and Nenthead. It is around west of Newcastle upon Tyne, south east of Carlisle, north east of Penrith, and south west of Hexham.

Situated at the crossroads/junction of the A686, A689 and B6277, the town lies on the confluence of the River South Tyne and the River Nent. On 18 May 2013 very heavy rain resulted in flooding in seven areas of Alston, affecting thirty-six properties. The Environment Agency records indicate that 51mm of rain fell that day.

The landscape of the area is built up from limestone, sandstone and shale. The area is rich in minerals, in particular lead deposits, and the landscape has been heavily influenced by the effects of varying methods of mining over the centuries.

==History==

===Early settlements===
The earliest evidence of population in the area comes from pottery fragments, a gold basket-earring and flint tools found in one of two barrows located NNW of Alston at Kirkhaugh. Excavated in 1935, the barrows were dated between 2000 BC and 1700 BC.

Evidence of Roman activity in the area comes from the earth ramparts of Whitley Castle, thought to be the Roman fort (Castra) of Epiacum built and rebuilt by the Sixth and Twentieth Legions between the 2nd and 3rd centuries. The fort lies on the Maiden Way Roman road which runs north from Kirkby Thore (Bravoniacum) to Carvoran (Magnae) on Hadrian&#x27;s Wall. Whitley Castle would have guarded this central supply route to Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, and may also have helped protect lead and silver deposits in the upper reaches of the South Tyne valley.

The name of the town is recorded in 1164–71 as Aldeneby and in 1209 as Aldeneston, and seems to mean &quot;the settlement or farmstead belonging to [a Viking man named] Halfdan&quot;.

===Sovereignty===
In the 10th century, Alston Moor was part of the Liberty of Tynedale, which was an estate of the Scottish Kings within England, a situation that resulted in many years of confusion over the sovereignty of the area.

In 1085, the Barons de Veteriponte became the first recorded Lords of the Manor; they held the moor on behalf of the kings of Scotland while the kings of England retained the mineral rights. This was confirmed in a hearing during 1279 that concluded that the miners of the area were distinct from the local population, thus paying their dues to the English crown instead of to Scotland. As a result, the miners lived in their own self-regulated communities under English protection.

In 1296 John de Balliol, the king of Scotland, invaded the North of England; as a result Edward I moved to reclaim the Scottish estates and Tynedale, which included Alston Moor, was taken under direct control of the English crown where it remains.

Despite the town being on the Tyne and being historically part of Tynedale, the area has never been part of either Hexhamshire or Northumberland but part of Cumberland and later Cumbria. This was probably because the mines in the area were at one time administered from Carlisle.

===Mining===
Historically the area has been mined for lead, zinc, iron, copper, and coal. The nearby Roman fort of Whitley Castle (Epiacum) may in part have been sited to control and protect the lead mines there.

In the 13th century, the area was known as the silver mines of Carlisle — silver was found in a high proportion (up to 40 troy ounces per long ton or 1.2 g/kg of smelted lead) and was used to create coinage in the Royal Mint established in Carlisle for the purpose. Most mining was very small scale until the mid-18th century, with 119 lead mines in the parish of Alston in 1768.

The biggest mine owner in the area was the London Lead Company; this Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) organisation with enlightened employment policies established an interest in the area during the early 18th century. In 1745, it began construction of a school, a library, a sanitary house, a surgeon&#x27;s house, a market hall with clock tower, a laundry and a &#x27;ready-money&#x27; shop in Nenthead, away.

Many of the last mines closed in the 1950s. A small drift coal mine (Ayle Colliery) is still active today.

==Governance==
Alston is in the parliamentary constituency of Penrith and Solway. Markus Campbell-Savours was elected its Labour Member of Parliament (MP) at the 2024 general election.

Before the United Kingdom left the European Union, its residents voted to elect Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) for the North West England constituency.

For Local Government purposes Alston is in the Westmorland and Furness unitary authority. Until 1 April 2023 it was in the &quot;Alston Moor Ward&quot; of Eden District Council and the &quot;Alston and East Fellside Division&quot; of Cumbria County Council.

Alston does not have its own parish council, instead it is part of Alston Moor Parish Council.

==Modern economy==
The area is no longer actively mined for precious metals although the mining history has been exploited for tourism purposes. There are few jobs in the immediate area, hence the fall in population from 6,858 in 1841 to 1,128 today.

===Farming===
The surrounding moorland is mainly used for sheep farming; however many farmers also have other enterprises, such as bed and breakfast accommodation. During winter months farming can be tough, due to the severe weather in the area.

===Tourism===
Tourism is now an important source of income for the area. The largest attraction is a narrow-gauge railway and heritage centre at South Tynedale Railway. Alston and the surrounding area is part of the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) and European Geopark. Alston is noted for its cobbled streets and 17th-century stone buildings. The area&#x27;s mining heritage has been referenced for tourism purposes across the North Pennines. Nenthead Mines, at the nearby village of Nenthead, is a Scheduled Monument managed by volunteers. The Nenthead Mines Conservation Society hold regular open days where visitors can learn about the history of lead mining and take an underground tour of Carrs Mine. The Pennine Way, the UK&#x27;s first National Trail, passes by the edge of Alston and the Sea to Sea Cycle Route (C2C) passes through the town.

===Shops and facilities===
Shops include a whole foods shop, a Co-op supermarket, a Spar convenience store, a shop selling hardware, a post office, an outdoor clothing shop, an organic bakery, a charity shop and a number of craft, gift and antique shops.

There are four pubs in Alston, and the town also has a number of cafés, a food take-away, a specialist engraving company, two hotels, numerous B&amp;Bs, two petrol stations, a gym, an estate agent and a hairdressers. A once-popular fish and chip shop closed down in November 2022.

The last remaining bank, Barclays, closed in December 2015.

Steam trains on the narrow-gauge South Tynedale Railway run from April to October, offering a short journey through pleasant scenery.

===Metal working===
For much of the 20th century, between 1940 and its closure in 1980, a foundry employed around 200 people. The closure of this foundry increased unemployment in the area from 8.9% to over 25%.

Currently the area&#x27;s main employer is Bonds Precision Castings Limited, a company that took over Precision Products in 2008. Precision Products was started in 1947 by William George Ball. Bonds Precision Casting Ltd. produces stainless steel and super-alloy castings.

==Population==
The population census figures show that at its peak during 1831 the population of the parish of Alston Moor was 6,858 people. Today that figure is about 1,200. The population of the town of Alston was 1,128 according to the 2001 Census. The community has its own website which is a result of the Cybermoor Project (cybermoor.org), which has brought the Internet to almost every home on Alston Moor, and broadband to many. This allowed people with little or no education access to online courses and training. The problem of the area&#x27;s relative remoteness compared to other areas of England was solved by utilising IEEE 802.11 technology to construct the network infrastructure.

==Notable residents==

==Landmarks and buildings of note==

===Town hall===

Alston Town Hall is a focal point for the community, being a venue for many local social events. It also contains the tourist information centre and the public library. The Gothic Revival style building, which was commissioned by the local metallurgist and businessman Hugh Lee Pattinson, was completed in 1858.

===Alston High Mill===
High Mill in the Cumbrian town of Alston was built in 1767 as a water-driven corn mill by the renowned engineer John Smeaton; Smeaton is famously known for his Eddystone Lighthouse.

The grade II listed High Mill has been through a number of alterations through the ages, but the original Smeaton design is still easily recognisable. Internally there is little left of the original building besides the water wheel and the pit wheel.

In July 2023, the High Mill and the adjoining factory building (once occupied by Bonds Precision Casting) was purchased by a private owner, and work is now underway to refurbish and restore the mill for use as an arts and crafts workshop. The building and mill wheel are Grade II listed, and part of the mill may be given over to a small museum showcasing the wheel and some of the artefacts associated with how it was used.

===Market cross===
Although the town does not hold a regular market it still maintains the legal right to do so. The market cross, which acts as a focal point in the centre of town, was constructed in 1981 to replace one which was demolished by a wagon in January 1980. That earlier cross had itself replaced a cross of 1883 which was knocked down by a lorry in 1968.

A regular producers&#x27; market now takes place in the town hall from April to September selling food and crafts produced in Cumbria, Northumberland and County Durham, celebrating Alston&#x27;s position at the crux of these three counties.

===St Augustine of Canterbury Church===

The parish church was built in 1869 on the site of two earlier churches. Despite being in Cumbria the church is in the Diocese of Newcastle rather than the Diocese of Carlisle. The church spire was only completed in 1886. A unique item in the church is a clock which belonged to James Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Derwentwater, who was beheaded for treason. It is believed to be of 16th-century origin, and was restored in 1978.
One of the church bells which was cast in 1714 also belonged to the Earl of Derwentwater. It was installed in the previous church of 1770. Four of the bells were installed in memory of Andrew Graham Stavert Steele, churchwarden from 1943 until his murder in the Midland Bank on 13 September 1949. The bells cannot be pealed as the tower is not strong enough, but they are struck by a clapper.

===Clarghyll Hall===
Clarghyll Hall, north of Alston, is a Grade II* listed fortified manor house dating back to the 16th century. It was formerly the home of the Whitfield family and from 1847 to 1889 the home of Rev. Octavius James, who extended the building to add a chapel and study. This new wing burned down in a fire in 1889 in which Rev James died.

===Nent Force level===
During the area&#x27;s peak of prosperity in 1776 John Smeaton began construction of an underground drain (the &quot;Nent Force Level&quot;) to de-water the mines of the Nent Valley and assist with the transport of extracted materials as well as to locate new mineral seams. The canal took 66 years to construct at a cost of £80,000, and became known as &quot;Smeaton&#x27;s Folly&quot;. In the 1830s mine manager and engineer said that it could be visited &quot;in boats 30 feet in length, which are propelled in four feet of water by means of sticks projecting from the sides of the level; and thus may be enjoyed the singular novelty of sailing a few miles underground&quot;. It was intended to be 9 feet square but in the softer terrain was extended to 9&#x27;×16&#x27;, dead level for to allow boat use, with a rise of 35 fathoms ( at Lovelady Shield and then driven into the Nenthead ground. The amount of ore found was disappointing, though not insignificant.

Access to the Nent Force Level is currently extremely difficult although efforts have been made to develop a heritage centre to make this extraordinary piece of engineering accessible to the public.

===Samuel King&#x27;s School===
As well as having a primary school, the town is host to England&#x27;s smallest secondary school (an 11–16 comprehensive), Samuel King&#x27;s School. Samuel King&#x27;s serves the local communities such as Nenthead and Garrigill. Alston Moor has a second small primary school at Nenthead.

==Media==
Local TV coverage is provided by BBC North East and Cumbria and ITV Tyne Tees. Television signals are received from the local relay transmitter which is transmitted via the Pontop Pike transmitter, it is situated north east of the town. Local radio stations are BBC Radio Cumbria, Greatest Hits Radio Cumbria &amp; South West Scotland, and community based station Eden FM Radio which broadcast from its studios in Penrith. The town&#x27;s local newspapers are &quot;Cumberland and Westmorland Herald&quot; and &quot;The Westmorland Gazette&quot;. 

==Other Media==
===Filming locations===
Front Street and the Market Cross of the town were used as filming locations in a 1997 adaptation of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;. The town was also adapted to resemble a seaside village where Oliver is born for the 1999 ITV mini series &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;.

=== The League of Gentlemen ===
The fictional town of Royston Vasey, the setting of the TV comedy series &quot;The League of Gentlemen&quot;, is based on Alston.

===Demographic imbalance===
In August 2005, Alston made news regarding the town&#x27;s apparent lack of women, with a claimed ratio of 10 men to every woman in the town. A group of young men from Alston, led by Vince Peart, set up the &quot;Alston Moor Regeneration Society&quot; to persuade women to come to Alston. Articles appeared in &quot;the Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot; and the BBC. A documentary was shown on Channel 4 on 11 October 2006. More than two years later, the &quot;Guardian&quot; reported that Alston shared first position with Bere Alston in Devon in the top 10 list of places in Britain where the imbalance was at its worst.

==Transport==
The area is stationed on a number of routes including the long−distance footpath the Pennine Way, and the Sea to Sea (C2C) Cycle Route. Alston railway station was formerly the terminus of a branch line from Haltwhistle. The town&#x27;s rail link to Haltwhistle was completed in 1852 by the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway Company. The closure of the line was decided in the Beeching Report in 1963, but closure was rejected due to lack of a direct road link. After a road was built, closure was again proposed in 1973 and the line closed on 1 May 1976. It was the last enacted closures of the Beeching Report (another being the Bridport branch line from Bridport to Maiden Newton in Dorset which closed in 1975).

Part of the route, between Alston and Slaggyford, five miles in length, is now operated as the narrow gauge South Tynedale Railway. The railway is particularly popular with tourists and passenger trains operate between April and October, with Santa Special trains operating on certain dates in December each year.

Go North East operates two buses a day between Alston and Haltwhistle, where connections can be made to buses and trains to Carlisle and Newcastle. Wright Brothers Coaches operates an bus route linking Newcastle with Keswick via Hexham, Haydon Bridge, Alston and Penrith from July to September each year. There are term-time bus services to Carlisle primarily for college students.

==Climate==
This town has a cool and relatively rainy oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;, according to the Köppen climate classification), with mild summers and chilly winters, with snowfalls. It is one of the coldest inhabited places in England.

There are some ski-tows on the northwest slopes of Burnhope Seat, a hill situated away from Alston. This forms the Yad Moss ski facility, which has been upgraded by Sport England.

Alston holds the record for the lowest temperature reported in Cumbria. The temperature fell to on 17 January 1881. Additionally, the town also holds the record for the lowest temperature ever reported on 7 March in the United Kingdom, at in 1886. This was also the coldest temperature reported anywhere in the United Kingdom in 1886. The town also reported the coldest temperature in the UK in 1883, at on 15 March of that year. Furthermore, Alston also holds the record for highest temperature reported in the UK on 8 November, at in 1881.

<text>Chagford is a market town and civil parish on the north-east edge of Dartmoor, in Devon, England, close to the River Teign and the A382, 4 miles (6 km) west of Moretonhampstead. The name is derived from &quot;chag&quot;, meaning gorse or broom, and the &quot;ford&quot; suffix indicates its importance as a crossing place. At the 2021 census, it had a population of 1,539, which was slightly more than the 1,449 recorded at the 2011 census.

==History==
Archaeological remains confirm that a community has existed here for at least 4000 years. In historical times, Chagford grew due to the wool trade and from tin mining in the area. A weekly market was held here from before 1220, and a monthly livestock market in the town survived until the 1980s. In 1305 it was made a stannary town where tin was traded. Among the most prominent tin-mining families in the 16th century were the Endecotts, Knapmans, Whiddons and Lethbridges.

In an English Civil War skirmish Sidney Godolphin, the poet and Royalist MP for Helston, was shot and killed in the porch of the Three Crowns.

In 1987, the &quot;New Scientist&quot; reported that Chagford contained &quot;the most radioactive loo in the world&quot;, a reference to the high levels of Radon gas in this granite area.

===Historic estates===
The parish of Chagford comprises historic estates including:
*Whiddon, seat of the Whiddon family. Sir John Whiddon (d.1576), a Justice of the King&#x27;s Bench under Queen Elizabeth I, purchased the manor of Chagford, built a new manor house at Whiddon, part of which survives today, and built a deer park, the massive granite block wall of which survives today.

==Today==

Today Chagford is a thriving community with high property prices, busy streets, and an unusually wide range of shops for a town of this size, although not immune to national trends having lost its two banks and seen its post office downgraded. Two large hardware stores side by side in the town square were run by the same two families for over a century, but one of these closed in 2017. It is also known for its arts community, celebrated through Chagfilm (the autumn Chagford Film Festival), Chagword (the springtime literary festival, every two years from 2013-2019), Chagstock (the summer music festival, annually from 2007-2022), Wonderworks (the annual crafts weekend), the popular Summer Music Series (free Friday lunchtime concerts in the church throughout the summer), and other regular cultural events. There are several tea rooms and whole food cafés and four pubs. There is a good selection of holiday accommodation in and around the town for the influx of visitors during the year.

The early 20th century Edwin Lutyens house Castle Drogo lies 2 miles away, in Drewsteignton parish, and overlooks Chagford.

==Climate==
Chagford has a very wet Temperate oceanic climate (Cfb) - given its location on Dartmoor, it is noticeably wetter compared to lower-lying areas in Devon such as Exeter and Exmouth. On average, the town received 1,425mm of rainfall circa 1981-2010.

==Governance==
The town has a parish council which meets monthly.

In 1976 Chagford was twinned with Bretteville-sur-Laize, France. Regular twinning activity was sustained for over 20 years, but lapsed. Chagford retains its &quot;Bretteville Close&quot;, and Bretteville its &quot;Rue de Chagford&quot;.

==Landmarks==
A 16th-century building called Endecott House, on the edge of the town square, was given this name in the early 1990s in acknowledgment of a 17th-century governor of Massachusetts Bay Colony, John Endecott, who is thought to have been born in or near Chagford. This building was possibly built as a &quot;church house&quot;, and has certainly been in community use for many years, including use as a village school. It now serves as a meeting hall.

One of the social centres of Chagford is the village hall, the Jubilee Hall, in the south-east corner of the town next to the public car park. Built in 1936 by public subscription, it was significantly extended between 2016 and 2018 and also houses the library (which opens three part-days a week) and a local history resource centre. It provides a venue for the regular Friday morning flea markets as well as other activities such as badminton, table tennis, parties, discos, comedy nights, kung fu, Pilates, etc.

The Three Crowns Hotel dates to the 13th century and is reportedly haunted by the ghost of the cavalier poet, Sidney Godolphin, who was fatally wounded there in the English Civil War.

The former Easton Court Hotel became popular with authors as a writers&#x27; retreat in the 1930s, 40s and 50s, and was where Evelyn Waugh completed A Handful of Dust in 1933 and Brideshead Revisited in 1944.

==Religion==

The Anglican parish church of St Michael the Archangel was dedicated in 1261 (originally Roman Catholic church), although little remains from this period. The tower dates back to the 15th century. The Grade I listed building was restored in 1865 and extended during the 20th century. It features carved roof bosses, similar to those found at St. Pancras&#x27; church, Widecombe-in-the-Moor, including the tin miners&#x27; emblem of three hares.

The churchman-ship has traditionally been Broad-high church. 
Chagford forms part of a &quot;united benefice&quot; of seven ecclesiastical parishes, known as The Whiddon Parishes of Dartmoor, the others being Throwleigh, Gidleigh, Drewsteignton, Spreyton, Hittisleigh and South Tawton.

A Wesleyan Chapel (est. 1834) was replaced by a Methodist church built in 1861; it closed in the 1990s and is now in secular use. Victorian era directories list a Baptist church (established 1829), but long since disappeared. However, the Bible Christian Chapel (est. 1844) continues to flourish as Chagford Gospel Church, and a purpose-built Roman Catholic church was founded in 1963.

==The Legend of Mary Whiddon==
St Michael&#x27;s church contains a memorial to Mary Whiddon, dated 11 October 1641 or 1647 (the inscription is unclear), whose death is thought to have been one of the inspirations behind an episode in R.D. Blackmore&#x27;s novel, &quot;Lorna Doone&quot;. Although his novel is set on Exmoor, the author may have been moved by a local legend about Mary who, it is claimed, was shot dead on her wedding day as she came out of church. The climax of Lorna Doone involves such a shooting, but in that case the heroine survives.

Whether this actually happened is unclear. Mary&#x27;s tomb records that she died &quot;a matron, yet a maid&quot; (&quot;a married woman, yet a virgin&quot;). On the other hand, &quot;maid&quot; is a common term in Devon for a &quot;girl&quot; and the inscription may just mean that Mary died young (&quot;although married, still just a girl&quot;). The church&#x27;s Marriage and Burial registers for the Civil War period are lost, and the only contemporaneous record is Mary Whiddon&#x27;s undated will. It mentions no husband, but as her maiden name is also thought to have been Whiddon (i.e. she married a cousin), it might have been written before her marriage.

In the 21st century, a tradition has developed whereby new brides at the church lay a bouquet of flowers on Mary&#x27;s memorial. This ritual is aimed at bringing good luck in the forthcoming marriage.

The ghost of Mary Whiddon is said to haunt Whiddon Park House, 2 miles outside the town.

==Sports==
Chagford&#x27;s War Memorial Playing Fields were redeveloped in the late 1980s to provide a cricket ground to the south west of the town, overlooked by a modern clubhouse. In the winter, the ground provides two football pitches for the football club. There are public tennis courts in the town, with an associated Tennis Club, and an open-air swimming pool. A popular local running race, the Two Hills race takes place in Chagford every May, a 5k race starting from the cricket club and going up and around Meldon and Nattadon Hills, which are to the south of Chagford.

<text>Vítězslav Augustín Rudolf Novák (5 December 1870 – 18 July 1949) was a Czech composer and academic teacher at the Prague Conservatory. Stylistically, he was part of the neo-romantic tradition, and his music is considered an important example of Czech modernism. He worked towards a strong Czech identity in culture after the country became independent in 1918. His compositions include operas and orchestral works.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Novák (baptized Viktor Novák) was born in Kamenice nad Lipou, a small town in Southern Bohemia. In 1872 the family moved to Počátky, where Novák first studied the violin with Antonín Šilhan and the piano with Marie Krejčová. After the death of his father in 1882, the family moved to Jindřichův Hradec, where Novák continued his studies at grammar school . An elementary school in the town is named after Novák today. In his late teens, he moved to Prague to study at the Prague Conservatory, changing his name to Vítězslav to identify more closely with his Czech identity, as many of those of his generation had already done. At the conservatory, he studied piano and attended Antonín Dvořák&#x27;s masterclasses in composition where his fellow students included Josef Suk, Oskar Nedbal, and Rudolf Karel. When Dvořák departed for his three-year stay in America (1892–1895), Novák continued his studies with the ultra-conservative Karel Stecker. However, just before and after 1900, shortly after his graduation, Novák wrote a series of compositions that put distance between himself and the teachings of both Stecker and Dvořák, edging his style toward the fledgling modernist movement.

Beginning in the late 1890s, Novák began to explore influences beyond the prevailing Wagner/Brahms aesthetic of his contemporaries in Prague. Among these were folk influences from Moravia and Slovakia, which at that time were considered culturally backward in the cosmopolitan Czech capital. He also developed an interest in what would come to be called musical Impressionism, although in later life he denied any exposure to the music of Debussy at this time, claiming instead to have arrived at similar techniques on his own. These included forays into bitonality and non-functional, parallel harmony. Finally, after the Prague premiere of &quot;Salome&quot; in 1906, Novák formed an attachment to the music of Richard Strauss that would remain for the rest of his career.

===Musicology and feud===
Shortly after the turn of the century, Novák began teaching composition privately in Prague. From 1909 to 1920, he taught at the Prague Conservatory himself, and this occasionally occupied him to a greater degree than composing. Among his students were Alois Hába, Iša Krejčí, Vítězslava Kaprálová, Ladislav Vycpálek, Otakar Jeremiáš and Stefania Turkewich. During the same period, several events affected Novák&#x27;s outlook on musical expression and artistic freedom. From 1901 to 1917, his apartment hosted a discussion group known as the &quot;Podskalská filharmonie&quot;. While most of its members were musicians, including Suk, Karel, and the conductor Václav Talich, performances were confined to readings of new modernist works from abroad and the group&#x27;s goals were primarily intellectual; the &quot;Filharmonie&quot; served, however, as an important place for this group of Czech modernists to share their ideas. By regulation, its only female member was Marie Prášková, whom Novák married in 1912. That same year, Novák became embroiled in a series of culturo-political battles in Prague between his Conservatory-based faction and that of Zdeněk Nejedlý, a critic and musicologist at Prague University. When Novák signed a protest against Nejedlý&#x27;s anti-Dvořák propaganda, Nejedlý engaged in fierce criticism of Novák&#x27;s music. The impact of this criticism on Novák was long-lasting and ushered in a crisis in his creative life.

===Political affairs===
Upon the independence of Czechoslovakia in 1918, Novák turned his focus toward the administration of culture in the new democratic regime. In this capacity, he led the push toward de-Germanification and nationalization of the Conservatory, during which process his German-Bohemian colleagues, including Alexander Zemlinsky and Paul Nettl, were forced out to form a segregated institution. Novák became the new administrative head of the Czech-only institution and held various titles, alternating with Suk and others, until his retirement. During this period he continued to teach composition in the form of masterclasses, thereby influencing a new interwar generation of musicians, despite the increasing conservatism of his compositions in the 1920s.

===Renewal and death===

In the 1930s, Novák went through a period of artistic renewal with the premieres of some large-scale compositions. After the collapse of democracy and the subsequent Nazi protectorate in 1939, Novák, then retired, gained credibility among his younger Czech contemporaries through the performance of several patriotic and morale-boosting works, meant as a musical form of resistance. After the Second World War, he wrote a lengthy memoir, entitled &quot;O sobě a jiných&quot; (Of Myself and Others, publ. 1970), in which he aired many of his long-standing grudges, especially toward his main rival, Otakar Ostrčil, but also even his close friend Josef Suk. He died in Skuteč in Eastern Bohemia, where he had spent much of his last years.

==Compositional career==
Novák&#x27;s music retained at least some elements of the late-Romantic style until his death. His earliest work to receive an opus number was a piano trio in G minor, but it was preceded, in order of composition, by several works including an unpublished serenade in B minor for piano dating from 1886 to 1887; all of these bear the influences of Schumann and Grieg. In his earliest years after graduating from Prague Conservatory, his work began to show some influence from Moravian and Slovak folk music, which he began to collect and study in the late 1890s. Within the decade he had assimilated the basic intervallic and rhythmic characteristics of these folksongs into a very personal compositional style. The first works to reveal this change are the Second String Quartet, op. 35 (1905), and the path-breaking solo piano work, &quot;Sonata Eroica&quot;, op. 24 (1900).

The next influence was that of French impressionism, which first appears in the song cycle &quot;Melancholie&quot;, op. 25, composed in 1901, and is most apparent in the tone poem &quot;O věčné touze&quot; (Of the Eternal Longing, op. 33, completed 1905). Meanwhile, the more monumental aspects of his style, evident in the Slovak-inspired tone poem &quot;V Tatrách&quot; (In the Tatras, op. 26, 1902) and the song cycle &quot;Údolí nového království&quot; (Valley of the New Kingdom, op. 31, 1903) combined with his discovery of the music of Strauss: the result was the tone poem, &quot;Toman a lesní Panna&quot; (Toman and the Wood Nymph, op. 40, completed 1907).

The height of his compositional career was considered, including in the criticism of the day, to consist of two principal achievements, both completed in 1910: &quot;Pan&quot;, the five-movement tone poem for piano solo (totalling some sixty pages of music, op. 43), and &quot;Bouře&quot; (The Tempest, op. 42, to a text by Svatopluk Čech). The latter was a grandiose symphonic cantata for soloists, chorus, and orchestra, running to just under an hour of unbroken music; its attention to musico-dramatic detail was evidence of Novák&#x27;s increasing interest in opera, a style in which he had not written at that point.

His conflict with Nejedlý brought about a sharp change in Novák&#x27;s attitude to composition, wherein fear of rejection became more important than artistic exploration. The negative response from the public to the orchestrated version of &quot;Pan&quot; (1912) and the next cantata, &quot;Svatební košile&quot; (&quot;The Wedding Shirt&quot;, 1913), based on the same Erben text as Dvořák&#x27;s more famous work) caused severe self-doubt and depression. Novák attempted to turn the situation around with two operas about Czech historical subjects, a transparently nationalist move during wartime. &quot;Zvíkovský rarášek&quot; (The Zvíkov Imp, 1915, a comedy based on Stroupežnický) and &quot;Karlštejn&quot; (Karlštejn castle, 1916, a more serious work based on Vrchlický) both met with mixed reviews, although the latter became a fixture in the repertoire of Czech opera houses through the mid-century. These works exemplified Novák&#x27;s tendency toward bitonality, latent in the early folksong work.

Czechoslovak independence in 1918 sparked several patriotic compositions, dedicated to the &quot;President-Liberator&quot; Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk and the Czechoslovak Legion. These democratic impulses led to a stylistic conservatism, such that the artistic experimentation of 1900–1916 all but disappeared. The two remaining operas, &quot;Lucerna&quot; (The Lantern, 1923, based on Jirásek), and &quot;Dědův odkaz&quot; (The grandfather&#x27;s legacy, 1926, based on Heyduk) met with predominantly negative criticism, and Novák developed extreme bitterness toward the cultural forces that opposed him, leading him toward reactionism.

With two ballet-pantomimes completed in 1928–29, &quot;Signorina Gioventù&quot; and &quot;Nikotina&quot;, Novák regained some of the respect he had lost among his colleagues; the layering of orchestral effects (including mixed meters and even references to tango) won him the approval of some younger composers, such as Iša Krejčí and Alois Hába. In the 1930s he returned to chamber music, but also large forms such as the epic choral/orchestral work, &quot;Podzimní symfonie&quot; (Autumn Symphony, op. 62, premiered 1934).

During the Nazi occupation, Novák rose again in the estimation of his compatriots as a result of his patriotic works: the symphonic poems with organ, &quot;De Profundis&quot; (op. 67, 1941) and &quot;Svatováclavský triptych&quot; (Saint Wenceslas Triptych, op. 70, 1942) and the &quot;Májová symfonie&quot; (May Symphony, op. 73, dedicated to Stalin as liberator of the Czechs and premiered after the war in 1945) demonstrate these sentiments. In his remaining years he was primarily engaged with choral works based on South-Bohemian folksong.

<text>Petworth is a town and civil parish in the Chichester District of West Sussex, England. It is located at the junction of the A272 east–west road from Heathfield to Winchester and the A283 Milford to Shoreham-by-Sea road.

The parish includes the settlements of Byworth and Hampers Green and covers an area of . Twelve miles (21 km) to the south west of Petworth along the A285 road lies Chichester and the south-coast. In 2001 the population of the parish was 2,775 persons living in 1,200 households of whom 1,326 were economically active. At the 2011 Census the population was 3,027.

==History==

The town is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as having 44 households (24 villagers, 11 smallholders and nine slaves) with woodland and land for ploughing and pigs and of meadows. At that time it was in the ancient hundred of Rotherbridge.

Petworth is the location of the 17th-century stately home Petworth House, the grounds of which (known as Petworth Park) were the work of Capability Brown. The house and its grounds are now owned and maintained by the National Trust.

In the early 17th century, the question of Petworth&#x27;s status as an honour or a town came up when the Attorney General charged William Levett of Petworth, Gent., son of Anthony Levett, with &quot;having unlawfully usurped divers privileges within the town of Petworth, which was parcel of the Honour of Arundel.&quot; William Levett&#x27;s son Nicholas became rector of Westbourne, West Sussex. Leconfield Hall, which was formerly Petworth Town Hall, was completed in 1793.

Another historic attraction in the town, Petworth Cottage Museum in High Street, is a museum of domestic life for poor estate workers in the town in about 1910. At that time the cottage was the home of Mrs. Cummings, a seamstress, whose drunkard husband had been a farrier in the Royal Irish Hussars and on the Petworth estate.

Petworth fell victim to bombing in the Second World War on 29 September 1942, when a lone German Heinkel He 111, approaching from the south over Hoes Farm, aimed three bombs at Petworth House. The bombs missed the house, but one bounced off a tree and landed on the Petworth Boys&#x27; School in North Street, killing 28 boys, the headmaster, Charles Stevenson, and assistant teacher Charlotte Marshall.

==Governance==
An electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward includes Fittleworth and Ebernoe with a total ward population as taken at the 2011 census of 4,742.

==Transport==
The railway line between Pulborough and Midhurst once had a station at Petworth, but the line was closed to passenger use in 1955, and finally to freight in 1966, though the station building survives as a bed and breakfast establishment.

Public transport access is currently provided by an hourly bus between Midhurst and Worthing, operated by Stagecoach South.

==Education==
Petworth Primary School is the only school in the town. The school is at the south of the town and takes pupils up until Year 6. Until 2008 the Herbert Shiner School took pupils in years 6, 7 and 8 before they moved on to Midhurst Grammar School but this closed when the new Midhurst Rother College was opened.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC South and ITV Meridian. Television signals are received from the Midhurst TV transmitter. Local radio stations are BBC Radio Sussex, Heart South, Greatest Hits Radio West Sussex, V2 Radio and Radio Kirdford, a community based station. The town is served by the local newspaper, &quot;Midhurst and Petworth Observer&quot;, which publishes on Thursdays.

==Culture==

The town&#x27;s amateur dramatics group is known as the Petworth Players, and their past productions have included &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;, and &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot;.

Petworth has also been the home to the Petworth Town Band for over 100 years.

Petworth House was one of the main locations for the 2014 Mike Leigh film &quot;Mr. Turner&quot;, which put Timothy Spall as the artist Turner in the actual locations where he painted in the early 19th century.

The Petworth Society was founded in 1974 to protect the character and amenities of the parishes of Petworth and Byworth.

Newlands House Gallery, a gallery of modern and contemporary art, photography and design, opened in 2020.

==Petworth Fair==

On 20 November (St. Edmund&#x27;s day) each year, the market square is closed off to traffic so that a fun fair can be held. This is the modern survival of an ancient custom. In earlier centuries the fair lasted several days and may have been wholly or partly held on a field on the south side of the town called fairfield. The &quot;London Gazette&quot; of November 1666 announced that a fair would not be held that year because of plague still infesting the county, and shows that the fair was then a nine-day event.

Local tradition tells of a lost charter for the fair, but this is myth because it was determined by travelling justices of King Edward I in 1275 that the fair, then lasting eight days, had already been in existence since time immemorial and no royal charter was needed. At that time tolls on stalls for the sale of cattle provided an income for the Lord of the Manor. The traders of Arundel claimed a right to sell their wares at the fair as Petworth was in the Honour of Arundel.
==Hamlets==
The village of Byworth in the parish is just to the east of Petworth, across the Shimmings valley.
Further east still, on the border with Fittleworth, is Egdean, which has a small church dedicated to St. Bartholomew.

==Twin towns==
Petworth is twinned with Ranville in Normandy, France and San Quirico d&#x27;Orcia in Tuscany, Italy.

<text>Stamford is a town and civil parish in the South Kesteven district of Lincolnshire, England. The population at the 2011 census was 19,701 and estimated at 20,645 in 2019. The town has 17th- and 18th-century stone buildings, older timber-framed buildings and five medieval parish churches. It is a frequent film location. In 2013 it was rated a top place to live in a survey by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. Its name has been passed on to Stamford, Connecticut, founded in 1641.

==History==

===Roman and Medieval Stamford===

The Romans built Ermine Street across what is now Burghley Park and forded the River Welland to the west of Stamford, eventually reaching Lincoln. They also built a town to the north at Great Casterton on the River Gwash. In 61 CE Boudica followed the Roman legion Legio IX Hispana across the river. The Anglo-Saxons later chose Stamford as the main town, being on a larger river than the Gwash.

The place-name Stamford is first attested in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, where it appears as &quot;Steanford&quot; in 922 and &quot;Stanford&quot; in 942. It appears as &quot;Stanford&quot; in the Domesday Book of 1086. The name means &quot;stony ford&quot;.

In 972 King Edgar made Stamford a borough. The Anglo-Saxons and Danes faced each other across the river. The town had grown as a Danish settlement at the lowest point that the Welland could be crossed by ford or bridge. Stamford was the only one of the Five Boroughs of the Danelaw not to become a county town. Initially a pottery centre making Stamford Ware, it had gained fame by the Middle Ages for its production of the woollen cloth known as Stamford cloth or haberget, which &quot;In Henry III&#x27;s reign... was well known in Venice.&quot;

Stamford was a walled town, but only a small portion of the wall remains. Stamford became an inland port on the Great North Road, the latter superseding Ermine Street in importance. Notable buildings in the town include the medieval Browne&#x27;s Hospital, several churches and the buildings of Stamford School, a public school founded in 1532.
A Norman castle was built about 1075 and apparently demolished in 1484. The site stood derelict until the late 20th century, when it was built over and now includes a bus station and a modern housing development. A small part of the curtain wall survives at the junction of Castle Dyke and Bath Row.

In 1333–1334, a group of students and tutors from Merton College and Brasenose Hall, dissatisfied with conditions at the university, left Oxford to found a rival college at Stamford. Oxford and Cambridge universities petitioned Edward III, and the King ordered the closure of the college and the return of the students to Oxford. MA students at Oxford were obliged to take an oath: &quot;You shall also swear that you will not read lectures, or hear them read, at Stamford, as in a University study, or college general.&quot; This remained in force until 1827. The site and limited remains of the former Brazenose College, Stamford, where Oxford secessionists lived and studied, now form part of Stamford School.

Stamford has been hosting an annual fair since the Middle Ages. It is mentioned in Shakespeare&#x27;s Henry IV, Part 2 (Act 3, Scene 2). Held in mid-Lent, it is now the largest street fair in Lincolnshire and among the largest in the country. On 7 March 1190, men at the fair who were preparing to go on the crusade led a pogrom, in which several of the Stamford Jews were killed, and the rest, who escaped with difficulty, were given refuge in the castle. Their houses, however, were plundered, and a great quantity of money was seized.

====Religious houses and hospitals====
Stamford&#x27;s importance and wealth in the Middle Ages meant that a number of religious houses and hospitals were established in or near the town. The monasteries and friaries were all closed at the Dissolution by 1539. Street names are indicative of their presence: Priory Road, Austin Street, Blackfriars Street etc.

Monasteries
*Benedictine Priory of St Leonard – certainly established by 1082 with the possibility of it having been founded originally in the 7th century. Part of the church still stands on Priory Road. 
*Priory of Austin Canons at Newstead, just east of Stamford. Originally founded as a hospital at the end of the 12th century it became a priory of Austin Canons in the 1240s. 
*Priory of St Michael – this was a nunnery established by an abbot of Peterborough in or before 1155 in Stamford Baron. It was a large establishment for about 40 nuns. In 1354 it was amalgamated with the Augustinian nunnery of Wothorpe which had been depopulated by plague. The reredorter is a Scheduled Monument.

Friaries
At least five orders of Friars were established within the town of Stamford from the 13th century onwards. 
*The Austin Friars established in the 1340s in a house near St Peter&#x27;s Gate on land formerly occupied by the Friars of the Sack. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1539 the land was eventually bought by the Cecil family of Burghley.
*The Dominican Friars probably arrived in the 1230s and were regularly supported with donations by the monarchy. The house was dissolved by 1539.
*The Franciscan Friars had a house - Greyfriars, Stamford - in the east suburb near St Paul&#x27;s gate.
*The Carmelite Friars founded about 1268 in the east part of the town. The friary is said to have been a magnificent structure, famous for its beautiful church.
*The Friars of the Sack or Brothers of Penitence – the sack referred to their clothes, made of sackcloth.

Hospitals

*Hospital of St John Baptist and St Thomas the Martyr on Stamford Bridge. This hospital was certainly in existence from 1323 until the eve of the Reformation.
*Hospital of St Giles This hospital, which was built just outside Stamford as it was intended for lepers and was certainly operating in the 14th century.
*Hospital of All Saints was founded in 1485 by William Browne, a wool merchant, for the support of two chaplains, and for the distribution of alms to twelve poor persons, who should pray for the soul of the founder. Browne&#x27;s Hospital is still used for this purpose.

===Tudor and Stuart Stamford===
By the early 1500s the wool and broadcloth industry in England, on which Stamford depended, had declined significantly. Stamford was sufficiently poor, financially and demographically, that in 1548 it had to amalgamate its eleven parishes into six and its population had reduced to 800.

However, by the second half of the 17th century, after almost 150 years of stagnation, the population started to increase. As Stamford emerged into the 17th century, leather and fibre working (in the widest sense; weavers, ropers and tailors) were the main activities along with wood and stone working.

In the 1660s the various efforts to make the River Welland navigable again were finally successful. Stamford then became a centre for the malting trade as the barley from nearby fenlands to the east and heathlands to the north and west could make its way more easily and cheaper to the town.

The Great North Road passed through Stamford. It had always been a halting town for travellers; Henry VIII, Queen Elizabeth, James I and Charles I all passed through and it had been a post station for the postal service journey in Elizabeth&#x27;s reign. By the later 17th century roads start to be used more for longer distance travelling. In 1663 an Act of Parliament was passed to set up turnpikes on the Great North Road, and this was to make a notable difference to Stamford&#x27;s fortunes in the following century.
During the English Civil War local loyalties were split. Thomas Hatcher MP was a Parliamentarian. Royalists used Wothorpe and Burghley as defensive positions. In the summer of 1643 the Royalists were besieged at Burghley on 24 July after a defeat at Peterborough on 19 July. The army of Viscount Campden was heavily outnumbered and surrendered the following day.

===Bull Run===

For over 600 years Stamford was the site of the Stamford bull run, held annually on 13 November, St Brice&#x27;s day, until 1839. Local tradition says it began after William de Warenne, 5th Earl of Surrey had seen two bulls fighting in the meadow beneath his castle. Some butchers came to part the combatants and one bull ran into the town. The earl mounted his horse and rode after the animal; he enjoyed the sport so much that he gave the meadow where the fight began to the butchers of Stamford, on condition that they continue to provide a bull to be run in the town every 13 November.

===Victorian period to 21st century===
The East Coast Main Line would have gone through Stamford, as an important postal town at the time, but resistance led to routing it instead through Peterborough, whose importance and size increased at Stamford&#x27;s expense.

During the Second World War, the area round Stamford contained several military sites, including RAF station, airborne encampments and a prisoner-of-war camp. Within the town, Rock House held the headquarters of Stanisław Sosabowski and the staff of the Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade. A memorial plaque was unveiled there in 2004. A 2,000lb bomb was dropped on St Leonard St on 31 October 1940, which never exploded. 1,000 people were evacuated, until 3 November 1940.

Stamford Museum occupied a Victorian building in Broad Street from 1980 until June 2011, when it succumbed to Lincolnshire County Council budget cuts. Some exhibits have been moved to a &quot;Discover Stamford&quot; space at the town library and to Stamford Town Hall.

==Governance==

There are three tiers of local government covering Stamford, at parish (town), district and county level: Stamford Town Council, South Kesteven District Council, and Lincolnshire County Council. The town council is based at Stamford Town Hall on St Mary&#x27;s Hill, which was built in 1779.

===Administrative history===
Stamford was an ancient borough. The original borough was entirely on the north bank of the River Welland, which was historically the boundary between Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire. South of the river was Stamford Baron in Northamptonshire. The Stamford constituency was enlarged in 1832 to also include the built-up part of Stamford Baron. In 1836 Stamford was reformed to become a municipal borough, at which point the municipal boundaries were adjusted to match the recently enlarged constituency.

After 1836 the borough therefore straddled Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire. When elected county councils were established in 1889 boroughs were no longer allowed to straddle county boundaries, and so the parts of the borough south of the river were transferred to Lincolnshire, with Kesteven County Council serving as the upper tier authority. Local government was reformed again in 1974, when Kesteven County Council was replaced by Lincolnshire County Council, and the borough of Stamford was abolished, with district-level functions passing to the new South Kesteven District Council. Stamford Town Council was established as a successor parish council in 1974, covering the area of the former borough.

Stamford&#x27;s town council has arms: &quot;Per pale dexter side Gules three Lions passant guardant in pale Or and the sinister side chequy Or and Azure&quot;. The three lions are the English royal arms, granted to the town by Edward IV for its part in the &quot;Lincolnshire Uprising&quot;. The blue and gold chequers are the arms of the De Warenne family, which held the manor here in the 13th century.

===Parliamentary representation===

Stamford belongs to the parliamentary constituency of Rutland and Stamford. The current MP is Alicia Kearns (Conservative).

Prior to the 2024 election, Stamford formed part of the Grantham and Stamford constituency. Previous MPs include Gareth Davies, who won the seat at the 2019 General Election and Nick Boles.

==Geography==
Stamford, on the bank of the River Welland, forms a south-westerly protrusion of Lincolnshire between Rutland to the north and west, Peterborough to the south, and Northamptonshire to the south-west. There have been mistaken claims of a quadripoint where four ceremonial counties – Rutland, Lincolnshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire – would meet at a point but the location actually has two tripoints some apart.

The River Welland forms the border between two historic counties: Lincolnshire to the north and Soke of Peterborough in Northamptonshire to the south.

In 1991, the boundary between Lincolnshire and Rutland (then part of Leicestershire) in the Stamford area was redrawn. It now mostly follows the A1 to the railway line. The conjoined parish of Wothorpe is in the city of Peterborough. Barnack Road is the Lincolnshire/Peterborough boundary where it borders St Martin&#x27;s Without.

The river downstream of the town bridge and some of the meadows fall within the drainage area of the Welland and Deepings Internal Drainage Board.

===Geology===
Much of Stamford is built on Middle Jurassic Lincolnshire limestone, with mudstones and sandstones.

The area is known for limestone and slate quarries. Cream-coloured Collyweston stone slate is found on the roofs of many Stamford stone buildings. Stamford Stone in Barnack has quarries at Marholm and Holywell. Clipsham Stone has two quarries in Clipsham.

===Palaeontology===
In 1968, a specimen of the sauropod dinosaur &quot;Cetiosaurus oxoniensis&quot; was found in the Williamson Cliffe Quarry, close to Great Casterton in adjacent Rutland. Some long, it is about 170 million years old, from the Aalenian or Bajocian era of the Jurassic period. It is one of the most complete dinosaur skeletons found in the UK and was installed in 1975 in the Leicester Museum &amp; Art Gallery.

==Economy==
Tourism is important to Stamford&#x27;s economy, as are professional law and accountancy firms. Health, education and other public-service employers also feature, notably a hospital (Stamford and Rutland Hospital), a large medical general practice, schools (some independent) and a further education college. Hospitality is provided by several hotels, licensed premises, restaurants, tea rooms and cafés.

The licensed premises reflect the history of the town. The &quot;George Hotel&quot;, &quot;Lord Burghley&quot;, &quot;William Cecil&quot;, &quot;Danish Invader&quot; and &quot;Jolly Brewer&quot; are among nearly 30 premises serving real ale. Surrounding villages and Rutland Water provide other venues and employment opportunities, as do several annual events at Burghley House.

===Retail===
The town centre&#x27;s major retail and service sector has many independent boutique stores and draws shoppers from a wide area. Several streets are traffic-free. Outlets include gift shops, eateries, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s outfitters, shoe shops, florists, hairdressers, beauty therapists and acupuncture and health-care services. Harrison &amp; Dunn, Dawson of Stamford, the &quot;George Hotel&quot; and The Crown Arts Centre are other popular places. Stamford has several hotels, coffee shops and restaurants. Its branch of the national jeweller F. Hinds can trace its history back to the clockmaker Joseph Hinds, who worked in Stamford in the first half of the 19th century. In the summer months, Stamford Meadows attract visitors.

The town has stores, supermarkets, three builders&#x27; merchants and several other specialist trade outlets and skilled trades such as roofers, builders, tilers etc. There are two car showrooms and a number of car-related businesses. Local services include convenience stores, post offices, newsagents and take-aways.

===Engineering===
South of the town is RAF Wittering, a main employer which was until 2011 the home of the Harrier. The base opened in 1916 as RFC Stamford. It closed in 1919, but reopened in 1924 under its present name.

The engineering company, largely closed since June 2018, is Cummins Generator Technologies (formerly Newage Lyon, then Newage International), a maker of electrical generators in Barnack Road. C &amp; G Concrete (now part of Breedon Aggregates) is in Uffington Road.

The Pick Motor Company was founded in Stamford in about 1898. A number of smaller firms — welders, printers and so forth — feature in collections of industrial units or more traditional premises in older, mixed-use parts of the town. Blackstone &amp; Co was a farm implement and diesel engine manufacturing company.

Stamford lies amidst some of England&#x27;s richest farmland and close to the famous &quot;double-cropping&quot; land of parts of the fens. Agriculture still provides a small, but steady number of jobs in farming, agricultural machinery, distribution and ancillary services.

===Media and publishing===
The &quot;Stamford Mercury&quot; claims to be &quot;Britain&#x27;s oldest continuously published newspaper title&quot;. The &quot;Mercury&quot; has been published since 1712 but its masthead formerly claimed it was established in 1695 and still has &quot;Britain&#x27;s Oldest Newspaper&quot;.

Local radio provision was shared between Peterborough&#x27;s Heart East (102.7 – Heart Peterborough closed in July 2010) and Greatest Hits Radio Midlands (formerly Rutland Radio) (a 97.4 transmitter on Little Casterton Road) from Oakham. Since March 2021, Rutland and Stamford Sound has been providing a locally based service via the internet. Other stations include BBC Radio Cambridgeshire (95.7 from Peterborough), and BBC Radio Lincolnshire (94.9). NOW Digital broadcasts from an East Casterton transmitter covering the town and Spalding, which provides the NOW Peterborough 12D multiplex (BBC Radio Cambridgeshire and Heart East).

Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC East Midlands and ITV Central. Stamford has a lower-power television relay transmitter, due to it being in a valley, which takes its transmission from Waltham, not Belmont. BBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire and ITV Yorkshire can be received from the Belmont transmitting station.

Local publishers include Key Publishing (aviation) and the Bourne Publishing Group (pets). &quot;Old Glory&quot;, a specialist magazine for steam power and traction engines, was published in Stamford.

==Landmarks==

Stamford was the first conservation area designated in England and Wales, under the Civic Amenities Act 1967. There are over 600 listed buildings in and around the town. 

St Leonard’s Priory is the oldest building in the town, founded by Wilfrid, tutor to the son of the Saxon King Oswy. The site retains Norman architectural features, including pillars and arches dating to around 1090, with a west front constructed circa 1150. 

Significant unlisted properties include the Corn Exchange in Broad Street which was completed in 1859.

The Industrial Revolution left Stamford largely untouched. Much of the centre was built in the 17th and 18th centuries in Jacobean or Georgian style. It is marked by streets of timber-framed and stone buildings using local limestone and by little shops tucked down back alleys. Several former coaching inns survive, their large doorways being a feature. The main shopping area was pedestrianised in the 1970s.

Near Stamford (but in the historical Soke of Peterborough) is Burghley House, an Elizabethan mansion, built by the First Minister of Elizabeth I, Sir William Cecil, later Lord Burghley. It is the ancestral seat of the Marquess of Exeter. The tomb of William Cecil is in St Martin&#x27;s Church, Stamford. The parkland of the Burghley Estate adjoins the town on two sides. It includes ancient trees, a population of fallow deer, and vistas designed by landscape architect &quot;Capability&quot; Brown. Another country house near Stamford, Tolethorpe Hall, hosts outdoor theatre productions by the Stamford Shakespeare Company.

Tobie Norris had a bell foundry in the town in the 17th century. His name is borne by a pub in St Paul&#x27;s Street.

==Transport==
===Railway===
The town is served by Stamford railway station, previously known as &quot;Stamford Town&quot; to distinguish it from the now closed Stamford East station in Water Street. The station building is a stone structure in Mock Tudor style, influenced by nearby Burghley House and designed by Sancton Wood.

Services are provided by two train operating companies:
* CrossCountry provides regular direct services to Leicester, and Stansted Airport, via and , on the Birmingham to Peterborough Line.
* East Midlands Railway operates a small number of services between , Peterborough and in the mornings and evenings, except on Sundays.

Trains to and from Peterborough pass through a short tunnel beneath St Martin&#x27;s High Street.

===Road===
Lying on the main north–south Ermine Street (now the Great North Road and the A1) from London to York and Edinburgh, Stamford hosted several Parliaments in the Middle Ages. The &quot;George Hotel&quot;, &quot;Bull and Swan&quot;, &quot;Crown&quot; and &quot;London Inn&quot; were well-known coaching inns. The town coped with heavy north–south traffic through its narrow streets until 1960, when a bypass was built to the west of the town. The old route is now the B1081, which has the only other road bridge over the Welland; this is a local bottleneck.

Until 1996, there were plans to upgrade the bypass to motorway standard, but these have been shelved. The Carpenter&#x27;s Lodge roundabout south of the town has been replaced by a grade-separated junction. The old A16, now the A1175 (Uffington Road) to Market Deeping, meets the northern end of the A43 (Kettering Road) in the south of the town.

===On foot===

Footbridges cross the Welland at the Meadows, some 200 metres upstream of the Town Bridge, and at the Albert Bridge 250 metres downstream.

The Jurassic Way runs from Banbury to Stamford. The Hereward Way runs through the town from Rutland to the Peddars Way in Norfolk, along the Roman Ermine Street and then the River Nene. The Macmillan Way heads through the town, finishing at Boston. Torpel Way follows the railway line, entering Peterborough at Bretton.

===Buses===
The town bus station occupies part of the old castle site in St Peter&#x27;s Hill.

Local bus services are operated by Delaine Buses, CentreBus, Blands and Peterborough City Council.
The main routes run to Peterborough, via Helpston or Wansford, and to Oakham, Grantham, Uppingham and Bourne. On Sundays and Bank Holidays, Peterborough City Council operates a route via Wittering/Wansford, Duddington/Wansford, Burghley House/Barnack/Helpston and Uffington/Barnack/Helpston.

There is a National Express coach service between London and Nottingham each day, including Sundays.

===Waterways===
Commercial shipping was carried along a canal from Market Deeping to warehouses in Wharf Road until the 1850s. This is no longer possible, due to abandonment of the canal and the shallowness of the river above Crowland. There is a lock at the sluice in Deeping St James, but it is not in use. The river was not conventionally navigable upstream of the Town Bridge.

==Education==
Stamford has five state primary schools: Bluecoat, St Augustine&#x27;s (RC), St George&#x27;s, St Gilbert&#x27;s and Malcolm Sargent, and the independent Stamford Junior School, a co-educational school for children aged two to eleven.

The one state secondary school is Stamford Welland Academy (formerly Stamford Queen Eleanor School), formed in the late 1980s from the town&#x27;s two comprehensive schools: Fane and Exeter. It became an academy in 2011. In April 2013, a group of parents announced an intention to establish a Free School in the town, but failed to receive government backing. Instead, the multi-academy trust that submitted the bid was invited to take over the running of the existing school.

Stamford School and Stamford High School are long-established independent schools with about 1,500 pupils between them. Stamford School for boys was founded in 1532, the High School for girls in 1877. They have run co-educational classes in the sixth form since 2000. Together with Stamford Junior School, they form the Stamford Endowed Schools.

Most of Lincolnshire still has grammar schools. In Stamford, their place was long filled by a form of the Assisted Places Scheme, providing state funding to send children to one of two independent schools in the town that were formerly direct-grant grammars. The national scheme was abolished by the 1997 Labour government. The Stamford arrangements remained in place as a protracted transitional arrangement. In 2008, the council decided no new places could be funded and the arrangement ended in 2012. The rest of South Kesteven, apart from Market Deeping, has the selective system.

Other secondary pupils travel to Casterton College or further afield to The Deepings School or Bourne Grammar School.

New College Stamford offers post-16 further education: work-based, vocational and academic; and higher education courses including BA degrees in art and design awarded by the University of Lincoln and teaching-related courses awarded by Bishop Grosseteste University. The college also offers a range of informal adult learning.

==Churches==

In the 2011 Census, less than 67 per cent of the population of Stamford identified themselves as Christian, over 25 per cent as of &quot;no religion&quot;.
Stamford has many current or former churches:
*All Saints&#x27; Church on Red Lion Square

<doc id="389777" wikidata="Q915" url="?curid=389777" title="Perm, Russia">
<text>Perm (, ; ; ), previously known as [[Yegoshikha|Yagoshikha]] (; 1723–1781) and Molotov (; 1940–1957), is the administrative centre of Perm Krai in the European part of Russia. It sits on the banks of the Kama River near the Ural Mountains, covering an area of . With over one million residents Perm is the 15th-largest city in Russia and the 5th-largest in the Volga Federal District. 

==Economy==
In 1723, a copper-smelting works was founded at the village of &quot;Yagoshikha&quot;. In 1781 the settlement of Yagoshikha became the town of &quot;Perm&quot;. Perm&#x27;s position on the navigable Kama River, leading to the Volga, and on the Siberian Route across the Ural Mountains, helped it become an important trade and manufacturing centre. It also lay along the Trans-Siberian Railway. Perm grew considerably as industrialization proceeded in the Urals during the Soviet period, and in 1940 was named &quot;Molotov&quot; in honour of Vyacheslav Molotov. In 1957 the city returned to its historical name.

Modern Perm is still a major railway hub and one of the chief industrial centers of the Urals region. The city&#x27;s diversified metallurgical and engineering industries produce equipment and machine tools for the petroleum and coal industries, as well as agricultural machinery. A major petroleum refinery uses oil transported by pipeline from the West Siberian oilfields, and the city&#x27;s large chemical industry makes fertilizers and dyes. The city&#x27;s institutions of higher education include the Perm A.M. Gorky State University, founded in 1916.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Perm&quot; is of Uralic etymology (Komi-Permyak: Перем, &quot;Perem&quot;; , &quot;Perym&quot;). Komi is a member of the Permic branch of the Uralic languages, which is also named for Perm. In Finnish and Vepsian &quot;perämaa&quot; means &quot;far-away land&quot;; similarly, in Hungarian &quot;perem&quot; means &quot;edge&quot; or &quot;verge&quot;. The geologic period of the Permian takes its name from the toponym.

==History==
Perm is located in the old Permiak area. Perm was first mentioned as the village of Yagoshikha () in 1647; however, the history of the modern city of Perm starts with the development of the Ural region by Tsar Peter the Great. Vasily Tatishchev, appointed by the Tsar as a chief manager of Ural factories, founded Perm together with another major centre of the Ural region, Yekaterinburg.

In the 19th century, Perm became a major trade and industrial centre with a population of more than 20,000 people in the 1860s, with several metallurgy, paper, and steamboat producing factories, including one owned by a British entrepreneur. In 1870, an opera theatre was opened in the city, and in 1871 the first phosphoric factory in Russia was built. In 1916, Perm State University—a major educational institution in modern Russia—was opened.


After the outbreak of the Russian Civil War, Perm became a prime target for both sides because of its munitions factories. It was heavily rumored from July–September 1918 that the Tsarina Alexandra Feodorovna and her four daughters were imprisoned at the perception and Berezine buildings. According to the file on the Tsar, the Grand Duchess Anastasia would have attempted to flee. On December 25, 1918, the Siberian White Army under Anatoly Pepelyayev (who acknowledged the authority of the Omsk Government of Aleksandr Kolchak), took Perm. On July 1, 1919, the city was retaken by the Red Army.

===Soviet period===
In the 1930s, Perm grew as a major industrial city with aviation, shipbuilding, and chemical factories built during that period. During the Great Patriotic War (World War II), Perm was a vital center of artillery production in the Soviet Union. During the Cold War, Perm became a closed city.

===Modern city===
The city is a major administrative, industrial, scientific, and cultural centre. The leading industries include machinery, defence, oil production (about 3% of Russian output), oil refining, chemical and petrochemical, timber and wood processing and the food industry.

On September 20, 2021, a mass shooting occurred at Perm State University, resulting in six fatalities and 47 injuries.

==Geography==

The city is located on the bank of the Kama River upon hilly terrain. The Kama is the main tributary of the Volga River and is one of the deepest and most picturesque rivers of Russia. This river is the waterway which grants the Ural Mountains access to the White Sea, Baltic Sea, Sea of Azov, Black Sea, and Caspian Sea. The Kama divides the city into two parts: the central part and the right bank part. The city stretches for along the Kama and across it. The city street grid parallels the Kama River, travelling generally east–west, while other main streets run perpendicularly to those following the river. The grid pattern accommodates the hills of the city where it crosses them.

Another distinguishing feature of the city&#x27;s relief is the large number of small rivers and brooks. The largest of them are the Mulyanka, the Yegoshikha, the Motovilikha (all are on the left bank of Kama River), and the Gayva (on the right bank).

===Climate===
Perm has a warm summer continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfb&quot;). Winters are long, snowy and quite cold. Summers are moderately warm with cool nights, although summers are shorter than winters. Due to its far inland location, there is a distinct lack of seasonal lag resulting in rapid cooling down of the warm weather as days get shorter. This results in September, October, and November being colder than May, April, and March, respectively.


==Administrative and municipal status==
Perm is the administrative centre of the krai and, within the framework of administrative divisions, it also serves as the administrative center of Permsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is, together with two rural localities, incorporated separately as the city of krai significance of Perm—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the city of krai significance of Perm is incorporated as Perm Urban Okrug.

===City divisions===


For administrative purposes, Perm is divided into seven city districts:
==Economy==
Perm has the largest industrial output among cities in the Urals, ahead of Yekaterinburg, Chelyabinsk and Ufa, although Perm has a smaller population than these. Thirty-five per cent of Perm Oblast&#x27;s industry is located in Perm. The largest industries in the city are electric power engineering, oil and gas refining, machine building, chemicals and petrochemicals, forestry processing, printing and food industry.

Several major industrial companies are located in Perm: Perm Motors and Aviadvigatel, major suppliers of engines to the Russian aircraft industry; rocket engine company Proton-PM, which will mass-produce the RD-191 engine for the upcoming Angara rocket family; electric engineering firms Morion JSC, Perm Scientific and Industrial Group, and Perm Electrical Engineering Plant; Russia&#x27;s largest exporter of cables and wires, JSC KAMKABEL; and oil and natural gas companies such as LUKoil-Perm Ltd. and LUKoilPernefteprodukt Ltd.

==Transportation==

Perm is an important railway junction on the Trans-Siberian Railway with lines radiating to Central Russia, the north part of the Urals, and the far east of Russia. Perm has two major railway stations, the historical Perm I and the modern Perm II. The Kama River is an important direct link between the European part of Russia to the sea ports on the White, Baltic, Azov, Black, and Caspian seas.

Perm is served by the international airport Bolshoye Savino, which is located southwest of the city.

Perm&#x27;s public transit network includes tram, bus, and city-railway routes. The formerly important trolleybus service was discontinued in July 2019.

===Proposed metro system===
The first plans for a &quot;Perm Metro&quot; system date back to the 1970s. A feasibility study was compiled in 1990, but economic difficulties during the decade prevented its final planning and construction. The plans were revitalised in the early 2000s, but a lack of funding hampered the project and plans were once again put on hold. Light rail has also been considered.

==Culture==

The Perm Opera and Ballet House is one of the best in Russia. There are many other theatres in Perm, including the Drama Theater, the Puppet Theatre, the Theatre for Young Spectators, the Theatre &quot;Stage Molot&quot;, and the &quot;mystical&quot; At the Bridge Theatre.

Among the cities museums and galleries, the Perm State Art Gallery is recognised for its outstanding collections of art, including paintings from 15th- to 18th-century art movements, and wooden sculptures from the region. It is housed in a notable early 19th-century structure, once an orthodox cathedral. The spire of the museum towers over the rest of Perm, as it is situated on the Komsomolsky Prospect. Perm is receiving attention from the development of the new Museum of Contemporary Art, Perm Museum of Contemporary Art (PERMM) which officially opened in March 2009.

The RAV Vast steel tongue drum was invented in Perm by Andrey Remyannikov. This instrument is unique in the tongue drum and handpan world because each note has multiple harmonic overtones that resonate with other notes in the drum. The sound consequently has long sustain and reverberation.

The Legend of Perm Bear or The Walking Bear is a sculpture depicting a walking bear, which is also shown on the city&#x27;s coat of arms. It is situated in the central part of the city on Lenin Street, in front of the Organ Concert Hall and close to the building of Legislative Assembly of Perm Krai. The author of the sculpture is Vladimir Pavlenko, a monumentalist sculptor from Nizhny Tagil, member of the Artists&#x27; Union of Russia and UNESCO International Association of Arts.

The Permyak Salty Ears is a sculpture and one of the most visited tourist attractions in Perm.

==Education==
Perm is a scientific centre. Some of the scientific institutes are combined in the Perm Scientific Center of the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

Perm is a home to several major universities including Perm State University, Perm State Technical University, Perm branch of state university Higher school of economics, Perm State Teachers&#x27; Training University, Perm State Medical Academy, Perm State Pharmaceutical Academy, Perm State Agricultural Academy, The Institute of Art and Culture, Perm State Choreographic School, and others. There are also three military schools in Perm.

==Demographics==

At the time of the official 2010 Census, the ethnic makeup of the city&#x27;s population whose ethnicity was known (907,955) was:
==Sports==
The city hosted 2002 European Amateur Boxing Championships.

<doc id="389779" wikidata="Q505580" url="?curid=389779" title="Kenneth Anger">
<text>Kenneth Anger (born Kenneth Wilbur Anglemyer, February 3, 1927 – May 11, 2023) was an American underground experimental filmmaker, actor, and writer. Working exclusively in short films, he produced almost 40 works beginning in 1937, nine of which have been grouped together as the &quot;Magick Lantern Cycle&quot;. Anger&#x27;s films variously merge surrealism with homoeroticism and the occult, and have been described as containing &quot;elements of erotica, documentary, psychodrama, and spectacle&quot;. He has been called &quot;one of America&#x27;s first openly gay filmmakers&quot;, with several films released before homosexuality was legalized in the U.S. Anger also explored occult themes in many of his films; he was fascinated by the English occultist Aleister Crowley and an adherent of Thelema, the religion Crowley founded.

Anger was born into a middle-class Presbyterian family in Santa Monica, California. He began making short films when he was 14 years old, although his first film to gain any recognition was the homoerotic &quot;Fireworks&quot; (1947). The work&#x27;s controversial nature led to his trial on obscenity charges, but he was acquitted. A friendship and working relationship subsequently began with pioneering sexologist Alfred Kinsey. Moving to Europe, Anger produced a number of shorts inspired by the avant-garde scene there, such as &quot;Eaux d&#x27;Artifice&quot; (1953) and &quot;Rabbit&#x27;s Moon&quot; (1971).

Returning to the U.S. in the early 1950s, Anger began work on several new projects, including the films &quot;Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome&quot; (1954), &quot;Scorpio Rising&quot; (1964), &quot;Kustom Kar Kommandos&quot; (1965), and the gossip book &quot;Hollywood Babylon&quot; (1965). The latter became infamous for various dubious and sensationalist claims, many of which were disproved, though some remain urban legends. Getting to know several notable countercultural figures of the time, Anger involved them in his subsequent Thelema-themed works, &quot;Invocation of My Demon Brother&quot; (1969) and &quot;Lucifer Rising&quot; (1972). After failing to produce a sequel to &quot;Lucifer Rising&quot;, which he attempted through the mid-1980s, Anger retired from filmmaking, instead focusing on &quot;Hollywood Babylon II&quot; (1984). In the 2000s he returned to filmmaking, producing shorts for various film festivals and events.

Anger described filmmakers such as Auguste and Louis Lumière, Georges Méliès, and Maya Deren as influences, and has been cited as an important influence on directors like Martin Scorsese, David Lynch, and John Waters. &quot;Kinsey Today&quot; argued that Anger had &quot;a profound impact on the work of many other filmmakers and artists, as well as on music video as an emergent art form using dream sequence, dance, fantasy, and narrative.&quot;

== Biography ==
=== 1927–1936: Early life ===
Kenneth Anger was born as Kenneth Wilbur Anglemyer on February 3, 1927, in Santa Monica, California. His family was Presbyterian, but he became more interested in the occult. His father, Wilbur Anglemyer, was of German ancestry and was born in Troy, Ohio, while his disabled mother, Lillian Coler (the older of the pair), had English ancestry. Anger&#x27;s parents met at Ohio State University and after marrying had their first child, Jean Anglemyer, in 1918, followed by a second, Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Anglemyer, in 1921. That year they moved to Santa Monica to be near Lillian&#x27;s mother, Bertha Coler, who had recently moved there. There Wilbur got a job as an electrical engineer at Douglas Aircraft, earning enough money that they could live comfortably as a middle-class family.

Kenneth Anger, their third and final child, was born in 1927. Growing up, he did not get along with his parents or siblings. His brother Bob later claimed that as the youngest child, Kenneth had been spoiled by his mother and grandmother and became somewhat &quot;bratty&quot;. His grandmother Bertha was a strong influence on the young Kenneth and supported the family financially during the Great Depression. It was she who first took Kenneth to the cinema, to see a double bill of &quot;The Singing Fool&quot; and &quot;Thunder Over Mexico.&quot; Bertha encouraged his artistic interests and later moved into a house in Hollywood with another woman, Miss Diggy, who also encouraged Kenneth. He developed an early interest in film and enjoyed reading the movie tie-in Big Little books. Kenneth later said, &quot;I was a child prodigy who never got smarter.&quot; He remembered attending the Santa Monica Cotillion, where he met Shirley Temple, with whom he once danced.

Anger claimed in &quot;Hollywood Babylon II&quot; that he played the Changeling Prince in the 1935 Warner Brothers film &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, but the character was played by a girl named Sheila Brown. Anger&#x27;s unofficial biographer, Bill Landis, remarked in 1995 that the Changeling Prince was definitely &quot;Anger as a child; visually, he&#x27;s immediately recognizable&quot;.

=== 1937–1946: First films ===
Anger&#x27;s first film was created in 1937, when he was ten years old. The short, &quot;Ferdinand the Bull&quot;, was shot on the remains of 16 mm film that had been left unused after the Anglemyers had made home movies with it on a family vacation to Yosemite National Park. In &quot;Ferdinand the Bull&quot;, which has never been made publicly available, Kenneth dressed as a matador, wearing a cape, while two of his friends from the Boy Scouts played the bull. His second work, created when he was 14, was &quot;Who Has Been Rocking My Dreamboat&quot; (1941), which Anger has often called his first proper film. It was made from footage of children playing during the summer, accompanied with popular songs by bands including the Ink Spots. The next year, he produced another amateur film, &quot;Prisoner of Mars&quot;, which was heavily influenced by &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;. In this science fiction-inspired feature, in which he played the protagonist, Anger added elements taken from the Greek mythological myth of the Minotaur and constructed a small volcano in his back yard as a homemade special effect. Many of these early films are considered lost, with Anger burning much of his previous work in 1967.

In 1944, the Anglemyers moved to Hollywood to move in with family, and Kenneth began attending Beverly Hills High School. It was here that he met Marilyn Granas, who had once been the stand-in for Shirley Temple, and he asked her – alongside another classmate and an older woman – to appear in his next film project, which was ultimately titled &quot;Escape Episode&quot;. Revolving partially around the occult, the picture was filmed in a &quot;spooky old castle&quot; in Hollywood and was subsequently screened at the Coronet Theatre in Los Angeles. Around this time, Anger also began attending screenings of silent films at Clara Grossman&#x27;s art gallery, through which he met a fellow filmmaker, Curtis Harrington, with whom he formed Creative Film Associates (CFA). Harrington is said to have introduced Anger to the work of English occultist Aleister Crowley. Crowley&#x27;s philosophy of Thelema exerted a profound influence on Anger&#x27;s career. CFA was founded to distribute experimental or &quot;underground&quot; films, such as those of Maya Deren and John and James Whitney, as well as Anger&#x27;s and Harrington&#x27;s.

Anger&#x27;s interest in the occult deepened in high school. He first indirectly encountered the subject through reading L. Frank Baum&#x27;s &quot;Oz&quot; books as a child, with their accompanying Rosicrucian philosophies. He was also interested in the works of the French ceremonial magician Eliphas Levi, as well as Sir James Frazer&#x27;s &quot;The Golden Bough&quot;, although his favorite writings were Crowley&#x27;s; he eventually converted to Thelema, the religion Crowley founded.

=== 1947–1949: &quot;Fireworks&quot; and early career ===
Anger discovered his homosexuality at a time when homosexual acts were illegal in the United States, and he began associating with the underground gay scene. At some point in the mid-1940s, he was arrested by police in a &quot;homosexual entrapment&quot;, after which he decided to move out of his parents&#x27; home, gaining his own apartment largely financed by his grandmother, and abandoning the name Anglemyer in favor of Anger. He started attending the University of Southern California (USC), where he studied cinema, and also began experimenting with the use of mind-altering drugs like cannabis and peyote. It was then that he decided to produce a film that would deal with his sexuality, just as other gay avant-garde filmmakers like Willard Maas were doing in that decade. The result was the short film &quot;Fireworks&quot;, which was created in 1947 and exhibited publicly in 1948.

Upon &quot;Fireworks&quot;&#x27;s release, Anger was arrested on obscenity charges. He was acquitted after the case went to the Supreme Court of California, which deemed the film art, not pornography. Twenty years old when he made &quot;Fireworks&quot;, Anger claimed to have been 17, presumably to present himself as more of an &quot;enfant terrible&quot;. A homoerotic work lasting only 14 minutes, the film revolves around a young man (played by Anger) associating with various navy sailors, who eventually turn on him, stripping him naked, beating him to death, and ripping open his chest to find a compass inside. Several fireworks then explode, accompanied by a burning Christmas tree. The final shot shows the young man lying in bed next to another shirtless man. Of this film, Anger said in 1966: &quot;This flick is all I have to say about being 17, the United States Navy, American Christmas and the fourth of July.&quot; He continuously altered and adapted the film until 1980. It was distributed on VHS in 1986.

One of the first people to buy a copy of &quot;Fireworks&quot; was the sexologist Alfred Kinsey of the Institute for Sex Research. He and Anger struck up a friendship that lasted until Kinsey&#x27;s death, during which time Anger aided Kinsey in his research. According to Anger&#x27;s unofficial biographer Bill Landis, Kinsey became a &quot;father figure&quot; whom Anger &quot;could both interact with and emulate.&quot; In 1949, Anger began work on the film &quot;Puce Women&quot;, which unlike &quot;Fireworks&quot; was filmed in color. It starred Yvonne Marquis as a glamorous woman going about her daily life; Anger later said: &quot;&quot;Puce Women&quot; was my love affair with Hollywood ... with all the great goddesses of the silent screen. They were to be filmed in their homes; I was, in effect, filming ghosts.&quot; Due to lack of funding, only one scene was ever produced, eventually released under the title &quot;Puce Moment&quot;. That same year, Anger directed &quot;The Love That Whirls&quot;, a film based on Aztec human sacrifice; because of the nudity it contained, it was destroyed by technicians at the film lab who deemed it obscene.

=== 1950–1953: France, &quot;Rabbit&#x27;s Moon&quot; and &quot;Eaux d&#x27;Artifice&quot; ===
In 1950, Anger moved to Paris, France, where he initially stayed with friends of his who had been forced to leave Hollywood after being blacklisted for having formerly belonged to trade union organizations. He later said he traveled to Paris after receiving a letter from the French director Jean Cocteau in which he told Anger of his admiration for &quot;Fireworks&quot; (shown in 1949 at Festival du Film Maudit in Biarritz). Upon Anger&#x27;s arrival, the two became friends, with Cocteau giving him his permission to make a movie of his ballet &quot;The Young Man and Death&quot;, although at the time the project had no financial backers. In Paris, Anger continued producing short films; in 1950 he started filming &quot;Rabbit&#x27;s Moon&quot; (also known as &quot;La lune des lapins&quot;), about a clown who stares up at the Moon, where a rabbit lives, as in Japanese mythology. Anger produced 20 minutes of footage at the Films du Pantheon Studio before he was rushed out of the building, leaving the film uncompleted. He stored the footage in the disorganized archives of the Cinémathèque Française and retrieved it in 1970, when he finally finished and released the film. Cinémathèque Française head Henri Langlois gave Anger prints of Sergei Eisenstein&#x27;s &quot;Que Viva Mexico!&quot;, which he attempted to put into Eisenstein&#x27;s original order.

In 1953, Anger traveled to Rome, Italy, where he planned to make a film about the 16th-century occultist Cardinal d&#x27;Este. To do so, he began filming at the garden of the Villa d&#x27;Este in Tivoli, in which a lady in 18th-century dress walked through the gardens, which featured many waterfalls (an allusion to the fact that d&#x27;Este allegedly sexually enjoyed urination), accompanied by the music of Vivaldi. This was supposed to be only the first of four scenes, but the others were not made; the resulting one-scene film was titled &quot;Eaux d&#x27;artifice&quot;. Landis remarked, &quot;It&#x27;s one of Anger&#x27;s most tranquil works; his editing makes it soft, lush, and inviting. &quot;Eaux d&#x27;Artifice&quot; remains a secretive romp through a private garden, all for the masked figure&#x27;s and the viewer-voyeur&#x27;s pleasure.&quot;

=== 1953–1960: &quot;Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome&quot; and &quot;Hollywood Babylon&quot; ===
In 1953, soon after the production of &quot;Eaux d&#x27;Artifice&quot;, Anger&#x27;s mother died, and he temporarily returned to the U.S. to assist with the distribution of her estate. During this return, he began to once more immerse himself in California&#x27;s artistic scene, befriending the filmmaker Stan Brakhage, who had been inspired by &quot;Fireworks&quot;. The two collaborated on a film, but it was confiscated at the film lab for obscenity and presumably destroyed. Around this time, two of Anger&#x27;s friends, the couple Renate Druks and Paul Mathison, held a party with the theme &quot;Come As Your Madness&quot;; Anger attended dressed in drag as the ancient Greek goddess Hekate. The party and its many costumes inspired Anger, who produced a painting of it, and asked several of those who attended to appear in a new film he was creating, &quot;Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome&quot;. &quot;Inauguration&quot;, which was created in 1954, is a 38-minute surrealist work featuring many Crowleyan and Thelemite themes, with many of the various characters personifying various pagan gods such as Isis, Osiris, and Pan. One of the actresses in the film was Marjorie Cameron, the widow of Jack Parsons, the influential American Thelemite who had died a few years earlier. Anger played Hekate. He subsequently exhibited the film at various European film festivals, winning the Prix du Ciné-Club Belge and the Prix de l&#x27;Age d&#x27;Or, as well as screening it in the form of a projected triptych at Expo 58, the World Fair held in Brussels in 1958.

In 1955, Anger and Kinsey traveled to the derelict Abbey of Thelema at Cefalù in Sicily to film a short documentary, &quot;Thelema Abbey&quot;. Crowley had used the abbey for his commune during the 1920s, and Anger restored many of the erotic wall paintings that were found there, as well as performing certain Crowleyan rituals at the site. The documentary was made for the British television series &quot;Omnibus&quot;, but was later lost. The next year, after Kinsey&#x27;s death, Anger decided to return to Paris; he was described at the time as being &quot;extremely remote and lonely&quot;.

In desperate need of money, Anger and ghostwriter Elliott Stein wrote a book, &quot;Hollywood Babylon&quot;, in which he compiled gossip about celebrities, some of which he claimed (with no corroboration or citing of sources) he had been told, including that Rudolph Valentino liked to play a sexually submissive role to dominant women; that Walt Disney was addicted to opiates (reflected in the character of Goofy, who&#x27;s perpetually stoned on cannabis); and the nature of the deaths of Peg Entwistle and Lupe Vélez. The work was not published in the U.S. initially, and was first released by the French publisher Jean-Jacques Pauvert. A pirated (and incomplete) version was printed in the U.S. in 1965, with the official American version not published until 1974. In response to a lawsuit Gloria Swanson filed against Anger and his publishers, he sent her a foot-long, sugar-filled coffin with &quot;Here lies Gloria&quot; painted on the lid and lined with a paper printed with Hebrew letters spelling &quot;shalom&quot;. The coffin is preserved at the University of Texas Harry Ransom Center collection. After obtaining some financial backing from the publication of &quot;Hollywood Babylon&quot;, his next film project was &quot;The Story of O&quot;; it was essentially a piece of erotica loosely based on the novel of the same name featuring a heterosexual couple engaged in sadomasochistic sexual activities, although it refrained from showing any explicit sexual images.

=== 1961–1965: &quot;Scorpio Rising&quot; and &quot;Kustom Kar Kommandos&quot; ===
In 1961, Anger once more returned to the U.S., where he lived for a time with Marjorie Cameron. He began work on a new feature, &quot;Scorpio Rising&quot;, about the biker subculture. For this, he employed a biker named Richard McAuley, and filmed him and some of his friends messing around, adding to it scenes of McAuley, or &quot;Scorpio&quot; as he became known, desecrating a derelict church. Anger incorporated more controversial visuals into the piece, including Nazi iconography, nudity, and clips of the life of Jesus Christ taken from the Family Films&#x27; &quot;The Living Bible: Last Journey to Jerusalem&quot;, images of Jesus which are intercut with those of Scorpio. The film has a soundtrack of popular 1960s songs, including &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; by Bobby Vinton, &quot;Torture&quot; by Kris Jensen, and &quot;I Will Follow Him&quot; by Little Peggy March. Anger called the film &quot;a death mirror held up to American culture ... Thanatos in chrome, black leather, and bursting jeans.&quot; It immediately became popular on the underground cinema scene but was soon brought to court on obscenity charges. The jury ruled in favor of the prosecutors and &quot;Scorpio Rising&quot; was banned; the ban was overturned on appeal to the California Supreme Court.

Now living in San Francisco, Anger approached the Ford Foundation, which had just started a program of grants to filmmakers. He showed the foundation his ideas for a new artistic short, &quot;Kustom Kar Kommandos&quot;, which they approved of, giving him a grant of $10,000. Anger spent much of the money on living expenses and alterations to some of his films, so that by the time he actually created &quot;Kustom Kar Kommandos&quot;, it was only one scene long. The homoerotic film involved various shots of a young man polishing a drag strip racing car, accompanied by a pink background and The Paris Sisters&#x27; song &quot;Dream Lover&quot;. Soon after, Anger struck a deal that allowed &quot;Hollywood Babylon&quot; to be officially published for the first time in the U.S., where it proved a success, selling two million copies during the 1960s. Around the same time Anger also translated Lo Duca&#x27;s &quot;History of Eroticism&quot; into English for American publication.

=== 1966–1969: The hippie movement and &quot;Invocation of My Demon Brother&quot; ===
The mid-1960s saw the emergence of the hippie scene and increasing use of the mind-altering drugs Anger had been using for many years. In particular, the hallucinogen LSD, at the time still legal in the U.S., was very popular, and in 1966 Anger released a version of &quot;Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome&quot; he called the &quot;Sacred Mushroom Edition&quot;, which was screened to people while taking LSD, thereby heightening their sensory experience. By this time, Anger had become well known in the American underground scene, and several cinemas screened his better-known films all in one event. With his growing fame, Anger began to react to publicity much as his idol Crowley had done, for instance calling himself &quot;the most monstrous moviemaker in the underground&quot;, a pun on the fact that British tabloids had labeled Crowley &quot;the wickedest man in the world&quot; in the 1920s.

Anger&#x27;s underground fame allowed him to increasingly associate with other celebrities, including Anton LaVey, the founder of the Church of Satan, who named Anger godfather to his daughter Zeena Schreck. Despite their differing philosophies, Anger and LaVey became good friends and remained so for many years. But Anger also resented some celebrities, such as Andy Warhol, who at the time was achieving success not only in the art world but also in the underground film scene. In 1980, Anger threw paint on the front door of a house Warhol had recently moved out of.
In 1966, Anger moved into the ground floor of the William Westerfeld House, a large 19th-century Victorian house in San Francisco also known as the &quot;Russian Embassy&quot;. Around this time he began planning a new film, &quot;Lucifer Rising&quot;, echoing his Thelemite beliefs about the emerging Aeon of Horus. He tattooed Lucifer&#x27;s name on his chest and began searching for a young man who could symbolically become Lucifer, &quot;the Crowned and Conquering Child&quot; of the new Aeon, for the film. While living at the Russian Embassy, he met and lived with various young men who could fill the role, eventually settling on Bobby Beausoleil. Beausoleil founded a band, the Magic Powerhouse of Oz, to record the film&#x27;s soundtrack. In 1967, Anger said the footage he had been filming for &quot;Lucifer Rising&quot; had been stolen, accusing Beausoleil, who denied it. Landis quotes Beausoleil as saying, &quot;[W]hat had happened was that Kenneth had spent all the money that was invested in &quot;Lucifer Rising&quot;&quot; and that he therefore invented the story to satisfy the film&#x27;s creditors. Beausoleil and Anger fell out, with the former getting involved with Charles Manson and the Manson Family. Beausoleil later tortured and murdered Gary Hinman in a drug robbery gone wrong, for which he is serving a life sentence as of 2023.

In the October 26, 1967, issue of &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Anger publicly reinvented himself by placing a full-page ad declaring, &quot;In Memoriam. Kenneth Anger. Filmmaker 1947–1967&quot;. He soon publicly reappeared, this time to claim he had burned all of his early work. The next year he traveled to London, where he first met John Paul Getty, Jr., who became Anger&#x27;s patron, and also met and befriended Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, members of The Rolling Stones, as well as actress/model Anita Pallenberg. Anger decided to use much of the footage created for &quot;Lucifer Rising&quot; in a new film, &quot;Invocation of My Demon Brother&quot;, which starred Beausoleil, LaVey, Jagger, Richards, and Anger, the music for which was composed by Jagger. It was released in 1969 and explored many of the Thelemic themes Anger had originally intended for &quot;Lucifer Rising&quot;. Author Gary Lachman believes the film &quot;inaugurat[ed] the midnight movie cult at the Elgin Theatre.&quot; The story of the film, its making, and the people involved inspired Zachary Lazar&#x27;s novel &quot;Sway&quot;.

=== 1970–1981: &quot;Lucifer Rising&quot; ===
Having used up much of the footage originally intended for &quot;Lucifer Rising&quot; in &quot;Invocation of My Demon Brother&quot;, Anger made a second attempt to complete &quot;Lucifer Rising&quot;. He persuaded the singer and actress Marianne Faithfull to appear in the film, and unsuccessfully tried to convince Jagger to play Lucifer; instead he offered his brother Chris the part. Anger subsequently filmed eight minutes of film and showed it to the British National Film Finance Corporation, which agreed to provide £15,000 for Anger to complete it – something that caused a level of outrage in the British press. With this money he could afford to fly the cast and crew to both West Germany and Egypt for filming.

Anger befriended Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page around this time, the two sharing a great interest in Crowley. At Page&#x27;s invitation, he traveled to Page&#x27;s new home in Scotland, Crowley&#x27;s former residence Boleskine House, to help Page exorcise the building of what Page believed to be a headless man&#x27;s ghost. Page agreed to produce the soundtrack for &quot;Lucifer Rising&quot;, and used the editing suite in his London home to shape the music. Anger later fell out with Page&#x27;s partner, Charlotte, who kicked him out of the house. In retaliation he called a press conference in which he ridiculed Page and threatened to &quot;throw a Kenneth Anger curse&quot; on him. Page&#x27;s music was dumped from the film and replaced in 1979 by music written and recorded by the imprisoned Beausoleil, with whom Anger had reconciled.

Meanwhile, Anger, who had moved to a small apartment on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper East Side, took the footage he had filmed for &quot;Rabbit&#x27;s Moon&quot; in the 1950s, finally released the film in 1972, and again in a shorter version in 1979. Around the same time he also added a new soundtrack to &quot;Puce Moment&quot; and rereleased it. Also around this time, the publisher Marvin Miller produced a low-budget documentary film based on &quot;Hollywood Babylon&quot; without Anger&#x27;s permission, which upset Anger and led to a lawsuit. Anger also created a short film, &quot;Senators in Bondage&quot;, available only to private collectors and never made publicly available. He had plans to make a film about Aleister Crowley titled &quot;The Wickedest Man in the World&quot;, but this project never got off the ground.

In 1981, a decade after starting the project, Anger finally finished and released the 30-minute &quot;Lucifer Rising&quot;. Based upon the Thelemite concept that mankind had entered a new period known as the Aeon of Horus, &quot;Lucifer Rising&quot; was full of occult symbolism, starring Miriam Gibril as the ancient Egyptian goddess Isis, Donald Cammell as her consort Osiris, Faithfull as Jewish mythological figure Lilith, and Leslie Huggins as Lucifer. Anger once again appeared in the film, as the Magus, the same role he played in &quot;Invocation of My Demon Brother&quot;.

=== 1982–1999: Retirement ===
Soon after the release of &quot;Lucifer Rising&quot;, a PBS documentary about Anger and his films, &quot;Kenneth Anger&#x27;s Magick&quot;, was made. It was directed by Kit Fitzgerald, who later recalled interviewing Anger in his Manhattan apartment on a very hot July evening, during which he revealed that he was so broke that he had been forced to sell his air conditioner. Anger himself considered producing other films that would continue on from &quot;Lucifer Rising&quot; in a series, and he began calling his finished film &quot;Part I: Sign Language&quot;, to be followed by two further parts. But those projects were never finished, and Anger did not produce any further films for nearly two decades. In need of money, he released &quot;Hollywood Babylon II&quot; in 1984, as well as continuing to screen his films at various festivals and universities and continuing to attempt to produce &quot;Lucifer Rising II&quot;; around this time he began wearing an eyepatch to these public events, likely due to having been beaten up and getting a bruised eye, a story he told in various interviews, although partly changing the assailant in various versions.

A notorious incident occurred when Anger was invited to appear on Coca Crystal&#x27;s television show in 1984. Upon arriving at the studio he demanded that somebody pay for his taxi ride there, and when they refused, he attacked talent coordinator Maureen Ivice and tried to drag her into his taxi before she was rescued by other members of staff. Anger reportedly escaped the scene by flinging a $100 bill at the cab driver and screaming, &quot;Get me out of here!&quot;

In 1986, Anger sold the video rights to his films, which finally appeared on VHS, allowing them to have greater publicity. The next year, he attended the Avignon Film Festival in France, where his work was being celebrated in commemoration of the 40th anniversary of &quot;Fireworks&quot;. Soon thereafter, he appeared in &quot;Kenneth Anger&#x27;s Hollywood Babylon&quot;, a BBC documentary directed by Nigel Finch for the &quot;Arena&quot; series. In 1991, he moved to West Arenas Boulevard in Palm Springs, California, living in what was formerly the estate of his friend Ruby Keeler, where the British Film Institute sent Rebecca Wood to assist him in writing a never-produced autobiography. Instead, in 1995, Bill Landis, who had been an associate of Anger&#x27;s in the early 1980s, wrote an unofficial biography of him. Anger condemned Landis&#x27;s book, calling Landis &quot;an avowed enemy&quot;.

In 1993, Anger visited Sydney and lectured at a season of his films at the Australian Film Institute Cinema. In an interview given at the time to &quot;Black and White&quot; magazine, he said he was staying in King&#x27;s Cross and putting the finishing touches on the final treatment of a feature film about Australian artist and occultist Rosaleen Norton. This project was unrealized.

===2000–2023: Return to filmmaking and final years===

In 2000, Anger began screening a new short film, the anti-smoking &quot;Don&#x27;t Smoke That Cigarette&quot;, followed a year later by &quot;The Man We Want to Hang&quot;, which comprised images of Crowley&#x27;s paintings that had been shown at a temporary exhibition in Bloomsbury, London. In 2004, he began showing &quot;Anger Sees Red&quot;, a short surrealistic film starring himself, and the same year also began showing another work, &quot;Patriotic Penis&quot;. Anger soon followed this with a flurry of other shorts, including &quot;Mouse Heaven&quot;, which consisted of images of Mickey Mouse memorabilia; &quot;Ich Will!&quot;; and &quot;Uniform Attraction&quot;, all of which he showed at various public appearances. Anger&#x27;s final project was &quot;Technicolor Skull&quot;, with musician Brian Butler, described as a &quot;magick ritual of light and sound in the context of a live performance&quot;, in which Anger plays the theremin and Butler plays the guitar and other electronic instruments amid a psychedelic backdrop of colors and skulls.

Anger made an appearance in Nik Sheehan&#x27;s 2008 feature documentary about Brion Gysin and the Dreamachine, &quot;FLicKeR&quot;. He also appeared alongside Vincent Gallo in the 2009 short film &quot;Night of Pan&quot;, written and directed by Brian Butler. In 2009 his work was featured in a retrospective exhibition at the MoMA PS1 in New York City, and the next year a similar exhibition took place in London.

Anger finished writing &quot;Hollywood Babylon III&quot; but did not publish it, fearing severe legal repercussions if he did. Of this, he said: &quot;The main reason I didn&#x27;t bring it out was that I had a whole section on Tom Cruise and the Scientologists. I&#x27;m not a friend of the Scientologists.&quot; Despite withholding legal action against the highly critical 2015 film &quot;Going Clear&quot;, the Church of Scientology is known to sue those making accusations against it.

In 2019, he became the subject of the documentary short &quot;Cinemagician - Conversations with Kenneth Anger&quot;, by Swedish author and filmmaker Carl Abrahamsson, which features some of his last recorded interviews.

Anger died at a care facility in Yucca Valley, California, on May 11, 2023, at the age of 96. The announcement of his death was delayed until May 24 while his estate was being settled.

== Themes ==

Several recurring themes can be seen in Anger&#x27;s cinematic work. One of the most notable is homoeroticism, first seen in &quot;Fireworks&quot; (1947), which was based on Anger&#x27;s own homosexual awakening and featured various navy officers flexing their muscles and a white fluid (often thought to symbolize semen) pouring over the protagonist&#x27;s body. There is similar homoerotic imagery in &quot;Scorpio Rising&quot; (1963), which stars a muscled, topless, leather-clad biker, and &quot;Kustom Kar Kommandos&quot; (1965), where a young man sensually polishes a car, with close-up shots of his tight-fitting jeans and crotch. Images of naked men also appear in &quot;Invocation of My Demon Brother&quot; (1969), where they are eventually filmed wrestling, and &quot;Anger Sees Red&quot; (2004), in which a muscled, topless man performs press-ups.

Another recurring theme in Anger&#x27;s films is the occult, particularly the symbolism of his own esoteric religion, Thelema. This is visible in &quot;Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome&quot;, &quot;Invocation of My Demon Brother&quot;, and &quot;Lucifer Rising&quot;, all of which are based on the Thelemite concept of the Aeon of Horus and feature actors portraying pagan gods. Anger linked the creation of film to the occult, particularly the practice of ceremonial magic, something of which Crowley had been a noted practitioner. Anger once said, &quot;making a movie is casting a spell.&quot;

One of the central recurring images in Anger&#x27;s work is flames and light; &quot;Fireworks&quot; has various examples, including a burning Christmas tree. This relates to Lucifer, a deity to whom Anger devoted one of his films, whose name is Latin for &quot;light bearer&quot;.

In many of his films, heavy use is made of music, both classical and pop, to accompany the visual imagery. In &quot;Scorpio Rising&quot; he makes use of the 1950s/1960s pop songs &quot;Torture&quot; by Kris Jensen, &quot;I Will Follow Him&quot; by Little Peggy March, and &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; by Bobby Vinton. He first used music to accompany visuals in the 1941 work &quot;Who Has Been Rocking My Dreamboat?&quot;, which uses tracks by the Mills Brothers. His use of popular music to accompany his films has been cited as a key influence on the development of music videos and MTV, although he stated his dislike for the music video industry. On one occasion the band Combustible Edison asked Anger to direct a video to accompany its song &quot;Bluebeard&quot;; he declined, believing that while music could be used to accompany film, it was pointless to do it the other way around.

== Awards ==

* Silver Lake Film Festival Spirit of Silver Lake Award (2000)
* San Francisco International Film Festival Golden Gate Persistence of Vision Award (2001)
* Los Angeles Film Critics Association Douglas Edwards Independent/Experimental Film/Video Award (2002), &quot;for his body of work&quot;; tied with Michael Snow, for &quot;*Corpus Callosum&quot;
* Anthology Film Archives, Life Achievement Award (2010)

== Personality and beliefs ==

Anger was known for his reclusive nature and had been called an &quot;extremely private individual&quot;, although he gave various interviews over the years, including one with Rocco Castoro of &quot;Vice&quot;. In such interviews, he refused to discuss his name change from Anglemyer to Anger, telling one interviewer: &quot;You&#x27;re being impertinent. It says &#x27;Anger&#x27; on my passport. That&#x27;s all you need to know. I would stay away from that subject if I were you.&quot; But in a 2010 interview, he said: &quot;I just condensed my name. I knew it would be like a label, a logo. It&#x27;s easy to remember.&quot;

Anger once joked that he was &quot;somewhat to the right of the KKK&quot; in his views about black people, opening him up to criticism for racism, though some theorize it was a &quot;Crowley-esque joke&quot;. He supported the Tibetan independence movement.

Anger was a Thelemite and belonged to the main Thelemic organization, Ordo Templi Orientis. He viewed many of the men he associated with as living embodiments of Lucifer, a symbol of the Aeon of Horus in Thelemic philosophy, and had his own name inked onto his chest with the Lucifer tattoo. Anger showed an interest in various other religious movements, particularly those that related in some way to occultism. For instance, he was a lifelong friend of Anton LaVey from before the founding of the Church of Satan in the 1960s, even living with him and his family during the 1990s. LaVey also appeared in Anger&#x27;s &quot;Invocation of My Demon Brother&quot; as a devilish priest. Anger called himself a pagan and did not consider himself a Satanist. He has called Wicca a &quot;lunar&quot;, feminine religion in contrast to Thelema&#x27;s &quot;solar&quot; masculinity.

<doc id="389780" wikidata="Q2741" url="?curid=389780" title="Dana Scully">
<text>Dana Katherine Scully, M.D., is a fictional character and one of the two protagonists in the Fox science-fiction, supernatural television series &quot;The X-Files&quot;, played by Gillian Anderson. Scully is a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Special Agent and a medical doctor (MD), partnered with fellow Special Agent Fox Mulder for seasons one to seven and seasons 10 and 11, and with John Doggett in the eighth and ninth seasons. In the television series, they work out of a cramped basement office at FBI headquarters in Washington, DC to investigate unsolved cases labeled &quot;X-Files.&quot; In 2002, Scully left government employment, and in 2008, she began working as a surgeon in &quot;Our Lady of Sorrows&quot;, a private Catholic hospital – where she stayed for seven years, until rejoining the FBI. In contrast to Mulder&#x27;s credulous &quot;believer&quot; character, Scully is the skeptic for the first seven seasons, choosing to base her beliefs on what science can prove. She later on becomes a &quot;believer&quot; after Mulder&#x27;s abduction at the end of season seven.

Scully has appeared in all but five episodes of &quot;The X-Files&quot;, and in the 20th Century Fox films &quot;The X-Files&quot;, released in 1998, and &quot;The X-Files: I Want to Believe&quot;, released 10 years later. The episodes in which she does not appear are &quot;3,&quot; &quot;Zero Sum,&quot; &quot;Unusual Suspects,&quot; &quot;Travelers&quot; and &quot;The Gift&quot; (excluding archive footage). The eleventh season marked Anderson&#x27;s final time portraying the character.

==Background==
Dr. Dana Katherine Scully was born on February 23, 1964, in Annapolis, Maryland, to William (Don S. Davis) and Margaret Scully (Sheila Larken), into a close-knit Catholic family with Irish ancestry. She has an older brother, Bill Jr., an older sister, Melissa, and a younger brother, Charles, who is never seen on the show except in flashbacks. In the canonical 2016 comic book series, published by IDW Publishing, the two-part issue &quot;Ishmael&quot; revealed Scully had a paternal half-brother, named Tam Minh Nguyen. Scully&#x27;s father was a navy captain, who died of a heart attack in early January 1994. Dana Scully grew up in Annapolis, Maryland and later in San Diego, California. As a young girl, Scully&#x27;s favorite book was &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; and she came to nickname her father &quot;Ahab&quot; from the book, and in return, he called her &quot;Starbuck.&quot; Due to this, she named her dog Queequeg.

Scully attended the University of Maryland, and in 1986, received a Bachelor of Science degree in physics. Her undergraduate thesis was titled &quot;Einstein&#x27;s Twin Paradox: A New Interpretation.&quot; Just out of medical school at Stanford University, she was recruited by the FBI; she accepted the agency&#x27;s offer of employment because she felt she could distinguish herself there. After two years in the bureau, Section Chief Scott Blevins assigned her to work with agent Fox Mulder.

==Storylines==

Upon being partnered with Mulder, Scully maintained her medical skills by acting as a forensic pathologist, often performing or consulting on autopsies of victims on X-Files cases.

In season two, Scully was kidnapped by an ex-FBI agent turned mental patient named Duane Barry, and then taken from Barry by a military covert operation that was working with the alien conspirators, but was later returned. In season three, she found out that a super hi-tech microchip had been implanted in the back of her neck. After having it removed, she developed cancer in the fourth season and was hospitalized after the cancer became terminal. She was saved after Mulder broke into the Department of Defense to retrieve another chip to be implanted back into her neck. At the time, Scully was also undergoing experimental medical treatments and was having a dramatic renewal of her faith.

Scully was pronounced infertile during the fifth season. In the season five episode &quot;Emily,&quot; Scully discovers that she unknowingly mothered a daughter during her abduction (in season two). Her daughter Emily was adopted by another family. Emily died shortly afterwards, and they were unable to further investigate after Emily&#x27;s body went missing. In the seventh-season finale, &quot;Requiem,&quot; Scully mysteriously became pregnant. The child, named William, after her own father, as well as Mulder&#x27;s father, was born at the end of the eighth season. The show did not initially reveal the cause of Scully&#x27;s pregnancy, but later episodes and movies would see Mulder and Scully call William &quot;our son&quot;; the pair had unsuccessfully tried for a child through in vitro fertilization. Around this time, Mulder was fired from the FBI by Deputy Director Alvin Kersh, and Scully left the field to teach forensics at Quantico. William was placed for adoption during the end of the ninth season after Scully felt she could no longer provide the safety that William needed. William was a &quot;miracle child,&quot; of some importance to the alien conspirators. He demonstrated extraordinary powers, including telekinesis.

In &quot;The X-Files: I Want to Believe&quot;, she is shown working as a medical doctor at the &quot;Our Lady of Sorrows&quot;, a private Catholic hospital in Virginia. Early on in the film, Scully is contacted by the FBI, who are looking for Fox Mulder in the hope that he will assist them with the investigation of a missing FBI agent. In exchange for his help, the charges against him will be dropped. Unlike Mulder, Scully was apparently not considered a fugitive by the FBI. However, she did continue to maintain her romantic relationship with Mulder throughout the six years that he was on the run from the American government. In the movie, they are shown to be living together in a secluded house.

In the first episode of season 10, &quot;My Struggle&quot; (2016), Scully is still working as a doctor for &quot;Our Lady of Sorrows&quot; hospital, now performing surgeries on children with severe birth defects. She has extraterrestrial DNA, as the test that she performs on herself confirms. After the FBI reopens the X-Files, 14 years after their closure, she rejoins the bureau. In &quot;Mulder and Scully Meet the Were-Monster,&quot; Scully jokes that she often enters dangerous situations alone due to the immortality she seemingly obtained during the events of the episode &quot;Tithonus.&quot; At the end of &quot;Mulder and Scully Meet the Were-Monster,&quot; Scully steals a dog from an animal control center, named Daggoo, which is named after yet another character from &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;. In &quot;Home Again&quot; Dana&#x27;s mother, Margaret Scully, dies after suffering a heart attack. In the show&#x27;s 10th-season finale, &quot;My Struggle II,&quot; Scully is in a race against time to save humankind, creating a vaccine from her own extraterrestrial DNA.

==Characterization==
Throughout the series, Scully&#x27;s Catholic faith served as a cornerstone, although a contradiction to her otherwise rigid skepticism of the paranormal. Due to her career in science and medicine, she drifted from her Catholic Christian upbringing, but remained somewhat entrenched in her religious beliefs.

Scully almost always wears a gold cross necklace. Two conflicting stories exist of how Scully received the necklace. After Scully&#x27;s abduction in season two, Scully&#x27;s mother told Fox Mulder she gave Scully the necklace as a 15th birthday present. In season five, Scully recalls receiving the necklace as a Christmas present. Scully&#x27;s sister, Melissa, also receives a similar necklace on that occasion. When she was abducted by Duane Barry, a self-proclaimed alien abductee, it was the only item left behind in Barry&#x27;s getaway car. Mulder wore it as a talisman of her until Scully miraculously reappeared in a Washington, DC, hospital. After she recovered from the trauma of her abduction, he returned the cross to her.

The abduction visibly tested the limits of her faithMulder believes that Scully was taken aboard an alien spaceship and was subjected to tests. Because of Scully&#x27;s skepticism, though, she believes she was kidnapped by men, not aliens, and subjected to tests. She believes she could have been brought there by Barry, and she began to exhibit symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder on a case involving a murdering fetishist named Donnie Pfaster. This psychological re-victimization continued after Pfaster escaped from prison five years later and again attempted to kill her in her home, ending only after she fatally shot him. She struggled with what motivated her actions to kill Pfaster, and questioned whether it was God compelling her to kill him, or &quot;something else.&quot;

Sometime after her recovery from cancer, Scully began to regularly attend mass again. At the request of Father McCue, Scully got involved in a case concerning a paraplegic girl who was found dead in a kneeling position with her palms outstretched and eye sockets charred. After Scully discovered the girl was a quadruplet and two more were murdered, Father McCue shared with her the story of the &quot;seraphim&quot; and the &quot;nephilim&quot;, which Scully interpreted as a possible explanation for the deformations and deaths of the girls. Scully continued to have visions of Emily, and when the last girl died, Scully believed she was returning the girl to God. Upon her return to Washington, DC, she went to confession to gain peace of mind and acceptance for Emily&#x27;s death. In confession, she regretted her decision of letting the girl go. This suggests Scully had doubts about her faith.

In the sixth-season episode &quot;Milagro,&quot; Agent Scully&#x27;s vulnerability is exposed. In this episode, the murderer takes the victim&#x27;s heart out. The suspect, a writer named Phillip Padgett, has a particular interest in Scully and is fascinated by her beauty and personality. When she goes to a church to observe a painting, the writer is there and talks to her about the Sacred Heart of Jesus. During the conversation he says she visits the church because she likes art, but not as place of worship. Scully doesn&#x27;t say otherwise and later she says to Agent Mulder the writer told her her life story. All this suggests that Scully isn&#x27;t a devout Roman Catholic, although she attempted to approach again the Catholic community and the Catholic faith to which she was devout in her youth, after handling the strange case presented in &quot;Revelations&quot; and also after dealing with life-threatening cancer during the fourth season.

===Relationships===
While in medical school, Scully carried on an affair with her married instructor, Dr. Daniel Waterston, who may have been the &quot;college boyfriend&quot; mentioned in &quot;Trust No 1.&quot; In the show, whether or not the relationship became sexual is never indicated. According to Anderson in the episode&#x27;s audio commentary, Scully came very close to having an affair with the married Waterston, but left before she could break up his marriage. The end of her relationship with Waterston came about following her decision to go into the FBI. After her entrance to the FBI&#x27;s Academy at Quantico, Scully began a year-long relationship with her Academy instructor, Jack Willis, with whom she shared a birthday.

Towards the end of the series, her previously platonic friendship with partner Fox Mulder developed into a romantic relationship. When Mulder was injured in a boat crash, he awakened in a hospital and told Scully that he loved her. In the season six episode &quot;How the Ghosts Stole Christmas,&quot; a ghost that seems to know the inner workings of Scully&#x27;s mind suggests that her source of intimacy for Mulder comes from her desire to always prove him wrong. By the end of the sixth season, Mulder and Scully were increasingly shown enjoying more light-hearted activities together, such as practicing baseball, using FBI funds for a &quot;night out&quot; during a movie premiere, and watching a movie at Mulder&#x27;s apartment. In the season seven episode &quot;all things,&quot; Scully is shown getting dressed in Mulder&#x27;s bathroom, while Mulder sleeps, apparently naked, in the bedroom. In &quot;Trust No 1&quot; a man reveals to Scully that he works for a new Syndicate like-organization, and his job requires him and a few other colleagues to spy on her around the clock. Due to this he knows intimate details of Scully&#x27;s personal life, right down to her &quot;natural hair color&quot; (Titian, as later confirmed by Chris Carter). It is suggested by this man that Scully ultimately initiated a sexual relationship with Mulder, as he remarked that he was very surprised when she invited Mulder &quot;into her bed.&quot; The last scene of the series finale featured Mulder and Scully holding each other on a bed, facing an uncertain future together in love.

In the film, &quot;The X-Files: I Want to Believe&quot;, which takes place six years later, Mulder and Scully are still in a relationship. Scully was concerned that Mulder&#x27;s continuing pursuit of the unknown was taking its toll on their relationship, and they could not be together if he could not &quot;escape the darkness.&quot; However, the film ends with the couple sharing a passionate kiss, and in the &quot;secret ending&quot; after the majority of the credits, a happily-smiling Scully is seen in a small rowboat with Mulder, both clad in swimwear, in a tropical sea, having taken him up on his offer to run away together. In the 10th season, Scully and Mulder are no longer a couple, as she chose to leave him. At the end of the season, Scully gets a vision, which is revealed to have come from her son, William, at the beginning of season 11. Over the course of season 11, Scully and Mulder search for William. Skinner learns from the Smoking Man that the Smoking Man, who is Mulder&#x27;s father, also artificially impregnated Scully, thus is William&#x27;s father, as well. In the third episode of the 11th season, &quot;Plus One,&quot; Scully and Mulder are intimate again. In the season 11 finale, &quot;My Struggle IV,&quot; she reveals to Mulder that she is pregnant with his child.

==Conceptual history==

Chris Carter named Scully after his favorite sportscaster, Vin Scully of the Los Angeles Dodgers. John Doggett was likewise named after Vin Scully&#x27;s longtime broadcasting partner, Jerry Doggett. Scully&#x27;s character was also inspired by Jodie Foster&#x27;s portrayal of Clarice Starling in the film &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;.

The casting for Scully caused a conflict between Carter and the Fox network. Carter had chosen 24-year-old Gillian Anderson, whom Carter felt was perfect for the role. Of her audition, Carter said, &quot;she came in and read the part with a seriousness and intensity that I knew the Scully character had to have and I knew [...] she was the right person for the part.&quot; However, Fox executives had wanted a more glamorous &quot;bombshell&quot; for the part (in a 2008 interview Anderson stated that Pamela Anderson had actually been the network&#x27;s first choice), hoping that this would lead to the series involving a romantic element. This led Carter to insist that he did not want the roles of Mulder and Scully to become romantically involved. Carter decided Scully would be the skeptic to play against established stereotypes; typically on television the quality was attributed to a male. Because Duchovny was much taller than Anderson, during scenes where Mulder and Scully stand or walk next to each other Anderson stood on &quot;the Gilly-Board,&quot; an apple box named after her.

Scully appears in every episode of the 11-season series with the exceptions of &quot;3,&quot; &quot;Zero Sum,&quot; &quot;Unusual Suspects,&quot; and &quot;Travelers.&quot; She has appeared outside &quot;The X-Files&quot; on numerous occasions, the most notable being in the &quot;Millennium&quot; (also created by Chris Carter) episode &quot;Lamentation,&quot; in which the main character, Frank Black, visits the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia, and Mulder and Scully are briefly seen descending a stairway. In fact, they are Duchovny and Anderson&#x27;s stand-ins.

An animated version of Scully, which featured the voice acting of Anderson, appeared on season eight of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, in the episode &quot;The Springfield Files,&quot; as well as Canadian animated series &quot;Eek! The Cat&quot;, on the episode &quot;Eek Space 9.&quot; The animated television series &quot;ReBoot&quot; featured characters Fax Modem and Data Nully, obvious spoofs of Mulder and Scully, in the episode &quot;Trust No One.&quot; Anderson provided her voice work for the episode, but co-star Duchovny declined.

==Reception==
Anderson won many awards for her portrayal of Special Agent Scully during the ten seasons of The X-Files, including an Emmy for &quot;Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series&quot; in 1997, a Golden Globe for &quot;Best Actress in a Television Drama Series&quot; in 1997, two SAG Awards for &quot;Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series&quot; in 1996 and 1997 and a Saturn Award for Best Actress on Television in 1997. In total, Anderson received for the role, four Emmy nominations, four Golden Globe nominations, nine SAG nominations and eight Saturn nominations.

Film critic Scott Mendelson, writing in &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;, cited Scully as an example of strong female characters on television, calling her &quot;one of the most iconic characters in the science-fiction genre.&quot; &quot;Radio Times&quot; Laura Pledger also named her as a strong TV woman, placing her at No. 1. Rebecca Traister of Salon.com opined that Scully had a better character arc than Mulder. She wrote, &quot;The very fact that her character was such a hard sell made her repeated brushes with the supernatural all the more powerful. Mulder&#x27;s desire to believe was so expansive, his credulity so flexible, that it&#x27;s not as though he was ever going to have either shaken from him. But Scully&#x27;s surety was solid, stable, rigid; every time she saw something she thought she&#x27;d never see, we saw it crack, sparks fly from it. She was forced to question herself, grow, change.&quot; She praised her for being more &quot;rational, resilient, [and] mature&quot; than her partner and for their mature relationship. In a review of &quot;Irresistible,&quot; Emily VanDerWerff of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; wrote that it was a cliché to put Scully in danger, as &quot;Scully is [the show&#x27;s] heart, and any time she&#x27;s in danger, it feels like the show itself is about to be stabbed through the heart.&quot;

The character of Scully has become something of a sci-fi heroine due to her intelligence and resilience, frequently appearing on lists of important female science fiction characters, such as &quot;Total Sci-Fi Online&quot;″s list of &quot;The 25 Women Who Shook Sci-Fi&quot;, where she came in fourth. TV Squad named her the thirteenth greatest woman on television, while the site also listed her among the most memorable female science fiction television characters. She is also often cited as being an unlikely sex symbol, frequently being included in lists of sexy TV characters. She was listed in AfterEllen.com&#x27;s Top 50 Favorite Female TV Characters. The pairing Mulder/Scully was ranked number 15 on Sleuth Channel&#x27;s poll of &quot;America&#x27;s Top Sleuths&quot;.

Angelica Jade Bastién of &quot;Vulture&quot; emphasized the importance of Scully&#x27;s character in popular culture by listing all the strong female characters she inspired or may have influenced in some aspects, including: Temperance &quot;Bones&quot; Brennan of &quot;Bones&quot;, Peggy Carter of &quot;Agent Carter&quot;, Veronica Mars of &quot;Veronica Mars&quot;, Olivia Moore of &quot;iZombie&quot;, Dr. Maura Isles of &quot;Rizzoli &amp; Isles&quot;, Olivia Benson of &quot;Law and Order: SVU&quot;, Joan Watson of &quot;Elementary&quot;, Sydney Bristow of &quot;Alias&quot;, Abbie Mills of &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;, Zoë Washburne of &quot;Firefly&quot;, Stella Gibson (another character portrayed by Anderson) of &quot;The Fall&quot; and Olivia Dunham of &quot;Fringe&quot;. Jade Bastién wrote: &quot;Do all the characters Scully has influenced live up to her? Definitely not. Gillian Anderson&#x27;s performance and her chemistry with David Duchovny aren&#x27;t exactly elements that can be replicated. But these characters prove that Scully isn&#x27;t only the heart of &quot;The X-Files&quot;, but also the character who had the most profound influence on popular culture.&quot;

Indiewire&#x27;s Liz Shannon Miller ranked Scully as the No. 1 most important character of &quot;The X-Files&quot;, writing: &quot;Scully&#x27;s legacy is so important in so many ways, from giving us the gift of Gillian Anderson&#x27;s acting, to inspiring an entire generation of young women to pursue careers in STEM. Intelligent, loyal, flawed and brave, Scully was the show&#x27;s beating heart and saving grace even in its lowest years. As Chris Carter himself has said: &#x27;It&#x27;s Scully&#x27;s show&#x27;.&quot;

==&quot;The Scully Effect&quot;==
The character is believed by some to have initiated a phenomenon referred to as &quot;The Scully Effect,&quot; as the character&#x27;s role as a medical doctor and FBI Special Agent inspired many young women to pursue careers in science, medicine, engineering, and law enforcement, and as a result brought a perceptible increase in the number of women in those fields. At the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con, Anderson noted that she has long been aware of &quot;The Scully Effect&quot; and stated: &quot;We got a lot of letters all the time, and I was told quite frequently by girls who were going into the medical world or the science world or the FBI world or other worlds that I reigned, that they were pursuing those pursuits because of the character of Scully. And I said, &#x27;Yay!&#x27;&quot; Anne Simon, a biology professor and a science adviser for the series recalls: &quot;I asked my Intro Bio class back then how many of them were influenced by the character of Scully on &quot;The X-Files&quot; to go into science and half of the hands in the room went up. That&#x27;s huge! That was saying that the show was really having an effect.&quot; &quot;The Scully Effect&quot; remains a subject of academic inquiry.

<text>Cupar ( ; ) is a town, former royal burgh and parish in Fife, Scotland. It lies between Dundee and Glenrothes. According to a 2011 population estimate, Cupar had a population around 9,000, making it the ninth-largest settlement in Fife, and the civil parish a population of 11,183 (in 2011). It is the historic county town of Fife, although the council now sits at Glenrothes.

==History==
The town is believed to have grown around the site of Cupar Castle, which was the seat of the sheriff and was owned by the earls of Fife. The area became a centre for judiciary as the county of Fife and as a market town catering for both cattle and sheep.

Towards the latter stages of the 13th century, the burgh became the site of an assembly of the three estates – clergy, nobility and burgesses – organised by Alexander III in 1276 as a predecessor of the Parliament of Scotland. 

Although written information of a charter for the modern town was lost, evidence suggested that this existed as one of the many properties owned by the Earls of Fife by 1294.

During the middle of the 14th century, the burgh started to pay customs on taxable incomes, which probably meant that royal burgh status was granted sometime between 1294 and 1328. The oldest document, referring to the royal burgh, was a grant by Robert II in 1381 to give a port at Guardbridge on the River Eden to help boost trade with Flanders. This grant was officially recognised by James II in 1428.

==Governance==

Cupar is represented by several tiers of elected government. Cupar Community Council is the lowest. Its statutory role is to communicate local opinion to local and central government. Fife Council, the unitary local authority for Cupar based in Glenrothes, is the executive, deliberative and legislative body responsible for local governance. The Scottish Parliament is responsible for devolved matters such as education, health and justice while reserved matters are dealt with by the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The Cupar area supports three multi-member wards with eleven councillors sitting on the committee of Fife Council. County Buildings on Catherine Street are the main headquarters for the east region of Fife Council, which deals with administrative, planning and agricultural issues.

Cupar is in the UK Parliamentary constituency of North East Fife, electing one Member of Parliament (MP) to the House of Commons by the first past the post system. Wendy Chamberlain of the Liberal Democrats is the MP. Cupar is in the (smaller) North East Fife constituency of the Scottish Parliament, created in 1999 as one of nine within the Mid Scotland and Fife electoral region. Each constituency elects one Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) and the region elects seven additional members to produce a form of proportional representation. The constituency MSP is Willie Rennie of the Scottish Liberal Democrats.

Prior to Brexit in 2020 it was part of the pan-Scotland European Parliament constituency which elected seven Members of the European Parliament (MEP)s using the d&#x27;Hondt method of party-list proportional representation.

==Demography==
The 2001 census reported a population of 8,506, which increased slightly to around 8,980 in 2008. The demographic make-up resembles the rest of Scotland. The 30–44 age group formed the largest portion of the population (22%). The median age of males and females was 39 and 43 years respectively, compared to 37 and 39 years for the whole of Scotland.

Reported places of birth were:

*95.81% in the United Kingdom (including 81.64% from Scotland)
*0.51% in Ireland
*1.60% in other European Union countries
*2.09% in the rest of the world

The economic activity of residents aged 16–74 was 42.20% in full-time employment, 12.32% in part-time employment, 5.89% self-employed, 3.10% unemployed, 2.96% students with jobs, 3.94% students without jobs, 17.68% retired, 4.83% looking after home or family, 4.35% permanently sick or disabled, and 2.72% economically inactive for other reasons. Compared with Scotland&#x27;s average demography, Cupar has a lower proportion of immigrants, but a higher proportion of over-75s.

==Landmarks==

The Old Gaol was designed by James Gillespie Graham and built 1813–14. After closing as a prison in 1844, it was used by the Fifeshire Militia, later the Fifeshire Artillery Militia. It was purchased by William Watt (seedsman) in 1895 and occupied by that firm until 1988. It operated as Watts of Cupar, a bar and restaurant, until it closed and was sold to developers at the end of 2019.

The historic town centre is the junction of Bonnygate and the Crossgate. This is where the town&#x27;s mercat cross, is located with the original shaft being supported by a unicorn. It dates from 1683. To the east is St Catherine Street, home to the burgh chambers and county buildings, both designed by Robert Hutchison. The Category B listed Cupar Burgh Chambers, built between 1815 and 1817, contains a three-story bow street corner and a doric entrance. The adjacent county buildings built between 1812 and 1817 are unique in Fife as the only example replicating the style of buildings in the New Town of Edinburgh. The Category B-listed Corn Exchange tower can be seen across the town skyline.

At the east end of St Catherine Street is the Category B-listed Cupar War Memorial in a classical Greek style overlooking the Cart Haugh, one of several designed by John Kinross with assistance from leading contemporary sculptors, for the exception of the Victory statue which was done by Henry Snell Gamley. The memorial was first unveiled by Field Marshal Earl Haig in 1922 and then again for the addition of the World War II memorial in 1950 by the Earl of Elgin. Nearby on Coal Road is a Category B-listed classical style former prison building built between 1813 and 1814.
On the Bonnygate, the Category A-listed Preston Lodge built by the Laird of Airdrie is the town&#x27;s second oldest building. The house was built in 1623 and is inscribed on a stone on the west wall. The house was extended in 1702 by James Preston and was remodeled by London goldsmith William Preston, in 1765. Later, the Reverend Sir James Preston occupied the house between 1775 and 1791, when he was the minister of the Cupar Old Parish Church. The original design of the building is believed to have been inspired by Culross Palace in Culross. Situated at the corner of the Crossgate, the Category C listed &quot;Duncan&#x27;s Institute&quot; by John Milne, which was built 1870–71 as a mechanics&#x27; institute for the &quot;working classes of Cupar&quot; by Mrs Duncan. The building, a mixture of Gothic, Scottish and Flemish styles is recognised in the town for its twisted spire. On the Kirkgate is the Parish Church of Cupar Old and St Michael of Tarvit, designed by the architect, Hay Bell. This consists of the Category A-listed Parish Church tower dating from 1415 and the Category B-listed main church building from 1745. The tower is the only surviving piece of the old Cupar parish church, founded by the priory of St Andrews.

 To the south of the town on the A914 and A916 is the Category A-listed Hill of Tarvit mansion house and nearby scheduled monument Scotstarvit Tower. The Hill of Tarvit was formerly known as Wemyss Hall, designed by Sir Walter Bruce around 1692. When the house was sold in 1904, Robert Lorimer was commissioned to design a bigger house compared to the existing Wemyss Hall to be able to hold the owner&#x27;s French architecture. This was completed around 1907 and 1908, granting the present name &quot;Hill of Tarvit&quot;. The house&#x27;s interior showcased the owner&#x27;s love of antique furniture ranging from Flemish tapestries; Louis V; Louis XI; English and Scottish have been considered to be Lormier&#x27;s best work. The service accommodation showcases the range of rooms and equipment used by a family, prior to the First World War. Situated between the Tarvit and Walton Hills, is Scotstarvit Tower, a well-preserved simple L-plan early 17th-century tower house of five stories and an attic. To the north of the town is Hawklaw, which operated as a Government Radio Receiving Station between 1942 and 1988.

==Economy==

<text>A burgh ( ) is an autonomous municipal corporation in Scotland, usually a city, town, or toun in Scots. This type of administrative division existed from the 12th century, when King David I created the first royal burghs. Burgh status was broadly analogous to borough status, found in the rest of the United Kingdom. Following local government reorganisation in 1975, the title of &quot;royal burgh&quot; remains in use in many towns, but now has little more than ceremonial value.

==History==

The first burgh was Berwick. By 1130, David I (r. 1124–53) had established other burghs including Edinburgh, Stirling, Dunfermline, Haddington, Perth, Dumfries, Jedburgh, Montrose, Rutherglen and Lanark. Most of the burghs granted charters in his reign probably already existed as settlements. Charters were copied almost verbatim from those used in England, and early burgesses usually invited English and Flemish settlers. They were able to impose tolls and fines on traders within a region outside their settlements. Properties known as Burgage tenures were a key feature, whose tenants had to be of the Burgher class, known as a &quot;Burgesses&quot;, and therefore eligible to participate in trade within the town, and to elect town officials. Most of the early burghs were on the east coast, and among them were the largest and wealthiest, including Old and New Aberdeen, Berwick, Perth and Edinburgh, whose growth was facilitated by trade with other North Sea ports on the continent, in particular in the Low Countries, as well as ports on the Baltic Sea. In the south-west, Glasgow, Ayr and Kirkcudbright were aided by the less profitable sea trade with Ireland and to a lesser extent France and Spain. 

Burghs were typically settlements under the protection of a castle and usually had a market place, with a widened high street or junction, marked by a mercat cross, beside houses for the burgesses and other inhabitants. The founding of 16 royal burghs can be traced to the reign of David I (1124–53) and there is evidence of 55 burghs by 1296. In addition to the major royal burghs, the late Middle Ages saw the proliferation of baronial and ecclesiastical burghs, with 51 created between 1450 and 1516. Most of these were much smaller than their royal counterparts. Excluded from foreign trade, they acted mainly as local markets and centres of craftsmanship. Burghs were centres of basic crafts, including the manufacture of shoes, clothes, dishes, pots, joinery, bread and ale, which would normally be sold to &quot;indwellers&quot; and &quot;outdwellers&quot; on market days. In general, burghs carried out far more local trading with their hinterlands, on which they relied for food and raw materials, than trading nationally or abroad.

Burghs had rights to representation in the Parliament of Scotland. Under the Acts of Union of 1707 many became parliamentary burghs, represented in the Parliament of Great Britain. Under the Scottish Reform Act 1832, 32 years after the merger of the Parliament of Great Britain into the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the boundaries of burghs for parliamentary elections ceased to be necessarily their boundaries for other purposes.

===Types===
There were several types of burgh, including;

*Royal burgh, founded by royal charter.
*Burgh of regality, granted to a nobleman or &quot;lord of regality&quot;.
*Burgh of barony, granted to a tenant-in-chief, with narrower powers.
*Parliamentary burgh or burgh constituency, a type of parliamentary constituency.
*Police burgh, a burgh operating a &quot;police system&quot; of town government.

===Modern history===
Until 1833, each burgh had a different constitution or &quot;sett&quot;. The government of the burgh was often in the hands of a self-nominating corporation, and few local government functions were performed: these were often left to ad hoc bodies.

Two pieces of reforming legislation were enacted in 1833: The Royal Burghs (Scotland) Act 1833 (3 &amp; 4 Will. 4. c. 76) and the Burgh Police (Scotland) Act 1833 (3 &amp; 4 Will. 4. c. 46).

The Royal Burghs (Scotland) Act 1833 (3 &amp; 4 Will. 4. c. 76) provided for the election of magistrates and councillors. Each burgh was to have a common council consisting of a provost (or lord provost), magistrates (or bailies) and councillors. Every parliamentary elector living within the &quot;royalty&quot; or area of the royal burgh, or within seven statute miles of its boundary, was entitled to vote in burgh elections. One third of the common council was elected each year. The councillors selected a number of their members to be bailies, who acted as a magistrates bench for the burgh and dealt with such issues as licensing. The provost, or chief magistrate, was elected from among the council every three years. The Royal Burghs Act was also extended to the 12 parliamentary burghs which had recently been enfranchised. These were growing industrial centres, and apart from the lack of a charter, they had identical powers and privileges to the royal burghs. Royal Burghs retained the right to corporate property or &quot;common good&quot;. This property was used for the advantage of the inhabitants of the burgh, funding such facilities as public parks, museums and civic events.

The Burgh Police (Scotland) Act 1833 (3 &amp; 4 Will. 4. c. 46) allowed the inhabitants of royal burghs, burghs of regality and of bBarony to adopt a &quot;police system&quot;. &quot;Police&quot; in this sense did not refer to law enforcement, but to various local government activities summarised in the act as &quot;paving, lighting, cleansing, watching, supplying with water, and improving such Burghs respectively, as may be necessary and expedient&quot;. The act could be adopted following its approval in a poll of householders in the burgh. Burghs reformed or created under this and later legislation became known as police burghs. The governing body of a police burgh were the police commissioners. The commissioners were elected by the existing town council of the burgh, not by the electorate at large. The town council of a burgh could by a three-quarters majority become police commissioners for the burgh. In many cases this led to the existence of two parallel burgh administrations, the town council and the police commissioners, each with the same membership, but separate legal identity and powers. Further legislation, the Police (Scotland) Act 1850 (13 &amp; 14 Vict. c. 33), allowed &quot;populous places&quot; other than existing burghs to become police burghs.

In 1893, most of the anomalies in the administration of burghs were removed: police commissioners were retitled as councillors and all burghs were to consist of a single body corporate, ending the existence of parallel burghs. All burghs of barony and regality that had not adopted a police system were abolished. Councils were to be headed by a chief magistrate using the &quot;customary title&quot; of the burgh. In 1900, the chief magistrate of every burgh was to be known as the provost – except in burghs granted a lord provost.

The last major legislation to effect burghs came into effect in 1930. The Local Government (Scotland) Act 1929 (19 &amp; 20 Geo. 5. c. 25) divided burghs into three classes: 
*&quot;Counties of cities&quot;: the four largest royal burghs, they combined the powers of a burgh and county council.
*&quot;Large burghs&quot;: independent of the county council except in major services such as police and education.
*&quot;Small burghs&quot;: performing minor local government functions such as street-cleaning, housing, lighting and drainage..

The Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 (c. 65) formally abolished burghs. Section 1(5) of the act stated: &quot;On 16 May 1975, all local government areas existing immediately before that date, that is to say, all counties, counties of cities, large burghs, small burghs and districts, shall cease to exist, and the council of every such area shall also cease to exist.&quot; The use of the title continues in informal use, however.

The common good properties and funds of the royal burghs continue to exist. They are administered by the present area councils, who must make &quot;have regard to the interests of the inhabitants of the area to which the common good formerly related&quot;. The use of these assets are to be for the benefit of the inhabitants of the former burgh. Any person or body holding the honorary freedom &quot;of any place... formerly having the status of a city, burgh or royal burgh&quot; continued to enjoy that status after the 1975 reorganisation.

==Features==

===Provost===

The chief magistrate or convener of a burgh, equivalent to a mayor, was called a provost. Many different titles were in use until the Town Councils (Scotland) Act 1900 standardised the term as &quot;provost&quot;, except in cities with a lord provost. Since 1975 local authorities have been free to choose the title of their convener and provosts are appointed to chair a number of area and community councils.

===Bailies===
Under the provost were magistrates or baillies who both acted as councillors, and in the enforcement of laws. As well as general tasks, they often had specific tasks such as inspecting wine, or ale, or other products sold at market. The title of bailie ceased to have any statutory meaning in 1975, although modern area councils do sometimes make appointments to the office on a purely ceremonial basis. For example, Glasgow City Council grants the title in an honorary capacity to senior councillors, while Stirling Council appoints four bailies to act in lieu of the provost in specific geographical areas.

===Burgesses===
A resident granted the rights of a &quot;freeman&quot; of the burgh, was styled a burgess (&quot;pl. burgesses&quot;), a title also used in English boroughs. These freemen and their wives were a class which did not include dependants (e.g. apprentices) and servants, though they were not guaranteed to be wealthy.

This was a title held by one of the bailies of the burgh who presided over a Dean of Guild Court which was given the specific duty of building control. The courts were abolished in 1975, with building regulation transferred to the relevant local authority. Appointments to the office of Dean of Guild are still made in some areas: for instance the Lord Dean of Guild of Glasgow is described as the &quot;second citizen of Glasgow&quot; after the Lord Provost although the appointment is in the hands of the Merchants House of Glasgow, and not the city council.

===Trading privileges===
Early Burghs were granted the power to trade, which allowed them to control trade until the 19th century. The population of burgesses could be roughly divided between merchants and craftsmen, and the tensions between the interests of the two classes was often a feature of the cities. Craftsmen were usually organised into guilds. Merchants also had a guild, but many merchants did not belong to it, and it would be run by a small group of the most powerful merchants. The class of merchants included all traders, from stall-holders and pack-men to shop-holders and traders of considerable wealth.

==Etymology==
As used in this article, the Scots language word is derived from the Old English . In Scotland it refers to corporate entities whose legality is peculiar to Scotland. (Scottish law was protected and preserved as distinct from laws of England under the Acts of Union of 1707.) Another variant pronunciation, , is heard in several Cumbrian place names, e.g. Burgh by Sands, Longburgh, Drumburgh, Mayburgh Henge.

The English language &quot;borough&quot;, like the Scots , is derived from the same Old English language word (whose dative singular and nominative/accusative plural form sometimes underlies modern place-names, and which had dialectal variants including &quot;burg&quot;; it was also sometimes confused with , , &#x27;mound, hill&#x27;, on which see Hall 2001, 69–70). The Old English word was originally used for a fortified town or proto-castle (e.g. at Dover Castle or Burgh Castle) and was related to the verb (cf. Dutch and German ) &#x27;to keep, save, make secure&#x27;. In the German language, means &#x27;castle&#x27; or &#x27;fortress&#x27;, though so many towns grew up around castles that it almost came to mean &quot;city&quot;, and is incorporated into many placenames, such as Hamburg, Flensburg and Strasburg.

The word has cognates in other Germanic languages. For example, in German, and in both Danish and Swedish. The equivalent word is also to be found in Frisian, Dutch, Norwegian, Icelandic and Faroese. Burgh in placenames is found in its greatest UK concentration in the East Anglia region of southern England, where also the word has taken the form &quot;bury&quot;, as in Canterbury.

A number of other European languages have cognate words which were borrowed from the Germanic languages during the Middle Ages, including in Irish, or , meaning &#x27;wall, rampart&#x27; in Welsh, in French, in Italian, and in Spanish (hence the place-name Burgos).

The most obviously derivative words are in English, in German or in Dutch (literally &#x27;citizen&#x27;, with connotations of middle-class in English and other Germanic languages). Also related are the words and &quot;belfry&quot; (both from the French), and &quot;burglar&quot;. More distantly, it is related to words meaning &#x27;hill&#x27; or &#x27;mountain&#x27; in a number of languages (cf. the second element of &quot;iceberg&quot;).

<text>Eyemouth is a small town and civil parish in Berwickshire, in the Scottish Borders area of Scotland. It is east of the main north–south A1 road and north of Berwick-upon-Tweed.

The town&#x27;s name comes from its location at the mouth of the Eye Water. The Berwickshire coastline consists of high cliffs over deep clear water with sandy coves and picturesque harbours. A fishing port, Eyemouth holds a yearly Herring Queen Festival. Notable buildings in the town include Gunsgreen House and a cemetery watch-house built to stand guard against the Resurrectionists (body snatchers). Many of the features of a traditional fishing village are preserved in the narrow streets and &quot;vennels&quot;.

Eyemouth is not far from the small villages of Ayton, Reston, St Abbs, Coldingham, and Burnmouth, all in Berwickshire.

The coast offers opportunities for birdwatching, walking, fishing and diving. Accommodation includes several hotels, B&amp;Bs and a holiday park. 

==A 16th-century artillery fortress==

Fort Point at Eyemouth was the site of the first &quot;trace-italienne&quot;-style fortification in Britain, built on a spur or peninsula overlooking the existing harbour during the war known as the Rough Wooing. Building commenced in 1547 by the English military engineer Sir Richard Lee (1513–1575), and it cost £1,906. Some of the stone was brought from a demolished tower at Dunglass Castle, East Lothian and timber was taken from Coldingham Priory.

The fort was demolished under the Treaty of Boulogne in 1551. A larger and more complex fort was built in 1557 by d&#x27;Oisel and probably the Italian military engineer Lorenzo Pomarelli for the Regent of Scotland, Mary of Guise, when at war with England. The new fortress could hold some 500 French troops, and may have been intended as a staging post to securely store munitions and artillery near Berwick-upon-Tweed and the border with England. New fortifications were built at Berwick in response. However, the new work at Eyemouth, which perhaps was never completed, was scheduled for demolition under the Treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis in 1559. French garrisons remained in Scotland at Dunbar Castle, Inchkeith, and at Leith. Traces of the ramparts are still to be seen.

==History of Eyemouth==
Eyemouth fell within the feudal barony of Coldingham, possessed until the early 17th century by Coldingham Priory, after which it passed to the Home family, who had held lands in that barony since at least the 15th century. All landowners (portioners) within the barony held their properties either by hereditary feu or by a term-renewable, occasionally hereditary, tack (Scots word for a lease) from the barony.

The lands between the southern banks of the Eye Water consisted of three estates: Gunsgreen, immediately opposite Eyemouth and Netherbyres, once part of the larger lands of Flemington which stretched all the way to Lamberton. At the beginning of the 17th century Gunsgreen estate was possessed by Alexander Lauder of Gunsgreen, a great-great-grandson of Sir Robert Lauder of The Bass (d.1508). On 17 January 1629, Alexander Lauder of Gunsgreen, acting as bailie for Sir David Home of Wedderburn, gave a sasine to Andrew Gray in Eyemouth, of some land on the boundaries of Houndlaw and also in Eyemouth.
Netherbyres was for at least 250 years held by the Craw (originally Auchincraw) family. &quot;George Craw of Netherbyre&quot; was &quot;deceased&quot; by July 1614 when his son William came into possession of that property and Reidhall, &quot;with the walk mill&quot; extending to 12 husbandlands (). A later William Craw, who had a passion for mathematics, built the first &#x27;modern&#x27; harbour at Eyemouth and, in 1715, the elliptical walled garden, the latter almost certainly unique in the world. The Netherbyres House we see today was commenced about 1835 for Captain Sir Samuel Brown, R.N., who had the patent and monopoly for the supply of anchor chain to the Royal Navy. He later went on to design and patent chain suspension piers and bridges, including the Union Bridge over the River Tweed, Still in use today. Netherbyres House was bought by Sir Christopher Furness, 2nd Bt. in 1928, and was donated to Gardeners&#x27; Royal Benevolent Society for charitable use by his second son, Colonel Simon Furness, the Vice Lord Lieutenant for Berwickshire, who now occupies a house overlooking the walled garden.
Hero William Spears (1812–1885), is celebrated by the dramatic bronze statue in Eyemouth Market Place, where he stands pointing the way to Ayton, the scene of his peaceful demonstration. Spears led a revolt against the tithes on fish levied by the Church of Scotland, even after the great Disruption of 1843 when most fishermen left the established Church to join other congregations.

Very soon after the cost of getting the tithes removed had been met, the town was struck by the Eyemouth Disaster when, on 14 October 1881, most of the fishing fleet, some 20 boats and 129 men from the town, were lost in a terrible storm. Including victims from other coastal towns, a total of 189 men lost their lives. This is commemorated in the Eyemouth Tapestry Housed in the Museum.

A contemporary article offers an interesting insight into Eyemouth in the 1860s:

&quot;Between St Abbs Head and Berwick, however is situated Eyemouth, a fishing village pure and simple, with all that wonderful
filth scattered about which is a sanitary peculiarity of such towns.

The population of Eyemouth is in keeping with the outward appearance of the place. As a whole, they are rough, uncultivated,
and more drunken in their habits than the fishermen of the neighbouring villages. Coldingham Shore, for instance, is only
three miles distant, and has a population of about one hundred fishermen, of a very respectable class, sober and well dressed,
and &quot;well to do.&quot; – &quot;The Fisher Folk of the Scottish East Coast, &quot;Macmillian&#x27;s Magazine&quot; No.36 October 1862.&quot;
In the late 18th century, with the arrival of a group of Dutch engineers in the town, a survey was undertaken for a canal linking Eyemouth to Duns. The plan would have involved damming the Whiteadder Water at Chirnside thus diverting the course of the Whiteadder Water through the low-lying area known as Billiemire to join the Eye Water near Ayton. The plan was never carried out.

From 1891 until 1962, the town was served by a short branch railway line that ran from on the present-day East Coast Main Line. The line was forced to close from August 1948 to June 1949 after being damaged by the flooding of the Eye Water.
John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough was created Lord Churchill of Eyemouth in the Peerage of Scotland in 1682. This was the first of his peerage titles.

==Transport==
The A1 road, the main Edinburgh – Newcastle route, puts the town within commuting distance of Edinburgh.

Eyemouth railway station served the town until it was closed in 1962. The nearest railway station is Reston railway station, The 253 operated Borders Buses stops at Reston railway station

==Education==
Eyemouth Public School, in Albert Road, was built in 1876, designed by the architect William Gray Junior.

Children attend Eyemouth Primary School, after which they attend Eyemouth High School.

There is a further education training centre in the town. Northumberland College in Berwick-upon-Tweed is eight miles (13 km) away, and full-time further and higher education courses are offered at Borders College and Heriot-Watt University&#x27;s textiles campus in Galashiels.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC Scotland and ITV Border. Television signals are received from the local relay transmitter.

Eyemouth&#x27;s local radio stations are BBC Radio Scotland on 94.1 FM and Greatest Hits Radio Scottish Borders and North Northumberland on 103.4 FM.

The Border Telegraph and Southern Reporter are the town&#x27;s local newspapers.

== Harbour and industry ==

In 1997, Eyemouth was given EU funding from a scheme to regenerate declining fishing villages and raised matching funds itself to construct a deep water extension to the harbour. Eyemouth Harbour caters for most types of fishery activity and as a result Eyemouth&#x27;s primary industry has seen a certain amount of rejuvenation. A pontoon has been installed in the harbour to provide ease of boarding for seafarers. Volunteers for Her Majesty&#x27;s Coastguard and the seagoing RNLI lifeboat are called out by the firing of maroons, one for the Coastguard and two for the Lifeboat.

There is a boatyard which carries out works to fishing and commercial vessels. The new harbour and fish market has toilets and showers which are available to visiting seamen. The visitor centre explains the methods of fishing, the types of nets and the vessels used and examples of the equipment of a typical fishing boat are displayed. Visitors can see the market in action in the early mornings from a viewing platform. Boats are available for hire for sea fishing, sightseeing and diving in one of the few marine reserves in Britain.

The &quot;Eyemouth pale&quot; is a cold-smoked haddock, distinct from varieties such as Finnan haddock by its lighter, golden hue, and subtler smoked flavour, achieved by a shorter smoking time.

==Politics==
The elected Eyemouth Town Community Council is led by a Chairman and has 12 members, including an Honorary Provost. Three representatives of Scottish Borders Council attend monthly public meetings in order to take on board and act upon feedback from the community councillors, who serve as a voice of the people of the town. Eyemouth Town Community Council (a Scottish Community Council), meets on the last Monday of the month (except in December) at 7.00pm in the community centre, minutes of the meetings being displayed on their website, on two notice boards in the town and also in the &quot;Berwickshire News.&quot;

== Attractions ==

The wide sandy bay is flanked by high cliffs. Despite being sheltered by Hurkur Rocks, storms can generate high waves and throw high plumes of spume into the air over the sea wall. It is named &quot;The Bantry&quot;, said to be in affectionate memory of the Irish labourers from the fishing town of that name in County Cork who constructed it.

The 18 hole golf course and clubhouse have sea views and a restaurant which is open to the public.

Divers can visit to the St Abbs and Eyemouth Voluntary Marine Reserve.

Eyemouth also has a leisure centre consisting of a gym, a studio, a sauna and two swimming pools, one small with a maximum depth of less than 3 feet and a big pool with a minimum depth of 3 feet to a maximum depth of 10 feet.

===Nearby places of interest===
Other places of interest nearby include the fortifications of Berwick-upon-Tweed also designed by Sir Richard Lee, and its military museum, Paxton House, the Union Bridge and the Chain Bridge Honey Farm, and scores of quiet country roads skirting the Cheviot Hills, frequently snow-capped in winter. Many visitors pause on their journey on the A1 to photograph their arrival in Scotland or their departure to England at the border crossing. Though the border has significance to many visitors, most residents of Eyemouth consider themselves Scottish rather than British. Nearby the border is a nature trail through the mysteriously named &#x27;Conundrum&#x27; Farm. Typical Border towns and villages, such as Kelso, Grantshouse, Abbey St Bathans, Cove, Cockburnspath (pronounced &#x27;coburnspath&#x27; or &#x27;copath&#x27; by locals), Cornhill, Wooler, Morpeth, Alnmouth and Alnwick are all within easy reach for day trips from Eyemouth. Near Chirnside stood Ninewells House, since demolished, where Scottish Enlightenment philosopher David Hume spent much of his life.

<doc id="389787" wikidata="Q368299" url="?curid=389787" title="Sir Francis Bernard, 1st Baronet">
<text>Sir Francis Bernard, 1st Baronet (bapt. 12 July 1712 – 16 June 1779) was a British colonial administrator who served as governor of the provinces of New Jersey and Massachusetts Bay. His uncompromising policies and harsh tactics in Massachusetts angered the colonists and were instrumental in the building of broad-based opposition within the province to the rule of Parliament in the events leading to the American Revolution.

Appointed governor of New Jersey in 1758, he oversaw the province&#x27;s participation in the later years of the French and Indian War, and had a generally positive relationship with its legislature. In 1760 he was given the governorship of Massachusetts, where he had a stormy relationship with the assembly. Early actions turned the colony&#x27;s populists against him, and his responses to protests against Parliament&#x27;s attempts to tax the colonies deepened divisions. After protests against the Townshend Acts in 1768, Bernard sought British Army troops be stationed in Boston to oversee the colonists. He was recalled after the publication of letters in which he was critical of the colony.

After returning to England, he continued to advise the British government on colonial matters, calling for hardline responses to ongoing difficulties in Massachusetts that culminated in the 1773 Boston Tea Party. He suffered a stroke in 1771 and died in 1779, leaving a large family.

==Early life==

Bernard was born in Brightwell-cum-Sotwell, (then in Berkshire, but part of Oxfordshire since 1974), England to the Rev. Francis and Margery (Winslowe) Bernard and was christened on 12 July 1712. His father died three years later. His mother remarried, but died of smallpox in 1718. He was thereafter probably raised by an aunt for several years since his stepfather was forced by a failed courtship to flee to Holland. His stepfather, Anthony Alsop, returned to Berkshire a few years later, and continued to play a role in the boy&#x27;s upbringing. Bernard&#x27;s formal education began at Westminster in 1725, and he then spent seven years at Oxford, where Christ Church granted him a Master of Arts in 1736. He read law at the Middle Temple and was called to the bar in 1737, after only four years (instead of the typical seven) of study. He settled in Lincoln, where he practised law and took on a variety of municipal posts. Among his neighbours in Lincoln were the Pownalls, who had one son (John) serving in the Colonial Office, and another, Thomas, who went to the North American colonies in 1753 and was appointed governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay in 1757.

Bernard married Amelia Offley, daughter of the sheriff of Derbyshire, in December 1741, and the couple raised a large family: by 1757 the couple had eight living children. Because his prospects for further income to support this large family were unlikely in Lincoln, he apparently decided to seek a posting in the colonies. John Adams later described Bernard as &quot;avaricious to a most infamous degree; needy at the same time, having a numerous family to provide for&quot;.

==Governor of New Jersey==

Bernard&#x27;s wife was cousin to Lord Barrington, who became a Privy councillor in 1755. Probably through his connections to Barrington and the Pownalls, he secured an appointment as governor of the Province of New Jersey on 27 January 1758, a post that became available upon the death of Jonathan Belcher. Leaving some of his children with relatives, the couple sailed for North America with four of their children, arriving at Perth Amboy on 14 June 1758.

The colonies were in the middle of the French and Indian War at the time of Bernard&#x27;s arrival. He established a good working relationship with New Jersey&#x27;s assembly, and was able to convince the province to raise troops and funds for the ongoing war effort. He signed the Treaty of Easton, an agreement between New Jersey and Pennsylvania on one side, and a group of Indigenous tribes (the Minisink and Lenape being of principal concern to New Jersey) fixing boundaries between colonial and Native lands. This effort was important, for it reduced raiding on the frontiers and made possible the reallocation of provincial military strength to the war with New France. It and other agreements negotiated by Bernard extinguished all of the remaining Indian titles to New Jersey. Negotiations with the Lenape also resulted in the establishment of the first formal Indian reservation, Brotherton, near present-day Indian Mills. This reservation was only sparsely populated, and was abandoned in 1801 when its remaining inhabitants joined the Stockbridge Indians in upstate New York.

==Governor of Massachusetts==

Through the influence of his connections in the Colonial Office, Bernard was appointed governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay in late 1759. Delays in communications and slow travel were such that Bernard did not arrive in Boston until 2 August 1760. Although initially warmly welcomed, his tenure in Massachusetts was difficult. Bernard sought to vigorously enforce the Navigation Acts, in part because crown officials (including the governor and the customs officials) received shares of the proceeds from the seizure of ships that were caught violating the acts. The legal actions involving these seizures were heard in a jury-less admiralty court before a Crown-appointed judge, and were extremely unpopular. Bernard also made an early opponent of James Otis Jr. by appointing Lieutenant Governor Thomas Hutchinson to be chief justice of the province&#x27;s highest court, a post that had been promised by several previous governors to Otis&#x27; father. Upset over the snub the younger Otis resigned his post as advocate general (i.e. the Crown&#x27;s representative, equivalent to a government prosecutor) before the admiralty court, and devoted himself instead to arguing (sometimes &quot;pro bono&quot;) on behalf of the merchants in defence of their ships. These early actions during Bernard&#x27;s tenure drew a clear dividing line between the &quot;popular party&quot; (exemplified by the Otises) opposed to British colonial policy and the &quot;court party&quot; (exemplified by Hutchinson) who supported it.

Bernard&#x27;s difficulties were compounded when, after the death in late 1760 of King George II, it became necessary to reissue writs of assistance to customs tax collectors. These writs, which were essentially open-ended search warrants, were judicially controversial and so unpopular that their issuance was later explicitly disallowed by the United States Constitution. Hutchinson, who approved the writs in one of his first acts as chief justice, saw his popularity fall, and Otis, who argued the writs violated the Rights of Englishmen, gained in popularity. He was elected to the provincial legislature in May 1761, where he was well placed to continue his attacks on Bernard&#x27;s policies. In the 1761 session of the assembly Otis engineered the gift of Mount Desert Island to Bernard, a partially successful stratagem to divert Bernard&#x27;s attention from ongoing customs seizures.

 Bernard&#x27;s unpopularity continued through other tax measures, including the Sugar Act (1763) and the Stamp Act (1765). While the passage of both acts occasioned protest, the response to the Stamp Act included rioting in the streets, and united many factions in the province against the governor. In 1767 the passage by Parliament of the Townshend Acts again raised a storm of protest in the colonies. In Massachusetts the provincial assembly issued a circular letter, calling on the other colonies to join it in a boycott of the goods subject to the Townshend taxes. Bernard was ordered in April 1768 by Lord Hillsborough, who had recently been appointed to the newly created office of Colonial Secretary, to dissolve the assembly if it failed to retract the letter. The assembly refused, and Bernard prorogued it in July.

Bernard commissioned Boston printer Richard Draper as the official printer for the Massachusetts provincial government and employed him to use his newspaper, &quot;The Boston News-Letter&quot;, to give voice to the Loyalist factions in Boston. Maier maintains that Bernard&#x27;s letters to London greatly influenced officials there, but they &quot;distorted&quot; reality. &quot;His misguided conviction that the &#x27;faction&#x27; had espoused violence as its primary method of opposition, for example, kept him from recognizing the radicals&#x27; peace-keeping efforts...Equally dangerous, Bernard&#x27;s elaborate accounts were sometimes built on insubstantial evidence.&quot; Warden argues that Bernard was careful not to explicitly ask London for troops, but his exaggerated accounts strongly suggested they were needed. In the fall of 1767 he warned about a possible insurrection in Boston any day, and his exaggerated report of one disturbance in 1768, &quot;certainly had given Lord Hillsboro the impression that troops were the only way to enforce obedience in the town&quot;. Warden notes that other key British officials in Boston wrote London with the &quot;same strain of hysteria&quot;. Four thousand British Army troops arrived in Boston in October 1768, further heightening tensions. Bernard was vilified in the local press, and accused of writing letters to the ministry that mischaracterized the situation. Although he was challenged to release those letters he refused. Opposition agents in London were eventually able to acquire some of his letters, which reached members of the Sons of Liberty in April 1769. They were promptly published by the radical &quot;Boston Gazette&quot;, along with deliberations of the governor&#x27;s council. One letter in particular, in which Bernard called for changes to the Massachusetts charter to increase the governor&#x27;s power by increasing the council&#x27;s dependence on him, was the subject of particularly harsh treatment, and prompted the assembly to formally request that &quot;he might be forever removed from the Government of the Province&quot;. He was recalled to England, and Lieutenant Governor Hutchinson became acting governor. When Bernard left Boston on 1 August, the town held an impromptu celebration, decorated the Liberty Tree, and rang church bells.

His accomplishments in Massachusetts included the design of Harvard Hall at Harvard University and the construction of a summer estate on Pond Street in Jamaica Plain.

==Return to England==

Upon his return to England, he asked for and received a hearing concerning the colonial petition against his rule. The Privy Council in February 1770 considered the petition, and after deliberation dismissed all of the charges as &quot;groundless, vexatious, and scandalous&quot;. Despite this vindication, Bernard resigned as governor in 1771. He was confirmed in the ownership of Mount Desert Island, a recognition he had been seeking since it was awarded to him in 1761. Although he had been promised a baronetcy and a pension of £1,000 for his service, he learned after his return that the pension had been reduced to £500 (the baronetcy, of Nettleham, was awarded at crown expense). His appeals on the matter were at first rejected, but when Lord North became Prime Minister in 1770, the pension was raised, but shortly after replaced by an appointment as commissioner on the Board of Revenue for Ireland, which paid the same amount.

Bernard became an advisor to the North administration on matters concerning the colonies. He generally took a harder line than his predecessor Thomas Pownall, who advocated for colonial interests in Parliament. Proposals he made in 1771 included ideas central to the 1774 Massachusetts Government Act, which severely constrained colonial political power, including a council appointed by the governor rather than one elected by the assembly. Bernard may also have played a role in the difficulties Benjamin Franklin had in being recognized as a colonial agent; after Franklin&#x27;s credentials were refused by the colonial secretary, he encountered Bernard in an antechamber. Biographer Colin Nicolson observes that Bernard&#x27;s presence as an advisor to the ministry &quot;cast a shadow on virtually every American measure regarding Massachusetts that [Lord Frederick] North pursued between 1770 and 1774&quot;, because of Bernard&#x27;s role in breaking the trust between the colonists and the London government and the subsequent radicalization of Massachusetts politics.

In 1774, when the North government was considering how to respond to the Boston Tea Party, Bernard published &quot;Select Letters on Trade and Government&quot;, containing proposals on how to deal with the ongoing difficulties in the colonies. He proposed to reconcile the constitutional grievances of the British and radical Americans by the possible introduction of American representatives into the Parliament of Great Britain. In the &quot;Select Letters&quot;, which included the essay &quot;Principles of Law and Polity&quot; which he drafted in 1764, he laid out a point-by-point exposition of his viewpoints concerning imperial governance. Some of his ideas were enacted, notably those enshrined in the Massachusetts Government Act; the outrage in London even sparked the sympathetic colonial advocate Thomas Pownall to propose the closure of Boston&#x27;s port, which was enacted in the Boston Port Act.

==Decline and death==
In late 1771 Bernard was bequeathed the manor at Nether Winchendon upon the death of a cousin to whom he had been close since childhood. Combined with other uncertainties about where various family members would reside after he received the Irish appointment, the stress of the situation led Bernard to suffer a stroke. His mobility was impaired, but he took the waters at Bath, which appear to have helped his recovery. He applied for permission to resign from the Irish post, and settled first at the Nether Winchendon manor; in 1774 his resignation was accepted and his pension restored. He was well enough in 1772 to travel to Oxford, where he received an honorary Doctor of Civil Law from his alma mater, Christ Church. Because of his health he moved later in 1772 to a smaller house in nearby Aylesbury. He died on 16 June 1779, after an epileptic seizure, at Nether Winchendon; his grave is in St Mary&#x27;s churchyard, Aylesbury.

==Legacy==
Bernard never believed the difficulties he had in Massachusetts were personal: instead of accepting some responsibility, he blamed his problems on the policies emanating from London that he was instructed to implement. John Adams wrote that Bernard&#x27;s &quot;antagonistic reports&quot; of matters in Massachusetts were instrumental in turning British government policymakers against colonial interests. Bernard&#x27;s name headed a list drawn up in Massachusetts after the American Revolutionary War broke out of &quot;notorious conspirators against the government&quot;, and most of his property there was confiscated. Mount Desert Island was not entirely taken; Bernard&#x27;s son John, who resided in Maine during the war and sided with the victorious colonials, was able to receive Massachusetts title to half of the island.

Upon the election of James Bowdoin to be Governor of Massachusetts in 1786, Reverend William Gordon in his sermon warned Bowdoin that he ignored the state&#x27;s legislature at his peril, as Bernard had.

The Charter of Bernardston, authorized and signed by King George II formally recognized Bernardston in the Province of New Jersey on 24 May 1760. At the time, Bernardston included the current areas of Basking Ridge, Lyons, Liberty Corner, Bernardsville and Far Hills. The area would later be renamed Bernards Township. Vealtown, New Jersey, a town first settled around 1715 and located in Bernards Township, was renamed Bernardsville in Bernard&#x27;s honour in 1840. Bernardston, Massachusetts was incorporated during his Massachusetts administration and is named for him. Bernard also named Berkshire County, Massachusetts (after his county of birth) and Pittsfield, Massachusetts (after British Prime Minister William Pitt).

<doc id="389789" wikidata="Q1010531" url="?curid=389789" title="Forres">
<text>Forres (; ) is a town and former royal burgh in the north of Scotland on the Moray coast, approximately northeast of Inverness and west of Elgin. Forres has been a winner of the Scotland in Bloom award on several occasions. There are many geographical and historical attractions nearby such as the River Findhorn, and there are also classical, historical artifacts and monuments within the town itself, such as Forres Tolbooth and Nelson&#x27;s Tower. Brodie Castle, the home of the Brodie Clan, lies to the west of the town, close to the A96.

== Pre-history and archaeology ==
Between 2002 and 2013 some 70 hectares of land was investigated by archaeologists in advance of a proposed residential development on the southern fringes of the town. They found an extensive Iron Age settlement and evidence that people lived in the area from the Neolithic (radiocarbon dates from the 4th to the mid-3rd millennium BC were found) to the Early Historic period (they found radiocarbon dates from the 9th–12th centuries AD, around the time that historical records began). The Iron Age settlement had a souterrain and metalworking furnaces, and they found Neolithic and Bronze Age ceramics and cup-marked rock art. The excavation of a souterrain in Moray is quite rare; only one other souterrain had been excavated in Moray before this one.

==History==
The earliest written reference to Forres may be the (&quot;&quot;, &#x27;Varar Estuary&#x27;) mentioned in the second century Geography of Claudius Ptolemy. The town is the location of Sueno&#x27;s Stone, an enormous carved stone probably created by Picts to commemorate a battle against Norse invaders. The stele is tall and encased in glass structure to protect it from the elements and graffiti. Sueno&#x27;s Stone translates to Sven&#x27;s Stone. It dates from AD 850 to AD 950.

A royal castle was present in the area from at least 900 AD, and around 1140 AD Forres became a royal burgh. Royal burghs were founded by the Kings of Scots of the 12th century to encourage trade and economic improvement. The local abbey was plundered by the Wolf of Badenoch in 1390.
On 23 June 1496 King James IV of Scotland issued a Royal Charter laying down the rights and privileges that the town&#x27;s people are believed to have held by an earlier charter since the reign of King David I some 300 years earlier.

Brodie Castle, which was commissioned by Brodie family in 1567, lies to the west of the town.

William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Macbeth&quot;, first performed in 1606, locates Duncan&#x27;s castle in Forres, and the Three Witches meet on moorland near the town in the third scene of the drama.

The Dallas Dhu distillery, established in 1898, lies just south of the town; although no longer producing, the distillery is maintained in working order by Historic Environment Scotland. Benromach Distillery, also established in 1898, is located just north of the Forres bypass and is an active distillery with a visitors&#x27; centre.

The Findhorn Foundation, an intentional community, was established in the town in the 1940s. The former RAF Forres, established during the Second World War, is located nearby.

In January 2016, Glasgow School of Art established a campus in the town which focuses on design and innovation.

==Demography==
The population of Forres expanded in the 20th century and was over 12,000 in 2011. 

==Geography and economy==
Sitting between the floodplain of the River Findhorn and the wooded slopes of Cluny and Sanquhar Hills, Forres is well known for its award-winning floral sculptures.

==Parliamentary burgh==

Forres was a parliamentary burgh, combined with Inverness, Fortrose and Nairn, in the Inverness Burghs constituency of the House of Commons of the Parliament of Great Britain from 1708 to 1801 and of the Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1801 to 1918. The constituency was abolished in 1918 and the Forres and Nairn components were merged into the then new constituency of Moray and Nairn. Forres Town Hall, originally built as a masonic hall and later used as a mechanics institute before becoming a municipal building, was completed in 1829.

==Notable residents==

==Climate==
As with the rest of the British Isles and Scotland, Forres experiences a maritime climate with cool summers and mild winters. The nearest official Met Office weather station for which online records are available is Kinloss, about north east of the town centre. The lowest temperature to be recorded in recent years was during December 2010.

==Transport==

Forres is situated on the A96 trunk route connecting the cities of Aberdeen and Inverness. The River Findhorn was originally crossed by fording near Waterford Farm. A suspension bridge was opened in 1831 to cross the river at the west end of the town. This bridge was replaced by the current bridge in 1938. Due to high volumes of traffic passing through the town centre, a bypass was built in the late 1980s to reduce congestion in the town centre. A new, dual carriageway A96 bypass is planned by the Scottish Government.

Forres railway station is situated just outside the town and is operated by ScotRail. The town of Forres was once a triangular junction in the Highland Railway network, travelling through Forres was once the quickest route to reach Inverness from the south. Originally the station had four platforms; two of which were on the north side of the triangle on the route between Inverness and Aberdeen, the third on the south west side of the triangle used by services to Grantown-on-Spey. The fourth was a short platform on the south east side used by through services between Elgin and Aviemore via Grantown. Trains from Grantown towards Nairn or Inverness had to run through the station and then reverse back into the Aberdeen to Inverness platform. The service to Grantown-on-Spey was closed in the 1960s and now forms part of The Dava Way, a scenic footpath connecting the two towns.

<text>Robert William Dale (1 December 1829 – 13 March 1895) was an English Congregational church leader based in Birmingham.

==Life==

Dale was born in London and educated at Spring Hill College, Birmingham, for the Congregational ministry. In 1853 he was invited to Carr&#x27;s Lane Chapel, Birmingham, as co-pastor with John Angell James, on whose death in 1859 he became sole pastor for the rest of his life. In the University of London M.A. examination (1853), he came first in philosophy and won the gold medal. The degree of LL.D. was conferred upon him in 1883 by the University of Glasgow during the lord rectorship of John Bright. Yale University gave him its D.D. degree, although he never used it. He served as Chairman of the Congregational Union of England and Wales in 1868 and President of the International Congregational Council in 1891.

==Views and publications==
Dale normally read his sermons, because &quot;if I spoke extemporaneously I should never sit down again&quot;. He did not use the title &quot;Reverend&quot;. He was a strong advocate of the disestablishment of the Church of England, holding that the Christian church was essentially a spiritual brotherhood, and that any vestige of political authority impaired its spiritual work. In church government he believed strongly that congregationalism was the most fitting environment for Christianity. He published lectures on such topics as &quot;The Atonement&quot; (1875, and frequently reprinted), sermons, and the &quot;Manual of Congregational Principles&quot; (1884); and, at his death, he left an unfinished history of Congregationalism, revised by his son, A. W. W. Dale.

==The &quot;Civic Gospel&quot; and politics==
Dale&#x27;s integrity, intelligence, moral passion and oratory soon made him a national figure in an age when the strength of non-conformity was at its highest. He welcomed social improvement and was an advocate, with George Dawson, of what became known in Birmingham as the Civic Gospel. The health, housing, sanitation and living conditions in Birmingham had suffered from its rapid population expansion in the previous thirty years. Dale argued &quot;the public duty of the state is the private duty of every citizen&quot;: service on the town council to improve the wellbeing of Birmingham was advocated by Dale as having moral and religious worth. He was an advocate of free public education, social improvement, the extension of the franchise, the recognition of trades unions, and understanding the links between poverty and crime.

Although Dale did not preach politics, he was a keen Liberal and worked with other Birmingham reformers and radicals including Joseph Chamberlain, William Kenrick, Jesse Collings, George Dixon, John Bright, John Henry Chamberlain, William Harris, and Samuel Timmins. He played a major part in opposing the religious elements of the Forster Education Act of 1870 (see below).

He was a member of the Arts Club, which existed from 1873 to 1880 for the purpose &quot;of facilitating the daily social intercourse of gentlemen professing Liberal opinions, who are engaged or interested in the public life of Birmingham&quot;: it was described in a local newspaper as &quot;the real seat of government, where all measures are framed for the ordering of our municipal, social, charitable, and political institutions&quot;.

When Joseph Chamberlain resigned from the Liberal government in 1886 over William Gladstone&#x27;s proposals for Irish Home Rule, Dale supported him. This point marked a significant split in the Liberal party, but did not reduce Dale&#x27;s influence.

==Work in education==
When Forster&#x27;s Elementary Education Bill appeared, Dale attacked it. He argued that the resulting schools would often be purely denominational institutions and the Bill&#x27;s &quot;conscience clause&quot; gave inadequate protection to Nonconformists. Dale criticised the way school boards would be empowered to make grants out of the rates to maintain sectarian schools. He was himself in favour of secular education, claiming that it was the only logical solution and was consistent with Nonconformist principles. In Birmingham this controversy was ended in 1879 by a compromise.

His interest in educational affairs had led him to accept a seat on the Birmingham school board. He was appointed a governor of Foundation of the Schools of King Edward VI in Birmingham and served on the Royal Commission of Education. Dale took a great interest in Spring Hill Congregational College, Moseley (where he had previously studied). Largely due to his initiative, Spring Hill College, renamed Mansfield College after its founders, was moved to Oxford in 1886 and he became chairman of the council of what is now Mansfield College, Oxford.

==Later years==
The 1886 split within the Liberal Party over Irish Home Rule marked the disintegration of what had been a close-knit circle of like-minded reformers. In 1892, looking back to the 1870s, Dale wrote:


==Death and commemoration==
Dale died on 13 March 1895 and was buried in Key Hill Cemetery, Hockley.

A statue of Dale sculpted by Edward Onslow Ford in 1898 was rediscovered in 1995, and is now on loan from Birmingham Museum &amp; Art Gallery to Carr&#x27;s Lane Church Centre (his old church). The National Portrait Gallery holds a &quot;carte de visite&quot; photograph and a wood engraving of him.

There is a Birmingham Civic Society blue plaque commemorating him on Carrs Lane Church, Carrs Lane, Central Birmingham.

<text>Haddington is a hamlet in the civil parish of Aubourn with Haddington, in the North Kesteven district of Lincolnshire, England. It is situated just off the Fosse Way Roman road, now the A46, south-west from Lincoln and west from Aubourn. Haddington was formerly a township in the parishes of Aubourn and South Hyckham; in 1866 Haddington became a separate civil parish, and on 1 April 1931 the parish was abolished to form &quot;Aubourn, Haddington and South Hykeham&quot;. In 1921 the parish had a population of 94.

==Geography==
It contains a mixture of houses and farm buildings, all brick built, and stands on the north bank of the River Witham 200m from the river. The parish primary school is in South Hykeham.

==Earthworks==

Between the hamlet and the river are the earthworks of what appears to be a considerable manorial complex or grange. However, it has not so far been possible to carry out the archaeological work needed to positively identify them. The complex consists chiefly of one more or less square moated area of 30m by 40m, surrounded by water-filled ditches. A rectangular platform which lies to the west is partly ditched and approximately 100m across; it has the appearance of part of a formal garden. There is a narrow bank across it 20m from the west end, which may conceal a buried wall; it encloses part of the west end, but is unclear at its southern corner. A 30m length of water may have been a symmetrical pond. The remainder of the earthworks continue on a layout almost at right angles to the rest. What is only visible is a medieval dovecote.

==Community==
The ecclesiastical parish is &quot;Aubourn with Haddington&quot; which is part of &quot;The Bassingham Group&quot; of the Deanery of Graffoe. The parish church is St Peter&#x27;s in Aubourn. As at 2014 the incumbent is the Revd Canon Nick Buck. The Bassingham group is very active, styling itself &quot;Withamside United Parish&quot;.

The mobile library visits every month.

There is no scheduled bus route but flexible public transport serves the parish.

<doc id="389793" wikidata="Q847671" url="?curid=389793" title="Kaolack region">
<text>The Kaolack region is a region in Senegal. It borders Gambia and is a common stopping point for travel between Dakar and Banjul. Its borders correspond roughly to the Saalum Kingdom of precolonial days, and the area is still spoken of as the &quot;Saalum&quot; in Wolof, and its inhabitants are called &quot;Saalum-Saalum&quot;.

Kaolack city is the administrative centre for the region. It is a port on the Saloum River. Lying in a farm area, Kaolack is a major peanut marketing and exporting center and has a large peanut oil factory. Brewing, leather tanning, cotton ginning, and fish processing are also important industries. Salt is produced from salines near the Saloum River.

<text>Tobermory (; ) is the capital of, and until 1973 the only burgh on, the Isle of Mull in the Scottish Inner Hebrides. It is located on the east coast of Mishnish, the most northerly part of the island, near the northern entrance of the Sound of Mull. The town was founded as a fishing port in 1788; its layout was based on the designs of Dumfriesshire engineer Thomas Telford. As of 2022 its population was 1,045. It is notable as the location for the 2002–05 children&#x27;s programme &quot;Balamory&quot; by the BBC.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Tobermory&quot; is derived from the Gaelic &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;Mary&#x27;s well&quot;. The name refers to a well located nearby which was dedicated in ancient times to the Virgin Mary.

== Prehistory and archaeology ==
Archaeological excavations have taken place at Baliscate just outside of the town. The site was first noted by Hylda Marsh and Beverley Langhorn as part of the Scotland&#x27;s Rural Past. In 2009, it was partially excavated by &quot;Time Team&quot; and a further longer excavation took place in 2012 as part of a community archaeology project through the Mull Museum.

The different excavations found that there was a sixth-century agricultural settlement which was either adopted or replaced by a seventh-century Christian community with a chapel and cemetery. In the late 11th or early 12th century, a stone and turf structure was built which was probably a longhouse or hall. Then, in the late 13th or early 14th century, a wattle and turf structure was built over these earlier structures. That then burnt down and was replaced by a new stone and turf structure. It was used from the 16th to 19th century intermittently. All of which showed that people had been living and working in the Tobermory area for over 1,000 years before the town was founded.

The site is now a listed monument.

== History ==
Legend has it that the wreck of a Spanish galleon, laden with gold, lies somewhere in the mud at the bottom of Tobermory Bay—although the ship&#x27;s true identity, and cargo, are in dispute. By some accounts, the &quot;Florencia&quot; (or &quot;Florida&quot;, or &quot;San Francisco&quot;), a member of the defeated Spanish Armada fleeing the English fleet in 1588, anchored in Tobermory to take on provisions. Following a dispute over payment (or possibly, according to local folklore, a spell cast by the witch Dòideag), the ship caught fire and the gunpowder magazine exploded, sinking the vessel. In her hold, reputedly, was £300,000 worth of gold bullion.
Other sources claim the vessel was the &quot;San Juan de Sicilia&quot; (or &quot;San Juan de Baptista&quot;), which, records indicate, carried troops, not treasure.
Whatever the true story, no significant treasure has ever been recovered in Tobermory Bay.

Seventeenth-century efforts to salvage the treasure are well-documented. The Duke of Lennox gifted rights to Spanish wrecks near Tobermory to the Marquess of Argyll. In 1666, his son the Earl of Argyll engaged James Maule of Melgum to use diving bells to find treasure, and recover the valuable brass cannon. Maule had learnt diving in Sweden, but raised only two brass guns and an iron cannon, and left after three months. It was later said he had hoped to return, thinking he was the only expert diver. Argyll however raised six cannon by workmen under his direction, and next employed John Saint Clare, or Sinclair, son of the minister of Ormiston, in 1676 and a German sub-contractor Hans Albricht van Treileben, who had worked on the wreck of the &quot;Vasa&quot;. The next year, the earl transferred the rights to Captain Adolpho E. Smith and Treileben. At this period the fore-part of the wreck was visible above water, and was called the &quot;Admiral of Florence&quot;. The project was beset with difficulties in 1678; the Admiralty disputed Argyll&#x27;s rights to the wreck. Captain Adolpho Smith refused to return the diving equipment to William Campbell, captain of the earl&#x27;s frigate, the &quot;Anna of Argyll&quot;. The McLean clan fought the divers on land at Tobermory, led by Hector McLean, brother of Lachlan McLean of Torloisk.

The largest attempt made to locate the galleon was in 1950 when the then Duke of Argyll signed a contract with the British Admiralty to locate the galleon. Nothing came of the attempt, apart from the development of equipment still used today to locate ancient sunk vessels.
Owing to similarities in sailing conditions, in the mid-1800s emigrant sailors created the community of Tobermory in Ontario, Canada. This namesake town has twin harbours, known locally as &quot;Big Tub&quot; and &quot;Little Tub&quot;, which sheltered ships from the severe storms of Lake Huron.
During the Second World War, Tobermory was home to the Royal Navy training base HMS &quot;Western Isles&quot;, under the command of the legendary Vice admiral Sir Gilbert Stephenson, the so-called &quot;Terror of Tobermory&quot;. His biography was written by broadcaster Richard Baker, who trained under him.

== Demographics ==
As of 2003, 71% of Tobermory residents were born in Scotland, 23% in England and 6% elsewhere.

== Attractions ==
Many of the buildings on Main Street, predominantly shops and restaurants, are painted in various bright colours, making it a popular location for television programmes, such as the children&#x27;s show &quot;Balamory&quot;. The burgh hosts the Mull Museum, the Tobermory whisky distillery (and from 2005 to 2009 there was also a brewery, the Isle of Mull brewing company) as well as Mull Aquarium, the first catch and release aquarium in Europe.
The clock tower on the harbour wall is a noted landmark. The town also contains an arts centre, An Tobar, the management of which was merged with Mull Theatre in 2012 to form the umbrella arts organisation Comar. The theatre remains, based just outside Tobermory in Drumfin, and is used by youth and adult dance and drama groups, hosting a wide variety of performances. Staffa Tours popular boat tours leave from Tobermory to visit the Treshnish Isles and Fingals Cave on Staffa.

Tobermorite, a calcium silicate hydrate found near Tobermory in 1880, was named after the town.

== Notable residents ==


*Isabella Bird (1831–1904), the Victorian traveller and writer, frequently stayed in the town, where her sister Henrietta had a house. She often assisted the local doctor and, on at least one occasion, served as anaesthetist when he removed a tumour from a local woman. When Henrietta died, she funded the building of the clock tower as a memorial to her sister.
*Two generations of the MacIntyre family:
**Colin MacIntyre, a singer-songwriter
**Kenny Macintyre, sports broadcaster for BBC Scotland
**Kenny Macintyre (1944–1999), political correspondent for BBC Scotland 
*Donald McLean (1805–1864), emigrated to Canada before he was 20 and became a fur trader and explorer for the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company in the New Caledonia and Columbia Department fur districts, rising to the position of Chief Trader at Thompson&#x27;s River Post (Fort Kamloops) in the then-Colony of British Columbia. He was the last casualty of the Chilcotin War of 1864; his &quot;halfbreed&quot; sons were known as the &quot;Wild McLean Boys&quot; and were tried and hanged for murder.
*Prof George Ritchie Thomson, military surgeon, born in Tobermory in 1865.
== Annual events ==
The visit of the composer Felix Mendelssohn in 1829, en route to Staffa, is commemorated in the annual Mendelssohn on Mull Festival.
Other highlights of the town&#x27;s calendar include an annual Traditional Music Festival held on the last weekend in April, the local Mòd, which takes place on the second Saturday in September and has established itself as one of the best local Mòds on the circuit, the Mull Fiddler&#x27;s Rally, also in September, and the traditional Mull Highland Games held every summer.

== Literary associations ==
The fictional town of Torbay in Alistair MacLean&#x27;s novel &quot;When Eight Bells Toll&quot; was based on Tobermory, and much of the 1971 movie was filmed in the town and other parts of Mull. The writer Saki gave the name to a cat taught to speak English in one of his most famous short stories. and two well-loved children&#x27;s TV series have made use of the town&#x27;s name. Elisabeth Beresford called one of The Wombles &#x27;Tobermory&#x27;, and more recently the town played host to its almost-namesake &quot;Balamory&quot; for three years (2002–2005).
Other films made in the area include the 1945 Powell and Pressburger classic &quot;I Know Where I&#x27;m Going!&quot;.
In the 44 Scotland Street series by Alexander McCall Smith (1933–), volume 7 - titled &quot;Bertie Plays the Blues&quot; - has baby triplets named Tobermory, Rognvald, and Fergus.
In the children&#x27;s animated feature, Nocturna, the Cat Shepherd&#x27;s faithful cat, is called Tobermory.

== Transport ==
Ferries sail between Tobermory and the mainland to Kilchoan on the Ardnamurchan peninsula, but principal access to the island is via ferry between Oban and Craignure. Craignure is around from Tobermory. This is the main route for visitors to the island. An additional ferry sails between Lochaline on the mainland and Fishnish.

<doc id="389797" wikidata="Q1662746" url="?curid=389797" title="November 1982 Irish general election">
<text>The November 1982 Irish general election to the 24th Dáil was held on Wednesday, 24 November, three weeks after the dissolution of the 23rd Dáil on 4 November by President Patrick Hillery, on the request of Taoiseach Charles Haughey following a defeat of the government in a motion of confidence. The general election took place in 41 Dáil constituencies throughout Ireland for 166 seats in Dáil Éireann, the house of representatives of the Oireachtas.

The 24th Dáil met at Leinster House on 14 December to nominate the Taoiseach for appointment by the president and to approve the appointment of a new government of Ireland. Garret FitzGerald was appointed Taoiseach, forming the 19th government of Ireland, a coalition government of Fine Gael and the Labour Party.

==Campaign==
The second general election of 1982 took place just nine months after the election in February of the same year. It was the first time there had been three general elections within eighteen months.

The general election was caused by the loss of support of the Independent Teachta Dála (TD) Tony Gregory and the Workers&#x27; Party for the Fianna Fáil government. This was due to the government introducing substantial budget cuts, which the left-wing TDs would not support. While economic issues dominated the campaign, the parties were weary of having to fight yet another general election.

==Result==





Independents include Independent Fianna Fáil (7,997 votes, 1 seat).

===Voting summary===
===Seats summary===
==Government formation==
Fine Gael and the Labour Party formed the 19th government of Ireland, a majority coalition.

Fine Gael recorded its best election result until 2011, coming within five seats of Fianna Fáil; at other times (such as 1977) Fianna Fáil had been twice as big as Fine Gael. The Labour Party had a new leader with Dick Spring. A programme for government was quickly drawn up and Garret FitzGerald of Fine Gael became Taoiseach for the second time. The poor showing for Fianna Fáil resulted in a leadership challenge to Charles Haughey by his opponents within the party. Haughey won the vote of confidence and remained as leader.

==Dáil membership changes==
The following changes took place as a result of the election:
*5 outgoing TDs retired
*1 vacant seat at election time
*159 outgoing TDs stood for re-election (also John O&#x27;Connell, the outgoing Ceann Comhairle who was automatically returned)
**138 of those were re-elected
**21 failed to be re-elected
*27 successor TDs were elected
**18 were elected for the first time
**9 had previously been TDs
*There were 6 successor female TDs, increasing the total by 6 to 14.
*There were changes in 22 of the 41 constituencies contested

Where more than one change took place in a constituency the concept of successor is an approximation for presentation only.
==Seanad election==
The Dáil election was followed in early 1983 by an election to the 17th Seanad.

<doc id="389798" wikidata="Q771270" url="?curid=389798" title="William Edmondstoune Aytoun">
<text>William Edmondstoune &quot;W. E.&quot; Aytoun FRSE (21 June 18134 August 1865) was a Scottish poet, lawyer by training, and professor of rhetoric and belles lettres at the University of Edinburgh. He published poetry, translation, prose fiction, criticism and satire and was a lifelong contributor to the Edinburgh literary periodical &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. He was also a collector of Scottish ballads.

In the early 1850s, Professor Aytoun lent his name as a supporter of the fledgling National Association for the Vindication of Scottish Rights. His distinctive legacy as a teacher has led to him being called the &#x27;first modern professor of English Literature&#x27;.

==Early life and education==
Aytoun was born at 21 Abercromby Place in the New Town of Edinburgh, the only son of Joan Keir (1771–1861) and Roger Aytoun WS (1769–1843), Director of the Chancery of Scotland. His parents were both Episcopalians.
To his mother, a woman of culture, he owed his early fondness for literature (including ballad poetry), his political sympathies, and his admiration for the House of Stuart. He also counted poet Sir Robert Aytoun (died 1638) among his relatives.

At the age of eleven years William was sent to the Edinburgh Academy, and subsequently entered the University of Edinburgh.

==Travels and writings==
Aytoun published his first book, &quot;Poland, Homer, and other Poems&quot;, in 1832, at the age of 19. This work expressed fervent concern for the cause of Poland. In 1833, he journeyed to London where he spent a few months studying law, but decided in September of that year to travel on to Aschaffenburg where he studied German. While in Germany he made a blank verse translation of the first part of Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;; but it was never published, forestalled by other translations. He remained in Germany until April 1834.

On returning to Scotland, Aytoun resumed his legal studies in his father&#x27;s chambers. He was admitted a writer to the signet in 1835, and five years later certified a Scottish lawyer. By his own confession, though he followed the law, he never could &quot;overtake&quot; it.

Aytoun was a contributor to the Edinburgh literary periodical &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, beginning in 1836 with the magazine&#x27;s acceptance of his translations from Uhland. In 1839 he joined the staff of Blackwood&#x27;s, an association which he maintained until the end of his life. His contributions to the periodical included humorous prose stories, such as &quot;The Glenmutchkin Railway&quot;, &quot;How I Became a Yeoman&quot;, and &quot;How I Stood for the Dreepdaily Burghs&quot;, a partly autobiographical novel, &quot;Norman Sinclair&quot;, and the work upon which his reputation as a poet is chiefly based, his &quot;Lays of the Scottish Cavaliers&quot; (1848).

In around 1841, Aytoun became acquainted with Theodore Martin, and in association with him wrote a series of humorous articles on the fashions and follies of the time, in which were interspersed the verses which afterwards became popular as the &quot;Bon Gaultier Ballads&quot; (1855).

His reputation as a keen satirist is also demonstrated by his dramatic verse &quot;Firmilian, a Spasmodic Tragedy&quot;, or &quot;The Student of Badajoz&quot; (1854) under the &quot;nom-de-plume&quot; of T. Percy Jones, a mock-tragedy in which he parodied the poems of the Spasmodic poets. It was intended to satirise a group of poets and critics, including George Gilfillan, Sydney Thompson Dobell,
Philip James Bailey, and Alexander Smith. His parody played a decisive role in ending the vogue for such works.

==University appointment and political affiliations==

In 1845, Aytoun was appointed professor of rhetoric and &quot;belles lettres&quot; at the University of Edinburgh. His lectures attracted large numbers of students, raising the attendance from 30 to 150.

His services in support of the Tory party, especially during the Anti-Corn-Law struggle, received official recognition with his appointment in 1852 as Sheriff of Orkney and Shetland, a role he served for 13 years.

In 1853 Aytoun supported the National Association for the Vindication of Scottish Rights, sharing a platform as speaker with Lord Eglinton at the two defining public meetings held on behalf of the Association that year in Edinburgh and Glasgow.

==Freemasonry==
Ayntoun was initiated into Scottish Freemasonry in Lodge Canongate Kilwinning, No. 2, on 9 March 1836. He served as Master of that Lodge for 1839.

==Family life==
William Aytoun was married to Jane Emily Wilson, the daughter of Professor John Wilson (Christopher North). She died in 1859 and he then remarried, his second wife being Fearnie Jemima Kinnear, who died in 1904. He had no children by either wife.

==Death==
He died at home, 16 Great Stuart Street on the Moray Estate, on 4 August 1865.

He is buried close to Professor Wilson in the south section of Dean Cemetery in Edinburgh.

<text>Lawrence Bagnell (born December 19, 1949) is a former Canadian politician who served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for the riding of Yukon from 2000 to 2011 and again from 2015 to 2021. He served as a member of the Liberal Party of Canada.

==Early life==
Bagnell was born in Toronto, Ontario.

A graduate of the University of Toronto, Bagnell holds a Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science.

In 1999, Bagnell was recognized by the City of Whitehorse with the Volunteer of the Year Award for his long record of community service, including terms as President of the Yukon chapter of the United Way, President of Yukon Learn Society, and President of the Skookum Jim Friendship Centre.

==Political career==
Bagnell ran for a seat to the House of Commons of Canada in the 2000 Canadian federal election. He won the Yukon defeating incumbent Louise Hardy by 70 votes. He was re-elected in the 2004 federal election with close to half of the votes. Under the Paul Martin government, he served as the Parliamentary Secretary to both the Minister of Natural Resources and Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development.

He was again re-elected in the 2006 election, increasing both his number and percentage of votes. In February 2006, a local newspaper in Whitehorse, Yukon suggested that he be a candidate in the upcoming Liberal leadership race.

In February 2006, Bagnell was named the Critic for Northern Affairs in the Shadow Cabinet of Opposition leader Bill Graham, a role he continued to serve throughout his years in opposition.

On August 25, 2006, he announced that he was supporting Michael Ignatieff for the leadership of the Liberal Party of Canada.

Bagnell ran for a fourth term in the 2008 federal election. He won a tight four-way race defeating future Yukon Premier Darrell Pasloski and two other candidates.

Bagnell ran for his fifth term in the 2011 federal election but was defeated by Conservative candidate Ryan Leef, finishing second place out of four candidates in a closely contested election. Leef had campaigned on Bagnell voting in favour of the long gun registry, which was unpopular in the constituency.

Four years later, Bagnell sought a rematch with Leef, and defeated him decisively to regain his seat in the House of Commons. He was thereafter named as the chair of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs.

In March 2016, Bagnell was elected as the Vice-Chair of the Standing Committee of Parliamentarians of the Arctic Region (SCPAR), an international committee of delegates from eight Arctic states (Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, the United States) and the European Parliament.

At the 2016 &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; magazine Parliamentarians of the Year Awards, Bagnell was recognized by his peers with the award for Best Constituency MP.

In the 2019 election, Bagnell defeated conservative challenger Jonas Smith by a margin of only 153 votes, tied for the narrowest result of any electoral district in the country with Port Moody—Coquitlam (also 153 votes).

Following the 2019 election, Bagnell was appointed as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages (Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency). He also served as a member of Standing Committee on National Defence. Bagnell did not run in the 2021 federal election.

<text>The February 1982 Irish general election to the 23rd Dáil was held on Thursday, 18 February, three weeks after the dissolution of the 22nd Dáil on 27 January by President Patrick Hillery on the request of Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald on the defeat of the government&#x27;s budget. The general election took place in 41 Dáil constituencies throughout Ireland for 166 seats in Dáil Éireann, the house of representatives of the Oireachtas.

The 23rd Dáil met at Leinster House on 9 March to nominate the Taoiseach for appointment by the president and to approve the appointment of a new government of Ireland. Charles Haughey was appointed Taoiseach, forming the 18th government of Ireland, a minority single-party Fianna Fáil government.

==Background==
The first general election of 1982 was caused by the sudden collapse of the Fine Gael–Labour Party coalition government when the budget was defeated. The Minister for Finance, John Bruton, attempted to put VAT on children&#x27;s shoes. This measure was rejected by Jim Kemmy, a left-wing independent Teachta Dála, and Joe Sherlock of Sinn Féin The Workers&#x27; Party. 

===Dissolution of the Dáil===
On 27 January 1982 Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald sought an immediate dissolution of the Dáil following the collapse of his minority government. While FitzGerald met with President Patrick Hillery at Áras an Uachtaráin, several Fianna Fáil members (including party leader Charles Haughey and former Foreign Minister Brian Lenihan Snr) attempted to contact the president. Their aim was to persuade Hillery to deny the dissolution, which would have forced FitzGerald to resign and allowed the Dáil to nominate a new Taoiseach, paving the way for Haughey’s potential return to office.

The attempts to influence Hillery were unconstitutional, as the president is bound to act only on the advice of the Taoiseach in such matters and must otherwise act independently under the constitutional principle of &quot;as a chomhairle féin&quot; or &quot;under his own counsel&quot;. Hillery, angered by the interference, rejected the overtures. Allegations later emerged that Haughey had threatened Hillery’s aide-de-camp, Captain Anthony Barber, after being denied access to the president.

Ultimately, Hillery upheld his constitutional obligations and granted FitzGerald the dissolution, triggering a general election campaign. In a protective gesture, Hillery ordered a note to be placed on Barber’s service record to shield him from potential retribution. 

==Campaign==
The campaign was dominated by economic issues, with all parties downplaying the necessity of spending cuts despite the country’s severe fiscal challenges. Fianna Fáil, under Charles Haughey, initially dismissed the need for austerity, presenting policies focused on increasing disposable income for families. Their message resonated with voters, earning headlines such as &quot;FF’s family budget&quot; in the Evening Echo on February 12. However, as the campaign progressed, the need for more realistic measures became evident, and Fianna Fáil pivoted towards policies resembling those already implemented by Fine Gael during its time in office. Garret FitzGerald, leading Fine Gael, criticised Fianna Fáil’s initial proposals as &quot;myopic&quot;.

==Result==
The election results revealed a closely fought contest. Although Fianna Fáil won the largest number of seats, securing 81 out of the 84 needed for a majority, the outcome was not decisive. The Evening Echo in Cork reflected the tight result with the headline &quot;Trend to FF, but FG fight back&quot;. 




Independents include Independent Fianna Fáil (11,732 votes, 1 seat).

==Government formation==
Fianna Fáil emerged out of the election as the largest party and appeared most likely to form a government. However, internal divisions within the party threatened Charles Haughey’s bid for Taoiseach. Despite speculation about a potential leadership challenge by Desmond O&#x27;Malley, which ultimately failed to materialise, Haughey was confirmed as the party&#x27;s nominee. To secure the necessary support for his return to office, Fianna Fáil struck a deal with socialist TD Tony Gregory, Independent Fianna Fáil TD Neil Blaney, and the three Sinn Féin The Workers&#x27; Party deputies, including Joe Sherlock. With this backing, Haughey was appointed Taoiseach, allowing Fianna Fáil to form a government, the 18th Government of Ireland. 

==Dáil membership changes==
The following changes took place as a result of the election:
*7 outgoing TDs retired
*1 vacant seat at election time
*157 outgoing TDs stood for re-election (also John O&#x27;Connell, the outgoing Ceann Comhairle, who was automatically returned)
**136 of those were re-elected
**21 failed to be re-elected
*29 successor TDs were elected
**21 were elected for the first time
**8 had previously been TDs
*There was 1 successor female TD, who replaced 4 outgoing; thus the total decreased by 3 to 8.
*There were changes in 26 of 41 constituencies

Where more than one change took place in a constituency the concept of successor is an approximation for presentation only.
==Seanad election==
The Dáil election was followed by an election to the 16th Seanad.

<text>Pink gin was historically used to refer to a cocktail made fashionable in England in the mid-19th century, consisting of Plymouth gin and a dash of Angostura bitters, a dark red bitters that makes the whole drink pinkish. In recent years, the term Pink gin has also been used to define a specific category of gin where a range of fruits and flavourings are infused into the gin to give it a pink color.

Lemon rind is also commonly used as a garnish, with the citrus essential oils subtly complementing the flavour.

== Origins ==
Pink gin is widely thought to have been created by members of the Royal Navy. Plymouth gin is a &#x27;sweet&#x27; gin, as opposed to London gin which is &#x27;dry&#x27;, and was added to Angostura bitters to make the consumption of Angostura bitters more enjoyable as they were used as a treatment for sea sickness in 1824 by Dr. Johann Gottlieb Benjamin Siegert.

The Royal Navy then brought the idea for the drink to bars in England, where this method of serving was first noted on the mainland. By the 1870s, gin was becoming increasingly popular and many of the finer establishments in England were serving pink gins.

== Variations ==
A typical pink gin is one part gin and one dash of angostura bitters.

Though there are no major variations of pink gin, many bartenders vary the amount of angostura bitters used. Typically the drink is topped up with iced water, rarely without water.

A bartender may ask customers whether they want it &quot;in or out&quot;, upon which the bartender swirls the angostura bitters around the glass before either leaving it in, or pouring it out (leaving only a residue), and then adding the gin.

It is also common for pink gin to be served as &#x27;pink gin and tonic&#x27;, typically consisting of 4 dashes of angostura bitters and 2 shots of gin, which is then topped up with tonic water. This is served in a highball glass over ice, and then can be garnished with lemon.

Cedric Charles Dickens (great-grandson of Charles Dickens) records in &quot;Drinking With Dickens&quot; that a &#x27;Burnt Pink Gin&#x27; consists of 1 tsp Angostura set afire by heating over a flame and then poured into a large tot of dry gin, adding cold water to taste.

<text>Marco Antonio da Silva, known professionally as DJ Marky, is a Brazilian drum and bass DJ.

Together with DJ Patife, XRS Land and Drumagick, Brazilians were forging a new sound in drum and bass that became popular around the world with releases such as &quot;LK&quot; and &quot;Só Tinha Que Ser Com Você&quot;.

==Career==
He was brought to the attention of the English DJ Bryan Gee, head of V Recordings, who saw Marky playing in a club in São Paulo in 1998. He invited the DJ to play in London. This experience resulted in a residency at the club Movement, a subsequent residency at The End club, work for the UK&#x27;s BBC Radio 1, and global popularity.

Marky got started in drum and bass in 1992, but by 1997, he went to London and met DJ Hype and Goldie. In 1999, he was awarded &quot;Best New DJ&quot; by the UK music critics. The recording sessions of his album &quot;Working the Mix&quot; happened in his house, with two pick-ups, one mixer and vinyl albums. His appeal became more widespread after a two-hour set on BBC Radio 1&#x27;s &quot;Essential Mix&quot; in March 2004, and his album &quot;In Rotation&quot;.

In 2006, DJ Marky played the Lovebox Festival in Victoria Park, east London, as one of the headline acts.
In 2012, DJ Marky was a special guest playing at Norman Jay MBE&#x27;s &quot;Good Times Sound System&quot; at Notting Hill Carnival.

DJ Marky released the album &quot;Influences: Compiled &amp; Mixed by DJ Marky&quot; through BBE music in August 2008.

Some of Marky&#x27;s songs can be found on the video game, &quot;FIFA Street 2&quot;. DJ Marky has released music on Innerground Records (a subsidiary of Bulldozer Media).

DJ Marky was managed by Edo van Duijn and Oliver Brown until 2017.

<doc id="389811" wikidata="Q931871" url="?curid=389811" title="Franciscus Gomarus">
<text>Franciscus Gomarus (François Gomaer; 30 January 1563 – 11 January 1641) was a Dutch theologian, a strict Calvinist and an opponent of the teaching of Jacobus Arminius (and his followers), whose theological disputes were addressed at the Synod of Dort (or Dordrecht) (1618–19).

==Life==
Gomarus was born in Bruges. His parents, having embraced the principles of the Reformation, emigrated from Bruges to the Electorate of the Palatinate in 1578, in order to enjoy freedom to profess their new faith, and they sent their son to be educated at Strasbourg under Johann Sturm. He remained there three years, and then went in 1580 to Neustadt, from which the professors of Heidelberg had been driven by the elector-palatine because they were not Lutherans. Here his teachers in theology were Zacharius Ursinus (1534–83), Hieronymus Zanchius (1560–90), and Daniel Tossanus (1541–1602). Crossing to England towards the end of 1582, he attended the lectures of John Rainolds (1549–1607) at Oxford, and those of William Whitaker at Cambridge. He graduated from Cambridge in 1584, and then went to Heidelberg, where the faculty had been re-established by this time. He was pastor of a Dutch Reformed Church in Frankfurt from 1587 until 1593, when the congregation was dispersed by persecution. In 1594 he was appointed professor of theology at the University of Leiden, and before going there received the degree of doctor from the University of Heidelberg.

==Theology==
Gomarus taught quietly at Leiden until 1603, when Jacobus Arminius came to be one of his colleagues in the theological faculty, and began to teach what Gomarus viewed as essentially Pelagian doctrines and to create a new school of theology within the university. Gomarus immediately set himself earnestly to oppose these beliefs in his classes at college, and was supported by Johann B. Bogermann (1570–1637), who afterwards became professor of theology at Franeker. Arminius sought to make election dependent upon faith, whilst they sought to enforce absolute predestination as the rule of faith, according to which the whole Scriptures are to be interpreted. Gomarus then became the leader of the opponents of Arminius, who came to be known as Gomarists (Dutch: &quot;contra-remonstranten&quot;).

He engaged twice in personal disputation with Arminius in the assembly of the States of Holland in 1608, and was one of five Gomarists who met five Remonstrants (Arminians) in the same assembly of 1609. On the death of Arminius shortly after this time, Konrad Vorstius, who sympathized with Arminius&#x27;s views, was appointed to succeed him, in spite of the opposition of Gomarus and his friends. Gomarus took this defeat badly, resigned his post, and went to Middelburg in 1611, where he became preacher at the Reformed church, and taught theology and Hebrew in the newly founded Illustre Schule.

He was then called in 1614 to a chair of theology at the Academy of Saumur, where he remained four years, and then accepted a call as professor of theology and Hebrew at Groningen, where he stayed until his death in Groningen on 11 January 1641. Gomarus, despite his position as a professor of Hebrew, urged that restrictions be placed on the Jews.

==Synod of Dort==
Gomarus took a leading part in the Synod of Dort (or Dordrecht), assembled in 1618 to judge of the doctrines of Arminius. He was a man of ability, enthusiasm and learning, a considerable Oriental scholar, and also a keen controversialist. He took part in revising the Dutch translation of the Old Testament in 1633. After his death, the &quot;Lyra Davidis&quot; was published, in which he sought to explain the meter of Biblical Hebrew poetry, and which created some controversy at the time, having been opposed by Louis Cappel. His works were collected and published in a one volume folio, in Amsterdam in 1645. He was succeeded at Groningen in 1643 by his pupil Samuel Maresius (1599–1673).

<text>Johann Ludwig Uhland (26 April 1787 – 13 November 1862) was a German poet, philologist, literary historian, lawyer and politician.

==Biography==
He was born in Tübingen, Württemberg, and studied jurisprudence at the university there, but also took an interest in medieval literature, especially old German and French poetry. Having graduated as a doctor of laws in 1810, he went to Paris for eight months to continue his studies of poetry; and from 1812 to 1814 he worked as a lawyer in Stuttgart, in the bureau of the minister of justice.

===Poetry===
He began his career as a poet in 1807 and 1808 by contributing ballads and lyrics to Seckendorff&#x27;s &quot;Musenalmanach&quot;; and in 1812 and 1813 he wrote poems for Kerner&#x27;s &quot;Poetischer Almanach&quot; and &quot;Deutscher Dichterwald&quot;. In 1815 he collected his poems in a volume entitled &quot;Vaterländische Gedichte&quot;, which almost immediately secured a wide circle of readers. To almost every new edition he added some fresh poems. His two dramatic works &quot;Ernst, Herzog von Schwaben&quot; (1818) and &quot;Ludwig der Baier&quot; (1819) are unimportant in comparison with his &quot;Gedichte&quot;.

As a lyric poet, Uhland must be classed with the writers of the German romantic movement. Like them, he found the Middle Ages appealed most strongly to his imagination. Yet his style has a precision, suppleness and grace which distinguish his most characteristic writings from those of the other German romantics. Like them, Uhland wrote poems in defense of human liberty, and in the states assembly of the Kingdom of Württemberg, he played a distinguished part as one of the most vigorous and consistent of the Old Liberals among its members.

===Politics===
In 1815, Württemberg was to be granted a new constitution, replacing the old constitution of the Estates of Württemberg (&quot;Landstände&quot;) which had been abolished in 1806. Uhland became a prominent proponent of the old rights of the estates during the controversy of the following years, which ended in a compromise in 1819 under William I of Württemberg. Uhland went on to serve in the newly created parliament (&quot;Landtag&quot;) from 1819 until 1826.

In 1829 he was made honorary professor of German literature at the University of Tübingen, but he resigned in 1833, when the post was found to be incompatible with his political views. In 1848 he became a member of the Frankfurt Parliament that convened in the course of the 1848 revolution.

===Philology and literary history===
As a Germanic and Romance philologist, Uhland must be counted among the founders of that science. Besides the treatise &quot;Ueber das altfranzösische Epos&quot; (1812) and an essay &quot;Zur Geschichte der Freischiessen&quot; (1828), there are to be especially mentioned &quot;Walther von der Vogelweide, ein altdeutscher Dichter&quot; (1822); &quot;Der Mythus von Thôr&quot; (1836), the result of the most painstaking original investigation; and the masterly collection &quot;Alte hoch- und niederdeutsche Volkslieder&quot; (1844–45; 3d ed. 1892). His poetical works were repeatedly published as &quot;Gedichte und Dramen&quot;, while his scientific work is embodied in &quot;Schriften zur Geschichte der Dichtung und Sage&quot;, edited by Holland, Keller, and Pfeiffer (1865–72).

He died on 13 November 1862 in Tübingen.

==Translations==
Longfellow translated some of his pieces into English. Alexander Platt translated his &quot;Poems&quot; (Leipzig, 1848), W. W. Skeat his &quot;Songs and Ballads&quot; (London, 1864), and W. C. Sandars his &quot;Poems&quot; (1869).

==Legacy==
* One of his best-known poems is &quot;Ich hatt&#x27; einen Kameraden&quot;, which is an integral part of military funerals. 
* A town located south of Austin, Texas, is named in his honor.
* German composer Wilhelmine Schwertzell (1787-1863) used Uland&#x27;s text in her songs &quot;Abschied&quot; and &quot;Einkehr&quot;.
* Lieder composer Pauline Volkstein 1849-1925) also set Uhland&#x27;s text to music.

<doc id="389814" wikidata="Q1327915" url="?curid=389814" title="1981 Irish general election">
<text>The 1981 Irish general election to the 22nd Dáil was held on Thursday, 11 June, following the dissolution of the 21st Dáil on 21 May by President Patrick Hillery on the request of Taoiseach Charles Haughey. The general election took place in 41 Dáil constituencies throughout Ireland for 166 seats in Dáil Éireann, the house of representatives of the Oireachtas. The number of seats in the Dáil was increased by 18 from 148 under the Electoral (Amendment) Act 1980.

The 22nd Dáil met at Leinster House on 30 June to nominate the Taoiseach for appointment by the president and to approve the appointment of a new government of Ireland. Garret FitzGerald was appointed Taoiseach, forming the 17th government of Ireland, a minority coalition government of Fine Gael and the Labour Party.

== Campaign ==
The general election of 1981 was the first one of five during the 1980s. The election also saw three new leaders of the three main parties fight their first general election. Charles Haughey had become Taoiseach and leader of Fianna Fáil at the end of 1979, Garret FitzGerald was the new leader of Fine Gael and Frank Cluskey was leading the Labour Party.

Haughey and Fianna Fáil seemed extremely popular with the electorate in early 1981. He was expected to call the election at the time of the Fianna Fáil ardfheis on 14 February, but the Stardust fire caused the ardfheis to be postponed, and the Republican hunger strike in the Maze Prison began in March. By the dissolution in May, much of the earlier optimism in the party had filtered out. The Anti H-Block movement fielded abstentionist candidates in solidarity with the hunger strikers, undermining the Republican credentials of Fianna Fáil.

Fianna Fáil&#x27;s manifesto promised more spending programmes and Fine Gael put forward a series of tax-cutting plans.

== Result ==




Independents include Anti H-Block (42,803 votes, 2 seats) and Independent Fianna Fáil (13,546 votes, 1 seat).

=== Voting summary ===
=== Seats summary ===
== Government formation ==
Fianna Fáil lost seats as a result of sympathy to the Anti H-Block candidates and the attractive tax proposals of Fine Gael. It was the worst performance for Fianna Fáil in twenty years. Meanwhile, Labour Party leader Frank Cluskey lost his seat, necessitating a leadership change with Michael O&#x27;Leary succeeding Cluskey. A Fine Gael–Labour Party coalition government came to power. Fine Gael and the Labour Party formed the 17th Government of Ireland, a minority coalition government, with Garret FitzGerald becoming Taoiseach.

== Dáil membership changes ==
The following changes took place at this election:
*20 outgoing TDs retired
*18 additional seats added to the Dáil
*127 outgoing TDs stood for re-election (also Pádraig Faulkner, the outgoing Ceann Comhairle who was automatically returned)
**109 of those were re-elected
**18 failed to be re-elected
*56 successor TDs were elected
**50 were elected for the first time
**6 had previously been TDs
*There were 7 successor female TDs, replacing 3 outgoing, increasing the total by 4 to 11.

Where more than one change took place in a constituency the concept of successor is an approximation for presentation only.
Where a number of related constituency changes took place in an area, such as Cork, the outgoing constituency for retiring TDs and the allocation of new seats are approximations for presentation only.
Outgoing TDs re-elected in a new constituency, with no related changes, are not recorded as a change

==Seanad election==
The Dáil election was followed by an election to the 15th Seanad.

<text>Andrew J. G. Kershaw (born 9 November 1959) is an English broadcaster and disc jockey, predominantly on radio, and known for his interest in world music.

Kershaw&#x27;s shows feature a mix of country, blues, reggae, folk music, African music, spoken word performances and a wide variety of other music from around the world.

==Early life and education==
Kershaw was born in Littleborough, Lancashire, on 9 November 1959. His older sister is broadcaster Liz Kershaw. A headmaster and headmistress, Kershaw&#x27;s parents instilled in him the ethics of education and self-improvement at an early age. 

As a party trick aged two, he would name the whiskered military men in his father&#x27;s history books of the Great War, but he never felt the love or pride from his parents that he got from his grandparents, who provided a home from home.

He was educated at Hulme Grammar School in Oldham where he took A-Levels in History, Economics and Spanish. He left the Economics examination halfway into the allotted time in order to attend a Bob Dylan concert but still achieved a Grade A pass in the subject. He then studied politics at the University of Leeds from which he failed to graduate, his decision to apply for a place there being solely with an eye on the position of Entertainments Secretary for Leeds University Union.

Kershaw was elected Entertainments Secretary in 1980, midway through his second year. A full-time commitment to a non-sabbatical office, he booked bands including Ian Dury, Dire Straits, the Clash, Elvis Costello, Iggy Pop and Duran Duran - the latter were paid £50 from Kershaw&#x27;s own pocket to support Hazel O&#x27;Connor. 

==Life and career==
Kershaw&#x27;s first engagement after the University of Leeds was to oversee backstage operations of the Rolling Stones&#x27; epic 1982 Roundhay Park concert in Leeds.
===Music broadcasting===

Kershaw began work for Radio Aire as Promotions Manager, a position he used - with station presenter Martin Kelner - to ruthlessly promote the UK&#x27;s third-largest town without city status, Northampton. Unintentionally, at Radio Aire, he helped to launch the media career of Carol Vorderman, and made his broadcasting debut, fronting a late night alternative show and a weekly blues programme. After being made redundant from Radio Aire in 1983, Kershaw was employed as a driver and roadie by the singer Billy Bragg.

His big break came in 1984, when he was asked to present BBC TV&#x27;s flagship rock programme, &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot;, by its producer Trevor Dann, whom Kershaw had met when filming with Bragg the previous week. He subsequently recorded a television interview with his hero Bob Dylan, and a loud session from the Ramones. He co-presented BBC television coverage of Live Aid in 1985. In July 1985, Kershaw began life as a BBC Radio 1 DJ, ear-marked by the station as a possible successor to John Peel. 
Room 318 of Egton House was to house Kershaw, Peel and their mentor, producer John Walters, whose Reithian motto was, &quot;We&#x27;re not here to give the public what it wants. We&#x27;re here to give the public what it didn&#x27;t know it wanted.&quot; His weekly Radio 1 shows were characterised by their high levels of enthusiasm and musical eclecticism. 

Kershaw&#x27;s &quot;boredom&quot; with Anglo-American rock led him to seek out sounds from further afield, especially Africa. Fellow DJ Charlie Gillett introduced him to Stern&#x27;s African Records shop in London, and Lucy Durán exposed him to musicians like Youssou N&#x27;Dour and Toumani Diabaté, playing impromptu sessions in her London front room. Peel and Kershaw discovered Zimbabwe&#x27;s Bhundu Boys simultaneously; the band began to feature heavily on their playlists. The Bhundus&#x27; singer Biggie Tembo became Kershaw&#x27;s great friend. 

This first year of broadcasting won Kershaw his first gold Sony Award in 1987. Kershaw was the first to play Ali Farka Touré on mainstream national radio, and the documentary they made together in Mali was the first ever to be broadcast simultaneously on Radios 1 and 4.

Kershaw&#x27;s contract with Radio 1 ended in 2000. His last months on the network featured sessions by Willie Nelson, Warren Zevon and Lou Reed. He then worked at BBC Radio 3 the following year, where he soon completed a musical tour of the so-called Axis of Evil: Iraq, North Korea and Iran.

From July 2007 Kershaw was absent from his BBC Radio 3 show for an extended period, returning in 2011 with &quot;Music Planet&quot;, co-hosted with Lucy Durán.

In September 2020 Kershaw returned on air on BBC Radio 3 presenting a two episode sunday feature, The Kershaw Tapes.

===Broadcast journalism===
Kershaw has worked as a journalist for BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;From Our Own Correspondent&quot;, the &quot;Today&quot; programme and &quot;The World Tonight&quot;. He reported from the 1994 Rwanda&#x27;s genocide, Angola&#x27;s civil war in 1996, Sierra Leone in 2001 and repeatedly from Haiti. Kershaw covered the 2010 Red Shirt Revolution in Bangkok for &quot;The Independent&quot;.

In his 1998 documentary for Radio 1, &quot;Ghosts of Electricity&quot;, Kershaw tracked down and unmasked, 32 years after the event, the heckler who shouted &quot;Judas!&quot; at Bob Dylan in 1966. In June 2005 Kershaw criticised Bob Geldof over the choice of artists due to play at &quot;Live 8&quot;, which included few black performers and even fewer Africans. Kershaw has put together two compilations, &quot;Great Moments of Vinyl History&quot; (1988) and &quot;More Great Moments of Vinyl History&quot; (2004), which document his wide musical taste.

===Writing===
Kershaw&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;No Off Switch&quot;, was published in July 2011 by Serpent&#x27;s Tail (later republished by Buster Press) and was praised by Stephen Fry among others. It received a negative review from Rachel Cooke in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, who says &quot;He is always right, and those who disagree are always stupid&quot;.

==Personal life==
Kershaw had a 17-year relationship with Juliette Banner, with whom he has two children. They moved to the Isle of Man, where the relationship broke down; he repeatedly harassed her. In October 2007 he was convicted of breaching a restraining order which required him not to contact her, and of driving under the influence, and in January 2008, he was sentenced to three months&#x27; imprisonment for repeatedly violating this order. He was arrested a few days after his release, and at the end of that year he was given a six-month suspended sentence.

A much-advertised BBC Radio 4 interview with him, &quot;On the Ropes&quot;, was cancelled the day before transmission in April 2009 &quot;over fears it would impinge on the privacy of his former girlfriend and their children&quot;. In August 2010 he was due to return to working at the BBC.

==Recognition==
In July 2003, Kershaw was awarded an honorary doctorate of music by the University of East Anglia, and in 2005 he was similarly honoured by his old university, the University of Leeds.

In March 2007, Kershaw appeared on &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;.

<text>Roy Hardeman Bailey (December 16, 1928 – December 13, 2018) was a Canadian politician.

Formerly a member of the Social Credit Party of Saskatchewan, Bailey joined the Progressive Conservative Party of Saskatchewan when the Social Credit and PC parties merged under the PC name in 1971.

Bailey ran for the leadership of the Saskatchewan PC Party in 1973, placing second to Dick Collver.

He was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan in the 1975 provincial election as the Progressive Conservative Member of the Legislative Assembly for Rosetown-Elrose, and served until 1978.

Bailey was a school board trustee in the Borderland School Division (since consolidated into the Prairie South School Division) from 1984 to 1993.

He was elected to the House of Commons in 1997, representing the riding of Souris—Moose Mountain for the Reform Party of Canada and its successor, the Canadian Alliance, until 2004. He served as the Veterans Affairs critic for the Alliance. He did not seek re-election in the 2004 election.

Bailey was also variously an educational administrator, a farmer, and a teacher. He died on December 13, 2018.

<doc id="389821" wikidata="Q931428" url="?curid=389821" title="1977 Irish general election">
<text>The 1977 Irish general election to the 21st Dáil was held on Thursday, 16 June, following the dissolution of the 20th Dáil on 25 May by President Patrick Hillery on the request of Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave. The general election took place in 42 Dáil constituencies throughout Ireland for 148 seats in Dáil Éireann, the house of representatives of the Oireachtas, an increase of four seats. There was a significant revision of constituencies under the Electoral (Amendment) Act 1974. Jack Lynch led Fianna Fáil to a landslide election win, clearly defeating the outgoing Fine Gael–Labour government.

The 21st Dáil met at Leinster House on 5 July to nominate the Taoiseach for appointment by the president and to approve the appointment of a new government of Ireland. Jack Lynch was appointed Taoiseach, forming the 15th government of Ireland, a single-party majority Fianna Fáil government. It was the last election to result in a single-party majority government.

==Campaign==
In the lead-up to the 1977 general election, the Fine Gael–Labour coalition government was determined to defy political history by securing a second term. Despite facing a range of challenges, including dissatisfaction over economic conditions and rising inflation, the government hoped that the redrawing of constituency boundaries through the Electoral (Amendment) Act 1974 (famously known as the “Tullymander”) would give them an advantage. The scheme, spearheaded by Minister for Local Government James Tully, was designed to maximise the coalition’s chances by gerrymandering constituencies, particularly in Dublin where new three-seat constituencies were introduced. The aim was for Fine Gael and Labour to win two of the three seats in these areas, limiting Fianna Fáil to just one. This strategy was also applied in rural areas, where Fine Gael was traditionally stronger than Labour, and was expected to consolidate the coalition’s position in power.

As the election campaign progressed, however, it became clear that Fianna Fáil, under the leadership of Jack Lynch, was gaining ground. Though the party was initially not expected to win, Fianna Fáil’s campaign took a bold turn with an ambitious manifesto, which promised significant financial and economic “sweeteners” to the electorate. These included the abolition of motor tax and rates on houses, as well as a pledge to reduce unemployment to under 100,000. While these promises would later be criticised for their cost, they resonated strongly with voters in 1977, especially during a time of economic hardship. Before and during the campaign, Both &quot;The Irish Times&quot; and &quot;The Irish Press&quot;, which were then edited by Tim Pat Coogan, were extremely critical of the FG–Labour government&#x27;s curtailment of freedom of speech and in particular of Conor Cruise O&#x27;Brien, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, who used these restrictions against the Provisional IRA.

The Fianna Fáil campaign was heavily focused on Jack Lynch&#x27;s personal popularity. His leadership, calm manner, and widespread appeal across the country were central to the campaign’s success. The party’s director of elections, Séamus Brennan, ran an American-style operation, with Lynch touring the country to rally support. His slogan, “Bring Back Jack,” capitalised on his image as a dependable and unifying figure, drawing huge crowds. The campaign was marked by music, rallies, and a strong sense of momentum as Fianna Fáil sought to capitalise on public discontent with the coalition government.

==Result==
By election day, June 16, 1977, the mood had shifted significantly. Early reports indicated that Fianna Fáil was on track to win, though the full scale of the victory was not immediately apparent. The coalition was left struggling, and the final result saw Fianna Fáil securing 84 seats in the Dáil, a gain of 15 seats and an unprecedented nine-seat majority. This victory marked the most significant electoral win in Irish history up to that point, surpassing even the achievements of Éamon de Valera in his prime. The Fine Gael and Labour parties, in contrast, suffered heavy losses, with Fine Gael losing 12 seats and Labour losing three. The defeat led to the resignation of both Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave and Tánaiste Brendan Corish as leaders of their respective parties, marking a major shift in Ireland&#x27;s political landscape.

Fianna Fáil’s overwhelming victory was largely attributed to Lynch’s personal popularity, the appeal of the party’s economic promises, and the effective mobilisation of the electorate. The “Tullymander,” designed to secure an advantage for the coalition, ultimately had the opposite effect, contributing to the scale of their defeat. This election would also be the last time any Taoiseach led a single-party government with an overall majority in the Dáil, as Fianna Fáil’s success effectively ended the National Coalition’s tenure in power.




Independents include Independent Fianna Fáil (13,824 votes, 1 seat) and the Community group in Dublin (9,427 votes).

<text>Jan Kubelík (5 July 18805 December 1940) was a Czech violinist and composer.

==Biography==
He was born in Michle (now part of Prague). His father, a gardener by occupation, was an amateur violinist. He taught his two sons the violin and after discovering the talent of Jan, who was aged five at the time, arranged for him to study with Karel Weber and Karel Ondříček. Aged eight he studied at the Prague Conservatory with Otakar Ševčík, of whose technique he became the most famous representative. As a child, he used to practice 10 to 12 hours a day, or &quot;until my fingers started to bleed.&quot; After 1898, he toured as a soloist, soon becoming renowned for his great virtuosity and flawless intonation, and his very full and noble tone. He played a Guarneri del Gesù and also two Stradivarius violins: he acquired the 1715 Stradivarius Emperor in 1910.

After great success following his debut in Vienna, and in London (where he first appeared at a Hans Richter concert in 1900), Kubelík toured in the USA in 1901 for the first time. He made his first appearance for the Royal Philharmonic Society, London in the season of 1901–2, and in 1902 was awarded the Society&#x27;s Gold Medal (in succession to Eugène Ysaÿe). In 1902 he brought the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra to London, having assisted it financially in the previous year.

In 1903, he married Countess Anna Julie Marie Széll von Bessenyö (born 1 March 1880 in Budapest), niece of former Prime Minister of Hungary Kálmán Széll, with whom he had eight children, five violinist daughters and three sons, among them conductor Rafael Kubelík.

Kubelík made a number of recordings; his acoustic recordings were made for The Gramophone and Typewriter Company Ltd., the Victor Talking Machine Company, Fonotipia/Odeon and Schallplatte Grammophon/Polydor (who also recorded Váša Příhoda, Franz von Vecsey and Jacques Thibaud). The Gramophone Company recorded him as accompanist to Dame Nellie Melba in 1904, a match which reflected the classical phrasing, tonal purity and security of his art and was an ideal complement to it. Their early version of the Bach-Gounod &quot;Ave Maria&quot; (G.C. 03033) was recorded twice, in October 1904 and again in February 1905, and this was one of the great early classics of the gramophone, one of those records which &#x27;made&#x27; the instrument a popular success, though the double celebrity single-sided title retailed at one guinea. Nine years later (when technology had improved) the partnership was reformed to re-make the record (as 03333), in May 1913 with organ accompaniment and again in October 1913. It was the latter version which then survived in the inter-war catalogue in two-sided form. His 1935 Carnegie Hall concert was also recorded and has been reissued.

He wrote music, including six violin concertos, and continued to perform in public until his death, with a pause between the end of World War I and 1920, during which period he composed. In 1920 he resumed his concert career. In 1917, he was elected as an honorary member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia music fraternity by the fraternity&#x27;s Alpha chapter at the New England Conservatory in Boston.

Jan Kubelík died in Prague in 1940, aged 60.

== Critical reception and legacy ==
In 1907, reviewing a concert by Kubelik at New York&#x27;s massive Hippodrome Theatre, the &quot;New York Times&quot; wrote
In 1903 Kubelik&#x27;s portrait was painted by Philip de László, and a 1912 Cubist painting by Georges Braque incorporates a handbill featuring the words &quot;Mozart Kubelick&quot; (sic). Carl Sandburg mentions Jan Kubelík in his &quot;Chicago Poems&quot;, 1916. He is adored by the sisters in Sally Benson&#x27;s collected short stories which later became the film &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot; (1944). He is also referred to in Robert Ludlum&#x27;s 2002 novel &quot;The Janson Directive&quot;.

<text>Cupar ( ) is a town northeast of Regina in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. Cupar is settled on the flat plains north of the scenic Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley. Known for its remarkable hockey history, it is often called the &quot;Home of Eddie Shore&quot;, as the legendary NHL defenceman was raised there.

Cupar is the home of artist Jacqueline Berting. The Berting Glass studio is located north of town. One of her best known works is &quot;The Glass Wheatfield&quot;, encompassing 1,400 waist-high glass wheat stalks, each piece individually hand cut and lamp worked. Berting calls her work &quot;a salute to the Canadian farmer&quot;.

The town hosts the Cupar Gopher Drop, a unique lottery held every summer. Stuffed toy gophers (Richardson&#x27;s ground squirrels) labelled with numbers are dropped from a hot-air balloon along with numbered gopher holes. The &quot;owner&quot; of the gopher that lands nearest Hole 1 wins first prize, and so on.

==History==
Cupar became a village in 1905. It was named by a Canadian Pacific Railway official after the town of Cupar in Fife, Scotland. The town celebrated its centennial in 2005.

==Sports==
Cupar has a swimming pool, ice rink, curling, rink, ball diamonds, and golf. The Cupar Canucks of the senior men&#x27;s Highway Hockey League play here.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Cupar had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

<doc id="389836" wikidata="Q284602" url="?curid=389836" title="G-force">
<text>The g-force or gravitational force equivalent is a mass-specific force (force per unit mass), expressed in units of standard gravity (symbol &quot;g&quot; or &quot;g&quot;0, not to be confused with &quot;g&quot;, the symbol for grams).
It is used for sustained accelerations that cause a perception of weight. For example, an object at rest on Earth&#x27;s surface is subject to 1 &quot;g&quot;, equaling the conventional value of gravitational acceleration on Earth, about .
More transient acceleration, accompanied with significant jerk, is called &quot;shock&quot;.

When the g-force is produced by the surface of one object being pushed by the surface of another object, the reaction force to this push produces an equal and opposite force for every unit of each object&#x27;s mass. The types of forces involved are transmitted through objects by interior mechanical stresses. Gravitational acceleration is one cause of an object&#x27;s acceleration in relation to free fall.

The g-force experienced by an object is due to the vector sum of all gravitational and non-gravitational forces acting on an object&#x27;s freedom to move. In practice, as noted, these are surface-contact forces between objects. Such forces cause stresses and strains on objects, since they must be transmitted from an object surface. Because of these strains, large g-forces may be destructive.

For example, a force of 1 &quot;g&quot; on an object sitting on the Earth&#x27;s surface is caused by the mechanical force exerted in the upward direction by the ground, keeping the object from going into free fall. The upward contact force from the ground ensures that an object at rest on the Earth&#x27;s surface is accelerating relative to the free-fall condition. (Free fall is the path that the object would follow when falling freely toward the Earth&#x27;s center). Stress inside the object is ensured from the fact that the ground contact forces are transmitted only from the point of contact with the ground.

Objects allowed to free-fall in an &quot;inertial trajectory&quot;, under the influence of gravitation only, feel no g-force – a condition known as weightlessness. Being in free fall in an inertial trajectory is colloquially called &quot;zero-&quot;g&quot;&quot;, which is short for &quot;zero g-force&quot;. Zero g-force conditions would occur inside an elevator falling freely toward the Earth&#x27;s center (in vacuum), or (to good approximation) inside a spacecraft in Earth orbit. These are examples of coordinate acceleration (a change in velocity) without a sensation of weight.

In the absence of gravitational fields, or in directions at right angles to them, proper and coordinate accelerations are the same, and any coordinate acceleration must be produced by a corresponding g-force acceleration. An example of this is a rocket in free space: when the engines produce simple changes in velocity, those changes cause g-forces on the rocket and the passengers.

==Unit and measurement==

The unit of measure of acceleration in the International System of Units (SI) is m/s2. However, to distinguish acceleration relative to free fall from simple acceleration (rate of change of velocity), the unit g is often used. One &quot;g&quot; is the force per unit mass due to gravity at the Earth&#x27;s surface and is the standard gravity (symbol: &quot;g&quot;n), defined as  metres per second squared, or equivalently  newtons of force per kilogram of mass. The &quot;unit definition&quot; does not vary with location—the g-force when standing on the Moon is almost exactly that on Earth.
The unit &quot;g&quot; is not one of the SI units, which uses &quot;g&quot; for gram. Also, &quot;&quot;g&quot; should not be confused with &quot;G&quot;&quot;, which is the standard symbol for the gravitational constant. This notation is commonly used in aviation, especially in aerobatic or combat military aviation, to describe the increased forces that must be overcome by pilots in order to remain conscious and not g-LOC (&quot;g&quot;-induced loss of consciousness).

Measurement of g-force is typically achieved using an accelerometer (see discussion below in section #Measurement using an accelerometer). In certain cases, g-forces may be measured using suitably calibrated scales.

==Acceleration and forces==

The term g-&quot;force&quot; is technically incorrect as it is a measure of &quot;acceleration&quot;, not force. While acceleration is a vector quantity, g-force accelerations (&quot;g-forces&quot; for short) are often expressed as a scalar, based on the vector magnitude, with positive g-forces pointing downward (indicating upward acceleration), and negative g-forces pointing upward. Thus, a g-force is a vector of acceleration. It is an acceleration that must be produced by a mechanical force, and cannot be produced by simple gravitation. Objects acted upon &quot;only&quot; by gravitation experience (or &quot;feel&quot;) no g-force, and are weightless.
g-forces, when multiplied by a mass upon which they act, are associated with a certain type of mechanical &quot;force&quot; in the correct sense of the term &quot;force&quot;, and this force produces compressive stress and tensile stress. Such forces result in the operational sensation of weight, but the equation carries a sign change due to the definition of positive weight in the direction downward, so the direction of weight-force is opposite to the direction of g-force acceleration:

:Weight = mass × −g-force

The reason for the minus sign is that the actual &quot;force&quot; (i.e., measured weight) on an object produced by a g-force is in the opposite direction to the sign of the g-force, since in physics, weight is not the force that produces the acceleration, but rather the equal-and-opposite reaction force to it. If the direction upward is taken as positive (the normal cartesian convention) then &quot;positive&quot; g-force (an acceleration vector that points upward) produces a force/weight on any mass, that acts &quot;downward&quot; (an example is positive-g acceleration of a rocket launch, producing downward weight). In the same way, a &quot;negative-g force&quot; is an acceleration vector &quot;downward&quot; (the negative direction on the y axis), and this acceleration downward produces a weight-force in a direction &quot;upward&quot; (thus pulling a pilot upward out of the seat, and forcing blood toward the head of a normally oriented pilot).

If a g-force (acceleration) is vertically upward and is applied by the ground (which is accelerating through space-time) or applied by the floor of an elevator to a standing person, most of the body experiences compressive stress which at any height, if multiplied by the area, is the related mechanical force, which is the product of the g-force and the supported mass (the mass above the level of support, including arms hanging down from above that level). At the same time, the arms themselves experience a tensile stress, which at any height, if multiplied by the area, is again the related mechanical force, which is the product of the g-force and the mass hanging below the point of mechanical support. The mechanical resistive force spreads from points of contact with the floor or supporting structure, and gradually decreases toward zero at the unsupported ends (the top in the case of support from below, such as a seat or the floor, the bottom for a hanging part of the body or object). With compressive force counted as negative tensile force, the rate of change of the tensile force in the direction of the g-force, per unit mass (the change between parts of the object such that the slice of the object between them has unit mass), is equal to the g-force plus the non-gravitational external forces on the slice, if any (counted positive in the direction opposite to the g-force).

For a given g-force the stresses are the same, regardless of whether this g-force is caused by mechanical resistance to gravity, or by a coordinate-acceleration (change in velocity) caused by a mechanical force, or by a combination of these. Hence, for people all mechanical forces feels exactly the same whether they cause coordinate acceleration or not. For objects likewise, the question of whether they can withstand the mechanical g-force without damage is the same for any type of g-force. For example, upward acceleration (e.g., increase of speed when going up or decrease of speed when going down) on Earth feels the same as being stationary on a celestial body with a higher surface gravity. Gravitation acting alone does not produce any g-force; g-force is only produced from mechanical pushes and pulls. For a free body (one that is free to move in space) such g-forces only arise as the &quot;inertial&quot; path that is the natural effect of gravitation, or the natural effect of the inertia of mass, is modified. Such modification may only arise from influences other than gravitation.

Examples of important situations involving g-forces include:
* The g-force acting on a stationary object resting on the Earth&#x27;s surface is 1 &quot;g&quot; (upwards) and results from the resisting reaction of the Earth&#x27;s surface bearing upwards equal to an acceleration of 1 &quot;g&quot;, and is equal and opposite to gravity. The number 1 is approximate, depending on location.
* The g-force acting on an object in any weightless environment such as free-fall in a vacuum is 0 &quot;g&quot;.
* The g-force acting on an object under acceleration can be much greater than 1 &quot;g&quot;, for example, the dragster pictured at top right can exert a horizontal g-force of 5.3 when accelerating.
* The g-force acting on an object under acceleration may be downwards, for example when cresting a sharp hill on a roller coaster.
* If there are no other external forces than gravity, the g-force in a rocket is the thrust per unit mass. Its magnitude is equal to the thrust-to-weight ratio times &quot;g&quot;, and to the consumption of delta-v per unit time.
* In the case of a shock, e.g., a collision, the g-force can be very large during a short time.

A classic example of negative g-force is in a fully inverted roller coaster which is accelerating (changing velocity) toward the ground. In this case, the roller coaster riders are accelerated toward the ground faster than gravity would accelerate them, and are thus pinned upside down in their seats. In this case, the mechanical force exerted by the seat causes the g-force by altering the path of the passenger downward in a way that differs from gravitational acceleration. The difference in downward motion, now faster than gravity would provide, is caused by the push of the seat, and it results in a g-force toward the ground.

All &quot;coordinate accelerations&quot; (or lack of them), are described by Newton&#x27;s laws of motion as follows:

The &quot;Second Law of Motion&quot;, the law of acceleration, states that meaning that a force &quot;F&quot; acting on a body is equal to the mass &quot;m&quot; of the body times its acceleration &quot;a&quot;.

The &quot;Third Law of Motion&quot;, the law of reciprocal actions, states that all forces occur in pairs, and these two forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Newton&#x27;s third law of motion means that not only does gravity behave as a force acting downwards on, say, a rock held in your hand but also that the rock exerts a force on the Earth, equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.
In an airplane, the pilot&#x27;s seat can be thought of as the hand holding the rock, the pilot as the rock. When flying straight and level at 1 &quot;g&quot;, the pilot is acted upon by the force of gravity. His weight (a downward force) is . In accordance with Newton&#x27;s third law, the plane and the seat underneath the pilot provides an equal and opposite force pushing upwards with a force of 725 N. This mechanical force provides the 1.0 &quot;g&quot; upward proper acceleration on the pilot, even though this velocity in the upward direction does not change (this is similar to the situation of a person standing on the ground, where the ground provides this force and this g-force).

If the pilot were suddenly to pull back on the stick and make his plane accelerate upwards at 9.8 m/s2, the total g‑force on his body is 2 &quot;g&quot;, half of which comes from the seat pushing the pilot to resist gravity, and half from the seat pushing the pilot to cause his upward acceleration—a change in velocity which also is a &quot;proper acceleration&quot; because it also differs from a free fall trajectory. Considered in the frame of reference of the plane his body is now generating a force of downwards into his seat and the seat is simultaneously pushing upwards with an equal force of 1450 N.

Unopposed acceleration due to mechanical forces, and consequentially g-force, is experienced whenever anyone rides in a vehicle because it always causes a proper acceleration, and (in the absence of gravity) also always a coordinate acceleration (where velocity changes). Whenever the vehicle changes either direction or speed, the occupants feel lateral (side to side) or longitudinal (forward and backwards) forces produced by the mechanical push of their seats.

The expression means that &quot;for every second that elapses,&quot; velocity changes metres per second (). This rate of change in velocity can also be denoted as (metres per second) per second, or For example: An acceleration of 1 &quot;g&quot; equates to a rate of change in velocity of approximately for each second that elapses. Therefore, if an automobile is capable of braking at 1 &quot;g&quot; and is traveling at 35 km/h, it can brake to a standstill in one second and the driver will experience a deceleration of 1 &quot;g&quot;. The automobile traveling at three times this speed, , can brake to a standstill in three seconds.

In the case of an increase in speed from 0 to &quot;v&quot; with constant acceleration within a distance of &quot;s&quot; this acceleration is &quot;v&quot;2/(2&quot;s&quot;).

Preparing an object for g-tolerance (not getting damaged when subjected to a high g-force) is called g-hardening. This may apply to, e.g., instruments in a projectile shot by a gun.

==Human tolerance==

Human tolerances depend on the magnitude of the gravitational force, the length of time it is applied, the direction it acts, the location of application, and the posture of the body.

The human body is flexible and deformable, particularly the softer tissues. A hard slap on the face may briefly impose hundreds of &quot;g&quot; locally but not produce any real damage; a constant 16 &quot;g&quot; for a minute, however, may be deadly. When vibration is experienced, relatively low peak g-force levels can be severely damaging if they are at the resonant frequency of organs or connective tissues.

To some degree, g-tolerance can be trainable, and there is also considerable variation in innate ability between individuals. In addition, some illnesses, particularly cardiovascular problems, reduce g-tolerance.

===Vertical===
Aircraft pilots (in particular) sustain g-forces along the axis aligned with the spine. This causes significant variation in blood pressure along the length of the subject&#x27;s body, which limits the maximum g-forces that can be tolerated.

Positive, or &quot;upward&quot; g-force, drives blood downward to the feet of a seated or standing person (more naturally, the feet and body may be seen as being driven by the upward force of the floor and seat, upward around the blood). Resistance to positive g-force varies. A typical person can handle about (meaning some people might pass out when riding a higher-g roller coaster, which in some cases exceeds this point) before losing consciousness, but through the combination of special g-suits and efforts to strain muscles—both of which act to force blood back into the brain—modern pilots can typically handle a sustained (see High-G training).

In aircraft particularly, vertical g-forces are often positive (force blood towards the feet and away from the head); this causes problems with the eyes and brain in particular. As positive vertical g-force is progressively increased (such as in a centrifuge) the following symptoms may be experienced:
* Grey-out, where the vision loses hue, easily reversible on levelling out
* Tunnel vision, where peripheral vision is progressively lost
* Blackout, a loss of vision while consciousness is maintained, caused by a lack of blood flow to the head
* G-LOC, a g-force induced loss of consciousness
* Death, if g-forces are not quickly reduced

Resistance to &quot;negative&quot; or &quot;downward&quot; g, which drives blood to the head, is much lower. This limit is typically in the range. This condition is sometimes referred to as red out where vision is literally reddened due to the blood-laden lower eyelid being pulled into the field of vision. Negative g-force is generally unpleasant and can cause damage. Blood vessels in the eyes or brain may swell or burst under the increased blood pressure, resulting in degraded sight or even blindness.

===Horizontal===
The human body is better at surviving g-forces that are perpendicular to the spine. In general when the acceleration is forwards (subject essentially lying on their back, colloquially known as &quot;eyeballs in&quot;), a much higher tolerance is shown than when the acceleration is backwards (lying on their front, &quot;eyeballs out&quot;) since blood vessels in the retina appear more sensitive in the latter direction.

Early experiments showed that untrained humans were able to tolerate a range of accelerations depending on the time of exposure. This ranged from as much as for less than 10 seconds, to for 1 minute, and for 10 minutes for both eyeballs in and out. These forces were endured with cognitive facilities intact, as subjects were able to perform simple physical and communication tasks. The tests were determined not to cause long- or short-term harm although tolerance was quite subjective, with only the most motivated non-pilots capable of completing tests. The record for peak experimental horizontal g-force tolerance is held by acceleration pioneer John Stapp, in a series of rocket sled deceleration experiments culminating in a late 1954 test in which he was clocked in a little over a second from a land speed of Mach 0.9. He survived a peak &quot;eyeballs-out&quot; acceleration of 46.2 times the acceleration of gravity, and more than for 1.1 seconds, proving that the human body is capable of this. Stapp lived another 45 years to age 89 without any ill effects.

The highest recorded g-force experienced by a human who survived was during the 2003 IndyCar Series finale at Texas Motor Speedway on 12 October 2003, in the 2003 Chevy 500 when the car driven by Kenny Bräck made wheel-to-wheel contact with Tomas Scheckter&#x27;s car. This immediately resulted in Bräck&#x27;s car impacting the catch fence that would record a peak of .

==Short duration shock, impact, and jerk==
Impact and mechanical shock are usually used to describe a high-kinetic-energy, short-term excitation. A shock pulse is often measured by its peak acceleration in ·s and the pulse duration. Vibration is a periodic oscillation which can also be measured in ·s as well as frequency. The dynamics of these phenomena are what distinguish them from the g-forces caused by a relatively longer-term accelerations.

After a free fall from a height formula_1 followed by deceleration over a distance formula_2 during an impact, the shock on an object is formula_3· . For example, a stiff and compact object dropped from 1 m that impacts over a distance of 1 mm is subjected to a 1000 deceleration.

Jerk is the rate of change of acceleration. In SI units, jerk is expressed as m/s3; it can also be expressed in standard gravity per second (/s; 1 /s ≈ 9.81 m/s3).

==Other biological responses==
Recent research carried out on extremophiles in Japan involved a variety of bacteria (including &quot;E. coli&quot; as a non-extremophile control) being subject to conditions of extreme gravity. The bacteria were cultivated while being rotated in an ultracentrifuge at high speeds corresponding to 403,627 g. &quot;Paracoccus denitrificans&quot; was one of the bacteria that displayed not only survival but also robust cellular growth under these conditions of hyperacceleration, which are usually only to be found in cosmic environments, such as on very massive stars or in the shock waves of supernovas. Analysis showed that the small size of prokaryotic cells is essential for successful growth under hypergravity. Notably, two multicellular species, the nematodes &quot;Panagrolaimus superbus&quot; and &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot; were shown to be able to tolerate 400,000 × &quot;g&quot; for 1 hour.
The research has implications on the feasibility of panspermia.

==Typical examples==

==Measurement using an accelerometer==

An accelerometer, in its simplest form, is a damped mass on the end of a spring, with some way of measuring how far the mass has moved on the spring in a particular direction, called an &#x27;axis&#x27;.

Accelerometers are often calibrated to measure g-force along one or more axes. If a stationary, single-axis accelerometer is oriented so that its measuring axis is horizontal, its output will be 0 &quot;g&quot;, and it will continue to be 0 &quot;g&quot; if mounted in an automobile traveling at a constant velocity on a level road. When the driver presses on the brake or gas pedal, the accelerometer will register positive or negative acceleration.

If the accelerometer is rotated by 90° so that it is vertical, it will read +1 &quot;g&quot; upwards even though stationary. In that situation, the accelerometer is subject to two forces: the gravitational force and the ground reaction force of the surface it is resting on. Only the latter force can be measured by the accelerometer, due to mechanical interaction between the accelerometer and the ground. The reading is the acceleration the instrument would have if it were exclusively subject to that force.

A three-axis accelerometer will output zero‑g on all three axes if it is dropped or otherwise put into a ballistic trajectory (also known as an inertial trajectory), so that it experiences &quot;free fall&quot;, as do astronauts in orbit (astronauts experience small tidal accelerations called microgravity, which are neglected for the sake of discussion here). Some amusement park rides can provide several seconds at near-zero g. Riding NASA&#x27;s &quot;Vomit Comet&quot; provides near-zero g-force for about 25 seconds at a time.

<text>Tobermory is a small community located at the northern tip of the Bruce Peninsula, in the traditional territory of the Saugeen Ojibway Nation. It is part of the municipality of Northern Bruce Peninsula. It is northwest of Toronto. The closest city is Owen Sound, south of Tobermory and connected by Highway 6.

Naval surveyor Henry Bayfield originally named this port Collins Harbour. Due to similar harbour conditions it was renamed after Tobermory, the largest settlement on the Isle of Mull in the Scottish Inner Hebrides.

The community is known as the &quot;freshwater SCUBA diving capital of the world&quot; because of the numerous shipwrecks that lie in the surrounding waters, especially in Fathom Five National Marine Park. Tobermory and the surrounding area are popular vacation destinations. The town lies north of the Bruce Peninsula National Park.

The passenger-car ferry connects Tobermory to Manitoulin Island in Lake Huron. Tobermory is also the northern terminus of the Bruce Trail and has twin harbours, known locally as &quot;Big Tub&quot; and &quot;Little Tub&quot;. Big Tub Harbour is Canada&#x27;s largest natural freshwater harbour.

Tobermory is typically a few degrees colder than Toronto. Many businesses in the town are open from May until the Thanksgiving long weekend in October and are closed for the other seven months of the year.

==Geography==
The Government of Ontario has erected a plaque in Tobermory about the geography of the area. The first, at the tip of the peninsula, titled ESCARPMENT SUBMERGENCE, provides this information: &quot;This shoreline marks the northern extremity of the Niagara Escarpment in southern Ontario. Stretching unbroken for 465 miles across southern Ontario from Niagara Falls. The escarpment was created by erosion of layered sedimentary rocks deposited in ancient seas of the Paleozoic Era over 400 million years ago. Portions of the escarpment form the islands between Tobermory and South Baymouth, and the same Paleozoic rocks shape the geology of Manitoulin Island.&quot;

In 1857, A. G. Robinson, the chief engineer for Lake Huron lighthouse operations, described the area as being “totally unfit for agricultural purposes.&quot; In 1869, Public Land Surveyor Charles Rankin arrived in the area to resurvey the proposed road that would run through the centre of St. Edmonds Township from the Lindsay town line to Tobermory Ontario Harbour. After six weeks of struggle to complete the task, Rankin and his crew returned to their base camp. He summarized in his report that the work had been “one of the most troublesome explorations and pieces of line running ... which I have ever met with.&quot; William Bull, a representative of the Indian Department, was sent in 1873 to explore the region to ascertain the amount of good agricultural lands and also the quality and quantity of timber resources. He reported that the town plot and some of the surrounding area were “nearly all burnt off, leaving the white rocky ridges quite bare.” 

Despite such warnings, during the 1870s and 1880s, the government sold tracts of land to prospective settlers under the guise of promoting them as agricultural lands. The result was chaotic. Some pioneers arrived and struggled to create farmland, while others came and, after battling the environment and the elements, abandoned the land. Some of these plots were taken over by others, while many tracts remained undeveloped for decades.

One major product taken from the Bruce Peninsula forests was the bark from hemlock trees. On average, about 4,000 cords of hemlock were shipped to tanneries in Kitchener, Acton, Listowel and Toronto.

The first sawmill opened in Tobermory in 1881, and within 20 years, most of the valuable timber was gone. Fires then charred the ravaged landscape, and by the 1920s, the region was nearly bare of forests. The decline of the industry forced settlers out, and the peninsula experienced a steady population decline until the 1970s, when potential cottagers showed new interest in the region and began to buy land.

Bruce Peninsula lumber is no longer a major economic force, but it provided the impetus to settle the region.

===Climate===
Tobermory has a humid continental climate (Koppen: &quot;Dfb&quot;) with four distinct seasons. Summers are mild to warm, and winters are cold. Precipitation is well-distributed year-round.

===Nature and wildlife ===
Tobermory is home to many different species of plants and animals. Ancient cedar trees survey along cliff edges and the vast dense forests in Tobermory and the Bruce Peninsula. Black bears and rare reptiles also find refuge in rocky areas of the diverse wetlands of the area.

Some of the more commonly sighted animals include black bears, raccoons, white-tailed deer, porcupines, chipmunks and a variety of snakes. The Eastern Massasauga rattlesnake can also be found in Tobermory, although it is now an endangered species.

Among the many types of plants found in the area, there are around 43 species of wild orchids on the Bruce Peninsula due to its variety of habitats. To celebrate, Tobermory hosts an annual orchid festival in June which includes guided tours and presentations.

At least one species of flower is found growing in Big Tub and no place else in the world.

Massive hauls of lumber in the early 1900s eventually resulted in settlers turning to fishing. Fishermen began dropping nets into Tobermory&#x27;s deep natural harbours, Big and Little Tub in the late 1800s. The rich fisheries began to decline in the early 1920s due to overfishing and the introduction of the lamprey eel.

==Attractions and tourism==
===Fathom Five National Marine Park===
Tobermory is located next to Fathom Five National Marine Park, Canada&#x27;s first national marine conservation area. The park includes 22 shipwrecks, several historic lighthouses, and glass-bottom cruises from Tobermory.

Lions Head

Known for its lion&#x27;s-head shape, the eroding cliff edge has served as a tourist destination in Tobermory for the past few decades, and was utilized as a landmark when sailing ships were most common, providing them with shelter from the turbulent Georgian Bay.

Tourism

Tourism is booming in the area, having grown by over 200% in the five years between 2003 and 2008, and is expected to increase in the future.

Bruce Trail

Bruce Trail, a popular hiking trail with magnificent cliff&#x27;s-edge views of the turquoise water, begins at Tobermory and runs south all the way to Niagara Falls, making it one of Canada&#x27;s oldest and longest footpaths.

Big Tub Lighthouse

Due to its proximity to Tobermory, Big Tub Lighthouse has become a popular tourist destination. Built in 1885, the Big Tub Lighthouse guided ships safely through the treacherous waters of Lake Huron and Georgian Bay into the harbour. Today, visitors can see its replacement—a six-sided wooden lighthouse standing 13.2 metres (43 ft) tall.

==Transportation==

The main road in town is Ontario Highway 6. It is the northern terminus of the southern segment of the highway as the northern section is interrupted by Georgian Bay. The ferry MS &quot;Chi-Cheemaun&quot; serves to connect the two sections of Highway 6 during part of the year.

Tobermory Airport is a public (general aviation) airport located south of the town.

==In popular culture==
The science fiction novel &quot;Commitment Hour&quot; by James Alan Gardner is set in Tober Cove, a post-apocalyptic version of Tobermory.

James Reaney&#x27;s poem &quot;Near Tobermory, Ontario&quot; describes a cove near the town.

==Media==

===Print===
The local newspaper is the &quot;Tobermory Press&quot;.

===Radio===
CHEE-FM 89.9 in Tobermory provides seasonal information about the MS &quot;Chi-Cheemaun&quot; ferry. Operating status of CHEE-FM is unknown.

CBPS-FM 90.7 Bruce Peninsula National Park provides tourism, park and weather information.

CFPS-FM Port Elgin has an FM repeater at Tobermory which operates at 91.9 FM

CHFN-FM 100.1 Neyaashiinigmiing First Nations community radio station

All other radio stations from Owen Sound, including Manitoulin Island, Sudbury, even northeastern Michigan and Central Ontario can also be heard in Tobermory and areas of the northern Bruce Peninsula.

<doc id="389841" wikidata="Q1895354" url="?curid=389841" title="Memorial University of Newfoundland">
<text>Memorial University of Newfoundland, or MUN (), is a public research university in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, based in St. John&#x27;s, with satellite campuses in Corner Brook, Happy Valley-Goose Bay, Saint Pierre, and Harlow, England. Memorial University offers certificate, diploma, undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate programs, as well as online courses and degrees.

Founded in September 1925 as a memorial to Newfoundlanders and Labradorians who died in the First World War, Memorial is the largest university in Atlantic Canada and Newfoundland and Labrador&#x27;s only university. As of 2018, there were 1,330 faculty and 2,474 staff, supporting 18,000 students from nearly 100 countries.

==History==
===Founding===
At its founding, Newfoundland was a dominion of the United Kingdom.
Memorial University began as Memorial University College (MUC), which opened in September 1925 at a campus on Parade Street in St. John&#x27;s. It was founded to honour the war dead from World War I, to provide a way of educating school teachers for the local religious schools, and to offer students higher education locally. Before that, there was no high-ranking post-secondary education in the dominion; students often went to Canada, the United Kingdom, or the United States. Students were first admitted into a non-degree program in 1925. The original location on Parade Street in St. Johns was established with the help of a grant from the Carnegie Corporation of New York.

The college was established as a memorial to the Newfoundlanders who had lost their lives on active service during the First World War. It was later rededicated also to encompass the province&#x27;s war dead of the Second World War.

The first president was J. L. Paton. It offered the first two years of university studies. MUC&#x27;s initial enrollment was 57 students, which peaked at over 400 in the 1940s. In 1933, it merged with the adjacent Normal School and took responsibility for teacher training.

===Early period===
The period from the founding in 1925 until 1949 in Newfoundland was chaotic, reflecting Newfoundland&#x27;s shifting economic and political situation, from the last flowering of independence to depression and life on the dole. The 1940 discovery of Newfoundland as a strategic military asset brought a new period of prosperity. 

Newfoundland gave up dominion status in 1934, ending self-government in exchange for British Commission of Government rule as a crown colony. Newfoundland remained a crown colony until it joined Canada as a province in 1949.

The post-Confederation government elevated the status of Memorial University College to full university status in August 1949, renaming the institution to Memorial University of Newfoundland. Memorial University was established by the Memorial University Act.

The enrolment in Memorial&#x27;s first year was 307 students.

===Expansion===

In 1959, Memorial pioneered the Extension Service as a model for field education and community development.

In 1961, enrolment increased to 1400, and Memorial moved from Parade Street to its present location on Elizabeth Avenue (St. John&#x27;s Campus).

On 8 March 1965, the government of Newfoundland announced free tuition for first-year students enrolled at Memorial University in St. John&#x27;s.
The Faculty of Medicine of Memorial University of Newfoundland was established in 1967, and the first students were admitted in 1969. It admits approximately 80 students into the M.D. program each year and also offers MSc and PhD programs.

Memorial maintains a campus in Harlow, England which opened to students in 1969. This campus has been a popular location for internships in education, and now offers credit courses, work terms, and internships in a number of areas. The campus accommodates approximately 50 students.

Memorial established the Institut Frecker in St. Pierre in 1973, to offer one-semester French immersion programs. It was housed in a building provided by the Archdiocese of St. Pierre until 2000. Now known as the Program Frecker, it is run from the FrancoForum, a language teaching facility owned by the government of St. Pierre. The program is partially supported by the governments of Canada and Newfoundland and Labrador.

In September 1975, a campus was opened in Corner Brook; it was first renamed Sir Wilfred Grenfell College in 1979 and renamed again in 2010 as Grenfell Campus, Memorial University of Newfoundland. 1300 students attend Grenfell, which offers full degree programs in several disciplines, including Fine Arts, and partial programs, which can be completed at the St. John&#x27;s campus, in many other subjects.


In 1977, the Memorial University of Newfoundland Educational Television Centre implemented the Telemedicine project.

In 1992, the Institute of Fisheries and Marine Technology in St. John&#x27;s became affiliated with Memorial University as the Fisheries and Marine Institute of Memorial University of Newfoundland. Today, it is named the Marine Institute of Memorial University of Newfoundland. It offers both degree and non-degree programs.

In the early 1990s, open-source collaboration between the Department of Computer Science and the Department of Computing and Communications produced the LabNet system, which today remains the underlying network of computers at Memorial (particularly in the Library Commons).

===The modern day===
In 2008, the university&#x27;s hiring process for incoming presidents came under scrutiny for political interference by the province&#x27;s education minister, Joan Shea.

In May 2021, the Board of Regents of Memorial University recommended that the institution should proceed with officially changing its name to &quot;Memorial University of Newfoundland and Labrador&quot;. However, changing the university&#x27;s legal name will require an act of the province&#x27;s House of Assembly, and has not yet taken effect.

In September 2019, the Memorial University Senate voted unanimously to create a degree-granting campus in Labrador. Memorial University subsequently established the School of Arctic and Sub-Arctic Studies in 2020. A campus in Happy Valley-Goose Bay (renovated from the former provincial courthouse on Hamilton River Road) was expected to offer courses in fall 2022.

In October 2023, a report by the Auditor-General found several concerns with the University&#x27;s operations and expenses.

<text>Eleni Bakopanos, (born May 10, 1954 in Argos, Greece) is a Canadian politician.

Bakopanos was a member of the Liberal Party of Canada in the House of Commons of Canada, representing the riding of Ahuntsic from 1997 to 2006, and Saint-Denis from 1993 to 1997 and is the first Greek-born woman to be elected to Parliament.

<doc id="389844" wikidata="Q6718007" url="?curid=389844" title="MS Chi-Cheemaun">
<text>MS &quot;Chi-Cheemaun&quot; is a Canadian passenger and vehicle ferry in Ontario, Canada, which traverses Lake Huron between Tobermory on the Bruce Peninsula and South Baymouth on Manitoulin Island. The ferry connects the two geographically separate portions of Highway 6 and is the vessel that replaced and in 1974. The ferry service runs seasonally from mid-May to mid-October. As of 2022 she is the third largest passenger vessel sailing the Great Lakes after the expedition cruise liner &quot;Viking Octantis&quot; and the US ferry , although several larger vessels previously serving the Great Lakes are still in service in other parts of the world.

Literally translated, &quot;chi-cheemaun&quot; (in folk orthography or &quot;chi-jiimaan&quot; in the more standard Fiero double vowel spelling) means &quot;big canoe&quot; in Ojibwe.

==History==
A trip aboard &quot;Chi-Cheemaun&quot; is a long standing Great Lakes tradition dating back to the 1930s when a small, wooden vessel, &quot;Kagawong&quot;, first ferried vehicles across the Georgian Bay between Tobermory and South Baymouth. It features a drive-on, drive-off bow and stern loading and unloading through a visored bow system and a square door stern section. The ship is long with a beam and has capacity for 648 passengers and 143 vehicles, including room for large highway vehicles such as buses and transport trucks.

&quot;Chi-Cheemaun&quot; was initially powered by two Ruston diesel engines and an bow thruster engine for improved handling of the vessel at slow speeds. During the 2006–2007 winter layover period, her Ruston engines were replaced with four Caterpillar V8 diesels. The addition of two mezzanine decks in 1982 increased the ship&#x27;s vehicle carrying capacity.

Like her predecessors on Lake Huron, &quot;Chi-Cheemaun&quot; is owned by Owen Sound Transportation Company Limited, an agency of the Ontario Ministry of Transportation (MTO)

&quot;Chi-Cheemaun&quot; makes the trip in about one hour and 45 minutes, three times each day during peak season and twice a day (with an extra trip Fridays) during May/June and September/October.

From 1989 to 1992, her sister ship, MS &quot;Nindawayma&quot;, ran the same route, but was retired because of service problems leading to public dissatisfaction and sat rusting in Owen Sound, Ontario. It was finally broken up in 2012 at Purvis Marine in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario.

==Information radio==
Two low power radio stations, CHEI-FM (89.9 FM in South Baymouth) and CHEE-FM (89.9 FM in Tobermory) broadcast tourist notices and schedule information for travellers on the ferry.

<text>Warwick Students&#x27; Union, also known as Warwick SU, is the students&#x27; union for the University of Warwick, in Coventry, England.

==History==
The Students&#x27; Union developed in tandem with the university and has existed since 1965. In its first few decades, it was heavily involved with the protests, rent strikes, and occupations which earned the university the nickname of &#x27;Red Warwick&#x27;. In 1974, one Warwick student Kevin Gately was killed during the Red Lion Square disorders. More recently, in 2009, many Students&#x27; Union officers were active in the occupation of a lecture theatre in the Social Studies (S0.21) building to express solidarity with Gaza.

One of its on-campus successes was its campaign for its own building, which finally succeeded in 1975 after lengthy opposition from large parts of the university establishment. Some of its early activism was carried out in partnership with sympathetic elements of the academic staff of the university, with one incident being chronicled in the book &quot;Warwick University Ltd.&quot;, edited by the eminent historian E. P. Thompson.

The Union is also a shareholder in the NUS Services Ltd (NUSSL).

On Tuesday 19 November 2019, a collective of students known as Warwick Occupy led an occupation of three rooms in Warwick SUHQ for 30 days to protest allegations of institutional racism within Warwick SU. The collective were made up of several liberation groups and societies on campus including Warwick Anti-Racism Society, Warwick Anti-Sexism society, Warwick Pride and Warwick Labour.

The initial protests that sparked the occupation began when retired Israeli Defense Force Colonel Eyal Dror was invited by the Warwick Jewish Israeli Society and Stand With Us UK to speak on campus. The event took place on 19 November. A statement with more than 250 signatures had called for the cancellation of the event. During the colonel&#x27;s talk, protestors linked arms and the protest eventually culminated in the occupation of three rooms in the SU headquarters.

==== Free education ====

In the Autumn of 2011, Warwick Students&#x27; Union passed policy against tuition fees which stated its position in defence of free education.

In October 2014, a campaign group emerged, called Warwick for Free Education. The group rose to prominence after a sit-in at the university&#x27;s Senate House was broken up by the police, who had been called in to deal with an assault of a university staff member. The police were accused of using excessive force, and video footage appears to a show a police officer using CS spray on students. This led to an investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission. In July 2015, one protester was found guilty of common assault, while another was found guilty of causing fear and provoking violence.

In response to his handling of the situation and other issues, Warwick Students&#x27; Union passed a Vote of No Confidence against Nigel Thrift, Vice-Chancellor of the university. A two-hour panel debate was held on the student protests, at which Thrift faced further criticism for calling students &quot;yobs&quot;. University Registrar, Ken Sloan, said that Thrift&#x27;s response was &quot;very human&quot; claiming that Thrift had been victim to a student campaign of targeted intimidation, and had been verbally abused and spat at near his home. The Warwick for Free Education Campaign group denied any association with such attacks but claimed they &quot;further highlight the widespread dissatisfaction and anger towards Nigel Thrift and his behaviour as VC&quot;.

==== Fossil fuel divestment ====

On 8 July 2015, the university committed to divesting from fossil fuels, and placing its investments elsewhere when an opportunity becomes available. This came in the wake of a successful student campaign, and union referendum at which 65% of voters supported divestment. At the time of the decision, the university held no direct investments in any of the 200 largest fossil fuel companies, but did hold indirect investments, which it pledged to eliminate.

==== Disaffiliation from, and subsequent reaffiliation to, the National Union of Students (NUS) ====

In February 2023, the student body voted to leave the National Union of Students in the Spring 2023 All Student Vote, a group of generally binding referenda put forward by students to be voted on by the student body. The primary arguments made for leaving were over allegations of antisemitism within the body and the £30,000/year membership costs. The vote was 42.1% in favour, with 35.9% voting against and 22% abstaining.

It subsequently voted to reaffiliate in the Autumn 2023 term&#x27;s All Student Vote, with the primary arguments for reaffiliating being that the prior vote to disaffiliate &quot;received only 42.1% of votes in favour, with a large proportion (more than 20%) of students abstaining&quot;, the fact the NUS was &quot;the formal national body for representing students&quot;, that &quot;its lobbying secured £243 million for university hardship funds during the cost of living crisis&quot;, that the disaffiliation campaign was heavily criticised for its treatment of Jewish students and the Jewish Society, with the President of the Society calling its treatment of JSoc and Jewish students &quot;reductive and exploitative&quot;, and that it had not called for Students Unions to disaffiliate over the findings of the recent antisemitism report.
The vote to reaffiliate passed with higher turnout than previously, an increase of 16.7%, with 64.1% voting in favour, 16.1% voting against and 19.7% abstaining.

Warwick Conservative Society Controversy

In June 2024, the Sunday Times broke a story about the University of Warwick Conservative Association&#x27;s (UWCA) Chairman&#x27;s Dinner. Video evidence from the event shows members and attendees dancing to Erika, a Nazi-era German marching song. According to the article, some members later chanted &quot;Kill the Hughs&quot;, apparently substituting the word &quot;Jews&quot; with the first name of recently departed association chairman Hugh Herring, and declared: &quot;Heil the chairman.&quot;

Warwick Students&#x27; Union subsequently suspended the UWCA for up to 90 days pending an external investigation by the university, after widespread condemnation in the media and by student groups who coordinated a collective statement calling for action, including the disbandment of the UWCA.

==Students&#x27; Union building==
The Union consists of Union South (largely food, drink and entertainment) and Union North (mostly administration, offices and meeting rooms).

The Students&#x27; Union got its first building, Union South, in 1975, after a long struggle with the university under Vice-Chancellor Jack Butterworth, who said to Will Fitzgerald (President of the Union in 1970–1): &quot;the Students&#x27; Union will never have its own building.&quot; Union North was added in the 1990s and, until recently, was linked to Union South by the &#x27;link corridor.&#x27;

===Union South rebuild===

The Union South building underwent a £11 million refurbishment in spring 2008, which was completed in January 2010. The new facilities included a club and gig venue, &quot;The Copper Rooms&quot;, a pub, &quot;The Dirty Duck&quot;, a sandwich bar, &quot;The Bread Oven&quot;(now called The Food Station), a drinks bar, &quot;The Terrace Bar&quot;, a tea room, Curiositea, branches of Santander and Barclays banks, a pharmacy, a travel agent, spaces for societies and a pool room.

==Union companies==
The Union has four subsidiary companies:

* Student Union Services Warwick Limited (Registered company number: 02197761)
* Membership Solutions Limited (Registered company number: 05525449)
* Warwick Students Union Services Limited, (Registered company number: 01187495) (mostly dormant and retained due to contracts held in its name)
* Students&#x27; Union Warwick Events Limited (Registered company number: 06371766)

In the style of the University of Warwick itself, the Union has an entrepreneurial strategy. Unlike many other British universities, which have privatised halls of accommodation and catering facilities, Warwick provides all of these in-house through its many subsidiaries. With Warwick SU, the entrepreneurial strategy is manifest through Membership Solutions Limited, an IT company that currently provides website and other solutions for membership organisations across the UK.

== Union Awards ==

=== Societies Awards ===
=== Student Voice and Impact Awards ===
The Student Voice and Impact Awards recognise and celebrate students who advocate and create change for the student experience, including Course Reps, Execs, Activists &amp; Campaigners.
==Notable people==
* Lord Kerslake, former Head of the Home Civil Service, served as General Secretary from 1977 to 1978.
* The Conservative MP David Davis stood for the position of President during his attendance at Warwick, but failed to win. He also founded Radio Warwick, the student radio station.
* Claire Horton, served as Chief Executive from 2002 to 2008.

<text>A trimaran (or double-outrigger) is a multihull boat that comprises a main hull and two smaller outrigger hulls (or &quot;floats&quot;) which are attached to the main hull with lateral beams. Most modern trimarans are sailing yachts designed for recreation or racing; others are ferries or warships. They originated from the traditional double-outrigger hulls of the Austronesian cultures of Maritime Southeast Asia; particularly in the Philippines and Eastern Indonesia, where it remains the dominant hull design of traditional fishing boats. Double-outriggers are derived from the older catamaran and single-outrigger boat designs.

== Terminology ==
The word &quot;trimaran&quot; is a portmanteau of &quot;tri&quot; and &quot;(cata)maran&quot;, a term that is thought to have been coined by Victor Tchetchet, a pioneering, Ukrainian-born modern multihull designer. Trimarans consist of a main hull connected to outrigger floats on either side by a crossbeam, wing, or other form of superstructure—the traditional Polynesian terms for the hull, each float and connector are &quot;vaka&quot;, &quot;ama&quot; and &quot;aka&quot;, respectively (although trimarans are not traditionally Polynesian, since they instead use single-outrigger and catamaran configurations).

== Sailing trimarans ==
=== History ===

The first double-outrigger boats were developed by the Austronesian people and are still widely used today by traditional fishermen in maritime Southeast Asia. It developed from the more ancient single-outrigger boats as a way to deal with the problem of the instability of the latter when tacking leeward. Double-outrigger boats, however, did not develop among Austronesians in Micronesia and Polynesia (although it exists in western Melanesia), where single-outrigger boats and catamarans are used instead.

Warships with double-outriggers were used widely in Maritime Southeast Asia since ancient times up until the early modern period, with examples like the &quot;karakoa&quot;, &quot;lanong&quot; &quot;kora kora&quot;, &quot;knabat bogolu&quot;, and the Borobudur ships . These were often referred to by Europeans during the colonial era as &quot;proas&quot;, a general term which can also refer to single-outriggers and even to native ships without outriggers.

==== 20th century ====
Recreational sailing catamarans and trimarans gained popularity during the 1960s and 1970s. Amateur development of the modern sailing trimaran started in 1945 with the efforts of Victor Tchetchet, a Ukrainian émigré to the US, who built two trimarans made of marine plywood, which were about long. He is credited with coining the term, &quot;trimaran.&quot; In the 1950s and 60s, Arthur Piver designed and built plywood kit trimarans, which were adopted by other homebuilders, but were heavy and not sea-kindly by modern standards. Some of these achieved ocean crossings, nonetheless. Other designers followed, including Jim Brown, Ed Horstman, John Marples, Jay Kantola, Chris White, Norman Cross, Derek Kelsall and Richard Newick, thus bringing the trimaran cruiser to new levels of performance and safety.

Following the homebuilt movement, production models became available. Some trimarans in the are designed as &quot;day-sailers&quot; which can be transported on a road trailer. These include the original Farrier – Corsair folding trimarans, such as the F-27 Sport Cruiser – and original John Westell swing-wing folding trimaran (using the same folding system later adopted also on Quorning Dragonfly) and like trimarans.

Modern western-built trimarans typically do not use Austronesian rigging like tanja or crab claw sails. Instead they use a standard Bermuda rig. Trimarans are also typically significantly wider. In addition, trimaran floats are much more buoyant than those of outrigger canoes to support a large sailplan. They contribute to drag when heavily immersed, and their level of immersion indicates when to reef. In terms of performance, an objective comparison by Doran (1972) in terms of maximum progress against the wind, maximum speed, and speed downwind concluded that both the traditional double-outrigger &quot;vinta&quot; of the Philippines and the single-outrigger &quot;wa&quot; of the Caroline Islands, respectively, are still superior to the modern trimaran.
=== Folding trimarans ===

Several manufacturers build trimarans in which the floats can be removed, repositioned, or folded near to the main hull. This allows them to be trailerable and/or to fit in a normal monohull space in a marina. Several mechanisms allow the amas or outriggers to be stored compactly:

* Demountable fixed tubes that are assembled before launching.
* Telescoping tubes
* Hinge and latch system that allows the amas to fold over the main hull to reduce width for trailing.
* Vertical folding that lifts the amas upwards and over the main hull.
* Horizontal articulation that moves the amas forward or backwards at the same level as the hull.
* Horizontal folding of the amas towards the main hull.

=== Safety ===

Trimaran safety features include amas with multiple sealed partitions, controls that all run to the cockpit, a collision bulkhead, partial or full cockpit coverings or windshields, and drain holes in the cockpit that can adequately drain the cockpit quickly, among other things.

Trimaran capsizes are more likely to be of the pitchpole type than a roll to one side due to their higher sideways stability and speeds. Capsized trimarans are harder to turn upright after they have turtled than monohull boats. While some capsized trimarans righted by sideways rotation may suffer heavy damage to mast and rigging, many modern and ancient trimarans are explicitly designed for this method of righting. Harnesses pulling on the stern toward the bow, or from the bow toward the stern of capsized trimarans have been shown to be able to successfully turn them end-over-end. Several design features reduce the chance of pitch-pole capsize; these include having wing nets with an open weave designed to reduce windage and decks and nets that shed water easily. The best way to avoid capsize is to reduce sail in heavy weather.

== Competition and records ==
Thomas Coville holds the world record of 49 days and 3 hours for sailing solo around the world in the trimaran &quot;Sodebo Ultim&quot;, finishing on December 25, 2016. The previous record was set by Francis Joyon on January 20, 2008. The 51-year-old Frenchman circled the planet alone in 57 days, 13 hours, 34 minutes, 6 seconds in a trimaran. He beat British sailor Ellen MacArthur&#x27;s record set in February 2005 for which she spent just over 71 days at sea.

Francis Joyon and a crew of five in the maxi trimaran &quot;IDEC SPORT&quot; set the absolute (wind or mechanically powered) time for the fastest maritime circumnavigation, in 40 days 23 hours 30 minutes 30 seconds of sailing between Dec 2016 and Jan 2017. Their average speed was 26.85 knots (30.71 MPH) over a total distance of . In early 2020, the same boat won a race retracing the tea clipper route from Hong Kong to London in just under 32 days – one-third the time it took the clippers to sail the route.

&quot;Hydroptère&quot;, an experimental sailing hydrofoil trimaran, briefly reached near Fos-sur-Mer, but capsized and turtled shortly thereafter.

=== 33rd America&#x27;s Cup ===

Competing with a giant trimaran the BMW Oracle Racing team won the 2010 America&#x27;s Cup for the Golden Gate Yacht Club on February 14, 2010, off Valencia, Spain. The team beat the giant catamaran Alinghi 2–0 in the best-of-three series, becoming the first American syndicate to win the cup since 1992. The large rigid wing sail of the USA 17 trimaran provided a decisive advantage and the trimaran won the America&#x27;s Cup by a considerable margin in each race.

=== Powerboat ===
&quot;Earthrace&quot; broke the world record for circumnavigating the globe in a motorized boat in 2008 in just under 61 days.

== Trimaran ships ==
The trimaran configurations has also been used for both passenger ferries and warships. The Australian shipbuilding company, Austal, investigated the comparative merits of trimaran ships, catamarans and monohulls. It found that there was an optimum location for the outer hulls in terms of minimizing wave generation and consequent power requirements for operating at high speeds with a payload of 1,000 tonnes. It further found that such a trimaran configuration was superior to a catamaran for roll and lateral force in a beam sea and superior in suppressing motion sickness resulting from a head sea.

The negative considerations for trimarans, compared with catamarans or monohulls are:

* A more complicated and consequently more expensive hull structure for the payload, making them more suited for low-density cargo or passengers.
* More complicated geometry and large size per unit of cargo carried, which makes docking more difficult than for a catamaran or monohull.
Between 2005 and 2020, Austal had built 14 aluminum high-speed trimaran ships, 11 of which were for the US Navy. In 2020, they had 11 trimarans under construction or under order. In addition to shipyards in Australia and the US, the company had shipyards in Vietnam and the Philippines.

In 2005 Austal delivered the &quot;Benchijigua Express&quot; to Spanish ferry operator Fred Olsen, S.A. for service in the Canary Islands. Capable of carrying 1,280 passengers and 340 cars, or equivalents, at speeds up to 40 knots, this boat was the longest aluminum ship in the world at the time of delivery. A modern warship, the RV &quot;Triton&quot; was commissioned by British defence contractor QinetiQ in 2000. In October 2005, the United States Navy commissioned for evaluation the construction of a General Dynamics litoral combat ship trimaran designed and built by Austal.

=== High-speed ferries ===
High-speed craft are governed by a code that applies to those designed for international passenger voyages that are shorter than four hours from a port of refuge, or cargo craft of 500 gross tonnage no more than eight hours from a port of refuge. All passengers are provided with a seat and there are no enclosed sleeping berths.

The demand for high-speed ferries started in the late 1970s for ferries built mostly in Norway. Ultimately, two Australian shipyards came to prominence, Incat and Austal. They were initially built by many shipyards, but by the turn of the century only two companies were still building larger vessels of over 70 metres and 3,000 Gross Tons. While Incat has specialized in wave-piercing catamarans, Austal has developed high-speed trimarans.

In 2010 Austal built the 102 metre Hull 270, although they were unable to find a buyer for the ship until it was sold to Condor Ferries in 2015 when it was named HSC Condor Liberation and began operating to the Channel Islands. Prospects for trimaran ferries picked up in 2017 when Fred. Olsen Express ordered two 118-metre trimarans for their Canary Islands services, named &quot;Bajamar Express&quot; and &quot;Bañaderos Express&quot;. In 2018 a Japanese company ordered an 83-metre trimaran ferry.

=== Naval ships ===

The first use of trimaran hull designs in modern navies was in the RV &quot;Triton&quot;, a Research Vessel for the Royal Navy. She was built as a technology demonstrator ship for the Royal Navy&#x27;s Future Surface Combatant, and has been used to prove the viability of the hull form. Since 2007 the ship has been used by the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service&#x27;s Customs Marine Unit.

Littoral combat ships built by General Dynamics at Bath Iron Works are of a trimaran design. USS &quot;Independence&quot; (LCS-2) is the first of these ships. Littoral combat ships built by Lockheed are of a monohull design.

First launched on August 31, 2012, at Bali Strait, 63M Carbon Fibre Composite Trimaran Fast Missile Boat (Indonesian: Kapal Cepat Rudal [KCR]) named Klewang-class fast attack craft (Klewang- means a traditional Indonesian single edge sword), was the first stealth trimaran of the Indonesian Navy built by North Sea Boats at Banyuwangi, East Java, Indonesia. Designed by New Zealand Naval Architects LOMOcean Marine this ship combined a number of existing advance technologies into a single, unique platform; a wave-piercer trimaran hull from, constructed exclusively of infused vinylester carbon fibre cored sandwich materials for all structural elements, with external &quot;stealth&quot; geometry and features intended to reduce detection. The KRI Klewang (625) caught fire because of an electrical short-circuit in the engine room during a maintenance period on September 28, 2012, and was a total loss.

43-meter &quot;Ocean Eagle &quot; trimarans from CMN wharf with design from Nigel Irens und Prolarge based on the &quot;Ocean Adventurer&quot; concept will provide coastal protection for Mozambique.

<doc id="389852" wikidata="Q13424464" url="?curid=389852" title="Mass meeting">
<text>In parliamentary law, a mass meeting is a type of deliberative assembly or popular assembly, which in a publicized or selectively distributed notice known as the call of the meeting - has been announced:

*as called to take appropriate action on a particular problem or toward a particular purpose stated by the meeting&#x27;s sponsors, and
*as open to everyone interested in the stated problem or purpose (or to everyone within a specified sector of the population thus interested).

==Participants==
To the extent that persons in the invited category are clearly identifiable - as, for example, registered voters of a particular political party, or residents of a certain area - only such persons have the right to make motions, to speak, and to vote at the meeting, and none others need be admitted if the sponsors so choose. Attendees at a mass meeting are there under the implied understanding that the sponsors (who have engaged the hall and assumed the expenses of promoting the meeting) have the right to have the proceedings confined to the overall object they have announced. The assembled group of persons who are attending has the right to determine the action to be taken in pursuit of the stated object. &quot;Membership&quot; consists of all persons in the invited category who attend. If no qualification was placed in the call of the meeting, anyone who attends is regarded as a member and has the same rights as members in other assemblies - to make motions, to speak in debate, and to vote.

==Organization==
*Call of the meeting - The announcement of a mass meeting should specify the date, hour, and place of the meeting, its purpose, and who should attend.
*Advance Preparation - Sponsors calling for the mass meeting should decide:
**whom they prefer for its chairman;
**who shall call the meeting to order and nominate their choice of chairman;
**who shall be nominated for secretary and by whom;
**what rules-if any-shall be proposed for adoption; and
**who shall make the initial talk explaining the purpose of the meeting.
*Opening of the Meeting - The election of a chair and a secretary should be done right after the meeting is called to order.
*Transactions in the Meeting
**The purpose of the meeting is announced (usually by the secretary reading the call of the meeting.)
**Resolutions are offered to accomplish the purpose of the meeting -- these may either be prepared in advance or a committee can be appointed to draft resolutions and to make a report back to the assembly.
*Adjournment - If a place and time are not set for the next meeting, adjournment dissolves the organization.

When it is desired to form a permanent society, the organizers proceed in much the same way as for a mass meeting, except that the meetings while the organization is being formed should usually be carefully limited to persons whose interest in the project is known. For this reason, it may be desirable to solicit attendance for these meetings by personal contact or by letter, rather than by public announcement. A series of meetings is usually held when organizing a permanent society.

<doc id="389853" wikidata="Q7395998" url="?curid=389853" title="Sabbatical officer">
<text>In the United Kingdom, a sabbatical officer is a full-time officer elected by the members of a students&#x27; union (or similar body such as students&#x27; association, students&#x27; representative council or guild of students), commonly at a higher education establishment such as a university. Sabbatical officers are usually trustees of their students&#x27; union, in its capacity as a charity, and may also sit on or form the board of directors of the union.

Sabbatical officers (or &#x27;sabbs&#x27;) are normally elected annually, for a one-year term, i.e. a &#x27;sabbatical year&#x27;. Some students&#x27; unions allow their sabbatical officers stand for re-election for a second year. Terms of more than two years are not permitted in the UK, under the Education Act 1994. Typically, the primary requirement for candidacy (and election) is that a candidate be a member of the body of the relevant association at the time of their candidacy.

Sabbatical years are either taken in between years of study (for example between year two and three of a typical degree, sitting the third year twelve months later than would have normally been the case) or else immediately after graduation. They are almost always paid positions, with funds coming from the students&#x27; union itself, or directly from the educational institution. The officer generally retains student status during their time in office.

A university students&#x27; union may have one or more sabbatical officers, with as many as eight being not unheard of. Each generally has a specific job description and title, such as President, Education Officer, Societies Officer, Sports Officer (often both Sports and Societies are overseen by one Students Activities Officer), Services Officer, Welfare Officer or Communications Officer. Together they form all or part of the &quot;executive&quot; or &quot;executive committee&quot; (or equivalent) of their organisation. They are generally supported by unpaid part-time officers who fulfil their roles while continuing their studies. In some cases, sabbaticals may work for separate bodies within a larger students&#x27; association at their institution; for example a sabbatical president of an athletics union when there are other officer working for the main students&#x27; union.

Some Further Education colleges also have small numbers of sabbatical officers but these are rare, partly due to funding restrictions. Often the executive members of the students&#x27; association of these bodies will do the job whilst still studying.

Student organisations outside of individual educational institutions, such as the National Union of Students of the United Kingdom, sometimes have their own sabbatical officers drawn from one of their member institutions.

<doc id="389854" wikidata="Q1374534" url="?curid=389854" title="EuroBillTracker">
<text>EuroBillTracker (EBT) is a website designed for tracking euro banknotes. It was inspired by the US currency bill tracking website Where&#x27;s George? The aim is to record as many notes as possible to know details about their distribution and movements, follow it up, like where a note has been seen in particular, and generate statistics and rankings, for example, in which countries there are more tickets. EuroBillTracker has registered over 231 million notes with a combined total value of more than €4.2 billion as of November 2024.

== Characteristics ==
EuroBillTracker is an international non-profit volunteer team dedicated to tracking euro notes around the world. The site is made up of people who simply enter the information from the notes in their possession. Each user enters the serial numbers and location information for each note they obtain into EuroBillTracker. A user can then see any comments from other people who have had that note. From this information, the site extracts:
* Diffusion information: Each euro country has its own range of note serial numbers and from this information EBT can generate diffusion graphs that tell us how the notes travel to other countries. See the Diffusion section for more information.
* Tracking information: When a note is re-entered, the users who previously entered it are notified via email. These hits can be seen in the statistics section.
* Statistics and rankings: Who enters the most notes, which are the top countries? Where are the notes currently situated?

Euro banknotes and coins were put into circulation on 1 January 2002 and EBT has been tracking notes since then. The site was initially created by Philippe Girolami (giro). Anssi Johansson (avij) has been assisting with running the site since mid-2003. Site translation and various other tasks are handled by a group of active EBT users.

EuroBillTracker is not affiliated with the European Union, European Central Bank, national central banks or other financial institutions. Using EBT is completely free. Unlike Where&#x27;s George?, EuroBillTracker requires users to register an account before they can enter details of banknotes.

From February 2008 onwards, the website is supposed to be run by a non-profit organization based in France, and called the European Society for EuroBillTrackers or Association des Eurobilltrackers. This organisation, operating generally similar to the Wikimedia Foundation, will be in charge of protecting the EuroBillTracker database and ensuring it is free of charge. Proceedings for the founding of the association are under way as of January 2008; they were launched after disagreements between the founder of the website and other webmasters caused a split of EuroBillTracker into two different sites on 24 December 2007. The two sites reunited in early 2008.

== Statistical facts ==
===Core figures===
As of 1 January 2023:
* Number of users: over 200,500
* Number of banknotes: over 215,200,000
* Total value of all notes: over €3,900,000,000
* Number of interesting hits: over 1,244,000
* Number of bills by country:
=== Number of banknotes entered (history) ===

== Community ==
The growing popularity of EuroBillTracker has led to the development of a community of &quot;trackers&quot;, especially in countries with a higher usage of the website, such as Finland, the Benelux countries and Slovenia. On the contrary, the percentage of users with respect to the national population is especially low in some south European countries such as France, Spain or Greece, and also in Republic of Ireland

Since 2004, the community has been organising a pan-European yearly meeting during summer. After the 2008 meeting in Ljubljana, the EBT users also decided to organise a winter pan-European meeting.
* The 2020 Winter meeting will take place in Luxembourg during the weekend of 28–29 March.

Curiosities:
* The Winter Meeting in 2010 was the first where the name of the country was attributed to the meeting instead of the host city;
* The city of Frankfurt am Main was the host of the Winter 2012 Meeting, where the 10th Anniversary of EuroBillTracker was celebrated;
* The Summer 2016 Meeting was the first with a repeat host (in Malta, which also hosted the 2010 Winter Meeting);

Apart from the yearly meeting, national communities have been organising local gatherings at various levels; most notably, the German-speaking community was once hosted at the European Central Bank headquarters in Frankfurt am Main in April 2007. The visit was repeated in April 2012, during an international meeting.

== Notes ==
There was no Winter Meeting in 2017 because the only host that applied to organize the event did it outside of the deadline date.

<text>James Outram (13 October 1864 – 12 March 1925) was a British clergyman, who made many first ascents in the Canadian Rockies in the early 1900s.

==Biography==

Outram was born in London, England, the son of Sir Francis Boyd Outram, of India fame. He was educated at Haileybury College and Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he gained his degree of Master of Arts. He came to the Canadian Rockies in 1900, and devoted himself to Alpine pursuits for some years, making his headquarters in Calgary. He ascended the hitherto unclimbed Mount Assiniboine in 1901. He contested for first ascents of the highest summits of the Rockies with J. Norman Collie, including the pursuit of the mythical giants Hooker and Brown.

His climbing accomplishments include:
* 1900 - ascent of Cascade Mountain 
* 1901 - first ascents (guided) of Mount Assiniboine , Mount Vaux , Chancellor Peak , and Cathedral Mountain .
* 1902 - first ascents guided by Christian Kaufmann of Mount Bryce , Mount Columbia , Mount Forbes , and Mount Wilson .

Outram wrote a book about his adventures called &quot;In the Heart of the Canadian Rockies&quot;, first published in 1905, and several magazine articles, all dealing with mountaineering.

In 1920, Mount Outram in Banff National Park was named in his honour.

In 1921 he married a daughter of the late Joseph Balfour. He had no children. He was a member of the Anglican Church, in the congregation of St. Stephens, Calgary.

Outram was a dedicated Orangeman and a member of the Vermilion, Alberta, Loyal Orange Lodge Number 2078 in 1915. In 1916 he was elected the Worshipful Master of that lodge and in 1917 and 1918 he was elected the Worshipful Master for Victoria County, Alberta. In 1918 he was elected the Right Worshipful Grand Master of the Grand Orange Lodge of Alberta, and again re-elected in 1919 and 1920. He was also a member of the Vermilion lodge of the Ladies Orange Benevolent Association.

Outram also belonged to another Protestant fraternal organization known as the Royal Black Knights of the Camp of Israel where he served as Grand Registrar of the Grand Black Chapter of Alberta for 1921–1925. He was a knight in the Mannville Royal Black Preceptory, Number 948.

Outram died in Victoria, British Columbia on 12 March 1925 after several months of illness.

<text>Colonel Florencio &#x27;Chito&#x27; Flores Aguilar ( 1931 – 28 March 2020) was a Panamanian army officer.

Flores served as Commander of the Panamanian National Guard following the death of General Omar Torrijos on 31 July 1981. Colonel Flores assumed command of the Panamanian military, but unlike his predecessor or his successors, he did not exercise his power as a military leader of Panama. He was displaced in March 1982 by Colonel Rubén Darío Paredes.

<text>Rubén Darío Paredes del Río (born 11 August 1933) is a Panamanian army officer who was the military ruler of Panama from 1982 to 1983.

Colonel Paredes came to power after the displacement of Colonel Florencio Flores, due to the instability of Panamanian National Guard after the death of Omar Torrijos. He was educated at the military academy in Nicaragua. Paredes&#x27; tenure as National Guard commander was from March 1982 to August 1983. Paredes was promoted to the rank of general on March 3. In August 1983, Paredes resigned over a dispute concerning the government&#x27;s attitude towards the United States involvement in Nicaragua. He retired from the Panamanian National Guard after making a deal with Manuel Noriega that would make Paredes president. However, after his resignation, Noriega reneged on the deal and had him arrested. He ran unsuccessfully as president in the 1984 election as a candidate.

Paredes is retired and lives in Panama City, Panama. His uncle, Rigoberto Paredes, was a member of the National Assembly in the 1980s and was alleged to be one of Noriega&#x27;s closest allies. Rigoberto hosted a talk radio show on Radio BB in Panama City. Rigoberto Paredes died in 2007.

<doc id="389876" wikidata="Q1757458" url="?curid=389876" title="Particle system">
<text>A particle system is a technique in game physics, motion graphics, and computer graphics that uses many minute sprites, 3D models, or other graphic objects to simulate certain kinds of &quot;fuzzy&quot; phenomena, which are otherwise very hard to reproduce with conventional rendering techniques – usually highly chaotic systems, natural phenomena, or processes caused by chemical reactions.

Introduced in the 1982 film &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot; for the fictional &quot;Genesis effect&quot;, other examples include replicating the phenomena of fire, explosions, smoke, moving water (such as a waterfall), sparks, falling leaves, rock falls, clouds, fog, snow, dust, meteor tails, stars and galaxies, or abstract visual effects like glowing trails, magic spells, etc. – these use particles that fade out quickly and are then re-emitted from the effect&#x27;s source. Another technique can be used for things that contain many strands – such as fur, hair, and grass – involving rendering an entire particle&#x27;s lifetime at once, which can then be drawn and manipulated as a single strand of the material in question.

Particle systems are defined as a group of points in space, guided by a collection of rules defining behavior and appearance. Particle systems model phenomena as a cloud of particles, using stochastic processes to simplify the definition of dynamical system and fluid mechanics with that are difficult to represent with affine transformations.

== Typical implementation ==

Particle systems typically implement the following modules:
* An emission stage, which provides a location and generates new particles.
* A simulation stage, which update parameters and simulates how particles evolve.
* A rendering stage, which specifies how to render a particle.

=== Emission stage ===
An emitter implements a spawning rate (how many particles are generated per unit of time), the particles&#x27; initial velocity vector (the direction they are emitted upon creation). When using a mesh object as an emitter, the initial velocity vector is often set to be normal to the individual face(s) of the object, making the particles appear to &quot;spray&quot; directly from each face but this is optional.

=== Simulation stage ===
During the simulation stage, the number of new particles that must be created is calculated based on spawning rates and the interval between updates, and each of them is spawned in a specific position in 3D space based on the emitter&#x27;s position and the spawning area specified. Each of the particle&#x27;s parameters (i.e. velocity, color, etc.) is initialized according to the emitter&#x27;s parameters. At each update, all existing particles are checked to see if they have exceeded their lifetime, in which case they are removed from the simulation. Otherwise, the particles&#x27; position and other characteristics are advanced based on a physical simulation, which can be as simple as translating their current position, or as complicated as performing physically accurate trajectory calculations which take into account external forces (gravity, friction, wind, etc.). It is common to perform collision detection between particles and specified 3D objects in the scene to make the particles bounce off of or otherwise interact with obstacles in the environment. Collisions between particles are rarely used, as they are computationally expensive and not visually relevant for most simulations.

=== Rendering stage ===
After the update is complete, each particle is rendered, usually in the form of a textured billboarded quad (i.e. a quadrilateral that is always facing the viewer). However, this is sometimes not necessary for games; a particle may be rendered as a single pixel in small resolution/limited processing power environments. Conversely, in motion graphics particles tend to be full but small-scale and easy-to-render 3D models, to ensure fidelity even at high resolution. Particles can be rendered as Metaballs in off-line rendering; isosurfaces computed from particle-metaballs make quite convincing liquids. Finally, 3D mesh objects can &quot;stand in&quot; for the particles — a snowstorm might consist of a single 3D snowflake mesh being duplicated and rotated to match the positions of thousands or millions of particles.

== Particle system taxonomy ==
In 1983, Reeves defined only animated points, creating moving particulate simulations — sparks, rain, fire, etc. In these implementations, each frame of the animation contains each particle at a specific position in its life cycle, and each particle occupies a single point position in space. For effects such as fire or smoke that dissipate, each particle is given a fade out time or fixed lifetime; effects such as snowstorms or rain instead usually terminate the lifetime of the particle once it passes out of a particular field of view.

In 1985, Reeves extended the concept to include rendering the entire life cycle of each particle simultaneously, the result transforms particles into static strands of material that show the overall trajectory, rather than points. These strands can be used to simulate hair, fur, grass, and similar materials. The strands can be controlled with the same velocity vectors, force fields, spawning rates, and deflection parameters that animated particles obey. In addition, the rendered thickness of the strands can be controlled and in some implementations may be varied along the length of the strand. Different combinations of parameters can impart stiffness, limpness, heaviness, bristliness, or any number of other properties. The strands may also use texture mapping to vary the strands&#x27; color, length, or other properties across the emitter surface.

In 1987, Reynolds introduces notions of flocking, herding or schooling behaviors. The boids model extends particle simulation to include external state interactions including goal seeking, collision avoidance, flock centering, and limited perception.

In 2003, Müller extended particle systems to fluidics by simulating viscosity, pressure and surface tension, and then rendered surfaces by interpolating the discrete positions with Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics.

== Developer-friendly particle system tools ==
Particle systems code that can be included in game engines, digital content creation systems, and effects applications can be written from scratch or downloaded. Havok provides multiple particle system APIs. Their Havok FX API focuses especially on particle system effects. Ageia - now a subsidiary of Nvidia - provides a particle system and other game physics API that is used in many games, including Unreal Engine 3 games. Both GameMaker Studio and Unity provide a two-dimensional particle system often used by indie, hobbyist, or student game developers, though it cannot be imported into other engines. Many other solutions also exist, and particle systems are frequently written from scratch if non-standard effects or behaviors are desired.

The village is located north of both the Durham Interforest factory and the stretch of Grey Road 4 between Durham and Hanover.

The first settlers came to Aberdeen around 1845. Milton C. Schofield built the first mill there on the Rocky Saugeen River in 1851. For a while, the small emerging village was called Scholfield&#x27;s Mill.

School was first taught in local homes, but a log structure was erected in 1854. S.S. Bentinck 10 was built in 1873. It was a stone building measuring 38 feet by 30 feet and costing $9 to build. Most of the labour and materials were donated. Dr. William J. Dunlop, minister of education in the Leslie Frost cabinet, 1952–60, received his education there. By 1945, the school was closed and any remaining students walked or were driven three miles to nearby Rocky Saugeen School. The school briefly reopened in 1966, but closed for good in 1967, when school amalgamation occurred and students were bussed to nearby Durham.

James W. Crawford bought the mill, use of the water and dam, and 20 surrounding hectares of land for $3400 - an enormous amount of money for the time - in 1879. He updated the mill and named the village after his birthplace in Aberdeen, Scotland. The village got its first post office and blacksmith shop in 1881. Other businesses included a spinning wheel maker, a weaver, and a cooper shop.

The village boomed and expanded until 1896, when wood for the mill and export began to become scarce.

In 1896, the Electric Light Company took out a lease that would provide electricity for Durham residents until the 1940s.

Most of the land, once cleared of its trees, is totally enclosed in trees again.

<text>Houston Grand Opera (HGO) is an American opera company located in Houston, Texas. Founded in 1955 by German-born impresario Walter Herbert and three local Houstonians, the company is resident at the Wortham Theater Center. This theatre is also home to the Houston Ballet. In its history, the company has received a Tony Award, two Grammy Awards, and three Emmy Awards, the only opera company in the world to win these three honours. Houston Grand Opera is supported by an active auxiliary organization, the Houston Grand Opera Guild, established in October 1955.

==History==
In 1955, the German-born impresario Walter Herbert and Houstonians Elva Lobit, Edward Bing, and Charles Cockrell founded the company. Its inaugural season featured two performances of two operas, &quot;Salome&quot; (starring Brenda Lewis in the title role) and &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;. David Gockley succeeded Walter Herbert as general director in 1972. During Gockley&#x27;s tenure, the company began regularly commissioning and producing new works, primarily from American composers. Gockley remained as general director until 2005.

Anthony Freud succeeded Gockley as general director in 2005, and held the post until 2011. Following Freud&#x27;s departure, joint leadership was shared between Patrick Summers, who had been music director at HGO since 1998, and Perryn Leech, who joined the company in 2006 and became chief operating officer in 2010. Summers took the titles of artistic director and music director, and Leech became managing director. For the 2017–2018 season, HGO performed at the &#x27;HGO Resilience Theater&#x27;, a temporary space created in an exhibit hall at the George R. Brown Convention Center, after the Wortham Theater Center was closed due to flooding from Hurricane Harvey in August 2017. Leech stood down as managing director of the company in December 2020.

In June 2021, the company announced the appointment of Khori Dastoor as its next general director and CEO, effective January 2022. Dastoor is the first woman ever named to the posts.

==Musical forces==
The Houston Grand Opera Orchestra consists of 49 part time professional musicians and plays all Houston Grand Opera performances. The orchestra is a member of the Regional Orchestra Players Association and is a per service orchestra.

No music director was appointed during the Walter Herbert years (1955–72) until 1971, when longtime assistant conductor and chorus master Charles Rosekrans was named. Later music directors/principal conductors include Chris Nance (1974–77), John DeMain (1977–94), and Vjekoslav Šutej (1994–97). Patrick Summers has been the music director since 1998. With the 2019–20 season, Eun Sun Kim became principal guest conductor, the first female conductor ever to hold the post.

The Houston Grand Opera Chorus has been led since 1988 by chorus master Richard Bado, an alumnus of HGO&#x27;s young artist training program, the Houston Grand Opera Studio.

== Young Artist Training ==

=== Houston Grand Opera Studio ===
Houston Grand Opera&#x27;s young artist development program, the Houston Grand Opera Studio, was founded in 1977 to help young artists make the transition between their academic training and professional careers. The HGO Studio primarily trains young singers and pianist/coaches but has also trained aspiring conductors in a residency program of up to three years. An annual competition, now called the Eleanor McCollum Competition for Young Singers, was inaugurated in 1989 to help identify a pool of potential international artists for the Studio. Studio alumni include sopranos Jan Grissom, Marquita Lister, Ana María Martínez, Edrie Means, Erie Mills, Albina Shagimuratova, Heidi Stober, Rachel Willis-Sørensen, and Tamara Wilson; mezzo-sopranos Jamie Barton, Joyce DiDonato, Denyce Graves, Susanne Mentzer, and Marietta Simpson ; tenors Bruce Ford, Carroll Freeman and Norman Reinhardt; baritones Richard Paul Fink, and Scott Hendricks; bass-baritones Greer Grimsley, Ryan McKinny , and Eric Owens; and bass Eric Halfvarson. Other alumni include HGO Chorus Master Richard Bado, composer/conductor David Hanlon, former Lyric Opera of Kansas City Artistic Director Ward Holmquist, conductor/arranger/composer James Lowe, conductor/pianist Eric Melear, conductor Evan Rogister, and conductor/pianist Craig Terry.

=== Young Artists Vocal Academy ===
The HGO Young Artists Vocal Academy, established in 2011 and administered by the HGO Studio, is a one-week intensive program for undergraduate vocal music students. Participants selected for the program receive training that includes daily voice lessons and coachings as well as classes in characterization, movement, diction, and score preparation.

HGOco (see below) offers training to high school juniors and seniors.

== HGOco ==
In 2007, HGO established HGOco, an initiative designed to create partnerships between the company and the community. HGOco&#x27;s first project, the ongoing &quot;Song of Houston&quot; initiative&quot;,&quot; creates new works focused on people and groups in Houston—the most culturally diverse city in the United States, according to a report of the Kinder Institute for Urban Research and the Hobby Center for the Study of Texas.

For its first commissioned work in 2007, &quot;The Refuge,&quot; by Christopher Theofanidis and Leah Lax, HGOco identified seven statistically significant immigrant communities in Houston and the creators began interviewing residents of those communities. The libretto was created from the actual words of some of the residents, and the premiere included performances by members from these communities.

In 2009, HGOco received the Leading Lights Diversity Award in Arts and Culture from the National MultiCultural Institute (NCMI) for &quot;Song of Houston&quot;.

As of May 2018, HGOco has premiered 22 new works, including eight short chamber operas focusing on various Asian communities in Houston, which were commissioned and premiered during a four-year series titled &quot;East + West&quot;. Recent HGOco premieres include Laura Kaminsky and Mark Campbell/Kimberly Reed&#x27;s &quot;Some Light Emerges,&quot; about Houston philanthropist and humanitarian Dominique de Menil and her quest to create the Rothko Chapel; Gregory Spears and Royce Vavrek&#x27;s &quot;O Columbia,&quot; realized through the collaboration of Houston-based NASA astronauts, scientists, and engineers; and David Hanlon and Stephanie Fleischmann&#x27;s &quot;After the Storm,&quot; about the impact that Hurricane Ike and the Great Storm of 1900 had upon Galveston and the Gulf Coast. Song cycles have also been created in cooperation with workers in the Houston Ship Channel, the veterans community, and the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo.

HGOco also administers:

* Houston Grand Opera&#x27;s Bauer Family High School Voice Studio, a scholarship program for high school juniors and seniors preparing to study vocal music at the college/conservatory level
* Summer Opera Camps for students in Pre-K through grade 12.
* Opera to Go!, a touring company that focuses on short musical works for children and families.

== Houston Grand Opera and new works ==
HGO has been commissioning and premiering new works since 1974. These include full-length operas for the main stage and chamber works with a community focus or for children/families.

=== World premieres ===

==== Full-length operas ====
The relationship between HGO and composer Carlisle Floyd is the longest ongoing relationship of any composer with an organization. HGO has commissioned five works from Floyd: &quot;Bilby&#x27;s Doll&quot; (1976), &quot;Willie Stark&quot; (1981), &quot;The Passion of Jonathan Wade&quot; (new version, 1991), &quot;Cold Sassy Tree&quot; (2000), and &quot;Prince of Players&quot; (2016). Floyd lived in Houston for a two-decade period after relocating in 1976 from Tallahassee, Florida, to accept the M.D. Anderson Professorship at the University of Houston School of Music (now the Moores School of Music). In 1977, he cofounded the Houston Grand Opera Studio, HGO&#x27;s young artist training program, which was initially a joint program between HGO and the University of Houston, and was an active participant in training Studio artists.

The John Adams opera Nixon in China debuted at the Wortham Theater Center in 1987. It was co-commissioned by the Houston Grand Opera, the Brooklyn Academy of Music, Netherlands Opera and the Washington Opera.

==== Chamber operas ====
HGO has commissioned and premiered 15 chamber operas created for children/families. These chamber works are staged and are approximately 45 minutes long.

=== American premieres ===
HGO has presented seven American premieres. Among them, the most significant are the first staged version of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Rinaldo&quot; in 1975 (a concert version had been given in 1972 by the Handel Society of New York), starring Marilyn Horne in the title role and Samuel Ramey as Argante; Rossini&#x27;s &quot;La donna del lago&quot; in a new critical edition in 1981, and more recently, Weinberg&#x27;s &quot;The Passenger&quot;, a long-suppressed Holocaust opera composed in 1968 and performed by HGO in 2014. Besides presenting the American premiere in Houston, HGO was also invited to bring the production to the Park Avenue Armory as part of the 2014 Lincoln Center Festival.

=== Non-traditional opera ===
During the 2017–18 season, HGOco began a web-only series of 15-minute operas titled &quot;Star-Cross&#x27;d,&quot; based on true stories with a &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; theme. The series pilot, &quot;Boundless,&quot; by composer Avner Dorman and librettist Stephanie Fleischmann, was released online April 20, 2018. Two more episodes are scheduled for release during 2019.

In 2010, HGO commissioned and premiered the world&#x27;s first &quot;mariachi opera&quot;, composed by the late José &quot;Pepe&quot; Martínez, the longtime music director of the ensemble Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlán, with a libretto by Leonard Foglia. This work, titled &quot;Cruzar la Cara de la Luna/To Cross the Face of the Moon,&quot; has been performed at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris and by a number of opera companies in the United States.

In addition to commissioning and premiering new works, HGO has played a role in bringing certain existing works to the attention of the opera world. HGO presented a &quot;triumphant&quot; and &quot;groundbreaking&quot; production of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; in 1976 that restored portions of the work that had been cut for previous productions (including some made by composer George Gershwin himself for the New York premiere in 1935), thus allowing the public to experience the original vision for the work and making it clear that it was indeed an opera. After the Houston premiere, the production, featuring Donnie Ray Albert as Porgy and Clamma Dale as Bess and conducted by John DeMain, toured to Broadway and won a 1977 Tony Award for Most Innovative Production of a Revival. The complete recording won the 1977 Grammy Award for Best Opera Recording.

Scott Joplin&#x27;s &quot;Treemonisha&quot;, which comprises a variety of musical styles even though it is often called a &quot;ragtime opera,&quot; received its first fully staged performances at Houston Grand Opera in 1976 with a score HGO commissioned from ragtime expert Gunther Schuller. &quot;Treemonisha&quot; also toured to Broadway and was recorded.

== Houston Grand Opera and Innovation ==

=== Supertitles ===
In 1984, Houston Grand Opera began using supertitles on all non-English productions, becoming one of the first opera companies in the United States to do so.

=== Descriptive Services ===
HGO was one of the first opera companies in the United States (and possibly the first) to offer descriptive services for patrons with vision loss. It has offered descriptive services since the 1987–88 season, the inaugural season in the Wortham Theater Center. The service is offered free of charge and by request for any performance with 48 hours notice.

=== The Genevieve P. Demme Archives and Resource Center ===
In 1989, HGO became the first performing arts organization in Houston and the second major U.S. opera company to establish its own archives and resources center. The archives/resource center is named for the late Genevieve P. Demme, a longtime trustee and historian of Houston Grand Opera Association.

=== Plazacasts ===
On November 10, 1995, Houston Grand Opera became the first performing arts company in the United States to simulcast a live performance to an audience in another location. (The Royal Opera, Covent Garden, was the only other company at the time to have staged a similar event.) The performance of Rossini&#x27;s &quot;La Cenerentola&quot; featuring mezzo-soprano Cecilia Bartoli that was taking place inside the Wortham Theater Center&#x27;s Brown Theater was projected in real time onto a large screen mounted on the outside of the theater building. The event was free to the public. The audience was seated on the Ray C. Fish Plaza outside the theater, which prompted HGO to call the event a Plazacast. HGO held free public Plazacasts each year through the 2004–05 season (HGO&#x27;s 50th season). In April 2005, the company simulcast both a performance of Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and its 50th anniversary gala concert.

=== Multimedia Modular Stage ===
In May 1998, Houston Grand Opera unveiled its Multimedia Modular Stage, a large steel structure with moving lights, projection screens for live-feed video and still images, and a big sound system. It was designed for large outdoor venues but could be adapted for other locations. HGO used it several times for outdoor performances in Houston and on tour, and once for an indoor production of Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;A Little Night Music&quot; in 1999. Its last use in Houston was the night of June 8, 2001, in a production of &quot;Carmen&quot; at Houston&#x27;s Miller Outdoor Theatre. That night, Tropical Storm Allison struck Houston, where the storm&#x27;s worst flooding occurred. The two remaining performances in Houston were canceled, although the production went on tour as scheduled on June 15 and 16 to the Mann Center in Philadelphia. The effects of the storm, along with the impact of 9/11 and the collapse of Enron just months afterward, led to the retirement of the Multimedia Modular Stage, which was costly to assemble and disassemble.

=== OperaVision ===
In the fall of 2000, HGO devised and implemented a system of plasma and projection screens mounted in the Grand Tier and Balcony sections of the larger of the two halls in the Wortham Theater Center. This system—designed to provide close-up views of the action on stage and improve sightlines in the unusually steep Grand Tier and Balcony areas—was called OperaVision and received mixed appraisals from opera patrons. OperaVision was discontinued at the end of the 2004–05 season.
