<text>The Cisitalia Grand Prix is a single-seater car for the postwar 1.5-litre supercharged Grand Prix class, built by Italian sports car manufacturer Cisitalia and introduced in 1949. It was designed on behalf of Cisitalia by Porsche between 1946–47, and is therefore also known by its Porsche project number, Type 360.

An extremely advanced design, it proved too complex to build for the small Italian firm—leading to a lengthy development and eventually to the financial downfall of the company. Between Cisitalia&#x27;s 1949 liquidation and the fact that supercharged engines were banned for the 1952 Formula One season, the car never raced.

The &quot;Type 360&quot; is also noticeable for using an early form of sequential manual transmission, and was one of the first race cars to do so.

==History==
The car was commissioned by Piero Dusio in 1946. Dusio paid a large sum of money upfront, part of which was used to free Ferdinand Porsche from the French prison in which he was being held effectively for ransom. Dusio gave Porsche only 16 months to complete the car which proved too short a time to sort out the advanced design.

==Design==
The Dr. Porsche designed unraced 1939 1,482.56 cc (53.0 x 56.0 mm) 2-stage Roots supercharged flat-12 Auto-Union had been projected to deliver at 9,000 rpm. This provided the basis of the Cisitalia 360 car which was built in Italy by Cisitalia personnel with help from former Porsche employee Robert Eberan von Eberhorst around a mid mounted supercharged 1,492.58 cc (56.0 x 50.5 mm) flat 12 engine giving a conservative at 8,500 rpm and a top speed of . A fully enclosed streamlined body for fast circuits was planned giving over . Later bench tests showed about at 10,500 rpm. The chassis was of chromoly tubing and featured on/off four-wheel-drive with a sequential gear-shift and a rear-mounted transaxle also sending power through a driveshaft to a front differential. Suspension was independent with Porsche type trailing arms in front and parallel acting arms in the rear. Porsche&#x27;s experience with the pre-war Auto Union Grand Prix cars showed through in the layout and design of the Cisitalia to the extent that it has been referred to as the &quot;E-Type&quot;.

==Legacy==
By the time the only prototype was finished Dusio was out of cash. The car languished in development until 1951, at one point being shipped off to Argentina to try to persuade president Juan Perón to invest in the company. By 1952 Formula One rules had changed and while Dusio attempted to source a 2-liter motor for the car a lack of funds relegated one of the most advanced Grand Prix cars of its day to a few Formula Libre events and quick retirement. The car is currently on display in the Porsche Museum in Stuttgart.

<text>St Andrews Links in the town of St Andrews, Fife, Scotland, is regarded as the &quot;Home of Golf&quot;. It has one of the oldest courses in the world, where the game has been played since the 15th century. Today there are seven public golf courses: the Balgove, Eden, Jubilee, Strathtyrum, New, and the Old Course all on the links, and The Castle Course, a mile to the east of the town. The famous Old Course is widely considered one of the finest courses in the world. The courses of St Andrews Links are owned by the local authorities and operated by St Andrews Links Trust, a charitable organization. 

In general, St Andrews is a popular hub for golf tourism, as there is a high density of links and heathland courses in the area. In addition to the public courses there are two courses at the privately owned Fairmont Hotel (Torrance and Kittocks) to the south of the town; and the Duke&#x27;s and Drumoig, both inland parkland courses to the west. A few miles further South are the modern links of Kingsbarns and the traditional Balcomie links at Crail. Also nearby are the courses at Elie, Lundin, Leven, Scotscraig and Anstruther. Within 45 minutes drive are Monifieth, Carnoustie and Panmure.

St Andrews is also home to The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews, one of the most prestigious golf clubs and, until 2004, one of the two rule-making authorities of golf.

==History==

The history of St Andrews Links goes back to 1552 when John Hamilton was granted a charter to establish a rabbit warren to the north of the links. The St Andrews Links Charter refers to the public ownership of the links and the right of the people of St Andrews to play golf and other games. The right to play golf on the links were subsequently confirmed in local and royal charters.


The land was acquired by James Cheape, owner of the adjacent Strathtyrum estate, in 1821 and sold by his brother&#x27;s grandson, also named James Cheape, to the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews in 1893. Control of St Andrews Links was regulated by the St. Andrews Links Act 1894 and St. Andrews Links Order Confirmation Act 1974 which resulted in the creation of the St Andrews Links Trust.

==Public courses==

===Balgove Course===
The Balgove Course, named after the farm on which it was built, is a 1,520 yard, par 30, nine-hole course. It was originally opened in 1972 and remodeled in 1993.


===The Castle Course===
The Castle Course opened in June 2008, becoming the seventh public course at St Andrews. It is set on a rugged-cliff top a mile to the east of St Andrews with extensive views over the town, and was designed by the architect David McLay Kidd. The course is a par 71 and measures 6,759 yards from the back tees.


===Eden Course===
The Eden Course opened in 1914 after demand on the existing courses grew. It was designed by Harry Colt, and alterations in 1989 by Donald Steel maintain Colt&#x27;s standards. It was named after the Eden estuary by which it resides, as the profits from mussels collected there once made up an important part of the St Andrews economy.


===Jubilee Course===
The Jubilee Course is the third championship golf course at the Home of Golf. It was named after Queen Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee celebration in 1897.

Originally intended for Victorian dressed ladies, and other golf beginners, it has evolved into one of the hardest courses at St Andrews Links. The course is commonly used to test junior and amateur golfers for the British Mid-Amateur Golf Championship, as well as the St Andrews Links Trophy.

Initially a 12-hole course, it was expanded to 18 holes in 1905. The course has seen considerable developments under the management of Willie Auchterlonie, Donald Steel, David Wilson and Graeme Taylor. It now plays at around 6,745 yards, and is host to the St Andrews Links Trophy. The Jubilee is one of several courses in Scotland that are under threat from erosion.


===Strathtyrum Course===
The Strathtyrum Course, opened in July 1993, became the first new 18 hole layout at St Andrews in nearly 80 years. It was built on land that was previously part of the Strathtyrum estate and sold to the St Andrews Links Trust by Mrs Gladys Cheape in 1986.


===Old Course===

The Old Course, believed to be the oldest golf course in the world, dates back more than 600 years.



===New Course===
The New Course, located adjacent to the Old Course, was paid for and commissioned by the Royal and Ancient Golf Club who asked Old Tom Morris to be designer. The New Course opened for play in 1895.

<text>The domain name gov is a sponsored top-level domain (sTLD) in the Domain Name System of the Internet. The name is derived from the word &quot;government&quot;, indicating its restricted use by government entities. The TLD is administered by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), a component of the United States Department of Homeland Security.

.gov is one of the original six top-level domains, defined in RFC 920. Though &quot;originally intended for any kind of government office or agency&quot;, only U.S.-based government entities may register .gov domain names, a result of the Internet originating as a U.S. government-sponsored research network. 

Other countries typically delegate a second-level domain for government operations on their country-code top-level domain (ccTLD); for example, .gov.uk is the domain for the Government of the United Kingdom, and .gc.ca is the domain for the Government of Canada. The United States is the only country that has a government-specific top-level domain in addition to its ccTLD (.us), a direct result of the United States federal government&#x27;s role in the creation of the Internet.

.gov domains are registered at get.gov.

==History==
 is one of the original top-level domains created in 1984 (the other five being , , , , and ). The first site registered was in June 1985.

Beginning in 1997, the General Services Administration (GSA) began administering .gov. In February 2011, the GSA selected Verisign to manage the registry services, replacing Native Technologies, Inc. 

Responsibility for the TLD was transferred to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) under the DOTGOV Online Trust in Government Act of 2020, part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021. 

In January 2023, CISA selected Cloudflare to replace Verisign in providing registry services. Cloudflare will also provide authoritative DNS services for the .gov domain.

==Use==
Many governments in the United States use a .gov domain, though most use .us (e.g., leg.state.nv.us), .com (e.g., myflorida.com), .org (e.g., lacity.org), or other TLDs (e.g., senate.mn). The full list of registered .gov domains is published at get.gov/data.

During GSA&#x27;s administration of .gov, registration and annual renewal fees peaked at $400 per year. When CISA began managing the TLD in April 2021, all fees were removed.

Federal Executive branch policy requires the use of .gov for civilian agencies, but some U.S. government-related websites use non-.gov domain names, including the United States Postal Service (e.g., usps.com) and various recruiting websites for armed services (e.g., goarmy.com). The United States Department of Defense and its subsidiary organizations typically use the .mil sTLD instead of .gov.

==Eligibility==
U.S.-based government organizations and publicly controlled entities are eligible to obtain a .gov domain. This includes federal, state, local, or territorial government, as well as any tribal government recognized by the federal government or a state government. 

To register a .gov domain, an authorization letter must be submitted to CISA. The signer of the letter differs by entity type, but it is typically an agency&#x27;s head, chief information officer (CIO), or highest-ranking or elected official.

Historically, only U.S. federal government agencies were allowed to register a .gov domain. In May 2002, GSA proposed a change that would open registration to state, local, and tribal governments in the U.S., a change that went into effect in March 2003.

In November 2019, before the transfer of .gov to CISA, GSA&#x27;s authorization process was shown to be weak after someone impersonated the mayor of Exeter, Rhode Island in an authorization letter and successfully gained control of exeterri.gov. In response, GSA said it had implemented additional fraud prevention controls, and CISA advocated for transferring the TLD from GSA.

==Policy==
The DOTGOV Act requires that CISA maintain requirements that “minimize the risk of .gov internet domains whose names could mislead or confuse users”. These include:

* Requested names must correspond with the requesting entity&#x27;s organization&#x27;s name or services.
* Generic terms are reserved for federal agencies, though generic words can be combined with state or local municipality names.
* Most non-federal domain types require a two-letter United States postal abbreviations or state name equivalent, though exceptions are made. Rules have been established for municipalities whose names are unique, who are well-known, or that are among the most populous cities and counties in the nation.

The Act also requires that .gov domains not be used for political campaign or commercial purposes, and that domains are registered only by authorized individuals.

.gov has been used to serve certain policy goals. As an action following Executive Order 13571, President Barack Obama restricted executive branch agencies from registering new .gov domains in an attempt to eliminate unnecessary, redundant, or outdated sites. US government agencies used the .gov registrar to make it easy for new registrants to opt-in to HTTPS preloading and to make it easier for the public to report potential security issues.

==Use by states and territories==
, all states, the District of Columbia, and all territories except for the Northern Mariana Islands have operational domains in &quot;gov&quot;:
==International equivalents==
While the use of &quot;gov&quot; as a top-level domain is restricted to the United States, several other countries have second-level domains of the same name or similar semantics for governmental purposes, including the following. Note that the governments of some jurisdictions use alternate domains in public communications (for example, the Government of Canada adopted &quot;canada.ca&quot; as its main public-facing URL in the 2010s, and some Canadian provinces have made similar changes).

<text>The Porsche 550 is a racing sports car produced by Porsche from 1953 until 1956. In that time only 90 Porsche 550s were produced, and they quickly established dominance in the 1.1- and 1.5- liter classes. The Porsche 550 is a mid-engine car with an air-cooled four-cylinder engine, following the precedent of the 1948 Porsche 356/1 prototype designed by Ferry Porsche.  The mid-engine racing design was further developed with Porsche&#x27;s 718 model; its advantages led to it becoming the dominant design for top-level racing cars by the mid-1960s. 

The Porsche 550 has a solid racing history; it won the Nürburgring Eifel Race in May 1953, the first race it entered. The 550 Spyder usually finished in the top three in its class. Each Spyder was designed and customized to be raced.

A 1958 Porsche 550A Spyder sold at auction in 2018 by Bonhams for $5,170,000 (£4,115,763); it was the highest price for a 550 at auction.

== Engine and transmission ==

The Type 550/550 A is powered by an all aluminium (85 x 66 mm) naturally aspirated air-cooled 4 cylinder boxer engine known as the &quot;Fuhrmann Engine&quot; (Type 547). Its valvetrain uses double overhead camshafts on each cylinder bank, driven by vertical shafts, actuating 2 valves per cylinder. The engine is equipped with twin 2-barrel Solex 40 PII sandcasted carburetors and dual ignition. In its first version it produced at 6200 rpm and a maximum torque of at 5000 rpm.

The engine of the 550 is mounted in front of the rear axle making it mid-engined. This gives it a more balanced weight distribution, and allows for largely neutral handling. On the other hand, the low mass moment of inertia about the vehicle&#x27;s vertical axis can lead to a sudden, difficult to control rotation of the car. Ferdinand Porsche had pioneered this design layout with the Auto Union Grand Prix car of the 1930s. 

The first 550 had a fully synchronized 4-speed gearbox. Starting in 1956, a 5-speed gearbox was used, but its first gear only had to start and (like the reverse gear) had to be placed over a barrier and not synchronized. Excessive slip to the drive wheels in corners was prevented by a limited slip differential.

== History ==


Inspired by the Porsche 356 which was created by Ferry Porsche, as well as Spyder prototypes built and raced by Walter Glöckler starting in 1951, the factory decided to build a car designed for use in auto racing. The Porsche 550 Spyder was introduced at the 1953 Paris Auto Show. The 550 was very low to the ground, in order to be efficient for racing. In fact, former German Formula One racer Hans Herrmann drove it under closed railroad crossing gates during the 1954 Mille Miglia.

=== Racing history ===
The first three hand-built prototypes came in a coupé with a removable hardtop. The first (550-03) raced as a roadster at the Nurburgring Eifel Race in May 1953 winning its first race. Later that year the 550 took class wins in the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the Carrera Panamericana; the Carrera Panamericana win was commemorated with the &quot;Carrera&quot; branding for later Porsches with performance options. From 1953 to 1957, the Porsche works team evolved and raced the 550 with outstanding success and was recognized wherever it appeared. The silver &quot;Werke&quot; cars were painted with spears of different colors on the rear fenders to aid recognition from the pits. Hans Herrmann’s particularly famous ‘red-tail’ car No 41 went from victory to victory. For such a limited number of 90 prototype and customer builds, the 550 Spyder was always in a winning position, usually finishing in the top three results in its class. During its tenure with the works team it was challenged only twice among the smaller cars at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, with a 1.5-liter OSCA MT4 finishing ahead but disqualified in the 1954 race and a 1.1 liter Lotus Eleven trailing the 1.5 liter winning 550 by one lap in the 1957 race. The 1956 version, the 550A with a lighter and more rigid spaceframe chassis, gave Porsche its first overall win in a major sports car racing event, the 1956 Targa Florio. During this era Porsche was the first car manufacturer to get race sponsorship, which was through Fletcher Aviation, who Porsche was working with to design a light aircraft engine and later Telefunken and Castrol. 

The 550 was also raced by privateers, who kept the type in competition after the works team had moved on to the 718 in 1957. The 550 was both a road and track car and it was common for privateers to drive it to the race track, race it, then drive it home. One 550 was purchased by Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito for Milivoje Božić, with which he finished third in the 1000-km Supercortemaggiore Grand Prix at Monza Circuit with only one set of tyres in 1958 before winning his class in the 1960 European Hill Climb Championship; the car was sold to Prada in 1961.

Each Spyder was assigned a number for the race and had gumballs positioned on doors, front and rear, to be seen from any angle. On some 550s owned by privateers, a crude hand written number scrawled in house paint usually served the purpose. Cars with high numbers assigned such as 351, raced in the 1000 mile Mille Miglia, where the number represented the start time of 3.51am. On most occasions, numbers on each Spyder would change for each race entered, which today helps identify each 550 by chassis number and driver in period black and white photos.

Its successor from 1957 onwards, the Porsche 718, commonly known as the RSK was even more successful. The Spyder variations continued through the early 1960s, the RS 60 and RS 61. The Porsche Boxster S 550 Spyder is a modern mid-engined sports car that pays tribute to the 550; the Spyder name was effectively resurrected with the RS Spyder Le Mans Prototype.

===James Dean&#x27;s 550===

One of the first 90 Porsche 550s built was James Dean&#x27;s, numbered 130 (VIN 550-0055), which was involved in a collision at the CA Rte. 46/41 Cholame Junction on September 30, 1955, resulting in Dean&#x27;s death.

As Dean was finishing up &quot;Giant&quot;&#x27;s filming in September 1955, he suddenly traded in his 356 Porsche Super Speedster at Competition Motors, for a new 1955 Porsche 550 Spyder on September 21, and immediately entered the upcoming Salinas Road Race event scheduled for October 1 and 2.

A contemporary of Dean, the rising actor Tom Pittman also died prematurely when he crashed his Spyder over a cliff in 1958.

<text>The Porsche Typ 754 T7, also known as the T7 Prototype or 695, is a prototype automobile built by Porsche in 1961. It would later become the Porsche 911. The front end is very similar to the 911, but the rear is somewhat different. Also, unlike the 911, the T7 had four seats. The T7 was developed from the Porsche 356 by Ferdinand Alexander Porsche, and has a wheelbase that is longer (up to longer in early designs). It has a top speed of .

<doc id="387403" wikidata="Q600499" url="?curid=387403" title="Nonsense">
<text>Nonsense is a form of communication, via speech, writing, or any other symbolic system, that lacks any coherent meaning. In ordinary usage, nonsense is sometimes synonymous with absurdity or the ridiculous. Many poets, novelists and songwriters have used nonsense in their works, often creating entire works using it for reasons ranging from pure comic amusement or satire, to illustrating a point about language or reasoning. In the philosophy of language and philosophy of science, nonsense is distinguished from sense or meaningfulness, and attempts have been made to come up with a coherent and consistent method of distinguishing sense from nonsense. It is also an important field of study in cryptography regarding separating a signal from noise.

== Literary ==

The phrase &quot;Colorless green ideas sleep furiously&quot; was coined by Noam Chomsky as an example of nonsense. However, this can easily be confused with poetic symbolism. The individual &quot;words&quot; make sense and are arranged according to proper grammatical rules, yet the result is nonsense. The inspiration for this attempt at creating verbal nonsense came from the idea of contradiction and seemingly irrelevant and/or incompatible characteristics, which conspire to make the phrase meaningless, but are open to interpretation. The phrase &quot;the square root of Tuesday&quot; operates on the latter principle. This principle is behind the inscrutability of the &quot;kōan&quot; &quot;What is the sound of one hand clapping?&quot;, where one hand would presumably be insufficient for clapping without the intervention of another. [Editor’s note: It is possible to imagine a context where case-sensitive word-strings such as “Colorless green ideas sleep furiously” could be meaningfully used as a passphrase to decrypt a digital file. This one counterfactual suggests that both literary meaning and nonsense are dependent upon the particular “language-game” in which words (or characters) are used or misused. (See Wittgenstein’s &quot;Philosophical Investigations,&quot; §23&quot;.&quot;]

=== Verse ===
&quot;Jabberwocky&quot;, a poem (of nonsense verse) found in &quot;Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There&quot; by Lewis Carroll (1871), is a nonsense poem written in the English language. The word &quot;jabberwocky&quot; is also occasionally used as a synonym of nonsense.
Nonsense verse is the verse form of literary nonsense, a genre that can manifest in many other ways. Its best-known exponent is Edward Lear, author of &quot;The Owl and the Pussycat&quot; and hundreds of limericks.

Nonsense verse is part of a long line of tradition predating Lear: the nursery rhyme &quot;Hey Diddle Diddle&quot; could also be termed a nonsense verse. There are also some works which &quot;appear&quot; to be nonsense verse, but actually are not, such as the popular 1940s song Mairzy Doats.

Lewis Carroll, seeking a nonsense riddle, once posed the question &quot;How is a raven like a writing desk?&quot;. Someone answered him, &quot;Because Poe wrote on both&quot;. However, there are other possible answers (e.g. &quot;both have inky quills&quot;).

== Philosophy of language and of science ==

In the philosophy of language and the philosophy of science, nonsense refers to a lack of sense or meaning. Different technical definitions of meaning delineate sense from nonsense.

=== Logical positivism ===
=== Wittgenstein ===

In Ludwig Wittgenstein&#x27;s writings, the word &quot;nonsense&quot; carries a special technical meaning which differs significantly from the normal use of the word. In this sense, &quot;nonsense&quot; does not refer to meaningless gibberish, but rather to the lack of sense in the context of sense and reference. In this context, logical tautologies, and purely mathematical propositions may be regarded as &quot;nonsense&quot;. For example, &quot;1+1=2&quot; is a nonsensical proposition. Wittgenstein wrote in Tractatus Logico Philosophicus that some of the propositions contained in his own book should be regarded as nonsense. Used in this way, &quot;nonsense&quot; does not necessarily carry negative connotations.

=== Disguised Epistemic Nonsense ===
In Ludwig Wittgenstein’s later work, Philosophical Investigations (PI §464), he says that “My aim is: to teach you to pass from a piece of disguised nonsense to something that is patent nonsense.” In his remarks On Certainty (OC), he considers G. E. Moore’s “Proof of an External World” as an example of disguised epistemic nonsense. Moore’s “proof” is essentially an attempt to assert the truth of the sentence ‘Here is one hand’ as a paradigm case of genuine knowledge. He does this during a lecture before The British Academy where the existence of his hand is so obvious as to appear indubitable. If Moore does indeed &quot;know&quot; that he has a hand, then philosophical skepticism (formerly called idealism) must be false. (cf. Schönbaumsfeld (2020). 

Wittgenstein however shows that Moore’s attempt fails because his proof tries to solve a pseudo-problem that is patently nonsensical. Moore mistakenly assumes that syntactically correct sentences are meaningful regardless of how one uses them. In Wittgenstein’s view, linguistic meaning for the most part is the way sentences are used in various contexts to accomplish certain goals (PI §43). J. L. Austin likewise notes that &quot;It is, of course, not really correct that a sentence ever &quot;is&quot; a statement: rather, it is &quot;used&quot; in &quot;making a statement&quot;, and the statement itself is a &#x27;logical construction&#x27; out of the makings of statements&quot; (Austin 1962, p1, note1). Disguised epistemic nonsense therefore is the &quot;misuse&quot; of ordinary declarative sentences in philosophical contexts where they seem meaningful but produce little or nothing of significance (cf. Contextualism). Moore’s unintentional misuse of ‘Here is one hand’ thus fails to state anything that his audience could possibly understand in the context of his lecture.

According to Wittgenstein, such propositional sentences instead express fundamental beliefs that function as non-cognitive “hinges”. Such hinges establish the rules by which the language-game of doubt and certainty is played. Wittgenstein points out that “If I want the door to turn the hinges must stay put” (OC §341-343).[6] In a 1968 article titled “Pretence”, Robert Caldwell states that: “A general doubt is simply a groundless one, for it fails to respect the conceptual structure of the practice in which doubt is sometimes legitimate” (Caldwell 1968, p49). &quot;If you are not certain of any fact,&quot; Wittgenstein notes, &quot;you cannot be certain of the meaning of your words either&quot; (OC §114). Truth-functionally speaking, Moore’s attempted assertion and the skeptic’s denial are epistemically useless. &quot;Neither the question nor the assertion makes sense&quot; (OC §10). In other words, both philosophical realism and its negation, philosophical skepticism, are nonsense (OC §37&amp;58). Both bogus theories violate the rules of the epistemic game that make genuine doubt and certainty meaningful. Caldwell concludes that: “The concepts of certainty and doubt apply to our judgments only when the sense of what we judge is firmly established” (Caldwell, p57). 

The broader implication is that classical philosophical “problems” may be little more than complicated semantic illusions that are empirically unsolvable (cf. Schönbaumsfeld 2016). They arise when semantically correct sentences are misused in epistemic contexts thus creating the illusion of meaning. With some mental effort however, they can be dissolved in such a way that a rational person can justifiably ignore them. According to Wittgenstein, &quot;It is not our aim to refine or complete the system of rules for the use of our words in unheard-of ways. For the clarity that we are aiming at is indeed complete clarity. But this simply means that the philosophical problems should completely disappear&quot; (PI §133). The net effect is to expose a “A whole cloud of philosophy condensed into a drop of grammar” (PI p222).

In contrast to the above Wittgensteinian approach to nonsense, Cornman, Lehrer and Pappas argue in their textbook, &quot;Philosophical Problems and Arguments: An Introduction&quot; (PP&amp;A) that philosophical skepticism is perfectly meaningful in the semantic sense. It is only in the epistemic sense that it seems nonsensical. For example, the sentence ‘Worms integrate the moon by C# when moralizing to rescind apples’ is neither true nor false and therefore is semantic nonsense. Epistemic nonsense, however, is perfectly grammatical and semantical. It just &quot;appears&quot; to be preposterously false. When the skeptic boldly asserts the sentence [x]: ‘We know nothing whatsoever’ then:

“It is not that the sentence asserts nothing; on the contrary, it is because the sentence asserts something [that seems] patently false…. The sentence uttered is perfectly meaningful; what is nonsensical and meaningless is the fact that the person [a skeptic] has uttered it. To put the matter another way, we can make sense of the sentence [x]; we know what it asserts. But we cannot make sense of the man uttering it; we do not understand why he would utter it. Thus, when we use terms like ‘nonsense’ and ‘meaningless’ in the epistemic sense, the correct use of them requires only that what is uttered seem absurdly false. Of course, to seem preposterously false, the sentence must assert something, and thus be either true or false.” (PP&amp;A, 60).

Keith Lehrer makes a similar argument in part VI of his monograph, “Why Not Scepticism?” (WNS 1971). A Wittgensteinian, however, might respond that Lehrer and Moore make the same mistake. Both assume that it is the sentence [x] that is doing the “asserting”, not just the philosopher’s misuse of it in the wrong context. &quot;Both&quot; Moore’s attempted “assertion” &quot;and&quot; the skeptic’s “denial” of ‘Here is one hand’ in the context of the British Academy are preposterous. Therefore, both claims are epistemic nonsense disguised in meaningful syntax. “[T]he mistake here” according to Caldwell, “lies in thinking that [epistemic] criteria provide us with certainty when they actually provide sense” (Caldwell p53). No one, including philosophers, has special dispensation from committing this semantic fallacy.

“The real discovery,” according to Wittgenstein, “is the one that makes me capable of stopping doing philosophy when I want to.—The one that gives philosophy peace, so that it is no longer tormented by questions which bring itself in question…. There is not &quot;a&quot; philosophical method, though there are indeed  methods, like different therapies” (PI §133). He goes on to say that “The philosopher&#x27;s  treatment of a question is like the treatment of an illness” (PI §255).

=== Leonardo Vittorio Arena ===
Starting from Wittgenstein, but through an original perspective, the Italian philosopher Leonardo Vittorio Arena, in his book &quot;Nonsense as the meaning&quot;, highlights this positive meaning of nonsense to undermine every philosophical conception which does not take note of the absolute lack of meaning of the world and life. Nonsense implies the destruction of all views or opinions, on the wake of the Indian Buddhist philosopher Nagarjuna. In the name of nonsense, it is finally refused the conception of duality and the Aristotelian formal logic.

==Cryptography==
The problem of distinguishing sense from nonsense is important in cryptography and other intelligence fields. For example, they need to distinguish signal from noise. Cryptanalysts have devised algorithms to determine whether a given text is in fact nonsense or not. These algorithms typically analyze the presence of repetitions and redundancy in a text; in meaningful texts, certain frequently used words recur, for example, &quot;the&quot;, &quot;is&quot; and &quot;and&quot; in a text in the English language. A random scattering of letters, punctuation marks and spaces do not exhibit these regularities. Zipf&#x27;s law attempts to state this analysis mathematically. By contrast, cryptographers typically seek to make their cipher texts resemble random distributions, to avoid telltale repetitions and patterns which may give an opening for cryptanalysis.

It is harder for cryptographers to deal with the presence or absence of meaning in a text in which the level of redundancy and repetition is &quot;higher&quot; than found in natural languages (for example, in the mysterious text of the Voynich manuscript).

== Teaching machines to talk nonsense ==

Scientists have attempted to teach machines to produce nonsense. The Markov chain technique is one method which has been used to generate texts by algorithm and randomizing techniques that seem meaningful. Another method is sometimes called the &quot;Mad Libs&quot; method: it involves creating templates for various sentence structures and filling in the blanks with noun phrases or verb phrases; these phrase-generation procedures can be looped to add recursion, giving the output the appearance of greater complexity and sophistication. Racter was a computer program which generated nonsense texts by this method; however, Racter&#x27;s book, &quot;The Policeman’s Beard is Half Constructed&quot;, proved to have been the product of heavy human editing of the program&#x27;s output.

==Notes==
 6. A new branch of philosophy called “hinge epistemology” has sprouted from Wittgenstein’s remarks &quot;On Certainty&quot;. See Duncan Pritchard, Crispin Wright, Daniele Moyal-Sharrock, &quot;et al&quot;. Whether Wittgenstein would have agreed with their interpretations of his work is debatable.

<text>The Porsche 718 is a series of one- or two-seat sports-racing cars built by Porsche from 1957 to 1962. An open-wheel single-seat model was developed for Formula racing.

==Details==
The 718 was a development of the successful Porsche 550A with improvements made to the body work and suspension. The car&#x27;s full name is 718 RSK, where &quot;RS&quot; stands for &quot;RennSport&quot; (sports-racing) and the &quot;K&quot; reflects the shape of the car&#x27;s revised torsion-bar suspension. It had a mid-engined layout and used the 1.5-litre Type 547/3 quad-cam engine introduced in the 550A.

==Variations==
===718 RSK Mittellenker===
In 1957 the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA) changed their rules to allow cars with enveloping bodywork to compete in Formula races. That year Porsche entered three 550/1500RS Spyders in the German Grand Prix Formula Two (F2) event. Changes to the cars were minimal, being limited to removing the passenger seats and spare tires.

For 1958 Porsche fielded a modified 718, called the RSK Mittellenker (centre-steer), for F2 events. The bodywork for this car was only slightly different from the sportscar model, but the single seat was now in the centre of the cockpit, with the steering wheel, pedals, and shift lever relocated to accommodate the change and a fairing enclosing more of the cockpit opening. Jean Behra drove the car to a win at the F2 event at Reims that year. At the German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring, driver Edgar Barth placed sixth overall and second in his class. At the Berlin Grand Prix at AVUS the car won both its heat and the F2 class in the hands of driver Masten Gregory.

===718/2===

In 1959 Porsche unveiled the prototype of a narrow, open-wheeled car called the Porsche 718/2 that married the 718&#x27;s mechanicals with a more traditional single-seat Formula body. The unpainted car was entered in the 1959 Monaco Grand Prix, where driver Wolfgang von Trips qualified twelfth, but crashed on the second lap of the race. At Reims driver Joakim Bonnier finished third. For 1960 the production 718/2, starting with chassis number 718201, received revised bodywork, a 6-speed transaxle, and a wheelbase extended by . A total of five cars were built. Some of these four-cylinder cars were later raced in F1 under the 1962 1 litre formula.

In October 1958 the FIA had announced another change to the regulations for Formula One (F1). Beginning in the 1961 season, engine capacity would be limited to the same 1.5 litres as in Formula Two. This meant that Porsche could use their 718/2s almost unchanged in F1.

===RS 60===
For the 1960 season the FIA made changes to the regulation regarding the windscreen and cockpit size. These rules changes together with a larger (1.6-litre) Type 547/3 engine, developing and a new double wishbone rear suspension brought about the RS 60 model. The RS 60 brought Porsche victory at the 1960 12 Hours of Sebring with a car driven by Hans Herrmann and Olivier Gendebien. 1960 also saw Porsche win the Targa Florio with Hans Herrmann being joined on the winner podium by Jo Bonnier and Graham Hill. The RS 60 also ensured that Porsche successfully defended their European Hill Climb Championship for the third year in a row.

===RS 61===
For 1961 the model name was changed to &quot;RS 61&quot; although it was almost identical to the RS 60. An RS 61 won the European Hill Climb Championship.

===W-RS===
The W-RS version was developed in 1961. Initially fitted with a 4-cylinder engine, the car was later fitted with Porsche&#x27;s air-cooled Type 771 2.0 L flat-eight engine which produced . A W-RS finished 8th at Le Mans in 1963. The W-RS continued Porsche&#x27;s success in the European Hill Climb Championship with Edgar Barth claiming the title in 1963. Porsche would go on to win a European Hill Climb Championship every year until 1982, a total of 42 titles.

The W-RS continued racing until 1964 when it was replaced by the 904.

===718 GTR Coupé===

A Coupé version was developed from the RS 61. Initially fitted with a 4-cylinder engine, this car was also upgraded to an 8-cylinder F1 derived engine which produced . The car was also fitted with disc brakes. A GTR Coupé enabled drivers Jo Bonnier and Carlo Maria Abate to win the Targa Florio in 1963 once more.

==Racing history==
===Endurance / sportscar racing===
The 718 made its racing debut at the 1957 24 Hours of Le Mans driven by Umberto Maglioli and Edgar Barth. The car failed to finish the race due to an accident.

In 1958, the RSK Spyder #29 (1.6-litre engine) finished third overall at Le Mans guided by Jean Behra and Hans Herrmann. Right after them, in fourth place overall and first in class came the RSK #31 (1.5-litre engine), piloted by Edgar Barth and Paul Frère. Jean Behra also drove one of the cars home finishing second at the Targa Florio (an FIA World Sportscar Championship race from 1955–1973). 

In 1959, the car, driven by Edgar Barth and Wolfgang Seidel, achieved overall victory at the Targa Florio for its first time. A 718 also won the European Hill Climb Championship in both 1958 and 1959. A 718 RS60 won the Targa Florio again in 1960.

In 1961 Masten Gregory and Bob Holbert piloted a 718/4 RS Spyder to a class win at Le Mans. In 1963, Porsche got another Targa Florio victory, with a 718 GTR Coupé, making it three wins at that event for a 718 car.

===Formula Two===
Porsche made their F2 debut with victories at Reims and AVUS in 1958. In 1959 other RSK&#x27;s were converted for single seater racing and at the XV B.A.R.C. &#x27;200&#x27; at Aintree in 1960 Porsche scored a 1–2–3 victory with Stirling Moss, Jo Bonnier and Graham Hill all in 718s. The feat was repeated again later in the year at the race at Zeltweg, Austria.

===Formula One===
Formula One switched to a 1.5-litre formula in 1961 and Porsche entered three 718s for Dan Gurney, Hans Herrmann and Jo Bonnier. Gurney scored three 2nd places (France, Italy and United States) taking him to 4th place in the Drivers&#x27; Championship. For 1962, Porsche entered a new car, the Porsche 804 in Formula One.

Carel Godin de Beaufort, a privateer, entered a 718 in F1 between 1961 and 1964. He was killed driving his 718 during practice for the 1964 German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring.

<text>Porsche 901 was the name originally intended for the Porsche 911.

By the early 1960s, Porsche project design numbers had reached into the 800s. For instance, Porsche&#x27;s 1962 F1 model was called Porsche 804.

At the Internationale Automobil-Ausstellung (Frankfurt Motor Show) in Frankfurt in September 1963, Porsche presented its successor to the Porsche 356 as the 901. It took several more months until the cars were manufactured for sale to customers. Between 14 September and 16 November 1964, 82 cars were built and the 901 was presented in October at the 1964 Paris Auto Salon. Officially the 901s already constructed were used for testing and for exhibitions, and Porsche sold none to private customers. Nevertheless, several of the cars retained by Porsche at that time appear to have made it to private ownership subsequently: in 1988 number 20 was discovered and completely restored by Kurt Schneider and his wife, Lori. In 2010, it was reported that car number 37 was owned by a Porsche specialist named Alois Ruf.

The 901 was renamed after French car maker Peugeot objected to Porsche using any three digit number where the middle number was 0, asserting ownership of the naming rights in key markets, and having already sold many models with that scheme. Porsche responded by simply replacing the middle 0 with a 1, calling the car the Porsche 911. This also affected other Porsche models, which were primarily intended for racing but also sold as road legal cars. In those cases, Porsche kept the internal part number of 90x, but used a unique name for marketing, selling the Porsche 904 as the Carrera GTS and the Porsche 906 as the Carrera 6. Porsche enthusiasts continue to refer to these cars by their three digit design numbers.

Later, Porsche introduced pure racing cars which were not sold for road use, and did not compete with any road-going Peugeot. These carried the design numbers Porsche 907, Porsche 908, and Porsche 909. Additionally, the 901 number is used among Porsche enthusiasts as shorthand to identify the aluminum five-speed transmission used in early 911s; the part number for these transmissions used an 11 digit code that began with 901 as did many other parts on the early cars. Later 911s from 1969 used a different magnesium case and a part number beginning with 911.

<doc id="387412" wikidata="Q19073411" url="?curid=387412" title="New York Times Co. v. Sullivan">
<text>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 (1964), was a landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision that ruled the freedom of speech protections in the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution limit the ability of a public official to sue for defamation. The decision held that if a plaintiff in a defamation lawsuit is a public official or candidate for public office, then not only must they prove the normal elements of defamationpublication of a false defamatory statement to a third partythey must also prove that the statement was made with &quot;actual malice&quot;, meaning the defendant either knew the statement was false or recklessly disregarded whether it might be false. &quot;New York Times Co. v. Sullivan&quot; is frequently ranked as one of the greatest Supreme Court decisions of the modern era.

The case began in 1960, when &quot;The New York Times&quot; published a full-page advertisement by supporters of Martin Luther King Jr. that criticized the police in Montgomery, Alabama, for their treatment of civil rights movement protesters. The ad had several factual errors regarding the number of times King had been arrested during the protests, what song the protesters had sung, and whether students had been expelled for participating. Based on the inaccuracies, Montgomery police commissioner L. B. Sullivan sued the &quot;Times&quot; for defamation in the local Alabama county court. After the judge ruled that the advertisement&#x27;s inaccuracies were defamatory &quot;per se&quot;, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Sullivan and awarded him $500,000 in damages. The &quot;Times&quot; appealed first to the Supreme Court of Alabama, which affirmed the verdict, and then to the U.S. Supreme Court.

In March 1964, the Supreme Court unanimously held that the Alabama court&#x27;s verdict violated the First Amendment. The Court reasoned that defending the principle of wide-open debate will inevitably include &quot;vehement, caustic, and... unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials.&quot; The Supreme Court&#x27;s decision, and its adoption of the actual malice standard for defamation cases by public officials, reduced the financial exposure from potential defamation claims and frustrated efforts by public officials to use these claims to suppress political criticism. The Supreme Court has since extended &quot;Sullivan&quot; higher legal standard for defamation to all &quot;public figures&quot;. This has made it extremely difficult for a public figure to win a defamation lawsuit in the United States.

==Background==
On March 29, 1960, &quot;The New York Times&quot; carried a full-page advertisement titled &quot;Heed Their Rising Voices&quot;, paid for by the Committee to Defend Martin Luther King and the Struggle for Freedom in the South. In the advertisement, the Committee solicited funds to defend Martin Luther King Jr., against an Alabama perjury indictment. The advertisement described actions against civil rights protesters, some of them inaccurately, some of which involved the police force of Montgomery, Alabama. Referring to Alabama &quot;official authority and police power&quot;, the advertisement stated: &quot;They have arrested [King] seven times. ... &quot;, whereas he had been arrested four times; and that &quot;truckloads of police ... ringed the Alabama State College Campus&quot; after the demonstration at the State Capitol, whereas the police had been &quot;deployed near&quot; the campus but had not actually &quot;ringed&quot; it and had not gone there in connection with the State Capitol demonstration. Although the Montgomery Public Safety commissioner, L. B. Sullivan, was not named in the advertisement, Sullivan argued that the inaccurate criticism of actions by the police was defamatory to him as well because it was his duty to supervise the police department.
Because Alabama law denied public officers recovery of punitive damages in a libel action on their official conduct unless they first made a written demand for a public retraction and the defendant failed or refused to comply, Sullivan sent such a request. The &quot;Times&quot; did not publish a retraction in response to the demand. Instead, its lawyers wrote a letter stating, among other things, that &quot;we ... are somewhat puzzled as to how you think the statements in any way reflect on you,&quot; and &quot;you might, if you desire, let us know in what respect you claim that the statements in the advertisement reflect on you.&quot;

Sullivan did not respond but instead filed a libel suit a few days later. He also sued four African-American ministers mentioned in the ad: Ralph Abernathy, S.S. Seay Sr., Fred Shuttlesworth, and Joseph Lowery.

The &quot;Times&quot; subsequently published a retraction of the advertisement upon the demand of Governor John Patterson of Alabama, who alleged the publication charged him with &quot;grave misconduct and ... improper actions and omissions as Governor of Alabama and &quot;ex officio&quot; chairman of the State Board of Education of Alabama.&quot; When asked to explain why there had been a retraction for the Governor but not for Sullivan, the Secretary of the &quot;Times&quot; testified:

We did that because we didn&#x27;t want anything that was published by the &quot;Times&quot; to be a reflection on the State of Alabama and the Governor was, as far as we could see, the embodiment of the State of Alabama and the proper representative of the state and we had by that time learned more of the facts which the ad purported to recite and, finally, the ad did refer to the action of the state authorities and the Board of Education presumably of which the Governor is the &quot;ex officio&quot; chairman ... 

However, the Secretary also testified he did not think that &quot;any of the languages in there referred to Mr. Sullivan.&quot;

The jury returned a verdict for Sullivan and awarded him $500,000 in damages . The state supreme court affirmed on August 30, 1962, saying &quot;The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution does not protect libelous publications&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; appealed to the United States Supreme Court.

Constitutional law scholar Herbert Wechsler successfully argued the case before the United States Supreme Court. Louis M. Loeb, a partner at the firm of Lord Day &amp; Lord who served as chief counsel to the &quot;Times&quot; from 1948 to 1967, was among the authors of the brief of the &quot;Times&quot;.

==Decision==
On March 9, 1964, the Supreme Court issued a unanimous 9–0 decision in favor of the &quot;Times&quot; that vacated the Alabama court&#x27;s judgment and limited newspapers&#x27; liability for damages in defamation suits by public officials.

===Opinion of the Court===

Justice William J. Brennan Jr. authored the Court&#x27;s opinion, and five other justices joined it. The Court began by explaining that the ability to criticize public government officials was at the core of the American rights to freedom of speech and freedom of the press protected by the First Amendment. 

The Court said that because of these core American free-speech principles, it would have to consider Sullivan&#x27;s defamation claims &quot;against the background of a profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open, and that it may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials.&quot;

With this background, the Court framed the case around the question of whether this American constitutional commitment to free speech required loosening traditional defamation laws.

In answer, the Court held that the free-speech protections of the First Amendment covered the &quot;Times&quot; advertisement despite its factual inaccuracies. The Court reasoned that &quot;erroneous statement is inevitable in free debate, and ... must be protected if the freedoms of expression are to have the breathing space that they need ... to survive&quot;. It concluded that the importance of safeguarding the &quot;breathing space&quot; created by the First Amendment&#x27;s protections required giving constitutional protection to &quot;erroneous statements honestly made&quot;. The Court analogized Alabama&#x27;s libel law to the infamous Alien and Sedition Acts passed in the 1790s during the presidency of John Adams. It reasoned that a broad interpretation of libel laws that protected government officials from criticism would produce situations similar to those under the Alien and Sedition Acts, which had been historically criticized.

Because of the importance of free debate about public officials, the Court held that it was not enough that Alabama&#x27;s libel law—like most libel laws in the English common law tradition—allowed defendants to use the truth of their defamatory statements as a defense. Instead, the Court held that under U.S. law, any public official suing for defamation must prove that the defendant made the defamatory statement with &quot;actual malice&quot;.

The Court said that besides proving &quot;actual malice&quot;, the First Amendment&#x27;s protections also imposed two other limitations on libel laws. First, a public official seeking damages must prove that the defendant&#x27;s defamatory statement was about the official individually, not about government policy generally. Second, unlike in traditional common law defamation lawsuits where the defendant had the burden to prove that his or her statement was true, in defamation suits involving American public officials the officials must prove that the defendant&#x27;s statement was false.

==International comparisons==
The rule that somebody alleging defamation should have to prove untruth, rather than that the defendant should have to prove the truth of a statement, stood as a departure from the previous common law. In England, the development was specifically rejected in &quot;Derbyshire County Council v. Times Newspapers Ltd&quot; and it was also rejected in Canada in &quot;Hill v. Church of Scientology of Toronto&quot; and more recently in &quot;Grant v. Torstar Corp&quot;. In Australia, the outcome of the case was followed in &quot;Theophanous v. The Herald &amp; Weekly Times Ltd&quot;, but &quot;Theophanous&quot; was itself overruled by the High Court of Australia in &quot;Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation&quot; (1997) 189 CLR 520.

==50th anniversary==
In 2014, on the 50th anniversary of the ruling, &quot;The New York Times&quot; released an editorial in which it stated the background of the case, laid out the rationale for the Supreme Court decision, critically reflected on the state of freedom of the press 50 years after the ruling and compared the state of freedom of the press in the United States with other nations. The editorial board of &quot;The New York Times&quot; heralded the &quot;Sullivan&quot; decision not only as a ruling which &quot;instantly changed libel law in the United States&quot;, but also as &quot;the clearest and most forceful defense of press freedom in American history.&quot; The board added:

In a 2015 &quot;Time&quot; magazine survey of over 50 law professors, both Owen Fiss (Yale) and Steven Shiffrin (Cornell) named &quot;New York Times v. Sullivan&quot; &quot;the best Supreme Court decision since 1960&quot;, with Fiss noting that the decision helped cement &quot;the free-speech traditions that have ensured the vibrancy of American democracy&quot; and Schiffrin remarking that the case &quot;overturned the censorial aspects of the law of libel and made it far easier in what’s left of our democracy for citizens—including the Fourth Estate—to criticize the powerful.&quot;

==Later developments==
*&quot;Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts&quot;, 388 U.S. 130 (1967) held that public figures who are not public officials may still sue news organizations if they disseminate information about them which is recklessly gathered and unchecked.
*&quot;Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.&quot;, 418 U.S. 323 (1974): Actual malice not necessary for defamation of private person if negligence is present.
* &quot;Time, Inc. v. Hill&quot;, 385 U.S. 374 (1967). Extension of actual malice standard to false light invasion of privacy tort.
*&quot;Hustler Magazine v. Falwell&quot;, 485 U.S. 46 (1988): Extending standard to intentional infliction of emotional distress.
*&quot;Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co.&quot;, 497 U.S. 1 (1990): Existing law is sufficient to protect free speech without recognizing opinion privilege against libel claims.

==Further developments==
The potential for reconsideration of the precedent of &quot;Sullivan&quot; were raised in the late 2010s and early 2020s. Leading into and during his first presidency from 2016 to 2020, Donald Trump called for changes in libel laws, taking issue with reporting from &quot;The New York Times&quot; and the content of Bob Woodward&#x27;s book, &quot;&quot; in 2018. 

Trump&#x27;s opinion was supported by Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas in various court opinions that followed. Thomas advocated reevaluating &quot;Sullivan&quot; in an opinion attached to the court&#x27;s 2019 denial to hear a libel case brought by Katherine McKee, one of the women that accused Bill Cosby of sexual assault. McKee claimed Cosby had leaked a letter that permanently damaged her reputation. Lower courts rejected her case based on &quot;Sullivan&quot;, stating that she &quot;thrust herself to the forefront of a public controversy&quot;, making her a limited public figure and requiring the higher standard of malice to be demonstrated. While Thomas wrote that the Court&#x27;s decision to deny certification of McKee&#x27;s appeal based on &quot;Sullivan&quot; was correct, he further said that &quot;Sullivan&quot; was made wrongly, and that &quot;If the Constitution does not require public figures to satisfy an actual-malice standard in state-law defamation suits, then neither should we&quot;. Thomas also repeated calls to review &quot;Sullivan&quot; in his dissent in &quot;Berisha v. Lawson&quot; in 2021 and in his dissent to the court&#x27;s denial to hear Don Blankenship&#x27;s appeal, in the latter saying that &quot;Sullivan&quot; allows news agencies to &quot;cast false aspersions on public figures with near impunity&quot;. Justice Neil Gorsuch also joined in Thomas in &quot;Berisha&quot; in expressing his concerns of how the media landscape had changed since &quot;Sullivan&quot;.

Federal judge Laurence Silberman called on the Supreme Court to overturn &quot;New York Times v. Sullivan&quot; in a March 2021 opinion, stating that the &quot;New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; are &quot;virtually Democratic Party broadsheets&quot;. Silberman&#x27;s dissent also accused big tech companies of censoring conservatives and warned that &quot;Democratic Party ideological control&quot; of mainstream media may be a prelude to an &quot;authoritarian or dictatorial regime&quot; that constitutes &quot;a threat to a viable democracy&quot;.

Las Vegas casino owner Steve Wynn had filed defamation lawsuits against the Associated Press in 2018, claiming that articles published by the agency that contained allegations related to Wynn and sexual assault in the 1970s. Wynn argued that the Associated Press had used actual malice in their reporting. The Nevada courts dismissed Wynn&#x27;s suit, arguing he had failed to show &quot;actual malice&quot; under the &quot;Sullivan&quot; decision. Wynn subsequently has petitioned the Supreme Court to hear his case in February 2025, asking them to overturn the &quot;actual malice&quot; standard of &quot;Sullivan&quot;.

On March 19, 2023, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published a story reviewing the original advertisement and the legal case.

<text>The Porsche 904 is an automobile which was produced by Porsche in Germany in 1964 and 1965. This coupe, manufactured from 1963 to 1965, was street-legal under road traffic laws, allowing it to be driven not only on race tracks but also on public roads.

The car was used by the factory team in the Sports Car World Championship from 1964 to 1966. Additionally, numerous private teams raced the Porsche 904 in these international series as well as in national championships, such as the German Automobile Circuit Championship, specifically in the 2-liter GT class.

The Porsche 904 achieved significant success, winning the 2-liter GT category in the Manufacturer&#x27;s World Championship in 1964 and 1965, and it also won the prototype class in 1964.

== History ==

After having withdrawn from Formula One at the end of the 1962 season, Porsche focused again on sportscar racing. The 904 debuted late in 1963, for the 1964 racing season, as a successor to the 718, which had been introduced in 1957. Porsche designed the GTS variant to compete in the FIA-GT class at various international racing events. The street-legal version debuted in 1964 in order to comply with group 3 appendix J homologation regulations requiring a minimum of 100 road-going variants be sold by the factory. Porsche produced one-hundred and six 904s at four or five a day with a list price of US$7245 (FOB Stuttgart). Orders far exceeded the one hundred car requirement to satisfy homologation rules and more cars could have been sold. The 904 marked the beginning of a series of sportscars that culminated in the dominant 917.

=== 904 Coupé (1963–1964) ===
==== Engine ====
The 904&#x27;s mid-engine layout was inherited from the 718, also known as the RSK (Rennsport = racing, kurz = short), the factory&#x27;s leading race car. It was powered by the Type 587/3, four-cam flat four-cylinder engine producing 180 hp, &quot;probably the most complex four-cylinder&quot; ever. It drove a five-speed transmission with a standard 4.428:1 final drive, with available 4.605, 4.260, 3.636, and 3.362 ratios.

Begun as the Type 547, its development began in 1953, when the previous VW-based flat-four, used in the contemporary 356 and rated at , hit the limit of its potential. Porsche realized it needed something all-new. The brainchild of Ernst Fuhrmann, later technical director, it was hoped to achieve an &quot;unheard of&quot; per , relying on hemispherical combustion chambers and -throat 46IDA2 two-choke Weber carburetors to generate from the four-cam engine. The 1.5 liter weighed dry, eventually producing . A complex design that proved &quot;very taxing&quot; to build and assemble, but very durable, it was used in 34 different models, including 550 spyders, 356 Carreras, and F2/1s.

==== Chassis ====
The 904 was the first Porsche to use a ladder chassis and fibreglass body, appearing more like a specialist racing car than the modified sports cars typical at the time, and was painted white. The fibreglass body was bonded to its steel chassis for extra rigidity, and achieved a drag coefficient of 0.34. While many German race cars had used unpainted aluminium bodies since the famous 1934 Silver Arrows, most 904s were painted silver, the modern German national racing color. Unusually for Porsche, the two-seater bodies were provided by contractors, which would later become standard practice among race car builders. The 904&#x27;s fibreglass body was made by spraying chopped fibreglass into a mold, the amount sprayed often varied in thickness over the shape of the car and as a result the weight of the various cars was somewhat inconsistent. Race-prepared four-cylinder 904s weighed in at approximately 1,443 pounds (655 kg) and the low weight gave the 904 the ability to accelerate to from a standstill in less than six seconds (using the standard rear gear, which was typical at Sebring) and to reach a top speed of (with the 3.362 ratio). Frontal area was only .

==== Suspension ====
The Porsche 904 rode on coil springs (the first Porsche not to use trailing arm front and swing axle rear suspension), with unequal-length A-arms in front. The wheelbase was , track front and rear , height , and ground clearance of on wheels. Brakes were discs at the front and at the rear.

==== 904/6 ====
To satisfy demand, forty 1965 models were produced, some featuring a variant of the 911&#x27;s flat-six. Due to the weight issues of the first generation plastic body, the 904&#x27;s successor, the 1966 906 or &quot;Carrera 6&quot;, was developed with a tubular space frame covered with an unstressed, lighter fiberglass body.
==== 904/8 ====

A few factory race cars were fitted with a flat eight-cylinder power plant derived from the 1962 804 F1 car, the Type 771, which used -throat downdraft Weber carburetors. The Type 771s, however, suffered a &quot;disturbing habit&quot; of making their flywheels explode.

=== 904 Bergspyder (1965) ===

==== Body ====
For the European Hill Climb Championship in 1965, Porsche developed a successor to the 1964 Porsche 718 RS 61 Spyder. The 904 Bergspyder, based on the Coupé 904/8, was given chassis numbers that began with the 906. Therefore, the car is also sometimes called the 906/8 Bergspyder, Although the race car was most commonly known as the 904 Bergspyder and was technically based on the 904 coupé.

From the coupé, the developers carried over the steel box frame and put on a light open plastic body. The Bergspyder was not a beauty and visually showed no relationship to the aerodynamic coupé. The car was flat especially shorter at the front and because of the missing roof and the shorter windshield as the series 904. However, this made the car around 120 kg lighter than the coupé, with a weight of 570 kg.

During the European Championship season 1965, the body was changed several times. For example, the windshield on model number 906 004 was shortened and flattened. Later, the Bergspyder received again a lighter and rounded at the front and aerodynamically improved car body.

A total of five copies were produced, of which three were destroyed in accidents. In the European Hill Climb Championship, Gerhard Mitter piloted the Bergspyder to an overall victory at the hill climb Rossfeld in 1965. The 904 Bergspyder was replaced at the end of 1965 at the hill climb Ollon-Villars by the Porsche 906 Spyder Mountain.

==== Suspension ====
The chassis and suspension were taken over without major changes from the 904 coupé. Due to the low weight and the unadjusted suspension of the 904, the Bergspyder was very difficult to drive.

==== Engine and transmission ====
The Bergspyder is powered by the air-cooled 2-liter eight-cylinder boxer engine used in the type 771. This engine had its first use in 1962 in the Porsche 718 RS 61 [21] and already had a Bosch injection system for mixture preparation. The valves were operated by two overhead camshafts with vertical shaft drive. The engine delivered up to 191 kW (260 hp) at 8,800 rpm and had a compression ratio of 10.5: 1. The car had a top speed of around 260 km/h (161 mph).

== Racing ==

Making an inauspicious debut at Sebring in 1964, where it suffered clutch trouble, &quot;a four-cylinder 904 took an astounding first overall&quot; at the Targa Florio. It went on to a third at the Nürburgring and a perfect finish at Le Mans. Both times, all five starters finished, placed in the top twelve overall, among many much more powerful cars. 904s showed remarkable durability; they &quot;almost always&quot; finished, and at Reims in 1964, a customer car fresh from Stuttgart, driven to the track, went on to win without the need for any spares at all. For 1964, 904s racked up a 1–2 at the Targa Florio and class wins at Spa, Sebring (co-driven by Briggs Cunningham and Lake Underwood), the Nürburgring, Le Mans, Watkins Glen, Zandvoort, Canada, and the Paris 1000 Kilometer, in the process taking SCCA&#x27;s C-Production and E-Sports Racing titles. In addition, it won rally events including the Tulip, Munich-Vienna-Budapest, Geneva, and &quot;highly acclaimed&quot; Alpine Rally. For 1965, results were &quot;equally impressive&quot;, seeing wins at the Spanish, Rossfeld, Hellbronner, and Gaisburg rallies, as well as a class win and second overall in the Monte Carlo Rally which saw just 22 finishers in the points, out of 237 starters. In addition, 904s won their class at the Monza 1000 Kilometer, Targa, Spa, Daytona Continental, Le Mans, and Zandvoort, among others, repeating their E-Sports title win and adding an SCCA E-Production championship.

<text>The Porsche 906 or Carrera 6 is a street-legal racing car from Porsche. It was announced in January 1966 and 50 examples were subsequently produced, thus meeting the homologation requirements of the FIA&#x27;s new Group 4 Sports Car category to the number. The type would also compete in modified form in the Group 6 Sports Prototype class.

== History ==

Prior to the Porsche 906 was the 904 which achieved many racing victories. At the age of 28, Ferdinand Piëch, the grandson of Ferdinand Porsche was given the important job of being in charge of the development of the new Porsche racing cars. His goal for recreating the 904 to the new 906 was to make it as lightweight as can be. This would mean stripping all of the heavy steel from the body and using unstressed fiberglass instead.
Constructing the new car with the fiberglass helped with things such as structural support as well as looks because it was all placed by hand instead of having an uneven paint job done to it.

The finished product weighed around 580 kg (1,280 lbs), which was around 250 lbs lighter than the 904. This was not only due to the body, but also the engine was much lighter. Normally the car would be fitted with a 901/20 6-cylinder with carburetors that was making 210 horsepower at 8,000 rpm. On occasion though there would be times when it was replaced with a 8-cylinder when the car was being used by the factory racing team. This would help in events such as hillclimbing, when the altitude would increase, against the Ferrari Dino in the European championship.

In its debut in the 1966 24 Hours of Daytona, the Carrera 6 finished 6th overall, and won its class against Ferrari Dino 206 Ps. At the 12 Hours of Sebring, Hans Herrmann/Herbert Müller finished fourth overall and won the class, as well as at the 1000 km of Monza, Spa, and Nürburgring.

Willy Mairesse/Gerhard Müller, driving a privately entered 906, secured an overall victory at the 1966 Targa Florio when the factory cars failed. At the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans, the 906 placed 4-5-6-7 behind three Ford GT40 Mk IIs, outlasting all of the previously dominant V12-engined Ferrari Ps.

For the year of the car&#x27;s debut in 1966, it achieved numerous victories. American-British race car driver Ken Miles took the 2.0-liter class in the Las Vegas Stardust and Laguna Seca USRRC races. These victories didn&#x27;t just stop in 1966, but went on through 1967 and 1968. Another well known Porsche driver by the name of Peter Gregg secured himself some wins at the Bahama Speed Weeks. Now not only were professional racers driving these cars, but so was comedian Dick Smothers and Fred Baker. They secured eighth overall to win its 2.0-liter class in 1969.

== Construction ==
Unlike previous racing Porsches, the 906&#x27;s body was tested in a wind tunnel, resulting in a top speed of at Le Mans, quite fast for a 2-liter engine car. At the time it showed a close resemblance to future Porsche racing cars. As in the Mercedes-Benz 300SL, gull-wing doors were fitted, and the mid-ship mounted engine was covered with a large plexiglas cover. The Porsche 906 was fitted with an engine that actually came from the Porsche 911R just with a few modifications done to it. These changes included some exotic metals (titanium) in the connecting rods and the crank case (magnesium) to help the car perform at a higher level.

In order to save money, spare suspension components produced in advance for a possible new series of Porsche 904 had to be used for the 906, along with big 15-inch wheels. Yet, Formula One used lighter 13-inch wheels, and Porsche had already used Team Lotus suspension parts in earlier years. The wheels were bolted on with 5 nuts as in a road car, which cost time in pitstops compared to a single central nut. Porsche had reused a lot of different parts on the 906 like the suspension from the 904 and the engine from the 911, but they had also utilized the 5 speed manual gearbox that came from the Porsche 911.

To take advantage of the lighter wheels and F1 tyres, the Porsche 910 was developed and entered in mid-season of 1966, starting with the hillclimb from Sierre to Crans-Montana in Switzerland.

<text>Tadeusz Reichstein (20 July 1897 – 1 August 1996), also known as Tadeus Reichstein, was a Polish-Swiss chemist and the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine laureate (1950), which was awarded for his work on the isolation of cortisone.

==Early life==
Reichstein was born into a Polish-Jewish family at Włocławek, Russian Empire. His parents were Gastawa (Brockmann) and Izydor Reichstein. He spent his early childhood at Kiev, where his father was an engineer. Due to the violent pogroms occurring all over the Russian Empire in 1905, his father began to explore emigration options for the family. Tadeus began his education at boarding-school in Jena, Germany and arrived in Zürich, Switzerland two years later (1907) at the age of 10.

==Career==
Reichstein studied under Hermann Staudinger during the latter&#x27;s brief stint at the Technical University of Karlsruhe. It was here that he met Leopold Ruzicka, also a doctoral student.

In 1933, working in Zürich, Switzerland, at the ETHZ chemical laboratories of Ruzicka, Reichstein succeeded, independently of Sir Norman Haworth and his collaborators in the United Kingdom, in synthesizing vitamin C (ascorbic acid) in what is now called the Reichstein process. In 1937, he was appointed Associate Professor at ETHZ.

In 1937, Reichstein moved to the University of Basel where he became Professor of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, and then, from 1946 until his retirement in 1967, of Organic Chemistry.

Together with Edward Calvin Kendall and Philip Showalter Hench, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1950 for their work on hormones of the adrenal cortex which culminated in the isolation of cortisone. In 1951, he and Kendall were jointly awarded the Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh.

In later years, Reichstein became interested in the phytochemistry and cytology of ferns, publishing at least 80 papers on these subjects in the last three decades of his life. He had a particular interest in the use of chromosome number and behavior in the interpretation of histories of hybridization and polyploidy, but also continued his earlier interest in the chemical constituents of the plants.

==Retirement and death==
Reichstein died at the age of 99 in Basel, Switzerland. The principal industrial process for the artificial synthesis of vitamin C still bears his name. Reichstein was the longest-lived Nobel laureate at the time of his death, but was surpassed in 2008 by Rita Levi-Montalcini.

<doc id="387427" wikidata="Q765297" url="?curid=387427" title="Volga-Dnepr Airlines">
<text>Volga-Dnepr Airlines, LLC () is an airline based in Ulyanovsk, Russia. It specializes in providing air charter services through all-cargo aircraft certified for global operations. Volga-Dnepr Airlines serves governmental and commercial organizations in the petrochemical, energy, aerospace, agriculture, and telecommunications industries well as humanitarian and emergency service organizations with its services through its 17 aircraft fleet. Its main base is Ulyanovsk Vostochny Airport (ULY), Ulyanovsk and it has a hub at Krasnoyarsk Yemelyanovo Airport (KJA), Krasnoyarsk. The airline also operates an operations base in Houston, Texas, United States at George Bush Intercontinental Airport.

==History==
===Formation through 2000===
In August 1990, the airline was created as a joint stock company by its major shareholders: aircraft manufacturer Aviastar, aircraft manufacturer Aviant (now known as Antonov Serial Production Plant), aircraft design bureau Antonov Aeronautical Scientific-Technical Complex (now known as Antonov State Company), and aircraft engine manufacturer Progress Design Bureau (now known as Motor Sich). It started operations in October 1991, when it carried 120-ton cargo from Amsterdam to Almaty.

In April 1995, the airline hosted a meeting of companies involved in the design, manufacturing, and operation of the An-124, creating a Joint Coordination Council to plan and implement improvements for that aircraft model.

In November 1996, Volga-Dnepr began scheduled passenger service between Ulyanovsk and Moscow, using Yakovlev Yak-40 aircraft. In the following year, Volga-Dnepr expanded its scheduled passenger service to include St. Petersburg and Sochi, as well.

Aviastar sold its 34% holding in the airline to Russian insurance firm NIK in 1999.

In April 2000, the privately owned Russian defense industry investor Kaskol Group acquired a 16% stake in the airline, of which the majority was from the Ukrainian state property fund. Kaskol later raised its stake to 49% of the airline. At the end of 2005, Kaskol sold its stake in the airline, due to its discontent with the company&#x27;s management&#x27;s strategy.

===2001 to present===
The airline terminated its joint venture with HeavyLift on 1 February 2001, with the stated reason to enable the airline to attract the investment that it needed to expand its fleet. The airline also set up marketing subsidiaries in London, UK and Houston, Texas.

Shortly afterward, HeavyLift joined its UK competitor, Air Foyle, which was the worldwide sales agent of Volga-Dnepr Airlines&#x27; Ukrainian competitor, Antonov Airlines, to form a new joint venture, Air Foyle HeavyLift.

In 2001, the Volga-Dnepr Group was formed, with Volga-Dnepr Airlines being its first company and the key element of its chartered cargo subgroup. In 2004, the Group created AirBridgeCargo to be the key element in the Group&#x27;s scheduled cargo services subgroup.

In 2002, the airline suspended funding of an An-124-100M being produced by Aviastar due to a dispute between Aviastar and local politicians in Ulyanovsk in which the local government seized the aircraft. According to Volga-Dnepr, the founder of Aviastar refused to bribe local politicians and businessmen to secure their cooperation. Volga-Dnepr threatened to move its headquarters from Ulyanovsk at the time, saying that the airline was well known for having &quot;a clear accounting system and good business reputation&quot;, and that it would move &quot;from Ulyanovsk in order to preserve these qualities&quot;. The dispute was resolved and the airline resumed funding production of the aircraft.

The airline began flying chartered missions for the US Air Force Air Mobility Command in 2003, eventually ferrying thousands of tons of vital military equipment to U.S. operating forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2005, the airline established a subsidiary in Houston, Texas that committed to making An-124 aircraft available to Air Mobility Command in the event of a national emergency, qualifying Volga-Dnepr to bid for cargo charters from Air Mobility Command and other US government agencies.

In 2005, the airline and its Ukrainian competitor, Antonov Airlines, formed a partnership, Ruslan SALIS, which signed a three-year contract with NATO to provide strategic airlift services to the alliance&#x27;s Strategic Airlift Interim Solution (SALIS). The contract was renewable through 2012 and required Ruslan to maintain two An-124 aircraft in a ready state in Leipzig, Germany, with an additional four An-124 aircraft available if needed.

Antonov Airlines terminated its joint venture with Air Foyle HeavyLift on June 30, 2006, to pursue a joint marketing venture with its competitor, Volga-Dnepr Airlines. This venture was named Ruslan International, and it aimed to build on the success of their previous Ruslan Salis collaboration.

In 2007, Volga-Dnepr and its Irish subsidiary were debarred from U.N. contracting after it surfaced during the trial of Vladimir Kuznetsov, formerly the highest-ranking Russian diplomat at the United Nations, that bribes were paid to Alexander Yakovlev, a U.N. procurement official, and laundered by Kuznetsov. Kuznetsov was found guilty and Yakovlev pled guilty, and testified against Kuznetsov, for crimes of fraud and money-laundering related to the bribes. Both were imprisoned as a result. Yakovlev claimed to provide consulting services and billed in excess of US$700,000 to Volga-Dnepr in order to help them win tenders. The Office of Internal Oversight Services Procurement Task Force found that, between March 2000 and November 2004, Yakovlev received funds exceeding US$1.8 million into an off-shore bank account from Volga-Dnepr and ICT, a company working on contract procurement for Volga-Dnepr at the time. The report found that the actual sum received could be even higher, as the sources for substantial other sources of funds could not be identified. In a response letter to the report, Volga-Dnepr admits to making payments to Yakovlev, but insists Yakovlev was a paid consultant, and the company was unaware of involvement or influence over the bidding process. In the same period, The UN contracted over US$134 million to Volga-Dnepr. The World Bank has listed Yakovlev and Kuznetsov as corruption case asset recovery targets for the Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative. As of 2019, following years of sustained effort to institute extensive measures (e.g., external annual audits and a strong Code of Ethics) to address and ensure proper employee conduct in procurement matters. Volga Dnepr was awaiting UN action on its request for reinstatement as a UN vendor.

In December 2012, Ruslan Salis&#x27; NATO contract was extended through the end of 2014, having previously been extended in 2008 and 2010. Prior to the annexation of Crimea, it appeared likely that the contract would be extended for yet another two-year term.

In early 2015, without notice to the company or affording the company an opportunity to be heard, US TRANSCOM removed privately owned Volga Dnepr from its approved airlift vendor list together with several government-owned Russian flag air carriers. Despite a FOIA action which it eventually abandoned, Volga-Dnepr never received a United States Department of Defense explanation for its removal from the TRANSCOM vendor list. From the redacted reports obtained by journalists, however, it was heavily implied, but never proven, that Volga-Dnepr was blacklisted by the US military for delivering Russian-built fighter aircraft on behalf of Rosoboronexport to Vietnam in December 2014. Notably, during that same year, the U.S. Army took delivery from Rosoboronexport of the last lot of Russian-built Mi-17 helicopters (45 in all) which it had purchased for transfer to Afghanistan, and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry lifted U.S. sanctions against Vietnam.

In August 2015, Volga-Dnepr paid $11,250 for a speaker&#x27;s fee for Michael T. Flynn&#x27;s appearance at a Washington, D.C. event on economic security in the Middle East it co-hosted with another American company. Danny Yatom, former director of the Israeli Mossad, was also a distinguished guest at that event. The event was held nearly 6 months after Volga-Dnepr was removed from the TRANSCOM vendor list. Because of Volga-Dnepr&#x27;s crucial airlift role in the U.S. war effort in Iraq and Afghanistan, the company had become acquainted with a wide variety of senior U.S. military and diplomatic officials, active and retired. Indeed, a serving U.S. Air Force general officer who later served as Air Force Chief of Staff actually took the controls and piloted a Volga-Dnepr An-124-100 in flight during a mission to Scott Air Force Base. Michael Flynn&#x27;s appointment as national security adviser came long after Volga-Dnepr&#x27;s removal from the TRANSCOM airlift list and long after Flynn&#x27;s retirement. As the company later explained: &quot;At that time General Flynn was a retired military officer, not a member of President Trump&#x27;s election team, and his nomination as National Security Adviser more than a year after the conference was not a factor in his being invited as a speaker&quot;.

In July 2021, Volga-Dnepr stated that it is preparing to place its first bond issue worth up to US$96.4 million to refinance its existing debt.

===Notable missions===
According to Moscow Defense Brief, the company has transported excavators and yachts, missile launchers, airplanes, helicopters, elephants, whales, mini-factories and power plants, Beaujolais Nouveau wine, and unique museum collections over the past 18 years. Deliveries of equipment for the heavy machine building, oil and gas, and aerospace sectors are most in demand. In 2008, Volga-Dnepr transported Kibo, the Japanese Experiment Module for the International Space Station (ISS), from Japan to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. It is the largest single ISS module.

In 2008, ExxonMobil PNG Limited asked Volga-Dnepr to assist in building a gas conditioning plant as part of the PNG LNG Project in Papua New Guinea, which is estimated to deliver nine trillion cubic feet of gas over a 30-year period. Due to the mountainous nature of the terrain and 350 inches of rainfall a year, this task was extremely difficult to accomplish using conventional means. Exxon considered an &quot;air bridge&quot; option to transport very heavy and delicate equipment that simply could not come to the site via the road. Volga-Dnepr specialists helped to design a new airfield in Komo to handle An-124-100 flights by providing advice on the airport&#x27;s optimal location and the technical characteristics of its runway, which is in length and wide. In 2012, Volga-Dnepr won the tender to deliver equipment for the PNG LNG Project&#x27;s Hides Gas Conditioning Plant to the Komo site, and in 2013 the company operated 88 cargo flights carrying over 6,000 tons of equipment and materials in the space of 103 days.

On 18 May 2020, a wrapped up for shipment, the first stage of the Atlas V rocket that will launch NASA&#x27;s Perseverance rover arrived at Cape Canaveral aboard a Ukrainian-built Antonov An-124 cargo plane.

In July, 2020, Volga-Dnepr Airlines partnered with freight forwarder Geodis to complete 48 An-124 flights delivering medical supplies to France.

On February 18, 2022, Arianespace released a video on YouTube about OneWeb-18&#x27;s behind the scenes, where it showed that Volga-Dnepr&#x27;s An-124 always deliver OneWeb satellites to Kourou, French Guiana.

====Military missions====
The airline began flying chartered missions for the US Air Force Air Mobility Command in 2003 and opened a US-based subsidiary in Houston, Texas in 2005, further committing resources to Air Mobility Command in the event of a national emergency. Through its Ruslan Salis joint venture with its Ukrainian competitor, Antonov Airlines, the airline provided strategic airlift services to NATO&#x27;s Strategic Airlift Interim Solution (SALIS) since 2005.

===Former passenger operations===

Volga-Dnepr formerly operated a small passenger service connecting Moscow with various destinations (Ulyanovsk-Moscow Vnukovo Airport flights in 1996) which were all domestic destinations along the Volga river. Service was offered using the airline&#x27;s small fleet of Yakovlev Yak-40&#x27;s to Nizhniy Novgorod, Penza and Ulyanovsk.

== Sanctions ==
In early 2023, the Canadian government imposed sanctions against Volga-Dnepr, accusing the company of participating in Russian invasion of Ukraine and servicing the Russian PMC Wagner. An An-124-100-150 aircraft belonging to the company (tail number RA-82078) was seized at Toronto Airport. The authorities plan to confiscate the plane and transfer it to Ukraine. In November 2023, Volga-Dnepr sued the Canadian government. The company claims that the decision was made in error and that the accusations are groundless.

==Fleet==
===Current fleet===
The Volga-Dnepr Airlines fleet includes the following aircraft (as of January 2018):

===Fleet development===
The airline&#x27;s first upgraded Ilyushin Il-76TD-90VD, fitted with Stage IV compliant PS90 engines, was delivered in June 2006 and has been heavily used on cargo charter flights to Europe, North America, Australia, and Japan, from where the freighter had previously been banned due to changes in environmental and noise legislation.

In July 2018, the airline ordered an additional 5 Boeing 747-8F aircraft and issued a letter of intent for 29 Boeing 777 Freighter aircraft. Those aircraft eventually went to AirBridge Cargo, another airline owned by the Volga-Dnepr Group.

<doc id="387430" wikidata="Q622630" url="?curid=387430" title="Odalisque">
<text>An odalisque (, ) was a chambermaid or a female attendant in a Turkish seraglio, particularly the court ladies in the household of the Ottoman sultan. In western European usage, the term came to mean the harem concubine, and refers to the eroticized artistic genre in which a woman is represented mostly or completely nude in a reclining position, often in the setting of a harem. It was part of a fascination with Orientalism, particularly in Great Britain and France.
==Etymology==

The word &quot;odalisque&quot; is French in form and originates from the Turkish &quot;odalık&quot;, meaning &quot;chambermaid&quot;, from &quot;oda&quot;, &quot;chamber&quot; or &quot;room&quot;. It can also be transliterated &quot;odahlic&quot;, &quot;odalisk&quot;, and &quot;odaliq&quot;.

Joan DelPlato has described the term&#x27;s shift in meaning from Turkish to English and French:

The English and French term odalisque (rarely odalique) derives from the Turkish &#x27;oda&#x27;, meaning &quot;chamber&quot;; thus an odalisque originally meant a chamber girl or attendant. In western usage, the term has come to refer specifically to the harem concubine. By the eighteenth century the term odalisque referred to the eroticized artistic genre in which a nominally eastern woman lies on her side on display for the spectator.

==Origin as the Turkish &quot;odalık&quot;==
An &quot;odalik&quot; was a maid who tended to the harem, but she could eventually become a concubine. She was ranked at the bottom of the social stratification of a harem, serving not the man of the household, but rather his concubines and wives as their personal chambermaid. &quot;Odalıklar&quot; were usually slaves given as gifts to the sultan by wealthy Turkish men. Generally, an &quot;odalık&quot; was never seen by the sultan, but instead remained under the direct supervision of his mother, the Valide sultan.

If an &quot;odalık&quot; was of extraordinary beauty or had exceptional talents in dancing or singing, she would be trained as a possible concubine. If selected, an &quot;odalık&quot; trained as a court lady would serve the sultan sexually. Only after such sexual contact would she change in status, becoming thenceforth one of the consorts of the sultan.
==Later Western usage of the term==

W. S. Gilbert refers to the &quot;Grace of an odalisque on a divan&quot; in Colonel Calverley&#x27;s song &quot;If You Want a Receipt for That Popular Mystery&quot; from the Gilbert and Sullivan opera &quot;Patience.&quot;

The word &quot;odalisque&quot; may also refer to a mistress, concubine or paramour of a wealthy man.

During the 19th century, &quot;odalisques&quot; became common figures in the artistic movement known as Orientalism, being featured in many erotic paintings from that era. 

By the later 19th century, Turkish writers such as Melek Hanum used the word odalisque to refer to slave-concubines when writing in English:
If any lady possesses a pretty-looking slave, the fact soon gets known. The gentlemen who wish to buy an odalisque or a wife, make their offers. Many Turks, indeed, prefer to take a slave as a wife, as, in such case, there is no need to dread fathers, mothers, or brothers-in-law, and other undesirable relations.
In 2011, the Law Society of British Columbia brought a disciplinary hearing against an unnamed lawyer for referring to another lawyer&#x27;s client as living with an odalisque. The Law Society found that the word&#x27;s use, though an extremely poor choice, did not rise to the level of professional misconduct: &quot;[28] … A lawyer, more than anyone, should be aware of the importance of using words carefully, alive to their nuances. Whether his failure to do so is the product of naïveté, as suggested by his counsel, stupidity or lack of care, it is at least unintelligent and certainly inexcusable.&quot;

<text>Physical oceanography is the study of physical conditions and physical processes within the ocean, especially the motions and physical properties of ocean waters.

Physical oceanography is one of several sub-domains into which oceanography is divided. Others include biological, chemical and geological oceanography.

Physical oceanography may be subdivided into &quot;descriptive&quot; and &quot;dynamical&quot; physical oceanography.

Descriptive physical oceanography seeks to research the ocean through observations and complex numerical models, which describe the fluid motions as precisely as possible.

Dynamical physical oceanography focuses primarily upon the processes that govern the motion of fluids with emphasis upon theoretical research and numerical models. These are part of the large field of Geophysical Fluid Dynamics (GFD) that is shared together with meteorology. GFD is a sub field of Fluid dynamics describing flows occurring on spatial and temporal scales that are greatly influenced by the Coriolis force.

== Physical setting ==

Roughly 97% of the planet&#x27;s water is in its oceans, and the oceans are the source of the vast majority of water vapor that condenses in the atmosphere and falls as rain or snow on the continents. The tremendous heat capacity of the oceans moderates the planet&#x27;s climate, and its absorption of various gases affects the composition of the atmosphere. The ocean&#x27;s influence extends even to the composition of volcanic rocks through seafloor metamorphism, as well as to that of volcanic gases and magmas created at subduction zones.

From sea level, the oceans are far deeper than the continents are tall; examination of the Earth&#x27;s hypsographic curve shows that the average elevation of Earth&#x27;s landmasses is only , while the ocean&#x27;s average depth is . Though this apparent discrepancy is great, for both land and sea, the respective extremes such as mountains and trenches are rare.

==Temperature, salinity and density==


Because the vast majority of the world ocean&#x27;s volume is deep water, the mean temperature of seawater is low; roughly 75% of the ocean&#x27;s volume has a temperature from 0° – 5 °C (Pinet 1996). The same percentage falls in a salinity range between 34 and 35 ppt (3.4–3.5%) (Pinet 1996). There is still quite a bit of variation, however. Surface temperatures can range from below freezing near the poles to 35 °C in restricted tropical seas, while salinity can vary from 10 to 41 ppt (1.0–4.1%).

The vertical structure of the temperature can be divided into three basic layers, a surface mixed layer, where gradients are low, a thermocline where gradients are high, and a poorly stratified abyss.

In terms of temperature, the ocean&#x27;s layers are highly latitude-dependent; the thermocline is pronounced in the tropics, but nonexistent in polar waters (Marshak 2001). The halocline usually lies near the surface, where evaporation raises salinity in the tropics, or meltwater dilutes it in polar regions. These variations of salinity and temperature with depth change the density of the seawater, creating the pycnocline.

=== Temperature ===
The temperature of ocean water varies significantly across different regions and depths. As mentioned, the vast majority of ocean water (around 75%) lies between 0° and 5°C, mostly in the deep ocean, where sunlight does not penetrate. The surface layers, however, experience far greater variability. In polar regions, surface temperatures can drop below freezing, while in tropical and subtropical regions, they may reach up to 35°C. This thermal stratification results in a vertical temperature gradient that divides the ocean into distinct layers.

# Surface Mixed Layer: This uppermost layer is well-mixed due to wind and wave action, resulting in minimal temperature variation with depth. The thickness of this layer varies depending on location and season but can extend from 50 to 200 meters.
# Thermocline: Below the mixed layer lies the thermocline, a zone where temperature decreases rapidly with increasing depth. The thermocline is especially pronounced in tropical and temperate regions but is absent in polar waters where surface temperatures are already near freezing. The depth and sharpness of the thermocline can shift with seasonal changes and ocean currents, playing a critical role in regulating heat exchange between the ocean and the atmosphere.
# Abyssal Zone: Beneath the thermocline is the deep ocean or abyssal zone, where temperatures remain relatively uniform, hovering just above freezing (0°-3°C). This cold, dense water originates from polar regions, where surface water cools, sinks, and spreads towards the equator along the ocean floor, forming the deep ocean circulation system.

=== Salinity ===
Salinity, a measure of the concentration of dissolved salts in seawater, typically ranges between 34 and 35 parts per thousand (ppt) in most of the world’s oceans. However, localized factors such as evaporation, precipitation, river runoff, and ice formation or melting cause significant variations in salinity. These variations are often most evident in coastal areas and marginal seas.

# Surface Salinity: In the open ocean, salinity is generally highest in subtropical regions where high evaporation rates dominate, and lowest in regions of high precipitation or freshwater influx from rivers, such as the mouths of the Amazon and Congo Rivers. Tropical and subtropical seas, such as the Red Sea and the Mediterranean, can experience salinities as high as 40-41 ppt due to intense evaporation and restricted water exchange with the open ocean.
# Halocline: The halocline is a layer within the ocean where salinity changes rapidly with depth. This stratification can be influenced by surface processes like evaporation (which increases salinity) and freshwater input (which decreases it). The halocline often coincides with the thermocline, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions, contributing to overall water column stability.
# Polar Regions: In polar areas, surface salinity is generally lower due to freshwater input from melting ice. During sea ice formation, however, brine rejection increases the salinity of surrounding waters, contributing to the sinking of dense water masses and the formation of deep ocean currents that drive global circulation patterns.
The salt in the oceans originates from runoff from terrestrial sources as well as hydrothermal vents. It has been estimated that the salinity of oceans was greater in the distant past than it is today.

=== Density and the Pycnocline ===
The combination of temperature and salinity variations leads to changes in seawater density. Seawater density is primarily influenced by both these factors—colder, saltier water is denser than warmer, fresher water. This variation in density creates stratification in the ocean and is key to understanding ocean circulation patterns.

# Pycnocline: The pycnocline is a layer within the ocean where the density increases rapidly with depth. It typically coincides with the thermocline and halocline in tropical and subtropical waters, forming a sharp boundary between the less dense surface waters and the denser deep ocean waters. This density stratification acts as a barrier to vertical mixing, limiting the exchange of heat, gases, and nutrients between the surface and deep ocean layers.
# Thermohaline Circulation: Density differences drive the thermohaline circulation, also known as the global &quot;conveyor belt,&quot; which plays a crucial role in regulating Earth&#x27;s climate. Cold, dense water formed in the polar regions sinks and moves along the ocean floor toward the equator, while warmer surface waters flow poleward to replace it. This global circulation helps redistribute heat and maintains the ocean&#x27;s dynamic equilibrium.
# Regional Variations: In areas of upwelling or downwelling, the density structure of the water column can be disrupted. Upwelling brings cooler, nutrient-rich water to the surface, while downwelling pushes surface waters to greater depths, impacting local ecosystems and global climate.

Understanding the complex interactions between temperature, salinity, and density is essential for predicting ocean circulation patterns, climate change effects, and the health of marine ecosystems. These factors also influence marine life, as many species are sensitive to the specific temperature and salinity ranges of their habitats.

==Circulation==
Energy for the ocean circulation (and for the atmospheric circulation) comes from solar radiation and gravitational energy from the Sun and Moon. The amount of sunlight absorbed at the surface varies strongly with latitude, being greater at the equator than at the poles, and this engenders fluid motion in both the atmosphere and ocean that acts to redistribute heat from the equator towards the poles, thereby reducing the temperature gradients that would exist in the absence of fluid motion. Perhaps three quarters of this heat is carried in the atmosphere; the rest is carried in the ocean.

The atmosphere is heated from below, which leads to convection, the largest expression of which is the Hadley circulation. By contrast the ocean is heated from above, which tends to suppress convection. Instead ocean deep water is formed in polar regions where cold salty waters sink in fairly restricted areas. This is the beginning of the thermohaline circulation.

Oceanic currents are largely driven by the surface wind stress; hence the large-scale atmospheric circulation is important to understanding the ocean circulation. The Hadley circulation leads to Easterly winds in the tropics and Westerlies in mid-latitudes. This leads to slow equatorward flow throughout most of a subtropical ocean basin (the Sverdrup balance). The return flow occurs in an intense, narrow, poleward western boundary current. Like the atmosphere, the ocean is far wider than it is deep, and hence horizontal motion is in general much faster than vertical motion. In the southern hemisphere there is a continuous belt of ocean, and hence the mid-latitude westerlies force the strong Antarctic Circumpolar Current. In the northern hemisphere the land masses prevent this and the ocean circulation is broken into smaller gyres in the Atlantic and Pacific basins.

===Coriolis effect===
The Coriolis effect results in a deflection of fluid flows (to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and left in the Southern Hemisphere). This has profound effects on the flow of the oceans. In particular it means the flow goes &quot;around&quot; high and low pressure systems, permitting them to persist for long periods of time. As a result, tiny variations in pressure can produce measurable currents. A slope of one part in one million in sea surface height, for example, will result in a current of 10 cm/s at mid-latitudes. The fact that the Coriolis effect is largest at the poles and weak at the equator results in sharp, relatively steady western boundary currents which are absent on eastern boundaries. Also see secondary circulation effects.

===Ekman transport===
Ekman transport results in the net transport of surface water 90 degrees to the right of the wind in the Northern Hemisphere, and 90 degrees to the left of the wind in the Southern Hemisphere. As the wind blows across the surface of the ocean, it &quot;grabs&quot; onto a thin layer of the surface water. In turn, that thin sheet of water transfers motion energy to the thin layer of water under it, and so on. However, because of the Coriolis Effect, the direction of travel of the layers of water slowly move farther and farther to the right as they get deeper in the Northern Hemisphere, and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. In most cases, the very bottom layer of water affected by the wind is at a depth of 100 m – 150 m and is traveling about 180 degrees, completely opposite of the direction that the wind is blowing. Overall, the net transport of water would be 90 degrees from the original direction of the wind.

===Langmuir circulation===
Langmuir circulation results in the occurrence of thin, visible stripes, called windrows on the surface of the ocean parallel to the direction that the wind is blowing. If the wind is blowing with more than 3 m s−1, it can create parallel windrows alternating upwelling and downwelling about 5–300 m apart. These windrows are created by adjacent ovular water cells (extending to about deep) alternating rotating clockwise and counterclockwise. In the convergence zones debris, foam and seaweed accumulates, while at the divergence zones plankton are caught and carried to the surface. If there are many plankton in the divergence zone fish are often attracted to feed on them.

===Ocean–atmosphere interface===

At the ocean-atmosphere interface, the ocean and atmosphere exchange fluxes of heat, moisture and momentum.

; Heat
The important heat terms at the surface are the sensible heat flux, the latent heat flux, the incoming solar radiation and the balance of long-wave (infrared) radiation. In general, the tropical oceans will tend to show a net gain of heat, and the polar oceans a net loss, the result of a net transfer of energy polewards in the oceans.

The oceans&#x27; large heat capacity moderates the climate of areas adjacent to the oceans, leading to a maritime climate at such locations. This can be a result of heat storage in summer and release in winter; or of transport of heat from warmer locations: a particularly notable example of this is Western Europe, which is heated at least in part by the north atlantic drift.

;Momentum
Surface winds tend to be of order meters per second; ocean currents of order centimeters per second. Hence from the point of view of the atmosphere, the ocean can be considered effectively stationary; from the point of view of the ocean, the atmosphere imposes a significant wind stress on its surface, and this forces large-scale currents in the ocean.

Through the wind stress, the wind generates ocean surface waves; the longer waves have a phase velocity tending towards the wind speed. Momentum of the surface winds is transferred into the energy flux by the ocean surface waves. The increased roughness of the ocean surface, by the presence of the waves, changes the wind near the surface.

;Moisture
The ocean can gain moisture from rainfall, or lose it through evaporation. Evaporative loss leaves the ocean saltier; the Mediterranean and Persian Gulf for example have strong evaporative loss; the resulting plume of dense salty water may be traced through the Straits of Gibraltar into the Atlantic Ocean. At one time, it was believed that evaporation/precipitation was a major driver of ocean currents; it is now known to be only a very minor factor.

===Planetary waves===
;Kelvin Waves

A Kelvin wave is any progressive wave that is channeled between two boundaries or opposing forces (usually between the Coriolis force and a coastline or the equator). There are two types, coastal and equatorial. Kelvin waves are gravity driven and non-dispersive. This means that Kelvin waves can retain their shape and direction over long periods of time. They are usually created by a sudden shift in the wind, such as the change of the trade winds at the beginning of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation.

Coastal Kelvin waves follow shorelines and will always propagate in a counterclockwise direction in the Northern hemisphere (with the shoreline to the right of the direction of travel) and clockwise in the Southern hemisphere.

Equatorial Kelvin waves propagate to the east in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, using the equator as a guide.

Kelvin waves are known to have very high speeds, typically around 2–3 meters per second. They have wavelengths of thousands of kilometers and amplitudes in the tens of meters.

;Rossby Waves

Rossby waves, or planetary waves are huge, slow waves generated in the troposphere by temperature differences between the ocean and the continents. Their major restoring force is the change in Coriolis force with latitude. Their wave amplitudes are usually in the tens of meters and very large wavelengths. They are usually found at low or mid latitudes.

There are two types of Rossby waves, barotropic and baroclinic. Barotropic Rossby waves have the highest speeds and do not vary vertically. Baroclinic Rossby waves are much slower.

The special identifying feature of Rossby waves is that the phase velocity of each individual wave always has a westward component, but the group velocity can be in any direction. Usually the shorter Rossby waves have an eastward group velocity and the longer ones have a westward group velocity.

===Climate variability===

The interaction of ocean circulation, which serves as a type of heat pump, and biological effects such as the concentration of carbon dioxide can result in global climate changes on a time scale of decades. Known climate oscillations resulting from these interactions, include the Pacific decadal oscillation, North Atlantic oscillation, and Arctic oscillation. The oceanic process of thermohaline circulation is a significant component of heat redistribution across the globe, and changes in this circulation can have major impacts upon the climate.

====La Niña–El Niño====
====Antarctic circumpolar wave====

This is a coupled ocean/atmosphere wave that circles the Southern Ocean about every eight years. Since it is a wave-2 phenomenon (there are two peaks and two troughs in a latitude circle) at each fixed point in space a signal with a period of four years is seen. The wave moves eastward in the direction of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.

===Ocean currents===
Among the most important ocean currents are the:
* Antarctic Circumpolar Current
* Deep ocean (density-driven)
* Western boundary currents
** Gulf Stream
** Kuroshio Current
** Labrador Current
** Oyashio Current
** Agulhas Current
** Brazil Current
** East Australia Current
* Eastern Boundary currents
** California Current
** Canary Current
** Peru Current
** Benguela Current

====Antarctic circumpolar====
The ocean body surrounding the Antarctic is currently the only continuous body of water where there is a wide latitude band of open water. It interconnects the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans, and provide an uninterrupted stretch for the prevailing westerly winds to significantly increase wave amplitudes. It is generally accepted that these prevailing winds are primarily responsible for the circumpolar current transport. This current is now thought to vary with time, possibly in an oscillatory manner.

====Deep ocean====
In the Norwegian Sea evaporative cooling is predominant, and the sinking water mass, the North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW), fills the basin and spills southwards through crevasses in the submarine sills that connect Greenland, Iceland and Britain. It then flows along the western boundary of the Atlantic with some part of the flow moving eastward along the equator and then poleward into the ocean basins. The NADW is entrained into the Circumpolar Current, and can be traced into the Indian and Pacific basins. Flow from the Arctic Ocean Basin into the Pacific, however, is blocked by the narrow shallows of the Bering Strait.

Also see marine geology about that explores the geology of the ocean floor including plate tectonics that create deep ocean trenches.

====Western boundary====
An idealised subtropical ocean basin forced by winds circling around a high pressure (anticyclonic) systems such as the Azores-Bermuda high develops a gyre circulation with slow steady flows towards the equator in the interior. As discussed by Henry Stommel, these flows are balanced in the region of the western boundary, where a thin fast polewards flow called a western boundary current develops. Flow in the real ocean is more complex, but the Gulf Stream, Agulhas and Kuroshio are examples of such currents. They are narrow (approximately 100 km across) and fast (approximately 1.5 m/s).

Equatorwards western boundary currents occur in tropical and polar locations, e.g. the East Greenland and Labrador currents, in the Atlantic and the Oyashio. They are forced by winds circulation around low pressure (cyclonic).

;Gulf Stream
The Gulf Stream, together with its northern extension, North Atlantic Current, is a powerful, warm, and swift Atlantic Ocean current that originates in the Gulf of Mexico, exits through the Strait of Florida, and follows the eastern coastlines of the United States and Newfoundland to the northeast before crossing the Atlantic Ocean.

;Kuroshio
The Kuroshio Current is an ocean current found in the western Pacific Ocean off the east coast of Taiwan and flowing northeastward past Japan, where it merges with the easterly drift of the North Pacific Current. It is analogous to the Gulf Stream in the Atlantic Ocean, transporting warm, tropical water northward towards the polar region.

==Heat flux==

===Heat storage===

Ocean heat flux is a turbulent and complex system which utilizes atmospheric measurement techniques such as eddy covariance to measure the rate of heat transfer expressed in the unit of or petawatts. Heat flux is the flow of energy per unit of area per unit of time. Most of the Earth&#x27;s heat storage is within its seas with smaller fractions of the heat transfer in processes such as evaporation, radiation, diffusion, or absorption into the sea floor. The majority of the ocean heat flux is through advection or the movement of the ocean&#x27;s currents. For example, the majority of the warm water movement in the south Atlantic is thought to have originated in the Indian Ocean. Another example of advection is the nonequatorial Pacific heating which results from subsurface processes related to atmospheric anticlines. Recent warming observations of Antarctic bottom water in the Southern Ocean is of concern to ocean scientists because bottom water changes will effect currents, nutrients, and biota elsewhere. The international awareness of global warming has focused scientific research on this topic since the 1988 creation of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Improved ocean observation, instrumentation, theory, and funding has increased scientific reporting on regional and global issues related to heat.

===Sea level change===

Tide gauges and satellite altimetry suggest an increase in sea level of 1.5–3 mm/yr over the past 100 years.

The IPCC predicts that by 2081–2100, global warming will lead to a sea level rise of 260 to 820 mm.

==Rapid variations==

===Tides===
The rise and fall of the oceans due to tidal effects is a key influence upon the coastal areas. Ocean tides on the planet Earth are created by the gravitational effects of the Sun and Moon. The tides produced by these two bodies are roughly comparable in magnitude, but the orbital motion of the Moon results in tidal patterns that vary over the course of a month.

The ebb and flow of the tides produce a cyclical current along the coast, and the strength of this current can be quite dramatic along narrow estuaries. Incoming tides can also produce a tidal bore along a river or narrow bay as the water flow against the current results in a wave on the surface.

&quot;Tide and Current&quot; (Wyban 1992) clearly illustrates the impact of these natural cycles on the lifestyle and livelihood of Native Hawaiians tending coastal fishponds. &quot;Aia ke ola ka hana&quot; meaning . . . &quot;Life is in labor&quot;.

&quot;Tidal resonance&quot; occurs in the Bay of Fundy since the time it takes for a large wave to travel from the mouth of the bay to the opposite end, then reflect and travel back to the mouth of the bay coincides with the tidal rhythm producing the world&#x27;s highest tides.

As the surface tide oscillates over topography, such as submerged seamounts or ridges, it generates internal waves at the tidal frequency, which are known as internal tides.

===Tsunamis===

A series of surface waves can be generated due to large-scale displacement of the ocean water. These can be caused by sub-marine landslides, seafloor deformations due to earthquakes, or the impact of a large meteorite.

The waves can travel with a velocity of up to several hundred km/hour across the ocean surface, but in mid-ocean they are barely detectable with wavelengths spanning hundreds of kilometers.

Tsunamis, originally called tidal waves, were renamed because they are not related to the tides. They are regarded as shallow-water waves, or waves in water with a depth less than 1/20 their wavelength. Tsunamis have very large periods, high speeds, and great wave heights.

The primary impact of these waves is along the coastal shoreline, as large amounts of ocean water are cyclically propelled inland and then drawn out to sea. This can result in significant modifications to the coastline regions where the waves strike with sufficient energy.

The tsunami that occurred in Lituya Bay, Alaska on July 9, 1958 was high and is the biggest tsunami ever measured, almost taller than the Sears Tower in Chicago and about taller than the former World Trade Center in New York.

===Surface waves===

The wind generates ocean surface waves, which have a large impact on offshore structures, ships, Coastal erosion and sedimentation, as well as harbours. After their generation by the wind, ocean surface waves can travel (as swell) over long distances.

<text>Bengt Ronnie Peterson (; 14 February 1944 – 11 September 1978) was a Swedish racing driver, who competed in Formula One from to . Nicknamed &quot;Superswede&quot;, Peterson twice finished runner-up in the Formula One World Drivers&#x27; Championship in and , and won 10 Grands Prix across nine seasons.

Peterson began his motor racing career in kart racing, traditionally the discipline where the majority of race drivers begin their careers in open-wheel racing. After winning a number of karting titles, including two Swedish titles in 1963 and 1964, he moved on to Formula Three, where he won the Monaco Grand Prix Formula Three support race for the 1969 Grand Prix. Later that year he won the FIA European Formula 3 Championship and moved up into Formula One, racing for the March factory team. In his three-year spell with the team, he took six podiums, most of which were scored during the 1971 Formula One season in which he also finished as runner-up in the Drivers&#x27; Championship.

After seeing out his three-year contract at March, Peterson joined Colin Chapman&#x27;s Team Lotus in the 1973 season, partnering defending champion Emerson Fittipaldi. During his first two seasons with Lotus, Peterson took seven victories, scoring a career-best 52 points in 1973. After a poor 1975 season, Peterson moved back to March and scored his final victory for the team at the 1976 Italian Grand Prix. After spending the 1977 season with Tyrrell, he moved back to Lotus for the 1978 season as number two driver to Mario Andretti. Peterson scored two wins, at the South African and Austrian Grand Prix races, and finished second in the Drivers&#x27; Championship standings despite his fatal first-lap accident at Monza during the Italian Grand Prix.

==Early life==
Peterson was born in the bourough Almby in Örebro, Sweden. He developed his driving style at a young age while competing in karting, and rapidly worked his way up to the pinnacle of European karting before switching to cars.

==Formulas Three and Two==
After his karting years, Peterson entered Formula Three racing in the &quot;Svebe&quot;, a 1-litre, Brabham-derived Formula car he co-designed with his father Bengt (who was a baker) and Sven Andersson.

Superb results from the outset quickly attracted the attention of the ambitious Tecno company from Italy, who signed him in 1968. With them, he won the 1969 Formula Three Championship.

Even after his elevation to F1 status Peterson still drove in lower echelon racing series (which was common at the time), winning the 1971 European Formula Two Championship driving for March.

==Formula One==

===Early years===
Peterson made his Grand Prix debut in a March 701 for Colin Crabbe&#x27;s works-supported Antique Automobiles Racing Team at the 1970 Monaco Grand Prix. The limited budget of Crabbe&#x27;s privateer team allowed only minimal testing, and Peterson qualified 12th out of 16 cars in the race. He was 10 places behind Jackie Stewart and Chris Amon, both on the front row of the grid in their newer specification 701s, but only just behind the more experienced Jo Siffert in the second works March. Peterson was the only March driver to finish the race, in seventh place. In 1971 Peterson moved up to the full March works team, and made an instant impression. Five Formula One Grand Prix second places earned him the position of runner-up to Jackie Stewart in that year&#x27;s World Championship. Within that year, Peterson drove in the World Sports Car Championship driving an Autodelta Alfa Romeo to win the Watkins Glen 6 hours. Peterson stayed at March until 1973, when he signed for John Player Team Lotus to partner Emerson Fittipaldi.

===1973–1976===
Peterson&#x27;s first Grand Prix win was at the 1973 French Grand Prix, held at Paul Ricard, in a Lotus 72. He took three more wins that year, in Austria, Italy and the United States, but poor reliability restricted him to only third place in the World Championship at season&#x27;s end.

For 1974, the Lotus 76 was brought forth. The car, however, proved to be a failure, disliked by both Peterson and his teammate Jacky Ickx. The team therefore opted to let them drive the much older Lotus 72s. Peterson did well in the old car and claimed three more victories: the French and Italian Grands Prix, as well as the Monaco Grand Prix.

1975 was a bad year for Lotus. Peterson and Ickx were forced to drive with the now archaic 72 model, whose age was now really beginning to show.

Peterson had signed for Shadow but Lotus owner Colin Chapman convinced him to stay with Lotus due to a promise Chapman made to accelerate the rate of development on the Lotus 77. He drove the first race of 1976 in the Lotus 77 before rejoining March Engineering. Driving the March 761, he won the Italian Grand Prix.

He also continued to drive sports cars, particularly for BMW in 1974 and 1975. For instance, he was paired with Hans-Joachim Stuck in a BMW 3.0 CSL for the South African &quot;Wynn&#x27;s 1000&quot; in November 1975, where they started on pole but finished in second after a number of stops with engine vibrations, spark plug, and similar problems. Stuck and Peterson raced together for BMW in Europe, Africa, and also in North America.

===1977: Tyrrell===

In 1977, he raced for Tyrrell, driving the six-wheel Tyrrell P34B. Peterson retired from the opening four races of 1977, he spun off in Argentina, was involved in a crash with Jochen Mass&#x27;s McLaren and Clay Regazzoni&#x27;s Ensign in Brazil, and suffered fuel systems problems in South Africa and United States West. He finished eighth in Spain but retired at Monaco with brake failure. Peterson&#x27;s only podium finish was a third place at a rain-affected race in Belgium. Hopes were high at home in Sweden but Peterson retired with ignition problems and then finished 12th at France. He had an engine failure in Britain, finished ninth at Germany and got fifth in Austria. Peterson retired with ignition problems at Holland, sixth in Italy and 16th in the United States. Peterson retired from the last two races of 1977, a fuel leak in Canada and in Japan, he collided with Gilles Villeneuve&#x27;s Ferrari but the crash killed a marshal and photographer as they were standing in a prohibited area of the track when the accident occurred.

===1978: Lotus===
Peterson surprised many by leaving Tyrrell to return to John Player Team Lotus for 1978.
He won the 1978 South African Grand Prix, with a last-lap victory over Patrick Depailler, as well as the Austrian Grand Prix, in the innovative &#x27;ground effect&#x27; Lotus 79. His teammate Mario Andretti won the Drivers&#x27; Championship with Peterson acting effectively as the Team &quot;No. 2&quot; with the pair scoring four 1–2 wins, all with Andretti at the lead. Both of Peterson&#x27;s wins occurred when Andretti encountered trouble, with Andretti winning once when Peterson failed to finish (not including the Italian Grand Prix). Many times, Peterson followed Andretti closely home, leading to speculation that team orders were in place.

Throughout the 1970s Peterson had the reputation of being the fastest driver in F1 in terms of raw speed. During the 1978 season Andretti would frequently post the faster qualifying time. Another view, held by some contemporary observers, was that while Peterson may have in fact been the outright quicker of the two, it was Andretti&#x27;s considerable car development skills that brought the recalcitrant Lotus 78 and 79 to full potential, and Peterson&#x27;s seeming deference to Andretti was a tacit acknowledgement of this. Despite this, Peterson was offered a seat at McLaren in 1979. Peterson refused to contribute to any controversy, and on numerous occasions dismissed the speculation by stating that Andretti had simply turned the faster time.

==Death==
The 1978 Italian Grand Prix at Monza started badly for Peterson. In practice he damaged his Lotus 79 race car beyond immediate repair and bruised his legs in the process. Team Lotus had a spare 79, but it had been built for Andretti, and the much taller Peterson did not fit comfortably inside. The team&#x27;s only other car was a type 78, the previous year&#x27;s car, which had been dragged around the F1 circuit that season with minimal maintenance.

In the days after the race, many drivers on circuit stated that the race starter lit the green light for the race too early. Although a Formula One start is meant to be a standing start for all cars in the field, the early green light meant that cars in the rear rows were still rolling when the green light came on. This resulted in cars in the back getting a jump on those at the front, and an accordion effect as the cars approached the first chicane, bunching them tightly together. The front four, Andretti, Gilles Villeneuve, Jean-Pierre Jabouille and Niki Lauda, were far enough ahead to avoid any drama, but Peterson had made a poor start from the third row of the grid, and was immediately passed by Alan Jones, Jacques Laffite and John Watson.

Jody Scheckter and Riccardo Patrese, starting 10th and 12th, had moved to the right across the line that separated the Grand Prix front straight from the approach to the old Monza banking. While Scheckter&#x27;s Wolf was able to rejoin the track well ahead of the bunching pack, Patrese moved back in just ahead of James Hunt, who feinted left and collided with Peterson, with Vittorio Brambilla, Carlos Reutemann, Hans-Joachim Stuck, Patrick Depailler, Didier Pironi, Derek Daly, Clay Regazzoni and Brett Lunger all involved in the ensuing melee.

Peterson&#x27;s Lotus went into the barriers hard and caught fire before bouncing back into the middle of the track. He was trapped in the burning wreck, but Hunt, Regazzoni and Depailler managed to free him before he received more than minor burns, while track marshals were extinguishing the car. He was dragged free and laid in the middle of the track fully conscious, but with severe leg injuries. Hunt later said he stopped Peterson from looking at his legs to spare him further distress.

At the time there was more concern for Brambilla, who had been hit on the head by a flying wheel and was slumped comatose in his car. Brambilla was seriously hurt and did not race again in Formula One until a year later. Peterson&#x27;s life was not seen to be in any danger. Sid Watkins and his medical team headed over to Brambilla&#x27;s car to extract him from the wreckage. The injured drivers along with Peterson were taken to a hospital in Milan and the race was restarted when the track had been cleaned up.

At the hospital, Peterson&#x27;s X-rays showed he had about 27 fractures in his legs and feet. After discussion with him, Peterson was sent to intensive care so that the surgeons could operate to stabilize the bones. There was some level of dispute between the doctors regarding whether all fractures should be immediately fixed or not. During the night, Peterson&#x27;s condition worsened, and he was diagnosed with fat embolism. By morning he was in full kidney failure due to the embolism, and was declared dead at 9:55am on 11 September 1978.

His teammate Mario Andretti clinched the championship at the race. &quot;It was so unfair to have a tragedy connected with probably what should have been the happiest day of my career&quot;, Andretti said, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t celebrate, but also, I knew that trophy would be with me forever. And I knew also that Ronnie would have been happy for me&quot;. Peterson took second place in the 1978 drivers&#x27; standings posthumously.
Peterson competed in 123 Grand Prix races during his career, winning ten of them.

At his funeral, the pallbearers included Åke Strandberg, James Hunt, Jody Scheckter, John Watson, Emerson Fittipaldi, Gunnar Nilsson and Niki Lauda.

===Legacy===
Peterson is considered by some to be one of the best Formula One drivers to have never won a championship, as well as the best racing driver from Sweden. In 2016, in an academic paper that reported a mathematical modeling study that assessed the relative influence of driver and machine, Peterson was ranked the 21st best Formula One driver of all time, and the sixth best to never win a title.

Arrows driver Riccardo Patrese was blamed by several members of the Grand Prix Drivers&#x27; Association (mainly by James Hunt) for being a primary cause of the first lap wreck at the Italian Grand Prix. He was banned from competition for one race, from the 1978 United States Grand Prix.

In 1979, George Harrison paid tribute to Peterson with a song and music video called &quot;Faster&quot;.

The circumstances of Peterson&#x27;s death were prosecuted in an Italian criminal court. Driver Riccardo Patrese and race director Gianni Restilli were both charged with roles; Patrese, for manslaughter because of an unsafe maneuver on track which was considered to be a primary cause of the wreck, and Restilli, as contributing to Peterson&#x27;s death by starting the race with a premature start signal. Both were cleared of criminal charges on 28 October 1981.

Peterson&#x27;s widow Barbro (née Edwardsson) never got over his death and committed suicide on 19 December 1987. She was buried alongside Ronnie in the Peterson family grave in Örebro. She and Ronnie had a daughter named Nina Louise (named after Jochen Rindt&#x27;s wife) who was born in November 1975.

There is a statue of Peterson in Örebro () by Richard Brixel. The official Ronnie Peterson Museum was officially opened by Ronnie&#x27;s daughter, Nina Kennedy, in Örebro on 31 May 2008. The museum closed in October 2009 because it was unable to secure further government funding.

&quot;Superswede: A film about Ronnie Peterson&quot; (2017), directed by Henrik Jansson-Schweizer, with the participation of Mario Andretti, Emerson Fittipaldi, Nina Kennedy, and Niki Lauda, is available on YouTube, as are several other short tributes.

During the 2014 Monaco Grand Prix fellow Swedish Formula One driver Marcus Ericsson wore a special helmet in tribute to Peterson which was modeled on Peterson&#x27;s. Ericsson wore a similar helmet en route to victory in the 2022 Indianapolis 500.

<doc id="387456" wikidata="Q399113" url="?curid=387456" title="Táin Bó Cúailnge">
<text>( ; &quot;the driving-off of the cows of Cooley&quot;), commonly known as The Táin or less commonly as The Cattle Raid of Cooley, is an epic from Irish mythology. It is often called &quot;the Irish &quot;Iliad&quot;&quot;, although like most other early Irish literature, the &quot;Táin&quot; is written in prosimetrum, i.e. prose with periodic additions of verse composed by the characters. The &quot;Táin&quot; tells of a war against Ulster by Queen Medb of Connacht and her husband King Ailill, who intend to steal the stud bull Donn Cuailnge. Due to a curse upon the king and warriors of Ulster, the invaders are opposed only by the young demigod, Cú Chulainn.

The &quot;Táin&quot; is traditionally set in the 1st century in a pagan heroic age, and is the central text of a group of tales known as the Ulster Cycle. It survives in three written versions or &quot;recensions&quot; in manuscripts of the 12th century and later, the first a compilation largely written in Old Irish, the second a more consistent work in Middle Irish, and the third an Early Modern Irish version.

The &quot;Táin&quot; has been influential on Irish literature and culture. It is often considered Ireland&#x27;s national epic.

==Synopsis==
The &quot;Táin&quot; is preceded by a number of &quot;remscéla&quot;, or pre-tales, which provide background on the main characters and explain the presence of certain characters from Ulster in the Connacht camp, the curse that causes the temporary inability of the remaining Ulstermen to fight and the magic origins of the bulls Donn Cuailnge and Finnbhennach. The eight &quot;remscéla&quot; chosen by Thomas Kinsella for his 1969 translation are sometimes taken to be part of the &quot;Táin&quot; itself, but come from a variety of manuscripts of different dates. Several other tales exist which are described as &quot;remscéla&quot; to the &quot;Táin&quot;, some of which have only a tangential relation to it.

The first recension begins with Ailill and Medb assembling their army in Cruachan; the purpose of this military build-up is taken for granted. The second recension adds a prologue in which Ailill and Medb compare their respective wealths and find that the only thing that distinguishes them is Ailill&#x27;s possession of the phenomenally fertile bull Finnbhennach, who had been born into Medb&#x27;s herd but scorned being owned by a woman so decided to transfer himself to Ailill&#x27;s. Medb determines to get the equally potent Donn Cuailnge from Cooley to equal her wealth with her husband. She successfully negotiates with the bull&#x27;s owner, Dáire mac Fiachna, to rent the animal for a year. However, her messengers, while drunk, reveal that Medb intends to take the bull by force if she is not allowed to borrow him. The deal breaks down, and Medb raises an army, including Ulster exiles led by Fergus mac Róich and other allies, and sets out to capture Donn Cuailnge.

The men of Ulster are disabled by an apparent illness, the &quot;ces noínden&quot; (literally &quot;debility of nine (days)&quot;, although it lasts several months). A separate tale explains this as the curse of the goddess Macha, who imposed it after being forced by the king of Ulster to race against a chariot while heavily pregnant. The only person fit to defend Ulster is seventeen-year-old Cú Chulainn, and he lets the army take Ulster by surprise because he is off on a tryst when he should be watching the border. Cú Chulainn, assisted by his charioteer Láeg, wages a guerrilla campaign against the advancing army, then halts it by invoking the right of single combat at fords, defeating champion after champion in a stand-off lasting months. However, he is unable to prevent Medb from capturing the bull.

Cú Chulainn is both helped and hindered by supernatural figures from the Tuatha Dé Danann. Before one combat the Morrígan, the goddess of war, visits him in the form of a beautiful young woman and offers him her love, but Cú Chulainn spurns her. She then reveals herself and threatens to interfere in his next fight. She does so, first in the form of an eel who trips him in the ford, then as a wolf who stampedes cattle across the ford, and finally as a heifer at the head of the stampede, but in each form, Cú Chulainn wounds her. After he defeats his opponent, the Morrígan appears to him in the form of an old woman milking a cow, with wounds corresponding to the ones Cú Chulainn gave her in her animal forms. She offers him three drinks of milk. With each drink he blesses her, and the blessings heal her wounds. Cú Chulainn tells the Morrígan that had he known her real identity, he would not have spurned her.

After a particularly arduous combat Cú Chulain is visited by another supernatural figure, Lug, who reveals himself to be Cú Chulainn&#x27;s father. Lug puts Cú Chulainn to sleep for three days while he works his healing arts on him. While Cú Chulainn sleeps the youth corps of Ulster come to his aid but are all slaughtered. When Cú Chulainn awakes he undergoes a spectacular &quot;ríastrad&quot; or &quot;distortion&quot;, in which his body twists in its skin and he becomes an unrecognisable monster who knows neither friend nor foe. Cú Chulainn launches a savage assault on the Connacht camp and avenges the youth corps sixfold.

After this extraordinary incident, the sequence of single combats resumes, although on several occasions Medb breaks the agreement by sending several men against Cú Chulainn at once. When Fergus, his foster-father, is sent to fight him, Cú Chulainn agrees to yield to him on the condition that Fergus yields the next time they meet. Finally, Medb incites Cú Chulainn&#x27;s foster-brother Ferdiad to enter the fray, with poets ready to mock him as a coward, and offering him the hand of her daughter Finnabair, and her own &quot;friendly thighs&quot; as well. Cú Chulainn does not wish to kill his foster-brother and pleads with Ferdiad to withdraw from the fight. There follows a physically and emotionally gruelling three-day duel between the hero and his foster-brother. Cú Chulainn wins, killing Ferdiad with the legendary spear, the Gáe Bolga. Wounded too sorely to continue fighting, Cú Chulainn is carried away by the healers of his clan.

The debilitated Ulstermen start to rouse, one by one at first, then &quot;en masse&quot;. King Conchobar mac Nessa vows, that as the sky is above and the Earth is beneath, he will return every cow back to its stall and every abducted woman back to her home. The climactic battle begins.

At first, Cú Chulainn sits it out, recovering from his wounds. Fergus has Conchobar at his mercy, but is prevented from killing him by Cormac Cond Longas, Conchobar&#x27;s son and Fergus&#x27; foster-son, and in his rage cuts the tops off three hills with his sword. Cú Chulainn shrugs off his wounds, enters the fray and confronts Fergus, whom he forces to make good on his promise and yield before him. Fergus withdraws, pulling all his forces off the battlefield. Connacht&#x27;s other allies panic and Medb is forced to retreat. Cú Chulainn comes upon Medb having her period ( &quot;Then it was that the issue of blood came upon Medb&quot; ). She pleads for her life and he not only spares her, but guards her retreat.

Medb brings Donn Cuailnge back to Connacht, where the bull fights Finnbhennach, kills him, but is mortally wounded, and wanders around Ireland dropping pieces of Finnbhennach off his horns and thus creating placenames before finally returning home to die of exhaustion.

==Text==
===Oral tradition===
The &quot;Táin&quot; is believed to have its origin in oral storytelling and to have only been written down during the Middle Ages.

Although Romanas Bulatovas believes that the &quot;Táin&quot; was originally composed at Bangor Abbey between 630 and 670 AD, there is evidence that it had a far older oral history long before anything was written down. For example, the poem &quot;Conailla Medb michuru&quot; (&quot;Medb enjoined illegal contracts&quot;) by Luccreth moccu Chiara, dated to , tells the story of Fergus mac Róich&#x27;s exile with Ailill and Medb, which the poet describes as having come from &quot;sen-eolas&quot; (&quot;old knowledge&quot;). Two further 7th-century poems also allude to elements of the story: in &quot;Verba Scáthaige&quot; (&quot;Words of Scáthach&quot;), the warrior-woman Scáthach prophesies Cú Chulainn&#x27;s combats at the ford; and &quot;Ro-mbáe laithi rordu rind&quot; (&quot;We had a great day of plying spear-points&quot;), attributed to Cú Chulainn himself, refers to an incident in the Boyhood Deeds section of the &quot;Táin&quot;.

The high regard in which the written account was held is suggested by a ninth-century triad, that associated the &quot;Táin&quot; with the following wonders: &quot;that the &quot;cuilmen&quot; [apparently a name for Isidore of Seville&#x27;s &quot;Etymologiae&quot;] came to Ireland in its stead; the dead relating it to the living, viz. Fergus mac Róich reciting it to Ninníne the poet at the time of Cormac mac Faeláin; one year&#x27;s protection to him to whom it is related.&quot;

Various versions of the epic have been collected from the oral tradition over the centuries since the earliest accounts were written down. A version of the &quot;Táin&quot; was taken down in Scottish Gaelic by folklore collector Calum Maclean from the dictation of Angus Beag MacLellan, a tenant farmer and &quot;seanchaidh&quot; from South Uist, in the Outer Hebrides. A transcription was published in 1959.

===Manuscripts===
Despite the date of the surviving manuscripts, a version of the &quot;Táin&quot; may have been put to writing already in the eighth century.

&quot;Táin Bó Cúailnge&quot; has survived in three s. The first consists of a partial text in &quot;Lebor na hUidre&quot; (the &quot;Book of the Dun Cow&quot;), a late 11th-/early 12th-century manuscript compiled in the monastery at Clonmacnoise, and another partial text of the same version in the 14th-century manuscript called the Yellow Book of Lecan. These two sources overlap, and a complete text can be reconstructed by combining them. This recension is a compilation of two or more earlier versions, indicated by the number of duplicated episodes and references to &quot;other versions&quot; in the text. Many of the episodes are superb, written in the characteristic terse prose of the best Old Irish literature, but others are cryptic summaries, and the whole is rather disjointed. Parts of this recension can be dated from linguistic evidence to the 8th century, and some of the verse passages may be even older.

The second recension is found in the 12th-century manuscript known as the Book of Leinster. This appears to have been a syncretic exercise by a scribe who brought together the &quot;Lebor na hUidre&quot; materials and unknown sources for the Yellow Book of Lecan materials to create a coherent version of the epic. While the result is a satisfactory narrative whole, the language has been modernised into a much more florid style, with all of the spareness of expression of the earlier recension lost in the process.

The Book of Leinster version ends with a colophon in Latin which says:

An incomplete third recension is known from twelfth-century fragments.

==In translation and adaptation==

19th century translations of the work include Bryan O&#x27;Looney&#x27;s translation made in the 1870s, as &quot;Tain Bo Cualnge&quot;, based on the Book of Leinster in Trinity College Library, Dublin. John O&#x27;Daly&#x27;s also translated the work in 1857, but it is considered a poor translation. No published translation of the work was made until the early 20th century – the first English translation was provided L. Winifred Faraday in 1904, based on the Lebor na hUidre and the Yellow Book of Lecan; a German translation by Ernst Windisch was published at around the same time based on the Book of Leinster.

Translated sections of the text had been published in the late 19th century, including one from on the Book of Leinster by Standish Hayes O&#x27;Grady in &quot;The Cuchullin Saga&quot; (ed. Eleanor Hull, 1898), as well as extracts, and introductory text. Lady Gregory&#x27;s &quot;Cuchulain of Muirthemne&quot; (1903) also contains a paraphrased version of the tale. There were also several works based on the tale published in the very late 19th and early 20th century often with a focus on the hero Cú Chulainn, such as &quot;Cuchulain, the Hound of Ulster&quot; (E.Hull, 1911); &quot;Dun Dealgan, Cuchulain&#x27;s Home Fort&quot; (H.G. Tempest, 1910); &quot;Cuchulain of Muirtheimhne&quot; (A.M. Skelly, 1908); &quot;The Coming of Cuculain&quot; (S. O&#x27;Grady, 1894); and several others; additionally a number of prose works from the same period took the tale as basis or inspiration, including works by W. B. Yeats, Aubrey Thomas de Vere, Alice Milligan, George Sigerson, Samuel Ferguson, Charles Leonard Moore, Fiona Macleod, as well as ballad versions from Scotland. Peadar Ua Laoghaire adapted the work as a closet drama, serialized in the &quot;Cork Weekly Examiner&quot; (1900–1).

In 1914 Joseph Dunn authored an English translation &quot;The Ancient Irish Epic Tale Táin Bó Cúalnge&quot; based primarily on the Book of Leinster. Cecile O&#x27;Rahilly published academic editions/translations of both recensions, &quot;Táin Bó Cúalnge from the Book of Leinster&quot; (1967), and &quot;Táin Bó Cúailnge Recension 1&quot; (1976), as well as an edition of the later Stowe Version, &quot;The Stowe version of Táin Bó Cuailnge&quot; (1961).

 two translations by Irish poets are available in mass-market editions: Thomas Kinsella&#x27;s &quot;The Táin&quot; (1969) and Ciarán Carson&#x27;s &quot;The Táin&quot; (2007). Both are based primarily on the first recension with passages added from the second, although they differ slightly in their selection and arrangement of material. Kinsella&#x27;s translation is illustrated by Louis le Brocquy (see Louis le Brocquy Táin illustrations) and also contains translations of a selection of &quot;remscéla&quot;.

Victorian era adapters omitted some aspects of the tale, either for political reasons relating to Irish Nationalism, or to avoid offending the sensibilities of their readers with bodily functions or sex. , focusing on translations and adaptation of &quot;The Táin&quot;, analysed how 19th- and 20th-century writers used the original texts in creating Irish myths as part of the process of decolonization (from the United Kingdom), and so redacted elements that did not show Cuchulain in a suitably heroic light. Not only was sex, and bodily functions removed, but also humor. The version by took on a more &#x27;folkish&#x27; aspect, whereas in O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s version (see ) the protagonists more resembled chivalrous medieval knights.

Several writers bowdlerized the source: for example the naked women sent to attempt to placate Cú Chulainn were omitted by most adapters of the Victorian period, or their nakedness reduced. Others interpreted the tale to their own ends - One of Peadar Ua Laoghaire&#x27;s adaptations of the work, the play &quot;Méibh&quot;, included a temperance message, blaming the conflict over the bull on the drunkenness of the Connacht messengers. In Ua Laoghaire&#x27;s serialization &quot;Medb&quot; retains her role as a powerful woman, but her sexuality, exploitation of her daughter Fionnabhair, and references to menstruation are heavily euphemized. Slightly later works such as &quot;Stories from the Táin&quot; and the derived &quot;Giolla na Tána&quot; were more accurate.

The version by is considered to be the first (English) translation that accurately included both grotesque and sexual aspects of the tale; however the German translation by is considered to be complete, and lacks alterations and omissions due to conflicts of interests in the mind of contemporary Irish scholars.

==&quot;Remscéla&quot;==

The story of the Táin relies on a range of independently transmitted back-stories, known as &quot;remscéla&quot; (&#x27;fore-tales&#x27;). Some may in fact have been composed independently of the &quot;Táin&quot; and subsequently linked with it later in their transmission. As listed by Ruairí Ó hUiginn, they are:

* &quot;De Faillsigud Tána Bó Cuailnge&quot; (How the Táin Bó Cuailnge was found), recounting how the story of the &quot;Táin&quot; was lost and recovered.
* &quot;Táin Bó Regamna&quot; (The cattle raid of Regamain)
* &quot;Táin Bó Regamon&quot; (The cattle raid of Regamon)
* &quot;Táin Bó Fraích&quot; (&#x27;The cattle Raid of Froech&#x27;): Froech mac Idaith is a Connacht warrior, killed by Cú Chulainn in the &quot;Táin&quot;; this tale gives him some back-story.
* &quot;Táin Bó Dartada&quot; (The cattle raid of Dartaid)
* &quot;Táin Bó Flidhais&quot; (&#x27;The cattle raid of Flidais&#x27;), a relatively late story drawing on older material
* &quot;Echtrae Nerai&quot; (&#x27;The Adventure of Nera&#x27;)
* &quot;Aislinge Oengusa&quot; (&#x27;The Dream of Oengus&#x27;). Oengus Mac ind Óc, son of the Dagda has no part in the &quot;Táin Bó Cúailnge&quot; as we have it, but this tale relates how the otherworld woman Caer Ibormeith came to him in a vision how Oengus found her through the aid of Medb and Ailill. According to the story, this is why he helped them in their cattle-raid.
* &quot;Compert Con Culainn&quot; (&#x27;The Conception of Cú Chulainn&#x27;)
* &quot;De Chophur in Dá Mucado&quot; (Of the &quot;cophur&quot; of the two swineherds)
* &quot;Fochann Loingsi Fergusa meic Róig&quot; (The cause of Fergus mac Róich&#x27;s exile), only the beginning of which survives, apparently explaining how Fergus came to be part of the army of Connacht
* &quot;Longas mac nUislenn&quot; (&#x27;The Exile of the Sons of Uisliu&#x27;), explaining how Fergus and various other Ulster exiles came to be in the army of Connacht
* &quot;Tochmarc Ferbe&quot; (The wooing of Ferb).
* &quot;Ces Ulad&quot; (The debility of the Ulstermen), not actually considered one of the &quot;remscéla&quot;, but providing an important account of why Macha curses the Ulaid: they made her race against the king&#x27;s horses while she was pregnant. The tale&#x27;s primary purpose, however, is to provide an etiology for the place-name &quot;Emain Machae&quot;.

==Cultural influence==
: &quot;See Irish mythology in popular culture&quot;

In 1973, the Irish Celtic rock band Horslips released a concept album, &quot;The Táin&quot;, which recounts the story from the points of view of Cú Chulainn, Queen Maeve of Connacht and Ferdia, among others.

In 2004, indie rock band The Decemberists released a five-part single also named &quot;The Tain&quot;, which loosely recounts the story of Táin Bó Cúailnge.

<doc id="387457" wikidata="Q463223" url="?curid=387457" title="Thermohaline circulation">
<text>Thermohaline circulation (THC) is a part of the large-scale ocean circulation that is driven by global density gradients created by surface heat and freshwater fluxes. The adjective &quot;thermohaline&quot; derives from &quot;&quot; referring to temperature and &quot;&quot; referring to salt content, factors which together determine the density of sea water. Wind-driven surface currents (such as the Gulf Stream) travel polewards from the equatorial Atlantic Ocean, cooling en route, and eventually sinking at high latitudes (forming North Atlantic Deep Water). This dense water then flows into the ocean basins. While the bulk of it upwells in the Southern Ocean, the oldest waters (with a transit time of about 1000 years) upwell in the North Pacific. Extensive mixing therefore takes place between the ocean basins, reducing differences between them and making the Earth&#x27;s oceans a global system. The water in these circuits transport both energy (in the form of heat) and mass (dissolved solids and gases) around the globe. As such, the state of the circulation has a large impact on the climate of the Earth.

The thermohaline circulation is sometimes called the ocean conveyor belt, the great ocean conveyor, or the global conveyor belt, coined by climate scientist Wallace Smith Broecker. It is also referred to as the meridional overturning circulation, or &quot;MOC&quot;. This name is used because not every circulation pattern caused by temperature and salinity gradients is necessarily part of a single global circulation. Further, it is difficult to separate the parts of the circulation driven by temperature and salinity alone from those driven by other factors, such as the wind and tidal forces.

This global circulation has two major limbs - Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (&quot;AMOC&quot;), centered in the north Atlantic Ocean, and Southern Ocean overturning circulation or &quot;Southern Ocean meridional circulation&quot; (&quot;SMOC&quot;), around Antarctica. Because 90% of the human population lives in the Northern Hemisphere, the AMOC has been far better studied, but both are very important for the global climate. Both of them also appear to be slowing down due to climate change, as the melting of the ice sheets dilutes salty flows such as the Antarctic bottom water. Either one could outright collapse to a much weaker state, which would be an example of tipping points in the climate system. The hemisphere which experiences the collapse of its circulation would experience less precipitation and become drier, while the other hemisphere would become wetter. Marine ecosystems are also likely to receive fewer nutrients and experience greater ocean deoxygenation. In the Northern Hemisphere, AMOC&#x27;s collapse would also substantially lower the temperatures in many European countries, while the east coast of North America would experience accelerated sea level rise. The collapse of either circulation is generally believed to be more than a century away and may only occur under high warming, but there is a lot of uncertainty about these projections.

== History of research ==

It has long been known that wind can drive ocean currents, but only at the surface. In the 19th century, some oceanographers suggested that the convection of heat could drive deeper currents. In 1908, Johan Sandström performed a series of experiments at a Bornö Marine Research Station which proved that the currents driven by thermal energy transfer can exist, but require that &quot;heating occurs at a greater depth than cooling&quot;. Normally, the opposite occurs, because ocean water is heated from above by the Sun and becomes less dense, so the surface layer floats on the surface above the cooler, denser layers, resulting in ocean stratification. However, wind and tides cause mixing between these water layers, with diapycnal mixing caused by tidal currents being one example. This mixing is what enables the convection between ocean layers, and thus, deep water currents.

In the 1920s, Sandström&#x27;s framework was expanded by accounting for the role of salinity in ocean layer formation. Salinity is important because like temperature, it affects water density. Water becomes less dense as its temperature increases and the distance between its molecules expands, but more dense as the salinity increases, since there is a larger mass of salts dissolved within that water. Further, while fresh water is at its most dense at 4 °C, seawater only gets denser as it cools, up until it reaches the freezing point. That freezing point is also lower than for fresh water due to salinity, and can be below −2 °C, depending on salinity and pressure.

==Structure==

These density differences caused by temperature and salinity ultimately separate ocean water into distinct water masses, such as the North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) and Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW). These two waters are the main drivers of the circulation, which was established in 1960 by Henry Stommel and Arnold B. Arons. They have chemical, temperature and isotopic ratio signatures (such as 231Pa / 230Th ratios) which can be traced, their flow rate calculated, and their age determined. NADW is formed because North Atlantic is a rare place in the ocean where precipitation, which adds fresh water to the ocean and so reduces its salinity, is outweighed by evaporation, in part due to high windiness. When water evaporates, it leaves salt behind, and so the surface waters of the North Atlantic are particularly salty. North Atlantic is also an already cool region, and evaporative cooling reduces water temperature even further. Thus, this water sinks downward in the Norwegian Sea, fills the Arctic Ocean Basin and spills southwards through the Greenland-Scotland-Ridge – crevasses in the submarine sills that connect Greenland, Iceland and Great Britain. It cannot flow towards the Pacific Ocean due to the narrow shallows of the Bering Strait, but it does slowly flow into the deep abyssal plains of the south Atlantic.

In the Southern Ocean, strong katabatic winds blowing from the Antarctic continent onto the ice shelves will blow the newly formed sea ice away, opening polynyas in locations such as Weddell and Ross Seas, off the Adélie Coast and by Cape Darnley. The ocean, no longer protected by sea ice, suffers a brutal and strong cooling (see polynya). Meanwhile, sea ice starts reforming, so the surface waters also get saltier, hence very dense. In fact, the formation of sea ice contributes to an increase in surface seawater salinity; saltier brine is left behind as the sea ice forms around it (pure water preferentially being frozen). Increasing salinity lowers the freezing point of seawater, so cold liquid brine is formed in inclusions within a honeycomb of ice. The brine progressively melts the ice just beneath it, eventually dripping out of the ice matrix and sinking. This process is known as brine rejection. The resulting Antarctic bottom water sinks and flows north and east. It is denser than the NADW, and so flows beneath it. AABW formed in the Weddell Sea will mainly fill the Atlantic and Indian Basins, whereas the AABW formed in the Ross Sea will flow towards the Pacific Ocean. At the Indian Ocean, a vertical exchange of a lower layer of cold and salty water from the Atlantic and the warmer and fresher upper ocean water from the tropical Pacific occurs, in what is known as overturning. In the Pacific Ocean, the rest of the cold and salty water from the Atlantic undergoes haline forcing, and becomes warmer and fresher more quickly.

The out-flowing undersea of cold and salty water makes the sea level of the Atlantic slightly lower than the Pacific and salinity or halinity of water at the Atlantic higher than the Pacific. This generates a large but slow flow of warmer and fresher upper ocean water from the tropical Pacific to the Indian Ocean through the Indonesian Archipelago to replace the cold and salty Antarctic Bottom Water. This is also known as &#x27;haline forcing&#x27; (net high latitude freshwater gain and low latitude evaporation). This warmer, fresher water from the Pacific flows up through the South Atlantic to Greenland, where it cools off and undergoes evaporative cooling and sinks to the ocean floor, providing a continuous thermohaline circulation.

== Upwelling ==

As the deep waters sink into the ocean basins, they displace the older deep-water masses, which gradually become less dense due to continued ocean mixing. Thus, some water is rising, in what is known as upwelling. Its speeds are very slow even compared to the movement of the bottom water masses. It is therefore difficult to measure where upwelling occurs using current speeds, given all the other wind-driven processes going on in the surface ocean. Deep waters have their own chemical signature, formed from the breakdown of particulate matter falling into them over the course of their long journey at depth. A number of scientists have tried to use these tracers to infer where the upwelling occurs. Wallace Broecker, using box models, has asserted that the bulk of deep upwelling occurs in the North Pacific, using as evidence the high values of silicon found in these waters. Other investigators have not found such clear evidence.

Computer models of ocean circulation increasingly place most of the deep upwelling in the Southern Ocean, associated with the strong winds in the open latitudes between South America and Antarctica. 
Direct estimates of the strength of the thermohaline circulation have also been made at 26.5°N in the North Atlantic, by the UK-US RAPID programme. It combines direct estimates of ocean transport using current meters and subsea cable measurements with estimates of the geostrophic current from temperature and salinity measurements to provide continuous, full-depth, basin-wide estimates of the meridional overturning circulation. However, it has only been operating since 2004, which is too short when the timescale of the circulation is measured in centuries.

==Effects on global climate==
The thermohaline circulation plays an important role in supplying heat to the polar regions, and thus in regulating the amount of sea ice in these regions, although poleward heat transport outside the tropics is considerably larger in the atmosphere than in the ocean. Changes in the thermohaline circulation are thought to have significant impacts on the Earth&#x27;s radiation budget.

Large influxes of low-density meltwater from Lake Agassiz and deglaciation in North America are thought to have led to a shifting of deep water formation and subsidence in the extreme North Atlantic and caused the climate period in Europe known as the Younger Dryas.

<text>The La&#x27;s were an English rock band from Liverpool, originally active from 1983 until 1992. Fronted by singer, songwriter and guitarist Lee Mavers, the group are best known for their hit single &quot;There She Goes&quot;. The band was formed by Mike Badger in 1983 and Mavers joined the next year, although for most of the group&#x27;s history, the frequently changing line-up revolved around the core duo of Lee Mavers (vocals, guitar) and John Power (bass, backing vocals) along with numerous other guitarists and drummers including Paul Hemmings, John &quot;Timmo&quot; Timson, Peter &quot;Cammy&quot; Cammell, Iain Templeton, John &quot;Boo&quot; Byrne, Chris Sharrock, and Neil Mavers.

After the departure of Badger in late 1986, the band signed to Go! Discs in 1987 and started recording their debut album. Following the release of singles &quot;Way Out&quot; (1987), &quot;There She Goes&quot; (1988) and &quot;Timeless Melody&quot; (1990) and having aborted several recording sessions with different producers, the band released their debut album, &quot;The La&#x27;s&quot;, in 1990 to critical acclaim and modest commercial success. John Power left The La&#x27;s to form Cast and the group entered a prolonged hiatus in 1992. The group later reformed briefly in the mid-1990s, 2005 and 2011. However, no new recordings have been released.

==History==

===1983–1986: Formation and early years===
The La&#x27;s formed in 1983, with original member Mike Badger stating that the band name occurred to him in a dream, as well as it being Scouse for &quot;lads&quot; (&quot;La&#x27;&quot; is just an abbreviation for &quot;lad&quot;, so &quot;The La&#x27;s&quot; simply means &quot;The Lads&quot;) and also having obvious musical connotations. The band existed briefly as an arthouse/skiffle-type outfit with a few tracks released on local compilations. Lee Mavers joined in 1984 as rhythm guitarist, eventually gaining songwriting prominence and emerging as the band&#x27;s enduring figurehead. Bernie Nolan, accomplished musician formerly of the Falcons, The Russian Rockabillys and The Swampmen was the original bassist. John Power joined the group in 1986, having met Badger on a local council-run musicianship course. Badger left the group in late 1986 to form the Onset.

The band attracted the attention of several record labels after a series of performances in their hometown in 1986, and demo tapes copied from a session at the Flying Picket rehearsal studio in Liverpool began circulating. One of these demo tapes was sent to Underground Magazine. A journalist there with the task of reviewing unsigned bands gave the cassette to Andy McDonald at Go Discs. Several record labels later became interested in signing the band. The band chose to sign with Go! Discs.

===1987–1990: Record deal and &quot;The La&#x27;s&quot; album===
The band&#x27;s first single, &quot;Way Out&quot;, was mixed with producer Gavin MacKillop. When it was released in October 1987, it broke into the top 100 and was praised by the Smiths&#x27; frontman Morrissey in the music magazine &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, but attracted little notice. The band continued to perform around the UK and gained success as a live act, drawing comparisons to the Beatles due to their origins, vaguely Merseybeat sound, and Mavers&#x27; expressive lyrics. &quot;There She Goes&quot; was released in 1988 with the B-sides &quot;Come in Come Out&quot; and &quot;Who Knows&quot;. The song garnered moderate attention and airplay, but performed poorly in the charts. The music video for &quot;There She Goes&quot; features the La&#x27;s scampering through run-down Liverpool streets and was filmed in an afternoon on a hand-held camera. It was re-released a number of times, the earliest being 1990&#x27;s Steve Lillywhite mix. After working with producer Jeremy Allom at the Pink Museum Studio in Liverpool in May 1989, the band were set to release &quot;Timeless Melody&quot; as a single. While test pressings had been sent out for review, and it was awarded &quot;single of the week&quot; in &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, Mavers was reportedly unhappy with the production and the single release was scrapped.

The La&#x27;s then spent two years fruitlessly recording and re-recording their intended debut album, with a constantly changing band line-up, where only the core of Mavers and Power remained the same. Discarded producers included The Smiths&#x27; producer John Porter, as well as John Leckie and Mike Hedges. Both Leckie and Hedges have nevertheless spoken positively in interviews about the band&#x27;s songs and their respective sessions. The previously volatile band line-up settled in 1989 with Lee&#x27;s brother, Neil Mavers on drums, and Peter &quot;Cammy&quot; Cammell as lead guitarist. The group then entered London&#x27;s Eden Studios in December 1989 to again record their debut album with Simple Minds and U2 producer Steve Lillywhite. Despite this line-up being arguably the most stable, and press interviews from the time painting them as extremely confident, the sessions still did not satisfy Mavers. In one instance Mavers was reported to have rejected a vintage mixing desk, claiming it did not have the right sound because &quot;it hasn&#x27;t got original Sixties dust on it&quot;, although this claim has since been revealed as apocryphal. The Eden sessions with Lillywhite would become the band&#x27;s final attempt at recording the album. The frustration of not achieving the right sound and mood in their songs, as well as increasing friction with Go! Discs, who had spent considerable money on recording sessions for the album, led to them simply giving up on the sessions. Lillywhite pieced together the recordings he had made with the group into what became the eventually released album. The band, particularly Lee Mavers, were not pleased with this decision. Among the band&#x27;s complaints were that Lillywhite used vocal guide tracks on the LP and that he did not &quot;understand&quot; their sound. In an October 1990 &quot;NME&quot; interview with Stuart Maconie, Mavers said that he &quot;hated&quot; the album because of the sound, which was &quot;All f---ed up like a snake with a broken back&quot;.

However, recognition, at least critically, came for the La&#x27;s in 1990 when the self-titled album, &quot;The La&#x27;s&quot;, was released. The album reached No. 30 in the UK charts and received a Silver certification, but the album did not fare as well overseas. The album only reached No. 196 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and to date has sold fewer than 50,000 copies in the U.S. The album included, among new material, re-recorded versions of all the previous singles, including a remixed version of &quot;There She Goes&quot; which was then re-released as a single. This time around, the song reached number 13 in the UK singles chart and remains the most visible and enduring of all the band&#x27;s songs. Additional singles from the album included the LP versions of &quot;Timeless Melody&quot; and &quot;Feelin&#x27;&quot;. Both sold reasonably well, reaching chart placings around the top 40. A short promotional tour proceeded, accompanied by television appearances on shows such as &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;.

===1991–2003: John Power&#x27;s departure and hiatus===
1991 promotional tour dates were fulfilled in the UK and Europe including a few festivals, and a US tour. Bassist John Power left the group on 13 December 1991, frustrated with having played essentially the same set of songs since 1986, and resurfaced a year later with his band Cast. The remainder of the 1991 concerts were performed with James Joyce on bass as well as a handful of 1992 dates. The band stopped touring and rehearsing in 1992 until further short-lived reunions, with various line-ups, throughout the 1990s and 2000s.

The La&#x27;s reunited sporadically for a series of live performances throughout 1994 and 1995. The comeback was brought about due to a merchandising debt from the 1991 U.S. tour and the band played support slots to artists such as Oasis, Paul Weller and Dodgy. The reformed band consisted of differing line-ups for each concert and as well as Lee Mavers other performers included several former members such as Barry Sutton, Lee Garnett, John &quot;Boo&quot; Byrne, James Joyce, Peter &quot;Cammy&quot; Cammell and Neil Mavers.

In 1996, Mavers began recording at The Arch studio in Kew, London owned by ex-the Damned drummer Rat Scabies. Initially working alone, he was later joined in the studio by ex-the Stairs frontman Edgar Jones, Lee Garnett and Neil Mavers. The sessions ended because of damp in the studio, however Mavers and Summertyme continued to rehearse and record in Liverpool for a year. After the collapse of Go! Discs, Mavers recording contract with the label was acquired by PolyGram and eventually expired in 1998. In 1998, Mavers began rehearsing with the then unsigned Liverpool band the Crescent. A bootleg recording of one of these rehearsals known as The Crescent Tape would later leak on to the Internet.

In the late 1990s, Mavers renewed contact with founder member Mike Badger and subsequently two compilation albums of early demos and home recordings were released by The Viper Label (founded by ex-La&#x27;s Badger and Hemmings), &quot;Lost La&#x27;s 1984–1986: Breakloose&quot; (1999) and &quot;Lost La&#x27;s 1986–1987: Callin&#x27; All&quot; (2001). A Japan only compilation album &quot;Singles Collection&quot; (2001) was released by Universal Music Japan containing all of the band&#x27;s singles and b-sides released from 1987 to 1991. A biography about the band &quot;In Search of The La&#x27;s: A Secret Liverpool&quot; by MW Macefield was published in 2003. The book contained interviews with many former members of the La&#x27;s including Lee Mavers, John Power, Mike Badger, Paul Hemmings, Barry Sutton, Peter &quot;Cammy&quot; Cammell and Neil Mavers.

===2004–2011: Reformations===
Following a reunion between Mavers and John Power, The La&#x27;s reformed in June 2005 with a line-up of Lee Mavers (vocals, guitar), John Power (bass, backing vocals), ex-Cracatilla frontman Jay Lewis (guitar) and Nick Miniski (drums), playing dates in England and Ireland ahead of an appearance at the Summer Sonic festival in Japan as well as a spot at the 2005 Glastonbury Festival and other UK festivals. After three concerts, Miniski was replaced as drummer by roadie Jim &quot;Jasper&quot; Fearon, who was Mavers&#x27; school friend and one time bass player for the La&#x27;s. The set lists were mostly the same as in the late 1980s, although certain encores contained some previously unheard songs such as &quot;Gimme the Blues&quot; and &quot;Sorry&quot;. Since the reunion gigs it has been rumoured that Mavers has continued working on the La&#x27;s&#x27; elusive second album. When interviewed in August 2006, John Power explained that Mavers was still &quot;tinkering with something that&#x27;s majestic&quot; and of the release date, &quot;I can’t tell you where and when...&#x27; cos whatever he does, whether it’s in this lifetime or the next, it can’t be rushed&quot;.

A compilation of the La&#x27;s&#x27; live radio sessions &quot;BBC in Session&quot; was released on 18 September 2006. In 2008, a new deluxe edition of &quot;The La&#x27;s&quot; was released containing the lost Mike Hedges album, alternate recordings and live recordings for radio and television including previously unreleased songs &quot;I Am the Key&quot; and a Buddy Holly cover &quot;That&#x27;ll Be the Day&quot;. Also &quot;Lost Tunes&quot; (2008) was released as a download only EP of studio out-takes and alternate recordings.

After being introduced to each other by Gary Murphy of the Bandits, Lee Mavers began jamming with Pete Doherty in 2008 and appeared on stage with Doherty during his 2009 tour. Mavers then started performing live with artists such as Drew McConnell and Jon McClure in London in April 2009. In 2009 Babyshambles drummer Adam Ficek revealed plans of the La&#x27;s&#x27; second album to be recorded with the Babyshambles as backing band and Drew McConnell revealed plans for him to join the La&#x27;s as bassist; this supposed lineup did not materialise and live appearances were cancelled. In 2010, a four-disc box-set of singles, b-sides, studio out-takes, alternate recordings and live material &quot;Callin&#x27; All&quot; (2010) was released by Polydor which collected most of the band&#x27;s still unreleased recordings produced whilst signed to Go! Discs.

In June 2011 Lee Mavers, accompanied by Gary Murphy on bass guitar, played a surprise concert in Manchester under the name Lee Rude &amp; The Velcro Underpants. Following this Mavers and Murphy reformed the La&#x27;s and played a series of &quot;stripped back&quot; shows across the UK and Europe including a performance at Rock en Seine festival in France in August 2011.

==Musical style and legacy==

Lee Mavers has described their sound as &quot;rootsy&quot; and &quot;raw and organic&quot;, whilst AllMusic have noted the band&#x27;s &quot;simple, tuneful, acoustic-driven arrangements&quot;. The La&#x27;s were also noted for their distinctly different style to other popular British bands in the late 1980s, such as the Stone Roses and Happy Mondays, who were part of the Madchester movement.

The sound of the La&#x27;s has been compared to that of Merseybeat and 1960s British rock music, and the band received comparisons with the earlier Liverpudlian band the Beatles. Founding member Mike Badger has named Captain Beefheart as the La&#x27;s&#x27; main influence; the band have also cited artists such as Bo Diddley, Bob Dylan, Louis Armstrong, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Who, the Kinks, Bob Marley, Pink Floyd, Jimi Hendrix, Duke Ellington, and Ella Fitzgerald as influences.

&quot;Pitchfork&quot; named &quot;The La&#x27;s&quot; as one of the best Britpop albums, placing the album at #14 in their 50 Best Britpop Albums list. Noel Gallagher of Oasis named it as one of his 13 favourite albums, and they have been cited as an influence by the Courteeners, the Stone Roses, the Charlatans, the Libertines and the 1975.

==Post-La&#x27;s activities==

Bassist John Power went on to form Cast in 1992, releasing 4 studio albums before splitting in 2001. Guitarists Barry Sutton and Peter Cammell featured in an early lineup of the band. Cast reformed in 2010. In 2016, Jay Lewis who performed with the band in 2005, later joined Cast as bassist.

Mike Badger and Paul Hemmings later played together in the Onset and started The Viper Label, releasing many early recording compilations by the La&#x27;s.

In the mid-&#x27;90s, Neil Mavers joined Liverpool group Bullit, featuring David McDonnell, later of the Sand Band.

In 1998, Cammell and drummer Neil Mavers continued to work together after the La&#x27;s&#x27; breakup under the name Cami. The band was managed by former La&#x27;s and then-current Cast manager, Rob Swerdlow. The band recorded a nine-track album with future Coldplay producer Ken Nelson at Parr Street Studios in October 1999, but the band split up leaving the album unreleased. The album tapes re-surfaced in October 2015, with plans for a near-future release. In common with many tapes from the 90s and earlier they had become sticky and required baking to restore the oxide binder to its original condition and make them playable; this was carried out at London&#x27;s FX Copyroom.

Neil Mavers and Cammell briefly reunited once more in 2002, performing with another former La&#x27;s member, guitarist Barry Sutton in Heavy Lemon. The band played three shows in 18 months before disbanding. Cammell also performed with Sutton again in his jam-style project Beatnik Hurricane in 2015, playing dates in Liverpool, including residencies at The Everyman Bistro and a tour of Ireland, most notably a sold-out show in Dublin.

In 2015, previous recordings and demos by Cammell&#x27;s band surfaced online (most notably the song &quot;Make A Chain&quot;), which led to Cammell forming a new band named Cami &amp; the Reverbs, managed by La&#x27;s associate Chris Parkes. The band consisted of Mick Marshall (guitar, the Joneses) Phil Murphy (drums, the Red Elastic Band) Leon De Sylva (drums, Electrafixion), Daniel Lunt (bass), David &#x27;Swee&#x27; Sweeney (drums, the Bandits), and Mark McInnes (bass, the Levons). Cami &amp; the Reverbs played sporadic shows across Liverpool including a support slot with Liverpool group Rain and a Christmas Show at The Zanzibar.

In 2018, a BBC TV comedy-drama series entitled &quot;There She Goes&quot; features a cover version of the La&#x27;s song of that name.

<doc id="387462" wikidata="Q1387227" url="?curid=387462" title="Alternative DNS root">
<text>The Internet uses the Domain Name System (DNS) to associate numeric computer IP addresses with human-readable names. The top level of the domain name hierarchy, the DNS root, contains the top-level domains that appear as the suffixes of all Internet domain names. The most widely used (and first) DNS root is administered by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). In addition, several organizations operate alternative DNS roots, often referred to as alt roots. These alternative domain name systems operate their own root name servers and commonly administer their own specific name spaces consisting of custom top-level domains.

The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) has spoken out strongly against alternative roots in .

==Overview==
The DNS root zone consists of pointers to the authoritative domain name servers for all top-level domains (TLDs). The root zone is hosted on a collection of root servers operated by several organizations around the world that all use a specific, approved list of domains that is managed by ICANN. By contrast, alternative roots typically include pointers to all of the TLD servers for domains delegated by ICANN, as well as name servers for other, custom top-level domains that are not sanctioned by ICANN. Some alternative roots are operated by the organizations that manage these alternative TLDs.

Zach Bastick proposes that alternative DNS roots have allowed for more democratic control of the Internet:

Unless one specifically changes their DNS resolution settings, alternative DNS top level domains are generally unreachable, and very few Internet service providers provide this configuration by default.

==Implementations==
Some organizations provide alternative DNS root services, such as additional top-level domains.

=== Handshake ===
&quot;Handshake&quot; is a decentralized implementation of a DNS root zone using blockchain and cryptocurrency technology to create a peer-to-peer alternative to the 13 root name servers managed by ICANN.

Unlike other attempts, Handshake does not aim to replace the existing DNS; rather, it seeks to supplement and enhance it by allowing anyone to bid, register, and manage their own TLDs without an intermediate registrar or delegating authority. Since the root zone file records are not centrally managed, and instead are stored on a public blockchain, owners of Handshake TLDs can add or change top-level resource records to delegate authoritative name servers and set up DNSSEC zone signing directly.

Existing TLDs are reserved in the Handshake blockchain such that resolving traditional domain names (i.e. zones under .com, .org, .net, etc.) through a Handshake node or name server are directed back to ICANN&#x27;s root servers. In addition, the top 100,000 most popular domains are reserved as Handshake TLDs which can be redeemed by the original domain owner.

===Namecoin===

&quot;Namecoin&quot; is a blockchain and cryptocurrency to support the alternative top-level domain .bit.

===OpenNIC===

OpenNIC is a user owned and controlled alternative to InterNIC and ICANN providing a non-national democratic alternative to traditional domain registries. OpenNIC servers are able to resolve all ICANN top-level domains, some OpenNIC original top-level domains, and the resolution of other Alternate DNS Roots with which they have reached peering agreements.

===Yeti DNS Project===
Yeti DNS Project is an attempt to build an alternative root server dedicated to IPv6. Sponsored by a Chinese state agency, the project aims at experimenting with different new DNS-related technology and enabling sovereign countries to explore and control the internet and enhance their network sovereignty.

===.chn===
.chn is a new top-level domain with its own root DNS server for an Internet of Things (IoT) network in China. The company developing this alternative root claims that China has its own intellectual right on this new alternative domain name root and the associated IoT network, and that it will become the second computer network in the world. It is claimed to be part of a &quot;IPv9&quot; decimal network/numeric domain name system developed and innovated in China.

===Russian National Domain Name System===

The Russian National Domain Name System () is an alternative DNS root project started in 2019 by Roskomnadzor, a government department, and is to gradually become mandatory for all ISPs in Russia. As of March 2021, servers are located on the Moscow Internet Exchange. The mission of the project is to provide an alternative DNS root for all users of the Internet within Russia. The main goal is to continue the functioning of the Russian Internet subnetwork in case of its disconnection from the rest of the Internet (Sovereign Internet Law).

==Defunct implementations==

===Open Root Server Network (ORSN)===

Open Root Server Network (ORSN) was a network of Domain Name System root nameservers for the Internet. ORSN root zone information was normally kept in synchronization with the &quot;official&quot; root nameservers coordinated by ICANN. ORSN Public DNS Servers were operated by the community of ORSN, providing Domain Name System access freely for everyone, without any limitation. ORSN public DNS servers did not log usage. &quot;The ORSN project was canceled on May 2019 and will never come back.&quot; 

===AlterNIC===

AlterNIC was created before ICANN&#x27;s creation to challenge the monopoly of InterNIC on domain name governance at the time.

===eDNS===
eDNS (Enhanced Domain Name Service) was founded by a coalition of ISPs led by Karl Denninger of the Chicago-area MCSNet. It ceased operation in 1998. It served the following domains: biz (general business use), corp (corporations), fam (for and about family), k12 (for and about children), npo (non-profit organizations), per (personal domains), web (web-based sites, Web pages).

===Open RSC===
One of the notable challengers to ICANN&#x27;s control of the DNS namespace was &quot;Open RSC&quot; (&quot;Open Root Server Confederation&quot;), a group that grew out of private discussions and developed into a public mailing list. It grew large enough that the group decided to submit an application to the United States government to run the DNS.

The organization posted bylaws and articles of incorporation outlining ORSC&#x27;s position following extensive public discussion regarding the manner in which the DNS was operated.

ICANN chairwoman Esther Dyson acknowledged adopting features such as membership from ORSC in her response to the United States Department of Commerce.

ORSC publishes a root zone containing additional top level domains not found in the ICANN root zone.

===RealNames===
Microsoft offered the RealNames service on its Internet Explorer browser address bar. RealNames, to users of Internet Explorer, was in effect a domain registry. RealNames shut down operations in 2002 following a decision by Microsoft to redirect the 1 billion page views per calendar quarter that RealNames was resolving from the browser address bar into its MSN search engine.

<doc id="387463" wikidata="Q780072" url="?curid=387463" title="Cast (band)">
<text>Cast are an English indie rock band formed in Liverpool in 1992 by John Power (vocals, guitar) and Peter Wilkinson (bass, backing vocals) after Power left The La&#x27;s and Wilkinson&#x27;s former band Shack had split. Following early line-ups with different guitarists and drummers, Liam &quot;Skin&quot; Tyson (guitar) and Keith O&#x27;Neill (drums) joined Cast in 1993.

Emerging from the Britpop movement of the mid-1990s, Cast signed to Polydor Records and their debut album &quot;All Change&quot; (1995) became the highest selling debut album for the label. Further commercial success continued with the albums &quot;Mother Nature Calls&quot; (1997) and &quot;Magic Hour&quot; (1999), however a departure in sound on the band&#x27;s fourth album &quot;Beetroot&quot; (2001) was met by a poor critical and commercial reaction and contributed to the band&#x27;s split two weeks after its release.

The band re-formed in November 2010 and released their fifth album &quot;Troubled Times&quot; in November 2011. Bassist Peter Wilkinson confirmed his departure from the band in March 2015, after abruptly leaving a previous tour in December 2014. He was replaced on that tour and in the band by Power&#x27;s frequent collaborator Jay Lewis, who would also feature on their sixth album &quot;Kicking Up the Dust&quot;, which was released on 21 April 2017. The band would later officially become a trio of Power, Tyson and O&#x27;Neill – with Lewis reverting back to touring bassist – during the recording of their seventh album, 2024&#x27;s &quot;Love Is the Call&quot;.

Noel Gallagher of Oasis described watching the band live as being like a &quot;religious experience&quot; and they were labelled &quot;The Who of the 90s&quot;. It has been suggested that the name &quot;Cast&quot; was taken from the final word on The La&#x27;s eponymous album (the song &quot;Looking Glass&quot; ends with the repeated line &quot;The change is cast&quot;); John Power has since confirmed this to be true, despite previously playing the link down to coincidence.

==History==

===1992–1994: Formation and early years===
John Power was previously the bass player, backing vocalist and only constant member along with Lee Mavers in The La&#x27;s. He left the band on 13 December 1991 after becoming frustrated with the ever-increasing number of aborted studio sessions, having played essentially the same set of songs since 1986 and emerging as a songwriter in his own right. Power later commented that by that point he was more interested in his own songs &quot;than anyone else&#x27;s&quot;.

Having switched from bass to rhythm guitar whilst residing at Brucklay House – a near derelict squat in Mossley Hill, where the seeds of dance label 3 Beat Records were sown, Power began jamming with friends and with an ever-changing line-up began to form Cast. The first addition to the band was ex-Shack bassist Peter Wilkinson who had seen Power performing acoustically at a free festival in Liverpool, and who Power had seen around town. Embryonic lineups of the band, featuring several guitarists including Ged Malley, ex-La&#x27;s members Barry Sutton and Cammy and drummer Russell Brady started gigging in mid 1992 and supported the likes of Pele and The Stairs. Power would later state that he was never happy with these lineups. Unhappy with the band and the demos recorded with Who sound engineer Bob Pridden, he split the band up and extricated himself from his Go! Discs contract in Summer 1993, with whom he was still signed to following his departure from The La&#x27;s and set about forming a new lineup with Wilkinson.

The first new member to be recruited was Keith O&#x27;Neill who had previously played in The Empty Hours, The Windmills and Tommy Scott&#x27;s pre-Space band The Australians and who Power had seen playing in local band The Windmills, fronted by Howie Payne later of The Stands and then guitarist Liam &#x27;Skin&#x27; Tyson, who Wilkinson knew from college and had previously played in Pyramid Dream. When approached to join the band, Tyson initially declined as he had sold all of his musical equipment to teach canoeing at an outdoor centre in Alston in Cumbria. Tyson, who witnessed one of the band&#x27;s early London shows and commented that &quot;John had these songs, but not the band&quot;, joined the band in November 1993 and the new lineup played their first gig in Hull in January 1994.
Within months the band secured high-profile support slots with Elvis Costello on two UK tours, including 2 nights at the Royal Albert Hall and Oasis. It was during the tour with Oasis that Polydor head of A&amp;R Paul Adam, surprised that the band had not already been snapped up, approached the band to sign them. The band signed to Polydor on 13 December 1994, three years to the day that Power left The La&#x27;s.

===1995–1998: Record deal and success===
The band released their debut single &quot;Finetime&quot; in July 1995, which went straight in at No. 17. The follow-up single &quot;Alright&quot;, a song originally written and performed a handful of times whilst still in The La&#x27;s under the original title &quot;Fly On&quot; became the band&#x27;s first Top 15 hit in the UK, peaking at No. 13 in the singles chart.

The band&#x27;s debut album &quot;All Change&quot;, released October 1995 was produced by John Leckie who had previously worked with The Stone Roses and The Verve and had also previously worked with Power in The La&#x27;s. The album shot to No. 7 in the UK charts, reaching double platinum and went on to become the fastest selling debut album in the history of the Polydor label, outselling the likes of The Jimi Hendrix Experience, The Who and The Jam. A further two singles were taken from the album in &quot;Sandstorm&quot; (#8) and &quot;Walkaway&quot; (#9), both top ten hits.

A stand-alone single was released in October 1996 titled &quot;Flying&quot;, which reached No. 4 on the UK singles chart, giving the band their highest chart position in the UK yet.

With their second album &quot;Mother Nature Calls&quot;, released April 1997 the &quot;rockier material was now sounding looser and cockier in a Stonesy or Faces-ish way and the moodier tracks awash with melancholic atmosphere&quot;. The band worked again with John Leckie. The album peaked at No. 3, reaching platinum and stayed in the Top 40 for over 6 months. The album spawned three top ten hits in &quot;Free Me&quot; (#7), &quot;Guiding Star&quot; (#9), &quot;Live the Dream&quot; (#7) and one top twenty hit with the 4th single from the album &quot;I&#x27;m So Lonely&quot; (#14), a ballad written during a period of bleak loneliness in a Japanese hotel room.
Power revealed that the album title was supposed to be tongue in cheek, because &quot;Mother Nature&quot; is always calling because of man&#x27;s mortality, but also because he was on the toilet at the time he came up with the name. Although The Daily Telegraph proclaimed &quot;Employing the spiritual terms of Power&#x27;s lyrics, Cast may be the perfect Taoist band. They don&#x27;t seem to try. Cast just are.&quot;, the album received largely mixed reviews in the press, Power later blamed this on the fact that it was more of a slow burner than the more instant &quot;All Change&quot; and claimed that a number of critics later told him that repeated listens had changed their perceptions of the album.

===1999–2001: Post-Britpop and split===
By the time the band set to work on their third album, &quot;Magic Hour&quot;, released May 1999 the Britpop movement was faltering – a number of Cast&#x27;s contemporaries, such as Kula Shaker and The Seahorses had disbanded, Suede and Mansun were experiencing a drop in record sales from their previous efforts and label mates Shed Seven and Medal had been dropped by Polydor. Amid the changing musical climate, the band enlisted Gil Norton who had previously produced The Pixies and the band moved towards a heavier riff based sound. Power described the album as &quot;21st century rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll&quot; and &quot;Walt Disney doing Quadrophenia&quot;.

The first single from &quot;Magic Hour&quot; was &quot;Beat Mama&quot;, with the band using loops and samples on the record for the first to give the material a more modern feel, Power described the song as &quot;a call to everyone, a beat for everyone to move to, like the old Kia-Ora advert with the dog and the crows&quot;. The song became the band&#x27;s last top ten hit, peaking at No. 9. In a chart now awash with teen pop the album shot to No. 6. A second and final single was taken from the album &quot;Magic Hour&quot;, which stalled at No. 28. Momentum was lost due to a lack of touring and Power also later criticised the choice of single, suggesting the band should have gone with something more uptempo. A planned third single was scrapped after disagreements between the band and label. Following the release and short lived promotion of the album, Power stated that he believed with three albums under Cast&#x27;s belt that a chapter had finished.

Power began writing in early 2000 for the follow-up, &quot;Beetroot&quot;, released July 2001. Although the band were initially set to work with John Leckie, Power met producer and programmer Tristin Norwell who he was interested in working with, as he was &quot;up on now, the sounds of now and someone who I can talk to with an acoustic&quot;. The pair worked on the album together for 3 months before moving to another studio, where other members of the band contributed. Bassist Peter Wilkinson was not present for much of the recording due to the birth of his son, guitarist Skin Tyson mostly featured only as rhythm guitarist and most of the drums were cut up and looped. The album was based largely on loops and featured heavy use of horns and flutes and deliberately moved away from the bands guitar sound, as Power claimed the band &quot;wanted to come back with something that feels fresh and enticing&quot;, describing the material as being groovier and talked of having a desire of &quot;combining this sort of Marley and funkadelic stuff or Sly and the Family that I&#x27;ll get into as much as I get into Townshend and Lennon&quot;.

Only one single was released from the album, &quot;Desert Drought&quot; which stalled at No. 45 in the charts. The album fared worse, crawling to No. 78. Following the cancellation of a planned UK Autumn tour due to &quot;internal band circumstances&quot;, Cast split in August 2001 just one month after the release of the album. It had been rumoured in the UK tabloid press that the band had been dropped by Polydor and that Power had walked out of the band. However, a spokesman for the band at the time denied the band were splitting, that they were merely taking time out to work on solo projects. John Power released a statement to deny any rifts in the band and that this was &quot;just the beginning of a new musical chapter&quot;, but would later admit that there were many internal differences in the band by the end, that &quot;some of the band didn&#x27;t like it (the album &quot;Beetroot&quot;) and looking back, it should have been a solo album&quot; and that half of the band didn&#x27;t want to be involved any more. In 2013, Power admitted that the album was &quot;still a slight bone of contention with the rest of the band. They&#x27;ve never got over it&quot;.

Power revealed that &quot;when Cast split, it was the same as when The La&#x27;s fell apart. You pretend everything is okay, but it&#x27;s not. I was really down, really depressed&quot;.

===2001–2009: After split===
Following the split, John Power released a solo album entitled &quot;Happening For Love&quot; in 2003 through Eagle Rock Entertainment and 2 further solo albums more in the acoustic folk vein through Tanuki Tanuki, a label set up by former La&#x27;s A&amp;R man and his then manager Jona Cox. He has toured regularly as The John Power Band (which has featured Steve Pilgrim of The Stands and Jay Lewis and Nick Miniski of the 2005 lineup of The La&#x27;s) as well as performing solo acoustic shows. In 2005, Power played a series of gigs with newly re-formed The La&#x27;s. The band didn&#x27;t showcase any new material and have not been heard from again.

Peter Wilkinson, along with the band&#x27;s live keyboardist Paul Ellison joined Echo &amp; The Bunnymen and appeared on the 2005 album Siberia before leaving shortly after to rejoin the re-formed Shack. In 2002 he released a solo album via The Viper Label under the guise of Aviator with help from O&#x27;Neill, Paul Ellison and former La&#x27;s guitarist Paul Hemmings. In 2003 Wilkinson and O&#x27;Neill briefly joined Kealer with Manchester singer-songwriter Jason Kelly and then set to work with ex-Stairs guitarist Carl Cook on a follow-up to the first Aviator album in early 2004 which was seemingly shelved. He then formed the short lived DC-10.
Wilkinson has also recorded and toured with a number of other artists including Ian McCulloch and The Hours and more recently has started composing music for TV commercials.

Keith O&#x27;Neill, following stints with Aviator and Kealer went on to work as part of the management team at Deltasonic Records before going on to work as a tour and production manager with bands such as the now-defunct Liverpool band Dead 60s, Babyshambles, Art Garfunkel, Lostprophets. and Foals.

Liam Tyson joined Robert Plant&#x27;s band, Strange Sensation in early 2002, touring Plant&#x27;s album Dreamland before appearing on and co-writing the follow-up Mighty ReArranger. He then set about working on his Men From Mars project in 2004, originally set to feature Wilkinson and O&#x27;Neill, with others members of Strange Sensation.

===2010–present: Reunion===
Power undertook a &quot;Cast Acoustic Show&quot; tour in June 2010, where he played a set of Cast songs along with new tracks written over the past year for a potential new Cast album. On 22 June, it was officially announced by &quot;NME&quot; that the band were to re-form, with plans to work on new material. The band toured the UK in November and December to mark the 15th anniversary of &quot;All Change&quot;. A deluxe edition of &quot;All Change&quot; was released on 25 October that year, to tie in with the re-union and 15th anniversary of the album, containing the original album re-mastered plus b-sides, outtakes, demos and live recordings.

On 6 November, John Power appeared on British TV show &quot;Soccer AM&quot;, and stated that Cast would be starting work on a new album in early 2011, and that it would be released via Pledgemusic.

Cast released their fifth studio album, &quot;Troubled Times&quot;, produced by John Leckie, initially as a download to pledgers through Pledgemusic on 2 November 2011, with a physical release in March 2012. The album featured drummer Steve Pilgrim, who also completed a short tour with the band in December 2011, due to O&#x27;Neill unable to take part in recording and touring due to work commitments as a tour manager. In response to a fan&#x27;s query on Twitter, he stated that a tour in early 2012 should feature the original line-up unless he is &quot;called upon by a major client&quot;.

The band released new song &quot;Baby Blue Eyes&quot; as a free download on 13 November 2014 from an as yet unrecorded and untitled album due for release in 2015. The band embarked on a UK tour in December 2014, with Steve Pilgrim once again filling in on drums for Keith O&#x27;Neill. Peter Wilkinson abruptly left the tour after the first night of the tour in Hull due to &quot;personal reasons&quot;, and was replaced the following night by former La&#x27;s guitarist Jay Lewis. O&#x27;Neill re-joined the band on the tour on 14 December, following the cancellation of the remainder of Johnny Marr&#x27;s US tour which he was tour managing. During the tour, Power commented that Wilkinson &quot;won&#x27;t be back for a while he has some personal issues&quot;.

In March 2015, Wilkinson confirmed he had left the band and therefore wouldn&#x27;t be working on their forthcoming album or touring with the band, stating that &quot;without going into too much detail, I don&#x27;t really want to do it any more&quot; and added that &quot;they play the same set we were playing twenty years ago and I just thought &quot;I can&#x27;t do that any more - I can&#x27;t engage with it&quot;. Power responded, stating that &quot;we can all breathe easier in the knowledge that all those moments of second guessing and all them feelings of negativity. The toxic and uncreative atmosphere where everyone was feeling something&#x27;s not quite right were indeed actually quite right. So the weight of carting a problem from room to room has been lifted and Pete can liberate himself and liberate the rest of us from what was becoming a drag and we can get on with being a band and recording new material as opposed to trying placate someone whose body language was telling us something right from the off and that was Pete had bigger issues to deal with other than dealing with Cast.&quot;

Despite Wilkinson&#x27;s departure from Cast, he would still involve his former band-mates in his project Aviator, with O&#x27;Neill on drums for live shows and Tyson contributing guitar on &quot;The Gift&quot;. In May 2017, Wilkinson also tweeted that he had spent a couple of hours with Power, and Power confirmed the amicable nature of their encounter. Meanwhile, Cast resumed recording and touring with Jay Lewis as a full member of the band, with Power crediting Lewis as helping the band regain its creativity.

In November 2015, the band set up a Pledge Music campaign to fund the recording of their next studio album which was due for release in April 2016. The same year, the band signed to Creation Management, the newly formed music management company run by Alan McGee and Simon Fletcher. The album was delayed due to scheduling conflicts and continued work in the studio, and the band&#x27;s sixth studio album &quot;Kicking Up the Dust&quot; was eventually released 21 April 2017. A band member had incorrectly claimed the main reason for the delay was that they had signed a major label record deal with Warner Music Group, but in fact they had self-financed the distribution of the album using Warners owned distribution network Alternative Distribution Alliance and remain unsigned.

Due to Tyson&#x27;s touring commitments with Robert Plant to promote the latter&#x27;s latest album &quot;Carry Fire&quot; (which includes several songs co-written by Tyson), he was unable to participate in Cast&#x27;s UK shows from late November to mid-December 2017. In his absence, Lewis switched from bass to lead guitar, and filling in on bass was Martyn Campbell, best known as a member of The Lightning Seeds and a close friend of O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s who had toured together with the drummer as part of Kealer&#x27;s backing band. Campbell had also played bass on Power&#x27;s debut solo album &quot;Happening for Love&quot; and on Richard Ashcroft albums. After fulfilling his duties with Robert Plant, Tyson returned to Cast halfway through their tour, in which they were the opening act for Shed Seven.

On 2 May 2018, Cast announced the November release of the compilation &quot;Singles 1995-2017&quot;, coinciding with a month-long, 13-date Greatest Hits Tour across the UK from 23 November to 22 December.

On 30 January 2020, Cast announced that they would be embarking on a UK tour that October to mark the 25th anniversary of their debut album &quot;All Change&quot;. The tour was postponed to April–May 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but finally went ahead after being rescheduled yet again to January and February 2022.

Meanwhile, John Power spent 2021 writing a new album that he described as &quot;may well be Cast&#x27;s last ever album&quot;. Produced by Youth with work concluding in 2023, the band recorded the album as a three-piece of Power, Liam Tyson and Keith O&#x27;Neill, with Power playing bass on an album for the first time since he was in The La&#x27;s.

Following the completion of the album, John Power embarked on an October–November 2023 UK solo tour in which he performed a couple of songs from the new record, and on 28 October Cast released the title track and first single from their album &quot;Love Is the Call&quot; that Power described as feeling like &quot;a missing link&quot; between his time in The La&#x27;s and Cast&#x27;s debut album &quot;All Change&quot;. Second single &quot;Love You Like I Do&quot; followed on 5 December along with the confirmation of a 16 February 2024 release date for the album &quot;Love Is the Call&quot;, a February UK in-store tour and a March UK headlining tour. Cast were also confirmed as a support act for Liam Gallagher&#x27;s June 2024 tour of UK and Ireland to commemorate the 30th anniversary of his former band Oasis&#x27; debut album &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot;. &quot;Faraway&quot;, the third single from &quot;Love Is the Call&quot;, was released on 5 January 2024.

On 29 October 2024 it was announced by Cast that they would be supporting Oasis during their reunion tour in 2025 for the UK and Irish dates. In a statement, Cast frontman John Power said: &quot;I’m blown away at the reunion. Oasis are the voice of a generation and the songs that they wrote and sung were and still are the soundtrack to many people’s dreams. They are the people’s band. I’ve known Noel and Liam all through the years, we go way back. It’s been some ride, some journey. I’ve felt and known their music personally, as a fan. It inspired me as songwriter, it blew the whole scene open like nothing before and it reached way beyond the stratosphere. Everything changed. We were all part of that and we will all be part of this. I’m especially looking forward to revisiting my family’s Irish roots when the tour hits Dublin. Let the opening chords shimmer and shine next July.”

<doc id="387468" wikidata="Q471241" url="?curid=387468" title="Bis (Scottish band)">
<text>Bis ( , stylised in all lowercase) are a Scottish indie pop band composed of Steven Clark (Sci-Fi Steven), John Clark (John Disco), and Amanda MacKinnon (Manda Rin), formed in 1994. The band&#x27;s name, rhyming with &#x27;this&#x27;, derives from &quot;black iron skyline&quot;, a lyric from the song &quot;Twilight of a Champion&quot; by The The. 

After releasing numerous EPs and three studio albums, &quot;The New Transistor Heroes&quot; (1997), &quot;Social Dancing&quot; (1999), and &quot;Return To Central&quot; (2001), the band broke up in 2003, but re-formed briefly in 2007 for a series of concerts. In 2009, they re-formed again and released the album &quot;data Panik etcetera&quot; (2014). 

In 2019, the band&#x27;s lineup returned to the original core three-piece and released the album &quot;Slight Disconnects&quot;. In 2021, the band self-released &quot;Low Level (A Return To Central Travel Companion)&quot;, a CD consisting of previously unreleased material recorded during the &quot;Return To Central&quot; sessions. In October 2022, &quot;Systems Music For Home Defence&quot; was released, which Sci-Fi Steven has described as the band&#x27;s &quot;rave&quot; album.

==History==
===1994–1997: Formation and early history===
The three musicians formed Bis in late 1994 while Rin and Disco were in secondary school, Woodfarm High School, and Steven who had recently finished there. After releasing their first singles &quot;Transmissions On The Teen-C Tip!&quot; and &quot;Disco Nation 45&quot; the following year, they appeared on BBC Television&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; in 1996 performing &quot;Kandy Pop&quot; from their &quot;The Secret Vampire Soundtrack&quot; EP ahead of its release. Bis were the first unsigned band performed on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. &quot;Kandy Pop&quot; came 49th in a reader poll of the &quot;50 Greatest Britpop Songs Ever&quot; by &quot;NME&quot;.

Bis released a number of EPs (&quot;The Secret Vampire Soundtrack&quot;, &quot;Bis vs. The D.I.Y Corps&quot;, &quot;Atom-Powered Action!&quot; and &quot;This Is Teen-C Power!&quot;), three of which entered the UK Singles Chart in 1996, followed by several singles between 1997 and 1999. They contributed a song to the Gary Numan tribute album &quot;Random&quot; in 1997. Two of the band&#x27;s early releases (&quot;Disco Nation 45&quot; and &quot;The Secret Vampire Soundtrack&quot;) were on Glasgow&#x27;s Chemikal Underground label, run by the Delgados, and the band released one EP (&quot;Bis Vs. The D.I.Y Corps&quot;) on their own Teen-C Recordings label, before they transferred to Wiiija where labelmates included Cornershop. In the United States, their records appeared on the underground label K Records, and on the Beastie Boys&#x27; Grand Royal label. 

They toured extensively both in the UK and abroad, their diverse influences reflected in the kinds of acts they appeared with; Foo Fighters, Garbage, Gary Numan, and Pavement amongst them. The group became a favourite of the likes of Blur, John Peel and Green Day, despite a particularly hostile review by Steven Wells in the &quot;New Musical Express&quot; entitled &quot;The Sinking of the Bis Lark&quot;.

Sleeve artwork for the band&#x27;s early releases featured a consistent &quot;cut’n’paste&quot; visual aesthetic and typewritten text in line with the band&#x27;s interests in zine culture, DIY and punk. The band produced the fanzines &quot;Funky Spunk&quot; and &quot;Paper Bullets&quot; and advertised these in record liner notes. Manda Rin&#x27;s manga-influenced artwork adorned early record sleeves contributing to a defiantly &quot;twee&quot; and self-consciously &quot;cute&quot; aesthetic. 

The band was heavily influenced by the approach of cult punk band The Nation Of Ulysses. Liner notes often made reference to &quot;The Teen-C Tip&quot; and outlined the band&#x27;s vision for a &quot;Teen-C Revolution&quot; involving various factions in the Bis canon such as the &quot;Disco Nation&quot;, &quot;Secret Vampires&quot;, &quot;Atom-Powered Action Gang&quot;, &quot;Icky-Poo Air Raiderz&quot;, &quot;Sweet Shop Avengerz&quot;, &quot;New Transistor Heroes&quot; and the &quot;D.I.Y Corps&quot;. The Teen-C Revolution (and its adherents, the &quot;Teen-C Nation&quot;) effectively advocated for self-empowerment, independence and perpetual adolescence (as well as the right to enjoy both disco and punk) - in part it was an embrace of &quot;deceptively dangerous&quot; cuteness, the positive energy of youthful exuberance, a knee-jerk rejection of enforced maturity and the dour responsibilities of adulthood, and a rallying cry against blandness, normality and &quot;yr geetarawk&quot;.

Songs that directly mention Teen-C include &quot;Teen-C Power&quot;, &quot;Team Theme&quot;, &quot;Tell It To The Kids&quot;, &quot;Sweet Shop Avengerz&quot;, &quot;Rebel Soul&quot;, &quot;Ninja Hi Skool&quot; and &quot;Cliquesuck&quot;.

===1997–2003: Rise to fame and breakup===
From 1997 to 2001, Bis released three mainstream albums: &quot;The New Transistor Heroes&quot; (1997), &quot;Social Dancing&quot; (1999), and &quot;Return to Central&quot; (2001). A compilation of non-album tracks entitled &quot;Intendo&quot; was released in 1998. That same year Manda Rin contributed vocals to the J Church album &quot;Cat Food&quot;. The band enjoyed a period of success in Japan, selling nearly 100,000 copies of their debut album in its first week of release, but future releases failed to match its success in Japan. The single &quot;Eurodisco&quot;, from &quot;Social Dancing&quot;, became a minor success for the band in Australia as well as the UK. Their single &quot;Detour&quot; was also given some radio airplay in the U.S. and was included in the 2000 film &quot;Bring It On&quot;. The six-track EP &quot;Music For A Stranger World&quot; was released in 2000 and featured increasing electronic elements which would later become more prominent on &quot;Return To Central&quot;. Also in 2000, Sci-Fi Steven (adopting the pseudonym &quot;Marco Stiletto&quot;) formed the duo Italian Electro with partner &quot;Angelino Vampyro&quot; - Catmobile Records released their sole output (the track &quot;Don’t Come Back Alone&quot;) that year on a split 7-inch with Kumari.

Bis gained some American popularity in 1998, when they recorded the closing credits theme to the animated series &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot;. They also did a punk version of the theme for 2002&#x27;s &quot;The Powerpuff Girls Movie&quot;. The four-song EP &quot;Fukd I.D. #5&quot; was released in 2001 through Chemikal Underground. Bis contributed a remix of their song &quot;Statement of Intent&quot; to the 2002 game &quot;Jet Set Radio Future&quot;. The four-song 12-inch EP &quot;Fact 2002&quot; paying tribute to Factory Records was released in 2002 through Optimo Singles Club and featured cover versions of Joy Division, New Order, A Certain Ratio and Section 25. The band broke up in March 2003, after playing a farewell show at King Tut&#x27;s Wah Wah Hut.

===2003–2009: Solo projects===
The band members remained active in the local music scene. Steven and John Disco produced music together as the duo Dirty Hospital (releasing multiple 12-inchs on their own label Rottenrow Records) and Rin acted as a DJ. Disco (with Ally Christie) formed Kempston, Protek &amp; Fuller who released the 12-inch &quot;Fukd I.D. #8 - 12k Boost Boost&quot; in 2003 on Chemikal Underground. Rin was also in a duo called The Kitchen with Ryan Seagrist of Discount (debut album &quot;Foreign Objects&quot; released on Damaged Goods in 2004), whilst Disco joined the ska band, The Amphetameanies, which included members of Belle &amp; Sebastian, Franz Ferdinand and Pink Kross. Also in 2004 Rin contributed vocals to the album &quot;I Met The Music&quot; by Meister.

In 2005, the band announced on the official Bis website that together they had formed a new band called data Panik, with Stuart Memo on bass and drummer Graham Christie. After releasing two 7-inch singles, however, this band split up. Also in 2005, Bis performed in animated form on the CBBC children&#x27;s cartoon &quot;BB3B&quot;.

In 2006, Rin was working on solo material. The following year, she teamed up with the Scottish electro-pop outfit Juno!, and has collaborated on their independently released singles, &quot;Smoke &amp; Mirrors&quot; and &quot;These Boys Are Athletes&quot;, as well as regularly appearing live with the band, most recently at the Rock Ness 2008 Festival.

To celebrate the 10-year anniversary of the release of their debut album &quot;The New Transistor Heroes&quot;, Bis reformed in April 2007 for three shows in Glasgow, Manchester, and London. A greatest hits compilation, titled &quot;We Are Bis from Glasgow, Scotland&quot;, was released on compact disc to coincide with these shows.

In August 2008, Rin released the solo single &quot;DNA&quot;, which she followed up with the release of her debut album, &quot;My DNA&quot; with This Is Fake DIY in September 2008.

In 2009, Disco (using the moniker John Hospital) released a digital-only solo EP &quot;The Truant&quot; on Pest Control Records.

===2009–2017: Reunion to &quot;Data Panik Etcetera&quot;===

In November 2009, Rin announced that the band would reform to play at the Primavera Festival in May 2010, returning this time with a bassist and drummer, former data Panik members, Stuart Memo and Graham Christie, respectively.

Rin made two guest appearances on the BBC music quiz programme &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot; (on 18 November 2010 and 19 January 2011). She also teamed up with Hyperbubble on a track for their 2011 album &quot;Drastic Cinematic&quot;. Rin would go on to work with Hyperbubble again on the 2013 EP &quot;Hyperbubble + Manda Rin&quot;. Around 2011 John Disco began releasing solo electronic material under the moniker Debukas, with his debut solo LP &quot;I Am Machinery&quot; appearing in 2013 on the label 20:20 Vision.

In 2013, Rin contributed lead vocals to the track &quot;Crack On, Have A Booze&quot; which appeared on the album &quot;Why Do Birds Suddenly Appear&quot; by punk rock/oi! band Hard Skin.

In February 2014, Bis announced they would release their fourth album, &quot;data Panik etcetera&quot;, on 15 May on Rough Trade Records. The album was made available for streaming at NME on 28 April.

The same year, the band&#x27;s first three albums were re-released as double CD deluxe editions by the Do Yourself In label.

In 2014, Rin provided the artwork for an iPhone game called &quot;All Fridges Are Psychotic&quot;.

In 2015, Sci-Fi Steven began releasing solo material under the moniker Batteries with Do Yourself In Records releasing the self-titled debut album &quot;Batteries&quot; in 2015 and sophomore album &quot;The Finishing Line&quot; in 2016.

===2017–present: &quot;Slight Disconnects&quot;, &quot;Systems Music For Home Defence&quot; and beyond===
In October 2017, the band announced that they were working on their fifth album. &quot;Slight Disconnects&quot; was released in February 2019 on Last Night From Glasgow. They also returned to a three piece with only Manda, John and Steven being in the lineup.

In 2020, Last Night From Glasgow released &quot;Music For Animations&quot;, an archival album consisting of the music recorded for the CBBC kids cartoon &quot;BB3B&quot;.

In 2021, the band self-released a cassette-only live album &quot;The Fan Club Tapes Vol. 1 - Live In Toulouse 1997&quot; and Komponist released &quot;Low Level (A Return To Central Travel Companion)&quot; - a collection of previously unreleased material recorded parallel to &quot;Return To Central&quot;.

In October 2022, the album &quot;Systems Music For Home Defence&quot; was released on Last Night From Glasgow.

<doc id="387474" wikidata="Q1938749" url="?curid=387474" title="Paul Heaton">
<text>Paul David Heaton (born 9 May 1962) is an English singer-songwriter. He was the lead singer and main lyricist of the Housemartins, who had commercial success in the UK and other European countries between 1985 and 1988, releasing several singles including &quot;Happy Hour&quot; and the UK number-one single &quot;Caravan of Love&quot; in 1986, before the band disbanded. Heaton then formed the Beautiful South with the Housemartins&#x27; drummer, Dave Hemingway, and the band&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Song for Whoever&quot;, and debut album, &quot;Welcome to the Beautiful South&quot;, were released in 1989 to commercial success. They had a series of hits throughout the 1990s, including the number-one single &quot;A Little Time&quot;. They disbanded in 2007. 

Heaton pursued a solo career, which produced three albums, and in 2014 he released &quot;What Have We Become?&quot;, a collaboration with former Beautiful South vocalist Jacqui Abbott. As of 2022, he has recorded four more albums with her: &quot;Wisdom, Laughter and Lines&quot; in 2015, &quot;Crooked Calypso&quot; in 2017, &quot;Manchester Calling&quot; in 2020, and &quot;N.K-Pop&quot; in 2022. 

The British newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot; described Heaton as &quot;one of our finest songwriters: his music reveals an exuberant ear for melody, his lyrics a keen eye and a brilliant wit&quot;. AllMusic said: &quot;The warm, mellifluous voice of Paul Heaton often masks the jagged satirical content of his lyrics.&quot;

==Early life==
Paul David Heaton was born in Bromborough, Wirral Merseyside (formerly Cheshire), on 9 May 1962 to parents Doris and Horace Heaton. Heaton has two older brothers Mark Heaton and Adrian Heaton. At the age of four his family relocated to Sheffield. While living in Sheffield, Heaton became interested in football, and while his elder brothers elected to watch Sheffield Wednesday, Heaton chose to support Sheffield United. After moving to Sheffield, Heaton&#x27;s father took a job in management and Heaton described his childhood as being &quot;fairly middle class, although you wouldn&#x27;t know it given the schools I went to and the friends I had&quot;.

After a childhood in Sheffield, Heaton moved to Chipstead, Surrey during his adolescent years, an early life Heaton described as &quot;bred in Sheffield, fed in Surrey&quot;. Whilst in Surrey he, with his brother Adrian, formed their first band &quot;Tools Down&quot; with friends John Box and Stuart Mair. At sixth form, he met Norman Cook and Chris Lang and formed a band called the Stomping Pond Frogs, but this band broke up when Cook and others went to university. Heaton did not go to university, but held a number of office jobs, which would influence his later songwriting.

After leaving Surrey, Heaton spent time hitch-hiking around Europe before moving to Hull in 1983, with his girlfriend Susan Lillywhite, and close friends Ray Barry (Trotsky)and Mathew Vincent, where he formed the Housemartins. Heaton also lived in Leeds for a year.

Throughout his childhood, Heaton&#x27;s main interest was football, and he regularly attends Sheffield United games. Heaton played over 700 competitive games at junior and amateur level, often insisting on driving back from gigs on a Friday or Saturday night to attend his Saturday and Sunday matches.

==The Housemartins==
Heaton, then billing himself as P.d. Heaton, formed the Housemartins in the early 1980s. This band featured Stan Cullimore on guitar, Ted Key on bass and Hugh Whitaker on drums. Shortly afterwards Key left the band and was replaced with Norman Cook. The Housemartins released a number of singles and two studio albums, &quot;London 0 Hull 4&quot; and &quot;The People Who Grinned Themselves to Death&quot;. Their most popular hit was an a cappella cover version of &quot;Caravan of Love&quot; (originally by Isley-Jasper-Isley), which reached number 1 on 16 December 1986, their only number 1 hit in the UK. For the second album Hugh Whitaker was replaced with Dave Hemingway on drums. Shortly afterwards the Housemartins split up.

The Housemartins&#x27; lyrics were a mixture of Marxist politics and Christianity (the inner sleeve of &quot;London 0 Hull 4&quot; contained the mantra &quot;Take Jesus – Take Marx – Take Hope&quot;).

==The Beautiful South==
In 1988, Heaton formed the Beautiful South. The initial lineup consisted of Heaton, Dave Rotheray on lead guitar, former Housemartins roadie Sean Welch on bass, David Stead on drums and Housemartins former drummer Dave Hemingway, now in the role of joint lead singer and frontman. The writing partnership of Heaton and Rotheray proved very successful. The Beautiful South released two top ten singles, &quot;Song for Whoever&quot; and &quot;You Keep It All In&quot;; the latter featured Irish singer Briana Corrigan on vocals. In 1989, the band released an album, &quot;Welcome to the Beautiful South&quot;. The band&#x27;s biggest success to date is the single &quot;A Little Time&quot;, released in 1990; it reached number 1 on the UK chart.

The band went on to release eight more albums, including two (1996&#x27;s &quot;Blue Is the Colour&quot; and 1998&#x27;s &quot;Quench&quot;) that reached the number 1 on the UK Albums Chart, as well as releasing the best-of compilation &quot;Carry on up the Charts&quot;, which also reached number 1 and achieved platinum status, before the band split up.

After a band meeting on 30 January 2007, they decided to split. They released a statement on 31 January, in which their reasons for splitting were &quot;musical similarities&quot;. On an interview with BBC Breakfast in July 2008, Heaton clarified this by saying that the Beautiful South had made similar-sounding albums for the past ten years.

==Solo albums==
In 2001, Heaton released a solo album using the persona of Biscuit Boy (a.k.a. Crackerman). This double name, including the parenthetical a.k.a., was the official project name on all early releases.

The solo album, called &quot;Fat Chance&quot;, was not a commercial success, peaking at number 95 for one week on the UK albums chart. Also, &quot;Mitch&quot;, the lone single credited to Biscuit Boy (a.k.a. Crackerman), reached only number 75 in the UK Singles Chart.

In an attempt to relaunch the album, Mercury Records re-issued &quot;Fat Chance&quot; in 2002. The album featured new artwork, and was now credited to Paul Heaton. However, this record charted even lower in the album chart, hitting number 168. &quot;The Perfect Couple&quot;, a single pulled from this re-release also did poorly, peaking at number 102 in the UK. Heaton subsequently rejoined the Beautiful South from 2002 to 2007.

With the 2007 dissolution of the Beautiful South, Heaton formed a new band, The Sound of Paul Heaton.

Heaton&#x27;s second solo album, &quot;The Cross-Eyed Rambler&quot;, was released on 7 July 2008, preceded by the single &quot;Mermaids and Slaves&quot; on 30 June, and he toured in support of it throughout July. The album charted at number 43.

Heaton released his third solo album, &quot;Acid Country&quot;, in September 2010.

==&quot;The 8th&quot;==
In 2011, the Manchester International Festival endorsed the writing by Heaton of an anthology of songs based on the 7 deadly sins, to be called &quot;The 8th&quot;. The song was broken down into a section for each sin, which was to be performed by a different artist. The singers for the original piece were: Wayne Gidden, Aaron Wright, King Creosote, Simon Aldred, Cherry Ghost, Jacqui Abbott, Yvonne Shelton and Mike Greaves. The individual sections were incorporated with a narration written by Che Walker and performed by Reg E. Cathey.

&quot;The 8th&quot; debuted in July 2011 at the Festival Pavilion Theatre in Manchester&#x27;s Albert Square. Six further performances took place in the summer of 2012. Accompanying Heaton on the 2012 tour were Gareth Paisey of Los Campesinos!, Cherry Ghost, Wayne Gidden, Christian Madden of The Earlies, Yvonne Shelton, Mike Greaves, Aaron Wright, Simon Aldred, and Steve Menzies.

Along with the live shows in July 2012, a recording of &quot;The 8th&quot; was released on a CD/DVD format, including tracks by Simon Aldred of Cherry Ghost, Aaron Wright, Mike Greaves, Yvonne Shelton, Jacqui Abbott and Heaton himself.
==Paul Heaton and Jacqui Abbott==
Heaton reunited with former Beautiful South vocalist Jacqui Abbott in 2013 to record new material. &quot;What Have We Become?&quot; was released on 19 May 2014. The album reached number 3 in the UK Albums Chart. The album contained 12 new songs (the deluxe version an additional four new songs). The majority of the songs were written by Heaton and his current songwriting partner Jonny Lexus, with &quot;D.I.Y&quot;, &quot;When it Was Ours&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re Gonna Miss Me&quot; written by Heaton only.

On working with Abbott again, Heaton said: &quot;Working with Jacqui again was like going into your garage and discovering a beautiful, covered up Rolls-Royce that hadn&#x27;t been started in years. Jacqui is one of the best singers I&#x27;ve worked with and is also part of my past. It was only a matter of time before I asked her.&quot;

On Sunday 29 June 2014 they appeared live on BBC Two at Glastonbury Festival performing acoustic versions of second single &quot;Moulding of a Fool&quot; and a cover version of Kenny Rogers &amp; Dolly Parton&#x27;s &quot;Islands in the Stream&quot;. During the summer of 2014 Paul and Jacqui performed at a series of festivals across the UK and Ireland including Glastonbury Festival, Latitude Festival, V Festival and Festival N°6.

On 11 November 2014, BBC Radio 2 broadcast a world premiere of &quot;Real Hope&quot;, featuring the Grimethorpe Colliery Band, from the deluxe edition of &quot;What Have We Become?&quot;.

Heaton and Abbott&#x27;s next two albums together, &quot;Wisdom, Laughter and Lines&quot; (2015) and &quot;Crooked Calypso&quot; (2017), both reached the UK top 10, and their fourth, &quot;Manchester Calling&quot; (2020), became their first UK Number 1 album for over twenty years. They followed this up with a further UK Number 1 album, &quot;N.K-Pop&quot; in 2022 and a UK &amp; Ireland arena tour, which included a night at the London O2 Arena. During the tour in December 2022, Abbott took ill which forced Heaton to continue the tour solo, before adding guest singers for the Ireland shows in early 2023 and his subsequent summer festival appearances.

Heaton performed at Glastonbury on 28th June 2024 with backing singer Rianne Downey. Earlier in June, it was announced that a new album, &quot;The Mighty Several&quot;, produced by Ian Broudie, will be released on Friday 11 October 2024.

==&quot;The Last King of Pop&quot;==
On 16 November 2018, a career-spanning collection of Heaton&#x27;s music titled &quot;The Last King Of Pop&quot; was released on the Virgin EMI label. It featured 23 of the songs written by Heaton throughout his career in the Housemartins, The Beautiful South, his solo years, and his collaboration with Jacqui Abbott.

The track listing included the Housemartins&#x27; 1985 debut single &quot;Flag Day&quot;, The Beautiful South&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Marry Her&quot;, &quot;Rotterdam&quot; and &quot;Perfect 10&quot; through to 2017&#x27;s Heaton &amp; Abbott single &quot;I Gotta Praise&quot; + a 2018 re-record by Paul and Jacqui of the Beautiful South song &quot;A Little Time&quot;, and a brand new song, entitled &quot;7&#x27; Singles&quot;.

The album reached Number 10 in the UK Charts and was certified Gold on 11 January 2019.

To coincide with the album release, Heaton and Abbott performed three shows at Sheffield City Hall, Blackpool Empress Ballroom and London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall, performing the album in full.

Following the success of the shows, it was announced that Heaton and Abbott would perform &quot;The Last King Of Pop&quot; at an outdoor headline show at Stockport County&#x27;s Edgeley Park on 21 June 2019. All 15,000 tickets sold out and a second night was announced to take place on 20 June 2019. Richard Hawley was announced as special guest at both shows.

A television documentary covering Paul Heaton&#x27;s life and career was broadcast on Wednesday 12 December 2018 on Channel 4. The documentary included archived material and interviews with many key figures from throughout Heaton&#x27;s life.

==Personal life==
Heaton lives in Manchester with his wife and three children.

Heaton has on occasion referred to the Beautiful South as having a heavy-drinking culture. Many songs by the Beautiful South, such as &quot;Woman in the Wall&quot;, &quot;Liars&#x27; Bar&quot;, &quot;I May Be Ugly&quot;, &quot;The Slide&quot;, &quot;Look What I Found in My Beer&quot; and &quot;Old Red Eyes Is Back&quot;, have referred to alcoholism or drink-fuelled violence. 

In December 2011, Heaton purchased the lease of The King&#x27;s Arms public house in Bloom Street, Salford, Greater Manchester. He sold the pub in December 2015.

He is a keen collector and has a diverse range of collections including football memorabilia, crisp packets, beer mats, postcards and comics.

==Other appearances==
During the 1990s, Heaton regularly appeared on &quot;Football Italia&quot;, Channel 4&#x27;s coverage of Italian Serie A football as a pre-match guest and was frequently introduced by host James Richardson as an &#x27;Italian football expert&#x27;.

Heaton appeared on BBC One talking head programme &quot;Why We Love the Royle Family&quot;, along with Noel Gallagher, in his capacity as a fan of the television sitcom &quot;The Royle Family&quot;.

In May 2012, Heaton set off on his 50:50 cycle tour of British and Irish pubs, promoting his latest album, British pubs, and cycling. He covered – for each year of his life.

In 2022, unable to do another cycling tour, he sent money to 60 pubs across the UK and Ireland to enable them to give free pints to celebrate his 60th birthday.

In February 2023, Heaton and his crisp packet collection appeared on the Channel 4 documentary &quot;Grayson Perry&#x27;s Full English&quot;, with Heaton donating a display of Murphy’s Crisps flavours to Perry&#x27;s exhibition of Englishness.

<text>Broxburn (, ) is a town in West Lothian, Scotland. It is from the West End of Edinburgh, from Edinburgh Airport and to the north of Livingston. Originally a village known as Easter Strathbock in the medieval period, by 1600, the village had become known as Broxburn. The area developed rapidly during the Victorian era as a result of industrialisation related to shale oil extraction. While much of the industry in the area is now diminished, the town has continued to grow following new residential development, resulting in Broxburn forming a conurbation with neighbouring Uphall. It lies just to the south of Winchburgh.

==Etymology==
The name Broxburn is a corruption of &quot;brock&#x27;s burn&quot;, brock being an old Scots name for a European badger whether from the Gaelic &quot;broc&quot; or the Pictish/Welsh/Brythonic &quot;Broch&quot; and burn being a Scots word for a large stream or small river. The village was earlier known as Easter Strathbrock (Uphall was Wester Strathbrock) with Strath coming either from the Gaelic &quot;srath&quot; or the Pictish/Welsh/Brythonic &quot;ystrad&quot; meaning a river valley.

==History==

The village that later became Broxburn probably originated around 1350 when Margery le Cheyne inherited the eastern half of the Barony of Strathbrock (Easter Strathbrock) on the death of her father, Sir Reginald le Cheyne III. The hamlet that grew up around her residence was then called Eastertoun (eastern town) after the land on which it stood. The lands of Strathbrock were earlier owned by Freskin the Fleming, granted to him under a charter from King David I.

Easter Strathbrock was burned to the ground sometime in 1443-4 during a conflict between William, Earl of Douglas, Lieutenant-General of Scotland, and William, Lord Crichton, Chancellor of Scotland. It was destroyed again in 1455 during fighting between the Douglases and King James II. After the conflict, peace was regained and the town was gradually resettled. In 1590, Kirkhill House was built for John Laing, a local landowner. The village was renamed Broxburn in 1600 by Sir Richard Cockburn of Clerkington, Keeper of the Privy Seal of Scotland, almost certainly after Broxburn, East Lothian.

In 1636, Kirkhill house was granted to Ludovic Stewart, advocate. The house and surrounding land eventually passed to David Erskine, 11th Earl of Buchan, where the house was extensive remodelled in 1770/1771. It then passed to his nephew, the 12th Earl who was buried in St John&#x27;s Church nearby. The house still exists today in Broxburn and is Category B listed.

==Economy==
===Past===

Broxburn remained an agricultural community until the development of the oil shale industry in the area during the second half of the nineteenth century. This brought in a rapid influx of workers, greatly expanding the local population. Broxburn is still known for its association with the industry, pioneered by the inventor and industrialist James Young. Many shale spoil tips, known as bings, are still in evidence around the town.

Up until its closure in 2013, Hall&#x27;s of Broxburn, a food manufacturer, employed around 1,700 employees at its meat processing plant to the east of the town. At the time of closure, it was the largest, single employer in Broxburn. The large building was demolished in 2014.

===The Shale Bings===
The 3 Broxburn Bings (Greendikes Bing, Albion Oil Works Bing and Hopetoun Bing) reside on the north east of Broxburn starting from behind the East Mains Industrial estate. The nearby Niddry Bing resides near the village of Winchburgh. The largest of the three Bings is the Greendykes Bing which when scaled provides excellent views of the whole area. The Bings were created by large piles of spoil from the shale mines being dumped on top of each over to form the Bings.

===Present===
Broxburn now has two separate industrial areas, the Greendykes Industrial Estate and the East Mains Industrial Estate, which provide employment for local people. The largest employers are Campbells Prime Meat Limited, Glenmorangie and Broxburn Bottlers Limited (part of Ian Macleod Distillers Ltd). James Ritchie &amp; Son is a firm of clockmakers located in Broxburn that was established in 1809.

==Governance==
Broxburn lies in the Livingston constituency of the British Parliament and the Almond Valley constituency of the Scottish Parliament.

Before Brexit, it was part of the Scotland European Parliament constituency.

For Local Government purposes, it is part of; the Broxburn, Uphall and Winchburgh Ward of West Lothian Council and is part of West Lothian Council 2nd ward, which also includes the nearby villages of Uphall and Winchburgh.

==Community facilities==
The Strathbrock Partnership Centre is a local community facility that contains a medical centre, library, community museum and community centre. The library, formerly known as the Broxburn library was renamed the Lex Davidson Library in 2022 in honour of a local councillor who served the community for 25 years.

The local hospital is St. John&#x27;s Hospital at Howden in Livingston.

==Transport==
The A89 road passes along the southern edge of Broxburn. The A899 road passes directly through the centre of Broxburn where it is known as East and West Main Street. The nearest motorway is the M8. Broxburn is served by multiple bus services operated by McGill&#x27;s Scotland East, Lothian Country and E&amp;M Horseburgh. SD Travel operates one twice-a-day service 16 between Livingston Centre and Western General Hospital in the northwestern tip of Edinburgh via Broxburn, Whinchburgh, and Kirkliston, and HcL, a small mobility company based in the county, operates a local town service 2A and 2B between Broxburn and Uphall and within Broxburn itself.

==Religious sites==

Broxburn has six churches.

The church of St John Cantius and St Nicholas Catholic Church is a Roman Catholic church. The church is Category B listed. It was built in 1880 in the Early English style to a design by Shiells &amp; Thomson, the church is notable for containing a 15th/16th-century font from the medieval church excavated at Kirkhill. The church high altar is in Caen stone and marble by Pugin &amp; Pugin. Adjacent to the church is a hall dating to 1936 (now used by a local scout group) and a memorial chapel for Henry Erskine, 12th Earl of Buchan built in 1857, who lived nearby at Kirkhill House.

The Broxburn Parish Church was built in 1880 to a French Gothic design by Hippolyte Blanc. It provides Church of Scotland services.

The St Nicholas United Free Church of Scotland was built in 1890 in the Gothic style to a design by James Graham Fairley.

Other smaller churches in the town include the New Life Christian Fellowship Broxburn in Strathbrock Community Centre, the Broxburn Baptist Church, and the Grace Community Church. There are also some other religious groups active in the town, including Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses and several evangelical Christian organisations.

Broxburn is home to the football club Broxburn Athletic, who play in the East of Scotland League. There are sports and health facilities publicly available, including a sports centre, library, swimming pool and bowling clubs. The Binny Golf Club is located on the Binny Estate.
A motorcycle dirt track was built at The Sports Park in 1928 and a few demonstration events were staged to show off the new sport to football fans. Due to Broxburn&#x27;s proximity to Edinburgh, it was not licensed. Another demonstration event at a motorcycle club event in 1929 ended after both riders crashed.

<doc id="387478" wikidata="Q1507012" url="?curid=387478" title="The Housemartins">
<text>The Housemartins were an English indie rock group formed in Hull who were active in the 1980s and charted three top-ten albums and six top-twenty singles in the UK. Many of their lyrics conveyed a mixture of socialist politics and Christianity, reflecting the beliefs of the band (the back cover of their debut album, &quot;London 0 Hull 4&quot;, contained the message, &quot;Take Jesus – Take Marx – Take Hope&quot;). The group&#x27;s a cappella cover version of &quot;Caravan of Love&quot; (originally by Isley-Jasper-Isley) was a UK number one single in December 1986.

After breaking up in 1988, Paul Heaton and Dave Hemingway formed the Beautiful South, while bassist Norman Cook became an electronic dance music DJ and producer, founding the groups Beats International, Pizzaman, and Freak Power, before rebranding himself as Fatboy Slim.

==Career==
=== Formation ===
The band was formed in late 1983 by Paul Heaton (vocals, billed as &quot;P.d. Heaton&quot;.) and Stan Cullimore (guitar), initially as a busking duo. The pair recorded a demo tape with Ingo Dewsnap and Sharon Green of Les Zeiga Fleurs which brought them to the attention of Go! Discs. The band often referred to themselves as &quot;the fourth best band in Hull&quot; - various candidates have been cited for the three better bands, including Red Guitars, Everything but the Girl, and the Gargoyles.

With the start of the UK miners&#x27; strike in 1984, Heaton felt the angrier political songwriting that resulted from this required a full band lineup. The band recruited the rhythm section from fellow Hull band The Gargoyles, initially recruiting guitarist Ted Key on bass, who then persuaded his bandmate Hugh Whitaker to join on drums. The band&#x27;s first live performance as a four-piece was at Hull University in October 1984.

=== John Peel sessions, &quot;London 0 Hull 4&quot; and &quot;Caravan of Love&quot; ===

Key left at the end of 1985, after recording the band&#x27;s first John Peel session and the band&#x27;s first single Flag Day, saying he felt isolated in the writing process for the band&#x27;s first album. Heaton invited Norman Cook (later known as Fatboy Slim), who had been a member of Heaton&#x27;s teenage band the Stomping Pond Frogs and had played on some early Housemartins demos, to replace Key.

In 1986, having recorded a second John Peel session, the band broke through with their third single &quot;Happy Hour&quot;, which reached No. 3 in the UK Singles Chart. The single&#x27;s success was helped by a claymation animated pop promo of a type that was in vogue at the time, featuring a cameo by comedian Phill Jupitus, who toured with the band under his stage name of &quot;Porky the Poet&quot;. Their debut album, &quot;London 0 Hull 4&quot;, was released later in 1986 and contained their previous two singles as well as alternative versions of first single &quot;Flag Day&quot; and follow-up to &quot;Happy Hour&quot;, &quot;Think for a Minute&quot;. 

At the end of 1986 they had their only UK No. 1 single on 16 December with a cover version of Isley-Jasper-Isley&#x27;s &quot;Caravan of Love&quot;. The single was pipped to the Christmas number 1 by Jackie Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Reet Petite&quot;, which the band later attributed to the track being pulled from the BBC Radio 1 playlist following a sexual reference to the then prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, and her husband Denis, made by one of the band in a radio interview.

&quot;Caravan of Love&quot; was first performed by the Housemartins in their second Peel session in April 1986, before their initial chart success. At Peel&#x27;s suggestion, the band then recorded another session (under the name the Fish City Five), consisting entirely of a cappella performances, and on occasion played support act for their own performance under this alternative name. The &quot;Caravan of Love&quot; single featured four a cappella gospel songs on the B-side.

=== &quot;The People Who Grinned Themselves to Death&quot; ===

Drummer Hugh Whitaker left in 1987 on amicable terms, and suggested his school friend Dave Hemingway as replacement. 

The Housemartins&#x27; second album &quot;The People Who Grinned Themselves to Death&quot; was released in September 1987, and included their two previous singles &quot;Five Get Over Excited&quot; and &quot;Me and the Farmer&quot;. A third single from the album, &quot;Build&quot;, was released in November, and a final Peel Session from the same month provided a recording used for their final single.

=== Breakup and post-breakup activities ===

Following the release of their last single &quot;There Is Always Something There to Remind Me&quot; in April 1988, the Housemartins announced that the band was splitting up. A farewell compilation album, &quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call Quite Good&quot; was released later that year. 
The members of the band have remained in contact and have worked on each other&#x27;s projects. Norman Cook has enjoyed significant success with Beats International and then as Fatboy Slim, while Heaton, Hemingway and roadie Sean Welch formed The Beautiful South. In August 2009, &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine arranged for The Housemartins&#x27; original members (Heaton, Cullimore, Cook and Whitaker) to get together for a photo-shoot and interview, for the first time in many years, but in the interview all the members maintained that the band would not re-form.

Cullimore became a children&#x27;s author, and in December 2009 co-wrote songs for (and appeared in) a pre-school music series called &quot;The Bopps&quot;, which first showed on Nick Jr. in the UK in April 2010. Cullimore and Whitaker joined Heaton on stage during a show by Heaton and Jacqui Abbott in 2014 at Hull&#x27;s The New Adelphi Club, on the stage where the band had signed their Go-Discs record contract. The trio performed the Housemartins hit &quot;Me and the Farmer&quot;, and Cullimore and Heaton closed the show with a performance of &quot;Caravan of Love&quot;.

In June 2024, Heaton performed on the Pyramid Stage at the Glastonbury Festival, and was joined by Cook on bass for a performance of &quot;Happy Hour&quot;.

==Musical style and lyrics==
The band&#x27;s early releases saw them described as jangle pop, which brought comparisons with bands such as the Smiths and Aztec Camera. David Quantick, writing for &quot;Spin&quot;, described them in 1986 as playing &quot;traditional &#x27;60s-style guitar pop overlaid with soul vocals&quot;. Cook described the band as &quot;religious, but not Christians&quot;, and the band&#x27;s repertoire included gospel songs.

Many of the band&#x27;s lyrics have socialist themes, with Cook stating that &quot;Paul realised that he hated writing about love...and that writing politically came easier to him&quot;, describing some of their songs as &quot;angrily political&quot;.

<doc id="387479" wikidata="Q513514" url="?curid=387479" title="Honoré Mercier">
<text>Honoré Mercier (October 15, 1840 – October 30, 1894) was a Canadian lawyer, journalist and politician in Quebec. He was the ninth premier of Quebec from January 27, 1887, to December 21, 1891, as leader of the Parti National or Quebec Liberal Party (PLQ). He rose to power by mobilizing the Francophone opposition to the execution of Louis Riel, denouncing it as a betrayal by John A. Macdonald&#x27;s Conservative government.

==Early background==

Mercier was born in Saint-Athanase, Lower Canada to farmer Jean-Baptiste Mercier and Marie Kimener. Mercier is descended from Julien Mercier (1621-1676) who arrived from Tourouvre, France in 1647. Mercier studied at the Jesuit College Sainte-Marie in Montreal, and was called to the Bar of Quebec in April 1865. As the age of 22, Mercier became the editor of &quot;Le Courrier de St-Hyacinthe&quot; newspaper. He opposed the Confederation project as early as 1864, believing that it would be detrimental to French Canadians.

==Member of Parliament==

In 1871, he was instrumental in creating the short-lived Parti National. Mercier successfully ran as a Liberal candidate in the 1872 election. He became Member of the House of Commons for the district of Rouville. He did not run for re-election in the 1874 election. In the 1878 election, Mercier was candidate in the district of St. Hyacinthe. He was defeated by the Louis Tellier, his Conservative opponent.

==Provincial politics==

In 1879, Mercier was appointed Solicitor General of Quebec in the Cabinet of Premier Henri-Gustave Joly de Lotbinière and served in that position for less than a year. He won a by-election and became Member of the Legislative Assembly for the district of Saint-Hyacinthe. He was re-elected in the 1881 and 1886 elections and won another by-election in 1887.

He left an impact on a later leader, Henri Bourassa.

==Party leader==
He became the leader of the PLQ in 1883. A practising lawyer, from 1885 to 1887 he was President of the Bar of Montreal. He strongly opposed the execution of Louis Riel in 1885; this event helped him win popular support, and the Quebec Conservative Party lost support because its federal counterparts had ordered Riel&#x27;s execution.

Seizing the opportunity to build a coalition with dissident Conservatives, Mercier revived the &quot;Parti National&quot; name for the 1886 Quebec provincial election, and won a majority of seats. However, the coalition consisted of mostly Liberals and only a few Conservatives, so the &quot;Liberal&quot; name was soon reinstituted. The Conservatives, reduced to a minority in the Legislative Assembly, clung to power for a few more months, but Mercier became Premier of Quebec in 1887.

==Premier of Quebec==
Seeing provincial autonomy as the political expression of Quebec nationalism, he collaborated with Ontario Premier Oliver Mowat to roll back federal centralism. Mercier initiated the idea of interprovincial conferences in 1887. He was the first Quebec premier to defend the principle of provincial autonomy within the confederation, campaigning to abolish the federal government&#x27;s claimed right to veto provincial legislation.

With his strong nationalist stance, Mercier was very much a precursor of later nationalist premiers in future decades who confronted the federal government and tried to win more power for Quebec. He promoted contacts with Francophones in other parts of North America outside of Quebec including Western Canada and New England. Those francophones had not yet been assimilated into the English-Canadian or American culture to the extent they would be in the future. Mercier promoted reform, economic development, Catholicism, and the French language. He won popularity but also made enemies. He was returned to the legislature as the Member for the district of Bonaventure and his party won the 1890 election with an increased majority. In 1891, he was created a count by the Pope.

==Political downfall==
On December 16, 1891, he was dismissed by Lieutenant Governor Auguste-Réal Angers after a report concluded that his government had diverted public funds. He lost the 1892 election, and gave up the party leadership to Félix-Gabriel Marchand. He was brought to trial later that year and found not guilty when a second report concluded differently on the matter. However, his health had greatly deteriorated and his political career was over. He died in 1894 at the age of 54, and was interred in the Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery in Montreal, Quebec.

==Legacy==
The following landmarks were named to honour Honoré Mercier:

*The Mercier Bridge that links the western part of the Island of Montreal with the South Shore;
*The town of Mercier, Quebec;
*Avenue Mercier, located in downtown Shawinigan, Quebec, Canada;
*The provincial electoral district of Mercier;
*An elementary school named Honoré-Mercier in Montreal;
*A high school named Honoré-Mercier in Montreal;
*A hospital in Saint-Hyacinthe, Québec named Hôpital Honoré-Mercier;
*Avenue Honoré-Mercier, located in the Quebec City centre;
*The borough of Mercier–Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and its contained district of Mercier in Montreal.

==Family==
His son Honoré Mercier &quot;fils&quot; was a multi-term member of the Legislative Assembly of Quebec and a Cabinet Minister; his grandson Honoré Mercier III served one term in the Legislative Assembly.

Mercier was Lomer Gouin&#x27;s father-in-law and is a great-great-grandfather of NDP retired leader Thomas Mulcair.

<doc id="387489" wikidata="Q647589" url="?curid=387489" title="Thin-film optics">
<text>Thin-film optics is the branch of optics that deals with very thin structured layers of different materials. In order to exhibit thin-film optics, the thickness of the layers of material must be similar to the coherence length; for visible light it is most often observed between 200 and 1000 nm of thickness. Layers at this scale can have remarkable reflective properties due to light wave interference and the difference in refractive index between the layers, the air, and the substrate. These effects alter the way the optic reflects and transmits light. This effect, known as thin-film interference, is observable in soap bubbles and oil slicks.

More general periodic structures, not limited to planar layers, exhibit structural coloration with more complex dependence on angle, and are known as photonic crystals.

In manufacturing, thin film layers can be achieved through the deposition of one or more thin layers of material onto a substrate (usually glass). This is most often done using a physical vapor deposition process, such as evaporation deposition or sputter deposition, or a chemical process such as chemical vapor deposition.

Thin films are used to create optical coatings. Examples include low emissivity panes of glass for houses and cars, anti-reflective coatings on glasses, reflective baffles on car headlights, and for high precision optical filters and mirrors. Another application of these coatings is spatial filtering.

== Examples in the natural world ==
Thin-film layers are common in the natural world. Their effects produce colors seen in soap bubbles and oil slicks, as well as the structural coloration of some animals. The wings of many insects act as thin-films, because of their minimal thickness. This is clearly visible in the wings of many flies and wasps. In butterflies, the thin-film optics is visible when wing itself is not covered by wing scales, which is the case in the blue wing spots of the &quot;Aglais io&quot; and the blue-green patches of the &quot;Graphium sarpedon&quot;. In buttercups, the flower&#x27;s gloss is due to a thin-film, which enhances the flower&#x27;s visibility to pollinating insects and aids in temperature regulation of the plant&#x27;s reproductive organs.

<doc id="387491" wikidata="Q1068275" url="?curid=387491" title="Chatoyancy">
<text>In gemology, chatoyancy ( ), also called chatoyance or the cat&#x27;s eye effect, is an optical reflectance effect seen in certain gemstones, woods, and carbon fiber. Coined from the French , meaning &#x27;cat&#x27;s eye&#x27;. The chatoyant effect is typically characterized by one or more well-defined bands of reflected light, reminiscent of a cat&#x27;s eye, which appear to glide across the material&#x27;s surface as the chatoyant object or observer shifts position.

Chatoyancy is caused by either the presence of fibrous structures within the material, such as in tiger&#x27;s eye quartz, or by fibrous inclusions and cavities, as seen in cat&#x27;s eye chrysoberyl. In cat&#x27;s eye chrysoberyl, the chatoyant effect is caused by the presence of rutile, composed mostly of titanium dioxide, which aligns perpendicularly to create the cat&#x27;s eye appearance.

==Description==
Chatoyancy in the gemstone chrysoberyl is induced by the presence of the mineral rutile, a mineral primarily composed of titanium dioxide. These rutile precipitates align perpendicularly, contributing to the cat&#x27;s eye effect. This alignment is attributed to the rutile&#x27;s lattice parameter, which matches only one of the three orthorhombic crystal axes of chrysoberyl, leading to its preferred orientation in that direction. 

===Optimal presentation of effect===
To bring out the chatoyancy effect, gemstones are typically fashioned into a cabochon cut, characterized by a rounded, flat base rather than facets, with the fibrous structures aligned parallel to the base. High-quality specimens display a single, sharply defined band of light that moves across the stone when rotated, while lower-quality stones may show a banded effect similar to cat&#x27;s-eye quartz. Faceted stones do not showcase the effect well.

==== Varieties of chatoyant materials ====
Gem species known for this phenomenon include the aforementioned quartz, chrysoberyl, beryl (especially. aquamarine varieties), charoite, tourmaline, labradorite, selenite, feldspar, apatite, moonstone, thomsonite and scapolite amongst others. Chatoyancy is not limited to gemstones but can also be found in various wood species and carbon fiber. Synthetically made gemstones with optical fibers can also have chatoyancy. These gemstones are available in a variety of vibrant colors.

==== Cat&#x27;s eye terminology ====

When the term &quot;cat&#x27;s eye&quot; is used to describe a gemstone by itself, it typically refers to cat&#x27;s eye chrysoberyl . It can also be used as an adjective to indicate the chatoyance phenomenon in another stone, for example, cat&#x27;s eye aquamarine.

==In woodworking==
Chatoyancy in wood occurs in various species – particularly hardwoods and the various types of Nanmu woods of China and South East Asia, particularly where stresses from the weight of the growing tree result in denser patches, or where stresses cause burl or &quot;bird’s eye&quot;. This ‘figure’, which has a striking three-dimensional appearance, is highly prized by woodworkers and their clients alike, and is featured regularly in furniture, musical instruments, and other decorative wood products. Figuring takes on a variety of forms and is referred to as &quot;flame&quot;, &quot;ribbon&quot;, &quot;tiger stripe&quot;, &quot;quilting&quot;, among other names.

This effect is sometimes called &quot;wet look&quot;, since wetting wood with water often displays the chatoyancy, albeit only until the wood dries. Certain finishes cause the wood grain to become more pronounced. Oil finishes, epoxy, and shellac can strongly bring out the &quot;wet look&quot; effect. When the refractive index of the finish nearly matches that of the wood, light scattering no longer occurs at the wood surface, adding the appearance of depth to the wood&#x27;s figure.

=== Measurement ===
No method to measure wood chatoyance is unanimously accepted by the scientific community. Some methods have been proposed, such as one named PZC, which was used to measure typical values for a number of wood species; some results are reported below:

<doc id="387492" wikidata="Q229828" url="?curid=387492" title="Mikhail Kalinin">
<text>Mikhail Ivanovich Kalinin (, ; 3 June 1946) was a Soviet politician and Russian Old Bolshevik revolutionary. He served as head of state of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and later of the Soviet Union from 1919 to 1946. From 1926 until his death, he was a member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

Born to a peasant family, Kalinin worked as a metal worker in Saint Petersburg and took part in the 1905 Russian Revolution as an early member of the Bolsheviks. During and after the October Revolution, he served as mayor of Petrograd (St. Petersburg). After the revolution, Kalinin became the head of the new Soviet state, as well as a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the Politburo.

Kalinin remained the titular head of state of the Soviet Union after the rise of Joseph Stalin, with whom he enjoyed a privileged relationship, but held little real power or influence. He retired in 1946 and died in the same year. The former East Prussian city of Königsberg, annexed by the Soviet Union in 1945, was renamed Kaliningrad after him a year later. The city of Tver was also known as &quot;Kalinin&quot; until 1990, when its historic name was restored, one year before the eventual fall of the Soviet Union.

== Early life ==
Mikhail Ivanovich Kalinin was born on 19 November 1875 to a peasant family of ethnic Russian origin in the village of Verkhnyaya Troitsa (), Tver Governorate, Russia. 

Kalinin worked with his father on the land until the age of 13. When he was 10, he was taught to read and write by an army veteran. At 11, he entered a primary school run by a local landowning family. When he finished school, the family took him to Saint Petersburg to work as a footman. At 16, he was sent as an apprentice in a cartridge factory, and at 18, he was employed as a lathe operator in the Putilov factory.

== Early political career ==

Kalinin joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1898, while still working at the Putilov works. The following year, he was arrested, imprisoned for 10 months, then exiled to the Caucasus, and found work as a craftsman at the Tbilisi railway depot, where he met Sergei Alliluyev, the father of Joseph Stalin&#x27;s second wife. He came to know Stalin through the Alliluyev family. Dismissed for taking part in a strike, and later deprived of the right to work in the Caucasus, he moved to Reval, in Estonia, where he was arrested again in 1903, he spent six months in custody in St Petersburg, then two and a half months in Kresty Prison. After his release, he returned to Reval, but was arrested again in 1904 and exiled in Siberia.

Released in 1905, Kalinin returned to St Petersburg, and moved from job to job. In 1906, he married the ethnic Estonian Ekaterina Lorberg ( (, 1882–1960). She changed her last name to &quot;Kalinina&quot; after the marriage. In the same year, he joined the Bolshevik faction of the RSDLP, headed by Vladimir Lenin, and was on the staff of the Central Union of Metal Workers.

He served as a delegate at the 4th Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, in April 1906, and to the 1912 Bolshevik Party Conference held in Prague, where he was elected an alternate member of the governing Central Committee and sent to work inside Russia. He did not become a full member because he was suspected of being an Okhrana agent (the real agent was Roman Malinovsky, a full member). In November 1916, during World War I, while he was again working in a factory in St Petersburg, Kalinin was arrested again and was due to be deported to Siberia, but was freed during the February Revolution of 1917.

==Russian Revolutions==
Kalinin joined the Petrograd Bolshevik committee and assisted in the organization of the party daily newspaper &quot;Pravda,&quot; now legalized by the new regime.

In April 1917, Kalinin, like many other Bolsheviks, advocated conditional support for the Provisional Government in cooperation with the Menshevik faction of the RSDLP, a position at odds with that of Lenin. He continued to oppose an armed uprising to overthrow the government of Alexander Kerensky throughout that summer.

In the elections held for the Petrograd City Duma in autumn 1917, Kalinin was chosen as mayor of the city, which he administered during and after the Bolshevik Revolution of 7 November.

In 1919, Kalinin was elected a member of the governing Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party as well as a candidate member of the Politburo. He was promoted to full membership on the Politburo in January 1926, a position which he retained until his death in 1946.

When Yakov Sverdlov died in March 1919 from influenza, Kalinin replaced him as President of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee, the titular head of state of Soviet Russia. The name of this position was changed to Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the USSR in 1922 and to Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet in 1938. Kalinin continued to hold the post without interruption until his retirement at the end of World War II.

In 1920, Kalinin attended the Second World Congress of the Communist International in Moscow as part of the Russian delegation. He was seated on the presidium rostrum and took an active part in the debates.

== Soviet Union ==

Kalinin was a factional ally of Stalin during the bitter struggle for power after the death of Lenin in 1924. He delivered a report on Lenin and the Comintern to the Fifth World Congress in 1924.

Kalinin was one of the comparatively few members of Stalin&#x27;s inner circle springing from peasant origins. The lowly social origins were widely publicised in the official press, which habitually referred to Kalinin as the &quot;All-Union Elder&quot; (Всесоюзный староста), a term harking back to the village community, in conjunction with his role as titular head of state. In practical terms, by the 1930s, Kalinin&#x27;s role as a decision-maker in the Soviet government was nominal.

Although he was a member of the Politburo, the &quot;de facto&quot; executive branch of the Soviet Union, and nominally held the second-highest state post in the USSR, Kalinin held little power or influence. His role was mostly limited to receiving diplomatic letters from abroad. Recalling him, future Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know what practical work Kalinin carried out under Lenin. But under Stalin he was the nominal signatory of all decrees, while in reality he rarely took part in government business.&quot;

On 5 March 1940, six members of the PolitburoKalinin, Stalin, Vyacheslav Molotov, Lazar Kaganovich, Kliment Voroshilov, and Anastas Mikoyansigned an order to execute 25,700 Polish &quot;nationalists and counterrevolutionaries&quot; (Polish intelligentsia, priests, and military officers) kept at camps and prisons in occupied western Ukraine and Belarus, ultimately leading to the Katyn massacre.

== Personality ==
Despite the very high offices he occupied, Kalinin had very little real power, and was principally a figurehead, easily dominated by Stalin. According to the Russian writer, Roy Medvedev, &quot;on the pretext of protecting Kalinin, Stalin kept him under virtual house arrest for a long time, with NKVD agents constantly in his apartment. Kalinin completely surrendered to Stalin, covering up the dictator&#x27;s crimes with his great prestige. Trotsky wrote:

Kalinin was unable to protect his wife, Ekaterina Kalinina, who was critical of Stalin&#x27;s policies and was arrested on 25 October 1938 on charges of being a &quot;Trotskyist&quot;. At the time of her arrest Ekaterina and her husband Mikhail Kalinin were not living together. Although her husband was the chair of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet (1938–46), she was tortured in Lefortovo Prison and on 22 April 1939, she was sentenced to fifteen years&#x27; imprisonment in a labour camp. She was released shortly before her husband&#x27;s death in 1946.

Shortly before Kalinin died, the Montenegrin communist, Milovan Djilas, was one of a delegation of Yugoslav communists, led by Josip Broz Tito, who dined in the Kremlin with Stalin and other Soviet leaders. Djilas recalled:

== Death and legacy ==
Kalinin retired in 1946 and died of cancer on 3 June that year in Moscow. He was honoured with a state funeral and was buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis, in one of the twelve individual tombs located between the Lenin Mausoleum and the Kremlin Wall.

Three large cities (Tver, Korolyov and Königsberg) were renamed after Kalinin. Tver&#x27;s historic name was restored in 1990, and Korolyov&#x27;s in 1996 in honour of a famous Soviet/Russian rocket scientist Sergey Korolev.

Kalinin Square and Kalinin Street which were named after Kalinin are located in Minsk, Belarus. Kalinin Street in Tallinn, Estonia was renamed Kopli Street following Estonian independence. Prospekt Kalinina in Dnipro, Ukraine was renamed Prospekt Serhiy Nigoyan in January 2015 as part of decommunization in Ukraine.

<text>Television in Quebec is a part of the culture of Quebec, with over 99% of households owning a television in Quebec. Long a preferred medium of many of Quebec&#x27;s actors, artists, and writers, television has been one of the important forces in Quebec society, including its substantial influence in a series of dramatic changes in the 1960s: the Quiet Revolution.

==Types of television==

Although broadcast in French, &quot;la télévision québécoise&quot; has little relationship to television in France. It is similar to television in the United States: A 30-minute programming grid, commercials, local stations, and a division between broadcast television formed around networks of stations—which is freely available to anyone with a TV within their broadcast area—and cable television channels that require a subscription.

===Broadcast television===
The four major broadcast television networks in Quebec are Ici Radio-Canada Télé, TVA, Noovo and Télé-Québec. Some local advertising is aired and stations produce local newscasts, but all four networks otherwise air virtually identical schedules throughout Quebec, with the network signals being essentially the output of their Montreal flagships. Local stations affiliated with the networks are located in each of the 10 television markets of Quebec: Montreal, Quebec City, Gatineau–Ottawa, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, Trois-Rivières, Rivière-du-Loup, Rimouski, Abitibi-Témiscamingue, and Carleton-sur-Mer.

TVA is by far the most watched network: in fall 2006, it held 28% of the Quebec francophone primetime television audience, compared to Radio-Canada&#x27;s 19% and Noovo&#x27;s 14%.

Given the predominantly French-speaking population, only CBC, the English-language television service (CBMT-DT) funded by the government of Canada, is available over the air throughout the province. Montreal has local owned-and-operated stations of CTV (CFCF-DT), Global (CKMI-DT), and Citytv (CJNT-DT), Canada&#x27;s three main English-language networks, while Gatineau receives all three networks as part of the Ottawa media market; Global is also available over-the-air in Quebec City and Sherbrooke through rebroadcasters of the Montreal station.

===Cable television===

Quebec has the lowest cable television-satellite television penetration rates in Canada, with 85.7% of Quebecers having cable television, as of 2006.

Vidéotron and Cogeco are the largest cable companies in Quebec, although a large number of independent cable companies exist. These compete against satellite companies Bell Satellite TV and Shaw Direct, as well as Bell&#x27;s IPTV service Bell Fibe TV.

==The industry==

There are two primary television seasons of approximately 13 weeks each with the first being a fall season running from the beginning of September to December and, then, a winter season running from January to April. It is during these two periods that the majority of new domestic series air.

Nearly all Quebecois television outlets are owned by six companies: the federally owned Société Radio-Canada, the provincially owned Société de télédiffusion du Québec, and private companies Groupe TVA, Corus Entertainment, Rogers Sports &amp; Media, and Bell Media. These companies produce programming themselves or, more commonly, by independent producers. Tax breaks provided to independent producers have increased their workload, although the two largest networks produce a large amount of programming themselves.

Television production is centred in Montreal, where Radio-Canada and TVA have their large studio complexes and where most other independent studio facilities exist. A small amount of national programming is produced in Quebec City, in accordance with the licenses of the broadcast networks.

The French-language television industry in Canada uses much more original, domestic productions than English-language outlets. As the French-language stations did not compete with U.S. stations, and viewers were relatively uninterested in dubs of U.S. imports, there was a larger incentive to invest in original dramas and entertainment programming catered towards the captive Quebecois audience. the top ten shows were written and created by Quebecers. The Quebec television industry produced two and one half times more TV series per capita than American networks, and domestic dramas were four times as profitable as American imports.

Because of the large domestic industry, Quebecois television has been described as having an insular &quot;star system&quot; that favours local talent. Personalities may frequently appear across different programs, and an extensive network of local celebrity news outlets cover them. &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; media writer Steve Faguy found that there were at least 40 different Quebecois programs with formats dependent on celebrity guests (either as a participant or interview subject). In April 2016, during an interview on Radio-Canada&#x27;s &quot;Tout le monde en parle&quot;, Quebecois musician Pierre Lapointe criticized the lack of diversity in the personalities seen on Quebecois television, which he described as a &quot;culture of emptiness&quot;. Lapointe explained that &quot;I&#x27;m sick of always seeing the same faces, and I&#x27;m one of those faces.&quot; The episode aired against the 2016 Artis Awards on TVA, which featured many of the same nominees and winners as the previous year&#x27;s edition.

==History==

Television began in Quebec (and in Canada) on September 6, 1952, with the launch of CBFT in Montreal, the first station in what would become Radio-Canada&#x27;s television network. Borrowing the technical standards and frequency plan from television in the United States, the station broadcast on the lowest channel, channel 2. Though initially bilingual, carrying programming from sister broadcaster CBC as well, the network would hold a monopoly on French-language television during all of the 1950s.

This &quot;golden age&quot; would end with a producers&#x27; strike at Radio-Canada in December 1958. The strike would lead one popular television host, René Lévesque, to launch a career in politics, one that would lead him to found the Parti Québécois and, later, nine-years as the Premier of Quebec.

In 1961, Télé-Métropole in Montreal signed on the air with decidedly populist programming. Known as &quot;le 10&quot; for its channel number, it was first private and independent French-language television broadcaster, the station would become the backbone of what is now the largest and highest-rated network in Quebec. In 1971, the network was formalized and given a name: TVA. By the early 1980s, its broadcast coverage reached nearly the entire province.

Colour began to be introduced in the 1960s, and by the end of the decade, unique cable television programming began with the introduction of &quot;télévision communautaire&quot;, the community channel.

Radio-Québec, now Télé-Québec, began in 1972, creating a third network, focusing on cultural and educational programming; first, its programming only appeared on cable, three years later, it began broadcasting as Montreal&#x27;s first UHF station.

In the following years, additional Quebec cable networks appeared: TVSQ, covering sports, and surpassed in 1988 by RDS; TVJQ, with children&#x27;s programming, later becoming Le Canal Famille, and now VRAK.TV; the TEQ, carrying an assortment of ethic programming, and now CJNT-TV; and TVFQ-99 (now TV5 Québec Canada).

In 1986, Télévision Quatre-Saisons, later V, now Noovo, launched as the newest television network, and the first to be distributed by satellite. With stations in Montreal and Quebec City, its reach was extended with partnerships with Radio-Canada affiliates elsewhere in the province, creating what is known as a twinstick.

At the same time, expansion of the number of cable channels continued: MusiquePlus (now Elle Fictions) in 1986; MétéoMédia in 1987; Réseau de l&#x27;information (now ICI RDI) and Canal D in 1995; MusiMax (now simply known as Max), Canal Vie, Télétoon, and Le Canal Nouvelles in 1997; Évasion, Historia, Séries+ (now SériesPlus) and Canal Z (later renamed as Ztélé; now simply known as Z), in 2000; and ARTV (now Ici ARTV) in 2001.

In the middle of the decade, as the growth of digital cable expanded, digital-only cable channels began to appear; today they include such channels as AddikTV, Argent, CASA, Cinépop, MOI ET CIE, Prise 2, RDS2, RDS Info, Télétoon Rétro, TVA Sports and Natyf TV.

<doc id="387505" wikidata="Q12125205" url="?curid=387505" title="Uphall">
<text>Uphall (, ) is a village in West Lothian, Scotland. It forms a conurbation with Broxburn to the east, Dechmont to the west and the major town of Livingston to the south west. Uphall is 30 miles from Glasgow and 14 miles from Edinburgh in the Scottish Lowlands. Uphall Station and Pumpherston are separate villages that lie to the south of Uphall.

Uphall has one primary school (Uphall primary school), several grocery stores, two cemeteries, a skatepark, football fields (King George Park), a golf course, a lawn bowls club (Middleton Hall) and a selection of public houses and hotels including the Volunteer Arms, Dovehill Arms, Oatridge Hotel and Houston House Hotel.

==History==
Uphall was historically a small settlement known as Wester Strathbrock (from the Gaelic &quot;Srath Bhroc&quot; meaning valley of the badgers), with its neighbour Broxburn being named Easter Strathbrock.

The parish was centered around Strathbrock Castle (a Motte-and-bailey castle since demolished) and St Nicholas Church which were both built in the 12th century. Until the late 18th century, Uphall was a small rural community but the industrial revolution triggered growth as local mining activity increased. The largest growth was a direct result of the discovery and exploitation of local oil shale in the area, as well as across West Lothian generally. This triggered massive growth as many people moved to the area to gain employment in the oil shale mines and associated oil works. Surrounding villages expanded rapidly as rows of miners&#x27; cottages were erected to accommodate the influx of people, who relocated from places such as the Scottish Highlands and rural Ireland. This growth continued until the oil industry went into terminal decline between the 1920s and 1960s.

Post war industrial development at Greendykes and East Mains Industrial Estates, coupled with new employment throughout the West Lothian district, the new town of Livingston and increased commuting to Edinburgh, continued to see the village grow into a larger settlement contiguous with Broxburn in the 20th century.

==Transport==
The A899 road is the primary road through Uphall, connecting the village with nearby Livingston to the south-east and Broxburn to the west. The A89 road and M8 Motorway lie immediately to the south of the village. The nearest railway station is Uphall railway station which lies to the south of Uphall at the smaller separate Uphall Station village.

Lothian Country operates multiple bus service that serve Uphall:

* X18 - Edinburgh - Corstorphine - Broxburn - Bathgate - Armadale - Whitburn
* N18 - Edinburgh - Corstorphine - Broxburn - Bathgate (Weekend Night Service)
* N43 - Edinburgh - Queensferry - Winchburgh - Broxburn - Dechmont (Night Service)
* 72 - Fauldhouse - Whitburn - Livingston - Broxburn - Winchburgh - Kirkliston

==Notable buildings==
St Nicholas (Strathbock) Church is a mid-12th-century church with a small tower, a nave and large chancel (enlarged in the 13th century). The church is first recorded in 1270 and has been expanded over the centuries, with additional aisles added in the 17th and 19th centuries. The church was extensively restored in 1937. The church has a Romanesque 12th century doorway and some of the oldest church bells in West Lothian, with one dated to 1503.

The Oatridge hotel on the main street of Uphall was built in 1810 and is a former coaching inn (previously named the Uphall Inn) on the Airdrie to Bathgate to Edinburgh turnpike route.

Middleton Hall is an 18th-century house currently operating as a care home. The hall was built circa 1710 and reconstructed significantly in the late 19th century as the Headquarters of Scottish Oils Ltd. The adjacent streets (Westhall Gardens, Middleton Road and Middleton Avenue) were later developed in the 1920s as a small garden community (based on the Garden city movement) for workers of the Oil company.

Kirkhill House in Uphall was the principal residence of David Stewart Erskine, 11th Earl of Buchan in the latter part of the eighteenth century. The house fell into ruin when Erskine moved to Dryburgh and it has only recently been reconstructed as a private residence. Among the features were a remarkable accurate scale model of the Solar System in the gardens surrounding the house, and an accompanying astronomical pillar now located in Almondell country Park. At the centre of the model the Sun was represented by a stone globe 6 feet in diameter and the six planets known in 1776 were represented by small globes distributed around the gardens at appropriate distances. Erskine, his titles and his model are preserved in modern names such as Buchan Road, Buchan Port, Buchan Arms, Cardross Road and Globe Park.
In the west of Uphall, Houston House is a four-storey white harl covered 16th-century tower house and hotel. Originally built for the local laird, the house was later purchased and expanded by John Shairp, an advocate to Mary, Queen of Scots. The house was restored by the architect Ian Lindsay in the 1940s as his home. In the 1970s, the house was purchased, refurbished and extended as a hotel.

==Culture and recreation==
King George V&#x27;s field is a public open space built as part of the King George&#x27;s Fields programme.

In the west of the village, Uphall Golf Club is an 18-hole subscription/private membership golf course founded in 1895. In February 2021, the Golf Club was substantially damaged by a fire which took 12 hours to extinguish.

Middleton Hall Bowling Club is a local bowls club with 1930s origins.

Uphall previously had a public hall (built 1873) that became the local cinema house in the 1920s, before closing in 1974 (the site is now occupied by a car showroom). The cinema archives are held by West Lothian Council.

==Education==
Uphall Primary School provides primary education for the community. The current school was constructed in the 1960s by Bamber Hall &amp; Partners and has since been expanded. Before the 1960s the original primary school was located further west on a site on the corner of Strathbrock place and St.Andrews drive. This site has since been redeveloped as the Uphall Community Education Centre. The building incorporates a hall, youth room, playgroup room and coffee lounge. While there are no facilities for secondary education in Uphall itself, Broxburn Academy in Broxburn serves as the closest secondary school.

==Notable residents==
*The Rev Alexander MacAndrew Gillespie OBE FRSE FRCPE FSAS FRGS (d.1984) minister and physician.
*Paul di Resta, the DTM champion 2010, and Formula One race driver in 2011–13 with the Force India F1 Team was born in Uphall on April 16, 1986.

<doc id="387507" wikidata="Q3119171" url="?curid=387507" title="California water wars">
<text>The California water wars were a series of political conflicts between the city of Los Angeles and farmers and ranchers in the Owens Valley of Eastern California over water rights.

As Los Angeles expanded during the late 19th century, it began outgrowing its water supply. Fred Eaton, mayor of Los Angeles, promoted a plan to take water from Owens Valley to Los Angeles via an aqueduct. The aqueduct construction was overseen by William Mulholland and was finished in 1913. The water rights were acquired through political fighting and, as described by one author, &quot;chicanery, subterfuge ... and a strategy of lies&quot;.

Water from the Owens River started being diverted to Los Angeles in 1913, precipitating conflict and eventual ruin of the valley&#x27;s economy. By the 1920s, so much water was diverted from the Owens Valley that agriculture became difficult. This led to the farmers trying to destroy the aqueduct in 1924. Los Angeles prevailed and kept the water flowing. By 1926, Owens Lake at the bottom of Owens Valley was completely dry due to water diversion.

The water needs of Los Angeles kept growing. In 1941, Los Angeles diverted water that previously fed Mono Lake, north of Owens Valley, into the aqueduct. Mono Lake&#x27;s ecosystem for migrating birds was threatened by dropping water levels. Between 1979 and 1994, David Gaines and the Mono Lake Committee engaged in litigation with Los Angeles. The litigation forced Los Angeles to stop diverting water from around Mono Lake, which has started to rise back to a level that can support its ecosystem.

==Owens Valley context ==

The Paiute natives were the inhabitants of the valley in the early 1800s, and used irrigation to grow crops.

In 1833, Joseph Reddeford Walker led the first known expedition into the central California area that would later be called the Owens Valley. Walker saw that the valley&#x27;s soil conditions were inferior to those on the other side of the Sierra Nevada range, and that runoff from the mountains was absorbed into the arid desert ground. After the United States gained control of California in 1848, the first public land survey conducted by A.W. von Schmidt from 1855 to 1856 was an initial step in securing government control of the valley. Von Schmidt reported that the valley&#x27;s soil was not good for agriculture except for the land near streams, and stated that the &quot;Owens Valley [was] worthless to the White Man.&quot;

In 1861, Samuel Bishop and other ranchers started to raise cattle on the luxuriant grasses that grew in the Owens Valley. The ranchers came into conflict with the Paiutes over land and water use, and most of the Paiutes were driven away from the valley by the U.S. Army in 1863 during the Owens Valley Indian War.

Many settlers came to the area for the promise of riches from mining. The availability of water from the Owens River made farming and raising livestock attractive. The Homestead Act of 1862 gave pioneers five years to claim and take title of their land for a small filing fee and a charge of $1.25 per acre. The Homestead Act limited the land an individual could own to in order to create small farms.
The amount of public land settled by the late 1870s and early 1880s was still relatively small. The Desert Land Act of 1877 allowed individuals to acquire more area, up to , in hopes of drawing more settlers by giving them enough land to make their settlement and land expenses worthwhile, but &quot;included no residency requirements&quot;. By 1886, rapid acquisition of land had begun and by the mid-1890s, most of the land in the Owens Valley had been claimed. The large number of claims made by land speculators hindered the region&#x27;s development because speculators would not participate in developing canals and ditches.

Before the Los Angeles Aqueduct, most of the of canals and ditches that constituted the irrigation system in the Owens Valley were in the north, while the southern region of the valley was mostly inhabited by people raising livestock. The irrigation systems created by the ditch companies did not have adequate drainage and as a result oversaturated the soil to the point where crops could not be raised. The irrigation systems also significantly lowered the water level in the Owens Lake, a process that was intensified later by the diversion of water through the Los Angeles Aqueduct. At the start of the 20th century, the northern part of the Owens Valley turned to raising fruit, poultry and dairy.

==Los Angeles Aqueduct==

Frederick Eaton and William Mulholland were two of the more visible principals in the California water wars. They were friends, having worked together in the private Los Angeles Water Company in the 1880s. In 1886, Eaton became City Engineer and Mulholland became superintendent of the Water Company. In 1898, Eaton was elected mayor of Los Angeles and was instrumental in converting the Water Company to city control in 1902. When the company became the Los Angeles Water Department, Mulholland continued to be superintendent, due to his extensive knowledge of the water system.

Eaton and Mulholland had a vision of a Los Angeles that would become far larger than the Los Angeles of the start of the 20th century. The limiting factor of Los Angeles&#x27;s growth was water supply. &quot;If you don&#x27;t get the water, you won&#x27;t need it,&quot; Mulholland famously remarked. 
Eaton and Mulholland realized that the Owens Valley had a large amount of runoff from the Sierra Nevada, and a gravity-fed aqueduct could deliver the Owens water to Los Angeles.

===Obtaining water rights 1902–1907===
At the start of the 20th century, the United States Bureau of Reclamation, at the time known as the United States Reclamation Service, was planning on building an irrigation system to help the farmers of the Owens Valley, which would block Los Angeles from diverting the water.

From 1902 to 1905, Eaton and Mulholland used underhanded methods to obtain water rights and block the Bureau of Reclamation. The regional engineer of the Bureau, Joseph Lippincott, was a close associate of Eaton; Eaton was a nominal agent for the Bureau through Lippincott, so Eaton had access to inside information about water rights and could recommend actions to the Bureau that would be beneficial to Los Angeles. In return, while Lippincott was employed by the Bureau, he also served as a paid private consultant to Eaton, advising Los Angeles on how to best obtain water rights.

To help acquire water rights in 1905, Eaton made high offers to purchase land in Owens Valley. Eaton&#x27;s eagerness aroused suspicion in a few local Inyo County people. Eaton bought land as a private citizen, hoping to sell it back to Los Angeles at a tidy profit. Eaton claimed in an interview with the &quot;Los Angeles Express&quot; in 1905 that he turned over all his water rights to the City of Los Angeles without being paid for them, &quot;except that I retained the cattle which I had been compelled to take in making the deals ... and mountain pasture land of no value except for grazing purposes&quot;. Eaton moved to the Owens Valley to become a cattle rancher on the land he purchased. Eaton always denied that he acted in a deceptive manner.

Mulholland misled Los Angeles public opinion by dramatically understating the amount of water locally available for Los Angeles&#x27;s growth. Mulholland also misled residents of the Owens Valley: he indicated that Los Angeles would only use unused flows in the Owens Valley, while planning on using the full water rights to fill the aquifer of the San Fernando Valley.

By 1907, Eaton was busy acquiring key water rights and traveling to Washington to meet with advisers of Theodore Roosevelt to convince them that the water of the Owens River would do more good flowing through faucets in Los Angeles than it would if used on Owens Valley fields and orchards.

The dispute over the Owens River water became a political dispute in Washington. Los Angeles needed rights of way across federal land to build the aqueduct. California Senator Frank Flint sponsored a bill to grant the rights of way, but Congressman Sylvester Smith of Inyo County opposed the bill. Smith argued that irrigating Southern California was not more valuable than irrigating Owens Valley. While a compromise was being negotiated, Flint appealed to President Roosevelt. Roosevelt met with Flint, Secretary of the Interior Ethan A. Hitchcock, Bureau of Forests Commissioner Gifford Pinchot, and Director of the Geological Survey Charles D. Walcott. In this meeting, Roosevelt decided in favor of Los Angeles.

Several authors, such as Rolle and Libecap, argue that Los Angeles paid an unfairly low price to the farmers of Owens Valley for their land. Gary Libecap of the University of California, Santa Barbara observed that the price that Los Angeles was willing to pay to other water sources per volume of water was far higher than what the farmers received. Farmers who resisted the pressure from Los Angeles until 1930 received the highest price for their land; most farmers sold their land from 1905 to 1925, and received less than Los Angeles was actually willing to pay. However, the sale of their land brought the farmers substantially more income than if they had kept the land for farming and ranching. None of the sales were made under threat of eminent domain.

The aqueduct was sold to the citizens of Los Angeles as vital to the growth of the city. Unknown to the public, the initial water would be used to irrigate the San Fernando Valley to the north, which was not at the time a part of the city. From a hydrological point of view, the San Fernando Valley was ideal: its aquifer could serve as free water storage without evaporation. One obstacle to the irrigation was the Los Angeles City Charter, which prohibited the sale, lease, or other use of the city&#x27;s water without a two-thirds approval by the voters. This charter limitation would be avoided through the annexation of a large portion of the San Fernando Valley to the city. The annexation would also raise the debt limit of Los Angeles, which allowed the financing of the aqueduct.

The San Fernando land syndicate were a group of wealthy investors who bought up large tracts of land in the San Fernando Valley with secret inside information from Eaton. The syndicate included friends of Eaton, such as Harrison Gray Otis and Henry E. Huntington. This syndicate made substantial efforts to support passage of the bond issue that funded the aqueduct. These efforts are reported to have included the dumping of water from Los Angeles reservoirs into the sewers (thereby creating a false drought) and by publishing scare articles in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, which Otis published. Remi Nadeau, a historian and author, disputed that water was dumped from reservoirs, because the sewer system may not have been connected to the reservoirs. The syndicate did unify the business community behind the aqueduct, and its purchases were public by the time the vote on the aqueduct was taken.

===The building and operation of the aqueduct 1908–1928===
From 1907 through 1913, Mulholland directed the building of the aqueduct. The Los Angeles Aqueduct, inaugurated in November 1913, required more than 2,000 workers and the digging of 164 tunnels. Mulholland&#x27;s granddaughter has stated that the complexity of the project was comparable to the building of the Panama Canal. Water from the Owens River reached a reservoir in the San Fernando Valley on November 5, 1913. At a ceremony that day, Mulholland spoke his famous words about this engineering feat: &quot;There it is. Take it.&quot;

After the aqueduct was completed in 1913, the San Fernando investors demanded so much water from the Owens Valley that it started to transform from &quot;The Switzerland of California&quot; into a desert. Mulholland was blocked from obtaining additional water from the Colorado River, so decided to take all available water from the Owens Valley.

In 1923, farmers and ranchers formed an irrigation cooperative headed by Wilfred and Mark Watterson, owners of the Inyo County Bank. By exploiting personal bitterness of some of the farmers, Los Angeles managed to acquire some of the key water rights of the cooperative. After these water rights were secured, inflows to Owens Lake were heavily diverted, which caused the lake to dry up by 1924.

By 1924, farmers and ranchers rebelled. A series of provocations by Mulholland were, in turn, followed by corresponding threats from local farmers, and the destruction of Los Angeles property. Finally, a group of armed ranchers seized the Alabama Gates and dynamited part of the system, letting water return to the Owens River. 
In August 1927, when the conflict was at its height, the Inyo County bank collapsed, which massively undermined valley resistance. An audit revealed that there were shortages in both cash in the vault and amounts shown on the books. The Watterson brothers were indicted for embezzlement, then tried and convicted on thirty-six counts. Since all local business had been transacted through their bank, the closure left merchants and customers with little more than the small amount of money they had on hand. The brothers claimed that the fraud was done for the good of the Owens Valley against Los Angeles, and this excuse was generally believed to be true in Inyo County. The collapse of the bank wiped out the lifetime savings of many people, including payments gained from the sale of homes and ranches to Los Angeles.

In the face of the collapse of resistance and of the Owens Valley economy, the attacks on the aqueduct ceased. The City of Los Angeles sponsored a series of repair and maintenance programs for aqueduct facilities that stimulated some local employment, and the Los Angeles water employees were paid a month in advance to bring some relief. But it was impossible to prevent many businesses from closing their doors.

The City of Los Angeles continued to purchase private land holdings and their water rights to meet the increasing demands. By 1928, Los Angeles owned 90 percent of the water in Owens Valley and agriculture interests in the region were effectively dead.

==The second Owens Valley Aqueduct, 1970–present ==

In 1970, LADWP completed a second aqueduct. In 1972, the agency began to divert more surface water and pumped groundwater at the rate of several hundred thousand acre-feet a year (several cubic meters per second). Owens Valley springs and seeps dried and disappeared, and groundwater-dependent vegetation began to die.

Because LADWP had never completed an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) addressing the impacts of groundwater pumping, Inyo County sued Los Angeles under the terms of the California Environmental Quality Act. Los Angeles did not stop pumping groundwater, but submitted a short EIR in 1976 and a second one in 1979, both of which were rejected as inadequate by the courts.

In 1991, Inyo County and the city of Los Angeles signed the Inyo-Los Angeles Long Term Water Agreement, which required that groundwater pumping be managed to avoid significant impacts while providing a reliable water supply for Los Angeles. In 1997, Inyo County, Los Angeles, the Owens Valley Committee, the Sierra Club, and other concerned parties signed a Memorandum of Understanding that specified terms by which the lower Owens River would be re-watered by June 2003 as partial mitigation for damage to the Owens Valley.

In spite of the terms of the Long Term Water Agreement, studies by the Inyo County Water Department from 2003 onward showed that impacts to the valley&#x27;s groundwater-dependent vegetation, such as alkali meadows, continue. Likewise, Los Angeles did not re-water the lower Owens River by the June 2003 deadline. In December, 2003, LADWP settled a lawsuit brought by California Attorney General Bill Lockyer, the Owens Valley Committee, and the Sierra Club. Under the terms of the settlement, deadlines for the Lower Owens River Project were revised and LADWP was to return water to the lower Owens River by 2005. This deadline was missed, but on December 6, 2006, a ceremony was held at the same site where William Mulholland had ceremonially opened the aqueduct which had closed the flow through the Owens River, to restart it down the river. David Nahai, president of the L.A. Water and Power Board, countered Mulholland&#x27;s words from 1913 and said, &quot;There it is ... take it back.&quot;

Nevertheless, groundwater pumping continues at a higher rate than the rate at which water recharges the aquifer, resulting in a long-term trend of desertification in the Owens Valley.

==Mono Lake==
By the 1930s, the water requirements for Los Angeles continued to increase. LADWP started buying water rights in the Mono Basin (the next basin to the north of the Owens Valley). An extension to the aqueduct was built, which included such engineering feats as tunneling through the Mono Craters (an active volcanic field). By 1941, the extension was finished, and water in various creeks (such as Rush Creek) were diverted into the aqueduct. To satisfy California water law, LADWP set up a fish hatchery on Hot Creek, near Mammoth Lakes, California.
The diverted creeks had previously fed Mono Lake, an inland body of water with no outlet. Mono Lake served as a vital ecosystem link, where gulls and migratory birds would nest. Because the creeks were diverted, the water level in Mono Lake started to fall, exposing tufa formations. The water became more saline and alkaline, threatening the brine shrimp that lived in the lake. Increases in salinity decreased adult size, growth rates, and brood sizes, and increased female mortality during their reproductive cycle. Changing levels in salinity as a result of water diversion put this species at risk, as well as the birds that nested on two islands (Negit Island and Paoha Island) in the lake. Falling water levels started making a land bridge to Negit Island, which allowed predators to feed on bird eggs for the first time.

In 1974, David Gaines started to study the biology of Mono Lake. In 1975, while at Stanford, he started to get others interested in the ecosystem of Mono Lake. This led to a 1977 report on the ecosystem of Mono Lake that highlighted dangers caused by the water diversion. In 1978, the Mono Lake Committee was formed to protect Mono Lake. The committee (and the National Audubon Society) sued LADWP in 1979, arguing that the diversions violated the public trust doctrine, which states that navigable bodies of water must be managed for the benefit of all people. The litigation reached the California Supreme Court by 1983, which ruled in favor of the committee. Further litigation was initiated in 1984, which claimed that LADWP did not comply with the state fishery protection laws.

Eventually, all of the litigation was adjudicated in 1994, by the California State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB). The SWRCB hearings lasted for 44 days and were conducted by Board Vice-chair Marc Del Piero acting as the sole Hearing Officer. In that ruling (SWRCB Decision 1631), the SWRCB established significant public trust protection and eco-system restoration standards, and LADWP was required to release water into Mono Lake to raise the lake level above the then-current level of below the 1941 level. As of 2022, the water level in Mono Lake has risen only of the required . Los Angeles made up for the lost water through state-funded conservation and recycling projects.

==Central Valley==
In February 2014, after three consecutive years of below-normal rainfall, California faced its most severe drought emergency in decades with fish populations in the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta in unprecedented crisis due to the decades of large-scale water exports from Northern California to south of the Delta via state and federal water projects. Half a million acres of Central Valley farmland supposedly was in danger of going fallow due to drought. On 5 February 2014 the House passed a bill to increase flows from the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta to the Central Valley, the Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley Emergency Water Delivery Act (H.R. 3964; 113th Congress). This would suspend the very recent efforts to restore the San Joaquin River since 2009, won after 18 years of litigation, with increased releases from the Friant Dam east of Fresno. Democratic Senators Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer proposed emergency drought legislation of $300 million aid, and to speed up environmental reviews of water projects, so state and federal officials have &quot;operational flexibility&quot; to move water south, from the delta to San Joaquin Valley farms.

On February 14, 2014, President Barack Obama visited near Fresno and announced $170 million worth of initiatives, with $100 million for ranchers facing livestock losses and $60 million to help food banks. Obama joked about the lengthy and incendiary history of water politics in California, saying, &quot;I&#x27;m not going to wade into this. I want to get out alive on Valentine&#x27;s Day.&quot;

==Documentaries and fiction==
The California water wars were among the subjects discussed in &quot;Cadillac Desert&quot;, a 1984 nonfiction book by Marc Reisner about land development and water policy in the western United States. The book was made into a four-part documentary of the same name in 1997.

The 1974 film &quot;Chinatown&quot; was inspired by the California water wars and features a fictionalized version of the conflict as a central plot element.

Compared to gases and most solid state lasing media, a dye can usually be used for a much wider range of wavelengths, often spanning 50 to 100 nanometers or more. The wide bandwidth makes them particularly suitable for tunable lasers and pulsed lasers. The dye rhodamine 6G, for example, can be tuned from 635 nm (orangish-red) to 560 nm (greenish-yellow), and produce pulses as short as 16 femtoseconds. Moreover, the dye can be replaced by another type in order to generate an even broader range of wavelengths with the same laser, from the near-infrared to the near-ultraviolet, although this usually requires replacing other optical components in the laser as well, such as dielectric mirrors or pump lasers.

Dye lasers were independently discovered by P. P. Sorokin and F. P. Schäfer (and colleagues) in 1966.

In addition to the usual liquid state, dye lasers are also available as solid state dye lasers (SSDL). These SSDL lasers use dye-doped organic matrices as gain medium.

==Construction==

A dye laser uses a gain medium consisting of an organic dye, which is a carbon-based, soluble stain that is often fluorescent, such as the dye in a highlighter pen. The dye is mixed with a compatible solvent, allowing the molecules to diffuse evenly throughout the liquid. The dye solution may be circulated through a dye cell, or streamed through open air using a dye jet. A high energy source of light is needed to &#x27;pump&#x27; the liquid beyond its lasing threshold. A fast discharge flashtube or an external laser is usually used for this purpose. Mirrors are also needed to oscillate the light produced by the dye&#x27;s fluorescence, which is amplified with each pass through the liquid. The output mirror is normally around 80% reflective, while all other mirrors are usually more than 99.9% reflective. The dye solution is usually circulated at high speeds, to help avoid triplet absorption and to decrease degradation of the dye. A prism or diffraction grating is usually mounted in the beam path, to allow tuning of the beam.

Because the liquid medium of a dye laser can fit any shape, there are a multitude of different configurations that can be used. A Fabry–Pérot laser cavity is usually used for flashtube pumped lasers, which consists of two mirrors, which may be flat or curved, mounted parallel to each other with the laser medium in between. The dye cell is often a thin tube approximately equal in length to the flashtube, with both windows and an inlet/outlet for the liquid on each end. The dye cell is usually side-pumped, with one or more flashtubes running parallel to the dye cell in a reflector cavity. The reflector cavity is often water cooled, to prevent thermal shock in the dye caused by the large amounts of near-infrared radiation which the flashtube produces. Axial pumped lasers have a hollow, annular-shaped flashtube that surrounds the dye cell, which has lower inductance for a shorter flash, and improved transfer efficiency. Coaxial pumped lasers have an annular dye cell that surrounds the flashtube, for even better transfer efficiency, but have a lower gain due to diffraction losses. Flash pumped lasers can be used only for pulsed output applications.

A ring laser design is often chosen for continuous operation, although a Fabry–Pérot design is sometimes used. In a ring laser, the mirrors of the laser are positioned to allow the beam to travel in a circular path. The dye cell, or cuvette, is usually very small. Sometimes a dye jet is used to help avoid reflection losses. The dye is usually pumped with an external laser, such as a nitrogen, excimer, or frequency doubled . The liquid is circulated at very high speeds, to prevent triplet absorption from cutting off the beam. Unlike Fabry–Pérot cavities, a ring laser does not generate standing waves which cause spatial hole burning, a phenomenon where energy becomes trapped in unused portions of the medium between the crests of the wave. This leads to a better gain from the lasing medium.

==Operation==
The dyes used in these lasers contain rather large organic molecules which fluoresce. Most dyes have a very short time between the absorption and emission of light, referred to as the fluorescence lifetime, which is often on the order of a few nanoseconds. (In comparison, most solid-state lasers have a fluorescence lifetime ranging from hundreds of microseconds to a few milliseconds.) Under standard laser-pumping conditions, the molecules emit their energy before a population inversion can properly build up, so dyes require rather specialized means of pumping. Liquid dyes have an extremely high lasing threshold. In addition, the large molecules are subject to complex excited state transitions during which the spin can be &quot;flipped&quot;, quickly changing from the useful, fast-emitting &quot;singlet&quot; state to the slower &quot;triplet&quot; state.

The incoming light excites the dye molecules into the state of being ready to emit stimulated radiation; the singlet state. In this state, the molecules emit light via fluorescence, and the dye is transparent to the lasing wavelength. Within a microsecond or less, the molecules will change to their triplet state. In the triplet state, light is emitted via phosphorescence, and the molecules absorb the lasing wavelength, making the dye partially opaque. Flashlamp-pumped lasers need a flash with an extremely short duration, to deliver the large amounts of energy necessary to bring the dye past threshold before triplet absorption overcomes singlet emission. Dye lasers with an external pump-laser can direct enough energy of the proper wavelength into the dye with a relatively small amount of input energy, but the dye must be circulated at high speeds to keep the triplet molecules out of the beam path. Due to their high absorption, the pumping energy may often be concentrated into a rather small volume of liquid.

Since organic dyes tend to decompose under the influence of light, the dye solution is normally circulated from a large reservoir. The dye solution can be flowing through a cuvette, i.e., a glass container, or be as a &quot;dye jet&quot;, i.e., as a sheet-like stream in open air from a specially-shaped nozzle. With a dye jet, one avoids reflection losses from the glass surfaces and contamination of the walls of the cuvette. These advantages come at the cost of a more-complicated alignment.

Liquid dyes have very high gain as laser media. The beam needs to make only a few passes through the liquid to reach full design power, and hence, the high transmittance of the output coupler. The high gain also leads to high losses, because reflections from the dye-cell walls or flashlamp reflector cause parasitic oscillations, dramatically reducing the amount of energy available to the beam. Pump cavities are often coated, anodized, or otherwise made of a material that will not reflect at the lasing wavelength while reflecting at the pump wavelength.

A benefit of organic dyes is their high fluorescence efficiency. The greatest losses in many lasers and other fluorescence devices is not from the transfer efficiency (absorbed versus reflected/transmitted energy) or quantum yield (emitted number of photons per absorbed number), but from the losses when high-energy photons are absorbed and reemitted as photons of longer wavelengths. Because the energy of a photon is determined by its wavelength, the emitted photons will be of lower energy; a phenomenon called the Stokes shift. The absorption centers of many dyes are very close to the emission centers. Sometimes the two are close enough that the absorption profile slightly overlaps the emission profile. As a result, most dyes exhibit very small Stokes shifts and consequently allow for lower energy losses than many other laser types due to this phenomenon. The wide absorption profiles make them particularly suited to broadband pumping, such as from a flashtube. It also allows a wide range of pump lasers to be used for any certain dye and, conversely, many different dyes can be used with a single pump laser.

==CW dye lasers==
Continuous-wave (CW) dye lasers often use a dye jet. CW dye-lasers can have a linear or a ring cavity, and provided the foundation for the development of femtosecond lasers.

==Narrow linewidth dye lasers==
Dye lasers&#x27; emission is inherently broad. However, tunable narrow linewidth emission has been central to the success of the dye laser. In order to produce narrow bandwidth tuning these lasers use many types of cavities and resonators which include gratings, prisms, multiple-prism grating arrangements, and etalons.

The first narrow linewidth dye laser, introduced by Hänsch, used a Galilean telescope as beam expander to illuminate the diffraction grating. Next were the grazing-incidence grating designs and the multiple-prism grating configurations. The various resonators and oscillator designs developed for dye lasers have been successfully adapted to other laser types such as the diode laser. The physics of narrow-linewidth multiple-prism grating lasers was explained by Duarte and Piper.

==Chemicals used==
Some of the laser dyes are rhodamine (orange, 540–680 nm), fluorescein (green, 530–560 nm), coumarin (blue 490–620 nm), stilbene (violet 410–480 nm), umbelliferone (blue, 450–470 nm), tetracene, malachite green, and others. While some dyes are actually used in food coloring, most dyes are very toxic, and often carcinogenic. Many dyes, such as rhodamine 6G, (in its chloride form), can be very corrosive to all metals except stainless steel. Although dyes have very broad fluorescence spectra, the dye&#x27;s absorption and emission will tend to center on a certain wavelength and taper off to each side, forming a tunability curve, with the absorption center being of a shorter wavelength than the emission center. Rhodamine 6G, for example, has its highest output around 590 nm, and the conversion efficiency lowers as the laser is tuned to either side of this wavelength.

A wide variety of solvents can be used, although most dyes will dissolve better in some solvents than in others. Some of the solvents used are water, glycol, ethanol, methanol, hexane, cyclohexane, cyclodextrin, and many others. Solvents can be highly toxic, and can sometimes be absorbed directly through the skin, or through inhaled vapors. Many solvents are also extremely flammable. The various solvents can also have an effect on the specific color of the dye solution, the lifetime of the singlet state, either enhancing or quenching the triplet state, and, thus, on the lasing bandwidth and power obtainable with a particular laser-pumping source.

Adamantane is added to some dyes to prolong their life.

Cycloheptatriene and cyclooctatetraene (COT) can be added as triplet quenchers for rhodamine G, increasing the laser output power. Output power of 1.4 kilowatt at 585 nm was achieved using Rhodamine 6G with COT in methanol-water solution.

==Excitation lasers==
Flashlamps and several types of lasers can be used to optically pump dye lasers. A partial list of excitation lasers include:

*Copper vapor lasers
*Diode lasers
*Excimer lasers
*s (mainly second and third harmonics)
*Nitrogen lasers
*Ruby lasers
*Argon ion lasers in the CW regime
*Krypton ion lasers in the CW regime

==Ultra-short optical pulses==
R. L. Fork, B. I. Greene, and C. V. Shank demonstrated, in 1981, the generation of ultra-short laser pulse using a ring-dye laser (or dye laser exploiting colliding pulse mode-locking). This kind of laser is capable of generating laser pulses of ~ 0.1 ps duration.

The introduction of grating techniques and intra-cavity prismatic pulse compressors eventually resulted in the routine emission of femtosecond dye laser pulses. 
==Applications==
Dye lasers are very versatile. In addition to their recognized wavelength agility these lasers can offer very large pulsed energies or very high average powers. Flashlamp-pumped dye lasers have been shown to yield hundreds of Joules per pulse and copper-laser-pumped dye lasers are known to yield average powers in the kilowatt regime.

Dye lasers are used in many applications including:

* astronomy (as laser guide stars),
* atomic vapor laser isotope separation
* manufacturing
* medicine
* spectroscopy

In laser medicine these lasers are applied in several areas, including dermatology where they are used to make skin tone more even. The wide range of wavelengths possible allows very close matching to the absorption lines of certain tissues, such as melanin or hemoglobin, while the narrow bandwidth obtainable helps reduce the possibility of damage to the surrounding tissue. They are used to treat port-wine stains and other blood vessel disorders, scars and kidney stones. They can be matched to a variety of inks for tattoo removal, as well as a number of other applications.

In spectroscopy, dye lasers can be used to study the absorption and emission spectra of various materials. Their tunability, (from the near-infrared to the near-ultraviolet), narrow bandwidth, and high intensity allows a much greater diversity than other light sources. The variety of pulse widths, from ultra-short, femtosecond pulses to continuous-wave operation, makes them suitable for a wide range of applications, from the study of fluorescent lifetimes and semiconductor properties to lunar laser ranging experiments.

Tunable lasers are used in swept-frequency metrology to enable measurement of absolute distances with very high accuracy. A two axis interferometer is set up and by sweeping the frequency, the frequency of the light returning from the fixed arm is slightly different from the frequency returning from the distance measuring arm. This produces a beat frequency which can be detected and used to determine the absolute difference between the lengths of the two arms.

<text>Tylers Green is a village in the civil parish of Chepping Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, England.

The village is adjoined on one side by Hazlemere and on the other by Penn. &quot;Penn and Tylers Green&quot; are often referred to as one. Tylers Green centres on a village green where an annual fête is held. In one corner of the green is a duck pond.

==History==
Artefacts have been found suggesting habitation in Penn and Tylers Green since the Stone Age. In the 12th century, the village was known as Garretts Green. By the 14th century, the name was changed to Tiler End Green as it became known for well-organized commercial tile workshops.

In 2006, Thames Valley Police cordoned off the woodland between Tylers Green, Totteridge, Micklefield and High Wycombe (Kingswood) for a fingertip search for evidence linked to the 2006 transatlantic aircraft plot. The woodland remained cordoned off for four months before being reopened in November 2006.

==Geography==
The village is in the Chiltern Hills and from here there are many walks through beech woodland which once supplied the furniture industry in High Wycombe.

==Amenities==

The Church of England parish church of St Margaret was built in 1854 of flint and stone and is Grade II listed. The wooden bell-turret was added in 1891. The ashes of Arthur Whitten Brown, the navigator of the 1919 Transatlantic flight of Alcock and Brown, the first non-stop crossing of the Atlantic, are buried in St Margaret&#x27;s churchyard.

The village has two schools, Tylers Green First School for children aged 4 – 7 and Tylers Green Middle School for children aged 7 – 11.

It has its own football club, Penn &amp; Tylers Green F. C, which was established in 1905.

<text>A flashtube (flashlamp) produces an electrostatic discharge with an extremely intense, incoherent, full-spectrum white light for a very short time. A flashtube is a glass tube with an electrode at each end and is filled with a gas that, when triggered, ionizes and conducts a high-voltage pulse to make light. Flashtubes are used most in photography; they also are used in science, medicine, industry, and entertainment.

==Construction==
The lamp consists of a hermetically sealed glass tube which is filled with a noble gas, usually xenon, and electrodes to carry electric current to the gas. Additionally, a high voltage power source is necessary to energize the gas as a trigger event. A charged capacitor is usually used to supply energy for the flash, so as to allow very speedy delivery of very high electrical current when the lamp is triggered.

===Glass envelopes===
The glass envelope is most commonly a thin tube, often made of fused quartz, borosilicate or Pyrex, which may be straight, or bent into a number of different shapes, including helical, &quot;U&quot; shape, and circular (to surround a camera lens for shadowless photography—&#x27;ring flashes&#x27;). In some applications, the emission of ultraviolet light is undesired, whether due to production of ozone, damage to laser rods, degradation of plastics, or other detrimental effects. In these cases, a doped fused silica is used. Doping with titanium dioxide can provide different cutoff wavelengths on the ultraviolet side, but the material suffers from solarization; it is often used in medical and sun-ray lamps and some non-laser lamps. A better alternative is a cerium-doped quartz; it does not suffer from solarization and has higher efficiency, as part of the absorbed ultraviolet is reradiated as visible via fluorescence. Its cutoff is at about 380 nm. Conversely, when ultraviolet is called for, a synthetic quartz is used as the envelope; it is the most expensive of the materials, but it is not susceptible to solarization and its cutoff is at 160 nm.

The power level of the lamps is rated in watts/area, total electrical input power divided by the lamp&#x27;s inner wall surface. Cooling of the electrodes and the lamp envelope is of high importance at high power levels. Air cooling is sufficient for lower average power levels. High power lamps are cooled with a liquid, typically by flowing deionized water through a tube in which the lamp is encased. Water-cooled lamps will generally have the glass shrunk around the electrodes, to provide a direct thermal conductor between them and the cooling water. The cooling medium should flow also across the entire length of the lamp and electrodes. High average power or continuous-wave arc lamps must have the water flow across the ends of the lamp, and across the exposed ends of the electrodes as well, so the deionized water is used to prevent a short circuit. Above 15 W/cm2 forced air cooling is required; liquid cooling if in a confined space. Liquid cooling is generally necessary above 30 W/cm2.

Thinner walls can survive higher average-power loads due to lower mechanical strain across the thickness of the material, which is caused by a temperature gradient between the hot plasma and cooling water, (e.g. 1 mm thick doped quartz has a limit of 160 W/cm2, a 0.5 mm thick one has a limit of 320 W/cm2). For this reason, thinner glass is often used for continuous-wave arc-lamps. Thicker materials can generally handle more impact energy from the shock wave that a short-pulsed arc can generate, so quartz as much as 1 mm thick is often used in the construction of flashtubes. The material of the envelope provides another limit for the output power; 1 mm thick fused quartz has a limit of 200 W/cm2, synthetic quartz of same thickness can run up to 240 W/cm2. Other glasses such as borosilicate generally have less than half the power loading capacity of quartz. Aging lamps require some derating, due to increased energy absorption in the glass due to solarization and sputtered deposits.

===Electrodes and seals===
The electrodes protrude into each end of the tube, and are sealed to the glass using a few different methods. &quot;Ribbon seals&quot; use thin strips of molybdenum foil bonded directly to the glass, which are very durable, but are limited in the amount of current that can pass through. &quot;Solder seals&quot; bond the glass to the electrode with a solder for a very strong mechanical seal, but are limited to low temperature operation. Most common in laser pumping applications is the &quot;rod seal&quot;, where the rod of the electrode is wetted with another type of glass and then bonded directly to a quartz tube. This seal is very durable and capable of withstanding very high temperature and currents. The seal and the glass must have the same coefficient of thermal expansion.

For low electrode wear the electrodes are usually made of tungsten, which has the highest melting point of any metal, to handle the thermionic emission of electrons. Cathodes are often made from porous tungsten filled with a barium compound, which gives low work function; the structure of cathode has to be tailored for the application. Anodes are usually made from pure tungsten, or, when good machinability is required, lanthanum-alloyed tungsten, and are often machined to provide extra surface area to cope with power loading. DC arc lamps often have a cathode with a sharp tip, to help keep the arc away from the glass and to control temperature. Flashtubes usually have a cathode with a flattened radius, to reduce the incidence of hot spots and decrease sputter caused by peak currents, which may be in excess of 1000 amperes. Electrode design is also influenced by the average power. At high levels of average power, care has to be taken to achieve sufficient cooling of the electrodes. While anode temperature is of lower importance, overheating the cathode can greatly reduce the lamp&#x27;s life expectancy.

===Gases and fill pressure===
Depending on the size, type, and application of the flashtube, gas fill pressures may range from a few kilopascals to hundreds of kilopascals (0.01–4.0 atmospheres or tens to thousands of torr). Generally, the higher the pressure, the greater the output efficiency. Xenon is used mostly because of its good efficiency, converting nearly 50% of electrical energy into light. Krypton, on the other hand, is only about 40% efficient, but at low currents is a better match to the absorption spectrum of s. A major factor affecting efficiency is the amount of gas behind the electrodes, or the &quot;dead volume&quot;. A higher dead volume leads to a lower pressure increase during operation.

==Operation==

The electrodes of the lamp are usually connected to a capacitor, which is charged to a relatively high voltage (generally between 250 and 5000 volts), using a step up transformer and a rectifier. The gas, however, exhibits extremely high resistance, and the lamp will not conduct electricity until the gas is ionized. Once ionized, or &quot;triggered&quot;, a spark will form between the electrodes, allowing the capacitor to discharge. The sudden surge of electric current quickly heats the gas to a plasma state, where electrical resistance becomes very low. There are several methods of triggering.

===External triggering===
External triggering is the most common method of operation, especially for photographic use. The electrodes are charged to a voltage high enough to respond to triggering, but below the lamp&#x27;s self-flash threshold. An extremely high voltage pulse, (usually between 2000 and 150,000 volts), the &quot;trigger pulse&quot;, is applied either directly to or very near the glass envelope. (Water-cooled flashtubes sometimes apply this pulse directly to the cooling water, and often to the housing of the unit as well, so care must be taken with this type of system.) The short, high voltage pulse creates a rising electrostatic field, which ionizes the gas inside the tube. The capacitance of the glass couples the trigger pulse into the envelope, where it exceeds the breakdown voltage of the gas surrounding one or both of the electrodes, forming spark streamers. The streamers propagate via capacitance along the glass at a speed of 1 centimeter in 60 nanoseconds (170 km/s). (A trigger pulse must have a long enough duration to allow one streamer to reach the opposite electrode, or erratic triggering will result.) The triggering can be enhanced by applying the trigger pulse to a &quot;reference plane&quot;, which may be in the form of a metal band or reflector affixed to the glass, a conductive paint, or a thin wire wrapped around the length of the lamp. If the capacitor voltage is greater than the voltage drop between the cathode and the anode, when the internal spark streamers bridge the electrodes the capacitor will discharge through the ionized gas, heating the xenon to a high enough temperature for the emission light.

===Series triggering===
Series triggering is more common in high powered, water-cooled flashtubes, such as those found in lasers. The high-voltage leads of the trigger-transformer are connected to the flashtube in series, (one lead to an electrode and the other to the capacitor), so that the flash travels through both the transformer and the lamp. The trigger pulse forms a spark inside the lamp, without exposing the trigger voltage to the outside of the lamp. The advantages are better insulation, more reliable triggering, and an arc that tends to develop well away from the glass, but at a much higher cost. The series-triggering transformer also acts as an inductor. This helps to control the flash duration, but prevents the circuit from being used in very fast discharge applications. The triggering can generally take place with a lower voltage at the capacitor than is required for external triggering. However, the trigger-transformer becomes part of the flash circuit, and couples the triggering-circuit to the flash energy. Therefore, because the trigger-transformer has very low impedance, the transformer, triggering-circuit, and silicon controlled rectifier (SCR) must be able to handle very high peak-currents, often in excess of 1500 amps.

===Simmer-voltage triggering===
Simmer-voltage triggering is the least common method. In this technique, the capacitor voltage is not initially applied to the electrodes, but instead, a high voltage spark streamer is maintained between the electrodes. The high current from the capacitor is delivered to the electrodes using a thyristor or a spark gap. This type of triggering is used mainly in very fast rise time systems, typically those that discharge in the microsecond regime, such as used in high-speed, stop-motion photography or dye lasers. The simmering spark-streamer causes the arc to develop in the exact center of the lamp, increasing the lifetime dramatically. If external triggering is used for extremely short pulses, the spark streamers may still be in contact with the glass when the full current-load passes through the tube, causing wall ablation, or in extreme cases, cracking or even explosion of the lamp. However, because very short pulses often call for very high voltage and low capacitance, to keep the current density from rising too high, some microsecond flashtubes are triggered by simply &quot;over-volting&quot;, that is, by applying a voltage to the electrodes which is much higher than the lamp&#x27;s self-flash threshold, using a spark gap. Often, a combination of simmer voltage and over-volting is used.

===Prepulse techniques===
Very rapid rise-times are often achieved using a prepulse technique. This method is performed by delivering a small flash through the lamp just before the main flash. This flash is of much lower energy than the main flash (typically less than 10%) and, depending on the pulse duration, is delivered just a few thousandths to a few millionths of a second before the main flash. The prepulse heats the gas, producing a dim, short-lived afterglow that results from free electrons and ionized particles that remain after the pulse shuts down. If the main flash is initiated before these particles can recombine, this provides a good quantity of ionized particles to be used by the main flash. This greatly decreases the rise time. It also reduces the shock wave and makes less noise during operation, vastly increasing the lifetime of the lamp. It is especially effective on very fast-discharge applications, allowing the arc to expand faster and better fill the tube. It is very often used with simmer voltage and sometimes with series triggering, but rarely used with external triggering. Prepulse techniques are most commonly used in the pumping of dye lasers, greatly increasing the conversion efficiency. However, it has also been shown to increase the efficiency of other lasers with longer fluorescence lifetimes (allowing longer pulses), such as Nd:YAG or titanium sapphire, by creating pulses with almost square waveforms.

===Ablative flashtubes===
Ablative flashtubes are triggered by under-pressurizing. Ablative flashtubes are typically constructed using quartz tubing and one or both electrodes hollowed out, allowing a vacuum pump to be attached to control the gas pressure. The electrodes of the lamp are connected to a charged capacitor, and then the gas is vacuumed from the lamp. When the gas reaches a low enough pressure (often just a few torr) randomly-ionized particles are able to accelerate to velocities sufficient to begin ejecting electrons from the cathode as they impact its surface, resulting in a Townsend avalanche that causes the lamp to self-flash. At such low pressures, the efficiency of the flash would normally be very low. However, because of the low pressure, the particles have room to accelerate to very high speeds, and the magnetic forces expand the arc so that the bulk of its plasma becomes concentrated at the surface, bombarding the glass. The bombardment ablates (vaporizes) large amounts of quartz from the inner wall. This ablation creates a sudden, violent, localized increase in the internal pressure of the lamp, increasing the efficiency of the flash to very high levels. The ablation, however, causes extensive wear to the lamp, weakening the glass, and they typically need replacement after a very short lifetime.

Ablative flashtubes need to be refilled and vacuumed to the proper pressure for each flash. Therefore, they cannot be used for very high-repetition applications. Also, this usually precludes the use of very expensive gases like krypton or xenon. The most common gas used in an ablative flashtube is air, although sometimes cheap argon is also used. The flash usually must be very short to prevent too much heat from transferring to the glass. However, because nearly all the plasma is concentrated at the surface, the lamps have very low inductance and flashes can often be shorter than a normal lamp of comparative size. The flash from a single ablative flashtube can also be more intense than multiple lamps. For these reasons, the most common use for the lamps is for the pumping of dye lasers.

===Variable pulse width control===
In addition, an insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) can be connected in series with both the trigger transformer and the lamp, making adjustable flash durations possible. An IGBT used for this purpose must be rated for a high pulsed-current, so as to avoid over-current damage to the semiconductor junction. This type of system is used frequently in high average-power laser systems, and can produce pulses ranging from 500 microseconds to over 20 milliseconds. It can be used with any of the triggering techniques, like external and series, and can produce square wave pulses. It can even be used with simmer voltage to produce a &quot;modulated&quot; continuous wave output, with repetition rates over 300 hertz. With the proper large bore, water-cooled flashtube, several kilowatts of average-power output can be obtained.

===Electrical requirements===
The electrical requirements for a flashtube can vary, depending on the desired results. The usual method is to first determine the pulse duration, the maximum amount of energy tolerable at that duration (explosion energy), and the safe amount of operating energy. Then pick a current density that will emit the desired spectrum, and let the lamp&#x27;s resistance determine the necessary combination of voltage and capacitance to produce it. The resistance in flashtubes varies greatly, depending on pressure, shape, dead volume, current density, time, and flash duration, and therefore, is usually referred to as impedance. The most common symbol used for lamp impedance is Ko, which is expressed as ohms per the square root of amps (ohms(amps0.5).

Ko is used to calculate the amount of input voltage and capacitance needed to emit a desired spectrum, by controlling the current density. Ko is determined by the internal diameter, arc length, and gas type of the lamp and, to a lesser extent, by fill pressure. The resistance in flashtubes is not constant, but quickly drops as current density increases. In 1965, John H. Goncz showed that the plasma resistivity in flashtubes is inversely proportional to the square root of current density. As the arc develops, the lamp experiences a period of negative resistance, causing both the resistance and voltage to decrease as the current increases. This occurs until the plasma comes into contact with the inner wall. When this happens, the voltage becomes proportional to the square root of current, and the resistance in the plasma becomes stable for the remainder of the flash. It is this value which is defined as Ko. However, as the arc develops the gas expands, and calculations for Ko do not take into account the dead volume, which leads to a lower pressure increase. Therefore, any calculation of Ko is merely an approximation of lamp impedance.

==Output spectrum==
===Xenon===

As with all ionized gases, xenon flashtubes emit light in various spectral lines. This is the same phenomenon that gives neon signs their characteristic color. However, neon signs emit red light because of extremely low current-densities when compared to those seen in flashtubes, which favors spectral lines of longer wavelengths. Higher current-densities tend to favor shorter wavelengths. The light from xenon, in a neon sign, likewise is rather violet. 

The spectrum emitted by flashtubes is far more dependent on current density than on the fill pressure or gas type. Low current-densities produce narrow spectral-line emission, against a faint background of continuous radiation. Xenon has many spectral lines in the UV, blue, green, red, and IR portions of the spectrum. Low current densities produce a greenish-blue flash, indicating the absence of significant yellow or orange lines. At low current-densities, most of xenon&#x27;s output will be directed into the invisible IR spectral lines around 820, 900, and 1000 nm. Low current-densities for flashtubes are generally less than 1000 A/cm2.

Higher current-densities begin to produce continuum emission. Spectral lines broaden and become less dominant as light is produced across the spectrum, usually peaking, or &quot;centered&quot;, on a certain wavelength. Optimum output-efficiency in the visual range is obtained at a density that favors &quot;greybody radiation&quot; (an arc that produces mostly continuum emission, but is still mostly translucent to its own light; an effect similar to sunlight when it passes through a cloud). For xenon, greybody radiation is centered near green, and produces the right combination for white light. Greybody radiation is produced at densities above 2400 A/cm2.

Current densities that are very high, approaching 4000 A/cm2, tend to favor black-body radiation. Spectral lines all but disappear as the continuum radiation dominates, and output center shifts toward the ultraviolet. As current densities become even higher, visually, xenon&#x27;s output spectrum will begin to settle on that of a blackbody radiator with a color temperature of 9800 kelvins (a rather sky-blue shade of white). Except in cases where intense UV light is needed, such as water decontamination, blackbody radiation is usually not desired because the arc becomes opaque, and much of the radiation from within the arc can be absorbed before reaching the surface, impairing output efficiency.

Due to its high-efficiency, white output, xenon is used extensively for photographic applications, despite its great expense. In lasers, spectral-line emission is usually favored, as these lines tend to better match absorption lines of the lasing media. Krypton is also occasionally used. At low current-densities, krypton&#x27;s spectral-line output in the near-IR range is better matched to the absorption profile of neodymium-based laser media than xenon emission, and very closely matches the narrow absorption-profile of Nd:YAG. None of xenon&#x27;s spectral lines match Nd:YAG&#x27;s absorption lines so, when pumping Nd:YAG with xenon, the continuum radiation must be used.

===Krypton and other gases===

All gases produce spectral lines which are specific to the gas, superimposed on a background of continuum radiation. With all gases, low current-densities produce mostly spectral lines, with the highest output being concentrated in the near-IR between 650 and 1000 nm. Krypton&#x27;s strongest peaks are around 760 and 810 nm. Argon has many strong peaks at 670, 710, 760, 820, 860, and 920 nm. Neon has peaks around 650, 700, 850, and 880 nm. As current densities become higher, the output of continuum radiation will increase more than the spectral-line radiation at a rate 20% greater, and output center will shift toward the visual spectrum. At greybody current-densities there is only a slight difference in the spectrum emitted by various gases. At very high current-densities, all gases will begin to operate as blackbody radiators, with spectral outputs resembling a blue giant star, centered in the UV.

Heavier gases exhibit higher resistance, and therefore, have a higher value for Ko. Impedance, being defined as the resistance required to change energy into work, is higher for heavier gases, and as such, the heavier gases are much more efficient than the lighter ones. Helium and neon are far too light to produce an efficient flash. Krypton can be as good as 40% efficient, but requires up to a 70% increase in pressure over xenon to achieve this. Argon can be up to 30% efficient, but requires an even greater pressure-increase. At such high pressures, the voltage drop between the electrodes, formed by the spark streamer, may be greater than the capacitor voltage. These lamps often need a &quot;boost voltage&quot; during the trigger phase, to overcome the extremely high trigger-impedance.

Nitrogen, in the form of air, has been used in flashtubes in home made dye lasers, but the nitrogen and oxygen present form chemical reactions with the electrodes, and themselves, causing premature wear and the need to adjust the pressure for each flash.

Some research has been done on mixing gases to alter the spectral output. The effect on the output spectrum is negligible, but the effect on efficiency is great. Adding a lighter gas will only reduce the efficiency of the heavier one.

===Light production===
As the current pulse travels through the tube, it ionizes the atoms, causing them to jump to higher energy-levels. Three types of particles are found within the arc plasma, consisting of electrons, positively ionized atoms, and neutral atoms. At any given time during the flash, the ionized atoms make up less than 1% of the plasma and produce all of the emitted light. As they recombine with their lost electrons they immediately drop back to a lower energy-state, releasing photons in the process. The methods of transferring energy occur in three separate ways, called &quot;bound-bound&quot;, &quot;free-bound&quot;, and &quot;free-free&quot; transitions.

Within the plasma, positive ions accelerate toward the cathode while electrons accelerate toward the anode. Neutral atoms move toward the anode at a slower rate, filling some localized pressure differential created by the ions. At normal pressures this motion is in very short distances, because the particles interact and bump into each other, and, exchanging electrons, they reverse direction. Thus, during the pulse neutral atoms are constantly ionizing and recombining, emitting a photon each time, relaying electrons from the cathode to the anode. The greater the number of ion transitions for each electron; the better the conversion efficiency will be, so longer tubes or higher pressures both help increase the efficiency of the lamp. During the pulse, skin effect causes free electrons to gather near the inner wall, creating an electron sheath around the plasma. This makes the area electro-negative and helps to keep it cool. The skin effect also increases inductance by inducing eddy currents in the central plasma.

Bound-bound transitions occur when the ions and neutral atoms collide, transferring an electron from the atom to the ion. This method predominates at low current-densities, and is responsible for producing the spectral-line emission. Free-bound transitions happen when an ion captures a free electron. This method produces the continuum emission, and is more prominent at higher current-densities. Some of the continuum is also produced when an electron accelerates toward an ion, called free-free transitions, producing bremsstrahlung radiation. Bremsstrahlung radiation increases with increasing energy density, and causes a shift toward the blue and ultraviolet end of the spectrum.

==Intensity and duration of flash==
The only real electrical-limit to how short a pulse can be is the total-system inductance, including that of the capacitor, wires, and lamp itself. Short-pulse flashes require that all inductance be minimized. This is typically done using special capacitors, the shortest wires available, or electrical-leads with a lot of surface area but thin cross-sections. For extremely fast systems, low-inductance axial-leads, such as copper tubing, plastic-core wires, or even hollowed electrodes, may be used to decrease the total-system inductance. Dye lasers need very short pulses and sometimes use axial flashtubes, which have an annular cross section with a large outer diameter, ring-shaped electrodes, and a hollow inner core, allowing both lower inductance and a dye cell to be placed like an axle through the center of the lamp.

In contrast, changes in the input voltage or capacitance have no effect on discharge time, although they do have an effect on current density. As flash duration decreases, the electrical energy becomes concentrated into shorter pulses, so the current density will increase. Compensating for this usually requires lowering the capacitance as pulse duration decreases, and then raising the voltage proportionately in order to maintain a high enough energy-level. However, as pulse duration decreases, so does the &quot;explosion energy&quot; rating of the lamp, so the energy level must also be decreased to avoid destroying the lamp.

The amount of power loading the glass can handle is the major mechanical limit. Even if the amount of energy (joules) that is used remains constant, electrical power (wattage) will increase in inverse proportion to a decrease in discharge time. Therefore, energy must be decreased along with the pulse duration, to keep the pulsed power levels from rising too high. Quartz glass (1 millimeter thick per 1 second discharge) can usually withstand a maximum of 160 watts per square centimeter of internal surface-area. Other glasses have a much lower threshold. Extremely fast systems, with inductance below critical damping (0.8 microhenries), usually require a shunt diode across the capacitor, to prevent current reversal (ringing) from destroying the lamp. If the pulse is allowed to ring through the lamp it will lengthen the flash, so the diode traps the ringing, allowing the lamp to shut down at the correct time.

The limits to long pulse durations are the number of transferred electrons to the anode, sputter caused by ion bombardment at the cathode, and the temperature gradients of the glass. Pulses that are too long can vaporize large amounts of metal from the cathode, while overheating the glass will cause it to crack lengthwise. For continuous operation the cooling is the limit. Discharge durations for common flashtubes range from 0.1 microsecond to tens of milliseconds, and can have repetition rates of hundreds of hertz. Flash duration can be carefully controlled with the use of an inductor.

The flash that emanates from a xenon flashtube may be so intense that it can ignite flammable materials within a short distance of the tube. Carbon nanotubes are particularly susceptible to this spontaneous ignition when exposed to the light from a flashtube. Similar effects may be exploited for use in aesthetic or medical procedures known as intense pulsed light (IPL) treatments. IPL can be used for treatments such as hair removal and destroying lesions or moles.

==Lifetime==
The lifetime of a flashtube depends on both the energy level used for the lamp in proportion to its explosion energy, and on the pulse duration of the lamp. Failures can be catastrophic, causing the lamp to shatter, or they can be gradual, reducing the performance of the lamp below a usable rating.

===Catastrophic failure===
Catastrophic failure can occur from two separate mechanisms: energy and heat. When too much energy is used for the pulse duration, structural failure of the glass envelope can occur. Flashtubes produce an electrical arc flash contained in a glass tube. As the arc develops, a supersonic shock-wave forms, traveling radially from the center of the arc and impacting the inner wall of the tube. If the energy level is low enough, a tap against the glass is all that will be heard. However, if the energy level used equals the &quot;explosion energy&quot; rating of the lamp, the impacting shock wave will fracture the glass, rupturing the tube. The resulting explosion creates a loud, sonic shock-wave, and may throw shattered glass several feet. The explosion energy is calculated by multiplying the internal surface-area of the lamp, between the electrodes, with the power-loading capacity of the glass. Power loading is determined by the type and thickness of the glass, and the cooling method that is used. Power loading is measured in watts per centimeter squared. However, because the pulsed-power level increases as the flash duration decreases, the explosion energy must then be decreased in direct proportion to the square root of discharge time.

Failure from heat is usually caused by excessively long pulse-durations, high average-power levels, or inadequate electrode-size. The longer the pulse; the more of its intense heat will be transferred to the glass. When the inner wall of the tube gets too hot while the outer wall is still cold, this temperature gradient can cause the lamp to crack. Similarly, if the electrodes are not of a sufficient diameter to handle the peak currents they may produce too much resistance, rapidly heating up and thermally expanding. If the electrodes heat much faster than the glass, the lamp may crack or even shatter at the ends.

===Gradual failure===
The closer a flashtube operates to its explosion energy, the greater the risk becomes for catastrophic failure. At 50% of the explosion energy, the lamp may produce several thousand flashes before exploding. At 60% of the explosion energy, the lamp will usually fail in less than a hundred. If the lamp is operated below 30% of the explosion energy the risk of catastrophic failure becomes very low. The methods of failure then become those that reduce the output efficiency and affect the ability to trigger the lamp. The processes affecting these are sputter and ablation of the inner wall.

Sputter occurs when the energy level is very low, below 15% of the explosion energy, or when the pulse duration is very long. Sputter is the vaporization of metal from the cathode, which is redeposited on the walls of the lamp, blocking the light output. Because the cathode is more emissive than the anode, the flashtube is polarized, and connecting the lamp to the power source incorrectly will quickly ruin it. However, even if connected properly, the degree of sputter may vary considerably from lamp to lamp. Therefore, it is impossible to predict the lifetime accurately at low energy-levels.

At higher energy-levels, wall ablation becomes the main process of wear. The electrical arc slowly erodes the inner wall of the tube, forming microscopic cracks that give the glass a frosted appearance. The ablation releases oxygen from the glass, increasing the pressure beyond an operable level. This causes triggering problems, known as &quot;jitter.&quot; Above 30%, the ablation may cause enough wear to rupture the lamp. However, at energy levels greater than 15%, the lifetime can be calculated with a fair degree of accuracy.

When operated below 30% of the explosion energy, flashtube lifetime is generally between a few million to tens of millions of flashes.

==Applications==


As the duration of the flash that is emitted by a xenon flashtube can be accurately controlled, and due to the high intensity of the light, xenon flashtubes are commonly used as photographic strobe lights. Xenon flashtubes are also used in very high-speed or &quot;stop-motion&quot; photography, which was pioneered by Harold Edgerton in the 1930s. Because they can generate bright, attention-getting flashes with a relatively small, continuous input of electrical power, they are also used in aircraft warning lights, emergency vehicle lighting, fire alarm notification appliances (&quot;horn strobes&quot;), aircraft anticollision beacons, and other similar applications.

In dentistry it is used in &quot;light box&quot; devices to light-activate the hardening of various restorative and auxiliary light-curing resins (for example: Megaflash mini, Uni XS and other devices).

Due to their high intensity and relative brightness at short wavelengths (extending into the ultraviolet) and short pulse widths, flashtubes are also ideally suited as light sources for pumping atoms in a laser to excited states where they can be stimulated to emit coherent, monochromatic light. Proper selection of both the filler gas and current density is crucial, so that the maximum radiated output-energy is concentrated in the bands that are the best absorbed by the lasing medium; e.g. krypton flashtubes are more suitable than xenon flashtubes for pumping s, as krypton emission in near infrared is better matched to the absorption spectrum of Nd:YAG.

Xenon flashtubes have been used to produce an intense flash of white light, some of which is absorbed by Nd:glass that produces the laser power for inertial confinement fusion. In total about 1 to 1.5% of the electrical power fed into the flashtubes is turned into useful laser light for this application.

Pulsed light (PL) is a technique to decontaminate surfaces by killing microorganisms using pulses of an intense broad spectrum, rich in UV-C light. UV-C is the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum corresponding to the band between 200 and 280 nm. Pulsed light works with xenon lamps that can produce flashes several times per second. Disinfection robots use pulsed UV light.

A recent application of flashlamps is photonic curing.

==History==
The flashtube was invented by Harold Edgerton in the 1930s as a means to take sharp photographs of moving objects. Flashtubes were mainly used for strobe lights in scientific studies, but eventually began to take the place of chemical and powder flashbulbs and flash lamps in mainstream photography.

Because electrical arcs could be made that were much faster than mechanical-shutter speeds, early high-speed photographs were taken with an open-air, electrical-arc discharge, called spark photography, helping to remove blur from moving objects. This was typically done with the shutter locked open while in a dark or dimly lit room, to avoid overexposing the film, and a method of timing the flash to the event to be photographed. The earliest known use of spark photography began with Henry Fox Talbot around 1850. In 1886, Ernst Mach used an open-air spark to photograph a speeding bullet, revealing the shockwaves it produced at supersonic speeds. Open-air spark systems were fairly easy to build, but were bulky, very limited in light output, and produced loud noises comparable to that of a gunshot.

In 1927, Harold Edgerton built his first flash unit while at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Wanting to photograph the motion of a motor in vivid detail, without blur, Edgerton decided to improve the process of spark photography by using a mercury-arc rectifier, instead of an open-air discharge, to produce the light. He was able to achieve a flash duration of 10 microseconds, and was able to photograph the moving motor as if &quot;frozen in time.&quot;

His colleague&#x27;s interest in the new flash apparatus soon provoked Edgerton to improve upon the design. The mercury lamp&#x27;s efficiency was limited by the coolest part of the lamp, causing them to perform better when very hot but poorly when cold. Edgerton decided to try a noble gas instead, feeling that it would not be as temperature dependent as mercury, and, in 1930, he employed the General Electric company to construct some lamps using argon instead. The argon tubes were much more efficient, were much smaller, and could be mounted near a reflector, concentrating their output. Slowly, camera designers began to take notice of the new technology and began to accept it. Edgerton received his first major order for the strobes from the Kodak company in 1940. Afterward, he discovered that xenon was the most efficient of the noble gases, producing a spectrum very close to that of daylight, and xenon flashtubes became standard in most large photography sets. It was not until the 1970s that strobe units became portable enough to use in common cameras.

In 1960, after Theodore Maiman invented the ruby laser, a new demand for flashtubes began for use in lasers, and new interest was taken in the study of the lamps.

==Safety==
Flashtubes operate at high voltages, with currents high enough to be deadly. Under certain conditions, shocks as low as 1 joule have been reported to be lethal. The energy stored in a capacitor can remain surprisingly long after power has been disconnected. A flashtube will usually shut down before the capacitor has fully drained, and it may regain part of its charge through a process called &quot;dielectric absorption&quot;. In addition, some types of charging systems can be equally deadly themselves. The trigger voltage can deliver a painful shock, usually not enough to kill, but which can often startle a person into bumping or touching something more dangerous. When a person is charged to high voltages a spark can jump, delivering the high capacitor current without actually touching anything.

Flashtubes operate at high pressures and are known to explode, producing violent shockwaves. The &quot;explosion energy&quot; of a flashtube (the amount of energy that will destroy it in just a few flashes) is well defined, and to avoid catastrophic failure, it is recommended that no more than 30% of the explosion energy be used. Flashtubes should be shielded behind glass or in a reflector cavity. If not, eye and ear protection should be worn.

Flashtubes produce very intense flashes, often faster than the eye can register, and may not appear as bright as they are. Quartz glass will transmit nearly all of the long and short wave UV, including the germicidal wavelengths, and can be a serious hazard to eyes and skin. This ultraviolet radiation can also produce large amounts of ozone, which can be harmful to people, animals, and equipment.

Many compact cameras charge the flash capacitor immediately after power-up, and some even just by inserting the batteries. Merely inserting the battery into the camera can prime the capacitor to become dangerous or at least unpleasant for up to several days. The energy involved is also fairly significant; a 330 microfarad capacitor charged to 300 volts (common ballpark values found in cameras) stores almost 15 joules of energy.

==Popular culture==
In the 1969 book &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot; and the 1971 motion picture, specialized exposure to a xenon flash apparatus was used to burn off the outer epithelial layers of human skin as an antiseptic measure to eliminate all possible bacterial access for persons working in an extreme, ultraclean environment. (The book used the term &#x27;ultraflash&#x27;; the movie identified the apparatus as a &#x27;xenon flash&#x27;.)
==Animation==

Frame 1: The tube is dark.

Frame 2: The trigger pulse ionizes the gas, glowing with a faint, blue light. Spark streamers form from each electrode, moving toward each other along the inner surface of the glass tube.

Frame 3: Spark streamers connect and move away from the glass, and a plasma tunnel forms allowing current to surge.

Frame 4: Capacitor current begins to run away, heating the surrounding xenon.

Frame 5: As resistance decreases voltage drops and current fills the tube, heating the xenon to a plasma state.

Frame 6: Fully heated, resistance and voltage stabilize into an arc and the full current load rushes through the tube, causing the xenon to emit a burst of light.

<text>Helmut Josef Geier (born 6 September 1962), known professionally as DJ Hell, is a German DJ.

== Biography ==
=== 1970s and 1980s ===
DJ Hell described his musical beginnings in an interview with &quot;The European&quot;, telling them “I was socialized with German electronic music of the 1960s and 1970s. There were no commercial aspirations; it was all about experimentation.”

Hell has worked as a DJ since 1978. Starting in 1983, he began working as a DJ at Club Libella in Kirchweidach, Germany, near his hometown of Altenmarkt an der Alz. This would be his first residency, where he cultivated his eclectic style of mixing New Wave, Ska, Punk, Rockabilly, Hip hop, and Disco in the same set. Further residencies followed, at Park Café and Tanzlokal Grössenwahn in Munich, where, as one of the first house DJs in Germany he regularly performed at house music parties. In 1987 he organized the first acid house party there, and in the same year at Grössenwahn deejayed at Run–D.M.C.’s aftershow party. At the end of the 1980s, he developed his style at various Munich clubs and dance halls from New Wave, EBM, Electro, and Hip hop to include House and Techno.

=== 1990s ===
In the early 1990s, DJ Hell was resident DJ at Germany&#x27;s first afterhours club Babalu Club in Munich. In 1991, Hell was instrumental in establishing Peter Wacha&#x27;s label Disko B, and until 1996 was closely involved as A&amp;R. The label&#x27;s first release in 1991, Silicon Soul’s track &quot;Who Needs Sleep Tonight&quot; was licensed by Hell, who produced a remix for the b-side: &quot;The DJ G. Hell Remix&quot;. To sign the contract with the New York band, he flew to New York City. Disko B Records was launched for the release.

Hell&#x27;s first self-produced single, &quot;My Definition of House Music&quot; (on R&amp;S) became a club hit in 1992 with over 100,000 records sold, drawing recognition to DJ Hell among the first generation of Techno DJs who also released records.

During his time with Disko B and until 1997, DJ Hell was also a resident DJ at Ultraschall, Munich&#x27;s first pure techno club, located on the site of the former Munich-Riem Airport and later at the former Pfanni factory compound &quot;Kunstpark Ost&quot;. During the 1990s DJ Hell had further residencies in Berlin, at E-Werk and WMF, from 1992 at Tresor, and in the 2000s at Watergate.

Parallel to his A&amp;R work in Munich, in 1992 DJ Hell became A&amp;R manager for the label Logic Records in Frankfurt, and in the same year compiled the world&#x27;s first trance compilation, &quot;Logic Trance&quot;.
In 1993 he lived for a year in New York City, where was booked as a resident DJ at Limelight, together with Jeff Mills. In 1994 DJ Hell moved to Berlin and worked for the record store Hard Wax. Hell&#x27;s debut album &quot;Geteert &amp; Gefedert&quot; (&quot;Tarred &amp; Feathered&quot;) was released on Disko B in 1994. In 1995, he moved back to Bavaria.

That same year, Hell was the only German DJ to be invited to be on a John Peel Session, including a radio interview, in London. The session was released that year on Disko B.

In addition to his work as a DJ and producer, in 1996 he founded the label International Deejay Gigolos in Munich, for which he served from the first day onward as the label mastermind, A&amp;R, and art director. Parallel to managing the label, as a DJ and event organizer, Hell also curated over 40 Bavarian Gigolo Nights featuring international DJs and live bands in various clubs in Munich.

During this period in the late 1990s, numerous releases on International Deejay Gigolos notably fuelled the 1980s revival in the German and international club scene, establishing DJ Hell as one of the founders of the Electroclash subgenre. International Deejay Gigolos has released works by big names on the international Techno, House, and Electro scenes, including Jeff Mills, Miss Kittin &amp; The Hacker, Dave Clarke, Tiga, Fischerspooner, Dopplereffekt, Vitalic, Bobby Konders, The KLF, Tuxedomoon, and Laurent Garnier. Fischerspooner was discovered by DJ Hell and debuted on International Deejay Gigolos. Stylistically, International Deejay Gigolos focused, beyond the Electroclash genre, also on Electro, EBM, electronic avant-garde House, Tech-House, and Techno, with influences from 1980s Pop and Disco. In the 20 years spanning 1996 to 2016 that he has handled A&amp;R for the label, Hell has released over 300 singles and albums on International Deejay Gigolos.

In 1998, Hell&#x27;s second album &quot;Munich Machine&quot; was released on Disko B and V2 Records. According to The Guardian Munich Machine was an important record that helped to catalyse electroclash. According to the music magazine De:Bug: “&quot;Munich Machine&quot; feels like the result of a dynamic collaboration by Munich residents engaged in the club scene and who know how to work with it. Every aspect of it has been carefully crafted and sometimes it seems as if DJ Hell is using this kind of mega-mix to grow beyond himself. This is particularly evident when he mixes together very different sources.”

In 1999, Arnold Schwarzenegger sued International Deejay Gigolos for using his picture in the logo. Hell had to stop selling all records that bore the logo and pay a fine of 150,000 euros.

=== 2000s ===
From 2000 to 2003, he ran the disco and nightclub Villa Traunstein, located in the Bavarian town of Traunstein, where he was responsible for the club&#x27;s high-profile, international DJ bookings, including the likes of WestBam, Sven Väth, and Jeff Mills.

In 2003, DJ Hell lived for a second time in New York City, where he produced his third studio album &quot;NY Muscle&quot;, for which he collaborated with several artists, including Alan Vega, Erlend Øye, James Murphy, and singer Billie Ray Martin. The website allmusic.com wrote about &quot;NY Muscle&quot;: “This is the sound of nighttime New York City from the outsider perspective of an infamous German named Hell, and it’s dark, dark, debauched fun.”

Since 2005, DJ Hell has been based in both Munich and Berlin, and moved the label office to Berlin. Since the early 2010s Hell lives again mainly in Munich and in his hometown Altenmarkt at the Chiemsee.

From 2007 to 2010, he served as musical coordinator for Berlin fashion designer Michael Michalsky, for whose fashion shows he regularly produced the music. Hell has also performed at the after-show parties of Michael Michalsky&#x27;s StyleNite, held during the Berlin Fashion Week. DJ Hell has been producing music for fashion shows since the mid-1990s, for the likes of Hugo Boss, Raf Simons, Patrick Mohr, Dirk Schönberger, and Donatella Versace – ever since he was first asked by fashion designer Kostas Murkudis to accompany one of his fashion shows in Berlin with music.

DJ Hell occasionally works with renowned fashion labels, either lending his name or collaborating as a designer. This work has given rise to an underwear collection for Wendy &amp; Jim, women&#x27;s underpants for Agent Provocateur, CD cases for Magma, and a pair of glasses for Freudenhaus. In 2004, Karl Lagerfeld photographed DJ Hell for V Magazine. These photographs were then exhibited at a gallery in Berlin. DJ Hell on his affinity for fashion (in &quot;SPEX&quot; #316/2008, p. 95f): “In England, fashion and music have gone together for decades. In Germany, however, one tends to deny a musician’s competence if he defines himself superficially, that is, according to things that are visible. Just think of David Bowie on the male side, and Grace Jones on the female side, and it becomes clear that a union between fashion and music can be incredibly prolific.”

As a DJ, Hell has toured worldwide, and repeatedly headlined international festivals such as the Loveparade and Mayday in Berlin, Fuji Rock and Wire in Tokyo, the Montreux Jazz Festival, and the Time Warp Festival in Mannheim. He was the first Techno DJ to perform at the University of Havana in 1997. The performance was filmed by a German film crew directed by Torsten Schulz, and screened in 2000. In 2002, Romuald Karmakar shot a segment of his film “196 BPM” during a performance by Hell at WMF.

In 2003, GQ magazine named DJ Hell “Man of the Year” in the category of music.
In 2009 Hell released the album &quot;Teufelswerk&quot; (&quot;Devil’s Work&quot;), which again features several international guest stars, such as Bryan Ferry, Peter Kruder, P. Diddy, Roberto di Gioia, Mijk van Dijk, Christian Prommer, and Billie Ray Martin. The double album is conceptually divided into “day” and “night” parts, and ranked in the Top 50 of the German Media Control charts.

According to Hell in an interview with &quot;Resident Advisor&quot;: “I did &quot;Kosmische Musik&quot; in a new way. This is where I come from, I grew up with the early German electronic pioneers of music, and this is why I went in this direction. Often it is called German electronic avant-garde, or psychedelic music. I went back to the &#x27;70s and tried to do it in my own way.”

The &quot;Guardian&quot; on &quot;Teufelswerk&quot;: “With Hell acting as conductor, and Kruder, Prommer, and Roberto di Gioia playing a mixture of synths, acoustic guitars, Wurlitzers and ‘rhythm machines,’ the four sweep back and forth across Europe, mapping the psychic highways that link Kraftwerk&#x27;s Düsseldorf and Jean Michel Jarre&#x27;s imaginary, futuristic Paris; Pink Floyd at the UFO Club in 1966, and Café del Mar in 1987; cavernous booming dubstep nights in modern Berlin and Goblin&#x27;s progressive 1970&#x27;s Italy.”

Since 2009, DJ Hell has supported the feminist Ukrainian activist group FEMEN with various DJ and television appearances.

The self-confessed fan of the FC Bayern Munich soccer club is a jersey sponsor for TSV Altenmarkt, the football club of his hometown. Contrary to rumors, he does not possess a professional coaching license. For the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Hell was booked as a DJ for the opening ceremony at the Olympic Stadium in Berlin, but the event was canceled on short notice by FIFA.

DJ Hell on his football passion in &quot;Alert&quot;, 8/2002: “I watch the home games of FC Bayern Munich. I also represented Germany as a DJ at the recent European and World Championships, travelling with the German national team from city to city, and deejayed on the evening before the games. My contract stated that the organizer had to get me tickets for the games.” (See &quot;Alert&quot; 8/2002, p. 51)

=== 2010s ===
In 2013, DJ Hell&#x27;s remix of Tim Deluxe&#x27;s track &quot;Transformation&quot; held the number 1 position on the Beatport techno charts for nine weeks.

In the same year, DJ Hell performed an hour live on &quot;Boiler Room TV&quot; on the occasion of the 1st birthday. This clip soon became a viral hit, with almost 880,000 views (Status: December 2020).

The countertenor and new wave singer Klaus Nomi interpreted Henry Purcell&#x27;s original composition from the opera “King Arthur” spectacularly in 1982 as an early hybrid of electronic and classical music. DJ Hell, who has admired Klaus Nomi since his early days as a DJ and has always DJ&#x27;d him, bought the rights to the original composition and released his reworked version of the song as a single on &quot;International Deejay Gigolos&quot; in 2014.

In 2015, DJ Hell gave a lecture together with Sascha Arnold at the Munich Chamber of Architects with a picture presentation about club architecture and culture in Munich during the 1970s and 1980s. In the same year, Electronic Beats by Telekom filmed a Slices documentary about DJ Hell.

For the Design Hotel Flushing Meadows in Munich, DJ Hell designed one of eleven hotel rooms on the third floor in 2015. The room is designed entirely in black color and houses as a design element a life-size band of metal skeletons on keyboard, electric guitar and mic stand above the bed.

For the 2015/16 winter collection of fashion designer Boris Bidjan Saberi, who now lives and works in Barcelona, DJ Hell produced the music in 2015, which can also be heard in an official promotional video by Saberi.

In spring 2017, DJ Hell&#x27;s fifth album &quot;Zukunftsmusik&quot; was released. Like his studio album &quot;Teufelswerk&quot; released eight years earlier, it was co-produced by Peter Kruder in Vienna. On Christmas Eve 2016 appeared with &quot;I Want U &quot; the first single release from the album. The accompanying video, produced by Hell, features animated gay comic artwork by Finnish artist Tom of Finland, who was known for homoerotic drawings of masculine men. The press photos for the album were taken by photographer Greg Gorman at his home in Los Angeles. Sven Marquardt, the photographer and bouncer of the techno club Berghain, was also involved with various photographs on DJ Hell covers of &quot;International Deejay Gigolos&quot;.

DJ Hell about &quot;future music&quot;: “This album is largely to be understood as a homage to gay culture, which with disco, house, Frankie Goes to Hollywood and techno can be seen as the nucleus of club culture. Club culture as we know it today is based at its core on the gay house culture invented by dj Ron hardy at Chicago&#x27;s Warehouse and paralleled by Larry levan at New York&#x27;s Paradise Garage.”

In Gerrit Starczewski&#x27;s 2017 Ruhrpott road movie &quot;Pottorginale&quot;, DJ Hell embodied a hitman. The sequel to the film, in which DJ Hell plays the pop singer Helmut, is scheduled for March 2021.

At the International Short Film Festival Oberhausen of 2017, DJ Hell&#x27;s video &quot;I Want U&quot; took second place of the &quot;MuVi Award&quot;. The jury judged the 4-minute video: “A beautiful collaboration that elevates both DJ Hell&#x27;s music and Tom of Finland&#x27;s imagery to a common and higher level. Funny, sexy and intelligent in its use of graphic material, I Want U builds on a concept that is confidently sustained. The film is simple but not repetitive, using variations in the music to drive the imagery. Full of allusions to the history of the music video, this is an original look at a much-loved part of the subversive canon.”.

For Balenciaga Paris, DJ Hell produced a DJ mix for various 3D art videos: &quot;Balenciaga Loop 05 - Nightlife&quot; and &quot;Balenciaga Loop 06 - After Hours&quot; He also played at the 2017 &amp; 2018 aftershow parties.

The own perfume – Helmut Josef Geier – was released in 2018, under the name &quot;DJ Hell “Techno”&quot;. It was presented at the Berlin Soho House store. &quot;My first perfume is based mainly on incense components. It gets its freshness from citrus elements and earthy components. I can&#x27;t reveal all the ingredients, but churches, like clubs, have always been meeting places for believers. I understand club music and club culture as faith, so a religion of its own.&quot;.

DJ Hell composed the soundtrack for the film &quot;Yung,&quot; which actor and director Henning Gronkowski shot in 2019. &quot;The film,&quot; said DJ Hell in an interview with the &quot;Frankfurter Rundschau,&quot; &quot;portrays daily lives of girls in the Berlin party jungle, unvarnished, direct and sensitive.&quot; The soundtrack wa released on Hell&#x27;s new output &quot;The DJ Hell Experience&quot;. The film had its world premiere at the Münchner Filmtage 2019.

In the late-night show &quot;Ringlstetter&quot; (BR), DJ Hell was a guest of Hannes Ringlstetter in September 2018.

=== 2020–present ===
In 2020, DJ Hell founded a new label called &quot;The DJ Hell Experience&quot;. The Hamburg-based distributor wordandsound is responsible for distribution. For the first album released under the new label, &quot;House Music Box,&quot; the artist Jonathan Meese contributed a picture for the cover. The electronic music magazine FAZEMAG chose &quot;House Music Box&quot; as the &quot;Album of the Year 2020&quot;. The album&#x27;s first video features a Hell avatar, which will also be used at festivals and shows in the future. Another collaboration with Meese is the album &quot;Meese x Hell - Hab keine Angst, hab keine Angst, ich bin deine Angst,&quot; to be released in April 2021 by Daniel Richter’s Buback, records Hamburg.

In March 2021, &quot;Soft Cell - Tainted Love Remix 2021&quot; was released on Cleopatra Records in the U.S.

To the book &quot;Mensch – Maschinen – Musik. Das Gesamtkunstwerk Kraftwerk,&quot; edited by Uwe Schütte (publication date February 2021), DJ Hell has written a detailed personal foreword.

In the exhibition “Nachts. Clubkultur in München“ („Nights. Club Culture in Munich”), which the Munich Stadtmuseum will be showing from April 2021 to January 2022, DJ Hell will play a significant role – he plans to make his record collection available to the museum for the show. The cultural-historical exhibition is dedicated to Munich&#x27;s nightlife and club culture from the post-war period to the present in the form of a nocturnal foray.

DJ Hell is one of the DFB ambassadors for the 2024 European Football Championship to be held in Germany, the UEFA Euro 2024.

DJ Hell is the designated curator of the nascent Museum of Modern Electronic Music (MOMEM) in Frankfurt am Main.

<doc id="387524" wikidata="Q2498737" url="?curid=387524" title="Dorney">
<text>Dorney is a village and civil parish in Buckinghamshire, England. It borders the River Thames to the west and south, and is bisected by the Jubilee River. In 2011 it had a population of 752. It is west of neighbouring Eton, which is a slightly larger parish.

It includes a grade I listed manor house, Dorney Court, as well as the largest rowing lake in the south of England, Dorney Lake. Water accounts for 13% of the area of Dorney, the highest proportion in Buckinghamshire.

==History==
Dorney Manor was mentioned in the Domesday Book, and was famed for honey; it is named after the Saxon for &quot;Island of Bees&quot;.

=== Dorney Court ===
Dorney Court adjoins the centre of the village and has comparable grounds to other village centre properties. It was, however, the manor house, so owned much of the land of the village until the late 18th century. It dates to the early Tudor period and is made from a timber frame with red brick. Its roof has original tiles. It has bold star-shaped timbers and a large fireplace with panels from Faversham Abbey, Kent.

One account of its early history reveals that the then adjoining Boveney manor, at the southern end of the village of Burnham, had an oak tree cut down by an employee. He defended his conduct by declaring that at a court in Buckinghamshire previously found Dorney to be a royal manor and that the green was therefore common land, so it was legal to cut the tree down.

A notable owner was William Garrard, who bought Dorney Court in 1542; he was later Lord Mayor of London from 1555 to 1556). Major C. H. D. Palmer owned it in 1925, having been passed down by earlier Palmers since 1624. Until after 1925, the manor&#x27;s family owned the rectory and maintained the church, a state of affairs which ended with the ending of all tithes in England and Wales.

=== Other history ===
The first pineapple in the UK was grown in Dorney Court, leading to a pub in the village being named The Pineapple. It is Grade II listed for its age, dating half to the 17th century and half to the 18th century.

In 1961, a cornfield in Dorney was the scene of a nationally reported abduction. A lone gunman, James Hanratty, abducted Valerie Storie and Michael Gregsten and forced them at gunpoint to drive to a lay-by at Maulden in Bedfordshire, where he shot and murdered Gregsten, raped Storie and shot her. She survived, paralysed.

==Topography==
The village is on the north bank of the River Thames, on very gently sloping land towards the river and inchoate streams which were mostly joined into the Jubilee River, mainly on gravel-underlain soil.

Eton is to the east. Slough, which is linked by two roads forming a rectangle with Dorney, is east-northeast.

Major rowing events take place at Dorney Lake, including the 2012 Summer Olympics and annual events such as the Wallingford, Marlow and Metropolitan Regattas. The Olympics also hosted canoeing events there, which continue to take place occasionally.

In the south-east, Dorney Common is a large traditional grassed common, roughly triangular, which is a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Owing to the continued use of the land for grazing, the common has panoramic views of Windsor Castle two and a half miles to the east.

==Local administration==
Dorney&#x27;s civil parish council covers minor upkeep, community events and recreational matters. Dorney is surrounded to the south, east and west by the non-metropolitan county of Berkshire, with a narrow border along its north (with Taplow and Burnham) further towards the heart of Buckinghamshire. This anomaly makes Dorney a salient, which dates to the Local Government Act 1972, which came into force on 1 April 1974; the village had been originally included in Berkshire in the related Bill, but an amendment to keep it in Buckinghamshire was proposed by local MP Ronald Bell and accepted by the government.

==Features==
There are 15 listed buildings in Dorney.

The village church&#x27;s chancel and nave date from the 12th century, the tower was built about 1540, and the north chapel and porch were added in the 17th century. Restoration work in the 19th century somewhat obscured its medieval decoration.

Dorneywood country house takes its name from the parish, although is just over its northeastern border. It is used as a home (and entertainment or state reception venue) for a senior member of the UK government, usually a Secretary of State or other minister.

==Transport==
The village has no railway station. A regular bus timetable operates to Windsor and Slough.

The village is partly bounded by the north by the M4 motorway, where there is a junction just after the road north from the village meets the A4 Bath Road for Slough &#x27;West&#x27;. This provides access to Heathrow Airport and London, and has meant that since the road&#x27;s construction, Dorney has been accessible to commuters from both London and the Thames Valley..

==Religion==
A majority of the inhabitants in 2011 (62.8%) described themselves as Christian. The sole parish church is Anglican and is dedicated to Saint James. More than 2% of the population are Hindu, Muslim, Jewish or Buddhist.

== Localities ==
In the parish of Dorney are the hamlets of Dorney Reach and Lake End; none centred more than apart.

=== Dorney Reach ===
Dorney Reach is a community on a riverside road, almost half of the homes of which are by the River Thames, overlooking Monkey Island. This side of the river is also the location of Bray Lock; its name is somewhat of a misnomer, as the village of Bray sits on the opposite side of the river from the lock.

=== Lake End ===
Lake End includes the Pineapple pub and is the only settled part north of the Jubilee River on the main northward road from the village. It has a public car park by the Jubilee River which enables access to its towpath and the buildings of Dorney and Lake End.

<text>Sarcelles () is a commune in the northern suburbs of Paris, France. It is located from the centre of Paris. Sarcelles is a sub-prefecture of the Val-d&#x27;Oise department and the seat of the arrondissement of Sarcelles.

In the south of the commune, during the 1950s and 1960s, vast housing estates were built in order to accommodate &quot;pieds-noirs&quot; (French settlers from Algeria) and Jews who had left Algeria due to its war of independence. A few Jews from Egypt settled there after the Suez crisis, and Jews from Tunisia and Morocco settled in Sarcelles after unrest and riots against Jews due to the Six-Day War and the Yom Kippur War.

==Transport==
Sarcelles is served by Garges–Sarcelles station on Paris RER line D.

It is also served by Sarcelles–Saint-Brice station on the Transilien Paris-Nord suburban rail line. This station, although administratively located on the territory of the neighbouring commune of Saint-Brice-sous-Forêt, lies in fact very near the town centre of Sarcelles.

==Population==

 the commune has about 40,000 residents from 40 backgrounds.

===Immigration===
A substantial number of inhabitants of the town are pieds-noirs from Northwest Africa who immigrated to France in the 1960s. Sarcelles is also home to a vibrant Jewish community and the largest concentration of Assyrians in France.

Rahsaan Maxwell, author of &quot;Ethnic Minority Migrants in Britain and France: Integration Trade-Offs&quot;, stated that compared with other French communities, the ethnic minorities in Sarcelles have more influence, so therefore &quot;Sarcelles should not be considered representative of cities across metropolitan France&quot;. Residents believe that there is a &quot;Sarcelles identity,&quot; meaning any ethnic group can be a part of the city, and they believe it lowers levels of crime and violence.

Compared with other parts of France, ethnic minorities in Sarcelles gained political power at a faster rate, with gains made in the 1980s instead of the 1990s and 2000s. Many politicians responded to minority demands sooner as many immigrants, especially Caribbeans and Sephardic Jews, had French citizenship. François Pupponi, the mayor in the 2000s dedicated monuments commemorating the histories of ethnic groups, authorised funding of organisations supporting specific ethnic groups such as running Arabic and Hindi language classes and permitted the use of public facilities for religious events. Pupponi argued that this style is the best method of giving many ethnic groups one sense of community. Critics argued that funding groups catering to specific ethnic groups promotes segregation.

====Caribbeans====
, 8.7% of the population was of Caribbean origin. , many of the ethnic Caribbean residents have French citizenship.

By the 1970s, Afro-Caribbeans became more interested in changing politics. By the 1980s, Guy Guyoubli, a local activist, organised an almost all-Caribbean protest list. Maxwell wrote that this demonstrated that Caribbeans had serious intentions of participating in the political system, even though there were no representatives elected from the lists. At the time, ethnic minorities across Metropolitan France were increasingly trying to influence the political system. The city&#x27;s first ever two Caribbean councillors were elected in 1989. Around 1989, Raymond Lamontagne, the mayor, opened Metropolitan France&#x27;s first ever Caribbean-orientated, council-funded community centre.

====Maghrebian Muslims====

In the 1950s and 1960s, Maghrebians began to arrive in Sarcelles. They developed political organisation in subsequent decades. Originally, the Muslims worshipped in converted makeshift areas, but, later, they built mosques for their community. 

In the 1990s, Maghrebians were first elected to the commune council. Maxwell wrote that Maghrebians did not begin to obtain &quot;key positions&quot; until about 2012, as they had had &quot;low turnout and weak community organisations&quot;.

====Assyrian Christians====

A memorial to Assyro-Chaldean victims of the 1915 Assyrian genocide was dedicated in 2005. Part of the film &quot;The Last Assyrians&quot; features the Assyrian community, including members of the Chaldean Catholic Church.

====Maghrebi Jews====
During the 1960s, many Maghrebi Jews migrated to France, settling in Sarcelles. They were chiefly from Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco. Today, most of the Jewish residents have French citizenship.

During the peak immigration of Maghrebi Jews, they subscribed to a belief in assimilation and secularism. They had the North African belief of what Michel Wieviorka and Philippe Bataille, authors of &quot;The Lure of Anti-Semitism: Hatred of Jews in Present-Day France&quot;, describe as &quot;a structuring role&quot; that &quot;does not cover all aspects of social life&quot;. Beginning in the 1980s, religion became more public and important. Wieviorka and Bataille stated that the previous North African practice is &quot;becoming mixed up with the neo-Orthodox practices of the &#x27;young people&#x27; for whom religion controls everything.&quot;

In 1983, a wave of councillors were elected who were Sephardic Jews from North Africa.

==Crime==

In 2012, Maxwell stated that &quot;petty crime&quot; and vandalism had become consistent issues. He said that &quot;violent confrontations&quot; among black migrants, Maghrebians, and Jews was &quot;a recurring theme&quot;. He added that, by 2012, the commune had &quot;developed a reputation as one of the more dangerous Paris suburbs.&quot; Maxwell wrote that local residents told him that the reputation was overblown.

Maxwell wrote that, during the 2005 French riots, a report concluded that the damage to buildings in Sarcelles was &quot;relatively moderate&quot;. A later report concluded that, compared with most cities, Sarcelles had fewer days of severe riots. He also said that local residents characterised the damage as &quot;not as bad as elsewhere and not as bad as one might have expected given Sarcelles&#x27;s economic and ethnic profile.&quot;
==International relations==

===Twin towns – sister cities===
Sarcelles is twinned with:
* Netanya, Israel, since 1988
* Hattersheim, Germany, since 1987

===Co-operation agreement===
* Martakert, Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, since 2015

==Education==
The commune has 19 public &quot;écoles maternelles&quot; (pre-schools/nurseries), 21 public &quot;écoles primaires&quot; (primary schools), six public &quot;collèges&quot; (junior high schools), two public &quot;lycées&quot; (senior high schools/sixth-form colleges), and two other educational institutions. 
* &quot;Collèges&quot;: Chantereine, Anatole-France, Évariste-Galois, Jean-Lurçat, Victor Hugo, and Voltaire

<doc id="387537" wikidata="Q2462783" url="?curid=387537" title="Computational learning theory">
<text>In computer science, computational learning theory (or just learning theory) is a subfield of artificial intelligence devoted to studying the design and analysis of machine learning algorithms.

==Overview==
Theoretical results in machine learning mainly deal with a type of inductive learning called supervised learning. In supervised learning, an algorithm is given samples that are labeled in some useful way. For example, the samples might be descriptions of mushrooms, and the labels could be whether or not the mushrooms are edible. The algorithm takes these previously labeled samples and uses them to induce a classifier. This classifier is a function that assigns labels to samples, including samples that have not been seen previously by the algorithm. The goal of the supervised learning algorithm is to optimize some measure of performance such as minimizing the number of mistakes made on new samples.

In addition to performance bounds, computational learning theory studies the time complexity and feasibility of learning. In
computational learning theory, a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time. There are two kinds of time
complexity results:

* Positive resultsShowing that a certain class of functions is learnable in polynomial time.
* Negative resultsShowing that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time.

Negative results often rely on commonly believed, but yet unproven assumptions, such as:

* Computational complexity – P ≠ NP (the P versus NP problem);
* Cryptographic – One-way functions exist.

There are several different approaches to computational learning theory based on making different assumptions about the inference principles used to generalise from limited data. This includes different definitions of probability (see frequency probability, Bayesian probability) and different assumptions on the generation of samples. The different approaches include:

* Exact learning, proposed by Dana Angluin;
* Probably approximately correct learning (PAC learning), proposed by Leslie Valiant;
* VC theory, proposed by Vladimir Vapnik and Alexey Chervonenkis;
* Inductive inference as developed by Ray Solomonoff;
* Algorithmic learning theory, from the work of E. Mark Gold;
* Online machine learning, from the work of Nick Littlestone.

While its primary goal is to understand learning abstractly, computational learning theory has led to the development of practical algorithms. For example, PAC theory inspired boosting, VC theory led to support vector machines, and Bayesian inference led to belief networks.

<text>Stowe is a civil parish and former village about northwest of Buckingham in the unitary authority area of Buckinghamshire, England. The parish includes the hamlets of Boycott, Dadford and Lamport.

Stowe House is a Grade I listed country house in the parish and is occupied by Stowe School.

==History==

Stowe&#x27;s toponym probably refers to an ancient holy place of great significance in Anglo-Saxon times. The manor of Stowe predates the Norman conquest of England. The Domesday Book of 1086 assessed the manor at five hides. It listed William the Conqueror&#x27;s half-brother Odo, Bishop of Bayeux as the manor&#x27;s feudal overlord and the Norman brothers-in-arms Robert D&#x27;Oyly and Roger d&#x27;Ivry as his tenants. D&#x27;Oyly founded Oxford Castle and he and d&#x27;Ivry founded a college of secular canons there. Not long after 1086 the manor of Stowe was transferred to the college&#x27;s endowment, confirmed by a charter of Henry I in 1130.

By 1150 the Augustinians of Osney Abbey had absorbed the college, and in 1278–79 it held three hides at Stowe. Osney Abbey retained Stowe until it was forced to surrender its estates to the Crown in the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1539. In 1542 the Diocese of Oxford was instituted and Osney Abbey was consecrated as its first cathedral. The abbey&#x27;s former estates, including Stowe, formed the bishopric&#x27;s endowment.

In 1590 John Underhill, Bishop of Oxford, conveyed Stowe to Elizabeth I, who in the same year granted it to new secular owners. They sold it to John Temple of Burton Dassett in Warwickshire, whose grandson Sir Peter Temple, 2nd Baronet enclosed a deer park in 1651. The village was probably abandoned at this time. The estate remained with the Temple-Grenville family until 1921, when it was sold by the Reverend Luis C.F.T. Morgan-Grenville (1889–1944). Stowe School was founded here in 1923.

==Parish church==
The earliest mention of the parish church of the Assumption of the Blessèd Virgin Mary is in Henry I&#x27;s charter of 1130. The oldest part of the building is the late 13th-century three-bay arcade between the nave and the north aisle. The west tower was added in the first half of the 13th century, followed by the chancel in about 1350 and the south aisle and arcade in the latter part of the 14th century. Late in the 15th century both aisles were rebuilt and the Perpendicular Gothic nave clerestory and south porch were added. In the 16th century the Perpendicular Gothic north chapel was added, with an arcade of two bays between it and the chancel. The church was altered in the 18th century and is now a Grade II* listed building.

In the late 17th century a ring of five bells was hung in the bell tower. James Keene, who had foundries at Woodstock, Oxfordshire and Bedford, cast the second, fourth and fifth bells in 1654. Richard Keene cast the third bell in 1660 and the tenor in 1665. In 1988 John Taylor &amp; Co of Loughborough cast a new treble bell, increasing the ring to six. The church has a Sanctus bell that was cast in about 1799.

==Stowe House==

Formerly the country seat of the Dukes of Buckingham and Chandos, Stowe House is now occupied by Stowe School. The landscaped gardens and its many monuments were acquired by the National Trust in 1990, and are open to the public. The National Trust is overseeing a restoration programme of the grounds, temples and follies.

==Stowe in film==
Because of its picturesque surroundings Stowe has been the setting for many films, including &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot;, the Bollywood film &quot;Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham&quot;, &quot;Proof of Life&quot;, &quot;Stardust&quot; (2007), and &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; in the James Bond series.

==Notable people==
The teacher, author and murder victim Peter Farquhar taught at Stowe School and worshipped and preached at Stowe Parish Church.

<doc id="387545" wikidata="Q613897" url="?curid=387545" title="Anycast">
<text>Anycast is a network addressing and routing methodology in which a single IP address is shared by devices (generally servers) in multiple locations. Routers direct packets addressed to this destination to the location nearest the sender, using their normal decision-making algorithms, typically the lowest number of BGP network hops. Anycast routing is widely used by content delivery networks such as web and name servers, to bring their content closer to end users.

==History==
The first documented use of anycast routing for topological load-balancing of Internet-connected services was in 1989; the technique was first formally documented in the IETF four years later. It was first applied to critical infrastructure in 2001 with the anycasting of the I-root nameserver.

===Early objections===
Early objections to the deployment of anycast routing centered on the perceived conflict between long-lived TCP connections and the volatility of the Internet&#x27;s routed topology. In concept, a long-lived connection, such as an FTP file transfer (which can take hours to complete for large files) might be re-routed to a different anycast instance in mid-connection due to changes in network topology or routing, with the result that the server changes mid-connection, and the new server is not aware of the connection and does not possess the TCP connection state of the previous anycast instance.

In practice, such problems were not observed, and these objections dissipated by the early 2000s. Many initial anycast deployments consisted of DNS servers, using principally UDP transport. Measurements of long-term anycast flows revealed very few failures due to mid-connection instance switches, far fewer (less than 0.017% or &quot;less than one flow per ten thousand per hour of duration&quot; according to various sources) than were attributed to other causes of failure. Numerous mechanisms were developed to efficiently share state between anycast instances. And some TCP-based protocols, notably HTTP, incorporated &quot;redirect&quot; mechanisms, whereby anycast service addresses could be used to locate the nearest instance of a service, whereupon a user would be redirected to that specific instance prior to the initiation of any long-lived stateful transaction.

==Internet Protocol version 4==
Anycast can be implemented via Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). Multiple hosts (usually in different geographic areas) are given the same unicast IP address and different routes to the address are announced through BGP. Routers consider these to be alternative routes to the same destination, even though they are actually routes to different destinations with the same address. As usual, routers select a route by whatever distance metric is in use (the least cost, least congested, shortest). Selecting a route in this setup amounts to selecting a destination.

==Internet Protocol version 6==
Anycast is supported explicitly in the IPv6 addressing architecture. The lowest address within an IPv6 subnet (interface identifier 0) is reserved as the &quot;Subnet Router&quot; anycast address. In addition, the highest 128 interface identifiers within a subnet are also reserved as anycast addresses.

Most IPv6 routers on the path of an anycast packet through the network will not distinguish it from a unicast packet, but special handling is required from the routers near the destination (that is, within the scope of the anycast address) as they are required to route an anycast packet to the &quot;nearest&quot; interface within that scope which has the proper anycast address, according to whatever measure of distance (hops, cost, etc.) is being used.

The method used in IPv4 of advertising multiple routes in BGP to multiply-assigned unicast addresses also still works in IPv6, and can be used to route packets to the nearest of several geographically dispersed hosts with the same address. This approach, which does not depend on anycast-aware routers, has the same use cases together with the same problems and limitations as in IPv4.

==Applications==
With the growth of the Internet, network services increasingly have high-availability requirements. As a result, operation of anycast services has grown in popularity among network operators.

===Domain Name System===
All Internet root nameservers are implemented as clusters of hosts using anycast addressing. All 13 root servers A–M exist in multiple locations, with 11 on multiple continents. (Root servers B and H exist in two U.S. locations.) The servers use anycast address announcements to provide a decentralized service. This has accelerated the deployment of physical (rather than logical) root servers outside the United States. Many commercial DNS providers have switched to an IP anycast environment to increase query performance and redundancy, and to implement load balancing.

===IPv6 transition===
In IPv4 to IPv6 transitioning, anycast addressing may be deployed to provide IPv6 compatibility to IPv4 hosts. This method, 6to4, uses a default gateway with the IP address . This allows multiple providers to implement 6to4 gateways without hosts having to know each individual provider&#x27;s gateway addresses. 6to4 has been deprecated in response to native IPv6 becoming more prevalent.

===Content delivery networks===
Content delivery networks may use anycast for actual HTTP connections to their distribution centers, or for DNS. Because most HTTP connections to such networks request static content such as images and style sheets, they are generally short-lived and stateless across subsequent TCP sessions. The general stability of routes and statelessness of connections makes anycast suitable for this application, even though it uses TCP.

===Connectivity between Anycast and Multicast network===
Anycast rendezvous point can be used in Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP) and its advantageous application as Anycast RP is an intra-domain feature that provides redundancy and load-sharing capabilities. If the multiple anycast rendezvous point is used, IP routing automatically will select the topologically closest rendezvous point for each source and receiver. It would provide a multicast network with the fault tolerance requirements.

==Security==
Anycast allows any operator whose routing information is accepted by an intermediate router to hijack any packets intended for the anycast address. While this at first sight appears insecure, it is no different from the routing of ordinary IP packets, and no more or less secure. As with conventional IP routing, careful filtering of who is and is not allowed to propagate route announcements is crucial to prevent man-in-the-middle or blackhole attacks. The former can also be prevented by encrypting and authenticating messages, such as using Transport Layer Security, while the latter can be frustrated by onion routing.

==Reliability==
Anycast is normally highly reliable, as it can provide automatic failover without adding complexity or new potential points of failure. Anycast applications typically feature external &quot;heartbeat&quot; monitoring of the server&#x27;s function, and withdraw the route announcement if the server fails. In some cases this is done by the actual servers announcing the anycast prefix to the router over OSPF or another IGP. If the servers die, the router will automatically withdraw the announcement. &quot;Heartbeat&quot; functionality is important because, if the announcement continues for a failed server, the server will act as a &quot;black hole&quot; for nearby clients; this is the most serious mode of failure for an anycast system. Even in this event, this kind of failure will only cause a total failure for clients that are closer to this server than any other, and will not cause a global failure. However, even the automation necessary to implement &quot;heartbeat&quot; routing withdrawal can itself add a potential point of failure, as seen in the 2021 Facebook outage.

==Mitigation of denial-of-service attacks==
In denial-of-service attacks, a rogue network host may advertise itself as an anycast server for a vital network service, to provide false information or simply block service. 

Anycast methodologies on the Internet may be exploited to distribute DDoS attacks and reduce their effectiveness: As traffic is routed to the closest node, a process over which the attacker has no control, the DDoS traffic flow will be distributed amongst the closest nodes. Thus, not all nodes might be affected. This may be a reason to deploy anycast addressing.
The effectiveness of this technique depends upon maintaining the secrecy of any unicast addresses associated with anycast service nodes, however, since an attacker in possession of the unicast addresses of individual nodes can attack them from any location, bypassing anycast addressing methods.

==Local and global nodes==
Some anycast deployments on the Internet distinguish between local and global nodes to benefit the local community, by addressing local nodes preferentially. An example is the Domain Name System. Local nodes are often announced with the no-export BGP community to prevent hosts from announcing them to their peers, i.e. the announcement is kept in the local area. Where both local and global nodes are deployed, the announcements from global nodes are often AS prepended (i.e. the AS is added a few more times) to make the path longer so that a local node announcement is preferred over a global node announcement.

<text>Dadford is a hamlet in the parish of Stowe, north Buckinghamshire, England.

The hamlet is named Anglo Saxon in origin, meaning, &quot;Dodda&#x27;s Ford&quot; in modern English. Although, originally in the parish of Biddlesden, the hamlet was annexed to Stowe in the 17th century to provide extra living accommodation for the servants of the new manor house.

The hamlet still exists today, though it remains quite small in size. It has never had a public house but had a shop and post office until the 1980s. It has retained an iconic red telephone kiosk.

<text>Boycott is a hamlet in the parish of Stowe in north Buckinghamshire, England.

Boycott was originally an Anglo Saxon settlement. Its name came from Anglo-Saxon &quot;Boiacot&quot; = either &quot;Boia&#x27;s Cottage&quot; or &quot;the cottage of the boys or servants&quot;. The Marquis of Buckingham annexed Boycott hamlet to the parish of Stowe in the late 18th century to provide living accommodation for his staff and servants.

Until the Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844 Boycott was part of Oxfordshire.

<text>Dakar region () is the smallest and most populated region of Senegal, encompassing the capital city of the country, Dakar, and all its suburbs along the Cap Vert peninsula, Africa&#x27;s most westerly point.

==Administration==
The Dakar region is divided into five départements (administrative structures without political power, unlike the French départements). The départements had the following areas and populations at the Census of 2023:
Keur Massar department was formed in May 2021.

===Dakar department===
Dakar department is also a commune (city). This is a situation comparable to Paris which is both a department and a &quot;commune&quot;. The department/commune of Dakar is further divided into:
*4 arrondissements, which are administrative structures without much power. The arrondissements are further divided into:
**19 &quot;communes d&#x27;arrondissement&quot; (i.e. &quot;communes of arrondissement&quot;). The &quot;communes d&#x27;arrondissement&quot; have a lot of power, unlike the arrondissements of Paris, and are more comparable to the London boroughs.

=== Guédiawaye department===
Guédiawaye department is also a commune (city). This department has only one arrondissement, so that Guédiawaye is both a department and an arrondissement. The department /arrondissement/commune of Guédiawaye is further divided into:
*5 &quot;communes d&#x27;arrondissement&quot;

=== Pikine department===
Pikine department is also a commune (city). The department /commune of Pikine is further divided into:
*3 arrondissements, which are further divided into:
**16 &quot;communes d&#x27;arrondissement&quot;

=== Rufisque department===
Rufisque department is made up of two arrondissements and six urban communes:
*Rufisque arrondissement, which is also a commune (city). The arrondissement/commune of Rufisque is divided into 3 &quot;communes d&#x27;arrondissement&quot;:
** Rufisque Centre (Nord)
** Rufisque Est
** Rufisque Ouest
*Bambylor arrondissement, which, administratively speaking, is the only rural part of the Dakar region. The Bambylor arrondissement is divided into 3 &quot;communautés rurales&quot; (i.e. &quot;rural communities&quot;):
** Yène
** Bambylor
** Tivaouane Peulh-Niaga
* The six communes of Bargny, Sébikotane, Diamniadio, Jaxaay-Parcelle-Niakoul Rap, Sangalkam and Sendou

==Demographics==
==Table of administrative sub-divisions==
Within the Dakar region, the politically significant units (i.e. those who have elected officials and wield a significant power) are: the 7 communes, the 2 &quot;communautés rurales&quot;, and the 43 &quot;communes d&#x27;arrondissement&quot;.

<text>Edward Nelson (May 4, 1932 – September 10, 2014) was an American mathematician. He was professor in the Mathematics Department at Princeton University. He was known for his work on mathematical physics and mathematical logic. In mathematical logic, he was noted especially for his internal set theory, and views on ultrafinitism and the consistency of arithmetic. In philosophy of mathematics he advocated the view of formalism rather than platonism or intuitionism. He also wrote on the relationship between religion and mathematics.

==Biography==
Edward Nelson was born in Decatur, Georgia, in 1932. He spent his early childhood in Rome where his father worked for the Italian YMCA. At the advent of World War II, Nelson moved with his mother to New York City, where he attended high school at the Bronx High School of Science. His father, who spoke fluent Russian, stayed in St. Petersburg in connection with issues related to prisoners of war. After the war, his family returned to Italy and he attended the Liceo Scientifico Giovanni Verga in Rome.

He received his Ph.D. in 1955 from the University of Chicago, where he worked with Irving Segal. He was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study from 1956 to 1959. He held a position at Princeton University starting in 1959, attaining the rank of professor there in 1964 and retiring in 2013.

In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society. He died in Princeton, New Jersey, on September 10, 2014.

==Academic work==
===Stochastic quantum mechanics===

Nelson made contributions to the theory of infinite-dimensional group representations, the mathematical treatment of quantum field theory, the use of stochastic processes in quantum mechanics, and the reformulation of probability theory in terms of non-standard analysis. For many years he worked on mathematical physics and probability theory, and he retained a residual interest in these fields, particularly in connection with possible extensions of stochastic mechanics to field theory.

===Four color problem===

In 1950, Nelson formulated a popular variant of the four color problem: What is the chromatic number, denoted formula_1, of the plane? In more detail, what is the smallest number of colors sufficient for coloring the points of the Euclidean plane such that no two points of the same color are unit distance apart? We know by simple arguments that 4 ≤ &quot;χ&quot; ≤ 7. The problem was introduced to a wide mathematical audience by Martin Gardner in his October 1960 Mathematical Games column. The chromatic number problem, also now known as the Hadwiger–Nelson problem, was a favorite of Paul Erdős, who mentioned it frequently in his problems lectures. In 2018, Aubrey de Grey showed that &quot;χ&quot; ≥ 5.

===Foundations of mathematics===

In the later part of his career, he worked on mathematical logic and the foundations of mathematics. One of his goals was to extend IST (Internal Set Theory—a version of a portion of Abraham Robinson&#x27;s non-standard analysis) in a natural manner that includes external functions and sets, in a way that provides an external function with specified properties unless there is a finitary obstacle to its existence. Other work centered on fragments of arithmetic, studying the divide between those theories interpretable in Raphael Robinson&#x27;s arithmetic and those that are not; computational complexity, including the problem of whether P is equal to NP; and automated proof checking.

In September 2011, Nelson announced he had proved that Peano arithmetic was logically inconsistent. An error was found in the proof by Terence Tao, and Nelson retracted the claim.

<doc id="387562" wikidata="Q868217" url="?curid=387562" title="Sports video game">
<text>A sports video game is a video game that simulates the practice of sports. Most sports have been recreated with video games, including team sports, track and field, extreme sports, and combat sports. Some games emphasize playing the sport (such as &quot;EA Sports FC&quot;, &quot;eFootball&quot; and &quot;NBA 2K&quot;), whilst others emphasize strategy and sport management (such as &quot;Football Manager&quot; and &quot;Out of the Park Baseball&quot;). Some, such as &quot;Need for Speed&quot;, &quot;Arch Rivals&quot; and &quot;Punch-Out!!&quot;, satirize the sport for comic effect. This genre has been popular throughout the history of video games and is competitive, just like real-world sports. A number of game series feature the names and characteristics of real teams and players, and are updated annually to reflect real-world changes. The sports genre is one of the oldest genres in gaming history.

==Game design==
Sports games involve physical and tactical challenges, and test the player&#x27;s precision and accuracy. Most sports games attempt to model the athletic characteristics required by that sport, including speed, strength, acceleration, accuracy, and so on. As with their respective sports, these games take place in a stadium or arena with clear boundaries. Sports games often provide play-by-play and color commentary through the use of recorded audio.

Sports games sometimes make use of different modes for different parts of the game. This is especially true in games about American football such as the Madden NFL series, where executing a pass play requires six different gameplay modes in the span of approximately 45 seconds. Sometimes, other sports games offer a menu where players may select a strategy while play is temporarily suspended. Association football video games sometimes shift gameplay modes when it is time for the player to attempt a penalty kick, a free shot at goal from the penalty spot, taken by a single player. Some sports games also require players to shift roles between the athletes and the coach or manager. These mode switches are more intuitive than other game genres because they reflect actual sports.

Older 2D sports games sometimes used an unrealistic graphical scale, where athletes appeared to be quite large in order to be visible to the player. As sports games have evolved, players have come to expect a realistic graphical scale with a high degree of verisimilitude. Sports games often simplify the game physics for ease of play, and ignore factors such as a player&#x27;s inertia. Games typically take place with a highly accurate time-scale, although they usually allow players to play quick sessions with shorter game quarters or periods.

Sports games sometimes treat button-pushes as continuous signals rather than discrete moves, in order to initiate and end a continuous action. For example, football games may distinguish between short and the long passes based on how long the player holds a button. Golf games often initiate the backswing with one button-push, and the swing itself is initiated by a subsequent push.

==Types==
===Arcade===
Arcade sports games have traditionally been very popular arcade games. The competitive nature of sports lends itself well to the arcades where the main objective is usually to obtain a high score. The arcade style of play is generally more unrealistic and focuses on a quicker gameplay experience. However the competitive nature of sports and being able to gain a high score while competing against friends for free online, has made online sports games very popular. Examples of this include the &quot;NFL Blitz&quot; and &quot;NBA Jam&quot; series.

===Simulation===

Simulation games are more realistic than arcade games, with the emphasis being more on realism than on how fun the game is to pick up and play based from the competitive seasons of each sport. The simulation-style tends to be slower and more accurate with normal rules while arcade games tend to be fast and can have all kinds of ad-hoc rules and ideas thrown in, especially pre-2000s. Examples of this include the &quot;EA Sports FC&quot;, &quot;NHL&quot;, &quot;EA Sports WRC&quot;, &quot;F1&quot;, &quot;MotoGP&quot;, &quot;PGA Tour&quot;, &quot;PGA Tour 2K&quot;, &quot;MLB The Show&quot;, &quot;Madden NFL&quot;, &quot;EA Sports College Football&quot; and &quot;NBA 2K&quot; series.

===Management===
A sports management game puts the player in the role of team manager. Whereas some games are played online against other players, management games usually pit the player against AI controlled teams in the same league. Players are expected to handle strategy, tactics, transfers, and financial issues. Various examples of these games can be found in the sports management category.

===Multi-sport===
Since &quot;Track &amp; Field&quot; (1983), various multi-sport video games have combined multiple sports into a single game. &quot;Wii Sports&quot; and &quot;Nintendo Switch Sports&quot; are recent examples. A popular sub-genre are Olympic video games, including &quot;Track &amp; Field&quot; and other similar titles. Multi-sport tournaments are becoming the basis for computer games.

==History==


===Origins (1958–1972)===
Sports video games have origins in sports electro-mechanical games (EM games), which were arcade games manufactured using a mixture of electrical and mechanical components, for amusement arcades between the 1940s and 1970s. Examples include boxing games such as International Mutoscope Reel Company&#x27;s &quot;K.O. Champ&quot; (1955), bowling games such as Bally Manufacturing&#x27;s &quot;Bally Bowler&quot; and Chicago Coin&#x27;s &quot;Corvette&quot; from 1966, baseball games such as Midway Manufacturing&#x27;s &quot;Little League&quot; (1966) and Chicago Coin&#x27;s &quot;All Stars Baseball&quot; (1968), other team sport games such as Taito&#x27;s &quot;Crown Soccer Special&quot; (1967) and &quot;Crown Basketball&quot; (1968), and air hockey type games such as Sega&#x27;s &quot;MotoPolo&quot; (1968) and &quot;Air Hockey&quot; (1972) by Brunswick Billiards.

The earliest sports video game dates backs to 1958, when William Higinbotham created a game called &quot;Tennis for Two&quot;, a competitive two-player tennis game played on an oscilloscope. The players would select the angle at which to put their racket, and pressed a button to return it. Although this game was incredibly simple, it demonstrated how an action game (rather than previous puzzles) could be played on a computer. Video games prior to the late 1970s were primarily played on university mainframe computers under timesharing systems that supported multiple computer terminals on school campuses. The two dominant systems in this era were Digital Equipment Corporation&#x27;s PDP-10 and Control Data Corporation&#x27;s PLATO. Both could only display text, and not graphics, originally printed on teleprinters and line printers, but later printed on single-color CRT screens.

Ralph Baer developed &quot;Table Tennis&quot; for the first video game console, the Magnavox Odyssey, released in 1972. While the console had other sports-themed game cards, they required the use of television overlays while playing similarly to board games or card games. &quot;Table Tennis&quot; was the only Odyssey game that was entirely electronic and did not require an overlay, introducing a ball-and-paddle game design that showcased the potential of the new video game medium. This provided the basis for the first commercially successful video game, &quot;Pong&quot; (1972), released as an arcade video game by Atari, Inc.

===Ball-and-paddle era (1973–1975)===
Numerous ball-and-paddle games that were either clones or variants of &quot;Pong&quot; were released for arcades in 1973. Atari themselves released a four-player cooperative multiplayer variant, &quot;Pong Doubles&quot; (1973), based on tennis doubles. In the United States, the best-selling arcade video game of 1973 was &quot;Pong&quot;, followed by several of its clones and variants, including &quot;Pro Tennis&quot; from Williams Electronics, &quot;Winner&quot; from Midway Manufacturing, &quot;Super Soccer&quot; and &quot;Tennis Tourney&quot; from Allied Leisure (later called Centuri), and &quot;TV Tennis&quot; from Chicago Coin.

In Japan, arcade manufacturers such as Taito initially avoided video games as they found &quot;Pong&quot; to be simplistic compared to more complex EM games, but after Sega successfully tested-marketed &quot;Pong&quot; in Japan, Sega and Taito released the clones &quot;Pong Tron&quot; and &quot;Elepong&quot;, respectively, in July 1973, before the official Japanese release of &quot;Pong&quot; by Atari Japan (later part of Namco) in November 1973. Tomohiro Nishikado&#x27;s four-player &quot;Pong&quot; variant &quot;Soccer&quot; was released by Taito in November 1973, with a green background to simulate an association football playfield along with a goal on each side. Another Taito variant, &quot;Pro Hockey&quot; (1973), set boundaries around the screen and only a small gap for the goal.

Tomohiro Nishikado wanted to move beyond simple rectangles to character graphics, resulting in his development of a basketball game, Taito&#x27;s &quot;TV Basketball&quot;, released in April 1974. It was the earliest use of character sprites to represent human characters in a video game. While the gameplay was similar to earlier ball-and-paddle games, it displayed images both for the players and the baskets, and attempted to simulate basketball. Each player controls two team members, a forward and a guard; the ball can be passed between team members before shooting, and the ball has to fall into the opposing team&#x27;s basket to score a point. The game was released in North America by Midway as &quot;TV Basketball&quot;, selling 1,400 arcade cabinets in the United States, a production record for Midway up until they released &quot;Wheels&quot; the following year. Ramtek later released &quot;Baseball&quot; in October 1974, similarly featuring the use of character graphics.

In 1975, Nintendo released &quot;EVR-Race&quot;, a horse racing simulation game with support for up to six players. It was a mixture between a video game and an electro-mechanical game, and played back video footage from a video tape.

===Decline (1976–1982)===
After the market became flooded with &quot;Pong&quot; clones, the &quot;Pong&quot; market crashed around the mid-1970s. Sports video games would not regain the same level of success until the 1980s.

In 1976, Sega released an early combat sport game, &quot;Heavyweight Champ&quot;, based on boxing and now considered the first fighting game.

In March 1978, Sega released &quot;World Cup&quot;, an association football game with a trackball controller. In October 1978, Atari released &quot;Atari Football&quot;, which is considered to be the first video game to accurately emulate American football; it also popularized the use of a trackball, with the game&#x27;s developers mentioning it was inspired by an earlier Japanese association football game that used a trackball. &quot;Atari Football&quot; was the second highest-earning arcade video game of 1979 in the United States, below only Taito&#x27;s shoot &#x27;em up blockbuster &quot;Space Invaders&quot; (1978), though &quot;Atari Football&quot; was the only sports game among the top ten highest-earners.

In 1980, Mattel&#x27;s &quot;Basketball&quot; for the Intellivision was the first basketball video game to be licensed by the National Basketball Association (NBA). On home computers, Microsoft&#x27;s &quot;Olympic Decathlon&quot; (1980) was one of the first sports-related programs to mix game and simulation elements, and was an early example of an Olympic track-and-field game. The first sports simulation game was most likely either Computer Baseball or Computer Quarterback, both released in 1981. The first association football management simulation, &quot;Football Manager&quot;, was released for the ZX Spectrum computer in 1982.

Between 1981 and 1983, the Atari&#x27;s VCS (2600) and Mattel&#x27;s Intellivision waged a series of high-stakes TV advertising campaigns promoting their respective systems, marking the start of the first console wars. Atari prevailed in arcade games and had a larger customer base due to its lower price, while Intellivision touted its visually superior sports games. Sports writer George Plimpton was featured in the Intellivision ads, which showed the parallel games side by side. Both Atari and Intellivision fielded at least one game for baseball, American football, hockey, basketball and association football. Atari&#x27;s sports games included &quot;Activision Tennis&quot; (1981).

===Resurgence (1983–1985)===
Sports video games experienced a resurgence from 1983. As the golden age of arcade video games came to an end, arcade manufacturers began looking for ways to reinvigorate the arcade video game industry, so they began turning to sports games. The arcade industry began producing sports games at levels not seen since the days of &quot;Pong&quot; and its clones, which played a role in the recovery of the arcade market by the mid-1980s. There were initially high expectations for laserdisc games to help revive the arcade industry in 1983, but it was instead non-laserdisc sports games that ended up being the most well-received hits at amusement arcade shows by late 1983.

====Arcades====
In March 1983, Sega released Alpha Denshi&#x27;s arcade game &quot;Champion Baseball&quot;, which became a blockbuster success in Japanese arcades, with Sega comparing its impact on Japanese arcades to that of &quot;Space Invaders&quot;. &quot;Champion Baseball&quot; was a departure from the &quot;space games&quot; and &quot;cartoon&quot; action games that had previously dominated the arcades, and subsequently served as the prototype for later baseball video games. It had a split-screen format, displaying the playfield from two camera angles, one from the outfield and another close-up shot of the player and batter, while also giving players the option of selecting relief pitchers or pinch hitters, while an umpire looks on attentively to make the game calls. The game also had digitized voices for the umpire, and individual player statistics.

Sports games became more popular across arcades worldwide with the arrival of Konami&#x27;s &quot;Track &amp; Field&quot;, known as &quot;Hyper Olympic&quot; in Japan, introduced in September 1983. It was an Olympic-themed athletics game that had multiple Olympic track-and-field events (including the 100-meter dash, long jump, javelin throw, 110-meter hurdles, hammer throw, and high jump) and allowed up to four players to compete. It had a horizontal side-scrolling format, depicting one or two tracks at a time, a large scoreboard that displayed world records and current runs, and a packed audience in the background. Despite the industry&#x27;s hype for laserdisc games at the time, &quot;Track &amp; Field&quot; became the most well-received game at the Amusement Machine Show (AM Show) in Tokyo and the Amusement &amp; Music Operators Association (AMOA) show in the United States. The game sold 38,000 arcade units in Japan, became one of the top five highest-grossing arcade games of 1984 in the United States, and the top-grossing arcade game of 1984 in the United Kingdom. It was also the basis for an organized video game competition that drew more than a million players in 1984. The success of &quot;Track &amp; Field&quot; spawned other similar Olympic video games.

Numerous sports video games were subsequently released in arcades after &quot;Track &amp; Field&quot;, including American football games such as &quot;10-Yard Fight&quot; (1983) by Irem and &quot;Goal to Go&quot; (1984) by Stern Electronics, boxing video games such as Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Punch-Out!&quot; (1984), martial arts sports fighting games such as Technōs Japan&#x27;s &quot;Karate Champ&quot; (1984), the Nintendo VS. System titles &quot;VS. Tennis&quot; and &quot;VS. Baseball&quot;, Taito&#x27;s golf game &quot;Birdie King II&quot;, and Data East&#x27;s &quot;Tag Team Wrestling&quot;. &quot;10-Yard Fight&quot; in 1983 had a career mode, where the player progresses from high school, to college, professional, playoff, and Super Bowl, as the difficulty increases with each step. Irem&#x27;s waterskiing game &quot;Tropical Angel&quot; had a female player character, and was one of the two most well-received games at the September 1983 AM Show (along with &quot;Hyper Olympic&quot;) for its graphics and gameplay. Another sports game with female player characters was Taito&#x27;s &quot;Joshi Volleyball&quot; (&quot;Big Spikers&quot;), which topped the Japanese table arcade cabinet chart in December 1983. Kaneko&#x27;s &quot;Roller Aces&quot; was a roller skating game played from a third-person perspective, while Technōs Japan released the wrestling game &quot;Tag Team Wrestling&quot;.

In the field of association football games, Alpha Denshi&#x27;s &quot;Exciting Soccer&quot; (1983) featured digitized voices and a top-down overhead perspective, which was later popularized by &quot;Tehkan World Cup&quot; (1985) from Tehkan (later Tecmo). &quot;Tehkan World Cup&quot; was a multiplayer association football game with a trackball controller, where a button was used for kicking the ball and the trackball used for the direction and speed of the shot, with gameplay that was fairly realistic. It was a landmark title for association football games, considered revolutionary for its trackball control system, its top-down perspective that allows players to see more of the pitch, and its trackball-based game physics. It provided the basis for later association football games such as &quot;MicroProse Soccer&quot; (1988) and the &quot;Sensible Soccer&quot; series (1992 debut).

Several sports laserdisc games were released for arcades in 1984, including Universal&#x27;s &quot;Top Gear&quot; which displayed 3D animated race car driving, while Sega&#x27;s &quot;GP World&quot; and Taito&#x27;s &quot;Laser Grand Prix&quot; displayed live-action footage. Sega also produced a bullfighting game, &quot;Bull Fight&quot;, and a multiple-watersports game &quot;Water Match&quot; (published by Bally Midway), which included swimming, kayaking and boat racing; while Taito released a female sports game based on high-school track &amp; field, &quot;The Undoukai&quot;, and a dirt track racing game &quot;Buggy Challenge&quot;, with a buggy. Other dirt racing games from that year were dirt bike games: Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Excitebike&quot; and SNK&#x27;s motocross game &quot;Jumping Cross&quot;. Nintendo also released a four-player racquet sport game, &quot;VS. Tennis&quot; (the Nintendo VS. System version of &quot;Tennis&quot;).

That same year, ice hockey games were also released: Alpha Denshi&#x27;s &quot;Bull Fighter&quot; and Data East&#x27;s &quot;Fighting Ice Hockey&quot;. Data East also released a lawn sports game &quot;Haro Gate Ball&quot;, based on croquet, while Nichibutsu released a game based on roller derby, &quot;Roller Jammer&quot;. Meanwhile, Technos Japan released a game based on sumo wrestling, &quot;Syusse Oozumou&quot;, and the first martial arts combat-sport game, &quot;Karate Champ&quot;, considered one of the most influential fighting games. In 1985, Nintendo released an arm wrestling game, &quot;Arm Wrestling&quot;, while Konami released a table tennis game that attempted to accurately reflect the sport, &quot;Konami&#x27;s Ping Pong&quot;.

====Homes====
On home consoles, Mattel released &quot;Intellivision World Series Baseball&quot; (&quot;IWSB&quot;), designed by Don Daglow and Eddie Dombrower, in late 1983. It is considered the earliest sports video game to use multiple camera angles to show the action in a manner resembling a sports television broadcast. Earlier sports games prior to this had displayed the entire field on screen, or scrolled across static top-down fields to show the action. &quot;IWSB&quot; mimicked television baseball coverage by showing the batter from a modified &quot;center field&quot; camera, the baserunners in corner insets and defensive plays from a camera behind the batter. It was also one of the first sports video games to feature audibly speaking digitized voices (as opposed to text), using the Mattel Intellivoice module. The game was sophisticated for its time, but was a commercial failure, released around the time of the video game crash of 1983 when the North American home video game market collapsed.

Nintendo released a series of highly successful sports games for the Nintendo Entertainment System console and the arcade Nintendo VS. System, starting with &quot;Baseball&quot; (1983) and &quot;Tennis&quot; (1984). They played an important role in the history of the Nintendo Entertainment System, as they were the earliest NES games released in North America, initially in the arcades and then with the console&#x27;s launch. Nintendo&#x27;s arcade version &quot;VS. Baseball&quot; (1984) was competing with Sega&#x27;s earlier hit &quot;Champion Baseball&quot; in the arcades.

On home computers, &quot;Track &amp; Field&quot; spawned similar hit Olympic games for computer platforms, such as Ocean Software&#x27;s &quot;Daley Thompson&#x27;s Decathlon&quot; (1984). Electronic Arts produced their first sports game for home computers, the basketball title &quot;Dr. J and Larry Bird Go One on One&quot; (1983), which was the first licensed sports game based on the names and likenesses of famous athletes; the inclusion of famous real world athletes would become one of the most important selling points for sports games. &quot;One on One&quot; became Electronic Arts&#x27; best-selling game, and the highest-selling computer sports game, having sold 400,000 copies by late 1988.

===Further growth (1986–1994)===
In the late 1980s, basketball video games gained popularity in arcades. Konami&#x27;s &quot;Double Dribble&quot; (1986) featured colorful graphics, five-on-five gameplay, cutaway animations for slam dunks, and a digitized version of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; theme. It was considered the most realistic basketball game upon release, with fast-paced action, detailed players, a large side-scrolling court, innovative cinematic dunks, and detailed sound effects, beginning a trend where presentation would play an increasingly important role in sports games. &quot;Magic Johnson&#x27;s Fast Break&quot; (1988) by Arcadia Systems had detailed characters and audio clips of Magic Johnson&#x27;s voice. Midway, who had not released a basketball game in sixteen years since Taito&#x27;s &quot;TV Basketball&quot; in 1974, released &quot;Arch Rivals&quot; (1989), a two-on-two game featuring large players with distinct looks, a basketball court, a crowd, cheerleaders, four periods, the ability to rough up an opponent, and big dunks capable of backboard shattering. Konami&#x27;s &quot;Punk Shot&quot; (1990) is an arcade basketball game with an element of violence, allowing players to physically attack each other, which &quot;CU Amiga&quot; magazine compared to the film &quot;Rollerball&quot; (1975).

The success of the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in North America led to the platform becoming a major platform for American sports video games. Basketball games included a port of &quot;Double Dribble&quot;, with a halo mechanic signifying the optimum release for shots, and &quot;Tecmo NBA Basketball&quot; (1992). American football video games included &quot;Tecmo Bowl&quot; (1987), which was ported to the NES with the NFL Players Association license, and &quot;Tecmo Super Bowl&quot; (1991), which introduced a season mode with nearly the entire NFL roster. &quot;Tecmo Super Bowl&quot; is considered to be one of the greatest and most influential games of all time, as it was the first mainstream sports video game with both the league and player association licenses, with ESPN ranking it the greatest sports video game of all time. Sega also developed American football games for their competing Master System console, &quot;Great Football&quot; in 1987 and &quot;American Pro Football&quot; (&quot;Walter Payton Football&quot;) in 1989, the latter very well received by critics at the time.

The late 1980s is considered the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of baseball video games. Namco&#x27;s &quot;R.B.I. Baseball&quot; (1986) and the Atlus title &quot;Major League Baseball&quot; (1988) for the NES were the first fully licensed baseball video games. SNK&#x27;s &quot;Baseball Stars&quot; (1989) was a popular arcade-style NES game, while Jaleco&#x27;s NES title &quot;Bases Loaded&quot; (1987) was a simulation game with statistics. In 1988, EA released &quot;Earl Weaver Baseball&quot;, developed by Don Daglow and Eddie Dombrower, which for the first time combined a highly accurate simulation game with high quality graphics. This was also the first game in which an actual baseball manager provided the computer AI. In 1996 &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; named &quot;EWB&quot; the 25th of its Best 150 Games of All Time, the second highest ranking for any sports game in that 1981–1996 period (after &quot;FPS Football&quot;).

The 1990s began in the 16-bit era, as a wave of fourth generation video game consoles were created to handle more complex games and graphics. The Sega Genesis/Mega Drive in particular became renowned for its sports video games, as it was more powerful than the NES and with Sega targeting an older audience than Nintendo&#x27;s typically younger target demographic at the time. Basketball video games included EA&#x27;s &quot;Lakers versus Celtics and the NBA Playoffs&quot; (1991), which launched the &quot;NBA Live&quot; series. &quot;World Series Baseball&quot; (1994) introduced the &quot;catcher-cam&quot; perspective, launching the &quot;World Series Baseball&quot; series and becoming the first game in the Sega Sports line.

In 1989, Electronic Arts producer Richard Hilleman hired GameStar&#x27;s Scott Orr to re-design &quot;John Madden Football&quot; for the fast-growing Sega Genesis. In 1990, Orr and Hilleman released &quot;Madden Football&quot;. They focused on producing a head-to-head two-player game with an intuitive interface and responsive controls. Electronic Arts had only expected to sell around 75,000 units, but instead the title sold around 400,000 units.

In 1990, Taito released &quot;Football Champ&quot;, an association football game that allows up to four players in both competitive and cooperative gameplay. It also let players perform a number of actions, including a back heel, power kick, high kick, sliding tackle, super shot, and fouling other players (kicking, punching, and pulling shirts), which the player can get away with if the referee isn&#x27;t looking, or get a yellow or red penalty card for if he is. In 1991, the American football game &quot;Tecmo Super Bowl&quot; was the first mainstream sports game to feature both the league and player association licenses of the sport it emulated; previous titles either had one license or the other, but &quot;Tecmo Super Bowl&quot; was the first to feature real NFL players on real teams.

Orr joined EA full-time in 1991 after the success of &quot;Madden&quot; on the Sega Genesis, and began a ten-year period of his career where he personally supervised the production of the &quot;Madden Football&quot; series. During this time EA formed EA Sports, a brand name used for sports games they produced. EA Sports created several ongoing series, with a new version released each year to reflect the changes in the sport and its teams since the previous release.

Sega launched its own competing &quot;NFL&quot; series on the Sega Genesis. The gameplay of Sega&#x27;s earlier 1987 Master System title &quot;Great Football&quot; (1987) was the basis for &quot;Joe Montana Football&quot; (1991), developed by EA and published by Sega for the Genesis. Sega then released their own sequel without EA&#x27;s involvement, &quot;Joe Montana II: Sports Talk Football&quot; (1991), which became the first American football game with audio commentary. After Sega acquired the NFL license, they shortened the title to &quot;NFL Sports Talk Football Starring Joe Montana&quot;, which later became known as Sega&#x27;s &quot;NFL&quot; series. Due to strong competition from &quot;Madden&quot;, the series was cancelled in 1997.

Licensed basketball games began becoming more common by the early 1990s, including Sega&#x27;s &quot;Pat Riley Basketball&quot; (1990) and Acme Interactive&#x27;s &quot;David Robinson&#x27;s Supreme Court&quot; (1992) for the Sega Genesis, and Hudson Soft&#x27;s &quot;Bill Laimbeer&#x27;s Combat Basketball&quot; (1991) for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). EA followed &quot;Jordan vs. Bird: One on One&quot; (1988) with &quot;Lakers versus Celtics and the NBA Playoffs&quot; (1989), the latter ported to the Genesis in 1991, which added more simulation aspects to the subgenre. In the arcades, Midway followed &quot;Arch Rivals&quot; with &quot;NBA Jam&quot; (1993), which introduced digitized sprites similar to their fighting game &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (1992), combined with a gameplay formula similar to &quot;Arch Rivals&quot;. In its first twelve months of release, &quot;NBA Jam&quot; generated over to become the highest-grossing arcade sports game of all time.

&quot;FIFA International Soccer&quot; (1993), the first game in EA&#x27;s &quot;FIFA&quot; series of association football video games, released on the Sega Mega Drive and became the best-selling home video game of 1993 in the United Kingdom. In contrast to the top-down perspective of earlier association football games, &quot;FIFA&quot; introduced an isometric perspective to the genre. &quot;International Superstar Soccer&quot; (1994), the first game in Konami&#x27;s &quot;International Superstar Soccer&quot; (&quot;ISS&quot;) series, released for the SNES. A rivalry subsequently emerged between the &quot;FIFA&quot; and &quot;ISS&quot; franchises.

===Transition to 3D polygons (1994–1997)===
In the 1990s, 3D graphics were introduced in sports games. Early uses of flat-shaded polygons date back to 1991, with home computer games such as &quot;4D Sports Boxing&quot; and &quot;Winter Challenge&quot;. However, it was not until the mid-1990s that 3D polygons were popularized in sports games.

Sega&#x27;s arcade title &quot;Virtua Striker&quot; (1994) was the first association football game to use 3D graphics, and was also notable for its early use of texture mapping. Meanwhile, Sierra Online released American football title &quot;Front Page Sports Football&quot; in 1995 for the PC. The following year, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; named it twelfth of the Best 150 Games of All Time, the highest ranking sports game on the list.

&quot;International Superstar Soccer Pro&quot; (&quot;ISS Pro&quot;), released for the PlayStation in 1997, was considered a &quot;game-changer&quot; for association football games, which had been largely dominated by rival &quot;FIFA&quot; on home systems for the last several years. Developed by Konami Tokyo, &quot;ISS Pro&quot; introduced a new 3D engine capable of better graphics and more sophisticated gameplay than its rival. Whereas &quot;FIFA&quot; had a simpler &quot;arcade-style&quot; approach to its gameplay, &quot;ISS Pro&quot; introduced more complex simulation gameplay emphasizing tactics and improvisation, enabled by tactical variety such as nine in-match strategy options.

In 1997, &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; reported that sports games accounted for roughly 50% of console software sales.

===Extreme sports enter into the mainstream (1996–2001)===
At the end of the 20th and beginning of the 21st century, extreme sport video games began to appear more frequently.

Namco&#x27;s &quot;Alpine Racer&quot; (1994) was a skiing winter sports simulator that became a major success in arcades during the mid-1990s. This led to a wave of similar sports games capitalizing on its success during the late 1990s, from companies such as Sega, Namco, Konami and Innovative Concepts.

In 1996, two snowboarding video games were released: Namco&#x27;s &quot;Alpine Surfer&quot; in the arcades, and the UEP Systems game &quot;Cool Boarders&quot; for the PlayStation console. The following year, Square&#x27;s popular role-playing video game, &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, included a snowboarding minigame that was later released as an independent snowboarding game, &quot;Final Fantasy VII Snowboarding&quot;, for mobile phones. In 2000, &quot;SSX&quot; was released. Based around boardercross, the game featured fast downhill races, avoiding various objects whilst using others to perform jumps and increase the player&#x27;s speed.

In 1997, Sega released one of the first mainstream skateboarding games, &quot;Top Skater&quot;, in the arcades, where it introduced a skateboard controller interface. &quot;Top Skater&quot; served as a basic foundation for later skateboarding games. The following year saw the release of the console skateboarding game &quot;Street Sk8er&quot;, developed by Atelier Double and published by Electronic Arts. In 1999, the subgenre was further popularized by &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater&quot;, an arcade-like skateboarding game where players were challenged to execute elaborate tricks or collect a series of elements hidden throughout the level. &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s&quot; went on to be one of the most popular sports game franchises.

===Sports games become big business (2002–2005)===
Association football games became more popular in the 2000s. Konami&#x27;s &quot;ISS&quot; series spawned the &quot;Pro Evolution Soccer&quot; (&quot;PES&quot;) series in the early 2000s. A rivalry subsequently emerged between &quot;FIFA&quot; and &quot;PES&quot;, considered the &quot;greatest rivalry&quot; in the history of sports video games. &quot;PES&quot; became known for having &quot;faster-paced tactical play&quot; and more varied emergent gameplay, while &quot;FIFA&quot; was known for having more licenses. The &quot;FIFA&quot; series had sold over units by 2000, while the &quot;PES&quot; series had sold more than units by 2002. The sales gap between the two franchises had narrowed by the mid-2000s.

On December 13, 2004, Electronic Arts began a string of deals that granted exclusive rights to several prominent sports organizations, starting with the NFL. This was quickly followed with two deals in January 2008 securing rights to the AFL and ESPN licenses. This was a particularly hard blow to Sega, the previous holder of the ESPN license, who had already been affected by EA&#x27;s NFL deal. As the market for football brands was being quickly taken by EA, Take-Two Interactive responded by contacting the Major League Baseball Players Association and signing a deal that granted exclusive third-party major-league baseball rights; a deal not as restrictive, as first-party projects were still allowed. The NBA was then approached by several developers, but declined to enter into an exclusivity agreement, instead granting long-term licenses to Electronic Arts, Take-Two Interactive, Midway Games, Sony, and Atari. In April 2005, EA furthered its hold on American football licensing by securing rights to all NCAA brands.

===Motion detection===

====Sega Activator: IR motion detection (1993–1994)====
In 1993, Sega released the Sega Activator, a motion detection game controller designed to respond to a player&#x27;s body movements, for their Genesis console. The Activator was based on the Light Harp, a MIDI controller invented by Assaf Gurner. He was an Israeli musician and Kung Fu martial artist who researched inter disciplinarian concepts to create the experience of playing an instrument using the whole body&#x27;s motion. It was released for the Mega Drive (Genesis) in 1993. It could read the player&#x27;s physical movements and was the first controller to allow full-body motion sensing, The original invention related to a 3 octaves musical instrument that could interpret the user&#x27;s gestures into musical notes via MIDI protocol. The invention was registered as patent initially in Israel on May 11, 1988, after 4 years of R&amp;D. In 1992, the first complete Light Harp was created by Assaf Gurner and Oded Zur, and was presented to Sega of America.

Like the Light Harp, the Activator is an octagonal frame that lies on the floor. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) on the frame vertically project thin, invisible beams of infrared light. When something, such as a player&#x27;s arm or leg, interrupts a beam, the device reads the distance at which the interruption occurred, and interprets the signal as a command. The device can also interpret signals from multiple beams simultaneously (i.e., chords) as a distinct command.

Sega designed special Activator motions for a few of their own game releases. By tailoring motion signals specifically for a game, Sega attempted to provide a more intuitive gaming experience. A player could, for example, compete in &quot;Greatest Heavyweights of the Ring&quot; or &quot;Eternal Champions&quot; by miming punches.

Despite these efforts, the Activator was a commercial failure. Like the Power Glove of 1989, it was widely rejected for its &quot;unwieldiness and inaccuracy&quot;.

====Wii Remote: IR motion detection with accelerometry (2006–2009)====
In 2006, Nintendo released &quot;Wii Sports&quot;, a sports game for the Wii console in which the player had to physically move their Wii Remote to move their avatar known as a Mii. The game contained five different sports—boxing, bowling, golf, tennis, and baseball—which could all be played individually or with multiple players. Players could also track their skill progress through the game, as they became more proficient at the different sports, and use the training mode to practice particular situations. As of 2013, &quot;Wii Sports&quot; became the second-highest selling video game of all time.

The popularity of the Wii and its bundled &quot;Wii Sports&quot; opened the way for other physically reactive sports-based video games, including from third-parties, such as &quot;Super Swing Golf&quot; and &quot;We Love Golf!&quot; based on the sport of golf, &quot;Rockstar Games Presents Table Tennis&quot; based on table tennis, &quot;MLB Power Pros&quot; based on baseball, and &quot;Grand Slam Tennis&quot; and &quot;Virtua Tennis 2009&quot; both of which made use of the advanced Wii MotionPlus remote. Nintendo themselves also pushed with further motion-based games such as &quot;Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games&quot;, in which players used the Wii Remote to simulate running, jumping and other Olympic sports. In 2008, Nintendo released &quot;Wii Fit&quot;, which allowed players to do aerobic and fitness exercises using the Wii Balance Board; third-party developers also designed games using the Board, such as the skiing game &quot;We Ski&quot;. In a similar light, 2008 saw the release of &quot;Mario Kart Wii&quot;, a racing game which allowed the player to use their remote with a Wii Wheel to act as a steering wheel, akin to those on traditional arcade racing games.

===Sports games today (2010–present)===

The most popular subgenre in Europe is association football games, which up until 2010 was dominated by EA Sports with the &quot;FIFA&quot; series and Konami with the &quot;Pro Evolution Soccer&quot; (&quot;PES&quot;) series. While &quot;FIFA&quot; was commercially ahead, the sales gap between the two franchises had narrowed. &quot;FIFA&quot; responded by borrowing gameplay elements from &quot;PES&quot; to improve &quot;FIFA&quot;, which eventually pulled ahead commercially by a significant margin in the 2010s and emerged as the world&#x27;s most successful sports video game franchise.

In North America, the sports genre is currently dominated by EA Sports and 2K Sports, who hold licenses to produce games based on official leagues. EA&#x27;s franchises include the &quot;Madden NFL&quot; series, the &quot;NHL&quot; series, the &quot;PGA Tour&quot; series, the &quot;UFC&quot; series, the &quot;F1&quot; series, the &quot;EA Sports FC&quot; series, and the &quot;NBA Live&quot; series. 2K Sports&#x27; franchises include the NBA 2K, PGA Tour 2K and WWE 2K series. 2K recently released TopSpin 2K25. All of these games feature real leagues, competitions and players. These games continue to sell well today despite many of the product lines being over a decade old, and receive, for the most part, consistently good reviews.

With 2K &amp; EA Sports&#x27; domination and many sports leagues carrying exclusive licences, the North American sports video game market has become very difficult to enter; competing games in any of the above genres, with the exception of racing games, tend to be unsuccessful. This has led to a sharp drop in sports-themed titles over recent years especially with arcade titles. One of the most notable exceptions is Konami&#x27;s &quot;Pro Evolution Soccer&quot; series, which is often hailed as an alternative to the &quot;FIFA&quot; series, but does not contain as many licensed teams, players, kits, or competitions. Another deviation from the norm is Sony&#x27;s &quot;MLB The Show&quot; series, which now has a monopoly on the baseball genre after the withdrawal of 2K after &quot;MLB 2K13&quot;. Racing games, due to the variation that the sport can offer in terms of tracks, cars and styles, offer more room for competition and the selection of games on offer has been considerably greater (examples being F1 and the World Rally Championship, and many unlicensed games). Sports management games, while not as popular as they used to be, live on through small and independent software development houses. Management titles today have transitioned to the very popular fantasy sports leagues, which are available through many websites such as &quot;Yahoo&quot;. Independent developers are also creating sports titles like Super Mega Baseball, The Golf Club, and Freestyle2: Street Basketball.

Nintendo has been able to make an impact upon the sports market by producing several Mario-themed titles, such as &quot;Mario Sports Mix&quot;, &quot;Mario Golf: Super Rush&quot;, &quot;Mario Sports Superstars&quot;, &quot;Mario Tennis Aces&quot;, and &quot;Mario Strikers: Battle League&quot;. These titles sell respectfully, but are only available on Nintendo&#x27;s video game consoles, for example GameCube, Nintendo 64, Nintendo 3DS, Wii, Wii U and Nintendo Switch.

<text>Lamport (occasionally also Langport) was a hamlet in the parish of Stowe in north Buckinghamshire, England. It was cleared by the Temple family, as a result of enclosures, after 1739, to improve the amenity value of their new park at Stowe. The hamlet&#x27;s name is Old English, meaning &quot;long town&quot;.

==History==
Lamport consisted of two ancient manors, one of which was owned by the priory of Oseney and passed to Stowe; the other seems to have belonged to Luffield Abbey, whose estate had passed, by 1350, to a family named after the hamlet, and subsequently passed by marriage, in 1416, to the Dayrells (whose name continues in the village name of Lillingstone Dayrell). It was annexed to Stowe to provide homes for the staff and servants of the new manor house there.

In 1637, Peter Temple enclosed land around Lamport for his deer park. This aggrieved the Dayrells, who owned some of the enclosed land. A dispute, occasionally violent, ensued and eventually led to litigation in 1640 and a petition to Parliament. Notwithstanding the Dayrells&#x27; resistance, the village&#x27;s continued to be enclosed and it was abandoned sometime after 1739.

<text>Utah Saints are an English electronic music duo consisting of members Jez Willis and Tim Garbutt. The band had three top-ten and another five top-40 singles on the UK Singles Chart in the 1990s, as well as number-one dance tracks in the UK and US. They were notable for pioneering use of sampling technology, in particular, their practice of manipulating samples from mainstream pop, rock, R&amp;B and soul songs and combining them with contrasting dance beats, using the samples in a new context. The band wrote, produced and mixed all of their own music.
The duo were joined on stage by additional musicians when they played live from 1991 to 2001. They were one of the first electronic groups to play as a live collective and supported both the Shamen and U2 live at 10 stadium shows. Since then the duo have performed live sets themselves.

Utah Saints ran clubs from 1988 to 1994, particularly Ricky&#x27;s and The Gallery (later the Pleasure Rooms). They booked new DJs, including Pete Tong, Carl Cox, Paul Oakenfold, Sasha, Justice, Annie Mac and Zane Lowe. They then ran their own Sugarbeat club night from 1998 to 2010 in Leeds, Edinburgh and London, booking a diverse range of acts such as Soulwax, Erol Alkan, Felix Da Housecat, Zane Lowe, Annie Mac and Tiga. They continue to book electronic acts and DJs, curating a stage at Beatherder Festival for three days every year since 2007.

They had five further UK top 40 singles including a top 10 between 2000 and 2012, and continue to produce music, DJ in clubs and at festivals, promote nights, curate festival stages and write music for film, trailers and games.

==Biography==
Utah Saints were described as &quot;the first true stadium house band&quot; by the KLF&#x27;s Bill Drummond, though their music is difficult to place into one genre. The dance group originally met as music promoters and DJs for the Mix Nightclub in Harrogate in the early 1990s. They began as MDMA (Mega Dance Metal Allegiance), featuring two former The Cassandra Complex members Jez Willis and Keith Langley, along with Bobby Rae and guitarist Martin Scott. Willis started The Utah Saints with the addition of Tim Garbutt. Langley played the drums with the band in the early days and has provided artwork and photography for a number of their releases.

They first had chart success under the name Utah Saints with the singles &quot;What Can You Do For Me&quot; (UK No. 10), &quot;Something Good&quot; (their biggest UK success at No. 4) and &quot;Believe in Me&quot;, a UK No. 8 chart hit, which they described as their vocal sample trilogy. &quot;What Can You Do For Me&quot; featured samples from Eurythmics&#x27; &quot;There Must Be An Angel (Playing With My Heart)&quot; and Gwen Guthrie&#x27;s &quot;Ain&#x27;t Nothin&#x27; Goin&#x27; on But the Rent&quot;. &quot;Something Good&quot; heavily sampled Kate Bush&#x27;s &quot;Cloudbusting&quot; and &quot;Believe in Me&quot; was based on &quot;Love Action&quot; by Human League and &quot;You Gave Me Love&quot; by Crown Heights Affair. The fourth single &quot;I Want You&quot; was based around a sample from the Slayer song &quot;War Ensemble&quot;.

Contrary to rumours, the band was not sued by Kate Bush over the use of a sample from Bush&#x27;s track &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;, in the Utah Saints track &quot;Something Good&quot; – the sample was legally cleared before use. Additionally, Bush sold Utah Saints footage from the video of her original song. This track, with new vocals by the singer and actress Davina Perera, experienced a revival in the clubs in 2008 and reached No. 1 on UK Dance Chart. The track featured new remixes by Van She, High Contrast, Prok &amp; Fitch, eSquire, Ian Carey and more.

Utah Saints then moved away from vocal samples with singles such as &quot;I Want You&quot; (sampling thrash metal band Slayer) and &quot;I Still Think of You&quot; (Jez Willis providing original vocals on both). The latter was on the soundtrack to the film &quot;Shopping&quot; and DJ Tim briefly appears in the film Utah Saints also had three songs — &quot;Hands Up&quot;, &quot;Techknowledgy&quot; and &quot;Sick&quot; — featured in the hit video game &quot;Carmageddon TDR2000&quot;. Their song &quot;Sick&quot; was included on the 2002 PlayStation 2 soundtrack &quot;Wipeout Fusion&quot;. Another single, &quot;Power To The Beats&quot; featured on the &quot;FIFA 2001&quot; football game.

After their debut album, the self-titled &quot;Utah Saints&quot;, and one further single &quot;Ohio&quot;, which was based around samples from the Jocelyn Brown song &quot;Somebody Else&#x27;s Guy&quot; and &quot;That&#x27;s The Way I Like It&quot; by KC &amp; the Sunshine Band, Utah Saints seemed to disappear for several years. They were busy doing remixes (for artists including Blondie, The Human League, Hawkwind, Simple Minds, James, Annie Lennox and The Osmonds and the theme to the 1995 movie &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;), and producing tracks for other artists such as Terrorvision. During this time, they recorded an album that was to be called &#x27;Wired World&#x27; but was never released, and produced a handful of tracks that have not been released, with titles such as &quot;Star&quot;, &quot;Train&quot; and &quot;Rock&quot;.

The Utah Saints then took a break, saying that they stopped before they got into a vicious cycle of people expecting them to come up with hits, and instead write music they wanted to hear. Garbutt toured the United States with Orbital, Moby and Aphex Twin, whilst Willis appeared on the dance music radio station Kiss 105 in Yorkshire, hosting a popular Sunday night show on the history of dance music.

They reappeared in late 1999 with charting singles &quot;Love Song&quot; and &quot;Funky Music Sho&#x27; &#x27;Nuff Turns Me On&quot; (featuring Edwin Starr on guest vocals), plus &quot;Power to the Beats&quot; and &quot;Lost Vagueness&quot; (featuring Chrissie Hynde). They also issued the album, &quot;Two&quot;, which included samples from Michael Stipe from R.E.M., Joyce Sims, and a track with a sample from Metallica - the first time a sample had been cleared by the band, with featured vocals by Chuck D from Public Enemy, and Edwin Starr

In 2000, Utah Saints did the soundtrack for the video game &quot;Carmageddon TDR2000&quot; along with &quot;Power to the Beats&quot; being featured on &quot;FIFA 2001&quot;. In 2001, they supported Feeder on the second leg of their UK tour with a DJ set. In 2002, they went quiet again, resurfacing in 2008 with a single release.

They have been working on projects under other names, such as BeatVandals, as well as developing their regular Leeds and Edinburgh-based club night &#x27;SugarBeatClub&#x27;. They opened a new recording studio on the outskirts of Leeds with fellow Leeds DJs and producers Riley &amp; Durrant in 2008.

In 2007, their hit &quot;Something Good&quot; was remixed by Australian producers Van She. Originally a bootleg, the Utah Saints approved it and facilitated a re-record with a new vocal performance, overseeing final production and edits. It was signed to the Ministry of Sound record label, who released it in January 2008, where it reached No. 8 in the UK chart – their second biggest chart success, behind the original version of &quot;Something Good&quot;. The video for &quot;Something Good 08&quot; featured people doing the &quot;running man&quot; dance that was originally performed by MC Hammer. The track was the most played single in 2008 on BBC Radio 1.

Released on iTunes on 11 January 2009 was the Utah Saints&#x27; club mix of Girls Aloud&#x27;s &quot;The Loving Kind&quot;. In November 2009, the band produced a remix of the Liverpool-based dance duo Killaflaw&#x27;s &quot;Set Me on Fire&quot;. This formed part of Killaflaw&#x27;s third single and was made available digitally in December of that year. Utah Saints remixed the band &quot;Bring Me The Horizon&quot; the same year.

In August 2010, Utah Saints announced the launch of a new record label called Sugarbeat. The first release was Santero&#x27;s &quot;Drop the Bomb&quot;. Utah Saints played the Together Winter Music Festival in London at the Alexandra Palace on 26 November 2010. Then went to play Beat-Herder festival, on the Toiltrees stage, in 2012.

In 2012, &quot;What Can You Do For Me&quot; was remixed by drum and bass duo Drumsound &amp; Bassline Smith. Utah Saints then added to the remix and the track became a collaboration, received airplay, entered the top 10 on the dance chart and the top 30 in the national chart. Hervé and Tantrum Desire provided new 2012 remixes for the song, the remix by Herve was made to sound like a remix of the original 1990s single, so Herve cut out the new material performed by Drumsound &amp; Bassline Smith. &quot;What Can You Do For Me&quot; peaked at No. 28 on the UK Singles Chart. It was included on the 2012 edition of Ministry of Sound&#x27;s Addicted To Bass series. The Cut-Up Boys mashed up &quot;What Can You Do For Me&quot; with &quot;Midnight Run&quot; by Example and Feed Me.

In 2015, Utah Saints released one copy of a work in progress track titled &quot;Swansong D&#x27;Amour&quot; which was played on BBC by Mistajam.

Utah Saints revealed on Twitter in October 2021 that they captured crowd noises from fans celebrating the Toronto Blue Jays victory during the 1992 World Series over the Atlanta Braves. The band says they captured these sounds and incorporated them into performance.

<doc id="387570" wikidata="Q813312" url="?curid=387570" title="Beats International">
<text>Beats International were a British dance music band and hip-hop collective, formed in the late 1980s by Norman Cook (later in his career known as Fatboy Slim) based in Brighton, East Sussex, England, after his departure from the Housemartins.

A loose confederation of musicians, the line-up also included vocalist Lindy Layton, former North of Cornwallis vocalist Lester Noel, rappers DJ Baptiste (The Crazy MC), MC Wildski and keyboardist Andy Boucher. Unusually, the band&#x27;s live line-up also incorporated a graffiti artist, REQ, who painted designs on a backdrop while the musicians played.

==Biography==
After having a few small hits under his own name such as &quot;Blame It on the Bassline&quot;, a 1989 hip-house crossover single featuring MC Wildski, and &quot;For Spacious Lies&quot; with Lester Noel, Cook decided that further releases would be under the collective name &quot;Beats International&quot; – just one of the names he went on to use in the 1990s.

Beats International&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;Let Them Eat Bingo&quot; included these solo hits and the original version of &quot;Won&#x27;t Talk About It&quot; which featured Billy Bragg singing in a soulful falsetto. The album also spawned the UK number-one single &quot;Dub Be Good to Me&quot;, a re-working of the SOS Band&#x27;s chart-topper &quot;Just Be Good to Me&quot;, based on a sample of the bassline from the Clash&#x27;s &quot;Guns of Brixton&quot;. This song was the first to be credited under the Beats International name and featured sometime actor Layton on vocals.

The collective followed their number-one single with a re-recorded version of &quot;Won&#x27;t Talk About It&quot;, which replaced Billy Bragg&#x27;s vocal with that of Layton and Noel, and &quot;Burundi Blues&quot;, a track which featured samples of Bessie Jones, the Thrashing Doves and, on the album version, Brian Cant&#x27;s introduction from &quot;Camberwick Green&quot;.

The second Beats International album was 1991&#x27;s &quot;Excursion on the Version&quot;, which featured a greater use of dub and reggae sounds, but failed to repeat the success of its predecessor. This was the final Beats International recording, with Cook next going on to form Freak Power.

<text>Jesse Douglas (July 3, 1897 – September 7, 1965) was an American mathematician and Fields Medalist known for his general solution to Plateau&#x27;s problem.

== Life and career ==
He was born to a Jewish family in New York City, the son of Sarah (née Kommel) and Louis Douglas. He attended City College of New York as an undergraduate, graduating with honors in Mathematics in 1916. He then moved to Columbia University as a graduate student, obtaining a PhD in mathematics in 1920.

Douglas was one of two winners of the first Fields Medals, awarded in 1936. He was honored for solving, in 1930, the problem of Plateau, which asks whether a minimal surface exists for a given boundary. The problem, open since 1760 when Lagrange raised it, is part of the calculus of variations and is also known as the &quot;soap bubble problem&quot;. Douglas also made significant contributions to the inverse problem of the calculus of variations. The American Mathematical Society awarded him the Bôcher Memorial Prize in 1943.

Douglas worked at Columbia University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Institute for Advanced Study. Later he became a full professor at the City College of New York where he taught until his death. At the time CCNY only offered undergraduate degrees and he taught the advanced calculus course.

<text>S&#x27;Express (pronounced &quot;ess-express&quot;; sometimes spelled S&#x27;Xpress or S-Express) was a British dance music act from the late 1980s, who had one of the earliest commercial successes in the acid house genre.

&quot;Theme from S&#x27;Express&quot;, which contained elements from Rose Royce&#x27;s &quot;Is It Love You&#x27;re After&quot;, was one of the earliest recordings to capitalize on the emergence of sampling culture. The song went to number one in the UK Singles Chart for two weeks in April 1988. It made the Hot Dance Club Play chart in the US (also scraping into the U.S. &quot; Billboard&quot; Hot 100 at number 91). In 2016 Mark Moore released a remix album called Enjoy This Trip which retooled S’Express’s music for the 21st century through working with guests such as Punks Jump Up and Chris &amp; Cosey. 

==Biography==
The main player in the act was disc jockey and producer Mark Moore. In 1989, the group released its debut album, &quot;Original Soundtrack&quot;, which featured a line-up of Moore, Pascal Gabriel, Jocasta, Mark D, Linda Love, and Michellé. The album consisted of slightly longer versions of S-Express&#x27;s &quot;Theme&quot;, its follow-up hits &quot;Superfly Guy&quot; (UK No. 5) and a cover version of Sly and the Family Stone&#x27;s &quot;Hey Music Lover&quot; (UK No. 6; its b-side was remixed by minimalist composer Philip Glass).

By the release of the second album &quot;Intercourse&quot;, the act was reduced to a duo of Moore with new vocalist and DJ Sonique. Although not as successful as its debut, &quot;Intercourse&quot; spawned several mid-charting UK singles and club hits, including &quot;Nothing to Lose&quot;, co-written with Martin Gordon, as were several other tunes on the record. Sonique, already a successful DJ, eventually embarked on a solo career and produced one of the biggest club hits of the late 1990s (&quot;It Feels So Good&quot;). Moore went on to release many singles, remixes and albums on his own and also formed the band Needledust.

<doc id="387576" wikidata="Q1451936" url="?curid=387576" title="List of sultans of Brunei">
<text>The Sultan of Brunei is the monarchical head of state of Brunei and head of government in his capacity as prime minister of Brunei. Since independence from the British in 1984, only one sultan has reigned, though the royal institution dates back to the 14th century. The Sultan of Brunei can be thought of as synonymous with the ruling House of Bolkiah, with generations being traced from the first sultan, Muhammad Shah, temporarily interrupted by the thirteenth sultan, Abdul Hakkul Mubin, who in turn was deposed by a member of the House of Bolkiah. The sultan&#x27;s full title is His Majesty The Sultan and [[Yang di-Pertuan Negara|Yang di-Pertuan]] of Brunei Darussalam.

==Sultans==
==His Majesty The Sultan’s Flight==

The Sultan has had a private fleet of VIP aircraft since 1979 consisting of Boeing 747-8(V8-BKH) Boeing 767-200 (V8-MHB) and Boeing 787-8 (V8-OAS), as well as helicopters such as Sikorsky S70 and S76.

The aircraft fleet are not part of the nation’s Air Force. Other than the 747-8, the other two aircraft sport Royal Brunei Airlines colours.

==Uncertainties==
The earliest historical record of the Sultans of Brunei is not clearly known due to the poor early documentation of Brunei history. In addition there has been an effort to &quot;Islamise&quot; the history, with the &quot;official history&quot; not matching up with verifiable foreign sources The &quot;Batu Tarsilah&quot;, the genealogical record of the kings of Brunei, was not started until 1807. Therefore, much of the interpretation of history relied on earlier Chinese sources and legends. It seems that the early Sultanate of Brunei was dependent on Chinese support, and perhaps early Sultans were of Chinese origin. Furthermore, the earliest Sultans may have been practicing the Hindu or Buddhist religions, with early names indicating this origin.

In recent years, Brunei&#x27;s historiography has been reexamined due to the disparity between the official regnal years of the sultans and the historical facts that are currently available. An unnamed Tagalog trader who resided in Brunei before to 1590 made the first recorded attempt to document the country&#x27;s history; John S. Carroll subsequently published his work. By claiming that the Bruneis were invaders who subjugated the indigenous Bisayahs, this merchant distinguished clearly between accepted customs and empirical evidence. Although traditional belief credited this migration to Sultan Yuso, who supposedly came in Brunei after orchestrating a major exodus from the Malay-speaking city of Cauin, he suggested that the Bruneians moved from the Mekong Delta in the late 17th century. The trader said that Sultan Yuso conquered the Bisayahs, found riches, and was then granted power by the Chinese Emperor. Even while his story is full with regional folklore, it also makes reference to actual monarchs like Sultan Soliman and Sultan Abdul Kahar, which helps establish him as a reliable historian.

The next important character in Brunei&#x27;s history is Datuk Imam Ya&#x27;akub, who wrote between 1680 and 1690, under Sultan Aliuddin&#x27;s rule. He put together a &quot;Silsilah&quot; that served as the foundation for the initial sections of two books that Amin Sweeney revised. Regretfully, these passages contradict each other, casting doubt on Ya&#x27;akub&#x27;s actual identification of Sultan Ahmad and whether he was referring to the Chinese mandarin Ong Sum Ping or Sultan Muhammad&#x27;s brother. This suggests that the text has been corrupted over time. Sir Hugh Low stands out among the European explorers of Southeast Asia due to his intense interest in history. Prior to Donald Brown&#x27;s publication of his work in 1970, his 1880 submission to the Journal of the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society was the first significant modern attempt to record Brunei&#x27;s history. Despite having access to Pengiran Kasuma&#x27;s &quot;Silsilah&quot; and other records, Low was unable to date Brunei&#x27;s historical chronology since it lacked dates and allusions to outside events. Given the lengthy reigns of multiple sultans at that time, he surmised that the adoption of Islam and the founding of the dynasty most likely took place about 1403, but they may have happened earlier.

Due to differing opinions on the number of sultans mentioned in the &quot;Silsilah&quot;, it has been difficult to determine the exact date of Muhammad Shah. This disparity calls into doubt not only the notable lack of documents from 1690 to 1790, but also co-reigning sultans, competing monarchs, and lesser-known individuals, like the newborn Olivier van Noort cited. Sweeney&#x27;s critical edition of the London manuscripts of the &quot;Silsilah&quot; was supposed to further historical study in Brunei, but in the end, it didn&#x27;t because the inconsistencies in the texts made researchers hesitant to conduct more in-depth research. A significant contribution was made in 1970 by Brown, who collected several historical views in his study &quot;Brunei: The Structure and History of a Bornean Malay Sultanate&quot;. He brought up Paul Pelliot&#x27;s association between Mahmud Shah and Ma-ha-mo-sha, implying that Muhammad Shah&#x27;s rule may have begun as early as the 14th century. But Brown also cited P. Manuel Teixeira&#x27;s analysis of &#x27;s correspondence, which suggested that there were two different Bruneis: a pagan and a Muslim. Local academics opposed this idea, arguing that Brunei was established as a Muslim kingdom under Muhammad Shah from the beginning, so confirming the idea that it has always been a shining example of Islam in Southeast Asia.

An inscription discovered in 1979 indicated that Abdul Majid Hassan, the son of Muhammad Shah, passed away in A.H. 440/A.D. 1048. This would have placed Brunei as the first Muslim kingdom in Southeast Asia and dated Muhammad Muhammad&#x27;s rule to the early 17th century. However, experts eventually refuted this notion. The release of an erroneous family tree that featured the fake Abdul Majid dashed hopes for a more academic study of Brunei&#x27;s history, which had been raised by the establishment of the Brunei History Centre in 1984. A new history curriculum that mandated extensive textbooks in 1987 heightened the drive for clarity in Brunei&#x27;s history and raised serious concerns about the reign of Muhammad Shah, Bendahara Sakam&#x27;s accomplishments, and the circumstances surrounding Muhammad Aliuddin&#x27;s death in 1690. In 1988, these important historical questions were still being debated.
