<text>Colleen Margaretta McCullough (; married name Robinson, previously Ion-Robinson; 1 June 193729 January 2015) was an Australian author known for her novels, her most well-known being &quot;The Thorn Birds&quot; and &quot;The Ladies of Missalonghi&quot;.

==Life==
McCullough was born in 1937 in Wellington, in the Central West region of New South Wales, to James and Laurie McCullough. Her father was of Irish descent and her mother was a New Zealander of part-Māori descent. During her childhood, the family moved around a great deal and she was also &quot;a voracious reader&quot;.

Her family eventually settled in Sydney where she attended Holy Cross College, Woollahra, having a strong interest in both science and the humanities.

She had a younger brother, Carl, who drowned off the coast of Crete when he was 25 while trying to rescue tourists in difficulty. She based a character in &quot;The Thorn Birds&quot; on him, and also wrote about him in &quot;Life Without the Boring Bits&quot;.

Before her tertiary education, McCullough earned a living as a teacher, librarian and journalist. In her first year of medical studies at the University of Sydney she suffered dermatitis from surgical soap and was told to abandon her dreams of becoming a medical doctor. Instead, she switched to neuroscience and worked at Royal North Shore Hospital in Sydney.

In 1963, McCullough moved for four years to the United Kingdom; at the Great Ormond Street Hospital in London she met the chairman of the neurology department at Yale University who offered her a research associate job at Yale. She spent 10 years (April 1967 to 1976) researching and teaching in the Department of Neurology at the Yale Medical School in New Haven, Connecticut, United States. While at Yale she wrote her first two books. One of these, &quot;The Thorn Birds&quot;, became an international bestseller and one of the best selling books in history, with sales of over 30 million copies worldwide, that in 1983 inspired one of the most-watched television miniseries of all time.

Following &quot;The Thorn Birds&quot;, McCullough wrote her magnum opus: seven novels on the life and times of Julius Caesar, each a colossus weighing in at up to 1,000 pages. &quot;The Masters of Rome&quot; series preoccupied her for almost 30 years, from the early 1980s to the publication of the final volume in 2007. The research was a monumental task: a library of several thousand books and monographs on every aspect of Roman history and civilisation accumulated on the shelves of her home. She drew maps of cities and battlefields, scoured the world&#x27;s museums for busts and inscriptions, consulted experts in a dozen universities and recorded every known fact about her subject and his times.

The success of these books enabled her to give up her medical-scientific career and to try to &quot;live on [her] own terms.&quot; In the late 1970s, after stints in London and Connecticut, she settled on the isolation of Norfolk Island, off the coast of mainland Australia, where she met her husband, Ric Robinson. They married in April 1984. Under his birth name Cedric Newton Ion-Robinson, he was a member of the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly. He changed his name formally to Ric Newton Ion Robinson in 2002.

McCullough&#x27;s 2008 novel, &quot;The Independence of Miss Mary Bennet&quot; engendered controversy with her reworking of characters from Jane Austen&#x27;s &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;. Susannah Fullerton, the president of the Jane Austen Society of Australia, said she &quot;shuddered&quot; while reading the novel, as she felt that Elizabeth Bennet was rewritten as weak, and Mr. Darcy as savage. Fullerton said: &quot;[Elizabeth] is one of the strongest, liveliest heroines in literature … [and] Darcy&#x27;s generosity of spirit and nobility of character make her fall in love with him – why should those essential traits in both of them change in 20 years?&quot;

==Death==

McCullough died on 29 January 2015, at the age of 77, in the Norfolk Island Hospital, Burnt Pine, from apparent renal failure after suffering from a series of small strokes. She had suffered from failing eyesight due to haemorrhagic macular degeneration, and also suffered from osteoporosis, trigeminal neuralgia, diabetes and uterine cancer, and used a wheelchair full-time.

She was buried in a traditional Norfolk Island funeral ceremony at the Emily Bay cemetery on the island.

==Awards==
In 1978, McCullough received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In 1984, a portrait of McCullough, painted by Wesley Walters, was a finalist in the Archibald Prize. The prize is awarded for the &quot;best portrait painting preferentially of some man or woman distinguished in Art, Letters, Science or Politics&quot;. The depth of historical research for the novels on ancient Rome led to her being awarded a Doctor of Letters degree by Macquarie University in 1993.

==Honours==
McCullough was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia on 12 June 2006, &quot;[f]or service to the arts as an author and to the community through roles supporting national and international educational programs, medico-scientific disciplines and charitable organisations and causes&quot;.

==Controversies==

Following the publication of &quot;The Ladies of Missalonghi&quot; in 1987, McCullough was accused of having plagiarised &quot;The Blue Castle&quot;, a 1926 novel by L. M. Montgomery. McCullough responded that any similarities were due to subconscious recollection.

In an interview with &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; in November 2004 to promote &quot;Angel Puss&quot;, McCullough said the men of Pitcairn Island that were convicted of sexual encounters with children should have been allowed to follow their &quot;custom&quot; and have sex with young girls. &quot;The Poms have cracked the whip and it&#x27;s an absolute disgrace. These are indigenous customs and should not be touched. These were the first people to inhabit Pitcairn Island, and they are racially unique.&quot; she said. &quot;It&#x27;s hypocritical, too. Does anybody object when Muslims follow their customs?&quot; The comments generated stories at the time, and were mentioned in her obituaries.

<doc id="381511" wikidata="Q516373" url="?curid=381511" title="Kokura">
<text>is an ancient castle town and the center of modern Kitakyushu, Japan. Kokura is also the name of the penultimate station on the southbound San&#x27;yō Shinkansen line, which is owned by JR West. Ferries connect Kokura with Matsuyama on Shikoku, and Busan in South Korea.

==History==

===Edo period===

The Ogasawara and Hosokawa clans were &quot;daimyō&quot; at Kokura Castle during the Edo period (1603–1868). Miyamoto Musashi, samurai swordsman, author of &quot;The Book of Five Rings&quot; and founder of the Hyoho Niten Ichi-ryū, famous for its use of two swords, lived in the Kokura castle under the patronage of the Ogasawara and Hosokawa clans briefly during 1634.

===Meiji period===
After the end of the Tokugawa Shogunate, Kokura was the seat of government for Kokura Prefecture. When the municipal system of cities, towns and villages was introduced, Kokura Town was one of 25 towns in the prefecture, which later merged with Fukuoka Prefecture. Kokura was upgraded to city status in 1900.

===World War II===
Kokura was the primary target for the &quot;Fat Man&quot; atomic bomb on August 9, 1945, but on the morning of the raid, the city was obscured by morning fog. Kokura had also been mistaken for the neighboring city of Yahata the day before by the reconnaissance missions. Since the mission commander Major Charles Sweeney had orders to drop the bomb visually and not by radar, he diverted to the secondary target, Nagasaki. The planes, however, did fly over Kokura and were extremely close to executing the mission drop. 

===Post-war===
When the city of Kitakyushu was created in 1963, Kokura was divided into Kokura Kita ward in the north, and Kokura Minami ward in the south.

==Notable residents==
*Matsumoto Seichō – writer
*Miyamoto Musashi – swordsman and rōnin
*Mori Ōgai – physician, translator, novelist and poet
*Tetsuya Theodore Fujita – Meteorologist

==Notable figures born in Kokura==
* Tsukasa Hojo, mangaka
* Leiji Matsumoto, mangaka
* Masumi Mitsui, 10th Battalion, CEF.
* Linda Yamamoto, singer and J-pop idol
* Satoru Nomura, yakuza godfather, leader of the Kudo-kai

==Festivals==
The Gion Festival of Kokura is called the &quot;Gion of Drums&quot; and celebrates the life of local folk-hero Muhomatsu.

==Notable facts==
The city is the site of the main dojo (honbu) of Miyamoto Musashi&#x27;s sword school, Hyoho Niten Ichi-ryū.

The northern bottlenose whale was hunted heavily by Norway and Britain in the 19th and early 20th centuries. It is one of the deepest-diving mammals known, reaching depths of 2,339 m (7,674 ft) and capable of diving for up to 130 minutes.

==Description==
When physically mature, northern bottlenose whales can reach in length, smaller than giant beaked whales, and larger than known records of southern bottlenose whales. Their foreheads, or melons are sexually dimorphic, so that mature males have larger melons, which are flattened or square shape, while mature females and juveniles have rounder melons. Melon coloration can vary, though it appears the head of most males becomes more white or buff colored with age. The beak is not as long as other beaked whale species, and only mature males have two small teeth, which erupt at the front end of the bottom jaw, but are not easily seen. Females also have teeth, but they are buried in the jaw and do not erupt. The dorsal fin is relatively small, at and about two thirds of the way back on their bodies. It is falcate (sickle-shaped) and usually pointed. The back is mid-to-dark grey with a lighter underside. They weigh approximately . The oldest recorded age, determined by counting annual growth layers from a tooth in a whaled specimen was 37. Calves have prolonged weaning and nursing continues until juveniles are 3–4 years old. Males become sexually mature between 7 and 11 years old, females between 8 and 12 years old. They live in ocean areas deeper than 6,500 feet.

==Behaviours==
Unlike many species of beaked whale, northern bottlenose whales are known to approach and appear curious about vessels, which made them relatively easy targets for whale hunters. However they have demonstrated avoidance to certain sounds such as those emitted by naval sonar in controlled dose response studies.

Underwater recordings have found that northern bottlenose whales produce regular high frequency clicks in click trains, which have a characteristic frequency modulated pulse or &quot;upsweep&quot;, commonly found in other species of beaked whales. Northern bottlenose whales live in social groups, and are typically found at the surface in groups of 4 to 20.

== Feeding ==
Northern bottlenose feed mainly on deep water squid, primarily Gonatus sp., and bottom fish, such as Greenland halibut. Foraging dives can last an hour or more at depths reaching over 1000 meters. A small percentage of northern bottlenose whales have also been observed feeding on redfish, rabbitfish, spiny dogfish, and skate.

==Population and distribution==
The northern bottlenose whale is endemic to the North Atlantic Ocean and populations are found in the deep (&gt;500 m) cold subarctic waters of the Davis Strait, the Labrador Sea, the Greenland Sea and the Barents Sea, but can range as far south as Newfoundland and Nova Scotia. As of 2017, the population in the North East Atlantic is estimated to be between 10,000 and 45,000. However their population number is very poorly understood.

&quot;The Gully&quot;, a large submarine canyon east of Nova Scotia, is the home of the &quot;Scotian Shelf&quot; population of 164 whales, currently listed under Canada&#x27;s &quot;Species at Risk Act&quot; as endangered. This population is the focus of a long-term research project conducted by the Whitehead Lab, at Dalhousie University since 1988.

In 1976 the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission identified a single population across the North Atlantic. In 2011 COSEWIC determined that there are two populations off eastern Canada (Scotian Shelf and Labrador-Davis Strait Designated Units), which recent studies have confirmed are genetically distinct from each other.
Individual northern bottlenose whales have also been sighted off the Azores and Canary Islands.

On 20 January 2006, a female northern bottlenose whale was spotted in Central London in the River Thames. The River Thames whale reached as far up river as Albert Bridge. She was moved onto a barge and rescuers hoped to take her out to sea, but she died following a convulsion on 21 January during its rescue. Her skeleton is now in the Natural History Museum in London.

There was another sighting on 6 August 2019 at Loch Linnhe, a sea loch located off the West coast of Scotland. At the time it was thought to be searching for food in the area. There have been 21 previous live sightings of the northern bottlenose whale in Scotland since 2000. It is speculated that these whales may migrate to north west European shelf waters in the summertime.

On 1 October 2020 a rescue group ushered a group of northern bottlenose whales out of Loch Long, north of Glasgow, it is speculated that these whales moved to shallow water in response to a military sonar exercises.

== History of discovery ==
It was first described by Johann Reinhold Forster in 1770, basing the name on the &quot;bottle-nosed whales&quot; seen by Pehr Kalm in his &quot;Travels into North America&quot;, and on Thomas Pennant&#x27;s 1766 description of Samuel Dale&#x27;s &quot;bottle-head whale&quot; found stranded above a bridge in Maldon, Essex, in 1717.

== Conservation ==
Prior to the beginning of whaling, it is estimated that there were upwards of 100,000 northern bottlenose whales in the North Atlantic. Between 1850 and 1973, commercial hunting of the species, focused on populations found off Norway, Iceland, Greenland and Labrador, greatly reduced their numbers across their range. Current conservation concerns include threats from human activities such as disturbance related to offshore oil and gas developments and naval sonar, as well as entanglement in fishing gear, pollution, ingestion of plastic and ecosystem shifts related to climate change.

The International Whaling Commission designated the northern bottlenose whale as a protected stock in 1977 and set a zero catch quota. Northern bottlenose whales are still killed in the Faroe Islands. Faroese regulations only allow the killing of bottlenose whales which have beached themselves and cannot be driven out again. Long term statistics indicate that the most frequent beachings are in the villages of Hvalba and Sandvík on Suðuroy.

The northern bottlenose whale is listed under Canada&#x27;s &quot;Species at Risk Act&quot; as endangered, as near threatened under the IUCN red list and on Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). In addition, the northern bottlenose whale is covered by the Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of the Baltic, North East Atlantic, Irish and North Seas (ASCOBANS).

The northern bottlenose whale has among the lowest known mitochondrial diversity of any cetacean. Due to their low genetic diversity and slow reproductive rate, recovery of their populations may be vulnerable to human stressors and stochastic events.

<text>The DVD Forum was an international organization composed of hardware, software, media and production companies that use and develop the DVD and formerly HD DVD formats. It was initially known as the DVD Consortium, when it was founded in 1995.

==History and mission==
The DVD Forum was created to facilitate the exchange of information and ideas about the DVD format, another evolution of the LaserDisc format, and to enable it to grow through technical improvement and innovation. The organization hopes to promote worldwide acceptance of DVD for entertainment, consumer electronics and information technology applications. Membership in the DVD Forum is open to any company or organization involved in DVD research, development, or manufacturing; software firms and other DVD users interested in developing the format are also encouraged to join. Forum members can support other formats in addition to DVD.

The DVD Forum is responsible for the official DVD format specification. The group handles licensing of the DVD format and logo through the DVD Format and Logo Licensing Corporation (DVD FLLC), which also publishes the official &quot;DVD Book&quot; format specifications. Reference materials and newsletters are published for DVD Forum members.

In 2003, the DVD Forum had 213 members. In 2007, it had 195 registered members. In 2008, it had 159 registered members, and in 2010, it had 98 registered members. In 2012 this downward trend continued with the membership standing at 80 members. Since 1 April 2012, the Forum is in a &quot;Reduced Activity Mode&quot;, however the DVD FLLC is still active as of 2020. In October 2024, the DVD FLLC announced the deactivation of its website and confirmed that they were &quot;preparing the scheme that enables any Licensees to manufacture DVD products without &#x27;License&#x27; on and after January 1, 2025.&quot;

In January 2025, the DVD FLLC announced its own dissolution on January 31, 2025 (together with the DVD Forum itself, according to its charter) and the deposit of the DVD Specifications at the National Diet Library of Japan.

== Structure ==

The DVD Forum is governed by an elected Steering Committee. It has a Chair Company, and three Vice-Chair Companies: one from each of the consumer electronics, information technology, and content industries. The Chair and Vice-Chair Companies are elected for two-year terms.

In addition to the Steering Committee, the DVD Forum has the following committees:
*Technical Coordination Group to coordinate activities of the Working Groups and submit technical proposals to the Steering Committee
*a number of Working Groups to work on various aspects of the DVD format.
*Promotion &amp; Communication Committee to promote the exchange of information among participants
*Verification Policy Committee to maintain compliance of DVD products with the DVD Formats adopted by the DVD Forum
*Format/Logo Advisory Group to advise the Steering Committee on matters relating to names and logos and the licensing of DVD Formats and DVD logos

==Founding members==

12 companies that founded this organization:
* Hitachi, Ltd.
* Panasonic
* Mitsubishi Electric Corporation
* Pioneer Electronic Corporation
* Royal Philips Electronics N.V.
* Sony Group Corporation
* Thomson
* Warner Bros. Discovery
* Toshiba Corporation
* Victor Company of Japan, Ltd. (JVC)
* NBCUniversal
* The Walt Disney Company

==Rival formats==

Competing standards developed by the rival DVD+RW Alliance are for the &quot;plus&quot; formats (DVD+R, DVD+RW). Alliance leaders Philips, Sony and Thomson were also founding members of the DVD Forum, established in 1997. , both plus and dash formats seem equally popular with customers, and both are compatible with the vast majority of DVD players.

<text>Alleghany Corporation is an American investment holding company originally created by the railroad entrepreneurs Oris and Mantis Van Sweringen as a holding company for their railroad interests. It was incorporated in 1929 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1984. On March 21, 2022, Berkshire Hathaway made an $11.6 billion offer to acquire the company, which completed in October 2022.
After the company&#x27;s bankruptcy in the Great Depression, control of the company fell into the hands of Robert Ralph Young and Allan Price Kirby. Young used the company as a vehicle for his vendetta against the J.P. Morgan banking interests, who had financed the Van Sweringens and managed to defeat them and the Vanderbilt interests in a 1954 proxy fight for the New York Central Railroad. The failing New York Central was in worse shape than Young had bargained for and he committed suicide shortly after being forced to suspend the dividend in January 1958. After Young&#x27;s death, his role in NYC management was assumed by his protégé Alfred E. Perlman. Although much had been accomplished to streamline NYC operations, in those tough economic times, mergers with other railroads were seen as the only possible road to financial stability. The most likely suitor became the NYC&#x27;s former arch-rival Pennsylvania Railroad. During the early 1960s, New York Central negotiated a merger with the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR), which was led by Stuart T. Saunders after 1963. Saunders had most recently led the Norfolk and Western Railway through a successful expansion through acquisition and mergers including the Virginian Railway, Nickel Plate Road and Wabash Railway. There was great hope that success would result from the NYC-PRR combination. Penn Central Transportation Company was formed by the merger on February 1, 1968. However, the underlying financial weakness of both former railroads, combined with the fact that the ICC forced the chronically weak New Haven Railroad into the system, doomed the Penn Central and bankruptcy was declared a little over 2 years later, on June 21, 1970. Many of the Penn Central railroad assets ended up in Conrail, formed in 1976. The bankruptcy of the Penn Central railroad mostly ended Alleghany&#x27;s involvement in the railroad business.

The company&#x27;s residual railroad investments led to president and CEO John J. Burns serving on the board of Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation from 1995 to 2004.

Now Alleghany Corporation focuses on the insurance business (property, casualty, surety and fidelity insurance). Until his death in February 2011, Allan Kirby&#x27;s son, Fred M. Kirby 2nd, was the chairman of the board and a sometime member of the &quot;Forbes&quot; 400 list of richest Americans.

<doc id="381531" wikidata="Q4392501" url="?curid=381531" title="Crittenden–Johnson Resolution">
<text>The Crittenden–Johnson Resolution (also known as the Crittenden Resolution and the War Aims Resolution) was proposed in the United States Congress early in the American Civil War, as a conciliatory message to the slave states assuring them that the Northern war effort was not aimed at interfering with their rights to slavery, but solely towards restoring the Union. It was passed almost unanimously in July of 1861 after the shocking defeat at the First Battle of Bull Run. It was later rejected in December of that year during an attempt to reaffirm the resolution by congress.

The resolution is sometimes confused with the &quot;Crittenden Compromise,&quot; a series of unsuccessful proposals to amend the United States Constitution that were debated after slave states began seceding, in an attempt to prevent the Confederate States from leaving the Union. Both measures are sometimes confused with the Corwin Amendment, a proposal to amend the Constitution that was adopted by the 36th Congress, which attempted to put slavery and other states&#x27; rights under constitutional protection; it passed Congress but was not ratified by the states.

==Historical background==

The Crittenden–Johnson Resolution was passed almost unanimously by the 37th United States Congress on July 25, 1861. The bill was introduced as the War Aims Resolution, but it became better known for its sponsors Representative John J. Crittenden of Kentucky and Senator Andrew Johnson of Tennessee, both slaveholders. The American Civil War had begun on April 12, 1861, with various Southern states seceding in the following months. Both houses of Congress passed this resolution days after the First Battle of Bull Run made it clear that the war would not end quickly. It passed almost unanimously in July, but later that December, congress made an attempt to reaffirm the Crittenden–Johnson Resolution. This was an effort to maintain the initial promise of non-interference with slavery in both contended and rebellious states. However it was instead rejected during this session by a party vote motioned by Thaddeus Stevens.

President Abraham Lincoln was concerned that the slave states of Missouri, Kentucky, and Maryland in the crucial upper south might leave the Union to join the Confederate States of America. If Maryland were lost, Washington, D.C. would be entirely surrounded by Confederate territory. Both Missouri and Kentucky were slave states of questionable loyalty to the Union that bordered on important Union territory; Lincoln was born in Kentucky and losing his birth state would be seen as a political failure. Also, the Ohio River marks Kentucky&#x27;s northern border and was strategically important as the economic lifeline of Ohio, Illinois, and Indiana--each of which shipped goods down this river to the Mississippi River for sale or further shipment in New Orleans, Louisiana. Delaware (the other slave state that remained in the Union) had so few slaves that its loyalty would not be questioned.

==Meaning and context==

Introduced as the War Aims Resolution, the bill defined limited conservative goals for the Union effort during the Civil War. Although it made no mention of slavery, the resolution intended that the Union Government would take no actions against the peculiar institution of slavery. Its second clause, discussed below, stated the war was fought not for &quot;overthrowing or interfering with the rights or established institutions of those States,&quot; but to &quot;defend and maintain the supremacy of the Constitution and to preserve the Union.&quot; The resolution intended to retain the loyalty of Unionists in the slave-holding border states, as well as reassure Northerners who would fight to save the Union but not to free the slaves. It implied the war would end when the seceding states returned to the Union, with slavery intact.

Pennsylvania Congressman Thaddeus Stevens, an abolitionist, had opposed the bill when it was introduced on the grounds that, in war, Congress and the President had the right to take “any step which would subdue the enemy,” but he abstained from voting on the measure. By the December of 1861, opinion had shifted and during an attempt by congress to reaffirm the resolution Stevens was able to motion a successful party vote for the resolution&#x27;s rejection.
==Legislative action in the House==

The resolution was introduced on July 19, 1861, as troops massed at Manassas Junction, Virginia, about 25 miles from Washington, two days before the Battle of Bull Run. The House passed it immediately after the battle, when Union forces were routed by the Confederate army, creating intense concern in Washington about southern soldiers “in arms around the capital.”

The House vote was in two parts, or &quot;branches&quot;. The first branch read: &quot;Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Congress of the United States, That the present deplorable civil war has been forced upon the country by the disunionists of the southern States now in revolt against the constitutional government, and in arms around the capital.&quot; This branch passed the House 121–2. Two congressmen voted against it, Henry C. Burnett (Kentucky) and John W. Reid (Missouri). Both were expelled at the next session of the 37th Congress for taking up arms against the United States.

The second branch read: &quot;That in this national emergency, Congress, banishing all feelings of mere passion or resentment, will recollect only its duty to the whole country; that this war is not waged on their part in any spirit of oppression, or for any purpose of conquest or subjugation, or purpose of overthrowing or interfering with the rights or established institutions of those States, but to defend and maintain the supremacy of the Constitution, and to preserve the Union with all the dignity, equality, and rights of the several States unimpaired; and that as soon as these objects are accomplished the war ought to cease.&quot; This second branch passed the House 119–2. Two congressmen voted against this branch, John F. Potter (Wisconsin) and Albert G. Riddle (Ohio).

The House passed the complete measure on July 22, 1861, immediately after the battle.

==Senate action==

On July 25, 1861, the Senate rejected the two branch division, and passed the entire resolution 30–5. The five senators voting against the resolution were: John C. Breckinridge (Kentucky), Waldo P. Johnson (Missouri), Trusten Polk (Missouri), Lazarus W. Powell (Kentucky), and Lyman Trumbull (Illinois). Breckinridge, Johnson, and Polk were expelled from the Senate at the next session of the 37th Congress for supporting the Confederate rebellion. A motion was brought to expel Powell, but was defeated, in part due to a defense given by Illinois Senator Trumbull.

<doc id="381535" wikidata="Q200038" url="?curid=381535" title="Dassault Mirage 2000">
<text>The Dassault Mirage 2000 is a French multirole, single-engine, delta wing, fourth-generation jet fighter manufactured by Dassault Aviation. It was designed in the late 1970s as a lightweight fighter to replace the Mirage III for the French Air Force (&quot;Armée de l&#x27;air&quot;). The Mirage 2000 evolved into a multirole aircraft with several variants developed, with sales to a number of nations. It was later developed into the Mirage 2000N and 2000D strike variants, the improved Mirage 2000-5, and several export variants. Over 600 aircraft were built and it has been in service with nine nations.

==Development==

===Previous projects===
The origins of the Mirage 2000 could be traced back to 1965, when France and Britain agreed to develop the &quot;Anglo-French Variable Geometry&quot; (AFVG) swing-wing aircraft. Two years later, France withdrew from the project on grounds of costs, after which Britain would collaborate with West Germany and Italy to ultimately produce the Panavia Tornado. Dassault instead focused on its own variable-geometry aircraft, the Dassault Mirage G experimental prototype. The design was expected to materialise in the Mirage G8, which would serve as the replacement for the popular Mirage III in French Air Force service.

The Mirage 2000 started out as a secondary project tentatively named &quot;Delta 1000&quot; in 1972. Dassault was devoting considerable attention to the Mirage G8A, a fixed-geometry derivative of the Mirage G8 that served as the competitor to the Panavia Tornado. The Mirage G8, which was envisioned as the &quot;Avion de Combat Futur&quot; (ACF or Future Combat Aircraft) of the French Air Force (&quot;Armee de l&#x27;Air&quot;, &quot;AdA&quot;), did not align with the service&#x27;s conception of its future aircraft. The &quot;AdA&quot; wanted a Mach 3 fighter, not an interdictor aircraft incapable of dogfighting that was the Mirage G8. As such, Dassault redesigned the Mirage G8 into the two-engine Super Mirage G8A that would prove to be ambitious and expensive, being two and a half times the price of the Mirage F1 and over-engineered, especially compared to the General Dynamics F-16 that had just won orders from a number of European countries. Consequently, during a meeting of the National Defence Council on 18 December 1975, the Super Mirage was cancelled.

The ACF was a strike aircraft first and an interceptor second, while the Delta 2000 was the reverse, but the single-engine Delta 2000 was much more affordable. At the same National Defence Council meeting, a redesignated Mirage 2000 was offered to the &quot;AdA&quot;, and three prototypes were ordered. The &quot;AdA&quot; in March 1976 issued a set of official requirements whose parameters matched those of Dassault&#x27;s performance estimates of the new fighter. The aircraft&#x27;s primary role was interception with a secondary ground-attack capability; the &quot;AdA&quot; had a commitment for 200 aircraft. The first aircraft was to be delivered in 1982. This was a return to the first-generation Mirages, but with several important innovations that tried to solve their shortcomings.

===Production===
The production of the Mirage 2000 involved three construction sites, two located in Bordeaux that specialised in different components. The wings were built at Martignas, and the fuselages were fabricated at Argenteuil (NW of Paris), with final assembly taking place at Bordeaux–Mérignac Airport. The first prototype, Mirage 2000 No. 01, though, was hand built at Saint-Cloud, before being moved to Dassault&#x27;s Istres facility for assembly. At the hands of Jean Coureau, No. 01 made its first flight on 10 March 1978, a mere 27 months after the programme go-ahead. During the 65-minute flight, Coureau took the aircraft to Mach 1.02 without afterburner, before climbing to more than 12,000 m and accelerating the aircraft to Mach 1.3. By the end of May, the aircraft had surpassed Mach 2 and an indicated airspeed of . On the other end of the speed spectrum, the Mirage 2000 proved to be capable of low-speed flight, as demonstrated at the Farnborough Airshow in September 1978, during which Dassault pilot Guy Mitaux-Maurourd raised the aircraft&#x27;s nose to 25° angle of attack (AoA) as the aircraft slowed to . Later tests showed that the aircraft could attain 30° AoA while carrying fuel tanks and weapons.

The second prototype, No. 02, made its 50-minute first flight in September 1978 at the controls of Maurourd. The aircraft was to test some of the avionics systems and the carriage of weapons. Due to a flame-out while on a landing approach, the aircraft was lost in May 1984. No. 03 made its first flight in April 1979; equipped with a complete weapons system, it was used for radar and weapons trials. After 400 hours of flight, they were sent to &quot;Centre d&#x27;Essais en Vol&quot;, flight tests centre. Although three prototypes were ordered in December 1975, Dassault constructed an additional fourth single-seat demonstrator for its own purposes, which embodied lessons on the earlier aircraft, namely the reduction in fin height and an increased fin sweep, redesigned air inlets, and an FBW system. The only dual-seat Mirage 2000B of the test programme first flew on 11 October 1980.

The first production Mirage 2000C (C for &quot;chasseur&quot;, &quot;fighter&quot;) flew on 20 November 1982. Deliveries to the &quot;AdA&quot; began in 1983. The first 37 Mirage 2000Cs delivered were fitted with the Thomson-CSF Radar Doppler Multifunction (RDM), and were powered by the SNECMA M53-5 turbofan engine. The 38th Mirage 2000C had an upgraded SNECMA M53-P2 turbofan engine. The Radar Doppler à Impulsion (RDI) built by Thales for the Mirage 2000C entered service in 1987. It has a much improved range of about 150 km, and is linked to Matra Super 530D missiles, which are much improved compared to the older Super 530F. Look-down/shoot-down capabilities are much improved, as well, but this radar is not usually used for air-to-surface roles.

===Further development===

The Mirage 2000N is a dedicated nuclear-strike variant, which was intended to carry the Air-Sol Moyenne Portée (ASMP) nuclear stand-off missile. Flight tests of the first of two prototypes, Mirage 2000N 01 (eighth Mirage 2000) began on 3 February 1983. During the 65-minute flight, the aircraft reached a speed of Mach 1.5. The variant entered operational service in 1988, initially operating from Luxeuil Air Base with the 4e Escadre de Chasse. Closely derived from the Mirage 2000N is a dedicated conventional attack variant designated Mirage 2000D. Initial flight of the Mirage 2000D prototype, a modified Mirage 2000N prototype, was on 19 February 1991. The first flight of a production aircraft occurred 31 March 1993, and service introduction followed in April 1995. Seventy-five and eighty-six Mirage 2000Ns and Mirage 2000Ds were manufactured, respectively.

By the late 1980s, the Mirage 2000 was beginning to age compared with the latest models of F-16 fighters. In particular, attention was drawn to the aircraft&#x27;s inability to engage multiple targets simultaneously, and the small load of air-to-air missiles it could carry. Consequently, Dassault in April 1989 announced that with the cooperation of Thomson-CSF, it would be working on a privately funded update of the Mirage 2000C, which was to be named the Mirage 2000-5. A two-seat Mirage 2000B prototype was extensively modified as the first Mirage 2000-5 prototype, and it first flew on 24 October 1990. A Mirage 2000C prototype was also reworked to a similar standard, making its initial flight on 27 April 1991. The first front-line aircraft variant to have been designed specifically in response to the export market, Taiwan was the first country to order the type in 1992, followed by Qatar in 1994. The type was first delivered in 1996 and entered service in 1997.

Domestically, Dassault needed an order from the &quot;AdA&quot; to help promote foreign sales, and in 1993, the &quot;AdA&quot; decided to upgrade 37 of their existing Mirage 2000s to the 2000-5 specification as a stopgap before the arrival of the Rafale in &quot;AdA&quot; service. The upgraded aircraft were redesignated Mirage 2000-5F, and became operational in 2000. They retained the old countermeasures system with the Serval/Sabre/Spirale units and did not receive the ICMS 2 system. A two-seat version was developed, as well, whose rear seat has a heads-up display, but not an associated head-level display, and lacks a built-in cannon, although cannon pods can be carried.

At the urging of the United Arab Emirates, Dassault worked on a further modification of the Mirage 2000-5. Initially dubbed Mirage 2000-9, this variant had the upgrade of the radar and the associated avionics, the change of weapons configuration, and the extension of range.

The last Mirage 2000 was delivered on 23 November 2007 to the Hellenic Air Force; afterwards, the production line was shut down.

==Design==

===Overview===
The Mirage 2000 is a supersonic combat aircraft of metal construction that shares the general delta-wing layout with the Mirage III, yet incorporates avionics advances that help overcome the latter&#x27;s aerodynamic limitations. The aircraft&#x27;s low-set, thin wing has a leading-edge sweep back of 58° and a trailing-edge forward sweep of 3.5°. The flight surfaces on the wings are composed of four elevons and four leading edge slats. A feature of the delta wing is that it offers a comparatively large wing area for a particular design, thereby reducing the wing loading. The wing on a Mirage 2000 has an area of 41 m2, giving it a wing loading of some 77 lb/sq ft at a takeoff weight of 33,000 lb, making it much more manoeuvrable than the F-15 and the similarly sized F-16, which has a wing loading of 110 lb/sq ft. At normal combat load, however, the wing loading reduces to 45 lb/sq ft. One related advantage of the delta-wing design, and especially the Mirage 2000&#x27;s blending of the wing root and engine, is that it could accommodate more fuel, as the aircraft&#x27;s internal fuel tanks can carry over 900 gallons of fuel, up more than 200 gallons over the Mirage III. The aircraft&#x27;s fuselage is of traditional monocoque construction made of almost entirely of metal. The fuselage has been area-ruled to maintain a constant cross-sectional area along with the delta wing to minimise drag.

The aircraft uses retractable tricycle landing gear by Messier-Dowty, with twin nosewheels and a single wheel on each main gear. A runway tailhook or a fairing for a brake parachute can be fitted under the tail, which can operate in conjunction with the landing gear&#x27;s carbon brakes to shorten landing distances. A removable refueling probe can be attached in front of the cockpit, offset slightly to the right of centre.

An airbrake is fitted above and below each wing in an arrangement very similar to that of the Mirage III. A noticeably taller tailfin allows the pilot to retain control at AoAs past 25°, assisted by the small strakes mounted along each air intake. Some composites have been used for the fins, rudder, elevons, and various access panels, giving a weight saving of some 100 kg. The Mirage 2000 has been noted for its superb handling, especially given its delta-wing design.

Dassault engineers have embedded into the design a certain degree of relaxed stability as the centre of gravity, or neutral point, is placed ahead of the centre of pressure, enhancing maneuverability. It incorporates negative stability and fly-by-wire controls with four analog computers. As first demonstrated at the 1978 Farnborough Airshow, such designs, as well as the use of computer-controlled dynamic controls were capable of overcoming the delta-wing shortcomings related to poor low-speed control, while retaining the advantages, such as low drag, low radar cross section, ideal high-speed aerodynamics, and large internal volume, as well as simplicity, provided by the absence of horizontal tail surfaces.

Its aircraft flight control system is fly-by-wire, with two distinct modes of operation. The first allows for unrestricted operations within its full allowed flight envelope, and is used when carrying only air-to-air weapons. The second is used when carrying fuel tanks, air-to-ground munitions, or a mix of both. This second mode functions as a g-limiter, preventing heavier munitions from damaging the pylons that they are mounted on, and preventing them from potentially being pulled off of the pylons by excessive G-force.

===Cockpit===
The Mirage 2000 is available as a single-seat or twin-seat multirole fighter. The pilot flies the aircraft by means of a centre stick and left-hand throttles, with both incorporating HOTAS controls. The pilot sits on a SEM MB Mk10 zero-zero ejection seat (a license-built version of the British Martin-Baker Mark 10).

The instrument panel (in the Mirage 2000 C) is dominated by a Sextant VE-130 head-up display which presents data relating to flight control, navigation, target engagement, and weapon firing, and a radar screen located centrally below it.

===Engines===
The SNECMA M53 afterburning turbofan was developed for the ACF, and was available for the Mirage 2000 project. It is a single-shaft engine of modular construction that is relatively light and simple compared to those of the British or American designs. The M53 consists of three low-pressure compressor stages, five high-pressure stages, and two turbine stages. With the development programme consisting of 20 engines, the M53 &quot;sans suffix&quot; was first bench tested in February 1970, and became airborne on a Caravelle testbed in July 1973. Dassault conducted flight tests of the M53-2 version using its Mirage F1E testbeds starting in December 1974; this version produced in afterburner. The Mirage 2000 itself was powered by two versions of the M53—the M53-5, which equipped initial operational aircraft, was rated at of thrust with afterburner. The definitive version of the engine, the M53-P2, which equipped the majority of the type, is rated at in dry thrust and in afterburner.

===Payload and armaments===
The Mirage 2000 is equipped with built-in twin DEFA 554 autocannon (now GIAT 30–550 F4) 30 mm revolver-type cannons with 125 rounds each. The cannons have selectable fire rates of 1,200 or 1,800 rounds per minute.

===Differences between variants===
;Mirage 2000-5
The Mirage 2000-5 is a major advancement over previous variants and embodies a comprehensive electronic, sensor, and cockpit upgrade to expand its combat ability, while reducing pilot workload. The centrepiece of the Mirage 2000-5 overhaul is the Thomson-CSF RDY (radar Doppler multitarget) with look down/shoot down capability. The multifunction radar is capable of air-to-ground, air-to-air, and air-to-sea operations. In the air-to-ground mode, the RDY has navigation and attack functions that give it deep-strike and close-support capabilities. Capable of automatically locking onto multiple targets at first contact, the radar could detect flying targets travelling as low as . The introduction of the radar allows the aircraft to use the MICA missile, up to six of which could be fired simultaneously at targets due to the advances within the radar. Despite the increase in offensive capability, pilot workload is compensated for by the introduction of a multidisplay glass cockpit, based on the development of the Rafale. The aircraft has the ICMS Mk2 countermeasures suit, which contains three radar detectors and an infrared sensor that are linked to active jammers and chaff/flare dispensers.

Improvements over the Mirage 2000C included the Thales TV/CT CLDP laser designator pod and the multimode RDY, which allows detection of up to 24 targets and the ability to simultaneously track eight threats while guiding four MICA missiles to different targets. Updates to defensive systems included the ICMS 2 countermeasures suite and the Samir DDM missile warning system. ICMS 2 incorporates a receiver and associated signal processing system in the nose for detecting hostile missile-command data links, and can be interfaced to a new programmable mission-planning and postmission analysis ground system. Avionics were also updated, using a new night vision-compatible glass cockpit layout borrowed from the Dassault Rafale, a dual-linked wide-angle head-up display, and HOTAS controls. The Mirage 2000-5 can also carry the oversized drop tanks developed for the Mirage 2000N, greatly extending its range.

;Mirage 2000-5 Mk 2
Enhancements to offensive systems included a datalink for the targeting of MICA EM missiles, the addition of the Damocles forward-looking infrared (FLIR) targeting pod, and a newer, more stealthy Thales RDY-2 all-weather synthetic aperture radar with moving target indicator capability, which also grants the aircraft improved air-to-ground capability. The avionics were further updated with higher resolution color displays, an optional Topsight helmet-mounted display, and the addition of the modular data-processing unit designed for the Rafale. A new Thales Totem 3000 inertial navigation system with ring laser gyroscope and GPS capability were added, providing much greater accuracy, higher reliability, and shorter alignment time than the older ULISS 52 navigation system it replaced. Other upgrades included the addition of an onboard oxygen generation system for the pilot and an ICMS 3 digital countermeasures suite.

==Operational history==

===France===
The first aircraft entered service in July 1984. The first operational squadron was formed during the same year, the 50th anniversary of the French Air Force. About 124 Mirage 2000Cs were obtained by the &quot;AdA&quot;.

French Mirage 2000s were used during the Gulf War, where they flew high-altitude air defence for USAF U-2 spy aircraft, as well as in UN and NATO air operations during the Bosnian War and the Kosovo War. During Operation Deliberate Force, on 30 August 1995, one Mirage 2000D was shot down over Bosnia by a 9K38 Igla shoulder-launched missile fired by air defence units of the Army of Republika Srpska, prompting efforts to obtain improved defensive systems. Both crew members were captured and later released through mediation with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

French Mirage 2000Ds later served with the International Security Assistance Force during the conflict in Afghanistan in 2001–2002, operating in close conjunction with international forces and performing precision attacks with laser-guided bombs. In the summer of 2007, after the Dassault Rafale fighters had been removed from the theater of operations, three French Mirage 2000s were deployed to Afghanistan in support of NATO troops.

The Mirage 2000 is being replaced in French service by the Dassault Rafale, which became operational with the French Air Force in June 2006.

French Mirage 2000s were committed to enforcing the no-fly zone in Libya as part of Opération Harmattan in 2011.

On 14 April 2018, four French Mirage 2000-5Fs participated in a joint military operation against the Syrian government with the UK and U.S. during the Syrian Civil War. 

On 9 March 2024, two French Mirage 2000-5Fs participated in the downing of two Houthi drones over the Red Sea in support of Operation Prosperity Guardian marking the first French aerial victories since World War II. On 6 June 2024, French President Emmanuel Macron announced France would provide Mirage 2000 jets and training to Ukraine to counter increased Russian aggression in Kharkiv region.

===India===
In 1980, the Indian Air Force (IAF) learned of a successful approach by Pakistan to the US that year to purchase F-16A/B fighters, delivery of which was to commence in 1982. By late 1980, the IAF had quickly convinced the Indian government to purchase an equally potent aircraft, as its MiG-21s and MiG-23s were inferior to the F-16. When evaluating the Mirage F1 earlier, it became aware of a high-performance prototype of the Mirage 2000 in the flight-testing phase. No other aircraft of this potential was being offered for export. An internal assessment of the Mirage 2000 was carried out and the Indian government felt that the French plane was more advanced and a superior response to the F-16s that the US was to supply to Pakistan, and approached France for 150 Mirage 2000s. In October 1982, the country placed an order with Dassault for 36 single-seat Mirage 2000Hs and four twin-seat Mirage 2000THs (with &quot;H&quot; standing for &quot;Hindustan&quot;) with the possibility of a follow-on purchase of nine aircraft (eight single- and one twin-seater aircraft) as war, maintenance and attrition reserve. The purchase of 150 aircraft, could well have paved the way for joint production with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, but the number of aircraft ordered (40+9) was too small for such an arrangement. India nevertheless had the option to produce a number of Mirage 2000s under license that was later scrapped due to the country&#x27;s close relationship with the Soviet Union. This led to the induction of the MiG-29 instead, overriding reservations expressed by the IAF.

With the delivery of the first seven aircraft on 29 June 1985 to No. 7 Squadron, the Battleaxes, the Indian Air Force (IAF) became the first foreign user of the type, which it renamed the &quot;Vajra&quot; (, for Lightning, Thunderbolt). The service&#x27;s early aircraft were powered by Snecma M53-5 engines (so were designated Mirage 2000H5 and Mirage 2000TH5), which were quickly replaced by more powerful M53-P2 engines. The second unit to convert to the type was No. 1 Squadron (the Tigers), which was formally designated a Mirage 2000 unit in January 1986. Within 12 months of the first delivery, the IAF had received all 40 aircraft ordered. The follow-on order for nine aircraft was signed in 1986. Five aircraft were delivered by 1990, two more in 1992, and the last two aircraft were delivered in 1994. As such, full unit establishment was not achieved until 1990.

The Mirage 2000 fleet encountered other issues during its first decade of service, which were largely operational and maintenance-based. In 1995, the Indian government&#x27;s comptroller and auditor general reported delays in the construction of overhaul facilities and a shortage of spare parts, which had led to the fleet being unable to meet its required flying hours. India also purchased ATLIS II pods and several Matra Bombe Guidée Laser (BGL) Arcole 1,000 kg laser-guided penetrating bombs for the Mirage. The ATLIS II pods have an inherent limitation in that they are unusable at high altitudes. In its place, the IAF has bought a number of the cheaper US Paveway II laser-guided bomb kits for use with the Israeli Litening laser designator pods (LDPs), but certain parts of the Paveway kit were not available, as they were under US embargo. The aircraft were heavily modified in a short time frame to drop laser-guided bombs as well as conventional unguided bombs. Due to a lack of enemy air action, aircrew quickly became highly proficient in dropping dumb bombs. IAF Mirage 2000s have reportedly only used the Paveway LGB on eight occasions, mainly for the destruction of enemy command bunkers.

In 1999, when the Kargil War broke out, the IAF was asked to act jointly with ground troops on 25 May. The code name assigned to their role was Operation Safed Sagar and the Mirage 2000 flew its first sortie on 30 May. This multi-role aircraft, the most advanced in the IAF, performed remarkably well during the whole conflict in the high Himalayas, and was considered the game changer in the two-month war. During Operation Safed Sagar from May to July 1999, the two Mirage squadrons flew a total of 514 sorties with only three drop outs. No. 1 Squadron flew 274 air defence and strike escort missions, while No. 7 Squadron conducted 240 strike missions during which it dropped of ordnance.

During the 2001–02 India–Pakistan standoff, IAF Mirage 2000s were used to destroy Pakistani bunkers with precision-guided bombs.

The morale-boosting service of the Mirage 2000 in 1999 prompted the IAF to consider the acquisition of a further 126 aircraft. Instead, the Mirage 2000-5 became a contender for the IAF&#x27;s Indian MRCA competition in competition with the Mikoyan MiG-35, F-16 Fighting Falcon, and JAS 39 Gripen. In 2004, the Indian government approved purchase of 10 Mirage 2000Hs, featuring improved avionics, particularly an upgraded RDM 7 radar; they were delivered in 2007 for a total of 50 aircraft. Dassault replaced the Mirage 2000 with the newer Rafale as its contender due to the impending closure of the Mirage 2000 production line.
As India placed its third Mirage 2000 order, the government announced its intention to upgrade the existing fleet, as well. A period of protracted negotiations followed for the next several years, during which India and Dassault came close to signing a contract several times.

In July 2011, India approved a $2.2 billion upgrade package for its Mirage 2000s. Valued at $43 million per aircraft, it upgrades the fleet to Mirage 2000-5 Mk. 2 standards, with provisions made for the use of a night vision-capable glass cockpit, upgraded navigation and IFF systems, an advanced multimode multilayered radar, and a fully integrated electronic warfare suite, among other updates. In addition, the inventory of Super 530D and R.550 Magic II missiles would be replaced by MICAs, an order for which was placed in 2012. The first of the two IAF Mirages sent to France to be upgraded made its first flight in October 2013, marking the start of a test campaign that would encompass 250 flights, culminating in the handover of the first aircraft in March 2015. The single-seat version was redesignated &quot;Mirage 2000I&quot; and the twin-seat version &quot;Mirage 2000TI&quot;.
On 26 February 2019, 12 Mirage 2000s were used to strike an alleged Jaish-e-Mohammed training camp in Balakot, Pakistan. This engagement was the first time since the 1971 war that IAF fighters had entered Pakistani airspace. All aircraft were armed with one Israeli Spice 2000 (one-tonne) bomb.

The next day, IAF Mirage 2000Is, Su-30MKIs, and MiG-21s were used against Pakistan Air Force JF-17s, Mirage IIIs, and F-16s, whose aim was to target Indian Army ammunition dumps and other infrastructure near Srinagar, Poonch and Jammu area, according to Indian government officials. However, Pakistani officials say that air strikes in India by Pakistan Air Force jets were meant to demonstrate Pakistan&#x27;s capability and Pakistani jets were ordered to drop their bombs in open space to avoid any human or collateral damage. This led to a dogfight and a confirmed shootdown of an IAF MiG-21. Pakistan also claims that an additional IAF Su-30MKI was also shot down in this dogfight. However, India denies the loss of any of its Su-30MKIs and instead claims that a PAF F-16 was shot down in the dogfight by its Mig-21. Pakistan also denies the loss of any of its F-16 in the battle. The only confirmed losses of the engagement were that of the MiG-21 and an IAF Mil Mi-17 helicopter shot down by friendly fire.

During the 2020 China-India standoff, India deployed Mirage 2000Is along the Line of Actual Control, particularly after the Galwan Valley skirmish near Pangong Tso in the Ladakh region.

In September 2021, France agreed to sell some of its retired Mirage 2000 airframes to India, at a price of €1 million per plane. Out of the 24 fighters to be bought, 13 are in complete condition with intact engines and airframes, and eight of these shall fly after servicing. The remaining 11 fighters are partially complete but with fuel tanks and ejection seats, which will be scavenged to secure parts for the IAF&#x27;s two existing Mirage squadrons.

===Peru===
In December 1982, Peru placed an $800 million order for 14 single-seat Mirage 2000Ps and two two-seat Mirage 2000DP trainers, with an option for eight and two more aircraft, respectively. Although the contract was signed in 1985, the Peruvian government, due to the country&#x27;s financial issues, renegotiated the number of aircraft to be reduced to 10 single-seaters and two two-seaters. Handover of the first aircraft occurred in June 1985, although the first deliveries to Peru were not made until December 1986, after the initial training of pilots in France had been completed.

The Peruvian Air Force ordered a set of munitions similar to that ordered by Egypt, along with ATLIS II targeting pods. The Peruvian Mirages flew combat air patrol missions in 1995 during the Cenepa War.
Peru&#x27;s Mirage 2000s underwent an inspection and partial electronic modernisation programme following a $140 million deal in 2009 that involved Dassault, Snecma, and Thales. The aircraft are expected to be retired by 2025.

===United Arab Emirates===
In May 1983, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) placed an order for 36 Mirage 2000 aircraft. The order consisted of 22 single-seat Mirage 2000AED, eight unique single-seat reconnaissance variants designated Mirage 2000RAD, and six Mirage 2000DAD trainers, which collectively are known as SAD-8 (Standard Abu Dhabi). The order specified an Italian-made defensive avionics suite that delayed delivery of the first of these aircraft until 1989.
In November 1998, the UAE signed a $3.2 billion contract that consisted of an order for 30 Mirage 2000-9s, as well as the deal to upgrade 33 of the surviving SAD-8 aircraft up the new standard. The contract was later amended so it would encompass 32 new-built aircraft—20 single-seater Mirage 2000-9s and 12 two-seater 2000-9Ds—and 30 upgrade kits for original aircraft. The aircraft were equipped with a classified countermeasures system designated IMEWS. Although deliveries were scheduled for 2001, the first aircraft arrived in the spring of 2003.

The UAE&#x27;s Mirage 2000-9s are equipped for the strike mission, with the Shehab laser targeting pod (a variant of the Damocles) and the Nahar navigation pod, complementing the air-to-ground modes of the RDY-2 radar. They are also equipped with a classified countermeasures system designated IMEWS, which is comparable to the ICMS 3. Emirati Mirage 2000s are armed with weapons such as the PGM 500 guided bomb and the &quot;Black Shaheen&quot; cruise missile, which is basically a variant of the MBDA Apache cruise missile. All 30 survivors of this first batch have been extensively refurbished and upgraded, bringing them to the same standard as the Mirage 2000-9.

UAE Mirage 2000s flew in the Gulf War of 1991, but had little action. Six Mirage 2000s were to participate in the enforcement of the no-fly zone over Libya.

As part of the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen on 14 March 2016, a UAE Mirage 2000-9D crashed in the southern Yemeni city of Aden during a combat operation in the early morning hours, killing its two pilots. The Arab coalition claims the Mirage crashed due to a technical fault. Other sources reported that the Mirage 2000-9D was shot down by Yemeni Al-Qaeda militants using a Strela-2 MANPADS while flying low.

On 2 July 2019, during the 2019–20 Western Libya campaign, an airstrike hit the Tajoura Detention Center outside Tripoli, Libya, which was being used as a holding facility for migrants and refugees trying to reach Europe, was struck from the air. A storage hangar being used as a residential facility was destroyed by the attack, killing at least 53 people and wounding 130. The Libyan Government of National Accord (GNA) initially claimed that the airstrike was conducted by the Libyan National Army (LNA), but later attributed the attack to a UAE aircraft. A January 2020 report by the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) stated that the strike was likely to have been carried out with a guided bomb fired from a non-Libyan aircraft, again suggesting that a foreign Mirage 2000 had been used.

===Greece===
In July 1985, Greece signed a contract for 40 Mirage 2000s comprising 36 single-seat aircraft and 4 two-seat trainers. The order came as part of a larger defence acquisition programme that saw the country, for political reasons, proceed with an order for the F-16. The $1.38 billion Mirage contract also consisted of weapons and equipment, as well as industrial offsets that permitted HAI to produce the M53-P2 engines. The first aircraft were delivered in June 1988 and the last, by the end of 1989. They featured an &quot;ICMS Mk. 1&quot; defensive countermeasures suite (DCS), an updated version of the standard Mirage 2000C DCS, characterised by two small antennas near the top of the tailfin. Initially armed with R.550 Matra Magic-2 missiles. During the &quot;Talos&quot; modernisation project of the 1990s, carried out by Hellenic Aerospace Industry and supervised by Dassault and Thompson-CSF, the aircraft received: a vastly improved RDM-3 radar set; the ICMS 1 DCS; the ability to carry the Super-530D medium-range missile and the AM39 Exocet Block II anti-ship missile. After &quot;Talos&quot;, the aircraft were renamed Mirage-2000EGM/BGM.

In August 2000, Greece placed a $1.1 billion order for a batch of 15 new Mirage 2000-5 Mk. 2 fighters, and had 10 existing Mirage 2000EGMs upgraded to Mirage 2000-5 Mk. 2 standard. The upgrade meant the addition of the RDY-2 radar and ICMS-3 DCS, and the ability to deploy SCALP cruise missiles and both versions of the MICA instead, an order for which was placed. All Greek machines (Mk 2s and EGMs) feature the TOTEM-3000 INS of the Mk2 instead of the Uliss-52 and have hose-and-drogue aerial refueling capability.

On 8 October 1996, seven months after the escalation of the dispute with Turkey over the Imia/Kardak islands, a Turkish F-16D jet crashed into the Aegean Sea after interception by Greek Mirages. The Turkish pilot died, while the co-pilot ejected and was rescued by Greek forces. In August 2012, after the downing of a RF-4E on the Syrian coast, Turkish Defence Minister İsmet Yılmaz claimed that the Turkish F-16D was shot down in 1996 by a Greek Mirage 2000 with an R.550 Magic II near Chios island. Greece denies that the F-16 was shot down. Both Mirage 2000 pilots reported that the F-16 caught fire and that they saw one parachute.

On 12 April 2018, a Greek Mirage 2000-5, part of a two-ship formation, crashed into the Aegean Sea north of the Skyros air base after being scrambled to intercept two Turkish F-16s that were in the disputed airspace. When the Mirage pair arrived in the area, the Turkish jets had already left. The Greek pilot died in the crash, which was attributed to Saharan dust in the air; both Mirage pilots were flying low in poor visibility.

===Taiwan===

In response to mainland China&#x27;s purchase of the Su-27, the Republic of China (Taiwan) began talks with the US and France about the possible purchase of new fighters. While the US opposed Taiwan&#x27;s acquisition of the Mirage 2000 and instead pressured it to procure the F-16, the Republic of China Air Force became the first customer for the Mirage 2000-5 in November 1992. The order for 48 single-seat Mirage 2000-5EIs and 12 Mirage 2000-5DI trainers was condemned by China. The order also included 480 Magic short-range air-to-air missiles, 960 MICA intermediate-range air-to-air missiles, auxiliary fuel tanks, ground support equipment, and monitoring equipment; total costs amounted to US$4.9 billion, of which $2.6 billion was for the aircraft. The MICA missile provides the Mirage with a degree of BVR capability needed for its role as front-line interceptor. In addition, a set of ASTAC electronic intelligence (ELINT) pods was ordered. A number of centerline twin gun pods with DEFA 554 cannons were also acquired and fitted on the two-seaters, as they do not have an internal gun armament.

Taiwanese Mirage 2000s were delivered from May 1997 to November 1998, and are based at Hsinchu AB. The RoCAF&#x27;s Mirages have suffered from low operational readiness and high maintenance costs; the harsh environment and high operational tempo have caused higher than expected wear and tear. After cracks were detected in the blades of the aircraft&#x27;s engines in 2009, Dassault worked with Taiwanese authorities to successfully rectify the issue and provided compensation for the engine damage. By the following year, normal training hours of 15 per month had resumed and the fleet&#x27;s operational readiness had been restored, after having reportedly dropped to 6 hours per month because of the engine troubles. There were also considerations of mothballing the entire Mirage fleet because of its high maintenance costs. Although the aircraft&#x27;s maintenance costs more than that of the AIDC F-CK-1 Ching-kuo and the Lockheed F-16 Fighting Falcon, the fleet was reportedly still being flown. Yet plans to upgrade the fleet have not been executed, since the upgrade is cost prohibitive.
===Qatar===
In 1994, Qatar became the second export customer for the Mirage 2000-5 as it ordered twelve aircraft to replace its Mirage F1EDAs. Designated Mirage 2000-5DAs, the aircraft ordered consisted of nine single-seaters (5EDA) and three two-seaters (5DDA), and the first delivery was made in September 1997. Qatar also purchased the MICA missile and the Apache stand-off cruise missile. The aircraft would be used sparingly, and by the mid-2000s, under pressure from the US to dispose of the aircraft and with most of the aircraft&#x27;s operational life still intact, Qatar offered to sell the aircraft to Pakistan and later India. Such a deal would not materialise.
In March 2011, Mirage 2000s were deployed to an airbase on the Greek island of Crete as part of Qatar&#x27;s commitment to assist in the NATO-enforced no-fly zone over Libya. The aircraft would soon jointly enforce the no-fly zone along with French Mirage 2000-5 aircraft.

===Brazil===
Dassault participated in a competition to replace the Brazilian Air Force&#x27;s aging Mirage IIIEBR/DBRs with a Brazilian-specific version of the Mirage 2000-9 that would have been developed in collaboration with Embraer designated Mirage 2000BR. However, due to Brazilian fiscal problems, the competition dragged on for years until it was suspended in February 2005. Instead, Brazil in July 2005 purchased 12 ex-French Air Force Mirage 2000 aircraft (ten &quot;C&quot; and two &quot;B&quot; versions), designated F-2000, for $72 million. Deliveries began in September 2006 and concluded on 27 August 2008 with the delivery of the last 2 aircraft. According to Journal of Electronic Defense, the figure was $200 million, which consisted of a significant number of Magic 2 air-to-air missiles, and the &quot;AdA&quot; would provide full conversion training in France and full logistical support. The ten single-seat fighters and two twin-seat combat-trainers were drawn from operational squadrons Escadron de Chasse 1/5 and 2/5, based at Orange AB, respectively. The first delivery was made September 2006 to 1º Grupo de Defesa Aérea (1º GDA – 1st Air Defence Group) based at Annapolis. They were primarily used in the air-defence role and were equipped with Matra Super 530D and Matra Magic 2. Brazil officially retired its fleet in December 2013, just before the maintenance contract with Dassault concluded.

=== Cancelled plans ===
Indonesia has considered in acquiring used Mirage 2000s for the Indonesian Air Force. 12 Mirage 2000-5s from Qatar is reportedly chosen by Indonesia. In November 2022, the Ministry of Finance of Indonesia approved foreign loans to fund several Indonesian Air Force procurement programs, including the ex-Qatari Mirage 2000s proposal. In June 2023, an Indonesian Ministry of Defence official confirmed a contract was signed with Czech company Excalibur International, acting as the provider for the aircraft, earlier this year to procure Qatar&#x27;s fleet of Mirage 2000 aircraft. In January 2024, the Indonesian Ministry of Defense reported that the deal is temporarily put on hold. On 9 February 2024, spokesperson for the Minister of Defence confirmed the plan to acquire Mirages have been cancelled.

=== Ukraine ===
Following the Russian Invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Ukraine had expressed interest in the Mirage 2000, and it was reported in March 2023 that France has been training Ukrainian pilots on this aircraft in anticipation that some may be sent to Ukraine. French President Emmanuel Macron announced during a televised interview on 6 June 2024 that an unspecified number of Mirage 2000-5s are to be delivered to Ukraine.

<text>Walsingham () is a civil parish in North Norfolk, England, famous for its religious shrines in honour of Mary, mother of Jesus. It also contains the ruins of two medieval monastic houses. Walsingham is northwest of Norwich.

The civil parish includes Little Walsingham and Great Walsingham, together with Egmere (a depopulated medieval village at ), and has an area of 18.98 km2. At the 2011 census, it had a population of 819.

Walsingham is a major centre of pilgrimage. In 1061, according to the Walsingham legend, an Anglo-Saxon noblewoman, Richeldis de Faverches, had a vision of the Virgin Mary in which she was instructed to build a replica of the house of the Holy Family in Nazareth in honour of the Annunciation. When it was built, the Holy House in Walsingham was panelled with wood and contained a wooden statue of an enthroned Virgin Mary with the child Jesus seated on her lap. Among its relics was a phial reputedly of the Virgin&#x27;s milk. Walsingham became one of northern Europe&#x27;s great places of pilgrimage and remained so through the remainder of the Middle Ages, with a revival in the 20th century.

==Name==
The village&#x27;s name means &#x27;Homestead/village of Wæls&#x27; people/the Wælsings&#x27;, a family known in Old Norse as the Vǫlsungar.

==Priory==

A priory of Canons Regular was established on the site in 1153, a few miles from the sea in the northern part of Norfolk and it grew in importance over the following centuries. Founded in the time of Edward the Confessor, the Chapel of Our Lady of Walsingham was confirmed to the Augustinian Canons a century later and enclosed the priory. From the first, the shrine was a famous place of pilgrimage and the faithful came from all parts of England and the Continent until the destruction of the priory under King Henry VIII in 1538. To this day the main road of the pilgrims through Newmarket, Brandon and Fakenham is still called the Palmers&#x27; (Pilgrims&#x27;) Way.

In 1537 while the last Prior, Richard Vowell, was paying obsequious respect to Thomas Cromwell, the Sub-Prior, Nicholas Mileham, was charged with conspiring to rebel against the suppression of the lesser monasteries and, on flimsy evidence, was convicted of high treason and hanged outside the Priory walls. Eleven people in all, including two lay choristers who had been instrumental in organising the revolt were hanged, drawn and quartered. 

In the July Prior Vowell assented to the destruction of Walsingham Priory and assisted the king&#x27;s commissioners in the removal of the figure of Our Lady and many of the gold and silver ornaments and in the general spoliation of the shrine. For his ready compliance the Prior received a pension of 100 pounds a year, a large sum in those days, while 15 of the canons received pensions varying from four to six pounds. With the shrine dismantled and the priory destroyed, the site was sold by order of Henry VIII to Thomas Sidney for 90 pounds and a private mansion was subsequently erected on the spot. Gold and silver from the shrine was taken to London along with the statue of Mary and Jesus which was later burnt.

The fall of the monastery gave rise to the anonymous Elizabethan ballad, &quot;The Walsingham Lament&quot;, on what the Norfolk people felt at the loss of their Shrine of Our Lady of Walsingham. The ballad includes the lines:

:&quot;Weep, weep, O Walsingham,&quot;
:&quot;Whose days are nights,&quot;
:&quot;Blessings turned to blasphemies,&quot;
:&quot;Holy deeds to despites.&quot;

:&quot;Sin is where our Ladye sat,&quot;
:&quot;Heaven turned is to hell;&quot;
:&quot;Satan sits where Our Lord did sway,&quot;
:&quot;Walsingham, O farewell!&quot;

==20th century revival==
By a rescript of 6 February 1897, Pope Leo XIII blessed a new statue for the restored ancient sanctuary of Our Lady of Walsingham. This was sent from Rome and placed in the Holy House Chapel at the newly built Roman Catholic parish church of King&#x27;s Lynn (the village of Walsingham was within the parish) on 19 August 1897 and on the following day the first post-Reformation pilgrimage took place to the Slipper Chapel at Walsingham, which was purchased by Charlotte Boyd(e) in 1895 and restored for Catholic use. Hundreds of Catholics attended the pilgrimage and committed themselves to an annual pilgrimage (from 1897 to 1934 on Whitsun) to commemorate this event. The Guild of Our Lady of Ransom were instrumental in the revival of the Walsingham pilgrimage, as the Guild&#x27;s leader Father Fletcher had experience of organising large-scale pilgrimages of this kind all over England and Wales. Archives are kept at King&#x27;s Lynn and Walsingham.

In 1900, a caretaker was placed in the Priest&#x27;s House at the Slipper Chapel (said to have been built in 1338); to facilitate its use by Catholic pilgrims, under the custody of the monks at Downside Abbey. Both Father Wrigglesworth (the Catholic parish priest of King&#x27;s Lynn and Walsingham) and Father Fletcher (Founder and Master of the Guild of Ransom) laid the foundations and left others to declare the Catholic National Shrine at the Slipper Chapel on 19 August 1934 with over 10,000 pilgrims present. Attempts to purchase the abbey site were unsuccessful (even though one of the Lee-Warners became a Catholic in 1899); however in 1961 the site of the original Holy House within the priory ruins was excavated by members of the Royal Archaeological Institute.

As a result of the initiative of the Anglican vicar of Walsingham (from 1921), Father Alfred Hope Patten, an Anglican Marian shrine has been established in Walsingham. First established in the parish church of St Mary and All Saints in 1922, the image of Our Lady was translated to a purpose-built building in 1931 and pilgrimages are now held through the summer months.

The Anglican National Pilgrimage takes place on the Late Spring Bank Holiday (the last Monday in May) and is regularly met by Protestant picket lines. The Student Cross pilgrimage on Good Friday visits both the Anglican and Catholic shrines and the National Youth Pilgrimage is in the first week of August, also visiting the Anglican shrine.

The Catholic shrine continues to be based at the Slipper Chapel, near the hamlet of Houghton St Giles. Many significant occasions have been celebrated here, including the Pilgrimage of Catholic Youth (1938), the Cross Carrying Pilgrimages (since 1948), and the Crowning of Our Lady (Marian year 1954 and 1988). On 22 May 1982, the statue of Our Lady of Walsingham was taken to Pope John Paul II at the Wembley Mass and given a place of honour during his British visit. In 2000, a new Feast of Our Lady of Walsingham was approved by the hierarchy, to be celebrated in England and Wales on 24 September.

Ecumenical opportunities have been seen in Walsingham, and there is an interaction between the two shrines. In the Anglican shrine there has long-been established a small Orthodox chapel. The Orthodox have furthered their presence at the Church of the Holy Transfiguration, formerly the Methodist chapel at Great Walsingham, and also at the former Walsingham railway station which has been converted into the church of St Seraphim.

Little Sisters of Jesus have a community of sisters in Little Walsingham since the late 1960s. There is currently also a community of Carmelites in the village.

==Geography==

The village is the result of a conjoining of two ancient settlements, Great Walsingham and Little Walsingham.

A 19th century gazetteer describes Little Walsingham as a small town, known simply as Walsingham and which had also been known as New Walsingham, and Great Walsingham as a smaller, separate village which had also been known as Old Walsingham. A market once held on Tuesdays had already become defunct by 1845, whilst the Friday market was already &quot;small&quot; in 1845 and had ceased by 1883.

The River Stiffkey flows through the parish, from south to north, passing to the east of bulk of the village. The centre of Little Walsingham is at an elevation of around and lies within the Stiffkey valley, with the land rising to the east and west — to the west it rises to around at Egmere. National Cycle Route 1 passes through the village.

The former North Creake airfield lies within the parish, just north of Egmere, together with the area known as Bunker&#x27;s Hill, which is a commercial/industrial area following the disuse as an airfield.

==Governance==
There is a parish council, which meets at the Village Hall. The parish is divided into Great and Little wards, which reflect the two former civil parishes that have merged.

A ward exists, for the purpose of electing a councillor to North Norfolk District Council (one of 40), called Walsingham. The current councillor is Tom FitzPatrick, with the most recent election in 2019.

The ward had a population of 2,167 in 2011. Since 2019 boundary changes, the ward comprises the parishes of Barsham, Great Snoring, Little Snoring, Sculthorpe and Walsingham.

From 1894 to 1974 Walsingham Rural District existed, though the council was based in Fakenham.

&quot;The Shirehall&quot; on Common Place served as a courtroom until 1974. In present times the building is open as a museum, and belongs to the Walsingham Estate. The village has another museum building: the former House of Correction, or &quot;The Bridewell&quot;.

Egmere and Quarles were merged into the civil parish of Great Walsingham in 1935, but Quarles then transferred to Holkham in 1947.

In ecclesiastic respects, Walsingham falls within the Church of England diocese of Norwich and the Roman Catholic Diocese of East Anglia.

==Transport==
===Wells and Walsingham Light Railway===


Walsingham used to be connected to the national railway network, being on the Wymondham to Wells Branch line, but this was closed during the Beeching Axe in stages from 1964 to 1969.

In 1979 work began on constructing a gauge heritage railway on the old track bed to Wells. The line re-opened in 1982 and now operates with a fleet of steam and diesel scale locomotives.

A new station was constructed in Walsingham. The Walsingham railway station building (with platform still intact and visible) is now Saint Seraphim&#x27;s Orthodox church.

===Public transport===
A regular bus service is provided as Walsingham is on the &quot;Coastliner&quot; bus route (service number 36) with destinations including Fakenham, Wells, Hunstanton and King&#x27;s Lynn.

<text>Anton Behme Burg (October 18, 1904 – November 18, 2003) was an American chemist and high jumper. He was chairman of the University of Southern California chemistry department and an expert on boron.

Burg joined USC in 1939 as an assistant professor. He built up USC&#x27;s chemistry department, making it one of the best chemistry departments in the United States by the 1950s. He recruited Sidney Benson, Jerry Donohue, and Arthur Adamson as faculty. Burg retired in 1974.

During his time with Morris S. Kharasch at the University of Chicago, he worked with Herbert C. Brown, who won a Nobel Prize for his work following up on Burg&#x27;s research.

Burg was also an accomplished high jumper, and he was the 1927 NCAA outdoor high jump champion. He was also national champion at the 1931 USA Indoor Track and Field Championships.

<doc id="381538" wikidata="Q2007835" url="?curid=381538" title="OODA loop">
<text>The OODA loop (observe, orient, decide, act) is a decision-making model developed by United States Air Force Colonel John Boyd. He applied the concept to the combat operations process, often at the operational level during military campaigns. It is often applied to understand commercial operations and learning processes. The approach explains how agility can overcome raw power in dealing with human opponents.

==The OODA loop==
As can be seen from the diagram, the OODA loop includes continuous collection of feedback and observations. This enables late commitment, which is an important element of agility. This is in contrast to the PDCA cycle which requires early commitment (the first steps are Plan and Do).

==Use in law and business==
The OODA loop has become an important concept in litigation, business, law enforcement, management education, military strategy and cyber security, and cyberwarfare. According to Boyd, decision-making occurs in an iterative cycle of &quot;observe, orient, decide, act&quot;. An entity (whether an individual or an organization) that can process this cycle quickly, observing and reacting to unfolding events more rapidly and/or more effectively than an opponent, can thereby get inside the opponent&#x27;s decision cycle and gain the advantage.

Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, has said he uses the OODA loop in scenario evaluation.

==Criticism==
Some scholars are critical of the concept. Aviation historian Michael Hankins, for example, writes that &quot;the OODA loop is vague enough that its defenders and attackers can each see what they want to see in it. For some, the OODA concept’s flexibility is its strength, but for others it becomes so generalized as to lose its usefulness.&quot; He concludes that &quot;The OODA loop is merely one way among a myriad of ways of describing intuitive processes of learning and decision making that most people experience daily. It is not incorrect, but neither is it unique or especially profound.&quot;

<doc id="381539" wikidata="Q7067212" url="?curid=381539" title="Blockbusters (British game show)">
<text>Blockbusters is a British television quiz show based upon an American quiz show of the same name. A solo player and a team of two answer trivia questions, clued up with an initial letter of the answer, to complete a path across or down a game board of hexagons.

The programme premiered on 29 August 1983 on ITV and ran for ten series, ending on 19 May 1993. It has since been revived for four additional series, the most recent of which was a comedy version hosted by Dara Ó Briain, which aired on Comedy Central from 21 March to 5 December 2019.

==Background==
&quot;Blockbusters&quot; was created by Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions and originated as an American series in 1980. The UK version was created after Central Independent Television producer Graham C. Williams spotted the show in 1981 and produced a pilot in 1982. The difference was that instead of adults, who appeared on the American edition, the UK edition was produced for sixth formers.

Bob Holness was the original presenter staying on for the first ten series of the first incarnation and a 1994 revival on Sky One. Holness commented in 1988: &quot;When Central TV were looking for someone to host &quot;Blockbusters&quot; I was thought of. It was remembered that I&#x27;d done TV programmes of much the same sort, such as &quot;Junior Criss Cross Quiz&quot; which I compered in the 1960s and which was also a question and answer show. One led to the other.&quot; A 1997 edition featuring adults was produced for one series on BBC Two with Michael Aspel presenting. Sky One brought &quot;Blockbusters&quot; back under its original rules in 2000 with Liza Tarbuck at the helm. The Challenge series was presented by Simon Mayo, and the Comedy Central series was presented by Dara Ó Briain.

Contestants were allowed to do a hand jive during the end credits of the Friday episode of each broadcast week. The hand jive first appeared in 1986 after one of the contestants was bored while sitting through filming several shows a day waiting for his turn. It lasted for the rest of the original series&#x27; run. The hand-clapping sequence was referenced by Half Man Half Biscuit in their 1991 song &quot;Hedley Verityesque&quot;.

The original game board was powered using 40 slide projectors, each with its own set of slides for the different Letters and Gold Run questions, and took up the entire height of the studio. Slides were preloaded onto carousels with enough slides for about 3 – 5 shows. Carousels took about 30 minutes to change over. There were 15 different board combinations (5 sets X 3 games per match) which meant the same letter combinations would reappear. The letter &#x27;Q&#x27; was only on one board, the letter &#x27;Y&#x27; on two boards. All 15 boards followed in the same sequence; if the same player/team won a match with victories in the first two games, the third one was skipped and the projectors were advanced directly to the Gold Run.

In 1987 and 1988, readers of &quot;TVTimes&quot; voted the series the most popular quiz show on television.

===Theme music===
The original theme music was written by Ed Welch, who also updated the music for the second Sky series in 2001. The first Sky series kept the same opening titles used from 1987 on the original ITV run (as it continued to be produced by Central). The original theme in C major was an upbeat pop track incorporating piano, strings, drum machine, and various other 1980s synthesized sounds reminiscent of the day – the four-note opening motif of Beethoven&#x27;s 5th Symphony is mixed into the theme at the precise moment the composer&#x27;s head appears on a flipping hexagon in the 1983 opening sequence (this sequence was replaced in 1987, see below).

The BBC version in 1997 used a piece of music written by Henry Marsh and Paul Boross. Rage Music created the version used by Challenge, which is an updated version of the original theme, primarily using an electric guitar. Marc Sylvan and Richard Jacques updated the original theme for the Comedy Central version.

===Title sequences===
The original 1983–87 title sequence featured flipping hexagons with various images on them running down an encyclopedia page. The title sequence used from 1987 to 1993 is a city, paying homage to science-fiction films such as &quot;Metropolis&quot; (1927) and &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (1982). In the 1994 Sky series, the opening titles were cut short, not featuring the hexagons flying over the studio like the 1987–93 titles.

The title sequence used in the 1997 series with a completely different theme tune (although as mentioned above, it might have been similar to the original theme but with several notes swapped around) featured a golden head with hexagons showing clips. The title sequence used in 2000–01 featured people throwing and catching the letters that spell &quot;Blockbusters&quot; using the Ed Welch theme again.

The 2012 title sequence featured references to all previous title sequences, mainly hexagons – but also with more subtle features like the golden head (as seen in the 1997 BBC version), the planet Earth and a city-like structure as seen in the popularised 1987–95 versions. The 2019 title sequence featured hexagon outlines on a hexagon landscape.

==Main game==
 Like the 1980 U.S. version, a solo player competed against a pair of contestants. The game board consisted of 20 interlocking yellow hexagons, arranged in five columns of four. Each hexagon contained a letter of the alphabet (except X and Z, although letter Z appeared occasionally during the Gold Run). A contestant would choose one of the letters and would be asked a general-knowledge trivia question whose correct answer began with the chosen letter. (A typical question might be, &quot;What &#x27;P&#x27; is a musical instrument with 88 keys?&quot; The answer would be a piano.) The phrasing that contestants would use to ask for a letter has entered the language and is frequently heard to this day. It is also the source of a pun – &quot;Can I have a &#x27;P&#x27; please, Bob?&quot;; &#x27;having a pee&#x27; being slang for urinating.

The game board is designed in such a way that a tied game was not a possible finishing result. Even if all 20 hexagons were filled (which did occur at least twice, once in the first series, and once in the first Sky version) there would always be a winner.

The game began with a toss-up question to play for control of the board, starting with a letter that was chosen at random. The teams or players could buzz in during the middle of reading a question. If a player or team got the correct answer, they gained control of that hexagon and were given the chance to choose another one. If the contestant answered incorrectly, the opposing team or player was given a chance to answer it after the host re-read the question. If nobody answered it correctly, the host asked another question whose answer began with that same letter. Each correct answer won £5. In the case of the two-player team, &quot;each&quot; player won whatever money the team accumulated.

The solo player attempted to complete a vertical connection of white hexagons from the top of the board to the bottom; that required at least four correct answers. The pair attempted to connect a path from left to right with blue hexagons (purple during the Aspel era), requiring at least five spaces. The first side to connect their path won the game. The first player or team to win two games won the match. When either party was one correct answer away from completing their path, the hexagons forming their path would flash to indicate this. If both were one correct answer away, all lit hexagons on the board would flash, indicating that the situation was effectively &quot;Blockbusters either way&quot; (later referred to as a &quot;mutual space&quot; on the board), and the next player to give a correct answer would win the game unless the contestant chose a panel which would not give them the win, which was sometimes used as a safety tactic to avoid handing the initiative to the opponent in case they gave the wrong answer.

All players received a &quot;Blockbusters&quot; Concise Oxford Dictionary and sweatshirt in the original ITV series. By 1985, the &quot;Blockbusters&quot; computer game was added. Within a year, the sweatshirt had been replaced by a &quot;Blockbusters&quot; branded cardigan in a choice of colours and a &quot;Blockbusters&quot; embossed filofax accompanied the dictionary (replaced by an electronic organizer by 1988). In the first Sky One series in 1994, it was a Blockbusters Encyclopedia and T-shirt. In the BBC Two 1997 series, it was a fountain pen. In the second Sky One series, it was a &quot;Blockbusters&quot; Dictionary and a Britannica CD-ROM. In the Challenge series, it was an Elonex E-book reader. In the Comedy Central series, it was a &quot;Blockbusters&quot;-branded hoodie and &quot;reusable cup&quot;.

===Gold Run===
The winner of the match went on to play the Gold Run bonus round; if the pair won, only one player on the team could play, with the turns alternating at each Gold Run. The board consisted of a pattern of green hexagons similar to that of the main game, but the hexagons had 2 to 4 letters inside them; those letters were the initials of the correct answer. (For instance, if a contestant chose &quot;BS&quot; and the host said &quot;Where people kiss in Ireland&quot;, the correct answer would be &quot;Blarney Stone.&quot;) When the contestant guessed correctly, the hexagon turned gold. However, if the contestant passed, it turned black, blocking the player&#x27;s path; it was then up to the contestant to work around it. The object was to horizontally connect the left and right sides of the board within 60 seconds (or before blocking off all possible horizontal connections).

If the players were successful they won a special prize. If the Gold Run was not won, each correct answer paid £10. Defending champions could keep going for up to five matches undefeated, in order to win an even bigger prize. From the seventh ITV series, it was reduced to three, so that more contestants could take part over the course of a series. In the first Sky One series this was changed back up to five matches and reduced to three again on BBC Two. In the second Sky One series, it increased to five again. For the Challenge series, the maximum amount remained at five matches.

A famous short piece of music (three sharp notes on a synth-like horn in a slapstick style) was played if a contestant ran out of time on a Gold Run, often producing amused reactions in the studio; the same three notes played on an electric guitar act as the time&#x27;s-up buzzer on the Challenge version.

===Champion Blockbusters===
Four series of &quot;Champion Blockbusters&quot; were made from 1987 to 1990, in which gold-run winners were invited to return to battle against other gold-run winners.

==Other versions==

===Sky One===
In 1994, Sky One created a new series with original host, Bob Holness. It was produced by Central, which had made the programme since 1983, and sponsored by Thomas Cook. This series featured a bonus question for any player who chose a particular letter and correctly answered that question, thereby earning the right to answer a £5 follow-up question. Sky One brought the series back again in 2000, this time produced by Grundy (which owned the format) and presented by Liza Tarbuck, but it did not capture the same degree of popularity as the Holness incarnation. The format stayed the same in both versions, and both versions involved sixth formers.

===BBC Two===
BBC Two used adult contestants, instead of sixth formers. This version was broadcast in 1997 and presented by Michael Aspel; the show stayed with the same format. Famous contestants included Stephen Merchant.

This is the only version to use purple hexagons; all other versions still used blue to represent the pair of players. The solo player still played white hexagons. The Gold Run used a blue background in this version and the Liza Tarbuck version.

Champions in the Aspel era were limited to three wins before retiring undefeated.

===Gameshow Marathon===
On 14 April 2007 at 20:40, Vernon Kay hosted a networked edition of &quot;Gameshow Marathon&quot; on ITV1 in which celebrity contestants revived the classic 1980s Holness version of the show. It also featured an edited version of the show&#x27;s opening titles.

===Challenge===

It was announced on 10 November 2011 that game show channel Challenge would revive the show in 2012, under the name &quot;&quot;All New Blockbusters&quot;, with adult contestants rather than students. Forty episodes were recorded from 9 to 19 February 2012 with Simon Mayo hosting the show.

The series started airing on 14 May 2012, with the first episode dedicated to the memory of original host Bob Holness, who died on 6 January 2012. The series also featured contestant Claire Scott who made her third appearance on &quot;Blockbusters&quot;.

The show aired at 20:00 every weekday with an omnibus showing split over Saturday and Sunday mornings, plus a repeat showing of the previous night&#x27;s episode at 17:00. The series was put on hold for a few weeks and resumed transmission on 9 July 2012, starting with a celebrity special featuring Konnie Huq (who had previously been on the original &quot;Blockbusters&quot;) amongst others. During the break, the first 20 episodes were repeated, with the &quot;All New&quot;&quot; removed from the title. Subsequent repeats also removed the &quot;All New&quot; prefix.

===Comedy Central===
On 22 October 2018, it was reported that &quot;Blockbusters&quot; would return once again. Produced by Thames TV with the same format. It was announced on 3 December 2018 that Dara Ó Briain would host the revived version for Comedy Central. Twenty new episodes, broadcast over two series, were recorded in the winter of 2018 and included two celebrity specials. The first episode aired on 21 March 2019.

The format has been changed so that each episode is a standalone contest between a complete panel of three contestants. The prize money has been increased from earlier incarnations to £20 per correct answer in the main game (£100 for the celebrity edition) and £50 per correct answer in an unsuccessful Gold Run (£150 for the celebrity edition). Spot prizes exist in this series, occurring once per episode when a certain hex is selected. If each side wins one game each, the deciding game of past formats has been replaced with a sudden-death playoff entitled the Hexagon Standoff. The two teams try to answer one question, if they get it correct, they go to the Gold Run, however, if they answer incorrectly the opposition goes through. In the Gold Run, the contestant has a choice of two categories for their question board. This version uses a white background during the Gold Run and passes turn the space dark blue.

==Merchandise==
&quot;Blockbusters&quot; spawned a number of items of merchandise. 12 quiz books were released from the show which also led to a spin-off: &quot;Blockbusters Gold Run Volumes 1–5&quot; being produced.

In 1986, Waddingtons created a board game version of the show, which was named &quot;Game of the Year&quot; in 1986 by The British Association of Toy Retailers. This led to several successful spin offs; a &quot;Gold Run&quot; Card Game, a &quot;Junior Blockbusters&quot; board game (a children&#x27;s edition) and a &quot;Super Blockbusters&quot; board game (essentially, a second edition standard game with its own set of &quot;Gold Run&quot; cards). A computer game version of the show was also created for the Amstrad CPC, BBC Micro, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum.

In 2006, a DVD game based on the show was released by Circle Studio under license from FremantleMedia, with Bob Holness reprising his position at the helm. The DVD is based on the same format as the TV show, with a virtual set design and game graphics matching the original version of the programme.

In 2012, FremantleMedia&#x27;s gaming division launched an online slot game based on the British game show. The game is featured at many of the UK&#x27;s leading gambling sites, including Sky Vegas and Bet365.

==Transmissions==

===ITV series===

*Series 2 &amp; 3 were actually merged into one with the first 71 episodes as Series 2 and the last 49 episodes as Series 3.

===Later series===
===Champion Blockbusters===
====Regional transmissions information====
&quot;Blockbusters&quot; was one of the first British game shows to run in a &#x27;straddling&#x27; format, which allowed for games to last a different length of time, meaning that episodes would often begin and end mid-game, and matches often crossed over into two episodes. The show was generally screened at 5:15 pm Monday to Friday, filling the half-hour timeslot between Children&#x27;s ITV and the ITN &quot;News at 5:45&quot;, with a similar timeslot allocated on Saturdays for a while. The show was always aired on the ITV network, although the first series was repeated on Channel 4 during the summer of 1984, in the &quot;Countdown&quot; slot. &quot;Blockbusters&quot; was never networked across ITV&#x27;s sixteen regions, this meant that it was occasionally possible to retune the television to a neighbouring region and watch a different episode. &quot;Blockbusters&quot; did share its time slot with other game shows such as &quot;Ask No Questions&quot;, &quot;Connections&quot;, and &quot;Winner Takes All&quot;. Episodes were recorded in two blocks one during the summer and another during November.

=====1983=====
All regions aired Series 1, some stations moved &quot;Blockbusters&quot; to an earlier slot because the 5:15pm slot was taken up by soap operas.

* Border, Central, Granada, HTV, TVS, UTV and Yorkshire: Started on 29 August and finished on 4 November 1983. Mondays to Fridays at 5:15pm.
* Anglia, Channel, Grampian, Scottish, Thames and TSW: Started on 5 September and finished on 11 November 1983. Mondays to Fridays at 3:30pm.
* Tyne Tees: Started on 5 September and finished on 11 November 1983. Mondays to Fridays at 3:30pm. Switched to 5:15pm beginning 17 October.

=====1984–88=====
* Border, Central, Granada, HTV, Tyne Tees, UTV and Yorkshire: Mondays to Fridays at 5:15pm and Saturdays at 5:05pm. 
* Anglia, Grampian, and Scottish: Wednesdays to Fridays at 5:15pm and Saturdays at 5:05pm. Mondays and Tuesdays were filled with &quot;Emmerdale Farm&quot;. STV had the series at 3:30 for the first 5 weeks in 1984 as &quot;Crossroads&quot; held the 5:15 slot, but that changed by 10 October 1984. In 1987, Series 5 was held back until 12 September. In early 1988, Anglia moved the series to 6 days a week, and completed the series in March, while Grampian and STV completed the series on 19 April 1988.
* Thames/LWT: Wednesdays to Fridays at 5:15pm and Saturdays at 5:05pm. It was later changed in September 1985 from Mondays to Wednesdays and Fridays to Saturdays at 5:15pm.
* TVS: Wednesdays to Fridays at 5:15pm and Saturdays at 5:05pm. Mondays and Tuesdays were filled with &quot;Sons and Daughters&quot;. From Series 5, TVS switched to Mondays to Fridays at 5:15pm and Saturdays at 5:05pm. 
* TSW: Most of Series 2 was not transmitted because the 5.15pm slot was taken up by &quot;Crossroads&quot;, &quot;The Young Doctors&quot; and &quot;Emmerdale Farm&quot;, which later moved into early peak time in 1985 (as it was on Thames). 49 episodes of Series 2 aired in the mornings during the summer holiday (Mondays to Saturdays) from 1 July to 24 August 1985. Series 3 aired on Mondays, Fridays, and Saturdays at 5:15pm. Series 4 and 5 aired on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays at 5:15pm.
* Channel: Same as TSW&#x27;s schedule until January 1986, it was then switched to TVS&#x27;s schedules. This meant that approximately 16–20 episodes were skipped as TVS was further ahead.

=====1988–89=====
* All regions expect TSW broadcast the show from 2 September 1988 to 10 February 1989. Mondays to Fridays at 5:15pm and Saturdays at 5:05pm. However, Anglia and Scottish aired some episodes on Sundays instead of Saturdays.
* TSW: Started on 3 October 1988 and finished on 10 February 1989. Mondays to Fridays at 5:15pm and Saturdays at 5:05pm.
* No episodes aired on ITV between 19 September to 3 October due to the 1988 Summer Olympics.

=====1990–92=====
The show was delayed by all ITV regions until January 1990 as no slots were available to air the show. This was because &quot;Home and Away&quot; took over the 5:10pm slot and &quot;Emmerdale&quot; was now being aired at 6:30pm, before it was moved to 7:00pm in January 1990. Anglia, Central and TSW were airing repeats from September to December 1989.

* Anglia, Central and Thames: &quot;Blockbusters&quot; aired three times a week from January 1990 onwards on Mondays to Thursdays at 5:10pm and aired &quot;Home and Away&quot; at 6:00pm. Days of the week changed and additional episodes were added as well to make it four per week on occasions.
* LWT: No longer aired any episodes from this point onwards.
* Scottish: Tuesdays and Thursdays at 6:30pm from 3 January to April 1990. From May 1990, it was moved to a daytime slot around 1:30pm, with the number of episodes fluctuating from none to up to four from this point onwards. 
* Grampian: from 3 January 1990, Wednesdays and Thursdays at 6:30pm.
* Border, Granada, HTV, TVS, TSW, Tyne Tees, UTV and Yorkshire: Tuesdays to Thursdays at 6:30pm.

Granada moved the time slots around during this period, In Autumn 1990, the series was moved to 5:10pm, on occasion the series moved to 3:25pm to allow episodes of &quot;Families&quot; to have the 5:10pm slot. The series was moved again to 6:00pm from Wednesdays to Fridays in 1992. UTV reduced its time slots to one episode a week from January to October 1992, then from 26 October 1992, it was aired at 3:20pm from Mondays to Fridays. TVS reduced its time slots to two episodes a week for most of 1990, but during 1991–92, it went back to three episodes plus an additional episode around Saturday lunchtimes. TSW also dropped its time slots to two episodes per week every so often; however, in a bid to catch back up the series, it was moved to 5:10pm from Mondays to Fridays in September 1992. For around 18 months in 1991–92, Tyne Tees started airing more local output in the 6:30pm time slot, which resulted in fewer episodes per week. When Tyne Tees and Yorkshire decided to merge their scheduling in January 1993, Tyne Tees increased its episode output to catch up (In November 1992, it was airing four times a week on Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays), but had to drop over 50 episodes.

=====1993=====
Many new ITV companies came into being, with Westcountry and Carlton having hour-long news, while most of the other areas wished to have more local programmes in the early evenings which resulted in some areas, moving the series back before CITV.

* Anglia and Central: Mondays to Wednesdays at 5:10pm, then switching to Wednesdays to Fridays at 5:10pm. Completed on 19 May 1993, although repeats were transmitted until Christmas.
* Carlton: Mondays to Fridays at 3:20pm. Completed on 4 June 1993.
* HTV: Mondays to Thursdays at 1:45pm. Completed on 2 August 1993.
* Scottish: Continued to air the series between two and four times most week until 1 September 1993. Reappeared daily at 5:25am over Christmas period from 18 December 1993 finally completing the series on 7 January 1994. 
* Westcountry: Mondays to Fridays at 1:45pm. Completed on 3 September 1993.
* Border, Tyne Tees and Yorkshire: Continued on Tuesdays to Thursdays at 6:30pm. Completed on 28 September 1993.
* Grampian: Mondays to Fridays at 1:45pm. Completed on 21 December 1993.
* Meridian: Tuesdays and Wednesdays at 6:30pm. Completed on 14 December 1993.
* Granada: Aired 2–3 episodes most weeks at 5:10pm. From April to August, it was moved to 3:20pm. Completed in January 1994.
* Ulster: Mondays to Fridays at 3:20pm until August 1993, then switching to Saturday lunchtime until completed 15 January 1994.

=====1994–95=====
After the tenth series, &quot;Blockbusters&quot; was no longer networked on ITV. But it continued for one more series on the satellite channel Sky One. Six ITV regional channels showed this series.

* Sky One: Mondays to Fridays at 7:00pm from 18 April to 30 September 1994 before moving to 6:30pm from 28 November 1994 to 17 February 1995.
* Anglia and Central: Mondays to Wednesdays at 2:50pm from 18 April 1994 to 12 July 1995.
* Meridian: Wednesdays from early June until early September 1994

Challenge TV aired &quot;Blockbusters&quot; starting from September 1996 during the final months of The Family Channel and was the first game show broadcast on the relaunch from the Family Channel to Challenge TV on 3 February 1997 showing reruns from Series 9, it was repeated in February to June 1997, January to May 1998, September 1998 to January 1999 and May to September 1999.

In 2004, &quot;Saturday Night Takeaway&quot; showed clips from a 1992 episode with a contestant in the audience who did not get very far on the show and only won £10. Following requests on the (now &quot;defunct&quot;) Challenge forums to air the show, Challenge managed to acquire &quot;Blockbusters&quot; from June 2004 to June 2006, but they only showed the first 25 episodes from Series 10, which generated low ratings. Carlton Select also showed old shows while that channel was still operational.

Challenge reacquired &quot;Blockbusters&quot; but this time, they acquired 72 episodes from Series 10, and broadcast them during 2011. On 8 May 2014, they acquired the first series, which aired from 26 May. On 4 January 2016, Challenge began showing Series 11 (the first Sky One series), acquiring 179 of the 180 episodes in the series. In April 2024, Challenge began to rebroadcast Series 2 for the first time since its original broadcast in 40 years.

==Other countries==
The format has been remade in a number of countries during the 1980s and 1990s:
* – The Australian version of &quot;Blockbusters&quot;, hosted by Michael Pope, was broadcast on the Seven Network from 1991 to 1993. It had schools competing against other schools. Additionally, it also had an intro that looks similar to the Holness era from the UK version, although the theme song was different. 
* – A German version called &quot;Supergrips&quot; (originally called &quot;Grips&quot; before it) aired from 1988 to 1995 on the Bavarian TV network. Frank Laufenberg was the show&#x27;s original host from 1988 until 1990, then was later replaced by Ingo Dubinski from 1991 until 1995.
* – The French version was called &quot;Parcours d&#x27;enfer&quot; (&quot;Course of Hell&quot;) aired on TF1 and hosted by Pierre Bellemare.
* – The Indonesian version called &quot;Aksara Bermakna&quot; (&quot;Meaningful Letters&quot;) aired on two networks, first on TVRI from 1989 to 1996 with Kepra as host, then on antv for a brief period from 1997 to 1999, this time with Anton Gemilar as host. It was created by Ani Sumadi.
* – The Israeli version, called &quot;Nuts&quot;, ran on Israeli Educational Television from 1985 to 1994 with teenagers playing. Hosts of the Hebrew version were Shosh Atari, Avri Gilad, Ito Aviram, Anat Dolev, Mennachem Perry and Nahum Ido. An Arabic version, called &quot;Paths&quot; (masarat, مسارات), aired on the same network in 1996.
* – The Italian version is called &quot;Doppio Slalom&quot; (&quot;Dual Slalom&quot;) aired on Canale 5 from 1985 to 1990, originally hosted by Corrado Tedeschi from 1985 to 1990. Followed by Paolo Bonolis in the 1990 series.
* – The Jordanian version is called &quot;Lo3bet Al-Hourof&quot; on Amman TV with Zaid Zghoul.
* – A Dutch version of the show called &quot;Blokletters&quot; (&quot;Block Letters&quot;) ran for a brief period from 1986 on AVRO with Fred Oster at the helm. Its set with a mix of half light and dark colours and gameplay is very similar to that of the short-lived 1980–82 U.S. original. 
* – In Paraguay, called &quot;Blockbuster&quot;, like the Australian version, where two schools competed against each other. It aired on Telefuturo for a brief period in 1999, its hosts were Clari Arias and Leti Medina.
* – The Saudi Arabian version is called &quot;ABC Program/Competitions Letters&quot;, hosted by Ibrahim al-Qasim, Majid Cub, Ghanem Al Saleh, and Ghalib Full. The network for this version in particular aired on First Channel Saudi Arabia from 1987 until 1994. Then it was revived again three years later from 1997 until 1998. Twenty years later, a version hosted by Salman Al-Otaibi aired in 2017.
* – SVT in Sweden had their own version very similar to the UK one. &quot;2 mot 1&quot; (&quot;2 to 1&quot;) was a weekly afternoon programme forming part of SVT&#x27;s youth output. The programme was produced in Malmö airing from 1998 to 1999 and was hosted by Stellan Sundahl until he died from a heart attack in 1999 at the age of 52.
* – The Swiss version, also called &quot;Blockbusters&quot;, was hosted by Sven Epiney and aired on SF from 1997 to 2000.
* – The Turkish version called &quot;Haydi Bastir&quot; (&quot;Let&#x27;s Print&quot;) aired on Show TV from 1992 to 1993, the host was Mim Kemal Öke. Additionally, its set (and intro) looks similar to the original Holness era.
* – &quot;Blockbusters&quot; (the UK edition) was such a sensation with the entire English-speaking expatriate community in Dubai, U.A.E, that the city nearly came to a shutdown during its evening broadcast on Channel 33. Although there was no separate local TV version, the local paper, &quot;Gulf News&quot;, ran a yearly &quot;Blockbusters&quot; quiz competition, often hosted by Holness himself, between 1988 and 1994. The Gulf News &quot;Blockbusters&quot; show was telecast on Dubai TV too and was broadcast as a month-long event, with the heats during Ramadan and the finals after Eid al-Fitr. 
: After a 14-year-long hiatus, the contest was revived in 2008 as part of the newspaper&#x27;s 30th-anniversary celebrations. It was also held in 2009 where the team &quot;Anonymoys +3&quot; whose members included Rahul Menon and Aayush Rajasekaran of The Indian High School stood first place. This marked the second year that a team from the Indian High School defeated one from long-time rivals The Modern High School to claim first place.
* – The original American version of &quot;Blockbusters&quot; aired twice on NBC. Originally from 1980 until 1982, hosted by Bill Cullen with the &quot;2 in 1&quot; format. This was followed by a brief return of the show in 1987 hosted by Bill Rafferty which dropped the &quot;2 in 1&quot; format and had single contestants instead.

Other foreign versions of &quot;Blockbusters&quot; have aired in and .

<doc id="381543" wikidata="Q1170521" url="?curid=381543" title="Last of the Dogmen">
<text>Last of the Dogmen is a 1995 American Western film written and directed by Tab Murphy (in his feature directorial debut). It stars Tom Berenger, Barbara Hershey, Kurtwood Smith and Steve Reevis. Set in the mountains of northwest Montana, United States, the film is about a bounty hunter who tracks escaped convicts into a remote region and encounters an unknown band of Dog Soldiers from a tribe of Cheyenne Indians. The film was shot on location in Alberta and British Columbia, Canada, as well as in Mexico. Critical reviews were mixed to positive, though the film was a box office disappointment.

== Plot ==
Distraught but skillful bounty hunter Lewis Gates is accompanied by his horse and faithful companion Zip, an Australian cattle dog. Gates tracks three armed escaped convicts into Montana&#x27;s isolated Oxbow Quadrangle, at the persistence of his unforgiving ex-father-in-law, who blames Gates for his daughter&#x27;s tragic death. Gates sees the convicts but hears gunshots. Investigating the scene, Gates finds only a bloody scrap of cloth, &quot;enough blood to paint the sheriff&#x27;s office,&quot; a bloody shotgun shell, and an old-fashioned Indian arrow.

Gates takes the arrow to archaeologist Lillian Sloan, who identifies it as a replica of the arrows used by Cheyenne Dog Soldiers. Gates doesn&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a replica and, after some library research, develops a long list of people who have disappeared into the Oxbow. He also finds a story of a &quot;wild child&quot; captured by railroad men in the woods in the early 20th century and who escaped and disappeared. Now, he&#x27;s convinced that the three fugitives were killed by Cheyenne people who escaped the 1864 Sand Creek massacre, avoided being forced onto the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation, and who have survived for 128 years in the northwestern Montana Wilderness by killing any White people who threatened to find and expose their existence.

Gates convinces Sloan to join him in a search for the missing Cheyenne. The two enter the Oxbow and begin to search. They survive many mishaps and bond throughout their journey, eventually venturing deeper into the wilderness than Gates has ever gone before, around 50 miles (80.5 km) in.

After a week and nearing the end of their supplies, Sloan suggests heading back. As the two are packing their gear, they are suddenly attacked by a Cheyenne war party. Sloan, speaking the Cheyenne language, de-escalates the situation, and the two are taken captive by Yellow Wolf. They are taken to a Cheyenne village in a valley accessed through a tunnel behind a waterfall. The duo meet the village Chief Spotted Elk, who tells them of the escape and salvation of the Cheyenne 128 years ago, as well as his own run-in with the &quot;white people&quot; and escape from &quot;the house of iron bars&quot; when he was still a child.

Gates and Sloan slowly become friendly with the Cheyenne. However, Yellow Wolf&#x27;s son is sick, after being wounded in the gunfight with the convicts. Despite the elder&#x27;s concerns, Sloan convinces Yellow Wolf to allow Gates to ride into town to obtain antibiotics. In town, Gates robs the pharmacy and is chased by local law enforcement, including Sheriff Deegan, his father-in-law.

After escaping, Gates meets Yellow Wolf in the wilderness, and they return to the Cheyenne camp. By this time, the sheriff has gathered a posse and sets out to hunt down Gates both for robbing the store and to find Gates&#x27; female companion, whom the sheriff believes Gates has hiding in the Oxbow.

Gates and Sloan continue to grow closer to the Cheyenne, and Sloan discloses that they are indeed the last of their kind. However, Yellow Wolf shows Gates that the sheriff is following his trail and is slowly getting closer to the encampment. Knowing that if discovered, the Cheyenne will fight and die, Gates proposes a solution; using some leftover TNT the Cheyenne had taken from explorers many years earlier, he will create a distraction and allow the Cheyenne to flee deeper inside the Oxbow and live in peace, far away from civilization. Sloan decides to stay with the Cheyenne, which Gates reluctantly agrees to.

The two share a passionate kiss, and Gates begins to set up his plan. Gates gives himself up to the sheriff and pleads with him to leave the wilderness. However, the sheriff discovers the hidden tunnel and prepares to enter it. Escaping, Gates attempts to light the TNT with a rifle, but the sheriff stops him and threatens him with a gun to his head. Yellow Wolf appears, surprising the sheriff, and fires an arrow at the TNT, setting it off.

Gates and the sheriff are propelled out of the tunnel into the waterfall. Gates saves the sheriff, who is badly wounded. The deputy tells everyone to clear out, and they all head back to town to treat the wounded sheriff and Gates.

In Gates&#x27; holding cell, the sheriff confronts him about what Gates saw. Gates relents and says some things don&#x27;t need an explanation; they deserve to remain undiscovered. This seemingly helps smooth over Gates&#x27; and the sheriff&#x27;s relationship.

Sloan and the Cheyenne are shown to have successfully escaped. An indeterminate time later, Gates has begun searching for them in heavy snow. Using hints provided by Sloan, he is able to find them. The film ends with Zip running toward Gates as he enters a clearing and a passionate embrace between Sloan and Gates.

== Reception ==
&quot;Last of the Dogmen&quot; holds a 69% &quot;Fresh&quot; rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Roger Ebert of The Chicago Sun-Times gave the movie 3 out of 4 stars, describing it as &quot;an absorbing story, well told&quot; and carried by Berenger&#x27;s unpretentious performance, but he felt the final act descended into clichés and failed to live up to the intriguing premise.

A limited version available to watch on Netflix until October 19, 2020, featured another alternate narrated by Kurtwood Smith.

<doc id="381546" wikidata="Q2129881" url="?curid=381546" title="Ralph Yarborough">
<text>Ralph Webster Yarborough (June 8, 1903 – January 27, 1996) was an American politician and lawyer. He was a Texas Democratic politician who served in the United States Senate from 1957 to 1971 and was a leader of the progressive wing of his party. Along with Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson and Speaker of the House Sam Rayburn, but unlike most Southern congressmen, Yarborough refused to support the 1956 Southern Manifesto, which called for resistance to the racial integration of schools and other public places. Yarborough voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, 1964, and 1968, as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the confirmation of Thurgood Marshall to the U.S. Supreme Court. Yarborough was the only senator from a state that was part of the Confederacy to vote for all five bills.

Born in Chandler, Texas, Yarborough practiced law in El Paso after graduating from the University of Texas School of Law. He became an assistant to Texas Attorney General James Burr V Allred in 1931 and specialized in prosecuting major oil companies. Allred was later elected governor of Texas and appointed Yarborough to a judgeship in Travis County. After serving in the United States Army during World War II, Yarborough repeatedly ran for governor, opposing the conservative faction of Democrats led by Allan Shivers. Price Daniel resigned from the Senate after winning the 1956 gubernatorial election, and Yarborough won the special election to serve the remainder of Daniel&#x27;s term. He won election to a full term in 1958 and was reelected again in 1964, defeating Harris County Republican Party Chairman George H. W. Bush in the latter race.

Yarborough was known as &quot;Smilin&#x27; Ralph&quot; and used the slogan &quot;Let&#x27;s put the jam on the lower shelf so the little people can reach it&quot; in his campaigns. He staunchly supported the &quot;Great Society&quot; legislation that encompassed Medicare and Medicaid, the War on Poverty, federal support for higher education and veterans, and other programs. He also co-wrote the Endangered Species Act and was the most powerful proponent of the Big Thicket National Preserve. Yarborough criticized the Vietnam War and supported Robert F. Kennedy in the 1968 presidential election until the latter&#x27;s assassination.

In 1970, Yarborough lost re-nomination to fellow Democrat Lloyd Bentsen, who campaigned as relatively more conservative. Yarborough attempted to win the 1972 Democratic primary for Texas&#x27;s other Senate seat, but lost the primary to Barefoot Sanders. Yarborough did not seek public office after 1972.

==Early life==
Yarborough was born in Chandler in Henderson County west of Tyler, the seventh of nine children of Charles Richard Yarborough and the former Nannie Jane Spear. He was appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1919 but dropped out to become a teacher. Yarborough instead attended Sam Houston State Teachers College and transferred to the University of Texas at Austin. Yarborough graduated from the University of Texas Law School in 1927 and practiced law in El Paso until he was hired as an assistant attorney general in 1931 by the state Attorney General and later Governor James V. Allred. From 1923 to 1926 he served with the 36th Infantry Division of the Texas Army National Guard, reaching the rank of Staff Sergeant. After attending teaching school he taught for three years in Delta County and Martin Springs. He spent one year working and studying foreign trade and international relations in Europe, mostly as assistant secretary for the American Chamber of Commerce in Berlin, Germany.

Yarborough was an expert in Texas land law and specialized in prosecuting major oil companies that violated production limits or failed to pay oil royalties to the Permanent School Fund for drilling on public lands. He earned renown for winning a million dollar judgment against the Mid-Kansas Oil and Gas Company for oil royalties, the second largest judgment ever in Texas at the time. After Allred was elected governor, he appointed Yarborough judge of the 53rd Judicial District serving Travis County, the county seat of which is Austin. Yarborough was elected to a four-year term later the same year. Yarborough&#x27;s first run for state office resulted in a third-place finish in the Democratic primary for state attorney general in 1938 against the sitting lieutenant governor. Yarborough served in the U.S. Army during World War II after 1943 and achieved the rank of lieutenant colonel.

Before being elected a senator, Yarborough served on the Lower Colorado River Authority&#x27;s board of directors and lectured on land law at University of Texas School of Law in 1935. He also served as a presiding judge for the Third Administrative Judicial District of Texas. From 1947 to 1951 he was a member of the Texas Board of Law Examiners.

==Political career==

===Gubernatorial Bids===

Yarborough was urged to run again for state attorney general in 1952, and he planned to do so until he received a personal affront from Governor Allan Shivers who told him not to run. Texas Secretary of State John Ben Shepperd resigned in the spring of 1952 and was elected attorney general that year. He served two two-year terms. Angered at Shivers, Yarborough ran in the gubernatorial primaries in 1952 and 1954 against the conservative Shivers, drawing support from labor unions and liberals. Yarborough denounced the &quot;Shivercrats&quot; for veterans&#x27; fraud in the Texas Veterans Land Board of the Texas General Land Office and for endorsing in 1952 and 1956 the Republican Eisenhower/Nixon ticket, instead of the Democrat Adlai Stevenson of Illinois. Shivers portrayed Yarborough as an integrationist supported by communists and unions. The 1954 election was particularly nasty in its race-baiting by Shivers as it was the year that &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; was decided, and Shivers made the most of the court decision in order to play on voters&#x27; fears. Yarborough, however, nearly upset Shivers.

In 1956, Yarborough made it to the primary runoff for governor against U.S. Senator Price Daniel. Texas historian J. Evetts Haley ran in the primary to the political right of both Daniel and Yarborough but lost. After being endorsed by former opponent and former Governor W. Lee O&#x27;Daniel, and making aggressive attacks on the Shivers-backed candidate, Yarborough looked to win the runoff, but instead he trailed Daniel by about nine thousand votes. It is believed (by Yarborough, his supporters, and biographer) that the election was stolen because of irregular voting in East Texas and that Yarborough really won the runoff by thirty thousand. Nevertheless, Yarborough&#x27;s runs for governor had raised his stature and popularity in the state as he had been campaigning for six straight years for office.

===U. S. senator===
When Daniel resigned from the Senate in 1957 to become governor, Yarborough ran in the special election to fill the empty seat. With no runoff then required, he needed only a plurality of votes to win. Ironically, his many runs for governor made him the best positioned candidate. Yarborough won the special election with 38 percent of the vote to join fellow Texan Lyndon B. Johnson in the Senate. The runner-up in the race with 30 percent of the vote was U.S. Representative Martin Dies, Jr., known for his investigations into communist infiltration. A Republican lawyer from Houston, Thad Hutcheson, ran third with 23 percent of the ballots cast.

James Boren served as Yarborough&#x27;s campaign manager and chief of staff. In office, Ralph Yarborough was a very different kind of Southern senator. He did not support the Southern Manifesto opposing integration and supported national Democratic goals of more funding for health care, education, and the environment. Himself a veteran, he worked to expand the G.I. Bill to Cold War veterans. Yarborough&#x27;s first major legislative victory was the successful passage of the National Defense Education Act of 1958, which began federal funding of loans and grants to universities and their students.

In the 1958 Democratic primary, Yarborough easily defeated the conservative William A. Blakley, a millionaire businessman from Dallas who was backed by Daniel. Blakley had been the interim senator from January to April 1957 but did not run in the special election in which Yarborough defeated Dies and Hutcheson. Instead Blakley was appointed senator again in 1961 and ran in another special election, only to be defeated by the Republican John Tower.

In the nationally Democratic year of 1958, Yarborough cruised to victory in the general election over the Republican nominee, publisher Roy Whittenburg of Amarillo. During his first full term, Yarborough worked for a bill signed by President John F. Kennedy to designate Padre Island as a national seashore. While serving in the senate he was a member of the Interparliamentary Union Group from 1961 to 1970 and a member of the board of directors of Gallaudet College from 1969 to 1971.

===Assassination of John F. Kennedy===

Yarborough rode in the Dallas motorcade in which John F. Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963. He was in a convertible with Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson, Lady Bird Johnson (who sat between Yarborough and Johnson), United States Secret Service agent Rufus Youngblood, and Hurchel Jacks of the Texas State Highway Patrol. From the start of the President&#x27;s tour of Texas, Yarborough considered that he had been slighted by some of the arrangements and so, in the early stages, refused to ride with Johnson, despite repeated pleas by Youngblood. His decision, underpinned by a long-standing feud with Governor Connally, an old friend and erstwhile ally of Johnson, caused embarrassment to both the President and Vice President and drew considerable diversionary attention in the press. According to Johnson, Kennedy considered Yarborough&#x27;s behavior &quot;an outrage&quot; and there is some evidence of a heated exchange between Kennedy and Johnson the night before Kennedy&#x27;s death. According to Johnson&#x27;s biographer Robert Caro, the next morning in Fort Worth, Kennedy intervened directly with Yarborough, making clear that, if he valued his friendship, he would ride with Johnson when the party reached Dallas. Then, during the short flight from Fort Worth, Kennedy persuaded Connally to give Yarborough a more prominent role in some of the later functions planned in Austin. In the ensuing motorcade, the car carrying Yarborough and Johnson was two cars behind the presidential limousine carrying Kennedy and Connally (who was seriously wounded during the attack). In a later interview, Yarborough called the event &quot;the most tragic event of my life.&quot; Shortly after Johnson became president, Yarborough telephoned him in conciliatory and supportive terms.

==== Wrestling with Thurmond ====

Shortly after the passing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, on July 9, Johnson nominated former Florida governor LeRoy Collins to a position in the Community Relations Service, which was designed to mediate racial disputes. Strom Thurmond, the most senior southern member of the Commerce Committee, bitterly opposed Collins&#x27;s nomination, based on a speech that Collins made in Thurmond’s home state in which he said that southern leaders’ “harsh and intemperate” language unnecessarily stoked racial unrest. Commerce Chairman Warren Magnuson was aware that he had the votes in favor of the nomination, but had failed to get the required quorum. Thurmond, aware of Magnuson&#x27;s struggles, stationed himself outside of the committee door, physically blocking any entry by later-arriving senators.

Later, Yarborough arrived, and was blocked from entering. The only southern senator to have voted for the Civil Rights Act, Yarborough joked to Thurmond, &quot;Come on in, Strom, and help us get a quorum.&quot; Thurmond responded, &quot;If I can keep you out, you won’t go in, and if you can drag me in, I’ll stay there.&quot; Thurmond and Yarborough were both 61 years old, but Thurmond was lighter and much fitter. After some light scuffling, both senators removed their suit jackets. Thurmond overpowered Yarborough, whom he managed to bring to the floor. &quot;Tell me to release you, Ralph, and I will,&quot; said Thurmond. Yarborough refused. Another senator approached, suggesting that they stop before one of them had a heart attack. Eventually, the fight was broken up by Magnuson, who growled, &quot;Come on, you fellows, let’s break this up.&quot; Yarborough said, &quot;I have to yield to the order of my chairman.&quot; Thurmond and Yarborough composed themselves and entered the committee chamber.

Collins was nominated by a vote of 16 to 1.

===1964 re-election bid===

In 1964, Yarborough again won the primary without a runoff, and won the general election with 56.2% of the vote. His Republican opponent was George H. W. Bush, who attacked Yarborough as a left-wing demagogue and for his vote in favor of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Yarborough denounced Bush as an extremist to the right of that year&#x27;s GOP presidential nominee, Barry Goldwater, and as a rich easterner and carpetbagger trying to buy a Senate seat. It has since been learned that then-Governor Connally was covertly aiding Bush, against President Johnson&#x27;s wishes, by teaching Democrats the techniques of split ticket voting. In the same election, Connally defeated Bush&#x27;s ticket-mate, Jack Crichton. In 1967, Yarborough was the first U.S. senator to introduce the first bilingual education act.

Although Yarborough supported Johnson&#x27;s domestic agenda, he went public with his criticism of Johnson&#x27;s foreign policy and the Vietnam War after Johnson announced his retirement. Yarborough supported Robert F. Kennedy for president until his assassination, then Eugene McCarthy until his loss in Chicago, finally backing Hubert Humphrey in his 1968 campaign against Nixon. In 1969, Yarborough became chairman of the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare.

===1970 re-election bid===

In 1970, South Texan businessman and former Congressman Lloyd Bentsen defeated Yarborough in the Democratic primary, when Yarborough was focusing on an expected second general election campaign against Bush. Bentsen played on voters&#x27; fears of societal breakdown and urban riots, made an issue of Yarborough&#x27;s opposition to the Vietnam War, and called him a political antique. Bentsen said, &quot;It would be nice if Ralph Yarborough would vote for his state every once in a while.&quot; He defeated Bush in the general election.

===1972 attempt at a comeback===
In 1972, Yarborough made a comeback effort to win the Democratic nomination to challenge Senator John Tower, who as a young man had once circulated Yarborough stickers. Yarborough won the first round of the primary and came within 526 votes of winning the primary without the need for a runoff. He again made accusations of vote fraud from the conservative wing. He lost in the primary runoff to a former U.S. Attorney, Barefoot Sanders, in an anti-incumbent sweep after the Sharpstown Bank-stock Scandal despite neither being an incumbent nor involved at all with the scandal.

From 1973 to 1974, Yarborough served as a member of the Constitutional Revision Commission of Texas. From 1983 to 1987, he served as a member of the State Library and Archives Commission of Texas. He practiced law in Austin from 1971 until his death in 1996.

==Death==

Yarborough died in 1996 at his home in Austin. He is interred at the Texas State Cemetery there beside his wife, the former Opal Warren, a native of Murchison in Henderson County, Texas. The Texas State Cemetery is sometimes called &quot;the Arlington of Texas&quot;. Yarborough left a legacy in the modernization of the state of Texas and achieved political power when Texas had a native son, Lyndon Johnson, in the White House. He was combative with the dominant industries of oil and natural gas and pushed for the petroleum industry to pay a greater share of taxes. Their son, Richard Warren Yarborough, a lawyer since 1955, died on March 5, 1986, at age 54. Ralph and his wife Opal were survived by three grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.

==Legacy==
Yarborough was one of the last of the New Deal Democrats and powerful liberals in Texas state politics. (He was followed by more conservative senators such as Bentsen and Phil Gramm). Yarborough is remembered as the acknowledged &quot;patron saint of Texas liberals&quot;. Supporters and former aides who have since risen to prominence include Jim Hightower, Ann Richards, and Garry Mauro.

The University of Texas at Austin Press published a biography, &quot;Ralph W. Yarborough: The People&#x27;s Senator&quot;, by Patrick L. Cox. It features a foreword by Senator Edward Kennedy.

The Yarborough Branch of the Austin Public Library was named in Yarborough&#x27;s honor.

In October 1966, Yarborough introduced Senate Bill 5–3929 to establish a 75,000-acre national park to preserve the remaining natural and undisturbed areas of the Big Thicket in southeast Texas. Due in part to opposition from the lumber industry in the region, as well as vague and disputed definitions of what and where the Big Thicket actually was, it took seven years and another 27 Big Thicket bills until Congress established the Big Thicket National Preserve in 1974.

Yarborough was well known for his commitment to science. He favored the creation of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and in 1957 was on a subcommittee that began the investigation that resulted in NASA&#x27;s creation. The next year, he voted for the National Aeronautics and Space Act, citing the impact he believed the agency could have on his hometown of Houston.

Yarborough advocated more education in science and technology in schools throughout the country. In his biography, he wrote, &quot;NASA helped push ahead progress in technology. The country&#x27;s schools should be oriented towards developing technology and teaching science.&quot;

<doc id="381549" wikidata="Q8060907" url="?curid=381549" title="Yule Log (TV program)">
<text>The Yule Log is a television show originating in the United States, which is broadcast traditionally on Christmas Eve or Christmas morning. It originally aired from 1966 to 1989 on New York City television station WPIX (channel 11), which revived the broadcast in 2001. A radio simulcast of the musical portion was broadcast by WPIX-TV&#x27;s former sister station, WPIX-FM (101.9 FM, now WFAN-FM), until 1988.

The show, which has run between two and four hours in duration, is a film loop of a yule log burning in a fireplace, with a soundtrack of Christmas music playing in the background; it is broadcast without commercial interruption.

==Origins==
&quot;The Yule Log&quot; was created in 1966 by Fred M. Thrower, president and chief executive officer of WPIX, Inc. Inspired by an animated Coca-Cola commercial from a year earlier that showed Santa Claus at a fireplace, he envisioned the program as a televised Christmas gift to those residents of New York who lived in apartments and homes without fireplaces. This also provided time for employees of the television station to stay home with their families, instead of working for the usual morning news program.
The original program was filmed at Gracie Mansion, the official residence of the Mayor of New York City, John Lindsay, at the time. An estimated US$4,000 of advertising (along with a roller derby telecast that night) was canceled on Christmas Eve for the show&#x27;s inaugural airing that day. Thrower, and WPIX-FM programming director Charlie Whittaker selected the music, based largely on the easy listening format that the radio station had then, with the likes of Percy Faith (whose rendition of &quot;Joy to the World&quot; is played at the beginning and the end of the telecast), Nat King Cole, Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops Orchestra, Mantovani and the Ray Conniff Singers, among others. During the filming, the producers removed a protective fire grate so that the blaze could be seen better; a stray spark damaged a nearby antique rug valued at $4,000.

The program was both a critical and ratings success, and by popular demand, it was rebroadcast for 23 consecutive years, beginning in 1967. However, by 1969, it was already apparent that the original 16 mm film was quickly deteriorating from wear and needed to be re-filmed. Also, the original loop was only 17 seconds long, resulting in a visibly jerky and artificial appearance. Station producer William Cooper, a future recipient of a Peabody Award, again asked to film the loop at Gracie Mansion, but the mayor&#x27;s office refused permission. In 1970, WPIX found a fireplace with similar andirons at a residence in California and filmed a burning log on 35mm film there on a hot August day. This version&#x27;s loop runs approximately six minutes and three seconds.

==Cancellation and revival==
From 1974 to 1989, a special message by Richard N. Hughes, then the vice president and general manager of WPIX-TV, usually preceded the program, which was broadcast every Christmas Eve or Christmas Day, and sometimes both. In 1977, the program&#x27;s broadcast on Christmas Eve was followed by WPIX&#x27;s first-ever live broadcast of Midnight Mass from St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral. In 1978, the program was broadcast for the first time on Christmas morning.

The cost of broadcasting the program without commercial interruption prompted Michael Eigner, who had been appointed as the station&#x27;s new general manager upon Hughes&#x27;s retirement, to cancel it in 1990; incidentally that year, director Whit Stillman included a scene of a New Yorker viewing the &quot;Log&quot; in his movie &quot;Metropolitan&quot;. Despite being flooded with hundreds of letters protesting the move, WPIX did not broadcast the program, a move that lasted for eleven years, the longest-lasting hiatus for a television special at that time. Beginning in 1997, WPIX offered various versions of &quot;The Yule Log&quot; on the Internet.

In March 2000, Totowa, New Jersey, resident Joseph Malzone, a longtime fan of &quot;The Yule Log&quot;, created a Web site named &quot;Bring Back The Log&quot;, now named TheYuleLog.com, and administered by Lawrence F. &quot;Chip&quot; Arcuri, petitioning station management to bring back &quot;The Yule Log&quot; broadcast. In December 2001, WPIX vice president/general manager Betty Ellen Berlamino announced during an appearance on local radio station WPLJ that the special would return to the television station after an eleven-year absence. Berlamino explained that people wanted &quot;comfort food TV&quot; in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center. The digitally restored program was the most-watched television program in the New York metropolitan area on Christmas Day that year and it has continued to be broadcast annually ever since as a result.

Program director Julie O&#x27;Neil found the original master film of the 1970 fireplace at WPIX&#x27;s film archives in Fort Lee, New Jersey. The master film had been misfiled in a &quot;Honeymooners&quot; film canister marked with the episode title &quot;A Dog&#x27;s Life&quot;, which resulted in a 2006 40th anniversary special about the Log being titled &quot;A Log&#x27;s Life&quot;. In 2009, a fourth hour of the program was added, featuring 22 new songs and seven new artists.

On July 29, 2016, a 16 mm print of the original 1966 version of the &quot;Yule Log&quot; was discovered amongst a collection of films recovered from the estate of former WPIX executive and producer William Cooper two years prior. The discovery had been made by archivist Rolando Pujol while going through the old films in search of footage of (then) presidential candidate Donald Trump. After undergoing digital restoration, WPIX later announced that they would air it on December 24 of that year – exactly 50 years to the day of its debut, making it the first time since 1988 that WPIX aired the Yule Log on Christmas Eve. It was followed by the live broadcast of Midnight Mass. An encore airing would follow at 7:00 a.m. on December 25, followed by the modern four-hour log.

==Legacy==
In 2003, Tribune Broadcasting—then the owner of WPIX—announced that in addition to being broadcast in New York City, &quot;The Yule Log&quot; would air on television stations that the company owned in other television markets throughout the U.S., and would be remastered for broadcast in high definition. The program made its national debut in 2004 on cable channel Superstation WGN (later WGN America, now NewsNation), at the time serving as the superstation feed of Tribune&#x27;s flagship station WGN-TV, which broadcast the special in the Chicago market.

In 2008, the Tribune stations aired their own version, with holiday-themed old-time radio programs being played in the background instead of music; this was reverted to the original WPIX version for the 2009 broadcast. WGN America chose not to broadcast &quot;The Yule Log&quot; in 2010 and 2011, citing the economic infeasibility of devoting several hours to commercial-free programming on a national channel; however, the program was broadcast in the Chicago market by WGN-TV, and by Tribune Broadcasting&#x27;s other television stations. For the 2010 edition, WPIX and Los Angeles sister station KTLA (channel 5) aired a four-hour broadcast of &quot;The Yule Log&quot; on Christmas morning. In 2011, Antenna TV, a digital multicast network that Tribune had launched that January, aired &quot;The Yule Log&quot; for the first time, making the concept available nationwide once again.

In December 2006, to commemorate the program&#x27;s 40th anniversary, WPIX also aired &quot;A Log&#x27;s Life&quot;—a documentary on the history of &quot;The Yule Log&quot;, narrated by WPIX news anchors Jim Watkins and Kaity Tong. In 2013, WPIX streamed &quot;The Yule Log&quot; on its website during Christmas Eve, in addition to televising it on Christmas Day. In recent years, Tribune&#x27;s New Orleans ABC affiliate WGNO-TV (channel 26) has also aired the &quot;Yule Log&quot; on Christmas Day (the only time in which the station does not air most of its regular newscasts, as ABC airs NBA games on that day), in place of network news programs &quot;World News Now&quot; and &quot;America This Morning&quot;, and WGNO&#x27;s local weekday morning newscast.

In 2019, Tribune merged with Nexstar Media Group, and WPIX was sold to the E. W. Scripps Company to keep Nexstar under regulatory national coverage limits for station owners. (Tribune spun off a handful of other television stations to Scripps and Tegna for similar reasons as well as to resolve ownership conflicts with existing Nexstar stations in certain markets.) Despite the sale, WPIX, along with the Tribune stations acquired by Nexstar, continued to all carry the traditional &quot;Yule Log&quot; presentation without any changes in 2019. In 2020, Nexstar partner company Mission Broadcasting exercised its option to buy WPIX, through which Nexstar would assume operational responsibilities for the station; the sale was approved by the FCC on December 1, 2020, and was completed on December 30, effectively reuniting the station with most of the former Tribune stations bought directly by Nexstar. The &quot;Yule Log&quot; was again left intact under the new ownership.

==Digital media==
According to author Ron Feigenblatt, the WPIX &quot;Yule Log&quot; presentation inspired his similar digital medium demonstration on the then-young IBM Personal Computer, starting in 1985. At that time, the PC&#x27;s new Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA) finally allowed one to achieve limited, full-color, full-screen, pseudo-continuous, raster-graphics animation on a primitive consumer-grade personal computer, by flipping, during the frame-refresh interval, between four different (synthetic or pre-processed photographic) screen images pre-loaded into the display adapter memory, using a computer application program called PCMOVIE, written at IBM Research and distributed throughout IBM.

==Similar programs==

Some television stations and cable channels that have broadcast imitations of &quot;The Yule Log&quot; simulcast the Christmas music from a radio station that is playing it, and before 1989, the WPIX version also secondarily promoted the playing of the same Christmas music in a simulcast over its sister FM station, WPIX-FM (101.9), for those unable to view &quot;The Yule Log&quot; on television (or for those who wanted to listen to the broadcast in stereo, as stereophonic sound was not standard in television, nor were most television sets equipped with high quality sound systems, until the 1990s).

Other television stations (and cable channels) have spawned imitations. Fellow Tribune station WDCW (then WBDC and now owned by Nexstar) in Washington, D.C. has produced its own version, filming a log burning at Colonial Williamsburg. Local versions were also broadcast by WPWR-TV in Chicago (with music provided by WNUA 95.5 MHz) and KOFY-TV in San Francisco. In the 2000s, Jason Patton—an executive at INHD (later MOJO HD, now defunct), who was inspired as a youth by WPIX&#x27;s &quot;Yule Log&quot;—produced his own version, which has been broadcast every Christmas since, via video on demand. Broadcasters as diverse as Oregon Public Broadcasting, the MSG Network (as well as its former competitor, the Empire Sports Network), the CHUM Television group and Télévision Quatre-Saisons in Canada as well as Super RTL in Germany have also borrowed the concept.

WKBW-TV in Buffalo, New York (owned at the time by Granite Broadcasting Corporation, and now owned by Scripps), as a replacement for that day&#x27;s morning newscast, introduced &quot;The Yule Log&quot; as a replacement in 2008; it did not return in 2009, but WBBZ-TV (who hired WKBW&#x27;s former program director and Empire Sports Network&#x27;s former vice president) brought &quot;The Yule Log&quot; to their station, where it continues to air annually. KSTC-TV in Minneapolis–Saint Paul, Minnesota (owned by Hubbard Broadcasting) also produces a local version of &quot;The Yule Log&quot;. The version aired by KTXA (channel 21) in Dallas, Texas beginning in 2013, featured two stockings adorned with the respective logos of KTXA and co-owned classic hits radio station KLUV, which produced the broadcast on its sister television station&#x27;s behalf. KTXA discontinued the program in 2017, following then-parent CBS Corporation’s sale of KLUV and the rest of CBS Radio&#x27;s Dallas–Fort Worth station cluster to Entercom; KLUV moved its &quot;Yule Log&quot; playlist to one of its HD radio feeds for the 2018 edition.

In 2010, Gospel Music Channel (now Up TV) aired a 24-hour broadcast of &quot;The Yule Log&quot; from 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Christmas Eve until 8:00 p.m. Christmas night. Before its conversion to a general children&#x27;s format in 2017 as Universal Kids, Sprout offered a 12-hour loop called &quot;The Sprout Snooze-A-Thon&quot; (previously called &quot;A Goodnight of Sweet Dreams&quot;) during the evening of Christmas Eve, which features scenes of sleeping characters from the network&#x27;s programming set to soft music to soothe children to sleep before the arrival of Santa Claus.

In its early years, the Home Shopping Network also aired the &quot;Yule Log&quot; in place of regular programming (the network traditionally does not air live shopping programming on Christmas Day), before switching to a loop of Tampa Bay Area choirs singing Christmas carols and host wishes in subsequent years. QVC also airs a &quot;Yule Log&quot; every year on December 25 (as with HSN, the network does not air live programming on Christmas). Hallmark Movies &amp; Mysteries airs a version featuring an orange cat and a Jack Russell terrier, both named &quot;Happy&quot;, intended to promote the Hallmark&#x27;s Pet Project, an initiative of parent company Crown Media Holdings to encourage shelter adoptions and proper pet care. For a period, the Canadian music channel MuchMusic aired a similar special featuring a television in the scene playing Christmas music videos.

ESPN networks have aired college sports-themed versions of the concept, including SEC Network (which is set to the fight songs of Southeastern Conference schools), and Longhorn Network (which aired footage of Texas Longhorns mascot Bevo roaming a ranch to holiday music). In 2016, ESPNU aired &quot;A Very Golic Christmas&quot;, featuring then-ESPN personality Mike Golic Jr. eating Christmas cookies in pajamas, on a decorated set with a video fireplace. 

A great many &quot;video fireplace&quot; productions with a similar format have also been marketed on VHS, DVD and Blu-ray, some of which are entitled &quot;Yule Log&quot;. The &quot;Yule Log&quot; program also helped influence the &quot;Puppy Bowl&quot;, an annual special broadcast by cable network Animal Planet on the day of the Super Bowl.

In 2008, Outback Steakhouse paid homage to &quot;The Yule Log&quot; by having the first 20 seconds of a 30-second advertisement feature a CGI version of the log, before shifting focus to some steaks. Also in 2008, animation director PES released a free screensaver that reimagined the yule log in the form of food, with pretzels used for the log and candy corn for the flames.

In 2017, 2018, and 2019, the official Twitch channel for the video game &quot;Overwatch&quot; streamed an &quot;Overwatch Yule Log&quot;, featuring the game&#x27;s creative director and then-Blizzard Entertainment vice president Jeff Kaplan sitting in front of a fireplace. The 2017 stream recorded 40,000 concurrent viewers at one point. The stunt was repeated for 2018, featuring guest appearances by Matthew Mercer (voice actor of McCree), and Charlet Chung (voice of D.Va), and professional &quot;Overwatch&quot; player Jake. Supergiant Games similarly streamed a &quot;Hades&quot;-themed version of the concept in 2020, using an animation featuring characters from the game.

Actor Nick Offerman released his own version of &quot;The Yule Log&quot; on December 2, 2015, in the style of his character Ron Swanson, from the television series &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot;. Offerman pours a glass of Lagavulin single malt scotch whiskey as the yule log fire plays and stares at the camera for 45 minutes. Disney+ released &quot;Arendelle Castle Yule Log&quot; variant in mid-December 2019 based on the &quot;Frozen&quot; franchise.

<doc id="381552" wikidata="Q1141345" url="?curid=381552" title="Allopathic medicine">
<text>Allopathic medicine, or allopathy, is an archaic and derogatory label originally used by 19th-century homeopaths to describe heroic medicine, the precursor of modern evidence-based medicine. There are regional variations in usage of the term. In the United States, the term is sometimes used to contrast with osteopathic medicine, especially in the field of medical education. In India, the term is used to distinguish conventional modern medicine from Siddha medicine, Ayurveda, homeopathy, Unani and other alternative and traditional medicine traditions, especially when comparing treatments and drugs.

The terms were coined in 1810 by the creator of homeopathy, Samuel Hahnemann. Heroic medicine was the conventional European medicine of the time and did not rely on evidence of effectiveness. It was based on the belief that disease is caused by an imbalance of the four &quot;humours&quot; (blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile) and sought to treat disease symptoms by correcting that imbalance, using &quot;harsh and abusive&quot; methods to induce symptoms seen as opposite to those of diseases rather than treating their underlying causes: disease was caused by an excess of one humour and thus would be treated with its &quot;opposite&quot;.

A study released by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2001 defined &quot;allopathic medicine&quot; as &quot;the broad category of medical practice that is sometimes called Western medicine, biomedicine, evidence-based medicine, or modern medicine.&quot; The WHO used the term in a global study in order to differentiate Western medicine from traditional and alternative medicine, noting that in certain areas of the world &quot;the legal standing of practitioners is equivalent to that of allopathic medicine&quot; where practitioners can be separately certified in complementary/alternative medicine and Western medicine.

The term &quot;allopathy&quot; was also used to describe anything that was not homeopathy. Kimball Atwood, an American medical researcher and alternative medicine critic, said the meaning implied by the label of allopathy has never been accepted by conventional medicine and is still considered pejorative. American health advocate and sceptic William T. Jarvis, stated that &quot;although many modern therapies can be construed to conform to an allopathic rationale (e.g., using a laxative to relieve constipation), standard medicine has never paid allegiance to an allopathic principle&quot; and that the label &quot;allopath&quot; was &quot;considered highly derisive by regular medicine.&quot; Most modern science-based medical treatments (antibiotics, vaccines, and chemotherapeutics, for example) do not fit Hahnemann&#x27;s definition of allopathy, as they seek to prevent illness or to alleviate an illness by eliminating its cause.

The terms &quot;allopathic medicine&quot; and &quot;allopathy&quot; are drawn from the Greek prefix &#x27; (&quot;állos&quot;), &quot;other,&quot; &quot;different&quot; + the suffix&#x27; (&quot;páthos&quot;), &quot;suffering&quot;.

==History==

The practice of medicine in both Europe and North America during the early 19th century is sometimes referred to as heroic medicine because of the extreme measures (such as bloodletting) sometimes employed in an effort to treat diseases. The term &quot;allopath&quot; was used by Hahnemann and other early homeopaths to highlight the difference they perceived between homeopathy and the &quot;conventional&quot; heroic medicine of their time. With the term allopathy (meaning &quot;other than the disease&quot;), Hahnemann intended to point out how physicians with conventional training employed therapeutic approaches that, in his view, merely treated symptoms and failed to address the disharmony produced by underlying disease. Homeopaths saw such symptomatic treatments as &quot;opposites treating opposites&quot; and believed these methods were harmful to patients.

Practitioners of alternative medicine have used the term &quot;allopathic medicine&quot; to refer to the practice of conventional medicine in both Europe and the United States since the 19th century. In that century, the term allopath was used most often as a derogatory name for the practitioners of heroic medicine,&lt;ref name=&quot;DOI 10.1177/0002716202583001002&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; a precursor to modern medicine that itself did not rely on evidence of effectiveness.

James Whorton discusses this historical pejorative usage: 

The controversy surrounding the term can be traced to its original usage during a heated 19th-century debate between practitioners of homeopathy and those they derisively referred to as &quot;allopaths.&quot;

Hahnemann used &quot;allopathy&quot; to refer to what he saw as a system of medicine that combats disease by using remedies that produce effects in a healthy subject that are different (hence the Greek root &quot;allo-&quot; &quot;different&quot;) from the effects produced by the disease to be treated. The distinction comes from the use in homeopathy of substances that are meant to cause similar effects as the symptoms of a disease to treat patients (&quot;homeo&quot; - meaning &quot;similar&quot;).

As used by homeopaths, the term &quot;allopathy&quot; has always referred to the principle of treating disease by administering substances that produce other symptoms (when given to a healthy human) than the symptoms produced by a disease. For example, part of an allopathic treatment for fever may include the use of a drug which reduces the fever, while also including a drug (such as an antibiotic) that attacks the cause of the fever (such as a bacterial infection). A homeopathic treatment for fever, by contrast, is one that uses a diluted dosage of a substance that in an undiluted form would induce fever in a healthy person. These preparations are typically diluted so heavily that they no longer contain any actual molecules of the original substance. Hahnemann used this term to distinguish medicine as practiced in his time from his use of infinitesimally small (or nonexistent) doses of substances to treat the spiritual causes of illness.

The &quot;Companion Encyclopedia of the History of Medicine&quot; states that &quot;[Hahnemann] gave an all-embracing name to regular practice, calling it &#x27;allopathy&#x27;. This term, however imprecise, was employed by his followers and other unorthodox movements to identify the prevailing methods as constituting nothing more than a competing &#x27;school&#x27; of medicine, however dominant in terms of number of practitioner proponents and patients&quot;.

Contrary to the present usage, Hahnemann reserved the term &quot;allopathic medicine&quot; to the practice of treating diseases by means of drugs inducing symptoms unrelated (i.e., neither similar nor opposite) to those of the disease. He called the practice of treating diseases by means of drugs producing symptoms opposite to those of the patient &quot;enantiopathic&quot; (from the Greek &quot;&quot; (&quot;enántios&quot;), meaning &quot;opposite&quot;) or &quot;antipathic medicine&quot;.

==Current usage==

In the United States, the term is used in the modern era to differentiate between two types of US medical schools (both of which teach aspects of science-based medicine and neither of which teach homeopathy): Allopathic (granting the MD degree) and Osteopathic (granting the DO degree).

In India the term is used principally to distinguish &quot;Western medicine&quot; from Ayurveda, especially when comparing treatments and drugs.

A study released by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2001 defined &quot;allopathic medicine&quot; as &quot;the broad category of medical practice that is sometimes called Western medicine, biomedicine, evidence-based medicine, or modern medicine.&quot; The WHO used the term in a global study in order to differentiate Western medicine from traditional medicine, and from complementary/alternative medicine, noting that in certain areas of the world “the legal standing of practitioners is equivalent to that of allopathic medicine” where practitioners are certified in both complementary/alternative medicine and Western medicine.

As of 2004, use of the term remained common among homeopaths and had spread to other alternative medicine practices. Kimball Atwood, an American medical researcher and alternative medicine critic, said the meaning implied by the label of allopathy has never been accepted by conventional medicine and is still considered pejorative by some. American health educator and skeptic William T. Jarvis, stated in 2008 that &quot;although many modern therapies can be construed to conform to an allopathic rationale (e.g., using a laxative to relieve constipation), standard medicine has never paid allegiance to an allopathic principle&quot; and that the label &quot;allopath&quot; was &quot;considered highly derisive by regular medicine&quot;.

Most modern science-based medical treatments (antibiotics, vaccines, and chemotherapeutics, for example) do not fit Samuel Hahnemann&#x27;s definition of allopathy, as they seek to prevent illness, or remove the cause of an illness by acting on the cause of disease.

<text>Alvis Edgar &quot;Buck&quot; Owens Jr. (August 12, 1929 – March 25, 2006) was an American musician, singer, songwriter, and band leader. He was the lead singer for Buck Owens and the Buckaroos, which had 21 No. 1 hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country music chart. He pioneered what came to be called the Bakersfield sound, named in honor of Bakersfield, California, Owens&#x27;s adopted home and the city from which he drew inspiration for what he preferred to call &quot;American music&quot;.

While the Buckaroos originally featured a fiddle and retained pedal steel guitar into the 1970s, their sound on records and onstage was always more stripped-down and elemental. The band&#x27;s signature style was based on simple story lines, infectious choruses, a twangy electric guitar, an insistent rhythm supplied by a prominent drum track, and high, two-part vocal harmonies featuring Owens and his guitarist Don Rich.

From 1969 to 1986, Owens co-hosted the popular CBS television variety show &quot;Hee Haw&quot; with Roy Clark (syndicated beginning in 1971). According to Owens&#x27;s son Buddy Alan, the accidental 1974 death of Don Rich, his closest friend, devastated him for years and impacted his creative efforts until he mounted a comeback in the late 1980s.

Owens is a member of both the Country Music Hall of Fame and Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame.

==Biography==
Owens was born August 12, 1929 on a farm in Sherman, Texas, United States, to Alvis Edgar Owens Sr. and Maicie Azel (née Ellington) Owens.

In the biography &quot;About Buck&quot;., Rich Kienzle writes: &quot;&#x27;Buck&#x27; was a donkey on the Owens farm.&quot; &quot;When Alvis Jr. was three or four years old, he walked into the house and announced that his name also was &quot;Buck.&quot; That was fine with the family, and the boy&#x27;s name became &quot;Buck&quot; from then on.&quot; He attended public school for grades 1–3 in Garland, Texas.

Owens&#x27;s family moved to Mesa, Arizona, in 1937 during the Dust Bowl and Great Depression. While attending school in Arizona, Owens found that while he disliked formal schoolwork, he could often satisfy class requirements by singing or performing in school plays. As a result, he began to take part in such activities whenever he could.

===Early career===
A self-taught musician and singer, Owens became proficient on guitar, mandolin, horns, and drums. When he obtained his first electric steel guitar, he taught himself to play it after his father adapted an old radio into an amplifier. Owens quit school in the ninth grade in order to help work on his father&#x27;s farm and pursue a music career. In 1945, he co-hosted a radio show called &quot;Buck and Britt.&quot; Co-host Theryl Ray Britten and Owens also played at local bars, where owners usually allowed them and a third member of their band to pass the hat during a show and keep 10% of the take. They eventually became the resident musicians at a Phoenix bar called the Romo Buffet.

In the late 1940s, Owens became a truck driver, a job which took him through the San Joaquin Valley of California, where he first experienced and was impressed by the town of Bakersfield. He and his first wife eventually settled there in 1951. Soon, Owens was frequently traveling to Hollywood for session recording jobs at Capitol Records, playing backup for Tennessee Ernie Ford, Wanda Jackson, Tommy Collins, Tommy Duncan, and many others.

Using the pseudonym &quot;Corky Jones&quot; to prevent the recording of a rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll tune from hurting his aspiring Country Music career, Owens recorded a rockabilly record called &quot;Hot Dog&quot; for the Pep label. Some time in the 1950s he lived with his second wife and children in Fife, Washington, where he sang with the Dusty Rhodes band.

In 1958 Owens met Don Rich in Steve&#x27;s Gay 90s Restaurant in South Tacoma, Washington. Owens had observed one of Rich&#x27;s shows and immediately approached him about collaborating, after which Rich began playing fiddle with Owens at local venues. They were featured on the weekly BAR-K Jamboree on KTNT-TV 11. In 1959, Owens&#x27;s career took off when his song &quot;Second Fiddle&quot; hit No. 24 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart. Soon after, &quot;Under Your Spell Again&quot; made it to No. 4 on the charts and Capitol Records wanted Owens to return to Bakersfield, California.

Following their success, Owens tried unsuccessfully to convince Rich to accompany him to Bakersfield. Instead, Rich opted to go to become a music teacher at Centralia College. While there, he tutored on the side but continued playing local venues. In December 1960, however, he left to rejoin Owens in Bakersfield.

&quot;Above and Beyond&quot; hit No. 3. On April 2, 1960, Owens performed the song on ABC-TV&#x27;s &quot;Ozark Jubilee&quot;.

===Career peak===
In early 1963, the Johnny Russell song &quot;Act Naturally&quot; was pitched to Owens, who initially didn&#x27;t like it. His guitarist and longtime collaborator Don Rich, however, enjoyed it and convinced Owens to record it with the Buckaroos. Laid down on February 12, 1963, it was released on March 11 and entered the charts of April 13. By June 15 the single began its first of four non-consecutive weeks at the No. 1 position, Owens&#x27;s first top hit. The Beatles recorded a cover of it in 1965 with Ringo Starr as lead singer. Starr later recorded a duet of it with Owens in 1988.

The 1966 album &quot;Carnegie Hall Concert&quot; was a smash hit and further cemented Buck Owens as a top country band. It achieved crossover success on to the pop charts, reinforced by R&amp;B singer Ray Charles releasing cover versions of two of Owens&#x27;s songs that became pop hits that year: &quot;Crying Time&quot; and &quot;Together Again&quot;.

In 1967, Owens and the Buckaroos toured Japan, a then-rare occurrence for a country act. The subsequent live album, &quot;Buck Owens and His Buckaroos in Japan&quot;, was an early example of a country band recording outside the United States.

Owens and the Buckaroos performed at the White House for President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968, which was later released as a live album.

Between 1968 and 1969, pedal steel guitar player Tom Brumley and drummer Willie Cantu left the band, replaced by JayDee Maness and Jerry Wiggins. Owens and the Buckaroos had two songs reach No. 1 on the country music charts in 1969, &quot;Tall Dark Stranger&quot; and &quot;Who&#x27;s Gonna Mow Your Grass&quot;. In 1969, they recorded a live album, &quot;Live in London&quot;, where they premiered their rock song &quot;A Happening In London Town&quot; and their version of Chuck Berry&#x27;s song &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot;.

During this time &quot;Hee Haw&quot;, starring Owens and the Buckaroos, was at its height of popularity. The series, originally envisioned as a country music&#x27;s version of &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;, went on to run in various incarnations for 231 episodes over 24 seasons. Creedence Clearwater Revival mentioned Owens by name in their 1970 single &quot;Lookin&#x27; Out My Back Door&quot;.

Also between 1968 and 1970, Owens made guest appearances on top TV variety programs, including &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot;, &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot; and seven times on &quot;The Jimmy Dean Show&quot;.

In the early 1970s, Owens and the Buckaroos enjoyed a string of hit duets with his protege Susan Raye, who subsequently became a popular solo artist with Owens as her producer.

In 1971, the Buckaroos&#x27; bass guitarist Doyle Holly left the band to pursue a solo career. Holly was known for his booming deep voice on solo ballads. His departure was a setback to the band, as Doyle had received the Bass Player of the Year award from the Academy of Country Music the year before and served as co-lead vocalist (along with Don Rich) of the Buckaroos. Holly went on to record two solo records in the early 1970s, both were top 20 hits.

Owens and Rich were the only members left of the original band, and in the 1970s they struggled to top the country music charts. However, the popularity of &quot;Hee Haw&quot; was allowing them to enjoy large crowds at indoor arenas.

After three years of not having a number one song Owens and the Buckaroos finally had another No. 1 hit, &quot;Made in Japan&quot;, in 1972. The band had been without pedal steel since late in 1969 when Maness departed. In April he added pedal steel guitarist, Jerry Brightman, and Owens returned to his grassroots sound of fiddle, steel, and electric guitars, releasing a string of singles including &quot;Arms Full of Empty&quot;, &quot;Ain&#x27;t it Amazing Gracie&quot; and &quot;Ain&#x27;t Gonna Have Ole Buck (to Kick Around no More)&quot;. Owens&#x27;s original version of &quot;Streets of Bakersfield&quot; was released in 1972.

===Death of Don Rich===
On July 17, 1974, Owens&#x27;s best friend, the Buckaroos&#x27; guitarist Don Rich, was killed when he lost control of his motorcycle and struck a guard rail on Highway 1 in Morro Bay, where he was to have joined his family for vacation. Owens was devastated. &quot;He was like a brother, a son and a best friend,&quot; he said in the late 1990s. &quot;Something I never said before, maybe I couldn&#x27;t, but I think my music life ended when he died. Oh yeah, I carried on and I existed, but the real joy and love, the real lightning and thunder is gone forever.&quot; Owens would never fully recover from the tragedy, either emotionally or professionally.

===Business ventures===

Before the 1960s ended, Owens and manager Jack McFadden began to concentrate on Owens&#x27;s financial future. He bought several radio stations, including KNIX (AM) (later KCWW) and KNIX-FM in Phoenix and KUZZ-FM in Bakersfield. During the 1990s, Owens was co-owner of the country music network Real Country, of which, the Owens-owned station KCWW was the flagship station. In 1998, Owens sold KCWW to ABC/Disney for $8,850,000 and sold KNIX-FM to Clear Channel Communications, but he maintained ownership of KUZZ until his death.

Owens established Buck Owens Enterprises and produced records by several artists. He recorded for Warner Bros. Records, but by the 1980s he was no longer recording, instead devoting his time to overseeing his business empire from Bakersfield. He left &quot;Hee Haw&quot; in 1986.

===Later career===
Country artist Dwight Yoakam was largely influenced by Owens&#x27;s style of music and teamed up with him for a duet of &quot;Streets of Bakersfield&quot; in 1988. It was Owens&#x27;s first No. 1 single in 16 years. In an interview, Yoakam described the first time he met with Owens:

We sat there that day in 1987 and talked about my music to that point, my short career, and what I&#x27;d been doing and how he&#x27;d been watching me. I was really flattered and thrilled to know that this legend had been keeping an eye on me.

Owens also collaborated with Cledus T. Judd on the song &quot;The First Redneck On The Internet&quot; in 1998, in which Owens also appears in the music video.

The 1990s saw a flood of reissues of Owens&#x27;s Capitol recordings on compact disc, the publishing rights to which Owens had bought back in 1974 as part of his final contract with the label. His albums had been out of print for nearly 15 years when he released a retrospective box set in 1990. Encouraged by brisk sales, Owens struck a distribution deal with Sundazed Music of New York, which specializes in reissuing obscure recordings. The bulk of his Capitol catalog was reissued on CD in 1995, 1997 and in 2005. Sometime in the 1970s, Owens had also purchased the remaining copies of his original LP albums from Capitol&#x27;s distribution warehouses across the country. Many of those records (still in the shrinkwrap) were stored by Owens for decades. He often gave them away as gifts and sold them at his nightclub for a premium price some 35 years later.

In August 1999, Owens brought back together the remaining members of his original Buckaroo Band to help him celebrate his 70th birthday at his Crystal Palace in Bakersfield. Owens, Doyle Holly, Tom Brumley, and Wille Cantu performed old hits from their heyday including &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Tiger By the Tail&quot; and &quot;Act Naturally&quot;.

Long before Owens became the famous co-host of &quot;Hee Haw&quot;, his band became known for their signature Bakersfield sound, later emulated by artists such as Merle Haggard, Dwight Yoakam, and Brad Paisley. Buck inspired indie country songwriter and friend Terry Fraley, whose band &quot;The Nudie Cowboys&quot; possessed a similar sound. This sound was originally made possible with two trademark silver-sparkle Fender Telecaster guitars, often played simultaneously by Owens and longtime lead guitarist Don Rich. Fender had made a &quot;Buck Owens signature Telecaster,&quot; and after his death paid tribute to him. In 2003, Paisley blended creative styles with this guitar and his own Paisley Telecaster, creating what became known as the Buck-O-Caster. Initially, only two were made; one for Paisley himself and the other presented to Owens during a New Year&#x27;s celebration that Paisley attended in 2004.

Following the death of Rich, Owens&#x27;s latter trademark became a red, white and blue acoustic guitar, along with a 1974 Pontiac convertible &quot;Nudiemobile&quot;, adorned with pistols and silver dollars. A similar car, created by Nudie Cohn for Elvis Presley and later won by Owens in a bet, is now enshrined behind the bar at Owens&#x27;s Crystal Palace Nightclub in Bakersfield.

Owens would hand out replicas of his trademark acoustic guitar to friends, acquaintances, and fans. Each would contain a gold plaque with the name of the recipient. Some of these guitars cost $1000 and up.

==Personal life==
Owens was married four times, three ending in divorce and one in annulment. He married country singer Bonnie Campbell Owens in 1948. The couple had two sons, one of whom was Buddy Alan, and separated in 1951, and later divorced.

In 1956 Owens married Phyllis Buford with whom he had a third son. In the 1970s he had a relationship with Hee Haw &quot;Honey&quot; Lisa Todd and appeared with her as &quot;Buck Owens and his gal Lisa&quot; on the TV game show &quot;Tattletales&quot;.

In 1977 he wed Buckaroos fiddle player Jana Jae Greif. Within a few days he filed for annulment, then changed his mind; the couple continued the on-and-off marriage for a year before divorcing. In 1979 he married Jennifer Smith.

Owens had three sons: Buddy Alan (who charted several hits as a Capitol recording artist in the early 1970s and appeared with his father numerous times on &quot;Hee Haw&quot;), Johnny, and Michael Owens.

Owens successfully recovered from oral cancer in the early 1990s, but had additional health problems near the end of the 1990s and the early 2000s, including pneumonia and a minor stroke in 2004. These health problems had forced him to curtail his regular weekly performances with the Buckaroos at his Crystal Palace. Owens died in his sleep of an apparent heart attack at his ranch just north of Bakersfield on March 25, 2006, only hours after performing at his club. He was 76 years old.

Owens was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1996. He was ranked No. 12 in &quot;CMT&#x27;s 40 Greatest Men of Country Music&quot; in 2003. In addition, CMT also ranked the Buckaroos No. 2 in the network&#x27;s &quot;20 Greatest Bands&quot; in 2005. He was also inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame.

The stretch of US Highway 82 in Sherman, Texas, is named the Buck Owens Freeway in his honor.

==Biographies==
In November 2013, Buck Owens&#x27;s posthumous autobiography &quot;Buck &#x27;Em! The Autobiography of Buck Owens&quot; by Buck Owens with Randy Poe was released. The book has a foreword by Brad Paisley and a preface by Dwight Yoakam.

In a 2007 authorized biography &quot;Buck&quot;, historian Kathryn Burke gives a positive account of Owens.

In &quot;Buck Owens: The Biography&quot; (2010) investigative journalist Eileen Sisk offers a critical account of Owens and the shortcomings in his private life.

<doc id="381564" wikidata="Q288156" url="?curid=381564" title="Normativity">
<text>Normativity is the phenomenon in human societies of designating some actions or outcomes as good, desirable, or permissible, and others as bad, undesirable, or impermissible. A norm in this sense means a standard for evaluating or making judgments about behavior or outcomes. &quot;Normative&quot; is sometimes also used, somewhat confusingly, to mean relating to a descriptive standard: doing what is normally done or what most others are expected to do in practice. In this sense a norm is not evaluative, a basis for judging behavior or outcomes; it is simply a fact or observation about behavior or outcomes, without judgment. Many researchers in science, law, and philosophy try to restrict the use of the term &quot;normative&quot; to the evaluative sense and refer to the description of behavior and outcomes as positive, descriptive, predictive, or empirical.

&quot;Normative&quot; has specialized meanings in different academic disciplines such as philosophy, social sciences, and law. In most contexts, normative means &#x27;relating to an evaluation or value judgment.&#x27; Normative propositions tend to evaluate some object or some course of action. Normative content differs from descriptive content.

Though philosophers disagree about how normativity should be understood; it has become increasingly common to understand normative claims as claims about reasons. As Derek Parfit explains:

== Philosophy ==
A normative or prescriptive statement is one that evaluates certain kinds of words, decisions, or actions as either correct or incorrect, or one that sets out guidelines for what a person &quot;should&quot; do. In philosophy, normative theory aims to make moral judgments on events, focusing on preserving something they deem as morally good, or preventing a change for the worse. The theory has its origins in Greece. Normative statements of such a type make claims about how institutions should or ought to be designed, how to value them, which things are good or bad, and which actions are right or wrong. Claims are usually contrasted with positive (i.e. descriptive, explanatory, or constative) claims when describing types of theories, beliefs, or propositions. Positive statements are (purportedly) factual, empirical statements that attempt to describe reality.

For example, &quot;children should eat vegetables&quot;, and &quot;those who would sacrifice liberty for security deserve neither&quot; are philosophically normative claims. On the other hand, &quot;vegetables contain a relatively high proportion of vitamins&quot;, and &quot;a common consequence of sacrificing liberty for security is a loss of both&quot; are positive claims. Whether a statement is philosophically normative is logically independent of whether it is verified, verifiable, or popularly held.

There are several schools of thought regarding the status of philosophically normative statements and whether they can be rationally discussed or defended. Among these schools are the tradition of practical reason extending from Aristotle through Kant to Habermas, which asserts that they can, and the tradition of emotivism, which maintains that they are merely expressions of emotions and have no cognitive content.

There is large debate in philosophy surrounding whether one can get a normative statement of such a type from an empirical one (i.e. whether one can get an &#x27;ought&#x27; from an &#x27;is&#x27;, or a &#x27;value&#x27; from a &#x27;fact&#x27;). Aristotle is one scholar who believed that one could in fact get an ought from an is. He believed that the universe was teleological and that everything in it has a purpose. To explain why something is a certain way, Aristotle believed one could simply say that it is trying to be what it ought to be. On the contrary, David Hume believed one cannot get an ought from an is because no matter how much one thinks something ought to be a certain way it will not change the way it is. Despite this, Hume used empirical experimental methods whilst looking at the philosophically normative. Similar to this was Kames, who also used the study of facts and the objective to discover a correct system of morals. The assumption that &#x27;is&#x27; can lead to &#x27;ought&#x27; is an important component of the philosophy of Roy Bhaskar.

Philosophically normative statements and norms, as well as their meanings, are an integral part of human life. They are fundamental for prioritizing goals and organizing and planning. Thought, belief, emotion, and action are the basis of much ethical and political discourse; indeed, normativity of such a type is arguably the key feature distinguishing ethical and political discourse from other discourses (such as natural science).

Much modern moral/ethical philosophy takes as its starting point the apparent variance between peoples and cultures regarding the ways they define what is considered to be appropriate/desirable/praiseworthy/valuable/good etc. (In other words, variance in how individuals, groups and societies define what is in accordance with their philosophically normative standards.) This has led philosophers such as A. J. Ayer and J.L. Mackie (for different reasons and in different ways) to cast doubt on the meaningfulness of normative statements of such a type. However, other philosophers, such as Christine Korsgaard, have argued for a source of philosophically normative value which is independent of individuals&#x27; subjective morality and which consequently attains (a lesser or greater degree of) objectivity.

== Social sciences ==

In the social sciences, the term &quot;normative&quot; has broadly the same meaning as its usage in philosophy, but may also relate, in a sociological context, to the role of cultural &#x27;norms&#x27;; the shared values or institutions that structural functionalists regard as constitutive of the social structure and social cohesion. These values and units of socialization thus act to encourage or enforce social activity and outcomes that &quot;ought&quot; to (with respect to the norms implicit in those structures) occur, while discouraging or preventing social activity that &quot;ought not&quot; occur. That is, they promote social activity that is socially &quot;valued&quot; (see philosophy above). While there are always anomalies in social activity (typically described as &quot;crime&quot; or anti-social behaviour, see also normality (behavior)) the normative effects of popularly endorsed beliefs (such as &quot;family values&quot; or &quot;common sense&quot;) push most social activity towards a generally homogeneous set. From such reasoning, however, functionalism shares an affinity with ideological conservatism.

Normative economics deals with questions of what sort of economic policies should be pursued, in order to achieve desired (that is, valued) economic outcomes.

=== Politics ===

The use of normativity and normative theory in the study of politics has been questioned, particularly since the rise in popularity of logical positivism. It has been suggested by some that normative theory is not appropriate to be used in the study of politics, because of its value based nature, and a positive, value neutral approach should be taken instead, applying theory to what is, not to what ought to be. Others have argued, however, that to abandon the use of normative theory in politics is misguided, if not pointless, as not only is normative theory more than a projection of a theorist&#x27;s views and values, but also this theory provides important contributions to political debate. Pietrzyk-Reeves discussed the idea that political science can never truly be value free, and so to not use normative theory is not entirely helpful. Furthermore, perhaps the normative dimension political study has is what separates it from many branches of social sciences.

==== International relations ====
In the academic discipline of International relations, Smith, Baylis &amp; Owens in the &quot;Introduction&quot; to their 2008 book make the case that the normative position or normative theory is to make the world a better place and that this theoretical worldview aims to do so by being aware of implicit assumptions and explicit assumptions that constitute a non-normative position, and align or position the normative towards the loci of other key socio-political theories such as political liberalism, Marxism, political constructivism, political realism, political idealism and political globalization.

==== Law ====

In law, as an academic discipline, the term &quot;normative&quot; is used to describe the way something ought to be done according to a value position. As such, normative arguments can be conflicting, insofar as different values can be inconsistent with one another. For example, from one normative value position the purpose of the criminal process may be to repress crime. From another value position, the purpose of the criminal justice system could be to protect individuals from the moral harm of wrongful conviction.

== Standards documents ==
The CEN-CENELEC Internal Regulations describe &quot;normative&quot; as applying to a document or element &quot;that provides rules, guidelines or characteristics for activities or their results&quot; which are mandatory.

Normative elements are defined in International Organization for Standardization Directives Part 2 as &quot;elements that describe the scope of the document, and which set out provisions&quot;. Provisions include &quot;requirements&quot;, which are criteria that must be fulfilled and cannot be deviated from, and &quot;recommendations&quot; and &quot;statements&quot;, which are not necessary to comply with.

<doc id="381565" wikidata="Q743521" url="?curid=381565" title="Scarborough, North Yorkshire">
<text>Scarborough () is a seaside town in the district and county of North Yorkshire, England. With a population of 61,749, Scarborough is the largest town on the Yorkshire Coast and the fourth-largest settlement in the county.

It is located on the North Sea coastline. Historically in the North Riding of Yorkshire, the town lies between 10 and 230 feet (3–70 m) above sea level, from the harbour rising steeply north and west towards limestone cliffs. The older part of the town lies around the harbour and is protected by a rocky headland which extends into the North Sea.

The town has fishing and service industries, including a growing digital and creative economy, as well as being a tourist destination. Residents of the town are known as Scarborians.

== Etymology ==
Scarborough was founded by Danes in the 10th century, when Thorgil (also known as Skarthi, meaning &#x27;hare-lip&#x27;) built a stronghold here – hence &#x27;Skarthi&#x27;s burh&#x27;.

==History==
===Origins===

The town is claimed to have been founded around 966 AD as by Thorgils Skarthi, a Viking raider. There is no archaeological evidence to support this claim, which was made during the 1960s as part of a pageant of Scarborough events. The claim is based on a fragment of an Icelandic Saga. However, due to coastal erosion over the years, evidence may have been lost to the sea. In the 4th century, there was briefly a Roman signal station on Scarborough headland, and there is evidence of earlier settlements, during the Stone Age and Bronze Age. Any settlement between the fifth and ninth centuries would have been burned to the ground by a band of Vikings under Tostig Godwinson (a rival of Thorgils Skarthi), Lord of Falsgrave, or Harald III of Norway. These periodic episodes of destruction and massacre means that very little evidence of settlement during this period remained to be recorded in the Domesday survey of 1085. (The original inland village of Falsgrave was Anglo-Saxon rather than Viking.)

===Roman period===

A Roman signal station was built on a cliff-top location overlooking the North Sea. It was one of a chain of signal stations, built to warn of sea-raiders. Coins found at the site show that it was occupied from until the early fifth century.

In 2021 an excavation at a housing development in Eastfield, Scarborough, revealed a Roman luxury villa, religious sanctuary, or combination of both. The building layout is unique in Britain and extends over an area of about the size of two tennis courts. It included a bathhouse and a cylindrical tower with rooms radiating from it. The buildings were “designed by the highest-quality architects in northern Europe in the era and constructed by the finest craftsmen.” Historic England described the finds as “one of the most important Roman discoveries in the past decade.” There are plans to revise the housing development layout, recover the remains and incorporate them in a public green area. Historic England is to recommend the remains be protected as a scheduled monument.

===Medieval===
Scarborough recovered under King Henry II, who built an Angevin stone castle on the headland and granted the town charters in 1155 and 1163, permitting a market on the sands and establishing rule by burgesses.

Edward II granted Scarborough Castle to his favourite, Piers Gaveston. The castle was subsequently besieged by forces led by the barons Percy, Warenne, Clifford and Pembroke. Gaveston was captured and taken to Oxford and thence to Warwick Castle for execution.

In 1318, the town was burnt by the Scots, under Sir James Douglas following the Capture of Berwick upon Tweed.

In the Middle Ages, Scarborough Fair, permitted in a royal charter of 1253, held a six-week trading festival attracting merchants from all over Europe. It ran from Assumption Day, 15 August, until Michaelmas Day, 29 September. The fair continued to be held for 500 years, from the 13th to the 18th century, and is commemorated in the song &quot;Scarborough Fair&quot;:
:&quot;Are you going to Scarborough Fair?&quot;
:&quot;—parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme...&quot;.

===Resort development===

Scarborough and its castle changed hands seven times between Royalists and Parliamentarians during the English Civil War of the 1640s, enduring two lengthy and violent sieges. Following the civil war, much of the town lay in ruins.

In 1626, Mrs Thomasin Farrer discovered a stream of acidic water running from one of the cliffs to the south of the town. This gave birth to Scarborough Spa, and Dr Robert Wittie&#x27;s book about the spa waters published in 1660 attracted a flood of visitors to the town. Scarborough Spa became Britain&#x27;s first seaside resort, though the first rolling bathing machines were not reported on the sands until 1735. It was a popular getaway destination for the wealthy of London, such as the bookseller Andrew Millar and his family. Their son Andrew junior died there in 1750.

The coming of the Scarborough–York railway in 1845 increased the tide of visitors. Scarborough railway station claims a record for the world&#x27;s longest platform seat. From the 1880s until the First World War, Scarborough was one of the regular destinations for The Bass Excursions, when fifteen trains would take between 8,000 and 9,000 employees of Bass&#x27;s Burton brewery on an annual trip to the seaside.

===Maritime events===

During the First World War, the town was bombarded by German warships of the High Seas Fleet, an act which shocked the British (see Raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby). Scarborough Pier Lighthouse, built in 1806, was damaged in the attack. A U-boat assault on the town, on 25 September 1916 saw three people killed and a further five injured. Eleven of Scarborough&#x27;s trawler fleet were sunk at sea in another U-boat attack, on 4 September 1917.

In 1929, the steam drifter &quot;Ascendent&quot; caught a tunny (Atlantic bluefin tuna) and a Scarborough showman awarded the crew 50 shillings so he could exhibit it as a tourist attraction. Big-game tunny fishing off Scarborough effectively started in 1930 when Lorenzo &quot;Lawrie&quot; Mitchell–Henry, landed a tunny caught on rod and line weighing .
A gentlemen&#x27;s club, the British Tunny Club, was founded in 1933 and set up its headquarters in the town at the place which is now a restaurant with the same name. Scarborough became a resort for high society. A women&#x27;s world tuna challenge cup was held for many years.

Colonel (and, later, Sir) Edward Peel landed a world-record tunny of , capturing the record by from one caught off Nova Scotia by American champion Zane Grey. The British record which still stands is for a fish weighing caught off Scarborough in 1933 by Laurie Mitchell-Henry.

On 5 June 1993, Scarborough made international headlines when a landslip caused part of the Holbeck Hall Hotel, along with its gardens, to fall into the sea. Although the slip was shored up with rocks and the land has long since grassed over, evidence of the cliff&#x27;s collapse remains clearly visible from The Esplanade, near Shuttleworth Gardens.

Scarborough has been affiliated with a number of Royal Navy vessels, including HMS &quot;Apollo&quot;, HMS &quot;Fearless&quot; and HMS &quot;Duncan&quot;.

==Landmarks==

The town has an Anglican church, St Martin-on-the-Hill, built in 1862–63 as the parish church of South Cliff. It contains works by Dante Gabriel Rossetti, William Morris, Edward Burne-Jones and Ford Madox Brown. A young Malton architect, John Gibson, designed the Crown Spa Hotel, Scarborough&#x27;s first purpose-built hotel.
Notable Georgian structures include the Rotunda Museum, Cliff Bridge and Scarborough Pier Lighthouse. Victorian buildings include the Classical Public Library and Market Hall, the Town Hall, Scarborough Spa, the Art Gallery, the South Cliff Methodist Church, and Scarborough railway station. The architecture of Scarborough generally consists of small, low, orange pantile-roofed buildings in the historic old town, and larger Classical and late Victorian buildings reflecting the time during the 19th century as it expanded away from its historic centre into a coastal spa resort.

A notable landmark in the town is the Grand Hotel on St Nicholas Cliff. Designed by Cuthbert Brodrick of Hull, it was completed in 1867; at the time of its opening, it was the largest hotel and the largest brick structure in Europe. It uses local yellow brickwork with red detailing and is based around a theme of time: four towers represent the seasons, 12 floors the months, 52 chimneys the weeks and the original 365 bedrooms represented the days of the year. A blue plaque outside the hotel marks where the novelist Anne Brontë died in 1849. She was buried in the graveyard of St Mary&#x27;s Church by the castle.

An amount of 20th century architecture exists within the main shopping district and in the form of surrounding suburbs. Buildings from this century include the Futurist Theatre (1914), Stephen Joseph Theatre, Brunswick Shopping Centre (1990), and GCHQ Scarborough, a satellite station on the outskirts of the town.

==Geography==
===North Bay===
The North Bay has traditionally been the more peaceful end of the resort and is home to Peasholm Park which, in June 2007, was restored to its Japanese-themed glory, complete with reconstructed pagoda, a new boat house was added in 2018. For many years a mock maritime battle (based on the Battle of the River Plate) has been regularly re-enacted on the boating lake with large model boats and fireworks throughout the summer holiday season.

Northstead Manor Gardens include the North Bay Railway and three other attractions: a water chute, a boating lake with boats for hire during the summer season and the open-air theatre. The water chute is now grade II listed and is one of the oldest surviving water chutes in Britain, with the ride of today being the same as when it was opened in the 1930s. The North Bay Railway is a miniature railway running from near Peasholm Park, through Northstead Manor Gardens to the Sea Life Centre at Scalby Mills. The North Bay Railway has what is believed to be the oldest operational diesel-hydraulic locomotive in the world. Neptune was built in 1931 by Hudswell Clarke of Leeds and is appropriately numbered 1931.

===Castle on the scar===

The most striking feature of the town&#x27;s geography is the high rocky promontory pointing eastward into the North Sea with Scarborough Castle on the top. The castle was bombarded by the German warships and in the First World War.

The promontory divides the seafront into two bays, north and south. The two bays are linked by Marine Drive, an extensive Victorian promenade, built around the base of the headland. Both bays have popular sandy beaches and numerous rock-pools at low tide.

===South Bay===

The South Bay was the site of the original medieval settlement and harbour, which form the old town. This remains the main tourist area, with a sandy beach, cafés, amusements, arcades, theatres and entertainment facilities. The modern commercial town centre has migrated north-west of the harbour area and above it and contains the transport hubs, main services, shopping and nightlife. The harbour has undergone major regeneration including the new Albert Strange Pontoons, a more pedestrian-friendly promenade, street lighting and seating.

The town was badly damaged in a 98 plane bombing raid by the Luftwaffe during the Second World War, on 18 March 1941. Twenty eight civilians were killed and hundreds were injured and over 1,400 buildings were damaged.

The South Cliff Promenade above the Spa and South Cliff Gardens has wide views of the South Bay and old town. Its splendid Regency and Victorian terraces are still intact, with a mix of quality hotels and flats. The ITV television drama &quot;The Royal&quot; and its recent spin-off series, &quot;The Royal Today&quot; were both filmed in the area. The South Bay has the largest illuminated &#x27;star disk&#x27; anywhere in the UK. It is across and fitted with subterranean lights representing the 42 brightest stars and major constellations that can be seen from Scarborough in the northern skies.

===Mere and mount===

To the south-west of the town, beside the York to Scarborough railway line, is an ornamental lake known as Scarborough Mere. In the 20th century the Mere was a popular park, with rowing boats, canoes and a miniature pirate ship – the &quot;Hispaniola&quot; – on which passengers were taken to &#x27;Treasure Island&#x27; to dig for doubloons. Since the late 1990s the Mere has been redesigned as a natural space for picnics, fishing and walkers. In 2012 a new snack bar was built alongside the Mere. The lake is now part of the Oliver&#x27;s Mount Country Park and the &quot;Hispaniola&quot; now sails out of Scarborough harbour during the summer season.

Surrounding the River Derwent as it flows into the sea are high hills with tall, dense grasses and fertile soil, due to the stream &#x27;Sea Cut&#x27; leading from the River Derwent to the estuary at the North Sea. The area has flourishing and vibrant flora and crop growth.

A seaweed farm has been in operation since 2018, with a licence to go into a large-scale commercial operation from 2019. SeaGrown have an intent to move into the bioplastics market.

The tourism trade continues to be a major part of the local economy with Scarborough being the second most-visited destination in England by British holidaymakers. While weekend and mid-week-break trade are tending to replace the traditional week-long family holiday, the beaches and attractions are busy throughout summer, a contrast to quieter winter months.

Scarborough&#x27;s town centre has a multiple boutique shops (such as on Bar Street and St Thomas Street) with a main pedestrianised shopping street and a shopping centre with many major chains. The town also has an indoor market hall with a large range of antique shops and independent traders in its vaults, and a smaller market on the South Bay. Boyes (based on the town&#x27;s outskirts in Eastfield) is a discount department store chain which has over 70 stores across principally the north of England and in the English East Midlands with a flagship shop on Queen Street.

Scarborough power station supplied electricity to the town and the surrounding area from 1893 to 1958. It was owned and operated by the Scarborough Electric Supply Company Limited from 1893 to 1925, then by Scarborough Corporation until the nationalisation of utilities by the Attlee ministry in 1948. The coal-fired power station had an electricity generating capacity of 7 MW prior to its closure in October 1958.

===Creative industries===
Creative industries have been cited as playing a vital role in the regeneration of Scarborough; a report in 2005 estimated that they comprised 19% of the town&#x27;s economy. They were also a major focus of Scarborough&#x27;s winning entry in the 2008 Enterprising Britain competition, with representatives from Woodend Creative Workspace and Scarborough-based Electric Angel Design representing the town in the Yorkshire and Humber regional heats. In the finals in London on 16 October 2008, Scarborough won the title of Britain&#x27;s Most Enterprising Town, and subsequently went on to win the European Enterprise Awards as Great Britain&#x27;s representative, on 13 May 2009 in Prague.

In 2010 the town was the winner of the &#x27;Great Town Award&#x27;, as nominated by the Academy of Urbanism, beating Chester and Cambridge respectively.

===Healthcare===

Scarborough Hospital is the local district general NHS hospital. It is run by the York and Scarborough Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, and is the largest employer in the area employing over 2,400 staff. A review of acute healthcare in the town in 2019 identified problems recruiting staff at the hospital but promised to maintain the site&#x27;s Accident and Emergency department.

A new £47 million Emergency Department is under construction and is due to open in early 2024.

He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of the Staff Sergeant Bob Barnes in &quot;Platoon&quot; (1986). He is also known for playing Jake Taylor in the &quot;Major League&quot; films and Thomas Beckett in the &quot;Sniper&quot; films. Other films he appeared in include &quot;Looking for Mr. Goodbar&quot; (1977), &quot;The Dogs of War&quot; (1980), &quot;The Big Chill&quot; (1983), &quot;Eddie and the Cruisers&quot; (1983), &quot;Someone to Watch Over Me&quot; (1987), &quot;Betrayed&quot; (1988), &quot;The Field&quot; (1990), &quot;Sniper&quot; (1992), &quot;Gettysburg&quot; (1993), &quot;The Substitute&quot; (1996), &quot;Training Day&quot; (2001), and &quot;Inception&quot; (2010).

Berenger won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie for his performance as Jim Vance in the 2012 miniseries &quot;Hatfields &amp; McCoys&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Berenger was born as Thomas Michael Moore in Chicago, on May 31, 1949, to a Catholic family of Irish ancestry with his great-grandfather and grandmother settling in Chicago. He has a sister, Susan. His father was a printer for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; and a traveling salesman.

Moore graduated in 1967 from Rich East High School in Park Forest, Illinois. He studied journalism at the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri, but decided to seek an acting career following his graduation in 1971 with a Bachelor of Arts degree.

==Career==
He worked in regional theatre and in 1972, he worked as a flight attendant with Eastern Airlines, based in San Juan, Puerto Rico. He transferred to New York in 1973.

Moore selected &quot;Berenger&quot; as his professional name after he was forced to change his surname professionally, as there was already a &quot;Tom Moore&quot; in the Actors&#x27; Equity Association.

Berenger worked in soap operas and had a starring role as lawyer Tim Siegel on &quot;One Life to Live&quot;. His feature film debut was the lead in &quot;Rush It&quot; (1976), an independent film. In 1977, he had a small role as the killer of the lead character (played by Diane Keaton) in &quot;Looking for Mr. Goodbar&quot; based on the murder of schoolteacher Roseann Quinn. In 1978, he had a starring role in &quot;In Praise of Older Women&quot; for Avco-Embassy Pictures. In 1979, he played Butch Cassidy in &quot;Butch and Sundance: The Early Days&quot;, a role he got in part because of his resemblance to Paul Newman, who played the character in &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot; (1969).

Berenger starred in several significant films in the 1980s, including &quot;The Big Chill&quot; (1983), &quot;Eddie and the Cruisers&quot; (1983), &quot;Rustlers&#x27; Rhapsody&quot; (1985), &quot;Platoon&quot; (1986), &quot;Someone to Watch Over Me&quot; (1987), &quot;Shoot to Kill&quot; (1988), and &quot;Major League&quot; (1989). In 1986, he received an Academy Award nomination for his portrayal of the Staff Sergeant Barnes in &quot;Platoon&quot; (this performance won him a Golden Globe Award for &quot;Best Supporting Actor&quot;). A role for which he has become well known for is Thomas Beckett, the main character in the mid-1990s film &quot;Sniper&quot; (which would later be followed by six sequels, featuring Berenger in the starring role for four). Other notable films from that period in which he was featured include &quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot; (1989), &quot;Shattered&quot; (1991), &quot;Sliver&quot; (1993), and &quot;Chasers&quot; (1994). When asked in a 1999 interview to name his favorite film out of those in which he had acted, Berenger said it was too difficult to choose but that the one he had watched most frequently was his 1993 film &quot;Gettysburg&quot;, where he played the role of General James Longstreet.

He established the Tom Berenger Acting Scholarship Fund in 1988 to award theatre students for excellence in performance.

In more recent years, Berenger has continued to have an active acting career in film and television, although often at a supporting level. One of his most notable television appearances was on &quot;Cheers&quot; in its last season as Rebecca Howe&#x27;s blue collar-plumber love interest, for which he was nominated for an Emmy Award for &quot;Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series&quot;. He also began a career as a producer in the 1990s. Berenger co-produced the 1997 miniseries &quot;Rough Riders&quot;, also starring as Theodore Roosevelt.

Berenger was also seen on the box art and promotional content for Novalogic&#x27;s &quot;Delta Force: Black Hawk Down&quot;, as his roles in &quot;Sniper 2&quot; and &quot;Sniper 3&quot; were very similar to what was chosen for the game&#x27;s artwork. He starred in the mini-series version of Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;Nightmares &amp; Dreamscapes&quot;, as a celebrated author who realizes the warped painting he recently purchased is alive with illustrations of impending doom for him in &quot;The Road Virus Heads North&quot;. Berenger stars opposite Armand Assante and Busta Rhymes in the dramatic thriller &quot;Breaking Point&quot;, which had a limited release starting in December 2009.

Berenger appeared in the 2010 science fiction thriller &quot;Inception&quot; with Leonardo DiCaprio and Cillian Murphy, where he played a business executive who served as a mentor to and was an associate of the father of Murphy&#x27;s character. It was his first major film role since &quot;Training Day&quot; in 2001. In 2012, he appeared in the television miniseries &quot;Hatfields &amp; McCoys&quot; as Jim Vance, uncle of protagonist Devil Anse Hatfield (Kevin Costner). On September 23, 2012, Berenger won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie for the role.

In 2022, it was announced that Berenger would star in the comedy film &quot;Plan B&quot;, alongside Jon Heder and Shannon Elizabeth.2023 Lead role in Blood and Money as a loner hunter with a tragic past, while out hunting deer runs across a group of at large robbers with a large amount of cash.

==Personal life==
Berenger has been married four times and has six children. He has two children by his first wife, Barbara Wilson, to whom he was married from 1976 to 1984: Allison Moore (born 1977) and Patrick Moore (born 1979). He has three daughters by second wife Lisa Williams (to whom he was married from 1986 to 1997): Chelsea Moore (born 1986), Chloe Moore (born 1988) and Shiloh Moore (born 1993). He has a daughter named Scout Moore (born 1998) with Patricia Alvaran, to whom he was married from 1998 to 2011. He married Laura Moretti in Sedona, Arizona, in early September 2012.

<doc id="381572" wikidata="Q7639586" url="?curid=381572" title="Sunday Tribune">
<text>The Sunday Tribune was an Irish Sunday broadsheet newspaper published by Tribune Newspapers plc. It was edited in its final years by Nóirín Hegarty, who changed both the tone and the physical format of the newspaper from broadsheet to tabloid. Previous editors were Conor Brady, Vincent Browne, Peter Murtagh, Matt Cooper and Paddy Murray. The &quot;Sunday Tribune&quot; was founded in 1980, closed in 1982, relaunched in 1983 and entered receivership in February 2011 after which it ceased to trade.

==Foundation &amp; Collapse==
The newspaper was founded in 1980 by John Mulcahy as a tabloid with Conor Brady (later editor of &quot;The Irish Times&quot;) as its first editor. The format changed to broadsheet with the addition of a colour supplement magazine after the first year. It was moderately successful but its growing financial stability (it had not yet made a profit but was moving in that direction) was undermined when its then owner, Hugh McLaughlin, launched the financially misjudged downmarket tabloid &quot;Daily News&quot; in 1982. The &quot;News&quot; proved to be a publishing disaster, with poor quality printing, bad distribution, and misjudged content, and pulled its sister paper, the &quot;Tribune&quot;, down with it within weeks. The &quot;Tribune&quot; went into receivership.

===Relaunch===
The title was bought by Vincent Browne, who relaunched it in 1983 and became its editor. One of the shareholders was Tony Ryan.

==Investment &amp; Success==
The paper became one of Ireland&#x27;s most successful newspapers in the 1980s, eating into the market of &quot;The Sunday Press&quot;, which like other &quot;Press&quot; titles was hæmorrhaging readers through underfunding, an aging market and poor management decisions. Replicating McLoughlin&#x27;s mistake of a decade earlier, against advice Browne launched a new sister paper, the &quot;Dublin Tribune&quot;, which collapsed pulling the &quot;Sunday Tribune&quot; down with it.

It had a circulation of 65,717 and readership of 177,000 (5% of market) from Jan–June 2008.

The &quot;Dublin Tribune&quot;, though a commercial failure, was a breeding ground for a number of talented young journalists under the direction of editors Michael Hand and Rory Godson. These included Patricia Deevy, Diarmuid Doyle, Ursula Halligan, Nicola Byrne, Ronan Price, Richard Balls, Paul Howard, Colm Murphy, Brendan Fanning, Conn O Midheach, Rory Kerr, Ryle Nugent and Ed O&#x27;Loughlin who was on the shortlist for the Booker Prize for his novel &quot;Not Untrue And Not Unkind&quot;. Susan McKay joined the staff fulltime in 1992 first as social affairs correspondent and then as Northern Ireland editor.
The &quot;Sunday Tribune&quot; was saved from bankruptcy by Tony O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s Independent News and Media (then called Independent Newspapers plc), which acquired a 29.9 per cent stake in the company. Even before the investment the relationship between Browne and the board of the company had been contentious. In the aftermath of the &quot;Dublin Tribune&quot; debacle Browne was sacked as editor.

Browne was succeeded as editor by Peter Murtagh, a Dublin-born journalist formerly with &quot;The Irish Times&quot; who moved to London in 1985 and was news editor at &quot;The Guardian&quot;. Appointed &quot;Sunday Tribune&quot; editor in 1994, Murtagh had limited success, seeing early circulation growth dissipate and the paper starved of resources. He resigned after just over two years, telling journalists he could not secure sufficient investment from the Board. Later, he rejoined The Irish Times

After taking its 29.9 per cent stake, Independent Newspapers made an offer to increase its share to a majority level, however the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Desmond O&#x27;Malley, blocked the takeover attempt in 1992. Despite this, it is believed by many Irish business journalists that Independent Newspapers effectively control the &quot;Sunday Tribune&quot; via a series of loans.

Matt Cooper, a business journalist with O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s &quot;Irish Independent&quot; newspaper, succeeded Murtagh as editor from 1996 to 2003. When Cooper departed the &quot;Sunday Tribune&quot; in early 2003 and moved into broadcast journalism with Today FM radio station, he was succeeded by Paddy Murray, who was before and afterwards a columnist with the &quot;Sunday World&quot; newspaper.

Murray&#x27;s tenure was marked by a rise in circulation to well above 80,000, aided four or five times a year by classical music CD promotions. Readership under Murray reached 281,000 - its highest to date - according to the Joint National Readership Survey of
2005. That represented an 8.4 per cent share. During his time as editor, Murray launched a campaign in the paper to save the Gabhra Valley from destruction by the M3 motorway. The campaign was later dropped by the &quot;Sunday Tribune&quot;, but Murray kept it up in the &quot;Sunday World&quot;.

The paper was alone among Irish newspapers at the time, to come out strongly against the invasion of Iraq, Murray&#x27;s editorial predicting, accurately, that the invasion was akin to opening Pandora&#x27;s Box. Even around this time of relatively improved readership, the future of the newspaper was believed to be uncertain. It continued to survive in the increasingly competitive Irish newspaper for several more years, in part helped by the collapse of the &quot;Irish Press&quot; group, which removed its highly popular &quot;Sunday Press&quot; from the market. Though many of its readers would not necessarily have been politically close to the &quot;Sunday Tribune&quot;, they were closer to it than the main alternative, the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot;.

After Murray&#x27;s tenure as editor ended in January 2005 he was succeeded as &quot;Sunday Tribune&quot; editor by Noirin Hegarty, a former deputy editor at the INM-owned Dublin morning tabloid &quot;Evening Herald&quot;. Many journalists believe that in the following years, the &quot;Sunday Tribune&quot; moved closer to tabloid-style content in a bid to combat INM&#x27;s rival, Associated Newspapers&#x27; tabloid &quot;Irish Mail On Sunday&quot; newspaper, which launched in 2006. On 19 September 2010 it reverted to tabloid from broadsheet.

In 1983, 1988, 1994 and 2005 the Sunday Tribune published its Christmas edition on Friday 23 &amp; Saturday 24 December due to Sunday being Christmas Day.

==Final Closure==

On 1 February 2011 it was announced that the &quot;Sunday Tribune&quot; had gone into receivership, with fresh investment being sought by McStay Luby. The following day it was announced that there would be no further edition of the newspaper for four weeks. The last issue appeared on 30 January 2011. On 6 February 2011, the &quot;Irish Mail on Sunday&quot; committed a &quot;shameless&quot; crime when it allowed copies of its newspaper go on sale with an imitation &quot;Sunday Tribune&quot; cover. This plagiarism was &quot;denounced&quot; when it became public. The &quot;Irish Mail on Sunday&quot; was subsequently sued.
The paper was often humorously referred to as &quot;The Turbine&quot;, especially in the satirical magazine &quot;The Phoenix&quot;.

On 22 February 2011, following a review by the Receiver, in consultation with the management of the company, of the financial and risk areas of the &quot;Sunday Tribune&quot; it was decided that publication of the newspaper together with its online edition would be deferred during the sale process.

==Digital archive==
The &quot;Sunday Tribune&quot;&#x27;s archive from 1986 to 2005 was added to the British Newspaper Archive between November 2018 and February 2019.

<doc id="381579" wikidata="Q6017003" url="?curid=381579" title="Independent Pilots Association">
<text>The Independent Pilots Association (IPA) is the union representing the collective bargaining interests of over 3000 airline pilots employed by United Parcel Service (UPS). The organization was founded in 1990 and is headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, where UPS&#x27;s main air hub is located.

==Background and origin==
The Independent Pilots Association was established on the 10th of January, 1990, within the objective of serving as a mutual interests organization for professional pilots working for the United Parcel Service. Many pilots under UPS shared a consensus in doing so within years beforehand, before it finally arrived at fruition throughout the year before its foundation.

==IPA Foundation==
During the association&#x27;s early stages, the IPA leadership has felt it was relevant for the membership to be publicly represented in a philanthropic endeavour. This led to the Independent Pilots Association Foundation, or IPA Foundation, being formed in late 1993. The IPA Foundation formally became active in 1994, having functioned as distinguished from the IPA itself, financially sustained via members&#x27; donations. As a separate entity, the IPA Foundation conforms to existing labour laws as well as sec. 501(c)(3) of the IRS code. The organization has become tax-exempt in recent years.

==Affairs==
The IPA outlines its government mission statement as to &quot;promote global aviation safety and security and encourage continued economic growth for the aviation industry&quot;. The IPA is a member of The Coalition of Airline Pilots Associations - CAPA.

The IPA has filed suit on December 22, 2011, against the FAA to mandate new rest and duty regulations apply to all cargo airlines as well as passenger airlines.

The IPA operates under §501(c)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code. The organization is tax-exempt.

The IPA has outlined their endorsement of improving airline safety regulation as regards to lithium batteries in their &quot;Safer Skies&quot; programme.
==Historical actions==

The association honored the picket lines when the Teamsters went on strike in 1997 for 16 days.

<doc id="381580" wikidata="Q3049473" url="?curid=381580" title="Eir (telecommunications)">
<text>Eircom Limited, trading as Eir ( ; stylised eir), is a large fixed, mobile and broadband telecommunications company in Ireland. The company, which is currently incorporated in Jersey, traces its origins to Ireland&#x27;s former state-owned monopoly telecommunication provider Telecom Éireann and its predecessors, P&amp;T (the Dept. of Posts and Telegraphs) and before the foundation of the state, the telecommunications division of the GPO. It remains the largest telecommunications operator in Ireland and has overseas operations focused on the business and corporate telecom markets in the United Kingdom. 
The company was in majority state ownership until 1999, when it was privatised through a flotation on the Irish and New York Stock Exchanges.

Eir is currently majority owned by Xavier Niel&#x27;s Iliad SA and his Paris-based NJJ Telecom Europe investment fund (64.5%). The group includes French telecommunications provider Free and Iliad Italia. Other major investors include Anchorage Capital Group (26.6%), and Davidson Kempner (8.9%).

Eir operates a wholesale fixed-line network through its Open Eir unit, providing copper and fibre based access products to a wide range of Irish telecommunications companies. Its services include next generation access products, such as FTTH, FTTC (VDSL) and legacy copper based services, including ADSL and classic digital circuit switched products like PSTN and ISDN. It also offers a range of legacy leased line services.

The company&#x27;s retail division markets these services directly to homes and businesses, and includes value added services like Eir TV and voice over broadband for home users and a wide range of digital services tailored to business customers.

Eir operates a national mobile network both under its own Eir brand and GoMo, a value-focused, online-only sub-brand. The network provides 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G services and ancillary services such as WiFi Calling and VoLTE.

==Market share==
In the third quarter of 2019, Eir accounted for 39% of the Ireland&#x27;s fixed voice market retail revenue and 45.3% market share by fixed-line retail and wholesale revenue and 19.1% of the mobile market (excluding mobile broadband and machine-to-machine subscriptions) or 15.6% of total subscriptions. Eir had 31.4% of fixed broadband subscriptions (comprising FTTH, FTTC/VDSL and ADSL) and 42.7% of FTTP subscriptions.

Its main fixed access infrastructure owning competitors are Virgin Media Ireland (which operates a cable TV and broadband network) and SIRO, a joint venture between publicly owned energy supplier, ESB and Vodafone. SIRO operates a FTTH network using ESB&#x27;s physical infrastructure to carry fibres to individual homes and businesses. Imagine Communications, Digiweb and several other smaller ISPs also operate their own wireless networks using various technologies. Eir also faces retail competition from Vodafone, Sky, Digiweb and a large number of smaller ISPs using a mix wholesale access from Open Eir and SIRO to reach their customers.

Eir also faces competition from mobile operators and MVNOs both for its own mobile services and also as fixed line replacement products. All mobile operators are capable of offering very competitive voice services and high speed 4G and increasingly 5G connectivity, which can often be faster than fixed services, particularly first generation NGA products using VDSL and fibre to cabinet, which can only offer a maximum of 100 Mbit/s. ADSL services which are much slower again. 4G and 5G fixed-mobile services, using routers and external antennae have also become viable competitors in many rural and quasi rural areas. These offer ample and affordable data plans and very high speeds and a number of operators have designed products targeting homes and businesses using both existing mobile and dedicated LTE and 5G networks.

==Services==

Eir operates the largest fixed-line telecommunications network in Ireland, under licence from the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg). Most homes and businesses in the state are dependent on their network. A range of telecommunications services is provided on the network including Business IP, its MPLS platform. Eir have also completed a wholly owned fibre network ring around Northern Ireland and another around Belfast. Their ISP division, Eir Net, provides dial-up services, as well as broadband services (see broadband roll-out, below). Any alarm-monitoring products using SMS are &quot;hardcoded&quot; to work with Eir&#x27;s SMSC, so will not work on Digiweb, BT, Smart, UPC or Magnet phone networks. DECT SMS handsets are also preprogrammed for Eir&#x27;s SMSC. Any competing phone service that is not just carrier pre-selection (CPS) of Eir must provide their own SMSC, but even when they do, consumers may be unable to migrate from Eir due to SMSC numbers in equipment that cannot be reprogrammed.

Eir&#x27;s mobile arm provides a full range of 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G-based mobile communication services throughout Ireland. Its GSM network operates at 1800 MHz and 900 MHz ranges, as the earlier GSM licences fully utilised the 900 MHz band. GPRS and EDGE data services are also available. Eir mobile provide both bill pay (contract) and prepay (non-contract) plans and has approximately 19% of the Irish mobile market, with 1,032,000 cellular subscribers on the Eir Mobile network. The company has used EDGE technology on its network and has received a 3G (UMTS) license, formally removed from Eir&#x27;s competitor, Smart Telecom.

As an operator with significant market power, Eir is required to provide a number of wholesale products to other operators and to switch calls onto other phone networks. Many broadband products offered by other operators are resales of the Eir product.

==History==

The company was formed in 1984 as Bord Telecom Éireann, under the Posts and Telecommunications Act 1983. (This article deals mainly with the post-privatisation Eir; for details of the company during its time as a state-sponsored body, see Telecom Éireann.)
From 1991 to 2013, Eir&#x27;s subsidiaries included Phonewatch, then known as Eircom Phonewatch, which provides home monitoring services, monitored burglar-alarms, fire alarms, CCTV systems, and medical alert devices. In May 2013, it announced that Phonewatch had been sold to Oslo-based company, &quot;Sector Alarm Corporation&quot;.

From 1999 to 2006 sponsored RTE Weather and from 2000 to 2008, Eircom sponsored the League of Ireland.

Although EU laws required the opening of the Irish telecommunications market, Ireland had a derogation from competition until 2003. Telecom Éireann was privatised; the process began in 1995, and by July 1999 the government had disposed of virtually all of its shareholding. This was very controversial and subject to much debate. Eircom plc was then floated on the Irish, London and New York Stock Exchanges on 8 July 1999, and small/first-time investors were encouraged by the Irish Government to buy shares. The share price was set at €3.90, later reaching a high of €4.80, a 23% increase. Those initial investors who held onto their shares, until July 2000, received a 4% bonus-share allocation.

The Eircom flotation is considered to have been an example of a stock market bubble — after the initial hype of the flotation died down, the stock price fell rapidly. Many of the 500,000 small investors were angered by the significant financial loss they incurred, blaming the government for not sufficiently warning them of the risks inherent in stock-market investment.

Eircom was designated by ComReg as the organisation with ownership of the National Directory Database (NDD) and a Universal White Pages (UWP) directory; the unit within Eircom responsible for providing these was the National Directory Information Unit (NDIU). 
In December 2019 this agreement expired and ComReg extended the management of the NDD to all current providers, Eir did not declined to propose extending the agreement. A Dutch company PortingXS became the subsequent manager of the NDD as it was the only provider that flagged an interest.

===Disposal of Eircell, going private and reflotation===

In 2001, Eircom sold its mobile subsidiary Eircell to Vodafone. The company was transferred to a separate entity, Eircell 2000 plc which was then sold to Vodafone through a share swap. Eircom shareholders got Eircell share in a 1000/1 ratio. The conversion rate was then 0.9478 Vodafone shares for every 2 Eircell 2000 shares. This left the Eircom shareholder with shares in both Eircom and Vodafone.

After the sale of Eircell, Eircom itself was believed to be undervalued and became the subject of a bidding war between two consortia: the E-Island consortium headed by Denis O&#x27;Brien, and the Valentia Consortium headed by Tony O&#x27;Reilly, the chairman of Independent News and Media. Eventually in November 2001, the company agreed to a recommended offer of €1.335 per Eircom share. Eircom Plc was delisted from the stock exchange, became Eircom Limited, a private limited company by shares and a subsidiary of Valentia, and O&#x27;Reilly took the reins as Executive chairman.

On 19 March 2004, the company returned to the stock market (although the company being listed, Eircom Group plc, was in fact a new holding company, and was registered in England and Wales rather than in Ireland). The company floated at €1.55 a share, but dipped on initial trading before recovering to trade above its float price.

===Return to mobile, acquisition of Meteor===

In early 2005, several Irish newspapers reported that Meteor Mobile Communications, the third mobile phone operator, was up for sale by its owners, Western Wireless. It was considered that this afforded Eircom an opportunity to re-enter the mobile communications market. On 9 July 2005, &quot;The Irish Times&quot; reported three bidders for Meteor: Eircom, Smart Telecom, and a consortium led by Denis O&#x27;Brien. On 14 July 2005 RTÉ News reported on their business website that Denis O&#x27;Brien had withdrawn from bidding, and that it was understood that Eircom was the top bidder at €410 million. On 21 July, it was announced that Smart Telecom had also withdrawn, leaving Eircom as the sole bidder. Eircom announced the agreement to purchase it on 25 July 2005 at a cost of €420m. As of 31 December 2012, Meteor had over 1,086,000 customers and a market share of 20%, offering both GSM and 3G mobile telephony and broadband services.

In May 2006, Eircom announced its sale to the Australian investment group Babcock &amp; Brown as part of a deal worth €2.4 billion. The Employee Share Ownership Trust, which represents workers at the company, was to remain a minority shareholder. The sale was approved by shareholders on 26 July 2006, and at close of business on 17 August 2006, the shares were delisted from the Official Lists of the Irish Stock Exchange and the London Stock Exchange, ending Eircom&#x27;s second period on the stock markets. The same day, Phillip Nolan resigned as chief executive of Eircom, and on 1 September Rex Comb was officially named as the new CEO. Tony O&#x27;Reilly resigned as chairman and was replaced by Pierre Danon, previously of BT Group plc and JP Morgan Chase.
Babcock &amp; Brown have since collapsed as a company and their BCM vehicle, which owns over 50% of Eir, broke all ties with the former parent and rebranded themselves as Eircom Holdings Limited.

Eircom was also successful in bidding for a 4G LTE License from Comreg, which permitted Meteor and eMobile to launch 4G services in 2013.

In September 2015, Eircom announced that it would re-brand as eir as part of a new imaging campaign developed by Moving Brands. Described as being &quot;dynamic and modern&quot;, the new brand was adopted across most of Eircom&#x27;s businesses (excluding Meteor), and an advertising campaign was introduced to promote the new name and slogan, &quot;Live life on eir&quot;.

In December 2017, Iliad SA announced that it would be acquiring a 32.9% stake in the company with an option to take control of the Irish operator through a call option, which is exercisable in 2024.

=== Acquisition of Setanta Sports and launch of Eir Sport ===

Eir Sport commenced broadcasting on 5 July 2016 following the takeover of Setanta Sports by Eir. Two Irish commercial stations, Eir Sport 1 (formerly Setanta Ireland) and Eir Sport 2 (formerly Setanta Sports 1), join BT Sport 1, BT Sport 2, BT Sport Europe and BT Sport ESPN to make up the 6 channel Eir Sport pack. Setanta Sports was formed in 1990 to facilitate the broadcasting of Irish sporting events to international audiences.

In May 2021, it was announced that eir Sport would cease operations by the end of 2021.

==Businesses==

===Mobile===

Eir operates a full service mobile telephone network across Ireland providing full 5G connectivity as well as 4G, 3G and 2G services.

Eircom purchased Ireland&#x27;s 3rd mobile network, Meteor in 2005 initially operating it as a separate brand, with a secondary brand eMobile used to complement Eircom landline products.

The Meteor brand was subsequently dropped, and the mobile network became a core part of the main Eir brand.

=== Eir Business Ireland ===
Eir Business Ireland is the corporate and SME operations in the Ireland. Eir Business sponsored Irish sporting events including the &quot;Dubai Duty Free Irish Open&quot; in the K Club. It secured business contracts with Druids Glen a Golf Resort in County Wicklow. Customers include University College Dublin (UCD), Ordnance Survey Ireland and Dublin City Council.

===Eir Business NI===
Eir Business NI is the name of the company&#x27;s operations in Northern Ireland. With the division based in Belfast, Eir own and operate a fibre-optic network ring around Belfast and Northern Ireland, linking into the national Eir Network in the rest of Ireland. Eir Business NI have won significant contracts thus far, the largest being the €70m &quot;Network NI&quot; contract for the Northern Ireland Civil Service, with other significant contracts as operator of choice for Northern Ireland Schools and Libraries, NIE, Viridian, Wright Group, Chain Reaction Cycles and many more large enterprise brands. The company in Northern Ireland provides services to local government and SME sectors.

===Television===

As Telecom Éireann, Eir owned 75% of the cable operator Cablelink (the other 25% was owned by RTÉ). Cablelink was sold to NTL in 1999 and subsequently bought by UPC.

As Eircom, Eir joined a consortium with TV3 Group, Arqiva, and Setanta Sports called OneVision to apply for the Commercial licence for DTT. On 1 May 2009 Fintan Drury, chairman of the OneVision consortium, announced that OneVision was to enter negotiations with the BCI, with the view to take over operations of the Irish pay DTT service. It was hoped that the launch of OneVision would happen in late 2010/early 2011 at a proposed operation cost of €40 million. OneVision aspired to offer 23 channels coinciding with the free-to-air channels. However, OneVision subsequently dropped out of negotiations with the BCI.

In 2013 Eir began providing a TV service along with its Eir Fibre service called Eir Vision.

==Examinership==
Eircom notified the public in February 2012 that they had decided to no longer honour their debt, had entered default status and would not continue as a going concern. Eircom gave notification that they had cancelled a mandatory interest payment on their publicly-traded senior corporate bond, then due to mature in 2016.

On 29 March 2012, a number of companies within the Eircom Group presented a petition to the Irish High Court for the appointment of an examiner. The examinership lasted until 11 June 2012; the restructuring removed €1.7 billion of debt from the balance sheet, a reduction of 40% of group debt.

==Competition==

Eir retains the largest share of the fixed line market in Ireland, with 27.6% of the broadband market, 32.7% of the FTTP market, 38.9% of fixed line retail and wholesale revenues and 44.3% of fixed line voice subscriptions, with competition from Virgin Media Ireland, BT Ireland, Vodafone Ireland, Sky Ireland and a number of smaller players including Digiweb.

The company is the third largest player in the Irish mobile market, with 23% of the market, behind Three Ireland 29.3% and Vodafone Ireland 33.9%
(These figures exclude mobile broadband and machine to machine communications).

==Controversy==
After the privatisation of Telecom Éireann, the highly profitable mobile phone division, Eircell, was sold to Vodafone. Some consider this act to be asset stripping by the large investors with interests in what later became Eircom.

Eircom announced in June 2007 that from 30 July line rental charges would increase by €1.18 bringing line rental charges - already the most expensive in Europe - to a total of €25.36 per month for a PSTN analogue line, one source indicated it was the highest line-rental charge in the world. Also announced was an increase of between 4.8 and 4.9% on local and national calls.

In March 2011, Eircom pleaded guilty to a breach of the Data Protection Act at the Dublin District Court.

On 12 April 2018, Eir announced that they would cut 750 jobs. This would mean that 10,000 jobs would have been lost since its peak number of jobs of 13,000 The job cuts came just days after the takeover of the company by French entrepreneur Xavier Niel.

===Copyright enforcement===

====Blocking of the Pirate Bay====
On 21 April 2008, Eircom rejected claims by four major record companies that it, as the largest broadband internet service provider in the state, must bear some liability for the illegal free downloading of music by computer users. Eir have thus far managed to come to an agreement with the companies involved, stating that they will be working in conjunction with these companies to prevent large amounts of copyrighted material being shared through the ISP. This in turn raised concerns over internet privacy, since presumably this would be enforced through the monitoring of IP traffic associated with Eir&#x27;s customers. It is not known whether or not this bears any significance on the Meteor Mobile network, a mobile broadband supplier acquired by Eir. Eircom has reportedly signed an out-of-court settlement with said companies and are initiating a program to clamp down on piracy, within their network, by instituting an IP monitoring service, accessible by the Irish Recorded Music Association (IRMA) and allowing up to three warnings before disconnection of service.

As of 5 December 2013, Eir users who try to access The Pirate Bay receive the following message:

: &quot;On the 24 July 2009, an Order was made by the High Court requiring Eircom to block or otherwise disable access by its subscribers to the website thePirateBay.org, its related domain names, IP addresses and URLs. The Court was satisfied that on the basis of the evidence presented by the record companies that the PirateBay website is a website that facilitates the exchange of copyrighted sound recordings without the consent of the copyright owners.

: &quot;Eircom recognises the legitimate rights of the owners of copyrighted material and believes that individuals who share or download copyrighted material without the authorisation or the permission of the copyright owner are acting illegally.

: &quot;The Order further provides that should the PirateBay website content be legitimatised in the future, then Eircom has liberty to apply to the Court to have the Order vacated and access to the PirateBay website enabled.&quot;

====Disconnection====
Eircom agreed to a controversial deal with the IRMA to activate a &quot;three strikes system&quot; so that users would be banned from the Internet for seven days if they appeared to be downloading copyrighted content through peer to peer filesharing networks.

<text>George Charles de Hevesy (born György Bischitz; ; ; 1 August 1885 – 5 July 1966) was a Hungarian radiochemist and Nobel Prize in Chemistry laureate, recognized in 1943 for his key role in the development of radioactive tracers to study chemical processes such as in the metabolism of animals. He also co-discovered the element hafnium.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Hevesy György was born in Budapest, Hungary, to a wealthy and ennobled family of Hungarian-Jewish descent, the fifth of eight children to his parents Lajos Bischitz and Baroness Eugénia (Jenny) Schossberger (ennobled as &quot;De Tornya&quot;). Grandparents from both sides of the family had provided the presidents of the Jewish community of Pest. His parents converted to Roman Catholicism. George grew up in Budapest and graduated high school in 1903 from Piarist Gimnázium. The family&#x27;s name in 1904 was Hevesy-Bischitz, and Hevesy later changed his own.

De Hevesy began his studies in chemistry at the University of Budapest for one year, and at the Technische Hochschule in Charlottenburg (now Technische Universität Berlin) for several months, but transferred to the University of Freiburg. There he met Ludwig Gattermann. In 1906, he started his Ph.D. thesis with Georg Franz Julius Meyer, acquiring his doctorate in physics in 1908. In 1908, Hevesy was offered a position at the ETH Zürich, Switzerland, yet being independently wealthy, he was able to choose his research environment. He worked first with Fritz Haber in Karlsruhe, Germany, then with Ernest Rutherford in Manchester, England, where he also met Niels Bohr. Back at home in Budapest, he was appointed professor in physical chemistry in 1918. In 1920, he settled in Copenhagen.

===Research===
In 1922, de Hevesy co-discovered (with Dirk Coster) the element hafnium (72Hf) (Latin &quot;Hafnia&quot; for &quot;Copenhagen&quot;, the home town of Niels Bohr). Mendeleev&#x27;s 1869 periodic table arranged the chemical elements into a logical system, but a chemical element with 72 protons was missing. Hevesy determined to look for that element on the basis of Bohr&#x27;s atomic model. The mineralogical museum of Norway and Greenland in Copenhagen furnished the material for the research. Characteristic X-ray spectra recordings made of the sample indicated that a new element was present. The accepted account has been disputed by Mansel Davies and Eric Scerri who attribute the prediction that element 72 would be a transition element to the chemist Charles Bury.

Supported financially by the Rockefeller Foundation, Hevesy had a very productive year. He developed the X-ray fluorescence analytical method, and discovered the samarium alpha-ray. It was here he began the use of radioactive isotopes in studying the metabolic processes of plants and animals, by tracing chemicals in the body by replacing part of stable isotopes with small quantities of the radioactive isotopes. In 1923, Hevesy published the first study on the use of the naturally radioactive 212Pb as radioactive tracer to follow the absorption and translocation in the roots, stems and leaves of &quot;Vicia faba&quot;, also known as the broad bean. Later, in 1943, the work on radioactive tracing would earn Hevesy the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

In 1924, Hevesy returned to Freiburg as Professor of Physical Chemistry. In 1930, he went to Cornell University, Ithaca as Baker Lecturer. In 1934, after the Nazis came to power in Germany, he returned to Niels Bohr&#x27;s Institute at the University of Copenhagen. In 1936, he invented Neutron Activation Analysis. In 1943 he fled to Stockholm (Sweden being neutral during the war), where he an associate of the Institute of Research in Organic Chemistry. In 1949 he was elected Franqui Professor in the University of Ghent. In his retirement, he remained an active scientific associate of the University of Stockholm.

==World War II and beyond==
Prior to the onset of World War II, Max von Laue and James Franck had sent their gold Nobel Prize medals to Denmark to keep them from being confiscated by the Nazis. After the Nazi invasion of Denmark this placed them in danger; it was illegal at the time to send gold out of Germany, and were it discovered that Laue and Franck had done so, they could have faced prosecution. To prevent this, de Hevesy concealed the medals by dissolving them in aqua regia and placing the resulting solution on a shelf in his laboratory at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen. After the war, he returned to find the solution undisturbed and precipitated the gold out of the acid. The Nobel Society then recast the medals using the recovered gold and returned them to the two laureates.

By 1943, Copenhagen was no longer safe for a Jewish scientist and de Hevesy fled to Sweden, where he worked at the University of Stockholm until 1961. In Stockholm, de Hevesy was received at the department of chemistry by the Swedish professor and Nobel Prize winner Hans von Euler-Chelpin, who remained strongly pro-German throughout the war. Despite this, de Hevesy and von Euler-Chelpin collaborated on many scientific papers during and after the war.

While in Stockholm, de Hevesy received the Nobel Prize in chemistry. He was later inducted into the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and received the Copley Medal, of which he was particularly proud. De Hevesy stated: &quot;The public thinks the Nobel Prize in chemistry for the highest honor that a scientist can receive, but it is not so. Forty or fifty have received Nobel chemistry prizes, but there are only ten foreign members of the Royal Swedish Academy, and only two have received a Copley.&quot; (Bohr was the other one.) He received the Atoms for Peace Award in 1958 for his peaceful use of radioactive isotopes.

==Family life and death==
De Hevesy married Pia Riis in 1924. They had one son and three daughters together, one of whom (Eugenie) married a grandson of the Swedish Nobel laureate Svante Arrhenius. De Hevesy died in 1966 at the age of eighty and was buried in Freiburg. In 2000, his body was moved to the Kerepesi Cemetery in Budapest, Hungary. He had published a total of 397 scientific documents, one of which was the Becquerel-Curie Memorial Lecture, in which he had reminisced about the careers of pioneers of radiochemistry. At his family&#x27;s request, his ashes were interred at his birthplace in Budapest on 19 April 2001.

On 10 May 2005 the Hevesy Laboratory was founded at Risø National Laboratory for Sustainable Energy, now Technical University of Denmark, DTU Nutech. It was named after George de Hevesy as the father of the isotope tracer principle under the initiative of the lab&#x27;s first director, Prof. Mikael Jensen.

<text>Whitby Abbey was a 7th-century Christian monastery that later became a Benedictine abbey. The abbey church was situated overlooking the North Sea on the East Cliff above Whitby in North Yorkshire, England, a centre of the medieval Northumbrian kingdom. The abbey and its possessions were confiscated by the crown under Henry VIII during the Dissolution of the Monasteries between 1536 and 1545.

Since that time, the ruins of the abbey have continued to be used by sailors as a landmark at the headland. Since the 20th century, the substantial ruins of the church have been declared a Grade I Listed building and are in the care of English Heritage. The site museum is housed in Cholmley House, a 17th century banqueting hall repurposed by design studio Stanton Williams in 2002.

== Streoneshalh==
The first monastery was founded in 657 AD by the Anglo-Saxon era King of Northumbria, Oswy (Oswiu) as Streoneshalh (the older name for Whitby). He appointed Lady Hilda, abbess of Hartlepool Abbey and grand-niece of Edwin, the first Christian king of Northumbria, as founding abbess. The name Streoneshalh is thought to signify &quot;Fort Bay&quot; or &quot;Tower Bay&quot;, in reference to a supposed Roman settlement that previously existed on the site. This contention has never been proven and alternative theories have been proposed, such as the name meaning &quot;Streona&#x27;s settlement&quot;. Some believe that the name referred to Eadric Streona, but Streona died in 1017 so the naming of Streoneshalh would have preceded his birth by several hundred years.

The double monastery of monks and nuns was home (614–680) to the great Northumbrian poet Cædmon.

In 664 the Synod of Whitby took place at the monastery to resolve the question of whether the Northumbrian church would adopt and follow the Easter dating of Iona (the 84-year cycle which had previously been used at Rome and on the continent) or the new 19-year cycle which had recently been adopted at Rome. There was also discussion of what kind of tonsure clergy and monks should use. The decision, with the support of King Oswy, was for adopting the newer Roman Easter calculation - as was used in other English kingdoms to the south.

Streoneshalch monastery was laid waste by Danes in successive raids between 867 and 870 under Ingwar and Ubba and remained desolate for more than 200 years. A locality named &#x27;Prestebi&#x27; was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086, which may be a sign that religious life was revived in some form after the Danish raids; &#x27;Witebi&#x27; (Whitby) is also mentioned. In Old Norse, Prestebi means a habitation of priests. The old monastery given to Reinfrid comprised about 40 ruined &quot;monasteria vel oratoria&quot;, similar to Irish monastic ruins with numerous chapels and cells.

==Whitby==
Reinfrid, a soldier of William the Conqueror, became a monk and travelled to Streoneshalh, which was then known as &quot;Prestebi&quot; or &quot;Hwitebi&quot; (the &quot;white settlement&quot; in Old Norse). He approached William de Percy for a grant of land, who gave him the ruined monastery of St. Peter with two carucates of land, to found a new monastery. Serlo de Percy, the founder&#x27;s brother, joined Reinfrid at the new monastery, which followed the Benedictine rule. The greater part of de Percy&#x27;s building was pulled down and the monastery was rebuilt on a larger scale in the 1220s.

The Benedictine abbey thrived for centuries as a centre of learning. This second monastery was destroyed by Henry VIII in 1540 during the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The abbey was bought by Sir Richard Cholmley. It remained in the Cholmley family and their descendants, the Strickland family. The Strickland family passed it to the UK government in 1920. The ruins are now owned and maintained by English Heritage.

In December 1914, Whitby Abbey was shelled by the German battlecruisers &quot;Von der Tann&quot; and &quot;Derfflinger&quot;, whose crew &quot;were aiming for the Coastguard Station on the end of the headland.&quot; Scarborough and Hartlepool were also attacked. The abbey buildings sustained considerable damage during the ten-minute attack.

==Abbey possessions==
The original gift of William de Percy included not only the monastery of St. Peter at Streoneshalch, but the town and Port of Whitby, with its parish church of St Mary and six dependent chapels at Fyling, Hawsker, Sneaton, Ugglebarnby, Dunsley, and Aislaby; five mills including Ruswarp; the village of Hackness with two mills and the parish church of St. Mary; and the church of St Peter at Hackness, &quot;where our monks served God, died, and were buried,&quot; and various other gifts enumerated in the Memorial in the abbot&#x27;s book.

==Priors and abbots==
The first prior of the reestablished monastery, Reinfrid, ruled for many years before being killed in an accident. He was buried at St Peter&#x27;s at Hackness, now in North Yorkshire. He was succeeded as prior by Serlo de Percy.

==&quot;Dracula&quot;==
Bram Stoker&#x27;s 1897 novel &quot;Dracula&quot; featured Count Dracula as a creature resembling a large dog which came ashore at the headland and ran up the 199 steps to the graveyard of St Mary&#x27;s Church in the shadow of the Whitby Abbey ruins. The abbey is also described in Mina Harker&#x27;s diary in the novel:

<text>The Serbo-Croatian standard languages (Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian and Montenegrin) have one of the more elaborate [[kinship terminology|kinship]] (&quot;srodstvo&quot;) systems among European languages. Terminology may differ from place to place. Most words are common to other Slavic languages, though some derive from Turkish. The standardized languages may recognize slightly different pronunciations or dialectical forms; all terms are considered standard in all language standards, unless otherwise marked: [S] (Serbian), [C] (Croatian), [B] (Bosnian) and [M] (Montenegrin) below.

There are four main types of kinship in the family: biological blood kinship, kinship by law (in-laws), spiritual kinship (such as godparents), and legal kinship through adoption and remarriage.

As is common in many rural family structures, three generations of a family will live together in a home in what anthropologists call a joint family structure, where parents, their son(s), and grandchildren would cohabit in a family home.

==Direct descendance and ancestry==
Words for relations up to five generations removed—great-great-grandparents and great-great-grandchildren—are in common use. The fourth-generation terms are also used as generics for ancestors and descendants. There is no distinction between the maternal and paternal line. 

==Own generation==
Diminutive forms of siblings are used for cousins.

==Indirect ancestry, descendants and legal relations==
There are separate terms for maternal and paternal uncles, but not for aunts. In addition, spouses of uncles and aunts have their own terms.

==In-laws==
There are separate terms for a man&#x27;s and a woman&#x27;s parents-in-law. However, the same terms are commonly used for siblings-in-law and children-in-law. There are separate terms for co-siblings-in-law.

==Step-relatives==
There are spouses of ancestors that are not blood relatives and their spouse&#x27;s descendants, second spouse of father&#x27;s or mother&#x27;s siblings (paternal or maternal step-aunts and step-uncles) and their children.
==Foster-relatives==
Foster relations are important and have dedicated terms.

<text>The Churches of God, General Conference (Winebrenner) (CGGC) is an Evangelical Christian denomination in the United States originating in the revivalism and evangelistic efforts of John Winebrenner.

==History==
John Winebrenner (1797–1860) was ordained on September 28, 1820, as a minister of the German Reformed Church, a Calvinist body. He was given charge of four congregations in the Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, area. Winebrenner labored extensively in revival meetings, but some of the members opposed what they considered &quot;unusual efforts for the conversion of sinners.&quot; In 1828 the General Synod of the German Reformed Church dropped him from its roster of ministers, in response to such complaints. In July 1830, Winebrenner was rebaptized by immersion by Jacob Erb. That year, he and co-laborers sympathetic with his efforts met and organized the General Eldership of the Church of God. Representatives from various denominations were present, and the new organization reflected that diversity.

In the early years of the Church of God, its members were popularly called Winebrennerians, after their founder. The official name was changed to the General Eldership of the Churches of God in North America in 1845, and to its present title in 1975.

The church reported 336 congregations with 32,208 members in 2000, principally in Pennsylvania and the Midwest.

==Organization and theology==
The basic theology of the Churches of God is Arminian, conservative, and Evangelical. The church observes three ordinances: baptism by immersion, the Lord&#x27;s Supper (taken in the evening, while seated), and feet washing. The Bible is the church&#x27;s only rule of faith and practice. 

The CGGC has a presbyterian polity. The church is divided into regional conferences, with headquarters in Findlay, Ohio.

<text>Lester Joseph Gillis (December 6, 1908 – November 27, 1934), also known as George Nelson and Baby Face Nelson, was an American bank robber who became a criminal partner of John Dillinger when he helped Dillinger escape from prison in Crown Point, Indiana. Later, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced that Nelson and the remaining gang of bank robbers were collectively &quot;Public Enemy Number One&quot;.

The &quot;Baby Face Nelson&quot; nickname derived from Gillis being a short man with a youthful appearance; however, in the professional realm, Gillis&#x27;s fellow criminals addressed him as &quot;Jimmy&quot;. A violent bank robber, Lester Joseph Gillis has killed more agents of the FBI than any other criminal. FBI agents fatally wounded Baby Face Nelson in The Battle of Barrington (27 November 1934), fought in a suburb of Chicago.

==Early life==

Nelson was born Lester Joseph Gillis, a son of Flemish Belgian immigrants on December 6, 1908, in Chicago, Illinois. He was arrested on July 4, 1921, at the age of twelve, after he accidentally shot a playmate in the jaw with a pistol that he had found. He served over a year in the state reformatory.

==Criminal career==

===Gang affiliation===
By the time he met his future wife Helen Wawrzyniak, Nelson was working at a Standard Oil station in his neighborhood which doubled as the headquarters for a group of young tire thieves, known colloquially as &quot;strippers&quot;. Nelson fell into association with the &quot;strippers&quot;, and acquainted himself with a number of local criminals, including one who employed him to drive bootleg alcohol throughout the Chicago suburbs. Nelson became associated with members of the suburb-based Touhy Gang.

===Armed robbery===
Within two years, Nelson and the gang were involved in organized crime, especially armed robbery. On January 6, 1930, the associates forced entry into the home of magazine executive Charles M. Richter. After trussing him up with adhesive tape and cutting the phone lines, they ransacked the house and made off with approximately $205,000 worth of jewelry (equivalent to approximately $ million in dollars). Two months later, they carried out a similar robbery at the bungalow of Lottie Brenner Von Buelow (on Sheridan Road). This job netted approximately $50,000 worth of jewelry. After the crime, Chicago newspapers nicknamed the group &quot;The Tape Bandits&quot;.

===Bank robbery===
On April 21, 1930, Nelson robbed a bank for the first time, making off with approximately $4,000. A month later, he and his gang netted $25,000 worth of jewelry from home invasions. On October 3, Nelson robbed the Itasca State Bank of $4,600; a teller later identified him as one of the robbers. Three nights later, he stole the jewelry of the wife of Chicago mayor Big Bill Thompson, valued at $18,000. She described her attacker, saying &quot;He had a baby face. He was good looking, hardly more than a boy, had dark hair and was wearing a gray topcoat and a brown felt hat, turned down brim.&quot; Nelson and his crew were later linked to a botched roadhouse robbery in Summit, Illinois, on November 23, 1930. In the ensuing gunfight, three people were killed and three wounded. Three nights later, Nelson&#x27;s gang robbed a tavern on Waukegan Road, and Nelson committed his first murder of note when he fatally shot stockbroker Edwin R. Thompson.

==1931–1932==
Throughout the winter of 1931, most of the Tape Bandits were rounded up, including Nelson. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; referred to their leader as &quot;George &#x27;Baby Face&#x27; Nelson&quot; who received a sentence of one year to life in the state penitentiary at Joliet. Nelson escaped during a prison transfer in February 1932. Aided by his contacts within the Touhy Gang, Nelson fled west to Reno, where he was harbored by William Graham, a known crime boss and gambler. Using the alias &quot;Jimmy Johnson&quot;, Nelson went to Sausalito, California, where he worked for bootlegger Joe Parente. During his San Francisco Bay area criminal ventures, Nelson met John Paul Chase and Fatso Negri, who later became close associates. In Reno the next winter, Nelson first met the vacationing Alvin Karpis, who in turn introduced him to Midwestern bank robber Eddie Bentz. Teaming up with Bentz, Nelson returned to the Midwest the next summer. He committed a major bank robbery in Grand Haven, Michigan, on August 18, 1933; his first in the area. The robbery was not lucrative, though most of those involved made a full escape.

==Gang leader==
The Grand Haven bank robbery convinced Nelson he was ready to lead his own gang. Through connections at the Green Lantern Tavern in St. Paul, Nelson recruited Homer Van Meter, Tommy Carroll, and Eddie Green. With these men and two other local thieves, Nelson robbed the First National Bank of Brainerd, Minnesota, of $32,000 on October 23, 1933 (equivalent to approximately $ in dollars). Witnesses reported that Nelson wildly sprayed sub-machine gun bullets at bystanders as he made his getaway. After collecting his wife Helen and four-year-old son Ronald, Nelson left with his crew for San Antonio, Texas. While there, Nelson and his gang bought several weapons from underworld gunsmith Hyman Lehman. One of those weapons was a .38 Super Colt pistol that had been modified so it was fully automatic. Nelson used this gun to kill Special Agent W. Carter Baum at Little Bohemia Lodge several months later.

On December 9, 1933, a local woman tipped off San Antonio police regarding the presence nearby of &quot;high-powered Northern gangsters&quot;. Two days later, Tommy Carroll was cornered by two detectives and opened fire, killing Detective H.C. Perrin and wounding Detective Al Hartman. All the Nelson gang, except Nelson, fled San Antonio. Nelson and his wife traveled west to the San Francisco Bay Area, where he recruited John Paul Chase and Fatso Negri for a new wave of bank robberies the following spring.

===Partnership with John Dillinger===
On March 3, 1934, John Dillinger made his famous &quot;wooden pistol&quot; escape from the jail in Crown Point, Indiana. Although the details remain in some dispute, the escape is suspected to have been arranged and financed by members of Nelson&#x27;s newly formed gang, including Homer Van Meter, Tommy Carroll, Eddie Green, and John &quot;Red&quot; Hamilton, with the understanding that Dillinger would repay some part of the bribe money out of his share of the first robbery. The night Dillinger arrived in the Twin Cities, Nelson and his friend John Paul Chase were cut off by another car driven by local paint salesman Theodore Kidder. Nelson lost his temper and gave chase, crowding Kidder to the curb. The salesman exited his vehicle to protest, whereupon Nelson shot him dead.

Two days after this, the new gang (with Hamilton&#x27;s participation as the sixth man uncertain) struck the Security National Bank at Sioux Falls, South Dakota. In the robbery, which netted around $49,000 (figures differ slightly), Nelson severely wounded motorcycle policeman Hale Keith with a burst of sub-machine-gun fire as the officer was arriving at the scene. The six men were soon identified as &quot;the Second Dillinger gang&quot;, due to Dillinger&#x27;s extreme notoriety, but the gang had no official leader.

On March 13, a week after the robbery in Sioux Falls, the gang robbed the First National Bank in Mason City, Iowa. Dillinger and Hamilton were both shot and wounded in the robbery, where they made off with $52,000. On April 3, federal agents ambushed and killed Eddie Green, though he was unarmed and they were uncertain of his identity. In the aftermath of the Mason City robbery, Nelson and John Paul Chase fled west to Reno, where their old bosses Bill Graham and Jim McKay were fighting a federal mail fraud case. Years later, the FBI determined that on March 22, 1934, Nelson and Chase abducted and killed the chief witness against the pair, Roy Fritsch. Fritsch&#x27;s quartered body was said to have been thrown down an abandoned mine shaft and was never found.

===Little Bohemia===

On the afternoon of April 20, Nelson, Dillinger, Van Meter, Carroll, Hamilton, and gang associate and errand-runner Pat Reilly, accompanied by Nelson&#x27;s wife Helen and three girlfriends of the other men, arrived at the secluded Little Bohemia Lodge in Manitowish Waters, Wisconsin, for a weekend of rest. The gang&#x27;s connection to the resort apparently came from previous dealings between Dillinger&#x27;s attorney, Louis Piquett, and lodge owner Emil Wanatka. Though gang members greeted him by name, Wanatka maintained that he was unaware of their identities until some time later that night. According to Bryan Burrough&#x27;s book &quot;Public Enemies: America&#x27;s Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the FBI, 1933–34&quot;, this most likely happened when Wanatka was playing cards with Dillinger, Nelson, and Hamilton. When Dillinger won a round and raked in the pot, Wanatka caught a glimpse of Dillinger&#x27;s pistol concealed in his coat, and noticed that Nelson and the others also had shoulder holsters.

The following day, while she was away from the lodge with her young son at a children&#x27;s birthday party, Wanatka&#x27;s wife informed a friend, Henry Voss, that the Dillinger gang was at the lodge, and the FBI was subsequently given the tip early on April 22. Melvin Purvis and a number of agents arrived by plane from Chicago, and with the gang&#x27;s departure imminent, attacked the lodge quickly and with little preparation, and without notifying or obtaining help from local authorities.

Wanatka offered a one-dollar dinner special on Sunday nights, and the last of a crowd estimated at 75 people were leaving as the agents arrived in the front driveway. A 1933 Chevrolet coupé was leaving at that moment with three departing lodge customers, John Hoffman, Eugene Boisneau and John Morris, who apparently did not hear an order to halt because the car radio drowned out the agents yelling at them to stop. The agents quickly opened fire on them, instantly killing Boisneau and wounding the others, and alerting the gang members inside.

Adding to the chaos, at this moment Pat Reilly returned to the lodge after an out-of-town errand for Van Meter, accompanied by John Hamilton&#x27;s girlfriend, Pat Cherrington. Accosted by the agents, Reilly and Cherrington backed out and escaped under fire.

Dillinger, Van Meter, Hamilton, and Carroll escaped through the back of the lodge, which was unguarded, and made their way north on foot through woods and past a lake to commandeer a car and a driver at a resort a mile away. Carroll was not far behind them. He made it to Manitowish and stole a car, making it uneventfully to St. Paul.

Nelson, who had been outside the lodge in the adjacent cabin, characteristically attacked the raiding party head on, exchanging fire with Purvis, before retreating into the lodge under a return volley from other agents. From there he slipped out the back and fled in the opposite direction from the others. Emerging from the woods ninety minutes later, a mile away from Little Bohemia, Nelson kidnapped the Lange couple from their home and ordered them to drive him away. Apparently dissatisfied with the car&#x27;s speed, he quickly ordered them to pull up at a brightly lit house where the switchboard operator, Alvin Koerner, aware of the ongoing events, quickly phoned authorities at one of the involved lodges to report a suspicious vehicle in front of his home. Shortly after Nelson had entered the home, taking the Koerners hostage, Emil Wanatka arrived with his brother-in-law George LaPorte and a lodge employee (while a fourth man remained in the car) and were also taken prisoner. Nelson ordered Koerner and Wanatka back into their vehicle, where the fourth man remained unnoticed in the back seat.

As they were preparing to leave, with Wanatka driving at gunpoint, another car arrived with two federal agents – W. Carter Baum and Jay Newman – as well as a local constable, Carl Christensen. Nelson asked the agents who they were and upon the agents identifying themselves, Nelson quickly opened fire with his fully automatic pistol, severely wounding Christensen and Newman and killing Baum, who was hit three times in the neck. Nelson was later quoted as having said that Baum had him &quot;cold&quot; and could not understand why he had not fired. It was found that the safety catch on Baum&#x27;s gun was on.

Nelson stole the FBI car. Less than 15 miles away, the car suffered a flat tire and finally became mired in mud as Nelson attempted unsuccessfully to change it. Back on foot, he wandered into the woods and took up residence with a Chippewa family in their secluded cabin for several days before making his final escape in another commandeered vehicle.

Three of the women who had accompanied the gang, including Nelson&#x27;s wife Helen, were captured inside the lodge. After grueling interrogations by the FBI, the three were ultimately convicted on harboring charges and released on parole.

With an agent and an innocent bystander dead and four more severely wounded, including two more innocent bystanders, as well as the complete escape of the Dillinger gang, the FBI came under severe criticism, with calls for director J. Edgar Hoover&#x27;s resignation and a widely circulated petition demanding Purvis&#x27; suspension.

===Nelson as public enemy #1===
At the time of the Little Bohemia shootout, Nelson&#x27;s identity as a member of the Dillinger gang had been known to the FBI for two weeks. Following the killing of Baum, Nelson became nationally notorious and was made a high-priority target of the Bureau. The focus on him and the murdered agent served to deflect some of the intense criticism directed at Hoover and Purvis following the Little Bohemia debacle.

A day after the Little Bohemia raid, Dillinger, Hamilton, and Van Meter ran through a police roadblock near Hastings, Minnesota, drawing fire from officers there. A ricocheting bullet struck Hamilton in the back, fatally wounding him. Hamilton reportedly died in hiding on April 30 or May 1, 1934, and was secretly buried by Dillinger and others, including Nelson, who had rejoined the gang in Aurora, Illinois.

On June 7, gang member Tommy Carroll was killed while trying to evade arrest in Waterloo, Iowa. Carroll and his girlfriend, Jean Crompton (who had been captured and tried with Helen Gillis after Little Bohemia), had grown close to the Nelsons, and his death was a personal blow to them. Nelson and his wife went into hiding during the ensuing weeks, and although they were in the Chicago area, their precise movements in this period remain obscure. The Nelsons reportedly lived in various tourist camps, while continuing to secretly meet with family members whenever possible.

On June 27, former gang errand-runner and Little Bohemia fugitive Pat Reilly was arrested in St. Paul, Minnesota.

On the morning of June 30, Nelson, Dillinger, Van Meter, and one or more additional accomplices robbed the Merchants National Bank in South Bend, Indiana. One man involved in the robbery is believed to have been Pretty Boy Floyd, based on several eyewitness identifications as well as the later account of Joseph &quot;Fatso&quot; Negri, an old Nelson associate from California who was serving as a gofer for the gang at this time. Another rumored participant was Nelson&#x27;s childhood friend, Jack Perkins, also an associate of the gang at that time. (Perkins was later tried for the robbery and acquitted).

When the robbery began, policeman Howard Wagner had been directing traffic outside. Responding quickly to the scene and attempting to draw his gun, he was shot dead by Van Meter, who was stationed outside the bank. During the shootout that followed, Nelson exchanged fire with a local jeweler, Harry Berg, who had shot him in the chest - ineffectively, because of Nelson&#x27;s bullet-proof vest. As Berg retreated into his store under a return volley from Nelson, a man in a parked car was wounded. Nelson also grappled briefly with a teenage boy, Joseph Pawlowski, who tackled him until Nelson (or Van Meter) stunned Pawlowski with a blow from his gun. When Dillinger and the man identified as Floyd (unconfirmed) emerged from the bank with sacks containing $28,000, they brought three hostages with them (including the bank president) to deter gunfire from three patrolmen on the scene. The policemen fired nonetheless, wounding two of the hostages before grazing Van Meter in the head. The gang escaped, and Van Meter recovered. In the constant and chaotic exchange of gunfire, several other bystanders were wounded by shots, ricochets, or flying broken glass. It was the last confirmed robbery for all of the known and suspected participants, including Floyd (unconfirmed).

During the month of July, as the FBI manhunt for him continued, Nelson and his wife fled to California with associate John Paul Chase, who remained with Nelson for the rest of his life. Upon their return to Chicago on July 15, the gang held a reunion meeting at a favorite rendezvous site. When the meeting was interrupted by two Illinois state troopers, Fred McAllister and Gilbert Cross, Nelson fired on their vehicle with his converted &quot;machine gun pistol&quot;, wounding both men as the gangsters retreated. Cross was badly wounded, but both he and McAllister survived. Nelson&#x27;s responsibility was uncertain until verification came later in the form of a confession from Chase.

On July 22, 1934, Dillinger was ambushed and killed by FBI agents outside the Biograph Theater in Lincoln Park, Chicago. The next day the FBI announced that &quot;Pretty Boy&quot; Floyd was now Public Enemy No. 1. On October 22, 1934, Floyd was killed in a shootout with agents including Melvin Purvis. Subsequently, J. Edgar Hoover announced that Nelson was now Public Enemy No. 1.

On August 23, Van Meter was ambushed and killed by police in St. Paul, Minnesota, leaving Nelson as the sole survivor of the so-called &quot;Second Dillinger Gang&quot;.

In the ensuing months, Nelson and his wife, usually accompanied by Chase, drifted west to cities including Sacramento and San Francisco, California and Reno and Las Vegas, Nevada. They often stayed in auto camps, including Walley&#x27;s Hot Springs, outside Genoa, Nevada, where they hid out from October 1 before returning to Chicago around November 1. Nelson&#x27;s movements during the final month of his life are largely unknown.

By the end of the month, FBI interest had settled on a former hideout of Nelson&#x27;s, the Lake Como Inn in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, where it was believed that Nelson might return for the winter. When the Nelsons and Chase did return to the inn on November 27, they briefly came face to face with surprised and unprepared FBI agents who had staked it out. The fugitives sped away before any shots were fired. Armed with a description of the car (a black Ford V8) and its license plate number (639–578), agents swarmed into the area.

==Death==

A short but furious gun battle between FBI agents and Nelson took place on November 27, 1934, outside Chicago in the town of Barrington, culminating in the deaths of Nelson, and FBI agents Herman &quot;Ed&quot; Hollis and Samuel P. Cowley.

On the morning of November 27, Nelson, along with his wife Helen Gillis and associate John Paul Chase, headed south in a stolen V8 Ford towards Chicago on U.S. Highway 12 (now US-14). Nelson, always keen to spot federal agents, caught sight of a sedan driven in the opposite direction by agents Thomas McDade and William Ryan. Both parties simultaneously recognized each other and after several U-turns by both vehicles, Nelson wound up in pursuit of the agents&#x27; car. When Nelson&#x27;s powerful Ford caught up to the agents&#x27; slower sedan, Chase opened fire on the agents. Ryan and McDade returned fire, sped up, then pulled into a field and awaited Nelson and Chase, who had stopped pursuing. McDade and Ryan were unaware that one of their bullets had punctured one of the water pumps on Nelson&#x27;s Ford. With Nelson&#x27;s Ford rapidly losing power, a Hudson automobile driven by Hollis (who had been given credit as one of the agents who fired the fatal shots that killed Dillinger the previous July) and Cowley, began pursuing the Ford.

With his pursuers attempting to pull alongside, Nelson skidded into the entrance to Barrington&#x27;s North Side Park. Hollis and Cowley overshot Nelson&#x27;s car by over , and stopped at an angle. Upon exiting the vehicle&#x27;s passenger door, the agents took cover behind their car. The ensuing shootout was witnessed by more than a dozen people.

Nelson yelled to Helen to take cover in a nearby ditch, then he and Chase opened fire on the agents. Both Cowley and Hollis returned fire from behind their vehicle. A single .45 slug from Cowley&#x27;s machine gun struck Nelson in the lower abdomen. Nelson leaned on the Ford&#x27;s running board, then wordlessly exchanged weapons with Chase. In the din of the gun battle, Chase heard Nelson complain that his weapon was jamming, and the wounded Nelson swapped it out for either a .351 Winchester or a Colt Monitor automatic rifle. Despite his grievous wound, Nelson moved from behind the car and advanced toward the agents while firing his weapon. Two of his bullets struck Cowley. Several buckshot pellets from Hollis&#x27;s shotgun then struck Nelson in the legs and knocked him down.

As Nelson regained his feet, Hollis, possibly already wounded, moved to better cover behind a utility pole. As he drew his service pistol, Nelson fatally shot Hollis in the head. Nelson staggered over Hollis&#x27;s body, aimed his weapon at the agent&#x27;s fallen form for a moment then limped toward the agents&#x27; Hudson. Nelson drove the car over to the disabled Ford. After loading the agents&#x27; car with the Ford&#x27;s guns and supplies, Nelson let Chase get behind the wheel of the agents&#x27; car and the two men and Helen Gillis fled the scene. Nelson was shot a total of nine times; a single (and ultimately fatal) machine gun slug had struck his abdomen and eight of Hollis&#x27;s shotgun pellets had hit his legs. Later news reports inaccurately gave his number of wounds as 17, possibly due to a memorandum release by J. Edgar Hoover stating &quot;seven to ten wounds&quot; to Nelson&#x27;s body. After telling his wife &quot;I&#x27;m done for&quot;, Nelson gave directions as Chase drove them to a safe house on Walnut Street in Wilmette. Nelson died in bed with his wife at his side, at 7:35 p.m.

Hollis was pronounced dead soon after arriving at the hospital. At a different hospital, Cowley lived for long enough to confer briefly with Melvin Purvis and have surgery, before succumbing to a stomach wound similar to Nelson&#x27;s. Following a telephone tip from a Chicago Telephone Company employee, Carl Fyhrie, who was working on the telephone lines and saw a body on the ground, Nelson&#x27;s body was discovered wrapped in an Indian patterned blanket by FBI agent Walter Walsh, in a ditch on the northeast corner of the St. Paul&#x27;s Lutheran Cemetery in Skokie, and taken to Haben&#x27;s Funeral Home, both of which still exist. Helen later stated that she had placed the blanket around Nelson&#x27;s body because, &quot;He always hated being cold&quot;.

Newspapers reported, based on the aggressive wording of an order from J. Edgar Hoover (&quot;find the woman and give her no quarter&quot;), that the FBI had issued a &quot;death order&quot; for Nelson&#x27;s widow, who wandered the streets of Chicago as a fugitive for several days, described in print as the U.S. first female &quot;public enemy&quot;. After surrendering on Thanksgiving Day, Helen, who had been paroled after capture at Little Bohemia, served a year in prison for harboring her husband. Chase was apprehended later and served a term at Alcatraz.

==Burial==

Baby Face Nelson and his wife Helen are buried at Saint Joseph&#x27;s Cemetery in River Grove, Illinois.

==Fictional portrayals==
Nelson has been portrayed multiple times onscreen. These include:

* &quot;Baby Face Nelson&quot;, a 1957 film starring Mickey Rooney
* &quot;The FBI Story&quot;, a 1959 film starring James Stewart, with William Phipps as Nelson
* &quot;Dillinger&quot;, a 1973 film featuring Richard Dreyfuss as Nelson. In this film the shootout between Nelson and FBI Agents Cowley and Hollis is depicted as taking place during the Little Bohemia raid.
* &quot;The Kansas City Massacre&quot;, a 1975 TV movie featuring Elliott Street as Nelson
* &quot;Baby Face Nelson (1995)&quot;, a 1995 film starring C. Thomas Howell
* &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot;, a 2000 film featuring Michael Badalucco as Nelson. He is portrayed as working mostly alone, until meeting up with the main characters and having them along as he robs the next bank in quick succession to break a record. The characters suggest he suffers from Bipolar Disorder, rapidly shifting between energetic highs and depressive lows. When he last appears he is being taken by an angry mob to meet his death in the electric chair. The film is set in Mississippi in 1937, three years after the real Nelson&#x27;s death.
* &quot;Public Enemies&quot;, a 2009 film starring American actor Johnny Depp, with Stephen Graham as Nelson. In this film, Nelson is portrayed as being killed by Melvin Purvis alongside Van Meter and Ed Shouse at the Little Bohemia shootout, and thus does not become Public Enemy Number One after Dillinger&#x27;s death. However, the film still portrays Nelson as getting up and continuing to fire immediately after being shot several times.
* In the A&amp;E drama series &quot;Baby Face&quot;, produced by Kerry Ehrin and Freddie Highmore with the latter taking on the role of Nelson.
* In &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot;, there is a primary weapon for Scout called the &quot;Baby Face&#x27;s Blaster&quot;, it is a lever action shotgun similar to the .351 Winchester that Nelson used during the shootout that ended his life.

<text>A checkerboard (North American English) or chequerboard (Commonwealth English except Canada; see spelling differences) is a game board of checkered pattern on which checkers (also known as English draughts) is played. Most commonly, it consists of 64 squares (8×8) of alternating dark and light color, typically green and buff (official tournaments), black and red (consumer commercial), or black and white (printed diagrams). An 8×8 checkerboard is used to play many other games, including chess, whereby it is known as a chessboard. Other rectangular square-tiled boards are also often called checkerboards. In The Netherlands, however, a &quot;dambord&quot; (checker board) has 10 rows and 10 columns for 100 squares in total (see article International draughts).

==Games and puzzles using checkerboards==

Martin Gardner featured puzzles based on checkerboards in his November 1962 Mathematical Games column in Scientific American. A square checkerboard with an alternating pattern is used for games including:
* Amazons
* Chapayev
* Chess and some of its variants (see chessboard)
* Czech draughts
* Draughts, also known as checkers
* Fox games
* Frisian draughts
* Gounki
* International draughts
* Italian draughts
* Lines of Action
* Pool checkers
* Russian checkers

The following games require an 8×8 board and are sometimes played on a chessboard.
* Arimaa
* Breakthrough
* Crossings
* Mak-yek
* Makruk
* Martian Chess

==Mathematical description==
Given a grid with formula_1 rows and formula_2 columns, a function formula_3,

formula_4

or, alternatively,

formula_5

The element formula_6 is black and represents the lower left corner of the board.

<text>is a commercial and entertainment district in Toshima, Tokyo, Japan. Toshima ward offices, Ikebukuro Station, and several shops, restaurants, and department stores are located within city limits.

==Transportation==
At the center of Ikebukuro is the train and subway station, a huge urban gathering shared by the JR East lines, the Seibu Ikebukuro Line and the Tōbu Tōjō Line. It is one of the main commuter hubs in the western Yamanote area of Tokyo. Ikebukuro Station is the third-busiest station in Japan, and the world.

==Cultural attractions==
Around the station are the Seibu and Tōbu department stores. Seibu, written with the characters for , is on the east end of the station and Tōbu, written with the characters for , is on the west end. East of the station, on the site of Sugamo Prison, stands Sunshine 60, which was the tallest building in Asia at the time of its construction.

Opened in 1978, Sunshine 60 contains Sunshine City, a large and popular shopping mall with various attractions including an aquarium, a Pokémon Center and cat cafés. Adjacent to Sunshine City, on Meiji Dori, is what was previously called the Toyota Ikebukuro Building which housed a multi-floor Toyota Autosalon Amlux showroom from 2000 to 2013. The building is now called Sunshine City Annex since 2019. Otome Road, a center for otaku culture and shopping district for anime and manga aimed at women, is located nearby. Marui and Don Quijote also have department stores in the area. The principal electronics retailer in Ikebukuro is Bic Camera. There is a small pleasure district located in Nishi-Ikebukuro, similar to Shinjuku&#x27;s Kabukichō.

The Tokyo Metropolitan Theater is also located near Ikebukuro Station. Opened in 1990, the theater hosts concert, dance, and theater performances. 

In July 2020, Hareza Ikebukuro, a cultural hub that includes the Hareza Tower and eight theaters, including the Tokyo Tatemono Brillia Hall opened around the site of the former Toshima Ward Office.
The old village of Ikebukuro stood to the northwest of the station. Most of the area on which modern Ikebukuro is built was historically known as Sugamo. In the Taishō and Shōwa periods, the relatively low land prices attracted artists and foreign workers, who lent a somewhat cosmopolitan atmosphere to Ikebukuro. Until October 1, 1932 when Toshima ward was established, the area was an independent municipality of .

==Etymology==
The kanji for Ikebukuro literally means &quot;pond bag&quot; (池袋). Outside the west exit of Ikebukuro Station near an entrance to the Fukutoshin Line is a small plaque explaining how the area used to have multiple lakes, hence the name. There is a small statue of an owl located near the center of the city called , meaning &quot;pond owl statue&quot;. It is a play on words, as &quot;owl&quot; (梟 &quot;fukurō&quot;) is pronounced similarly to &quot;bag&quot; (袋 &quot;fukuro&quot;). The owl statue has become a famous meeting place along the lines of the statue of Hachikō located outside Shibuya Station.

==Tokyo Chinatown==
Ikebukuro is home to many ethnic Chinese who arrived in the 1980s, leading to a variety of Chinese goods and services being provided in the district, which are popular among tourists interested in Chinese culture. However, the Ikebukuro Chinatown is smaller and less populous than Yokohama&#x27;s Chinatown just to the south of Tokyo.

<text>Rachel Claire Ward (born 12 September 1957) is an English-Australian actress, film director, screenwriter and television director.

==Early life==
Ward was born in Oxfordshire near Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, England, the daughter of Claire Leonora (née Baring) and the Hon. Peter Alistair Ward. Her grandfathers were William Ward, 3rd Earl of Dudley and the cricketer Giles Baring. Ward is also the great-granddaughter of William Ward, 2nd Earl of Dudley, Governor-General of Australia 1908–11, and sister of environmental campaigner and former actress Tracy Louise Ward, Duchess of Beaufort. She attended Hatherop Castle School, Hatherop, Gloucestershire, then the Byam Shaw School of Art in Kensington, West London. She left school at age 16 to become a fashion and photography model. She briefly dated David Kennedy, son of Robert F. Kennedy.

==Career==
During her modelling career, she was featured on the covers of &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s &amp; Queen&quot;, and &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; magazines. After moving to the United States in 1977, she appeared in television advertisements such as the Lincoln Mercury &quot;Cougar Girl&quot; and Revlon&#x27;s &quot;Scoundrel Girl&quot;. In 1981, she received a Golden Globe Award nomination for &quot;New Star of the Year&quot; for her role in the film &quot;Sharky&#x27;s Machine&quot; starring with Burt Reynolds. The following year, she starred in &quot;Dead Men Don&#x27;t Wear Plaid&quot; with Steve Martin. Her big break came in 1983, when she starred opposite Richard Chamberlain as the lead role portraying Meggie Cleary in the television miniseries &quot;The Thorn Birds&quot;, for which she was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Miniseries or Television Film. Ward assigns much of the credit for this breakthrough performance to acting coach Sandra Seacat, first for simply helping her get the job (after her disastrous first reading) and then for the quality of the finished performance, assembled over the course of a gruelling five-month shooting schedule, while undergoing a simultaneous and no less gruelling makeover programme at the hands of Seacat. Also in 1983, U.S. audiences voted Ward one of the world&#x27;s 10 most beautiful women. In 1984, she played Jess in the film noir remake &quot;Against All Odds&quot;, with Jeff Bridges. After filming &quot;Fortress&quot; in 1985, Ward then disappeared from film for a few years to study acting.

She reappeared in 1987 playing opposite her husband, Bryan Brown (whom she met on the set of &quot;The Thorn Birds&quot;), in &quot;The Umbrella Woman&quot;. In 2001, she was again nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Miniseries or Television Film for her role in &quot;On the Beach&quot; (2000). Also in 2001, Ward won the Australian Film Institute Award for Best Short Fiction Film for &quot;The Big House&quot;, and Best Australian Film at Flickerfest. The film also won the Film Critics Circle of Australia award, as did her 2003 film &quot;Martha&#x27;s New Coat&quot;. That film also won the 2003 ATOM Award.
In 2003, a portrait of Ward by artist Jan Williamson won the Packing Room Prize at the Archibald Prize competition. In 2005, Ward was made a Member of the Order of Australia &quot;for service to raising awareness of social justice through lobbying, mentoring and advocacy for the rights of disadvantaged and at-risk young people, and support for the Australian film and television industry&quot;.

In 2006, Ward acted in Kevin Connor&#x27;s mini-series &quot;Blackbeard&quot;, made for the Hallmark Channel.

In 2007, Ward returned to television, headlining the new ABC drama &quot;Rain Shadow&quot;. She played a country veterinarian named Kate McDonald, a free spirit who confronts personal and professional obstacles in a rural, drought-affected town.

In 2009, she directed her first feature-length film titled &quot;Beautiful Kate&quot;, which she adapted from a 1982 Newton Thornburg novel. It premiered at the Sydney Film Festival.

==Personal life==
Ward has been married to the Australian actor Bryan Brown since 1983. They have three children: Rosie, Matilda and Joe.

<doc id="381624" wikidata="Q527125" url="?curid=381624" title="Quarto (board game)">
<text>Quarto is a board game for two players invented by Swiss mathematician Blaise Müller. It is published and copyrighted by Gigamic.

The game is played on a 4×4 board. There are 16 unique pieces to play with, each of which is either:
* tall or short;
* red or blue (or a different pair of colors, e.g. light- or dark-stained wood);
* square or circular; and
* hollow-top or solid-top.

Players take turns choosing a piece which the other player must then place on the board. A player wins by placing a piece on the board which forms a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row of four pieces, all of which have a common attribute (all short, all circular, etc.). A variant rule included in many editions gives a second way to win by placing four matching pieces in a 2×2 square.

&quot;Quarto&quot; is distinctive in that there is only one set of common pieces, rather than a set for one player and a different set for the other. It is therefore an impartial game.

<doc id="381625" wikidata="Q1253957" url="?curid=381625" title="Dr. Kildare">
<text>Dr. James Kildare is a fictional American medical doctor, originally created in the 1930s by the author Frederick Schiller Faust under the pen name Max Brand. Shortly after the character&#x27;s first appearance in a magazine story, Paramount Pictures used the story and character as the basis for the 1937 film &quot;Internes Can&#x27;t Take Money,&quot; starring Joel McCrea as Jimmie Kildare. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) subsequently acquired the rights and featured Kildare as the primary character in a series of American theatrical films in the late 1930s and early 1940s. Several of these films were co-written by Faust (as Max Brand), who also continued to write magazine stories and novels about the character until the early 1940s. Kildare was portrayed by Lew Ayres in nine MGM films. (Ayres was drafted in 1942 and served as a non-combatant medic until 1946.) Later films set in the same hospital featured Dr. Gillespie (Lionel Barrymore). Ayres returned to voice the Kildare character in an early 1950s radio series. The 1961–1966 &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot; television series made a star of Richard Chamberlain and gave birth to a comic book and comic strip based on the show. A short-lived reboot of the TV series, &quot;Young Doctor Kildare,&quot; debuted in 1972 and ran for 24 episodes.

==Magazine stories and novels==
===Original series===
The author Frederick Schiller Faust, writing as Max Brand, created the character of Dr. James Kildare as a fictionalized version of his college friend, Dr. George Winthrop &quot;Dixie&quot; Fish, a New York surgeon. He first introduced the character in a short story, &quot;Internes Can&#x27;t Take Money&quot;, that appeared in the March 1936 issue of &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; magazine. A second Kildare story, &quot;Whiskey Sour&quot;, was published in &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; in April 1938. In these early stories, Dr. James &quot;Jimmy&quot; Kildare is an aspiring surgeon who leaves his parents&#x27; farm to practice at a fictional big-city hospital, and through his work, comes into contact with underworld criminals. The first Kildare film, &quot;Internes Can&#x27;t Take Money&quot; (1937), based on the short story of the same title and made by Paramount, followed this version of the character.

In 1938, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) contracted with Faust to acquire the rights to the Kildare character along with Faust&#x27;s services as a film story writer. Faust then made major changes to the character to fit MGM&#x27;s idea for a new movie series, including changing Kildare&#x27;s specialty to diagnostics rather than surgery, introducing the character of Kildare&#x27;s superior Dr. Leonard Gillespie, de-emphasizing the criminal elements, and restarting the story from Kildare&#x27;s first arrival at the city hospital. Faust (as Brand) collaborated with MGM on its Kildare film series starting with the first MGM series release, &quot;Young Dr. Kildare&quot; (1938) and continuing through &quot;The People vs. Dr. Kildare&quot; (1941). During this time, Faust wrote several original Kildare stories which were first published in magazines, later republished in novel form, and made into films by MGM. The stories were written prior to the films being made, and were not published as movie tie-ins.

After &quot;The People vs. Dr. Kildare&quot;, Faust and MGM parted ways. Faust was not involved in &quot;Dr. Kildare&#x27;s Wedding Day&quot;, &quot;Dr. Kildare&#x27;s Victory&quot;, or any of the subsequent films featuring Dr. Gillespie, although Faust (as Brand) continued to receive a credit for creating the characters. Faust&#x27;s last two Kildare stories, &quot;Dr. Kildare&#x27;s Hardest Case&quot; (published in 1942) and the unfinished story &quot;Dr. Kildare&#x27;s Dilemma&quot; (posthumously published in the early 1970s), were not made into films. In 1944, Faust was killed in Italy while working as a war correspondent.

====Dr. Kildare story list====
This table lists the Max Brand-authored Kildare stories in chronological order of first publication. Due to the continuing popularity of the characters in film, radio and television series, many reprints, different formats, and different versions of the original Kildare books have since been released.

Aside from the Kildare stories, Faust (as Brand) wrote only one other medical story, &quot;My People&quot;, which appeared in the August 1940 issue of &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;. &quot;My People&quot; featured a character, &quot;Dr. Maynard&quot;, who was similar to Dr. Kildare. MGM acquired the rights to &quot;My People&quot; as a possible concept for a Kildare film, but it was never developed.

===Television tie-ins===
The popularity of the 1960s &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot; TV series and its star, Richard Chamberlain, resulted in a number of contemporary tie-in novels by several different authors. Several were released in mass-market paperback form by Lancer Books, while titles aimed at preteen and young teen readers were published by Whitman Publishing. The covers featured photographs of Chamberlain as Kildare, or artwork using his likeness. Known titles are listed below.

By Robert C. Ackworth:
* &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot; (Lancer, 1962)
* &quot;Dr. Kildare: Assigned to Trouble&quot; (Whitman, 1963) (with Robert L. Jenney, illustrator)

By Norman A. Daniels:
* &quot;Dr. Kildare&#x27;s Secret Romance&quot; (Lancer, 1962)
* &quot;Dr. Kildare&#x27;s Finest Hour&quot; (Lancer, 1963)

By William Johnston:
* &quot;Dr. Kildare: The Faces of Love&quot; (Lancer, 1963)
* &quot;Dr. Kildare: The Heart Has an Answer&quot; (Lancer, 1963)
* &quot;Dr. Kildare: The Magic Key&quot; (Whitman, 1964) (with Al Andersen, illustrator)

==Films==
===&quot;Internes Can&#x27;t Take Money&quot;===
The character of Dr. Kildare first appeared on film in the 1937 Paramount film, &quot;Internes Can&#x27;t Take Money&quot;, based on Max Brand&#x27;s previously published short story of the same name and starring Joel McCrea as Dr. Kildare. The plot focuses on Dr. Kildare&#x27;s attempt to help a young female ex-convict (played by Barbara Stanwyck) locate her child. Paramount did not plan any further Kildare films, probably because box-office returns did not meet expectations.

===MGM film series (1930s–1940s)===

MGM had noted the popularity of the Kildare character in pulp magazines and, following the release of &quot;Internes Can&#x27;t Take Money,&quot; saw an opportunity to obtain an undervalued property and develop a successful film series. In 1938, MGM entered into a deal with author Faust (Brand) to acquire the rights to Dr. Kildare and have Faust work with MGM on developing stories for a film series. Seven Dr. Kildare films were subsequently made by MGM based on stories originally written by Faust. After &quot;The People vs. Dr. Kildare&quot; (1941), Faust and MGM ended their collaboration and MGM continued the series using stories by other writers, though Faust still received a credit for creating the characters.

In the MGM series, the Dr. Kildare character (played by Lew Ayres) first appears as a medical intern newly arrived at a New York City hospital, where he attracts the attention of a respected older physician and skilled diagnostician, Dr. Leonard Gillespie (played by Lionel Barrymore). After becoming a physician, Kildare faces a number of professional and personal challenges in the course of his work, while being mentored by Gillespie.

In 1942, during the making of the tenth film in the MGM series, originally titled &quot;Born to Be Bad&quot;, Ayres was drafted to serve in WWII and declared himself a conscientious objector. The resulting negative publicity caused MGM to cut Ayres from the film, eliminate the character of Kildare, and change the film&#x27;s focus to Barrymore&#x27;s character Gillespie, eventually releasing the revamped film as &quot;Calling Dr. Gillespie&quot; (1942). Dr. Kildare simply vanished from the series, without explanation, and for &quot;Calling Dr. Gillespie&quot; the character of a young doctor mentored by the experienced Dr. Gillespie was played by Philip Dorn (as Dr. John Hunter Gerniede). MGM made several more films featuring the Dr. Gillespie character mentoring various young doctors played by Van Johnson (as Dr. Randall &quot;Red&quot; Adams), Keye Luke (as Dr. Lee Wong How), and James Craig (as Dr. Tommy Coalt). After leaving the series, the character of Kildare was never seen, heard or so much as mentioned in any of the subsequent films.

===Home media===
Warner Bros. released the complete set of MGM Kildare films on DVD as the &quot;Dr. Kildare Movie Collection&quot; via their Warner Archive Collection in January 2014. The set also included, as an extra, the 1960 unaired pilot for the &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot; TV series starring Lew Ayres. Previously, some of the individual Kildare films had been released individually on DVD through distributors such as Alpha Video, Roan Archival Group, FilmRise and Genius Entertainment.

Warner Bros. also released the complete set of Dr. Gillespie films on DVD as the &quot;Dr. Gillespie Movie Collection&quot; via Warner Archive Collection in November 2014.

The single Paramount Kildare film, &quot;Internes Can&#x27;t Take Money&quot;, was released on DVD by Universal as part of &quot;The Barbara Stanwyck Collection&quot; in April 2010.

==Radio==
The Kildare character first appeared on radio on October 13, 1938, when Lionel Barrymore and Lew Ayres performed a scene from their soon-to-be-released film, &quot;Young Dr. Kildare&quot;, on MGM&#x27;s &quot;Good News of 1939&quot; radio program.

In the summer of 1949, MGM reunited Lew Ayres and Lionel Barrymore to record the radio series, &quot;The Story of Dr. Kildare,&quot; which used the concept and characters of the earlier &quot;Young Dr. Kildare&quot; story and did not include any of the young doctors who had replaced Kildare in the later films featuring Dr. Gillespie. By this time, Ayres had returned to public favor after serving in WWII as a medical corpsman. Episodes were scripted by James Moser, Jean Holloway, Les Crutchfield, E. Jack Neuman, John Michael Hayes, Joel Murcott, and others. The supporting cast included Ted Osborne as hospital administrator Dr. Carew, Eleanor Audley as receptionist Molly Byrd, Jane Webb as nurse Mary Lamont, and Virginia Gregg as nurse Evangeline Parker, labeled &quot;Nosy Parker&quot; by Gillespie. In addition, many prominent West Coast radio actors made recurring appearances, including Raymond Burr, William Conrad, Stacy Harris, Lurene Tuttle, Barton Yarborough, and Jack Webb.

Each radio episode was developed as a stand-alone program rather than a serial. Episodes typically focused on Dr. Kildare dealing with a particular medical issue while jousting with eccentric patients and/or hospital administrators. The medical information presented was up to date for its time, and sometimes taken from real life; for example, an episode in which Dr. Kildare is forced to perform an emergency appendectomy on himself was based on a news story. At least 60 half-hour episodes were produced.

In addition to airing on the MGM-affiliated New York station WMGM, &quot;The Story of Dr. Kildare&quot; was originally syndicated to over 200 outlets in the U.S. and Canada, mostly Mutual Broadcasting System stations. The earliest known broadcast of the program took place on September 27, 1949, on Mutual station WGN in Chicago, prior to the WMGM premiere episode on October 12, 1949. In the early 1950s, MGM offered the show to stations as part of a multiple-program package for a price lower than purchasing each program individually. However, starting in 1952, stations began to lose interest in such packages, preferring to develop their own local programming to better compete with television. Consequently, despite the show&#x27;s popularity with audiences, no new episodes of &quot;The Story of Dr. Kildare&quot; were produced after 1951, although rebroadcasts of old episodes continued to air in syndication for several more years.

==Television==
===&quot;Dr. Kildare&quot; (1950s)===
In 1953, Lew Ayres was approached to star in a Dr. Kildare television series, which would feature an older Kildare having finally taken over the practice of a retired Dr. Gillespie. After two pilots were filmed, Ayres refused to work further on the project unless the television studio refused to allow cigarette companies to sponsor the program. Ayres later explained, &quot;My feeling was that a medical show, particularly one that might appeal to children, should not be used to sell cigarettes.&quot; The studio would not agree to reject lucrative advertising, so the project was abandoned.

===&quot;Dr. Kildare&quot; (1960s)===

Lew Ayres reprised his role as Dr. Kildare in an unsold and unaired 1960 TV pilot directed by John Newland (with Joe Cronin as Dr. Grayson)

The second attempt at a Kildare TV show premiered on September 28, 1961. The series was a top-10 hit with audiences and ran until April 5, 1966, for a total of 191 episodes in five seasons. The first two seasons told the story of Dr. James Kildare (Richard Chamberlain), working in a fictional large metropolitan hospital while trying to learn his profession, deal with his patients&#x27; problems, and earn the respect of the senior Dr. Leonard Gillespie (Raymond Massey). In the third season, Dr. Kildare was promoted to resident and the series began to focus more on the stories of the patients and their families. The success of the show (along with ABC&#x27;s contemporaneous medical drama &quot;Ben Casey&quot;) inspired the launch of numerous other television medical dramas in the ensuing years.

===&quot;Young Dr. Kildare&quot; (1970s)===
In 1972, MGM Television created a short-lived syndicated drama series called &quot;Young Dr. Kildare&quot;, starring Mark Jenkins as Dr. James Kildare and Gary Merrill as Dr. Leonard Gillespie. The series was not a success, and only 24 episodes were produced.

==Comics==
From 1962 to 1965, Dell Comics published a &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot; comic book based on the 1960s &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot; television series. The first issue was released April 2, 1962, as No. 1337 in Dell&#x27;s &quot;Four Color Comics&quot; line, and featured a story involving a gambler checking into Dr. Kildare&#x27;s hospital to hide from a hit man. Dell subsequently continued the comic book for a total of nine issues, with the final issue appearing in April 1965. All issues had photo covers featuring Chamberlain, the star of the TV series.

A &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot; daily comic strip based on the 1960s television series, distributed by King Features Syndicate, and drawn by Ken Bald also premiered on October 15, 1962. Bald was required to base his drawing of Dr. Kildare on photos of Richard Chamberlain, but made up his own drawings of other characters, including Dr. Gillespie. The daily strip, drawn by Bald, ran for over two decades until April 21, 1984, outlasting the television series (which was cancelled in 1966) by nearly 18 years. A Sunday strip also ran from April 19, 1964, to April 3, 1983. Bald retired after the cancellation of the daily strip.

==Franchise rights==
The underlying rights to the Kildare film and television franchise are owned by Warner Bros. (via Turner Entertainment Co.), with the exception of the 1937 film &quot;Internes Can&#x27;t Take Money&quot;, currently owned by EMKA, Ltd./Universal Television, keeper of Paramount Pictures&#x27; pre-1950 sound library.

<doc id="381629" wikidata="Q26470" url="?curid=381629" title="Little auk">
<text>The little auk (Europe) or dovekie (North America) Alle alle is a small auk, the only member of the genus &quot;Alle&quot;. &quot;Alle&quot; is the Sami name of the long-tailed duck; it is onomatopoeic and imitates the call of the drake duck. Linnaeus was not particularly familiar with the winter plumages of either the auk or the duck, and appears to have confused the two species. Other old names include rotch, rotche, bullbird, and sea dove, although the latter sometimes refers to a relative, the black guillemot.

They breed on islands in the high Arctic. There are two subspecies; &quot;A. a. alle&quot; breeds in Greenland, Novaya Zemlya and Svalbard; and &quot;A. a. polaris&quot; on Franz Josef Land. A small number of individuals Little Diomede Island in the Bering Strait with additional breeding individuals thought to occur on King Island, St. Lawrence Island, St. Matthew Island and the Pribilof Islands in the Bering Sea. They also formerly bred on Grímsey just north of Iceland, but are extinct there now. In winter, they disperse widely across the Arctic and North Atlantic Oceans, with the largest numbers in the Arctic close to the pack ice edge, and smaller numbers south to northern Great Britain in the eastern Atlantic, and Nova Scotia in the western Atlantic.

==Taxonomy==
The little auk was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the other auks in the genus &quot;Alca&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Alca alle&quot;. Linnaeus specified the type locality as Ocean of Arctic, Europe and America but this is now restricted to Scotland. The specific epithet is from &quot;allē&quot;, the Lapp word for the long-tailed duck (&quot;Clangula hyemalis&quot;). The species was formerly placed in the genus &quot;Plautus&quot;, but in 1973 this name was suppressed by the commission of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature and now the little auk is the only species placed in the genus &quot;Alle&quot; that was introduced in 1806 by the German naturalist Heinrich Friedrich Link.

Two subspecies are accepted:
* &quot;A. a. alle&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – Baffin Island (Arctic northeast Canada), northwest, east Greenland, north Iceland, Jan Mayen (northeast of Iceland), Svalbard (north of Norway) and Novaya Zemlya (north of northwest Russia)
* &quot;A. a. polaris&quot; Stenhouse, 1930 – Franz Josef Land (northeast of Novaya Zemlya, in Arctic Russia); perhaps Severnaya Zemlya (north of central Russia) to St. Lawrence Island (Bering Sea, Alaska)

==Description==
This is the only Atlantic auk of its size, half the size of the Atlantic puffin, at in length, with a wingspan. The adult weight ranges from . &quot;A. a. polaris&quot; is marginally larger than the nominate subspecies. In breeding plumage, the head, neck, back, and wings are black, with a white trailing edge to the secondary feathers, and white fringes on the scapular feathers, and pure white underparts. The bill is short and stubby. They have a small rounded black tail. The lower face and fore neck become white in winter plumage.

Little auks produce a variety of twitters and cackling calls at the breeding colonies, but tend to be silent at sea.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Food and feeding===
The flight is fast and direct, with rapid whirring wing beats due to their short wings. These birds forage for food like other auks by swimming underwater. They mainly eat crustaceans, especially copepods, of which a bird requires ~60,000 individuals per day (equivalent to of dry food weight), but they also eat small invertebrates such as mollusks, as well as small fish. Recent evidence suggests that the little auk forages not by filter-feeding on planktonic prey, but by visually-guided suction-feeding. They feed close to the shoreline during the breeding season, and feed near ice edges and coastlines during the winter.

===Breeding===
Little auks breed in large colonies on scree slopes on marine cliffsides. They nest in crevices or beneath large rocks, and may build rudimentary nests by bringing small pebbles and/or old grasses and lichen into the cavity, where they lay a single egg. Their single pale greenish blue egg is placed in a crevice of the rocks. Like other auks, they are monogamous and have high nest-site fidelity, meaning that the same cavity is often used as a nest site by the same pair, year to year. The eggs are generally incubated by both parents equally, for roughly a month (28–31 days), until chicks begin to hatch at about 25 days. Hatchlings generally weigh about 21 g and are unable to thermoregulate on their own; they are brooded for approximately 5 days until they are able to thermoregulate, after which they are only attended to for feeding by parents. The young fledge from their nests at an age of 26–29 days old, synchronously with others on the colony, usually at night. 

===Winter===
All little auks migrate south by winter into northern areas of the North Atlantic. The species is also commonly found in the Norwegian Sea. Late autumn storms may carry them south of their normal wintering areas, or into the North Sea, and can cause wrecks of these birds, along with other seabirds, at sea and occasionally on land. The British record count was made at the Farne Islands in Northumberland following strong northerly gales on 9–11 November 2007, with 18,381 flying north on 9th and 28,803 on 11th.

The glaucous gull and the Arctic fox are the main predators of little auks at colonies, with other gulls and raptors predating the species as well. In some cases, the polar bear has also been reported to feed on little auk eggs.

==Interaction with humans==
Due to their habit of feeding near shore during both summer and winter months, the species has been an important source of food for Inuit of Greenland, Baffin Island, and Labrador, as well as at parts of its southern range in eastern Canada.

Kiviaq is an Inuit food from Greenland. It is made by stuffing a seal skin with 300 to 500 little auks. Once full and airtight, the skin is sealed with seal fat and the little auks are left to ferment for 3 to 18 months under a pile of rocks. Caught in spring, little auks are a human food resource in winter. However, Knud Rasmussen&#x27;s death is attributed to food poisoning by kiviaq.

On the south coast of Newfoundland, Canada, the dovekie is known colloquially as the bull(y) bird or ice bird. The birds were once hunted, stuffed with savoury dressing and oven-baked. It was a food of last resort to prevent winter starvation amongst the fisher people of Newfoundland&#x27;s outport communities. Shot with BB pellets on ice pans off Newfoundland&#x27;s south coast, a feed would consist of 5–6 birds per person. Similarly, a hunt continues to occur for murres in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, and mainly acts as a subsistence hunt for traditional hunters, who shoot wintering murres near ice flows in coastal waters as a food source.

==Conservation==
Although populations appear to be decreasing, this is not currently thought to be rapid enough to be of concern for the species in the medium term, especially as global little auk numbers are generally rather fluid. Little auks have been shown to be able to buffer fluctuations in prey availability, caused by climate change, via plasticity in their foraging behaviour, which is likely to make accurate conservation assessments more difficult.

<text>Neeme Järvi (; born 7 June 1937) is an Estonian American conductor.

==Early life==
Järvi was born in Tallinn. He initially studied music there, and later in Leningrad at the Leningrad Conservatory under Yevgeny Mravinsky, and Nikolai Rabinovich, among others. Early in his career, he held posts with the Estonian Radio and Television Symphony Orchestra, the Estonian National Symphony Orchestra and the Estonian National Opera in Tallinn. In 1971 he won first prize in the International Conductors Competition at the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia in Rome. Järvi emigrated to the United States in 1980 with his family. He became an American citizen in 1985.

==Career==
In 1982, he became the principal conductor of the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra, and held the post for 22 years, the longest-serving principal conductor in the orchestra&#x27;s history. During his Gothenburg tenure, the recording profile and reputation of the orchestra greatly increased. He also helped to secure corporate sponsorship from Volvo that allowed the orchestra to increase in size from 80 to 110 players. He retained his post in Gothenburg until 2004, and now holds the title of Principal Conductor Emeritus (&quot;Chefdirigent Emeritus&quot;) with the orchestra.

Concurrently, Järvi was also Principal Conductor of the Royal Scottish National Orchestra (RSNO) between 1984 and 1988. At the time, he referred to his two orchestras as his &quot;Berlin Philharmonic&quot; (RSNO) and his &quot;Vienna Philharmonic&quot; (Gothenburg). With the RSNO, he made a number of landmark recordings for Chandos, notably Prokofiev and Dvořák cycles as well as Strauss&#x27;s tone poems, various Shostakovich pieces, including Symphonies Nos. 4, 7 and 10, and the two violin concertos featuring Lydia Mordkovitch. After a guest-conducting appearance in December 2006 after a nine-year absence from the RSNO, the orchestra named him their Conductor Laureate.

In the United States, Järvi became Music Director of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra in 1990. He served until 2005, and is now its Music Director Emeritus. In November 1996, Järvi conducted a joint concert by the Philadelphia Orchestra and the New York Philharmonic in Camden, New Jersey, to raise funds for the Philadelphia Orchestra, which was in the midst of a strike. He donated his services and received no fee for this concert. He received praise from US orchestra musicians for this gesture, and expressed a lack of concern about the possibility that orchestral managers would be angry at him for doing so.

Järvi became Music Director of the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra (NJSO) in 2005, with an initial three-year contract. With the 2007 decision by the NJSO to sell its &quot;Golden Age&quot; collection of string instruments, there was press speculation as to whether Järvi would renew his contract with the NJSO, as he stated that their acquisition of this collection was an important factor in his decision to accept the music directorship. When asked about the possibility of leaving after 2008, he stated: &quot;It&#x27;s very possible, but I haven&#x27;t thought about it yet.&quot; In October 2007, the NJSO announced that Järvi had extended his contract as music director through the 2008–2009 season. In February 2008, the orchestra announced the conclusion of Järvi&#x27;s tenure as the NJSO&#x27;s music director at the end of the 2008–2009 season. In March 2009, the NJSO announced that Järvi had agreed to serve as the orchestra&#x27;s artistic adviser, and named him their conductor laureate, after the scheduled conclusion of his contract as music director.

In September 2005, Järvi became Chief Conductor of the Residentie Orchestra of The Hague, with an initial contract of four years. In February 2008, the Residentie Orchestra announced the extension of Järvi&#x27;s contract as Chief Conductor through 2011. In November 2009, the Residentie Orchestra further extended his contract through the 2012–2013 season. In August 2009, the Estonian National Symphony Orchestra announced the appointment of Järvi as its next music director, for an initial contract of three years. In November 2010, Järvi resigned over the dismissal of the orchestra&#x27;s director. In September 2010, the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande named Järvi as its ninth artistic and musical director, as of 2012, with an initial contract of three years.

==Body of work==
Järvi&#x27;s discography includes over 400 recordings for labels such as BIS, Chandos and Deutsche Grammophon. He is best known for his interpretations of Romantic and 20th century classical music, and he has championed the work of his fellow Estonians Eduard Tubin and Arvo Pärt (whose &quot;Credo&quot; he premiered in 1968). His interpretations of Jean Sibelius with the Gothenburg Symphony are also well known. He has also recorded several works that have rarely been recorded in their complete form – among them all of Edvard Grieg&#x27;s orchestral music, including the complete incidental music for &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;, as well as Tchaikovsky&#x27;s complete incidental music for Alexander Ostrovsky&#x27;s play &quot;Snegurochka&quot; (&quot;The Snow Maiden&quot;), and all three of Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s symphonies and orchestral suites.

On SACD he has recorded Tchaikovsky&#x27;s complete symphonies (with the Gothenburg SO – BIS label) and ballets (with the Bergen PO – Chandos label). He has also made SACD recordings of music by Mahler, Bruckner, Wagner, Raff and Atterberg for Chandos with his old orchestra, the Royal Scottish NO.

Järvi has given an annual master class, the Neeme Järvi Summer Academy, held until 2008 in Pärnu, Estonia during the David Oistrakh festival. Since 2009, the masterclass has been held during the Leigo Music days in South Estonia. In addition, he has helped raise funds for the Estonian Academy of Music, which opened in September 2000.

For his extensive, high-quality discography, Järvi received the Lifetime Achievement Award during the 2018 Gramophone Awards.

==Personal life==
Järvi and his wife Liilia have three children, the conductors Paavo Järvi and Kristjan Järvi and the flautist Maarika Järvi. After emigrating to the United States, the Järvi family settled initially in Shrewsbury, New Jersey. He and his wife now reside in New York City.

<doc id="381637" wikidata="Q7333766" url="?curid=381637" title="Rights and responsibilities of marriages in the United States">
<text>According to the United States Government Accountability Office (GAO), there are 1,138 statutory provisions in which marital status is a factor in determining benefits, rights, and privileges. These rights were a key issue in the debate over federal recognition of same-sex marriage. Under the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), the federal government was prohibited from recognizing same-sex couples who were lawfully married under the laws of their state. The conflict between this definition and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution led the U.S. Supreme Court to rule DOMA unconstitutional on June 26, 2013, in the case of &quot;United States v. Windsor&quot;. DOMA was finally repealed and replaced by the Respect for Marriage Act on December 13, 2022, which retains the same statutory provisions as DOMA and extends them to interracial and same-sex married couples. 

Prior to the enactment of DOMA, the GAO identified 1,049 federal statutory provisions in which benefits, rights, and privileges are contingent on marital status or in which marital status is a factor. An update was published in 2004 by the GAO covering the period between September 21, 1996 (when DOMA was signed into law), and December 31, 2003. The update identified 120 new statutory provisions involving marital status, and 31 statutory provisions involving marital status repealed or amended in such a way as to eliminate marital status as a factor.

The first legally-recognized same-sex marriage occurred in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1971. On June 26, 2015, in the case of &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot;, the Supreme Court overturned &quot;Baker v. Nelson&quot; and ruled that marriage is a fundamental right guaranteed to all citizens, and thus legalized same-sex marriage nationwide.

<text>The thick-billed murre or Brünnich&#x27;s guillemot (Uria lomvia) is a bird in the auk family (Alcidae). This bird is named after the Danish zoologist Morten Thrane Brünnich. The very deeply black North Pacific subspecies &quot;Uria lomvia arra&quot; is also called Pallas&#x27; murre after its describer.

==Taxonomy==
The thick-billed murre was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the other auks in the genus &quot;Alca&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Alca lomvia&quot;. Linnaeus specified the type locality as boreal Europe but this was restricted in 1921 to Greenland by the German orthithologist Ernst Hartert. The thick-billed murre is now placed together with the common murre in the genus &quot;Uria&quot; that was introduced in 1760 by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson. The genus name is from Ancient Greek &quot;ouria&quot;, a waterbird mentioned by Athenaeus. The specific epithet &quot;lomvia&quot; is a Swedish word for an auk or diver. The English &quot;guillemot&quot; is from French &quot;guillemot&quot; probably derived from &quot;Guillaume&quot;, &quot;William&quot;. &quot;Murre&quot; is of uncertain origins, but may imitate the call of the common guillemot.

Four subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;U. l. lomvia&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – coastal northeast, southeast Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Jan Mayen (northeast of Iceland), north Scandinavia, Svalbard (north of Norway) to Novaya Zemlya (northwest Russia)
* &quot;U. l. eleonorae&quot; Portenko, 1937 – coastal east Taymyr Peninsula to New Siberian Islands (central north Russia)
* &quot;U. l. heckeri&quot; Portenko, 1944 – Wrangel and Herald Islands (north of northeast Siberia) and Chukchi Peninsula (northeast Siberia)
* &quot;U. l. arra&quot; (Pallas, 1811) – coastal Kamchatka Peninsula, Sea of Okhotsk, Kuril Islands and Commander Islands (east Russia), Aleutian Islands, west, southeast Alaska, north Yukon (northwest Canada)

==Description==

Since the extinction of the great auk in the mid-19th century, the murres are the largest living members of the Alcidae. The thick-billed murre and the closely related common guillemot (or common murre, &quot;U. aalge&quot;) are similarly sized, but the thick-billed still bests the other species in both average and maximum size. The thick-billed murre measures in total length, spans across the wings and weighs . The Pacific race (&quot;U. l. arra&quot;) is larger than the Atlantic race, especially in bill dimensions.

Adult birds are black on the head, neck, back and wings with white underparts. The bill is long and pointed. They have a small rounded black tail. The lower face becomes white in winter. This species produces a variety of harsh cackling calls at the breeding colonies, but is silent at sea.

They differ from the common murre in their thicker, shorter bill with white gape stripe and their darker head and back; the &quot;bridled&quot; morph is unknown in &quot;U. lomvia&quot; – a murre has either a white eye-stripe, or a white bill-stripe, or neither, but never both; it may be that this is character displacement, enabling individual birds to recognize conspecifics at a distance in the densely packed breeding colonies as the bridled morph is most common by far in North Atlantic colonies where both species of guillemots breed. In winter, there is less white on the thick-billed murre&#x27;s face. They look shorter than the common murre in flight. First year birds have smaller bills than adults and the white line on the bill is often obscure, making the bill an unreliable way to identify them at this age. The head pattern is the best way to distinguish first-year birds from common murres.

==Distribution and habitat==

The thick-billed murre is distributed across the polar and sub-polar regions of the Northern Hemisphere where four subspecies exist; one lives on the Atlantic and Arctic oceans of North America (&quot;U. l. lomvia&quot;), another on the Pacific coast of North America (&quot;U. l. arra&quot;), and two others that inhabit the Russian arctic (&quot;U. l. eleonorae&quot; and &quot;U. heckeri&quot;).

Thick-billed murres spend all of their lives at sea in waters which remain below 5°C, except during the breeding season where they form dense colonies on cliffs. They move south in winter into northernmost areas of the north Atlantic and Pacific, but only to keep in ice-free waters.

===As a vagrant===
Brünnich&#x27;s guillemot is a rare vagrant in European countries south of the breeding range. In Britain, over 30 individuals have been recorded, but over half of these were tideline corpses. Of those that were seen alive, only three have remained long enough to be seen by large numbers of observers. All three were in Shetland - winter individuals in February 1987 and November/December 2005, and a bird in an auk colony in summer 1989. The 1989 and 2005 birds were both found by the same observer, Martin Heubeck.

The species has been recorded once in Ireland, and has also been recorded in the Netherlands. In the western Atlantic, they may range as far as Florida, and in the Pacific to California. Before 1950, large numbers appeared on the North American Great Lakes in early winter, passing up the St. Lawrence River from the East coast. Such irruptions have not been seen since 1952.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Breeding===
Thick-billed murres form vast breeding colonies, sometimes composed of over a million breeding birds, on narrow ledges and steep cliffs which face the water.
They have the smallest territory of any bird, requiring less than one square foot per individual. A breeding pair will lay a single egg each year. Despite this, they are one of the most abundant marine birds in the Northern Hemisphere.

Adults perform communal displays early in the breeding season to time their breeding cycles. They do not build nests, but lay the egg directly on bare rock. Both parents are involved in incubating the egg and raising the young. Due to the enormous amount of energy needed to take off in flight, adults can only provide one food item at a time to their chick. Chicks spend between 18 and 25 days on the cliffs before leaving for the sea. Once ready to leave, the young will await nightfall and jump off the edge towards the water. A parent immediately jumps after and glides within centimeters of the fledgling. At sea, the male and the chick stay together for around 8 weeks during which the adult continues to provide food for the young.

Survival rates of the young is not based on the number of individuals in the colony, but rather on the age of the breeders within the colony. Offspring of inexperienced pairs grow more slowly than those of experienced breeders, possibly because they do not receive as much food from their parents. Also, pairs which contain at least one young breeding bird tend to have lower hatch rates. Older and experienced adults obtain the better nesting sites located in the center of the colony, while the inexperienced individuals are kept on the margins where their young are more likely to be preyed upon.

===Food and feeding===

The thick-billed murre&#x27;s flight is strong and direct, and they have fast wing beats due to the short wings. Like the other auks, these birds forage for food by using their wings to &#x27;swim&#x27; underwater. They are accomplished divers, reaching depths of up to 150 m and diving for up to four minutes at a time; usually however birds make either shallow short dives or dive down to 21–40 m for longer periods. While hunting, the diving trajectory resembles a flattened &#x27;U&#x27;. Birds will make long trips to get to favorite feeding grounds; while they usually forage several dozen km from their nest sites, they often travel more than 100 km to fish. The strong and direct flight of murres, which is, for their body size, the most costly form of sustained locomotion of any animal, is a result of their short wingspan.

The diving depths and durations regularly achieved by these birds indicate that they, and similar auks, have some—as yet unknown—mechanism to avoid diving sickness and lung collapse when surfacing. It is postulated that auks temporarily absorb excess gases into the vascular structure of their bones. From there, it is gradually released from temporary storage in a controlled process of decompression.

The nominate race feeds primarily on fish such as &quot;Gadus spp.&quot; and Arctic cod (&quot;Boreogadus saida&quot;), as well as the pelagic amphipod &quot;Parathemisto libellula&quot;. Other fish such as capelin (&quot;Mallotus villosus&quot;) and &quot;Myoxocephalus spp.&quot;, as well as other crustaceans, polychaetes, and a few molluscs, are found in their diet but in relatively low numbers. When wintering near Newfoundland, capelin can account for over 90 percent of their diet.

==Predators==
Thick-billed murres have few natural predators because the immense number of concentrated birds found on the breeding colonies and the inaccessibility of these breeding sites make it extremely difficult for them to be preyed upon. Their main predator is the glaucous gull (&quot;Larus hyperboreus&quot;), and these feed exclusively on eggs and chicks. The common raven (&quot;Corvus corax&quot;) may also try to obtain eggs and hatchlings when they are left unattended.

==Status and conservation==
Although declines have been observed in many parts of their range, the thick-billed murre is not a species of concern as the total population is estimated to contain between 15 and 20 million individuals worldwide.

Egg harvesting and hunting of adult birds are major threats in Greenland, where populations fell steeply between the 1960s and 1980s. In the Barents Sea region, the species has declined locally, due to influences associated with polar stations in Russia. Fisheries may also be a threat, but because thick-billed murres are better able to use alternative food sources the effect of over-fishing is not as severe as on the common murre. Pollution from oil at sea exerts another major threat. Murres are among the seabirds most sensitive to oil contamination. Incidental mortality brought on by entanglement with fishing gear is also an important cause of population decline.

Thick-billed murres are closely associated with sea-ice throughout the year. Consequently, some scientists believe that climate change may be a threat to this Arctic-breeding species. However the species seems adaptable. Populations at the southern edge of their range switched from feeding on ice-associated Arctic cod to warmer-water capelin as ice break-up became earlier. Dates for egg-laying advanced with the earlier disappearance of ice. The growth of chicks is slower in years when ice break-up is early relative to egg-laying by the murres. In extremely warm years, mosquitoes and heat kill some breeders.

<doc id="381643" wikidata="Q2745537" url="?curid=381643" title="Della Falls">
<text>Della Falls is a waterfall located within Strathcona Provincial Park on Vancouver Island in British Columbia, Canada. With a total height of , it ranks as the 16th tallest confirmed waterfall in Canada and the second tallest on Vancouver Island after Kiwi Falls in Schoen Lake Provincial Park.

==Discovery==
In 1899, prospector and trapper Joe Drinkwater discovered* Della Falls and named them after his wife. Drinkwater also built a 16 km (10 mi) hiking trail to the falls via Drinkwater Creek. Evidence of his gold mining operation, including an aerial tramway he built, can still be seen near the falls.

*Discovered in the European context. The falls were known of by First Nations Peoples long before Drinkwater walked there.

==Access==
The only way to reach Della Falls, other than by helicopter, is by crossing the entire Great Central Lake by boat; the only road access to the lake is at the opposite side from Strathcona Park. After the 35 km (21 mi) crossing, there is a dock that marks the beginning of Strathcona Park, and a camping area which can be used as a base camp before trying the next 15 km (9 mi) ascent to the base of Della Falls. More campsites are available along the trail and near the base of the falls. The hike, part of which follows an old logging railway, takes about seven hours one way and is suitable for intermediate level hikers.

<doc id="381644" wikidata="Q2545548" url="?curid=381644" title="2004 Constitution of Afghanistan">
<text>The 2004 Constitution of Afghanistan was the supreme law of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, which lasted from 2004 to 2021. It served as the legal framework between the Afghan government and the Afghan citizens. Although Afghanistan (Afghan Empire) was made a state in 1747 by Ahmad Shah Durrani, the earliest Afghan constitutional movement began during the reign of Emir Abdur Rahman Khan in the 1890s followed by the drafting in 1922 of a constitution. The 1964 Constitution of Afghanistan transformed Afghanistan into a modern democracy.

The constitution was approved by the consensus in January 2004 after the 2003 loya jirga. The Constitution consists of 162 articles and was officially signed by Hamid Karzai on January 26, 2004. It evolved out of the Afghan Constitution Commission mandated by the Bonn Agreement. The constitution provides for an elected President and National Assembly. The transitional government of interim president Hamid Karzai was put in place after the June 2002 loya jirga. The first presidential elections after the new constitution was in effect, took place in October 2004, and Karzai was elected to a five-year term. The first elections for the National Assembly were delayed until September 2005. The constitution was essentially abolished on August 15, 2021, with the overthrow and dissolution of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan by the Taliban. In August 2022, it was confirmed to the public that Supreme Leader Hibatullah Akhundzada had earlier formally abolished the 2004 Constitution on his authority.

==Eligibility of President==
Article 62 of the Constitution of Afghanistan of 2004 stated that a candidate for the office of President must:
*be a Muslim citizen of Afghanistan, born of Afghan parents;
*not be a citizen of another country;
*be at least forty years old;
*not have been convicted of crimes against humanity, a criminal act or deprived of civil rights by court;
*not have previously served more than two terms as president.

==Legislative branch==

The National Assembly of Afghanistan consisted of two houses: the Wolesi Jirga (House of the People) and the Meshrano Jirga (House of Elders).

The Wolesi Jirga, the more powerful house, consisted of a maximum of 250 delegates directly elected through a system of single non transferable vote (SNTV). Members were elected on a provincial basis and served for five years. At least 64 delegates were to be women; and ten Kuchi nomads were also elected among their peers. The Wolesi Jirga had the primary responsibility for making and ratifying laws and approving the actions of the president and had considerable veto power over senior appointments and policies

The Meshrano Jirga consisted of an unspecified number of local dignitaries and experts appointed by provincial councils, district councils, and the president. The president also appointed two representatives of the physically disabled. The lower house passed laws, approved budgets and ratified treaties – all of which required subsequent approval by the Meshrano Jirga.

==Judicial branch and court system==

The nation&#x27;s top court was the Stera Mahkama (Supreme Court). Its members were appointed by the president for 10-year terms. There were also High Courts, Appeals Courts, and local and district courts. Eligible judges had their training in either Islamic jurisprudence or secular law.

Courts were allowed to use Hanafi jurisprudence in situations where the Constitution lacks provisions.

==Cabinet==

The current cabinet consists of the president, his two vice-presidents and 25 ministers. The ministers are appointed by the president but need approval from the Wolesi Jirga (lower house).

==Provinces and Districts==
The constitution divides Afghanistan into 34 provinces. Each province is governed by a provincial council with members elected for four-year terms. Provincial Governors are appointed by the president. Provinces are divided into districts, which contain villages and towns. Every village and town will also have councils, with members serving for three years.

==Religion==

The Constitution describes Islam as its sacred law and the most commonly practiced faith throughout Afghanistan.

Followers of other religions are &quot;free to exercise their faith and perform their religious rites&quot; within the limits of the law. There is no mention of freedom of thought, and apostasy from Islam.

==Civil and human rights==

Citizens were guaranteed the right to life and liberty, to privacy, of peaceful assembly, from torture and of expression and speech. If accused of a crime, citizens held the right to be informed of the charges, to representation by an advocate, and to presumption of innocence.
Article 34 states, &quot;Freedom of expression shall be inviolable. Every Afghan shall have the right to express thoughts through speech, writing, illustrations as well as other means in accordance with provisions of this constitution. Every Afghan shall have the right, according to provisions of law, to print and publish on subjects without prior submission to state authorities. Directives related to the press, radio and television as well as publications and other mass media shall be regulated by law.&quot;

Provisions are made to ensure free education and healthcare for all citizens.

==Language==

Article 16 of the constitution states that &quot;from amongst Pashto, Dari, Uzbek, Turkmen, Balochi, Pashai, Nuristani and other current languages in the country, Pashto and Dari shall be the official languages of the state.&quot; In addition, other languages are considered &quot;the third official language&quot; in areas where they are spoken by a majority.

Article 20 states that the Afghan National Anthem (Wolesi Tarana) &quot;shall be in Pashto with the mention of &quot;God is Great&quot; as well as the names of the tribes of Afghanistan.&quot;

The constitution aims &quot;to foster and develop all languages of Afghanistan.&quot; (Article 16)

==Land ownership==
Foreigners are not allowed to own land in Afghanistan. Foreign individuals shall not have the right to own immovable property in Afghanistan.

<doc id="381650" wikidata="Q310811" url="?curid=381650" title="Cleomenes III">
<text>Cleomenes III () was one of the two kings of Sparta from 235 to 222 BC. He was a member of the Agiad dynasty and succeeded his father, Leonidas II. He is known for his attempts to reform the Spartan state.

From 229 to 222 BC, Cleomenes waged war against the Achaean League under Aratus of Sicyon. After being defeated by the Macedonians in the Battle of Sellasia in 222 BC, he fled to Ptolemaic Egypt. After a failed revolt in 219 BC, he committed suicide.

== Early life ==
Cleomenes was born in Sparta to the future Agiad king Leonidas II and his wife Cratesicleia. The exact year of Cleomenes&#x27; birth is unknown but historian Peter Green puts it between 265 BC and 260 BC.

Around 242 BC, Leonidas was exiled from Sparta and forced to seek refuge in the temple of Athena after opposing the reforms of the Eurypontid King, Agis IV. Cleomenes&#x27; brother-in-law, Cleombrotus, who was a supporter of Agis, became king. Meanwhile, having started his reforms Agis went on a campaign near the Isthmus of Corinth, which presented Leonidas with an opportunity to regain his throne. He quickly disposed of Cleombrotus, and went after Agis who had gone to find sanctuary. After holding out for quite some time, Agis was arrested and executed, along with other family members.

Following the execution of Agis, Cleomenes, who was around eighteen at the time, was forced by his father to marry Agis&#x27; widow, Agiatis, who was a wealthy heiress. According to legend, Cleomenes was hunting when his father sent him a message telling him to return immediately to Sparta. When he returned to the city, he saw that it was being decorated for a wedding and when he asked his father who was getting married, his father replied that he, Cleomenes, was. It was reported that Cleomenes was doubtful about the marriage because his father had had Agiatis&#x27; husband executed. Nevertheless, the marriage went ahead.

== Early years ==
Cleomenes ascended the throne of Sparta in 235 BC, following the death of his father. Cleomenes had been inspired by Agis as told to him by his lover Xenares and followed through on his reforms. Meanwhile, the Achaean League under the command of Aratus of Sicyon was trying to unite all of the Peloponnese. Upon hearing of Leonidas&#x27; death, Aratus began attacking the cities of Arcadia, which bordered Achaea. Plutarch says that Aratus made these moves to discover Sparta&#x27;s inclinations.

In 229 BC, the cities of Tegea, Mantinea, Caphyae and Orchomenus, who were allied with the Aetolian League, joined Sparta. Historians Polybius and Sir William Smith claim that Cleomenes seized these cities by treachery; however the translator of Plutarch on Sparta, Richard Talbert, claims he did so at their own request. Later that year, the ephors sent Cleomenes to seize Athenaeum, a fort on the Spartan border with Megalopolis which was being disputed by both cities. Cleomenes seized the fort and improved its fortifications. Meanwhile, the Achaean League summoned a meeting of its assembly and declared war against Sparta. In retaliation for fortifying Athenaeum, Aratus carried out a night attack on Tegea and Orchomenus but when his supporters inside those cities failed to help, he retreated, hoping to remain undetected.

Cleomenes discovered the attempted night attack and sent a message to Aratus asking the purpose of the expedition. Aratus replied that he had come to stop Cleomenes from fortifying Athenaeum. Cleomenes response was, &quot;if it&#x27;s all the same to you, write and tell me why you brought along those torches and ladders.&quot;

== Cleomenean War ==

Cleomenes advanced into Arcadia before being called back by the ephors. When Aratus captured Caphyae, the ephors sent him out again. He ravaged the territory of Argos with an army of 5,000 men before being confronted by the new strategos of the Achaean League, Aristomachos of Argos and his army consisting of 20,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry at Pallantium. Aratus, who accompanied Aristomachos as an adviser, urged him to retreat. Smith agrees with Aratus&#x27; assessment that 20,000 Achaeans were no match for 5,000 Spartans.

This success greatly encouraged Cleomenes, and when he heard that Aratus was attacking Sparta&#x27;s ally, Elis, he set off to confront them. The Spartan army fell upon the Achaean army near Mount Lycaeum and routed it. Aratus took advantage of a rumour saying that he had been killed in the battle and seized Mantinea. Aratus&#x27; victory at Mantinea reduced the Spartans&#x27; desire for war and they began to oppose Cleomenes&#x27; war effort.

Meanwhile, the Eurypontid King of Sparta, Eudamidas III, who was the son of Agis IV and Agiatis, died. Cleomenes recalled his uncle, who had fled after Agis&#x27; execution to Messene, to assume the throne. However, as soon as he returned to Sparta he was assassinated. Cleomenes&#x27; part in the assassination is unknown, with Polybius claiming that he ordered it, but Plutarch disagreeing.

Having bribed the ephors to allow him to continue campaigning, Cleomenes advanced into the territory of Megalopolis and started to besiege the village of Leuctra. As Cleomenes was besieging the village, an Achaean army under the command of Aratus attacked the Spartans. In the initial attack, the Spartans were repelled. However, Lydiadas of Megalopolis, the cavalry commander, disobeyed Aratus&#x27; order not to pursue the Spartans. When the cavalry scattered while trying to cross some difficult terrain, Cleomenes&#x27; skirmishers managed to defeat them. Encouraged by this counter-attack, the Spartans charged the main body of the Achaean army and routed them.

Confident of his strong position, Cleomenes began plotting against the ephors. After gaining the support of his stepfather, he embarked with him on a whirlwind military expedition against his opponents, and when they requested to stay in Arcadia due to exhaustion he returned to Sparta to carry out his reform plans. When he reached the city, he sent some of his loyal followers to kill the ephors. Four of the ephors were killed, while the fifth, Agylaeus, managed to escape and seek sanctuary in a temple. Having removed the ephors, Cleomenes began to implement his reforms.

== The reforms ==
After having removed the ephors, who obstructed his political will, Cleomenes used the character of Lycurgus the lawgiver, which allowed him to legitimize the violence, and he began his reforms. He first handed over all his land to the state; he was soon followed in this by his stepfather and his friends and the rest of the citizens. He divided up all the land and gave an equal lot to every citizen, a unique achievement. The land was pooled and redistributed in equal portion to some 4,000 citizens (although the first Agis plan projected 4,500 citizens). These citizens were half old citizens, the so-called inferiors, and half new citizens who for the most part were mercenaries who fought with the Spartan army. There were also Perioeci granted land for their dedication to Sparta. Those 4,000 citizens enhanced the body of Spartiates (Spartan full citizens), which had dwindled drastically (known as oliganthropia).

For the first time the amount of produce the Helots had to surrender to each klaros-holder was specified in absolute quantities rather than as a proportion of the annual yield. Cleomenes trained 4,000 Hoplites and restored the ancient Spartan military and social discipline.

The citizens&#x27; children were required to pass through an agoge, and the adult citizens had to practise again the old austere diaita centred upon communal living within the framework of the military-minded masses. More significantly, Cleomenes decreed that his new army should follow the model of the Macedonian army, a century after the bitter defeat of the Athenians and Thebans to the Macedonians at Chaeronea. This was characterised by the use of the Macedonian sarissa, a five-meter pike, which performed well over the next two campaigning seasons. Cleomenes completed his reforms by placing his brother, Eucleidas, in charge, making him the first Agiad king on the Eurypontid throne.

== Macedonian intervention ==
In 226 BC, the citizens of Mantinea appealed to Cleomenes to expel the Achaean garrison from the city. One night, he and his troops crept into the city and removed the Achaean garrison before marching off to nearby Tegea. From Tegea, the Spartans advanced into Achaea, where Cleomenes hoped to force the League to face him in a pitched battle. Cleomenes advanced with his army to Dyme and was met by the entire Achaean army. In the battle, the Spartans routed the Achaean phalanx, killing many of the Achaeans and capturing others. Following this victory, Cleomenes captured the city of Lasium and presented it to the Elians.

The oligarchies opposed the Cleomenian reforms. With Cleomenes&#x27; quick victories this opposition increased throughout all the Peloponnese. Cleomenes took Corinth and other strategic places. The Cleomenian reforms, although they were not intended to be applied to the defeated populations, was a significant factor behind the campaign successes of the Spartan king. Indeed, some of the Achaean population wanted to be debt-free and were willing to share their lands for more equity. In reality, Cleomenes did not care that much about the defeated population and chose to negotiate with the oligarchies even if the enmity between Aratus and Cleomenes was too great to enable them to come to an agreement.

After this diplomatic failure, Aratus chose to negotiate with Antigonus III Doson, King of Macedonia, who decided to go to war against Sparta. Despite numerous attempts to break through the defensive line and reach Lechaeum in the Corinth Isthmus, Antigonus&#x27; forces failed and suffered considerable losses. At that time Argos rebelled and Cleomenes had to send 2,000 men to deal with the situation. With this lack of men, Cleomenes abandoned the Isthmus and retreated to Mantinea. At this point, Cleomenes could not avoid retreating and letting the Macedonian army advance through Arcadia.

Knowing that Cleomenes had received the money to pay for his mercenaries from Ptolemy, Antigonus, according to Peter Green, seems to have ceded some territory in Asia Minor to Ptolemy in return for Ptolemy withdrawing his financial support of Sparta. After that, Cleomenes entered Megalopolis and destroyed it as well as raided the territory of Argos. The damage caused by those raids was not so much a factor of military domination for Cleomenes but rather a break in the unavoidable defeats of the Spartan army, which could not face the Macedonian army in pitched battle. In 222, at the Battle of Sellasia the Spartans were defeated during which the Macedonian cavalry overcame the Spartan cavalry. The Spartan phalanx was overwhelmed by the deeper ranks of the Macedonian phalanx and almost destroyed, and only a few Spartans escaped from the battle, with Cleomenes at their side.

== Defeat, exile and death ==
In 222 BC Cleomenes was defeated in the Battle of Sellasia by the Achaeans, who received military aid from Antigonus III Doson of Macedon. Cleomenes returned to Sparta, advised the citizens to submit to Antigonus, and fled to Alexandria to his ally Ptolemy Euergetes of Egypt, hoping for assistance in regaining his throne.

However, when Ptolemy died, his son and successor, Ptolemy Philopator neglected Cleomenes and eventually put him under house arrest. Together with his friends, he escaped his house arrest in 219 BC and tried to incite a revolt. When he received no support from the population of Alexandria, he and his friends avoided capture by committing suicide. The last to kill himself was Panteus, Cleomenes&#x27; favourite and right-hand man, who was ordered to make sure everyone was dead before taking his own life. When Panteus struck Cleomenes&#x27; ankle with the tip of his blade, he saw that the king was still alive; he kissed him and sat beside him, waiting for his last breath, and then Panteus embraced him and took his own life over the dead body of Cleomenes. Thus died the man who nearly conquered all of the Peloponnese and is described by William Smith as &quot;the last truly great man of Sparta, and, excepting perhaps Philopoemen, of all Greece.&quot;

<doc id="381651" wikidata="Q5034991" url="?curid=381651" title="Cape Peron">
<text>Cape Peron is a headland at Rockingham, at the southern end of Cockburn Sound in Western Australia. The cape is locally known as Point Peron, and is noted for its protected beaches, limestone cliffs, reefs and panoramic views. Cape Peron includes the suburb of Peron, and &quot;Point Peron&quot; is the designation of a minor promontory on the south side of the cape&#x27;s extremity.

The feature was named after the French naturalist and zoologist François Péron, who accompanied the expedition of Nicolas Baudin along the western coast of Australia in 1801.

A causeway was constructed in 1973 between Cape Peron and Garden Island to carry vehicular traffic between the mainland and the island. Since the island houses HMAS Stirling, a Royal Australian Navy base, access is restricted by the military.

The wreck of RMS &quot;Orizaba&quot; (1886–1905) lies on Five Fathom Bank, west of the cape.

==Land use==
The cape and southern environs comprise a crown land reserve on which a number of recreational resort activities and camps have been established, including buildings constructed of asbestos material which are now known to be unsuitable for human use. During World War II, an observation post for the nearby coastal battery was located on the hilltop, and the old buildings remain, being listed as a permanent entry on the national estate.

Control was vested in the Commonwealth of Australia until 10 January 1964, when the land was transferred to the state of Western Australia on condition that future use was restricted to purposes of public recreation and/or parklands. It was further agreed that when existing holiday-camp leases expired, the entire area would become an A-class reserve.

Cape Peron is currently included in planning by the state&#x27;s Department of Environment and Conservation for the Rockingham Lakes Regional Park. It is one of the scheme&#x27;s main areas or estates and a former environment minister, Donna Faragher, drew attention to its &quot;extremely high nature conservation values [providing] the local community with a unique opportunity to enjoy the natural environment&quot;.

=== Military use ===

From 1942 until 1945, Cape Peron was the site of the &quot;K&quot; Battery complex, one of a chain of coastal gun emplacements defending the Perth region between Swanbourne in the north and Cape Peron in the south. &quot;K&quot; Battery was established as part of Australian coastal defences in 1942 following the fall of Singapore to the Axis powers and the imminent threat of invasion of Australia by Japanese forces. This chain of gun emplacements was colloquially named &quot;Fortress Fremantle&quot; and included sites at both Rottnest Island and Garden Island. During World War II, Fremantle was not only the Allied forces&#x27; largest submarine base in the southern hemisphere, it was also an important logistical port, troop station and location for ship repairs.

The battery consisted of two American field guns, two observation posts and numerous support buildings including ammunition magazines, engine and generator rooms, and troop accommodation for approximately 100 troops. The guns were placed to cover any shipping within range of Rockingham, Safety Bay and the western side of Garden Island. In addition to providing cover for shipping, &quot;K&quot; Battery also provided cover for a boom defence across the south channel that provided access to Cockburn Sound between Cape Peron and Garden Island. The battery never fired upon an enemy target and was decommissioned in 1945.
, the complex lies in a state of disrepair with the gun emplacements and observation posts suffering from extensive structural damage due to erosion, vandalism, reclamation by the natural environment and pedestrian activity. There have been calls over the years for the site to be rehabilitated and repaired into a memorial to remember Australia&#x27;s wartime history. There have been various restoration efforts with Australian Army Reservists and the Department of Environment and Conservation taking part, but limited funding has resulted in the complex remaining in disrepair. A group known as the Point Peron Restoration Project is leading a push to restore the site, stating their goals as being:

===Proposed private development===
A proposal for an extensive private residential canal and marina redevelopment caused much controversy among the local community until refused necessary planning approval by the state government on 1 March 2018. The project was advanced by a state government agency, LandCorp, in partnership with Cedar Woods Properties Limited, and titled &quot;Mangles Bay Marina Based Tourist Precinct&quot; Acceptance of the proposal would have required abrogation of a 1964 compact for everlasting public ownership, and transfer of to the developer. 

Prolonged public objection led by &quot;Hands Off Point Peron&quot; claimed such development would damage seagrass beds, threaten the stability of ecosystems at nearby Lake Richmond and result in significant long-term maintenance expense to taxpayers, besides loss of the land&#x27;s current status as a regional park.

== Flora and fauna ==

=== Terrestrial flora ===
Cape Peron is an unprotected headland that is subsequently exposed year round to severe prevailing southerly and westerly winds, and hot, dry summers. These harsh environmental conditions result in the endemic species of flora to Cape Peron being typical of Western Australian coastal shrubs. Hardy, halotolerant plants such as &quot;Spinifex&quot;, sea-heath (&quot;Frankenia pauciflora&quot;) and coastal sword-sedge (&quot;Lepidosperma gladiatum&quot;) are commonplace close to the shore, abating to coastal scrublands that consist of wattle, coastal daisy-bush and grasslands, amongst other species.

=== Oceanic flora ===
The underwater flora of Cape Peron consists of many species of algae, including red, green and brown algae, that develop dependent on the exposure of the reef platform they grow on to weather and tides. Away from the rocky limestone reefs, expanses of sandy seafloor beds contain large seagrass meadows containing a variety of species of kelp.

=== Terrestrial fauna ===
Studies undertaken by the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) have recorded an extensive variety of fauna at Cape Peron. It is common to find large seabirds, for instance osprey, albatross and cormorants amongst the cliff faces or searching for prey. Wading birds, such as whimbrels and a variety of gulls, are also found closer to the shoreline and nesting in the cliffs of Cape Peron. Little penguins have also been spotted at the site, although they are not known to breed at, or inhabit the site. Further away from the coast, and into the scrubland of Cape Peron, it is common to find rainbow bee-eaters, grey fantails, inland thornbills and silvereyes. An extensive survey of terrestrial fauna undertaken by the EPA found ninety-six species of fauna living at Cape Peron. Of the ninety-six species found, there were: sixty-six species of avifauna, nineteen species of reptiles including lizards and snakes, five species of amphibians and six species of mammals. All native animals found at Cape Peron are protected under the &quot;Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999&quot;. Furthermore, a total of forty-seven of the species observed are listed as protected on the Department of Environment and Conservation&#x27;s priority list.

=== Oceanic fauna ===
The varied underwater landscape of Cape Peron accommodates a variety of sea life. The intertidal reef platforms host an array of sea squirts, sponges, urchins and molluscs that cling to the reef. In and around the various reefs, ledges, overhangs and swathes of seagrass meadows it is not uncommon to find a sizeable variety of marine life, including but not limited to: bottlenose dolphins, grey nurse sharks, great white sharks, Australian sea lions, loggerhead turtles, pink snapper, King George whiting, baitfish, tailor, garfish, skipjack trevally, and blue swimmer crabs.

<text>Fudbalski klub Partizan (, ; ), often referred to in English as Partizan Belgrade, is a Serbian professional football club based in Belgrade. It forms a major part of the JSD Partizan multi-sport club. The club plays in the Serbian SuperLiga and has spent its entire history in the top tier of Yugoslav and Serbian football, winning a total of 46 official trophies, finishing in the Yugoslav league all-time table as second. Its home ground is the Partizan Stadium, where the team have played since 1949. Partizan holds records such as playing in the first European Champions Cup match on 4 September 1955, as well as becoming the first club from Southeast Europe to reach the European Champions Cup final, when it did so in 1966. Partizan was the first Serbian club to compete in the group stage of the UEFA Champions League.

The club has a long-standing rivalry with Red Star Belgrade. Matches between these two clubs are known as the Eternal derby (&quot;Večiti derbi&quot;) and rate as one of the greatest cross-town clashes in the world. Partizan also has supporters in some of the former-Yugoslav republics and in the Serbian diaspora. Their popular nickname &#x27;The Steamroller&#x27; (Parni valjak) was originally used in the press report after the 7–1 hammering of Red Star at the 13th Eternal Derby on 6 December 1953. This nickname was later embedded in the lyrics of the club anthem.

Partizan Youth Academy is one of the most renowned and export-oriented in Europe. CIES (University of Neuchâtel International Centre for Sports Studies) Football Observatory report of November 2015 ranks Partizan at the top place of training clubs out of the 31 European leagues surveyed. CIES report of 2019 confirmed Partizan as the most productive training club in Europe, with 75 of their academy graduates currently playing across 31 European top divisions.

== History ==

=== Founders and origins ===

Partizan was founded on 4 October 1945 in Belgrade, as a football section of the Central House of the Yugoslav Army &quot;Partizan&quot;, and was named in honour of the Partisans, the communist military formation who fought against fascism during World War II in Yugoslavia. The club was formed and initially managed by the group of young high officers of the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army and veterans of the Spanish Civil War. Among them were Koča Popović, Peko Dapčević, Svetozar Vukmanović, Bogdan Vujošević, Mijalko Todorović, Otmar Kreačić, Božo Švarc and Ratko &quot;Čoče&quot; Vujović – elected the first president of the club. Two days after its establishment, Partizan made its first step on the football scene, with the friendly match against selection of Zemun that ended 4–2. Silvester Šereš entered the record books as the first goal scorer in the history of Partizan, while goalkeeper Franjo Glaser was simultaneously the first club manager. Just three weeks later, Partizan went on the first of many international tours, travelling to Czechoslovakia where they beat the selection of Slovak Army with 3–1. At the time, just months after the World War II in Yugoslavia ended, no organized football competition was yet restored, so Partizan played only friendly games and tournaments both home and abroad. The club&#x27;s first international engagement was a meeting against another army side, CSKA Moscow from what was then Soviet Union, on 6 December 1945 in Belgrade.

=== Partizan&#x27;s babies – the first European final (1958–1966) ===

By the mid-1950s, the first big Partizan generation was well over its peak. Only two titles and four cups in its first 15 years of existence were not enough for a club of Partizan&#x27;s stature, ambition and popularity. In 1958, the club left way behind 13 years of playing in blue-red kits and adopted the now famous black and white colors. The change in the club&#x27;s image and appearance was followed by radical changes in the playing squad. The number of young players, offspring of Partizan&#x27;s own youth ranks known as &quot;Partizanove bebe&quot; (The Partizan&#x27;s babies), soon emerged into one of the best generations Europe&#x27;s ever seen. The rise of the generation began with Milutin Šoškić, Fahrudin Jusufi, Jovan Miladinović, Velibor Vasović, Milan Galić, Ilija Mitić, Zvezdan Čebinac and Vladica Kovačević. Very soon, they were joined by Lazar Radović, Velimir Sombolac, Ljubomir Mihajlović and Mustafa Hasanagić, and finally Ivan Ćurković, Josip Pirmajer, Branko Rašović and Radoslav Bečejac. Managers Illés Spitz, Florijan Matekalo and Stjepan Bobek monitored and guided their development. The decision to rely mostly on talented youngsters scouted from all over the country quickly gave results – Partizan took three consecutive championship titles, in 1961, 1962 and 1963, the first title hat-trick in the Yugoslav First League. Efficient and attractive performances earned the club its popular nickname &quot;Parni valjak&quot; (&quot;The Steamroller&quot;). In 1964–65, the team added the fourth title in five years (interrupted by city rival Red Star during the 1963–64 season). As early as the 1960s, a fierce and intense rivalry grew up between Partizan and Red Star.
The 1965–66 European Cup campaign was the crown of this generation&#x27;s career. After eliminating French Nantes (2–0, 2–2) and German champion Werder Bremen (3–0, 1–0) in the first two rounds, Partizan were drawn against Sparta Prague in the quarter-finals. In the first leg, held in Prague, Partizan suffered a hard 4–1 defeat. Although they were not given any chances in the return leg in Belgrade, Partizan pulled off a convincing 5–0 win in front of 50,000 spectators, and with aggregate score 6–4 qualified for the semifinals. The semi-finals would see Partizan taking part in an emotional tie that would bring Manchester United, in their first season back in the European Cup after the Munich air disaster, returning to the scene of their final game, at the JNA Stadium, before embarking on that fateful journey home (on the way home from a European Cup quarter-final victory against Red Star, which was played at JNA Stadium, the aircraft carrying the Manchester United players, officials and journalists crashed while attempting to take off after refuelling in Munich).Manchester United, led by George Best and Bobby Charlton, awaited finally them on the last step to the finals. Partizan won the first leg at JNA Stadium 2–0, and resisted the heavy pressure on Old Trafford, conceding only once; with a 2–1 aggregate scoreline, they eliminated the English giants. Partizan&#x27;s babies achieved the greatest success in history of Partizan, a place in the 1966 European Cup Final against Real Madrid. The final game was played on 11 May at Heysel Stadium, Brussels. Until the 70th minute, Partizan was 1–0 up through a goal by Velibor Vasović, but ultimately lost to the Spaniards 2–1. Partizan may have come close to a famous victory, but they had now missed their chance as the side was immediately broken up with their star players heading west. Still, Partizan became the first club from the Balkans and Eastern Europe to have played in a European Cup final.

=== The brief return – the first European trophy (1976–1982) ===

On 11 July 1976, in Ljubljana, Partizan played the last game of the season against Olimpija and needed a win to clinch the title ahead of rivals Hajduk Split. In the last second before the final whistle, Nenad Bjeković scored the winning goal and Partizan won 0–1. The seventh championship trophy was finally won, after full decade of waiting, by the new generation of players, such as Momčilo Vukotić, Bjeković, Rešad Kunovac, Ilija Zavišić, Refik Kozić, Ivan Golac, Radmilo Ivančević, Boško Đorđević, Nenad Stojković. Partizan then won its eighth title in 1977–78, enforced with Nikica Klinčarski, Petar Borota, Slobodan Santrač, Aleksandar Trifunović, Xhevat Prekazi and Pavle Grubješić. That same year, Partizan won its first European trophy, the Mitropa Cup. The &quot;Black &amp; Whites&quot; finished first in Group A, ahead of Perugia and Zbrojovka Brno and defeated Hungarian side Honvéd in the finals, 1–0. Its manager was Ante Mladinić. Unexpectedly, the following 1978–79 season turned out to be the worst in Partizan history: they finished 15th in the league, barely avoiding relegation with a 4–2 victory against Budućnost in the last fixture. The new crisis was serious, which reflected in the results next season, when Partizan finished 13th. It took a two more seasons, but Partizan eventually recovered.

=== Memorable years (1982–1991) ===

When Momčilo Vukotić, Nenad Stojković and Nikica Klinčarski were joined by Ljubomir Radanović, Zvonko Živković, Zoran Dimitrijević and Dragan Mance, another great generation was formed. Partizan became champion for 1982–83 season, in large part due to extraordinary performances of a young Dragan Mance. He helped Partizan win the league by scoring 15 goals, and immediately became a fan favourite. He also led the club in their 1984–85 UEFA Cup second round tie against Queens Park Rangers, one of the most memorable matches in the club&#x27;s history. QPR won the first leg 6–2, but Partizan advanced after a 4–0 return victory. A goal which Mance scored against the English side is considered one of the most remarkable goals in the history of Partizan. That match was voted 70th among the Top 100 greatest matches in the history of football in a poll organized by Eurosport in September 2009. On 3 September 1985, the players tragically lost their teammate and the fans lost their idol – Mance died in a car crash on Novi Sad-Belgrade highway. He was only 22 years old, and at the peak of his popularity. Even today, Mance is considered to be the greatest club legend by the fans of Partizan. In his honour, the street next to the club&#x27;s stadium in Belgrade has carried his name since 2011.

In 1985–86, Partizan won the title with a 4–0 win over Željezničar due to better goal difference than second-placed Red Star. However, Yugoslav FA President Slavko Šajber decided that the entire last round of fixtures had to be replayed after accusations that certain results had been fixed. Partizan refused to replay its match, after which the game was awarded 3–0 to Željezničar, and the title was given to Red Star, who thus got to play in 1986–87 European Cup. Because of these events, 12 clubs started the next 1986–87 season with a deduction of six points, Partizan among them. Vardar, who had not been deducted six points, won the title and subsequently participated in 1987–88 European Cup. However, after a sequence of appeals and lawsuits which eventually led to Yugoslav Constitutional Court, the original final table of 1985–86, with Partizan as champions, was officially recognized in mid-1987. Also, the points deduction from 1986–87 season was annulled and the title was given to Partizan, who headed the table without the deduction. These controversial events prevented the generation of Milko Đurovski, Fahrudin Omerović, Zvonko Varga, Vladimir Vermezović, Admir Smajić, Goran Stevanović, Nebojša Vučićević, Miloš Đelmaš, Srečko Katanec, Fadil Vokrri and Bajro Župić from showing their full potential in Europe.

Partizan spent the final years in Yugoslavia undergoing significant organizational changes. In 1989, former goalkeeper Ivan Ćurković became club president while Mirko Marjanović became the president of Partizan&#x27;s executive board. Most important, Partizan players in these final years were Predrag Mijatović, Slaviša Jokanović, Predrag Spasić, Dragoljub and Branko Brnović, Budimir Vujačić, Vujadin Stanojković, Darko Milanič and Džoni Novak. However, this great generation was overshadowed by their crosstown rival Red Star and its rampage through domestic league, Europe and the world. Partizan only won the 1989 national cup, 32 years after the last victory in that competition. The last trophy won before the breakup of Yugoslavia was the 1989 Yugoslav Super Cup, the first and the only one organized. Also in the same season 1988/89, Partizan won the prestigious international tournament Uhrencup, which is played every year in Switzerland and to this day. That year, Partizan took three trophies which is a club record in one season. In 1987, Partizan signed Chinese national team players Jia Xiuquan and Liu Haiguang and they entered history as they, along Xie Yuxin and Gu Guangming, were the first Chinese footballers ever to have played in Europe.

=== Dark decade and domestic success (1990s) ===

After the death of President Josip Broz Tito in 1980, ethnic tension grew in Yugoslavia, with the follow, that in the early 1990s the Yugoslav state began to fall apart, and the civil war broke out. At the end of May in 1992, the United Nations Security Council imposed sanctions against the country, which led to political isolation, economic decline and hyperinflation of the Yugoslav dinar, and finally dislodged Yugoslav football from the international scene. The disintegration of Yugoslavia, the Yugoslav wars from 1991 to 1995, the resulting difficulties, as well as the sanctions had hit all Yugoslav clubs hard. After the breakup of SFR Yugoslavia in 1991, a new Yugoslavia was formed out from Serbia and Montenegro and was named FR Yugoslavia. Notwithstanding, Partizan won during the war two titles in a row, in 1993 and 1994. The next two championships Partizan won came in 1996 and 1997, but after only few years of peace, the Yugoslav clubs stood again before difficult times. Between 1998 and 1999, peace was broken again because the situation in Kosovo worsened with continued clashes between Yugoslav security forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army. The confrontations led to the Kosovo War and finally to the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, which started four days after the 112th Red Star–Partizan derby, and this without a UN Mandate. The bombing campaign was criticized, especially for the number of civilian casualties that resulted from the bombing. By this time, Partizan won in 1999 a further championship title, again during a war.

During these turbulent 1990s, the club won also several national cups, this in 1992, 1994 and 1998. The key man for these trophies was Ljubiša Tumbaković, who became the most successful manager in Partizan&#x27;s history. In 1997, Partizan was reintroduced to European competitions following the lift of the UEFA ban on clubs from FR Yugoslavia, but while the national team continued where they had stopped in the spring of 1992, the clubs had all their results erased and were treated as the beginners in the European competitions. The decision met with incomprehension among the club officials of the Yugoslav clubs. That decision will have long-term catastrophic consequences for Partizan – instead of enjoying the merits of its own many-year work, they would get harder opponents from the start and the competition would start already in July. This decade has been marked by numerous team changes and the circle of selling the best players to richer European clubs after just a couple of seasons of first-team football and replacing them with fresh young talents. Many players are credited with the successes of the nineties, such as Predrag Mijatović, Slaviša Jokanović, Savo Milošević, Albert Nađ, Dragan Ćirić, Zoran Mirković, Saša Ćurčić, Branko Brnović, Goran Pandurović, Dražen Bolić, Niša Saveljić, Damir Čakar, Budimir Vujačić, Ivan Tomić, Georgi Hristov, Đorđe Tomić, Ivica Kralj, Mateja Kežman and many others.

=== The new beginning (2000–2007) ===
The new millennium has arrived, but the goals remain the same. In the last 12 years, Partizan has won eight national championships, four cups and managed to qualify two times for the UEFA Champions League and five times for the UEFA Europa League. Led by Ljubiša Tumbaković, the club won two championship titles in a row, in 2001–02 and 2002–03. In Europe, Partizan did not have much success in those seasons, though the next one would become its best season in Europe after 1965–66, where it reached the 1966 European Cup final.

The club&#x27;s management took the 2003 season very seriously, appointing as its new coach the former World Player of the Year Lothar Matthäus, and brought some top and experienced players like Taribo West from 1.FC Kaiserslautern, Ljubinko Drulović from Benfica and Tomasz Rząsa from Feyenoord. For the first time in its history, the club played in the UEFA Champions League after eliminating Bobby Robson&#x27;s Newcastle United. In Belgrade, Partizan lost by 0–1, but in rematch at St James&#x27; Park, they won by Ivica Iliev&#x27;s goal in regular time and reached the group stages after a penalty shoot-out. Later on, Partizan was drawn in a tough group with Real Madrid (the previous year&#x27;s Champions League semi-finalist), Porto (the winner of the 2002–03 UEFA Cup and the eventual winner of the competition) and Marseille (the eventual runners-up of the 2003–04 UEFA Cup). The Partizan Stadium was a tough ground for the opposition and the team did not 
lose a home game, playing out a 0–0 draw with Real Madrid&#x27;s famous &quot;Galácticos&quot;, which included players such as Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo, Luís Figo, Roberto Carlos, Raúl and David Beckham; a 1–1 draw with Porto, led by coach José Mourinho; and Marseille, with its superstars Fabien Barthez and Didier Drogba, while playing some inspired football in the away match in Madrid (0–1), Marseille (0–3) and Porto (1–2). They are the first Serbian team to qualify for the main draw of this elite European club competition since its inception in 1992.

Playing in Europe was reflected in the championship, and Partizan lost the title. New coach Vladimir Vermezović taken the charge of a team and he superiority won the championship in 2005. Also, he became the only coach who has managed to take the team to the knockout stage of a European competition since new format. That happened in the 2004–05 UEFA Cup, where Partizan reached the round-of-16. Later on, he was eliminated by CSKA Moscow, the eventual winner of the competition. Poor results in domestic and international competitions in 2006 prompted the club&#x27;s officials to look for a new head coach. First, Jürgen Röber was brought in, then later Miodrag Ješić, though neither succeeded in winning the domestic title. Although Partizan has managed to qualify for the 2006–07 UEFA Cup group stage, that season was viewed as a failure.

=== Contemporary history (2007–2020)===
Former Partizan player Slaviša Jokanović were appointed as Partizan&#x27;s new head coach, with the club also adding a new sport director in Ivan Tomić. The club strengthened its squad with some foreigners like Juca, Almami Moreira and Lamine Diarra. The 2007–08 and 2008–09 season will remain as one of the most successful in club&#x27;s domestic history. In 2008–09, the club successfully defended their league and cup double from the 2007–08 season, the first time this occurred its history. But in Europe, Partizan suffered a real shock: UEFA expelled Partizan from the 2007–08 UEFA Cup season and fined the club €30,056 due to crowd trouble at their away qualifying match against Zrinjski Mostar, which forced the match to be interrupted for ten minutes. UEFA judged travelling Partizan fans to have been the culprits of the trouble, but Partizan were allowed to play the return leg while the appeal was being processed. Partizan&#x27;s appeal, however, was rejected and Zrinjski Mostar qualified for the next round, although Partizan beat them by an aggregate score of 11–1. Next season, the club enforced its squad with Brazilian striker Cléo; Partizan demolished Welsh champions Rhyl with a score of 8–0 (12–0 on aggregate) on 21 July 2009. This score is their largest ever winning margin in European competitions. After relegation from the Champions League, Partizan qualified two times in a row for the second tier of UEFA competition. The &quot;Black &amp; Whites&quot; played in the 2008 UEFA Cup and 2009 Europa League group stage but as the same in 2007, the club did not advance any further.
Unfortunately, even though a good European season was behind them, the club ended the season trophyless.

After Jokanović, the club decided to give a chance to the young coach and former Partizan footballer Aleksandar Stanojević. He became the youngest head coach in the history of Partizan. Stanojević took over the club in very difficult period and managed to win the championship in 2010, although Partizan was 10 points behind from the 1st placed Red Star Belgrade. In the 2011, the club won the double. In UEFA competitions, Partizan qualified for the 2010–11 UEFA Champions League after beating Anderlecht for the second time. At the Partizan Stadium the result was 2–2. In Brussels at the Constant Vanden Stock Stadium result was also 2–2. The key man was Cléo, who scored two goals against the Belgians. After penalty drama, Partizan reached again the UEFA Champions League group stage. Now, the draw for the group phase decided that Partizan will play in group H, alongside Arsenal, Shakhtar Donetsk (the winner of the 2008–09 UEFA Cup) and Sporting Braga (the eventual runner-up of the 2010–11 UEFA Europa League). On the matchday 1, Partizan lost against Shakhtar on Donbas Arena in Donetsk (0–1). Next game Partizan played against Arsenal at Partizan Stadium and lost 1–3 after they played inspired football with a 10-man team in the last 30 minutes of the match. In two matches against Sporting Braga, Partizan failed to score and they lost both games (0–2 in Braga; 0–1 in Belgrade). The last two rounds in the group have also brought inspired football, but unfortunately it wasn&#x27;t enough so Shakhtar Donetsk and &quot;The Gunners&quot; defeated Partizan once again, 0–3 in Belgrade and 1–3 at the Emirates Stadium.

In the following season, the elimination during the 2012 Europa League qualifying stage, didn&#x27;t affect the club in national championship, but after the half-season, Stanojević was released. Partizan then signed former Chelsea manager Avram Grant, who was able to preserve the lead from the half-season. He led Partizan to their fifth consecutive league title but lost three times against fierce rivals Red Star. Grant resigned and former Partizan manager Vladimir Vermezović returned to Belgrade in May 2012. Partizan did not qualify for the 2012–13 UEFA Champions League, but did gain a place in the 2012–13 UEFA Europa League group stage. Because of poor results in the second part of national championship, Vermezović was dismissed and replaced by Vuk Rašović. Following the victory in the eternal derby and in pre-last round, Rašović secured a sixth consecutive title, a total of 25th in history of the club. As a champion of the Serbian SuperLiga for 2012–13 season, Partizan managed to equalize a national record by the number of championship titles won.

In summer of 2013, Partizan eliminated Shirak (1–1, away goal) and lost against Ludogorets Razgrad (1–3 on aggregate). In play-off round for 2013–14 UEFA Europa League, Partizan played with Thun. Partizan beat Thun 1–0 in Belgrade, but lost 0–3 in Thun and failed to get in Europa League. Without a single trophy and group stage of some European competition, the season was the worst in last ten years.

After a year of absence from the European scene, Partizan entered at the 2014–15 UEFA Europa League by beating Neftchi total score 5–3 (3–2 at home and 1–2 away). Partizan is after the draw, placed in Group C with Tottenham Hotspur, Beşiktaş and Asteras Tripolis. Partizan began the Europa League in excellent form and remained undefeated against the English giant Tottenham, but in the next four games, the club were defeated. The 2014–15 season was a successful for Partizan, winning the Serbian championship and securing passage to the group stage of the Europa League.

After falling out of the play–off for the Champions League in the summer of 2015, Partizan has directly entered the 2015–16 UEFA Europa League. The club was placed in Group L alongside Athletic Bilbao, AZ Alkmaar and FC Augsburg. Partizan made three victories in group stage (3–2 at home and 2–1 in away against AZ and 3–1 in Augsburg against same team), but he failed to get in Round of 32. Partizan failed to defend the title, but won Serbian Cup after five years, without conceding goal. Partizan is first team who managed to win the Serbian Cup without conceding goal in history.

A few days after the sixth double in club history (on the 2016–17 season), coach Nikolić left the club and signed with Hungarian club Videoton. A couple days after Nikolić&#x27;s departure, Miroslav Đukić returned to Partizan. In the second qualifying round for the 2017-18 UEFA Champions League, Partizan eliminated Budućnost Podgorica (2–0 on aggregate), but in the third round they were eliminated by Olympiacos (3–5 on aggregate). In the play-off round for 2017–18 UEFA Europa League, Partizan played against Videoton and ex coach Marko Nikolić. After a 0–0 draw in Belgrade, Partizan defeated Videoton 4–0 in Felcsút and reached the group stage, where they were drawn in UEFA Europa League&#x27;s Group B alongside Dynamo Kyiv, Young Boys and Skënderbeu Korçë. Partizan drawn 1–1 with Young Boys in the first match of Group B. Partizan later played against Dynamo Kyiv; after leading 2–0 at half-time, they lost 3–2. The next two Partizan matches were against Skënderbeu Korçë; in Korçë, they drew 0–0, and then won 2–0 in Belgrade. Partizan then beat Young Boys 2–1 at home, and secured a place on the knock-out stage. In the last match of the group, Partizan lost 4–1 to Dynamo Kyiv in Kyiv, although they were already qualified. Partizan ranked second in the group with eight points (two more than Young Boys and five less than Dynamo Kyiv). In the round of 32, Partizan played against Viktoria Plzeň; in Belgrade, they took the lead, but then conceded a late goal, which came from an offside position, thus ending the match with a 1–1 draw. In Plzeň, Viktoria won 2–0, and Partizan were eliminated from UEFA Europa League at the round of 32. The result was 3–1 for Viktoria on aggregate.

At the start of 2019–20 season squad was strengthened with Israeli international Bibras Natcho, Japanese international Takuma Asano and talented Nigerian striker Umar Sadiq. In July and August 2019, Partizan secured their ninth participation in the group stage of UEFA Europa League. Under Savo Milošević&#x27;s leadership, Partizan knocked out Connah&#x27;s Quay Nomads F.C. (1–0 and 3–0), Yeni Malatyaspor (3–1 and 0–1) and Molde FK(2–1 and 1–1) in the qualifiers. On 30 August, Partizan was drawn on Group L of the 2019-20 UEFA Europa League alongside Manchester United, FC Astana and AZ Alkmaar. On 19 September, Partizan opened the group stage campaign with a 2–2 home draw against AZ. Due to UEFA sanctions, this game was played behind closed doors with only U15s allowed to attend – official attendance at the game was 22,564. Partizan beat Astana (2–1 away) on matchday 2, but lost the two following games against Manchester United (0–1 in Belgrade and 3–0 in Manchester). They still managed to draw in Alkmaar against AZ (2–2) and beat Astana 4–1 at home on the last two games of the group. However, this was not enough to get through as they finished third in the group just one point behind AZ. In the SuperLiga, Partizan won second place with 14 points less than Red Star. In the Serbian Cup, Partizan defeated Red Star in the semi-finals with a score of 1–0 after the 58-th minute goal by Bibras Natcho. In the final at the Čair Stadium in Niš, they met Vojvodina. After the regular time, it was 2–2, as Partizan equalized in the last moments of the match with a spectacular goal by Strahinja Pavlović. However, Vojvodina was better after the penalty shootout with 4–2, so after a long time, Partizan finished the season without a trophy.

=== The third decade of the 21st century ===
The third decade, a new challenge Partizan debuted in the inaugural season of the newly formed competition UEFA Europa Conference League 2021–22. In Second qualifying round Partizan knocked out DAC Dunajská Streda (1–0 and 2–0). The draw for the third qualifying round decided that Partizan would face Sochi. In the first leg played on Fisht Olympic Stadium result was 1–1, in the return leg in Belgrade the two sides once more played a draw this time it was 2–2. Because of the new rule that away goals no longer count after 
thirty minutes of extra time the match went into penalties which Partizan won 4–2. The last opponent in the qualifying Play-off round was Portuguese Santa Clara, Partizan lost 2–1 in the first game in Ponta Delgada but won 2–0 at home and thus advanced to Group stage. Partizan was placed in Group B together with Gent, Anorthosis Famagusta and Flora. The Serbian team finished second in the group with eight points and secured a place in knockout phase. After the draws in Nyon, Sparta Prague was chosen as Partizan&#x27;s next opponent, this was the first meeting between the two clubs since 1966. In the first game played on February 17, 2022, Partizan won 1–0 at Stadion Letná with a goal by Queensy Menig. Fantastic ball by Saša Zdjelar. He employed Menig, who escaped the defense and brilliantly lobbed Dominik Holec. In the second leg a week later, Partizan won 2–1 with two goals by Ricardo. And after seventeen years, Partizan reached the Round of 16 in some UEFA competition. In the round of 16, Partizan suffered a heavy defeat against Feyenoord 2–5 and 1–3, who ended up playing in the finals against Roma. In the 2021–22 Serbian SuperLiga season, Partizan finished second to Red Star after leading for most of the season. As a result, Aleksandar Stanojević resigned after two seasons without winning the domestic title.

The following 2022–23 season, Partizan finished 4th in the Serbian Superliga, which happened for the first time since 1990. As many as three coaches were changed (Ilija Stolica, Gordan Petrić, Igor Duljaj), but the results got worse and worse, until The Black &amp; Whites fell to fourth place in a series of desperate results, which started with the unexpected elimination from Sheriff Tiraspol in the knockout phase of the UEFA Europa Conference League. After the club&#x27;s worst season in the 21st century, Partizan went through a complete squad reconstruction for the 2023–24 season. The club signed eleven new players among others (Aleksandar Jovanović, Matheus Saldanha, Ghayas Zahid and Xander Severina).

== Crest and colours ==

In October 1945, Partizan adopted as their first crest a blue disc with a yellow bordered red five-pointed star in the middle, which symbolized communism, and contained the abbreviation &quot;JA&quot; (&quot;Jugoslovenska Armija&quot;, The Yugoslav Army) inside it. Later on, the central circle became white with a red five-pointed star in it. It was surrounded by a larger blue circle in which the words &quot;the Yugoslav Army&quot; were written, while both circles were bordered by a yellow circle with a green wreath over it. At the bottom of the emblem was a shield with red and white lines, and on the top were five torches, each representing one of the five nations of Yugoslavia (Serbs, Croats, Slovenes, Macedonians and Montenegrins). This was a clear reference to the National Emblem of Yugoslavia.

In the early 1950s, Partizan was separated from the Yugoslav Army and for the first time the team&#x27;s name was written in the Cyrillic and Latin alphabets. The inscription of the Yugoslav Army was removed from the crest, along with the green wreath, and was replaced by the words &quot;Sportsko Društvo&quot; (Sports association). Partizan used this emblem until 1958, although it changed its equipment colors of blue and red to black and white a year before. The crest was also changed to be completely black and white, and &quot;Sportsko Društvo&quot; was amended into &quot;Jugoslovensko Sportsko Društvo&quot; (Yugoslav Sports Association), while the five red torches and the five-pointed star remained. It was slightly redesigned after 1963 by adding a sixth torch to reflect the change of the official state emblem, which now included six torches representing six Yugoslav republics, instead of the previous five representing the nations. The crest remained unchanged until the breakup of Yugoslavia.

By 1992, with Yugoslavia fragmenting, instead of &quot;&quot;Jugoslovensko Sportsko Društvo&quot;, the word &quot;Fudbalski klub&quot;&quot; (&quot;football club&quot;) were inserted and this crest remains in use to this day. The author of the crest was academic painter Branko Šotra. In the 2007–08 season, Partizan won its 20th national championship and added two stars above their crest, symbolizing the 20 titles won. However, there is an alternative crest, which Partizan supporters call the &quot;shovel&quot; but it is never used in official matches.

For most of its history, Partizan has played in black and white striped jerseys, but during its earliest days it used entirely dark red, blue or white jerseys. In 1950, Partizan briefly had an all-white shirt with a blue diagonal stripe, besides an all blue shirt. From 1952, the first red-blue striped and quartered jerseys appeared. In 1957, the club was on tour in South America and after a friendly game with Juventus, a president of the Italian club, Umberto Agnelli, donated the club two sets of black and white jerseys. Since then, Partizan has played mainly in black and white striped shirts, with black or white shorts and socks. But there were exceptions, like in 1974, when they wore a black and white hooped shirt, and 1982, when they have played in a plain white jerseys with a thick black stripe across them. In 1990, the red and blue jersey returned after more than 30 years, in an away match against Hibernians during the UEFA Cup campaign. All this time, the away shirts have been mostly either all white or occasionally red-blue striped, but in recent years an all-black strip is usually used.

== Stadium and training ground ==
The stadium&#x27;s name is Partizan Stadium, although it was known as JNA Stadium (, (Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army Stadium) for most of its history, and even today, a lot of football fans in all countries of the former-Yugoslavia call it by its old name. Partizan supporters sometimes call it &quot;Fudbalski hram&quot; (The Temple of Football).

The stadium is situated in the Savski Venac municipality, in central Belgrade. Designed by architect Mihailo Janković, the ground was built on the site of BSK Stadium. It was officially opened on Day of Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army on 22 December 1951. The first match ever played was between Yugoslavia and France on 9 October 1949. The stadium had a capacity of 55,000 until it was renovated in 1998 following UEFA security regulations. This led to the conversion of the stadium into an all-seater reducing the capacity to 32.710, currently the second largest stadium in Serbia, behind the Red Star Stadium.

The ground has also been used for a variety of other sport events since 1949. It was used from the mid-fifties until 1987 as the final point of yearly festivities called the Youth Day. Also, it was the host of the 1962 European Athletics Championships, a place for various concerts and it hosted many times the Yugoslav Cup and Serbian Cup final.

== Partizan youth school and affiliates ==
The Partizan youth school, called &quot;Youth School Belin – Lazarević – Nadoveza&quot;, was founded in the 1950s and named after former Partizan players Bruno Belin, Čedomir Lazarević and Branko Nadoveza. The club is well known for its dedicated work with youngsters. Its training philosophy is not only the development of football players, but also to care of their growth and personality forming, while also teaching the sporting spirit. There are around 400 youngsters classified by age categories. There are six age groups, four compete at the level of the Football Association of Serbia, the U17, U16, U15 and U14, while the U13 and U12 compete at the level of the Football Association of Belgrade. Below U12 level there are no official competitions, but players do play in tournaments and friendly matches.

Partizan is the club with the most league titles and cup wins in youth competition in Serbia. The youth teams also participate in numerous tournaments around Europe and also organize an U17 international tournament with participation of some of the top European clubs. Partizan also organizes football camps for children in Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovenia, Australia and the United States. Many of the best youth-academy players move directly to the Partizan senior side, or to the affiliate club Teleoptik Zemun.

All of Partizan&#x27;s youth categories train at the Partizan sports complex named SC Partizan-Teleoptik, along with Partizan&#x27;s seniors and the players of Teleoptik.
Partizan has won several awards for its youth work, including &quot;Best European Youth Work&quot; in 2006, and the club&#x27;s youth school has been declared the second-best in Europe after that of Ajax. Partizan&#x27;s academy has produced numerous professional football players or Yugoslav and Serbian internationals. Notable players from the recent past include Saša Ilić, Savo Milošević, Danko Lazović, Stefan Babović, Miralem Sulejmani, Stevan Jovetić, Adem Ljajić, Matija Nastasić, Lazar Marković, Miloš Jojić, Andrija Živković, Nikola Milenković, Aleksandar Mitrović, Strahinja Pavlović and Dušan Vlahović.

Two Partizan youth academy graduates (Dušan Vlahović and Strahinja Pavlović) are featured in UEFA.com &#x27;Fifty for the Future&#x27; selection in 2020.

Recently, players born after year 2000 like Filip Stevanović, Marko Milovanović and Samed Baždar (who made it into the Guardian&#x27;s &#x27;Next Generation 2021&#x27; shortlist&#x27;) are showing class for their age and having great potential.

== Supporters ==

According to a 2008 domestic poll, Partizan is the second popular football club in Serbia, behind Red Star Belgrade. Although fewer, focus groups show that Partizan fans are considered to be more devoted to their club. The club has a large fanbase in Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina (especially in the Serb entity of Republika Srpska). They also have many supporters in all other former-Yugoslav republics like North Macedonia, Slovenia, and among the Serbian diaspora, especially in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Canada, Malta, the United States and Australia.

The organized supporters of Partizan are called &quot;Grobari&quot; (&quot;The Gravediggers&quot; or &quot;Undertakers&quot;), which were formed in 1970 and situated mainly on the south stand of the Partizan Stadium; therefore, they are also known as &quot;Grobari Jug&quot; (&quot;The Undertakers South&quot;). Even some ordinary Partizan fans often refer to themselves as &quot;Grobari&quot;. The nickname itself was given by their sporting rivals Delije of Red Star, referring to the club&#x27;s mostly black colours which were similar to the official uniforms of cemetery undertakers. The other theory is that the name comes from a misinterpretation of the name of the street on which Partizan&#x27;s stadium is located – &quot;&quot;Humska&quot; (&quot;humka&quot;&quot; roughly translates as &quot;grave&quot; or &quot;entombment&quot;), when actually the street was named after Serbian medieval land of Hum, nowadays part of Herzegovina and South Dalmatia. The &quot;Grobari&quot; support all clubs in the Partizan Sports Association and in the course of time they have become recognizable by their noisy and constant cheering as well as their devotion and loyalty to the club. The basis of their cheering is referred in the Serbian fan scene as the principle of &quot;srce, ruke, glas&quot; (heart, hands, voice) or &quot;glas i dlan&quot; (voice and palms), along with songs in distinctive style. The &quot;Grobari&quot; as a whole maintain a close friendship with the organized supporters of PAOK, CSKA Moscow and CSKA Sofia, which started originally because of the two supporters&#x27; common Orthodox faith and similar founding backgrounds. It has been suggested that &quot;many ultras took part in the armed conflicts and carry their scars today, translating the tribal nature of the Yugoslav wars to their clubs and ultras groups&quot;.

Grobari have also a traditional friendship with Juventude Leonina, the main ultras group of Portuguese side Sporting Clube de Portugal. The direction boards of both clubs have also good relations which was kept ever since the 1955–56 European Cup edition, which on 4 September 1955, in Lisbon&#x27;s Estádio Nacional, put head-a-head the two teams in what was considered the opening whistle of the UEFA European club competitions. The game finished with a 3–3 draw, with Sporting later losing in Belgrade in the second hand by 5–2, however the club boards of both teams regularly meet from time to time to mark the occasion of this historic event.

== Rivalries ==

Partizan&#x27;s biggest rivalry is with Red Star Belgrade. The matches between these rivals have been labeled as the Eternal derby (Serbian: Вечити дерби, Večiti derbi) or Belgrade derby. The rivalry started immediately after the creation of the two clubs. Red Star was founded for Yugoslav youth and Partizan as the football section of the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army. The rivalry is also intensified by the fact that both clubs have their stadiums situated only a few hundred metres apart. The Eternal derby is particularly noted for the passion of both supporters groups. The stands of both teams feature fireworks, coloured confetti, flags, rolls of paper, torches, smoke, drums, giant posters and choreographies, used to create visual grandeur and apply psychological pressure on the visiting teams, hence the slogan, &quot;Welcome to Hellgrade&quot;. Some fans also use trumpets, similar to the supporters in South America. This creates for the region a typical and distinctive Balkan Brass Band atmosphere. Both sets of supporters sing passionate songs against their rivals, and the stadiums are known to bounce with the simultaneous jumping of the fans.

The duel is regarded by &quot;Bleacher Report&quot; as one of the greatest football rivalries in the world. Along with the Old Firm, the Rome derby and the Istanbul derby, the Belgrade derby is known as one of the most intense rivalries in European football. The largest attendance at a derby match was about 100,000 spectators (90,142 with paid tickets) on 7 November 1976 at the Red Star Stadium. The biggest win was 7–1 for Partizan on 6 December 1953 at the Partizan Stadium but the club with the most victories is Red Star.

During the Yugoslav era between 1945 and 1991, Partizan maintained a rivalry with other members of the so called &quot;big four&quot;. Along with Partizan and Red Star, the &quot;big four&quot; included Dinamo Zagreb and Hajduk Split. Results in the table include domestic championship and cup games Partizan played against other members of the Yugoslav &quot;big four&quot; up to and including the season 1990–91:
Other rivalries include regional rivalry with Vojvodina with whom they contest the Derby of Serbia, minor derby with neighbouring Zemun, and Belgrade derbies with Rad and OFK Belgrade.

== Club records ==

Partizan&#x27;s record-holder by number of appearances is player Saša Ilić. He played 874 games in two turns, from 1996 and 2005 and from 2010 till 2019. The goal-scoring record-holder is striker Stjepan Bobek, with 425 goals. Over 150 footballers from Partizan have played for the Yugoslav and Serbian national football teams. Stjepan Bobek held the Yugoslavian national team record with 38 goals, with second place being shared by Savo Milošević, Milan Galić and Blagoje Marjanović, who scored 37 goals each. Aleksandar Mitrović holds the Serbian national team record with 59 goals as of late 2021, this means four out of five national team top goalscorers have been Partizan players.

Partizan are record-holders of the Yugoslav First League in terms of points acquired during a campaign, with 107, and are the only league-winning team to have gone undefeated during one season (in 2005 and 2010). Partizan became the first champion of Yugoslavia in 1947, the first Yugoslav Cup winner, also in 1947, and therefore also the first double winner in the country. They won three consecutive championship titles, in 1961, 1962 and 1963, the first title hat-trick in the history of the Yugoslav First League. Partizan won the most national championships since the dissolution of Yugoslavia, becoming champions 13 times. They are the only Serbian club ever, since the first nationwide domestic football competition in 1923, to win six consecutive national titles, a feat they achieved between 2007 and 2013.

The club holds records such as playing in the first European Champions Cup match in 1955, becoming the first Balkan and Eastern European club to play in the European Champions Cup final in 1966, and becoming the first club from Serbia to take part in the UEFA Champions League group stages in 2003. The club&#x27;s greatest victory in European competitions was 8–0 against Welsh champions Rhyl in qualifying for the 2009–10 UEFA Champions League.

<text>Oświęcim (; ; ) is a town in the Lesser Poland Voivodeship in southern Poland, situated southeast of Katowice, near the confluence of the Vistula (&quot;Wisła&quot;) and Soła rivers.

Oświęcim dates back to the 12th century, when it was an important castellan seat. From 1315 to 1457 it was the seat of a local line of the Piast dynasty, and from 1564 to 1772 it was a royal city of the Kingdom of Poland, with the Ducal and Royal Castle and several medieval Gothic churches among the city&#x27;s landmarks. Located on the east-west trade route, it was an important hub for trade, especially in salt from Wieliczka. In the interwar period, Oświęcim was a garrison town for the Polish Army, and during the German occupation of Poland in World War II, the former barracks were expanded to host the infamous German Nazi Auschwitz concentration camp (also known as KL or KZ Auschwitz Birkenau), now the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Oświęcim is a railroad junction, a center of chemical, electrical machinery and building materials industries, and home to Unia Oświęcim, one of the most accomplished Polish ice hockey teams.

==Name==

The name of the town is of Polish/Slavic extraction, possibly derived from the owner of a Slavic gord which existed there in the Middle Ages. Some Medieval spellings of the name are: Oswenin (1217), Osvencin (1280), Hospencin (1283), Osswetem (1290), Uspencin (1297), Oswentim (1302) etc. It has been spelled many different ways and known by many different languages over time, including Czech, German, and Latinised versions.

The town was an important center of commerce from the late Middle Ages onward. Fourteenth-century German-speaking merchants called it Auswintz; by the 15th century, this name had become Auschwitz. From 1772 to 1918 Oświęcim belonged to the Habsburg Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria (from 1804 a crownland of the Austrian Empire and 1867 Austria-Hungary), and both Polish and German names were in official use. The town was annexed into Nazi Germany during World War II and the name Auschwitz was used. It became known as Oświęcim after 27 January 1945, when the Wehrmacht was pushed out by the Red Army.

==Geography and transport==

Oświęcim lies at the intersection of National Road 44 and local roads 933 and 948. Oświęcim&#x27;s old town is east of the Soła, with the Main Market Square (&quot;Rynek Główny&quot;) at its center. The railway station is across the river in the northwest part of town; the main museum is on the west side. The Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum is in the village of Brzezinka, to the west of the railway station. The chemical works are east of the town.

The main bus station of the town lies in the east of the town, and local bus services are operated by PKS Oświęcim. The PKP railway services are available to Kraków, Katowice and Czechowice-Dziedzice, and internationally to Vienna and Prague. The nearest airport is away, at Kraków Balice. According to the 2002 data, Oświęcim is 30 km2, of which forests comprise only 1%. The neighbouring boroughs (gmina) are Chelmek, Libiąż, and the gmina of Oświęcim.

== Climate ==
Oświęcim has a warm-summer humid continental climate characterised by four distinct seasons: spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Located in the Oświęcim Basin, the town experiences relatively high precipitation that averages slightly below 1000 mm per year. The precipitation is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year, though the spring and summer seasons tend to receive more. Summers are warm and humid, but frequently cloudy due to the influence of polar maritime air masses; winters are cold and windy, with snow cover. Fog is very common throughout the year. Due to its frequency, fog is considered one of the town&#x27;s trademarks.

==History==
Oświęcim has a rich history, which dates back to the early days of Polish statehood. It is one of the oldest castellan gords in Poland. Following the Fragmentation of Poland in 1138, Duke Casimir II the Just attached the town to the Duchy of Opole in c. 1179 for his younger brother Mieszko I Tanglefoot, Duke of Opole and Racibórz. The town was destroyed in 1241 during the first Mongol invasion of Poland. Around 1272 the newly rebuilt Oświęcim was granted a municipal charter modeled on those of Lwówek Śląski (a Polish variation of the Magdeburg Law). The charter was confirmed on 3 September 1291, and Duke Mieszko of Cieszyn granted salt staple right. In 1281, the Land of Oświęcim became part of the newly established Duchy of Cieszyn, and in c. 1315, the Duchy of Oświęcim was established. In 1327, Duke Jan I the Scholastic joined his Duchy with the Duchy of Zator and, soon afterwards, his state became a vassal of the Kingdom of Bohemia, where it remained for over a century. In 1445, the Duchy was divided into three separate entities – the Duchies of Oświęcim, Zator and Toszek. In 1454, Duke Jan IV of Oświęcim pledged allegiance to Poland, thus the city returned under Polish suzerainty.

In 1457 Polish King Casimir IV Jagiellon bought the rights to Oświęcim. In 1471, Casimir IV and his son Vladislaus stayed in the city before Vladislaus set off to Prague for his coronation as King of Bohemia. Owing to Oświęcim&#x27;s location on the trade route towards Silesia and Moravia, in 1539 the townspeople were granted a royal privilege authorizing trade in salt from Wieliczka. On 25 February 1564, King Sigismund II Augustus issued a bill integrating the former Duchies of Oświęcim and Zator into the Kingdom of Poland. Both lands were attached to the Kraków Voivodeship and Lesser Poland Province, forming the Silesian County. Before 1564, Oświęcim was semi-independent in Poland and enjoyed an extensive degree of autonomy, similarly to Royal Prussia. Staple rights were granted in 1565, and confirmed in 1647 and 1667. The town later became one of the centers of Jewish culture in Poland.

Like other towns of Lesser Poland, Oświęcim prospered in the period known as Polish Golden Age. This period came to an abrupt end in 1655, during the catastrophic Swedish invasion of Poland. Oświęcim was burned and afterward, the town declined, and in 1772 (see Partitions of Poland), it was annexed by the Habsburg Empire, as part of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, where it remained until late 1918. After the 1815 Congress of Vienna, the town was close to the borders of both Russian-controlled Congress Poland, and the Kingdom of Prussia. In the 1866 war between Austria and the Prussian-led North German Confederation, a cavalry skirmish was fought at the town, in which an Austrian force defeated a Prussian incursion.
In the second half of the 19th century, Oświęcim became an important rail junction. During the same period, the town burned in several fires, such as the fire of 23 August 1863, when two-thirds of Oświęcim burned, including the town hall and two synagogues; a new town hall was built between 1872 and 1875. In another fire in 1881, the parish church, a school, and a hospital burned down. In 1910, Oświęcim became the seat of a starosta, and in 1917–18 a new district, Nowe Miasto, was founded. In 1915, a high school was opened. After World War I, the town became part of the Second Polish Republic&#x27;s Kraków Voivodeship (Województwo Krakowskie). Until 1932, Oświęcim was the seat of a county, but on 1 April 1932, the County of Oświęcim was divided between the County of Wadowice, and the County of Biała Krakowska.

===World War II===
There were approximately 8,000 Jews in the town on the eve of World War II, comprising less than half the population.
The Nazis annexed the area to Germany in October 1939 in the Gau of Upper Silesia, which became part of the &quot;second Ruhr&quot; by 1944.

In 1940, Nazi Germany used forced labor to build a new subdivision to house Auschwitz guards and staff, and built a large chemical plant of IG Farben in 1941 on the eastern outskirts of the town. Polish residents of several districts were forced to abandon their houses, as the Germans wanted to keep the area empty around Auschwitz concentration camp. They planned a buffer zone around the camp, and they expelled Polish residents in two stages in 1940 and 1941. All the residents of the Zasole district were forced to abandon their homes. In the Pławy and Harmęże districts, more than 90 percent of the buildings were destroyed and the residents of Pławy were transported to Gorlice to fend for themselves. Altogether, some 17,000 people in Oświęcim itself and surrounding villages were forced to leave their homes, eight villages were wiped off the map, and the population of Oświęcim shrank to 7,600 by April 1941.

The communist Soviet Red Army invaded the town and liberated the camp on 27 January 1945, and then opened two of their own temporary camps for German prisoners of war in the complex of Auschwitz-Birkenau. The Auschwitz Soviet camp existed until autumn 1945, and the Birkenau camp lasted until spring 1946. Some 15,000 Germans were interned there. Furthermore, there was a camp of Communist secret police (Urząd Bezpieczeństwa) near the rail station in the complex of former &quot;Gemeinschaftslager&quot;. Its prisoners were members of the NSDAP, Hitlerjugend, and BDM, as well as German civilians, the Volksdeutsche, and Upper Silesians who were disloyal to Poland.

===After World War II===
After World War II, new housing complexes in the town were developed with large buildings of rectangular and concrete constructions. The chemical industry became the main employer of the town and in later years, the service industry and trade were added. The many visits to the concentration camp memorial sites have become an important source of income for the town&#x27;s businesses.
After the end of communism, by the mid-1990s, employment at the chemical works (named &quot;Firma Chemiczna Dwory SA&quot; from 1997 to 2007, &quot;Synthos SA&quot; since then) had dropped from 10,000 in the communist era to only 1,500 people. In 1952, the County of Oświęcim was re-created, and the town until 1975 belonged to Kraków Voivodeship. In 1975–1999, it was part of Bielsko-Biała Voivodeship. In 1979, Oświęcim was visited by Pope John Paul II, and on 1 September 1980, a local Solidarity office was created at the chemical plant. On 28 May 2006, the town was visited by Pope Benedict XVI.

==Culture==
Oświęcim is culturally regarded as part of Upper Silesia. To this end, names such as &#x27;Oświęcim Silesia&#x27; () were used by Polish and German geographers, and Silesia was defined as the territory from the mouth of the river Warta to the Oder, up to Oświęcim. German nationalists of the 19th and 20th centuries argued that Oświęcim belonged to the German nation, as it is considered a part of Silesia, which led to its annexation directly into Nazi Germany instead of being included in the General Government.

Oświęcim is considered to be the eastern frontier of the Silesian language. As the easternmost point of linguistic Silesia, Silesian speech in Oświęcim is influenced by the Lesser Poland dialect and has distinct features such as partial mazuration () - there is only one nasal &#x27;a&#x27;, which loses its nasality by becoming a non-labialised &#x27;o&#x27; (rozpocoć – rozpocząć). Linguist Alexander Andrason outlines the linguistic area of Silesian borderland which Oświęcim is a part of, with features that distinguish it from other Silesian dialects as well as the Polish ones - for example, &#x27;ą&#x27; and &#x27;ę&#x27; are merged into /ɔ̃/ in Oświęcim Silesian.

==Local sports==

The sports club KS Unia Oświęcim was established in 1946. In 1999, the remaining four departments (ice hockey, swimming, figure skating, and association football) separated into their own clubs: TH Unia Oświęcim (ice hockey), UKŁF Unia Oświęcim (figure skating), UKP Unia Oświęcim (figure skating), Zasole-Unia Oświęcim (football), UKH Unia Oświęcim (youth ice hockey), and UKHK Unia Oświęcim (women&#x27;s ice hockey). In the past, Unia had boxing, table tennis, volleyball, athletics, cycling, gymnastics, chess, motorcycle racing, lawn tennis, skiing, bridge, handball, and basketball departments. The ice hockey team, TH Unia Oświęcim, was crowned Polish champions 9 times, most recently in 2024.

Another sports club with a long tradition is KS Soła Oświęcim, an association football club founded in 1919.

<text>Herbert Charles Brown (May 22, 1912 – December 19, 2004) was an American chemist and recipient of the 1979 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work with organoboranes.

==Life and career==
Brown was born Herbert Brovarnik in London, to Ukrainian Jewish immigrants from Zhitomir, Pearl (&quot;née&quot; Gorinstein) and Charles Brovarnik, a hardware store manager and carpenter. His family moved to Chicago in June 1914, when he was two years old. Brown attended Crane Junior College in Chicago, where he met Sarah Baylen, whom he would later marry. The college was under threat of closing, and Brown and Baylen transferred to Wright Junior College. In 1935 he left Wright and that autumn entered the University of Chicago, completing two years of studies in three quarters to earn a B.S. in 1936. That same year, he became a naturalized United States citizen, and began graduate studies at Chicago. On February 6, 1937, Brown married Baylen, whom he would later credit with sparking an interest in hydrides of boron that would eventually lead to the work for which he, together with Georg Wittig, would be awarded the Nobel prize in Chemistry in 1979, and the following year received his degree as Ph.D..

Unable to find a position in industry, he decided to accept a postdoctoral position, beginning his academic career. He became an instructor at Chicago in 1939, and held the position for four years before moving to Wayne University in Detroit as an assistant professor. In 1946, he was promoted to associate professor, and the following year became a professor of inorganic chemistry at Purdue University in 1947 and joined the Beta Nu chapter of Alpha Chi Sigma there in 1960. He held the position of Professor Emeritus from 1978 until his death in 2004. The &quot;Herbert C. Brown Laboratory of Chemistry&quot; was named after him on Purdue University&#x27;s campus. He was an honorary member of the International Academy of Science, Munich.

During World War II, while working with Hermann Irving Schlesinger, Brown discovered a method for producing sodium borohydride (NaBH4), which can be used to produce boranes, compounds of boron and hydrogen. His work led to the discovery of the first general method for producing asymmetric pure enantiomers. The elements found as initials of his name H, C and B were his working field.

In 1969, he was awarded the National Medal of Science.

Brown was quick to credit his wife Sarah with supporting him and allowing him to focus on creative efforts by handling finances, maintaining the house and yard, etc. According to Brown, after receiving the Nobel prize in Stockholm, he carried the medal and she carried the US$100,000 award.

In 1971, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

He was inducted into the Alpha Chi Sigma Hall of Fame in 2000.

He died December 19, 2004, at a hospital in Lafayette, Indiana after a heart attack. His wife died May 29, 2005, aged 89.

==Research==
 As a doctoral student at the University of Chicago, Herbert Brown studied the reactions of diborane, B2H6. Hermann Irving Schlesinger&#x27;s laboratory at the University of Chicago was one of two laboratories that prepared diborane. It was a rare compound that was only prepared in small quantities. Schlesinger was researching the reactions of diborane to understand why the simplest hydrogen-boron compound is B2H6 instead of BH3.

 When Brown started his own research, he observed the reactions of diborane with aldehydes, ketones, esters, and acid chlorides. He discovered that diborane reacts with aldehydes and ketones to produce dialkoxyboranes, which are hydrolyzed by water to produce alcohols. Until this point, organic chemists did not have an acceptable method of reducing carbonyls under mild conditions. Yet Brown&#x27;s Ph.D. thesis published in 1939 received little interest. Diborane was too rare to be useful as a synthetic reagent.

In 1939, Brown became the research assistant in Schlesinger&#x27;s laboratory. In 1940, they began to research volatile, low molecular weight uranium compounds for the National Defense Research Committee. Brown and Schlesinger successfully synthesized volatile uranium(IV) borohydride, which had a molecular weight of 298. The laboratory was asked to provide a large amount of the product for testing, but diborane was in short supply. They discovered that it could be formed by reacting lithium hydride with boron trifluoride in ethyl ether, allowing them to produce the chemical in larger quantities. This success was met with several new problems. Lithium hydride was also in short supply, so Brown and Schlesinger needed to find a procedure that would allow them to use sodium hydride instead. They discovered that sodium hydride and methyl borate reacted to produce sodium trimethoxyborohydride, which was viable as a substitute for the lithium hydride.

Soon they were informed that there was no longer a need for uranium borohydride, but it appeared that sodium borohydride could be useful in generating hydrogen. They began to look for a cheaper synthesis and discovered that adding methyl borate to sodium hydride at 250° produced sodium borohydride and sodium methoxide. When acetone was used in an attempt to separate the two products, it was discovered that sodium borohydride reduced the acetone.

Sodium borohydride is a mild reducing agent that works well in reducing aldehydes, ketones, and acid chlorides. Lithium aluminum hydride is a much more powerful reducing agent that can reduce almost any functional group. When Brown moved to Purdue University in 1947, he worked to find stronger borohydrides and milder aluminum hydrides that would provide a spectrum of reducing agents. The team of researchers at Purdue discovered that changing the metal ion of the borohydride to lithium, magnesium, or aluminum increases the reducing ability. They also found that introducing alkoxy substituents to the aluminum hydride decreases the reducing ability. They successfully developed a full spectrum of reducing agents.

 While researching these reducing agents, Brown&#x27;s coworker, Dr. B. C. Subba Rao, discovered an unusual reaction between sodium borohydride and ethyl oleate. The borohydride added hydrogen and boron to the carbon-carbon double bond in the ethyl oleate. The organoborane product could then be oxidized to form an alcohol. This two-step reaction is now called hydroboration-oxidation and is a reaction that converts alkenes into anti-Markovnikov alcohols. Markovnikov&#x27;s rule states that, in adding hydrogen and a halide or hydroxyl group to a carbon-carbon double bond, the hydrogen is added to the less-substituted carbon of the bond and the hydroxyl or halide group is added to the more-substituted carbon of the bond. In hydroboration-oxidation, the opposite addition occurs.

<text>There are sixteen national parks in Spain: eleven in the Iberian Peninsula, four in the Canary Islands and one in the Balearic Islands. Twelve of the seventeen autonomous communities of Spain have national parks. Canary Islands has the most with four, followed by Andalusia with three, and Castile-La Mancha and Castile and León with two each. There are five autonomous communities that have no national parks: Basque Country, La Rioja, Murcia, Navarre, Valencian Community.

 about 15 million people visited Spain&#x27;s national parks, with Teide accounting for about 28% of all visitors. The second most visited park was Picos de Europa (17%), followed by Ordesa y Monte Perdido (13%). The least visited parks were Cabrera Archipelago (0.81%) and Cabañeros (0.72%). With more than 2.5 million visitors in 2013, Teide was the most visited national park in Europe that year, and sixth most visited in the world.

<doc id="381669" wikidata="Q1184780" url="?curid=381669" title="Delta Air Lines Flight 191">
<text>Delta Air Lines Flight 191 was a regularly scheduled Delta Air Lines domestic service from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to Los Angeles, California, with an intermediate stop at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW). On August 2, 1985, the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar operating Flight 191 encountered a microburst while on approach to land at DFW. The aircraft impacted ground just over short of the runway, struck a car near the airport, collided with two water tanks and disintegrated. Out of the 163 occupants on board, 136 people died and 25 others were injured in the accident. 

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined that the crash resulted from the flight crew&#x27;s decision to fly through a thunderstorm, the lack of procedures or training to avoid or escape microbursts and the lack of hazard information on wind shear. Forecasts of microbursts improved in the following years, with USAir Flight 1016 being the only subsequent microburst-induced crash of a commercial, fixed-wing aircraft in the United States .

==Involved==
=== Aircraft ===
The accident aircraft was a Lockheed L-1011-385-1 TriStar (registration number N726DA). It was delivered to Delta Air Lines on February 28, 1979, and had operated continuously until the accident. Three Rolls-Royce RB211-22B engines powered the aircraft.

=== Crew members ===

The crew consisted of three flight crew members and eight cabin crew members. Of the 11 crew members, only 3 flight attendants survived.

In command of Flight 191 was Captain Edward Michael &quot;Ted&quot; Connors Jr., aged 57, had been a Delta employee since 1954. He qualified to captain the TriStar in 1979 and had passed his proficiency checks. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) mentioned in its final report that past flight crews who had flown with Connors described him as a meticulous pilot who strictly adhered to company policies. The report also stated that Connors &quot;deviated around thunderstorms even if other flights took more direct routes&quot; and &quot;willingly accepted suggestions from his flight crew.&quot; Since his qualification in 1979, Connors had passed all eight en route inspections that he had undergone; the NTSB report also noted that he had received &quot;favorable comments&quot; regarding &quot;cockpit discipline and standardization.&quot; Connors had logged over 29,300 hours of flight time, 3,000 of them in the TriStar. 

First Officer Rudolph Przydzial &quot;Rudy&quot; Price Jr., age 42, had been a Delta employee since 1970. Delta captains who flew with Price described him as an &quot;above average first officer&quot; who possessed &quot;excellent knowledge&quot; of the TriStar. Price had logged 6,500 flight hours, including 1,200 in the TriStar. Flight Engineer Nicholas Nestor &quot;Nick&quot; Nassick, age 43, had been a Delta employee since 1976. He had logged 6,500 hours of flight time, including 4,500 in the TriStar. Fellow Delta employees described Nassick as &quot;observant, alert, and professional.&quot;

Connors had served with the United States Navy from 1950 to 1954 and fought during two tours in the Korean War. Price had served with the United States Navy from 1964 to 1970 and fought in four tours in the Vietnam War. Nassick had served with the United States Air Force from 1963 to 1976 and had fought in four tours during the Vietnam War.

===Passengers===
Of the 152 passengers, 128 were killed by the crash. Twelve of the twenty-four survivors were seated in a cluster near the tail of the aircraft. The NTSB report lists 126 passenger fatalities rather than 128, but notes that two of the passengers listed as survivors died more than thirty days after the crash, on September 13 and October 4, 1985. Of the dead, seventy-three originated from the Miami metropolitan area; forty-five were from Broward County, nineteen were from Palm Beach County and nine were from Dade County. 

Among the deaths was Don Estridge, known to the world as the father of the IBM PC; he died aboard the flight along with his wife. Two IBM summer interns, four IBM employees from the IBM branch office in Burbank, California, and six additional family members of IBM employees also perished.

==Accident==
===History===

Flight 191 was a regularly scheduled passenger flight from Fort Lauderdale–Hollywood International Airport to Los Angeles International Airport, with a scheduled stop at Dallas–Fort Worth International Airport (DFW). The flight departed Fort Lauderdale on an instrument flight rules flight plan at 14:10 Central Daylight Time (UTC−05:00). The flight&#x27;s dispatch weather forecast for DFW stated a &quot;possibility of widely scattered rain showers and thunderstorms.&quot; Another dispatch weather alert warned of &quot;an area of isolated thunderstorms ... over Oklahoma and northern and northeastern Texas.&quot; The flight crew reviewed these notices before takeoff.

As the aircraft flew past New Orleans, Louisiana, a weather formation near the Gulf Coast strengthened. The flight crew decided to deviate from the intended route to make the more northerly Blue Ridge arrival to DFW. The flight held for ten to fifteen minutes over the Texarkana, Arkansas, VORTAC. At 17:35, the crew received an Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS) broadcast for weather on approach to DFW, and the Fort Worth Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) air traffic controller cleared the flight to the Blue Ridge, Texas, VORTAC and instructed the flight to descend to .

At 17:43:45, the Fort Worth ARTCC controller cleared the flight down to . The controller suggested they fly a heading of 250° toward the Blue Ridge approach, but Connors replied that the route would take them through a storm cell, stating, &quot;I&#x27;d rather not go through it, I&#x27;d rather go around it one way or the other.&quot; After a brief exchange, the controller gave the flight a new heading. At 17:46:50, the controller cleared the flight direct to Blue Ridge and instructed the crew to descend to . Connors expressed his relief that the controller did not send them on the original trajectory. At 17:51:19, Nassick commented, &quot;Looks like it&#x27;s raining over Fort Worth.&quot; At 17:51:42, the Fort Worth ARTCC controller transferred the flight to DFW Airport Approach Control, which cleared the flight to descend to . Two minutes later, the controller asked Flight 191 to deviate by 10° and to slow their airspeed to . The crew acknowledged the request. As the flight descended, the crew prepared the aircraft for landing. At 17:56:19, the feeder controller cleared the flight down to . Nine seconds later, the controller announced that rain was north of the airport, and that the airport would be using instrument landing system (ILS) approaches.

At 17:59:47, Price said, &quot;We&#x27;re gonna get our airplane washed.&quot; Around the same time, Connors switched to the arrival radio frequency and informed the approach controller that they were flying at . The controller replied that the flight should expect to approach Runway 17L (later named 17C). At 18:00:36, the approach controller asked an American Airlines flight that was two aircraft ahead of Flight 191, and on the same approach, if they could see the airport. The American Airlines flight responded, &quot;As soon as we break out of this rain shower, we will.&quot; At 18:00:51, Flight 191 was instructed to slow to and to turn to heading 270°. Flight 191 was instructed to descend to at 18:01:34. One minute later, the approach controller turned the flight toward Runway 17L and cleared them for an ILS approach at or above . Half a minute afterward, the controller asked the flight to reduce their speed to , which the crew acknowledged. At 18:03:30 the controller advised, &quot;And we&#x27;re getting some variable winds out there due to a shower ... out there north end of DFW.&quot; Several seconds later, an unidentified flight crew member commented, &quot;Stuff is moving in.&quot;

Just ahead of Flight 191, a Learjet 25 was on the same approach to Runway 17L. While on final approach, the Learjet flew through the storm north of the airport and encountered what was later described as &quot;light to moderate turbulence&quot;. The Learjet encountered heavy rain and lost all forward visibility, but was able to continue its ILS approach and land safely. When later asked why he did not report weather conditions to the tower, the Learjet&#x27;s captain testified that he had nothing to report because &quot;the only thing that we encountered was the heavy rain.&quot; The tower controller handling landings on Runway 17L saw lightning from the storm cell after the Learjet landed, but before he saw Flight 191 emerge from the storm.

===Crash===

At 18:03:46, the approach controller once again asked Flight 191 to reduce its speed, this time to , and then handed the flight over to the tower controller. Twelve seconds later, Connors radioed the tower and said, &quot;Tower[:] Delta one ninety one heavy, out here in the rain, feels good.&quot; The tower controller advised Flight 191 that the wind was blowing at with gusts up to , which the captain acknowledged. The flight crew lowered the landing gear and extended their flaps for landing. At 18:04:18, Price commented, &quot;Lightning coming out of that one. ... Right ahead of us.&quot; Connors called out that they were at at 18:05:05. Fourteen seconds later, he cautioned Price to watch his airspeed. At the same time, the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) captured the beginning of a sound identified as rain hitting the cockpit. Connors warned Price, &quot;You&#x27;re gonna lose it all of a sudden, there it is.&quot; At 18:05:26, Connors told Price, &quot;Push it up, push it way up.&quot; Several seconds later, the CVR recorded the sound of the engines spooling up. Connors then said, &quot;That&#x27;s it.&quot; At 18:05:36, Connors exclaimed, &quot;Hang on to the son of a bitch!&quot; From this point, the aircraft began a descent from which it never recovered. The angle of attack (AOA) was over 30° and began to vary wildly over the next few seconds. The pitch angle began to sink and the aircraft started descending below the glideslope.

At 18:05:44, with the aircraft descending at more than the ground proximity warning system (GPWS) sounded. The captain responded by declaring &quot;TOGA&quot;, aviation shorthand for the order to apply maximum thrust and abort a landing by going around. The first officer responded by pulling up and raising the nose of the aircraft, which slowed but did not stop the plane&#x27;s descent. At 18:05:52, still descending at a rate around , the aircraft&#x27;s landing gear made contact with a plowed field north of the runway and east of the runway centerline. Remaining structurally intact, Flight 191 remained on the ground while rolling at high speed across the farmland. The main landing gear left shallow depressions in the field that extended for before disappearing and reappearing a few times as the aircraft approached Texas State Highway 114.

The aircraft struck a highway street light, and its nose gear touched down on the westbound lane of Highway 114, skidding across the road at at least . The aircraft&#x27;s left engine hit a 1971 Toyota Celica driven by 28-year-old William Mayberry, killing him instantly. As the aircraft continued south, it hit two more street lights on the eastbound side of the highway and began fragmenting. The left horizontal stabilizer, some engine pieces, portions of the wing control surfaces and parts of the nose gear came off the aircraft as it continued along the ground. Some witnesses later testified that fire was emerging from the left wing root. Surviving passengers reported that fire began entering the cabin through the left wall while the plane was still moving. One survivor stated that he watched passengers attempt to escape the fire by unbuckling their seatbelts and trying to flee, but they were sucked out of the plane, while others who stayed caught on fire due to leaking jet fuel. He only survived due to being doused by rain from openings in the plane. The aircraft&#x27;s motion across open land ended when it crashed into two water tanks on the edge of the airport property; the aircraft grazed one water tank about south of Highway 114, and then struck the second one. As the left-wing and nose struck the water tank, the fuselage rotated counterclockwise and was engulfed in a fireball. The fuselage from the nose rearward to row 34 was destroyed. The tail section emerged from the fireball, skidding backward and came to rest on its left side before wind gusts rotated it upright.

==Post-crash response==

All airport fire and emergency units were alerted within one minute of the crash. Forty-five seconds after first being alerted, three fire trucks from the airport&#x27;s fire station No. 3 arrived at the crash and began fighting the fire. Additional units from fire stations No. 1 and No. 2 arrived within five minutes, and despite high wind gusts and heavy rain, the fire was mostly under control within 10 minutes after the alert was sounded.

The first paramedics arrived within five minutes of the crash and immediately established triage stations. In later testimony to NTSB officials, on-site EMTs estimated that without the on-scene triage procedures, at least half of the surviving passengers would have died. Most of the survivors of Flight 191 were located in the aircraft&#x27;s rear smoking section, which broke free from the main fuselage when the aircraft hit the water tanks. Authorities transported most of the survivors to Parkland Memorial Hospital.

The cockpit and passenger section forward of seat row 34 had been completely fragmented by impact with the water tanks and post-crash fires; all but eight of the occupants in this section were killed. The remainder of the surviving passengers and crew were in the rear cabin and tail section, which separated relatively intact and landed on its side in an open field, and most of these were in the center and right portions of the fuselage from seat row 40 rearwards. Overall, the disintegration of the Tristar was so extensive that the NTSB investigation was quite difficult. Survivors reported that fire broke out in the cabin prior to hitting the tanks and began spreading through the aircraft&#x27;s interior, which is consistent with the right wing&#x27;s collision with the light pole and fuel tank ignition. Some of the people in the tail section were unable to free themselves due to injuries, so rescue crews had to extricate them. Most survivors were also soaked with jet fuel, further adding to the difficulty of exiting the wreckage.

Two of the passengers who initially survived the crash died more than 30 days later. On the ground, an airline employee who assisted in rescuing survivors was hospitalized overnight for chest and arm pain. The crash ultimately killed 137 people, including 128 of the 152 passengers and eight of the 11 crew (including all three flight crew members), and the driver of the car.

Delta Air Lines Flight 191 has the second-highest death toll of any aviation accident involving a Lockheed L-1011 anywhere in the world, after Saudia Flight 163.

== Investigation ==
Numerous public safety agencies responded to the crash, including the Dallas/Fort Worth Airport Department of Public Safety, the Texas Department of Public Safety, the Irving Fire Department, the Irving Police Department, and all available third-watch personnel from the Dallas Police Department&#x27;s Northwest Patrol Division and the Northeastern Sector of the Fort Worth Police Department&#x27;s Patrol Division.

After a long investigation, the NTSB deemed the cause of the crash to be attributable to pilot error (for their decision to fly through a thunderstorm), combined with extreme weather phenomena associated with microburst-induced wind shear. The NTSB also determined that a lack of specific training, policies, and procedures for avoiding and escaping low-altitude wind shear was a contributing factor.

The NTSB attributed the accident to lack of the ability to detect microbursts aboard aircraft; the radar equipment aboard aircraft at the time was unable to detect wind changes, only thunderstorms. After the investigation, NASA researchers at Langley Research Center modified a Boeing 737-100 as a testbed for an onboard Doppler weather radar. The resultant airborne wind shear detection and alert system was installed on many commercial airliners in the United States after the Federal Aviation Administration mandated that all commercial aircraft must have on-board wind shear-detection systems.

The NTSB was also critical of the airport for failing to notify emergency services in surrounding municipalities in a timely manner. While the airport&#x27;s on-site emergency services were notified almost immediately, the DFW Department of Public Safety (DPS) Communications Center did not begin notifying off-site emergency services until nearly 10 minutes after the crash and did not finish its notifications until 45 minutes after the crash. During notifications, DPS also failed to request ambulances from the adjacent communities of Irving, Grapevine, and Hurst; however, Hurst responded with ambulances after personnel at its ambulance company overheard the airport crash report on a radio-frequency scanner. The NTSB concluded that the overall emergency response was effective due to the rapid response of on-airport personnel, but found &quot;several problem areas&quot; which under different circumstances &quot;could affect adversely the medical treatment and survival of accident victims at the airport&quot;.

== Legacy ==
===Reforms===
Following the crash and the ensuing NTSB report, DFW&#x27;s DPS made improvements to its postcrash notification system, including the introduction of an automated voice notification system to reduce notification times. In 1988, following the crash of Delta Air Lines Flight 1141 while taking off from DFW, DPS completed its notification of nearby emergency services in 21 minutes; the NTSB described this as a &quot;significant improvement&quot; over response times after the Delta Flight 191 crash. Based on the improved response times, the NTSB issued a Safety Recommendation on January 9, 1990, calling for airport executives nationwide to consider the benefits of using automated voice notification systems for their emergency aid notifications. Pilots were also required to train to react to microbursts and to quickly take evasive action in order to safely land the plane.

=== Trial ===
The Delta Flight 191 crash resulted in the longest aviation trial in American history, lasting 14 months from 1988 to 1989 and presided over by Federal Judge David Owen Belew Jr. of the Northern District of Texas. The trial featured the first use of computer graphic animation as substantive evidence in federal court. While the use of such animation later became routine, its use in the Flight 191 litigation was sufficiently novel that it became the cover story of the December 1989 &quot;ABA Journal&quot;, the magazine of the American Bar Association. Preparing the animated video for trial cost the Department of Justice around $100,000 to $150,000 (inflation adjusted $ to $), and required nearly two years of work. The court found that both government personnel and the Delta flight crew were negligent, but that Delta was ultimately responsible because its pilots&#x27; negligence was the proximate cause of the accident, and the ruling was upheld on appeal to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.

==Dramatization and media==
The crash was the subject of the television movie &quot;Fire and Rain&quot;.

The Discovery Channel Canada/National Geographic television series &quot;Mayday&quot; dramatized the crash of Flight 191 in a season-five episode titled &quot;Invisible Killer&quot;. The crash had previously been discussed in the &quot;Mayday&quot; season-one episode &quot;Racing the Storm&quot;, which covered the weather-related crash landing of American Airlines Flight 1420.

The crash was featured on an episode of &quot;When Weather Changed History&quot; and &quot;Why Planes Crash&quot; on The Weather Channel, and the episode &quot;Deadly Weather&quot; of &quot;Survival in the Sky&quot; on The Learning Channel.

The crash was mentioned in the feature film &quot;Rain Man&quot;.

Working as a reporter for the &quot;Fort Lauderdale News and Sun-Sentinel&quot; in 1986, future renowned crime fiction author Michael Connelly and two other reporters conducted extensive interviews of survivors of Delta Flight 191 and wrote an article detailing their experiences during and after the crash. The article explored the topic of survivor guilt and earned Connelly and his co-writers a finalist position for the Pulitzer Prize.

== Memorial ==
Ten years after the crash, survivors and family members of victims gathered in Florida to recognize the tenth anniversary of the accident. In 2010, 25 years after the accident, a memorial was installed at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport&#x27;s Founders Plaza in Grapevine.

<text>The Dong River is the eastern tributary of the Pearl River in Guangdong province, southern China. The other two main tributaries of the Pearl River are the Xi River and the Bei River. The headwater is located in Mount Sanbai () in Anyuan County, Jiangxi.

The Dong River is a major source of water for megacities in Pearl River Delta, including Hong Kong, Shenzhen, and Guangzhou. The Hong Kong Government has purchased Dong River water from Guangdong since 1965. Over 70 percent of domestic water in Hong Kong is imported from the Dong River. Its discharge totals roughly .

== Historical findings ==
A dinosaur egg fossil dated back to the Late Cretaceous was discovered by primary school student named Zhang Yangzhe while playing near the Dong River in 2019 in July. The boy&#x27;s mother, Li Xiaofang, later contacted the Heyuan Dinosaur Museum members, and under their excavation guidance more than 10 dinosaur egg fossils each about 9 centimeters in diameter and dating back to 66 million years were revealed.
