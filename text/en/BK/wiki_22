<text>Medal of Honor is a series of first-person shooter video games created by American film director and producer Steven Spielberg. The first game, &quot;Medal of Honor&quot;, was developed by DreamWorks Interactive and published by Electronic Arts for the PlayStation in 1999. It spawned a series of follow-up games including multiple expansions spanning various console platforms and PCs.

The first twelve installments take place during World War II, as does the fifteenth. The main characters are usually elite members of Office of Strategic Services (OSS), while some of the later games focus on modern warfare. The concept, story, and executive production of the first three games was made by Spielberg, who later sold the franchise for Electronic Arts in February 2000. The music in the franchise was composed by Michael Giacchino, Christopher Lennertz and Ramin Djawadi.

== Development history ==
The series began in 1999 with &quot;Medal of Honor&quot;. The game was developed by DreamWorks Interactive, when at the time the studio and series were jointly owned by DreamWorks SKG and Microsoft Games, with the game concept and story created by filmmaker Steven Spielberg. The game was released for the PlayStation on October 31, 1999. Spielberg&#x27;s inspiration for the series emerged while directing and producing the World War II film &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; to create a game that can concurrently be an educational and entertaining experience.

In 2000, &quot;Medal of Honor: Underground&quot;, the sequel, was released for the PlayStation and Game Boy Advance. &quot;Medal of Honor: Allied Assault&quot;, the third game, was developed by 2015, Inc. and released for the PC, Mac OS X and Linux in January 2002. &quot;Allied Assault&quot; has expansion packs titled &quot;Spearhead&quot; (2002) and &quot;Breakthrough&quot; (2003). Fourth entry &quot;Medal of Honor: Frontline&quot; was developed and released for the PlayStation 2 in May 2002 and the GameCube and Xbox in November 2002. It was later remastered in high-definition and released in 2010 with the PlayStation 3 version of &quot;Medal of Honor&quot; (2010), the first game in the rebooted series. &quot;Medal of Honor: Rising Sun&quot;, the fifth game, was released for PlayStation 2, Xbox and GameCube in 2003 (a planned sequel was cancelled due to the game&#x27;s mixed reviews). The sixth game, &quot;Medal of Honor: Infiltrator&quot;, was released for the Game Boy Advance in 2003. &quot;Medal of Honor: Pacific Assault&quot;, the seventh entry, was released for the PC, Mac OS X and Linux in 2004. It was followed by &quot;Medal of Honor: European Assault&quot;, the eighth game, which was released for PlayStation 2, Xbox and GameCube in 2005.
&quot;Medal of Honor: Heroes&quot;, a spin-off and the ninth game in the series, was developed and released for the PlayStation Portable in 2006. &quot;Medal of Honor: Vanguard&quot;, the tenth entry, was released for the PlayStation 2 and Wii in 2007. It was the first &quot;Medal of Honor&quot; game to be released on the Wii console. &quot;Medal of Honor: Airborne&quot;, the eleventh game in the series, was developed and released for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC September 4, 2007; it was the first game in the series to be nonlinear. Twelfth entry &quot;Medal of Honor: Heroes 2&quot; was released for the Wii and PlayStation Portable on November 13, 2007. It was a sequel of the first game in spin-off &quot;Heroes&quot; series.

The thirteenth game in the series, &quot;Medal of Honor&quot; (2010), was announced in 2008 as &quot;Medal of Honor: Operation Anaconda&quot;. The game was developed by Danger Close Games, a video game development team formerly known as EA Los Angeles merged in 2008. &quot;Medal of Honor&quot; (2010) was released for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC on October 12, 2010. Its multiplayer component was developed by the creators of the &quot;Battlefield&quot; franchise. It is the first &quot;Medal of Honor&quot; game to be set in the modern day rather than during World War II. &quot;Medal of Honor&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics and was a commercial success. &quot;Medal of Honor: Warfighter&quot;, the fourteenth installment in the series and the direct sequel to the 2010 game, was released for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC on October 23, 2012. The game&#x27;s storyline was written by real U.S. Tier 1 Operators, inspired by actual events. It is the first game in the series to run on EA Digital Illusions CE&#x27;s Frostbite 2 game engine. &quot;Warfighter&quot; was both a critical and commercial failure. In January 2013, COO Peter Moore of Electronic Arts announced that the &quot;Medal of Honor&quot; series was taken out of rotation due to the poor reception and sales of &quot;Medal of Honor: Warfighter&quot;. On September 25, 2019, Respawn Entertainment announced &quot;Medal of Honor: Above and Beyond&quot; for Oculus VR titled at the Oculus Connect 6 conference.

== Games ==

==Gameplay==

The gameplay originally focuses on the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), an American espionage organization during World War II, placing emphasis on using false papers and silenced pistols, but as the series and the technology has progressed, it has shifted emphasis towards front-line combat. Since the release of &quot;Medal of Honor: Rising Sun&quot; the series has focused on providing a more open-ended element to the games, allowing the player to have more options in each level instead of a linear path. The violence, up to &quot;Medal of Honor: Rising Sun&quot; is bloodless and simple, usually consisting of elaborate animations, while the violence in &quot;Medal of Honor: Pacific Assault&quot; and onward contains the occasional sprays of blood.

==Compilations==
*&quot;Medal of Honor: Allied Assault Deluxe Edition&quot;, released on 2003 for Windows and Macintosh includes the &quot;Medal of Honor: Allied Assault&quot; main game, the &quot;Medal of Honor: Allied Assault Spearhead&quot; expansion pack, two strategy guides, a music CD soundtrack from &quot;Medal of Honor: Allied Assault&quot; and a preview of &quot;Medal of Honor: Pacific Assault&quot;.

*&quot;Medal of Honor Collection&quot;, released on March 6, 2007, for the PlayStation 2, is a set of three games: &quot;Medal of Honor: Frontline&quot;, &quot;Medal of Honor: Rising Sun&quot; and &quot;Medal of Honor: European Assault&quot;.
*&quot;Medal of Honor 10th Anniversary Bundle&quot;, released on September 22, 2008, for PC, consists of &quot;Medal of Honor: Allied Assault&quot;, with its respective expansion packs &quot;Spearhead&quot; and &quot;Breakthrough&quot;, &quot;Medal of Honor: Pacific Assault Director&#x27;s Edition&quot;, and &quot;Medal of Honor: Airborne&quot;. The pack includes the 10th Anniversary &quot;Medal of Honor&quot; Soundtrack, by Michael Giacchino.

==Reception==


The games have received negative, mixed, and positive reviews, with the most acclaimed title in the series being &quot;Medal of Honor&quot; (1999). As of 2016, the series sold over 39 million copies, making it one of the best-selling video game franchises of all time.

==Awards==
Guinness World Records awarded the &quot;Medal of Honor&quot; series with a world record for Best-selling FPS franchise in the &quot;Guinness World Records: Gamer&#x27;s Edition 2008&quot;.

&quot;Colette&quot;, a short documentary included in the gallery mode for &quot;Medal of Honor: Above and Beyond&quot;, won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Short Subject at the 93rd Academy Awards. Though not mentioned by name in the Academy citation, &quot;Medal of Honor&quot; is arguably the first video game series ever to receive an Oscar for its content.

<doc id="378184" wikidata="Q731220" url="?curid=378184" title="Banyan VINES">
<text>Banyan VINES is a discontinued network operating system developed by Banyan Systems for computers running AT&amp;T&#x27;s UNIX System V.

&quot;VINES&quot; is an acronym for &quot;Virtual Integrated NEtwork Service&quot;. Like Novell NetWare, VINES&#x27;s network services are based on the Xerox XNS stack.

James Allchin, who later worked as Group Vice President for Platforms at Microsoft until his retirement on January 30, 2007, was the chief architect of Banyan VINES.
== VINES technology ==
VINES ran on a low-level protocol known as &quot;VIP&quot;—the &quot;VINES Internetwork Protocol&quot;—that was essentially identical to the lower layers of the Xerox Network Systems (XNS) protocols. Addresses consist of a 32-bit address and a 16-bit subnet that map to the 48-bit Ethernet address to route to machines. This means that, like other XNS-based systems, VINES can only support a two-level internet.

A set of routing algorithms, however, set VINES apart from other XNS systems at this level. The key differentiator, &quot;ARP&quot; (&quot;Address Resolution Protocol&quot;), allowed VINES clients to automatically set up their own network addresses. When a client first boots up, it broadcast a request on the subnet asking for servers, which responds with suggested addresses. The client used the first to respond, although the servers could hand off &quot;better&quot; routing instructions to the client if the network changed. The overall concept resembled AppleTalk&#x27;s AARP system, with the exception that VINES required at least one server, whereas AARP functioned as peer-to-peer. Like AARP, VINES required an inherently &quot;chatty&quot; network, sending updates about the status of clients to other servers on the internetwork.

Rounding out its lower-level system, VINES used &quot;RTP&quot; (the &quot;Routing Table Protocol&quot;), a low-overhead message system for passing around information about changes to the routing, and ARP to determine the address of other nodes on the system. These closely resembled the similar systems used in other XNS-based protocols. VINES also included &quot;ICP&quot; (the &quot;Internet Control Protocol&quot;), which it used to pass error-messages and metrics.

At the middle layer level, VINES used fairly standard software. The &quot;unreliable datagram service&quot; and &quot;data-stream service&quot; operated essentially identically to UDP and TCP on top of IP. VINES added a &quot;reliable message service&quot; as well, a hybrid of the two that offered guaranteed delivery of single packets.

Banyan offered customers TCP/IP as an extra cost option for owners of standard Vines servers. This extra charge for TCP/IP on VINES servers continued long after TCP/IP server availability had become commoditized.

At the topmost layer, VINES provided the standard file and print services, as well as the unique &quot;StreetTalk&quot;, a globally consistent name service. Banyan has a version of StreetTalk that ran natively on a Windows NT server. Using a globally distributed, partially replicated database, StreetTalk could meld multiple widely separated networks into a single network that allowed seamless resource-sharing. It accomplished this through its rigidly hierarchical naming-scheme; entries in the directory took the form &quot;item&quot;@&quot;group&quot;@&quot;organization&quot; (similar to the naming format used in the XNS Clearinghouse directory service: &quot;item&quot;:&quot;group&quot;:&quot;organization&quot;). This applied to user accounts as well as to resources like printers and file servers.

== Protocol stack ==
== VINES client software ==
VINES client software ran on most earlier PC-based operating systems, including MS-DOS and earlier versions of Microsoft Windows. It was lightweight on the client, and hence remained in use during the latter half of the 1990s on many older machines that could not run other networking stacks. This occurred on the server side as well, as VINES generally offered good performance, even from mediocre hardware.

== Initial market release ==
With StreetTalk&#x27;s inherent low bandwidth requirements, global companies and governments that grasped the advantages of worldwide directory services seamlessly spanning multiple time zones recognized VINE&#x27;s technological edge. Users included gas and oil companies, power companies, public utilities—and U.S. Government agencies including the State Department, Treasury Department, Department of Agriculture, Department of Health and Human Services, and Department of Defense.

The U.S. State Department was an early adopter of the VINES technology. Able to take advantage of the then high-speed 56k modems for telephonic connectivity of the developed world to the limited telephone modem speeds of 300 baud over bad analog telephone systems in developing countries, VINES linked embassies around the world. VINES also features built-in point-to-point and group chat capability that was useful for basic communication over secure lines.

== Defense Department adoption ==
By the late 1980s, the US Marine Corps was searching for simple, off-the-shelf worldwide network connectivity with rich built-in email, file, and print features. By 1988, the Marine Corps had standardized on VINES as both its garrison (base) and forward-deployed ground-based battlefield email-centric network operating system.

Using both ground-based secure radio channels and satellite and military tactical phone switches, the Marine Corps was ready for its first big test of VINES: the 1990-1991 Gulf War. Units were able to seamlessly coordinate ground, naval, and air strikes across military boundaries by using the chat function to pass target lists and adjust naval gun fire on the fly. Ground fire support coordination agencies used VINES up and down command channels—from Battalion-to-Regiment through Division-to-Corps and Squadron-to-Group to Aircraft Wing-to-Corps, as well as in peer-to-peer unit communication. 

== VINES competitors ==

3Com&#x27;s journey into network operating system development began in the late 1970s. In 1979, they introduced their first network operating system, called 3+Share. It allowed multiple users to access files and resources on a shared server. However, it wasn&#x27;t until 1982 that 3Com released 3Server, which was a significant step forward.

3Server was designed to work with 3Com&#x27;s Ethernet hardware and was aimed at creating local area networks (LANs). It provided file and print sharing capabilities, enabling multiple computers to access common resources like printers and files. It operated on the XNS (Xerox Network Systems) protocol suite.

Over the years, 3Com continued to refine and improve its network operating systems. In 1985, they introduced 3+Open, which added support for third-party hardware. 3+Open was a significant advancement in 3Com&#x27;s network operating system lineup. Introduced in 1985, it expanded on the capabilities of their previous offerings by providing support for third-party hardware and software. This allowed 3+Open to work with a wider range of network devices and systems, increasing its compatibility and appeal to a broader audience.

3Com&#x27;s contribution to Microsoft&#x27;s network and server software capabilities is closely tied to their collaboration on the development of LAN Manager. LAN Manager was Microsoft&#x27;s networking software that aimed to provide file and print services for PCs connected in a network. In the late 1980s, Microsoft partnered with 3Com to integrate 3+Open&#x27;s networking capabilities into LAN Manager.

This collaboration led to the creation of LAN Manager 2.0, which was released in 1989. This version of LAN Manager incorporated technologies from both Microsoft and 3Com, resulting in improved networking capabilities and compatibility. It enabled Microsoft to strengthen its networking offerings, making it a more competitive player in the network operating system space.

Microsoft&#x27;s experience with LAN Manager laid the foundation for their subsequent development of Windows NT and Windows Server operating systems. The knowledge and technologies gained from working with 3Com&#x27;s networking solutions contributed to the evolution of Microsoft&#x27;s network and server software capabilities, helping them become a dominant force in the networking and server industry.

For a decade, Banyan&#x27;s OS competitors, Novell and Microsoft, dismissed the utility of directory services. Consequently, VINES dominated what came to be called the &quot;directory services&quot; space from 1985 to 1995. While seeming to ignore VINES, Novell and eventually Microsoft—companies with a flat server or domain-based network model—came to realize the strategic value of directory services. With little warning, Novell went from playing down the value of directory services to announcing its own: NetWare Directory Services (NDS). Eventually, Novell changed &quot;NDS&quot; to mean Novell Directory Services, and then renamed that to eDirectory.

For Windows 2000 however, Microsoft included Active Directory, an LDAP directory service based on the directory from its Exchange mail server. While VINES is limited to a three-part name, user.company.org, like Novell&#x27;s NDS structure, Active Directory is not bound by such a naming convention. Active Directory features an additional capability that both NDS and VINES lack, its &quot;forest and trees&quot; organizational model. The combination of better architecture and with marketing from a company the size of Microsoft doomed StreetTalk, VINES as an OS, and finally Banyan itself.

== Decline ==
By the late 1990s, VINES&#x27;s once-touted StreetTalk Services&#x27;s non-flat, non-domain model had lost ground to newer technology, despite its built-in messaging, efficiency and onetime performance edge. Banyan was unable to market its product far beyond its initial base of multi-national and government entities.

The company lost ground in the networking market, and VINES sales dropped. Banyan increasingly turned to StreetTalk as a differentiator, eventually porting it to NT as a stand-alone product and offering it as an interface to LDAP systems. 

Banyan continued to operate a closed OS. This required hardware manufacturers to submit hardware and driver requirements so that Banyan could write drivers for each peripheral. When more open systems with published APIs began to appear, Banyan did not alter their model. This made it difficult for client-side support to handle the explosive growth in, for example, printers. As competitors began to adopt some of VINES&#x27;s wide area networking protocols and services, manufacturers were less inclined to send a unit to Banyan for VINES specific drivers when competitors allowed them to write their own.

Dropping the Banyan brand for &quot;ePresence&quot; in 1999, as a general Internet services company, the firm sold its services division to Unisys in late 2003 and liquidated its remaining holdings in its Switchboard.com subsidiary.

<text>72 (seventy-two) is the natural number following 71 and preceding 73. It is half a gross or six dozen (i.e., 60 in duodecimal).

==In mathematics==
Seventy-two is a pronic number, as it is the product of 8 and 9. It is the smallest Achilles number, as it&#x27;s a powerful number that is not itself a power.

72 is an abundant number. With exactly twelve positive divisors, including 12 (one of only two sublime numbers), 72 is also the twelfth member in the sequence of refactorable numbers. As no smaller number has more than 12 divisors, 72 is a largely composite number. 72 has an Euler totient of 24. It is a highly totient number, as there are 17 solutions to the equation φ(&quot;x&quot;) = 72, more than any integer under 72. It is equal to the sum of its preceding smaller highly totient numbers 24 and 48, and contains the first six highly totient numbers 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 as a subset of its proper divisors. 144, or twice 72, is also highly totient, as is 576, the square of 24. While 17 different integers have a totient value of 72, the sum of Euler&#x27;s totient function φ(&quot;x&quot;) over the first 15 integers is 72. It also is a &quot;perfect&quot; indexed Harshad number in decimal (twenty-eighth), as it is divisible by the sum of its digits (9).

72 plays a role in the Rule of 72 in economics when approximating annual compounding of interest rates of a round 6% to 10%, due in part to its high number of divisors.

Inside formula_1 Lie algebras:

* 72 is the number of vertices of the six-dimensional 122 polytope, which also contains as facets 720 edges, 702 polychoral 4-faces, of which 270 are four-dimensional 16-cells, and two sets of 27 demipenteract &quot;5&quot;-faces. These 72 vertices are the &quot;root vectors&quot; of the simple Lie group formula_2, which as a honeycomb under 222 forms the formula_2 lattice. 122 is part of a family of k22 polytopes whose first member is the fourth-dimensional 3-3 duoprism, of symmetry order 72 and made of six triangular prisms. On the other hand, 321 ∈ k21 is the only semiregular polytope in the seventh dimension, also featuring a total of 702 &quot;6&quot;-faces of which 576 are 6-simplexes and 126 are 6-orthoplexes that contain 60 edges and 12 vertices, or collectively 72 one-dimensional and two-dimensional elements; with 126 the number of &quot;root vectors&quot; in formula_4, which are contained in the vertices of 231 ∈ k31, also with 576 or 242 6-simplexes like 321. The triangular prism is the root polytope in the k21 family of polytopes, which is the simplest semiregular polytope, with k31 rooted in the analogous four-dimensional tetrahedral prism that has four triangular prisms alongside two tetrahedra as cells.
*The complex Hessian polyhedron in formula_5 contains 72 regular complex triangular edges, as well as 27 polygonal Möbius–Kantor faces and 27 vertices. It is notable for being the vertex figure of the complex Witting polytope, which shares 240 vertices with the eight-dimensional semiregular 421 polytope whose vertices in turn represent the &quot;root vectors&quot; of the simple Lie group formula_6.

There are 72 compact and paracompact Coxeter groups of ranks four through ten: 14 of these are compact finite representations in only three-dimensional and four-dimensional spaces, with the remaining 58 paracompact or noncompact &quot;infinite&quot; representations in dimensions three through nine. These terminate with three paracompact groups in the ninth dimension, of which the most important is formula_7: it contains the final semiregular hyperbolic honeycomb 621 made of only regular facets and the 521 Euclidean honeycomb as its vertex figure, which is the geometric representation of the formula_6 lattice. Furthermore, formula_7 shares the same fundamental symmetries with the Coxeter-Dynkin over-extended form formula_6++ equivalent to the tenth-dimensional symmetries of Lie algebra formula_11.

72 lies between the 8th pair of twin primes (71, 73), where 71 is the largest supersingular prime that is a factor of the largest sporadic group (the friendly giant formula_12), and 73 the largest indexed member of a definite quadratic integer matrix representative of all prime numbers that is also the number of distinct orders (without multiplicity) inside all 194 conjugacy classes of formula_12. Sporadic groups are a family of twenty-six finite simple groups, where formula_2, formula_4, and formula_6 are associated exceptional groups that are part of sixteen finite Lie groups that are also simple, or non-trivial groups whose only normal subgroups are the trivial group and the groups themselves.

==In religion==
*In Islam 72 is the number of beautiful wives that are promised to martyrs in paradise, according to &quot;Hadith&quot; (sayings of Muhammad).

==In other fields==
Seventy-two is also:
*In typography, a point is 1/72 inch.
*The Rule of 72 in finance.
*72 equal temperament is a tuning used in Byzantine music and by some modern composers.
*The number of micro seasons in the traditional Japanese calendar

<text>Dong Zhuo () (c. 140s – 22 May 192), courtesy name Zhongying, was a Chinese military general, politician, and warlord who lived in the late Eastern Han dynasty. At the end of the reign of the Eastern Han, Dong Zhuo was a general and powerful minister of the imperial government. Originally from Liang Province, Dong Zhuo seized control of the imperial capital Luoyang in 189 when it entered a state of turmoil following the death of Emperor Ling of Han and a massacre of the eunuch faction by the court officials led by General-in-Chief He Jin.

Dong Zhuo subsequently deposed Liu Bian (Emperor Shao) and replaced him with his half-brother, the puppet Emperor Xian to make him become the de facto ruler of China in the boy-emperor&#x27;s name. The Eastern Han dynasty regime survived in name only. Dong Zhuo&#x27;s rule was brief and characterized by cruelty and tyranny. In the following year, a coalition of regional officials (; &quot;cishi&quot;) and warlords launched a campaign against him. Failing to stop the coalition forces, Dong Zhuo sacked Luoyang and relocated further west to the former Western Han capital at Chang&#x27;an (modern Xi&#x27;an, Shaanxi province). He was assassinated soon after in May 192 by his subordinate Lü Bu in a plot orchestrated by Interior Minister Wang Yun.

==Early life==
Dong Zhuo was born in Lintao, Longxi Commandery in the early 140s and was said to be a chivalrous youth who was physically strong and excelled in horseback archery. He travelled around the Qiang and Xiongnu regions and befriended many people.

Around 165, Dong Zhuo became a member of the Yulin corps (, branch of the Imperial Guard) in the capital. Dong served under Zhang Huan&#x27;s () northern campaign to suppress an uprising of the Qiang. He eventually became a county magistrate in the Yanmen Commandery, a divisional commandant in the Shu Commandery, the Wu and Ji colonel in the Western Regions, inspector of Bing Province, and administrator of the Hedong Commandery.

At some point in the 170s, he was employed as a minor official in an unnamed commandery, supervising captured thieves and robbers. Due to the many raids by non-Han minorities, the then-Inspector of Liangzhou, Cheng Jiu (成就), promoted Dong to serve under him. Under Cheng, Dong led troops to repel these raids and achieved much success. As such, the then-Inspector of Bingzhou, Duan Jiong (段颎), recommended Dong to the Three Excellencies of the time; then-&quot;Situ&quot; Yuan Wei (袁隗) hired Dong to serve under him.

By the late 170s, Dong Zhuo was Administrator of Hedong Commandery.

At the outbreak of the Yellow Turban Rebellion in the summer of 184, Dong Zhuo was sent to take over command from Lu Zhi in preparation of the offense on Zhang Jue in Julu. Although his efforts during the rebellion were initially unsuccessful, with the arrival of Huangfu Song, victory was achieved in the winter against the peasants.

During the Liang Province Rebellion, the barbarians rebelled with local gentries Han Sui and Bian Zhang. Dong was reinstated and sent to suppress the rebels. While suppressing this rebellion, Dong Zhuo had several tactical and strategic disagreements with Huangfu Song; after Huangfu managed to achieve victory despite Dong&#x27;s disagreements, Dong became resentful and fearful of him.

Dong Zhuo was given the title &quot;General Who Smashes the Caitiffs&quot; in 185, and &quot;General of the Vanguard&quot; in 188. He was promoted to be the governor of Bing Province, but he refused to take up his new post as he was unwilling to leave his men.

During the turbulent situation, the power of the Eastern Han dynasty was waning. Dong Zhuo then settled in Liang Province and built up his power.

==Rise to power==
Following the death of Emperor Ling of Han in May 189, General-in-Chief He Jin ordered Dong Zhuo to lead troops into Luoyang to aid him in eliminating the powerful eunuch faction known as the Ten Attendants. Before Dong could arrive, He Jin was assassinated by the eunuchs in September that year and the capital city fell into a state of turmoil. The eunuchs took Liu Bian (Emperor Shao) hostage and fled from Luoyang. Dong Zhuo&#x27;s army intercepted the eunuchs and brought the emperor back to the palace.

After He Jin&#x27;s death, He Jin&#x27;s step-brother, General of Chariots and Cavalry He Miao (), was killed by He Jin&#x27;s subordinate Wu Kuang (吳匡) and Dong Zhuo&#x27;s brother Dong Min, for sympathizing with the eunuch faction which had assassinated He Jin.

After arriving in Luoyang, Dong Zhuo realized that his 3000 men were unequal to the numerous troops guarding the capital. Dong ordered some of his army to march out at night and re-enter the city at dawn, thus making it appear that he was receiving reinforcements. Dong then took command of the leaderless forces of He Jin and He Miao, convinced Lü Bu to join his ranks, and made himself Excellency of Works.

In 189, Dong deposed Emperor Shao and replaced him with Liu Xie (Emperor Xian). Dong declared himself chancellor, and became the head of the imperial court in Luoyang. However, in the words of Rafe de Crespigny, Dong Zhuo&#x27;s &quot;conduct towards the court and the imperial officials was bullying, oppressive and frequently bloody.&quot; This prompted Yuan Shao to form a coalition army with other regional officials in opposition to Dong Zhuo&#x27;s military authority.

==Coalition against Dong Zhuo==
===Dong Zhuo retreats to Chang&#x27;an===

In the same year, regional officials and warlords around the country formed a coalition force and launched a punitive campaign against Dong Zhuo. In response, he sent a detachment to intercept the coalition vanguard led by Sun Jian, and ordered his son-in-law, Niu Fu, to supply his fortress and manor of Mei, also known as &quot;Meiwu&quot; (郿坞) or &quot;Ten-Thousand Year Fortress&quot; (万岁坞), with 30 years&#x27; worth of rations, where he had planned to centralize his power or retire in safety behind its fortified walls built to be seven &quot;zhàng&quot; in height and thickness. After his subordinates Hua Xiong, Hu Zhen, and Lu Bu were defeated by Sun Jian at Yangren, Dong Zhuo sent Li Jue to propose a marriage between Sun&#x27;s son and Dong&#x27;s daughter, and split the empire between the two families. Sun Jian refused and prepared to attack Luoyang.

Dong evacuated everyone in Luoyang and moved them to Chang&#x27;an in the west. Before the relocation, Dong ordered his troops to ransack the tombs of the late Han emperors for treasures, seize valuables from the wealthy residents in Luoyang, and burn down the palaces and anything that might be useful to the coalition.

Then the chancellor assembled his forces in the city and personally led them to ambush the approaching army. Dong&#x27;s ambush failed and he was driven back by Sun Jian. He ordered Lu Bu to lead a cavalry force back to the city to halt Sun&#x27;s progress before he took flight for Mianchi. Sun Jian broke through one of the eastern gates and defeated Lu Bu, taking the city.

===Defeat of the coalition===
Despite taking Luoyang, the city was so heavily damaged that Sun Jian chose to retreat rather than to try to hold it.

Dong Zhuo then sent his generals Li Jue, Guo Si, and Zhang Ji to the frontline against the eastern warlords. By this time the coalition had already fallen into disarray and internal bickering. The only ones who actively opposed Dong were the senior imperial officer, Zhu Jun and his old friend, Tao Qian. Tao, despite having a general alliance with Dong, sent 3,000 elite troops from Danyang to aid Zhu in the battle with Dong&#x27;s forces at Zhongmu. Zhu was defeated. Li Jue and his comrades then raided the surrounding area around Chenliu and Yingchuan for slaves. Morale among the allied soldiers were low due to news of the ways in which Dong Zhuo would torture captives. Apparently he would have them tied up with fat-soaked clothes and start a fire from their foot. He left their heads unbound so he could enjoy their screams and watch their expressions while being tortured.

==Rule of terror==

Two months after he moved the capital, Dong Zhuo revived the title of Grand Master, an antiquated title once reinvigorated by Wang Mang, but scrapped in the Eastern Han. He appointed his younger brother Dong Min as General of the Left and gave official posts to several of his kin.

Dong Zhuo threw lavish banquets during which he would torture captured enemies by severing limbs, removing tongues and eyeballs, or burning them alive. His audience was said to have experienced a high degree of discomfort.

For Yuan Shao&#x27;s role as leader of the coalition against him, Dong Zhuo had the entire Yuan clan in Luoyang wiped out. Within two years, thousands of public servants were wrongly accused and executed, and numerous commoners were kidnapped or killed. In order to purchase materials for further development of the Mei citadel, he had bells and bronze statues, among which were nine of the Twelve Metal Colossi, melted and recast into coins. However, the coins did not weigh the same, resulting in all copper cash being devalued.

==Downfall and death==
Dong Zhuo kept Lü Bu as a personal bodyguard and swore an oath as father and son. However, after an argument, Dong threw a hand-axe at Lü Bu, who dodged the weapon. Lü Bu&#x27;s relationship with Dong Zhuo further deteriorated when Lü had an affair with a woman in Dong&#x27;s harem.

In 192, with encouragement from Interior Minister Wang Yun, Lü Bu made his decision to kill Dong Zhuo. On the morning of May 22, 192, Lü greeted Dong at the palace gate with a dozen trusted men led by Cavalry Captain Li Su, who had pretended to stand guard at the gate alongside Wang Yun. Li stepped forward and tried to stab Dong with a &quot;ji&quot;, but Dong&#x27;s body armour saved him. Dong cried out for Lü Bu to save him, but Lü merely answered, &quot;This is an imperial order,&quot; after which he delivered a fatal blow to Dong. 

It was recorded that Dong&#x27;s corpse was left on the streets with a lit wick placed on his navel. The wick burned for several days on the fat of the corpse. It was said that the light from the flame could last for days. A special order stated that anyone who went forth to collect the body would be killed. However, three officials, including Cai Yong, still challenged the order and were executed. Meanwhile, all affiliates of the Dong clan, including Dong&#x27;s 90-year-old mother, were put to death.

==Legacy==
After Dong Zhuo&#x27;s death, several of his loyalists, such as Li Jue, Guo Si, Zhang Ji and Fan Chou, escaped on the belief that their allegiance to him would be considered treason. Wang Yun, who had taken control of the government, heard their appeal for pardon and said, &quot;Of all those who should be forgiven, they are the exceptions.&quot; The four then planned to relinquish their positions and go into hiding. However, an advisor named Jia Xu suggested they should take this opportunity to launch a strike at Chang&#x27;an since the Liang faction was practically unscathed. The four then roused several-thousand core followers to attack Chang&#x27;an. Wang sent Xu Rong and Hu Zhen (former members of the Liang faction) to fight the Liang force en route, but Xu was killed in the first encounter and Hu joined the rebels, inflating the size of their army to 100,000 when they surrounded the capital. Lü Bu attempted to break the siege, but was defeated outside the city gate, and thus Chang&#x27;an fell into the hands of Dong Zhuo&#x27;s followers. Emperor Xian was taken hostage and power in the court fell into the hands of the Liang faction once again.

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==
&quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, a 14th-century historical novel by Luo Guanzhong, was a romanticization of the events that occurred before and during the Three Kingdoms era. Because the real-life Dong Zhuo was already much of a cruel and treacherous character, the novel probably could do little more to accentuate that treachery and cruelty. It did, however, on two occasions deviate from the history.

===Dong Zhuo and the three sworn brothers===
Dong Zhuo first appeared as early as late in Chapter 1. Being sent to quell the Yellow Turban Rebellion, Dong Zhuo was defeated by the rebel leader Zhang Jiao and the battle was turning into a rout.

The three newly sworn brothers, Liu Bei, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei, happened to be nearby. They then led their forces out to Dong Zhuo&#x27;s rescue. Suddenly met with this new opposition, the rebels were swept off their feet and had to retreat.

After returning to camp, Dong Zhuo asked the three brothers what offices they currently held. And they replied that they held none. Dong Zhuo harrumphed and then ignored them. This angered Zhang Fei so much that he grabbed his sword and wanted to kill Dong Zhuo. He was however stopped by his two brothers, who suggested taking their service elsewhere. Thus was Dong Zhuo&#x27;s life spared and the three brothers went their own way.

===Dong Zhuo and Diaochan===

Perhaps the most popular story about Dong Zhuo was the fictional love triangle involving Dong Zhuo, Lü Bu and Diaochan, which eventually led to the death of Dong Zhuo at the hands of his own adoptive son, Lü Bu.

After Dong Zhuo moved the capital to the more strategically sound Chang&#x27;an, Interior Minister Wang Yun started to contemplate a plot to assassinate the tyrant by using the petite Diaochan, a young singer who was brought up in his household but whom he had been treating like his own daughter, to plant the seed of dissension between Dong Zhuo and Lü Bu.

Inviting Lü Bu over one night, Wang Yun asked Diaochan to serve wine to the guest. Lü Bu was immediately seized by the girl&#x27;s beauty. Well aware of this, Wang Yun then promised to marry Diaochan to the mighty warrior.

A few days later, however, Wang Yun laid a feast for Dong Zhuo and repeated the feat. Like Lü Bu, Dong Zhuo could not lift his eyes off Diaochan, who also displayed her prowess in song and dance. Dong Zhuo then brought Diaochan home and made her his concubine.

When Lü Bu heard about this early the next morning, he headed for Dong Zhuo&#x27;s bedroom and peeped in through the window. There he saw Diaochan sitting up grooming her hair while Dong Zhuo was still asleep. Aware of Lü Bu&#x27;s presence, Diaochan put up a sorrowful expression and pretended to wipe tears off her eyes with a handkerchief.

A similar incident recurred about a month later, but this time Dong Zhuo woke up in time to see Lü Bu staring fixedly at Diaochan. Lü Bu was then thrown out and forbidden from entering the house.

Then one day, while Dong Zhuo was holding a conversation with Emperor Xian, Lü Bu sneaked to his foster father&#x27;s residence and met with Diaochan in the Fengyi Pavilion (). Weeping, Diaochan pleaded with Lü Bu to rescue her from Dong Zhuo. Placing his halberd aside, Lü Bu held Diaochan in his arms and comforted her with words.

Right then, Dong Zhuo returned to find the duo in the pavilion. The startled Lü Bu turned to flee. Dong Zhuo grabbed the halberd and gave chase. Being too slow, Dong Zhuo could not catch up with the agile Lü Bu. He then hurled the halberd at Lü Bu but the latter fended it off and got away.

After the incident, Lü Bu became increasingly displeased with Dong Zhuo. The displeasure was further inflamed by Wang Yun, who suggested subtly that Lü Bu kill Dong Zhuo. Lü Bu was eventually persuaded.

The conspirators sent Li Su to fetch Dong Zhuo from his castle in Meiwu () under the pretense that the emperor intended to abdicate the throne to the warlord. The overjoyed Dong Zhuo then came to the palace gate, where his troops were barred from entering. As Dong Zhuo&#x27;s carriage neared the palace building, soldiers loyal to Wang Yun escorted Dong Zhuo to the trap they set. Then suddenly a general stabbed Dong Zhuo.

Injured only in the arms, Dong Zhuo then cried out for Lü Bu to save him. Lü Bu walked over and impaled Dong Zhuo&#x27;s throat with his halberd, proclaiming, &quot;I have an imperial decree to slay the rebel!&quot;

<text>A coprocessor is a computer processor used to supplement the functions of the primary processor (the CPU). Operations performed by the coprocessor may be floating-point arithmetic, graphics, signal processing, string processing, cryptography or I/O interfacing with peripheral devices. By offloading processor-intensive tasks from the main processor, coprocessors can accelerate system performance. Coprocessors allow a line of computers to be customized, so that customers who do not need the extra performance do not need to pay for it.

==Functionality==
Coprocessors vary in their degree of autonomy. Some (such as FPUs) rely on direct control via coprocessor instructions, embedded in the CPU&#x27;s instruction stream. Others are independent processors in their own right, capable of working asynchronously; they are still not optimized for general-purpose code, or they are incapable of it due to a limited instruction set focused on accelerating specific tasks. It is common for these to be driven by direct memory access (DMA), with the host processor (a CPU) building a command list. The PlayStation 2&#x27;s Emotion Engine contained an unusual DSP-like SIMD vector unit capable of both modes of operation.

==History==
To make the best use of mainframe computer processor time, input/output tasks were delegated to separate systems called Channel I/O. The mainframe would not require any I/O processing at all, instead would just set parameters for an input or output operation and then signal the channel processor to carry out the whole of the operation. By dedicating relatively simple sub-processors to handle time-consuming I/O formatting and processing, overall system performance was improved.

Coprocessors for floating-point arithmetic first appeared in desktop computers in the 1970s and became common throughout the 1980s and into the early 1990s. Early 8-bit and 16-bit processors used software to carry out floating-point arithmetic operations. Where a coprocessor was supported, floating-point calculations could be carried out many times faster. Math coprocessors were popular purchases for users of computer-aided design (CAD) software and scientific and engineering calculations. Some floating-point units, such as the AMD 9511, Intel 8231/8232 and Weitek FPUs were treated as peripheral devices, while others such as the Intel 8087, Motorola 68881 and National 32081 were more closely integrated with the CPU.

Another form of coprocessor was a video display coprocessor, as used in the Atari 8-bit computers, TI-99/4A, and MSX home computers, which were called &quot;Video Display Controllers&quot;. The Amiga custom chipset includes such a unit known as the Copper, as well as a blitter for accelerating bitmap manipulation in memory.

As microprocessors developed, the cost of integrating the floating-point arithmetic functions into the processor declined. High processor speeds also made a closely integrated coprocessor difficult to implement. Separately packaged mathematics coprocessors are now uncommon in desktop computers. The demand for a dedicated graphics coprocessor has grown, however, particularly due to the increasing demand for realistic 3D graphics in computer games.

== Intel ==

The original IBM PC included a socket for the Intel 8087 floating-point coprocessor (aka FPU) which was a popular option for people using the PC for computer-aided design or mathematics-intensive calculations. In that architecture, the coprocessor speeds up floating-point arithmetic on the order of fiftyfold. Users that only used the PC for word processing, for example, saved the high cost of the coprocessor, which would not have accelerated performance of text manipulation operations.

The 8087 was tightly integrated with the 8086/8088 and responded to floating-point machine code operation codes inserted in the 8088 instruction stream. An 8088 processor without an 8087 could not interpret these instructions, requiring separate versions of programs for FPU and non-FPU systems, or at least a test at run time to detect the FPU and select appropriate mathematical library functions.

Another coprocessor for the 8086/8088 central processor was the 8089 input/output coprocessor. It used the same programming technique as 8087 for input/output operations, such as transfer of data from memory to a peripheral device, and so reducing the load on the CPU. But IBM did not use it in IBM PC design and Intel stopped development of this type of coprocessor.

The Intel 80386 microprocessor used an optional &quot;math&quot; coprocessor (the 80387) to perform floating-point operations directly in hardware. The Intel 80486DX processor included floating-point hardware on the chip. Intel released a cost-reduced processor, the 80486SX, that had no floating-point hardware, and also sold an 80487SX coprocessor that essentially disabled the main processor when installed, since the 80487SX was a complete 80486DX with a different set of pin connections.

Intel processors later than the 80486 integrated floating-point hardware on the main processor chip; the advances in integration eliminated the cost advantage of selling the floating-point processor as an optional element. It would be very difficult to adapt circuit-board techniques adequate at 75 MHz processor speed to meet the time-delay, power consumption, and radio-frequency interference standards required at gigahertz-range clock speeds. These on-chip floating-point processors are still referred to as coprocessors because they operate in parallel with the main CPU.

During the era of 8- and 16-bit desktop computers another common source of floating-point coprocessors was Weitek. These coprocessors had a different instruction set from the Intel coprocessors, and used a different socket, which not all motherboards supported. The Weitek processors did not provide transcendental mathematics functions (for example, trigonometric functions) like the Intel x87 family, and required specific software libraries to support their functions.

==Motorola==
The Motorola 68000 family had the 68881/68882 coprocessors which provided similar floating-point speed acceleration as for the Intel processors. Computers using the 68000 family but not equipped with the hardware floating-point processor could trap and emulate the floating-point instructions in software, which, although slower, allowed one binary version of the program to be distributed for both cases. The 68451 memory-management coprocessor was designed to work with the 68020 processor.

==Modern coprocessors==
, dedicated Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) in the form of graphics cards are commonplace. Certain models of sound cards have been fitted with dedicated processors providing digital multichannel mixing and real-time DSP effects as early as 1990 to 1994 (the Gravis Ultrasound and Sound Blaster AWE32 being typical examples), while the Sound Blaster Audigy and the Sound Blaster X-Fi are more recent examples.

In 2006, AGEIA announced an add-in card for computers that it called the PhysX PPU. PhysX was designed to perform complex physics computations so that the CPU and GPU do not have to perform these time-consuming calculations. It was designed for video games, although other mathematical uses could theoretically be developed for it. In 2008, Nvidia purchased the company and phased out the PhysX card line; the functionality was added through software allowing their GPUs to render PhysX on cores normally used for graphics processing, using their Nvidia PhysX engine software.

In 2006, BigFoot Systems unveiled a PCI add-in card they christened the KillerNIC which ran its own special Linux kernel on a FreeScale PowerQUICC running at 400 MHz, calling the FreeScale chip a Network Processing Unit or NPU.

The SpursEngine is a media-oriented add-in card with a coprocessor based on the Cell microarchitecture. The SPUs are themselves vector coprocessors.

In 2008, Khronos Group released the OpenCL with the aim to support general-purpose CPUs, ATI/AMD and Nvidia GPUs (and other accelerators) with a single common language for compute kernels.

In 2010s, some mobile computation devices had implemented the sensor hub as a coprocessor. Examples of coprocessors used for handling sensor integration in mobile devices include the Apple M7 and M8 motion coprocessors, the Qualcomm Snapdragon Sensor Core and Qualcomm Hexagon, and the Holographic Processing Unit for the Microsoft HoloLens.

In 2012, Intel announced the Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor.

, various companies are developing coprocessors aimed at accelerating artificial neural networks for vision and other cognitive tasks (e.g. vision processing units, TrueNorth, and Zeroth), and as of 2018, such AI chips are in smartphones such as from Apple, and several Android phone vendors.

==Other coprocessors==
* The MIPS architecture supports up to four coprocessor units, used for memory management, floating-point arithmetic, and two undefined coprocessors for other tasks such as graphics accelerators.
* Using FPGA (field-programmable gate arrays), custom coprocessors can be created for acceleration of particular processing tasks such as digital signal processing (e.g. Zynq, combines ARM cores with FPGA on a single die).
* TLS/SSL accelerators, used on servers; such accelerators used to be cards, but in modern times are instructions for crypto in mainstream CPUs.
* Some multi-core chips can be programmed so that one of their processors is the primary processor, and the other processors are supporting coprocessors.
* China&#x27;s Matrix 2000 128 core PCI-e coprocessor is a proprietary accelerator that requires a CPU to run it, and has been employed in an upgrade of the 17,792 node Tianhe-2 supercomputer (2 Intel Knights Bridge+ 2 Matrix 2000 each), now dubbed 2A, roughly doubling its speed at 95 petaflops, exceeding the world&#x27;s fastest supercomputer.
* A range of coprocessors were available for various models from Acorn Computers, notably the BBC Micro and BBC Master series. Rather than special-purpose graphics or arithmetic devices, these were general-purpose CPUs (principally the 6502, Zilog Z80, National Semiconductor 32016, and ARM 1) described as second processors, typically interfaced to the host system using a message passing architecture known as the Tube, with Acorn&#x27;s own products providing such processors in a BBC Micro expansion unit with accompanying memory and interfacing circuitry. Software could be executed independently on the second processor, and applications could be written to offload work from the host system, leaving it to perform input/output tasks, resulting in acceleration. Since a range of CPUs were available in a variety of products, a BBC Micro fitted with such a coprocessor was able to run operating systems for other processor architectures, such as CP/M, DOS and Unix, along with accompanying software.

==Trends==
Over time CPUs have tended to grow to absorb the functionality of the most popular coprocessors. FPUs are now considered an integral part of a processors&#x27; main pipeline; SIMD units gave multimedia its acceleration, taking over the role of various DSP accelerator cards; and even GPUs have become integrated on CPU dies. Nonetheless, specialized units remain popular away from desktop machines, and for additional power, and allow continued evolution independently of the main processor product lines.

<text>Modern English is written with a Latin-script alphabet consisting of 26 letters, with each having both uppercase and lowercase forms. The word &quot;alphabet&quot; is a compound of &quot;alpha&quot; and &quot;beta&quot;, the names of the first two letters in the Greek alphabet. Old English was first written down using the Latin alphabet during the 7th century. During the centuries that followed, various letters entered or fell out of use. By the 16th century, the present set of 26 letters had largely stabilised:

There are 5 vowel letters and 19 consonant letters—as well as Y and W, which may function as either type.

Written English has a large number of digraphs, such as , , , , and . Diacritics are generally not used to write native English words, which is unusual among orthographies used to write the languages of Europe.

==Letter names==
The names of the letters are commonly spelled out in compound words and initialisms (e.g., &quot;tee-shirt, deejay, emcee, okay,&quot; etc.), derived forms (e.g., &quot;exed out, effing, to eff and blind, &quot;, etc.), and objects named after letters (e.g., &quot;en&quot; and &quot;em&quot; in printing, and &quot;wye&quot; in railroading). The spellings listed below are from the Oxford English Dictionary. Plurals of consonant names are formed by adding &quot;-s&quot; (e.g., &quot;bees&quot;, &quot;efs&quot; or &quot;effs&quot;, &quot;ems&quot;) or &quot;-es&quot; in the cases of &quot;aitches&quot;, &quot;esses&quot;, &quot;exes&quot;. Plurals of vowel names also take &quot;-es&quot; (i.e., &quot;aes&quot;, &quot;ees&quot;, &quot;ies&quot;, &quot;oes&quot;, &quot;ues&quot;), but these are rare. For a letter as a letter, the letter itself is most commonly used, generally in capitalised form, in which case the plural just takes &quot;-s&quot; or &quot;-&#x27;s&quot; (e.g. &quot;Cs&quot; or &quot;c&#x27;s&quot; for &quot;cees&quot;).


=== Etymology ===
The names of the letters are for the most part direct descendants, via French, of the Latin (and Etruscan) names. (See Latin alphabet: Origins.)

The regular phonological developments (in rough chronological order) are:
* palatalization before front vowels of Latin successively to , , and finally to Middle French . Affects C.
* palatalization before front vowels of Latin to Proto-Romance and Middle French . Affects G.
* fronting of Latin to Middle French , becoming Middle English and then Modern English . Affects Q, U.
* the inconsistent lowering of Middle English to . Affects R.
* the Great Vowel Shift, shifting all Middle English long vowels. Affects A, B, C, D, E, G, H, I, K, O, P, T, and presumably Y.

The novel forms are &quot;aitch&quot;, a regular development of Medieval Latin &quot;acca&quot;; &quot;jay&quot;, a new letter presumably vocalised like neighboring &quot;kay&quot; to avoid confusion with established &quot;gee&quot; (the other name, &quot;jy&quot;, was taken from French); &quot;vee&quot;, a new letter named by analogy with the majority; &quot;double-u&quot;, a new letter, self-explanatory (the name of Latin V was &quot;ū&quot;); &quot;wye&quot;, of obscure origin but with an antecedent in Old French &quot;wi&quot;; , from the Romance phrase &quot;i zed&quot; or &quot;i zeto&quot; &quot;and Z&quot; said when reciting the alphabet; and &quot;zee&quot;, an American levelling of &quot;zed&quot; by analogy with other consonants.

Some groups of letters, such as &quot;pee&quot; and &quot;bee&quot;, or &quot;em&quot; and &quot;en&quot;, are easily confused in speech, especially when heard over the telephone or a radio communications link. Spelling alphabets such as the ICAO spelling alphabet, used by aircraft pilots, police and others, are designed to eliminate this potential confusion by giving each letter a name that sounds quite different from any other.

===Ampersand===
The ampersand (&amp;) has sometimes appeared at the end of the English alphabet, as in Byrhtferð&#x27;s list of letters in 1011. &quot;&amp;&quot; was regarded as the 27th letter of the English alphabet, as taught to children in the US and elsewhere. An example may be seen in M. B. Moore&#x27;s 1863 book &quot;The Dixie Primer, for the Little Folks&quot;. Historically, the figure is a ligature for the letters &quot;Et&quot;. In English and many other languages, it is used to represent the word &quot;and&quot;, plus occasionally the Latin word &quot;et&quot;, as in the abbreviation &quot;&amp;c&quot; (et cetera).

===Archaic letters===
Old and Middle English had a number of non-Latin letters that have since dropped out of use. Some of these either took the names of the equivalent runes, since there were no Latin names to adopt, or were runes themselves (thorn, wyn). 
*Æ æ &quot;Ash&quot; or &quot;æsc&quot; , used for the vowel , which disappeared from the language and then reformed. Replaced by ae and e now.
*Ð ð &quot;Edh&quot;, &quot;eð&quot; or &quot;eth&quot; , used for the consonants and (which did not become phonemically distinct until after the letter had fallen out of use). Replaced by th now. 
*Þ þ &quot;Thorn&quot; or &quot;þorn&quot; , used for the consonants and (which did not become phonemically distinct until after the letter had fallen out of use). Replaced by th now.
*Œ œ &quot;Ethel&quot;, &quot;ēðel&quot;, &quot;œ̄þel&quot;, etc. , used for the vowel , which disappeared from the language quite early. Replaced by oe and e now.
*Ƿ ƿ &quot;Wyn&quot;, &quot;ƿen&quot; (Kentish) or &quot;wynn&quot; , used for the consonant . (The letter &#x27;w&#x27; had not yet been invented.) Replaced by w now.
*Ȝ ȝ &quot;Yogh&quot;, &quot;ȝogh&quot; or &quot;yoch&quot; or , used for various sounds derived from , such as and . Replaced by y, j, gh, and ch now.
*ſ &quot;long s&quot;, an earlier form of the lowercase &quot;s&quot; that continued to be used alongside the modern lowercase s into the 1800s. Replaced by lowercase s now.
*ꝛ &quot;r rotunda&quot;, an alternative form of the lowercase &quot;r&quot;.

== Diacritics ==

The most common diacritic marks seen in English publications are the acute (é), grave (è), circumflex (â, î, or ô), tilde (ñ), umlaut and diaeresis (ü or ï—the same symbol is used for two different purposes), and cedilla (ç). Diacritics used for tonal languages may be replaced with tonal numbers or omitted.

=== Loanwords ===
Diacritic marks mainly appear in loanwords such as &quot;naïve&quot; and &quot;façade&quot;. Informal English writing tends to omit diacritics because of their absence from the keyboard, while professional copywriters and typesetters tend to include them.

As such words become naturalised in English, there is a tendency to drop the diacritics, as has happened with many older borrowings from French, such as &quot;hôtel&quot;. Words that are still perceived as foreign tend to retain them; for example, the only spelling of &quot;soupçon&quot; found in English dictionaries (the OED and others) uses the diacritic. However, diacritics are likely to be retained even in naturalised words where they would otherwise be confused with a common native English word (for example, &quot;résumé&quot; rather than &quot;resume&quot;). Rarely, they may even be added to a loanword for this reason (as in &quot;maté&quot;, from Spanish &quot;yerba mate&quot; but following the pattern of &quot;café&quot;, from French, to distinguish from &quot;mate&quot;).

=== Native English words ===
Occasionally, especially in older writing, diacritics are used to indicate the syllables of a word: &quot;cursed&quot; (verb) is pronounced with one syllable, while &quot;cursèd&quot; (adjective) is pronounced with two. For this, &quot;è&quot; is used widely in poetry, e.g., in Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets. J. R. R. Tolkien used &quot;ë&quot;, as in &quot;O wingëd crown&quot;.

Similarly, while in &quot;chicken coop&quot; the letters &quot;-oo-&quot; represent a single vowel sound (a digraph), they less often represent two which may be marked with a diaresis as in &quot;zoölogist&quot; and &quot;coöperation&quot;. This use of the diaeresis is rare but found in some well-known publications, such as &quot;MIT Technology Review&quot; and &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. Some publications, particularly in UK usage, have replaced the diaeresis with a hyphen such as in co-operative.

In general, these devices are not used even where they would serve to alleviate some degree of confusion.

== Punctuation marks within words ==

=== Apostrophe ===
The apostrophe (ʼ) is not usually considered part of the English alphabet nor used as a diacritic, even in loanwords. But it is used for two important purposes in written English: to mark the &quot;possessive&quot; and to mark contracted words. Current standards require its use for both purposes. Therefore, apostrophes are necessary to spell many words even in isolation, unlike most punctuation marks, which are concerned with indicating sentence structure and other relationships among multiple words.

* It distinguishes (from the otherwise identical regular plural inflection &quot;-s&quot;) the English possessive morpheme &quot;&#x27;s&quot; (apostrophe alone after a regular plural affix, giving &quot;-s&quot;&#x27; as the standard mark for plural + possessive). Practice settled in the 18th century; before then, practices varied but typically all three endings were written &quot;-s&quot; (but without cumulation). This meant that only regular nouns bearing neither could be confidently identified, and plural and possessive could be potentially confused (e.g., &quot;the Apostles words&quot;&quot;;&quot; &quot;those things over there are my husbands&quot;)—which undermines the logic of &quot;marked&quot; forms.
* Many common contractions have near-homographs from which they are distinguished in writing only by an apostrophe, for example &quot;it&#x27;s&quot; (&quot;it is&quot; or &quot;it has&quot;) as opposed to &quot;its&quot;, the possessive form of &quot;it&quot;, or &quot;she&#x27;d&quot; (&quot;she would&quot; or &quot;she had&quot;) as opposed to &quot;shed&quot;.

In a &quot;Chronicle of Higher Education&quot; blog, Geoffrey Pullum argued that apostrophe is the 27th letter of the alphabet, arguing that it does not function as a form of punctuation.

=== Hyphen ===
Hyphens are often used in English compound words. Written compound words may be hyphenated, open or closed, so specifics are guided by stylistic policy. Some writers may use a slash in certain instances.

== Frequencies ==

The letter most commonly used in English is E. The least used letter is Z. The frequencies shown in the table may differ in practice according to the type of text.

== Phonology ==
The letters A, E, I, O, and U are considered vowel letters, since (except when silent) they represent vowels, although I and U represent consonants in words such as &quot;onion&quot; and &quot;quail&quot; respectively.

The letter Y sometimes represents a consonant (as in &quot;young&quot;) and sometimes a vowel (as in &quot;myth&quot;). Very rarely, W may represent a vowel (as in &quot;cwm&quot;, a Welsh loanword).

The consonant sounds represented by the letters W and Y in English (/w/ and /j/ as in went /wɛnt/ and yes /jɛs/) are referred to as semi-vowels (or &quot;glides&quot;) by linguists, however this is a description that applies to the &quot;sounds&quot; represented by the letters and not to the letters themselves.

The remaining letters are considered consonant letters, since when not silent they generally represent consonants.

== History ==
===Old English===
The English language itself was initially written in the Anglo-Saxon futhorc runic alphabet, in use from the 5th century. This alphabet was brought to what is now England, along with the proto-form of the language itself, by Anglo-Saxon settlers. Very few examples of this form of written Old English have survived, mostly as short inscriptions or fragments.

The Latin script, introduced by Christian missionaries, began to replace the Anglo-Saxon futhorc from about the 7th century, although the two continued in parallel for some time. As such, the Old English alphabet began to employ parts of the Roman alphabet in its construction. Futhorc influenced the emerging English alphabet by providing it with the letters &quot;thorn&quot; (Þ þ) and &quot;wynn&quot; (Ƿ ƿ). The letter &quot;eth&quot; (Ð ð) was later devised as a modification of &quot;dee&quot; (D d), and finally &quot;yogh&quot; ( ) was created by Norman scribes from the insular &quot;g&quot; in Old English and Irish, and used alongside their Carolingian &quot;g&quot;.

The a-e ligature &quot;ash&quot; (Æ æ) was adopted as a letter in its own right, named after a futhorc rune &quot;æsc&quot;. In very early Old English the o-e ligature &quot;ethel&quot; (Œ œ) also appeared as a distinct letter, likewise named after a rune, &quot;œðel&quot;. Additionally, the v–v or u-u ligature &quot;double-u&quot; (W w) was in use.

In the year 1011, a monk named Byrhtferð recorded the traditional order of the Old English alphabet. He listed the 23 letters of the Latin alphabet first, plus the ampersand, then 5 additional English letters, starting with the Tironian note &quot;ond&quot; (⁊), an insular symbol for &quot;and&quot;:

===Modern English===
In the orthography of Modern English, the letters thorn (þ), eth (ð), wynn (ƿ), yogh (), ash (æ), and ethel (œ) are obsolete. Latin borrowings reintroduced homographs of æ and œ into Middle English and Early Modern English, though they are largely obsolete (see &quot;Ligatures in recent usage&quot; below), and where they are used they are not considered to be separate letters (e.g., for collation purposes), but rather ligatures. Thorn and eth were both replaced by &quot;th&quot;, though thorn continued in existence for some time, its lowercase form gradually becoming graphically indistinguishable from the minuscule y in most handwriting. &quot;Y&quot; for &quot;th&quot; can still be seen in pseudo-archaisms such as &quot;Ye Olde Booke Shoppe&quot;. The letters þ and ð are still used in present-day Icelandic (where they now represent two separate sounds, and having become phonemically-distinct – as indeed also happened in Modern English), while ð is still used in present-day Faroese (although only as a silent letter). Wynn disappeared from English around the 14th century when it was supplanted by &quot;uu&quot;, which ultimately developed into the modern &quot;w&quot;. Yogh disappeared around the 15th century and was typically replaced by &quot;gh&quot;.

The letters &quot;u&quot; and &quot;j&quot;, as distinct from &quot;v&quot; and &quot;i&quot;, were introduced in the 16th century, and &quot;w&quot; assumed the status of an independent letter. The variant lowercase form long s (ſ) lasted into early modern English, and was used in non-final position up to the early 19th century. Today, the English alphabet is considered to consist of the following 26 letters:

Written English has a number of digraphs, but they are not considered separate letters of the alphabet:

=== Ligatures in recent usage ===

Outside of professional papers on specific subjects that traditionally use ligatures in loanwords, ligatures are seldom used in modern English. The ligatures &quot;æ&quot; and &quot;œ&quot; were until the 19th century (slightly later in American English) used in formal writing for certain words of Greek or Latin origin, such as &quot;encyclopædia&quot; and &quot;cœlom&quot;, although such ligatures were not used in either classical Latin or ancient Greek. These are now usually rendered as &quot;ae&quot; and &quot;oe&quot; in all types of writing, although in American English, a lone &quot;e&quot; has mostly supplanted both (for example, &quot;encyclopedia&quot; for &quot;encyclopaedia&quot;, and &quot;maneuver&quot; for &quot;manoeuvre&quot;).

Some typefaces used to typeset English texts contain commonly used ligatures, such as for , , , , and . These are not independent lettersalthough in traditional typesetting, each of these ligatures would have its own sort (type element) for practical reasons but simply type design choices created to optimize the legibility of the text.

==Proposed reforms==
There have been a number of proposals to extend or replace the basic English alphabet. These include proposals for the addition of letters to the English alphabet, such as &quot;eng&quot; or &quot;engma&quot; (Ŋ ŋ), used to replace the digraph &quot;ng&quot; and represent the voiced velar nasal sound with a single letter. Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s phonetic alphabet, based on the Latin alphabet, introduced a number of new letters as part of a wider proposal to reform English orthography. Other proposals have gone further, proposing entirely new scripts for written English to replace the Latin alphabet such as the Deseret alphabet and the Shavian alphabet.

<text>Princes Risborough () is a market town and civil parish in Buckinghamshire, England; it is located about south of Aylesbury and northwest of High Wycombe. It lies at the foot of the Chiltern Hills, at the north end of a gap or pass through the Chilterns; the south end of which is at West Wycombe. The A4010 road follows this route from West Wycombe through the town and then on to Aylesbury.

Historically, it was both a manor and an ecclesiastical parish, of the same extent as the manor, which comprised the present ecclesiastical parish of Princes Risborough (excluding Ilmer) and also the present ecclesiastical parish of Lacey Green, which became a separate parish in the 19th century. It was long and narrow (a &quot;strip parish&quot;), taking in land below the Chiltern scarp, the slope of the scarp itself and also land above the scarp extending into the Chiltern hills. The manor and the parish extended from Longwick in the north through Alscot, the town of Princes Risborough, Loosley Row and Lacey Green to Speen and Walters Ash in the south.

Since 1934, the civil parish of Princes Risborough (formerly the same as the ecclesiastical parish) has included the town of Princes Risborough, the village of Monks Risborough (but not the outlying parts) and part of Horsenden but has excluded Longwick. It is within the Wycombe district of Buckinghamshire and operates as a town council within Wycombe district.

The town is overlooked by the Whiteleaf Cross, a chalk cross carved into the hillside that&#x27;s just northeast of the town. Though the cross itself lies just above the village with the same name, the landmark is located within the area of Monks Risborough.

==Toponym==
The name &#x27;Risborough&#x27; comes from the Old English &quot;hrisen beorgas&quot; meaning &#x27;brushwood-covered hills&#x27;. &quot;Hrisen&quot;, an adjective meaning brushwood-covered derived from &quot;hris&quot; meaning brushwood or scrub, and &quot;beorgas&quot; which meant hills. The spelling varies in the documents in which the name is found.

In the 13th century, it was known as Magna Risberge (Great Risborough) which distinguished it from Parva Risberge (Little Risborough), which is now Monks Risborough. Later it was Earls Risborough because the manor was held by the Earls of Cornwall between 1242 and 1336. At some point, following the death of Edward the Black Prince, it became Prince Risberge and later Princes Risborough, as the manor belonged to various Princes during the Wars of the Roses during the 15th century.

==Risborough 1066–1086==
Great Risborough, as it was then known, had been a Saxon village held by Edward the Confessor. As a royal manor it could be used by the King to make financial provision for members of the royal family or others whom the King at any point might wish to reward. The current land where the royal manor once stood (now a car park known as The Mount) bares traces of banks and entrenchments, enclosed by a moat and is originally believed to have been a Saxon encampment. The land was then held shortly by Harold Godwinson before he was defeated at the Battle of Hastings.

Before 1066, the land of the manor and village only paid £10 at face value (i.e. without weighing the coins). Furthermore, a burgess of Oxford paid 2s and a saltboiler of Droitwich an amount left blank. A freeman held three virgates and had the right to sell his land, though it was said that he served the sheriff. At the time of the Domesday survey in 1086, the Manor of Risborough was an extensive complex of a royal manor, stud farm, deer park and a large fishery. There most likely was an earlier church on the current site of St Mary&#x27;s Church today. It was part of the Hundred of Risborough, which also comprised Bledlow, Horsenden and Monks Risborough. 

In 1086, the land was assessed at 30 hides both before and after the conquest, of which 20 hides related to the demesne. The manor had land for 24 ploughs, four of them in the lord&#x27;s demesne. There were 30 villagers and they together with 12 bordars (cottagers or small holders) had 20 ploughs. There were three slaves. There were two mills, worth 14s 8d a year, meadow for seven ploughteams (generally taken as needing eight oxen each) and woodland sufficient for 1,000 pigs. In total, it paid £47 a year in white silver, less 16d.

==Risborough as a Royal Manor==
After the Norman Conquest, the local woods on the land of the Manor were privatized under the forest law and formed part of the lands of the new King, William the Conqueror who granted Risborough&#x27;s royal manor as one of 48 Buckinghamshire manors to the feudal barony of Long Crendon held by Walter Giffard, Lord of Longueville for his many years of loyal service. In 1085, lordship of the manor of Risborough passed to his son Walter Giffard, 1st Earl of Buckingham. By the 12th century, it was still held by the Giffard family, namely Walter Giffard, 2nd Earl of Buckingham, when he died without issue in 1164 it reverted to the Crown. 

It was then granted to the Constable of Normandy, Robert de Humeto, who obtained a charter from King Henry II, and remained in his family until about 1242. King Henry III then granted the manor to his brother Richard, Earl of Cornwall, it was then meant to pass to Richard&#x27;s eldest son Henry of Almain but when he was murdered before his father died, Richard ordered his estates be passed to his second son, Edmund, 2nd Earl of Cornwall. When Edmund died childless in 1300, his estates including the royal manor of what was now called Earls Risborough were escheated to the Crown.

Between 1302 and 1305, King Edward I granted it to Queen Margaret for her life, subject to the rights of Edmund&#x27;s widow Margaret, Countess of Cornwall, in one third part for life as part of her dower. King Edward II gave the reversion (subject to these life interests) to his unpopular favourite, Piers Gaveston and his wife, but this grant was surrendered in the same year. Queen Margaret died in 1318. In 1327, when Edward III succeeded to the throne at the age of fifteen, he granted the manor to his mother, Queen Isabella for her services during his father&#x27;s reign. The King&#x27;s brother, John of Eltham, Earl of Cornwall, also had an interest for a time.

The King then granted the manor to his eldest son, Edward Prince of Wales, known later (though not during his lifetime) as the Black Prince. He held the manor for 32 years from 1344 to 1376 when he died. 

On the death of the Black Prince, the manor passed to his son, Richard of Bordeaux, who became King Richard II in the following year. He granted it to Lewis de Clifford who held it for his life. When it reverted to King Henry IV, the manor passed through the royal family for many years who granted it to his son Henry, Prince of Wales, who became King Henry V in 1413. It then passed to Henry VI and was part of the dower of his Queen, Margaret of Anjou. Later, it was held by his son, Edward, and then appears to have remained vested in the Crown until Edward VI granted it to his half-sister, the Princess (later Queen) Elizabeth for her life.

Subsequently, James I held it and it formed part of the dower of his Queen, Anne of Denmark. Later again it was held by Prince Charles, later King Charles I, who in 1628 sold it to the City of London in part satisfaction of the large debts of the Crown. Thus, after more than 600 years, the manor&#x27;s long connection with the Crown of England finally came to an end. Subsequently, the manor was bought and sold in the market and changed hands from time to time, but its later manorial history is only a record of commercial transactions.

==Risborough under the Black Prince==
King Edward III granted the Manor of Risborough in 1344 to his eldest son, Edward Prince of Wales, known posthumously as the Black Prince. He was 14 years of age and he held the manor for 32 years until his death in 1376. Edward III did not die until 1377 and the Prince never became king. It was after the Black Prince&#x27;s death that the market town became known as Prince Risberge later Princes Risborough.

At the time when the Prince became lord of the manor of Risborough, there was a manor house and hall on the west side of the church (where there is now a car park), which old sources describe as his &quot;palace&quot;. To some extent, the manor was laid out on much the same lines as other manor houses (also called &quot;palaces&quot; at the time) like Much Hadham Palace in Hertfordshire and Woking Palace in Surrey and possibly the manor at Watlington which also belonged to the Black Prince. The manor house and grounds may have been extensive but it was hardly palatial and might be better described as a hunting lodge. The Prince seems never to have spent an extended period of time there. The nearest place where he lived for any length of time was Berkhamsted Castle, where he stayed after his marriage to Joan Countess of Kent from November 1361 to January 1362 and occasionally at other times.

By the 14th century, the Manor was known for its Royal stud for breeding horses and hunting. The main purpose of the Prince&#x27;s visits to Risborough is likely to have been to visit the stud and inspect and/or select stallions with such resounding names as Grisel, Tankarvill, Morel de Salesbirs.

Much of his adult life was spent on campaign in France, where he won the great victory of Poitiers in 1356. In July 1362, his father (Edward III) made him Prince of Aquitaine and he remained in that province until he returned to England in 1371, probably already a sick man. In 1346, when the Prince (aged 16) was about to leave with his father for his first campaign in France, which culminated in the battle of Crecy, a Council was set up to manage on his behalf his various manors and lordships throughout the country. The transactions of this Council were recorded and have been printed and published by the Public Record Office. Many decisions affecting Risborough were made by this Council rather than by the Prince himself. They give us some insight into life at Risborough in the 14th century.

The manor was in the charge of a steward (not always resident there), but its day-to-day management was in the hands of the reeve, and there was a parker, responsible for the management of the park, and a keeper of the stud.

In November 1346, John de Alveton was appointed to be steward of the Prince&#x27;s manors of Watlington and Risborough. In 1347 the keeper of the stud was Richard de Bekenesfield and he was ordered to render tithes due to the Abbot of Notley if there were sufficient foals of the year for the purpose. In the same year the Reeve had been ordered to pay money out of the profits of Risborough to make a new kitchen at the Prince&#x27;s manor of Byfleet. In 1354, in which year the Prince was at Berkhamsted, a piece of land in the Park was enclosed by the Prince and the Reeve (William Onyot) paid 18 shillings for it. The Prince may well have been there in person that year for the Treasurer of his household was ordered &quot;by command of the Prince himself&quot; to make payment for various things taken for the Prince&#x27;s use and expended in the Prince&#x27;s household at Risborough &quot;after verifying that the same are really due&quot;. These included a total of 186 gallons of ale and &quot;to John Dayly of Risborough 17 pence for underwood and fuel for the fire&quot;.

In 1359, Sir Peter de Lacey the Prince&#x27;s clerk and receiver-general was ordered to provide hay, oats, shoes and litter until further order for two destriers (warhorses) which Sir Baldwin Bottecourt had lent to the Prince to be stallions at Risborough and Cippenham and to pay 3d a day to a groom that keeps them.

There seems to have been a great storm in 1362, when the Reeve was to allow the Parker to sell all the wood which had fallen in the Park except the great ash, if its value did not exceed £4.

In April 1364, the Reeve had to make provision for a grey courser which was sent to cover the mares at Risborough and in July to pay £10.10s for a black stallion for the same purpose. Also in 1364, the Reeve was to cause the garret over the gate of the Prince&#x27;s Park to be demolished and pulled down, as it was reported very weak and ruinous, and to use the timber and other materials to build a lodge near the gate. He was also to flush out the ditches round the manor and to sell as dearly as possible all the large fish caught there, keeping the small fish as stock.

The Prince died at Westminster on 8 June 1376 aged 46.

==Churches==
===St Mary&#x27;s church===

The church in its present general form dates from the 13th century. There was an earlier small church, probably just a small chancel and a nave without aisles, which would have been in roughly the same position as the present nave. The church was enlarged and improved from the 13th to the 15th centuries as described below. By the 19th century, it was in bad condition and was extensively restored and partly rebuilt in 1867–68. The tower and spire were rebuilt in 1907–08 and parish rooms were added in the 21st century.

====Nave and chancel====
The church was enlarged by the addition of the nave arcades and aisles in the early or mid-13th century The arches at the western end of each arcade were added in the late 13th or early 14th century, those on the south being later. The columns are octagonal with plain chamfered bases and moulded capitals. There were originally deep solid responds at the eastern end of each arcade (altered to make a narrower additional arch in the 19th century). There are now seven arches on each side.

The chancel was rebuilt about 1290 and the two-light window in the north wall is of that date (much restored) with a modern quatrefoil above. The two windows in the south wall of the chancel are probably of about 1340. The east window is modern.

In the south aisle, the window at the east end is of about 1300. The easternmost window in the south wall is &quot;a fine triplet of lancets&quot;, &quot;a very remarkable window&quot; and has attached and detached shafts of Purbeck marble making an open arcade of three bays. This is dated to the early 13th century. The other window in this aisle (on the western side of the door) is of about 1340.

Below the windows in the south aisle are four 14th-century recesses with ogee heads which once probably held tombs.

At the end of the south wall of the south aisle, next to the altar, are a piscina (a shelf on which the sacred vessels were washed after Mass) and a sedile (a stone seat for the priest), both in the decorated gothic style of the 14th century but badly damaged. These were always found on the right side of an altar and show that there was an altar at the end of this aisle in the Middle Ages. This piscina has no drain but there is a stone shelf above it.

In the north aisle are four modern windows from the 19th-century rebuilding of this wall, using some old materials. The 14th-century door on the north side was formerly blocked, but now serves as the entrance to the new parish rooms which were built at the start of the 21st century on the north side of the church.

====Tower and spire====
The church originally had a tower with a spire above it, probably built in the 15th century, but this spire fell down in 1803, damaging the church and destroying a peal of bells. A new stone spire was built, octagonal in shape, and described in 1862 as covered with galvanised iron. In 1907–08 a new tower and spire were built from the foundations, designed by John Oldrid Scott.

In 1765, the Earl of Buckingham gave the rectory of Princes Risborough to the manor at Nutley Abbey in Long Crendon, to which it is still attached today.

===St Teresa&#x27;s church===
This domed church, on the corner of the Aylesbury Road and New Road, was designed by Giuseppe Rinvolucri and built in 1937–38. Pevsner &amp; Williamson explain that in plan it is a triangle interpenetrating a hexagon, with an apse in the middle of each side of the triangle.

Inside the church, there are two painted ceramic statues, of St Teresa of Lisieux and St Joseph, by Richard Guino. The altar relief is also by him. The Stations of the Cross are timber reliefs (1990–1) by Stephen Foster, which Pevsner &amp; Williamson considered of high quality. An altar rail (1957) by Rosamund Fletcher now serves as a screen to St Teresa&#x27;s chapel.

===Baptist church===
The Baptist church, off Bell Street, with its own burial ground, dates from 1804 to 1805. It is built of flint with brick dressings with arched windows and has a hipped slated roof. The interior has galleries on three sides with the original baptistery under one of them.

The history of the Baptists in Princes Risborough began about 1701, when some members of the General Baptist church at Ford (later moved to Cuddington) seceded for doctrinal reasons and established a Particular Baptist meeting there. A meeting house was erected in 1707. (The Particular or Peculiar Baptists were closer to Calvinism than the General Baptists) After the present building had been erected in 1804–5, it was extended and re-arranged in 1814. The galleries were enlarged in 1833 and a vestry was added in 1871.

In the mid-20th century, two sides were rendered with pebble-dash and a new entrance and porch were added in the front. Extensive additions with additional rooms have been made later, adjoining the original building.

==Manor House==
===Medieval===
In medieval times, from the 13th to the 15th centuries, Manor House was a building on the south western side of the church surrounded by an earthen rampart and a moat, most of the site being now occupied by the Mount car park (the area was formerly known as the Mount). Only the base of some of the walls remained from the old building and these were partially excavated in 1955 before the car park was constructed. The remains of the building lie under the far side of the car park (farthest from the church) extending from north west to south east, parallel with the fence at the end. The whole building was about long with a minimum width of . Most of the remains had been pillaged for building material over the centuries and there was only time for a partial excavation in 1955, with the result that the excavator could only reach provisional conclusions about the nature of the building and the uses of the rooms.

Most of the remaining walls were high or less and of dry-set flint and chalk. They were only 1 foot to 1 foot 6 inches (30 to 46 cm) in width (with offsets) in shallow foundation trenches. The excavator thought that the upper part of the walls were probably made of wychert, a local building material still existing in some buildings particularly at Haddenham and consisting of chalk mud mixed with straw which would set very solid. The roofs may have been partly thatched but part must have been tiled, because a fair number of roofing tiles were found spread over the site. Looking at the building from the church side, the excavator thought that on the left was probably a two-story building which would have been the accommodation reserved for the lord of the manor. The room on the first floor would have been the &quot;great chamber&quot; serving as bedroom and sitting room. The great hall probably extended in front of this part of the building towards the church, but this was not found or excavated. On the right of this room was probably the kitchen and beyond that more living accommodation, perhaps for the steward, with a smaller hall extending in front of it. This was roughly in the centre of the building. The excavator considered whether this might be the great hall but thought it probably too small. Beyond it to the right was a range of single storey rooms.

The remainder of the area could not be excavated, but trial holes indicated that most of it may have been paved with cobbles.

The only positive evidence of date was a somewhat worn penny of Edward I, struck at the Bristol mint in 1280–1, which might have been lost at any time up to about 1300. The majority of the pottery found was datable to the 14th century.

The indications were that the buildings were first erected in the 13th century, perhaps in the reign of Henry III (1207–72), that they were in use throughout the 14th century (Edward II, the Prince of Wales during the reign of Edward III and Richard II) but went out of use at the end of that century or in the early 15th century.

Another building may have been erected on some part of the site at a later date, because there are documentary references to such a building in the reign of Elizabeth I and its remains are said to have been demolished around 1800.

===Modern===

The house now known as the Manor House stands opposite the east end of the church. It was formerly known as Brook or Brooke House and the name was only changed in the late 19th century.

The house is first mentioned (as Broke House) in the reign of Elizabeth I in a grant dated 1589, but this was an earlier building, though some parts of it are incorporated in the present house. Arthur Oswald thought that the interior wall parallel to the front outside wall and fireplaces in two of the bedrooms may come from the Elizabethan house. The house was substantially enlarged and rebuilt in the mid-17th century.

Inigo Jones had brought the classical Renaissance style to England in the early 17th century. His followers took the new classical style into the country, characterised by its symmetry and proportion and such classical elements as pilasters, while wide eaves took the place of a cornice. Often a bricklayer would also be the principal contractor, controlling the other trades, and he could avoid the necessity to employ a mason for stonework if he could produce the classical elements in brick. So in this house we have brick pilasters, one above the other, with capitals and bases shaped in brickwork. The rebuilding seems to have been carried out in two stages, though without a long gap between them. There is a straight joint in the brickwork to the left of the second pilaster on the north side. In front of this the bricks are laid in English bond, but Flemish bond is used towards the back, indicating that this part was built a little later.
The house is built of red brick with two storeys and an attic. The frontage has five windows, widely spaced and separated by brick pilasters in two orders corresponding to the ground and first floors. Originally there was a large central attic window of &#x27;Dutch&#x27; type (as can be seen in the woodcut from Lipscomb&#x27;s History of the County of Buckingham (1847)). This was replaced by three dormer windows in the late 19th century.

Inside the house, the staircase and some of the panelling and fireplaces in the hall and drawing room date from the 17th-century re-building. The oak staircase opens at the back of the hall through a 17th-century arch and ascends two storeys round a square well. Arthur Oswald describes it as of Jacobean type but likely to have been made by a country joiner at the time of the Commonwealth or Charles II. Pevsner &amp; Williamson, who call it &quot;spectacular&quot;, describe it as made in the mid-17th century but in the strapwork tradition.


Arthur Oswald thought that the entrance doorway and sash windows were probably 18th-century alterations made in Georgian times, but Pevsner and Williamson think they might be part of Lord Rothschild&#x27;s alterations in 1886.

By the mid-19th century, the house was very dilapidated and part was being used for storing grain. Lord Rothschild bought it in the 1880s and arranged for it to be renovated and put into repair. This work started in 1886, but there is no record of exactly what was done. It was probably after the completion of this work that the name was changed to the Manor House. In 1926, later members of the Rothschild family gave the house to the National Trust and it was then further modernised under the direction of the Society for the Preservation of Ancient Buildings. It is usually let to a tenant and some rooms can be seen by prior appointment.

===Sir Peter Lely at Brook House===
Several books say that Sir Peter Lely lived in Princes Risborough at Brook House and that he bought the house in 1671. This is not likely to be true. Lely was a wealthy and fashionable London painter (court painter from 1661), very busy, with a house at Covent Garden, where he had an impressive collection of pictures. Samuel Pepys, after visiting him in 1667, wrote that he was a &quot;mighty proud man...and full of state.&quot; It is highly improbable that such a man would have chosen or indeed would have been able to live in a small village in the Chilterns, from London. He had more work in London than he could easily manage. His wife died in childbirth in 1674 and was buried at St Pauls, Covent Garden, where Lely himself was buried after his death in 1680. His estate comprised his house in Covent Garden and investment properties in Surrey and Lincolnshire. No biography of the painter mentions a house at Princes Risborough.

This story came from a misunderstanding of a transaction in 1671, when he was recorded as purchasing a &quot;fee farm rent&quot; issuing out of the Manor of Princes Risborough. This was a perpetual rentcharge or ground rent secured on the rents and profits of the manor (not the Manor House, which was then Brook House). In other words, it was like a financial instrument securing an annual income. He would have bought it as an investment and would have received the income at stated intervals. It is very unlikely that he ever went near Princes Risborough himself.

==Market and fairs==
The right to hold a weekly market and two yearly fairs was granted by King Henry VIII in 1523. The market was to be held on Wednesdays and the fairs on the eve, day and morrow of the Feast of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin (8 September) and on the eve, day and morrow of St George&#x27;s Day (23 April). The days were changed from time to time, the market to Saturday before 1792 and to Thursday in 1888. In 1792, there was only one fair (6 May) but the second was revived and by 1908 was held on 21 October.

The fact the town has a weekly market has come to define the parish with the words &#x27;A Medieval Market Town since 1376&#x27;, the very same year the Black Prince (the town&#x27;s most notable Lord of the Manor) died.

===Shops and factories around the parish===
For the past 100 years, the parish has also been well known for its independent developments both big and small. The big factory companies located just outside the town that provided much employment to people moving out of London after the Second World War were: Molins Tobacco Machinery Company, Forest Products Research Laboratory, Risborough Furniture, Enfield Upholstery, Austin Hoy and Leo Laboratories Ltd. 

More recently, Princes Risborough&#x27;s outskirt factory premises include Hypnos Beds, who have been granted royal warrants since 1929, were originally located in factory premises near to the railway station; they have since relocated to premises on the Longwick Road and continue to produce beds and mattresses. In 1920, Ercol Furniture set up premises in High Wycombe but, after 82 years, moved to Risborough in 2002 on new premises down Summerleys Road. 

The smaller companies were mainly those based in the town and some have held the same locations since the early-20th century and continue to be a growing source of employment:

The George &amp; Dragon Pub, was a former Coaching Inn that has existed on the same site for several hundred years. There is an old archway leading from the High Street to the back of the pub where all the old coaches, pony traps and wagons were parked. It has since been sold under new management and renovated.

The Copper Urn Café was next to the archway of the George &amp; Dragon. It has since been a cookery shop but the company have relocated to Duke Street, a small lane leading into the High Street and the premises is now run by the Kado Gift Store.

W.J Hawkins used to be next to the café; it was a tobacconist and confectioners. By the early 21st century, the shop was then divided, half was a chemist belonging to Lloyds Pharmacy and the other half was used as the town&#x27;s Post Office. The whole shop is now a larger chemist assisting a much smaller chemist up the High Street. The town&#x27;s Post Office moved to a small store in Horns Lane, just off the High Street near the town&#x27;s main traffic lights. 

The Cross Keys Practice, was established at their current premises on the High Street in 1918. Before the First World War, the building was a second Coaching Inn on the High Street with the name Cross Keys Hotel with stables at the back of building which have now been refurbished into the independent Cross Keys House. 

Wainwright&#x27;s Shoe Shop was founded by Albert Wainwright in 1919. In about 1936, the business moved to premises along the Summerleys Road by the station, before moving to a large retail unit in Station Road before the War; this retail unit has now been demolished.

Padley and Binns, was a chemist and optician shop next door to Wainwrights that provided a lot of the patients of the Cross Keys Practice with their prescriptive medicines. To this day, it is still a chemist run by Lloyds Pharmacy.

Gillingwaters was a greengrocers next to the Padley and Binns; the shop is now home to Cast Iron Range Cookers Ltd. 

Steels Bakery was a bakery store next to the Greengrocers. It was then called Speen Bakery for a while until the bakery business closed as a whole in some unknown year. The building then transformed into Top Wok Chinese Buffet and Restaurant in the early 21st century. Top Wok too closed and turned into Domino&#x27;s Pizza soon after.

Between the old Bakery and Shaw Trust charity shop are the well-known florists The Daisy Chain, who used to manage their business further up the High Street and Letsmart Property Management Ltd. Both shops are the style of original townhouses that would have belonged to families back in the 20th century. 

What is now the Shaw Trust Charity Shop building was originally owned by Mr. George Ellis, who had his own furniture and carpet store there. Families would pay in weekly installments for products. 

Granny&#x27;s Pantry was a café next door to the Mr. Ellis&#x27; shop. Having relocated from premises in the Market Square in the mid-1960s, this small café adopted the style of the small Lyons Corner Houses which originated from war times. This small café was run by Mrs. Morris. The building&#x27;s latest incarnation is now the Cinnamon Lounge Indian Restaurant.

What is now the PR Photos shop building was a small ladies clothes shop called E &amp; H&#x27;s. Next to this small shop was the solicitors, Lightfoot and Lownes. It is still the offices of the now independent Lightfoot Solicitors. 

Next to this used to be a fine red brick townhouse with three chimneys on the roof. This was a similar style house to where the Daisy Chain florists is now. However, when this large house was demolished, the site was renovated into three separate shops all owned by the Co-op in the specific layout of an electrical store, groceries and chemist. 

When all three shops closed, they were sold to different buyers and, by the early 21st century, the shops had become The Book Shop, Henley Interiors, Alternative Tools and Art &amp; Office. None of these four shops exist now; The Book Shop is now a WHSmith, the Henley Interiors shop is now a Costa Coffee outlet, Alternative Tools is an Oxfam Charity Shop and Art &amp; Office is a Flame &amp; Stone Pizza.

==Modern times==
The ecclesiastical parish of Princes Risborough today has approximately the same extent as the former manor and includes various hamlets scattered over the nearby Chiltern Hills. These include Alscot, Askett, Cadsden, Flowers Bottom, Loosley Row Lower North Dean, North Dean, Redland End, Speen and Upper North Dean.

The 1841 census lists the population of the town as 926.

After the Second World War, and partly due to the employment growth, the town&#x27;s housing community steadily increased. The new housing estates (known affectionately as the Trees and Fields estates) were built in the 1950s as council houses. 

The town is home to Princes Risborough School. Known affectionately as the &#x27;Top School&#x27; for its location, it is a co-educational secondary school that opened in 1957. It took over secondary education from the nearby Bell Street School (its location was down the hill, and is now retirement flats).

Since the reintroduction of the red kite to the Chiltern Hills, Princes Risborough has become an ideal place to view this bird of prey. They are often sighted above the town and surrounding areas.

Princes Risborough has been featured several times in films and television series (e.g. &quot;Jonathan Creek&quot;, &quot;Inspector Morse&quot;, &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot; and &quot;Double First&quot;).

It is popular with commuters as it has excellent rail links to London and Birmingham.

<text>In mathematics, the lowest common denominator or least common denominator (abbreviated LCD) is the lowest common multiple of the denominators of a set of fractions. It simplifies adding, subtracting, and comparing fractions.

== Description ==
The lowest common denominator of a set of fractions is the lowest number that is a multiple of all the denominators: their lowest common multiple. 
The product of the denominators is always a common denominator, as in:

: formula_1

but it is not always the lowest common denominator, as in:

: formula_2

Here, 36 is the least common multiple of 12 and 18. Their product, 216, is also a common denominator, but calculating with that denominator involves larger numbers:
: formula_3

With variables rather than numbers, the same principles apply:

: formula_4

Some methods of calculating the LCD are at .

== Role in arithmetic and algebra ==
The same fraction can be expressed in many different forms. As long as the ratio between numerator and denominator is the same, the fractions represent the same number. For example:

: formula_5
because they are all multiplied by 1 written as a fraction:
: formula_6

It is usually easiest to add, subtract, or compare fractions when each is expressed with the same denominator, called a &quot;common denominator&quot;. For example, the numerators of fractions with common denominators can simply be added, such that formula_7 and that formula_8, since each fraction has the common denominator 12. Without computing a common denominator, it is not obvious as to what formula_9 equals, or whether formula_10 is greater than or less than formula_11. Any common denominator will do, but usually the lowest common denominator is desirable because it makes the rest of the calculation as simple as possible.

==Practical uses==
The LCD has many practical uses, such as determining the number of objects of two different lengths necessary to align them in a row which starts and ends at the same place, such as in brickwork, tiling, and tessellation. It is also useful in planning work schedules with employees with &quot;y&quot; days off every &quot;x&quot; days.

In musical rhythm, the LCD is used in cross-rhythms and polymeters to determine the fewest notes necessary to count time given two or more metric divisions. For example, much African music is recorded in Western notation using because each measure is divided by 4 and by 3, the LCD of which is 12.

== Colloquial usage ==
The expression &quot;lowest common denominator&quot; is used to describe (usually in a disapproving manner) a rule, proposal, opinion, or media that is deliberately simplified so as to appeal to the largest possible number of people.

<text>Open architecture is a type of computer architecture or software architecture intended to make adding, upgrading, and swapping components with other computers easy. For example, the IBM PC, Amiga 2000 and Apple IIe have an open architecture supporting plug-in cards, whereas the Apple IIc computer has a closed architecture. Open architecture systems may use a standardized system bus such as S-100, PCI or ISA or they may incorporate a proprietary bus standard such as that used on the Apple II, with up to a dozen slots that allow multiple hardware manufacturers to produce add-ons, and for the user to freely install them. By contrast, closed architectures, if they are expandable at all, have one or two &quot;expansion ports&quot; using a proprietary connector design that may require a license fee from the manufacturer, or enhancements may only be installable by technicians with specialized tools or training.

Computer platforms may include systems with both open and closed architectures. The Mac mini and Compact Macintosh are closed; the Macintosh II and Power Mac G5 are open. Most desktop PCs are open architecture.

Similarly, an open software architecture is one in which additional software modules can be added to the basic framework provided by the architecture. Open APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to major software products are the way in which the basic functionality of such products can be modified or extended. The Google APIs are examples. A second type of open software architecture consists of the messages that can flow between computer systems. These messages have a standard structure that can be modified or extended per agreements between the computer systems. An example is IBM&#x27;s Distributed Data Management Architecture.

Open architecture allows potential users to see inside all or parts of the architecture without any proprietary constraints. Typically, an open architecture publishes all or parts of its architecture that the developer or integrator wants to share. The open business processes involved with an open architecture may require some license agreements between entities sharing the architecture information. Open architectures have been successfully implemented in many diverse fields, including the U.S. Navy.

<text>The Limelight was a chain of nightclubs owned and operated by Peter Gatien. It had locations in New York City, Chicago, Atlanta, London and Hallandale, Florida.

==History==

===Florida and Atlanta locations===
Peter Gatien opened the first Limelight nightclub in Hallandale, Florida, in the 1970s. The club was featured in the Jerry Lewis movie &quot;Hardly Working&quot;. Following a devastating fire on the early morning of May 6, 1980, Gatien chose Atlanta for his next incarnation of the club. The Atlanta Limelight opened in February 1980. It was housed in a strip mall at the former site of the Harlequin Dinner Theater.

The Limelight in Atlanta was a high-profile Euro-style night club designed and built in partnership with a certain Guy Larente from Montreal, Quebec who helped in the build of the Limelight series. The Limelight in Atlanta hosted many notables and celebrities over the years. A single photo taken in June 1981 skyrocketed the focus on the club, when celebrity photographer Guy D&#x27;Alema captured an image of Anita Bryant dancing the night away with evangelist Russ McGraw, known in gay communities as an activist. Several hundred newspapers and magazines ran the photo with the headline “Anita Upset Over Disco Photo”.

Peter Gatien relished the publicity. The club hosted many &quot;Interview Magazine&quot; events that brought names like Andy Warhol, Grace Jones, Debbie Harry, Burt Reynolds, Ali MacGraw, and Village People&#x27;s Randy Jones, among others to the club. Other celebrity sightings included Tom Cruise, Liza Minnelli, Michael Jackson, Pia Zadora, Shannon Tweed, Gene Simmons, Rick Springfield and Mamie Van Doren, to name but a few. The club also served as a location for Hal Ashby&#x27;s film &quot;The Slugger&#x27;s Wife&quot; (1985), which starred Rebecca De Mornay.

In 1983, when Gatien relocated to New York to open another Limelight club, his brother Maurice managed the Atlanta club. Maurice reportedly had less talent for running a nightclub than Gatien. &quot;Peter was the brains behind the operation,&quot; according to house photographer and publicist Guy D&#x27;Alema. &quot;Maurice ... didn&#x27;t want to spend a dime and didn&#x27;t have a creative bone in his body.&quot; The Atlanta club was located next to a 24-hour Kroger grocery store, which became known widely as &quot;Disco Kroger.&quot;

In July 2010, several former Limelight employees – including Randy Easterling, Jim Redford, Noel Aguirre, and Aron Siegel – along with a few of their regular customer dancers – including Jonathan Spanier and Bret Roberts – produced &quot;One More Night at the Limelight&quot;, a 30th Anniversary Party, at The Buckhead Theatre, formerly The Roxy Theatre. Due to the party&#x27;s success and great attendance, combined with the untimely death of one of its organizers (Spanier), the remaining team produced another party, &quot;Limelight Revisited: Déjà vu Discotheque&quot;, on August 6, 2011, at Center Stage Atlanta in midtown Atlanta.

===Chicago location===
The Limelight in Chicago was housed in the former home of the Chicago Historical Society; the building itself is a historic structure. It was opened in 1985, and became Excalibur nightclub in 1989. The steps to the entrance led to a hallway lined with museum cases that housed carnival like models dancing and generally moving about. There were several levels to the club. The main dance floor had a stage for the DJ. There were several private rooms that often played host to a bevy of celebrities both in music and in sports. The alternative music scene was critical at the Limelight as it played late into the 5 a.m. hour in Chicago on Saturday nights.

===London location===
From 1985, the Limelight in London was located in a former Welsh Presbyterian church on Shaftesbury Avenue, just off Cambridge Circus, which dates from the 1890s. The London club&#x27;s decline in popularity led to the club being sold as a going concern, eventually being taken over in 2003 by Australian pub chain The Walkabout, which converted it into a sports bar. In 2013 the Walkabout eventually ceased trading and the premises is empty and awaiting conversion to a new performing arts use by the charity Stone Nest.

===New York City location===

==== Beginning ====
The club in New York City, situated on Sixth Avenue at West 20th Street, was the most significant and infamous of all the Limelight locations. It opened in November 1983 and was designed by Ari Bahat. The site is the former Episcopal Church of the Holy Communion. The church was a Gothic Revival brownstone building that was built in 1844-45 and designed by architect Richard Upjohn. In the early 1970s, when the parish merged with two others, the church was deconsecrated and sold to Odyssey House, a drug rehabilitation program. Amidst financial hardship, Odyssey House sold it to Gatien in 1982.

Gatien was deeply interested in art and architecture, so he thought the church would be perfect as a club. He spent close to $5 million on renovations. The ceilings stretched four stories over the main dance floor. There were five staircases from the main chamber going to numerous lounges that hosted a different crowd in each room, cloves, VIP rooms, and the chapel area where experimental parties would be thrown to test out the popularity of such events.

The New York Limelight originally started as a disco and rock club. In the 1990s, it became a prominent place to hear techno, goth, and industrial music. The club was attractive to the people of NYC because it was inclusive. Goths, drag queens, rockers, leather boys, and socialites could all be seen partying with each other in one night. There were approximately 15,000 people showing up to the Limelight per night. During this time, Gatien was named the Club King.

==== Trial ====
In October 1995, the club was raided by the New York Police Department. They were only able to make three small arrests of marijuana dealers because Gatien had been tipped off. The Limelight was temporarily locked up for a week after Gatien paid a $30,000 fine and posted a $160,000 bond. In 1996, club kid and party promoter Michael Alig was arrested and later convicted for the killing and dismemberment of Angel Melendez, a fellow member of the Club Kids and a drug dealer who frequented the club.

The Limelight was closed by the police, and reopened several times during the 1990s. In 1998, Gatien was put on trial for selling drugs within his chain of clubs. His lawyer Ben Brafman claimed that the 80-page affidavit used to arrest Gatien contained no proof that directly linked him to drug distribution at the clubs. He argued that it was &quot;selective prosecution&quot;, due to the fact that Gatien ran such a huge operation, he could not be held individually or personally responsible for isolated pockets of drug dealing.

==== End ====
Assistant U.S. Attorney Eric Friendberg called the Limelight &quot;a drug supermarket&quot; where &quot;massive amounts&quot; of ecstasy as well as cocaine, special K, and rohypnol were used as &quot;promotional tools to lure patrons to the club.&quot; In the end, the government agreed on not accusing Gatien of personally selling drugs or profiting from the dealers operating in his clubs. They argued that he allowed drug dealers into his venues to advertise and increase popularity, therefore pleading him not guilty.

In September 2003, it reopened under the name Avalon. It closed its doors permanently in 2010. Since May 2010, the building has been in use as the Limelight Marketplace. In 2014, it was converted into an outlet of the David Barton Gym chain. In December 2016, this location as well as all four other David Barton Gym locations in New York City abruptly closed their doors for business. In June 2017, it reopened as Limelight Fitness. In 2015, a portion of the Limelight was taken over by Jue Lan Club, a Chinese restaurant and lounge. Over the years, Jue Lan Club venue has been accused of causing disorderly conduct.

==2011 documentary==
In April 2011, Rakontur released &quot;Limelight&quot; at the Tribeca Film Festival. The documentary&#x27;s world rights were bought by Magnolia Pictures. The documentary, which highlights the club&#x27;s history during the Gatien era, was produced by Gatien&#x27;s daughter, Jen, and directed by Billy Corben.

<text>The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation was formed in November 2001, following the September 11 attacks, to plan the reconstruction of Lower Manhattan and distribute nearly $10 billion in federal funds aimed at rebuilding downtown Manhattan. It is a subsidiary of the Empire State Development Corporation, which is a New York state public-benefit corporation.

==History==
The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation was formed in November 2001 by then-Governor George Pataki and then-Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. The LMDC is a joint State-City corporation governed by a 16-member Board of Directors, half appointed by the Governor of New York and half by the Mayor of New York. As a result, Pataki and Giuliani appointees dominate the LMDC. Its original chairman was John C. Whitehead, a former Deputy Secretary of State and head of Goldman Sachs. One of its first projects was the granting of more than $40 million for parks and green space.

In February 2003, the LMDC chose Daniel Libeskind&#x27;s master plan for the reconstruction of the World Trade Center complex. The organization also sponsored the international design competition for the World Trade Center Memorial, which resulted in Michael Arad and Peter Walker&#x27;s &quot;Reflecting Absence&quot; being chosen as the winning design in January 2004.

Having distributed its funds, the LMDC in July 2006 announced plans to dissolve and transfer its responsibilities to other existing agencies and foundations, including the W.T.C. Memorial Foundation, and the Lower Manhattan Construction Command Center. However a settlement following the fire at the Deutsche Bank Building allowed them funding for future projects including the West Thames Street pedestrian bridge.

In 2023, LMDC announced plans for the final wind down in early 2024 after years of discussion and staff cuts. It will remain in existence as a conduit for grants, however, including for the PAC NYC, and waterfront rehabilitation efforts.

==Organization structure==
LMDC does not own the World Trade Center site although it partners with the Port Authority on some elements of development.

===Funding===
The LMDC was funded through the disbursement of Community Development Block Grants-amounting to $2.783 billion—approved by the federal government in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks and resultant destruction of much of lower Manhattan&#x27;s economic and structural base. It was not listed in the New York State Authorities Budget Office&#x27;s 2018 annual report, but remains in operation as of 2019 as plans for the future 5 World Trade Center continued to develop.

==Criticism==
Two members of the LMDC&#x27;s board have asserted that up to $45 million allocated to the LMDC from a &quot;community enhancement&quot; fund in May 2005 has not been directly accounted for, and that up to $15 million from that stipend might have been spent in areas other than those it had been explicitly stipulated for.

Former Attorney General Democrat Eliot Spitzer became governor in 2007, rethought his condemnation, and announced a &quot;reinvigorated LMDC&quot; that would continue the revitalization of Lower Manhattan. Mayor Bloomberg welcomed the Governor&#x27;s renewed interest at the time. However, in September 2008, Mayor Bloomberg condemned the LMDC as a contributor to a slower progress in rebuilding and he demanded dissolution of the LMDC.

<doc id="378212" wikidata="Q20725526" url="?curid=378212" title="Obverse and reverse">
<text>The obverse and reverse are the two flat faces of coins and some other two-sided objects, including paper money, flags, seals, medals, drawings, old master prints and other works of art, and printed fabrics. In this usage, &quot;obverse&quot; means the front face of the object and &quot;reverse&quot; means the back face. The obverse of a coin is commonly called &quot;heads&quot;, because it often depicts the head of a prominent person, and the reverse &quot;tails&quot;.

In numismatics, the abbreviation &quot;obv.&quot; is used for &quot;obverse&quot;, while , )( and &quot;rev.&quot; are used for &quot;reverse&quot;. Vexillologists use the symbols &quot;normal&quot; for the obverse and &quot;reverse&quot; for the reverse. The &quot;two-sided&quot; , &quot;mirror&quot; , and &quot;equal&quot; symbols are further used to describe the relationship between the obverse and reverse sides of a flag.

In fields of scholarship outside numismatics, the term &quot;front&quot; is more commonly used than &quot;obverse&quot;, while usage of &quot;reverse&quot; is widespread.

The equivalent terms used in codicology, manuscript studies, print studies and publishing are &quot;recto&quot; and &quot;verso&quot;.

==Identification==
Generally, the side of a coin with the larger-scale image will be called the obverse (especially if the image is a single head) and, if that does not serve to distinguish them, the side that is more typical of a wide range of coins from that location will be called the obverse. Following this principle, in the most famous of ancient Greek coins, the tetradrachm of Athens, the obverse is the head of Athena and the reverse is her owl. Similar versions of these two images, both symbols of the state, were used on the Athenian coins for more than two centuries.

In the many republics of ancient Greece, such as Athens or Corinth, one side of their coins would have a symbol of the state, usually their patron goddess or her symbol, which remained constant through all of the coins minted by that state, which is regarded as the obverse of those coins. The opposite side may have varied from time to time. In ancient Greek monarchical coinage, the situation continued whereby a larger image of a deity, is called the obverse, but a smaller image of a monarch appears on the other side which is called the reverse.
In a Western monarchy, it has been customary, following the tradition of the Hellenistic monarchs and then the Roman emperors, for the currency to bear the head of the monarch on one side, which is almost always regarded as the obverse. This change happened in the coinage of Alexander the Great, which continued to be minted long after his death. After his conquest of ancient Egypt, he allowed himself to be depicted on the obverse of coins as a god-king, at least partly because he thought this would help secure the allegiance of the Egyptians, who had regarded their previous monarchs, the pharaohs, as divine. The various Hellenistic rulers who were his successors followed his tradition and kept their images on the obverse of coins.
A movement back to the earlier tradition of a deity being placed on the obverse occurred in Byzantine coinage, where a head of Christ became the obverse and a head or portrait (half or full-length) of the emperor became considered the reverse. The introduction of this style in the gold coins of Justinian II from the year 695 provoked the Islamic Caliph, Abd al-Malik, who previously had copied Byzantine designs, replacing Christian symbols with Islamic equivalents, finally to develop a distinctive &quot;Islamic style&quot;, with just lettering on both sides of their coins. This script alone style then was used on nearly all Islamic coinage until the modern period. The type of Justinian II was revived after the end of the Byzantine Iconoclasm, and with variations remained the norm until the end of the Empire. Without images, therefore, it is not always easy to tell which side will be regarded as the obverse without some knowledge.

After 695, Islamic coins avoided all images of persons and usually contained script alone. The side expressing the Six Kalimas (the Islamic profession of faith) is usually defined as the obverse.

A convention exists typically to display the obverse to the left (or above) and the reverse to the right (or below) in photographs and museum displays, but this is not invariably observed.

==Modern coins==
The form of currency follows its function, which is to serve as a readily accepted medium of exchange of value. Normally, this function rests on a state as guarantor of the value: either as &quot;trustworthy&quot; guarantor of the kind and amount of metal in a coin, or as &quot;powerful&quot; guarantor of the continuing acceptance of token coins.

Traditionally, most states have been monarchies where the person of the monarch and the state were equivalent for most purposes. For this reason, the &quot;obverse&quot; side of a modern piece of currency is the one that evokes that reaction by invoking the strength of the state, and that side almost always depicts a symbol of the state, whether it be the monarch or otherwise.

If not provided for on the obverse, the reverse side usually contains information relating to a coin&#x27;s role as a medium of exchange (such as the value of the coin). Additional space typically reflects the issuing country&#x27;s culture or government, or evokes some aspect of the state&#x27;s territory.

==Specific currencies==

===Coins of the Eurozone===

Regarding the euro, some confusion regarding the obverse and reverse of the euro coins exists. Officially, as agreed by the informal Economic and Finance Ministers Council of Verona in April 1996, and despite the fact that a number of countries have a different design for each coin, the distinctive national side for the circulation coins is the &quot;obverse&quot; and the common European side (which includes the coin value) is the &quot;reverse&quot;. This rule does not apply to the collector coins as they do not have a common side.

A number of the designs used for obverse national sides of euro coins were taken from the reverse of the nations&#x27; former pre-euro coins. Several countries (such as Spain and Belgium) continue to use portraits of the reigning monarch, while the Republic of Ireland continues to use the State Arms, as on its earlier issues.

===Coins of Japan===

In Japan, from 1897 to the end of World War II, the following informal conventions existed:
*the Chrysanthemum Throne (or Chrysanthemum Crest), representing the imperial family, appeared on all coins, and this side was regarded as the obverse;
*the other side, on which the date appeared, was regarded as the reverse.

The Chrysanthemum Crest was no longer used after the war, and so (equally informally):
*the side on which the date appears continues to be regarded as the reverse;
*the side without the date is regarded as the obverse.

===Coins of the United Kingdom===

Following ancient tradition, the obverse of coins of the United Kingdom (and predecessor kingdoms going back to the Middle Ages) almost always feature the head of the monarch.

By tradition, each British monarch faces in the opposite direction of his or her predecessor; this is said to date from 1661, with Charles II turning his back on Oliver Cromwell. Hence, George VI faced left and Elizabeth II faced right. The only break in this tradition almost occurred in 1936 when Edward VIII, believing his left side to be superior to his right (to show the parting in his hair), insisted on his image facing left, as his father&#x27;s image had. No official legislation prevented his wishes being granted, so left-facing obverses were prepared for minting. Very few examples were struck before he abdicated later that year, and none bearing this portrait were ever issued officially. When George VI acceded to the throne, his image was placed to face left, implying that, had any coins been minted with Edward&#x27;s portrait the obverses would have depicted Edward facing right and maintained the tradition.

Current UK coinage features the following abbreviated Latin inscription: (&#x27;By the Grace of God King, Defender of the Faith&#x27;). Earlier issues, before 1954, included (&#x27;of all the Britains&#x27;that is, Britain and its dominions) and, before 1949, (&#x27;Emperor of India&#x27;).

===Coins of the United States===
The United States specifies what appears on the obverse and reverse of its currency. The specifications mentioned here imply the use of all upper-case letters, although they appear here in upper and lower case letters for the legibility of the article.
The United States government long adhered to including all of the following:
*Obverse:
**&quot;Liberty&quot;
**&quot;In God We Trust&quot;
** The four digits of a year, that of minting or issue
*Reverse:
**&quot;United States of America&quot;
**&quot;E Pluribus Unum&quot;
**Words (not digits) expressing the name or assigned value of the item, e.g., &quot;quarter dollar&quot;, &quot;one dime&quot;, &quot;five cents&quot;

The ten-year series of Statehood quarters, whose issue began in 1999, was seen as calling for more space and more flexibility in the design of the reverse. A law specific to this series and the corresponding time period permits the following:
*Obverse:
**as before:
***&quot;Liberty&quot;
***&quot;In God We Trust&quot;
**instead of on the reverse:
***&quot;United States of America&quot;
***The words expressing the assigned value of the coin, &quot;quarter dollar&quot;
*Reverse:
**as before:
***&quot;E Pluribus Unum&quot;
**instead of on the obverse:
***The four digits of the year of issue

==Vexillology==
In vexillology, the obverse of a flag is the side taken as the default illustration of a flag, for example the side used to display a design in a book or other paper document. The obverse is usually assumed to be the side visible when the &quot;hoist&quot;, the edge attached to the mast, is on the viewer&#x27;s left and the opposite &quot;fly&quot; side to their right, while the reverse is the side visible with the hoist on the right and the fly on the left. Most flags reversed feature a mirror copy of the obverse, a format accommodated by most flag manufacturers.

The flag of Saudi Arabia is an exception to both conventions, with a right-hoisted (&quot;sinister&quot; ) obverse and an equal reverse to correctly arrange the calligraphic &quot;Shahada&quot; on both sides. Truly two-sided flags include the flag of Paraguay and the flag of Oregon, but are otherwise rare in the modern day.

Some national flag protocols include provisions for when and how the reverse should be displayed. The United States flag code states that a vertically hung flag should be displayed with the reverse side out, such that the blue canton, or &quot;union&quot;, be visible in the same position as it would be if the flag was being displayed horizontally on the obverse. Displaying the flag in a window requires the reverse be visible from the exterior and the obverse from the interior.

<doc id="378213" wikidata="Q551823" url="?curid=378213" title="Scanners">
<text>Scanners is a 1981 Canadian science fiction horror film written and directed by David Cronenberg and starring Stephen Lack, Jennifer O&#x27;Neill, Michael Ironside, and Patrick McGoohan. In the film, &quot;scanners&quot; are psychics with unusual telepathic and telekinetic powers. ConSec, a purveyor of weaponry and security systems, searches out scanners to use them for its own purposes. The film&#x27;s plot concerns the attempt by Darryl Revok (Ironside), a renegade scanner, to wage a war against ConSec. Another scanner, Cameron Vale (Lack), is dispatched by ConSec to stop Revok.

&quot;Scanners&quot; premiered in January 1981 to lukewarm reviews from critics but became one of the first films produced in Canada to successfully compete with American films at the international box office. It brought Cronenberg and his controversial style of body horror attention to mainstream film audiences for the first time and has since been reevaluated as a cult classic. It is particularly well known for a scene that depicts Revok psychically causing a rival scanner&#x27;s head to graphically explode.

==Plot==
Cameron Vale is a vagrant suffering from voices manifesting in his head. After involuntarily causing a woman to have a seizure with his telepathy, Vale is captured by the private military company ConSec and brought to Dr. Paul Ruth.

Ruth explains that Vale is one of 237 super-powered individuals known as &quot;scanners&quot; capable of telepathy, empathy, , and psychokinesis. Ruth injects Vale with a drug called &quot;ephemerol&quot;, which restores his sanity by temporarily inhibiting his scanning abilities, and teaches him to control them. ConSec is recruiting scanners to stop a malevolent underground ring of scanners led by Darryl Revok, a former mental patient who was driven mad from hearing uncontrollable streams of thoughts.

Revok, on his quest to kill opposing scanners, infiltrates a ConSec marketing event and explodes the head of a ConSec scanner. ConSec security head Braedon Keller advocates shutting down their scanner research program but Ruth disagrees, believing the scanners are the next stage of human evolution, and argues that the assassination demonstrates Revok&#x27;s danger. Ruth brings in Vale and asks him to help infiltrate Revok&#x27;s group.

Unknown to Ruth, Keller is working for Revok and informs him of Ruth&#x27;s infiltration plan. Revok dispatches assassins to follow Vale as he visits an unaffiliated scanner named Benjamin Pierce, a successful yet reclusive sculptor who copes with his abilities through his art. Revok&#x27;s assassins murder Pierce, but Vale reads Pierce&#x27;s dying brain and learns of a group of scanners, led by Kim Obrist, who oppose Revok&#x27;s group. Vale tracks down Obrist and attends a meeting, but Revok&#x27;s assassins strike again; only Vale and Obrist survive.

Vale learns of a pharmaceutical company, Biocarbon Amalgamate, which he soon discovers Revok is using to distribute large quantities of ephemerol under a ConSec computer program called &quot;Ripe&quot;. Vale and Obrist return to ConSec to investigate, and Ruth admits that he founded Biocarbon Amalgamate and suggests Vale cyberpathically scan the computer system to learn more. Keller attacks Obrist and kills Ruth while Vale and Obrist flee the ConSec building. Vale cyberpathically hacks into the computer network through a telephone booth and downloads ephemerol shipment information directly into his mind. Keller is killed when the computer explodes during his attempt to intercept Vale. Vale and Obrist visit a doctor on the list of ephemerol recipients and discover that it is prescribed to pregnant women, turning their children into scanners. Revok&#x27;s group captures Vale and Obrist and take them to the Biocarbon Amalgamate plant.

Revok reveals to Vale that they are both children of Ruth, who developed ephemerol as a sedative for pregnant women. Ruth learned about the drug&#x27;s side-effect during his wife&#x27;s pregnancies, and he made them the most powerful scanners in the world by administering a prototype dosage prior to abandoning them. Revok plans to create and lead a new generation of scanners to take over the world, but Vale refuses to join him. Vale accuses Revok of acting like his father, enraging him. The brothers engage in a telepathic duel, which incinerates Vale&#x27;s body. However, when Obrist encounters Revok, she discovers that Vale somehow has managed to take over Revok&#x27;s body during the duel.

==Cast==

William Hope, Christopher Britton, and Leon Herbert have uncredited appearances as Bicarbon Amalgamate employees. Neil Affleck has a minor role as a medical student.

==Production==
===Financing===
Scanners was based on David Cronenberg&#x27;s scripts &quot;The Sensitives&quot; and &quot;Telepathy 2000&quot;, which he planned to pitch to Roger Corman before beginning work on &quot;The Brood&quot;. Corman was shown the script, but did nothing with it. Cronenberg has called &quot;Scanners&quot; one of his most difficult films to make; most Canadian film productions of the 1970s and the early 1980s were funded through a 100-percent Capital Cost Allowance tax shield for investors passed by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau in 1974, and the film was rushed into production without a finished script or constructed sets to claim the subsidies.

Victor Snolicki, Dick Schouten, and Pierre David of Vision 4, a company taking advantage of Canada&#x27;s tax shelter policies, aided Cronenberg in the film&#x27;s financing. Vision 4 dissolved after Schouten&#x27;s death and reorganized into Filmplan International.

===Filming===
The film&#x27;s first draft was not a script, but instead a series of ideas. The film was given two weeks of pre-production while a script was not written yet. According to Cronenberg, he would spend mornings prior to filming writing scenes. The film was initially titled &quot;The Sensitives&quot;, but it was altered as Cronenberg felt &quot;it was too wimpy&quot; while &quot;Scanners&quot; &quot;was very strong&quot;. Cronenberg stated that the drug aspect of the film might have been influenced by &quot;Blue Sunshine&quot;. Star Jennifer O&#x27;Neill was given a script with all of the violence edited out and cried after seeing the uncensored script.

The film was shot in Montreal from October 30 to December 23, 1979, on a budget of $4,100,000 (). Cronenberg stated that &quot;the first day was the most disastrous shooting day I&#x27;ve ever had&quot; as &quot;there was nothing to shoot&quot; and a distracted truck driver watching the film crew hit a car killing two women inside it.

The lecture scene was filmed at Concordia University, and the Charles J. Des Baillets Water Treatment Plant doubled as the &#x27;Bicarbon Amalgamate&#x27; compound. The &quot;Future Electronique&quot; building in Vaudreuil-Dorion provided the exterior of &#x27;ConSec&#x27; headquarters. The sequence of Revok (Michael Ironside) hijacking a car and causing another to crash were shot on Rue de la Commune. Additional scenes were filmed in the Yorkville neighborhood. However, since the United States dominated the film industry and Canadian films were being marketed for international audiences, the film downplays its Canadian origin in favor of a generic &quot;North American&quot; setting. The only indicators of its location are a scene of Revok and Keller meeting at the Yorkdale station of the Toronto subway and some visible bilingual signs.

Cronenberg stated that &quot;&quot;Scanners&quot; had the longest post-production of any film I&#x27;ve ever done&quot; due to its nine months of editing and reshoots.

===Effects===
Make-up artist Dick Smith (&quot;The Exorcist&quot;, &quot;Amadeus&quot;) provided prosthetics for the climactic scanner duel and the iconic exploding head effect. Chris Walas, working at Lucasfilm at the time and later providing effects work for &quot;The Fly&quot; and &quot;Naked Lunch&quot;, also worked on the exploding head effect. Cronenberg later said in 2006 that &quot;Scanners&quot; was his most difficult film to shoot due to its special effects and complex story.

The iconic head explosion scene was produced by trial and error, with the producers eventually deciding on a gelatin-encassed plaster skull packed with &quot;leftover burgers&quot; as well as &quot;latex scraps, some wax, and just bits and bobs and a lot of stringy stuff that we figured would fly through the air a little better&quot;. When other explosive techniques failed to give the desired effect, special effects supervisor Gary Zeller told the crew to roll cameras and get inside their trucks with doors and windows closed; he then crouched down behind the dummy and shot it in the back of the head with a shotgun.

The exploding head scene was filmed four times, but Cronenberg accepted the first shot and did not remain to watch the three others, opting to instead take a nap in his Winnebago. The scene depicting the exploding head was trimmed down to allow for a R-rating from the MPAA. Cronenberg originally intended for the scene to be the film&#x27;s opening, but placed it later in the film after test screenings.

==Release==
The film was distributed by New World Pictures in Canada, Les Films Mutuels in Quebec, and Avco Embassy Pictures in the United States. &quot;Scanners&quot; was released in the United States on January 14, and in Canada on January 16, 1981. It grossed $2,758,147 from 387 theatres in its opening weekend. It grossed a total of $14,225,876 at the box office. Cronenberg stated that it was his first film to be number one at the box office.

A novelization by Leon Whiteson, &quot;David Cronenberg&#x27;s Scanners&quot;, was also released in 1981. The film was released on VHS in 1982.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 68% based on , with an average rating of 6.7/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Scanners&quot; is a dark sci-fi story with special effects that&#x27;ll make your head explode.&quot; On Metacritic it has a weighted average score of 60% based on reviews from 8 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.
Film professor Charles Derry, in his overview of the horror genre &quot;Dark Dreams&quot;, cited &quot;Scanners&quot; as &quot;an especially important masterwork&quot; and calling it the &quot;Psycho&quot; of its day. In a contemporary review for &quot;Ares Magazine&quot;, Christopher John commented that &quot;&quot;Scanners&quot; is top-notch entertainment. It is haunting, exciting, shocking and literate – an unusual combination to discover in a film these days.&quot;

Some reviews were less positive. Film critic Roger Ebert gave &quot;Scanners&quot; two out of four stars and wrote, &quot;Scanners&quot; is so lockstep that we are basically reduced to watching the special effects, which are good but curiously abstract, because we don&#x27;t much care about the people they&#x27;re happening around&quot;. In his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Vincent Canby wrote, &quot;Had Mr. Cronenberg settled simply for horror, as John Carpenter did in his classic &quot;Halloween&quot; (though not in his not-so-classic &quot;The Fog&quot;), &quot;Scanners&quot; might have been a Grand Guignol treat. Instead he insists on turning the film into a mystery, and mystery demands eventual explanations that, when they come in &quot;Scanners&quot;, underline the movie&#x27;s essential foolishness&quot;. John Simon of &quot;National Review&quot; described &quot;Scanners&quot; as trash.

A reassessment of &quot;Scanners&quot; in the 2012 issue of &quot;CineAction&quot; looks at the film in light of Cronenberg&#x27;s use of allegory and parables in much of his work. The argument is made that Cronenberg uses iconic imagery that refers directly and indirectly to the thirty-something Scanners as 1960s political radicals, counterculture hippies, and as nascent Young Urban Professionals. As a result, the film can be seen &quot;as an oblique reflection on what might happen when the counterculture becomes the dominant culture&quot;. Kim Newman noted in an essay for The Criterion Collection that at the same time the film rejects the conservative values of the 1980s and the nostalgia for the 1950s present in contemporary science-fiction films such as &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; and &quot;Back to the Future&quot;. The film&#x27;s fictional drug ephemerol also mirrors the real-life thalidomide scandal, in which the popular West German medication thalidomide caused severe birth defects in children born to mothers prescribed the drug for morning sickness in Western Europe and Canada.

===Accolades===
Although &quot;Scanners&quot; was not nominated for any major awards, it did receive some recognition. The Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy &amp; Horror Films gave the film its Saturn Award in 1981 for &quot;Best International Film&quot;, and, in addition, the &quot;Best Make-Up&quot; award went to Dick Smith in a tie with &quot;Altered States&quot;. The film had also been nominated for &quot;Best Special Effects&quot;.

&quot;Scanners&quot; also won &quot;Best International Fantasy Film&quot; from Fantasporto in 1983, and was nominated for eight Genie Awards in 1982, but did not win any.

== Soundtrack ==
Mondo released the Howard Shore score for &quot;Scanners&quot;, alongside &quot;The Brood&quot;, on vinyl; it features cover art by Sam Wolfe Conelly.

==Legacy==
&quot;Scanners&quot; spawned sequels and a series of spin-offs; a remake was announced in 2007, but had not gone into production. Cronenberg was not involved in the sequels as he was both uninterested and would not make money off the characters or story he wrote.

===Sequels===
* &quot;Scanners II: The New Order&quot; (1991)
* &quot;Scanners III: The Takeover&quot; (1992)

===Spin-offs===
* &quot;Scanner Cop&quot; (1994)
* &quot;&quot; (also known as &quot;Scanner Cop II)&quot; (1995)

===Canceled remake===
In February 2007, Darren Lynn Bousman (director of &quot;Saw II&quot;, &quot;Saw III&quot;, and &quot;Saw IV&quot;) was announced as director of a remake of the film, to be released by The Weinstein Company and Dimension Films. David S. Goyer was assigned to script the film. The film was planned for release on October 17, 2008, but the date came and went without further announcements and all of the parties involved have since moved on to other projects. In an interview with Bousman in 2013, he recalled that he would not make the film without Cronenberg&#x27;s approval, which was not granted.

===Television series===
Attempts to make a series include Dimension in 2011, Media Res and Bron Studios in 2017, and HBO, Media Res Studio, and Wayward Films in 2022.

<doc id="378214" wikidata="Q12258" url="?curid=378214" title="Sabadell">
<text>Sabadell () is a city and municipality in Catalonia, Spain. It is in the south of the &quot;comarca&quot; of Vallès Occidental, where it is one of the two capitals, the other being Terrassa. It is located on the River Ripoll, north of Barcelona, above sea level.

Sabadell pioneered the Industrial Revolution in Catalonia with its textile mills, together with its archrival Terrassa. Thus, in the mid-19th century, it became the most important wool city in Spain, being nicknamed the &quot;Catalan Manchester&quot;. Today many mills from that period can still be seen, with most of them having been refurbished as residential buildings or other services. Nowadays, Sabadell is basically a commercial and industrial city; there are no significant agricultural activities.

Sabadell is an important communications point. Two motorways run beside the city: the C-58 (from Barcelona to Manresa) and the AP-7 (from France and Girona to Tarragona, Valencia, and Andalusia), and some roads link Sabadell with nearby cities and towns: Barcelona, Terrassa, Cerdanyola del Vallès, Sant Quirze del Vallès, Barberà del Vallès, Sant Cugat del Vallès, Castellar del Vallès, Sant Llorenç Savall, Granollers, Rubí, Sentmenat, and Molins de Rei.

A railroad line crosses the city (the Rodalies Barcelona line from Barcelona to Lleida) and another one terminates in the city (the FGC line from Barcelona to Sabadell via Sant Cugat del Vallès).

==History==
In Roman times, a little village called &quot;Arragone&quot; existed near where the church of La Salut now stands. This grew into the town called &quot;Arraona&quot; or &quot;Arrahona&quot; in the Middle Ages. Another little village was built just on the other side of the river. This second village, called Sabadell, located on a plain, began to grow and its population was about 600 people (152 houses) in 1378. Sabadell was enclosed by a wall, but due to population growth in the 16th century, some houses were built outside the wall. At that time the first textile industries appeared in the town, devoted especially to woolen clothing. The woolen industry grew over the next centuries, and in 1800 the town&#x27;s population was about 2000 people.

The 19th century brought two important developments to the town: in 1856 the railway arrived, and in 1877 the town was dubbed a &quot;city&quot;. In the 1897 census the population of the city was 23,044 people. The city had become the most important producer of woolen clothing in Spain, and these clothes achieved worldwide fame.

The &quot;modernisme&quot; movement (related to Art Nouveau) had an important influence in the architecture of the city in the early 20th century and distinctive buildings such as the &quot;modernista&quot; Hotel Suís (1902), Despatx Lluch (1908), and the Caixa d&#x27;Estalvis de Sabadell (1915), as well as the Torre de l&#x27;Aigua (1918) and the Mercat Central (1930), were built during the first half of the century.

In the early 20th century, Sabadell, with Terrassa, was the textile city par excellence, being the driving force of a territory poor in natural resources. The population was multiplied by eight, its industry boosted, particularly textiles and metals, and its economy was modernized in the service sector. Due to this industrial activity, Sabadell received massive waves of immigration in the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s leading to uncontrolled urban expansion and the creation of some new neighborhoods such as Ca n&#x27;Oriac and Torre-Romeu.

There has always been since those days a rivalry between Terrassa and Sabadell, because both of them wanted to be capitals of the Vallés Occidental, as both were pretty relevant while this rise textile industry. Nowadays, still there are some popular sayings: &quot;Sabadell mala pell&quot; (Sabadell bad skin) and &quot;Terrassa mala raça&quot; (Terrassa bad race).

The growth of industry and population favored the emergence of an important workers&#x27; movement, and Catalanist, socialist and anarchist parties were very influential up until the upheavals of the Spanish Civil War (1936–39). The victory of the Fascist faction in the war was a step backwards for the city, but in the fifties industry recovered and grew once more. Industries needed workers, and many people came from Andalusia, Murcia, Extremadura, Castile and other parts of Spain to work in the textile and the metal industry. Again, a new workers&#x27; and Catalanist movement emerged, this time against Francisco Franco&#x27;s regime and with the support of the Roman Catholic Church.

Sabadell was the host of some sessions of the Assemblea de Catalunya, a multi-party organization that brought together communists, socialists, Catalan nationalists, Catholics and others against the Franco regime. The 1973 oil crisis and Franco&#x27;s death in 1975 meant an important change in Spain and, of course, in Sabadell. The economic crisis compelled the city to diversify its economic activities. New commercial and leisure areas (the &quot;Eix Macià&quot;) appeared next to the traditional industries, leading to important economic development for the city. An ETA car bombing in 1990 killed six police officers.

<doc id="378229" wikidata="Q1261225" url="?curid=378229" title="Eugene Kleiner">
<text>Eugene Kleiner (12 May 1923 – 20 November 2003) was an Austrian-American engineer and venture capitalist. He is considered a pioneer of Silicon Valley. He was one of the original founders of Fairchild Semiconductor, part of the Traitorous Eight, and Kleiner Perkins, the Silicon Valley venture capital firm which later became Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers. The company was an early investor in more than 300 information technology and biotech firms, including Amazon.com, AOL, Brio Technology, Electronic Arts, Flextronics, Genentech, Google, Hybritech, Intuit, Lotus Development, LSI Logic, Macromedia, Netscape, Quantum, Segway, Sun Microsystems and Tandem Computers.

==Early life and education==
Kleiner was born on May 12, 1923, in Vienna, Austria. In 1938, he fled Nazi persecution of Jews with his family, arriving in New York two years later. He served in the U.S. Army, then earned a Bachelor&#x27;s degree in mechanical engineering from the Polytechnic University of New York in 1948 and a Master&#x27;s degree in industrial engineering from New York University.

==Career==
After briefly teaching engineering, he joined Western Electric, the manufacturing arm of AT&amp;T Corporation.

In 1956, he was among the first to accept an offer from William Shockley to come to California to help form what became Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory. In 1957, he and seven colleagues (the &quot;Fairchild eight&quot;, whom Shockley dubbed the &quot;traitorous eight&quot;) left the laboratory to found Fairchild Semiconductor, which most historians mark as the first major spin-off of what later was called Silicon Valley. According to fellow venture capitalist Arthur Rock, Kleiner led the eight, obtaining a $1.5 million investment from Sherman Fairchild and taking over the new firm&#x27;s administrative duties.

Kleiner later invested his own money in Intel, a semiconductor firm founded in 1968 by fellow Fairchild founders Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore.

In 1972, he joined Hewlett-Packard veteran Tom Perkins to found Kleiner Perkins, the venture capital firm now headquartered on Sand Hill Road. In 1977, the company added Brook Byers and Frank J. Caufield as named partners. He retired from day-to-day responsibilities in the early 1980s.

==Personal life==

In 1947, he married Rose Wassertheil (d. 2001), a Polish Jewish émigrée. They had two children, Robert and Lisa. He died on November 20, 2003, in Los Altos Hills, California.

==Kleiner&#x27;s laws==
* Make sure the dog wants to eat the dog food. No matter how ground-breaking a new technology, how large a potential market, make certain customers actually want it.
* Build one business at a time. Most business plans are overly ambitious. Concentrate on being successful in one endeavor first.
* Risk up front, out early.
* The time to take the tarts is when they&#x27;re being passed.
* The problem with most companies is they don&#x27;t know what business they&#x27;re in.
* Even turkeys can fly in a high wind. In times of strong economies, even bad companies can look good.
* It&#x27;s easier to get a piece of an existing market than to create a new one.
* It&#x27;s difficult to see the picture when you&#x27;re inside the frame.
* After learning some of the tricks of the trade, some people think they know the trade.
* Venture capitalists will stop at nothing to copy success.
* Invest in people, not just products.
* When the money is available, take it.
* There is a time when panic is the appropriate response.
* The more difficult the decision, the less it matters what you choose.

<text>Edmund Ignatius Rice, F.P.M., C.F.C. (; 1 June 1762 – 29 August 1844) was a Catholic missionary and educationalist who founded two institutes of religious brothers: the Congregation of Christian Brothers and the Presentation Brothers.

Rice was born in Ireland at a time when Catholics faced oppression under Penal Laws enforced by the British authorities, though reforms began in 1778 when he was a teenager. He forged a successful career in business and, after an accident that killed his wife and left his daughter disabled and with learning difficulties, thereafter devoted his life to the education of the poor.

Christian Brothers and Presentation Brothers schools around the world continue to follow the traditions established by Rice (see List of Christian Brothers schools).
==Early life and education==
Edmund Ignatius Rice was born to Robert Rice and Margaret Rice (née Tierney) on the farming property of &quot;Westcourt&quot;, in Callan, County Kilkenny. Edmund Rice was the fourth of seven sons, although he also had two half-sisters, Joan and Jane Murphy, the offspring of his mother&#x27;s first marriage.

Rice&#x27;s education, like that of every other Irish Catholic of the day, was greatly compromised by the 1709 amendment to the Popery Act, which decreed that any public or private instruction in the Catholic faith would render teachers liable to prosecution, a measure that was not reformed until 1782. In this environment, hedge schools proliferated. The boys of the Rice family obtained education at home through Patrick Grace, a member of the small community of Augustinian friars in Callan. As a young man, Rice spent two years at a school which, despite the provisions of the penal laws, the authorities suffered to exist in the City of Kilkenny.

His uncle Michael owned a merchant business in the nearby port town of Waterford. In 1779 Edmund was apprenticed to him, moving into a house in the market parish of Ballybricken, entering the business of trading livestock and other supplies, and supervising the loading of victuals onto ships bound for the British colonies. Michael Rice died in 1785, and this business passed to Edmund. He was an active member of a society established in the city for the relief of the poor. His favourite charity was the Sick and Indigent Roomkeepers’ Association whose members visited the sick poor in their homes. He was also introduced to Jesuit spirituality when he joined the &quot;Waterford group&quot; of young men who met for prayer and reading at the &quot;Little Chapel&quot;, now St Patrick&#x27;s Catholic Church in Jenkin&#x27;s Lane.
In about 1785 he married a young woman (perhaps Mary Elliott, the daughter of a Waterford tanner). &quot;Little is known about their married life, and Mary died in January 1789 following an accident, possibly by a fever that set in afterwards. Mary was pregnant at the time, and a daughter was born on her deathbed.&quot; The daughter (also named Mary) was born handicapped. Edmund Rice was left a widower, with an infant daughter in delicate health.

==Vocation and beginnings==
Following his wife&#x27;s death, he began discerning a vocation to join a monastery, perhaps in France. One day, while discussing his vocation with the sister of Thomas Hussey, the Bishop of Waterford, a band of ragged boys passed by. Pointing to them, she cried:&quot;What! Would you bury yourself in a cell on the continent rather than devote your wealth and your life to the spiritual and material interest of these poor youths?&quot;After settling his business affairs in 1802, Rice devoted his life to prayer and charitable work, particularly with the poor and marginalised of Waterford. In 1802, when he established a makeshift school in a converted stable in New Street, Waterford, he found the children were so difficult to manage that the teachers resigned. This prompted him to sell his thriving business to another prominent Catholic merchant, a Mr Quan, and devote himself to training teachers who would dedicate their lives to prayers and to teaching the children free of charge. Despite the difficulties involved, Edmund&#x27;s classes were so popular that another temporary school had to be set up on another of his properties, this time in nearby Stephen Street.

The turning point of Rice&#x27;s ministry was the arrival of two young men, Thomas Grosvenor and Patrick Finn, from his hometown of Callan. They came to him with the desire to join a congregation, but had not decided which they would join. As it turned out, they remained to teach at Edmund Rice&#x27;s school and formed their own. The subsequent success of the New Street school led to a more permanent building, named &quot;Mount Sion&quot;, where construction began on 1 June 1802. The Mount Sion monastery was officially blessed by Bishop Hussey on 7 June 1803. Since the schoolhouse was not yet completed, Rice, Finn, and Grosvenor took up residence but walked each day from Mount Sion to their schools on New Street and Stephen Street. On 1 May 1804, the adjoining school was opened and blessed by Hussey&#x27;s successor, Bishop John Power, and their pupils transferred to the new building.

Thanks to the appeals of some of Rice&#x27;s more influential friends, a request made to the local Church of Ireland bishop for a school licence was eventually granted. By 1806 Christian schools were established in Waterford, Carrick-on-Suir, and Dungarvan.

==Foundation of the Christian Brothers and Presentation Brothers==
In 1808, seven of the staff including Edmund Rice took religious vows under the authority of Bishop Power of Waterford. Following the example of Nano Nagle&#x27;s Presentation Sisters, they were called Presentation Brothers. This was the first congregation of men to be founded in Ireland and one of the few ever founded by a layman. Gradually, a transformation took place amongst the &quot;quay kids&quot; of Waterford, largely attributed to Edmund and his brothers&#x27; work, who educated, clothed and fed the boys. Other bishops in Ireland supplied Edmund Rice with men, and these he prepared for the religious life and a life of teaching. In this way, the Presentation Brothers spread throughout Ireland.

However, the communities were under the bishop&#x27;s control in each diocese rather than Edmund Rice, which created problems when Brothers were needed to be transferred from one school to another. Rice sought approval from Pope Pius VII for the community to be made into a pontifical congregation with a Superior General. He obtained this in 1820. The Pope&#x27;s brief specified that the members were to be bound by vows of obedience, chastity, poverty and perseverance, and to give themselves to the free instruction, religious and literary, of male children, especially the poor. The heads of houses were to elect a Superior General; Rice held this office from 1822 to 1838, and he was then able to move brothers across diocesan boundaries to wherever they were most needed. During this time the institution extended to several English towns (especially in Lancashire), and the course of instruction grew out of the primary stage.

In the 1820s further difficulties emerged owing to the expansion of the society and its becoming two distinct congregations. From this time on they were called Christian Brothers and the Presentation Brothers. The motto of the Christian Brothers was: &quot;The Lord has given, and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord forever&quot; (Job 1: 21).

In 1828, the North Richmond Street house and schools in Dublin were established by Rice, the foundation stone being laid by the politician Daniel O&#x27;Connell. The building housed the Brothers&#x27; headquarters for many years and the present residence incorporates the original house built by Rice, who lived here for several years beginning in 1831.

==Later life and death==

In February 1838, Edmund Rice left the North Richmond Street community and returned to Mount Sion in Waterford. Aged seventy-six, and by now in poor health, he wrote to the different communities calling for a General Chapter to elect a new Superior General. The chapter, which opened on 24 July 1838, resulted in the election of Michael Paul Riordan as Rice&#x27;s successor.

From this time on, Edmund Rice spent an increasing proportion of his time at Mount Sion and the adjoining school, showing a continued interest in the pupils and their teachers. He would also take a short walk each day on the slope of Mount Sion, but his increasingly painful arthritis led the community superior, Joseph Murphy, to purchase a wheelchair for his benefit. At Christmas time, 1841, Rice&#x27;s health took a turn for the worse, and even though expectations of his imminent death did not turn out to be justified, he was increasingly confined to his room.

After living in a near-comatose state for more than two years (in the constant care of a nurse since May 1842), Rice died at 11 a.m. on 29 August 1844 at Mount Sion, Waterford, where his remains lie in a casket to this day. Large crowds filled the streets around his house in Dublin to honour him.

==Beatification and legacy==

The first attempt to introduce Rice&#x27;s cause to sainthood was in 1911 by Mark Hill who travelled Waterford and other parts of Ireland collecting statements from people as to why they thought Rice should be made a saint, but very little progress was made. The cause was taken up by Pius Noonan, who was the superior general at the time. With the help of Giovanni Battista Montini (the future Pope Paul VI), the cause was officially opened in Dublin in 1957.

In 1976, the Historical Commission of the Dublin Archdiocese recommended that Rice&#x27;s cause be brought to Rome, and the Holy See agreed to look into it. Three brothers had the burden of investigating archives and collecting evidence as to why Rice should be declared a saint: Mark Hill, David Fitzpatrick and Columba Normoyle.

As a result of these investigations and the examination in Rome of the results, on 2 April 1993, Pope John Paul II approved the pursuit of the Roman phase of the cause, declaring Edmund Rice to be venerable. 

Two years later, the same Pope approved a miracle attributed to Edmund Rice&#x27;s intercession. The miracle occurred in 1976, when Kevin Ellison of Newry, had been given only 48 hours to live due to complications from a gangrenous colon, and an apparent lack of viable colon tissue (a conclusion reached by five doctors after hours in surgery). A family friend, Christian Brother Laserian O&#x27;Donnell, gave Ellison&#x27;s parents a relic of Edmund Rice. Many friends prayed for a miracle through the intercession of Rice and a special Mass was offered for Ellison&#x27;s recovery. Only the relic of Edmund Rice was placed at the bedside of the dying man. The latter survived the 48-hour period during which he was supposed to die, and more besides. Upon investigation, surgeons discovered a considerable length of the previously undetected colon. Ellison fully recovered after a few weeks.

These events paved the way for Rice&#x27;s beatification on 6 October 1996 by Pope John Paul II. His feast day is 5 May.

A segment of his kneecap (in a reliquary) is on display in the new sports hall at St Joseph&#x27;s College, Stoke-on-Trent, &quot;part of the Edmund Rice family of schools, founded by the Christian Brothers and following the charism of Blessed Edmund Rice.&quot;

The Edmund Rice Centre is an Australian not-for-profit organisation established in 1996 that promotes human rights, social justice, and eco-justice, performing research, and using advocacy and community education to achieve its aims. It focuses especially on Indigenous Australians and other indigenous peoples, reconciliation in Australia, asylum seekers in Australia and elsewhere, and Pacific Islanders who are being affected by climate change.

<text>The University of Georgia (UGA or Georgia) is a public land-grant research university with its main campus in Athens, Georgia, United States. Chartered in 1785, it is the oldest public university in the United States. It is the flagship school of the University System of Georgia.

In addition to the main campuses in Athens with their approximately 470 buildings, the university has two smaller campuses located in Tifton and Griffin. The university has two satellite campuses located in Atlanta and Lawrenceville, and residential and educational centers in Washington, D.C., at Trinity College of Oxford University, and in Cortona, Italy. The total acreage of the university in 30 Georgia counties is .

The university is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;, and as having &quot;more selective&quot; undergraduate admissions. The University of Georgia&#x27;s intercollegiate sports teams, commonly known by their Georgia Bulldogs name, compete in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I and the Southeastern Conference (SEC). The university has had more alumni as Rhodes Scholars since 1990 than nearly all other public universities in the country. Alumni also include a United States Poet Laureate, Emmy Award winners, Grammy Award winners, and multiple Super Bowl champions.

== History ==
=== Antebellum history ===

In 1784, Lyman Hall, a Yale University graduate and one of three medical doctors to sign the Declaration of Independence, as Governor of Georgia persuaded the Georgia legislature to grant as an endowment for the purposes of founding a &quot;college or seminary of learning.&quot; Besides Hall, credit for founding the university goes to Abraham Baldwin who wrote the original charter for University of Georgia. Originally from Connecticut, Baldwin graduated from and later taught at Yale before moving to Georgia. The Georgia General Assembly approved Baldwin&#x27;s charter on January 27, 1785, and the University of Georgia became the first university in the United States to gain a state charter. Considered one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, Baldwin would later represent Georgia in the 1786 Constitutional Convention that created the Constitution of the United States and go on to be President pro tempore of the United States Senate. The task of creating the university was given to the Senatus Academicus, which consisted of the Board of Visitors – made up of &quot;the governor, all state senators, all superior court judges and a few other public officials&quot; – and the Board of Trustees, &quot;a body of 14 appointed members that soon became self-perpetuating.&quot; The first meeting of the university&#x27;s board of trustees was held in Augusta, Georgia, on February 13, 1786. The meeting installed Baldwin as the university&#x27;s first president.
For the first 16 years of the school&#x27;s history, the University of Georgia only existed on paper. By the new century, a committee was appointed to find suitable land to establish a campus. Committee member John Milledge purchased 633 acres of land on the west bank of the Oconee River and immediately gave it to the university. This tract of land, now a part of the consolidated city–county of Athens-Clarke County, Georgia, was then part of Jackson County. , 37 acres of that land remained as part of the North Campus.

Because Baldwin was elected to the U.S. Senate, the school needed a new president. Baldwin chose his former student and fellow professor at Yale, Josiah Meigs, as his replacement. Meigs became the school&#x27;s president, as well as the first and only professor. After traveling the state to recruit a few students, Meigs opened the school with no building in the fall of 1801. The first school building patterned after Yale&#x27;s Connecticut Hall was built the year later. Yale&#x27;s early influence on the new university extended into the classical curriculum with emphasis on Latin and Greek. By 1803, the students formed a debate society, Demosthenian Literary Society. Meigs had his first graduating class of nine by 1804. In 1806, the school dedicated the first legacy building, Franklin College (named after Benjamin Franklin). The building is now known as Old College.

After the tenure of the next two presidents, John Brown (1811–1816) and Robert Finley (1817), a timeframe that saw enrollment drop, presidents Moses Waddel (1819–1829) and Alonzo Church (1829–1859) worked to re-engage new students. By 1859, enrollment had risen to 100 students, and the university employed eight faculty members and opened a new law school. During this timeframe, the university erected the New College building followed by the Chapel in 1832. Church was the longest-serving president in UGA history. In 1859, the state legislature abolished the Senatus Academicus, leaving the board of trustees as the only official governing body. When Church retired, Andrew A. Lipscomb was appointed to the newly renamed position of chancellor in 1860.

=== Civil War era and late 19th century ===
The University of Georgia closed in September 1863 due to the Civil War and reopened in January 1866 with an enrollment of about 80 students including veterans using an award of $300 granted by the General Assembly to former soldiers under an agreement that they would remain in Georgia as teachers after graduation. The university received additional funding through the 1862 Morrill Act, which was used to create land-grant colleges across the nation. In 1872, the $243,000 federal allotment to Georgia was invested to create a $16,000 annual income used to establish the Georgia State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts (A&amp;M), initially separate and independent from the University of Georgia. However, A&amp;M&#x27;s funding was considered part of the university, which helped save it from bankruptcy during the Reconstruction era. As a land-grant school, UGA was required to provide military training, which the university began to offer in the 1870s.

Several of the university&#x27;s extracurricular organizations began in the late 1800s. In 1886, fraternities at UGA began publishing the school&#x27;s yearbook, the &quot;Pandora&quot;. The same year, the university gained its first intercollegiate sport when a baseball team was formed, followed by a football team formed in 1892. Both teams played in a small field west of campus now known as Herty Field. The Demosthenian and Phi Kappa literary societies together formed the student paper, &quot;The Red &amp; Black&quot;, in 1883. In 1894, the University of Georgia joined six other southeastern schools to form the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SIAA).

=== Early 20th century ===

The turn of the century brought many changes in the administration and organization of the university including the naming of a new chancellor in 1899. Walter B. Hill became the first UGA alumnus to lead the university. A progressive leader, his six-year tenure, before his death from pneumonia, was marked with increased enrollment, expansion of the university&#x27;s course offerings, and the addition of state funding through appropriation, for the first time bringing the university&#x27;s annual income to over $100,000 in 1902. Hill and his successors David C. Barrow (1906–1925), Charles Snelling (1926–1932), and Steadman Sanford (1932–1935) would grow the school to take on the role of a true university. Many of the university&#x27;s schools and colleges were established during Barrow&#x27;s tenure. The College of Education (1908), the Graduate School (1910), the School of Commerce (1912), the School of Journalism (1915), and the Division of Home Economics (1918) were all established during this period. In 1906, UGA also incorporated the College of Agriculture by bringing together A&amp;M (agricultural and mechanical) courses. The college of science and engineering continued as formed in the previous century. Conner Hall became the first building built in South Campus and first of several buildings that housed the university&#x27;s agriculture programs on what came to be known as &quot;Ag Hill&quot;. In 1914, the first Phi Beta Kappa chapter in the state of Georgia was founded at UGA. In 1923, another honor society, Phi Kappa Phi, established a chapter at the university. In 1920, UGA&#x27;s athletic program was among 14 of the 30 universities to leave the SIAA to form the Southern Conference.

With students limited to white males for the first century of its history, the University of Georgia began admitting white female students during the summer of 1903 as postgraduate students to the State Normal School established in 1893 a few miles west of the campus. When the University of Georgia established a graduate school in 1910, female students were permitted to attend summer classes and some were also unofficially allowed to attend regular classes, as well. However, at that time only junior college transfers majoring in Home Economics were integrated into regular courses. Before official admission of women to the university, several women were able to complete graduate degrees through credit earned during the summer sessions. The first white woman to earn such a degree was Mary Dorothy Lyndon. She received a Master of Arts degree in 1914. Women were admitted as full-time undergraduates in 1918. Mary Ethel Creswell earned a Bachelor of Science in home economics in June 1919, becoming the first woman to earn an undergraduate degree at the university. Two UGA dormitories were later named after these graduates: Mary Lyndon Hall and Creswell Hall.
In 1932, the reorganization of the university&#x27;s administrative structure continued through the establishment of the University System of Georgia (USG), which brought UGA along with several other public colleges in the state under the control of a single board of regents. The State Normal School (later State Teachers College) was fully absorbed by the College of Education, with the former&#x27;s previous campus becoming UGA&#x27;s Coordinate Campus. UGA and Georgia Tech traded several school programs; all engineering programs (except agriculture) were transferred to Georgia Tech and UGA received Georgia Tech&#x27;s commerce program in return. The title of the university&#x27;s lead administrator was changed from chancellor back to the original title of president. Sanford was named UGA&#x27;s first president since 1860 and was succeeded by Harmon Caldwell (1935–1948). In 1933, the Division of Home Economics was reorganized as the School of Home of Economics, with UGA&#x27;s first female graduate, Creswell, appointed as dean. The university also became a founding member of the Southeastern Conference and established the University of Georgia Press in 1938.

Throughout this period, UGA&#x27;s enrollment grew every year with student population reaching 3,000 by 1937 and almost 4,000 by 1941. Through President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal, UGA received a $2 million infusion of funding and an additional $1 million from the state legislature. The university used the new funds to make a number of improvements to the campus from 1936 to the early 1940s. Many renovation projects were undertaken including the establishment of five new residence halls, a dining hall, eight new academic buildings, a nursery school, and several auxiliary facilities. An engineering professor Rudolph Driftmier and architect Roy Hitchcock were responsible for the design of several buildings in the neoclassical style, giving the campus a homogeneous and distinctive appearance. The funds were also used to pave roads, build sidewalks, and improve the campus&#x27;s landscaping.

=== Racial integration and the mid-20th century ===

The dean of the College of Education in 1941, Walter Cocking, was fired by Georgia Governor Eugene Talmadge in a controversial decision known as the Cocking affair. Talmadge was motivated by his belief that Cocking favored racial integration. The governor&#x27;s interference in the workings of USG&#x27;s board of regents prompted a response by the Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools, which stripped UGA and nine other schools in the system of their accreditation. The issue became a major point of contention in Talmadge&#x27;s 1942 re-election campaign. After his loss, a constitutional amendment passed by the state legislature gave the board independence from political interference which led to the schools quickly regaining their accreditation.

As the United States entered World War II, enrollment among male students dropped significantly, allowing female students to outnumber male students for the first time in the school&#x27;s history. The United States Navy set up a Navy Pre-Flight School on the campus, occupying many of the university&#x27;s buildings and constructing many new buildings and athletic facilities used by generations of students in the following decades.

In 1945, UGA accepted a donation of about 100 paintings from the New York art collector Alfred Holbrook and created the Georgia Museum of Art. In 1946, the School of Veterinary Medicine was re-established as a separate school, 13 years after it was discontinued as part of the agricultural college.

The following year, the quarterly literary journal &quot;The Georgia Review&quot; began publication in 1947. After Jonathan Rogers&#x27; brief tenure as president (1949–1950), Omer Clyde Aderhold started his 17-year-long stint as UGA president. During his tenure, the university sold Coordinate Campus to the U.S. Navy. He opened the school&#x27;s main library, the Ilah Dunlap-Little Memorial Library, in 1952, and in 1964, established the School of Social Work. The university also built a new Science Center on South Campus consisting of six buildings. After UGA&#x27;s pharmacy school moved to the new facility on the South Campus, the two portions of the campus took on distinct characteristics, with North Campus focused on arts, humanities, and law, and South Campus focused on natural sciences and agricultural programs.
Until January 1961, Georgia state law required racial segregation in publicly funded higher education. On January 6, 1961, the District Court mandated that UGA immediately admit two African American teenagers, Hamilton E. Holmes and Charlayne Hunter, who were previously denied admission in 1959 on the basis of race. This court order was quickly followed by an injunction preventing the enforcement of the segregation-mandating state law. On January 11, a riot formed outside Charlayne Hunter&#x27;s dormitory window, which &quot;shouted racial insults, and tossed firecrackers, bottles and bricks at the dormitory window&quot;. Dean Williams suspended the two students for &quot;their personal safety&quot;, but they returned to classes on January 16 following a court order. The university faculty subsequently formed a night patrol to help ensure the peace. Holmes graduated Phi Beta Kappa and was the first African-American student to attend the Emory University School of Medicine, where he earned his MD in 1967 and later became a professor of orthopedics and associate dean at Emory, the medical director at Grady Memorial Hospital, and a trustee of the University of Georgia Foundation, the university&#x27;s private fund-raising organization. Hunter (later, Hunter-Gault) graduated with a degree in journalism and was awarded two Emmys and a Peabody for excellence in broadcast journalism. Commemorating the 40th anniversary of when Holmes and Hunter &quot;walked through the Arch and into the Academic Building&quot; to register for classes on January 9, 1961, the university renamed the campus building where they registered as the Holmes-Hunter Academic Building. The university now presents the Holmes-Hunter Lectures series, which brings noted African-American speakers to the campus each year to discuss racial issues.

In June 1961, Holmes and Hunter were joined by another African American, Mary Frances Early, who transferred to the school as a graduate student. Before Holmes and Hunter, Early became the first African American to graduate from UGA in 1962. The College of Education later established a professorship in her honor. In February 2020, the UGA College of Education was officially named in honor of Mary Frances Early.

=== Late 20th century ===

In 1968, Fred Davison was appointed UGA president and served in the position for 19 years. During his tenure, the school&#x27;s research budget increased from $15.6 million to more than $90 million. UGA inaugurated the School of Environmental Design, was designated as a Sea Grant College, and built 15 new buildings on campus. By the 1970s, the University of Georgia ranked among the top 50 research universities in the U.S. and in 1973, the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education designated UGA as a &quot;Research 1 Doctoral University with very high research activity&quot;. By the time the school celebrated its bicentennial with a 15-month-long celebration, student enrollment had grown to about 25,000.

In the end, Davison&#x27;s tenure as president was marred by controversy surrounding the dismissal of Jan Kemp, a faculty member who also tutored student athletes. Kemp filed a lawsuit against the university for her termination; it garnered national media attention and led to criticism of instances of lax academic standards for a few students participating in some of UGA&#x27;s athletic programs. The courts finally awarded Kemp more than $1 million, leading to Davison&#x27;s resignation in 1986 and student athlete academic standards revisions.

Henry King Stanford served as interim president before the appointment of Charles Knapp in 1987. Together with UGA alumnus and Georgia Governor Zell Miller, Knapp helped establish the state&#x27;s HOPE Scholarship in 1993 with funds appropriated from the new state lottery. Knapp also was a founding member of the Georgia Research Alliance, and construction projects totaling more than $400 million were started during his administration, including the Biological Sciences Complex (1992), Ramsey Student Center for Physical Activities (1995), the Performing Arts Center, Hodgson Hall (1996), the music building (1996), the Georgia Museum of Art (1996), Dean Rusk Hall (1996), and the UGA Welcome Center (1996). The campus hosted four events in the 1996 Summer Olympics: rhythmic gymnastics, volleyball, women&#x27;s Gold Medal football match, and men&#x27;s Gold Medal football match. In 1997, Knapp was succeeded by Michael Adams, who served as UGA president for 16 years, well into the 21st century. After his retirement as president, Knapp continued to serve by joining UGA&#x27;s Institute of Higher Education as a part-time Distinguished Public Service Fellow and as a professor of economics in the university&#x27;s Terry College of Business.

=== 21st century ===

Adams began a strategic plan to grow the university&#x27;s academic programs in the new century. In 2001, UGA inaugurated the College of Environment and Design and the School of Public and International Affairs, the first new schools to open since 1964. The strategic plan also chose medicine and health sciences as a major focus of growth and development. Together with Provost Karen Holbrook and Arnett Mace (who succeed Holbrook), Adams opened the Biomedical and Health Sciences Institute, the UGA Cancer Center, the Center for Tropical and Emerging Global Diseases, and the Regenerative Bioscience Center. In 2005, the College of Public Health was created to bring together the various medical and health sciences programs. In 2011, UGA purchased back the former campus of the State Normal School from the U.S. Navy to create the UGA Health Sciences Campus. The Health Sciences Campus provides additional medical and health sciences programs, some in partnership with the Medical College of Georgia. The newly reacquired campus also became home to the College of Public Health. The Odum School of Ecology (2007) and the College of Engineering (2012) became the fourth and fifth schools to open during Adams&#x27;s tenure.

After Adams&#x27;s retirement on June 30, 2013, Jere Morehead was appointed as UGA&#x27;s 22nd president. Morehead is an alumnus of UGA&#x27;s law school and previously served as provost and vice president of academic affairs. Under Morehead, UGA continues its focus on research with a $458 million budget as of the 2017 fiscal year, placing 54th on the National Science Foundation rankings. In 2015, the College of Veterinary Medicine moved its teaching hospital to a new off-campus facility, leaving its previous building available for research and other uses. In September 2017, UGA used a combination of private and public funds to complete the second of three phases to build the Terry College of Business complex. The project has four buildings completed and will include a total of six buildings upon completion of the third phase. In 2020 the university concluded its fundraising campaign, after raising $1.45 billion.

== Organization and administration ==
The university has eighteen schools and colleges, the titles &quot;college&quot; or &quot;school&quot; not indicating any distinction between them for the university. Until the School of Medicine is staffed, in addition to the colleges and schools, the university is home to the University of Georgia/Medical College of Georgia Medical Partnership that provides education leading to the Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) degree from the University of Georgia as well as extensive facilities for medically related education and research at the University of Georgia. In the construction phase is a $100 million facility set to open in 2026 to provide training for at least 60 more University of Georgia medical students.

The President of the University of Georgia (Jere Morehead) is the head administrator and is appointed and overseen by the Georgia Board of Regents. University of Georgia has had 22 presidents since its founding in 1785. Each individual college and school is headed by a dean. The university has a student-to-faculty ratio of 17 students per faculty member.

According to the 2018–2019 estimated cost of attendance, based on a nine-month academic year for an average undergraduate student, the tuition and fees for Georgia residents is $11,830, and $30,404 for non-residents. The tuition and fees for an average international undergraduate student (based on a nine-month academic year) is $30,392.

== Campuses ==
The University of Georgia&#x27;s main campus is made up of 465 buildings covering an area of about . The university owns an additional of land in 31 counties across Georgia. As of October 2020, UGA employed 11,127 people of which more than 2,500 are faculty members. The main campus sits across from Athens, a consolidated city–county located 60 miles northeast of downtown Atlanta, Georgia. The city is the hometown of several popular musical artists including the American rock bands the B-52&#x27;s and R.E.M. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine named UGA among &quot;Top Ten Schools that Rock&quot;. In August 2015, &quot;Outside&quot; magazine named Athens sixth on a list of &quot;The 16 Best Places to Live in the U.S.&quot;

The campuses&#x27; dominant architectural themes are Federal, Classical and Antebellum style. Though there have been many additions, changes, and augmentations, the University of Georgia&#x27;s campus maintains its historic character. In 2000, the entire campus was designated as an arboretum, the University of Georgia Campus Arboretum. It is estimated to be home to about 9,000 trees with over 154 identified species including native trees such magnolias, red oaks, white oaks, and beeches, as well as non-native trees such as the North Africa Atlas cedar, the Chinese parasol and royal paulownia, and the Japanese zelkova and black pine.

=== North Campus ===
The North Campus is bounded by Baldwin Street to the south, Lumpkin Street to the west, Broad Street to the north and traditionally by Jackson Street to the east, but also extends past Jackson Street to East Campus Road. Several of the buildings that make up the old campus are designated as historic, covering part of the originally gifted to the university in 1801. The entire Old North Campus of the University of Georgia is listed in the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district.

Located at a central location in North Campus and constructed in 1806 as the first permanent building, Old College is the oldest building in Athens and one of the oldest in Northeast Georgia. The building closely resembles Yale University&#x27;s Connecticut Hall. It was designed with identical front and back to allow the university to grow in either direction. Currently housing the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences, the building originally served both instructional and residential purposes. New College was built in 1823 as a residence hall and was rebuilt in 1832.

Other historic buildings in the National Historic District include Waddel Hall, Demosthenian Hall, The chapel, Phi Kappa Hall, Lustrat Hall, Moore College, and Holmes–Hunter Academic Building. Named after UGA&#x27;s fifth president, Waddel Hall is the second-oldest building on campus. Built in the Federal style of architecture in 1821, it is also one of the smallest buildings on campus. Home to the oldest student organization and debate society at UGA, the 1824 Demosthenian Hall houses the Demosthenian Literary Society named after the Greek orator Demosthenes. Founded in 1803, the Demosthenian is among the oldest literary societies in the English-speaking world. Located between New College and Demosthenian Hall, The chapel is a Greek Revival-style building which resembles a classic temple. Considered &quot;the most beautiful building on campus&quot;, the interior features a large painting of the nave and aisles of the St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, painted by the artist George Cooke. Also built in the Greek Revival style in 1836, Phi Kappa Hall is home to the university&#x27;s second-oldest student organization and debate society, Phi Kappa Literary Society, founded in 1820 to rival the Demosthenian Literary Society.
The seventh-oldest building on campus, Lustrat Hall was originally built in 1847, north of its current location. Named after its last faculty occupant, it is the only remaining faculty residence house from Old North Campus. Used for a variety of purposes in the past, the building most recently houses the Office of Legal Affairs. Built in 1874, Moore College is the only remaining building constructed during post-Civil War Reconstruction. Originally home to the College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, Moore College currently houses the university&#x27;s Honors Program. The Holmes/Hunter Academic Building was simply known as the Academic Building when it was originally assembled in 1905. Following a Beaux-Arts architectural design by engineering professor Charles Strahan, the building was constructed by inserting a new building in between the older Ivy Building and Old Library. In 2001, the building was renamed after the first two African-American students at UGA. It houses the Office of the Registrar, and several other administrative offices. Also listed in the National Register of Historic Places is the Founders Memorial Garden which is named in honor of the Ladies Garden Club of Athens. Founded in 1891, it was the first garden club in the United States.

Throughout the historic buildings, several architectural, sculptural, and landscape features adorn the North Campus. Chief among them is The Arch which serves as the traditional entrance to the campus. Built in 1858 and modeled after the Great Seal of the State of Georgia, the area near the three-columned gate is a popular venue for the staging of demonstrations, gatherings, protests, and rallies. Although the Seal&#x27;s three pillars represent the state&#x27;s three branches of government, the pillars of The Arch are usually taken to represent the Georgia Constitution&#x27;s three principles of wisdom, justice, and moderation, which are engraved over the pillars of the Seal. On the opposite side of the Arch Quad, at the front of the Old College building sits a statue of the university&#x27;s founder Abraham Baldwin, installed by the University of Georgia Alumni Association. The President&#x27;s Club Garden, first planted in 1973 on the opposite side of the Old College building, honors the thousands of families who have made major financial contributions to the university. A fountain named after Hubert B. Owens and built in 1989 is tucked in the space between Old College, Lustrat House, and the Administration Building. Serving as a UGA faculty member for 45 years, Owen was responsible for initiating the university&#x27;s landscape architecture program, which later grew into the College of Environment and Design.

The Administration Building is another one of the later additions to the North Campus built in 1905 with $50,000 donated to the university from a major contributor, the philanthropist George Foster Peabody. It was the first building on campus designed to be fireproof in light of the fact that several fires in UGA&#x27;s history have destroyed key buildings. Originally used as the location for a library, it houses the offices of the university president and other senior administrative offices. Hirsch Hall was built in 1932 in Georgian style and named after Harold Hirsch who for a long period served as general counsel to The Coca-Cola Company. The building is home to the School of Law and the Alexander Campbell King Law Library located in a north-side addition built in 1967. Hirsch Hall connects by way of an overhead bridge to the J. Alton Hosch Law Library Annex built in 1981 and named after the former dean of the law school.
The university&#x27;s main library, the Ilah Dunlap Little Memorial Library, was built with funds bequeathed by its namesake, the wife of a UGA alumnus who stipulated several design requirements including that it face north across the mall towards Old College. Home to the University of Georgia Press and the &quot;Georgia Review&quot;, the library serves as the headquarters to a network of secondary libraries located throughout the campus. Following the addition of a seven-story annex in 1974, the library became the third-largest academic building at UGA and the largest in North Campus. The main library is part of a quad consisting of Hirsch Hall, Old College, Waddell Hall and Peabody Hall. Although the aforementioned George Foster Peabody also contributed to funds used to build Peabody Hall, the building is actually named after George Peabody who in an 1869 testamentary trust created a $2.25-million fund to benefit several universities in the South. The University of Georgia combined $40,000 from this fund with other contributions to construct Peabody Hall which houses the Departments of Religion and Philosophy and the Institute of Native American Studies.

=== South Campus ===
Located across Field Street from Central Campus to its north, South Campus is encircled by East Campus Road to its east, Pinecrest Drive to the south, and Lumpkin Street to the west. It is connected to the areas to its north by way of the Jim Gillis Bridge, named after the former director of the Georgia State Highway Board. South Campus is the largest of the five segments of the UGA campus, latitudinally stretching for more than a mile. Originally begun as an expansion to accommodate the growing agricultural programs in an area known as &quot;Ag Hill&quot;, it is home most of the university&#x27;s science and engineer programs. In 2006, work was completed on D. W. Brooks Mall to give the campus a more green aesthetic similar to North Campus, replacing parking lots and a section of the street by the same name which bisected the area lengthwise.
Lumpkin House, also known as &quot;Rock House&quot;, is the oldest building on South Campus, built in 1844. The building is named after its original owner, Wilson Lumpkin, the former Georgia congressman, governor, and U.S. Senator who designed and built the house as his retirement home. In 1970, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places. The second-oldest building, named after the state legislator James J. Conner, sits on one of the highest points in Athens. Built in the Renaissance Revival style, Conner Hall also serves the CAES. Barrow Hall, built in 1911, is the third-oldest building in South Campus and serves a variety of academic programs. Originally known as the Farm Mechanics Building, the building was renamed after Chancellor David C. Barrow, during whose tenure it was constructed.

Home to the College of Family and Consumer Sciences, Dawson Hall was built in 1932 to house the university&#x27;s growing home economics department, then part of the College of Agriculture. In 1971, the school added an annex to Dawson Hall and later renamed it after Mary Spiers who was dean of the School of Home Economics from 1954 to 1971. The College of Family and Consumer Sciences also has five other buildings, built in 1939 and 1940, known collectively as the McPhaul Center.

On the curved hill between Dawson Hall and Sanford Stadium, a plan envisioned in 1953, proposed the construction of a Science Center to house the university&#x27;s various scientific programs. Between 1959 and 1960, six buildings were constructed to each house studies in physics, Food Sciences, Geography–Geology, Chemistry, Biological Sciences, and Poultry Science. Located south of the Food Sciences Building, the Museum of Natural History manages several collections of artifacts and specimens from archaeology, biology, geology, and paleontology located throughout the buildings on campus. The Science Library was built south of Dawson Hall in 1968 to supplement the Science Center complex. Containing a thirteen-feet and over-2,500-pound skeleton of a giant North American ground sloth, a foyer connects the Science Library with the Boyd Graduate Studies Building also built in 1968.
Named after U.S. Senator Paul D. Coverdell, the Paul D. Coverdell Center for Biomedical and Health Sciences is a $40-million facility with of space, giving enough room for about 275 scientists, staff and graduate students. The center was specifically designed to maximize energy efficiency and it was built with local and recycled materials. Laboratory intensive groups at the Coverdell Center include the Center for Tropical and Emerging Global Diseases, and the Biomedical Health Sciences Institute. Former President George H. W. Bush spoke at the center&#x27;s grand opening in 2006. In 2016, the university also opened the Science Learning Center, a facility located near Stegeman Coliseum.

The Driftmier Engineering Center, named after a campus engineer and the head of the former Agricultural Engineering Division of the College of Agriculture. Partnering with Roy Hitchcock, Rudolph H. Driftmier was responsible for the design and construction of 15 buildings on campus from 1930 to 1965. The building renamed after Driftmier in 1982 was constructed in 1966 and is now home to the College of Engineering.

The Georgia Center for Continuing Education &amp; Hotel is also located on South Campus. The building hosts many seminars and conferences every year. The Georgia Center was built in 1957. The center is also home to the WUGA, an affiliate of the National Public Radio.

=== Central Campus ===
Bounded by Lumpkin Street to the west and East Campus Road to the east, Central Campus was developed on the remaining woodland area between the larger and older North and South Campuses. Development began in 1910 with Memorial Hall which remained unfinished until 1925 due to financial constraints. Originally envisioned as a student athletic facility and constructed with a swimming pool and gymnasium, Memorial Hall has served a wide variety of purposes before becoming home to the offices of the vice president of student affairs and several other administrative offices. Several former athletic facilities were located in this area before they were replaced by newer academic buildings, student life centers, and residence halls. Of these athletic facilities, only Sanford Stadium remains and continues to dominate Central Campus.
Located in the northwest corner, the Fine Arts Building was modeled in the neoclassical architectural style and built in 1941 with funds from the Public Works Administration, part of the New Deal initiated in the 1930s. The building covers an area about the size of a city block, and the interior features a giant mural by French-American artist Jean Charlot. At the time of its construction, it was the largest and most expensive academic building on campus. The Zell B. Miller Learning Center became the largest academic building in Central Campus when it was built in 2003 with a footprint of . With 26 classrooms and lecture halls and a total of 2,200 seats, the Learning Center is also probably the most heavily used by students. In 2009, the building was renamed in honor of UGA alumnus Zell B. Miller who went on to serve as the 79th Governor of Georgia and later as the U.S. Senator from Georgia. Another heavily used building is the Dean Tate Student Center built in 1983 and expanded in 2009. The LEED Gold-certified building features a green roof and 75,000 gallon cistern to catch rainwater for use in irrigation and flushing toilets. The building was named after William Tate, the former dean of men.

The Psychology and Journalism Building was built on grounds which formerly housed the university&#x27;s tennis courts and gymnasium, Woodruff Hall. In 1967, a $6.1 million construction project created the building to house two of the largest departments at the university, the psychology department, part of the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences, and the Henry W. Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication, named after the former editor of &quot;The Atlanta Constitution&quot;. Other buildings in the area include Clark Howell Hall, built in 1937 as a dormitory but which later became home to the UGA Career Center, and the UGA Bookstore built in 1968.

=== West Campus ===

Several residential halls are located in what is known as West Campus. It is made up of eight residence halls built in the 1960s and a pre-existing private residence hall, Oglethorpe House, which the university purchased in 1979. Lipscomb Hall, Mell Hall, Creswell Hall, Russell Hall, Brumby Hall, Hill Hall, Church Hall, and Boggs Hall are all named after former UGA presidents, deans, and administrators. Other notable buildings west of the campus include the Wray-Nicholson House, which was built in 1825, named after two businessmen who previously occupied the house and now home to the UGA Alumni Association; The Richard B. Russell Jr. Special Collections Libraries Building, built in 2012, was named after the former Georgia governor and senator, and currently houses several archives and special collections.

In 2013, the university began construction on Terry College of Business Complex. A total of six buildings were to be completed in a three-phase construction project. The first phase completed in 2015 led to the opening of Correll Hall. Phase II was completed in September 2017, opening Amos Hall, Benson Hall and Moore-Rooker Hall. All of the buildings were named after major contributors to the business school. Construction then began on the third phase of the project in 2018 to include two more buildings named Ivester and Orkin Hall which were completed in 2020.

=== East Campus ===
The newest addition to the campus, East Campus is demarcated by College Station Road to the south, East Campus Road to the west, River Road to the north and stretches to the Athens Perimeter or Loop 10 to the east. Its most northern building is the Performing Arts Center. Its main concert hall, the 1,100-seat Hodgson Hall, has hosted the performances of notable orchestras such the Royal Philharmonic and the St. Petersburg Philharmonic, and regularly hosts seasonal performances by the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. The center also holds the smaller Ramsey Hall, which stages performances by solo and small chamber groups.

East Campus is also home to the Georgia Museum of Art located just south of the Performing Arts Center. The museum&#x27;s collection began with a donation of paintings by American artists from the art collector Alfred Heber Holbrook who developed a close friendship with the head of UGA Art Department, Lamar Dodd. Holbrook subsequently moved to Athens to become the museum&#x27;s director, donated more than 900 works, and served as director for 25 years. In 1982, the Georgia General Assembly designated the museum as the official state museum of art. The current building in which the museum is located was built in 1996 and expanded in 2011. The building received a Gold LEED certification its &quot;use of materials and construction strategies to achieve environmental sustainability.&quot;

The Ramsey Student Physical Activities Center is located on East Campus. It was built in 1995 and named in honor of Eugenia A. and Bernard Ramsey.

== Academics ==

===Undergraduate admissions===
The university considers many factors in admissions decisions: high school grades, particularly the rigor of high school study—a student&#x27;s studying in a school&#x27;s &quot;advanced&quot; or &quot;most difficult&quot; curriculum, taking of advanced placement, College Board Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, early college enrollment and other rigorous classes; scores on standardized tests (SAT or ACT); academic and personal achievements; extracurricular activities; the mandatory school counselor evaluation letter as well academic letters of recommendation from teachers; the student&#x27;s personal statement. University admissions are need-blind for domestic applicants.

As a state university, UGA automatically admits applicants that graduate first or second in their class at an SACS-accredited high school in Georgia. For others who go through the traditional application process, selectivity is deemed &quot;more selective&quot; according to the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching and by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. The Princeton Review gives the university an &quot;Admissions Selectivity Rating&quot; of 96/99. The ACT Assessment Student Report places UGA student admissions in the &quot;highly selective&quot; category, the highest category. In the 2020–2021 academic year, 69 freshman students were National Merit Scholars.

In 2023, the university received 43,416 applications. It extended offers of admission to 16,729 applicants, or 37.2%. 6,150 accepted students chose to enroll at the university, a yield rate of 38.1%. Of the 70% of incoming students in 2023 who submitted SAT scores, the interquartile range was 1230–1410 with an average of 1320; of the 47% of incoming students in 2023 who submitted ACT scores, the interquartile range was 27–32 with an average of 29. Of all matriculating students, the average high school GPA was 4.14. The average enrolled student had completed an average of ten Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or college duel-enrollment courses in high school.

Incoming students include those from every state and 57 countries around the world. Among admitted students in the class of 2024, 15% were out-of-state, and the top three states other than Georgia were California, Florida, and Maryland.

The Bioenergy Systems Research Institute conducts research in bioenergy that recognize the entire lifecycle and environmental impact of biomass production, harvesting, transport, treatment, conversion, and recycling. In 2013, the Institute received a $20 million from the United States Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) and the Golden Field Office (GFO). The institute was established to help bolster the university&#x27;s research expenditure in environmental science.

The 2013 SEC Academic Symposium, an academic conference-type event intended to address a scholarly issue in an area of strength represented by all SEC universities, was organized and led by the University of Georgia and the UGA Bioenergy Systems Research Institute in Atlanta, Georgia. The topic of the Symposium was titled, the &quot;Impact of the Southeast in the World&#x27;s Renewable Energy Future.&quot;

=== Odum School of Ecology ===
In 2007, the Odum School of Ecology became the first-stand alone college or school within a university dedicated to the study of ecology and environmental science. The school was named after UGA professor and ecologist, Eugene Odum, who pioneered the modern study of ecology.

The university has since made several advancements in sustainability. Under the UGA Facilities Management Division, the Office of Sustainability was initiated in 2010 as part of a strategic directive to enhance conservation of resources and long-term sustainability at the university. Through long-term environmental initiatives, under President Michael F. Adams the university established the office after support from students and faculty and residents of the Athens area. The Office of Sustainability&#x27;s mission is to continue to improve environmental sustainability in many different areas on campus.

The initiative was a result of a 2009 Report of the Working Group on Sustainability at the University of Georgia and the Green Initiative Fund (TGIF) student-led campaign. The Green Initiative Fund modeled their funding campaign after a similar campaign by students at the University of California-Berkeley. , the Office of Sustainability has awarded a total of $170,000 to fund 47 student-initiated sustainability projects at UGA The Campus Sustainability Grants Program has helped foster several student initiatives, including water bottle refilling stations in the Zell B. Miller Learning Center, &quot;Dawgs Ditch the Dumpster&quot; residence hall move-out donation program, Tanyard Creek Chew Crew prescribed grazing project for invasive plant removal and Material Reuse Program, which uses salvaged items to construct school and community gardens.

The university and Athens-Clarke County established a bicycle master plan to improve the mobility of students on campus while remaining environmentally consciousness.

In 2009 the University of Georgia earned LEED certification from the U.S. Green Building Council with high marks for the expansion of the Tate Student Center. The renovated Tate Student Center became the sixth building on a university campus in the state of Georgia to be certified at the gold level and the second to be so designated in Athens. In 2012, Building 1516, a university housing complex constructed in 2010, became the first LEED-certified housing complex at the University of Georgia.

In 2012, the College of Environmental Design&#x27;s Visual Arts Building (now known as the Jackson Street Building) after a $9.9 million renovation became the first UGA building to incorporate a water reclamation system and the first to utilize solar harvesting technology through solar panels.

In 2013 the university hosted the inaugural SEC Symposium in Atlanta. The topic is the Southeast&#x27;s impact on the future of renewable energy, and the participants are the 14 universities of the SEC, as supported by its new academic initiative, SECU.

In the same year, the university was named by the National Arbor Foundation as a designated Tree Campus USA for the third time in a row as a result of the university&#x27;s continued commitment to maintaining and adding new foliage. The University of Georgia has more than 9,000 trees on campus, according to an ongoing tree-mapping project being conducted by the University Grounds Department. The number will continue to grow due to a partnership between Select Sustainable Tree Trust and UGA. In 2009, the Select Sustainable Tree Trust selected the university to receive a $1 million tree donation to &quot;re-green&quot; and impact the university campus with large-scale, sustainable shade trees.

As of April 2019, UGA has entered into a contract to add up to 19 new electric buses. The 19 buses were put into service on campus in February 2020. In December 2019, as the university was awarded $7.46 million under the Federal Transit Administration&#x27;s Grants for Buses and Bus Facilities Program, it was announced that 13 additional electric buses would be added to the fleet, which will bring the total number of electric buses on campus to 33. The electric buses will account for a third of the total fleet in 2021, when UGA begins to phase out and decommission older diesel buses.

=== Small Satellite Research Laboratory ===
The University of Georgia Small Satellite Research Laboratory (SSRL) was founded in 2016 by students with the help of researchers, scientists, and faculty associated the Center for Geospatial Research. The SSRL is funded by the NASA USIP (Undergraduate Student Instrument Project) to build a Cube Satellite for Low Earth Orbit. The SSRL is also part of the Air Force Research Laboratory&#x27;s (AFRL) University Nanosatellite Program (UNP). The SSRL is student-led and will be building UGA&#x27;s first satellite, a Cubesat, which will be sent to the International Space Station for deployment in late 2018.

=== Center for Computational Quantum Chemistry (CCQC) ===

The Center for Computational Quantum Chemistry (CCQC) is a research center in the department of chemistry, founded in 1987 by Professor Henry Schaefer, who continues to work there. Research at the CCQC employs computational chemistry to elucidate and/or correlate many areas of chemical research.

== Student life ==

The University of Georgia has registered almost 800 student organizations, academic associations, honor societies, student government organizations, cultural groups, sport teams, religious groups, publications, social groups and fraternities, volunteer and community service programs, philanthropic groups, and others that are all run by both graduate and undergraduate students and are integral parts of student life. In 2015 (the latest year), UGA was recognized by the President&#x27;s Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll by the Corporation for National and Community Service. The honor is the highest federal recognition a college or university can receive for its commitment to volunteering, service-learning and civic engagement. The latest designation marks the ninth consecutive year UGA was named on the honor roll.

=== Student housing ===
Housing at the university is managed by the Department of University Housing. Student on-campus housing is divided into several communities: Brumby, Russell, Creswell, Black-Diallo-Miller, Hill, Myers, Reed, and the East Campus Village.

Brumby, Creswell, and Russell halls are collectively known as the &quot;freshman high-rises&quot; due to their similarities in design and function. All three are located just off Baxter Street on West Campus. These are the biggest residence halls on campus and each house about 1,000 freshmen. The Hill community of residence halls consists of six building in West Campus near the freshman dorms. The community has a females-only residence (Hill Hall) and six coed residences: Boggs, Church, Lipscomb, Mell, and Oglethorpe Halls.

The Myers community consists of four buildings in a quad located on South Campus. They are the coed residence halls Myers, Rutherford, and Mary Lyndon, along with Soule Hall which is reserved for female students. The Reed community is made up of four coed residence halls in North and Central Campus: Morris, Payne, Reed, and Building 1516. The East Campus Village consists of the apartment-style coed residences: Busbee, McWhorter, Rooker, and Vandiver.

=== Greek life ===

The University of Georgia maintains one of the South&#x27;s oldest Greek systems. The fraternities and sororities maintain homes both on and off campus. There are a number of secret societies that exist at the university, such as Palladia and Gridiron. The first Greek letter fraternity to charter at the university was Sigma Alpha Epsilon in 1865, and the first sorority was Phi Mu in 1921. In 2023 24% of undergraduate men and 37% of undergraduate women were active members in UGA&#x27;s Greek system. There are twenty sorority chapters. There are twenty-eight fraternity chapters.

=== Reserve Officer Training Corps ===
Under the Morrill Act, as a land-grant university, UGA is required to include a military program as part of its available curriculum, which program is now known as the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC). Many universities that are not land-grant have established ROTC programs such as the one at Harvard University. The University of Georgia ROTC is the official officer training and commissioning program at the university. Prior to the 1862 Morrill Act, UGA founded its military program in 1801, and it is one of the oldest such programs in the nation. Memorial Hall was built with funds that Georgia alumni raised following World War I and was dedicated in 1924 to those alumni and students who had given their lives in the war. Departments of the Army and the Air Force each maintain an ROTC detachment on campus.

=== Student Government Association ===
Executives of the University of Georgia&#x27;s Student Government Association (SGA) make up the Student Advisory Council, which is composed of Student Government Presidents from every public college or university within the University System of Georgia. The Student Advisory Council is organized to advise the Georgia Board of Regents, through the Chancellor, on issues that are important to students.

=== Student media ===
&quot;The Red &amp; Black&quot; (&quot;R&amp;B&quot;) is UGA&#x27;s independent daily newspaper. Established in 1893 and independent of the university since 1980, &quot;The Red &amp; Black&quot; is the largest college newspaper in Georgia and the tenth largest newspaper in the state of Georgia. Students published its first issue on November 24, 1893, from offices in the Academic Building on North Campus. The paper is self-sufficient through the sale of advertising making it one of the few student newspapers to do so. &quot;The Red &amp; Black&quot; has won numerous awards nationally. In 2012, the &quot;Princeton Review&quot; named &quot;The Red &amp; Black&quot; tenth among the nation&#x27;s best student newspapers.

&quot;R&amp;B-TV&quot; is the photos and videos division of &quot;The Red &amp; Black&quot;. R&amp;B-TV publishes various videos relating to the University of Georgia and the community at large.

WUGA-FM is the radio station run by students of the University of Georgia. Just before 6:00 a.m. on the morning of August 28, 1987, WUGA-FM signed on for its first day of broadcasting to Athens and the surrounding area. WUGA-FM broadcasts with 6000 watts in an &quot;omni-directional pattern.&quot; WUGA-FM radio is the third most listened to station in Athens market out of 18 stations reported. It is the most listened to station for people with managerial, administrative or professional occupations.

Launched in 2011, &quot;Ampersand Magazine&quot; is a UGA monthly publication catered to Athens residents. The magazine is a subsidized by &quot;The Red and Black.&quot;

&quot;Georgia Political Review (GPR)&quot; is a student-run magazine and website focusing on political science, international affairs, history, and economics at the local, state, national, and international levels while providing timely commentary on politics and foreign affairs. In addition to its magazine and website, it publishes a weekly newsletter called &quot;GPR Digest&quot;, which offers short summaries of recent political and cultural events, every year hosts The Great Debate, a moderated debate among college political groups, and has X, Facebook, and Instagram accounts. It was founded in 2011 by 6 undergraduate students at UGA and is a student publication unique in the state university system.

Law students publish four legal journals: &quot;Georgia Law Review&quot;, the &quot;Journal of Intellectual Property Law&quot;, the &quot;Georgia Journal of International and Comparative Law&quot;, and the &quot;Georgia Criminal Law Review&quot;. In addition to the &quot;Georgia Law Review&quot;, students publish the online component, the &quot;Georgia Law Review Online&quot;, which features essays by practitioners, judges and professors focused primarily on timely legal issues in the U.S. Courts of Appeals.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.law.uga.edu/journals&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Pandora&quot; is the yearbook of the University of Georgia; its first issue was published in 1886.

== Athletics ==


The University of Georgia varsity athletic teams participate in the NCAA&#x27;s Division I FBS as a member of the Southeastern Conference. Since the 1997–1998 season, UGA has seven top ten rankings in the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics (NACDA) Directors&#x27; Cup, a numerical ranking based on the success of universities in all varsity sports. The university has won national championships in football, women&#x27;s gymnastics, women&#x27;s equestrian, baseball, tennis (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s), golf (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s), indoor and outdoor track &amp; field, and women&#x27;s swimming and diving. The Gym Dogs, the university&#x27;s women&#x27;s gymnastics team, have an NCAA-leading 10 national championships in gymnastics, including five consecutive championships from 2005 to 2009.

The Bulldogs&#x27; most historic rivalry is with the nearby Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets. However, major rivalries have grown since, including the rivalry with the Florida Gators, and with the Auburn Tigers, referred to as the &quot;Deep South&#x27;s Oldest Rivalry&quot; in reference to the first football game played between the two teams in 1892 and the more than one hundred meetings since. In 2011, &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; named the Florida–Georgia football rivalry one of college football&#x27;s top 10 rivalries.

The university also hosts several non-varsity sports, including wrestling, men&#x27;s soccer, crew, ultimate frisbee, rugby, lacrosse, ice hockey, and sailing. Georgia&#x27;s men&#x27;s lacrosse team has won the South Eastern Lacrosse Conference three times, in 1998, 2007, and 2008, and received an automatic bid to the Men&#x27;s Collegiate Lacrosse Association national tournament, while the women&#x27;s team earned an at-large bid to the WDIA National Tournament in 2007.

=== 1996 Summer Olympic Games ===

The University of Georgia played an instrumental role in Atlanta&#x27;s bid for the 1996 Summer Olympics. The University of Georgia conducted a majority of the preliminary studies for the economic impact of bringing the Olympic games to Atlanta, and hosted many Olympic events. In 1987, Atlanta attorney and former football player at the University of Georgia, William &quot;Billy&quot; Payne, conceived the idea of hosting the 1996 Summer Olympic Games. Atlanta mayor Andrew Young was among the first to join Payne in the quest to develop a bid and sell the proposal, first to local business leaders, then to the U.S. Olympic Committee, and finally to the members of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). The home of the Bulldogs hosted the medal round of the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s Olympic football (soccer) in July 1996. Sanford Stadium was temporarily converted into a soccer stadium which saw the removal of the privet hedges surrounding the playing field. The hedges had been symbolic to UGA since the early 1930s. The hedges were restored after the Olympic games. In 1996, UGA&#x27;s High Point was selected as the training site for the U.S. Dressage Team, which competed in the Summer Olympic games at the International Horse Park in Conyers, Georgia. The university&#x27;s basketball stadium, Stegeman Coliseum, was the venue for Volleyball and Rhythmic Gymnastics.

== Traditions ==

=== School colors ===
The University of Georgia&#x27;s original colors included old gold, until the intense rivalry between Georgia Tech and Georgia around 1891 resulted in a skirmish over colors. Georgia students and alumni declared yellow an unfit color for the Georgia Bulldogs, deeming it a cowardly color. After the 1893 football game against Georgia Tech, University of Georgia President, Charles Herty, removed old gold as an official school color. Crimson (also referred to as &quot;Good Old Georgia Red&quot;) and black have been the official colors ever since.

The decision to include crimson red is also thought to be a tribute to the state of Georgia and a reminder of the university&#x27;s flagship status. Kaolinite, commonly referred to as &quot;Georgia red clay&quot; is commonly found throughout the state, especially in the Red Hills Region. The red color that is so evident in Georgia soils is due primarily to iron oxides.

=== The mascot ===

Bulldogs have been on the sidelines for UGA athletic events since at least the 1800s. The origin of the English Bulldog representing UGA athletic teams came from Yale University, with whom UGA had strong ties in its early years. Many early buildings and campus plans followed the layout of Yale. The bulldog mascot stems from the university&#x27;s founding father and first president, Abraham Baldwin, who was a graduate of Yale. The Bulldog mascots were thought to be a tribute to Baldwin&#x27;s alma mater. The term &quot;Georgia Bulldogs&quot; to identify a Georgia team was first coined on November 3, 1920, by &quot;Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; writer Morgan Blake. After a 0–0 tie with the University of Virginia in Charlottesville on November 6, 1920, Atlanta Constitution writer Cliff Wheatley used the name &quot;Bulldogs&quot; in his story five times. This name for UGA teams caught on and has been used ever since.

Uga the Bulldog is the official live mascot of the Georgia Bulldogs. Uga is from a line owned by Frank W. (Sonny) Seiler of Savannah, Georgia since 1956. The current line began with Uga I, a solid white English Bulldog who was the grandson of a former Georgia mascot who made the trip to the 1943 Rose Bowl. Perhaps the most famous Uga was Uga V who made appearances in the movie &quot;Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.&quot; Uga V was also featured on the cover of the April 1997 edition of Sports Illustrated. Uga XI became the mascot in 2023.

The University of Georgia is the only major college that buries its mascots within the confines of its stadium. Ugas I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, and IX are buried in marble vaults near the main gate in the embankment of the south stands of Sanford Stadium. Epitaphs to the dogs are inscribed in bronze, and before each home game, flowers are placed on their graves.

=== The Chapel Bell ===
The Chapel Bell is a historic monument and long-standing tradition of the University of Georgia. The Chapel Bell is located on the historic North Campus. Built in 1832, when Protestant orthodoxy dominated the campus region, the chapel was a center of campus activities. A daily religious service, which students were required to attend, were held there, as were assemblies and commencements. The bell was also rung to mark the beginning and the end of class.

Over the years, the Chapel Bell has served as an athletic tradition at the University of Georgia. The ringing of the Chapel Bell after a Georgia victory is a tradition that has endured since the 1890s. In Georgia football&#x27;s early days, Herty Field was located only yards from the chapel, and first-year students were compelled to ring the bell until midnight in celebration of a Bulldog victory. Today, students, alumni, fans and townspeople still rush to the chapel to ring the bell after a victory. The bell is also utilized for University meetings and events, weddings and remembrance ringing. The bell was rung in memory of victims of the September 11 attacks in 2001. After the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting, the University of Georgia partook in a nationwide mourning by ringing the Chapel Bell in honor of the victims of the shooting.

On October 27, 2007, as tradition warrants, Georgia fans rang the Chapel Bell to celebrate the 42–30 win over the university&#x27;s archrival, the Florida Gators. The excitement caused the yoke holding the 877 lb. bell to give way, and it fell from the support platform. The university has returned the bell to its historic post and , it still rings daily across campus.

=== Founders Week ===

January 27, 1785, is the date the University of Georgia became the first public university to have a charter granted. Each year, January 27 is commemorated to honor UGA&#x27;s place in the history of American colleges and universities. The tradition began in 2002 and is now celebrated as Founders Week. During Founders Week, a series of celebrations are hosted by various campus departments including the Student Alumni Association and the Student Government Association.

The Emeriti Scholars, a group of retired faculty members especially known for their teaching abilities and continued involvement in the university&#x27;s academic life, sponsor the Founders Day Lecture. The lecture is held in the UGA Chapel and has become a Founders Day tradition, drawing alumni, students, faculty, esteemed guests and members of the community.

=== The Arch ===
In 1857, the University of Georgia constructed a cast iron representation of the architectural elements featured on the obverse of the Great Seal of the state of Georgia. It stands at the north entrance of the campus, and has become known as The Arch. Fashioned from existing material, The Arch is a representation but not an exact replica of the architectural elements of the Seal. Originally serving both symbolic and practical functions, it was connected to a barrier which kept cows from roaming over parts of the campus, and was initially known as The Gate. It serves as the official icon and a historic landmark for the university. Since the 1900s, tradition has held that students may not pass beneath the Arch until they have received a diploma from the University of Georgia. Those who walked under the Arch prior to graduation commencement were said never to graduate. The tradition began when Daniel Huntley Redfearn, Class of 1910, arrived as a freshman from Boston, Georgia and vowed not to pass beneath the Arch until he had graduated. One of Redfearn&#x27;s professors heard the vow and repeated it to his class, and the tradition has stood ever since. Many freshmen, learning of the tradition during orientation or from other sources still choose to honor the century-old tradition. Years of following the tradition are visible on the concrete steps leading to the Arch. Steps to each side have been worn down over the years as undergraduates have kept their vows.

The Arch has been a site of historic political demonstrations. In 1961, when UGA officials desegregated the university with the admission of its first two African-American students, Hamilton Holmes and Charlayne Hunter-Gault. The Arch was a witness to students protesting both for and against segregation in the protesting the Persian Gulf War and a demonstration following the 1970 shootings at Kent State University. In 2001, along with the Chapel Bell, the Arch was the site of a memorial to the victims of the September 11 attacks.

=== The fight song and &quot;Alma Mater&quot; ===
&quot;Glory, Glory&quot; is the rally song for the Georgia Bulldogs. &quot;Glory, Glory&quot; is sung to the tune of &quot;The Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot;. It was sung at games as early as the 1890s, but arranged in its present form by musician-composer Hugh Hodgson in 1915. There have been many Bulldog songs through the years and at least two collections dating back to 1909 have been published, but &quot;Glory, Glory&quot; has been the most accepted among students and alumni. The only known original reference to the piece is in a history of the Redcoat Band written in 1962, which briefly mentions the march as &quot;Georgia&#x27;s first original school song&quot; and notes that &quot;all copies of the work have been lost.&quot; The document is kept in the university&#x27;s Hargrett Library for rare and historic documents.

Although &quot;Glory, Glory&quot; is generally thought to be the school&#x27;s fight song, the official fight song is &quot;Hail to Georgia.&quot; Both are performed at football games by the Georgia Redcoat Marching Band, which plays the fight song after field goals and extra points, and &quot;Glory, Glory&quot; after touchdowns, interceptions, and victories. First stablished in 1905 as a military band, the Redcoat Band now has over 430 members and represents the university in sporting and community events.

The &quot;Alma Mater&quot;, the official school song of the University of Georgia, is set to the tune of &quot;Annie Lisle&quot;, a popular 1857 ballad by H. S. Thompson. The lyrics to &quot;Alma Mater&quot;, penned by J.B. Wright Jr., and Gail Carter Dendy, are unique to UGA. The song is sung at commencement and various official events of the University of Georgia.

=== Playing &quot;Between the Hedges&quot; and Sanford Stadium ===
Sanford Stadium is the on-campus playing venue for football at the University of Georgia in Athens. The 92,746-seat stadium is the seventh largest stadium in the National Collegiate Athletic Association and has a grass (versus synthetic) field. The stadium is the eighth largest non-racing stadium in the United States and the 14th largest such stadium in the world. The stadium played host to the Olympic medal competition of men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s Olympic football (soccer) at the 1996 Summer Olympics.

The University of Georgia playing &quot;Between the Hedges&quot; is a reference to Sanford Stadium that dates back to the early 1930s. The famous Chinese privet hedges that surround Sanford&#x27;s playing field were only one foot high when the stadium was dedicated in 1929 and were protected by a wooden fence. Sports writers, referring to an upcoming home game, were said to observe &quot;that the Bulldogs will have their opponent &quot;between the hedges.&quot; The phrase was coined by the Atlanta sportswriter Grantland Rice. Games played there are said to be played &quot;Between the Hedges&quot; due to the privet hedges, which had stood around the field since 1929, but removed in the summer of 1996 so that soccer could be played for the 1996 Summer Olympics; new, albeit considerably shorter, hedges were restored in the fall of 1996. The hedges have been dubbed Hedges II by UGA fans.

=== The Dawg Walk ===
The Dawg Walk is a Saturday football tradition and celebration at University of Georgia home games when UGA students and fans line up in the Tate Center parking lot to form a tunnel that greets the players and coaches as they enter Sanford Stadium. The team enters the stadium through Gate 10 at Sanford Stadium to the music of the Redcoat Marching Band. The march is often led by the team&#x27;s costumed mascot Hairy Dawg.

The Dawg Walk is preceded by two show section shows. The Redcoat Sousaphones perform a warm up concert in the Tate Center assembly area, while the Redcoat Drumline performs a drumshow in the parking lot.

<doc id="378243" wikidata="Q682827" url="?curid=378243" title="Frick Collection">
<text>The Frick Collection (colloquially known as the Frick) is an art museum on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in New York City, New York, U.S. It was established in 1935 to preserve the art collection of the industrialist Henry Clay Frick. The collection consists of 14th- to 19th-century European paintings, as well as other pieces of European fine and decorative art. It is located at the Henry Clay Frick House, a Beaux-Arts mansion designed for Henry Clay Frick. The Frick also houses the Frick Art Research Library, an art history research center established by Frick&#x27;s daughter Helen Clay Frick in 1920, which contains sales catalogs, books, periodicals, and photographs.

The museum dates to 1920, when the trustees of Frick&#x27;s estate formed the Frick Collection Inc. to care for his art collection, which he had bequeathed for public use. After Frick&#x27;s wife Adelaide Frick died in 1931, John Russell Pope converted the Frick House into a museum, which opened on December 16, 1935. The museum acquired additional works of art over the years, and it expanded the house in 1977 to accommodate increasing visitation. Following fundraising campaigns in the 2000s, a further expansion was announced in the 2010s. From 2021 until March 2024, during the renovation of the Frick House, the Frick Madison operated at 945 Madison Avenue. The Frick House is scheduled to reopen in April 2025.

The Frick has about 1,500 pieces in its collection as of 2021. Artists with works in the collection include Bellini, Fragonard, Gainsborough, Goya, Holbein, Rembrandt, Titian, Turner, Velázquez, Vermeer, and Whistler. The museum has gradually acquired additional pieces over the years to supplement the paintings in Frick&#x27;s original collection. In addition to its permanent collection, the museum has hosted small temporary exhibitions on narrowly defined topics, as well as academic symposiums, concerts, and classes. The Frick Collection typically has up to 300,000 visitors annually and has an endowment fund to support its programming. Commentary on the museum over the years has been largely positive, particularly in relation to the works themselves and their juxtaposition with the Frick House.

== History ==

Henry Clay Frick was a coke and steel magnate. As early as 1870, he had hung pictures throughout his house in Broadford, Pennsylvania. Frick acquired the first painting in his permanent collection, Luis Jiménez&#x27;s &quot;In the Louvre,&quot; in 1880, after moving to Pittsburgh. He did not begin buying paintings in large numbers until the mid-1890s, and he began devoting significant amounts of time to his collection. This made Frick one of several prominent American businessmen who also collected art, along with figures such as Henry Havemeyer and J. P. Morgan. In explaining why he collected art, Frick said, &quot;I can make money... I cannot make pictures.&quot; He curated his collection with the help of Joseph Duveen, 1st Baron Duveen.

When the Frick family moved from Pittsburgh to New York City in 1905, they leased the William H. Vanderbilt House at 640 Fifth Avenue, and Frick expanded his collection during that time. The collection was spread across their homes in New York, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts. Thomas Hastings of Carrère and Hastings designed Frick&#x27;s permanent house at 1 East 70th Street, which was completed in 1914. The house had been designed with the collection in mind. James Howard Bridge, Frick&#x27;s personal assistant, was hired as the house&#x27;s curator in 1914 and worked at the house for fourteen years. Frick, who was known for being especially particular in his tastes, spent an estimated $10 million to acquire pieces during his lifetime. Duveen opened four art-purchasing accounts for Frick, including two accounts specifically for art from Morgan&#x27;s estate.

=== Creation ===

==== Establishment of Frick Collection Inc. ====

Frick died in 1919 at the age of 69, bequeathing the house as a public museum for his art collection. His widow Adelaide Howard Childs Frick continued living in the mansion with her daughter Helen; if Adelaide died or moved away, the house would be converted to a public museum. At the time, the collection alone was worth $30 million, and Frick also provided a $15 million endowment for the maintenance of the collection. Nine people, including Adelaide, Helen, and Helen&#x27;s brother Childs, were named as trustees of his estate; Childs served as the head of the Frick estate&#x27;s board of trustees until his death in 1965. Per the terms of Frick&#x27;s will, the trustees moved to incorporate Frick&#x27;s art collection in April 1920, submitting articles of incorporation to the New York state government. The Frick Collection Inc. was incorporated that month.

The New York and Pennsylvania state governments fought over which government should collect taxes from Frick&#x27;s estate. Amid this dispute, the collection was reassessed at $13 million in 1921; this figure was repeated in a revised appraisal of Frick&#x27;s estate that was filed with the New York state government in 1923. Meanwhile, Helen Frick studied plans for the Witt Library in London in the early 1920s, as she wanted to create a library for Frick&#x27;s personal collection. Helen catalogued most of the collection over the next decade. The Frick Art Research Library, originally named the Frick Art Reference Library, was organized at the mansion after Frick&#x27;s death, and a dedicated library building opened the next year. During the 1920s, the library added thousands of volumes and photographs to its holdings. Over the years, four additional trustees had to be appointed after their predecessors died.

==== Opening of museum ====
After Adelaide Frick&#x27;s death in October 1931, the trustees were finally allowed to open the house to the public; they announced in January 1933 that the collection would likely open to the public within a year. John Russell Pope was hired to alter and enlarge the house. Frederick Mortimer Clapp, who had joined the Frick Collection as an advisor in 1931, was hired as the museum&#x27;s first director. Work on the mansion began in December 1933. A new library wing was constructed on 71st Street to replace the original library. Other modifications included a new storage vault and renovations of the Frick family&#x27;s living space. The museum&#x27;s opening, originally scheduled for 1934, was postponed because of the complexity of the construction project. The Frick estate also sued the city government in 1935 to obtain a property-tax exemption for the museum, and the taxes were waived the next year, as the Frick Collection was a public museum.

When the rebuilt library opened in January 1935, it had 200,000 photographs, 18,000 catalogs of art sales, and 45,000 books. The museum itself had a soft opening on December 11, 1935; the preview was noteworthy enough that the names of 700 visitors were published in that day&#x27;s &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;. The Frick Collection officially opened to the public five days later on December 16. When it opened, the museum did not charge admission fees, but staff distributed timed-entry tickets to prevent crowding. Although about 600 tickets were distributed daily to people who showed up in person, other visitors had to make reservations several weeks in advance due to high demand. Ropes were placed throughout the house to force visitors to follow a specific path. The galleries were originally closed on holidays, Sundays, and for a month in the middle of the year. Artworks were arranged based on how they blended in with the house&#x27;s ambiance, rather than being arranged by year.

=== 1930s to 1960s ===
Within a year of the museum&#x27;s opening, demand had declined enough that officials decided to scale down, and then eliminate, its timed-entry ticketing system. The ropes throughout the house were taken down, and visitors were allowed to visit the Frick House&#x27;s rooms in any order. Museum officials also presented lectures five days a week during the late 1930s, and they started hosting afternoon concert series in November 1938; these concerts and lectures continued throughout Clapp&#x27;s tenure at the museum. Clapp also obtained fresh flowers each day and placed them in the first-floor galleries for esthetic purposes. Three magnolia trees were planted on the grounds in 1939. To expand their land holdings, museum officials bought a neighboring townhouse at 9 East 70th Street in 1940 and used that building as storage space.

Museum officials constructed a vault in 1941 to protect the artwork from air raids. During World War II, the museum continued to host visitors, but some rooms were closed, and more than five dozen paintings and all of the sculptures were moved into storage. Museum officials took these pieces out of storage in May 1945 and restored them; other artworks in the house were rearranged and cleaned as well. The Frick acquired another townhouse at 7 East 70th Street in 1947 and replaced it with a service wing. By the late 1940s, the museum had cumulatively spent about $2.9 million in acquisitions since Frick&#x27;s death. When John D. Rockefeller Jr. offered to donate several pieces of artwork in 1948, Helen Frick objected, arguing that the museum only accepted gifts from Frick family members. In the lawsuit that followed, a New York Supreme Court judge ruled that the terms of Frick&#x27;s will did not prevent the museum from accepting external gifts; the court&#x27;s Appellate Division upheld this ruling. Rockefeller, who had been on the board of trustees, resigned amid the dispute.

Clapp resigned in 1951 and was replaced by the museum&#x27;s assistant director Franklin M. Biebel. Biebel established a decorative-arts conservation program, and the number of annual visitors nearly doubled under his tenure. The museum&#x27;s collection remained largely unchanged over the next several years, as Helen Frick opposed any expansions, saying that her father would not have wanted items to be added. Helen resigned from the museum&#x27;s board of trustees in 1961, when the board finally voted to accept Rockefeller&#x27;s gift. Assistant director Harry D. M. Grier replaced Biebel, becoming the museum&#x27;s third director in 1964. By the mid-1960s, the Frick had 160 portraits, 80 sculptures, and various other items in its collection. The Frick was open six days a week (except in August, when it was closed) and was still free to enter. The collection was small compared to that of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which at the time had 365,000 items. Edgar Munhall was hired as the museum&#x27;s first chief curator in 1965, a position he would hold for thirty-five years. As part of a master plan in 1967, the Frick&#x27;s trustees drew up plans for an annex at 7 and 9 East 70th Street.

=== 1970s to 1990s ===

By the early 1970s, the museum recorded about 800 daily visitors and employed 75 staff members. The next year, the museum began asking visitors to pay an optional admission fee due to rising taxes and expenses. After Grier was killed in a traffic accident in 1972, Everett Fahy was appointed as the museum&#x27;s fourth director in 1973. The museum announced plans to construct an annex at 5–9 East 70th Street. After the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) expressed concerns over the fact that the expansion would require the demolition of the Widener House at 5 East 70th Street, the museum announced a plan for a &quot;temporary garden&quot; on the 70th Street lots, which the LPC approved. The original annex was canceled that November, and Frick officials subsequently decided to build a one-story wing on the Widener House&#x27;s site. The annex had been proposed because, at the time, the mansion could accommodate only 250 people at once.

Under Fahy&#x27;s tenure, the museum began hosting more temporary exhibits, which it had seldom held before Fahy took over. The Frick began charging admission for the first time in 1976. The annex was completed the next year, along with a garden, designed by British landscape architect Russell Page. The Frick renovated the Boucher Room and cleaned and rearranged its paintings during the following decade. By the mid-1980s, the museum displayed 169 works of art, and the galleries occupied 16 rooms. The museum periodically hosted chamber music performances in the Frick House&#x27;s courtyard. It was relatively low-profile compared to others in New York City, only sporadically expanding its collection and hosting small temporary exhibitions. After Helen Frick died in 1984, the museum took over responsibility for the Frick Art Research Library; initially, the library had no endowment as Helen had not provided anything for the library in her will. Ceiling lights were installed in the Fragonard and Boucher rooms in the 1980s.

Charles Ryskamp, the former director of the Pierpont Morgan Library, was appointed as the Frick&#x27;s fifth director in December 1986 after Fahy&#x27;s resignation, though he did not assume that position for another six months. Under Ryskamp&#x27;s directorship, some of the paintings were rearranged or brought out of storage. By the 1990s, the art reference library was low on funds; the library had a $25 million endowment by 1993, and the Frick began charging &quot;frequent commercial users&quot; of the library that year. Through the 1990s, the Frick banned all children under the age of 10, as well as unaccompanied minors between ages 10 and 15, and the museum also did not have a café. The New York City government passed a law banning public institutions from discriminating by age in 1993, which would have forced the museum to start admitting children. Museum officials requested a waiver, saying that they would have to install barriers if children were allowed, and they received such a waiver in 1995. In addition, further lighting upgrades were made in the mid-1990s.

Ryskamp announced his retirement in 1997. After Samuel Sachs II was named as the museum&#x27;s sixth director that May, the trustees tasked him with raising funds. Under Sachs&#x27;s directorship, the museum launched a website in the 1990s, and replaced the lighting and hosted additional special exhibitions. Sachs also contemplated expanding the exhibition space, adding a café, and relocating the entrance to the house&#x27;s garden. In addition, the museum began providing complimentary audio guides for the mansion and artworks and, in the early 21st century, added the Bloomberg Connects smartphone app. Museum officials also began allowing parties to be hosted in the Frick House. A group named Friends of the Fellows of the Frick Collection was formed to raise interest in the museum.

=== 2000s and 2010s ===
Colin Bailey was appointed as chief curator in 2000 after Munhall resigned. During the late 1990s, the Helen Clay Frick Foundation proposed moving its archives in Pittsburgh to the Frick Collection&#x27;s archives, prompting an intra-family debate over whether the collections should be merged. The foundation&#x27;s collection ultimately was split between the two cities in 2001, and most of the objects were sent to New York City. After attendance dropped following the September 11 attacks that year, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation provided $270,000, in part to fund extended hours on Fridays. Sachs announced in January 2003 that he would resign as the museum&#x27;s director in eight months, as the board of trustees had not renewed his contract. At the time of Sachs&#x27;s resignation, the museum recorded 350,000 annual visitors, 20 percent more than in 1997, but it was running at a $1 million annual deficit. Annexes to the museum were proposed in 2001, 2005, and 2008, but all of these plans were canceled because it would have required an extended closure of the museum and still would not have provided sufficient space.

The art scholar Anne L. Poulet was hired in August 2003 as the Frick&#x27;s first female director, and the museum was reorganized as a tax-exempt public charity shortly after Poulet became the director. Under Poulet&#x27;s tenure, she replaced lighting in several galleries and rearranged some of the pieces. She also raised $55 million for renovations; the museum&#x27;s facilities had become dated, and the basement exhibition space was no longer sufficient. Because of the Frick&#x27;s classification as a charity, the museum had to raise a third of its budget from donations. The Frick created programs to attract major donors and art collectors, and it began charging admission fees for concerts in 2005. During the 2000s decade, the Frick did not acquire many additional items. In contrast to larger museums, it generally hosted small, detailed exhibits, though the number of short-term exhibitions at the Frick increased during the decade. Further restorations of the museum&#x27;s galleries took place through the late 2000s to attract visitors.

Poulet announced her retirement in September 2010, and Ian Wardropper was hired as the museum&#x27;s director in 2011. A sculpture gallery, designed by Davis Brody Bond, opened at the Frick House in December 2011, becoming the first new gallery at the museum in three decades. Bailey resigned as the chief curator in 2013, and Xavier F. Salomon was hired as the chief curator the same year. During the 2010s, the Frick began raising $290 million for its renovation. The collection had reached more than 1,100 works by the mid-2010s. In addition, the museum was hosting an average of five temporary exhibits per year. The Frick House&#x27;s facilities were not adequate for the museum&#x27;s modern needs. For example, paintings had to be carried into the museum through the house&#x27;s front door, and portraits had to be placed in storage whenever the Frick hosted a visiting show. The concerts at the museum sometimes sold out as well.

In 2014, the museum announced plans for a six-story annex on 70th Street designed by Davis Brody Bond. Russell Page&#x27;s garden on 70th Street would have been demolished to make way for the annex; this prompted opposition from residents and preservationists, and the Frick announced in June 2015 that it would draw up new designs. To attract younger visitors, the museum began hosting free events in the mid-2010s, such as First Fridays. The Frick hired Annabelle Selldorf to design a revised expansion plan for the museum, which was announced in April 2018; the LPC approved Selldorf&#x27;s plans that June. The Frick then sought to relocate to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum temporarily, but the Guggenheim was available for only four months. By September 2018, the Frick was negotiating to take over the Whitney Museum&#x27;s space at 945 Madison Avenue; the Frick finalized a two-year lease for that building in 2020.

=== 2020s to present ===

The Frick closed in mid-March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City; the opening of the temporary location was delayed due to the pandemic. The museum&#x27;s collection was moved to 945 Madison Avenue, which reopened as the Frick Madison in March 2021. The Frick Madison housed the museum&#x27;s old masters collection, including 104 paintings, along with sculptures, vases, and clocks. Most of the 1,500-piece collection of artwork was placed in storage at 945 Madison Avenue, and about 300 works were placed on display. At the Frick Madison, the artwork was exhibited against stark dark gray walls, in contrast to the Frick House&#x27;s ornate decoration; the paintings were also grouped according to their age and region of origin. The Frick Madison also included a café.

The museum had raised $242 million for its capital campaign by the end of 2023. Wardropper announced in January 2024 that he would resign the following year, after the Frick House&#x27;s renovation was complete. The Frick Madison closed on March 3, 2024. The Henry Clay Frick House and Frick Art Research Library were originally expected to reopen in late 2024, but this was later pushed back to April 17, 2025. In September 2024, the Frick hired Axel Rüger, the head of the Royal Academy of Arts in London, to serve as the museum&#x27;s director beginning in 2025.

== Collection ==
The Frick has a collection of old master paintings and furniture housed in 19 galleries of varying size within the former residence. Frick ultimately acquired a variety of European paintings, Renaissance bronzes, French clocks, and a set of porcelains. Toward the end of Frick&#x27;s life, he focused on porcelains, sculptures, and furniture. Although Frick made over a thousand acquisitions over his lifetime, he resold most of the things he bought. The original collection contained 635 pieces of art or decorations when Frick died. When the museum opened, it displayed 136 or about 200 paintings in addition to porcelains, enamels, and bronzes. There were also 80 sculptures on display.

Helen Clay Frick and the board of trustees expanded the collection after his death; in 2006, the &quot;New York Times&quot; estimated that about 30 percent of the collection had been acquired after Frick died. Nonetheless, until 1948, the museum accepted donations of art only from Frick family members. The museum can lend works acquired after Frick&#x27;s death, but not works that he owned in his lifetime; this restriction has prevented works from appearing in other museums&#x27; exhibitions. The Frick is also prohibited from selling items in its collection and seldom acquires new works. Some of the works are normally not visible to the public but can be displayed as necessary. The Frick has sometimes borrowed paintings for long periods, including a portrait of Cosimo de&#x27; Medici that was displayed in the museum from 1970 to 1989. Purchases of new art were funded by the museum&#x27;s endowment until 2016, when the museum&#x27;s trustees established an acquisitions fund.

, the museum has 1,500 pieces in its collection, including both paintings and other objects; it normally displays 470 objects. Prior to the museum&#x27;s 2021 renovation, the artwork was displayed in 15 galleries.

=== Visual arts collection ===
Frick&#x27;s collection initially consisted of salon pieces and works by Barbizon School artists, and he bought 90 paintings from Charles Carstairs between 1895 and 1900 alone. He had begun to acquire other types of paintings by the end of the 19th century, and his acquisitions during the 1900s were increasingly composed of Old Master artworks. By the early 1910s, his collection consisted largely of English and Dutch paintings, with scattered French and Spanish paintings; a magazine article from that time described him as having relatively little interest in Italian Renaissance work. The paintings ranged from the 14th to 19th centuries, and many of the paintings depicted women. There were some chronological gaps in the original collection: for example, there were no 17th-century French paintings when the museum opened, even as the museum had both older and newer French paintings.

When Frick died, he was variously cited as having collected 103, 137, &quot;about 140&quot;, or 250 paintings. Some of the original paintings in Frick&#x27;s personal collection were discovered to be forgeries after his death, while other paintings were found to be misattributed. Artists with works in the museum&#x27;s collection have included:
* Giovanni Bellini
* François Boucher
* Agnolo Bronzino
* Cimabue
* John Constable
* Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot
* Aelbert Cuyp
* Jacques-Louis David
* Gerard David
* Jean-Honoré Fragonard
* El Greco
* Gentile da Fabriano
* Thomas Gainsborough
* Francisco Goya
* Frans Hals
* Meindert Hobbema
* William Hogarth
* Hans Holbein the Younger
* John Hoppner
* Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres
* Thomas Lawrence
* Jean-François Millet
* Bartolomé Esteban Murillo
* Jean-Marc Nattier
* Henry Raeburn
* Rembrandt
* Pierre-Auguste Renoir
* Joshua Reynolds
* George Romney
* Titian
* J. M. W. Turner
* Johannes Vermeer
* Paolo Veronese
* Diego Velázquez
* Anthony Van Dyck
* Jan van Eyck
* Jacob van Ruisdael
* James McNeill Whistler
Several artists, including Holbein, Vermeer, Rembrandt, Turner, Gainsborough, Van Dyck, Fragonard, and Boucher, painted multiple pieces that are in the collection. Included in the modern collection are Fragonard&#x27;s &quot;The Progress of Love&quot;, three Vermeer paintings including &quot;Mistress and Maid&quot;, two van Ruisdael paintings including &quot;Quay at Amsterdam&quot;, El Greco&#x27;s &quot;Christ Driving the Money Changers from the Temple&quot;, Titian&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of a Man in a Red Cap&quot;, one of Rembrandt&#x27;s self-portraits, and della Francesca&#x27;s &quot;St. John the Evangelist&quot;.

==== Notable works in the original collection ====
Some of the earliest works in Frick&#x27;s collection were portraits of his family, created for his Pittsburgh residence. At the beginning of the 20th century, Frick bought works such as Rembrandt&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of a Young Artist&quot; (possibly the first Old Master painting in the collection), Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot&#x27;s &quot;Ville d&#x27;Avray&quot;, Constant Troyon&#x27;s &quot;A Pasture in Normandy&quot;, and Vermeer&#x27;s &quot;Girl Interrupted at Her Music&quot;. From 1905 to 1915, Frick also acquired paintings such as Hals&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of a Woman&quot;, Velázquez&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of Philip IV in Fraga&quot;, Rembrandt&#x27;s &quot;A Dutch Merchant&quot;, and Rembrandt&#x27;s &quot;The Polish Rider&quot;.

After Frick had finished his own mansion, he brought over several paintings of his firstborn daughter Martha, who had died in her childhood. He also obtained 14 Fragonard panels from the collection of J. P. Morgan and moved the panels to his house&#x27;s drawing room. At the time of the house&#x27;s completion, he owned paintings by such artists as El Greco, Goya, Hals, Rembrandt, Romney, Titian, Anthony van Dyck, and Velázquez. In the late 1910s, Frick acquired additional pieces from outside the Morgan collection, such as Hans Holbein&#x27;s portrait of Thomas Cromwell, Rubens&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of the Marquis Ambrose de Spinola&quot;, Rembrandt&#x27;s &quot;An Old Woman Reflecting Over the Lecture&quot;, and Gainsborough&#x27;s &quot;Mall&quot; between 1915 and 1916 alone. He also bought four Boucher panels, although he turned down the opportunity to buy additional panels. From 1917 through 1919, Frick obtained several pieces of Boucher tapestry furniture, Van Dyck&#x27;s &quot;Countess of Clanbrazil&quot;, Hals&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of a Man&quot;, Vermeer&#x27;s &quot;Mistress and Maid&quot;, and a Gilbert Stuart portrait of George Washington.

==== Notable acquisitions after Frick&#x27;s death ====
In the half-century after Frick died, thirty objects were added to the original collection. After Frick&#x27;s death but before the opening of the current museum, the Frick estate&#x27;s trustees bought the &quot;Portrait of Comtesse d&#x27;Haussonville&quot; by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, as well as a painting by Duccio and the &quot;Coronation of the Virgin&quot; by Paolo Veneziano. The Giuseppe Bastiani painting &quot;Adoration of Magi&quot; was acquired in 1935. Works by Cimabue, Duccio, della Francesca, and Filippo Lippi entered the museum&#x27;s collection for the first time between 1924 and 1950. Shortly after the museum opened, it acquired items such as a Renaissance-era panel by della Francesca, a portrait that Boucher painted of his wife, Jacques-Louis David&#x27;s painting of a French noblewoman, Monet&#x27;s &quot;Vétheuil in Winter&quot;, and a Paul Cézanne landscape. This was followed in the 1950s by three Italian Renaissance paintings, David&#x27;s portrait of Antonio Bartolomeo Bruni, and Jan van Eyck&#x27;s &quot;Virgin and Child, with Saints and Donor&quot;. The collection had only one 17th-century French work until the 1960s, when the museum obtained Claude Lorrain&#x27;s painting of the Sermon on the Mount; the museum also obtained della Francesca&#x27;s &quot;Crucifixion&quot; during that decade.

The Frick did not acquire anything between and 1991, when the museum obtained its first Jean-Antoine Watteau painting, &quot;Portal of Valenciennes&quot;. The museum&#x27;s other acquisitions in the 1990s and 2000s included one of Corot&#x27;s oil sketches, two of Jean-Baptiste Greuze&#x27;s portraits, and Gabriel de Saint-Aubin&#x27;s &quot;The Private Academy&quot;. After former director Ryskamp died in 2010, he bequeathed some of his collection to the Frick. The museum&#x27;s other acquisitions in the 2010s included a self-portrait by Bartolomé Esteban Murillo that had been owned by Henry Clay Frick&#x27;s grandson. In 2023, the Frick obtained Giovanni Battista Moroni&#x27;s painting &quot;Portrait of a Lady&quot;, the first Renaissance-era portrait of a woman in the collection.

=== Other objects ===
The modern-day museum&#x27;s collection includes numerous works of sculpture and porcelain, in addition to 18th-century French furniture, Limoges enamel, and Oriental rugs. The objects in the collection include 18th-century tapestries that belonged to Louis XV and Louis XVI of France.

Frick had acquired some objects from the J. P. Morgan estate specifically to complement the visual art in his collection. Some of these acquisitions included 18th-century French sculptures and furniture, a hawthorn beaker, and Chinese porcelains. In one case, Frick paid $1.5 million for some of Morgan&#x27;s 44 enamels and 225 bronzes. He also acquired 40 Limoges enamels from Morgan&#x27;s collection in 1919, one of the last things he would personally purchase. Outside of the Morgan collection, Frick also bought the bronzes &quot;Bust of a Jurist&quot; by Danese Cattaneo, &quot;Antonio Galli&quot; by Federico Brandani, and &quot;Duke of Alba&quot; by Jacques Jonghelinck. Although Frick had planned a sculpture gallery to his home in the late 1910s, the lack of other statuary caused him to cancel the plan. Duveen displayed numerous marble busts in the Frick House while Frick decided whether to buy them.

A bust of Henry Clay Frick by Malvina Hoffman was gifted to the museum when it opened in 1935. Other acquisitions of sculpture in the mid-20th century included a &quot;Diana&quot; bust by Jean-Antoine Houdon, a 15th-century bronze figure of an angel, and a pair of 15th-century Italian marble busts. In the 1990s and 2000s, the Frick received Winthrop Edey&#x27;s collection of timekeeping pieces, a 19th-century terracotta bust by Joseph Chinard, a marble bust by Houdon; a bust by Massimiliano Soldani Benzi, and a clock. Acquisitions since the 2010s have included 131 Meissen porcelains, as well as 28 objects from collector Alexis Gregory (including rare clocks and enamels).

=== Selected works ===

== Programming and events ==
=== Temporary exhibits ===
The Frick Collection has historically hosted temporary exhibitions less frequently than similar museums. It initially focused almost exclusively on its permanent collection, with one temporary exhibit a year during the 1960s. Since 1972, the Frick has sometimes hosted small exhibitions on narrowly defined topics; in some cases, exhibitions have consisted of a single painting. By the 2010s, the museum hosted five exhibits a year on average, and exhibitions were scheduled several years in advance.

==== Late 20th century ====
Temporary exhibitions in the 1970s included an exhibit in honor of the museum&#x27;s late director Harry D. M. Grier, bronzes by Severo Calzetta da Ravenna, and drawings by Fragonard. Topics of temporary exhibitions during the 1980s included busts by Houdon, French clocks, terracotta sculptures by Clodion, drawings by Ingres, Henry Clay Frick&#x27;s earliest acquisitions, and Old Master paintings.

Especially in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the museum has hosted temporary exhibitions about singular artworks or artists. Among the items exhibited in the 1990s were works by French painter Nicolas Lancret, watercolors from the Rijksmuseum, eighteenth- and nineteenth-century drawings from the Stanford Museum, a single Claude Monet painting, drawings by German artists, and drawings by French artists. In 1999, several items in the permanent collection were taken out of storage specifically to complement an exhibition of Ingres&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of Comtesse d&#x27;Haussonville&quot;.

==== 21st century ====
In the early 2000s, the topics of the Frick&#x27;s exhibitions included drawings in the collection of the Albertina museum, paintings from John Hay Whitney&#x27;s collection, El Greco paintings, antique clocks, pieces from the Toledo Museum of Art&#x27;s collection, a set of Parmigianino paintings, and three consecutive exhibits of antique bronzes. Later in the decade, the temporary exhibitions included portraits by Hans Memling, paintings by Paolo Veronese, a show of French art, the Frick&#x27;s first Meissen porcelain show, pieces from the Norton Simon Museum&#x27;s collection, and a single painting by Parmigianino. The Frick hosted various exhibits in honor of its 75th anniversary in 2010, including an exhibition on its own founding. Other early-2010s exhibits included works from the Dulwich Picture Gallery, works from the Courtauld Gallery, Picasso drawings, Renoir paintings, Piero della Francesca panels, and a historical overview of &quot;St. Francis in the Desert&quot;.

After some works from the Mauritshuis in The Hague were displayed at the Frick in 2013, the Frick displayed several paintings at the Mauritshuis in 2015, marking the first time that the Frick lent paintings to a European museum. During the mid- and late 2010s, the subjects of the Frick&#x27;s exhibits included paintings from the Scottish National Gallery&#x27;s collection, paintings from the Museo dell&#x27;Opera del Duomo in Florence, works by Andrea del Sarto, objects by Pierre Gouthière, and canvases by J. M. W. Turner. When the Frick moved to 945 Madison Avenue in the early 2020s, its exhibits included a showcase of Barkley Hendricks paintings (the museum&#x27;s first exhibit of a black artist&#x27;s art) and a pair of paintings by Giovanni Bellini and Giorgio da Castelfranco.

=== Other programs ===
The museum hosts special events, such as academic symposiums, concerts, and classes. The educational programs are led by Rika Burnham, who became head of the museum&#x27;s education department in 2008. The Frick&#x27;s educational programs include online visits for students at secondary schools and postsecondary institutions, as well as courses where a single piece is discussed at length. The Frick also has partnerships with local educational partnerships such as the Ghetto Film School. Docents began hosting lectures in galleries in 2010, and the museum launched a mobile app in 2014, allowing visitors to bookmark artworks in the museum&#x27;s collection. After the Frick closed for renovation, museum officials launched several digital programs, including drawing classes and discussions about artwork.

Every year since 2000, the Frick hosts the Young Fellows Ball, a springtime gala for philanthropists who are largely under age 40. The museum also started hosting an annual Garden Party in 2008; the event, which began as a members-only gathering, evolved into an annual fundraiser. In 2016, the Frick introduced First Fridays, in which patrons could visit the museum for free on the first Friday of every month. First Fridays include gallery talks and activities for visitors.

The Concerts from the Frick Collection series was launched in 1938 and has continued through the 20th and 21st centuries. Musicians who have performed at the Frick Collection have included Ian Bostridge, Matthias Goerne, Guarneri String Quartet, Wanda Landowska, Gregor Piatigorsky, Artur Schnabel, and Kiri Te Kanawa. The concerts were broadcast on radio starting in 1939, first on the Municipal Broadcasting System, then on American Public Radio and WNYC. Although visitors originally could listen to the concerts free of charge (even after the museum started charging an admission fee), a separate admission charge for concerts was instituted in 2005. Prior to the 2020s renovation, the concerts were hosted in the Frick House&#x27;s music room.

=== Publications ===
The collection is detailed in books such as &quot;Masterpieces of the Frick Collection&quot;, first published in 1970, and &quot;Art in the Frick Collection&quot;, first published in 1996. The history of the collection was also detailed in &quot;Henry Clay Frick: An Intimate Portrait&quot;, a biography of Frick written by his great-granddaughter Martha Frick Symington Sanger in 1998. Sanger&#x27;s subsequent book &quot;The Henry Clay Frick House: Architecture-Interiors—Landscapes in the Golden Era&quot;, published in 2001, described the Frick House and its collection in detail. In 2011, the Frick and the BNP Paribas Foundation published a guidebook on the collection, its history, and the Frick House. The Frick launched its Diptych series in 2017; the series consists of short books with essays that relate to paintings from the museum&#x27;s collection.

== Building ==
The museum is ordinarily located at the Henry Clay Frick House at 1 East 70th Street, which is part of Fifth Avenue&#x27;s Museum Mile. The house spans an entire blockfront on Fifth Avenue between 70th and 71st Streets. The original structure from 1914 was designed by Thomas Hastings in the Beaux-Arts style. The same style is also used for the 1970s reception wing, designed by Harry Van Dyke, John Barrington Bayley, and G. Frederick Poehler. Both structures have a facade of Indiana Limestone. The house has a lawn that is mostly closed to the public.

The interiors were designed by a variety of people. The British decorator Charles Allom furnished most of the rooms on the ground floor, while the majority of the rooms on the second and third floors were decorated by Elsie de Wolfe. Charles Carstairs and Joseph Duveen provided the original decorations for the rooms. Inside the house are the museum&#x27;s galleries (adapted from the old living spaces of the mansion), as well as a courtyard with reflecting pool, the latter of which is based on a Roman atrium. Some parts of the house have been modified over the years specifically to accommodate the artwork, including a room for the Fragonard panels. In addition to the artwork and artifacts on display, there are bookcases placed throughout the Frick House&#x27;s rooms, and some rooms have various other pieces of furniture such as a dining table.

== Frick Art Research Library ==
The Frick Collection oversees the Frick Art Research Library, which was established in 1920 and opened to researchers in June 1924. The library is housed at a 13-story building at 10 East 71st Street (next to the original mansion). Prior to the library building&#x27;s opening, the basement bowling alley was used as storage space for the library&#x27;s collection. The library has always been open to the public, except during World War II, when it was closed for six months, and during the COVID-19 pandemic and 2020 renovation, when it was shuttered while being moved to the Frick Madison. The library is typically open free of charge to &quot;any adult with a serious interest in art&quot;. In the late 20th century, the library served 6,000 people a year on average, most of whom made advance reservations or requests.

Helen Frick acted as director for six decades, during which time its collection expanded to include 50,000 sales catalogs, 400,000 photographs, and 150,000 books. By the 1990s, the library had an estimated 235,000 volumes, which grew to 280,000 by the late 2000s. The collections of the library focus on art of the Western tradition from the fourth century to the mid-twentieth century, and chiefly include information about paintings, drawings, sculpture, prints, and illuminated manuscripts. Archival materials supplement its research collections. The Frick Art Research Library Photoarchive contains over a million photocopies of artwork, including objects that are not in the museum&#x27;s collection.

The Frick has been part of the New York Art Resources Consortium (NYARC), which also includes the Museum of Modern Art and Brooklyn Museum, since 2007. NYARC operates Arcade, an online catalog that combines the collections of the three museums&#x27; libraries. The Center for the History of Collecting, also founded in 2007, is also part of the library. The Frick is a member of the International Consortium of Photo Archives (PHAROS), which operates a database of digitized artworks from the collections of 14 art museums.

== Management ==
The Frick Collection is operated by a nonprofit organization of the same name, which is dedicated to conserving the artworks in the museum&#x27;s collection. Axel Rüger was named the Frick&#x27;s director in 2024, while Xavier F. Salomon is the chief curator. The director&#x27;s position has been known as the &quot;Anna-Maria and Stephen Kellen Director&quot; since 2020, while the chief curator&#x27;s position is known as the &quot;Peter Jay Sharp Chief Curator&quot;.

The museum&#x27;s board of trustees originally comprised nine trustees and was largely composed of Frick family members. The board was relatively small during the 20th century, with nine trustees until the 1990s and eleven by 2003. Under Poulet&#x27;s directorship, in the 2000s, the board was expanded by 10 members and was broadened to include more people from outside the Frick family. Poulet also introduced the Director&#x27;s Circle, a group of 44 members who each give a minimum of $25,000 a year to the Frick Collection.

=== Admission and attendance ===
After the museum opened in 1935, it accommodated 5,000 visitors in its first week and 100,000 visitors in six months; at its peak, the museum saw 1,600 visitors in one day. At the end of 1936, the museum had seen 136,000 visitors, an average of 460 per day. In the 1970s, the museum recorded between 800 and 1,500 daily visitors. The number of annual visitors averaged 250,000 by the late 1990s, and annual attendance had increased to 350,000 by the early 2000s. The Frick Collection had a typical annual attendance of up to 300,000 in the 2010s, although it recorded 420,000 visitors in 2013 due to a particularly popular exhibit there. Shows in the 2010s attracted upwards of 4,000 daily visitors.

The Frick was originally free to enter but has charged an admission fee since 1976. The museum offers pay-as-you-wish hours one day of the week, in addition to free admission on First Fridays. Free admission is also provided to members of the Frick; students and staff of certain universities in New York City; certain demographic groups such as youth, senior citizens, and people with disabilities; and other groups such as military personnel. Frick Collection members receive several membership benefits, including a queue jump for exhibits. As part of the Culture Pass program, persons with cards from New York City&#x27;s public libraries could also visit the museum for free with a Culture Pass, albeit with restrictions on the number of passes distributed. Until 2019, the Frick also sold the Connoisseur Pass, which also provided admission to the Morgan Library &amp; Museum and Neue Galerie New York.

Children under the age of 10 are not allowed inside the museum; this restriction, intended to protect the paintings, has existed ever since the museum opened in 1935. As part of the same restriction, youths between 10 and 15 years old are allowed to enter only if there is an adult with them. The museum provides guided tours to small groups and school classes. Starting in the late 1990s, the museum provided complimentary audio guides to visitors; it later added the Bloomberg Connects smartphone app. The guides are offered in several languages and consist of handsets that provide information about the artworks and the subjects of each painting. The Frick also launched its website in the late 1990s; the website has been updated several times since then.

=== Funding ===
Frick&#x27;s will established a $15 million endowment fund for what would become the Frick Collection museum. At the Frick Collection Inc.&#x27;s 50th anniversary in 1970, the museum&#x27;s endowment had grown to $40 million, and it received more than $1 million a year in income. By 1997, the Frick Collection had an operating budget of $10 million and an endowment of $170 million; this increased in the mid-2000s to a budget of $18.8 million and an endowment of $200 million. As of 2015, the museum had an endowment of $315 million.

== Reception and commentary ==

=== 20th-century commentary ===
In 1912, before the collection had become a museum, &quot;Town &amp; Country&quot; magazine wrote that Frick owned &quot;one of the greatest private collections of paintings in the world&quot;. &quot;Art World&quot; magazine said in 1917 that the Frick House contained &quot;one of the most remarkable assemblies of old paintings in the United States belonging to a private collector&quot;, rivaling the collection of the former Lenox Library on the same site. When the Frick Collection opened to the public in 1935, a critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the museum&#x27;s &quot;informality in the distribution of works of art has even its amusing overtones&quot;, while another commentator in &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; regarded the collection as having &quot;long been recognized as one of the world&#x27;s treasuries of art&quot;. One of the few detractors was Lewis Mumford, who felt that the other objects in the house diverted visitors&#x27; attention from the visual art.

A &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic wrote in 1941 that few other art collections in the U.S. &quot;so completely [exemplified] a great period in American art collecting&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote in 1969 that the Frick was one of the world&#x27;s best &quot;residence-museums&quot; along with the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum and the Wallace Collection. A critic for the &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot; said in 1971 that the collection&#x27;s paintings seemed to fit the building because Frick had &quot;to be sure &quot;he&quot; felt at home with &quot;them&quot;.&quot; Another critic, writing for &quot;The Post-Standard&quot; of Syracuse, New York, in 1975, praised the museum&#x27;s &quot;tranquility and superb decorative arts coupled with masterworks&quot;.

John Russell of the &quot;Times&quot; said in 1981 that &quot;The Frick is loved for its unpushy ways, for the largesse of its hospitality and for the high quality of what it has to show.&quot; In a review for the &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot; the same year, Madeline Lee wrote that the museum was special because of its courtyard and reflecting pool; another reviewer for the same newspaper said &quot;The Frick is the only museum I know whose collection consists almost exclusively of great or nearly great art.&quot; &quot;GQ&quot; magazine said that &quot;the most renowned—and probably best—combined house and art collection of a so-called &#x27;robber baron&#x27; is that of Henry Clay Frick&quot;. Bryan Miller of the &quot;Times&quot; wrote in 1987 that there were &quot;artistic gems in every room&quot;, and Grace Glueck of the same paper called it &quot;the enclave of masterpieces&quot;. A &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic in 1990 said the Frick Collection &quot;represents the aristocratic aspirations of turn-of-the-century robber barons&quot;. Another &quot;New York Times&quot; critic called the museum &quot;as frumpy and elegant as a dowager queen&quot;, describing the quality of its collection and the Frick House. A &quot;Globe and Mail&quot; reviewer said the museum was extremely peaceful and was &quot;a more comfortable museum than most&quot; because it used to serve as a residence.

=== 21st-century commentary ===
A 2000 poll by &quot;Travel Holiday&quot; magazine ranked the Frick Collection as the third-best art museum in the U.S. Upon the museum&#x27;s 75th anniversary in 2010, a &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; critic wrote that, although the museum lacked major shows and had not undergone a high-profile renovation, it &quot;quietly attracts a steady stream of about 300,000 visitors each year who come to see one of the most extraordinary assemblages of fine and decorative arts in the world&quot;. A reviewer for the &quot;Condé Nast Traveler&quot; wrote that the museum was &quot;exactly the right scale, everything in the collection is worth seeing, and can be viewed in an hour or less&quot;, while a &quot;New Yorker&quot; writer said that &quot;you feel more than welcomed—you feel invited, like a family friend&quot; at the Frick House. A critic for the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; wrote in 2014 that the Frick was &quot;the best small museum in New York, perfect if you don&#x27;t fancy dealing with a crush of people at MoMA or the Met&quot;.

When the museum was temporarily relocated to 945 Madison Avenue, one critic wrote that the temporary building was &quot;an exercise in contrasts&quot; with the Frick House&#x27;s decorations and that &quot;the vibe here is serious and meditative&quot;. Another critic wrote for &quot;Vogue&quot; that the Frick Madison was a &quot;shock to the senses in every way&quot; but that &quot;the collection comes directly to the fore&quot; amid that building&#x27;s bare walls. Writers for the &quot;Financial Times&quot; and the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; similarly said that the spartan setting helped highlight the collection itself.

<doc id="378248" wikidata="Q2721208" url="?curid=378248" title="Dizzy Up the Girl">
<text>Dizzy Up the Girl is the sixth studio album by American rock band the Goo Goo Dolls, released on September 22, 1998, through Warner Bros. Records. The album is often noted for being the release which propelled the Goo Goo Dolls into a higher tier of stardom, although they had already scored a &quot;Billboard&quot; top five hit with the downbeat track &quot;Name&quot; in 1995. &quot;Dizzy&quot; features more mainstream compositions than they had previously recorded. It is also the band&#x27;s first album to feature drummer Mike Malinin.

==History==
&quot;Dizzy Up the Girl&quot; is the Goo Goo Dolls&#x27; most successful album to date, selling over 4 million copies (4× platinum certified). The success of &quot;Dizzy Up the Girl&quot; can largely be attributed to the rock ballad &quot;Iris&quot;, which was also included in the soundtrack album of the film &quot;City of Angels&quot;. &quot;Iris&quot; immediately reached 1 on the Hot 100 Airplay chart upon its release in March from the &quot;City of Angels&quot; soundtrack, and stayed on top for 18 weeks, setting a record that still stands as of June 2017. The song also reached No. 1 on the Billboard Modern Rock chart, the Adult Top 40 and Mainstream Top 40 chart, along with several other charts in the US and UK, and received three Grammy nominations. The album sold very well, with &quot;Iris&quot; and &quot;Slide&quot; being the two most successful singles, while the other three singles achieved modest success.

In addition to the huge success of &quot;Iris&quot; (US No. 9), &quot;Dizzy Up the Girl&quot; included three additional top-40 singles, with the songs &quot;Slide&quot; (US #8), &quot;Broadway&quot; (US No. 24), and &quot;Black Balloon&quot; (US No. 16). The album also produced the moderately popular song &quot;Dizzy&quot;, which has since become a fan favorite. Along with top-40 single status, music videos for all five singles reached VH1&#x27;s Top 20 Music Videos chart upon release.

==Reception==

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic stated: &quot;Like a less mannered and conflicted &quot;Let Your Dim Light Shine&quot;-era Soul Asylum, the trio balances hard rockers with ballads. The difference is, they enjoy the mainstreaming of their music and respond with one of their catchiest sets of songs. There&#x27;s nothing new on the record apart from their willingness to polish their music so it reaches the widest audience. That will alienate whatever hardcore followers they have left, but that attitude will likely please anyone brought aboard with &#x27;Name&#x27; and &#x27;Iris&#x27;.&quot;

== Track listing ==
*In some countries the album was released with a bonus track, e.g. in Japan (&quot;Iris&quot; - Acoustic version) and in Germany (&quot;Name&quot;).

<text>The University of Padua (, UNIPD) is an Italian public research university in Padua, Italy. It was founded in 1222 by a group of students and teachers from the University of Bologna, who previously settled in Vicenza; thus, it is the second-oldest university in Italy, as well as the world&#x27;s fifth-oldest surviving university. 

The University of Padua was one of the most prominent universities in early modern Europe, known particularly for the rigor of its Aristotelian logic and science. Together with the University of Bologna, Padua had a central role in the Italian Renaissance, housing and educating a number of Italian Renaissance mathematicians, amongst them Nicolaus Copernicus. 

, it is made up of 32 departments and eight schools. Padua is part a network of historical research universities known as the Coimbra Group. In 2021, the university had approximately 72,000 students including undergraduates, postgraduates, and doctoral students.

==History==
The university is conventionally said to have been founded in 1222 when a large group of students and professors left the University of Bologna in search of more academic freedom (&#x27;Libertas scholastica&#x27;). Although it is certain that schools of law and medicine with students from various nations existed near Padua for a few years before 1222, more precisely in Vicenza. In reality, the first place where this group of students and professors from Bologna settled was at the University of Vicenza, where they were welcomed. Due to various vicissitudes the headquarters was permanently moved to Padua for various reasons. The first subjects to be taught were law and theology. The curriculum expanded rapidly, and by 1399 the institution had divided in two: a &quot;Universitas Iuristarum&quot; for civil law and Canon law, and a &quot;Universitas Artistarum&quot; which taught astronomy, dialectic, philosophy, grammar, medicine, and rhetoric. There was also a Universitas Theologorum, established in 1373 by Urban V.

The student body was divided into groups known as &quot;nations&quot; which reflected their places of origin. The nations themselves fell into two groups:
# the &quot;cismontanes&quot; for the Italian students
# the &quot;ultramontanes&quot; for those who came from beyond the Alps

From the fifteenth to the eighteenth century, the university was renowned for its research, particularly in the areas of medicine, astronomy, philosophy and law. At the time it was the most renowned school of medicine internationally. During this time, the university adopted the Latin motto: &quot;Universa universis patavina libertas&quot; (Paduan Freedom is Universal for Everyone). Nevertheless, the university had a turbulent history, and there was no teaching in 1237–1261, 1509–1517, 1848–1850.

The Botanical Garden of Padova, established by the university in 1545, is one of the oldest gardens of its kind in the world. Its alleged title of oldest academic garden is in controversy because the Medici created one in Pisa in 1544. In addition to the garden, best visited in the spring and summer, the university also manages nine museums, including a History of physics museum.
The university began teaching medicine around 1250. It played a leading role in the identification and treatment of diseases and ailments, specializing in autopsies and the inner workings of the body.

Since 1595, Padua&#x27;s famous anatomical theatre drew artists and scientists studying the human body during public dissections. It is the oldest surviving permanent anatomical theatre in Europe. Anatomist Andreas Vesalius held the chair of Surgery and Anatomy (&quot;explicator chirurgiae&quot;) and in 1543 published his anatomical discoveries in De Humani Corporis Fabrica. The book triggered great public interest in dissections and caused many other European cities to establish anatomical theatres.

On 25 June 1678, Elena Lucrezia Cornaro Piscopia, a Venetian noblewoman and mathematician, became the first woman to be awarded a Doctor of Philosophy degree.

The university became one of the universities of the Kingdom of Italy in 1873, and ever since has been one of the most prestigious in the country for its contributions to scientific and scholarly research: in the field of mathematics alone, its professors have included such figures as Gregorio Ricci Curbastro, Giuseppe Veronese, Francesco Severi and Tullio Levi Civita.

The last years of the nineteenth and the first half of the twentieth century saw a reversal of the centralisation process that had taken place in the sixteenth: scientific institutes were set up in what became veritable campuses; a new building to house the Arts and Philosophy faculty was built in another part of the city centre (&quot;Palazzo del Liviano&quot;, designed by Giò Ponti); the Astro-Physics Observatory was built on the Asiago uplands; and the old &quot;Palazzo del Bo&quot; was fully restored (1938–1945). The vicissitudes of the Fascist period—political interference, the Race Laws, etc.—had a detrimental effect upon the development of the university, as did the devastation caused by the Second World War and—just a few decades later—the effect of the student protests of 1968–1969 (which the university was left to face without adequate help and support from central government). However, the Gymnasium Omnium Disciplinarum continued its work uninterrupted, and overall the second half of the twentieth century saw a sharp upturn in development—primarily due an interchange of ideas with international institutions of the highest standing (particularly in the fields of science and technology).

In recent years, the university has been able to meet the problems posed by overcrowded facilities by re-deploying over the Veneto as a whole. In 1990, the Institute of Management Engineering was set up in Vicenza, after which the summer courses at Brixen (Bressanone) began once more, and in 1995 the Agripolis centre at Legnaro (for Agricultural Science and Veterinary Medicine) opened. Other sites of re-deployment are at Rovigo, Treviso, Feltre, Castelfranco Veneto, Conegliano, Chioggia and Asiago.

Recent changes in state legislation have also opened the way to greater autonomy for Italian universities, and in 1995 Padua adopted a new Statute that gave it greater independence.

As the publications of innumerable conferences and congresses show, the modern-day University of Padua plays an important role in scholarly and scientific research at both a European and world level. True to its origins, this is the direction in which the university intends to move in the future, establishing closer links of cooperation and exchange with all the world&#x27;s major research universities.

Since 2022, the University of Padua has been experiencing difficulties with the payments of scholarships for the &quot;right to study&quot;, thus leaving 1955 students (207 of that international students) without any kind of accommodation and receiving stipends.

== Organization and administration ==

=== Finances ===
The university foresaw a budget of €831 million for the 2023 fiscal year. Of this, €545 million were contributions paid by the Ministry of Education, University and Research of Italy, the European Union, local administrations like regions and provinces, and other entities. The remaining €232 million were classified as own revenues, of which €106 million came from tuition fees and €125 million from research-related income.

The amount of tuition students pay depends on their major, the financial situation of their household and if they take more time to graduate compared to the established length of their program. Tuition is also significantly lowered for non-EU citizens of certain developing countries. There are also scholarships and fee-waivers based on merit on other factors. Generally, most students who are graduating in time and are not from low income households will pay around €2,700/year for the 2023/24 academic year. 

== Rankings ==
The university is constantly ranked among the best Italian universities.

For 2023, in &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;″s &quot;World Best Global Universities Rankings&quot;, the University of Padua is ranked as the 1st place institution in Italy, taking 43rd place in Europe and the world&#x27;s 115th. ARWU ranks the university in the Italian top 4, tied for 2nd place with the University of Milan and the University of Pisa under the Sapienza University of Rome. ARWU ranks the university in the 151st-200th range globally for 2023.

The 2024 &quot;Times Higher Education World University Rankings&quot; lists the university at 4th place in Italy and in the 201st-250th range worldwide. QS World University Rankings ranks the university 4th in Italy in 2024 and the best in Italy to study geology and geophysics, earth and sea sciences, biological sciences, psychology, anatomy and physiology. It also places the University of Padua at 219th in the world for 2024. Also, according to QS World University Rankings, the University of Padua is ranked 125th in the field of Medicine.

The NTU ranking, which focuses on productivity and quality of scientific production, places the University of Padua as 82nd worldwide for 2022.

The CWTS Leiden Ranking, based exclusively on bibliometric indicators, places the University of Padua as 2nd place in Italy and 104th worldwide.

<text>Xiaolin Showdown is an American animated television series that aired on Kids&#x27; WB and was created by Christy Hui. Set in a world where martial arts battles and Eastern magic are commonplace, the series follows Omi, Raimundo, Kimiko, and Clay, four young Xiaolin warriors in training who, alongside their dragon companion Dojo, battle the Heylin forces of evil, especially series antagonists Jack Spicer, Wuya, and Chase Young. The Xiaolin warriors set to accomplish this by protecting Shen Gong Wu, a set of ancient artifacts that have great magical powers, from villains who could use them to conquer the world. Typical episodes revolve around a specific Shen Gong Wu and the resulting race on both sides to find it. Episodes often climax with one good and one evil character challenging one another to a magical duel called a Xiaolin Showdown for possession of the artifact.

Originally premiering on the Kids&#x27; WB block of programming on The WB on November 1, 2003, the series ran for 3 seasons with 52 episodes before its conclusion on May 13, 2006. The series aired in both reruns and second runs on Cartoon Network from 2006 to 2007. It was also confirmed to soon be airing on MeTV Toons. &quot;Xiaolin Showdown&quot; was a ratings hit for Kids&#x27; WB and led to the licensing of spin-off media including DVD releases, a trading card game, and a video game. The series won a Daytime Emmy Award in 2005 and was nominated for three additional Daytime Emmy Awards, one Annie Award, and one Golden Reel Award.

A follow-up series, &quot;Xiaolin Chronicles&quot;, previewed on August 26, 2013, on Disney XD and began its long-term run on September 14 the same year. The show aired for twenty episodes from August 26, 2013, to March 6, 2014, on Disney XD, leaving the last six episodes unaired in the United States until July 1, 2015, when &quot;Chronicles&quot; was made available to watch on Netflix.

==Plot==

===Season one===
Four young monks – Omi, Kimiko, Raimundo, and Clay – are forced into cooperation at the Xiaolin Temple after learning they are chosen to become Xiaolin Dragons. They become friends and work together traveling the world in search for Shen Gong Wu, mystical objects with powers that balance the forces of good and evil. Along the way, they must battle wannabe evil boy genius Jack Spicer, and the evil Heylin sorceress Wuya, whom Jack inadvertently frees from a 1500-year imprisonment in a puzzle box. Through thievery, Spicer gains enough Shen Gong Wu to form Mala Mala Jong, an ancient monster that Wuya uses to help her gain control of the world. Raimundo defies orders and fights the monster, causing the remaining monks to fight and defend the remaining Shen Gong Wu in the Temple&#x27;s possession. All the monks, except for Raimundo, are promoted to Xiaolin Apprentices. Angered, Raimundo joins the Heylin and helps Wuya regain her human form.

===Season two===
Omi travels back in time and receives a second puzzle box from Dashi. With no way back to the future, he freezes himself using the Orb of Tornami. In the present time, Omi breaks free of the ice with the puzzle box in hand. Raimundo decides that his rightful place belongs in the Xiaolin Temple with his friends and temporarily traps Wuya in the new puzzle box. After returning to the Temple, the monks continue their search for the Shen Gong Wu. Eventually, Raimundo is promoted to Xiaolin Apprentice.

Afterwards, the monks are introduced to Xiaolin monk-turned-evil villain Chase Young. Chase takes an interest in Omi and becomes determined to manipulate him into joining the Heylin. When Master Fung is trapped in the Ying-Yang World, Omi asks for help from Chase. He succeeds in rescuing Fung; however, upon leaving the Ying-Yang world, his bad chi takes over and he joins the Heylin. Chase succeeds in restoring Wuya to her human form, though he takes her powers. The remaining monks soon learn that Chase had sent Fung into the Ying-Yang World knowing the events that would unfold afterwards, including Omi joining his side.

===Season three===
Raimundo, Kimiko and Clay travel to the Ying-Yang World to retrieve Omi&#x27;s good chi and return him to the Xiaolin side. After gaining Omi back, the monks are promoted to Wudai Warriors. They are then introduced to Hannibal Roy Bean, a demon from the Ying-Yang World who is responsible for turning Chase Young to the Heylin side.

Toward the end of their journey, Master Fung tells the monks that they have one final quest before the team&#x27;s leader, the Shoku Warrior, will be revealed. Omi decides that he will stop Hannibal from turning Chase to the Heylin side. He ends up freezing himself to travel to the future and find the Sands of Time. Through time travel, he succeeds by switching the Lao Mang Long Soup with pea soup. However, when he returns to his present time, he learns that his actions have made things worse: instead of Chase joining the Heylin side, it is Chase&#x27;s former friend, Master Monk Guan, who Hannibal turns evil. The monks and Chase are captured by Hannibal, Wuya, and the evil Guan; Chase sacrifices his good self to save the monks and give them the opportunity to fight and return everything to the way it was. The monks succeed, and the timeline is fixed.

In the end, Raimundo is revealed as the Shoku Warrior. The series concludes with every villain attacking the temple, and the Wudai Warriors led by Raimundo proceeding to counterattack.

<text>Mieszko III ( 1122/25 – 13 March 1202), sometimes called the Old, was Duke of Greater Poland from 1138 and High Duke of Poland, with interruptions, from 1173 until his death.

He was the fourth and second surviving son of Duke Bolesław III Wrymouth of Poland, by his second wife Salomea, daughter of the German count Henry of Berg-Schelklingen.

==Early life==

According to the 1138 Testament of Bolesław III, Mieszko received the newly established Duchy of Greater Poland, comprising the western part of the short-lived Greater Poland. He had previously been duke of Poznań where he had his main residence. His older half-brother, Władysław II, the eldest son of the late duke with his first wife Zbyslava of Kiev, was proclaimed high duke and overlord of the Seniorate Province at Kraków, including the Greater Polish lands of Gniezno and Kalisz, as well as duke of Silesia.

==First conflict with Władysław II==
The first major conflict with the high duke took place during 1140–1141, when his younger half-brothers Bolesław IV the Curly and Mieszko III together with their mother but without Władysław&#x27;s knowledge divided between them the lands of Łęczyca, which were held only as a wittum by Bolesław&#x27;s widow Salomea for life and should revert to Władysław&#x27;s Seniorate Province upon her death.

In 1141 Salomea of Berg organized a meeting at Łęczyca, where she and her sons decided to marry their younger sister Agnes to one of the sons of Grand Prince Vsevolod II of Kiev in order to gain an ally against High Duke Władysław II. Only by Władysław&#x27;s rapid intervention did the independent plans of the junior dukes fail. Grand Prince Vsevolod II, facing the choice between an alliance with the strong high duke or the weak junior dukes and their mother, chose the former, which was sealed with the betrothal of Władysław&#x27;s eldest son, Bolesław I the Tall, to Vsevolod&#x27;s daughter, Zvenislava in 1142. Władysław II had not been invited to the Łęczyca meeting, despite the fact that as the high duke, he had the final voice on Agnes&#x27; engagement. In retaliation for this omission, he supported Kievan military actions against Salomea and her sons in the winter of 1142–1143. The first clash between the brothers was a complete success for the high duke.

==Second conflict with Władysław II==
On 27 July 1144, the Dowager Duchess Salomea died and High Duke Władysław II incorporated the Łęczyca Land into the Seniorate Province as intended by his father&#x27;s testament. This was again opposed by Bolesław IV and Mieszko III, who wished to give this land to their minor brother, Henry. Fighting took place in 1145. After an unexpected defeat, the high duke was finally able to obtain the victory (Battle of Pilicy), thanks to his Kievan allies.

An agreement was made under which Władysław retained Łęczyca. However, the high duke continued with his intention of reuniting all of Poland under his rule. This provoked the strong opposition from his Silesian voivode Piotr Włostowic, who support the interests of the junior dukes in order to maintain his own power and position. Władysław, instigated by his wife Agnes of Babenberg, decided to eliminate Włostowic for good. The voivode was captured in an ambush. Agnes demanded Włostowic&#x27;s death for treason, but the high duke instead chose a terrible punishment: Włostowic was blinded, muted, and expelled from the country. However, the voivode had numerous supporters, who were disgusted by this cruel act. Włostowic fled to the Kievan court, where he began to intrigue against the high duke, thus beginning Władysław&#x27;s downfall.

==Third conflict and exile of Władysław II==
The war erupted again in early 1146. This time, Władysław could not count on his Kievan allies, because they were busy with their own issues; in fact the high duke had sent some of his forces, led by his eldest son Bolesław, to support Great Prince Vsevolod. Władysław&#x27;s plight had made him swear allegiance to King Conrad III of Germany, half-brother of his wife Agnes. Nevertheless, Władysław was confident of his victory and it initially seemed that success was on his side, as Bolesław IV and Mieszko III, fearing clashes in an open field, escaped to Poznań. At this time the disaster to the high duke began.

Władysław&#x27;s cause lost support when he was excommunicated by Archbishop Jacob of Gniezno for his behavior against Piotr Włostowic. He also faced rebellion by his own subjects, who were against his tyrannical rule. The defeat of Władysław was total; by May 1146 all Poland was in the hands of the junior dukes. The former high duke and his family were forced to escape to save their lives, first to Bohemia and later to the Kaiserpfalz of Altenburg in Germany, under the protection of King Conrad III.

Once they had consolidated their rule over Poland, Bolesław IV and Mieszko III made new decisions. Bolesław, as the elder brother, succeeded Władysław as high duke and ruler over Silesia. Mieszko, on the other hand, retained his Duchy of Greater Poland and was satisfied with his role his brother&#x27;s ally. Henry, the next-born, finally received his Duchy of Sandomierz. Only the youngest brother, Casimir II, remained without lands.

Urged by his brother-in-law Władysław, King Conrad III of Germany attempted to restore the former high duke to the Polish throne. Eventually an agreement was reached under which King Conrad accepted the rule of Bolesław IV, and in return the new high duke had to pay a tribute to the German king. The dispute between Władysław and the junior dukes remained unresolved as King Conrad III was busy with the preparations for the Second Crusade to the Holy Land.

==Recognition of the junior duke&#x27;s authority==
Meanwhile, the junior dukes had no intention to just wait passively for an arrangement to consolidate their power. In May 1147 they received from Pope Eugene III the confirmation of a foundation for a monastery in Trzemeszno, which was a clear recognition of their sovereignty. In addition, they also sought to improve their relations with the German rulers.

In 1147, simultaneously with the arrival of King Conrad III to the Holy Land, Duke Mieszko III joined the Wendish Crusade against the pagan Polabian Slavs in the former Northern March, which was organized by the Ascanian count Albert the Bear and the Wettin margrave Conrad of Meissen. However, during this trip Mieszko III politically and militarily supported some Slavic tribes in an effort to protect Polish interests in the Sprevane lands against claims raised by the ambitious Duke Henry the Lion of Saxony. This assistance to pagans infuriated Albert the Bear, who arrived in Kruszwica in early 1148 to improve their alliance. Finally, they made an agreement, which was confirmed by the marriage of the junior dukes&#x27; sister Judith with Albert&#x27;s eldest son Otto.

==Expedition of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa==
To settle the dispute with Władysław II regarding the Polish throne, Bolesław IV, through the agency of Albert the Bear and Margrave Conrad, agreed to appear at the Imperial Diet in Merseburg in 1152 and pay homage to the newly elected king of Germany, King Conrad&#x27;s nephew Frederick Barbarossa. However, the high duke broke his promise and remained absent. Meanwhile, Frederick had to secure his rule in the Kingdom of Italy and his coronation as Holy Roman Emperor, wherefore he forged an alliance with Margrave Henry II of Austria, a scion of the House of Babenberg and brother of Władysław&#x27;s wife Agnes. This coalition brought the Polish affair back on the table.
The Polish campaign of Emperor Frederick began in 1157. For unknown reasons, Bolesław IV and Mieszko III did not try to defend the traditional frontier on the Oder River, but instead burned the castles of Głogów and Bytom and began their retreat into the depths of Greater Poland, where Bolesław&#x27;s forces finally surrendered to the Imperial troops at Krzyszkowo, near Poznań. After his defeat, the high duke had to ask for forgiveness from the Emperor and the junior dukes had to pay him a large tribute. On Christmas Day in Magdeburg, they promised to send food to the Emperor&#x27;s Italian expedition and to return the Silesia Province (at least). As a guarantee of the fulfillment, the junior dukes&#x27; younger brother, Casimir II, was sent to Germany as a hostage.

Frederick Barbarossa regarded the conflict as resolved and marched against Milan the next year. However, while the Emperor was engaged in the Italian affairs, Bolesław IV did nothing to fulfill the agreement. On 30 May 1159, Władysław II died in exile without having ever seen Poland again. Only renewed Imperial pressure enabled Władysław&#x27;s sons Bolesław the Tall and Mieszko IV Tanglefoot to come into their inheritance four years later, when the junior dukes finally returned Silesia to their nephews in 1163. The province thereby became the ancestral homeland of the Silesian Piasts.

==Death of Henry of Sandomierz and revolt of Casimir II the Just==
In 1166 Mieszko III and his brothers started another Prussian crusade, whereby Duke Henry of Sandomierz was killed in battle in October of that year. Before his departure, and in case of his death, he had left his duchy to his youngest brother Casimir II the Just, who by their father&#x27;s testament had remained without lands. However, High Duke Bolesław IV, against his late brother&#x27;s will, occupied Sandomierz and annexed it to his Seniorate Province.

This decision sparked the rebellion of Casimir II, which was supported by his brother Mieszko III; the magnate Jaksa of Miechów; Sviatoslav, son of Piotr Włostowic; Archbishop Jan I of Gniezno; and Bishop Gedko of Kraków. In February 1168 the rebels gathered at Jędrzejów, were Mieszko III was elected high duke and vested Casimir II with Sandomierz. The final defeat of Bolesław IV did not occur, however, because the high duke accepted the demands of the rebels and divided Henry&#x27;s duchy into three parts: Wiślica was given to Casimir, Bolesław took Sandomierz proper, and the rest was left to Mieszko.

==Inheritance dispute in Silesia==
In 1172 another conflict arose among the Silesian Piasts, when Duke Bolesław the Tall chose to ignore the claims of his first-born son, Jaroslaw, by designating his son from his second marriage, Henry I the Bearded, as his sole heir. When Jarosław, forced to become a priest, returned from his German exile, he claimed a share of the Silesian lands. Mieszko III supported his grandnephew in his demands, and a civil war was initiated.

In order to prevent another Imperial intervention, High Duke Bolesław IV sent Mieszko III to Magdeburg, with the sum of 8,000 pieces of silver as a tribute to the Emperor and the promise to resolve this conflict soon. This time, the terms of the 1173 agreement were to be strictly realized. Bolesław the Tall retained his power over Wrocław; however, he had to cede the Silesian Duchy of Opole to his son Jarosław for life and furthermore had to agree on the division of the remaining Silesian lands with his younger brother Mieszko Tanglefoot, who assumed the rule in the new Duchy of Racibórz.

==High Duke of Poland==

After his brother Bolesław IV died on 3 April 1173, Mieszko III became the new high duke of Poland (&quot;dux Totius Poloniae&quot;) according to the principle of agnatic seniority. His policy focused on maintaining full power for himself, as the oldest surviving member of the dynasty. Despite his succession to the throne at Kraków, the new high duke remained in Greater Poland, while Lesser Poland was ruled by Henryk Kietlicz as a governor appointed by Mieszko. Harsh tax measures were introduced, which incurred the displeasure of the Lesser Polish magnates. On the other hand, Mieszko had several foreign policy successes through his daughter&#x27;s marriages: Elisabeth married Duke Soběslav II of Bohemia circa 1173, and through the dynastic arrangement between his daughter Anastasia and the Griffin duke Bogislaw I of Pomerania, Mieszko reinforced Polish sovereignty over the Pomeranian duchy.

In 1177 Mieszko III&#x27;s first-born son, Odon, fearing for his inheritance, rebelled against his father. He was supported by Bishop Gedko of Kraków, his cousin Bolesław the Tall, and his uncle Casimir II the Just. For Odon, the main reason for his rebellion was the favoritism of Mieszko to the offspring of his second marriage and the attempts of the high duke to force him to become a priest so as to eliminate him from succession. To the other rebels, the reason was the harsh and dictatorial government of the high duke. The rebellion was a complete surprise to Mieszko; during Easter of 1177 he was totally convinced of the loyalty of his relatives, especially when the junior dukes organized a meeting at Gniezno, were the high duke was received by the crowds with cheers.

At first Greater Poland remained strongly in Mieszko&#x27;s hands, thanks to his governor Henryk Kietlicz, his most important follower. At the same time, Casimir II the Just, the clear head of the rebellion, made a divisionary treaty with his allies: all of Silesia was granted to Duke Bolesław the Tall and Greater Poland was given to Odon. This was a significant complication, because since 1173 Bolesław had ruled Silesia alongside his brother Mieszko Tanglefoot and his own son Jarosław of Opole. After they learned of this agreement, both Mieszko Tanglefoot and Jarosław sided with the high duke and rebelled against Bolesław the Tall, who now, busy fighting with his brother and son, lost the opportunity to gain Kraków and obtain the Seniorate Province for himself. In his place, it was Casimir II the Just who took control over the Seniorate Province, and, with this, was proclaimed the new high duke of Poland. After not seeing any possibility of continuing the resistance, Mieszko escaped to Racibórz, under the protection of his nephew and namesake Duke Mieszko Tanglefoot. However, shortly afterwards the deposed high duke decided to leave Poland and seek foreign support. Odon finally occupied all Greater Poland and was declared duke.

==Exile and return to Greater Poland==

By 1179, Mieszko went to Bohemia, ruled by his son-in-law Soběslav II, who nevertheless refused to help him. Mieszko then turned to Germany and Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, who offered help in his restoration on the Polish throne upon a payment of 10,000 pieces of silver, a sum that Mieszko couldn&#x27;t amass. Finally in Pomerania, his other son-in-law Duke Bogislaw I agreed to help him. By the agency of his Pomeranian allies, Mieszko forged links with their Polish followers, grouped around Zdzisław, Archbishop of Gniezno, and in 1181 he was able to conquer the eastern Greater Polish lands of Gniezno and Kalisz, which at that time were part of the Seniorate Province. Soon after, Mieszko also managed to recover western Greater Poland, and Odon was pushed to the lands south of the Obra River. In 1182 a formal reconciliation between father and son was achieved. During these events, and for unknown reasons, High Duke Casimir II the Just remained in total passivity; thanks to this, Mieszko had the opportunity to recover all Greater Poland.

Mieszko still had the intention to recover the lordship over all Poland. In 1184 he tried to forge an alliance with Frederick Barbarossa&#x27;s son, King Henry VI of Germany, offering him a large sum of silver. Casimir II the Just, however, knew his intentions and had simply sent Henry more money than Mieszko.

After his failure with the German king, Mieszko decided to take control over Masovia and Kuyavia, then ruled by his nephew Leszek, the only surviving son of Bolesław IV. Mieszko convinced Leszek to name him as his successor if he died without issue. However in 1185, one year before his death, Leszek changed his testament and appointed his younger uncle High Duke Casimir II the Just as his successor, possibly as a result of the harsh proceedings of the Duke of Greater Poland. This time Mieszko acted quickly, and upon Leszek&#x27;s death in 1186 he took the Kuyavia region and annexed it to his Duchy. Shortly thereafter he ceded this land to his son Bolesław.

==Brief restoration==
In 1191 the foreign policy of High Duke Casimir II the Just triggered dissatisfaction in the Lesser Poland nobility, led by Mieszko&#x27;s former governor Henry Kietlicz. With the help of this opposition, Mieszko could finally reconquer Kraków and resume the High Ducal title. He decided to entrust the government of Kraków to one of his sons, either Bolesław or Mieszko the Younger. Casimir, however, quickly regained Kraków and the overlordship and the Prince-Governor was captured; however, he was soon released to be with his father. Probably after the failed expedition over Kraków, Mieszko gave to his son and namesake Mieszko the Younger the Greater Polish lands of Kalisz as his own duchy.

When on 2 August 1193 Mieszko the Younger died, his Duchy of Kalisz reverted to the lands of Greater Poland. Shortly thereafter, Mieszko III granted Kalisz to his elder son Odon, who then died eight months later on 20 April 1194. These two early deaths forced Mieszko to make a new divisionary treaty: the duke retained Kalisz for himself, while southern Greater Poland was given to his youngest son Władysław III Spindleshanks, who also assumed the guardianship of the minor son of Odon, Władysław Odonic.

High Duke Casimir II the Just died on 5 May 1194, and Mieszko&#x27;s pretensions over Lesser Poland were reborn. Unfortunately, this time the local nobility preferred to see on the throne the minor sons of Casimir, Leszek the White and Konrad. Mieszko&#x27;s attempts to retake the power ended at the bloody Battle of Mozgawa on 13 September 1195, where Mieszko himself was seriously injured and his son Bolesław of Kuyavia died. After the battle Mieszko withdrew to Kalisz without waiting for the Silesian troops of his allies, Mieszko Tanglefoot and Jarosław of Opole.

==Final settlement==
The Battle of Mozgawa convinced Mieszko that to gain the throne through battle was extremely difficult, so he began to negotiate with the high duke&#x27;s widow, Helen of Znojmo. In 1198 he finally was allowed to return to Lesser Poland, but was compelled to cede Kuyavia to Casimir&#x27;s sons.

In 1199, the voivode Mikołaj Gryfita and Bishop Fulko of Kraków again deposed Mieszko and restored Leszek the White as high duke; however, three years later a new settlement was made and Mieszko was able to return. He retained the title of high duke, but was forced to give up part of his powers. He died shortly afterwards; at that time, he had survived all his siblings and his sons except for Władysław III Spindleshanks, who succeeded him as Polish high duke and duke of Greater Poland.

==Marriages and issue==
Around 1136, Mieszko married firstly with Elisabeth (b. ca. 1128 – d. ca. 1154), daughter of King Béla II of Hungary. They had:
#Odon (b. ca. 1149 – d. 20 April 1194)

#Judith (b. bef. 1154 – d. af. 12 December 1201), married ca. 1173 to Bernhard of Anhalt, later duke of Saxony

By 1154, Mieszko married secondly with Eudoxia of Kiev (b. ca. 1131 – d. aft. 1187), possibly a daughter of Grand Prince Iziaslav II of Kiev. They had:
#Bolesław (b. 1159 – killed in the Battle of Mozgawą, 13 September 1195)
#Mieszko the Younger (b. ca. 1160/65 – d. 2 August 1193)
#Władysław III Spindleshanks (b. ca. 1161/67 – d. 3 November 1231)
#Salomea (b. ca. 1162/64 – d. 11 May ca. 1183), married bef. 1177 to Prince Ratibor (II) of Pomerania.

<text>The Creatures were an English band formed in 1981 by vocalist Siouxsie Sioux and drummer Budgie both members of the group Siouxsie and the Banshees. Their music, initially based on drums and voice, evolved over the years. The Creatures released their first EP &quot;Wild Things&quot; in 1981. On their debut album &quot;Feast&quot; (1983) including a UK top 25 single &quot;Miss the Girl&quot;, the band embraced exotica while keeping percussion as the main instrument. On their second album &quot;Boomerang&quot; (1989) which was widely critically acclaimed, the duo married their music with blues and jazz; &quot;Uncut&quot; magazine would later rank &quot;Boomerang&quot; at number 184 in their list of &quot;the 500 Greatest Albums of the 1980s&quot;. In the late 1990s, they developed a more urban sound on &quot;Anima Animus&quot;; &quot;The Times&quot; then described their music as &quot;adventurous art rock built around Siouxsie&#x27;s extraordinary voice and drummer Budgie&#x27;s battery of percussion&quot;. For their last album &quot;Hái!&quot; (2003), they returned to their roots while turning to east, with an ode to Japanese minimalism. They disbanded in 2005.

Their music was praised by Jeff Buckley, PJ Harvey, Anohni, and name-checked by Neil Hannon of the Divine Comedy.

==Formation and &quot;Wild Things&quot; EP (1981)==
Singer Siouxsie Sioux and drummer Budgie created the Creatures in 1981 while rehearsing for Banshees&#x27; &quot;Juju&quot; album. During one session, they discovered by accident that the combination of just voice and drums suited the track &quot;But Not Them&quot;. A studio session was organized with the aim of recording five songs. This project was released in the form of an EP titled &quot;Wild Things&quot;. The title track was a reworking of a hit by the Troggs; the other numbers were Creatures compositions. The EP reached No. 24 in the UK Singles Chart and the pair performed &quot;Mad-Eyed Screamer&quot; on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;.

==&quot;Feast&quot; (1983)==
In 1983, the Creatures released their first full-length album, &quot;Feast&quot;. The band had decided where to record the album by randomly placing a pin on a map of the world. The result was Hawaii, which led to the Lamalani Hula Academy Hawaiian Chanters being featured on some tracks. Musically, the album was steeped in exotica and tropical backdrops. During the week of its release, the band were on the front cover of both &quot;Melody Maker&quot; and &quot;NME&quot;. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; described &quot;Feast&quot; as &quot;an album of filtered brilliance, fertile, sensual and erotic&quot;, while &quot;NME&quot; said, &quot;The humours of Sioux&#x27;s frosty larynx are nakedly outlined against skins of sometimes fabulous quality&quot;. The album reached No. 17 in the UK Albums Chart. The single &quot;Miss the Girl&quot; which peaked at number 21 in the UK chart, took its inspiration from the book &quot;Crash&quot; by J. G. Ballard. Shortly after its exit from the charts, a follow-up, &quot;Right Now&quot;, was recorded, a song that was initially performed by Mel Tormé. The Creatures revamped it by adding a brass section, and it became their most successful single, reaching the top 15.

==&quot;Boomerang&quot; (1989–1990)==
The Creatures reconvened six years later. Siouxsie and Budgie went to a stone barn in Jerez, Andalucia, Spain to record &quot;Boomerang&quot;, an album which blended their music with blues, jazz, flamenco and electronia. Brass arrangements featured on some tracks and Anton Corbijn took colour pictures for the sleeve. The record received widespread critical acclaim. &quot;NME&quot; wrote: &quot;It&#x27;s a rich and unsettling landscape of exotica&quot;. One of the bluesier songs on &quot;Boomerang&quot;, &quot;Killing Time&quot;, was later covered live by Jeff Buckley. On 4 December 1989, the band performed live &quot;Standing There&quot; and &quot;You!&quot; with a brass section for UK TV Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Big World Cafe&quot;. The Creatures then rehearsed with other musicians to play a rearranged version of &quot;Pluto Drive&quot; with Budgie exceptionally on keyboards, for UK TV Show &quot;One Hour with Jonathan Ross&quot;.

In the US, the single &quot;Standing There&quot; was popular on alternative radio stations, reaching No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart, staying in the top 10 for 14 weeks. &quot;Fury Eyes&quot; was remixed by Pascal Gabriel for a single release: &quot;Fury Eyes&quot; also received a lot of radio airplay on US alternative radio and reached number 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Alternative Chart. During February and March 1990, the Creatures toured for the first time in the UK, Europe and the US: they chose to appear as a duo on stage helped with technology and sequencers.

==Collaboration with John Cale and &quot;Eraser Cut&quot; EP (1996–1998)==

When Siouxsie and the Banshees ended in 1996, the Creatures had already begun composing new material. At the same time, the long-out-of-print &quot;Wild Things&quot; EP and &quot;Feast&quot; album were remastered and re-released through the compilation &quot;A Bestiary Of&quot;.

In February 1998, former Velvet Underground member John Cale, then organizing the &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends&quot; festival at the Paradiso in Amsterdam, contacted the Creatures for a collaboration. The concert, shown on Dutch national television, featured an unreleased Creatures song, &quot;Murdering Mouth&quot;, composed for the event and sung in duet with Cale. That night, the Creatures also premiered a live orchestra version of &quot;I Was Me&quot; with Cale on viola. In May, Siouxsie and Budgie appeared on British Television show &quot;Later With Jools Holland&quot; with two bass players on their side to perform live two other songs &quot;Disconnected&quot; and &quot;Prettiest Thing&quot; from the forthcoming album.

During that period, Siouxsie and Budgie created their own label, Sioux Records, and became an independent act. A stand-alone single, &quot;Sad Cunt&quot;, was offered to attendees of two warm-up concerts in London in May prior to the North American tour. From June to August, the pair toured the United States as a double bill with John Cale, playing yet unreleased material: Siouxsie and Cale also sang several songs together each night. The &quot;LA Times&quot; reviewed the tour as an &quot;inventive, spirited show&quot;, saying: &quot;Cale and the Creatures’ inspired performance struck a perfect balance&quot;. An EP, &quot;Eraser Cut&quot; (an anagram of &quot;Creatures&quot;), then came out; &quot;Time Out&quot; described the songs as &quot;short, sharp, percussive and infectiously atmospheric&quot;. In October, they promoted the single &quot;2nd Floor&quot; with a video mostly shot in black and white.

==&quot;Anima Animus&quot; (1999–2002)==
Early in 1999, the Creatures released &quot;Anima Animus&quot;, their first studio album in just under a decade. Its urban sound with the introduction of guitars, and synthesizers laced with electronica, was a departure from &quot;Boomerang&quot;″s organic atmosphere. &quot;The Times&quot; wrote about &quot;Anima Animus&quot;: &quot;It&#x27;s entrancing, hypnotic and inventive&quot;, and peer PJ Harvey later selected it in her 10 favourite albums released in 1999.
Other singles from the album were &quot;Say&quot; (dedicated to Billy Mackenzie) and &quot;Prettiest Thing&quot;. The song &quot;Another Planet&quot; was included on the soundtrack to the film &quot;Lost in Space&quot; in a version radically reworked by Juno Reactor. Live albums &quot;Zulu&quot; (recorded in London in 1998) and &quot;Sequins in the Sun&quot; (recorded at the Glastonbury festival in 1999) were released on limited editions via the Creatures website.

In June, the Creatures appeared on Marc Almond&#x27;s &quot;Open All Night&quot;; Siouxsie duetted with Almond and Budgie added percussion on the track &quot;Threat of Love&quot;. In late 1999, the remix album &quot;Hybrids&quot; was issued, featuring remixes by other acts including the Beloved.

In 2000, a compilation of unreleased &quot;Anima Animus&quot;-era tracks was released as &quot;U.S. Retrace&quot;. It featured the B-side &quot;All She Could Ask For&quot;, which was the opening number for all their concerts during that period. Three one-track CDs – &quot;Murdering Mouth&quot; (live), &quot;Rocket Ship&quot; and &quot;Red Wrapping Paper&quot; – were distributed to fan club members.

==&quot;Hái!&quot; and break-up (2003–2004)==
Siouxsie and Budgie returned with a full-length album, &quot;Hái!&quot;, in 2003. The drum sessions were recorded in Japan less than 24 hours after the Banshees had completed their &quot;Seven Year Itch&quot; reunion tour. Budgie first worked with the Japanese taiko drummer Leonard Eto (previously of the Kodo Drummers): their spontaneous drum duet formed the basis of the album. The rest of the sessions were done in France over a period of several months. The single &quot;Godzilla!&quot; was described as &quot;spookily brilliant&quot; by &quot;NME&quot;, and reviews were favourable for &quot;Hái!&quot;. The opening track &quot;Say Yes&quot; was used during the trailer for the 2004 season of &quot;The Sopranos&quot;.

In 2004, Siouxsie toured for the first time billed as a solo act, but with Budgie still as drummer and musical arranger. The setlists combined Banshees and Creatures songs. A live DVD called &quot;Dreamshow&quot; documented the last London concert of September 2004 performed with the Millennia Ensemble. Released in August 2005, this DVD reached No. 1 in the UK music DVD chart.

&quot;Dreamshow&quot; was the last release by the pair, as Siouxsie announced publicly during a 2007 interview with &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; that she and Budgie had divorced.

<text>Susan Janet Ballion (born 27 May 1957), better known by her stage name Siouxsie Sioux (, ), is an English singer and songwriter. She came to prominence as the leader and main lyricist of the rock band Siouxsie and the Banshees, who were active from 1976 to 1996. They released 11 studio albums, and had several UK Top 20 singles including &quot;Hong Kong Garden&quot;, &quot;Happy House&quot; and &quot;Peek-a-Boo&quot;, plus a US Top 25 single in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, with &quot;Kiss Them for Me&quot;.

Siouxsie also formed a second group, the Creatures, in 1981. With the Creatures, she released four studio albums and singles such as &quot;Right Now&quot;. After disbanding the Creatures in the mid-2000s, she has continued as a solo artist, using just the name Siouxsie, and released the album &quot;Mantaray&quot; to critical acclaim in 2007.

AllMusic named Siouxsie as &quot;one of the most influential British singers of the rock era&quot;. Her songs have been covered by Jeff Buckley (&quot;Killing Time&quot;), Tricky (&quot;Tattoo&quot;) and LCD Soundsystem (&quot;Slowdive&quot;) and sampled by Massive Attack (&quot;Metal Postcard&quot;) and the Weeknd (&quot;Happy House&quot;). In 2011, she was awarded for Outstanding Contribution to Music at the Q Awards and in 2012, she received the Inspiration Award at the Ivor Novello Awards.

==Biography ==
===Early life (1957–1976)===
Siouxsie was born Susan Janet Ballion on 27 May 1957 at Guy&#x27;s Hospital in Southwark, England. She is ten years younger than her two siblings. Her sister and brother were born while the family was in the Belgian Congo. Her parents met in that colony and worked there for a few years. Her mother, Betty, was of Scottish and English descent and was a secretary who spoke both French and English. Her father was a bacteriologist who milked venom from snakes, and came from Wallonia, the French-speaking part of Belgium. In the mid-1950s, before Siouxsie&#x27;s birth, the family moved to England.

The Ballions lived in a suburban district in Chislehurst, Kent. Siouxsie was an isolated child, being unable to invite friends to her house because of her alcoholic, unemployed father. Despite his issues, Siouxsie regarded him as intelligent and well-read, and sympathised with his inability to fit in with a &quot;rigid, middle-class society&quot;. During moments of sobriety, her father shared with her his love for books. Siouxsie was aware that her family was different; the Ballions were not involved in the local community and Siouxsie, aware that her family&#x27;s house differed from the neighbours&#x27;, would later state that &quot;the suburbs inspired intense hatred.&quot;

At the age of nine, she and a friend were allegedly sexually assaulted by a stranger in a park. The assault was ignored by both her parents and the police, and was not spoken of in the family. The incident and the way it was treated led Siouxsie to distrust adults. Years later, she stated: I grew up having no faith in adults as responsible people. And being the youngest in the family I was isolated – I had no one to confide in. So I invented my own world, my own reality. It was my own way of defending myself – protecting myself from the outside world. The only way I could deal with how to survive was to get some strong armour.

Her father died of alcoholism-related illness when Siouxsie was 14 years old, resulting in a decline in her health. Siouxsie lost a great deal of weight and failed to attend school. After several misdiagnoses, she was operated on and survived a bout of ulcerative colitis. During the weeks of recovery in mid-1972, she watched television in the hospital and saw David Bowie on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;.

At 17, she left school. During this period she began visiting the local gay discos frequented by her sister&#x27;s friends. She later introduced her own friends to that scene. In November 1975, the Sex Pistols performed at the local art college in Chislehurst. Siouxsie did not attend, but one of her friends told her they sounded like the Stooges, and that singer Johnny Rotten had threatened students attending the gig. In February 1976, Siouxsie and her friend Steven Severin went to see the Sex Pistols play in London. After chatting with members of the band, Siouxsie and Severin decided to follow them regularly. In the following months, journalist Caroline Coon coined the term &quot;Bromley Contingent&quot; to describe this group of eccentric teenagers devoted to the Sex Pistols.

Siouxsie became well known in the London club scene for her glam, fetish- and bondage-inspired attire, which later became part of punk fashion. She would also heavily influence the later development of gothic fashion with her signature cat-eye makeup, deep red lipstick, spiky dyed-black hair, and black clothing. In early September 1976, the Bromley Contingent followed the Sex Pistols to France, where Siouxsie was beaten up for wearing a cupless bra and a black armband with a swastika on it. She claimed her intent was to shock the older generation, not to make a political statement. She later wrote the song &quot;Metal Postcard (Mittageisen)&quot; (in memory of the anti-Nazi artist John Heartfield).

Following the DIY ethos and the idea that the people in the audience could be the people on stage, Siouxsie and Severin decided to form a band. When a support slot at the 100 Club Punk Festival (organised by Malcolm McLaren) opened up, they decided to make an attempt at performing, although at that time they did not know how to play any songs. On 20 September 1976, the band improvised 20 minutes of music while Siouxsie sang the &quot;Lord&#x27;s Prayer&quot;.

For critic Jon Savage, Siouxsie was &quot;unlike any female singer before or since, commanding yet aloof, entirely modern&quot;. Viv Albertine from the Slits said: Siouxsie just appeared fully made, fully in control, utterly confident. It totally blew me away. There she was doing something that I dared to dream but she took it and did it and it wiped the rest of the festival for me, that was it. I can&#x27;t even remember everything else about it except that one performance.

One of Siouxsie&#x27;s first public appearances was with the Sex Pistols on Bill Grundy&#x27;s television show, on Thames Television in December 1976. Standing next to the band, Siouxsie made fun of the presenter when he asked her how she was doing. She responded: &quot;I&#x27;ve always wanted to meet you, Bill.&quot; Grundy, who later claimed he was drunk, suggested a meeting after the show, which provoked guitarist Steve Jones to respond with a series of expletives inappropriate for prime-time television. This episode created a media furore on the front covers of several tabloids, including the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, which published the headline &quot;Siouxsie&#x27;s a Punk Shocker&quot;. The event had a major impact on the Sex Pistols&#x27; subsequent career, and they became a household name overnight.

Aware of the press surrounding both herself and the Sex Pistols, Siouxsie began to distance herself from the scene and stopped seeing the Sex Pistols after the 15 December 1976 gig at Notre Dame Hall. From then, she focused her energy on her own band, Siouxsie and the Banshees.

===Siouxsie and the Banshees, and the Creatures (1977–2003)===
In 1977, Siouxsie and the Banshees toured the UK, with Severin on bass, Kenny Morris on drums and John McKay on guitar. One year later, their first single, &quot;Hong Kong Garden&quot; reached number 7 in the UK Singles Chart. With its oriental-inflected xylophone motif, &quot;Melody Maker&quot; deemed it &quot;a glorious debut [...] All the elements come together with remarkable effect. The song is strident and powerful with tantalising oriental guitar riffs plus words and vocals that are the result of anger, disdain and isolation. No-one will be singled out because everyone is part and parcel of the whole. It might even be a hit&quot;.

Their debut album, &quot;The Scream&quot;, was one of the first post-punk records released. It received 5-star reviews in &quot;Sounds&quot; and &quot;Record Mirror&quot;. The latter said that the record &quot;points to the future, real music for the new age&quot;. The music was different from the single; it was angular, dark and jagged. &quot;The Scream&quot; was later hailed by &quot;NME&quot; as one of the best debut albums of all time along with Patti Smith&#x27;s &quot;Horses&quot;. &quot;Join Hands&quot; followed in 1979 with war as the lyrical theme.

The 1980 album &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; marked the arrival of John McGeoch, considered &quot;one of the most innovative and influential guitarists&quot; by &quot;The Guardian&quot;, and drummer Budgie, who continued to perform and record with Siouxsie until 2004. The hit single &quot;Happy House&quot; was qualified as &quot;great Pop&quot; with &quot;liquid guitar&quot; and other songs like &quot;Red Light&quot; were layered with electronic sounds. &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; widened Siouxsie&#x27;s audience, reaching the top 5 in the UK Albums Chart. &quot;Juju&quot; followed in 1981, reaching number 7; the singles &quot;Spellbound&quot; and &quot;Arabian Knights&quot; were described as &quot;pop marvels&quot; by &quot;The Guardian&quot;. During recording sessions for &quot;Juju&quot;, Siouxsie and Budgie formed a second band the Creatures, a duo characterized by a stripped-down sound focused on vocals and drums; their first record, the EP &quot;Wild Things&quot;, was a commercial success. &quot;Record Mirror&quot;
reviewed it as an &quot;astonishingly successful exercise. Several Siouxsie voices over Budgie&#x27;s quite magnificent drums and percussion make up the entire fabric but it never sounds sparse... A surprise and a triumph.&quot;

In 1982, the Siouxsie and the Banshees&#x27; album &quot;A Kiss in the Dreamhouse&quot; was widely acclaimed by critics. Richard Cook of &quot;NME&quot; depicted it as &quot;a feat of imagination scarcely ever recorded&quot;. The single &quot;Slowdive&quot; was &quot;a violin-colored dance beat number&quot;. They included strings for the first time on several songs. The recording sessions took their toll, and McGeoch was forced to quit the band.

In 1983, Siouxsie went to Hawaii to record the Creatures&#x27; first album, &quot;Feast&quot;, which included the hit single &quot;Miss the Girl&quot;. It was her first incursion into exotica, incorporating sounds of waves, local Hawaiian choirs and local percussion. Later that year, Siouxsie and Budgie released &quot;Right Now&quot;, a song from Mel Tormé&#x27;s repertoire that the Creatures re-orchestrated with brass arrangements; &quot;Right Now&quot; soon became a top 20 hit single in the UK. Then, with the Banshees (including guitarist Robert Smith of the Cure), she covered the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Dear Prudence&quot;, which reached number 3 on the UK Singles Chart. Two albums followed with Smith: &quot;Nocturne&quot;, recorded live in London in 1983, and 1984&#x27;s &quot;Hyæna&quot;. In 1985, the single &quot;Cities in Dust&quot; was recorded with sequencers; it climbed to number 21 in the UK charts. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; noted that it was the first of a handful of Alternative rock radio hits in the US. 1986&#x27;s &quot;Tinderbox&quot; and the 1987 covers album &quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot; both reached the top 15 in the UK.

In 1988, the single &quot;Peek-a-Boo&quot; marked a musical departure from her previous work, anticipating hip hop-inspired rock with the use of samples. &quot;NME&quot; called it an &quot;oriental marching band hip hop with farting horns and catchy accordion&quot; and &quot;Melody Maker&quot; &quot;a brightly unexpected mixture of black steel and pop disturbance&quot;. The &quot;Peepshow&quot; album received a five star review in &quot;Q&quot; magazine. The ballad &quot;The Last Beat of My Heart&quot; issued as a single, saw her using accordion and strings.

Siouxsie and Budgie then went to Andalusia in Spain to record the second Creatures album, &quot;Boomerang&quot;. The songs featured backing music ranging from flamenco to jazz and blues styles and brass on most songs. The first single was &quot;Standing There&quot;. &quot;NME&quot; called &quot;Boomerang&quot; &quot;a rich and unsettling landscape of exotica&quot;. Anton Corbijn visited the group during the recording near Jerez de la Frontera, and Siouxsie convinced him to take photographs in colour, unlike his prior work which was in black-and-white: the photos used for the promotion showed Siouxsie and Budgie in fields surrounded with sunflowers. In 1990, she toured for the first time with the Creatures, in Europe and North America.

On 1991&#x27;s dance-oriented &quot;Kiss Them for Me&quot; single, Siouxsie and the Banshees used South Asian instrumentation, which had become popular in the UK club scene with the growth of bhangra. Indian tabla player Talvin Singh (who was later Björk&#x27;s percussionist on her 1993 &quot;Debut&quot; album) took part in the session and provided vocals for the bridge. With &quot;Kiss Them for Me&quot;, the Banshees scored a hit on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 peaking at number 23. After the release of &quot;Superstition&quot; which received enthusiastic reviews, the group co-headlined the first Lollapalooza tour.
In 1992, film director Tim Burton requested that she write a song for &quot;Batman Returns&quot;, and the Banshees composed the single &quot;Face to Face&quot;.

In the mid-1990s, Siouxsie started to do one-off collaborations with other artists. Suede invited her to a benefit concert for the Red Hot Organization. With guitarist Bernard Butler, she performed a version of Lou Reed&#x27;s &quot;Caroline Says&quot;. &quot;Spin&quot; reviewed it as &quot;haughty and stately&quot;. Morrissey, ex-lead singer of the Smiths, recorded a duet with Siouxsie in 1994: they both sang on the single &quot;Interlude&quot;, a track that was initially performed by Timi Yuro, a female torch singer of the 1960s. &quot;Interlude&quot; was released under the banner &quot;Morrissey and Siouxsie&quot;.

The last Banshees studio album, &quot;The Rapture&quot;, was released in 1995; it was written partly in Toulouse, where she had recently moved. After the accompanying tour, the Banshees announced their split during a press conference called &quot;20 Minutes into 20 Years&quot;. The Creatures became her only band. At the same time, she released the song &quot;The Lighthouse&quot; on French producer Hector Zazou&#x27;s album &quot;Chansons des mers froides&quot; (which translates to &quot;Songs from the Cold Seas&quot;), with jazz trumpetist Mark Isham. Siouxsie and Zazou adapted the poem &quot;Flannan Isle&quot; by English poet Wilfred Wilson Gibson.

In February 1998 former Velvet Underground member John Cale invited her to a festival called &quot;With a Little Help From My Friends&quot; at the Paradiso in Amsterdam. The concert was shown on Dutch national television and featured an unreleased Creatures composition, &quot;Murdering Mouth&quot;, sung as a duet with Cale. The two toured the US from June until August, performing &quot;Murdering Mouth&quot;, and Cale&#x27;s &quot;Gun&quot; together as the encores of a Creatures and Cale double bill.

The following year, Siouxsie and Budgie released &quot;Anima Animus&quot;, the first Creatures album since the split of the Banshees. It included the singles &quot;2nd Floor&quot; and &quot;Prettiest Thing&quot;. The material had an urban sound, blending art rock and electronica. &quot;Anima Animus&quot; was described by &quot;The Times&quot; as &quot;hypnotic and inventive&quot;. Also in 1999, Siouxsie collaborated with Marc Almond on the track &quot;Threat of Love&quot;.

In 2002, she did a short reunion tour with the Banshees titled &quot;The Seven Year Itch&quot;. That same year, Universal released &quot;The Best of Siouxsie and the Banshees&quot; as the first reissue of her back catalogue.

In 2003, Siouxsie and Budgie released the last Creatures album, &quot;Hái!&quot;, which was in part recorded in Japan, collaborating with taiko player Leonard Eto (previously of the Kodo Drummers). Peter Wratts wrote in &quot;Time Out&quot;: &quot;Her voice is the dominant instrument here, snaking and curling around the bouncing drumming backdrop, elegiac and inhuman as she chants, purrs and whispers her way around the album&quot;. He called the record a &quot;spine-tingling achievement&quot;. &quot;Hái!&quot; was preceded by the single &quot;Godzilla!&quot;. That year, Siouxsie was featured on the track &quot;Cish Cash&quot; by Basement Jaxx, from their album &quot;Kish Kash&quot;, which won Best Electronic/Dance Album at the &quot;Grammy Awards&quot;.

===Solo (2004–present)===
In 2004 Siouxsie toured for the first time as a solo act, playing Banshees and Creatures songs. A live DVD called &quot;Dreamshow&quot; was recorded at the last London concert, in which she and her musicians were accompanied by a 16-piece orchestra, the Millennia Ensemble. Released in August 2005, this DVD reached number 1 in the UK music DVD chart.

Her first solo album, &quot;Mantaray&quot;, was released in September 2007. Pitchfork wrote, &quot;She really &quot;is&quot; pop&quot;, before finishing the review by declaring, &quot;It&#x27;s a success&quot;. &quot;Mojo&quot; stated: &quot;a thirst for sonic adventure radiates from each track&quot;. &quot;Mantaray&quot; included three singles: &quot;Into a Swan&quot;, &quot;Here Comes That Day&quot; and &quot;About to Happen&quot;. In 2008, Siouxsie recorded vocals for the track &quot;Careless Love&quot; on &quot;The Edge of Love&quot; soundtrack by composer Angelo Badalamenti. She performed it with another Badalamenti number, &quot;Who Will Take My Dreams Away&quot;, at the annual edition of the World Soundtrack Awards. After a year of touring, the singer played the last show of her tour in London in September 2008. A live DVD of this performance, &quot;&quot;, was released in 2009.

In June 2013, after a hiatus of five years, Siouxsie played two nights at the Royal Festival Hall in London during Yoko Ono&#x27;s Meltdown festival. She performed 1980&#x27;s &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; album live in its entirety, along with other works from her back catalogue, and her performance was praised by the press. She also appeared at Ono&#x27;s &quot;Double Fantasy&quot; concert, to sing the final song, &quot;Walking on Thin Ice&quot;. In October 2014, she and fellow Banshee Steven Severin compiled a CD titled &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderfull Life&quot; for the November 2014 issue of &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine, in which she appeared on the cover. The disc included 15 tracks that inspired the Banshees.

&quot;Love Crime&quot;, her first song in eight years, was featured in the finale of the TV series &quot;Hannibal&quot; in August 2015. Series creator Bryan Fuller called it &quot;epic&quot;.

In 2022, &quot;Mantaray&quot; was remastered at Abbey Road Studios to mark its 15th anniversary. The remastered version featuring different artwork, was reissued on translucent red vinyl, black vinyl and CD.

In 2023 Siouxsie headlined the Cruel World Festival in Pasadena, California in May, and the Release Athens 2023 festival in June. Her performance in Madrid at the Noches del Botánico was praised by &quot;Time Out&quot;. 

In early 2024 Siouxsie collaborated with Iggy Pop to record a new rendition of &quot;The Passenger&quot; for an advert.

==Songwriting==
Journalist Paul Morley noted that Siouxsie&#x27;s songs topics dealt with &quot;mental illness, medical terrors, surreal diseases, depraved urges, sinister intensity, unearthly energy, sexual abuse, childhood disturbances, sordid mysteries, unbearable nervous anxiety, fairytale fears, urban discontent and the bleak dignity of solitude&quot;. Many of her songs are about damage; her childhood marked her profoundly. She said, &quot;Damaged lives, damaged souls, damaged relationships. Most of the damage I sing about first happened when I was younger and I am still feeding off it and working it out. Early experiences are what create a lifetime of damage. The songs you write can help you fix the damage. And just the environment you are in is so important and can waste potential and corrupt something. For me, there was neglect. An alcoholic father who is not there because the most important thing for him is just to get alcohol and your mother is trying to compensate for the non-existent second parent so she&#x27;s never there because she&#x27;s working all the time and when she is around she&#x27;s stressed out. Being isolated and not having anyone to connect with, there was just no physical touching back then&quot;.

==Legacy==
Siouxsie has been praised by artists of many genres. She had a strong impact on two trip-hop acts. Tricky covered 1983&#x27;s proto trip-hop &quot;Tattoo&quot;, to open his second album &quot;Nearly God&quot;, and Massive Attack sampled &quot;Metal Postcard (Mittageisen)&quot; on their song &quot;Superpredators (Metal Postcard)&quot; for the soundtrack to the film &quot;The Jackal.&quot;

Other acts have covered Siouxsie&#x27;s songs. Jeff Buckley performed &quot;Killing Time&quot; several times; he first recorded it during a radio session for WFMU in 1992. LCD Soundsystem recorded a cover of &quot;Slowdive&quot; for the B-side of &quot;Disco Infiltrator&quot;, which was also released on &quot;Introns&quot;. Santigold based her track &quot;My Superman&quot; on the music of &quot;Red Light&quot;. In 2003, the Beta Band sampled &quot;Painted Bird&quot; on a track titled &quot;Liquid Bird&quot; on their &quot;Heroes to Zeros&quot; album. Red Hot Chili Peppers performed &quot;Christine&quot; at the V2001 festival and introduced it to their British audience as &quot;your national anthem&quot;. &quot;Christine&quot; was also revisited by Simple Minds. Indie folk group DeVotchKa covered &quot;The Last Beat of My Heart&quot; at the suggestion of Arcade Fire singer Win Butler in 2007. The Weeknd sampled &quot;Happy House&quot; on &quot;House of Balloons&quot; in 2011, and he performed it during his Super Bowl halftime show in 2021.

Morrissey said that &quot;Siouxsie and the Banshees were excellent. They were one of the great groups of the late 70s, early 80s&quot;. In 1994, discussing modern bands, he also stated: &quot;None of them are as good as Siouxsie and the Banshees at full pelt. That&#x27;s not dusty nostalgia, that&#x27;s fact&quot;. Another member of the Smiths, Johnny Marr, said: &quot;Really my generation was all about a guy called John McGeoch, from Siouxsie and the Banshees. He was a great player&quot;. Marr hailed McGeoch for his work on Siouxsie&#x27;s single &quot;Spellbound&quot;. Marr qualified it as &quot;clever&quot; with &quot;really good picky thing going on which is very un-rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll&quot;. Radiohead also cited McGeoch-era Siouxsie records when mentioning the recording of &quot;There There&quot;. Their singer, Thom Yorke, said: &quot;The band that really changed my life was R.E.M. and Siouxsie and the Banshees ...&quot;. &quot;My favourite show I ever saw then was Siouxsie and she was absolutely amazing. ... She&#x27;s totally in command of the whole audience&quot;. Yorke added that she &quot;made an especially big impression in concert, she was really sexy but absolutely terrifying.&quot; Sonic Youth singer and guitarist Thurston Moore named &quot;Hong Kong Garden&quot; as one of his 25 all-time favourite songs.

Siouxsie has influenced other bands ranging from contemporaries Joy Division, U2, and the Cure, to later acts like the Jesus and Mary Chain, Jane&#x27;s Addiction and TV on the Radio. Joy Division co-founder Peter Hook said that &quot;The Scream&quot; inspired them for the &quot;really unusual way of playing&quot; of the guitarist and the drummer and cited the Banshees as &quot;one of our big influences&quot;. U2 frontman Bono named her as an influence in the band&#x27;s 2006 autobiography &quot;U2 by U2&quot;. He was inspired by her way of singing. &quot;I still think that I sing like Siouxsie from The Banshees on the first two U2 albums&quot;. With his band, he selected &quot;Christine&quot; for a compilation made for &quot;Mojo&quot;&#x27;s readers. U2 guitarist the Edge also was the presenter of an award given to Siouxsie at a &quot;Mojo&quot; ceremony in 2005. The Cure&#x27;s Robert Smith related what the &quot;Join Hands&quot; tour brought him musically: &quot;When we supported The Banshees in 1979, we suddenly became aware of how limited our palette was. I felt constrained, so when the opportunity arose to play with them I jumped at it and juggled the two bands for a while. It taught me a lot – they had fantastic rhythm sections and this made me think, &#x27;Why can&#x27;t I have this?&#x27;.&quot; For Smith&#x27;s record &quot;The Head on the Door&quot; in 1985, he stated: &quot;It reminds me of the &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; album, the idea of having lots of different sounding things, different colours&quot;. Dave Navarro of Jane&#x27;s Addiction once made a parallel between his band and the Banshees: &quot;There are so many similar threads: melody, use of sound, attitude, sex appeal. I always saw Jane&#x27;s Addiction as the masculine Siouxsie and the Banshees&quot;. Dave Sitek of TV on the Radio hailed the poppiest Siouxsie songs, citing their arrangements: &quot;I&#x27;ve always tried to make a song that begins like &quot;Kiss Them for Me&quot;. I think songs like &quot;I Was a Lover&quot; or &quot;Wash the Day Away&quot; came from that element of surprise mode where all of a sudden this giant drum comes in and you&#x27;re like, what the fuck?! That record was the first one where I was like, okay, even my friends&#x27;re going to fall for this. I feel like that transition into that record was a relief for me. Really beautiful music was always considered too weird by the normal kids and that was the first example where I thought, we&#x27;ve got them, they&#x27;re hooked! I watched people dance to that song, people who had never heard of any of the music that I listened to, they heard that music in a club and went crazy&quot;. Dave Gahan of Depeche Mode said about her: &quot;She always sounds exciting. She sings with a lot of sex–that&#x27;s what I like&quot;. Mark Lanegan stated that he would have liked to collaborate with her: &quot;In my wildest dreams I would love to sing with Siouxsie&quot;. She is also revered by Damon Albarn and Dave Grohl. Omar Rodríguez-López of the Mars Volta mentioned his liking for &quot;the very textural side of Siouxsie&quot;. Santigold said, &quot;I keep a Rolodex of the women that vocally inspire me. There aren&#x27;t that many, but she&#x27;s definitely one of them. I remember one of the first times I heard &#x27;Red Light&#x27; it was at a party, and I remember going up to the DJ and being like, &#x27;Who&#x27;s this?&#x27;. It was that good. I kind of stopped and was like ... wow. There&#x27;s not a tremendous amount of women who are bold and forward thinking as artists. I feel like her music, at the time especially, was pretty unique in the way that it sort of matched her style. The freedom of experimenting with this dark place that doesn&#x27;t have a place often in modern music&quot;.

Siouxsie has inspired many female singers. When asked if there was any figure who connected with her when she was just a listener, PJ Harvey replied: &quot;It&#x27;s hard to beat Siouxsie Sioux, in terms of live performance. She is so exciting to watch, so full of energy and human raw quality&quot;. Harvey also selected in her top 10 favourite albums of 1999, the &quot;Anima Animus&quot; album by Siouxsie&#x27;s second band the Creatures. Sinéad O&#x27;Connor said that when she started, Siouxsie was one of her main influences. Tracey Thorn of Everything but the Girl wrote in her autobiography that Siouxsie was one of her heroines. Thorn paid homage to Siouxsie in the lyrics of her 2007 song &quot;Hands Up to the Ceiling&quot;. Elizabeth Fraser of Cocteau Twins used to have a Siouxsie tattoo on her arm, and mentioned her liking for &quot;Metal Postcard&quot; to the members of Massive Attack in 1998. Sharleen Spiteri of Texas grew up listening to tracks such as &quot;Hong Kong Garden&quot; and was hooked by the Asian vibe present in the song; she stated that Texas&#x27; single &quot;In Our Lifetime&quot; was &quot;our tribute to Hong Kong Garden&quot;. Garbage singer Shirley Manson cited her as an influence: &quot;I learned how to sing listening to &quot;The Scream&quot; and &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot;&quot;. Manson also declared that Siouxsie embodied everything she wanted to be as a young woman. Manson would later write the foreword to &quot;Siouxsie &amp; The Banshees: The Authorised Biography&quot;. Beth Ditto, of Gossip cited her as one of their influences for their 2009 album &quot;Music for Men&quot;. Ana Matronic of Scissor Sisters named Siouxsie as a source of inspiration and the Banshees as her favourite band. Siouxsie was also hailed by Romy Madley Croft of the xx, Kim Deal of the Pixies and the Breeders, and also by Josephine Wiggs of the Breeders, and namechecked by Karin Dreijer Andersson of the Knife. Kate Jackson of the Long Blondes said that Siouxsie was a part of her musical background, thanks to her &quot;sharp lyrics&quot; on Creatures&#x27; tracks like &quot;So Unreal&quot;. Rachel Goswell mentioned her as a major influence: &quot;From a singing point of view, I was inspired by Siouxsie Sioux, who I just adored. She&#x27;s amazing. I&#x27;ve never seen anyone else quite like her&quot;; her band Slowdive was named on a suggestion of Goswell, inspired by the Banshees&#x27; single of the same name. Lush were initially named &quot;the Baby Machines&quot;, which the band culled from the lyrics of &quot;Arabian Knights&quot;. Courtney Love of Hole wrote Siouxsie in her favourite records&#x27; list when she was a teenager in her diary. While talking about another band, Love also stated: &quot;They are amazing. ... It&#x27;s kind of very Siouxsie Sioux&quot;. Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth said: &quot;Initially I was really inspired by... Siouxsie, Patti Smith&quot;. FKA twigs named her as a main influence: &quot;Every bit of music that I made sounded like a pastiche of Siouxsie... but through that I discovered myself&quot;. Róisín Murphy named Siouxsie when asked who were her biggest influences.

Other musicians who have stated their admiration for Siouxsie&#x27;s work include Charli XCX, Hayley Williams of Paramore, Dolores O&#x27;Riordan of the Cranberries, Jennifer Charles of Elysian Fields, Ebony Bones, Grimes, Toni Halliday of Curve, Kathleen Hanna of Bikini Kill, Cat Power, Gillian Gilbert of New Order, Amy Ray of the Indigo Girls, Alison Goldfrapp, Sarah Cracknell of Saint Etienne, Florence Welch of Florence + the Machine, Chelsea Wolfe, Brody Dalle of the Distillers, Kristin Kontrol of the Dum Dum Girls, Joan As Police Woman, Lou Doillon, Emel Mathlouthi, Girlpool, Liz Phair, Billie Ray Martin, An Pierlé, Uffie, Lauren Mayberry of Chvrches, Meshell Ndegeocello, St. Vincent, Anohni, Jehnny Beth of Savages, Jenny Lee Lindberg of Warpaint, Sharon Van Etten, and Nabihah Iqbal.

In 2022, Sky Arts ranked her at number 14 in Britain&#x27;s top 50 most influential artists of the last 50 years, and &quot;The Times&quot; called her &quot;one of British pop&#x27;s most charismatic and original artists&quot;.

==Personal life==
Siouxsie married bandmate Budgie in May 1991. The following year, they moved to the southwest of France.

In an interview with &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; in August 2007, she announced that she and Budgie had divorced. In an interview with &quot;The Independent&quot;, she said: I&#x27;ve never particularly said I&#x27;m hetero or I&#x27;m a lesbian. I know there are people who are definitely one way, but not really me. I suppose if I am attracted to men then they usually have more feminine qualities.

In 2023, she teamed up with PETA to protest against animal testing. In a letter to Japanese conglomerate Ajinomoto, the world&#x27;s largest manufacturer of monosodium glutamate (MSG), she wrote that the company &quot;should be leading the way with compassion, not falling behind. Please, stop being spellbound by bad science and end these cruel tests immediately.&quot;

<doc id="378268" wikidata="Q1951368" url="?curid=378268" title="The Great Milenko">
<text>The Great Milenko is the fourth studio album by American hip hop group Insane Clown Posse, released on June 24, 1997, by Hollywood Records in association with Psychopathic Records. As the fourth Joker&#x27;s Card in the group&#x27;s Dark Carnival mythology, the album&#x27;s lyrics focus on the titular Great Milenko, who is a necromancer.

The album was recorded and initially released by the Disney-owned record label Hollywood Records. The album was taken off shelves by Hollywood hours after its release, in response to criticism from the Southern Baptist Church of decisions that the church believed did not reflect Disney&#x27;s family-friendly image, although Disney claimed that the album was released due to an oversight by its review board. After Hollywood terminated the group&#x27;s contract, Insane Clown Posse signed a new contract with Island Records (whose parent at the time, PolyGram, distributed Hollywood releases in North America), which agreed to release the album as it was originally intended. Island then re-released the album on August 12, 1997.

The music of &quot;The Great Milenko&quot; features a rap metal sound and features guest appearances by popular rock stars Alice Cooper, Steve Jones and Slash. Although the album was poorly received by critics, it debuted at number 63 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, and was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

==Conception==

===Background===
Following the 1994 release of the album &quot;Ringmaster&quot;, Insane Clown Posse started to attract a strong local following in Detroit, Michigan. The group began selling out large clubs such as St. Andrew&#x27;s Hall and the State Theatre, and drew the attention of major record label Jive Records. The following year, Insane Clown Posse signed with the label Battery Records, a subsidiary of Jive Records. Battery/Jive released the duo&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Riddle Box&quot; (1995), but showed little interest in promoting the album. The group&#x27;s manager Alex Abbiss negotiated a contract with Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Records label, which reportedly paid $1 million to purchase the Insane Clown Posse contract from Battery/Jive Records.

The expansion of the Juggalo fanbase into its own culture inspired Insane Clown Posse to write the songs &quot;What Is a Juggalo?&quot; and &quot;Down with the Clown&quot; for this album.

===Recording===
The group started recording &quot;The Great Milenko&quot; in 1996, and Violent J began thinking of a title for the album shortly after. Bruce later came up with the title &quot;The Great Milenko&quot;. Bruce also admitted that he had always liked the ring name of professional wrestler Dean Simon (&quot;Dean Malenko&quot;), because he felt that the name Malenko had a &quot;carnival&quot; sound to it. Believing that he had created the name himself, Bruce later realized that he had unwittingly used the nickname of Dean&#x27;s father, Boris &quot;The Great&quot; Malenko.

The band wanted to include famous rock stars on the album. Julian Raymond, the artists and repertoire representative for Hollywood Records, contacted Slash, Steve Jones, and Alice Cooper. Slash, who was a self-professed fan of the band&#x27;s music, reportedly only asked for Wild Irish Rose as payment for his contributions. Bruce, who knew very little about the Sex Pistols or Steve Jones, declined to show up at the studio when Jones played his guitar part for &quot;Piggy Pie&quot;. Although not knowing much about Alice Cooper either, Bruce decided to fly to Arizona and coach Cooper on his parts. Bruce and Clark also met George Clinton, who was staying in the same hotel, and recorded his voice in his room, but it did not fit anywhere on the album.

After the recording sessions were finished, executives at Hollywood Records—and the label&#x27;s parent company, Disney—expressed dissatisfaction with several tracks. Disney requested that the tracks &quot;The Neden Game&quot;, &quot;Under the Moon&quot;, and &quot;Boogie Woogie Wu&quot; be removed because of lyrics referencing abuse of women, rape and murder, and the slaughter of children, respectively. Disney also asked that the lyrics of &quot;Piggy Pie&quot; be changed, due to lyrics about murdering police officers. Disney threatened not to release the album if their requests were not met. Begrudgingly, Bruce and Utsler complied with Disney&#x27;s requests. The uncensored version of &quot;Piggy Pie&quot; was later released on &quot;Forgotten Freshness Volumes 1 &amp; 2&quot;. After recording was finalized, the duo planned to go on a national tour with House of Krazees and Myzery as its opening acts. Several songs were recorded with the intention of releasing them on &quot;The Great Milenko&quot;. One such song, &quot;House of Wonders&quot;, was recorded but was later released on &quot;Mutilation Mix&quot; (1997) and &quot;Forgotten Freshness Volumes 1 &amp; 2&quot; (1998).

===Joker&#x27;s Cards===
&quot;The Great Milenko&quot; is the fourth Joker&#x27;s Card in Insane Clown Posse&#x27;s Dark Carnival concept album series. The Dark Carnival is a concept of the afterlife in which souls are sent to a form of limbo while waiting to be sent to heaven or hell based on their individual actions. These concepts are related by Insane Clown Posse in a series of albums called the six Joker&#x27;s Cards. Each of the six Joker&#x27;s Cards relate to a specific character—an entity of the Dark Carnival—that tries to &quot;save the human soul&quot; by showing the wickedness inside of one&#x27;s self.

This Joker&#x27;s Card is a necromancer and illusionist who tries to trick individuals into acts of greed, envy, and lust. The Card ultimately issues a warning against such acts of sin, and enlightens listeners that The Great Milenko is a part of every individual, and that they have the power to fall under his illusions or cast his hoaxes aside.

==Music==

===Style===

&quot;The Great Milenko&quot; featured more rock influences than previous Insane Clown Posse albums, including an introduction performed by Alice Cooper and guitar tracks performed by Steve Jones (on &quot;Piggy Pie&quot;), and Slash (on &quot;Halls of Illusions&quot;). Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote, in his review of &quot;The Amazing Jeckel Brothers&quot; (1999) that, &quot;&quot;The Great Milenko&quot; [...] was targeted at white-boy, adolescent metalheads -- really, how could any album that contained guest spots from Alice Cooper, Slash, Steve Jones and Legs Diamond be anything else?&quot;

Insane Clown Posse hired renowned Detroit record producer and DJ Mike E. Clark to produce the record. Clark made the album sound more rock-oriented, as opposed to the duo&#x27;s earlier material, which featured a more prominent hip-hop sound. To create the record, Clark utilized standard hip hop techniques such as record scratching, and mixed them with elements of rock and heavy metal.

===Lyricism===

According to the group&#x27;s mythology, The Great Milenko is a necromancer and illusionist who tries to trick individuals into greed and other such sins. He takes out the worst in an individual and creates powerful illusions in an attempt to cause them to become hedonistic and greedy. An honorable individual must fight his magic in order to make it to Shangri-La (as revealed in the track &quot;Pass Me By&quot;).

The album&#x27;s themes mostly revolve around those of death, morality, and everyday decisions. For instance, &quot;How Many Times?&quot; talks about annoying traffic jams and other everyday-life inconveniences. &quot;Piggy Pie&quot; references the Three Little Pigs and tells Violent J&#x27;s story of murdering three kinds of people: an incest-prone redneck, a judge who unjustly sentences people based on their looks, and a stuck-up wealthy person. &quot;Under the Moon&quot; tells the tale of a man convicted after killing a man who tried to rape his girlfriend. &quot;Boogie Woogie Wu&quot; is told from the perspective of the boogie man and talks about the slaughter of children. The &quot;Neden Game&quot; takes the form of a &quot;Dating Game&quot;-esque show, albeit with added misogynistic banter for humor. Finally, the lyrics to &quot;Hellalujah&quot; target money-hungry preachers.

===Singles===
Two singles were released from the album: &quot;Halls of Illusions&quot; and &quot;Hokus Pokus&quot;. &quot;Halls of Illusions&quot; was the first single released in 1997. The single peaked at number 56 on the UK Singles Chart, and its accompanying music video peaked at number one on The Box video request channel. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Hokus Pokus&quot;, was released in June 1997. In 1998, it peaked at number 54 on the UK Singles Chart.

==Promotion and release==

Initially, Hollywood Records shipped 100,000 copies of &quot;The Great Milenko&quot; to various record stores. During a music-store autograph signing, Insane Clown Posse was notified that Hollywood Records had deleted the album within hours of its release, despite having sold 18,000 copies and reaching number 63 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The group was also informed that its in-store signings and 25-city nationwide tour had been canceled, commercials for the album and the music video for &quot;Halls of Illusions&quot; (which had reached number one on The Box video request channel) were pulled from television, and that the group was dropped from the label. It was later revealed that Disney was being criticized by the Southern Baptist Church at the time because of Disney&#x27;s promotion of Gay Days at Disneyland, in addition to producing and distributing the gay-themed television sitcom &quot;Ellen&quot;. The church claimed Disney was turning its back on family values. Although Abbiss told the press that Disney had stopped production of &quot;The Great Milenko&quot; to avoid further controversy, Disney claimed instead that the release of the album was an oversight by their review board, and that the album &quot;did not fit the Disney image&quot; because of its &quot;inappropriate&quot; lyrics, which they claimed were offensive to women. Although Hollywood Records had ordered record stores to return shipments of the now-deleted album, many record stores refused, including the Michigan-based Harmony House where 1,700 CDs were sold in 36 stores after the termination order.

After the termination of the Hollywood Records contract, labels such as Interscope and Geffen Records wanted to sign the group, but Island Records&#x27; Chris Blackwell came to the group&#x27;s rescue and agreed to release &quot;The Great Milenko&quot; as it was originally intended. As part of the deal, Island also agreed to rerelease the group&#x27;s first two Joker&#x27;s Card albums. &quot;Milenko&quot; was released in four colors: red, green, purple, and gold. Each color had a different secret message that would help reveal the title of the fifth Joker&#x27;s Card, &quot;The Amazing Jeckel Brothers&quot;. Music videos were filmed for &quot;Halls of Illusions&quot;, &quot;How Many Times?&quot;, and &quot;Piggy Pie&quot;. An unofficial music video for &quot;Down with the Clown&quot; was featured on the home-video release &quot;Juggalo Championshxt Wrestling Volume 1&quot;. A music video for the Headhuntaz Remix of &quot;Hokus Pokus&quot; was produced after the release of the album. The video featured appearances by Twiztid and Myzery. Blackwell left Island Records shortly after the group released &quot;Forgotten Freshness Volumes 1 &amp; 2&quot;, and the merger of PolyGram into Universal Music Group (which owned Interscope and Geffen) affected the way the label handled its next Joker&#x27;s Card release. Despite the rough start, &quot;The Great Milenko&quot; has sold well over the years. On May 5, 1998, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). A year later, on April 21, 1999, the album was certified platinum for shipments of over one million copies. As of 2007, the album has sold over 1.7 million copies in the United States.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; music critic David Browne gave the record a C-minus rating: &quot;[With] its puerile humor and intentionally ugly metal-rap tunes, the album feels oddly dated.&quot; AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that &quot;The Great Milenko&quot; is &quot;the sort of record you wish they would take off the stereo at excruciating frat parties.&quot; In &quot;The Great Rock Discography&quot;, Martin Charles Strong gave the album five out of ten stars. The album received two out of five stars in &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, in which Ben Sisario identified it as the album in which &quot;the group came into its own&quot;.

Although the reviews were mostly negative, some critics complimented the album&#x27;s improved sound over its precursors. Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that the album was &quot;a better record than [its] predecessors, boasting a tougher sound and some actual hooks, without losing the juvenile vulgarity that pleased their following&quot;, and added that &quot;it is better than the rest of ICP&#x27;s work&quot;. David Browne said that &quot;&quot;Milenko&quot; is better produced than the duo&#x27;s earlier output (Slash grinds out metal chords on &quot;Halls of Illusions&quot;), and &quot;Pass Me By&quot; is a genuinely melodic song.&quot; In 2009, Fangoria named &quot;The Great Milenko&quot; an iconic horrorcore album.

<doc id="378269" wikidata="Q663088" url="?curid=378269" title="Helium–neon laser">
<text>A helium–neon laser or He–Ne laser is a type of gas laser whose high energetic gain medium consists of a mixture of helium and neon (ratio between 5:1 and 20:1) at a total pressure of approximately 1 Torr (133 Pa) inside a small electrical discharge. The best-known and most widely used He-Ne laser operates at a center wavelength of 632.81646 nm (in air), 632.99138 nm (vac), and frequency 473.6122 THz, in the red part of the visible spectrum. Because of the mode structure of the laser cavity, the instantaneous output of a laser can be shifted by up to 500 MHz in either direction from the center.

==History of He-Ne laser development==
The first He-Ne lasers emitted infrared at 1150 nm, and were the first gas lasers and the first lasers with continuous wave output. However, a laser that operated at visible wavelengths was much more in demand. A number of other neon transitions were investigated to identify ones in which a population inversion could be achieved. The 633 nm line was found to have the highest gain in the visible spectrum, making this the wavelength of choice for most He-Ne lasers. However, other visible and infrared stimulated-emission wavelengths are possible, and by using mirror coatings with their peak reflectance at these other wavelengths; He-Ne lasers could be engineered to employ those transitions, including visible lasers appearing red, orange, yellow, and green. Stimulated emissions are known from over 100 μm in the far infrared to 540 nm in the visible.

Because visible transitions have somewhat lower gain, these lasers generally have lower output efficiencies and are more costly. The 3.39 μm transition has a very high gain, but is prevented from use in an ordinary He-Ne laser (of a different intended wavelength) because the cavity and mirrors are lossy at that wavelength. However, in high-power He-Ne lasers having a particularly long cavity, superluminescence at 3.39 μm can become a nuisance, robbing power from the stimulated emission medium, often requiring additional suppression.

The best-known and most widely used He-Ne laser operates at a wavelength of 632.8 nm, in the red part of the visible spectrum. It was developed at Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1962, 18 months after the pioneering demonstration at the same laboratory of the first continuous infrared He-Ne gas laser in December 1960.

==Construction and operation==
The gain medium of the laser, as suggested by its name, is a mixture of helium and neon gases, in approximately a 10:1 ratio, contained at low pressure in a glass envelope. The gas mixture is mostly helium, so that helium atoms can be excited. The excited helium atoms collide with neon atoms, exciting some of them to the state that radiates 632.8 nm. Without helium, the neon atoms would be excited mostly to lower excited states, responsible for non-laser lines.

A neon laser with no helium can be constructed, but it is much more difficult without this means of energy coupling. Therefore, a He-Ne laser that has lost enough of its helium (e.g., due to diffusion through the seals or glass) will lose its laser functionality because the pumping efficiency will be too low. The energy or pump source of the laser is provided by a high-voltage electrical discharge passed through the gas between electrodes (anode and cathode) within the tube. A DC current of 3 to 20 mA is typically required for CW operation. The optical cavity of the laser usually consists of two concave mirrors or one plane and one concave mirror: one having very high (typically 99.9%) reflectance, and the output coupler mirror allowing approximately 1% transmission.

Commercial He-Ne lasers are relatively small devices compared to other gas lasers, having cavity lengths usually ranging from 15 to 50 cm (but sometimes up to about 1 meter to achieve the highest powers), and optical output power levels ranging from 0.5 to 50 mW.

The precise wavelength of red He-Ne lasers is 632.991 nm in a vacuum, which is refracted to about 632.816 nm in air. The wavelengths of the stimulated emission modes lie within about 0.001 nm above or below this value, and the wavelengths of those modes shift within this range due to thermal expansion and contraction of the cavity. Frequency-stabilized versions enable the wavelength of a single mode to be specified to within 1 part in 108 by the technique of comparing the powers of two longitudinal modes in opposite polarizations. Absolute stabilization of the laser&#x27;s frequency (or wavelength) as fine as 2.5 parts in 1011 can be obtained through use of an iodine absorption cell.

The mechanism producing population inversion and light amplification in a He-Ne laser plasma originates with inelastic collision of energetic electrons with ground-state helium atoms in the gas mixture. As shown in the accompanying energy-level diagram, these collisions excite helium atoms from the ground state to higher energy excited states, among them the 23S1 and 21S0 (LS, or Russell–Saunders coupling, front number 2 indicates that an excited electron is  = 2 state) are long-lived metastable states. Because of a fortuitous near-coincidence between the energy levels of the two He metastable states and the 5s2 and 4s2 (Paschen notation) levels of neon, collisions between these helium metastable atoms and ground-state neon atoms results in a selective and efficient transfer of excitation energy from the helium to neon. This excitation energy transfer process is given by the reaction equations
: He*(23S1) + Ne1S0 → He(1S0) + Ne*4s2 + Δ&quot;E&quot;,
: He*(21S) + Ne1S0 + Δ&quot;E&quot; → He(1S0) + Ne*5s2,
where * represents an excited state, and Δ&quot;E&quot; is the small energy difference between the energy states of the two atoms, of the order of 0.05 eV, or 387 cm−1, which is supplied by kinetic energy. Excitation-energy transfer increases the population of the neon 4s2 and 5s2 levels manyfold. When the population of these two upper levels exceeds that of the corresponding lower level, 3p4, to which they are optically connected, population inversion is present. The medium becomes capable of amplifying light in a narrow band at 1.15 μm (corresponding to the 4s2 to 3p4 transition) and in a narrow band at 632.8 nm (corresponding to the 5s2 to 3p4 transition). The 3p4 level is efficiently emptied by fast radiative decay to the 3s state, eventually reaching the ground state.

The remaining step in utilizing optical amplification to create an optical oscillator is to place highly reflecting mirrors at each end of the amplifying medium so that a wave in a particular spatial mode will reflect back upon itself, gaining more power in each pass than is lost due to transmission through the mirrors and diffraction. When these conditions are met for one or more longitudinal modes, then radiation in those modes will rapidly build up until gain saturation occurs, resulting in a stable continuous laser-beam output through the front (typically 99% reflecting) mirror.

The gain bandwidth of the He-Ne laser is dominated by Doppler broadening rather than pressure broadening due to the low gas pressure and is thus quite narrow: only about 1.5 GHz full width for the 633 nm transition. With cavities having typical lengths of 15 to 50 cm, this allows about 2 to 8 longitudinal modes to oscillate simultaneously (however, single-longitudinal-mode units are available for special applications). The visible output of the red He-Ne laser, long coherence length, and its excellent spatial quality, makes this laser a useful source for holography and as a wavelength reference for spectroscopy. A stabilized He-Ne laser is also one of the benchmark systems for the definition of the meter.

Prior to the invention of cheap, abundant diode lasers, red He-Ne lasers were widely used in barcode scanners at supermarket checkout counters. He-Ne lasers are generally present in educational and research optical laboratories. They are also unsurpassed for use in nano-positioning in applications such as semiconductor device fabrication. High precision laser gyroscopes have employed He-Ne lasers operating at 633 nm in a ring laser configuration.

==Applications==

Red He-Ne lasers have an enormous number of industrial and scientific uses. They are widely used in laboratory demonstrations in the field of optics because of their relatively low cost and ease of operation compared to other visible lasers producing beams of similar quality in terms of spatial coherence (a single-mode Gaussian beam) and long coherence length (however, since about 1990 semiconductor lasers have offered a lower-cost alternative for many such applications).

Starting in 1978, HeNe tube lasers (manufactured by Toshiba and NEC) were used in LaserDisc players from Pioneer. This continued until the 1984 model lineup, which contained infrared laser diodes instead. Pioneer continued to use laser diodes in all LaserDisc players afterwards until LaserDisc was discontinued in 2009.

<text>Damn Small Linux (DSL) is a computer operating system for the x86 family of personal computers. It is free and open-source software under the terms of the GNU GPL and other free and open-source licenses. It was designed to run graphical user interface applications on older PC hardware, for example, machines with 486 and early Pentium microprocessors and very little random-access memory (RAM). DSL is a live CD with a size of 50 megabytes (MB). What originally began as an experiment to see how much software could fit in 50 MB eventually became a full Linux distribution. It can be installed on storage media with small capacities, like bootable business cards, USB flash drives, various memory cards, and Zip drives.

== History ==
DSL was originally conceived and maintained by John Andrews. For five years the community included Robert Shingledecker who created the MyDSL system, DSL Control Panel and other features. After issues with the main developers, Shingledecker was, by his account, exiled from the project. He currently continues his work on Tiny Core Linux which he created in April 2008.

DSL was originally based on Model-K, a 22 MB stripped-down version of Knoppix, but soon after was based on Knoppix proper, allowing much easier remastering and improvements. The distribution is now based on Debian and antiX.

== System requirements ==
DSL is designed to primarily support x86 PCs. The minimum system requirements are a 486 processor and 8 MB of RAM. DSL has been demonstrated by browsing the web with Dillo, running simple games, and playing music on systems with a 486 processor and 16 MB of RAM. The system requirements are higher for running Mozilla Firefox and optional add-ons such as the OpenOffice.org office suite.
== Features ==
Version 4.4.10 of DSL, released November 18, 2008, included the following software:
* Text editors: Beaver, Nano, Vim
* File managers: DFM, emelFM
* Graphics: mtPaint (raster graphics editor), xzgv (image viewer)
* Multimedia: gphone, XMMS with MPEG-1 and Video CD (VCD) support
* Office: Siag Office (spreadsheet program), Ted (word processor) with spell checker, Xpdf (viewer for Portable Document Format (PDF) documents), AbiWord, Gnumeric
* Internet:
** Web browsers: Dillo, Firefox, Netrik
** Sylpheed (E-mail client)
** naim (AOL Instant Messenger (AIM), ICQ, and IRC client)
** AxyFTP (File Transfer Protocol (FTP) client), BetaFTPD (FTP server)
** Monkey (web server)
** Server Message Block (SMB) client
** Rdesktop (Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) client, Virtual Network Computing (VNC) viewer
* Others: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) client, Secure Shell (SSH) and secure copy protocol (SCP) client and server; Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP), Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE), Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) support; FUSE, Network File System (NFS), SSH Filesystem (SSHFS) support; UnionFS; generic and Ghostscript printing support; PC card, Universal Serial Bus (USB), Wi-Fi support; calculator, games, system monitor; many command-line tools

DSL has built-in scripts to download and install Advanced Packaging Tool (APT). Once APT is enabled, a user can install packages from Debian&#x27;s repositories. Also, DSL hosts software ranging from large applications like OpenOffice.org and GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), to smaller ones such as aMSN, by means of the &quot;MyDSL&quot; system, which allows convenient one-click download and installing of software. Files hosted on MyDSL are called &quot;extensions&quot;. As of June 2008, the MyDSL servers were hosting over 900 applications, plugins, and other extensions.

== Boot options ==
Boot options are also called &quot;cheat codes&quot; in DSL. Automatic hardware detection may fail, or the user may want to use something other than the default settings (language, keyboard, VGA, fail-safe graphics, text mode...). DSL allows the user to enter one or more cheat codes at the boot prompt. If nothing is entered, DSL will boot with the default options. Cheat codes affect many auto-detection and hardware options. Many cheat codes also affect the GUI. The list of cheat codes can be seen at boot time and also at the DSL Wiki.

== The MyDSL system ==
MyDSL is handled and maintained mostly by Robert Shingledecker and hosted by many organizations, such as ibiblio and Belgium&#x27;s BELNET. There are two areas of MyDSL: &quot;regular&quot; and &quot;testing&quot;. The &quot;regular&quot; area contains extensions that have been proven stable enough for everyday use and is broken down into different areas such as &quot;apps&quot;, &quot;net&quot;, &quot;system&quot;, and &quot;uci&quot; (Universal Compressed ISO - Extensions in .uci format are mounted as a separate file system to minimize RAM use). The &quot;testing&quot; area is for newly submitted extensions that theoretically work well enough but may have any number of bugs.

== Versions and ports ==

=== Release timeline ===
===Ports and derivatives===
DSL was ported to the Xbox video game console as X-DSL. X-DSL requires a modified Xbox. It can run as a Live CD or be installed to the Xbox hard drive. Users have also run X-DSL from a USB flash drive, using the USB adaptor included with Phantasy Star Online, which plugs into the memory card slot and includes one USB 1.1 port. X-DSL boots into a X11-based GUI; the Xbox controller can be used to control the mouse pointer and enter text using a virtual keyboard. X-DSL has a Fluxbox desktop, with programs for E-mail, web browsing, word processing and playing music. X-DSL can be customized by downloading extensions from the same MyDSL servers as DSL.

Linux distributions derived from Damn Small Linux include Hikarunix, used for a CD image that runs the game of Go released in 2005,
and Damn Vulnerable Linux.

== Live USB ==
A Live USB of Damn Small Linux can be created manually or with applications like UNetbootin. 
== Status ==
Due to disagreements and irreconcilable differences among the project&#x27;s originators and main developers, DSL development seemed to be at a standstill for a long time, and the future of the project was uncertain, much to the dismay of many of the users. 

On July 8, 2012, John Andrews (the original developer) announced that a new release was being developed. The DSL website, including the forums which were once inaccessible, were back, as well. The first RC of the new 4.11 was released on August 3, 2012, followed by a second one on September 26. 

On February 1, 2024, DSL 2024 Alpha 1 was announced and released on the project&#x27;s webpage. May 22nd 2024 the DSL forum has a post &quot;Release Candidate 4 Now Available&quot;

<doc id="378276" wikidata="Q8014735" url="?curid=378276" title="William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition">
<text>The William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, often abbreviated to Putnam Competition, is an annual mathematics competition for undergraduate college students enrolled at institutions of higher learning in the United States and Canada (regardless of the students&#x27; nationalities). It awards a scholarship and cash prizes ranging from $250 to $2,500 for the top students and $5,000 to $25,000 for the top schools, plus one of the top five individual scorers (designated as &quot;Putnam Fellows&quot;) is awarded a scholarship of up to $12,000 plus tuition at Harvard University (Putnam Fellow Prize Fellowship), the top 100 individual scorers have their names mentioned in the American Mathematical Monthly (alphabetically ordered within rank), and the names and addresses of the top 500 contestants are mailed to all participating institutions. It is widely considered to be the most prestigious university-level mathematics competition in the world, and its difficulty is such that the median score is often zero or one (out of 120) despite being primarily attempted by students specializing in mathematics.

The competition was founded in 1927 by Elizabeth Lowell Putnam in memory of her husband William Lowell Putnam, who was an advocate of intercollegiate intellectual competition. The competition has been offered annually since 1938 and is administered by the Mathematical Association of America.

== Competition layout ==
The Putnam competition takes place on the first Saturday in December, and consists of two three-hour sittings separated by a lunch break. The competition is supervised by faculty members at the participating schools. Each one consists of twelve challenging problems. The problems cover a range of advanced material in undergraduate mathematics, including concepts from group theory, set theory, graph theory, lattice theory, and number theory.

Each of the twelve questions is worth 10 points, and the most frequent scores above zero are 10 points for a complete solution, 9 points for a nearly complete solution, and 1 point for the beginnings of a solution. In earlier years, the twelve questions were worth one point each, with no partial credit given. The competition is considered to be very difficult: it is typically attempted by students specializing in mathematics, but the median score is usually zero or one point out of 120 possible, and there have been only five perfect scores . In 2003, of the 3,615 students competing, 1,024 (28%) scored 10 or more points, and 42 points was sufficient to make the top percentile.

At a participating college, any student who wishes to take part in the competition may (limited by the number of spots a school receives); but until 2019 the school&#x27;s official team consisted of three individuals whom it designated in advance. Until 2019, a team&#x27;s score was the sum of the ranks of its three team members, with the lowest cumulative rank winning. It was entirely possible, even commonplace at some institutions, for the eventual results to show that the &quot;wrong&quot; team was picked—i.e. that some students not on the official team outscored an official team member. For example, in 2010, MIT had two of the top five scorers in the competition and seven of the top 24, while Caltech had just one student in the top five and only four in the top 24; yet Caltech took first place among teams while MIT took second. In 2019 the rules of the competition changed, with a school&#x27;s team consisting of its top three scorers, and team ranks determined by comparing the sums of the scores of the team members.

=== Awards ===
The top five teams win $25,000, $20,000, $15,000, $10,000, and $5,000, in that order, with team members receiving $1,000, $800, $600, $400, and $200, respectively.

The top five individual scorers are named Putnam Fellows and awarded $2,500. The school with the first-place team receives an award of $25,000. Each first-place team member, as well as the winner of the Elizabeth Lowell Putnam Prize, receives $1,000. Sixth through 15th place individuals receive $1,000 and the next ten receive $250. The names of the top 100 students are published in the &quot;American Mathematical Monthly&quot;, and competition results are published in early April of the year following the competition.

Many Putnam Fellows have gone on to become distinguished researchers in mathematics and other fields, including three Fields Medalists—John Milnor (also an Abel Prize laureate), David Mumford, and Daniel Quillen—and two Nobel laureates in physics—Richard Feynman and Kenneth Wilson.

===Putnam Fellows===
Since the first competition, the top five (or six, in case of a tie) scorers in the competition have been named Putnam Fellows. Within the top five, Putnam Fellows are not ranked. Students are not allowed to participate in the Putnam Competition more than four times. For example, if a high school senior chooses to officially participate, he/she effectively chooses to forfeit one of his/her years of eligibility in college (see Gabriel Carroll). This makes it even more of a remarkable feat to become a Putnam Fellow four times. In the history of the Competition, only eight students have been Putnam Fellows four times, with twenty-five others winning the award three times. The following table lists these students:

The following table lists all Putnam fellows from 1938 to present, with the years they placed in the top five. Ioana Dumitriu was the first woman to become a Putnam Fellow, in 1996.

===Elizabeth Lowell Putnam Award winners===
Since 1992, the Elizabeth Lowell Putnam Award has been available to be awarded to a female participant with a high score, with three awards being made for the first time in 2019. The year(s) in which they were Fellows are in bold. Ioana Dumitriu was the first woman to become a Putnam Fellow, in 1996.

<doc id="378285" wikidata="Q381696" url="?curid=378285" title="Pecos Classification">
<text>The Pecos Classification is a chronological division of all known Ancestral Puebloans into periods based on changes in architecture, art, pottery, and cultural remains. The original classification dates back to consensus reached at a 1927 archæological conference held in Pecos, New Mexico, which was organized by the United States archaeologist Alfred V. Kidder.

==Original classification==

The original Pecos Classification contained eight stages of Southwestern prehistory, but it did not specify dates.

# Basketmaker I, or Early Basketmaker II
# Basketmaker II, or Late Basketmaker II
# Basketmaker III, or Post-Basketmaker
# Pueblo I Period, or Proto-Pueblo
# Pueblo II Period
# Pueblo III Period, or Great Pueblo
# Pueblo IV Period, or Proto-Historic
# Pueblo V Period, or Historic

==Current classification==

Although the original classification has been significantly debated and sometimes modified over the years, the split into Basketmaker and Pueblo period still serves as a basis for discussing the culture of the Ancestral Puebloans of the Four Corners area. The following classification is based in part of the Revised Pecos Classification for the Mesa Verde Region.

===Archaic–Early Basketmaker (8000 – 1500 BCE)=== 
The pre-Ancestral Pueblo culture that moved into the modern-day Southwestern United States after the big game hunters departed are called &quot;Archaic&quot;. Little evidence for extensive habitation before 8000 BC exists. From evidence near Navajo Mountain, they were nomadic people, hunter-gatherers traveling in small bands. They gathered wild foods when in season, and hunted with stone-tipped spears, &quot;atlatls&quot;, and darts. Game included rabbits, deer, antelope, and bighorn sheep.

The original classification postulated a Basketmaker I Period which was subsequently discredited due to lack of physical evidence. It was combined with the Archaic Period.

This period was called Oshara tradition. There was a trend toward a sedentary lifestyle, with small-scale cultivation of plants beginning 1000 BC.

===Early Basketmaker II (1500 BCE – 50 CE)=== 
The early Ancestral Pueblo camped in the open or lived in caves seasonally. During this period, they began to cultivate gardens of maize (flint corn in particular) and squash, but no beans. They used &quot;manos&quot; and &quot;metates&quot; to grind corn, and the women made baskets for numerous uses.

===Late Basketmaker II (50 – 500)=== 
The people constructed primitive storage bins, cists, and shallow pit-houses. At this stage, evidence suggests that the beginning of a religious and decision-making structure had already developed. Shamanistic cults existed, and petroglyphs and other rock art indicate a ceremonial structure as well. Groups appear to be increasingly linked into larger-scale decision-making bodies.

===Basketmaker III (500 – 750)=== 
Deep pithouses were developed, along with some above-ground rooms. The bow and arrow replace the atlatl and spear. Plain bisque and some painted black-on-white pottery is made. Cultivation begins of beans, available due to trade from Central America, and edible due to slow cooking in pottery vessels. Wild amaranth and pinyon pine were also staples. People of this period may have domesticated turkeys.

The prototype &quot;kivas&quot; were large, round, and subterranean.

===Pueblo I Period (750 – 900)=== 
The Pueblo I Period saw increasing populations, growing village size, social integration, and more complicated and complex agricultural systems typified this Period. The construction and year-round occupation of pueblos begins; the people constructed reservoirs and canals to deal with scarce and irregular water resources. Large villages and great kivas appear, though pithouses still remain in use. Above-ground construction is of jacal or crude masonry. Plain gray bisque predominates in pottery, though some red bisque and pottery decorated in black and white appears.

===Pueblo II Period (900 – 1150)=== 
By AD 1050, Chaco Canyon (in present-day New Mexico) was a major regional center, with a population of 1,500–5,000 people. It is surrounded by standardized planned towns, or &quot;great houses&quot;, built from the wood of more than 200,000 trees. Thirty-foot-wide () roads, flanked by berms, radiate from Chaco in various directions. Small blocks of above-ground masonry rooms and a kiva make up a typical pueblo. Great kivas were up to in diameter. Pottery consists of corrugated gray bisque and decorated black-on-white in addition to some decorated red and orange vessels. The people imported shells and turquoise from other cultures through trading.

During the 12th century, populations began to grow after a decline at the end of the Pueblo II Period. More intense agriculture was characteristic, with terracing and irrigation common.

===Pueblo III Period (1150 – 1350)=== 
Settlements consist of large pueblos, cliff dwellings, towers and turkey pens. Most villages in the Four Corners area are abandoned by AD 1300. The distinction between the &quot;Hohokam&quot; and Ancient Pueblo people becomes blurred.

===Pueblo IV Period (1350 – 1600)===
Typically, large pueblos are centered around a plaza. Socially, this was a period of more conflict than cooperation, which is thought to have led to abandonment of settlements at Mesa Verde. The people began making kachinas for religious and ritual purposes. Plain pottery supplants corrugated. Red, orange and yellow pottery is on the rise as the black-on-white declines. Cotton is introduced and grown as a commodity.

The Puebloans are joined by other cultures. As early as the 15th century, the Navajo were in the process of migrating into the region from the north. In the next century, the Spanish colonists first came in the 1540s from the south.

===Pueblo V Period (1600 – present)=== 
The Spanish dominate and take over sites such as the Acoma Pueblo. Their arrival sends Pueblo subcultures underground.

<doc id="378297" wikidata="Q786014" url="?curid=378297" title="Rest area">
<text>A rest area is a public facility located next to a large thoroughfare such as a motorway, expressway, or highway, at which drivers and passengers can rest, eat, or refuel without exiting onto secondary roads. Other names include motorway service area (UK), services (UK), travel plaza, rest stop, oasis (US), service area, rest and service area (RSA), resto, service plaza, lay-by, service centre, and onroute (Canada). Facilities may include park-like areas, fuel stations, public toilets, water fountains, restaurants, and dump and fill stations for caravans / motorhomes.

A rest area with limited to no public facilities is a lay-by, parking area, scenic area, or scenic overlook. Along some highways and roads are services known as wayside parks, roadside parks, or picnic areas.

== Overview ==
The availability, standards and upkeep of facilities at a stop vary by jurisdiction. Service stations have parking areas allotted for cars and trucks, articulated trucks, as well as buses and caravans.

Most state-run rest areas tend to be located in more remote or rural areas, where there are likely no fast food eateries (let alone any full-service restaurants), fuel stations, hotels, campgrounds or other roadside services nearby. The locations of these remote rest areas are usually marked by signs on the freeway or motorway; for example, a sign may read, &quot;Next Rest Area 64 miles&quot;, &quot;Next Services 48 miles&quot; or &quot;Next Rest Stop 10 km&quot;.

Driving information is usually available at these locations, such as posted maps and other local information, along with public toilets; again, however, depending on the location or standards of the area, some stops have rows of portable toilets (&quot;porta-potties&quot;) available rather than a more permanent structure or restroom building. Some rest areas have visitor information kiosks, or even stations with staff on duty. There may also be drinking fountains, vending machines, pay telephones, a fuel station, a restaurant/food court, or a convenience store at a service area. Some rest areas provide free coffee for long-distance drivers, paid-for by donations from other travelers (and-or donations from local businesses, civic groups, churches, etc.). Many service stations have Wi-Fi access, bookshops and newsstands. Many scenic rest areas have picnic areas. Service areas tend to have traveller information in the form of so-called &quot;exit guides&quot;, which often contain very basic maps and advertisements for local motels and nearby tourist attractions.

Privatised commercial services may take the form of a truck stop complete with a filling station, arcade video games, and even a children&#x27;s recreation area or playground, as well as shower and laundry facilities, nearby fast food eateries(s), or their own cafeteria or food court, all under one roof, immediately adjacent to the motorway. Some offer business and financial services, such as ATMs, fax machines, office cubicles, as well as the aforementioned internet access.

=== Safety issues ===
Some rest areas have the reputations of being unsafe with regard to crime, especially at night, since they are usually situated in remote or rural areas and inherently attract transient individuals. California&#x27;s current policy is to maintain existing public rest areas but no longer build new ones, due to the cost and difficulty of keeping them safe, although many California rest stops now feature highway patrol quarters.

== Asia ==

In Malaysia, Indonesia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey, rest areas have prayer rooms (&quot;musola&quot;) for Muslims travelling more than (2 &quot;marhalah&quot;; 1 &quot;marhalah&quot; ≈ ).
In Iran it is called Esterāhatgāh (Persian:استراحتگاه) meaning the rest area or rest place.

In Thailand and Vietnam, bus travel is common, and long-distance bus rides typically include stops at rest areas designed for bus passengers. These rest stops typically have a small restaurant as well as a small store for buying food. Some have proper restrooms and even souvenir shops.

=== Japan ===
In Japan, there are two grades of rest areas on Japan&#x27;s tolled expressways. These are part of the expressway system, allowing a person to stop without exiting the expressway, as exiting and reentering the tollway would lead to a higher overall toll for the trip. They are modeled and named after the motorway service stations in the United Kingdom.

The larger rest area is called a &quot;Service Area&quot;, abbreviated to SA. SAs are usually very large facilities with parking for hundreds of cars and many buses - offering toilets, smoking areas, convenience stores, pet relief areas, restaurants, regional souvenir shops, a filling station, and sometimes even tourist attractions, such as a Ferris wheel or a view of a famous location. They are usually spaced about one hour apart on the system, and often a planned stop for tour buses. Two Service Areas also have a motel. The other grade of rest stop is a &quot;Parking Area&quot;, or a PA. PAs are much smaller, and spaced roughly 20 minutes apart on the system. Besides a small parking lot, toilets and drink vending machines are the only consistent amenities offered, while some larger parking areas have small shops, local goods, and occasionally a filling station - but are much smaller than their larger Service Area counterparts.

Since 1990s, many Japanese towns also established &quot;Roadside stations&quot; along highway and trunk route. In addition to conventional functions of service area, most of them also provide shops and restaurants dedicated to local culture and local produce, and a number of them would also feature information center, community hall, leisure facilities including hot springs and parks and such, and other features unique to individual stations. There are now over a thousand across Japan.

In the past, there were shukuba (stage stations) which serve as resting place for people travelling along traditional routes in Japan by horse or foot before modern transportation vehicles are introduced into Japan.

=== Malaysia ===
In Malaysia, an overhead bridge restaurant (OBR), or overhead restaurant, is a special rest area with restaurants above the expressway. Unlike typical laybys and RSAs, which are only accessible in one-way direction only, an overhead restaurant is accessible from both directions of the expressway.

=== Philippines ===
In the Philippines, barring certain exceptions, rest areas typically occupy large land areas with restaurants and retail space on top of filling stations. There are 10 service stations in the North Luzon Expressway, 9 service stations in the South Luzon Expressway, 3 service stations in both STAR Tollway and SCTEX, and a Caltex service station in Muntinlupa-Cavite Expressway.

In South Korea, a rest area usually includes a park and fast casual restaurants that sell regional specialties. Usually Korean rest areas are very large and clean. Cellphone charging is free and WiFi is available in every rest area.

=== Taiwan ===
In Taiwan, rest areas are maintained by the Freeway Bureau and the Directorate General of Highways. There are 16 rest areas along four important freeways: Freeways No.1 (Sun Yat-sen Freeway), 3 (Formosa Freeway), 5 (Chiang Wei-shui Memorial Freeway), 6 (Shuishalian Freeway) and one expressway (West Coast Expressway).

=== Thailand ===

In Thailand, rest areas are considered part of the national highway. Especially on intercity highways (Motorways) which are under the supervision of the Department of Highways.

For standard rest areas in the areas of motorways and concession highways, they are divided into 3 types: (1) Service Centers, accommodation on large highways. with an area of approximately 50 rai or more (2) Service Area, medium-sized highway accommodation The area is about 20 rai or more. (3) Rest Stop, a small highway accommodation. with an area of approximately 5 acres or more.

There are four rest areas on motorways on Motorway 7 and Motorway 9 and there are plans to open for service in total 18 rest areas.

== Europe ==
In some countries, such as Spain, rest areas are uncommon, as motorists are directed to establishments that serve both the traveling public and the local population. In other areas, access to a rest area is impossible other than from a motorway. The Dutch rest area, &quot;De Lucht&quot;,(nl) is fairly typical of many European rest areas, in that it has no access roads—other than from the motorway, itself.

=== Austria and Germany ===
&#x27; (:de:Autobahnraststätte) is the name for service areas on the German and Austrian Autobahn. They often include a fuel station, public phones, restaurants, restrooms, parking and, occasionally, a hotel or a motel. If the service area is off the motorway, it is named &quot;Rasthof&quot; or &#x27;.

Smaller parking areas, mostly known as a &quot;&quot; (:de:Rastplatz), are more frequent, but they have only picnic tables, and sometimes, toilets (signposted).

=== Finland ===
Rest areas are constructed and maintained by the Finnish government, while the local municipality provides area maps and sanitary services. If there are commercial services, the shop inherits the responsibility for cleanliness and upkeep of the area. Rest areas are designed mostly for long-distance drivers. The recommendation in Finland is that there should be a rest area each 20 km (12.4 mi).

=== France ===
In France, both full-service rest areas and picnic sites are provided on the autoroute network, and regulations dictate there to be one such area every . Both types may also be found on national (N-class) highways, although less frequently than on autoroutes. They are known as &#x27;, or &#x27; and &#x27;, respectively; &#x27; (&quot;rest area&quot;) usually refers to a picnic stop. These areas are not usually stated on approach signs, but are rather distinguished by the symbols used. A name is usually given, generally that of a nearby town or village, such as &quot;&quot;. 

=== United Kingdom and Ireland ===

The term &quot;rest area&quot; is not generally used in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The most common terms are &quot;motorway service areas&quot; (MSA), &quot;motorway service stations&quot; or simply &quot;services&quot;. As with the rest of the world, these are places where drivers can leave a motorway to refuel, rest, or get refreshments. Most service stations accommodate fast food outlets, restaurants, coffee shops, general goods and mini supermarkets. Some service stations also incorporate hotels.

Services may also be present on non-motorway roads, as well; many A-roads have services, possibly only providing a petrol station and, in some cases, a restaurant or café.

The majority of service areas within Ireland are operated by Circle K or Applegreen, and contain fuel stations, truck stops, shops and fast food outlets, such as McDonalds, Burger King, Subway or Chopstix; they differ, from the United Kingdom for example, in that only one service station contains a hotel (the M7 services in Portlaoise, County Laois).

====Lay-bys====

The term &quot;lay-by&quot; is used in the UK and Ireland to describe a roadside parking or rest area for drivers. Equivalent terms in the United States are &quot;turnout&quot; or &quot;pullout&quot;.

Lay-bys can vary in size, from a simple parking bay alongside the carriageway (sufficient for one or two cars only) to substantial areas that are separated from the carriageway by verges, which can accommodate dozens of vehicles.
Lay-bys are to be found on the side of most rural UK roads, except motorways that are not on sections of smart motorways (but for emergencies only) where the hard shoulder is missing. They are marked by a rectangular blue sign bearing a white letter P, and there should also be advance warning of lay-bys to give drivers time to slow down safely.

== North America ==
=== Canada ===
In Canada, roadside services are known as service centres in most provinces and onroutes in Ontario. In some instances, where there are no retail facilities, they may be known as rest areas or text stops (&#x27;halte-texto&#x27; in French). Most service centres are concentrated along Ontario&#x27;s 400-series highway and Quebec&#x27;s Autoroute networks, while rest areas are found along the highway networks of all provinces, and the Trans-Canada Highway.

Nova Scotia has constructed a small number of full-fledged service centres along its 100-Series Highways.

In New Brunswick, the only rest areas are roadside parks with picnic tables and washrooms operated as a part of the provincial park system, but many have closed due to cutbacks. Occasionally, litter barrels are also found along the side of the road.

The Prairie provinces of (Saskatchewan, and Manitoba) have rest stops located along the Trans-Canada Highway (Highway 1). However, these stops are simply places to rest, or go to the washroom; they are not built to the standard rest area found on the 400-series highways in Ontario, or the Interstate Highways of the United States.

====Alberta====
Alberta Transportation operates seven &quot;provincial rest areas&quot; or &quot;safety rest areas&quot;. These include:

*Highway 1 (Trans-Canada Highway) westbound between Brooks and Bassano;
*Highway 1 (Trans-Canada Highway) eastbound between Tilley and Suffield;
*Highway 2 (Queen Elizabeth II Highway) southbound between Crossfield and Airdrie;
*Highway 2 (Queen Elizabeth II Highway) northbound near Highway 13 west of Wetaskiwin;
*Highway 16 (Yellowhead Highway) eastbound and westbound between Edson and Carrot Creek;
*Highway 43 accessible from both directions south of Valleyview; and
*Highway 63 accessible both ways between Atmore and Breynat.

Alberta Transportation also designates &quot;partnership rest areas&quot; or &quot;highway service rest areas&quot; that are privately owned and operated highway user facilities. These facilities are located on Highway 1 at Dead Man&#x27;s Flats, Highway 2 at Red Deer (Gasoline Alley), Highway 9 near Hanna, Highway 16 at Niton Junction and at Innisfree, and Highway 43 at Rochfort Bridge.

====British Columbia====
British Columbia has many services centres on its provincial roads, particularly along the Yellowhead Highway/Highway 16, the Coquihalla Highway/Highway 5, and on Highway 97C, the first service centres built in the province. One notable curiosity is a service centre built along Highway 118: it is a minor road connecting two towns to the Yellowhead Highway (Hwy. 16).

====Ontario====

Ontario has a modern and well-developed network of service centres, now mostly known as ONroute, located along Highway 401 along the Quebec City-Windsor Corridor, as well as sections of Highway 400. However, shorter and/or less trafficked 400-series highways (including the northern sections of Highway 400), do not have even basic rest areas along them at all.

The original service centres for Highway 401 were mostly built around 1962. In 1991, one was placed at the west end of the Greater Toronto Area, serving eastbound traffic in Mississauga; this location was branded as &quot;Info Centre&quot; and was intended as a welcome centre for Toronto. The Mississauga travel centre closed on September 30, 2006.

Most of the original 1960s-era service centres on highways 400 and 401 were demolished in 2010, with new buildings constructed on the original sites and operated by HMSHost subsidiary Host Kilmer under the ONroute banner.

The service centres in Ontario were originally of a generic, cafeteria-style nature. They contain filling stations, washrooms, picnic areas, and vending machines. During the late 1980s the service centres were taken over by Scott&#x27;s Hospitality, a major publicly traded Canadian restaurant operator, who leased them out to major oil companies and fast food restaurant chains, with a single gasoline distributor and sole restaurant for most locations. In 2010–11, most of the older service centres were replaced by a common design operated by ONroute, which features a selection of fast food providers akin to a food court.

Outside of the ONRoute locations there are 211 rest areas along provincial highways. Most are basic stops (picnic area) with restrooms for most locations and parking for most vehicles (commercial trucks may not be serviced at small areas). Most are seasonal operated from mid May to mid November.

Reese&#x27;s Corner at the intersection of Highway 21 and Highway 7 is often considered a service centre. Although Highway 7 was bypassed by the freeway Highway 402 in the late 1970s, Reese&#x27;s Corner still receives much traffic as it is only a short distance from the interchange of Highway 402 and Highway 21 (Exit 25). Lastly, truck inspection stations (which are more frequent than service centres) can be used by travellers for bathroom breaks, although this is not encouraged.

Two off-highway service campuses at Exit 74 along the Queen Elizabeth Way in Grimsby are unofficial rest areas for travelling motorists. Two smaller such facilities (Seguin Trail Road south of Parry Sound and Port Severn Road in Port Severn) also exist on the less-busy section Highway 400 north of the last official on-highway service centre.

====Quebec====
In Quebec, rest areas are known as &#x27; and service areas as &#x27;. Rest rooms and picnic areas are located along the autoroutes and many of the provincial highways. Some of the rest areas have vending machines and/or canteens. Some truck and isolated rest areas have no services or they have been removed due to facilities having deteriorated beyond repair. Beginning in 2019, the province began to modernize some rest areas to provide needs for families and truckers.

There are about 10 service areas (on Highways 10, 15, 20, 40, 55, 117, and 175); with some of these rest areas have restrooms, filling stations and restaurants/vending machines.

=== United States ===


In the United States, rest areas are typically non-commercial facilities that provide, at a minimum, parking and restrooms. In the United States, there are 1,840 rest areas along interstate routes. Some may have information kiosks, vending machines, and picnic areas, but little else, while some have &quot;dump&quot; facilities, where recreational vehicles may empty their sewage holding tanks. They are typically maintained and funded by the departments of transportation of the state governments. For example, rest areas in California are maintained by Caltrans. In 2008, state governments began to close some rest areas as a result of the Great Recession.

Some places, such as California, have laws that explicitly prohibit private retailers from occupying rest stops. A federal statute passed by Congress also prohibits states from allowing private businesses to occupy rest areas along interstate highways. The relevant clause of 23 U.S.C. § 111 states:

The State will not permit automotive service stations or other commercial establishments for serving motor vehicle users to be constructed or located on the rights-of-way of the Interstate System.
The original reason for this clause was to protect innumerable small towns whose survival depended upon providing roadside services such as gasoline, food, and lodging. Because of it, private truck stops and travel plazas have blossomed into a $171 billion industry in the United States. The clause was immediately followed by an exception for facilities constructed prior to January 1, 1960, many of which continue to exist, as explained further below.

Therefore, the standard practice is that private businesses must buy up land near existing exits and build their own facilities to serve travelers. Such facilities often have tall signs that can be seen from several miles away (so that travelers have adequate time to make a decision). In turn, it is somewhat harder to visit such private facilities, because one has to first exit the freeway and navigate through several intersections to reach a desired business&#x27;s parking lot, rather than exit directly into a rest area&#x27;s parking lot. Public rest areas are usually (but not always) positioned so as not to compete with private businesses.

Special blue signs indicating gas, food, lodging, camping and roadside attractions near an exit can be found on most freeways in the United States. Beginning in the mid-1970s, private businesses have been permitted to display their logos or trademarks on these signs by paying a transportation department (or a subcontractor to a transportation department) a small fee. Until the release of the 2000 edition of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, these signs were allowed only on the rural sections of highways. The 2000 MUTCD added provisions for allowing these signs on highways in urban areas as long as adequate sign spacing can be maintained, however, some states (such as California and New York) continue to restrict these signs to rural areas only. These signs are allowed on urban freeways in 15 states, with Arizona being the most recent state (as of 2013) to repeal the restriction of these signs to only rural highways.
Attempts to remove the federal ban on privatized rest areas have been generally unsuccessful, due to resistance from existing businesses that have already made enormous capital investments in their existing locations.

For example, in 2003, Congress&#x27;s federal highway funding reauthorization bill contained a clause allowing states to start experimenting with privatized rest areas on Interstate highways. The clause was fiercely resisted by the National Association of Truck Stop Owners (NATSO), which argued that allowing such rest areas would shift revenue to state governments (in the form of lease payments) that would have gone to local governments (in the form of property and sales taxes). NATSO also argued that by destroying private commercial truck stops, the bill would result in an epidemic of drowsy truck drivers, since such stops provide about 90% of the parking spaces used by American truck drivers while in transit.

==== Service areas ====
Prior to the creation of the Interstate Highway System, many states east of the Rocky Mountains had already started building and operating their own long-distance intercity toll roads (turnpikes). To help recover construction costs, most turnpike operators leased concession space at rest areas to private businesses. In addition, the use of this sort of service area allows drivers to stop for food and fuel without passing through additional tollbooths and thereby incurring a higher toll.

Pennsylvania, which opened the first such highway in 1940 with the mainline Pennsylvania Turnpike, was the model for many subsequent areas. Instead of operating the service areas themselves, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission opted to lease them out to Standard Oil of Pennsylvania (which was acquired shortly afterward by the modern-day Exxon), which in turn operated a Filling station with a garage and Howard Johnson&#x27;s franchises as a restaurant offering. The turnpike leases the filling station space to Sunoco (which operates 7-Eleven convenience stores instead of garages at the sites) and, as of 2021, the rest of the service area space to Applegreen.

In the summer of 2021, Iris Buyer LLC (an Applegreen company) announced that they were acquiring all travel plazas by HMSHost. The deal reached an agreement at the end of July 2021 officially transferring ownership. The New York State Thruway Service Areas (which will be owned by another company by Applegreen) was not affected by this transition due to the fact that Host&#x27;s contract was expired. As of July 2022, Connecticut, Delaware, Indiana, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia have service areas that are operated or have stake by Applegreen.

Some turnpikes, such as Florida&#x27;s Turnpike, were never integrated into the Interstate system and never became subject to the federal ban on private businesses. On turnpikes that did become Interstates, all privatized rest areas in operation prior to January 1, 1960, were allowed to continue operating. Such facilities are often called &quot;service areas&quot; by the public and in road atlases, but each state varies:
* Connecticut, Florida, Maine, Massachusetts, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia – service plaza
* Delaware, Kansas, Maryland, and Oklahoma – service area
* Illinois – oasis
* Indiana and New York – travel plaza
* New Jersey – service area or service plaza

Some states, such as Ohio, allow nonprofit organizations to run a concession trailer in a rest area.

Started in 2015(ish), The New Jersey Turnpike and Garden State Parkway Service Areas started advertising and selling products from Popcorn for The People. It is a non-profit organization which creates employment for people with disabilities, specifically Autism.

==== Text stops ====
In 2013, the state of New York launched &quot;It Can Wait&quot;, a program for encouraging drivers to pause at rest stops and parking areas along state roads to text (thereby avoiding texting while driving), by designating all such areas &quot;text stops&quot;. The practice involves placing road signs which indicate the nearest &quot;texting zone&quot; at which to legally stop and use mobile devices such as smartphones.

==== Welcome centers ====


A rest area often located near state or municipal borders in the United States is sometimes called a welcome center. Welcome centers tend to be larger than regular rest areas, and are staffed at peak travel times with one or more employees who advise travelers as to their options. Some welcome centers contain a small museum or at least a basic information kiosk about the state. Because air travel has made it possible to enter and leave many states without crossing the state line at ground level, some states, like California, have official welcome centers inside major cities far from their state borders. In some states (such as Massachusetts), these rest areas are called tourist information centers and in others (such as New Jersey), visitor centers.

====Other types====
Rest areas without modern restrooms are called &#x27;waysides&#x27;. These locations have parking spaces for trucks and cars, or for semi-trailer trucks only. Some have portable toilets and waste containers. In Missouri these locations are called &#x27;Roadside Parks&#x27; or &#x27;Roadside Tables&#x27;.

The most basic parking areas have no facilities of any kind; they consist solely of a paved shoulder on the side of the highway where travelers can rest for a short time. A scenic area is similar to a parking area, but it is provided to the traveler in a place of natural beauty. These are also called &quot;scenic overlooks&quot;.

== Oceania ==
===Australia===
Rest areas in Australia are a common feature of the road network in rural areas. They are the responsibility of a variety of authorities, such as a state transport or main roads bureau, or a local government&#x27;s works department. Facilities and standards vary widely and unpredictably: a well-appointed rest area will have bins to deposit small items of litter, a picnic table with seating, a cold water tap (sometimes fed by a rainwater tank), barbecue fireplace (sometimes gas or electric), toilets, and – less commonly – showers. Other rest areas, especially in more remote locations, may lack some or even all of these facilities: in South Australia, a rest area may be no more than a cleared section besides the road with a sign indicating its purpose. Rest areas in Australia do not provide service stations or restaurants (such facilities would be called roadhouses or truck stops), although there may be caravans, often run by charities, providing refreshments to travellers.

Comfort and hygiene are important considerations for the responsible authorities, as such remote sites can be very expensive to clean and maintain, and vandalism is common. Also, Australia&#x27;s dependence on road transport by heavy vehicles can lead to competition between the amenity needs of recreational travelers and those of the drivers of heavy vehicles—so much so that on arterial routes it is common to see rest areas specifically signed to segregate the two user groups entirely. Thus rest areas generally do not allow overnight occupation. In Queensland, however, well-maintained rest areas sometimes explicitly invite travelers to stay overnight, as a road safety measure, but this is rare elsewhere.

<text>The silver arowana (Osteoglossum bicirrhosum) is a South American freshwater bony fish of the family Osteoglossidae. Silver arowanas are sometimes kept in aquariums, but they are predatory and require a very large tank.

The generic name &quot;Osteoglossum&quot; means &quot;bone-tongued&quot; and the specific name &quot;bicirrhosum&quot; means &quot;two barbels&quot; (from the Greek language).

==Range and habitat==
This South American species is native to the Amazon, Essequibo and Oyapock basins. It is absent from the Rio Negro basin, except the Branco River and the Preto River, which is inhabited by both silver and black arowanas.

The silver arowana occurs in both black- and whitewater habitats, including flooded forests.

==Description==
This fish has relatively large scales, a long body, and a tapered tail, with the dorsal and anal fins extending all the way to the small caudal fin, with which they are nearly fused. Its maximum total length is typically considered to be , but there are reports of individuals up to . Unlike the black arowana, the silver arowana has the same coloring throughout its lifespan. Adults of the two species are very similar, but can be separated by meristics.

Arowanas are sometimes called &#x27;dragon fish&#x27; by aquarists because their shiny, armor-like scales and double barbels are reminiscent of descriptions of dragons in East Asian folklore.

==Behavior==
The species is also called &#x27;water monkey&#x27; because of its ability to jump out of the water and capture its prey. It usually swims near the water surface waiting for potential prey. Although specimens have been found with the remains of birds, bats, mice, and snakes in their stomachs, its main diet consists of snails, crustaceans (such as crabs), insects (such as beetles), spiders, smaller fish, and other animals that float on the water surface, for which purpose its drawbridge-like mouth is adapted.

==Conservation status==
The silver arowana is not currently listed on any CITES appendix and is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. It is one of the most popular ornamental fish from South America, however, and therefore its conservation status merits attention. Other threats include droughts and deforestation, siltation and drainage of land for human use.

As reported by &quot;Environment News Service&quot; in August 2005, shared use of the silver arowana population was a cause for a dispute between Brazilian and Colombian authorities. Juvenile silver arowanas are caught in Colombia for sale as aquarium fish, while the people of Brazilian Amazonia catch adult fish for food. A sharp drop in the number of arowanas had caused Brazilian authorities to prohibit fishing of them between September 1 and November 15; the Colombians would prohibit capturing them between November 1 and March 15.

The silver arowana is often kept as a pet by experienced aquarists, being considered an accessible substitute for the Asian arowana, which is listed on CITES Appendix I and is therefore difficult and expensive to obtain legally.

<text>Clydesdale Bank () is a trading name used by Clydesdale Bank plc for its retail banking operations in Scotland.

In June 2018, it was announced that Clydesdale Bank plc&#x27;s holding company, CYBG, would acquire Virgin Money for £1.7 billion in an all-stock deal, and that Clydesdale Bank plc&#x27;s Clydesdale Bank, Yorkshire Bank and B brands would be phased out in favour of Virgin Money&#x27;s brand, including the renaming of parent company CYBG plc to Virgin Money UK plc. Clydesdale Bank, along with Virgin Money and Yorkshire Bank (B&#x27;s rebrand to Virgin Money was completed in 2019), currently operate as trading divisions of Clydesdale Bank plc under its banking licence.

==History==
==Banknotes==
Following the announcement of the CYBG&#x27;s takeover of Virgin Money in 2018 and planned phasing-out of the Clydesdale Bank brand by 2021 in favour of Virgin Money, it was announced that Virgin Money would continue to issue banknotes under the Clydesdale brand after 2021.

===Banknote history===
Until prevented by the Bank Charter Act 1844, privately owned banks in Great Britain and Ireland were permitted to issue their own banknotes, and money issued by provincial Scottish, English, Welsh and Irish banking companies circulated freely as a means of payment. While the Bank of England eventually gained a monopoly for issuing banknotes in England and Wales, banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland retained the right to issue their own banknotes and continue to do so to this day. In Scotland, Clydesdale Bank, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Bank of Scotland still print their own banknotes.

===2009 issue===
The current designs were released in autumn 2009. The obverse designs feature famous Scots while the reverse designs feature Scotland&#x27;s UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

===Previous issue===

The previous series of Clydesdale notes each depicted a notable person from Scottish history:

* 5 pound note featuring Robert Burns on the obverse and a vignette of a field mouse from Burns&#x27; poem &quot;To a Mouse&quot; on the reverse
* 10 pound note featuring Mary Slessor on the front and a vignette of a map of Calabar and African missionary scenes on the back
* 20 pound note featuring Robert the Bruce on the front and a vignette of the Bruce on horseback with the Monymusk Reliquary against a background of Stirling Castle on the back
* 50 pound note featuring Adam Smith on the front and a vignette of industry tools against a background of sailing ships on the back
* 100 pound note featuring Lord Kelvin on the front and a vignette of the University of Glasgow on the back

An image of Adam Smith also features on the £20 note issued in 2007 by the Bank of England, granting Smith the unique status of being the only person to feature on banknotes issued by two different British banks, and the first Scot to appear on a Bank of England banknote.

===Older issues===
The Clydesdale Bank ceased issuing £1 notes in the late 1980s. These latterly had an image of Robert the Bruce, whilst the contemporaneous £20 notes had an image of Lord Kelvin.

The £10 notes issued from 1971 bore an image of Scottish explorer David Livingstone with palm tree leaves and an illustration of African tribesmen on the back. A later issue showed Livingstone against a background graphic of a map of his Zambezi expedition, showing the River Zambezi, Victoria Falls, Lake Nyasa and Blantyre, Malawi; on the reverse, the African figures were replaced with an image of Livingstone&#x27;s birthplace in Blantyre.

===Commemorative banknotes===
Occasionally the Clydesdale Bank issues special commemorative banknotes to mark particular occasions or to celebrate famous people. These notes are much sought-after by collectors and they rarely remain long in circulation. Examples to date have included:

* a £5 issued in 1996 to commemorate the poetry of Robert Burns. On the front of the notes is an overprint of his poems above the portrait.
* a £10 issued in 1997 to commemorate the work of Mary Slessor. On the back of the note is the map of Calabar and Mary Slessor along with a group of Africans.
* a £20 to the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Edinburgh, October 1997, showing on the reverse the Edinburgh International Conference Centre where the meeting was held, along with Edinburgh Castle in the background and the new Clydesdale Bank building at Tollcross, Edinburgh
* a £20 note to mark Glasgow&#x27;s celebrations as UK City of Architecture and Design, featuring a portrait of Glaswegian architect Alexander &quot;Greek&quot; Thomson; on the reverse is an illustration of the Lighthouse building by Charles Rennie Mackintosh and the dome of Thomson&#x27;s Holmwood House (1999)
* a £20 to mark the 700th anniversary of Robert the Bruce&#x27;s coronation, featuring the coat of arms used by the Bruce on the front and a narrative commemorating the anniversary on the rear
* a £10 note to mark the bank&#x27;s sponsorship of the Scottish Commonwealth Games team, depicting the team logo on the front, and on the rear a montage of all the events at the games (2006)
* a £5 note featuring a portrait of the Scottish civil engineer, Sir William Arrol and the image of the Forth Bridge to mark the 125th anniversary of the construction of the bridge; this issue is noted as it is printed on polymer rather than paper (see below).

===Polymer banknotes===
In March 2015, the Clydesdale Bank became the first bank in Great Britain to issue polymer banknotes. The £5 commemorative notes, issued to commemorate the 125th anniversary of the construction of the Forth Bridge, are printed by De La Rue and are the first in Europe to use the company&#x27;s &quot;Safeguard&quot; polymer substrate security feature. The notes also use the &quot;Spark Orbital&quot; security feature which depicts a reflective map of Scotland over a transparent &quot;window&quot; in the banknote.

Although the Clydesdale&#x27;s 2015 issue are the first plastic banknotes issued within Great Britain, these are not the first polymer banknotes to be issued in the United Kingdom — in 1999, the Northern Bank (now Danske Bank) issued a series of polymer £5 notes depicting the US Space Shuttle. The Bank of England issued a polymer £5 note for the first time in September 2016.

==Commonwealth Games==

In March 2005, Clydesdale Bank became one of the official partners of the Scottish Commonwealth Games Team, at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, Australia. This sponsorship builds on the relationship formed by its parent, NAB Group, who are one of the Games&#x27; main sponsors as well as a key partner with the Australian team, whilst the sister company, Bank of New Zealand, has joined forces to support its national team. The bank also released a series of Ten Pound (£10) notes with a Commonwealth Games related theme for the occasion.

<text>A kiva (also &quot;estufa&quot;) is a space used by Puebloans for rites and political meetings, many of them associated with the kachina belief system. Among the modern Hopi and most other Pueblo peoples, &quot;kiva&quot; means a large room that is circular and underground, and used for spiritual ceremonies and a place of worship.

Similar subterranean rooms are found among ruins in the Southwestern United States, indicating uses by the ancient peoples of the region including the ancestral Puebloans, the Mogollon, and the Hohokam. Those used by the ancient Pueblos of the Pueblo I Period and following, designated by the Pecos Classification system developed by archaeologists, were usually round and evolved from simpler pit-houses. For the Ancestral Puebloans, these rooms are believed to have had a variety of functions, including domestic residence along with social and ceremonial purposes.

==Evolution==

During the late 8th century, Mesa Verdeans started building square pit structures that archeologists call protokivas. They were typically deep and in diameter. By the mid-10th and early 11th centuries, these had evolved into smaller circular structures called kivas, which were usually across. Mesa Verde-style kivas included a feature from earlier times called a &quot;sipapu&quot;, which is a hole dug in the north of the chamber that is thought to represent the Ancestral Puebloans&#x27; place of emergence from the underworld.

When designating an ancient room as a &quot;kiva&quot;, archaeologists make assumptions about the room&#x27;s original functions and how those functions may be similar to or differ from kivas used in modern practice. The kachina belief system appears to have emerged in the South-West around A.D. 1250, while kiva-like structures occurred much earlier. This suggests that the room&#x27;s older functions may have been changed or adapted to suit the new religious practice.

As cultural changes occurred, particularly during the Pueblo III period between 1150 and 1300, kivas continued to have a prominent place in the community. However, some kivas were built above ground. Kiva architecture became more elaborate, with tower kivas and great kivas incorporating specialized floor features. For example, kivas found in Mesa Verde National Park were generally keyhole-shaped. In most larger communities, it was normal to find one kiva for each five or six rooms. Kiva destruction, primarily by burning, has been seen as a strong archaeological indicator of conflict and warfare among people of the South-West during this period.

Fifteen top rooms encircle the central chamber of the vast Great Kiva at Aztec Ruins National Monument. The rooms&#x27;

After 1325 or 1350, except in the Hopi and Pueblo region, the ratio changed from 60 to 90 rooms for each kiva. This may indicate a religious or organizational change within the society, perhaps affecting the status and number of clans among the Pueblo people.

==Great kiva==
Great kivas differ from regular kivas, which archeologists call Chaco-style kivas (although Chaco Canyon also features great kivas), in several ways; first and foremost, great kivas are always much larger and deeper than Chaco-style kivas. Whereas the walls of great kivas always extend above the surrounding landscape, the walls of Chaco-style kivas do not, but are instead flush with the surrounding landscape. Chaco-style kivas are often found incorporated into the central room blocks of great houses, but great kivas are always separate from core structures. Great kivas almost always have a bench that encircles the inner space, but this feature is not found in Chaco-style kivas. Great kivas also tend to include floor vaults, which might have served as foot drums for ceremonial dancers, but Chaco-style kivas do not. Great kivas are believed to be the first public buildings constructed in the Mesa Verde region.

<doc id="378310" wikidata="Q245955" url="?curid=378310" title="Self-balancing binary search tree">
<text>In computer science, a self-balancing binary search tree (BST) is any node-based binary search tree that automatically keeps its height (maximal number of levels below the root) small in the face of arbitrary item insertions and deletions.
These operations when designed for a self-balancing binary search tree, contain precautionary measures against boundlessly increasing tree height, so that these abstract data structures receive the attribute &quot;self-balancing&quot;.

For height-balanced binary trees, the height is defined to be logarithmic formula_1 in the number formula_2 of items. This is the case for many binary search trees, such as AVL trees and red–black trees. Splay trees and treaps are self-balancing but not height-balanced, as their height is not guaranteed to be logarithmic in the number of items.

Self-balancing binary search trees provide efficient implementations for mutable ordered lists, and can be used for other abstract data structures such as associative arrays, priority queues and sets.

== Overview ==

Most operations on a binary search tree (BST) take time directly proportional to the height of the tree, so it is desirable to keep the height small. A binary tree with height &quot;h&quot; can contain at most 20+21+···+2&quot;h&quot; = 2&quot;h&quot;+1−1 nodes. It follows that for any tree with &quot;n&quot; nodes and height &quot;h&quot;:

:formula_3

And that implies:

:formula_4.

In other words, the minimum height of a binary tree with &quot;n&quot; nodes is rounded down; that is, formula_5.

However, the simplest algorithms for BST item insertion may yield a tree with height &quot;n&quot; in rather common situations. For example, when the items are inserted in sorted key order, the tree degenerates into a linked list with &quot;n&quot; nodes. The difference in performance between the two situations may be enormous: for example, when &quot;n&quot; = 1,000,000, the minimum height is formula_6.

If the data items are known ahead of time, the height can be kept small, in the average sense, by adding values in a random order, resulting in a random binary search tree. However, there are many situations (such as online algorithms) where this randomization is not viable.

Self-balancing binary trees solve this problem by performing transformations on the tree (such as tree rotations) at key insertion times, in order to keep the height proportional to Although a certain overhead is involved, it is not bigger than the always necessary lookup cost and may be justified by ensuring fast execution of all operations.

While it is possible to maintain a BST with minimum height with expected formula_1 time operations (lookup/insertion/removal), the additional space requirements required to maintain such a structure tend to outweigh the decrease in search time. For comparison, an AVL tree is guaranteed to be within a factor of 1.44 of the optimal height while requiring only two additional bits of storage in a naive implementation. Therefore, most self-balancing BST algorithms keep the height within a constant factor of this lower bound.

In the asymptotic (&quot;Big-O&quot;) sense, a self-balancing BST structure containing &quot;n&quot; items allows the lookup, insertion, and removal of an item in formula_1 worst-case time, and ordered enumeration of all items in formula_9 time. For some implementations these are per-operation time bounds, while for others they are amortized bounds over a sequence of operations. These times are asymptotically optimal among all data structures that manipulate the key only through comparisons.

== Implementations ==
Data structures implementing this type of tree include:

* AA tree
* AVL tree
* Red–black tree
* Scapegoat tree
* Tango tree
* Treap
* Weight-balanced tree

== Applications ==
Self-balancing binary search trees can be used in a natural way to construct and maintain ordered lists, such as priority queues. They can also be used for associative arrays; key-value pairs are simply inserted with an ordering based on the key alone. In this capacity, self-balancing BSTs have a number of advantages and disadvantages over their main competitor, hash tables. One advantage of self-balancing BSTs is that they allow fast (indeed, asymptotically optimal) enumeration of the items &quot;in key order&quot;, which hash tables do not provide. One disadvantage is that their lookup algorithms get more complicated when there may be multiple items with the same key. Self-balancing BSTs have better worst-case lookup performance than most hash tables (formula_1 compared to formula_9), but have worse average-case performance (formula_1 compared to formula_13).

Self-balancing BSTs can be used to implement any algorithm that requires mutable ordered lists, to achieve optimal worst-case asymptotic performance. For example, if binary tree sort is implemented with a self-balancing BST, we have a very simple-to-describe yet asymptotically optimal formula_14 sorting algorithm. Similarly, many algorithms in computational geometry exploit variations on self-balancing BSTs to solve problems such as the line segment intersection problem and the point location problem efficiently. (For average-case performance, however, self-balancing BSTs may be less efficient than other solutions. Binary tree sort, in particular, is likely to be slower than merge sort, quicksort, or heapsort, because of the tree-balancing overhead as well as cache access patterns.)

Self-balancing BSTs are flexible data structures, in that it&#x27;s easy to extend them to efficiently record additional information or perform new operations. For example, one can record the number of nodes in each subtree having a certain property, allowing one to count the number of nodes in a certain key range with that property in formula_1 time. These extensions can be used, for example, to optimize database queries or other list-processing algorithms.

<text>The Asian arowana (Scleropages formosus) comprises several phenotypic varieties of freshwater fish distributed geographically across Southeast Asia. While most consider the different varieties to belong to a single species, work by Pouyaud &quot;et al.&quot; (2003) differentiates these varieties into multiple species. They have several other common names, including Asian bonytongue, dragonfish, and a number of names specific to the different color varieties.

Native to Southeast Asia, Asian arowanas inhabit blackwater rivers, slow-moving waters flowing through forested swamps and wetlands. Adults feed on other fish, while juveniles feed on insects.

These popular aquarium fish have special cultural significance in areas influenced by Chinese culture. The name &#x27;dragonfish&#x27; stems from their resemblance to the Chinese dragon. This popularity has had both positive and negative effects on their status as endangered species.

==Evolution and taxonomy==
Like all members of the Osteoglossidae, Asian arowanas are highly adapted to fresh water and are incapable of surviving in the ocean. Therefore, their spread throughout the islands of Southeast Asia suggests they diverged from other osteoglossids before the continental breakup of Pangaea was complete. Genetic studies have confirmed this hypothesis, showing the ancestor of the Asian arowanas diverged from the ancestor of the Australian arowanas, &quot;S. jardinii&quot; and &quot;S. leichardti&quot;, about 140 million years ago, during the Early Cretaceous period. This divergence took place in the eastern margin of Gondwanaland, with the ancestors of Asian arowanas carried on the Indian subcontinent or smaller landmasses into Asia. The morphological similarity of all &quot;Scleropages&quot; species shows little evolutionary change has taken place recently for these ancient fish.

The first description of this species was published in 1840 by German naturalists Salomon Müller and Hermann Schlegel, under the name &quot;Osteoglossum formosum&quot;, although later this species was placed in &quot;Scleropages&quot; with the name &quot;S. formosus&quot;.

Several distinct, naturally occurring colour varieties are recognised as haplotypes, each found in a specific geographic region. They include:

* The green is the most common variety, found in Indonesia (Kalimantan and Sumatra), Vietnam, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, and Malaysia.
* The silver Asian (not to be confused with the silver arowana, &quot;Osteoglossum bicirrhosum&quot;) is considered part of the green variety by some. It has two subvarieties, the &quot;grey tail silver&quot; or &quot;Pinoh arowana&quot;, and the &quot;yellow tail silver&quot;, each found in a different part of the island of Borneo.
* The red-tailed golden is found in northern Sumatra, Indonesia.
* The gold crossback, blue Malayan, or Bukit Merah blue is native to the state of Pahang and the Bukit Merah area in Perak, Peninsular Malaysia.
* The red, super red, blood red, or chili red is known only from the upper part of the Kapuas River and nearby lakes in western Indonesian part of Borneo.

In 2003, a study proposed splitting &quot;S. formosus&quot; into four separate species. This classification was based on both morphometrics and a phylogenetic analysis using the cytochrome b gene, and includes these species:

* &quot;Scleropages formosus&quot; was redescribed to include the strain known as the green arowana. The gold crossback, which was not part of the study, was included in this species by default, though it was suspected to be closely related to &quot;S. aureus&quot;.
* &quot;Scleropages macrocephalus&quot; described the silver Asian arowana.
* &quot;Scleropages aureus&quot; described the red-tailed golden arowana.
* &quot;Scleropages legendrei&quot; described the super red arowana.

The majority of researchers dispute this reclassification, arguing that the published data was insufficient to justify recognizing more than one Southeast Asian species of &quot;Scleropages&quot;, and that divergent haplotypes used to distinguish the color strains into isolated species were found within a single color strain, contradicting the findings. They are considered monotypic, consisting of closely related haplotypes.

==Description==

Asian arowanas grow up to total length. Like all &quot;Scleropages&quot;, Asian arowanas have long bodies; large, elongated pectoral fins, dorsal and anal fins located far back on the body; and a much larger caudal fin than that of their South American relative, the silver arowana, &quot;Osteoglossum bicirrhosum&quot;. The mouth is oblique with a very wide gape. The prominent lower jaw has two barbels at its tip. The gill rakers are stout. Asian arowanas bear teeth on many bones of the mouth, including the jaws, vomer, palatines, pterygoids, parasphenoid, and tongue.

Asian arowana scales are large, cycloid, and, in some varieties, metallic-coloured, with a distinctive mosaic pattern of raised ribs. The lateral scales are arranged in horizontal rows numbered from the most ventral (first level) to the most dorsal (fifth level), with dorsal scales designated the sixth level.

Asian arowanas are distinguished from Australian congenerics &quot;Scleropages jardinii&quot; and &quot;Scleropages leichardti&quot; by having fewer (21–26) lateral line scales (versus 32–36 for the Australian species), longer pectoral and pelvic fins, and a longer anterior snout.

Green arowanas are dark green on the back, silvery or golden green on its sides, and silvery or whitish on the ventral surface, with dark greenish or bluish patches visible through the lateral scales. In mature fish, the top of the eye and the head behind the eye are bright emerald.

Both grey-tailed and yellow-tailed silver Asian arowanas are dark grey on the back and silver on the sides, with dark ring patches on the lateral scales and a silvery or whitish belly. In yellow-tailed specimens, the fin membranes are yellowish with dark-grey rays. In grey-tailed specimens, the fins are uniformly dark grey.
Mature red-tailed golden arowanas have brilliant metallic gold lateral scales, gill covers, bellies, and pectoral and pelvic fin membranes, although the back is dark. In juveniles, the areas destined to develop golden colour start out metallic silver. The anal fin and the bottom portion of the caudal fin are light brown to dark red.

Mature gold crossback arowanas are distinguished from the red-tailed golden arowanas by having metallic gold crossing the back completely. This variety also lacks the reddish fins of the red-tailed golden.

In mature super red arowanas, the gill covers, lateral scales, and fin membranes of these fishes are metallic red, with the exact hue varying from gold-tinged to deep red. The back is dark brown. In juveniles, the darker the dorsal colouration, the deeper the red will be on maturity.

==Biology==

=== Reproduction ===
Unlike most fish, the Asian arowana reaches sexual maturity relatively late, after 3–4 yr. The females produce few eggs, 30–100, which are quite large. After the eggs are fertilized, the Asian arowana exhibits great parental care with paternal mouthbrooding. Both the fertilized eggs and larvae are brooded within the male&#x27;s mouth.

=== Behavior ===
They spend the day in the protection of &quot;Pandanus&quot; roots or other structures, and feed at night.
It is normally seen alone or in small groups.

==Relationship with humans==

===Cultural beliefs===
Asian arowanas are considered to be symbols of good luck and prosperity, especially by those from Continental Asian cultures. This reputation derives from the species&#x27; resemblance to the Chinese dragon, considered an auspicious symbol in Chinese mythology. The large metallic scales and double barbels are features shared by the Chinese dragon, and the large pectoral fins are said to make the fish resemble &quot;a dragon in full flight.&quot;

In Taoist divination, positive &quot;feng shui&quot; associations with water and the colours red and gold make these fishes popular for aquaria. One belief is that while water is a place where &quot;chi&quot; gathers, it is naturally a source of &quot;yin&quot; energy and must contain an &quot;auspicious&quot; fish such as an arowana to have balancing &quot;yang&quot; energy. Another is that a fish can preserve its owner from death by dying itself.

===Conservation===
Asian arowanas are listed as endangered by the current IUCN Red List, with the most recent evaluation taking place in 2019. International trade in these fishes is controlled under the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES), under which it was placed on Appendix I, the most restrictive category, in 1975. &quot;S. formosus&quot; is one of only eight fish species listed on Appendix I. A number of registered CITES breeders are in Asia, and the specimens they produce can be imported into several nations. Other nations restrict or prohibit possession of Asian arowanas; for example, the United States has listed this species under the Endangered Species Act, so it cannot be kept in that country without a permit.

Declining habitat is a major threat. For example, Asian arowanas are now uncommon in the Malay Peninsula, where they were once widely distributed, due to environmental destruction. Inclusion in the IUCN Red List was originally based not on biological reasons but on practical ones: though widely distributed throughout southeast Asia, they have been harvested heavily by aquarium collectors. However, habitat loss is likely a greater threat than aquarium collecting.

 Additionally, considering the current confusion as to number of species, as well as the wide distribution, conservation status should be reconsidered. All strains are probably endangered, but some (notably the super red and red-tailed golden) more critically than others. The Asian arowana&#x27;s high value as aquarium fish has impacted its conservation. Its popularity has soared since the late 1970s, and hobbyists may pay thousands of U.S. dollars for one of these animals. Certain color varieties are more endangered than others, since the red and gold varieties are both less common, and in higher demand in the aquarium trade.

Beginning in 1989, CITES began allowing Asian arowanas to be traded, provided certain criteria were met, most notably that they were bred in captivity on a fish farm for at least two generations. The first of these farms was in Indonesia. Later, the Singapore government&#x27;s Agri-food and Veterinary Authority (then called the Primary Production Department) and a local fish exporter collaborated in a captive breeding program. Asian arowanas legally certified by CITES for trade became available from this program in 1994.

Captive-bred arowanas that are legal for trade under CITES are documented in two ways. First, fish farms provide each buyer with a certificate of authenticity and a birth certificate. Second, each specimen receives an implanted microchip, called a passive integrated transponder, which identifies individual animals.
Genetic fingerprinting has been used to assess the genetic diversity of a captive population at a Singapore fish farm to improve the management of this species. DNA markers that distinguish among different strains and between sexes have been identified, allowing aquaculturists to identify these characteristics in immature animals.

According to author Emily Voigt, the arowana has been cause for kidnappings, canings and even murder. 
===Care in captivity===
Because they can grow up to long, Asian arowanas require large aquaria. They are territorial and may be kept with other &quot;Scleropages&quot; only in a very large aquarium, provided all fish are of similar size. Like other arowanas, they need a tight-fitting cover to prevent escape. The water should be well-filtered, soft, and slightly acidic, and maintained at a temperature of .

Asian arowanas are carnivorous and should be fed a high-quality diet of meaty food, such as shrimp and crickets. They are surface feeders and prefer to take food in the upper parts of the water column. Aquarists recommend live foods and meaty prepared foods. Examples of appropriate live foods include scorpions, centipedes, mealworms, crickets, shrimps, feeder fish, small frogs, and earthworms. Prepared foods include prawns (shrimp), lean pork, frozen fish food, and pelleted food. Some captive arowanas are fed Koi fry in an attempt to increase the vibrancy of their natural coloration.

There are over 150 CITES-registered Asian arowana farms in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and other Southeast Asia countries, producing Asian arowana for commercial purposes. But the actual number of Asian arowana farms in the world could be much higher than that, and probably over 350, of which most may not be registered in CITES yet. The total annual revenue of the Asian arowana sector was estimated at over US$200 million globally.

Possession of &quot;Scleropages formosus&quot; by private citizens is prohibited in Florida and New Mexico.

<text>Scleropages jardinii, the Gulf saratoga, Australian bonytongue, pearl arowana or northern saratoga, is a freshwater bony fish native to Australia and New Guinea, one of two species of fishes sometimes known as Australian arowana, the other being &quot;Scleropages leichardti&quot;. It has numerous other common names, including northern saratoga, toga and barramundi (not to be confused with the barramundi perch, &quot;Lates calcarifer&quot;). It is a member of the subfamily Osteoglossinae, a (basal) teleost group. Its scientific name is sometimes spelled &quot;S. jardini&quot;.

==Distribution==
&quot;Scleropages jardinii&quot; is patchily distributed throughout most of the Gulf of Carpentaria drainage system, west to the Adelaide River in the Northern Territory, throughout northern Queensland and in central-southern New Guinea. It inhabits still clear waters of pools and billabongs, and the slow-flowing sections of streams.

It is not considered endangered or threatened by either the CITES conventions nor the IUCN Red List.

==Description==
This fish has a long, dark-colored body with seven rows of large scales, each with several reddish or pinkish spots arranged in a crescent shape around the trailing edge of the scale, giving it a pearly appearance. It has large, wing-like pectoral fins. Except for duller coloration and smaller scale size, it appears very similar to the Asian arowana, &quot;S. formosus&quot;. It grows to a length of about . Its maximum weight is recorded as , but one report suggests it has been known to weigh as much as . The depth of the bodies of adults is approximately 25–28% of the Standard Length, making this a more robust fish than its Australian cousin &quot;S. leichardti&quot;.

Like other arowanas, it is a mouthbrooder, but unlike the Asian arowana, reports suggest the female rather than the male broods the young in her mouth.

Due to their resemblance to the Asian arowanas they are sometimes sold in the name of golden arowana in some of the Asian countries, like India. However, they can be easily distinguished from the Asian arowanas by identifying their red spotted fins &amp; 7–8 rows of scales on their body.

==Diet==
Gulf saratoga are opportunistic carnivores, feeding on aquatic and terrestrial insects, small fishes and crustaceans.

<doc id="378325" wikidata="Q531234" url="?curid=378325" title="Jim Dine">
<text>Jim Dine (born June 16, 1935) is an American artist. Dine&#x27;s work includes painting, drawing, printmaking (in many forms including lithographs, etchings, gravure, intaglio, woodcuts, letterpress, and linocuts), sculpture, and photography.

==Education==
Dine&#x27;s first formal training took the form of night courses at the Art Academy of Cincinnati, in which he enrolled in 1952 at the age of 16, while attending Walnut Hills High School. In 1954, while still attending evening courses, Dine was inspired by a copy of Paul J. Sachs&#x27; &quot;Modern Prints and Drawings&quot; (1954), particularly by the German Expressionist woodcuts it reproduced, including work by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner (1880–1938), Emil Nolde (1867–1956) and Max Beckmann (1884–1950)—&quot;I was shocked by them&quot; — and began creating woodcuts in the basement of his maternal grandparents, with whom he was then living.

After high school, Dine enrolled at the University of Cincinnati. Under printmaking teacher Donald Roberts (1923–2015) Dine experimented in lithography, etching, intaglio, dry paint and woodcuts. At Roberts&#x27; suggestion, Dine subsequently studied for six months with Ture Bengtz (1907–73) at the School of Fine Arts at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, before returning to Ohio University where he graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1957 (remaining for an additional year to make paintings and prints, with the permission of the faculty).

==Career==

In 1958 Dine moved to New York, where he taught at the Rhodes School. In the same year he founded the Judson Gallery at the Judson Church in Greenwich Village with Claes Oldenburg and Marcus Ratliff, eventually meeting Allan Kaprow and Bob Whitman: together they became pioneers of happenings and performances, including Dine&#x27;s &quot;The Smiling Workman&quot; of 1959. Dine&#x27;s first exhibition was at the Reuben Gallery, where he also staged the elaborate performance &quot;Car Crash&quot; (1960), which he describes as &quot;a cacophony of sounds and words spoken by a great white Venus with animal grunts and howls by me.&quot; Another important early work was &quot;The House&quot; (1960), an environment incorporating found objects and street debris, installed at the Judson Gallery.

Dine continued to include everyday items (including personal possessions) in his work, which linked him to Pop Art—an affinity strengthened by his inclusion in the influential 1962 exhibition &quot;New Painting of Common Objects&quot; at the Pasadena Art Museum, curated by Walter Hopps and later cited as the first institutional survey of American Pop Art, including works by Robert Dowd, Joe Goode, Phillip Hefferton, Roy Lichtenstein, Edward Ruscha, Wayne Thiebaud and Andy Warhol.
