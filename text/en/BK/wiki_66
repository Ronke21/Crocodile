<text>The General Motors streetcar conspiracy refers to the convictions of General Motors (GM) and related companies that were involved in the monopolizing of the sale of buses and supplies to National City Lines (NCL) and subsidiaries, as well as to the allegations that the defendants conspired to own or control transit systems, in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act. This suit created lingering suspicions that the defendants had in fact plotted to dismantle streetcar systems in many cities in the United States as an attempt to monopolize surface transportation.

Between 1938 and 1950, National City Lines and its subsidiaries, American City Lines and Pacific City Lines—with investment from GM, Firestone Tire, Standard Oil of California (through a subsidiary), Federal Engineering, Phillips Petroleum, and Mack Trucks—gained control of additional transit systems in about 25 cities. Systems included St. Louis, Baltimore, Los Angeles, and Oakland. NCL often converted streetcars to bus operations in that period, although electric traction was preserved or expanded in some locations. Other systems, such as San Diego&#x27;s, were converted by outgrowths of the City Lines. Most of the companies involved were convicted in 1949 of conspiracy to monopolize interstate commerce in the sale of buses, fuel, and supplies to NCL subsidiaries, but were acquitted of conspiring to monopolize the transit industry.

The story as an urban legend has been written about by Martha Bianco, Scott Bottles, Sy Adler, Jonathan Richmond, Cliff Slater, and Robert Post. It has been depicted several times in print, film, and other media, notably in the fictional film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, documentary films such as &quot;Taken for a Ride&quot; and &quot;The End of Suburbia&quot; and the book &quot;Internal Combustion&quot;.

Only a handful of U.S. cities, including San Francisco, New Orleans, Newark, Cleveland, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Boston, have surviving legacy rail urban transport systems based on streetcars, although their systems are significantly smaller than they once were. Other cities, such as Washington DC, and Norfolk, have re-introduced streetcars.

==History==
===Background===
In the latter half of the 19th century, transit systems were generally rail, first horse-drawn streetcars, and later electric powered streetcars and cable cars. Rail was more comfortable and had less rolling resistance than street traffic on granite block or macadam and horse-drawn streetcars were generally a step up from the horsebus. Electric traction was faster, more sanitary, and cheaper to run; with the cost, excreta, epizootic risk, and carcass disposal of horses eliminated entirely. Streetcars were later seen as obstructions to traffic, but for nearly 20 years they had the highest power-to-weight ratio of anything commonly found on the road, and the lowest rolling resistance.

Streetcars paid ordinary business and property taxes, but also generally paid franchise fees, maintained at least the shared right-of-way, and provided street sweeping and snow clearance. They were also required to maintain minimal service levels. Many franchise fees were fixed or based on gross (v. net); such arrangements, when combined with fixed fares, created gradual impossible financial pressures. Early electric cars generally had a two-man crew, a holdover from horsecar days, which created financial problems in later years as salaries outpaced revenues.

Many electric lines—especially in the West—were tied into other real estate or transportation enterprises. The Pacific Electric and the Los Angeles Railway were especially so, in essence loss leaders for property development and long haul shipping.

By 1918, half of US streetcar mileage was in bankruptcy.

===Early years===
John D. Hertz, better remembered for his car rental business, was also an early motorbus manufacturer and operator. In 1917 he founded the Chicago Motor Coach Company, which operated buses in Chicago, and in 1923, he founded the Yellow Coach Manufacturing Company, a manufacturer of buses. He then formed The Omnibus Corporation in 1926 with &quot;plans embracing the extension of motor coach operation to urban and rural communities in every part of the United States&quot; that then purchased the Fifth Avenue Coach Company in New York. The same year, the Fifth Avenue Coach Company acquired a majority of the stock in the struggling New York Railways Corporation (which had been bankrupted and reorganized at least twice). In 1926, General Motors acquired a controlling share of the Yellow Coach Manufacturing Company and appointed Hertz as a main board director. Hertz&#x27;s bus lines, however, were not in direct competition with any streetcars, and his core business was the higher-priced &quot;motor coach&quot;.

By 1930, most streetcar systems were aging and losing money. Service to the public was suffering; the Great Depression compounded this. Yellow Coach tried to persuade transit companies to replace streetcars with buses, but could not persuade the power companies that owned the streetcar operations to motorize. GM decided to form a new subsidiary—United Cities Motor Transport (UCMT)—to finance the conversion of streetcar systems to buses in small cities. The new subsidiary made investments in small transit systems in Kalamazoo and Saginaw, Michigan, and in Springfield, Ohio, where they were successful in conversion to buses. UCMT then approached the Portland, Oregon, system with a similar proposal. The UCMT was censured by the American Transit Association and dissolved in 1935.

The New York Railways Corporation began conversion to buses in 1935, with the new bus services being operated by the New York City Omnibus Corporation, which shared management with The Omnibus Corporation. During this period, GM worked with Public Service Transportation in New Jersey to develop the &quot;All-Service Vehicle&quot;, a bus also capable of working as a trackless trolley, allowing off-wire passenger collection in areas too lightly populated to pay for wire infrastructure.

Opposition to traction interests and their influence on politicians was growing. For example, in 1922, New York Supreme Court Justice John Ford came out in favor of William Randolph Hearst, a newspaper magnate, for mayor of New York, complaining that Al Smith was too close to the &quot;traction interests&quot;. In 1925, Hearst complained about Smith in a similar way. In the 1941 film &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, the lead character, who was loosely based on Hearst and Samuel Insull, complains about the influence of the &#x27;&quot;traction interests&quot;.

The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, which made it illegal for a single private business to both provide public transport and supply electricity to other parties, forced electricity generator companies to divest from trolley, streetcar, electric suburban, and interurban transit operators that they used to cross-subsidize in order to increase the basis of their limited return on investment.

===National City Lines, Pacific City Lines, American City Lines===
In 1936, National City Lines (NCL), which had been started in 1920 as a minor bus operation by E. Roy Fitzgerald and his brother, was reorganized &quot;for the purpose of taking over the controlling interest in certain operating companies engaged in city bus transportation and overland bus transportation&quot; with loans from the suppliers and manufacturers. In 1939, Roy Fitzgerald, president of NCL, approached Yellow Coach Manufacturing, requesting additional financing for expansion. In the 1940s, NCL raised funds for expansion from Firestone Tire, Federal Engineering, a subsidiary of Standard Oil of California (now Chevron Corporation), Phillips Petroleum (now part of ConocoPhillips), GM, and Mack Trucks (now a subsidiary of Volvo). Pacific City Lines (PCL), formed as a subsidiary of NCL in 1938, was to purchase streetcar systems in the western United States. PCL merged with NCL in 1948. American City Lines (ACL), which had been organized to acquire local transportation systems in the larger metropolitan areas in various parts of the country in 1943, was merged with NCL in 1946. The federal government investigated some aspects of NCL&#x27;s financial arrangements in 1941 (which calls into question the conspiracy myths&#x27; centrality of Quinby&#x27;s 1946 letter). By 1947, NCL owned or controlled 46 systems in 45 cities in 16 states.

From 1939 through 1940, NCL or PCL attempted a hostile takeover of the Key System, which operated electric trains and streetcars in Oakland, California. The attempt was temporarily blocked by a syndicate of Key System insiders, with controlling interest secured on January 8, 1941. By 1946, PCL had acquired 64% of the stock in the Key System.

Beginning in the 1940s, NCL and PCL slowly took control of Los Angeles&#x27; two streetcar systems: Pacific Electric Railway (known as the &quot;Red Cars&quot;) and Los Angeles Railway (known as the &quot;Yellow Cars&quot;). In 1940, PCL acquired Pacific Electric&#x27;s operations in Glendale, Burbank, and Pasadena. Lines to San Bernardino were phased out in 1941 and the Hollywood Subway, which ran lines from Burbank, Glendale, and the San Fernando Valley, closed in 1955. In 1945, ACL acquired Los Angeles Railway at a price of about $13,000,000. Soon after, the company announced it would scrap all but three of the existing Yellow Car lines.

In 1953, the remainder of Pacific Electric&#x27;s network was sold to Metropolitan City Lines, a subsidiary of PCL. Subsequently, the remaining assets of the original Pacific Electric system and the original Los Angeles Railway system were sold by Metropolitan City Lines and Los Angeles Transit Lines, respectively, to the newly formed Los Angeles Metropolitan Transit Authority. Under the new public authority, the final remaining streetcars in Los Angeles were phased out, with the final Red Car (Los Angeles to Long Beach Line) making its last service on April 9, 1961 and the last Yellow Car (V Line) on March 31, 1963.

===Edwin J. Quinby===
In 1946, Edwin Jenyss Quinby, an activated reserve commander, founder of the Electric Railroaders&#x27; Association in 1934 (which lobbied on behalf of rail users and services), and former employee of North Jersey Rapid Transit (which operated into New York State), published a 24-page &quot;expose&quot; on the ownership of National City Lines addressed to &quot;The Mayors; The City Manager; The City Transit Engineer; The members of The Committee on Mass-Transportation and The Tax-Payers and The Riding Citizens of Your Community&quot;. It began, &quot;This is an urgent warning to each and every one of you that there is a careful, deliberately planned campaign to swindle you out of your most important and valuable public utilities–your Electric Railway System&quot;. His activism may have led Federal authorities to prosecute GM and the other companies.

He also questioned who was behind the creation of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, which had caused such difficulty for streetcar operations, He was later to write a history of North Jersey Rapid Transit.

===Court cases, conviction, and fines===
On April 9, 1947, nine corporations and seven individuals (officers and directors of certain of the corporate defendants) were indicted in the Federal District Court of Southern California on counts of &quot;conspiring to acquire control of a number of transit companies, forming a transportation monopoly&quot; and &quot;conspiring to monopolize sales of buses and supplies to companies owned by National City Lines&quot; In 1948, the venue was changed from the Federal District Court of Southern California to the Federal District Court in Northern Illinois following an appeal to the United States Supreme Court (in &quot;United States v. National City Lines Inc.&quot;) which felt that there was evidence of conspiracy to monopolize the supply of buses and supplies.

In 1949, Firestone Tire, Standard Oil of California, Phillips Petroleum, GM, and Mack Trucks were convicted of conspiring to monopolize the sale of buses and related products to local transit companies controlled by NCL; they were acquitted of conspiring to monopolize the ownership of these companies. The verdicts were upheld on appeal in 1951. GM was fined and GM treasurer H.C. Grossman was fined $1. The trial judge said &quot;I am very frank to admit to counsel that after a very exhaustive review of the entire transcript in this case, and of the exhibits that were offered and received in evidence, that I might not have come to the same conclusion as the jury came to were I trying this case without a jury,&quot; explicitly noting that he might not himself have convicted in a bench trial.

In 1948, the San Diego Electric Railway was sold to Western Transit Company, owned by J. L. Haugh, for $5.5 million. Haugh was also president of the Key System, and later was involved in Metropolitan Coach Line&#x27;s purchase of the passenger operations of the Pacific Electric Railway. The last San Diego streetcars were converted to buses by 1949. Haugh sold the bus-based San Diego system to the city in 1966.

The Baltimore Streetcar system operated by the Baltimore Transit Company was purchased by NCL in 1948 and started converting the system to buses. Overall Baltimore Transit ridership then plummeted by double digits in each of the following three years. The Pacific Electric Railway&#x27;s struggling passenger operations were purchased by Metropolitan Coach Lines in 1953 and were taken into public ownership in 1958 after which the last routes were converted to bus operation.

===Urban Mass Transportation Act and 1974 Antitrust hearings===
The Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964 (UMTA) created the Urban Mass Transit Administration with a remit to &quot;conserve and enhance values in existing urban areas&quot; noting that &quot;our national welfare therefore requires the provision of good urban transportation, with the properly balanced use of private vehicles and modern mass transport to help shape as well as serve urban growth&quot;. Funding for transit was increased with the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1970 and further extended by the National Mass Transportation Assistance Act (1974) which allowed funds to support transit operating costs as well as capital construction costs.

In 1970, Harvard Law student Robert Eldridge Hicks began working on the Ralph Nader Study Group Report on Land Use in California, alleging a wider conspiracy to dismantle U.S. streetcar systems, first published in &quot;Politics of Land: Ralph Nader&#x27;s Study Group Report on Land Use in California&quot;.

During 1973, Bradford Snell, an attorney with Pillsbury, Madison and Sutro and formerly, for a brief time, a scholar with the Brookings Institution, prepared a controversial and disputed paper titled &quot;American ground transport: a proposal for restructuring the automobile, truck, bus, and rail industries.&quot; The paper, which was funded by the Stern Fund, was later described as the centerpiece of the hearings. In it, Snell said that General Motors was &quot;a sovereign economic state&quot; and said that the company played a major role in the displacement of rail and bus transportation by buses and trucks.

This paper was distributed in Senate binding together with an accompanying statement in February 1974, implying that the contents were the considered views of the Senate. The chair of the committee later apologized for this error. Adding to the confusion, Snell had already joined the Senate Judiciary Committee&#x27;s Subcommittee on Antitrust and Monopoly as a staff member.

At the hearings in April 1974, San Francisco mayor and antitrust attorney Joseph Alioto testified that &quot;General Motors and the automobile industry generally exhibit a kind of &quot;monopoly evil&quot;&quot;, adding that GM &quot;has carried on a deliberate concerted action with the oil companies and tire companies...for the purpose of destroying a vital form of competition; namely, electric rapid transit&quot;. Los Angeles mayor Tom Bradley also testified, saying that GM, through its subsidiaries (namely PCL), &quot;scrapped the Pacific Electric and Los Angeles streetcar systems leaving the electric train system totally destroyed&quot;. Neither mayor, nor Snell himself, pointed out that the two cities were major parties to a lawsuit against GM which Snell himself had been &quot;instrumental in bringing&quot;; all had a direct or indirect financial interest. (The lawsuit was eventually dropped, the plaintiffs conceding they had no chance of winning.)

However, George Hilton, a professor of economics at UCLA and noted transit scholar rejected Snell&#x27;s view, stating, &quot;I would argue that these [Snell&#x27;s] interpretations are not correct, and, further, that they couldn&#x27;t possibly be correct, because major conversions in society of this character—from rail to free wheel urban transportation, and from steam to diesel railroad propulsion—are the sort of conversions which could come about only as a result of public preferences, technological change, the relative abundance of natural resources, and other impersonal phenomena or influence, rather than the machinations of a monopolist.&quot;

GM published a rebuttal the same year titled &quot;The Truth About American Ground Transport&quot;. The Senate subcommittee printed GM&#x27;s work in tandem with Snell&#x27;s as an appendix to the hearings transcript. GM explicitly did not address the specific allegations that were &quot;sub judice&quot;.

===Role in decline of the streetcars===
Quinby and Snell held that the destruction of streetcar systems was integral to a larger strategy to push the United States into automobile dependency. Most transit scholars disagree, suggesting that transit system changes were brought about by other factors; economic, social, and political factors such as unrealistic capitalization, fixed fares during inflation, changes in paving and automotive technology, the Great Depression, antitrust action, the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, labor unrest, market forces including declining industries&#x27; difficulty in attracting capital, rapidly increasing traffic congestion, the Good Roads Movement, urban sprawl, tax policies favoring private vehicle ownership, taxation of fixed infrastructure, consumerism, franchise repair costs for co-located property, wide diffusion of driving skills, automatic transmission buses, and general enthusiasm for the automobile.

The accuracy of significant elements of Snell&#x27;s 1974 testimony was challenged in an article published in &quot;Transportation Quarterly&quot; in 1997 by Cliff Slater. A significant rebuttal to Slater&#x27;s article was published about one year later in the 1998 &quot;Transportation Quarterly&quot; finding that, without GM and other companies&#x27; efforts, the streetcar would not &quot;have been driven to the verge of extinction by 1968&quot;.

Recent journalistic analysis question the idea that GM had a significant impact on the decline of streetcars, suggesting rather that they were setting themselves up to take advantage of the decline as it occurred. Guy Span suggested that Snell and others fell into simplistic conspiracy theory thinking, bordering on paranoid delusions stating,

In 2010, CBS&#x27;s Mark Henricks reported:

==Other factors==
Other factors have been cited as reasons for the general decline of streetcars and public transport in the United States. Robert Post notes that the ultimate reach of GM&#x27;s alleged conspiracy extended to only about 10% of American transit systems. Guy Span said that actions and inaction by government was one of many contributing factors in the elimination of electric traction. Cliff Slater suggested that the regulatory framework in the US actually protected the electric streetcars for longer than would have been the case if there was less regulation.

Some regulations and regulatory changes have been linked directly to the decline of the streetcars:
*Difficult labor relations and tight regulation of fares, routes, and schedules took their toll on city streetcar systems.
*The streetcars&#x27; contracts in many cities required them to keep the pavement on the roads surrounding the tracks in good shape. Such conditions, previously agreed to in exchange for the explicit right to operate as a monopoly in that city, became an expensive burden.
*The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 prohibited regulated electric utilities from operating unregulated businesses, which included most streetcar lines. The act also placed restrictions on services operating across state lines. Many holding companies operated both streetcars and electric utilities across several states; those that owned both types of businesses were forced to sell off one. Declining streetcar business was often somewhat less valuable than the growing consumer electric business, resulting in many streetcar systems being put up for sale. The independent lines, no longer associated with an electric utility holding company, had to purchase electricity at full price from their former parents, further shaving their already thin margins. The Great Depression then left many streetcar operators short of funds for maintenance and capital improvements.
*In New York City, and other North American cities, the presence of restrictive legal agreements such as the Dual Contracts, signed by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company and Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation of the New York City Subway, restricted the ability of private mass transit operators to increase fares at a time of high inflation, allowed the city to take over them, or to operate competing subsidized transit.

Different funding models have also been highlighted:
*Streetcar lines were built using funds from private investors and were required to pay numerous taxes and dividends. By contrast, new roads were constructed and maintained by the government from tax income.
* By 1916, street railroads nationwide were wearing out their equipment faster than they were replacing it. While operating expenses were generally recovered, money for long-term investment was generally diverted elsewhere.
*The U.S. government responded to the Great Depression with massive subsidies for road construction.
*Later construction of the Interstate Highway System was authorized by the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 which approved the expenditure of $25 billion of public money for the creation of a new 41,000 miles (66,000 km) interstate road network. Streetcar operators were occasionally required to pay for the reinstatement of their lines following the construction of the freeways.
*Federal fuel taxes, introduced in 1956, were paid into a new Highway Trust Fund which could only fund highway construction (until 1983 when some 10% was diverted into a new Mass Transit Account).

Other issues which made it harder to operate viable streetcar services include:
*Suburbanization and urban sprawl, exacerbated in the US by white flight, created low-density land use patterns which are not easily served by streetcars, or indeed by any public transport, to this day.
*Increased traffic congestion often reduced service speeds and thereby increased their operational costs and made the services less attractive to the remaining users.
*More recently it has been suggested that the provision of free parking facilities at destinations and in the center of cities loads all users with the cost of facilities enjoyed only by motorists, creating additional traffic congestion and significantly affects the viability of other transport modes.

==Counterarguments==

Some of the specific allegations which have been argued over the years include:
*According to Snell&#x27;s testimony, the New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad (NH) in New York and Connecticut was profitable until it was acquired and converted to diesel trains. The New Haven&#x27;s main line between New York City and New Haven, Connecticut, remained electrified, and continues as such under Metro-North Railroad and Amtrak. In reality, the line was in financial difficulty for years and filed for bankruptcy in 1935. 
*&quot;GM killed the New York street cars&quot;: In reality, the New York Railways Company entered receivership in 1919, six years before it was bought by the New York Railways Corporation.
*&quot;GM Killed the Red cars in Los Angeles&quot;: Pacific Electric Railway (which operated the &quot;red cars&quot;) was hemorrhaging routes as traffic congestion worsened with growing car ownership levels after the end of World War II.&lt;ref name=&quot;Curb 2017/9/20&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Salt Lake City system is mentioned in the 1949 court papers. However, the city&#x27;s system was purchased by National City Lines in 1944 when all but one route had already been withdrawn, and the withdrawal of this last line had been approved three years earlier.

<text>Charles William Ingram (born 6 August 1963) is an English fraudster and a former Major in the British Army who gained fame for his appearance on the ITV television game show &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; In episodes recorded in September 2001, Ingram correctly answered fifteen questions to win the show&#x27;s maximum prize of £1 million, becoming the third recorded contestant ever to do so. However, he was denied the winnings due to suspicion of cheating.

Following a lengthy trial at Southwark Crown Court, Ingram was convicted on a single count of procuring the execution of a valuable security by deception. He was subsequently convicted of an unrelated offence involving insurance fraud in 2003 and ordered to resign his commission as a major by the Army Board.

==Early life==
Charles William Ingram was born on 6 August 1963 in Shardlow, Derbyshire, the son of John Ingram, a retired Royal Air Force Wing Commander, and his wife, Susan, a theatre set designer. His father&#x27;s Wellington bomber, operating with 103 Squadron from RAF Elsham Wolds, had been shot down in late September 1941; he was taken as a prisoner of war while two of his crew were killed.

Ingram&#x27;s parents divorced when he was young and he spent most of his education years boarding privately at Oswestry School in Oswestry, Shropshire. There he was a member of the Combined Cadet Force and completed the Duke of Edinburgh Silver Award. He went on to obtain a BSc in civil engineering from Kingston University.

==Military career==
In 1987, Ingram trained for the British Army at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst and was commissioned as an officer in the Royal Engineers. He was promoted to the rank of captain in 1990 and major in 1995. In 1999, Ingram was sent to Banja Luka in Bosnia for six months on United Nations peacekeeping duties. He graduated from Cranfield University with a master&#x27;s degree in corporate management in August 2000. He was ordered by the Army Board via letter to resign his commission on 20 August 2003 and to give up his rank of major. It is widely disputed whether or not he was dishonourably discharged.

==&quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; scandal==

On 9 September 2001 Ingram became a contestant on the ITV game show &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot;, following his wife, Diana, and her brother Adrian Pollock, each of whom had won £32,000 as a previous contestant. To prepare, Ingram practised for about twenty minutes per day on a homemade &quot;Fastest Finger First&quot; machine. Ingram got into the &quot;hot seat&quot;, but used two of his three lifelines early, ending the day at £4,000 and with only the 50/50 lifeline remaining. The production team did not expect him to proceed much further, but he ended up making it all the way to the £1 million prize on the second day of recording. 

Throughout Ingram&#x27;s run on the second day of recording, the production team were increasingly suspicious of him. He was taking brazen risks and playing the game in an unusual manner. One of the questions Ingram got during the run was &quot;Who had a hit UK album with &quot;Born to Do It&quot; released in 2000?&quot; After using his 50/50 the two remaining answers were A1 (what he believed the answer to be) and Craig David, whom he said he had never heard of. After nearly locking in A1 as his final answer, he backed down and later said &quot;80% of the time I&#x27;m wrong when I guess, so you know what—I&#x27;ll go Craig David.&quot; He then locked in the correct answer of Craig David. At the penultimate question, worth £500,000, Ingram was asked: &quot;Baron Haussmann is best known for his planning of which city?&quot; Amongst the options were Berlin and Paris, the former of which he immediately assumed as the right answer due to his belief that Haussmann is a German name. However, after some time he said, &quot;there&#x27;s a possibility that it&#x27;s Paris&quot; before eventually deciding to lock in Paris as his final answer. This got Ingram to the £1 million question—&quot;A number one followed by one hundred zeros is known by what name?&quot;—to which he thought the answer was nanomole and initially said he did not know what a googol is. However, he eventually decided to lock in &quot;googol&quot; as his final answer which won him the £1 million prize. Of Ingram&#x27;s unusual behaviour while playing for the final question, and after the scandal had become public knowledge, Rod Taylor, an executive producer, said, &quot;It became obvious that he wasn&#x27;t under the pressure that he should have been, somehow... He should have been very, very careful, and very certain. And he certainly wasn&#x27;t [either of those].&quot;

After Ingram had won the £1 million, producers were suspicious enough that a search was performed on him. His hair, clothing, and shoes were searched; however, the method of cheating used meant that nothing incriminating was found on his person. After he left the set, the show&#x27;s production company, Celador, were tipped off by the show&#x27;s producers of the assumed irregularities within the episode, and they suspended the jackpot payout to investigate the matter. At the same time, the show&#x27;s presenter, Chris Tarrant, overheard that the Ingrams had been arguing, despite Charles’s success, moments before Tarrant joined them in their dressing room for champagne; another member of the production team also noted a similar thought about the couple&#x27;s behaviour. While reviewing the recording, the production team made a connection between Ingram&#x27;s answers and coughs coming from one of the waiting contestants, Tecwen Whittock; for one question, the coughing came from Ingram&#x27;s wife Diana whilst she was in the audience. Based on this evidence, all three were accused of cheating, and the matter was handed over to the police to investigate further. Whittock and the Ingrams were eventually charged with &quot;procuring the execution of a valuable security by deception&quot;. 

=== Trial ===
Following a trial at Southwark Crown Court lasting four weeks (including jury deliberation for three and a half days), Ingram, his wife and Whittock were convicted by a majority verdict of their offences on 7 April 2003. Both of the Ingrams and Whittock were given prison sentences, suspended for two years—the Ingrams were sentenced to eighteen months; Whittock was sentenced to twelve months—and each fined £15,000 and ordered to pay £10,000 towards prosecution costs. Within two months of the verdict and sentence, the trial&#x27;s judge ordered the Ingrams to pay additional defence costs, which left them repaying a total of £115,000.

On 19 August 2003, the Army Board ordered Ingram to resign his commission as a major after sixteen years of service, but stated that this would not affect his pension entitlements.

On 19 May 2004, the Court of Appeal denied Ingram leave to appeal against his conviction and upheld his sentence but agreed to quash his wife&#x27;s fine and prosecution costs. On 5 October, the House of Lords denied Ingram leave to appeal against his fine and prosecution costs, and he appealed to the European Court of Human Rights. On 20 October, the original trial judge reduced Ingram&#x27;s defence costs order to £25,000 and Diana&#x27;s defence costs order to £5,000. Ingram&#x27;s defence costs were later further reduced to £5,000 on appeal.

In 2006, journalist Jon Ronson, who covered the case at the time for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, wrote that he believed the Ingrams might be innocent. Ronson, who attended every day of the trial, had observed that when the word &quot;cough&quot; was mentioned, pensioners in the public gallery had coughed. Chess grandmaster James Plaskett, who had appeared in the Fastest Finger First round several times before winning £250,000 in January 2006, argued this was an example of coughs caused by unconscious triggers; Whittock or others had simply coughed involuntarily upon hearing the correct answer. Whittock was also accused of having coughed after Ingram mentioned an incorrect option to his penultimate question and swiftly following that up with a smothered &quot;no&quot;. However, Plaskett, who had sat in that very same seat, argued that someone might have audibly said it in response to an incorrect option in the same way that other waiting contestants have been known to whisper &quot;no&quot;.

====Recorded evidence====
In court, Ingram claimed the videotape of his appearance on &quot;Millionaire&quot; was &quot;unrepresentative of what I heard&quot;, and he continues to assert that it was &quot;unfairly manipulated&quot;. A video recording, with coughing amplified relative to other sounds, including Ingram&#x27;s and Tarrant&#x27;s voices, was prepared by Celador&#x27;s editors (Editworks) for the prosecution and &quot;for the benefit of the jury&quot; during the trial (and later for viewers in television broadcasts). Ingram claims that he neither &quot;listened for, encouraged, nor noticed any coughing&quot;. The prosecution alleged that, of the 192 coughs recorded during his second-night performance, 32 were recorded from the ten Fastest Finger First contestants, and that 19 of the 32 coughs heard on the video tape were &quot;significant&quot;. The prosecution asserted that these &quot;significant&quot; coughs were by Whittock when the correct answer had been spoken. During the trial, Tarrant also denied hearing any coughing throughout the episode, claiming he was too busy to notice.

====Testimony of Larry Whitehurst====
Larry Whitehurst, another contestant who had appeared on the show as a Fastest Finger First contestant on four occasions, was adamant that he had known the answers to Ingram&#x27;s questions. He told the court that he had been able to detect a pattern of coughing, and that he was entirely convinced that coughing had helped Ingram.

====Testimony of Tecwen Whittock====
Whittock claims to have suffered a persistent cough for his entire life, insisted that he had a genuine cough caused by a combination of hay fever and a dust allergy, and that it was only coincidence that his throat problem coincided with the right answers. During the trial, however, the jury heard evidence that once Whittock himself earned the right to sit in the hot seat, his throat problems disappeared. Whittock later testified that he drank several glasses of water before he went in front of the cameras. Whittock also insisted that he had not known the answers to three of the questions he allegedly helped with. However, the police found the answer to the twelfth question, regarding the artist who painted &quot;The Ambassadors&quot;, in a hand-written general knowledge book at Whittock&#x27;s home.

Davies, the floor manager on &quot;Millionaire&quot;, said that as soon as the coughing came to his notice during the recording he decided to find out who was responsible. &quot;The loudest coughing was coming from Tecwen in seat number three&quot;, he said. &quot;He was talking to the person to his left when I was observing him, and then he turned towards the set and the hot seat to and while Davies described this as &quot;bizarre&quot;, Whittock remarked during the trial, &quot;You do not cough into someone&#x27;s face&quot;.

During the trial, Whittock portrayed himself as a &quot;serial quiz show loser&quot; because he had been eliminated in round one of Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Fifteen to One&quot;, had also failed on ITV&#x27;s &quot;The People Versus&quot; and had been able to win only an atlas on his appearance on ITV&#x27;s &quot;Sale of the Century&quot;. He had also done poorly on &quot;Beat the Bong&quot;, although he did reach the semi-final stage of the BBC radio quiz show &quot;Brain of Britain&quot;.

==After &quot;Millionaire&quot;==
===Books===
Since leaving the Army, Ingram has written two novels: &quot;The Network&quot; (2006) and &quot;Deep Siege&quot; (2007).

Following his appearance on &quot;Millionaire&quot;, Ingram has appeared on various other television shows, including Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;The Games&quot;, the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Weakest Link&quot;, and Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Wife Swap&quot;, featuring alongside his wife in the latter two.

On &quot;The Weakest Link&quot;, Anne Robinson jokingly referred to the &quot;dashing young major with a throat infection&quot;, regarding his &quot;Millionaire&quot; appearance. A question was also posed concerning, &quot;In classical music what &#x27;C&#x27; is the act of throat clearing which members of the audience are asked to try to avoid?&quot;, the answer being &quot;coughing&quot;.

Ingram also narrowly lost to Paul Daniels on the short-lived Channel 5 game show &quot;19 Keys&quot; in November 2003.

===Insurance fraud case===
In late 2003, Ingram and his wife were charged with further fraud offences. On 28 October, Ingram was found guilty at Bournemouth Crown Court of obtaining a pecuniary advantage by deception, and of a second charge of deception, having attempted to claim on an insurance policy after an alleged burglary at his home. Ingram had failed to tell Direct Line Insurance about claims he had made in the three years before he took out the policy in July 2001. However a spokesman for Wiltshire Constabulary, David Taylor, said those offences were &quot;not fraud&quot;. The court was told that Ingram had been a &quot;habitual claimant&quot; with Norwich Union after suffering &quot;unfortunate&quot; losses of private possessions.

Christopher Parker, prosecuting, said Ingram switched insurers to Zurich Insurance Group in 1997, after Norwich Union reduced a burglary claim from £19,000 to £9,000, and in 2000 switched again to Direct Line. &quot;He has been dishonest,&quot; Parker said. &quot;He went to Direct Line and didn&#x27;t make a disclosure about his claims history, because he knew he wouldn&#x27;t have been insured. It might not have started off as the most monstrous piece of villainy but these things tend to snowball and it all came to a sticky end when he claimed for £30,000.&quot; Staff at Direct Line were already &quot;suspicious&quot; about Ingram&#x27;s £30,000 burglary claim but decided to investigate only after reading newspaper coverage about his questionable win on &quot;Millionaire&quot;.

Ingram was given a conditional discharge on the charge of fraudulently claiming £30,000 on insurance. The judge told Ingram he took into account &quot;the punishment [Ingram had] brought upon [himself] and [his] dire financial state&quot; and rejected an alternative option of community service after Ingram told a probation officer he feared other criminals would bully him.

==In popular culture==
A book covering the case, &quot;Bad Show: The Quiz, The Cough, The Millionaire Major&quot;, by Bob Woffinden and James Plaskett, was published in January 2015.

&quot;Quiz&quot;, a play written by James Graham that re-examines the events and subsequent conviction of the Ingrams and Whittock, opened at the Minerva Theatre, Chichester, on 3 November 2017, running until 9 December 2017. The play transferred to the West End, playing at the Noël Coward Theatre from 31 March 2018 to 16 June 2018. In 2019, Graham adapted his play into a serial drama for ITV that was broadcast in April 2020 in three parts. Ingram was portrayed in the series by Matthew Macfadyen. The series also aired on AMC and BBC America in the United States in June 2020 and on RTÉ One in Ireland in February 2021.

==Personal life==
Ingram met his wife, Diana, while she was training to be a teacher at Barry College in Wales. The two became engaged during his first posting with the Royal Engineers in Germany. They were married in November 1989 and have three children.

In 2010, Ingram lost three toes on his left foot in an accident involving a lawnmower.

<doc id="386115" wikidata="Q1075912" url="?curid=386115" title="Millionaire">
<text>A millionaire is an individual whose net worth or wealth is equal to or exceeds one million units of currency. Depending on the currency, a certain level of prestige is associated with being a millionaire.
Many national currencies have, or have had at various times, a low unit value, in many cases due to past inflation. It is much easier and less significant to be a millionaire in those currencies, thus a millionaire in the local currency of Hong Kong or Taiwan, for example, may be merely of average wealth, or perhaps less wealthy than average. A millionaire in Zimbabwe in 2007 could have been extremely poor. Because of this, the term &#x27;millionaire&#x27; generally refers to those whose assets total at least one million units of a high-value currency, such as the United States dollar, euro, or pound sterling.

At the end of 2011, there were around 5.1 million HNWIs in the United States, while at the same time there were 11 million millionaires in a total of 3.5 million millionaire households, including those 5.1 million HNWIs. , there were estimated to be just over 16 million dollar-millionaires in the world according to the World&#x27;s Wealthiest Cities Report 2024 by Henley &amp; Partners. The United States had the highest number of millionaires (5.5 million) of any country, whilst New York is the wealthiest city with 349,500 millionaires. In countries that use the short scale number naming system, a billionaire is someone who has at least a thousand times a million dollars, euros or pounds.

==Terminology==
The word &quot;millionaire&quot; was apparently coined in French in 1719 to describe speculators in the Mississippi Bubble who earned millions of livres in weeks before the bubble burst. The standard French spelling is now , though the earliest reference uses a single &quot;n&quot;. The word was first used (as millionnaire, double &quot;n&quot;) in French in 1719 by Steven Fentiman, and is first recorded in English (millionaire, as a French term) in a letter of Lord Byron of 1816, then in print in Vivian Grey, a novel of 1826 by Benjamin Disraeli. Earlier English writers also mention the French word, including Sir William Mildmay in 1764. The OED&#x27;s first print citation is Benjamin Disraeli&#x27;s 1826 novel &quot;Vivian Grey&quot;, The anglicisation &quot;millionary&quot; was used in 1786 by Thomas Jefferson while serving as Minister to France; he wrote: &quot;The poorest labourer stood on equal ground with the wealthiest Millionary&quot;.

==Influence==
While millionaires constitute only a small percentage of the population, they hold substantial control over economic resources, with the most powerful and prominent individuals usually ranking among them. The total amount of money held by millionaires can equal the amount of money held by a far higher number of poor people. The Gini coefficient, and other measures in economics, estimated for each country, are useful for determining how many of the poorest people have the equivalent total wealth of the few richest in the country. &quot;Forbes&quot; and &quot;Fortune&quot; magazines maintain lists of people based on their net worth and are generally considered authorities on the subject. &quot;Forbes&quot; listed 1,645 dollar billionaires in 2014, with an aggregate net worth of $6.4 trillion, an increase from $5.4 trillion the previous year (see US-dollar billionaires in the world). 

According to a report by Hurun, a market research firm based in China, the global billionaire population stood at 3,381 in 2022. Sixteen percent of millionaires inherited their fortunes. Forty-seven percent of millionaires are business owners. Twenty-three percent of the world&#x27;s millionaires got that way through paid work, consisting mostly of skilled professionals or managers. Millionaires are, on average, 61-years-old with $3.05 million in assets.

==Historical worth==
Depending on how it is calculated, a million US dollars in 1900 is equivalent to $ (in ):

* $24.8 million using the consumer price index,
* $61.4 million using the gold price

Thus one would need to have almost thirty million dollars today to have the purchasing power of a US millionaire in 1900, or more than 100 million dollars to have the same impact on the US economy.

==Multimillionaire==

Dated ways of describing someone worth &quot;n&quot; millions are &quot;&quot;n&quot;-fold millionaire&quot; and &quot;millionaire &quot;n&quot; times over&quot;. Still commonly used is &quot;multimillionaire&quot;, which refers to individuals with net assets of 2 million or more of a currency. There are approximately 584,000 US$ multimillionaires who have net assets of $10M+ worldwide in 2017. Roughly 1.5% of US$ millionaires are &quot;ultra-high-net-worth individuals&quot; (ultra-HNWIs), defined as those with a net worth or wealth of $30 million or more. There are approximately 226,000 ultra-HNWIs in the world in 2017, according to Wealth-X.
The rising prevalence of people possessing ever increasing quantities of wealth has given rise to additional terms to further differentiate millionaires. Individuals with net assets of 100 million or more of a currency are commonly termed &quot;centimillionaires,&quot; or more rarely &quot;hectomillionaires&quot;.

==HNWI population==
High-net-worth individuals (those with financial assets, not including the residence, greater than a million US dollars):
== Global cities with the most super-wealthy millionaires per capita (higher than $30 million) ==

According to wealth research group Wealth-X that released its latest UHNW Cities report, showing the residential footprint of the world&#x27;s top ultra-high net worth (UHNW) individual cities. Excluding Monaco – which has very high UHNWI density – Geneva has the highest density of super-wealthy people per capita in the world. The city is known as the most compact metropolitan area, and also enjoys a concentration of affluence. Singapore has the second-highest concentration, followed by San Jose, the center of Silicon Valley, and the largest city in Northern California.
While New York City leads in terms of overall UHNW footprint, London has a similar number of UHNW &quot;second homers&quot; despite a considerably smaller population. Paris features as the second-highest European city, after London, Wealth-X said.
Among suburbs and smaller towns, Beverly Hills has the highest overall number of UHNW residents, and Aspen has the highest concentration on a per capita basis, the report showed.
Ultra-high net worth individuals are defined by Wealth-X as those whose total net worth is higher than $30 million (R400 million).

==Number of UHNWIs per country==
The following is a list of the countries with the most Ultra high-net-worth individuals (UHNWI) as of 2023 as per the 2024 Knight Frank&#x27;s Wealth Report:
== Countries by number and percentage of millionaires ==

== Number of millionaires by city ==
, New York is the wealthiest city in the world with 350,000 HNWIs according to the World&#x27;s Wealthiest Cities Report 2024 by Henley &amp; Partners. The amount of wealth held by people in New York City is nearly $3 trillion. Some places have a sharp, quantitative increase in seasonal wealthy residents including cities such as Paris and Miami, Rocky Mountains ski towns like Aspen, and various beachfront towns of the French Riviera like Cannes.

==Disparity in United States==

There is a wide disparity in the estimates of the number of millionaires residing in the United States. 
A quarterly report prepared by the Economist Intelligence Unit on behalf of Barclays Wealth in 2007 estimated that there were 16.6 million millionaires in the US. At the end of 2011, there were around 5.1 million HNWIs in the US, while at the same time, there were 11 million millionaires in a total of 3.5 million millionaire households, including those 5.1 million HNWIs.

According to TNS Financial Services, as reported by CNN Money, 2 million households in the US alone had a net worth of at least $1 million excluding primary residences in 2005. According to TNS, in mid-2006 the number of millionaire US households was 9.3 million, with an increase of half a million since 2005. The study found that half of all millionaire households in the US were headed by retirees. In 2004 the United States saw a &quot;33 percent increase over the 6.2 million households that met that criteria [sic] in 2003&quot;, fueled largely by the country&#x27;s real estate boom.

A report by Capgemini for Merrill Lynch on the other hand stated that in 2007 there were approximately 3,028,000 households in the United States who held at least US$1 million in financial assets, excluding collectibles, consumables, consumer durables and primary residences. According to TNS Financial Services, Los Angeles County, California, had the highest number of millionaires, totalling over 262,800 households in mid-2006.

<text>A Scotch egg is a boiled egg wrapped in sausage meat, coated in breadcrumbs and baked or deep-fried.

==Origin==

Various origin stories exist. The &quot;Oxford Companion to Food&quot; gives the first instance of the name as of 1809, in an edition of Maria Rundell&#x27;s &quot;A New System of Domestic Cookery.&quot; They did not, at that time, have a breadcrumb layer, although by 1861 Isabella Beeton suggested this as an option. According to the &quot;Oxford Companion to Food&quot;, food historian Annette Hope speculated in 1987 that the inspiration may have been Indian koftas such as the Mughlai dish called &quot;nargisi kofta&quot; (&quot;Narcissus meatballs&quot;), in which a boiled egg is encased in a seasoned ground-meat mixture and then fried.

Other claims include the item having been invented at Fortnum &amp; Mason at Piccadilly in 1738. According to &quot;Culinary Delights of Yorkshire&quot;, they originated in Whitby, Yorkshire, England, in the 19th century, and were originally covered in fish paste rather than sausage meat. They were supposedly named after William J. Scott &amp; Sons, a well-known eatery which sold them.

It has also been suggested that they were originally called &quot;scorch&quot; eggs, as they were cooked over an open flame, though according to surviving recipes they were deep-fried in lard. &#x27;Scotching&#x27; as a culinary process is also sometimes cited as the origin, though what &quot;scotching&quot; was is open to interpretation, from the inclusion of anchovies to simply mincing meat. Further confusion is added by the large trade in eggs from Scotland in the 19th century, which sometimes involved dipping eggs in a lime powder to preserve them, a process possibly also known as &quot;scotching&quot;.

==Preparation and serving==

Scotch eggs are prepared by hard- or soft-boiling an egg, wrapping it in sausage meat, and deep-frying it. It is often eaten in pubs or as a cold snack at picnics.
In the Netherlands and Belgium, Scotch eggs may also be called &quot;vogelnestje&quot; (&quot;little bird&#x27;s nest&quot;), because they contain an egg. One 1880s Scottish recipe also calls them birds&#x27; nests.

==Regional variation==

The Manchester egg consists of a pickled egg wrapped in a mixture of pork meat and Lancashire black pudding.

Vegetarian versions have also been made. In 2022, Guinness World Records certified a vegetarian Scotch egg as the world&#x27;s largest. It used an ostrich egg in the center, with a coating made of peas and cheddar cheese. The Harwood Arms, a Michelin-starred restaurant in London, started selling a vegetarian Scotch egg that uses a plant-based meat alternative in 2020, and the next year, the supermarket chain Tesco started selling a vegan version.

== Nutrition ==
A fatty food, a typical sausage-coated Scotch egg has about 200 mg dietary cholesterol per 100 grams.

<doc id="386120" wikidata="Q178921" url="?curid=386120" title="Mineral water">
<text>Mineral water is water from a mineral spring that contains various minerals, such as salts and sulfur compounds. It is usually still, but may be sparkling (carbonated/effervescent).

Traditionally, mineral waters were used or consumed at their spring sources, often referred to as &quot;taking the waters&quot; or &quot;taking the cure,&quot; at places such as spas, baths and wells. 

Today, it is far more common for mineral water to be bottled at the source for distributed consumption. Travelling to the mineral water site for direct access to the water is now uncommon, and in many cases not possible because of exclusive commercial ownership rights. More than 4,000 brands of mineral water are commercially available worldwide.

In many places the term &quot;mineral water&quot; is colloquially used to mean any bottled carbonated water or soda water, as opposed to tap water.

==Composition==
The more calcium and magnesium ions that are dissolved in water, the &quot;harder&quot; it is said to be; water with few dissolved calcium and magnesium ions is described as being &quot;soft&quot;.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration classifies mineral water as water containing at least 250 parts per million total dissolved solids (TDS), originating from a geologically and physically protected underground water source. No minerals may be added to this water.

In the European Union, bottled water may be called mineral water when it is bottled at the source and has undergone no or minimal treatment. Permitted is the removal of iron, manganese, sulfur and arsenic through decantation, filtration or treatment with ozone-enriched air, insofar as this treatment does not alter the composition of the water as regards to the essential constituents which give it its properties. No additions are permitted except for carbon dioxide, which may be added, removed or re-introduced by exclusively physical methods. No disinfection treatment is permitted, nor is the addition of any bacteriostatic agents.

== Health impact ==

A review by the World Health Organization found slightly reduced cardiovascular disease mortality from consuming harder water with higher mineral amounts, with magnesium and possibly calcium being the most likely contributors.

However, mineral amounts vary greatly among different brands of mineral water, and tap water can contain similar or greater amounts of minerals. One study found that the median mineral content of North American mineral waters was lower than for tap water, though values varied widely among both groups. Additionally, other dietary sources of minerals are available and may be more cost effective and less environmentally impactful than bottled mineral water.

<doc id="386123" wikidata="Q807820" url="?curid=386123" title="Barbershop music">
<text>Barbershop vocal harmony is a style of a cappella close harmony, or unaccompanied vocal music, characterized by consonant four-part chords for every melody note in a primarily homorhythmic texture. Each of the four parts has its own role: generally, the lead sings the melody, the tenor harmonizes above the melody, the bass sings the lowest harmonizing notes, and the baritone completes the chord, usually below the lead. The melody is not usually sung by the tenor or baritone, except for an infrequent note or two to avoid awkward voice leading, in tags or codas, or when some appropriate embellishment can be created. One characteristic feature of barbershop harmony is the use of what is known as &quot;snakes&quot; and &quot;swipes&quot;. This is when a chord is altered by a change in one or more non-melodic voices. Occasional passages may be sung by fewer than four voice parts.

Barbershop music is generally performed by either a [[barbershop quartet]], a group of four typically male singers with one on each vocal part, or a barbershop chorus, which closely resembles a choir with the notable exception of the genre of music.

According to the Barbershop Harmony Society (BHS), &quot;Barbershop music features songs with understandable lyrics and easily singable melodies, whose tones clearly define a tonal center and imply major and minor chords and barbershop (dominant and secondary dominant) seventh chords that resolve primarily around the circle of fifths, while making frequent use of other resolutions.&quot; Slower barbershop songs, especially ballads, often eschew a continuous beat, and notes are often held (or sped up) ad libitum.

Aside from the bass, the voice parts in barbershop singing do not correspond closely to their classical music counterparts; the tenor range and tessitura are similar to those of the classical countertenor (including the fact that they sing their highest notes primarily in falsetto, as a countertenor would), the baritone resembles a high lyric baritone in range and a tenor in tessitura, and the lead generally corresponds to the tenor of classical repertoire, with some singers possessing a tessitura more similar to that of a high baritone. Barbershop singing is performed both by men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s groups; the elements of the barbershop style and the names of the voice parts are the same for both.

==Characteristics==
===Ringing chords===
The defining characteristic of the barbershop style is the &quot;ringing&quot; chord, one in which certain overtones of the four voices reinforce each other, sometimes so strongly that the overtone is perceived by the listener as a distinct tone, even though none of the voices are perceived as singing that tone. This effect occurs when the chord, as voiced, contains intervals which have strongly reinforcing overtones (fifths and octaves, for example) that fall in the audible range; and when the chord is sung in perfect just tuning without excessive vibrato. Both of these characteristics are important in many styles of singing, but in Barbershop there is an extreme emphasis on them that tends to override other musical values. For example, favored chords in the jazz style are characterized by intervals which do not audibly ring, such as diminished or augmented fifths. For another example, Barbershop music is always a cappella, because the presence of fixed-pitch instruments (tuned to equal-temperament rather than just temperament), which is so highly prized in other choral styles, makes perfect just tuning of chords impossible.

The physics and psychophysics of the effect are fairly well understood; it occurs when the upper harmonics in the individual voice notes, and the sum and difference frequencies resulting from nonlinear combinations within the ear, reinforce each other at a particular frequency, strengthening it so that it stands out separately above the blended sound. The effect is audible only on certain kinds of chords, and only when all voices are equally rich in harmonics and justly tuned and balanced. It is not heard in chords sounded on modern keyboard instruments, due to the slight tuning imperfection of the equal-tempered scale.

Gage Averill writes that &quot;Barbershoppers have become partisans of this acoustic phenomenon&quot; and that &quot;the more experienced singers of the barbershop revival (at least after 1938) have self-consciously tuned their dominant seventh and tonic chords in just intonation to maximize the overlap of common overtones.&quot; However, &quot;In practice, it seems that most leads rely on an approximation of an equal-tempered scale for the melody, to which the other voices adjust vertically in just intonation.&quot;

What is prized is not so much the &quot;overtone&quot; itself, but a unique sound whose achievement is most easily recognized by the presence of the &quot;overtone&quot;. The precise synchrony of the waveforms of the four voices &quot;simultaneously&quot; creates the perception of a &quot;fifth voice&quot; while at the same time melding the four voices into a unified sound. The ringing chord is qualitatively different in sound from an ordinary musical chord e.g. as sounded on a tempered-scale keyboard instrument.

Most elements of the &quot;revivalist&quot; style are related to the desire to produce these ringing chords. Performance is a cappella to prevent the distracting introduction of equal-tempered intonation, and because listening to anything but the other three voices interferes with a performer&#x27;s ability to tune with the precision required. Barbershop arrangements stress chords and chord progressions that favor &quot;ringing&quot;, at the expense of suspended and diminished chords and other harmonic vocabulary of the ragtime and jazz forms.

The dominant seventh-type chord is so important to barbershop harmony that it is called the &quot;barbershop seventh&quot;. BHS arrangers believe that a song should contain dominant seventh chords anywhere from 35 to 60 percent of the time (measured as a percentage of the duration of the song rather than a percentage of the chords present) to sound &quot;barbershop&quot;.

Historically barbershoppers may have used the word &quot;minor chord&quot; in a way that is confusing to those with musical training. Averill suggests that it was &quot;a shorthand for chord types other than major triads&quot;, and says that the use of the word for &quot;dominant seventh-type chords and diminished chords&quot; was common in the late nineteenth century. A 1910 song called &quot;Play That Barber Shop Chord&quot; (often cited as an early example of &quot;barbershop&quot; in reference to music) contains the lines:

&#x27;Cause Mister when you start that minor part&lt;br&gt;I feel your fingers slipping and a grasping at my heart,&lt;br&gt;Oh Lord play that Barber shop chord!

Averill notes the hints of rapture, &quot;quasi-religion&quot; and erotic passion in the language used by barbershoppers to describe the emotional effect. He quotes Jim Ewin as reporting &quot;a tingling of the spine, the raising of the hairs on the back of the neck, the spontaneous arrival of goose flesh on the forearm ... the fifth note has almost mysterious propensities. It&#x27;s the consummation devoutly wished by those of us who love Barbershop harmony. If you ask us to explain why we love it so, we are hard put to answer; that&#x27;s where our faith takes over.&quot; Averill notes too the use of the language of addiction, &quot;there&#x27;s this great big chord that gets people hooked.&quot; An early manual was entitled &quot;A Handbook for Adeline Addicts&quot;.

He notes too that &quot;barbershoppers almost never speak of &#x27;singing&#x27; a chord, but almost always draw on a discourse of physical work and exertion; thus, they &#x27;hit&#x27;, &#x27;chop&#x27;, &#x27;ring&#x27;, &#x27;crack&#x27;, &#x27;swipe&#x27;, and &#x27;bust.&#x27; Vocal harmony is interpreted as an embodied musicking. Barbershoppers never lose sight (or sound) of its physicality.&quot;

==Historical origins==

English &quot;barber&#x27;s music&quot; was described in the 17th century by Samuel Pepys as amateur instrumental music. The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; considers the 19-century origins of the quartet style as &quot;obscure&quot;, possibly referring back to barber&#x27;s music, or dating to when barbershops served as community centers, where men would gather for social and musical activities with barbers traditionally being musicians. 

Historical memoirs and journalism indicate a strong tradition of quartet singing among young African American men, gathering informally to &quot;crack up a chord&quot;. This was acknowledged as early as 1882, when a &quot;New York Age&quot; writer traced the development of this singing as a home-grown amusement, arising from the exclusion of Black people from theaters and concert halls. Jazz musician Louis Armstrong told of having harmonized on New Orleans street corners as a boy, and NAACP executive secretary James Weldon Johnson &quot;grew up singing barbershop harmony&quot;.

Later, white minstrel singers adopted the style, and in the early days of the recording industry their performances were recorded and sold. Early standards included songs such as &quot;Shine On, Harvest Moon&quot;, &quot;Hello, Ma Baby&quot;, and &quot;Sweet Adeline&quot;. Johnson noted in the 1920s how the genre had already crossed racial barriers.

Barbershop music was very popular between 1900 and 1919, and some of the most popular quartets were the Haydn Quartet, the American Quartet, and the Peerless Quartet. Modern barbershop quartets often costume themselves in gaudy versions of the vaudeville dress of this time, with boaters and vertically striped vests. Composer and pianist Scott Joplin incorporated a barbershop quartet into his 1911 opera &quot;Treemonisha&quot;. The genre gradually faded into obscurity in the 1920s, although barbershop-style harmonies remained in evidence in a cappella forms of traditional black gospel and white gospel.

The modern era of barbershop music is accepted to have begun with a 1940s revival, though opinions as to the genre&#x27;s origins vary with respect to race, gender, region, and context.

Other researchers argue that today&#x27;s barbershop music is an invented tradition related to several musical features popular around 1900, including quartet singing and the use of the barbershop chord, but effectively created during the 1940s in the ranks of the Barbershop Harmony Society whilst creating a system of singing contests and its contest rules.

==Organizations==
Barbershop music is promoted through the use of competition for quartets and choruses run by not-for-profit organizations. Barbershop organizations often provide judging, education, coaching and promotion services for local choruses and quartets.

===United States===
In the United States, there are three major organizations which are intended to preserve the style of Barbershop music: The Barbershop Harmony Society, a historically men&#x27;s organization until 2018; Sweet Adelines International, a women&#x27;s organization; and Harmony, Incorporated which splintered off from Sweet Adelines in 1959. A minor organization began in 2014 called the &quot;Mixed Harmony Barbershop Association&quot; to promote mixed harmony barbershop quartets and choruses within the three major organizations and internationally. The Society for the Preservation and Propagation of BarberShop Quartet Singing in the U.S. (SPPBSQSUS) formed in 2018 as a fraternal organization to preserve and perpetuate the all-male barbershop quartet.

====Barbershop Harmony Society (BHS)====

The revival of a cappella singing took place circa 1938 when tax lawyer Owen C. Cash sought to save the art form from the threat of radio. He garnered support from investment banker Rupert I. Hall. Both came from Tulsa, Oklahoma. Cash was a partisan of quartet singing who advertised the fact that he did not want a cappella to fall by the wayside. Thousands of men responded. Later the &quot;Society for the Preservation and Encouragement of Barber Shop Quartet Singing in America&quot; was established, known by the abbreviation S.P.E.B.S.Q.S.A. at a time when many institutions in the US used multiple initials to denote their function. The group adopted the alternate name &quot;Barbershop Harmony Society&quot; early in its history. While its legal name has never changed, it changed its official brand name to &quot;Barbershop Harmony Society&quot; in 2004.

For the majority of its history, the society had all-male membership. It was all-white until 1963 when it allowed black members, and since 2018, it allows women to join as members.

====Sweet Adelines International (SAI)====
Sweet Adelines International, a worldwide organization of women singers, was established in 1945 by Edna Mae Anderson of Tulsa, Oklahoma. The aim was to teach and train its members in music and to create and promote barbershop quartets and other musical groups. By year&#x27;s end, the first chapter incorporated in Oklahoma with Anderson as its president. Sweet Adelines went international on March 23, 1953, when the first chapter outside the U.S. was chartered in Brandon, Manitoba, Canada. Even though there were international chapters, it was not until May 1991 that the name officially changed to Sweet Adelines International. It has a current membership of 23,000 and holds an annual international singing competition.

====Harmony, Incorporated (HI)====

In 1957, several members of Sweet Adelines International (SAI) broke from the organization in protest of the policy limiting membership to Caucasian women. In 1958, chapters from Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Orillia, Ontario, also left SAI to form Harmony, Incorporated. (Sweet Adelines changed their policy in 1966).

Harmony, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Rhode Island on February 26, 1959. The founding member chapters of Harmony, Inc. were the Melody Belles of Providence, Rhode Island; Sea Gals of New Bedford, Massachusetts; The Harmonettes from North Attleboro, Massachusetts; Harmony Belles of Barrie-Orillia, Ontario; and the Harborettes from Scituate, Massachusetts.

In 1963, a Sweet Adeline chapter in Ottawa, Ontario was threatened with expulsion after accepting a black woman, Lana Clowes, as a member. As a result, Ottawa&#x27;s Capital Chordettes left SAI to become the seventh chapter to join Harmony, Incorporated.

In 2013, Harmony, Inc. announced the creation of the Affiliate membership category, extending membership to men involved with the organization.

===International organizations===
After the establishment of the above organizations, other countries have begun their organizations to promote Barbershop music. These international organizations are often affiliated with one of the United States organizations listed above or by the World Harmony Council. Some are gender exclusive organizations while some are mixed. They include; British Association of Barbershop Singers, Barbershop Harmony Australia (BHA), Barbershop Harmony New Zealand (BHNZ), Barbershop in Germany (BinG), Finnish Association of Barbershop Singers (FABS), Holland Harmony (HH), Irish Association of Barbershop Singers (IABS), Ladies Association of Barbershop Singers (LABBS) in the United Kingdom, Spanish Association of Barbershop Singers (SABS) and Society of Nordic Barbershop Singers (SNOBS).

==Performance groups==

===Quartets===

A barbershop quartet is an ensemble of four people who sing a cappella in the exacting barbershop music genre.

In North America, the Barbershop Harmony Society hosts contests for all singers. Female barbershop quartet singers can also compete in Sweet Adelines International or Harmony, Inc., and the Society for the Preservation and Propagation of BarberShop Quartet Singing in the U.S. is available to male singers. Similar organizations exist in other continents and countries.

===Choruses===

A barbershop chorus sings a cappella music in the barbershop style. Most barbershop choruses belong to a larger association of practitioners such as the Barbershop Harmony Society, Sweet Adelines International, LABBS (Ladies Association of British Barbershop Singers), BABS (British Association of Barbershop Singers) or Harmony, Inc.

In the Barbershop Harmony Society, a chorus is the main performing aspect of each chapter. In competition, choruses may have as few as 12 members singing, with no upper limit. Choruses normally sing with a director, as distinct from quartets. It is not uncommon for a new quartet to form within a chorus, or for an established quartet affiliated with a given chorus to lose a member (to death, retirement, or relocation) and recruit a replacement from the ranks of the chorus. Choruses can also provide &quot;spare parts&quot; to temporarily replace a quartet member who is ill or temporarily out of town.

Unlike a quartet, a chorus need not have equal numbers singing each voice part. According to BHS, the ideal balance in a chorus is about 40% bass, 30% lead, 20% baritone and 10% tenor singers.

Filling the gap between the chorus and the quartet is what is known as a VLQ or Very Large Quartet, in which more than four singers perform together, with two or more voices on some or all of the four parts. A VLQ possesses greater flexibility than a standard quartet, since they can perform even with one or more singers missing, as long as all four parts are covered. Like a normal quartet, a VLQ usually performs without a director.

==Typical barbershop songs==
Barbershop Harmony Society&#x27;s Barberpole Cat Songs &quot;Polecats&quot;—12 songs which all Barbershop Harmony Society members are encouraged to learn as a shared canonic repertoire—all famous, traditional examples of the barbershop genre:

The Barbershop Harmony Society announced on May 28, 2015, that the &quot;Polecat&quot; program would be expanded to include the following songs:

Examples of other songs popular in the barbershop genre are:

While these traditional songs still play a part in barbershop today, barbershop music also includes more current titles. Most music can be arranged in the barbershop style, and there are many arrangers within the aforementioned societies with the skills to include the barbershop chord structure in their arrangements. Today&#x27;s barbershop quartets and choruses sing a variety of music from all eras—show tunes, pop, and even rock music has been arranged for choruses and quartets, making them more attractive to younger singers.

<text>Barbershop is a 2002 American comedy-drama film and the first installment in the &quot;Barbershop series&quot; directed by Tim Story and written by Mark Brown, Don D. Scott and Marshall Todd, from a story by Brown. It was produced by George Tillman Jr., Robert Teitel and Brown. The film stars Ice Cube, Anthony Anderson, Sean Patrick Thomas, Eve, Troy Garity, Michael Ealy, Leonard Earl Howze, Keith David and Cedric the Entertainer. Its plot revolves around the social life in a barbershop on the South Side of Chicago.

The film was released on September 13, 2002 by MGM Distribution Co. It received positive reviews from critics and grossed $77 million worldwide.

A sequel, &quot;Barbershop 2: Back in Business&quot; was released on February 6, 2004, with the original cast returning without director Story, and a third installment, &quot;&quot;, was released on April 15, 2016, and was directed by Malcolm D. Lee.

==Plot==
On a cold winter day in Chicago, Calvin Palmer Jr. (Ice Cube) decides he has had enough of trying to keep open the barbershop his father handed down to him. He cannot borrow, revenues are falling, and he seems more interested in get-rich-quick schemes to bring in easy money. Without telling his employees or the customers, he sells the barbershop to a greedy loan shark, Lester Wallace (Keith David), who secretly plans to turn it into a strip club.

After spending a day at work, and realizing just how vital the barbershop is to the surrounding community, Calvin rethinks his decision and tries to get the shop back - only to find out Wallace wants double the $20,000 he paid Calvin to return it, and before 7 pm that day. Right after he admits to the employees that he sold the barber shop, and that it would be closing at the end of the day, the police arrive to arrest one of the barbers, Ricky (Michael Ealy).

Ricky is accused of driving his pickup truck into a nearby market to steal an ATM, but it&#x27;s revealed that his cousin J.D. (Anthony Anderson) committed the crime after borrowing Ricky&#x27;s truck. As this would be Ricky&#x27;s &#x27;third strike&#x27;, he could be sentenced to life in prison. Calvin uses the $20,000 from Lester to bail Ricky out of jail, but because J.D. was going to let Ricky take the fall without remorse, Ricky is still angry.

Calvin reveals that he found a gun in Ricky&#x27;s locker in the barbershop and shows it to him. They stop the car and Ricky throws the gun into the Chicago River, proving that he does not want to get into any more trouble. Then they both go to confront Lester, as well as J.D. and Billy (Lahmard Tate), who took the ATM to Lester&#x27;s place without his knowledge, still trying to pry it open. Calvin and Ricky demand that Lester give the barbershop back.

Angered, Lester orders his bodyguard Monk (Kevin Morrow) to pull out his gun. The police arrive just in time to save Calvin and Ricky and arrest J.D. and Billy. Calvin and Ricky see the ATM, and get a $50,000 reward for returning it to police. They get the money, and the barbershop reopens with even better business than before. In the meantime, Calvin&#x27;s wife Jennifer (Jazsmin Lewis) has given birth to a baby boy.

==Cast==
==Production==

Produced on a $12 million budget, &quot;Barbershop&quot;, with a story by Mark Brown and a screenplay by Brown, Marshall Todd, and Don D. Scott, was filmed in Chicago during the winter of 2001 to early 2002. The filmmakers used a storefront in the South Chicago community area (79th Street and Exchange Avenue) that was once a laundromat to build the set for Calvin&#x27;s barbershop, and the set was duplicated on a soundstage. Similar to what he achieved with his 1997 film &quot;Soul Food&quot;, producer George Tillman Jr. wanted to portray African Americans in a more positive and three-dimensional light than many other Hollywood films had in the past. Producers Tillman and Robert Teitel picked Story to direct due to his preparedness. This film also features three original songs by R&amp;B singer/songwriter Sherod Lindsey.

Days after the release of the film, Rev. Al Sharpton and the Rev. Jesse Jackson expressed public umbrage over comments made in the film about Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr., with the former advocating for a boycott and the latter wishing for the dialogue to be excised from future editions. Neither of these requests would occur.

==Reception==

 Metacritic gives the film a weighted average score of 66 out of 100 based on 29 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

==Sequels, spin-off and television series==

In 2004, MGM released the sequel, &quot;Barbershop 2: Back in Business&quot;. All of the original cast returned, but director Tim Story did not. This film was directed by Kevin Rodney Sullivan. In the same year, Billie Woodruff directed a spin-off film entitled &quot;Beauty Shop&quot;, with Queen Latifah as the lead (Latifah&#x27;s character made her debut in &quot;Barbershop 2&quot;). &quot;Beauty Shop&quot; was pushed back from a late summer 2004 release, and finally reached theaters in March 2005.

During the fall of 2005, State Street and Ice Cube debuted &quot;&quot; on the Showtime cable network, with Omar Gooding taking over Ice Cube&#x27;s role of Calvin. The character &quot;Dinka&quot; is renamed &quot;Yinka&quot; on &quot;Barbershop: The Series&quot;, as &quot;Dinka&quot; is not a typical Nigerian name (although a certain tribe in the Nigerian middle belt bears the name &quot;Dimka&quot;). In addition, Isaac&#x27;s last name is changed from &quot;Rosenberg&quot; to &quot;Brice&quot;, and the character Ricky has been replaced by a more hardened ex-con, Romadal.

In 2014, a third &quot;Barbershop&quot; film was announced, titled &quot;&quot;. In late March of that year, MGM executives revealed that they have been negotiating deals with Ice Cube to appear in the film. A year later, MGM announced that the studio has been setting up deals with Cedric the Entertainer, Queen Latifah, Lisa Maffia, and Nicki Minaj to appear in the film. Malcolm D. Lee directed the film and New Line Cinema distributed it. The film was released on April 15, 2016.

==Soundtrack==

A soundtrack containing hip hop and R&amp;B music was released on August 27, 2002 by Epic Records. It peaked at #29 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and #9 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums.

<text>The Atlas pied flycatcher or Atlas flycatcher (Ficedula speculigera) is a bird in an Old World flycatcher family, one of the four species of Western Palearctic black-and-white flycatchers; it is endemic as a breeding species to North-west Africa.

It was formerly regarded as a race of European pied flycatcher, but Sætre &quot;et al.&quot; (2001) recommended that it is regarded as a species in its own right. The bird has large white patches on its wing and forehead. Identification is also covered in Etherington and Small (2003) and van den Berg &quot;et al.&quot; (2006).

* Imre Lakatos attempted to bridge the gap between Popper and Kuhn.
* Sociology of scientific knowledge
* Scientism

=== Relationship of scientific method to technology ===

* Science and technology studies
* Theories of technology

===Aesthetics in the scientific method ===
* Elegance
* Occam&#x27;s razor

<text>Christian August Sinding (11 January 18563 December 1941) was a Norwegian composer. He is best known for his lyrical work for piano &quot;Frühlingsrauschen&quot; (Rustle of Spring, 1896). He was often compared to Edvard Grieg and regarded as his successor.

==Personal life==
Sinding was born at Kongsberg in Buskerud, Norway. His parents were mine superintendent Matthias Wilhelm Sinding and Cecilie Marie Mejdell. He was a brother of the painter Otto Sinding and the sculptor Stephan Sinding. His sister Thora Cathrine Sinding was married to jurist Glør Thorvald Mejdell.

Christian Sinding was a nephew of Nicolai Mejdell and Thorvald Mejdell. He was also a first cousin of journalist and writer Alfred Sinding-Larsen.

In November 1898 he married actress Augusta Gade, née Smith-Petersen (1858–1936). She was the daughter of Morten Smith-Petersen and Cathrine von der Lippe. She had previously been married to physician and art patron Fredrik Georg Gade.

==Career==
He studied music first in Christiania (now Oslo) before going to Germany, where he studied at the conservatory in Leipzig under Salomon Jadassohn and fell under the musical influences of Wagner and Liszt. He lived in Germany for much of his life, but received regular grants from the Norwegian government. In 1921–22 he went to the United States of America to teach composition for a season at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York.

Sinding&#x27;s publishers required from him piano and chamber music, which had broader sales than the symphonic works he preferred. His own instrument was the violin. The large number of short, lyrical piano pieces and songs that Sinding wrote has led to many seeing him as the heir to his fellow countryman, Edvard Grieg, not so much in musical style but as a Norwegian composer with an international reputation. Sinding is best remembered today for one of his piano works, &quot;Frühlingsrauschen&quot; (&quot;Rustle of Spring&quot;, 1896). Among his other works are four symphonies, three violin concertos, a piano concerto, chamber music, songs and choral works to Norwegian texts, and an opera, &quot;Der Heilige Berg&quot; (&quot;The Holy Mountain&quot;, 1914).

==Awards==
Sinding was made a member of the Order of St. Olav in 1905 and Commander in 1916, and in 1938, received the Grand Cross.
He was appointed a Commander of the Order of Vasa and in 1905, he was made a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music.
In 1924 he was granted the honor of lifetime residence at Henrik Wergeland&#x27;s former home, Grotten in Oslo.

==Legacy==
Sinding had suffered from severe senile dementia since the late 1930s. Eight weeks before his death in 1941, Sinding joined the Norwegian Nazi party, Nasjonal Samling - however, his membership card was unsigned. The Nazis had strong motivation to recruit Sinding, as he was tremendously popular before the war in both Norway and Germany. Following the liberation of Norway at the end of World War II, it was official practice for the national broadcasting system to boycott people seen as Nazi sympathisers. As a consequence, Sinding&#x27;s post-war reputation in Norway became relatively obscure. The circumstances surrounding the composer&#x27;s membership continue to raise controversy. Sinding had made several remarks against the Nazi occupation. He had fought for the rights of Jewish musicians during the early 1930s and was a close friend of Nordahl Grieg.

<doc id="386136" wikidata="Q3325279" url="?curid=386136" title="Little Caesars Pizza Bowl">
<text>The Little Caesars Pizza Bowl (known as the Motor City Bowl until 2009) was a post-season college football bowl game that was played annually from 1997 to 2013. The first five games (1997–2001) were played at the Pontiac Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan, and moved to the 65,000-seat Ford Field in downtown Detroit, Michigan in 2002—the past and present homes of the Detroit Lions respectively. The game marked the first bowl game held in the Detroit area since the Cherry Bowl in 1984–85.

The Little Caesars Pizza Bowl featured a bowl-eligible team from the Mid-American Conference (usually the winner of the MAC Championship Game, although that team was not required to accept the bid; prior to the formation of the bowl the MAC champion earned an automatic bid to the Las Vegas Bowl) playing a bowl-eligible team from the Big Ten Conference. If the Big Ten did not have an eligible team, the game featured a team from the Sun Belt Conference that met the NCAA requirement of at least six wins. In the event that the Sun Belt did not have an available team, an at-large team could be chosen.

The final Little Caesars Pizza Bowl was held in 2013; it was displaced by the Quick Lane Bowl, which is organized by the Detroit Lions and also features Big Ten and MAC opponents (though the ACC served as the Big Ten&#x27;s opponent through 2019). Organizers explored the possibility of moving the Little Caesars Pizza Bowl to nearby Comerica Park as an outdoor game, but the game would instead be cancelled.

==History==
The Motor City Bowl started in 1997 at the Pontiac Silverdome.

The game was jointly sponsored by the &quot;Big Three&quot; automakers in Detroit from 1998 to 2007 (Ford, General Motors and Chrysler). Starting with the 2008 game, Chrysler was replaced by the Michigan Regional Council of Carpenters and Millwrights as a presenting sponsor. In 2009, Little Caesars became the title sponsor of the game after General Motors and Chrysler reorganized under bankruptcy protection. Ford remained as a sponsor. In 2011, the three automakers, along with the UAW, began contributing $100,000 jointly to become presenting sponsors of the game.

A bowl record crowd of 60,624 fans witnessed the 2007 bowl game between the Purdue Boilermakers and the Central Michigan Chippewas.

On April 12, 2010, it was announced that the Big Ten Conference had extended its affiliation with the Little Caesars Pizza Bowl (Big Ten no. 8) through the 2013 season. Also the Sun Belt Conference agreed to a secondary tie-in that would allow a Sun Belt Conference team to play in the Detroit-based game should the Big Ten Conference not have an available bowl-eligible team to play.

In August 2013, the Detroit Lions announced that it would hold a new bowl game at Ford Field beginning in 2014, between the Big Ten and an Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) opponent. While Pizza Bowl organizers attempted to move the bowl to Comerica Park (which is owned by Little Caesars&#x27; parent company Ilitch Holdings) and convert it to an outdoor game, these plans never came to fruition.

In August 2014, the Lions announced that the new game would be known as the Quick Lane Bowl, and that it would be held on the same day—December 26—that the Little Caesars Pizza Bowl was traditionally held on. In a statement to &quot;Crain&#x27;s Detroit Business&quot;, Motor City Bowl executive director Ken Hoffman confirmed that &quot;there is no Pizza Bowl for 2014. We will have to see about the future&quot;, implying that the game has been cancelled indefinitely in favor of the Quick Lane Bowl. The MAC holds a secondary tie-in for the Quick Lane Bowl.

<text>In mathematics, a homothety (or homothecy, or homogeneous dilation) is a transformation of an affine space determined by a point called its &quot;center&quot; and a nonzero number called its &quot;ratio&quot;, which sends point to a point by the rule,
: formula_1 for a fixed number formula_2.
Using position vectors:
:formula_3.
In case of formula_4 (Origin):
:formula_5,
which is a uniform scaling and shows the meaning of special choices for formula_6:
:for formula_7 one gets the &quot;identity&quot; mapping,
:for formula_8 one gets the &quot;reflection&quot; at the center,
For formula_9 one gets the &quot;inverse&quot; mapping defined by formula_6.

In Euclidean geometry homotheties are the similarities that fix a point and either preserve (if formula_11) or reverse (if formula_12) the direction of all vectors. Together with the translations, all homotheties of an affine (or Euclidean) space form a group, the group of dilations or homothety-translations. These are precisely the affine transformations with the property that the image of every line &quot;g&quot; is a line parallel to &quot;g&quot;.

In projective geometry, a homothetic transformation is a similarity transformation (i.e., fixes a given elliptic involution) that leaves the line at infinity pointwise invariant.

In Euclidean geometry, a homothety of ratio formula_6 multiplies &quot;distances&quot; between points by formula_14, &quot;areas&quot; by formula_15 and volumes by formula_16. Here formula_6 is the &quot;ratio of magnification&quot; or &quot;dilation factor&quot; or &quot;scale factor&quot; or &quot;similitude ratio&quot;. Such a transformation can be called an enlargement if the scale factor exceeds 1. The above-mentioned fixed point &quot;S&quot; is called &quot;homothetic center&quot; or &quot;center of similarity&quot; or &quot;center of similitude&quot;.

The term, coined by French mathematician Michel Chasles, is derived from two Greek elements: the prefix ( }; and () ). It describes the relationship between two figures of the same shape and orientation. For example, two Russian dolls looking in the same direction can be considered homothetic.

Homotheties are used to scale the contents of computer screens; for example, smartphones, notebooks, and laptops.

== Properties ==
The following properties hold in any dimension.

=== Mapping lines, line segments and angles ===
A homothety has the following properties:
* A &quot;line&quot; is mapped onto a parallel line. Hence: &quot;angles&quot; remain unchanged.
* The &quot;ratio of two line segments&quot; is preserved.
Both properties show: 
* A homothety is a &quot;similarity&quot;.

&quot;Derivation of the properties:&quot;
In order to make calculations easy it is assumed that the center formula_18 is the origin: formula_19. A line formula_20 with parametric representation formula_21 is mapped onto the point set formula_22 with equation formula_23, which is a line parallel to formula_20.

The distance of two points formula_25 is formula_26 and formula_27 the distance between their images. Hence, the &quot;ratio&quot; (quotient) of two line segments remains unchanged.

In case of formula_28 the calculation is analogous but a little extensive.

Consequences: A triangle is mapped on a similar one. The homothetic image of a circle is a circle. The image of an ellipse is a similar one. i.e. the ratio of the two axes is unchanged.

=== Graphical constructions ===

==== using the intercept theorem ====
If for a homothety with center formula_18 the image formula_30 of a point formula_31 is given (see diagram) then the image formula_32 of a second point formula_33, which lies not on line formula_34 can be constructed graphically using the intercept theorem: formula_32 is the common point th two lines formula_36 and formula_37. The image of a point collinear with formula_38 can be determined using formula_39.

==== using a pantograph ====
Before computers became ubiquitous, scalings of drawings were done by using a pantograph, a tool similar to a compass.

&quot;Construction and geometrical background:&quot;

#Take 4 rods and assemble a mobile &quot;parallelogram&quot; with vertices formula_40 such that the two rods meeting at formula_41 are prolonged at the other end as shown in the diagram. Choose the &quot;ratio&quot; formula_6.
#On the prolonged rods mark the two points formula_43 such that formula_44 and formula_45. This is the case if formula_46 (Instead of formula_6 the location of the center formula_18 can be prescribed. In this case the ratio is formula_49.) 
#Attach the mobile rods rotatable at point formula_18.
#Vary the location of point formula_51 and mark at each time point formula_52.

Because of formula_53 (see diagram) one gets from the &quot;intercept theorem&quot; that the points formula_54 are collinear (lie on a line) and equation formula_55 holds. That shows: the mapping formula_56 is a homothety with center formula_18 and ratio formula_6.

=== Composition ===

*The composition of two homotheties with the &quot;same center&quot; formula_18 is again a homothety with center formula_18. The homotheties with center formula_18 form a group.
*The composition of two homotheties with &quot;different centers&quot; formula_62 and its ratios formula_63 is 
::in case of formula_64 a &quot;homothety&quot; with its center on line formula_65 and ratio formula_66 or 
::in case of formula_67 a &quot;translation&quot; in direction formula_68. Especially, if formula_69 (point reflections).

&quot;Derivation:&quot;

For the composition formula_70 of the two homotheties formula_71 with centers formula_62 with
:formula_73
:formula_74 
one gets by calculation for the image of point formula_75:
:formula_76
:formula_77.
Hence, the composition is 
:in case of formula_67 a translation in direction formula_68 by vector formula_80.
:in case of formula_64 point 
:formula_82 
is a &quot;fixpoint&quot; (is not moved) and the composition
:formula_83. 
is a &quot;homothety&quot; with center formula_84 and ratio formula_66. formula_84 lies on line formula_65.

*The composition of a homothety and a translation is a homothety.

&quot;Derivation:&quot;

The composition of the homothety 
:formula_88 and the translation
:formula_89 is
:formula_90
:::formula_91
which is a homothety with center formula_92 and ratio formula_6.

=== In homogeneous coordinates ===
The homothety formula_94 
with center formula_95 can be written as the composition of a homothety with center formula_96 and a translation:
:formula_97.
Hence formula_98 can be represented in homogeneous coordinates 
by the matrix:
:formula_99

A pure homothety linear transformation is also conformal because it is composed of translation and uniform scale.

<text>Spectrum HoloByte, Inc. was an American video game developer and publisher. The company, founded in 1983, was known for its simulation games, notably the &quot;Falcon&quot; series of combat flight simulators, and for publishing the first version of &quot;Tetris&quot; outside the Soviet Union (in 1988 for MS-DOS). Spectrum HoloByte published games for various home computers and video game consoles.

==History==
Spectrum HoloByte was founded in 1983 in Boulder, Colorado, by Jeff Sauter, Phil Adam and Mike Franklin.

In 1987 Spectrum HoloByte merged with another game developer, Nexa Corporation, forming a common holding company, Sphere, Inc., and prompting the company&#x27;s move from Colorado to California. Nexa founder Gilman Louie served as chairman of the combined company.

In 1992, Spectrum HoloByte received an investment from Kleiner Perkins, which let the company repurchase shares formerly owned by Robert Maxwell&#x27;s companies, ending its ties to their bankruptcies. In December 1993, Sphere, Inc. merged with MicroProse to form MicroProse Inc. For the following years, games from both companies were published under their respective brands, but in 1996 all titles were consolidated under the MicroProse brand.

Hasbro Interactive acquired the merged company in 1998, and what had been Spectrum HoloByte ceased to exist when the development studio in Alameda, California, was closed in 1999.

<doc id="386145" wikidata="Q3338992" url="?curid=386145" title="New Orleans Bowl">
<text>The New Orleans Bowl is an NCAA-sanctioned post-season college football bowl game that has been played annually since 2001. It is normally held at Caesars Superdome in New Orleans; when the Superdome and the rest of the city suffered damage due to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the game was temporarily moved to Cajun Field in Lafayette, Louisiana, and given the name New Orleans Bowl at Lafayette. Since 2006, the bowl has been sponsored by R+L Carriers and officially known as the R+L Carriers New Orleans Bowl. The game was previously sponsored by Wyndham Hotels &amp; Resorts from 2002 to 2004 and was officially called the Wyndham New Orleans Bowl.

==Conference tie-ins==

In 2001, the Sun Belt Conference signed a temporary contract to play against the 5th-ranked team from the Mountain West Conference. Beginning in 2002, the New Orleans Bowl established conference tie-ins with the Sun Belt and Conference USA (C-USA). The Sun Belt usually sends its conference champion to the New Orleans Bowl, but can (and has) sent the champion to what is now known as the 68 Ventures Bowl, such as Arkansas State playing in the 2013 GoDaddy.com Bowl. For the 2021 season, the New Orleans Bowl has first pick in the Sun Belt Conference.

In 2010, Ohio represented the Mid-American Conference (MAC) in the New Orleans Bowl, after the Bowl released UTEP to compete in the regional New Mexico Bowl. In 2011 and 2014, a Mountain West team replaced C-USA as the opponent to the Sun Belt representative.

==History==

In the 2001 inaugural game, Colorado State defeated North Texas, 45–20. Starting in 2002, the Sun Belt signed a multi-year contract with Conference USA, and the two conferences began their bowl rivalry with a North Texas defeat of then-Conference USA member Cincinnati.

Due to damage by Hurricane Katrina to the Superdome, where the game is usually played, the 2005 game was played in Lafayette, Louisiana, at Cajun Field on the campus of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, and was dubbed the New Orleans Bowl at Lafayette. The game returned to the Superdome for the 2006 edition, with a new corporate sponsor in freight company R+L Carriers, renaming the game the R+L Carriers New Orleans Bowl. That game was won by Troy, co-champions of the Sun Belt Conference, over Rice, making their first bowl appearance since the 1961 Bluebonnet Bowl.

The 2011 through 2014 games were each won by the Louisiana–Lafayette Ragin&#x27; Cajuns by a combined score of 115–88 over four different opponents. However, the Ragin&#x27; Cajuns later had to vacate their 2011 and 2013 victories, due to major NCAA violations including ACT fraud. The Ragin&#x27; Cajuns also played in the 2016 edition of the bowl, losing to Southern Miss, and in the 2021 edition as well where they defeated Marshall.

<text>John David Dingell Jr. (July 8, 1926 – February 7, 2019) was an American politician from the state of Michigan who served as a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1955 until 2015. A member of the Democratic Party, Dingell holds the record as the longest-serving member of Congress in American history.

Born in Colorado Springs, Colorado, Dingell attended Georgetown University, where he earned a Bachelor of Science in chemistry in 1949 and a Juris Doctor in 1952. Dingell began his congressional career by succeeding his father, John Dingell Sr., as representative for on December 13, 1955. A longtime member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Dingell chaired the committee from 1981 to 1995 and from 2007 to 2009. He was Dean of the House of Representatives from 1995 to 2015. Dingell was instrumental in the passage of the Medicare Act, the Water Quality Act of 1965, the Clean Water Act of 1972, the Endangered Species Act of 1973, the Clean Air Act of 1990, and the Affordable Care Act, among other laws. He also helped to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Dingell was one of the final two World War II veterans to have served in Congress; the other was Texas Representative Ralph Hall.

Dingell announced on February 24, 2014, that he would not seek reelection to a 31st term in Congress. His wife, Debbie Dingell, successfully ran to succeed him in the 2014 election. President Barack Obama awarded Dingell the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2014. Dingell left office on January 3, 2015.

== Early life, education, and early career ==
Dingell was born on July 8, 1926, in Colorado Springs, Colorado, the son of Grace (née Bigler) and John Dingell Sr. (1894–1955). His father was the son of Polish immigrants, and his mother had Swiss and Scots-Irish ancestry. The Dingells were in Colorado in search of a cure for Dingell Sr.&#x27;s tuberculosis. The Dingell surname had been Dzięglewicz, and was Americanized by John Dingell Sr.&#x27;s father.

The family moved back to Michigan, and in 1932, Dingell Sr. was elected the first representative of Michigan&#x27;s newly created 15th District. In Washington, D.C., John Jr. attended Georgetown Preparatory School and then the House Page School when he served as a page for the U.S. House of Representatives from 1938 to 1943. He was on the floor of the House when President Franklin D. Roosevelt gave his famous speech after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. In 1944, at the age of 18, Dingell joined the United States Army. He rose to the rank of second lieutenant and received orders to take part in the first wave of a planned invasion of Japan in November 1945; the Congressman said that President Harry S. Truman&#x27;s decision to use the atomic bomb to end the war saved his life.

Dingell attended Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., receiving a Bachelor of Science in chemistry in 1949 and a Juris Doctor in 1952. He was a lawyer in private practice, a research assistant to U.S. District Court judge Theodore Levin, a congressional employee, a forest ranger, and assistant prosecuting attorney for Wayne County until 1955.

== U.S. House of Representatives ==

=== Elections ===

In 1955, Dingell&#x27;s father, John Dingell Sr., died. Dingell, a Democrat, won a special election to succeed him. He won a full term in 1956 and was re-elected 29 times, including runs in 1988 and 2006 with no Republican opponent. Dingell received less than 62% of the vote on only two occasions. In 1994 when the Republican Revolution swept the Republicans into the majority in the House of Representatives for the first time since 1954, Dingell received 59% of the vote. In 2010 when the Republicans re-took control of the House of Representatives, Dingell received 57% of the vote. Between them, he and his father represented the southeastern Michigan area for 80 years. His district was numbered as the 15th District from 1955 to 1965, when redistricting merged it into the Dearborn-based 16th District; in the primary that year, he defeated 16th District incumbent John Lesinski Jr.
In 2002, redistricting merged Dingell&#x27;s 16th District with the Washtenaw County and western Wayne County-based 13th District, represented by fellow Democratic Representative Lynn Rivers, whom Dingell also bested in the Democratic primary. The 15th District for the 109th Congress included Wayne County suburbs generally southwest of Detroit, the Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti areas in Washtenaw County, and all of Monroe County. For many years, Dingell represented much of western Detroit itself, though Detroit&#x27;s declining population and the growth of its suburbs pushed all of Detroit into the districts of fellow Democratic representatives, including John Conyers. Dingell always won re-election by double-digit margins, although the increasing conservatism of the mostly white suburbs of Detroit since the 1970s led to several serious Republican challenges in the 1990s.

Dingell announced on February 24, 2014, that he would not seek re-election to a 31st term in Congress.

=== Tenure ===

Dingell was sworn in as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives on December 13, 1955.

Dingell was instrumental in the passage of the Medicare Act, the Water Quality Act of 1965, the Clean Water Act of 1972, the Endangered Species Act of 1973, the Clean Air Act of 1990, and the Affordable Care Act, among others. He also helped to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964. During his tenure in Congress, he voted in favor of the 1957 Civil Rights Act, the Civil Rights Act of 1960, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Civil Rights Act of 1968. He voted as well for the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

Dingell was generally classified as a moderately liberal member of the Democratic Party. Throughout his career he was a leading congressional supporter of organized labor, social welfare measures and traditional progressive policies. At the beginning of every Congress, Dingell introduced a bill providing for a national health insurance system, the same bill that his father proposed while he was in Congress. Dingell also strongly supported Bill Clinton&#x27;s managed-care proposal early in his administration. In October 1998, President Clinton began a Roosevelt Room appearance &quot;by thanking Senator Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia and Congressman Dingell for their steadfast support of Medicare and their participation in our Medicare Commission.&quot;

On some issues, though, Dingell reflected the values of his largely Catholic and working-class district. He supported the Vietnam War until 1971. While he supported all of the civil rights bills, he opposed expanding school desegregation to Detroit suburbs via mandatory busing. He took a fairly moderate position on abortion. He worked to balance clean air legislation with the need to protect manufacturing jobs. As well, in the early 1980s, he was a prominent politician who used &quot;Japan bashing&quot;, blaming &quot;little yellow men&quot; for domestic automakers&#x27; misfortune, further fostering anti-Japanese racism in Detroit and contributing to the environment that led to the Killing of Vincent Chin, an American man of Chinese descent killed in the Detroit suburbs by two autoworkers who mistakenly thought he was Japanese.

An avid sportsman and hunter, he strongly opposed gun control, and was a former board member of the National Rifle Association of America. For many years, Dingell received an A+ rating from the NRA. Dingell helped make firearms exempt from the 1972 Consumer Product Safety Act so that the Consumer Product Safety Commission had no authority to recall defective guns. Dingell&#x27;s wife, Representative Debbie Dingell, introduced legislation in 2018 to remove this exemption from the law.
Michael Barone wrote of Dingell in 2002:

Dingell was Dean of the House of Representatives from 1995 to 2015.

On December 15, 2005, on the floor of the House, Dingell read a poem sharply critical of, among other things, Fox News, Bill O&#x27;Reilly, and the so-called &quot;War on Christmas&quot;. Along with John Conyers, in April 2006, Dingell brought an action against George W. Bush and others alleging violations of the Constitution in the passing of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. The case (&quot;Conyers v. Bush&quot;) was ultimately dismissed for lack of standing.

After winning re-election in 2008 for his 28th consecutive term, Dingell surpassed the record for having the longest tenure in the history of the House of Representatives on February 11, 2009. In honor of the record, Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm declared February 11, 2009, to be John Dingell Day.

Dingell was one of the final two World War II veterans to have served in Congress; the other was Texas Representative Ralph Hall.

Dingell left office on January 3, 2015. As of that date, Dingell had served with 2,453 different U.S. Representatives in his career. Dingell served in Congress for more than 59 years, retiring as the longest-tenured member of Congress in the history of the United States. His wife, Debbie Dingell, successfully ran to succeed him in the 2014 election.

==== Energy and Commerce chairman ====
A longtime member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Dingell chaired the committee from 1981 to 1995 and from 2007 to 2009.

Dingell was well known for his approach to congressional oversight of the executive branch. He subpoenaed numerous government officials to testify before the committee and grilled them for hours. He insisted that all who testified before his committee do so under oath, thus exposing them to perjury charges if they did not tell the truth. He and his committee uncovered numerous instances of corruption and waste, such as the use of $600 toilet seats at the Pentagon. He also claimed that the committee&#x27;s work led to resignations of many Environmental Protection Agency officials, and uncovered information that led to legal proceedings that sent many Food and Drug Administration officials to jail.
After serving as the committee&#x27;s ranking Democratic member for 12 years, Dingell regained the chairmanship in 2007. According to &quot;Newsweek&quot;, he had wanted to investigate the George W. Bush Administration&#x27;s handling of port security, the Medicare prescription drug program and Dick Cheney&#x27;s energy task force. &quot;Time&quot; magazine has stated that he had intended to oversee legislation that addresses global warming and climate change caused by carbon emissions from automobiles, energy companies and industry.

Dingell lost the chairmanship for the 111th Congress to Congressman Henry Waxman of California in a Democratic caucus meeting on November 20, 2008. Waxman mounted a challenge against Dingell on grounds that Dingell was stalling certain environmental legislation, which would have tightened vehicle emissions standards—something that could be detrimental to the Big Three automobile manufacturers that constitute a major source of employment in Dingell&#x27;s district. Dingell was given the title of Chairman Emeritus in a token of appreciation of his years of service on the committee, and a portrait of him is in the House collection.

==== Baltimore case ====
In the 1980s, Dingell led a series of congressional hearings to pursue alleged scientific fraud by Thereza Imanishi-Kari and Nobel Prize-winner David Baltimore. The National Institutes of Health&#x27;s fraud unit, then called the Office of Scientific Integrity, charged Imanishi-Kari in 1991 of falsifying data and recommended that she be barred from receiving research grants for 10 years. She appealed the decision and the Department of Health and Human Services appeals panel dismissed the charges against Imanishi-Kari and cleared her to receive grants. The findings and negative publicity surrounding them made David Baltimore decide to resign as president of Rockefeller University (after Imanishi-Kari was cleared he became president of the California Institute of Technology). The story of the case is described in Daniel Kevles&#x27; 1998 book &quot;The Baltimore Case&quot;, in a chapter of Horace Freeland Judson&#x27;s 2004 book &quot;The Great Betrayal: Fraud In Science&quot;, and in a 1993 study by Serge Lang, updated and reprinted in his book &quot;Challenges&quot;.

==== Robert Gallo claims ====
From 1991 to 1995 Dingell&#x27;s staff investigated claims that Robert Gallo had used samples supplied to him by Luc Montagnier to fraudulently claim to have discovered the AIDS virus. The report concluded that Gallo had engaged in fraud and that the NIH covered up his misappropriation of work by the French team at the Institut Pasteur. The report contended that:

The report was never formally published as a subcommittee report because of the 1995 change in control of the House from Democratic to Republican. Other accusations against Gallo were dropped, and while Montagnier&#x27;s group is considered to be the first to isolate the virus, Gallo&#x27;s has been recognized as first to prove that this virus was the cause of AIDS.

==== Environment ====

Dingell was a member of the Congressional Wildlife Refuge Caucus.

Dingell opposed raising mandatory automobile fuel efficiency standards, which he helped to write in the 1970s. Instead, he indicated that he intended to pursue a regulatory structure that takes greenhouse gas emissions and oil consumption into account. In a July 2007 interview with The Hill, he said &quot;I have made it very plain that I intend to see to it that CAFE is increased&quot; and pointed out that his plan would have Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards increased tantamount to those in the Senate bill recently passed. In November 2007, working with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Dingell helped draft an energy bill that would mandate 40% increase in fuel efficiency standards.

In June 1999, Dingell released a report in which the General Accounting Office cited concurrent design and construction was the reason for production of high levels of explosive benzene gas. In a statement, Dingell asserted that &quot;mismanagement by the United States Department of Energy and Westinghouse led to an extraordinary, and pathetic, waste of taxpayer money. All we have to show for $500 million is a 20-year delay and the opportunity to risk another $1 billion to make a problematic process work.&quot;

In July 2007, Dingell indicated he planned to introduce a new tax on carbon usage in order to curtail greenhouse gas emissions. The policy has been criticized by some, as polling numbers show voters may be unwilling to pay for the changes. A &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; editorial claimed that vehicle emissions standards that he supported will not yield any substantial greenhouse gas emissions savings.

As one of his final votes, Dingell voted against the Keystone XL pipeline on November 13, 2014.

==== Private sector ties ====
Dingell was closely tied to the automotive industry, as he represented Metro Detroit, where the Big Three automakers of General Motors, Chrysler, and the Ford Motor Company, are headquartered. Dingell encouraged the companies to improve fuel efficiency. During the automotive industry crisis of 2008–10, Dingell advocated for the bailout the companies received.
During the electoral span of 1989 through 2006, intermediaries for the aforementioned corporations contributed more than $600,000 to Dingell&#x27;s campaigns. Dingell also held an unknown quantity, more than $1 million in 2005, in assets through General Motors stock options and savings-stock purchase programs; his wife, Debbie Dingell, is a descendant of one of the Fisher brothers, founders of Fisher Body, a constituent part of General Motors. She worked as a lobbyist for the corporation until they married. She then moved to an administrative position there.

== Personal life ==
Dingell was Catholic. He had four children from his first marriage to Helen Henebry, a flight attendant. They married in 1952 and divorced in 1972. Dingell&#x27;s son, Christopher D. Dingell, served in the Michigan State Senate and has served as a judge on the Michigan Third Circuit Court.

In 1981, Dingell married Deborah &quot;Debbie&quot; Insley, who was 27 years his junior. In November 2014, Debbie Dingell won the election to succeed her husband as U.S. Representative for Michigan&#x27;s 12th congressional district. She took office in January 2015. She is the first non-widowed woman to immediately succeed her husband in Congress.

Dingell had surgery in 2014 to correct an abnormal heart rhythm, and the next year had surgery to install a pacemaker. He was hospitalized after a fall in 2017. On September 17, 2018, Dingell suffered an apparent heart attack and was hospitalized at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit.

In his later years, Dingell became an active Twitter user, and earned over 250,000 followers for his witty and sarcastic posts attacking Republicans, particularly Donald Trump. He earned the nickname &quot;the Dean of Twitter&quot;.

In 2018, Dingell was diagnosed with prostate cancer, which had metastasized. He chose to forgo treatment, and entered hospice care. Dingell died on February 7, 2019, at his home in Dearborn, Michigan. On the day of his death, Dingell authored a column discussing his &quot;last words&quot; for the country; the column was published in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;.

== Legacy ==
Dingell received the Walter P. Reuther Humanitarian Award from Wayne State University in 2006.

President Barack Obama awarded Dingell the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2014.

The John D. Dingell Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act, named in his honor and signed into law on March 12, 2019, permanently reauthorized the Land and Water Conservation Fund and established multiple areas of land protection.

<text>alt.sex is a Usenet newsgroup – a discussion group within the Usenet network – relating to human sexual activity. It was popular in the 1990s. An October 1993 survey by Brian Reid reported an estimated worldwide readership for the newsgroup of 3.3 million, that being 8% of the total Usenet readership, with 67% of all Usenet &quot;nodes&quot; (news servers users log in to access the system) carrying the group. At that time, had an estimated traffic of 2,300 messages per month.

The newsgroup hierarchy below comprises several newsgroups, including (which is the biggest newsgroup in the hierarchy after itself), , , , , and . The former four newsgroups generally feature text and images similar to the type that can be found in mainstream adult magazines, such as &quot;Playboy&quot; or &quot;Penthouse&quot;. The latter three newsgroups exemplify a set of sub-groups that deals in more &quot;extreme&quot; or less socially accepted topics. Other sub-groups include some with intentionally humorous names, such as , , and . There are more newsgroups on the less mainstream topics or sub-cultures, although as of 1998 they were generally far lower in traffic than those that deal in the more mainstream sexual behaviours. In a 1993 analysis of the hierarchy, Maureen Furniss concluded that &quot;sexually oriented boards act as a kind of support group for people who post notices to them, especially individuals whose sexual orientations are very marginalized (those who practice sadomasochism or bestiality, for example).&quot;

The first usenet BDSM newsgroup, alt.sex.bondage, was created in 1991. The term BDSM itself was first recorded on a post in alt.sex.bondage in 1991.

The University of Waterloo in 1994 ceased carrying , , , and upon the recommendation of its ethics committee, which had expressed concerns that the content of those newsgroups may have violated the Canadian &quot;Criminal Code&quot;.

 is a Usenet newsgroup set up specifically to help combat newsgroup spam cross-posted to the entire alt.sex hierarchy. The newsgroup is a simple &quot;spamtrap&quot; – a trap used to collect samples of unsolicited messages that can then be acted on by an automated anti-spam system. According to its charter, any message posted to may be cancelled automatically.

The well-known mass-mailing macro computer virus called the &quot;Melissa virus&quot; was originally distributed via the newsgroup. It was hidden inside a list purporting to contain passwords to pornographic websites. The messages containing the virus were posted with message headers claiming that the post had been written using the America Online (AOL) account of Scott Steinmetz, whose username was &quot;skyroket&quot;. Kizza reports that the headers on the post were probably forged by Melissa&#x27;s author, David L. Smith.

<text>The Museum of the Order of St John in Clerkenwell, London, tells the story of the Venerable Order of Saint John from its roots as a pan-European Order of Hospitaller Knights founded in Jerusalem during the Crusades, to its present commitment to providing first aid and care in the community through the St John Ambulance Brigade and running an Ophthalmic Hospital in Jerusalem. The museum is a member of the London Museums of Health &amp; Medicine.

== Building ==

The Museum is based in St John&#x27;s Gate, Clerkenwell, a 16th-century gatehouse in London, England that once formed the entrance to the Priory of Clerkenwell. This dates back to the 11th century and was once the English headquarters of the Order of St John. From here Hospitaller Knights went out to the Holy Land and later to Cyprus, Rhodes and Malta. They served in hospitals treating pilgrims, and fought to defend Christian interests in the Holy Land and the Mediterranean.

Tours take visitors to the oldest surviving part of the Medieval Priory, the Norman crypt, as well as the 16th century church above.

They then return to the Gate House, which after the Dissolution of the monasteries was put to many uses, with Shakespeare, Dr Johnson, Hogarth and Dickens all taking part in its story. The Gate was eventually bought back by the Order in the late nineteenth century, and is now beautifully decorated with heraldry, stained glass, gilding and carving to create glowing interiors, designed by John Oldrid Scott. Here visitors can see the fine furniture and painting collections.

The Museum in the Gate House tells the story of the history of the Order of St John and St John Ambulance. The Museum completed a renovation in November 2010. It was supported by funders such as the Heritage Lottery Fund and was designed by leading architects Donald Insall Associates, who had previously written the building&#x27;s Conservation Plan. Exhibition design company Metaphor undertook the internal exhibit design. This redevelopment has given the Order&#x27;s internationally significant collection the context it needs, including updating interpretative techniques, bringing more of the collections out of storage, and improving conservation conditions.

==Order of St John collections==
The collections of artefacts from the history of the Order of St John are extremely varied, covering all aspects of the history of an Order founded in the eleventh century and operating in most European countries.

There are archaeological finds, architectural fragments and social history material relating to the Priory site; seals and numismatics, including an important collection of Crusader coins; arms and armour, mainly European plate armour but also an example of Turkish Ottoman mail; drug jars, mortars and weights from the Hospitallers&#x27; pharmacy in Malta; decorative arts (portrait medals, ceramics, glass, silver, furniture, jewellery, insignia, textiles, ecclesiastical vestments) reflecting the tastes of the European aristocrats who joined the Order and became significant patrons of the arts.

The painting collection includes religious art, particularly images of patron saint of the Order, St John the Baptist, portraits of Grand Masters, Knights and clergy, sea and landscapes, depicting naval battles and views of Malta; prints and drawings include portraits of the Knights, topographical views and maps showing the famous fortifications on their island homes, as well as prints of the English Priory and the surrounding area of Clerkenwell. It also includes works by the oil painter Alix Jennings of the Second World War.

== St John Ambulance collections ==

St John Ambulance has a history spanning over 125 years and covering over 40 countries worldwide. It was founded by the British Order of St John and inspired by the medical traditions of the Hospitallers. Its story is told in a new exhibition.
Equipment ranges in size from examples of early ambulance transport to a Victorian nurse&#x27;s miniature first aid kit. There are training books written in numerous languages and first aid information comes in many forms, from cigarette cards to pop-up books and even on bandages.

Uniform includes ceremonial attire, a 1922 cadet uniform and A.R.P gas suit, and posters and advertisements feature uniform of many periods. The collection of medals, trophies and decorative certificates give a real sense of members&#x27; achievements and include one certificate made by a forger inside a prisoner-of-war camp. Banners and textiles commemorate special St John occasions.

Personal memorabilia tell what it was like to belong to the movement in different times and places. Nurse Nesbit&#x27;s cartoons record the lighter moments of serving in a First World War hospital. In an album, Lyn Brown put down her reactions as one of the first people to enter the newly liberated Belsen camp in 1945.

The film archive provides a glimpse into SJA&#x27;s involvement with the film industry and a huge photographic collection gives insights into individual lives and social change, as well as the changing organisation. Oral histories, particularly strong on the Second World War, also cover topics as diverse as first aid in the depression of the 1930s, setting up a division in Zanzibar in the 1950s and the work of a welfare officer in the Gulf War of 1991.

<text>George Edward &quot;Butch&quot; Byrd (born September 20, 1941) is an American former professional football cornerback who played in the American Football League (AFL) and National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Boston University Terriers and was selected by the Buffalo Bills in the fourth round of the 1964 AFL draft.

==Professional career==
Byrd was selected by the Buffalo Bills in the fourth round, with the 25th overall pick, of the 1964 American Football League draft and immediately made an impact in the defensive backfield, with seven interceptions. Such was his impact as a quick athlete that Lance Alworth (star flanker of the San Diego Chargers) stated his preference to go up against Byrd when it came to pass plays despite the Chargers trying to dissuade him, with Alworth stating: &quot;I want to play against the best&quot;. Byrd sometimes also played as a punt returner, scoring a punt return touchdown in 1966. He was a five-time AFL All-Star and he was selected for the AFL All-Time Second-team. When he retired in 1971, he was one of thirty players with 40 interceptions (which resulted in him being tied for 15th); in the half-century since he retired, over thirty more players have joined him.

===Franchise records===
Byrd holds the Bills career records for interceptions with 40, interception return yards with 666 and interceptions returned for touchdowns with 5.

==After football==
After his career ended, he worked in management for the Chrysler Corporation and Polaroid, working 22 years with the latter company.

==Honors==
Byrd was inducted into the Boston University Hall of Fame, the LaSalle Institute Athletic Hall of Fame and the Albany Capital District Hall of Fame, all in 1980. He also was named to the All-Time Buffalo Bills Silver Anniversary Team in 1984, and in 2008 was selected to the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame. He was awarded the Ralph C. Wilson Jr. Distinguished Service Award in 1994. Despite his records, he has not been named a member of the Buffalo Bills Wall of Fame nor the Pro Football Hall of Fame, which has received notice from columnists in the Buffalo media.

<text>Sde Boker () is a kibbutz in the Negev desert of southern Israel. Best known as the retirement home of Israel&#x27;s first Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion, it falls under the jurisdiction of Ramat HaNegev Regional Council. In it had a population of .

==History==
A large agricultural farm or small village existed here in the early Islamic period, from the late 7th century to the early 9th century. Remains of dozens of structures exist, including a mosque near which hundreds of Arabic inscriptions were found.

The modern kibbutz was established on 15 May 1952 by former soldiers, including Yehoshua Cohen who assassinated United Nations envoys Folke Bernadotte and André Sérot in 1948. In 1953 Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion resigned from office and moved to the kibbutz. Although he returned to politics in 1955, he continued to live in the kibbutz until his death in 1973, when he was buried nearby at Midreshet Ben-Gurion alongside his wife Paula Ben-Gurion. Ben-Gurion moved to the kibbutz inspired by his vision of cultivating the Negev desert and building up its surrounding towns such as Yeruham and Dimona. He believed that eventually the Negev would be home to many Jews who would move to Israel, and he felt that Sde Boker was a trailblazer and example for what should follow. His home was later turned into a museum.

In his official writings Ben-Gurion often mused about his efforts at rejuvenating the Negev:

Sde Boker is also well known for its Bedouin tents. In 2014, it was host to the Midburn festival.

On March 27, 2022, Sde Boker was the site of &quot;the Negev Summit&quot; of foreign ministers from the United States, Bahrain, Morocco, the United Arab Emirates, and Egypt.

==Climate==
Sde Boker has a hot desert climate (Köppen: &quot;BWh&quot;), with cool winters and hot summers.

<text>Larry Felser (April 5, 1933 – April 24, 2013) was a sports columnist and writer for the &quot;Buffalo Courier-Express&quot; and later, &quot;The Buffalo Evening News&quot;, where he was a football beat writer, a columnist, and rose to the position of sports editor. Felser also wrote a column for &quot;The Sporting News&quot;.

Felser was born in Buffalo, New York. He covered every one of the first 37 Super Bowls, until his retirement, and was an impassioned advocate for American Football League players nominated to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, for which he served on the board of selectors. In 1984, he was the youngest writer ever to receive the Dick McCann Memorial Award for long and distinguished reporting of Professional Football. In 2000, he was inducted into the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame.

Felser died in Amherst, New York, aged 80. Felser and NFL Films head Steven Sabol were among only a few people to have been present at every Super Bowl game at the time of their respective deaths.

<text>In mathematics, the spectral radius of a square matrix is the maximum of the absolute values of its eigenvalues. More generally, the spectral radius of a bounded linear operator is the supremum of the absolute values of the elements of its spectrum. The spectral radius is often denoted by .

==Definition==
===Matrices===
Let be the eigenvalues of a matrix . The spectral radius of is defined as

:formula_1

The spectral radius can be thought of as an infimum of all norms of a matrix. Indeed, on the one hand, formula_2 for every natural matrix norm formula_3; and on the other hand, Gelfand&#x27;s formula states that formula_4. Both of these results are shown below.

However, the spectral radius does not necessarily satisfy formula_5 for arbitrary vectors formula_6. To see why, let formula_7 be arbitrary and consider the matrix
:formula_8. 
The characteristic polynomial of formula_9 is formula_10, so its eigenvalues are formula_11 and thus formula_12. However, formula_13. As a result,
:formula_14 
As an illustration of Gelfand&#x27;s formula, note that formula_15 as formula_16, since formula_17 if formula_18 is even and formula_19 if formula_18 is odd.

A special case in which formula_5 for all formula_6 is when formula_23 is a Hermitian matrix and formula_24 is the Euclidean norm. This is because any Hermitian Matrix is diagonalizable by a unitary matrix, and unitary matrices preserve vector length. As a result,
: formula_25

===Bounded linear operators===
In the context of a bounded linear operator on a Banach space, the eigenvalues need to be replaced with the elements of the spectrum of the operator, i.e. the values formula_26 for which formula_27 is not bijective. We denote the spectrum by
:formula_28 
The spectral radius is then defined as the supremum of the magnitudes of the elements of the spectrum:
:formula_29
Gelfand&#x27;s formula, also known as the spectral radius formula, also holds for bounded linear operators: letting formula_3 denote the operator norm, we have
:formula_31

A bounded operator (on a complex Hilbert space) is called a spectraloid operator if its spectral radius coincides with its numerical radius. An example of such an operator is a normal operator.

===Graphs===
The spectral radius of a finite graph is defined to be the spectral radius of its adjacency matrix.

This definition extends to the case of infinite graphs with bounded degrees of vertices (i.e. there exists some real number such that the degree of every vertex of the graph is smaller than ). In this case, for the graph define:

:formula_32

Let be the adjacency operator of :

:formula_33

The spectral radius of is defined to be the spectral radius of the bounded linear operator .

==Upper bounds==

===Upper bounds on the spectral radius of a matrix===

The following proposition gives simple yet useful upper bounds on the spectral radius of a matrix.

Proposition. Let with spectral radius and a sub-multiplicative matrix norm . Then for each integer formula_34:

::formula_35

Proof

Let be an eigenvector-eigenvalue pair for a matrix &quot;A&quot;. By the sub-multiplicativity of the matrix norm, we get:

:formula_36

Since , we have

:formula_37

and therefore

:formula_35

concluding the proof.

=== Upper bounds for spectral radius of a graph ===
There are many upper bounds for the spectral radius of a graph in terms of its number &quot;n&quot; of vertices and its number &quot;m&quot; of edges. For instance, if

:formula_39

where formula_40 is an integer, then

:formula_41

==Symmetric matrices==

For real-valued matrices formula_23 the inequality formula_43 holds in particular, where formula_44 denotes the spectral norm. In the case
where formula_23 is symmetric, this inequality is tight:

Theorem. Let formula_46 be symmetric, i.e., formula_47 Then it holds that formula_48

Proof

Let formula_49 be the eigenpairs of &quot;A&quot;. Due to the symmetry of &quot;A&quot;,
all formula_50 and formula_51 are real-valued and the eigenvectors formula_50 are orthonormal.
By the definition the spectral norm, there exists an formula_53 with
formula_54 such that formula_55 Since the eigenvectors formula_50 form a basis
of formula_57 there exists
factors formula_58 such that formula_59 which implies that
:formula_60

From the orthonormality of the eigenvectors formula_50 it follows that
:formula_62
and 
:formula_63

Since formula_64 is chosen such that it maximizes formula_65 while satisfying formula_66 the values of formula_67 must be such that they maximize formula_68 while satisfying formula_69 This is achieved by setting formula_70 for formula_71 and formula_72 otherwise, yielding a value of formula_73

==Power sequence==

The spectral radius is closely related to the behavior of the convergence of the power sequence of a matrix; namely as shown by the following theorem.

Theorem. Let with spectral radius . Then if and only if
:formula_74
On the other hand, if , formula_75. The statement holds for any choice of matrix norm on .

Proof

Assume that formula_76 goes to zero as formula_18 goes to infinity. We will show that . Let be an eigenvector-eigenvalue pair for &quot;A&quot;. Since , we have

:formula_78

Since by hypothesis, we must have

:formula_79

which implies formula_80. Since this must be true for any eigenvalue formula_26, we can conclude that .

Now, assume the radius of is less than . From the Jordan normal form theorem, we know that for all , there exist with non-singular and block diagonal such that:

:formula_82

with

:formula_83

where

:formula_84

It is easy to see that

:formula_85

and, since is block-diagonal,

:formula_86

Now, a standard result on the -power of an formula_87 Jordan block states that, for formula_88:

:formula_89

Thus, if formula_90 then for all formula_91. Hence for all we have:

:formula_92

which implies

:formula_93

Therefore,

:formula_94

On the other side, if formula_95, there is at least one element in that does not remain bounded as increases, thereby proving the second part of the statement.

==Gelfand&#x27;s formula==

Gelfand&#x27;s formula, named after Israel Gelfand, gives the spectral radius as a limit of matrix norms.

=== Theorem ===

For any matrix norm we have
:formula_96.

Moreover, in the case of a consistent matrix norm formula_97 approaches formula_98 from above (indeed, in that case formula_99 for all formula_18).

===Proof===
For any , let us define the two following matrices:

:formula_101

Thus,

:formula_102

We start by applying the previous theorem on limits of power sequences to :

:formula_103

This shows the existence of such that, for all ,
:formula_104
Therefore,
:formula_105

Similarly, the theorem on power sequences implies that formula_106 is not bounded and that there exists such that, for all ,
:formula_107
Therefore,
:formula_108

Let }. Then,
:formula_109
that is,
:formula_110
This concludes the proof.

===Corollary===
Gelfand&#x27;s formula yields a bound on the spectral radius of a product of commuting matrices: if formula_111 are matrices that all commute, then

:formula_112

===Numerical example===

Consider the matrix

:formula_113

whose eigenvalues are ; by definition, . In the following table, the values of formula_114 for the four most used norms are listed versus several increasing values of k (note that, due to the particular form of this matrix,formula_115):

<doc id="386172" wikidata="Q3127854" url="?curid=386172" title="Harry Lauder">
<text>Sir Henry Lauder (; 4 August 1870 – 26 February 1950) was a Scottish singer and comedian popular in both music hall and vaudeville theatre traditions; he achieved international success.

He was described by Sir Winston Churchill as &quot;Scotland&#x27;s greatest ever ambassador&quot;, who &quot;... by his inspiring songs and valiant life, rendered measureless service to the Scottish race and to the British Empire.&quot; He became a familiar worldwide figure deploying his kilt and (walking stick) as icons of Scottishness to huge acclaim, especially in America. Among his most popular songs were &quot;Roamin&#x27; in the Gloamin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;A Wee &quot;, &quot;The End of the Road&quot; and, a particularly big hit for him, &quot;I Love a Lassie&quot;.

Lauder&#x27;s understanding of life, its pathos and joys, earned him his popularity. Beniamino Gigli commended his singing voice and clarity. Lauder usually performed in full Highland regalia—kilt, sporran, tam o&#x27; shanter, and twisted walking stick, and sang Scottish-themed songs.

By 1911 Lauder had become the highest-paid performer in the world, and was the first British artist to sell a million records; by 1928 he had sold double that. He raised vast amounts of money for the war effort during the First World War, for which he was knighted in 1919. He went into semi-retirement in the mid-1930s, but briefly emerged to entertain troops in the Second World War. By the late 1940s he was suffering from long periods of ill-health. He died in Scotland in 1950.

==Early life==
Lauder was born on 4 August 1870 in his maternal grandfather&#x27;s house in Portobello, Edinburgh, Scotland, the eldest of seven children. By the time of the 1871 census he and his parents were living at 1 Newbigging Veitchs Cottages, Inveresk. His father, John Lauder, was the grandson of George Lauder of Inverleith Mains &amp; the St Bernard&#x27;s Well estate, Edinburgh. He claimed in his autobiography that his family were descendants of the feudal barons the Lauders of the Bass; and his mother, Isabella Urquhart MacLeod McLennan, was born in Arbroath to a family from the Black Isle. John and Isabella married on 26 August 1870. Lauder&#x27;s father moved to Newbold, Derbyshire, in early 1882 to take up a job designing porcelain, but died on 20 April from pneumonia. Isabella, left with little more than John&#x27;s life insurance proceeds of £15, moved with the children to be with her family in Arbroath. To finance his education beyond age 11, Harry worked part-time at a flax mill. He made his first public appearance, singing, at a variety concert at Oddfellows&#x27; Hall in Arbroath when he was 13 years old, winning first prize for the night (a watch).

In 1884 the family went to Hamilton, South Lanarkshire, to live with Isabella&#x27;s brother, Alexander, who found Harry employment at Eddlewood Colliery at ten shillings per week; he kept this job for a decade.

== Career ==
=== Miner ===
On 8 January 1910, the &quot;Glasgow Evening Times&quot; reported that Lauder had told the &quot;New York World&quot; that, during his mining career:

I was entombed once for 6 long hours. It seemed like 6 years. There were no visible means of getting out either – we had just to wait. I was once right next to a cave-in when my fire boss was buried alive. As we were working and chatting a big stone twice as big as a trunk came tumbling down on my mate from overhead, doubling him like a jack-knife. It squeezed his face right down on the floor. God knows I wasn&#x27;t strong enough to lift that rock alone, but by superhuman efforts I did. This gave him a chance to breathe and then I shouted. Some men 70 yards away heard me and came and got him out alive. A chap who worked beside me was killed along with 71 others at Udston, and all they could identify him with was his pin leg. I wasn&#x27;t there that day.
:— Harry Lauder

Lauder said he was &quot;proud to be old coal-miner&quot; and in 1911, became an outspoken advocate, &quot;pleading the cause of the poor pit ponies&quot; to Winston Churchill, when introduced to him at the House of Commons and later reported to the &quot;Tamworth Herald&quot; that he &quot;could talk for hours about my wee four-footed friends of the mine. But I think I convinced that the time has now arrived when something should be done by the law of the land to improve the lot and working conditions of the patient, equine slaves who assist so materially in carrying on the great mining industry of this country.&quot;

=== Performer ===

Lauder often sang to the miners in Hamilton, who encouraged him to perform in local music halls. While singing in nearby Larkhall, he received 5 shillings—the first time he was paid for singing. He received further engagements including a weekly &quot;go-as-you please&quot; night held by Mrs. Christina Baylis at her Scotia Music Hall/Metropole Theatre in Glasgow. She advised him to gain experience by touring music halls around the country with a concert party, which he did. The tour allowed him to quit the coal mines and become a professional singer. Lauder concentrated his repertoire on comedic routines and songs of Scotland and Ireland.

By 1894, Lauder had turned professional and performed local characterisations at small, Scottish and northern English music halls but had ceased the repertoire by 1900. In March of that year, Lauder travelled to London and reduced the heavy dialect of his act which according to a biographer, Dave Russell, &quot;handicapped Scottish performers in the metropolis&quot;. He was an immediate success at the Charing Cross Music Hall and the London Pavilion, venues at which the theatrical paper &quot;The Era&quot; reported that he had generated &quot;great furore&quot; among his audiences with three of his self-composed songs.

===1900–1914===
In 1905 Lauder&#x27;s success in leading the Howard &amp; Wyndham pantomime at the Theatre Royal, Glasgow, for which he wrote &quot;I Love a Lassie&quot;, made him a national star, and he obtained contracts with Sir Edward Moss and others. Lauder then made a switch from music hall to variety theatre and undertook a tour of America in 1907. The following year, he performed a private show before Edward VII at Sandringham, and in 1911, he again toured the United States where he commanded $1,000 a night.

In 1912, he was top of the bill at Britain&#x27;s first ever Royal Command Performance, in front of King George V, organised by Alfred Butt. Lauder undertook world tours extensively during his forty-year career, including 22 trips to the United States—for which he had his own railway train, the Harry Lauder Special, and made several trips to Australia, where his brother John had emigrated.

Lauder was, at one time, the highest-paid performer in the world, making the equivalent of £12,700 a night plus expenses. He was paid £1125 for an engagement at the Glasgow Pavilion Theatre in 1913 and was later considered by the press to earn one of the highest weekly salaries by a theatrical performer during the prewar period. In January 1914 he embarked on a tour that included the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Canada.

===First World War===

The First World War broke out while Lauder was visiting Australia. During the war Lauder promoted recruitment into the services and starred in many concerts for troops at home and abroad. Campaigning for the war effort in 1915, he then wrote &quot;I know that I am voicing the sentiment of thousands and thousands of people when I say that we must retaliate in every possible way regardless of cost. If these German savages want savagery, let them have it&quot;.

Following the December 1916 death of his son on the Western Front; Lauder led successful charity fundraising efforts, organised a recruitment tour of music halls and entertained troops in France with a piano. He travelled to Canada in 1917 on a fundraising exercise for the war, where, on 17 November he was guest-of-honour and speaker at the Rotary Club of Toronto Luncheon, when he raised nearly three-quarters of a million dollars worth of bonds for Canada&#x27;s Victory Loan. Through his efforts in organising concerts and fundraising appeals he established the charity, the Harry Lauder Million Pound Fund, for maimed Scottish soldiers and sailors, to help servicemen return to health and civilian life; and he was knighted in May 1919 for Empire service during the War.

=== Postwar years ===
After the First World War, Lauder continued to tour variety theatre circuits. In January 1918, he famously visited Charlie Chaplin, and the two leading comedy icons of their time acted in a short film together.

His final tour was in North America in 1932. He made plans for a new house at Strathaven, to be built over the site and ruin of an old manor, called Lauder Ha&#x27;. He was semi-retired in the mid-1930s, until his final retirement was announced in 1935. He briefly emerged from retirement to entertain troops during the Second World War and make wireless broadcasts with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra.

===Australia===
Possibly Lauder&#x27;s strongest connections were with Australia. Both Lauder, his wife and son, brother Matt and his wife, were all in Australia when World War I broke out. Their brother John had already emigrated, about 1906, to Kurri Kurri (and, later, Newcastle), New South Wales, and Matt&#x27;s eldest son John would also emigrate there in 1920. Lauder wrote that &quot;every time I return to Australia I am filled with genuine enthusiasm...it is one of the very greatest countries in the world.&quot;

Lauder was next in Australia (with his wife and her mother) in 1919, arriving at Sydney on 1 March on board the Oceanic Steamship Company&#x27;s liner S.S. &quot;Ventura&quot;, from San Francisco, and he was &quot;in situ&quot; at the Hotel Australia when he was formally notified that he was to be knighted upon his return to Britain. His next visit was in 1923 when his brother John was on hand in Sydney, with their nephew John (Matt&#x27;s son), to welcome Lauder, his wife and her brother Tom Vallance, after a four-year absence from Australia. He visited and stayed with his brother John in Newcastle on several occasions, two well-known visits being in 1925, when he gave several performances at Newcastle&#x27;s Victoria Theatre for three weeks commencing on 8 August, and again in 1929 arriving in Newcastle for a brief visit on 25 July. Lauder departed Sydney for the USA on board the liner SS &quot;Ventura&quot; on Saturday 27 July 1929, a ship he was familiar with. In 1934–5, his brother John spent 10 months with him in Scotland.

===South Africa===
Sir Harry Lauder&#x27;s 1925 reception in South Africa has never been equalled in that country. En route to Australia, he and his wife arrived in Cape Town at Easter. Over twenty thousand people had lined the streets for hours beforehand and it was reported that every policeman in the city plus mounted police were required to keep order. All traffic came to a standstill. He played for two weeks at the Opera House to packed audiences every night, figures &quot;which staggered the management&quot;. He moved on to Johannesburg where his reception was equally amazing, described by a reporter who said &quot;never, as long as I live, shall I forget it!&quot;

==Works==

Lauder wrote most of his own songs, favourites of which were &quot;Roamin&#x27; In The Gloamin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;I Love a Lassie&quot;, &quot;A Wee Deoch-an-Doris&quot;, and &quot;Keep Right On To The End of the Road&quot;, which is used by Birmingham City Football Club as their club anthem. He starred in three British films: &quot;Huntingtower&quot; (1927), &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot; (1929) and &quot;The End of the Road&quot; (1936). He also appeared in a test film for the Photokinema sound-on-disc process in 1921. This film is part of the UCLA Film and Television Archive collection; however, the disc is missing. In 1914, Lauder appeared in 14 Selig Polyscope experimental short sound films. In 1907, he appeared in a short film singing &quot;I Love a Lassie&quot; for British Gaumont. The British Film Institute has several reels of what appears to be an unreleased film &quot;All for the Sake of Mary&quot; (c. 1920) co-starring Effie Vallance and Harry Vallance.

He wrote a number of books, which ran into several editions, including &quot;Harry Lauder at Home and on Tour&quot; (1912), &quot;A Minstrel in France&quot; (1918), &quot;Between You and Me&quot; (1919), &quot;Roamin&#x27; in the Gloamin&quot;&#x27; (1928 autobiography), &quot;My Best Scotch Stories&quot; (1929), &quot;Wee Drappies&quot; (1931) and &quot;Ticklin&#x27; Talks&quot; (circa 1932).

==Recordings==
Lauder made his first recordings, resulting in nine selections, for the Gramophone &amp; Typewriter company early in 1902. He continued to record for Gramophone until the middle of 1905, most recordings appearing on the Gramophone label, but others on Zonophone. He then recorded fourteen selections for Pathé Records June 1906. Two months later he was back at Gramophone, and performed for them in several sessions through 1908. That year he made several two and four-minute cylinders for Edison Records. Next year he recorded for Victor in New York. He continued to make some cylinders for Edison, but was primarily associated with His Master&#x27;s Voice and Victor.

In 1910 Victor introduced a mid-priced purple-label series, the first twelve issues of which were by Lauder. In 1927 Victor promoted Lauder recordings to their Red Seal imprint, making him the only comedic performer to appear on the label primarily associated with operatic celebrities. Lauder is one of three artists shown on Victor&#x27;s black, purple, blue and red Seal records (the others being Lucy Isabelle Marsh and Reinald Werrenrath). His final recordings were made in 1940, but Lauder records were issued in the new format as current material when RCA Victor introduced the 45rpm record.

==Portraits==

Lauder is credited with giving the then 21-year-old portrait artist Cowan Dobson his opening into society by commissioning him, in 1915, to paint his portrait. This was considered to be so outstanding that another commission came the following year, to paint his son Captain John Lauder, and again another commission in 1921 to paint Lauder&#x27;s wife, the latter portrait being after the style of John Singer Sargent. These three portraits remain with the family. The same year, Scottish artist James McBey painted another portrait of Lauder, today in the Glasgow Museums.

In the tradition of the magazine &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, there appeared numerous caricatures of Lauder. One is by Al Frueh (1880–1968) in 1911 and published in 1913 in the &quot;New York World&quot; magazine, another by Henry Mayo Bateman, now in London&#x27;s National Gallery, and one of 1926 by Alick P.F.Ritchie, for Players Cigarettes, today in the London National Portrait Gallery (ref:NPG D2675).

== Personal life ==

On 19 June 1891 Lauder married Ann, daughter of James Vallance, a colliery manager in Hamilton; their only son, Captain John Currie Lauder, was educated at the City of London School followed by a degree from Jesus College, Cambridge University. John became a captain in the 8th Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, and was killed in action on 28 December 1916 at Pozières. Encouraged by Ann, Lauder returned to the stage three days after learning of John&#x27;s death. He wrote the song &quot;The End of the Road&quot; (published as a collaboration with the American William Dillon, 1924) in the wake of John&#x27;s death, and built a monument for him in the private Lauder cemetery in Glenbranter. (John Lauder was buried in the war cemetery at Ovillers, France).

Lauder was a devout Christian and with the exception of engagements in the United States never performed on Sundays.

Lady Lauder died on 31 July 1927, at 54, a week after surgery. She was buried next to her son&#x27;s memorial in the private Lauder cemetery on the 14,000 acre Glenbranter estate in Argyll, where her parents would later join her. Lauder&#x27;s niece, Margaret (1900–1966), subsequently became his secretary and companion until his death.

Lauder bought the Glenbranter Estate on the Cowal peninsula in Argyll on the 13 October 1916, then sold it to the Forestry Commission in 1921. The estate later became part of the Argyll Forest Park established in 1935. The Invernoaden Estate house, in Glenbranter was demolished in 1956.

== Freemasonry ==

He was initiated a Freemason on 28 January 1897 in Lodge Dramatic, No. 571, (Glasgow, Scotland) and remained an active Freemason for the rest of his life.

==Death==
He spent his last years at &quot;Lauder Ha&quot; (or Hall), his Strathaven home, where he died on 26 February 1950, aged 79. His funeral was held at Cadzow Church in Hamilton on 2 March. It was widely reported, notably by Pathé newsreels. One of the chief mourners was the Duke of Hamilton, a close family friend, who led the funeral procession through Hamilton, and read The Lesson. Wreaths were sent from Queen Elizabeth and Sir Winston Churchill. Lauder was interred with his brother George and their mother in the family plot at Bent Cemetery in Hamilton.

In 1932 he had placed the land at Strathaven where Lauder Hall would stand, and its park, in the name of his niece and secretary, Margaret Lauder to avoid high death duties should he die, as he wanted it preserved as the family seat and a museum to himself. This proved to be a wise move as although he left moveable estate of £358,971, the death duties on this amounted to £207,581. After personal bequests to family totalling £27,000 the residue went to Margaret Lauder.
==In literature and popular culture==
Lauder&#x27;s first command performance before Edward VII is satirised by Neil Munro in his Erchie Macpherson story &quot;Harry and the King&quot;, first published in the &quot;Glasgow Evening News&quot; of 14 September 1908.

==Posthumous==

In the 1941 film &quot;Babes on Broadway&quot;, Mickey Rooney, imitating Lauder, sings &quot;She Is Ma Daisy.&quot; In the 1942 film &quot;Random Harvest&quot;, Greer Garson plays a member of a travelling troupe. She sings &quot;She Is Ma Daisy&quot; and tells jokes doing an impression of Lauder.
Websites carry much of his material and the Harry Lauder Collection, amassed by entertainer Jimmy Logan, was bought for the nation and donated to the University of Glasgow. When the A199 Portobello bypass opened, it was named the &quot;Sir Harry Lauder Road&quot;.

On 28 July 1987, the Lord Provost of Edinburgh hosted a luncheon at the Edinburgh City Chambers to commemorate the 60th Anniversary of Lauder receiving the Freedom of the City attended by his great-nephew Gregory Lauder-Frost. On 4 August 2001 Lauder-Frost opened the Sir Harry Lauder Memorial Garden at Portobello Town Hall. BBC2 Scotland broadcast a documentary, &quot;Something About Harry&quot;, on 30 November 2005. On 29 September 2007, Lauder-Frost rededicated the Burslem Golf Course &amp; Club at Stoke-on-Trent, which had been formally opened exactly a century before by Harry Lauder.

In the 1990s, samples of recordings of Lauder were used on two tracks recorded by the Scottish folk/dance music artist Martyn Bennett.

The Corkscrew hazel ornamental cultivar of common hazel (&quot;Corylus avellana&quot; &#x27;Contorta&#x27;) is sometimes known as Harry Lauder&#x27;s Walking Stick, in reference to the crooked walking stick Lauder often carried.

<text>Jerome Field Magee (April 11, 1928 – January 2, 2019) was an American newspaper columnist. 

Magee was a sports writer in San Diego for 52 years, retiring from the &quot;San Diego Union-Tribune&quot; in 2008. He began his career more than five decades earlier at the then-&quot;San Diego Union&quot; and also wrote for &quot;Pro Football Weekly&quot;.

==Biography==
Magee, who was born in Chicago, Illinois, was raised in Nebraska. He graduated in 1950 from the University of Nebraska. He served in the Army in Korea.

==Career==
His first job newspaper job was as a copyboy at the &quot;Omaha World-Herald&quot;, where one of his tasks was to mix flour and water into the paste used by copy readers. He joined the &quot;San Diego Union-Tribune&quot; in 1956.
Magee was called &quot;an American Football League apologist&quot; by his contemporaries who covered NFL football, adopting it himself and regularly quoting it. He took on what he has called the &quot;NFL apologists,&quot; including William Wallace, sports columnist with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and Jerry Green of the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot;, in Magee&#x27;s attempt to puncture what he called &quot;NFL myths.&quot;

Magee brought attention to the AFL&#x27;s style of football, including writing about Will McDonough and his service on the American Football League Hall of Fame board of selectors. Magee wrote frequently about interviews he had with American Football League superfan, archivist and historian Ange Coniglio.

Upon Magee&#x27;s retirement in September 2008, the &quot;Union-Tribune&quot; published a tribute article about Magee that was written by people he covered and worked with, including former San Diego Chargers running back Hank Bauer.

==Recognition==
October 29, 2008 was proclaimed &quot;Jerry Magee Day&quot; by the San Diego City Council in recognition of his more than 50 years as &quot;one of 
the region&#x27;s top sports writers.&quot;

In 1987, Magee was given the Dick McCann Memorial Award from the Professional Football Writers of America organization, which is handed out to reporters who have made &quot;a long and distinguished contribution&quot; to pro football through coverage.

<text>Dino, Desi &amp; Billy were an American singing trio that existed between 1964 and 1969. The group featured Dean &quot;Dino&quot; Martin (Dean Paul Martin, the son of singer and actor Dean Martin), Desi Arnaz Jr. (Desiderio Arnaz IV, the son of television stars Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball), and their friend Billy Hinsche. A reconstituted version of the group performed between 1998 and 2010.

==History==
Dino Martin, Desi Arnaz Jr. and Billy Hinsche first met in grammar school. Due to the family connections of Dino and Desi, the band&#x27;s first audition was for Frank Sinatra, who founded and still had an interest in Reprise Records, the recording label for Dean Martin. Though Arnaz, whose father was a famous drummer and who had learned to play drums from close family friend Richard Keith (who played Little Ricky on &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;) was a skilled drummer in his own right, the group did not play their own instruments on most of their records, instead using top session players, producers and songwriters. Producers included Lee Hazlewood, Billy Strange and Jimmy Bowen. Songwriters whose compositions were recorded by the group included Hazlewood, Red West, David Gates, Boyce and Hart, Clint Ballard Jr. and Bonner &amp; Gordon.

Dino, Desi &amp; Billy&#x27;s best known songs were &quot;I&#x27;m a Fool&quot; (1965; U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 No. 17; later covered by Alvin and the Chipmunks for their 1965 album &quot;Chipmunks à Go-Go&quot;) and &quot;Not the Lovin&#x27; Kind&quot; (1965; U.S. No. 25). Both were hits for the group before any group member had reached the age of 15. Following this success, in 1965, they toured as an opening act for the Beach Boys. The group also opened for Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders, Tommy Roe, Sam the Sham, the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful and the Mamas &amp; the Papas.

The band did not have a top 40 hit after 1965, despite releasing records for five years thereafter.

The group released one album in 1965 and three albums in 1966. Dino, Desi &amp; Billy albums contained primarily versions of Top 40 songs made popular by others, with new content being minor. The three boys made an appearance in the Dean Martin film &quot;Murderers&#x27; Row&quot; and sang the Boyce &amp; Hart song, &quot;If You&#x27;re Thinkin&#x27; What I&#x27;m Thinkin&#x27;&quot;. From 1966 to 1970, the group continued to release singles, encountering marginal success, which was not altered by a change of label to Columbia Records in 1969. Also in 1969, the group contributed three songs to the soundtrack of the surf film &quot;Follow Me&quot;. The group received top billing on the soundtrack album, despite the fact that most of the album featured music by composer Stu Phillips. Later in 1969, the group broke up, due in part to Desi joining his mother&#x27;s television show and Hinsche wishing to commence university studies.

The group was never a favorite of the critics. Writing for AllMusic, music critic Richie Unterberger characterized them as a group that &quot;never had an ounce of credibility&quot;, with music that was &quot;innocuously bland in the extreme.&quot; These sentiments may be contrasted with the fact that the band was well thought of by the Beach Boys, to the extent that Brian Wilson and Hinsche co-wrote one of the band&#x27;s original songs, and their final single, &quot;Lady Love&quot;. That single was released by Reprise Records in 1970, after the group had broken up. Hinsche&#x27;s sister, Annie, married Carl Wilson and Hinsche himself worked with the Beach Boys as a backing musician for many years.

Dean Paul Martin became a tennis player, actor and a captain in the California Air National Guard. He was married to actress Olivia Hussey and figure skater Dorothy Hamill, and was killed while piloting an F-4 Phantom jet in 1987.

In 1996, Sundazed Music released &quot;The Rebel Kind: The Best of Dino, Desi &amp; Billy&quot;, in which all of the group&#x27;s singles and other non-cover material was collected for the first time on one album.

From 1998 to 2010, a reconfiguration of the group, known as &quot;Ricci, Desi, &amp; Billy&quot;, performed at various times, in addition to releasing two live albums. The band performed new material and the original hits, with Ricci Martin, the youngest son of singer Dean Martin, replacing his late older brother, Dean Paul Martin.

Billy Hinsche died after a short battle with lung cancer on November 20, 2021. His mother, Celia Hinsche, also died on the same day.

Gary Lewis &amp; the Playboys were a contemporary group founded and led by Gary Lewis, the son of Dean Martin&#x27;s erstwhile comedy partner Jerry Lewis. With a sound likewise influenced by the British Invasion, their version of &quot;This Diamond Ring&quot; reached No. 1 in February 1965.

<doc id="386176" wikidata="Q5472408" url="?curid=386176" title="Trinity Metro">
<text>Trinity Metro is a transit agency located in and serving the city of Fort Worth, Texas and its suburbs in surrounding Tarrant County, part of the Dallas–Fort Worth metropolitan area. Since 1983, it was previously known officially as the Fort Worth Transportation Authority (FWTA), and branded itself as The T. As of January 29, 2018 the Board of Directors has voted to rebrand bus services as Trinity Metro, replacing the previous and long standing name. In , the system had a ridership of , or about per weekday as of .

Trinity Metro primarily operates the region&#x27;s bus service, and TEXRail, a hybrid rail system connecting downtown Fort Worth with DFW Airport via Northeast Tarrant County. The agency is also involved in the operation of the Trinity Railway Express (TRE) commuter rail line between from downtown Fort Worth and downtown Dallas in partnership with Dallas Area Rapid Transit and the North Texas Xpress (Route 64) express bus service in partnership with Denton County Transportation Authority.

==History==
Through the early 1970s, bus transit services in Fort Worth were provided by City Transit Company, a private enterprise. Starting in 1974, the city&#x27;s Traffic Engineering Department began coordinating bus operations. In 1978, the city established the Fort Worth Department of Transportation, which took over public transit operations. These operations included the City Transit Service (CITRAN) and the Surface Transportation Service (SURTRAN, a service jointly owned between the cities of Dallas and Fort Worth, shuttling passengers to and from DFW from stops in Dallas (including Dallas Union Station), Fort Worth and Arlington), with transportation services for the handicapped (MITS) being added in 1979.

On November 8, 1983, voters approved formation of The T. To finance the system, voters levied a half-cent sales tax. The CITRAN, SURTRAN, and MITS services were folded into the new agency, along with carpool and vanpool coordination.

The agency&#x27;s first addition came on November 5, 1991 when the small suburb of Lake Worth voted 344–206 in favor of joining the T. That prompted three more elections on May 2, 1992 when Blue Mound, Forest Hill and Richland Hills had the issue of joining the agency on the ballot. Blue Mound and Richland Hills voted in favor while Forest Hill declined the measure nearly 2–1.

The T saw its first departure when voters in Lake Worth approved a pullout in September 2003. Service withdrawal became effective on March 21, 2004. Lake Worth had previously tried to pull out in 1996, but that measure failed. On November 8, 2016, Richland Hills residents voted to withdraw from the agency&#x27;s services. FWTA&#x27;s final day of service in Richland Hills was November 23, 2016.

In 2001, the FWTA saw its cooperation efforts with DART pay off as the Trinity Railway Express reached downtown Fort Worth. The other end of the line terminates in downtown Dallas.

The TRE commuter line has a daily ridership of 9,100 and is the thirteenth most-ridden commuter rail system in the country.

On August 24, 2016, Trinity Metro broke ground on TEXRail, the second commuter rail project undertaken by the agency, and the first built solely by Trinity Metro. The rail line was initially envisioned to run along the existing Cotton Belt Railway Corridor from DFW airport to the Fort Worth Stockyards, head South along Union Pacific owned track to the Fort Worth Central Station, and continue along Fort Worth &amp; Western Railroad tracks to Benbrook Lake. As of the FWTA 2015 master plan, citing &quot;project costs and other considerations&quot;, the agency decided to build the 27 mile Minimum Operable Segment (MOS) between downtown Fort Worth and DFW Terminal B. The other considerations likely included stalled negotiations with Fort Worth &amp; Western, Union Pacific, and DART, over securing right of way for TEXRail trains. The MOS included 2 new stations in Fort Worth, one in Grapevine, two at DFW Airport, and 3 potential stations in North Richland Hills and Haltom City. The three potential stations were conditional on either city joining the Trinity Metro service area, which requires imposing a half-cent sales tax to help fund the agency. North Richland Hills joined Trinity Metro in 2018, while Haltom City never did, as a result, two stations were built in North Richland Hills, and the Haltom City station was not. The MOS was completed, and TEXRail began service between downtown Fort Worth and DFW airport on January 10, 2019, with free rides until January 31, 2019 to &quot; give everyone an opportunity to ride&quot;.

On January 29, 2018, the transit agency&#x27;s board of directors voted to rebrand FWTA/The T as Trinity Metro, and revealed a new logo, that depicts three triangles forming the letter &quot;M&quot; in its negative spaces. The name change officially took place on March 23, 2018 on its website and social media presence.

Full member cities of Trinity Metro are required to levy a ¢ sales tax to pay for the system. Because the state of Texas caps the total sales tax for a municipality at 2¢, many municipalities are unable to join without reducing their sales tax revenue.

In lieu of full membership, Trinity Metro allows cities to gain service through interlocal agreements. For example, Grapevine and North Richland Hills made agreements in 2006 and 2016, respectively, to obtain stations on the then-planned TEXRail line.

==Services==
===Rail===
TEXRail, opened in 2018, is a hybrid rail service connecting downtown Fort Worth and DFW Airport. The train travels through northeast Tarrant County with four stops in Fort Worth, two stops in North Richland Hills and three stops (including at the airport) in Grapevine.

Trinity Railway Express, opened in 1996, is a commuter rail service connecting downtown Fort Worth and downtown Dallas. The train travels on a former Rock Island throughway with five stops in Fort Worth, two stops in Irving, and three stops in Dallas. The line is jointly operated with Dallas Area Rapid Transit; Trinity Metro manages the stations in Tarrant County (from T&amp;P Station to CentrePort/DFW Airport).

===Bus routes===
, Trinity Metro operates twenty-three regular bus routes, five Xpress/Limited routes, and two specialty services. The bus network travels throughout Fort Worth, with its main hub at Fort Worth Central Station. The system has three additional transfer locations and two park-and-rides.

Prior to Fort Worth Central&#x27;s opening in 2001, the main downtown transit hub centered around bus lines all converging along the Houston/Throckmorton corridor, with northbound service on Throckmorton Street and southbound service on Houston Street.
==== Trolley Routes ====
Trinity Metro currently operates two &quot;trolley routes&quot;, which are tourist-friendly routes with unique branding and liveries. (Despite the &quot;trolley&quot; designation, the routes do not use trolley-replica buses.)

* Molly the Trolley, introduced in 2009, loops around Downtown Fort Worth. It stops at major downtown destinations such as Sundance Square, the Fort Worth Convention Center, and the Fort Worth Water Gardens, as well as both downtown commuter rail stations. The route uses dark green buses and is free to ride.
* The Orange Line, introduced in 2024, connects Downtown Fort Worth to the Fort Worth Stockyards and the North Side TEXRail station.

From 2019 to 2024, Trinity Metro operated The Dash, a shuttle route which connected Fort Worth Central station to the Cultural District and Dickies Arena using red-colored electric buses. The route was discontinued due to low ridership and its proximity to an existing local route.

=== On-Demand ===
Launched in July 2019, On-Demand (formerly ZIPZONE) is a curb-to-curb microtransit service operated in partnership with Via Transportation. The service allows riders to book trips on-demand (using an app or phone number) so long as each trip starts and ends within specially designated zones. Travel between zones is not permitted, though some zones overlap. The service costs $1-3 per ride and is included with multi-ride passes.

Trinity Metro previously offered a separate curb-to-curb service in the Alliance neighborhood, which offered a complimentary Lyft ride through a promotional code. The service was replaced with a standard On-Demand zone on July 15, 2024.
=== Trinity Metro Bikes ===
Operated in association with Lyft Urban Solutions, Trinity Metro Bikes is a short-term bike rental service. Users check out electric bikes from docking stations across Fort Worth and ride them for the duration set according to pass purchased. This service is not included with any Trinity Metro tickets; bike-exclusive passes are available on the TM Bikes app.

=== VANPOOL ===
VANPOOL is a service which allows groups of five to fifteen people to collectively rent an SUV or van for travel to and from work, with prices varying based on the type of vehicle and distance traveled by each rider. Trinity Metro covers the cost of registration, insurance, fuel, and maintenance, though they do not cover tolls.

The service is open to riders in eleven counties: Dallas, Ellis, Erath, Hood, Johnson, Navarro, Palo Pinto, Parker, Somervell, Tarrant, and Wise. A similar service operated by DCTA operates in the rest of the Metroplex.

=== ACCESS Paratransit ===
ACCESS Paratransit (originally Mobility Impaired Transit Services, or MITS) is an ADA-compliant paratransit service for riders with disabilities that prevent them from using standard Trinity Metro services. The service allows eligible patrons to schedule curb-to-curb transportation to any location in Fort Worth or River Oaks.

==Labor relations==
From November 6, 2006 through November 11, 2006, around 100 of FWTA&#x27;s union workers went on strike, citing the agency&#x27;s policy regarding termination of employees who had used up their short-term disability benefits. This represented about a third of the workers represented by Teamsters Local 997. Service continued with delays the next morning by non-striking drivers, and FWTA began advertising for replacement drivers. During the dispute, bus rides on FWTA were free, and the agency announced that monthly pass holders will receive a 25% discount on their December passes. By Friday, replacement workers and other drivers willing to cross the picket lines had restored service to normal levels.

FWTA offered a new contract proposal late in the week, which was rejected on Saturday by a vote of 37 to 21. But because less than half of the 155 union members voted, a 2/3 majority of the vote was required to reject the contract. That would have required 39 of the 58 votes, so the contract was declared &quot;accepted&quot;.

Service on the Trinity Railway Express was not affected, as the rail line&#x27;s employees work under a different contract.

Nine years earlier, a four-day strike in 1997 shut down 75% of The T&#x27;s service.

<text>William McDonough (July 6, 1935 – January 9, 2003) was an American sportswriter for &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; who also worked as an on-air football reporter for CBS and NBC.

==Biography==

===Newspaper career===
The youngest of nine children of Irish immigrants, McDonough grew up in working-class South Boston. He attended The English High School, where he starred in baseball as a pitcher and in football as a quarterback. While attending the Northeastern University School of Journalism, McDonough started at the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; as a co-op intern / copy boy in 1955 to cover school sports, and he was hired by the &quot;Globe&quot; full-time after graduation in 1957.

In 1960, after McDonough had been promoted to sportswriter, he was assigned as the beat reporter for the Boston Patriots of the start-up American Football League and remained one of the country&#x27;s premier football reporters until his retirement in 2001. During his 40+ years writing career with the &quot;Globe&quot; (interrupted only by a brief departure in 1973), McDonough worked with other legendary Globe sportswriters such as Peter Gammons, Bob Ryan, and Leigh Montville. Beginning in 1993, he was named an associate editor of the &quot;Globe&quot;. Montville has said of McDonough: &quot;He was the scoop guy. He always said: &#x27;I can write better than anyone who can write faster, and I can write faster than anyone who can write better.&#x27;&quot;

McDonough became a hero among Boston sportswriters after a 1979 altercation with Patriots cornerback Raymond Clayborn, in which the 44-year-old McDonough leveled Clayborn in the locker room after the third-year cornerback had poked him in the eye. However, McDonough&#x27;s main fame was due to the number of &quot;scoops&quot; and exclusive stories that he broke while with the &quot;Globe&quot;. At the time of his death, NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue called him the &quot;most influential reporter covering the NFL.&quot;

===Controversy===
McDonough&#x27;s co-workers and supporters referred to him as &quot;Willie&quot; and credited his ability to get such stories to his ability to &quot;get anybody to the phone&quot; and to parlay nuggets of information from his calls into bigger stories. However, even &quot;Globe&quot; management admitted that he &quot;rewarded his friends and slammed his enemies&quot; in his columns. His critics, meanwhile, said that he only &quot;publishe[d] what&#x27;s going to reinforce his sources, his friends, his contacts&quot;, referring to him as &quot;a management stooge&quot; and &quot;Will the Shill&quot;.

Examples of this dichotomy marked his career. He regularly referred to superstar pitcher Roger Clemens as the &quot;Texas Con Man&quot; after Clemens&#x27; tenure with the Boston Red Sox; his bosses said that that was because he saw Clemens as a phony, potentially supported by later allegations of steroid use directed at Clemens, while others claimed that he was defending his friends John Harrington and Dan Duquette, who had stated that Clemens was in the &quot;twilight of his career&quot; in 1996—after which Clemens won four more Cy Young Awards as the best pitcher in the League (1997–98, 2001, 2004). McDonough also repeatedly referred to former Red Sox player Mo Vaughn as &quot;Mo Money&quot; after Vaughn turned down the Sox&#x27;s contract offer before the 1998 season to become a free agent after the season. He was accused of chauvinism when he questioned the presence of women in the locker room as well as the legitimacy of allegations by then &quot;Boston Herald&quot; sportswriter Lisa Olson against New England Patriots players in the team locker room in 1990; McDonough claimed he was vindicated two years later when other &quot;Globe&quot; sportswriters acknowledged the presence of holes in Olson&#x27;s credibility that were overlooked or ignored at the time, but others claimed that the &quot;Globe&quot;&#x27;s report showed that the overall atmosphere of sexual harassment was worse than Olson had alleged.

One of McDonough&#x27;s biggest scoops came during the week before Super Bowl XXXI when he broke the story that Patriots&#x27; head coach Bill Parcells, one of McDonough&#x27;s best friends, was planning to leave the Patriots after the Super Bowl and become head coach of the New York Jets. The story was 100% correct but still generated controversy because of the contention by McDonough&#x27;s detractors that Parcells&#x27; agent (who was also McDonough&#x27;s agent) had planted the story at that time to maximize his negotiating leverage.

===Broadcasting===
In addition to newspaper reporting, McDonough was a pioneer among journalists who became broadcasters in the late 1970s and early 1980s while maintaining their newspaper positions. He originally was hired by CBS, later moving to NBC. His appearances included stints as part of NBC&#x27;s &quot;NFL Live&quot; pregame show from 1991 to 1993. About his TV work, McDonough said, &quot;I proved once and for all you don&#x27;t have to be pretty to be on television.&quot; For one season, he also served as an analyst for New England Patriots preseason games. In 1994, NBC was paying him about $400,000 a year to appear on the network.

===Personal life===
McDonough was married twice, fathering three children (Sean, Erin and Terry) with his first wife Wilma and two (Ryan and Cara) with his second wife Denise. One of his three sons, Sean McDonough, is a sportscaster for ESPN and is also a Boston Red Sox announcer. Another son, Terry McDonough, was vice president, Player Personnel for the NFL&#x27;s Arizona Cardinals. His third son, Ryan McDonough, was the general manager of the Phoenix Suns. Each of the three has a championship ring in a different sport: Sean as an announcer for the 2004 Boston Red Sox (baseball); Terry as a scout for the 2000 Baltimore Ravens (football); and Ryan as a special assistant/video analyst for the 2008 Boston Celtics (basketball).

McDonough remained lifelong friends with two other prominent South Boston Irishmen: Massachusetts political leader William &quot;Billy&quot; Bulger and his older brother, Boston organized crime boss James &quot;Whitey&quot; Bulger. He served as campaign manager for Billy&#x27;s 1960 run for state representative, and he visited Whitey in Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary in the 1960s while the Boston Red Sox were in Kansas City. In return, in 1993 Billy successfully lobbied Cablevision to allow McDonough to provide commentary on the cable broadcast of the annual St. Patrick&#x27;s Day breakfast hosted by Billy.

===Death===
McDonough died of a heart attack at his home in Hingham on January 9, 2003, at age 67. According to an interview with his son Sean, McDonough had been suffering from heart problems and an autopsy determined that he had undiagnosed cardiac amyloidosis. A research fund to cure cardiac amyloidosis was set up in his memory at the Brigham and Women&#x27;s Hospital.

<text>London South Bank University (LSBU) is a public university in Elephant and Castle, London. It is based in the London Borough of Southwark, near the South Bank of the River Thames, from which it takes its name. Founded in 1892 as the Borough Polytechnic Institute, it achieved university status in 1992 under the Further and Higher Education Act 1992.

In September 2003, the university underwent its most recent name change to become London South Bank University (LSBU) and has since opened several new centres including the School of Health and Social Care, the Centre for Efficient and Renewable Energy in Buildings (CEREB), a new Student Centre, an Enterprise Centre, and a new media centre Elephant Studios. The university has students and 1,700 staff.

In November 2016, the university was named the Entrepreneurial University of the Year at the Times Higher Education Awards. In the inaugural 2017 Teaching Excellence Framework, London South Bank University was awarded a Silver rating and maintained the rating in the 2023 assessment.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
London South Bank University was founded in 1892 as the Borough Polytechnic Institute. It has since undergone several name changes, becoming the Polytechnic of the South Bank in 1970, South Bank Polytechnic in 1987, South Bank University in 1992 and London South Bank University in 2003. The university has also merged with a number of other educational institutions.

In 1888, Edric Bayley, a local solicitor and member of the London School Board, set up the South London Polytechnics Committee whose members included the Lord Mayor of London, Archbishop of Canterbury, Lord Salisbury, Lord Rosebery and Sir Lyon Playfair. The committee was successful in persuading the Charity Commissioners to pledge to match whatever could be raised from the public, up to the sum of £200,000 to establish polytechnics in South London. A public meeting at Mansion House kick-started the public appeal and by 1891 enough money had been raised to establish polytechnics at Battersea and at Borough Road, Southwark, now LSBU.

During 1890, the former buildings of Joseph Lancaster&#x27;s British and Foreign School Society were purchased for the Borough Polytechnic Institute. In May that year, the South London Polytechnics Institutes Act was passed, so that by June 1891 the governing structure and general aims of the new Institute had been created. These aims were &quot;the promotion of the industrial skills, general knowledge, health, and well-being of young men and women&quot; and also for &quot;instruction suitable for persons intending to emigrate&quot;. W. M. Richardson was chosen to be clerk to the governing body, C. T. Millis was appointed as Headmaster, Miss Helen Smith was appointed Lady Superintendent and Edric Bayley was appointed the first Chair of Governors.

On 30 September 1892, the Borough Polytechnic Institute was officially opened by Lord Rosebery, with a remit to educate the local community in a range of practical skills. The Polytechnic was given a seal based on the Bridge House emblem of the City of London and a motto taken from Ecclesiastes — &quot;Do it with thy Might&quot;. A gala event was held to mark the occasion which was widely reported in the press because of Lord Rosebery&#x27;s speech on the banning of smoking in the new Institute. One of the speeches made included the hope that &quot;the Polytechnic would do its share towards perfecting many a valuable gem found in the slums of London&quot;.

The Polytechnic specialised in courses that reflected local trades including leather tanning, typography, metalwork, electrical engineering, laundry, baking, and boot &amp; shoe manufacture. Instruction was also given in art, science, elocution, literature and general knowledge and the Polytechnic held public lectures by the likes of George Bernard Shaw, J. A. Hobson, Henry M. Stanley, and Ralph Vaughan Williams.

On 10 October 1894, the National School of Bakery and Confectionery (later the National Bakery School) was opened with 78 pupils. In 1897, the Polytechnic was let to sightseers who wished to see the Diamond Jubilee parade for Queen Victoria.

In 1902, the Borough Road building was once again let to sightseers who wished to see the Coronation parade of King Edward VII. Through a donation from Edric Bayley, the Edric Hall was built in 1908, along with the Lancaster Street extension buildings which gave the Polytechnic new bakery rooms, gymnasium, workshops and its triangular campus site.

In 1911, the Governors commissioned Roger Fry to create a set of seven murals to decorate the student dining room with the theme of &quot;London on Holiday&quot;. These comprised:
* &quot;Bathing&quot; and &quot;Football&quot;, Duncan Grant
*&quot;The Zoo&quot;, Roger Fry
* &quot;The Fair&quot;, Frederick Etchells
* &quot;Toy Sailing Boats&quot;, Bernard Adeney
* &quot;Punch &amp; Judy&quot;, MacDonald Gill
* &quot;Paddling&quot;, Albert Rutherston

In 1931, they were sold to the Tate Gallery.

During the First World War, the Polytechnic manufactured munitions and gas masks for the war effort and ran courses for the army. After the War, the National Certificate system was taken up, engineering courses were offered to women in the 1920s and printing classes were dropped and run at Morley College. J W Bispham was elected the new Principal in 1922 when C T Millis retired and a rebuilding scheme was undertaken including a new facade for the Borough Road building. Class numbers increased to 8,682 students by 1927 and on 20 February 1930 the Duke of York officially opened the Polytechnic&#x27;s new buildings. In 1933, Dr D H Ingall took over as Principal and a sports ground at Turney Road Dulwich was obtained for the Polytechnic. In 1933, farriery was dropped as it was too difficult to bring horses into the building.

During the Second World War, a third of the Polytechnic&#x27;s campus was destroyed or damaged from the Blitz. Southwark was bombed seven times and its population halved by the end of the War. At the start of the War the boys and girls from the Polytechnic&#x27;s Trade Schools were evacuated to Exeter. From 1940 to 1941, the Polytechnic was bombed five times but continued to provide hundreds of meals a day to the homeless of Southwark during this period.

From 1945 to 1953, British painter David Bomberg taught art at the Polytechnic forming the &#x27;Borough Group&#x27; of artists with his pupils in 1946. In 1956, the Polytechnic was designated a Regional College of Technology and Dr J E Garside was installed as the new Principal until 1965, when Vivian Pereira-Mendoza took over. Further extensions to the buildings were made during the 1960s with the opening of the National College Wing in 1961 and the extension buildings and Tower Block in 1969, which were officially opened by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.

In 1970, the Brixton School of Building (founded in 1904), the City of Westminster College (founded in 1918 – and not the same institution as the current City of Westminster College) and the National College of Heating, Ventilating, Refrigeration and Fan Engineering (founded in 1947) merged with the Polytechnic to become the Polytechnic of the South Bank. The new institution adopted a coat of arms designed to include two Thames barges set above a pentagon surrounded by five other pentagons. An official designation service took place the following year, at which Margaret Thatcher was the guest speaker. In 1972 the purpose-built Wandsworth Road site opened, providing space for the Polytechnic&#x27;s Faculty of the Built Environment, which at the time was the biggest and most comprehensive faculty in Europe for teaching built environment subjects such as surveying, town planning, architecture, civil engineering and other property related professional disciplines. In 1975, the extensive London Road building was opened, providing space for expanding business courses and the library. In 1976 the Battersea College of Education merged with the polytechnic, bringing sites at Manresa House, Roehampton and Manor House, Clapham Common. Battersea College of Education was previously known as Battersea College of Domestic Science (1948 to 1965). Also in 1976, part of Rachel MacMillan College of Education merged with the Polytechnic.

In 1985 South Bank Technopark opened on London Road and in 1987 the Polytechnic changed its name again to become South Bank Polytechnic. In the same year, the British Youth Opera (BYO) was founded and made a home at the Polytechnic&#x27;s Southwark campus. In 1987, Pauline Perry, Baroness Perry of Southwark was appointed Director, who oversaw the conversion of the Polytechnic into a flagship university.

In 1990, the Polytechnic was accredited for Research Degrees and in 1991 the Central Catering College at Waterloo and South West London College merged with it. In 1992, the newly created Baroness Perry (August 1991) became the University&#x27;s first Vice-Chancellor.

In 1992, the Polytechnic was granted university status and accordingly changed its name to South Bank University. That year also saw the new university celebrate its centenary and adopt the marketing slogan, &quot;the University without Ivory Towers&quot;. In 1993, Gerald Bernbaum was appointed Vice-Chancellor and the Centenary Library was renamed the Perry Library. Redwood College of Health Studies and Great Ormond Street School of Nursing merged with the university in 1995, leading to the establishment of two satellite campuses teaching Health at Havering and Whipps Cross (which closed in 2011).

=== 21st century ===
In 2001, Deian Hopkin became Vice-Chancellor and the Wandsworth Road site was sold.

On 1 September 2003, the university underwent its most recent name change to become London South Bank University (LSBU) and in that year officially opened the Keyworth Centre. Martin Earwicker was appointed Vice-Chancellor in 2009, the year in which another major building on their Southwark campus, the Grimshaw-designed K2, was opened to house the School of Health and Social Care and the Centre for Efficient and Renewable Energy in Buildings (CEREB). The building also houses skills laboratories for the University&#x27;s nursing students. Further campus developments included a new Student Centre in 2012, followed by an Enterprise Centre in 2013. In 2016 LSBU opened its new media centre, Elephant Studios at LSBU.

On 1 January 2014, Dave Phoenix was appointed Vice-Chancellor.

In 2014 university officials removed a poster featuring the Flying Spaghetti Monster and the stand erected by the students from the South Bank Atheist Society during the Fresher&#x27;s week, claiming it was &quot;religiously offensive&quot;. This action drew criticism from the British Humanist Association which claimed it amounted to &quot;petty censorship in the name of offence&quot;.

The LSBU-sponsored University Academy of Engineering South Bank opened its doors to students in September 2014. The purpose-built facility is in the Walworth area of Camberwell and can accommodate 150 students aged 11–19.

Lambeth College is intending to merge with the University.

== Campus ==

The main campus populates a triangular section of roads in the Borough of Southwark, immediately north of the Elephant and Castle. London&#x27;s South Bank is a short tube or bus journey away from Waterloo or London Bridge. To the north of the campus is Borough Road, where the main entrance is situated and the original building of the Borough Polytechnic Institute. To the west is London Road and to the east is Southwark Bridge Road. At the northwest corner is St George&#x27;s Circus.

Schiller International University had a campus in the Technopark Building on the London South Bank University property. In August 2011 Schiller stated that it was closing its London campus and will not start the Autumn 2011 semester there, due to stricter student visa requirements in the United Kingdom.

There is a smaller satellite campus in east London: at Havering (LSBU at Havering), diagonally opposite Harold Wood station. A central Croydon campus is due to open in September 2021: it will be at Electric House in Wellesley Road.

==Organisation==
The university has seven Schools, they are;
* School of Applied Sciences
* School of Arts and Creative Industries
* School of the Built Environment and Architecture
*School of Business
* School of Engineering
* School of Health and Social Care
* School of Law and Social Sciences

=== Contraction ===
The University announced in April 2021 that in 2021 they were not admitting students to study history or human geography.

==Academic profile==
The British painter David Bomberg taught Art at the Borough Polytechnic between 1945 and 1954. One of the university&#x27;s halls of residence, David Bomberg House, carries his name and a handful of his works are on display at the University. Major paintings by Bomberg were acquired by the Tate Gallery after his death.

London South Bank University works in partnership with institutions in the UK, Europe, Africa, the Americas and Asia. It currently works closely with the Beijing Institute of Technology, Hunan University, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Northwestern Polytechnical University, and the National Academy of Education Administration. The collaborative educational programmes both at undergraduate and postgraduate levels have been running for over ten years with the Chinese partners. LSBU established the first Confucius Institute for Traditional Chinese Medicine in 2007.

=== Rankings and reputation ===
In November 2016, the university was named the Entrepreneurial University of the Year at the Times Higher Education Awards.

&quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s 2018 league table of teaching excellence ranked the university 92 out of 121 British institutions. The Sunday Times&#x27; league table, measuring a number of different factors including teaching quality, research quality and employment rates, ranks the university 120th. However, &quot;The Guardian&quot; rated LSBU joint 13th for law students.

In the inaugural 2017 Teaching Excellence Framework assessment which ranked the quality of undergraduate teaching across UK universities and applied either a bronze, silver or gold ranking, LSBU was awarded a &quot;Silver&quot; ranking.

===Admissions===
70% of UK students at London South Bank University are Londoners. Students primarily come from the South London Boroughs of Southwark, Lambeth, Lewisham and Croydon, and the East London Borough of Newham. Around 12% of students are from overseas, which equate to over 3,000 EU and other international students, from more than 130 countries. 56% of the student population are from ethnic minorities and over 80% of the students are classified as mature (21 or over when they start their course).

<doc id="386189" wikidata="Q2036076" url="?curid=386189" title="Westfield Group">
<text>Westfield Group was an Australian shopping centre company that existed from 1960 to 2014, when it split into two independent companies: Scentre Group, which owns and operates the Australian and New Zealand Westfield shopping centre portfolio; and Westfield Corporation, which continued to own and operate the American and European centre portfolio.

Westfield Group undertook ownership, development, design, construction, funds/asset management, property management, leasing, and marketing activities. The multinational company was listed on the Australian Securities Exchange and had interests in and operated one of the world&#x27;s largest shopping centre portfolios with investment interests in 103 shopping centres across Australia, the United States, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Italy, France, Sweden, Austria, Germany, Croatia, Poland, Czech Republic and Brazil, encompassing around 23,000 retail outlets and total assets under management in excess of A$63 billion.

== History ==
The Westfield Group had origins in the western suburbs of Sydney. The first development was named &quot;Westfield Place&quot;, and opened in July 1959 in Blacktown. The name Westfield is derived from &quot;west&quot; related to the West Sydney location, and &quot;field&quot; due to having located on subdivided farmland. The centre was opened by John Saunders and Frank Lowy.

The company was floated on the Australian Securities Exchange in 1960 and built another five centres in New South Wales before expanding into Victoria and Queensland in 1966–67. For the first half of 1971, Westfield reported earnings of $886,382.

The expansion into the United States began with the purchase of the Trumbull Shopping Park in Connecticut in 1977, and was followed by three centres in California, Michigan and Connecticut in 1980 and three centres in California, New Jersey and Long Island, New York in 1986. In 1994 Westfield joined with General Growth and Whitehall Real Estate to purchase 19 centres for US$1 billion. Westfield seems to form clusters of centres on particular cities or within a small number of states. They built considerable holdings on the East Coast and in California before expanding into the Midwest. By 2005, the company owned centres in 15 US states.

In the 1990s, Westfield began a major expansion to New Zealand, where they mostly bought existing shopping centres of the Fletchers company, progressively rebranding them. Only in 2007, with Westfield Albany, did the company open a fully new centre in the country.

On 9 May 2006, Westfield announced the sale of eight United States shopping centres which it deemed to fit outside its strategic plan, to Centro Properties Group.

In April 2012 it was announced that the Westfield Group would sell seven non-core property assets to Starwood Capital Group for A$1 billion and one other property to an undisclosed buyer for A$147 million. The funds would be used to repay debt and invest in businesses offering higher return. The sales were expected to be completed by mid–2012.

In 2015, a group of terrorists wanted to blow up the Westfield London but they were stopped by police. They wanted the bombing to be around the same day as that of the 2005 London attacks anniversary.

==Operations==

Despite the Westfield Group&#x27;s asset dimensions, the Westfield Group was strongly controlled by the Lowy Family Group, including non-executive chairman, Frank Lowy, one of its founders. Lowy&#x27;s two younger sons, Steven and Peter, were joint managing directors.

===Australia===
Having been established in Australia, with their original premises being at Blacktown, the Westfield Group continued to operate a large number of shopping centres in Australia.

A feature of ticketless parking at Westfield Miranda, Westfield Hurstville, Westfield Bondi Junction and Westfield Doncaster was that SMS alerts were provided for when the shopper&#x27;s three free hours of parking were about to expire and when the shopper left the centres. This feature was removed in 2016 due to concerns that the system could be used to track the movements of others by giving the wrong car numberplate on registration of the phone number.

===United States===
Westfield entered the United States market in 1977. In September 2003 the company received $17.3 million as a party in the insurance claim following the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. On 18 February 2006, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that Westfield had agreed to acquire 15 stores from Federated Department Stores, all but three in southern California. On 9 May 2006, Westfield sold eight United States shopping centres to Centro Properties Group. As of 2024, Westfield owned 16 malls in the United States.

===New Zealand===
Westfield entered the New Zealand market in 1997 and acquired an interest in the St Lukes Group portfolio in 1998. Westfield malls became by far the most numerous chain in New Zealand, with six of its 12 centres in Auckland, including their largest development located in Albany. Westfield had NZ$2.8 billion in assets under management in New Zealand. In mid-2012, Westfield sold its 50% share of Westfield Shore City in Takapuna on Auckland&#x27;s North Shore, now known as Shore City Shopping Centre, and over the next five years sold, or divested itself of its interest in, six of the remaining stores. It now has five stores nationwide, four of them in Auckland.

===United Kingdom===
As of 2014, before Westfield Corporation was created, Westfield had an interest in two shopping centres in England and Northern Ireland.

By far its most significant asset was Westfield&#x27;s 50% partnership in the £1.6b Westfield London development in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, West London. The development included the construction of a new railway station for the London Overground and Southern services, and a new entrance for the London Underground station.

Westfield owned the Westfield Stratford City and also controlled the Stratford City redevelopment project next to 2012 Olympic park in Stratford in east London, having acquired the 75% of the project that it did not already own.

Westfield was the developer behind the troubled Broadway shopping development in Bradford after acquiring Stannifer in 2004.

On 9 October 2007 Westfield opened the £340m extension and refurbishment of Derby&#x27;s Eagle Centre, which saw the shopping centre rebranded Westfield Derby. The centre was subsequently sold to Intu in 2014.

Westfield were reviewing plans with the Whitgift Foundation to rebuild the Whitgift Centre in Croydon in South London.

== Relationship with tenants ==
The Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission investigated several disputes between the Westfield Group and its tenants. In 2004 the Commission found Westfield was abusing its market and commercial power in settling disputes with tenants, and forced Westfield to formally undertake to not engage in &quot;Unconscionable conduct and intimidation&quot; of tenants.

Also in Australia, Westfield fee structures and policies were criticised by retailers who operated in centres that had been taken over by the company. Retailers suggested that when centres were acquired there should be more cooperation between the new operators and existing tenants in bringing shops up to the corporate standards of the Westfield Group, and increases in rent (required to operate a shopping centre with high standards of fittings and services) should be staged with the required improvements in fittings.

===Relationship with competition===

In Liverpool, Australia in 2002, a competing shopping centre was lodged to Liverpool City Council and subsequently built. The centre would be about three kilometres from Westfield Liverpool.

<text>Nördlingen (; Swabian: &quot;Nearle&quot; or &quot;Nearleng&quot;) is a town in the Donau-Ries district, in Swabia, Bavaria, Germany, with a population of approximately 20,674. It is located approximately east of Stuttgart, and northwest of Munich. It was built in an impact crater 15 million years old and 25 km in diameter—the Nördlinger Ries—of a meteorite which hit with an estimated speed of 70,000 km/h, and left the area riddled with an estimated 72,000 tons of micro-diamonds.

Nördlingen was first mentioned in recorded history in 898. The town was the location of two battles during the Thirty Years&#x27; War, which took place between 1618 and 1648. Today it is one of very few towns in Germany that still have completely intact city walls—joining the ranks of Rothenburg ob der Tauber, Dinkelsbühl and Berching, all of them in Bavaria.

Another attraction in the town is Saint George&#x27;s Church&#x27;s steeple, called &quot;Daniel,&quot; which is made of a suevite impact breccia that contains shocked quartz. Other notable buildings are the town hall (which dates to the 13th century), St. Salvator church and the &quot;Spital&quot;, a former medieval hospital. The Ries crater museum is located in the well-preserved medieval tanners&#x27; quarter.

The city is home to several other museums, such as the Bavarian Railway Museum, the Nördlingen city museum (&quot;Stadtmuseum&quot;), the city wall museum (&quot;Stadtmauermuseum&quot;) and &quot;Augenblick&quot; museum. The latter has panoramas, magic lanterns, silent films, barrel organs, pianolas, music boxes and gramophones.

Nördlingen is also known for the &quot;Scharlachrennen&quot; (Scarlet Race), a horse race tournament that was first mentioned in 1463. Since World War II, it has expanded to include eventing, jumping and dressage.

==History==

===Prehistory and Celtic period===

Finds in the Ofnet Caves near the city show that the site of present-day Nördlingen was already inhabited in the late Palaeolithic. In the Large Ofnet, in 1908 archaeologist R. R. Schmidt found two dish-shaped pits in which human skulls were lying &quot;like eggs in flat baskets&quot;. In the larger pit were 27 skulls and in the other there were 6 skulls. The skulls were arranged concentrically with their faces turned towards the setting sun. They were all covered with a thick layer of red ochre. The skulls have been dated to the 7th millennium BC. In the area around Nördlingen, additional sites dating to almost all of the subsequent prehistoric epochs have been discovered. Particularly important was an area on the eastern edge of the district Baldingen, where settlements have been found belonging to the Neolithic Linear Pottery culture, the Bronze Age Urnfield culture, and the Celtic Iron Age Hallstatt and La Tène cultures.

===Roman Empire===
The area which includes present-day Nördlingen was part of the Roman province of Raetia, but little research has been conducted on the city&#x27;s Roman period. A Roman villa has been excavated in the district of Holheim, and can be visited today. Another villa with an adjoining burial ground has been identified in the Baldingen district. A settlement (&quot;vicus&quot;), built in 85 C.E., occupied the southern part of the city until 259–260 C.E., when it was destroyed during the conquest of what is now southern Germany by the Germanic-speaking Alemanni tribes. The Roman settlement may have been the one known as Septemiacum, which is supposed to have been built between 80–300 C.E., although it is possible that this particular settlement was actually located at a different site such as Oberdorf, leaving the name of the settlement at Nördlingen uncertain.

===Middle Ages===
The Alemannic people occupied the Nördlingen area during the 6th and 7th centuries, during which time the region was gradually Christianized under the Merovingian dynasty, and several burial grounds from this period have been discovered. The name &quot;Nordilinga&quot; is first found in documents of the Carolingian royal court dating from 898, and the city today celebrates this as the date of its &quot;foundation&quot;. Under the rule of the Bishops of Regensburg, Nördlingen grew into an important market town.

In 1215, Nördlingen was granted city rights by Emperor Frederick II and became imperial city of the Holy Roman Empire. In that year, the first city wall was built, the footprint of which is still visible today. In a document dating to 1219, the &quot;Nördlinger Pfingstmesse&quot; (&quot;Nördlingen Pentecost fair&quot;) was first mentioned, an event which continues as a folk festival in the city to the present day. Thanks to Nördlingen&#x27;s location at the crossroads of two major trade routes (Frankfurt / Würzburg-Augsburg and Nuremberg-Ulm), it became an important trading center for grain, livestock, textiles, furs, and metal goods. Besides Frankfurt am Main, Nördlingen was one of the most important long-distance trade fairs in the region.

In 1238, a fire destroyed much of Nördlingen, but the city quickly recovered. Three generations later, a large number of craftsmen, especially tanners and weavers, settled outside the city walls. In 1327 the present-day circular wall was built, which increased the size of the walled portion of the city fourfold. 1427 saw the start of construction on St. George&#x27;s Church.

In the year 1472 the court case against the brothel owners Linhardt Freiermuth and his wife Barbara Taschenfeind is recorded in the city&#x27;s court records. The starting point of the trial was the charge of forced abortion on the prostitute Els von Eystett. The court convicted the owners and banished the husband from the city. His wife was branded on the forehead and pilloried. The associated 40 parchment pages in the Nördlingen city archives give unique insight into the conditions of a brothel in this time period.

===Early modern period===
In 1529, the city was part of the Protestation at Speyer, which sought to allow the unimpeded spread of the Protestant Reformation. In 1555, the Reformation in Nördlingen was finally completed. In 1579, Mayor Peter Seng (1512–1589) signed the Lutheran Formula of Concord.

The witch trials in the early modern period in Nördlingen have been well documented. Between 1589 and 1598, 34 women and one man were burned at the stake for the crime of witchcraft, and one co-defendant midwife, Barbara Lierheimer, died while in custody. The trials of Maria Holl and Rebecca Lemp became especially well-known. In 1589, Pastor Wilhelm Friedrich Lutz delivered sermons against the radical witch persecution of Nördlingen City Council, prior to the Council&#x27;s execution of the first alleged witches in May 1590. One of the three women executed in that year was a carter&#x27;s daughter, Ursula Haider, who was arrested on 8 November 1589 and burned on 15 May 1590. The trial of Ursula Haider was by described by Ulrike Haß in her book &quot;Teufelstanz&quot;.

It is often said that in 1604 a shortened and simplified version of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; was performed in Nördlingen and that this was one of the first performances of any Shakespearean play outside England. In fact, the players applied to perform but were denied by the local authorities and were compensated for their efforts.

Nördlingen served as the site of two historic battles, and marked a turning point in the Thirty Years&#x27; War. In the first Battle of Nördlingen in 1634, the Swedish Protestant forces were decisively defeated for the first time by the imperial Habsburg troops. The city was compelled to open its gates to the victors, but was not plundered by the victorious troops after high reparations payments. However, during and after the siege, the city lost more than half of its population due to hunger and illness. This was exacerbated by the second Battle of Nördlingen in 1645, and it would not be until 1939 that Nördlingen regained the population it had in 1618. In the early 18th century, during the War of the Spanish Succession, the city was further affected by the impact of nearby battles of Höchstädt. The wars forced trade to shift to the seaports, and as a result, Nördlingen lost its importance as a trading center. In part due to this forced economic standstill, Nördlingen&#x27;s medieval cityscape remained well preserved.

As a result of the German mediatization, in 1803 Nördlingen lost its status as an imperial city and became part of the Electorate of Bavaria, which had occupied the city in September 1802 in anticipation of the decree. On January 1, 1806, Bavaria&#x27;s Elector declared himself king, officially changing the Electorate of Bavaria into the Kingdom of Bavaria, which seceded from the Holy Roman Empire the following August.

===Modern period===

On May 15, 1849, Nördlingen was connected to the network of the Royal Bavarian State Railways. In that same year, the first rail lines opened to Nuremberg. A third railway connection, under the leadership of the Royal Württemberg State Railways, was opened on 3 October 1863 to Aalen.

During the Second World War, a total of 33 people were killed in and around Nördlingen by air raids conducted in the spring of 1945. The train station and several houses were destroyed, and St. George&#x27;s Church was severely damaged. However, most of the historic district of the city was spared. In 1945, Nördlingen became part of the American occupation zone of Allied-occupied Germany. The United States military set up a displaced persons camp in the city. It was overseen by UNRRA and housed approximately 500 DPs, mostly from Latvia and Lithuania. More than 4,500 people settled permanently in Nördlingen after the war.

Since the Middle Ages, Jewish families have resided in Nördlingen. They buried their dead in the Jewish cemetery on Nähermemminger Way, and a synagogue was built in 1885. The synagogue was destroyed by the Nazis during the November pogrom of 1938, and this is commemorated by a plaque on today&#x27;s Protestant parish hall. In 1979, a memorial stone was erected in the Jewish cemetery commemorating Jewish victims of the Holocaust.

In the course of the municipal reorganization of Bavaria, Nördlingen lost its status as a city on July 1, 1972 and was incorporated into the newly formed district Nördlingen-Donauwörth, which received its current name, Donau-Ries, on May 1, 1973.

==Economy==
Important companies in Nördlingen are:
* C.H. Beck – book publisher
* Varta – battery manufacturer
* Maierbier – brewery

Nördlingen has a station on the Augsburg–Nördlingen railway and the Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt–Nördlingen railway, which are served hourly on weekdays.

==Sport==
The local sports club, the TSV 1861 Nördlingen, has a very successful basketball department with the men&#x27;s and the women&#x27;s team both in the Basketball Bundesliga. The clubs football team is traditionally the strongest side in northern Swabia. Its most successful former player is Gerd Müller, who was born and raised in Nördlingen. Its stadium was renamed in his honour in 2008.

==Impact diamonds==
Stone buildings in the town contain millions of tiny diamonds, all less than across. The meteorite impact—from a asteroid—that caused the Nördlinger Ries crater created an estimated 72,000 tons of these tiny diamonds when it impacted a local graphite deposit. Stone from this area was later quarried and used to build the stone buildings.


==In popular culture==

Aerial scenes at the end of &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot; from 1971 were filmed here.

The main setting of &quot;Princess Tutu&quot; is based on Nördlingen. Nördlingen bears resemblance to the town of Shiganshina from &quot;Attack on Titan&quot;

<text>The FIFA World Player of the Year was an association football award presented annually by the sport&#x27;s governing body, FIFA, between 1991 and 2015 at the FIFA World Player Gala. Coaches and captains of international teams and media representatives selected the player they deem to have performed the best in the previous calendar year.

Originally a single award for the world&#x27;s best men&#x27;s player, parallel awards for men and women were awarded from 2001 to 2009. The men&#x27;s award was subsumed into the FIFA Ballon d&#x27;Or in 2010 while the women&#x27;s award remained until 2015. After 2015 both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s awards became part of The Best FIFA Football Awards.

During the men&#x27;s era, Brazilian players won 8 out of 19 years, compared to three wins – the second most – for French players. In terms of individual players, Brazil again led with five, followed by Italy and Portugal with two each. The youngest winner was Ronaldo, who won at 20 years old in 1996, and the oldest winner was Fabio Cannavaro, who won aged 33 in 2006. Ronaldo and Zinedine Zidane each won the award three times, while Ronaldo and Ronaldinho were the only players to win in successive years. From 2010 to 2015, the equivalent men&#x27;s award was the FIFA Ballon d&#x27;Or, following a merging of the FIFA World Player of the Year and the France Football Ballon d&#x27;Or awards. Since 2016, the awards have been replaced by The Best FIFA Men&#x27;s Player and The Best FIFA Women&#x27;s Player awards.

Eight women&#x27;s footballers – three Germans, three Americans, one Brazilian, and one Japanese – have won the award. Marta, the youngest recipient at age 20 in 2006, has won five successive awards, the most of any player. Birgit Prinz won three times in a row and Mia Hamm won twice in a row. The oldest winner is Nadine Angerer, who was 35 when she won in 2013; she is also the only goalkeeper of either sex to win.

==Voting and selection process==
The winners are chosen by the coaches and captains of national teams as well as by international media representatives invited by FIFA. In a voting system based on positional voting, each voter is allotted three votes, worth five points, three points and one point, and the three finalists are ordered based on total number of points. Following criticism from some sections of the media over nominations in previous years, FIFA has since 2004 provided shortlists from which its voters can select their choices.

==FIFA World Player of the Year==

From 2010 to 2015, the award was merged with the Ballon d&#x27;Or to become the FIFA Ballon d&#x27;Or in a six-year partnership with &quot;France Football&quot;. In 2016, FIFA rebranded the award as The Best FIFA Men&#x27;s Player.

A single article from the Portuguese magazine &quot;A Bola&quot; reporting about the 1992 award mentions the former award winners Lothar Matthäus in 1991, but also Diego Maradona in 1990. There is no other evidence of the award being presented by FIFA prior to 1991.

<doc id="386209" wikidata="Q724752" url="?curid=386209" title="Roberto Assagioli">
<text>Roberto Assagioli (27 February 1888 – 23 August 1974) was an Italian psychiatrist and pioneer in the fields of humanistic and transpersonal psychology. Assagioli founded the psychological movement known as psychosynthesis, which is still being developed today by therapists and psychologists who practice the psychological methods and techniques he developed.

His published work in English includes four books and many monographs published as pamphlets as well as numerous lectures and papers in Italian that remain unpublished but which are being translated into English and posted online. His approach to psychosynthesis emphasized the possibility of progressive integration (that is, synthesis) of the personality, as well as the integration of the personality with the Higher Self from which it is derived.

“Psychosynthesis is a &quot;dynamic&quot; conception of psychic life as a struggle between a multiplicity of disparate, often conflicting forces, and a unifying Center that aims to master and harmoniously organize them.”

In addition, Assagioli’s work has been shown to be effectively applicable in such fields as psychotherapy and treatment, medicine, education, organizational development, community development, spiritual life, and personal self-improvement.

Author Piero Ferrucci has said, “As far as I know, Roberto Assagioli is the only individual who has participated personally and actively in the unfurling of two distinct and fundamental revolutions in twentieth-century psychology.The first revolution was the birth of psychoanalysis and depth psychology in the beginning of the century: Assagioli, then a young medical student, presented his MD dissertation on psychoanalysis, wrote in the official &quot;Jahrbuch&quot; side by side with Freud and Jung, and was part of the Zurich Freud Society, the group of early psychoanalytical pioneers. The idea of unconscious processes in the mind made a lasting impression on him, an impression which he later developed into a variety of hypotheses well beyond the boundaries of orthodox psychoanalysis. The second revolution in which Assagioli participated was the creation of humanistic and transpersonal psychology in the 1960’s. A. H. Maslow was the pioneer of these new developments. The main idea was simple: rather than focusing on pathology in order to define the human being (as psychoanalysis had all too often done), or on the structural similarities between the human and the animal nervous system (as behaviorism suggested), the humanistic and transpersonal point of view, while not denying the findings of the other schools, put the main emphasis on the organism’s striving for wholeness, on the human being’s potential for growth, expansion of consciousness, health, love and joy.”

== Life ==
Assagioli was born on 27 February 1888 in Venice, Italy, from a middle-class, Jewish background. He was born Roberto Marco Grego, the son of Elena Kaula and Leone Greco. However, his biological father died when Assagioli was two years old, and his mother remarried to Dr. Alessandro Emanuele Assagioli soon afterward. Assagioli was exposed to many creative outlets at a young age, such as art and music, which were believed to have inspired his work in Psychosynthesis. He was born with a clubfoot which his step-father straightened without surgery. He was very physically active in his youth, particularly in mountain climbing, swimming and rowing.

He grew up speaking Italian, French and English, which were spoken on alternate days in his home. By the age of 18, he had learned eight different languages, including his native Italian, English, French, Russian, Greek, Latin, German, and Sanskrit. It was at this age that he began to travel, mainly to other parts of Italy as well as England, France, Switzerland and Germany. He also had what he called “an adventure” in traveling for a short time in Russia, where he was exposed to Russian psychology and learned of the very unstable social situation there.

The Assagioli family moved from Venice to Florence in 1904 in order for Roberto to enroll in the Institute of Higher Studies, which became years later a division of the University of Florence. As a young man Assagioli read voraciously and decided on a career in neurology and psychiatry, and the Institute was well equipped for such studies, having a psychology laboratory and museum even though there was no formal curriculum in “psychology.” Assagioli chose psychoanalysis for the subject of his doctoral thesis and persuaded his professors to allow this even though this topic was virtually unknown in Italy at the time.

He took his medical degree in 1910. He was considered by Freud and Jung to be among the first advocates of psychoanalysis in Italy, however he criticized aspects of it in his dissertation and later disavowed specific theories that Freud had while continuing to appreciate and use the &quot;methods&quot; of psychoanalysis. During and after his education in Florence he studied for two years at the Burghölzli Clinic in Zurich under Eugen Bleuler, and while there he met C.G. Jung, with whom he began a cordial friendship that lasted 50 years. He also attended psychoanalytic conferences in Germany and Switzerland and was a member of Freudian Society of Zurich. He submitted essays (in German) to two journals of Freudian psychoanalysis, &quot;Zentralblatt für Psychoanalyse&quot; and &quot;Jahrbuch far psychoanalytische und psycbopathologische Forschung.&quot; However by 1911 he had already seen the limitations of Freudian theory and began to distance himself from it, three years before Jung formally broke with Freud.

Also during his early years in Florence he established a friendship with Giovanni Papini and was an active contributor to Papini’s magazine &quot;Leonardo&quot; until the magazine closed in 1907. His readings during this time included studies of Eastern philosophy and religion, especially the Bhagavad-Gita, which he considered wonderful.

Assagioli was actively connected to the theosophical movement from this time, and was probably influenced by it earlier, since his mother had an interest in it. Roberto’s connection was to ripen into a more direct involvement later in his life. He also developed a friendship with Guiseppe Prezzolini, with whom he became involved as a contributor to the magazine &quot;La Voce.&quot; 

Shortly after his graduation from medical school Assagioli founded a “magazine of psychological studies” called &quot;Psiche,&quot; of which he was editor and a major contributor. This work came to a close with the advent of World War I. Assagioli was drafted into the Italian army and served as a medical lieutenant at the Austrian front. Because of his physical disabilities (he had flat feet and had to wear a brace) he was exempted from “front line service” and served in the rear. Little is known about his activities at this time because he never spoke of his war experience. It is likely that he was present at two major operations of this part of the war: the Battle of Caporetto, a major defeat for the Italians, and the Battle of Vittorio Veneto, which was an Allied victory and contributed to the end of the war. We do know that Assagioli did not carry a weapon, and crafted a “replica” of either soap or wood and carried it in a holster to appear to conform to military requirements.

When the war was over, Assagioli married. However, the marriage turned out to be a poor match for both, as they lived in different social and spiritual worlds, and ended in divorce. In his autobiographical reflections years later, he noted that his first wife re-married to an army officer and that marriage worked well for her.

In 1922, he married a young woman named Nella Ciapetti, who was a Roman Catholic but also shared an interest in theosophy with Assagioli. She owned a villa with surrounding land in Capolona, where the family would spend their summers for decades. Nella was an industrious and competent person who managed the family business, which included orchards and wine making. They had one son, Ilario Assagioli, who was born in 1923.

In 1926 the Assagioli family moved to Rome. At this time both Roberto and Nella had been writing articles for the theosophical magazine &quot;Ultra&quot;, and Roberto had become connected with the Arcane School of Alice Bailey, which was an offshoot of the theosophical movement. In the 1920’s Assagioli began to crystallize his psychological ideas, which had roots as far back as 1909 with his work in psychoanalysis and “psychagogy,” which he had adopted from a concept of Plato’s that combined theory and practice with a focus on healthy people rather than on pathology.

Also in 1926 he founded The &quot;Institute of Culture and Psychic Therapy&quot; in Rome, which had a program envisaged in his earlier writings on psychagogy, and it was supported by some influential people. In the following year he published &quot;A New Method of Healing: Psychosynthesis,&quot; which was the first public mention of the psychological approach with which he would thereafter be identified. In 1933 the Institute’s name was changed to &quot;Institute of Psychosynthesis,&quot; which it has retained to the present. At the Institute in the 1930s Assagioli presented a series of lectures of psychosynthesis and other topics, published many papers concerned with psychological issues and began outreach to establish interactions with other related disciplines.

Meanwhile, Italy had been ruled since 1922 by Benito Mussolini and his Fascist government. Assagioli&#x27;s activities were largely ignored by the government until the mid-1930s when it began to take notice of Assagioli’s international contacts and what it viewed as suspicious “humanitarian and spiritual activities.” Assagioli’s Institute was closed in 1938, at the same time that Germany was actively beginning to persecute Jews and Italy became more closely tied to Germany.

In 1940, Assagioli was arrested and imprisoned by Benito Mussolini&#x27;s Fascist government, having been accused of &quot;praying for peace and inviting others to join him along with other international crimes.&quot; He was placed in a solitary cell in Regina Coeli prison for 27 nights, until he was released and returned to his family. He was able to use his prison experience as an extended spiritual exercise that was ultimately one of the most significant events of his life. His notes from during and after his imprisonment were later collected and translated in the brief book &quot;Freedom in Jail.&quot; Among those notes is this observation:

&quot;I realized that I was &quot;free to take&quot; one attitude or another towards the situation, &quot;to give&quot; it one value or another, to utilize it or not in one or another way . . .I could rebel inwardly or curse; or I could submit passively, vegetating; or I could indulge in the unwholesome pleasure of self-pity and assume the martyr’s role; or I could take the situation in a sporting way and with a sense of humor, considering it as a novel and interesting experience (what the Germans call an &quot;erlebnis&quot;)[an experience]. I could make it a rest cure; or a period of intense thinking either about personal matters, reviewing my past life and pondering on it, or about scientific and philosophical problems; or I could take advantage of the condition in order to submit myself to a definite training of my psychological faculties and make psychological experiments on myself; or finally as a spiritual retreat . . . I had the clear sure perception that this was entirely my own affair; that I was &quot;free to choose&quot; any or several of these attitudes and activities; that this choice would have definite and unavoidable effects which I could foresee, and for which I was fully &quot;responsible&quot;. There was no doubt in my mind about this essential &quot;freedom&quot; and &quot;power&quot; and their inherent privileges and responsibilities. A responsibility towards myself, towards my fellow mankind and towards life itself or God.&quot;

During World War II, his family&#x27;s farm in Capolona, Italy was bombed, and after the Nazis began direct control of northern Italy and began rounding up all Jews, both he and his son went into hiding in the Catenaia Alps (in the province of Arezzo) and in the Upper Tiber Valley. He was sheltered by various farmers and local people and helped by British paratroopers working behind enemy lines. His son Ilario, who had tuberculosis, died in 1952 at the age of 28 as his disease was probably aggravated by the severe stress from the harsh living conditions during the war.

After the war ended, Assagioli returned to his work as a psychiatrist and psychotherapist, deciding to take up residence at a villa in Florence, which became both the Assagioli home and the headquarters of the Psychosynthesis Institute. The years after the war were relatively calm, and it was during this time that he founded various foundations dedicated to Psychosynthesis in Europe and North America, including the Psychosynthesis Research Foundation in the United States. He also began to gather students in Italy and encouraged the opening of psychosynthesis centers at various locations around the country.

Assagioli lived a long and prosperous life, marked by a wide range of human contacts with people on every continent, and he kept himself informed and abreast of the new developments in psychology for the rest of his life. In this regard he played an active part, being on the original editorial boards of both the Journal of Humanistic Psychology and the Journal of Transpersonal Psychology. In fact, the American Psychological Association’s Division of Psychotherapy voted and intended to name Assagioli for its 1970 award in its Great Therapists series, but because Assagioli was unable to travel to America to receive the award, it was presented to Erich Fromm.

According to author and Assagioli&#x27;s personal student Piero Ferrucci, &quot;“Richness in contacts and interchanges was quite important in Assagioli’s background: consider such diverse acquaintances (some of them brief, others lasting) as Italian idealist Benedetto Croce, Russian esotericist P. D. Ouspensky, German philosopher Hermann Keyserling, Indian poet Rabindranath Tagore, Sufi mystic Inhayat Khan, Zen Scholar D. T. Suzuki, Tibet’s explorer Alexandra David Neel, plus psychologists Viktor Frankl, the founder of logotherapy, Robert Desoille, creator of the guided daydream, and C. G. Jung himself, before and after his break with psychoanalysis. Such contacts, coupled with a life of experimentation and reflection, provided an undoubtedly wide perspective for Assagioli’s creation, which he called Psychosynthesis.” 

Assagioli lived with his wife Nella at the villa in Florence, spending their summers in Capolona, for the remainder of their lives. Nella died in 1973, and Roberto died at age 86 on 23 August 1974.

Assagioli did not like to discuss his personal life, as he preferred to be remembered for his work. Very few biographical accounts about the life of Assagioli are available, and most are not in English. He did consent to dictate an autobiography to American Dr. Eugene Smith toward the end of his life, thinking that there may be some value to students in some of the events of his life, however he died shortly after the first interviews were completed. The recordings thus made were compiled, edited and printed as &quot;Roberto Assagioli In His Own Words&quot; in 2019. Also a major non-technical biography, &quot;Roberto Assagioli: The Life and Work of the Founder of Psychosynthesis&quot; by Paola Giovetti, published in Italian in 1995, was translated into English and published in 2024.

== Psychosynthesis ==
=== Inspiration and development ===
Assagioli is famous for founding and developing psychosynthesis, a spiritual and holistic approach to psychology that evolved from psychoanalysis. He was inspired by Freud&#x27;s ideas of the unconscious and Jung&#x27;s theories of the collective unconscious, however the concepts in psychosynthesis will be seen to be analogous to those found in the Christian mystics, Vedanta philosophy and yoga, sufism and a wide range of other thought in philosophy and practical psychology. One of his primary influences was that of American psychologist and philosopher William James.

Trained in psychoanalysis but unsatisfied by what he regarded as its incompleteness as a whole, Assagioli felt that love, wisdom, creativity, and will were among the important components of the personality that were not included in psychoanalysis. Assagioli&#x27;s earliest development of what became Psychosynthesis started in 1906, when he began his formal education in psychology. He continued his work on Psychosynthesis right up until his death. Freud and Assagioli were known to have corresponded, although they never had the chance to meet.

Assagioli said, &quot;Psychosynthesis presupposes psychoanalysis, or rather, includes it as a first and necessary stage.&quot; However, Assagioli disagreed with specific theories formulated by Sigmund Freud that he considered limiting. He refused to accept Freud&#x27;s materialism, reductionism and neglect of the positive dimensions of the personality. Psychosynthesis became the first approach born of psychoanalysis that also included the artistic, altruistic and heroic potentials of the human being. Assagioli&#x27;s work was more in alignment with that of fellow psychoanalytic &quot;heretic&quot; Carl Jung, with whom he had a cordial relationship that began in 1906 and lasted until Jung’s death. Both Assagioli and Jung validated the importance of the spiritual level of human existence. Assagioli shared with Jung the insight that psychological symptoms can be triggered by spiritual dynamics. Assagioli considered Jung&#x27;s theories to be closest to his understanding of psychosynthesis.
Assagioli drew inspiration for psychosynthesis from his month-long incarceration in solitary confinement in 1940. He used his time in prison to exercise his mental will by meditating daily. He concluded that he was able to change his punishment into an opportunity to investigate his inner-self.

Assagioli developed psychosynthesis from his early ideas of “psychagogy,” a concept which he borrowed from Plato, to indicate a discipline that was both theoretical and practical. He wrote on the subject of “The Psychology of Idea-Forces and Psychagogy” in the &quot;Journal of Applied Psychology&quot; in 1909, and developed his thought until “Psychosynthesis” was publicly introduced in his 1927 pamphlet, “A New Method of Healing: Psychosynthesis.” This broad discipline became the core of his work in psychology for the rest of his life. He founded psychosynthesis teaching and training centers in Rome, Florence, and supported the establishment of such centers in Europe, North America, and elsewhere.

=== &quot;Psychology Today&quot; interview ===
In the December 1974 issue of &quot;Psychology Today&quot;, Assagioli was interviewed by Sam Keen, in which Assagioli discussed the differences between Freudian psychoanalysis and psychosynthesis:
Assagioli noted that Carl Jung, &quot;of all modern psychotherapists, is the closest in theory and practice to psychosynthesis&quot;, and further expanded on the similarities between his own and Jung&#x27;s views:

He also highlighted the differences between Jung&#x27;s work and psychosynthesis:

Assagioli asserted about the will:
At the end of the interview, Keen himself concluded:
== Spiritual Work and Parapsychology ==

Assagioli was also interested and active in the field of consciousness and transpersonal work. Having studied theosophy and Eastern philosophy, his written work developed different meditation techniques, including reflective, receptive and creative meditation. He wrote on a variety of spiritual topics for several periodicals, including the &quot;Hibbert Journal&quot;, &quot;The Beacon&quot;, &quot;Ultra&quot; (An Italian periodical devoted to theosophy), &quot;Medicina Psicosomatica (Psychosomatic Medicine),&quot; and the &quot;Journal of Transpersonal Psychology,&quot; of which he was a member of the original editorial board. He also contributed to several spiritual groups in the tradition known as the &quot;ageless wisdom.&quot;

He founded two groups intended to teach meditation based on the ideas of the New Age teacher Alice Bailey: The Group for Creative Meditation and the Meditation Group for the New Age, for which he wrote essays and a basic teaching/training manual. He was also a co-founder of the School for Esoteric Studies, intended to teach the work of Alice Bailey at an advanced level. He was the direct inspiration for the founding of at least two meditation centers: Sundial House in the UK, and Meditation Mount in California, USA.

Assagioli maintained a lifelong interest in paranormal phenomena and parapsychology, some of which he regarded as having been sufficiently demonstrated — as &quot;psychological facts —&quot; so as to be regarded as legitimate subjects for scientific study. He wrote numerous essays on such phenomena, many of which he investigated personally, beginning with the then-famous case of the “thinking horses of Elberfeld,” which he witnessed during a trip to Germany in 1913 and about which he published a series of articles in the magazine &quot;Psiche.&quot; Assagioli regarded his own work as genuinely scientific and began writing on scientific activity along his critique of modern reductionist, materialist science with an essay (in Italian) titled “&quot;Gli Errori Degli Scienziati&quot;” or “The Errors of Scientists,&quot; published in &quot;Psiche&quot; in July–August 1913. In this article he advocated the need for clear thought and appropriate conceptions in theory and practice. In 1961 he wrote several essays and gave a talk on “parapsychological faculties” in which he asserts that “Parapsychological faculties are generally regarded as something exceptional, extraordinary and marvelous, but this does not correspond to the truth, and I aim precisely to highlight their universality and normality.” An e-Book has been published that contains a collection of Assagioli’s thought in this area, titled &quot;Psychosynthesis and Parapsychology.&quot;

During this period Assagioli also became active in progressive Judaism. He had never been the member of a synagogue or associated with orthodox organizations, although he had a personal relationship with Martin Buber and other prominent members of the Jewish community and was welcomed in synagogues when he visited them in Italy or other countries. He delivered several talks and wrote papers concerning the role of the Jews in the world and his home was the headquarters of the Italian Union for Progressive Judaism. He was quite enthusiastic about the possibilities for Judaism being a catalyst for world peace, and was opposed to any kind of militant or nationalistic Zionism.

<text>National City Lines, Inc. (NCL) was a public transportation company. The company grew out of the Fitzgerald brothers&#x27; bus operations, founded in Minnesota, United States, in 1920 as a modest local transport company operating two buses. Part of the Fitzgerald&#x27;s operations were reorganized into a holding company in 1936, and later expanded about 1938 with equity funding from General Motors, Firestone Tire, Standard Oil of California and Phillips Petroleum for the express purpose of acquiring local transit systems throughout the United States in what became known as the General Motors streetcar conspiracy. The company formed a subsidiary, Pacific City Lines in 1937 to purchase streetcar systems in the western United States. National City Lines, and Pacific City Lines were indicted in 1947 on charges of conspiring to acquire control of a number of transit companies, and of forming a transportation monopoly for the purpose of &quot;conspiring to monopolize sales of buses and supplies to companies owned by National City Lines.&quot; They were acquitted on the first charge and convicted on the second in 1949.

==History==
The company has roots back to 1920, when E. Roy Fitzgerald and his brother began operating two buses in Minnesota, transporting miners and schoolchildren. In 1936 the company was organized into a holding company. In 1938, National City Lines wished to purchase transportation systems in cities &quot;where street cars were no longer practicable&quot; and replace them with passenger buses. To fund this expansion the company obtained equity funding from companies seeking to increase sales of commercial buses and supplies, including General Motors, Firestone Tire, Standard Oil of California and Phillips Petroleum.

In 1936, they bought 13 transit companies in Illinois, Oklahoma and Michigan, then in 1937, they replaced streetcars in Butte, Montana and made purchases in Mississippi and Texas. Sometimes these systems were already run down, but not always. Major investment had recently been made with improvements to the streetcars systems in Beaumont, Texas. The Butte system, while sound, deliberately replaced to lower the load on the overtaxed electric system, which was primarily used for commercial uses, including electrolytic refining of copper and zinc.

In 1938 the company entered into exclusive dealing arrangements and obtained equity funding from companies seeking to increase sales of commercial buses and supplies, including General Motors, Firestone Tire, Standard Oil of California and Phillips Petroleum. The company was indicted in 1947 and was later convicted in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois of conspiring to monopolize the sale of buses and related products to the local transit companies that they controlled.

Over 1938 and 1939 the company made purchases in Alabama, Indiana and Ohio. and by 1939, it owned or controlled 29 local transportation companies in 27 different cities in 10 states.

American City Lines, which had been organized to acquire local transportation systems in the larger metropolitan areas in various parts of the country in 1943 merged with NCL in 1946. By 1947 the company owned or controlled 46 systems in 45 cities in 16 states.

In 1947 National City Lines, with others was indicted in the Federal District Court of Southern California on two counts: &#x27;conspiring to acquire control of a number of transit companies, forming a transportation monopolize&#x27; and &#x27;Conspiring to monopolize sales of buses and supplies to companies owned by National City Lines&#x27; in what became known as the Great American streetcar scandal (or &#x27;General Motors streetcar conspiracy&#x27;, &#x27;National City Lines conspiracy&#x27;).

In 1948, the United States Supreme Court (in &quot;United States v. National City Lines Inc.&quot;) permitted a change in venue to the Federal District Court in Northern Illinois. National City Lines merged with Pacific City Lines the same year.

In 1949, General Motors, Standard Oil of California, Firestone and others were convicted of conspiring to monopolize the sale of buses and related products to local transit companies controlled by NCL and other companies; they were acquitted of conspiring to monopolize the ownership of these companies. The verdicts were upheld on appeal in 1951. The corporations involved were fined $5000, their executives $1 apiece.

==Operating areas and companies==
There is considerable uncertainty and variability amongst sources as to where National City Lines operated.

The 1948 ruling stated that:

&quot;Forty-four cities in sixteen states are included. The states are as widely scattered as California, Florida, Maryland, Michigan, Nebraska, Texas and Washington. The larger local transportation systems include those of Baltimore, St. Louis, Salt Lake City, Los Angeles and Oakland. The largest concentrations of smaller systems are in Illinois, with eleven cities; California with nine (excluding Los Angeles); and Michigan with four. The local operating companies were not named as parties defendant.&quot;

This table attempts to bring together the many sources detailing the cities in which, at one time or another, National City Lines owned or controlled transit companies. A star (*) indicates that NCL is understood to have had significant control but not ownership:

*Alabama: Mobile, Montgomery
*California: Burbank, Eureka, Fresno, Glendale, Los Angeles*, Oakland*, Sacramento, Inglewood, Long Beach, San Jose, Pasadena, Stockton
*Florida: Tampa, Jacksonville*
*Illinois: Aurora/Elgin, Bloomington, Champaign, Danville, East St. Louis, Decatur, Galesburg, Joliet, Kewanee, LaSalle/Peru, Peoria, Quincy, Rock Island
*Indiana: South Bend, Terre Haute
*Iowa: Burlington, Davenport, Cedar Rapids, Ottumwa, Sioux City
*Maryland: Baltimore*
*Michigan: Jackson, Lansing, Kalamazoo, Saginaw, Pontiac
*Mississippi: Jackson
*Missouri: St. Louis*
*Montana: Butte, Great Falls
*Nebraska: Lincoln
*Ohio: Canton, Portsmouth
*Oklahoma: Tulsa
*Pennsylvania: Philadelphia*
*Texas: Beaumont, El Paso, Houston, Port Arthur, Wichita Falls
*Utah: Salt Lake City
*Washington: Bellingham, Everett, Spokane
*Wisconsin: Oshkosh

Additional information:
In Los Angeles the Los Angeles Railway (Yellow Cars) was controlled by NCL but not Pacific Electric Railway (Red Cars)

== Montgomery City Lines and the Montgomery bus boycott ==

Montgomery City Lines was the National City Lines subsidiary that operated the municipal transit system for Montgomery, Alabama.

On 1 December 1955, Rosa Parks was arrested for refusing to move to the back of a Montgomery City Lines bus. This led to the Montgomery bus boycott. Montgomery City Lines was placed in the middle of a dispute between Montgomery&#x27;s black citizenry and Montgomery city laws. In a letter published in the Montgomery Advertiser on December 3, 1955, Montgomery&#x27;s Transportation Superintendent J. H. Bagley wrote:
After Martin Luther King Jr. and the Montgomery Improvement Association wired a letter to National City Lines on 8 December 1955, the company&#x27;s vice president, Kenneth E. Totten, traveled to Montgomery the following week.

The boycott lasted for just over a year, and cost the company $750,000 (equivalent to $ million in ). The boycott ended only after the United States Supreme Court affirmed Browder v. Gayle, a ruling that black bus passengers had a right to sit in any publicly available seat.

==Later history==
National City Lines acquired the trucking company Los Angeles-Seattle Motor Express (LASME) in 1959. In 1968, LASME merged with DC International and T.I.M.E. to form T.I.M.E.-DC. National City Lines sold its transportation management division in 1978.

National City Lines was later acquired by Harold C. Simmons early in 1981. T.I.M.E.-DC ceased operations in 1988. The company continued as a fully controlled subsidiary of Simmon&#x27; Contran operation until December 31, 2007, when it was dissolved.

<text>A wallpaper group (or plane symmetry group or plane crystallographic group) is a mathematical classification of a two-dimensional repetitive pattern, based on the symmetries in the pattern. Such patterns occur frequently in architecture and decorative art, especially in textiles, tiles, and wallpaper.

The simplest wallpaper group, Group &quot;p&quot;1, applies when there is no symmetry beyond simple translation of a pattern in two dimensions. The following patterns have more forms of symmetry, including some rotational and reflectional symmetries:

Examples A and B have the same wallpaper group; it is called p&quot;4&quot;m in the IUCr notation and *442 in the orbifold notation. Example C has a different wallpaper group, called p&quot;4&quot;g or 4*2 . The fact that A and B have the same wallpaper group means that they have the same symmetries, regardless of the designs&#x27; superficial details; whereas C has a different set of symmetries.

The number of symmetry groups depends on the number of dimensions in the patterns. Wallpaper groups apply to the two-dimensional case, intermediate in complexity between the simpler frieze groups and the three-dimensional space groups.

A proof that there are only 17 distinct groups of such planar symmetries was first carried out by Evgraf Fedorov in 1891 and then derived independently by George Pólya in 1924. The proof that the list of wallpaper groups is complete came only after the much harder case of space groups had been done. The seventeen wallpaper groups are listed below; see .

==Symmetries of patterns==
A symmetry of a pattern is, loosely speaking, a way of transforming the pattern so that it looks exactly the same after the transformation. For example, translational symmetry is present when the pattern can be translated (in other words, shifted) some finite distance and appear unchanged. Think of shifting a set of vertical stripes horizontally by one stripe. The pattern is unchanged. Strictly speaking, a true symmetry only exists in patterns that repeat exactly and continue indefinitely. A set of only, say, five stripes does not have translational symmetry—when shifted, the stripe on one end &quot;disappears&quot; and a new stripe is &quot;added&quot; at the other end. In practice, however, classification is applied to finite patterns, and small imperfections may be ignored.

The types of transformations that are relevant here are called Euclidean plane isometries. For example:

* If one &quot;shifts&quot; example B one unit to the right, so that each square covers the square that was originally adjacent to it, then the resulting pattern is &quot;exactly the same&quot; as the starting pattern. This type of symmetry is called a translation. Examples A and C are similar, except that the smallest possible shifts are in diagonal directions.
* If one &quot;turns&quot; example B clockwise by 90°, around the centre of one of the squares, again one obtains exactly the same pattern. This is called a rotation. Examples A and C also have 90° rotations, although it requires a little more ingenuity to find the correct centre of rotation for C.
* One can also &quot;flip&quot; example B across a horizontal axis that runs across the middle of the image. This is called a reflection. Example B also has reflections across a vertical axis, and across two diagonal axes. The same can be said for A.

However, example C is &quot;different&quot;. It only has reflections in horizontal and vertical directions, &quot;not&quot; across diagonal axes. If one flips across a diagonal line, one does &quot;not&quot; get the same pattern back, but the original pattern shifted across by a certain distance. This is part of the reason that the wallpaper group of A and B is different from the wallpaper group of C.

Another transformation is &quot;Glide&quot;, a combination of reflection and translation parallel to the line of reflection. 
==Formal definition and discussion==
Mathematically, a wallpaper group or plane crystallographic group is a type of topologically discrete group of isometries of the Euclidean plane that contains two linearly independent translations.

Two such isometry groups are of the same type (of the same wallpaper group) if they are the same up to an affine transformation of the plane. Thus e.g. a translation of the plane (hence a translation of the mirrors and centres of rotation) does not affect the wallpaper group. The same applies for a change of angle between translation vectors, provided that it does not add or remove any symmetry (this is only the case if there are no mirrors and no glide reflections, and rotational symmetry is at most of order 2).

Unlike in the three-dimensional case, one can equivalently restrict the affine transformations to those that preserve orientation.

It follows from the Bieberbach conjecture that all wallpaper groups are different even as abstract groups (as opposed to e.g. frieze groups, of which two are isomorphic with Z).

2D patterns with double translational symmetry can be categorized according to their symmetry group type.

===Isometries of the Euclidean plane===
Isometries of the Euclidean plane fall into four categories (see the article Euclidean plane isometry for more information).
*Translations, denoted by &quot;T&quot;&quot;v&quot;, where &quot;v&quot; is a vector in R2. This has the effect of shifting the plane applying displacement vector &quot;v&quot;.
*Rotations, denoted by &quot;R&quot;&quot;c&quot;,&quot;θ&quot;, where &quot;c&quot; is a point in the plane (the centre of rotation), and &quot;θ&quot; is the angle of rotation.
*Reflections, or mirror isometries, denoted by &quot;F&quot;&quot;L&quot;, where &quot;L&quot; is a line in R2. (&quot;F&quot; is for &quot;flip&quot;). This has the effect of reflecting the plane in the line &quot;L&quot;, called the reflection axis or the associated mirror.
*Glide reflections, denoted by &quot;G&quot;&quot;L&quot;,&quot;d&quot;, where &quot;L&quot; is a line in R2 and &quot;d&quot; is a distance. This is a combination of a reflection in the line &quot;L&quot; and a translation along &quot;L&quot; by a distance &quot;d&quot;.

===The independent translations condition===
The condition on linearly independent translations means that there exist linearly independent vectors &quot;v&quot; and &quot;w&quot; (in R2) such that the group contains both &quot;T&quot;&quot;v&quot; and &quot;T&quot;&quot;w&quot;.

The purpose of this condition is to distinguish wallpaper groups from frieze groups, which possess a translation but not two linearly independent ones, and from two-dimensional discrete point groups, which have no translations at all. In other words, wallpaper groups represent patterns that repeat themselves in &quot;two&quot; distinct directions, in contrast to frieze groups, which only repeat along a single axis.

(It is possible to generalise this situation. One could for example study discrete groups of isometries of R&quot;n&quot; with &quot;m&quot; linearly independent translations, where &quot;m&quot; is any integer in the range 0 ≤ &quot;m&quot; ≤ &quot;n&quot;.)

===The discreteness condition===
The discreteness condition means that there is some positive real number ε, such that for every translation &quot;T&quot;&quot;v&quot; in the group, the vector &quot;v&quot; has length &quot;at least&quot; ε (except of course in the case that &quot;v&quot; is the zero vector, but the independent translations condition prevents this, since any set that contains the zero vector is linearly dependent by definition and thus disallowed).

The purpose of this condition is to ensure that the group has a compact fundamental domain, or in other words, a &quot;cell&quot; of nonzero, finite area, which is repeated through the plane. Without this condition, one might have for example a group containing the translation &quot;T&quot;&quot;x&quot; for every rational number &quot;x&quot;, which would not correspond to any reasonable wallpaper pattern.

One important and nontrivial consequence of the discreteness condition in combination with the independent translations condition is that the group can only contain rotations of order 2, 3, 4, or 6; that is, every rotation in the group must be a rotation by 180°, 120°, 90°, or 60°. This fact is known as the crystallographic restriction theorem, and can be generalised to higher-dimensional cases.

===Notations for wallpaper groups===

====Crystallographic notation====
Crystallography has 230 space groups to distinguish, far more than the 17 wallpaper groups, but many of the symmetries in the groups are the same. Thus one can use a similar notation for both kinds of groups, that of Carl Hermann and Charles-Victor Mauguin. An example of a full wallpaper name in Hermann-Mauguin style (also called IUCr notation) is p&quot;31&quot;m, with four letters or digits; more usual is a shortened name like cmm or pg.

For wallpaper groups the full notation begins with either p or c, for a &quot;primitive cell&quot; or a &quot;face-centred cell&quot;; these are explained below. This is followed by a digit, n, indicating the highest order of rotational symmetry: 1-fold (none), 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, or 6-fold. The next two symbols indicate symmetries relative to one translation axis of the pattern, referred to as the &quot;main&quot; one; if there is a mirror perpendicular to a translation axis that is the main one (or if there are two, one of them). The symbols are either m, g, or 1, for mirror, glide reflection, or none. The axis of the mirror or glide reflection is perpendicular to the main axis for the first letter, and either parallel or tilted 180°/&quot;n&quot; (when &quot;n&quot; &gt; 2) for the second letter. Many groups include other symmetries implied by the given ones. The short notation drops digits or an m that can be deduced, so long as that leaves no confusion with another group.

A primitive cell is a minimal region repeated by lattice translations. All but two wallpaper symmetry groups are described with respect to primitive cell axes, a coordinate basis using the translation vectors of the lattice. In the remaining two cases symmetry description is with respect to centred cells that are larger than the primitive cell, and hence have internal repetition; the directions of their sides is different from those of the translation vectors spanning a primitive cell. Hermann-Mauguin notation for crystal space groups uses additional cell types.

;Examples
* &quot;p&quot;2 (&quot;p&quot;2): Primitive cell, 2-fold rotation symmetry, no mirrors or glide reflections.
* &quot;p&quot;4&quot;gm&quot; (p&quot;4&quot;gm): Primitive cell, 4-fold rotation, glide reflection perpendicular to main axis, mirror axis at 45°.
* &quot;c&quot;2&quot;mm&quot; (c&quot;2&quot;mm): Centred cell, 2-fold rotation, mirror axes both perpendicular and parallel to main axis.
* &quot;p&quot;31&quot;m&quot; (p&quot;31&quot;m): Primitive cell, 3-fold rotation, mirror axis at 60°.

Here are all the names that differ in short and full notation.

The remaining names are &quot;p&quot;1, &quot;p&quot;2, &quot;p&quot;3, &quot;p&quot;3&quot;m&quot;1, &quot;p&quot;31&quot;m&quot;, &quot;p&quot;4, and &quot;p&quot;6.

====Orbifold notation====
Orbifold notation for wallpaper groups, advocated by John Horton Conway (Conway, 1992) (Conway 2008), is based not on crystallography, but on topology. One can fold the infinite periodic tiling of the plane into its essence, an orbifold, then describe that with a few symbols.

*A digit, n, indicates a centre of &quot;n&quot;-fold rotation corresponding to a cone point on the orbifold. By the crystallographic restriction theorem, &quot;n&quot; must be 2, 3, 4, or 6.
*An asterisk, *, indicates a mirror symmetry corresponding to a boundary of the orbifold. It interacts with the digits as follows:
*#Digits before * denote centres of pure rotation (cyclic).
*#Digits after * denote centres of rotation with mirrors through them, corresponding to &quot;corners&quot; on the boundary of the orbifold (dihedral).
*A cross, ×, occurs when a glide reflection is present and indicates a crosscap on the orbifold. Pure mirrors combine with lattice translation to produce glides, but those are already accounted for so need no notation.
*The &quot;no symmetry&quot; symbol, o, stands alone, and indicates there are only lattice translations with no other symmetry. The orbifold with this symbol is a torus; in general the symbol o denotes a handle on the orbifold.

The group denoted in crystallographic notation by cmm will, in Conway&#x27;s notation, be 2*22. The 2 before the * says there is a 2-fold rotation centre with no mirror through it. The * itself says there is a mirror. The first 2 after the * says there is a 2-fold rotation centre on a mirror. The final 2 says there is an independent second 2-fold rotation centre on a mirror, one that is not a duplicate of the first one under symmetries.

The group denoted by pgg will be 22×. There are two pure 2-fold rotation centres, and a glide reflection axis. Contrast this with pmg, Conway 22*, where crystallographic notation mentions a glide, but one that is implicit in the other symmetries of the orbifold.

Coxeter&#x27;s bracket notation is also included, based on reflectional Coxeter groups, and modified with plus superscripts accounting for rotations, improper rotations and translations.

===Why there are exactly seventeen groups===
An orbifold can be viewed as a polygon with face, edges, and vertices which can be unfolded to form a possibly infinite set of polygons which tile either the sphere, the plane or the hyperbolic plane. When it tiles the plane it will give a wallpaper group and when it tiles the sphere or hyperbolic plane it gives either a spherical symmetry group or Hyperbolic symmetry group. The type of space the polygons tile can be found by calculating the Euler characteristic, &quot;χ&quot; = &quot;V&quot; − &quot;E&quot; + &quot;F&quot;, where &quot;V&quot; is the number of corners (vertices), &quot;E&quot; is the number of edges and &quot;F&quot; is the number of faces. If the Euler characteristic is positive then the orbifold has an elliptic (spherical) structure; if it is zero then it has a parabolic structure, i.e. a wallpaper group; and if it is negative it will have a hyperbolic structure. When the full set of possible orbifolds is enumerated it is found that only 17 have Euler characteristic 0.

When an orbifold replicates by symmetry to fill the plane, its features create a structure of vertices, edges, and polygon faces, which must be consistent with the Euler characteristic. Reversing the process, one can assign numbers to the features of the orbifold, but fractions, rather than whole numbers. Because the orbifold itself is a quotient of the full surface by the symmetry group, the orbifold Euler characteristic is a quotient of the surface Euler characteristic by the order of the symmetry group.

The orbifold Euler characteristic is 2 minus the sum of the feature values, assigned as follows:
*A digit n without or before a * counts as .
*A digit n after a * counts as .
*Both * and × count as 1.
*The &quot;no symmetry&quot; o counts as 2.

For a wallpaper group, the sum for the characteristic must be zero; thus the feature sum must be 2.

;Examples
*632: + + = 2
*3*3: + 1 + = 2
*4*2: + 1 + = 2
*22×: + + 1 = 2

Now enumeration of all wallpaper groups becomes a matter of arithmetic, of listing all feature strings with values summing to 2.

Feature strings with other sums are not nonsense; they imply non-planar tilings, not discussed here. (When the orbifold Euler characteristic is negative, the tiling is hyperbolic; when positive, spherical or &quot;bad&quot;).

==Guide to recognizing wallpaper groups==
To work out which wallpaper group corresponds to a given design, one may use the following table.

See also .

==The seventeen groups==
Each of the groups in this section has two cell structure diagrams, which are to be interpreted as follows (it is the shape that is significant, not the colour):

On the right-hand side diagrams, different equivalence classes of symmetry elements are colored (and rotated) differently.

The brown or yellow area indicates a fundamental domain, i.e. the smallest part of the pattern that is repeated.

The diagrams on the right show the cell of the lattice corresponding to the smallest translations; those on the left sometimes show a larger area.

*This group is frequently seen in everyday life, since the most common arrangement of bricks in a brick building (running bond) utilises this group (see example below).

The rotational symmetry of order 2 with centres of rotation at the centres of the sides of the rhombus is a consequence of the other properties.

The pattern corresponds to each of the following:
*symmetrically staggered rows of identical doubly symmetric objects
*a checkerboard pattern of two alternating rectangular tiles, of which each, by itself, is doubly symmetric
*a checkerboard pattern of alternatingly a 2-fold rotationally symmetric rectangular tile and its mirror image

;Examples of group &quot;cmm&quot;

=== Group &quot;p&quot;4 (442)===
* Orbifold signature: 442
* Coxeter notation: [4,4]+
* Lattice: square
* Point group: C4
* The group &quot;p&quot;4 has two rotation centres of order four (90°), and one rotation centre of order two (180°). It has no reflections or glide reflections.

;Examples of group &quot;p&quot;4

A &quot;p&quot;4 pattern can be looked upon as a repetition in rows and columns of equal square tiles with 4-fold rotational symmetry. Also it can be looked upon as a checkerboard pattern of two such tiles, a factor smaller and rotated 45°.

=== Group &quot;p&quot;4&quot;m&quot; (*442)===
* Orbifold signature: *442
* Coxeter notation: [4,4]
* Lattice: square
* Point group: D4
* The group p&quot;4&quot;m has two rotation centres of order four (90°), and reflections in four distinct directions (horizontal, vertical, and diagonals). It has additional glide reflections whose axes are not reflection axes; rotations of order two (180°) are centred at the intersection of the glide reflection axes. All rotation centres lie on reflection axes.

This corresponds to a straightforward grid of rows and columns of equal squares with the four reflection axes. Also it corresponds to a checkerboard pattern of two of such squares.

;Examples of group &quot;p&quot;4&quot;m&quot;

Examples displayed with the smallest translations horizontal and vertical (like in the diagram):

Examples displayed with the smallest translations diagonal:
=== Group &quot;p&quot;4&quot;g&quot; (4*2)===
* Orbifold signature: 4*2
* Coxeter notation: [4+,4]
* Lattice: square
* Point group: D4
* The group p&quot;4&quot;g has two centres of rotation of order four (90°), which are each other&#x27;s mirror image, but it has reflections in only two directions, which are perpendicular. There are rotations of order two (180°) whose centres are located at the intersections of reflection axes. It has glide reflections axes parallel to the reflection axes, in between them, and also at an angle of 45° with these.
A p&quot;4&quot;g pattern can be looked upon as a checkerboard pattern of copies of a square tile with 4-fold rotational symmetry, and its mirror image. Alternatively it can be looked upon (by shifting half a tile) as a checkerboard pattern of copies of a horizontally and vertically symmetric tile and its 90° rotated version. Note that neither applies for a plain checkerboard pattern of black and white tiles, this is group &quot;p&quot;4&quot;m&quot; (with diagonal translation cells).

=== Group &quot;p&quot;3 (333)===
* Orbifold signature: 333
* Coxeter notation: [(3,3,3)]+ or [3[3]]+
* Lattice: hexagonal
* Point group: C3
* The group &quot;p&quot;3 has three different rotation centres of order three (120°), but no reflections or glide reflections.

Imagine a tessellation of the plane with equilateral triangles of equal size, with the sides corresponding to the smallest translations. Then half of the triangles are in one orientation, and the other half upside down. This wallpaper group corresponds to the case that all triangles of the same orientation are equal, while both types have rotational symmetry of order three, but the two are not equal, not each other&#x27;s mirror image, and not both symmetric (if the two are equal it is p&quot;6, if they are each other&#x27;s mirror image it is p&quot;31&quot;m, if they are both symmetric it is p&quot;3&quot;m&quot;1; if two of the three apply then the third also, and it is p&quot;6&quot;m). For a given image, three of these tessellations are possible, each with rotation centres as vertices, i.e. for any tessellation two shifts are possible. In terms of the image: the vertices can be the red, the blue or the green triangles.

Equivalently, imagine a tessellation of the plane with regular hexagons, with sides equal to the smallest translation distance divided by . Then this wallpaper group corresponds to the case that all hexagons are equal (and in the same orientation) and have rotational symmetry of order three, while they have no mirror image symmetry (if they have rotational symmetry of order six it is p&quot;6, if they are symmetric with respect to the main diagonals it is p&quot;31&quot;m, if they are symmetric with respect to lines perpendicular to the sides it is p&quot;3&quot;m&quot;1; if two of the three apply then the third also, it is p&quot;6&quot;m). For a given image, three of these tessellations are possible, each with one third of the rotation centres as centres of the hexagons. In terms of the image: the centres of the hexagons can be the red, the blue or the green triangles.

;Examples of group &quot;p&quot;3

=== Group &quot;p&quot;3&quot;m&quot;1 (*333)===
* Orbifold signature: *333
* Coxeter notation: [(3,3,3)] or [3[3]]
* Lattice: hexagonal
* Point group: D3
* The group &quot;p&quot;3&quot;m&quot;1 has three different rotation centres of order three (120°). It has reflections in the three sides of an equilateral triangle. The centre of every rotation lies on a reflection axis. There are additional glide reflections in three distinct directions, whose axes are located halfway between adjacent parallel reflection axes.

Like for &quot;p&quot;3, imagine a tessellation of the plane with equilateral triangles of equal size, with the sides corresponding to the smallest translations. Then half of the triangles are in one orientation, and the other half upside down. This wallpaper group corresponds to the case that all triangles of the same orientation are equal, while both types have rotational symmetry of order three, and both are symmetric, but the two are not equal, and not each other&#x27;s mirror image. For a given image, three of these tessellations are possible, each with rotation centres as vertices. In terms of the image: the vertices can be the red, the blue or the green triangles.
;Examples of group &quot;p&quot;3&quot;m&quot;1

=== Group &quot;p&quot;31&quot;m&quot; (3*3)===
* Orbifold signature: 3*3
* Coxeter notation: [6,3+]
* Lattice: hexagonal
* Point group: D3
* The group p&quot;31&quot;m has three different rotation centres of order three (120°), of which two are each other&#x27;s mirror image. It has reflections in three distinct directions. It has at least one rotation whose centre does &quot;not&quot; lie on a reflection axis. There are additional glide reflections in three distinct directions, whose axes are located halfway between adjacent parallel reflection axes.

Like for p&quot;3 and p&quot;3&quot;m&quot;1, imagine a tessellation of the plane with equilateral triangles of equal size, with the sides corresponding to the smallest translations. Then half of the triangles are in one orientation, and the other half upside down. This wallpaper group corresponds to the case that all triangles of the same orientation are equal, while both types have rotational symmetry of order three and are each other&#x27;s mirror image, but not symmetric themselves, and not equal. For a given image, only one such tessellation is possible. In terms of the image: the vertices must be the red triangles, &quot;not&quot; the blue triangles.
;Examples of group &quot;p&quot;31&quot;m&quot;

=== Group &quot;p&quot;6 (632)===
* Orbifold signature: 632
* Coxeter notation: [6,3]+
* Lattice: hexagonal
* Point group: C6
* The group &quot;p&quot;6 has one rotation centre of order six (60°); two rotation centres of order three (120°), which are each other&#x27;s images under a rotation of 60°; and three rotation centres of order two (180°) which are also each other&#x27;s images under a rotation of 60°. It has no reflections or glide reflections.

A pattern with this symmetry can be looked upon as a tessellation of the plane with equal triangular tiles with C3 symmetry, or equivalently, a tessellation of the plane with equal hexagonal tiles with C6 symmetry (with the edges of the tiles not necessarily part of the pattern).
;Examples of group &quot;p&quot;6

=== Group &quot;p&quot;6&quot;m&quot; (*632)===
* Orbifold signature: *632
* Coxeter notation: [6,3]
* Lattice: hexagonal
* Point group: D6
* The group p&quot;6&quot;m has one rotation centre of order six (60°); it has two rotation centres of order three, which only differ by a rotation of 60° (or, equivalently, 180°), and three of order two, which only differ by a rotation of 60°. It has also reflections in six distinct directions. There are additional glide reflections in six distinct directions, whose axes are located halfway between adjacent parallel reflection axes.

A pattern with this symmetry can be looked upon as a tessellation of the plane with equal triangular tiles with D3 symmetry, or equivalently, a tessellation of the plane with equal hexagonal tiles with D6 symmetry (with the edges of the tiles not necessarily part of the pattern). Thus the simplest examples are a triangular lattice with or without connecting lines, and a hexagonal tiling with one color for outlining the hexagons and one for the background.
;Examples of group &quot;p&quot;6&quot;m&quot;

==Lattice types==
There are five lattice types or Bravais lattices, corresponding to the five possible wallpaper groups of the lattice itself. The wallpaper group of a pattern with this lattice of translational symmetry cannot have more, but may have less symmetry than the lattice itself.
*In the 5 cases of rotational symmetry of order 3 or 6, the unit cell consists of two equilateral triangles (hexagonal lattice, itself p&quot;6&quot;m). They form a rhombus with angles 60° and 120°.
*In the 3 cases of rotational symmetry of order 4, the cell is a square (square lattice, itself p&quot;4&quot;m).
*In the 5 cases of reflection or glide reflection, but not both, the cell is a rectangle (rectangular lattice, itself pmm). It may also be interpreted as a centered rhombic lattice. Special cases: square.
*In the 2 cases of reflection combined with glide reflection, the cell is a rhombus (rhombic lattice, itself cmm). It may also be interpreted as a centered rectangular lattice. Special cases: square, hexagonal unit cell.
*In the case of only rotational symmetry of order 2, and the case of no other symmetry than translational, the cell is in general a parallelogram (parallelogrammatic or oblique lattice, itself &quot;p&quot;2). Special cases: rectangle, square, rhombus, hexagonal unit cell.

==Symmetry groups==
The actual symmetry group should be distinguished from the wallpaper group. Wallpaper groups are collections of symmetry groups. There are 17 of these collections, but for each collection there are infinitely many symmetry groups, in the sense of actual groups of isometries. These depend, apart from the wallpaper group, on a number of parameters for the translation vectors, the orientation and position of the reflection axes and rotation centers.

The numbers of degrees of freedom are:
*6 for &quot;p&quot;2
*5 for pmm, pmg, pgg, and cmm
*4 for the rest.

However, within each wallpaper group, all symmetry groups are algebraically isomorphic.

Some symmetry group isomorphisms:
*&quot;p&quot;1: Z2
*pm: Z × D∞
*pmm: D∞ × D∞.

==Dependence of wallpaper groups on transformations==
*The wallpaper group of a pattern is invariant under isometries and uniform scaling (similarity transformations).
*Translational symmetry is preserved under arbitrary bijective affine transformations.
*Rotational symmetry of order two ditto; this means also that 4- and 6-fold rotation centres at least keep 2-fold rotational symmetry.
*Reflection in a line and glide reflection are preserved on expansion/contraction along, or perpendicular to, the axis of reflection and glide reflection. It changes p&quot;6&quot;m, p&quot;4&quot;g, and p&quot;3&quot;m&quot;1 into cmm, p&quot;3&quot;m&quot;1 into cm, and p&quot;4&quot;m, depending on direction of expansion/contraction, into pmm or cmm. A pattern of symmetrically staggered rows of points is special in that it can convert by expansion/contraction from p&quot;6&quot;m to p&quot;4&quot;m.

Note that when a transformation decreases symmetry, a transformation of the same kind (the inverse) obviously for some patterns increases the symmetry. Such a special property of a pattern (e.g. expansion in one direction produces a pattern with 4-fold symmetry) is not counted as a form of extra symmetry.

Change of colors does not affect the wallpaper group if any two points that have the same color before the change, also have the same color after the change, and any two points that have different colors before the change, also have different colors after the change.

If the former applies, but not the latter, such as when converting a color image to one in black and white, then symmetries are preserved, but they may increase, so that the wallpaper group can change.

<doc id="386218" wikidata="Q1569460" url="?curid=386218" title="Mesolimbic pathway">
<text>The mesolimbic pathway, sometimes referred to as the reward pathway, is a dopaminergic pathway in the brain. The pathway connects the ventral tegmental area in the midbrain to the ventral striatum of the basal ganglia in the forebrain. The ventral striatum includes the nucleus accumbens and the olfactory tubercle.

The release of dopamine from the mesolimbic pathway into the nucleus accumbens regulates incentive salience (e.g. motivation and desire for rewarding stimuli) and facilitates reinforcement and reward-related motor function learning; it may also play a role in the subjective perception of pleasure. The dysregulation of the mesolimbic pathway and its output neurons in the nucleus accumbens plays a significant role in the development and maintenance of an addiction.

==Anatomy==

The mesolimbic pathway is a collection of dopaminergic (i.e., dopamine-releasing) neurons that project from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the ventral striatum, which includes the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and olfactory tubercle. It is one of the component pathways of the medial forebrain bundle, which is a set of neural pathways that mediate brain stimulation reward.

The VTA is located in the midbrain and consists of dopaminergic, GABAergic, and glutamatergic neurons. The dopaminergic neurons in this region receive stimuli from both cholinergic neurons in the pedunculopontine nucleus and the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus as well as glutamatergic neurons in other regions such as the prefrontal cortex. The nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle are located in the ventral striatum and are primarily composed of medium spiny neurons. The nucleus accumbens is subdivided into limbic and motor subregions known as the NAcc shell and NAcc core. The medium spiny neurons in the nucleus accumbens receive input from both the dopaminergic neurons of the VTA and the glutamatergic neurons of the hippocampus, amygdala, and medial prefrontal cortex. When they are activated by these inputs, the medium spiny neurons&#x27; projections release GABA onto the ventral pallidum.

==Function==
The mesolimbic pathway regulates incentive salience, motivation, reinforcement learning, and fear, among other cognitive processes.

The mesolimbic pathway is involved in motivational cognition. Depletion of dopamine in this pathway, or lesions at its site of origin, decrease the extent to which an animal is willing to go to obtain a reward (e.g. the number of lever presses for intravenous nicotine delivery in rats or time spent searching for food). Dopaminergic drugs are also able to increase the extent an animal is willing to go to obtain a reward. Moreover, the firing rate of neurons in the mesolimbic pathway increases during anticipation of reward, which may explain craving. Mesolimbic dopamine release was once thought to be the primary mediator of pleasure, but is now believed to have only a minor or secondary role in pleasure perception.

==Clinical significance==

=== Mechanisms of addiction ===
The mesolimbic pathway and a specific set of the pathway&#x27;s output neurons (e.g. D1-type medium spiny neurons within the nucleus accumbens) play a central role in the neurobiology of addiction. Drug addiction is an illness caused by habitual substance use that induces chemical changes in the brain&#x27;s circuitry. An addictive drug is defined as a substance that affects the mesolimbic system directly or indirectly by increasing extracellular levels of dopamine.

Common addictive substances such as cocaine, alcohol, and nicotine have been shown to increase extracellular levels of dopamine within the mesolimbic pathway, preferentially within the nucleus accumbens. The mechanisms by which these drugs do so vary depending on the drug prototype. For example, cocaine precludes the re-uptake of synaptic dopamine through blocking the presynaptic dopamine transporter. Another stimulant, amphetamine, reverses the dopamine transporter and induces the release of dopamine from synaptic vesicles. Non-stimulant drugs typically bind with ligand-gated channels or G protein-coupled receptors. Such drugs include alcohol, nicotine, and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).

These dopaminergic activations of the mesolimbic pathway are accompanied by the perception of reward. This stimulus-reward association shows a resistance to extinction and creates an increased motivation to repeat that same behavior that caused it. Additionally, drug intake changes synaptic plasticity in the ventral tegmental area and the nucleus accumbens. Repeated exposure to the drug can lead to lasting changes in the brain that gives rise to addictive behavior.

=== Relation to other neurological and psychological disorders ===
The mesolimbic pathway is implicated in schizophrenia, depression, and Parkinson&#x27;s disease. It is also theorized to be implicated in overuse of digital media, although it could simply be a consequence of a sedentary lifestyle. Each involves distinct structural changes within the mesolimbic pathway.

<text>The Pontiac Firebird is an American automobile built and produced by Pontiac from the 1967 to 2002 model years. Designed as a pony car to compete with the Ford Mustang, it was introduced on February 23, 1967, five months after GM&#x27;s Chevrolet division&#x27;s platform-sharing Camaro. This also coincided with the release of the 1967 Mercury Cougar, Ford&#x27;s upscale, platform-sharing version of the Mustang.
The name &quot;Firebird&quot; was also previously used by GM for the General Motors Firebird series of concept cars in the 1950s.

== First generation (1967–1969) ==

The first generation Firebird had characteristic Coke bottle styling shared with its cousin, the Chevrolet Camaro. Announcing a Pontiac styling trend, the Firebird&#x27;s bumpers were integrated into the design of the front end, giving it a more streamlined look than the Camaro. The Firebird&#x27;s rear &quot;slit&quot; taillights were inspired by the 1966–1967 Pontiac GTO and Pontiac Grand Prix. Both a two-door hardtop and a convertible were offered through the 1969 model year. Originally, the car was a &quot;consolation prize&quot; for Pontiac, which had desired to produce a two-seat sports car based on its original Banshee concept car. However, GM feared this would cut into Chevrolet Corvette sales, and gave Pontiac a piece of the &quot;pony car&quot; market by sharing the F-body platform with Chevrolet. The listed retail price before options for the coupe was $2,666 ($ in dollars) and the convertible was $2,903 ($ in dollars).

The 1967 base model Firebird came equipped with the Pontiac SOHC inline-six. Based on the architecture of the standard 
Chevrolet inline-six, it was fitted with a one-barrel Rochester carburetor and rated at . The &quot;Sprint&quot; model six came with a four-barrel carburetor, developing . Most buyers opted for one of three V8s: the with a two-barrel carburetor producing ; the four-barrel &quot;HO&quot; (high output) 326, producing ; or the from the GTO. All 1967–1968 400 CI engines had throttle restrictors that blocked the carburetors&#x27; secondaries from fully opening. A &quot;Ram Air&quot; option was also available, providing functional hood scoops, higher flow heads with stronger valve springs, and a hotter camshaft. Power for the Ram Air package was the same as the conventional 400 HO, but peaked at 5,200 rpm.

The engines were subsequently enlarged for 1968 to 250 cubic inches (4.1 liters), the base version developing an increased using a one-barrel carburetor, and the high-output Sprint version the same 215 hp with a four-barrel carburetor. Also for the 1968 model, the engine was replaced by the Pontiac V8, which actually displaced , and produced with a two-barrel carburetor. An HO version of the with a revised cam was also offered to start in that year, which developed . The power output of the other engines was increased marginally.

There was an additional Ram Air IV option for the V8 engines during 1969, complementing the Ram Air 400(now often colloquially but incorrectly called the &quot;Ram Air III,&quot; a name never used by Pontiac). The Ram Air IV was rated at at 5000 rpm and of torque at 3400 rpm; and respectively. The HO engine was revised again with a different cam and cylinder heads resulting in . During 1969 a special engine was designed for Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) road racing applications that were not available in production cars.

Modifications for 1968 included the addition of federally-mandated side marker lights: for the front of the car, the turn signals were made larger and extended to wrap around the front edges of the car, and on the rear, the Pontiac (V-shaped) Arrowhead logo was added to each side. The front door vent-windows was replaced with a single pane of glass and Astro Ventilation, a fresh-air-inlet system. The 1969 model received a major facelift with a new front-end design but unlike the GTO, it did not have the Endura bumper. The instrument panel and steering wheel were revised. The ignition switch was moved from the dashboard to the steering column with the introduction of GM&#x27;s new locking ignition switch/steering wheel.

In March 1969, a US$1,083 ($ in ) optional handling package called the &quot;Trans Am performance and appearance package&quot;, UPC &quot;WS4&quot;, named after the Trans Am Series, was introduced. A total of 689 hardtops and eight convertibles were made.

Due to engineering problems that delayed the introduction of the new 1970 Firebird beyond the usual fall debut, Pontiac continued production of 1969 model Firebirds into the early months of the 1970 model year (the other 1970 Pontiac models had been introduced on September 18, 1969). By late spring of 1969, Pontiac had deleted all model-year references on Firebird literature and promotional materials, anticipating the extended production run of the then-current 1969 models.

== Second generation (1970–1981) ==

The second-generation debut for the 1970 model year was delayed until February 26, 1970, because of tooling and engineering problems; thus, its popular designation as a 1970½ model, while leftover 1969s were listed in early Pontiac literature without a model-year identification. This generation of Firebirds were available in coupe form only; after the 1969 model year, convertibles were not available until 1989.

Replacing the &quot;Coke bottle&quot; styling was a more &quot;swoopy&quot; body style, while still retaining some traditional elements. The top of the rear window line went almost straight down to the lip of the trunk lid. The new design was initially characterized by a large C-pillar, until 1975 when the rear window was enlarged. Originally, the &quot;wraparound&quot; style window that occupied more of the c-pillar was initially supposed to be the design, but problems with the glue and sealing of the rear window led to the flat style window being used until the re-designed body in 1975. This style became the look that was to epitomize the F-body styling for the longest period during the Firebird&#x27;s lifetime.

===1970===
The first year of the second generation Firebird began offering a wider array of model subtypes and marked the appearance of the Firebird Esprit and the Firebird Formula. The Firebird Esprit was offered as a luxury model that came with appearance options, the deluxe interior package, and a Pontiac 350 as standard equipment. The Formula was advertised as an alternative to the Trans Am and could be ordered with all the options available to the Trans Am with the exception of the fender flares, shaker scoop, and fender heat extractors.

The base model Firebird came equipped with a inline-six. The Firebird Esprit and the Firebird Formula came standard with the , . The Esprit could be upgraded to a two-barrel carbureted , , while the Formula could be optioned to receive the L78 4 barrel 400 that produced or the L74 Ram Air III 400 .

There were two Ram Air  engines available for the 1970 Trans Am, carried over from 1969: the L74 Ram Air III 400, and the L67 Ram Air IV. The Ram Air IV was exclusive to the Trans Am, and could not be ordered on any of the lower Firebird models. The difference between the GTO and Firebird engines was that the secondary carburetor&#x27;s throttle linkage had a restrictor which prevented the rear barrels from opening completely, altering the linkage could allow full carburetor operation resulting in identical engine performance.

For the 1970 and 1971 model years, all Firebirds equipped with radios had the antennae mounted &quot;in-glass&quot; in the windshield.

===1971===

The 1971 model year had a few minor changes to the Firebird. Fenders across all models featured a one-year-only exhaust vent seen on the lower half of the fenders. The interior options also changed to the newer style collared bucket seats in the deluxe interior, and the previous year&#x27;s seats with the headrest were no longer available. The rear seat console was introduced as an option, and Honeycomb wheels became available for all Firebirds.

Engine selection saw the addition of Pontiac’s largest V8, the 455, available in the L75 version and the LS5 HO version. Both the 455 and 455 HO were available as engine options for the Firebird Formula, but the Trans Am received the 455 HO as standard equipment.
===1972===
During a 1972 strike, the Firebird (and the similar F-body Camaro) were nearly dropped.

The 1972 model year saw minor cosmetic changes. A difference that differentiates a 1972 Firebird from the other 1970-73 Firebirds is the hexagonal honeycomb grille insert on the nose of the vehicle.

1972 saw an industry-wide change to the way the engines were rated from the factory, with misleading SAE Gross horsepower ratings replaced by more accurate SAE Net figures. The compression ratio was also lowered for many engines to accept more environmentally friendly low-leaded fuel that had been mandated, further lowering power ratings.

Engine options remained mostly unchanged, however, the L75 455 engine was dropped, but the LS5 455 HO remained as an option for the Formula and standard for the Trans Am. Pontiac advertised the 1972 455 HO as de-tuned to 300 hp, but the engine was unchanged from 1971.

Starting in 1972, and continuing until 1977, the Firebird was only produced at the Norwood, Ohio, facility.

===1973===
In 1973, the Trans Am added two new colors, Buccaneer Red and Brewster Green. Other exterior upgrades included the updated more modern nose bird. The new hood bird was option &quot;RPO WW7 Hood Decal&quot;, a $55 option exclusive to Trans Am. The &quot;Trans Am&quot; decals were larger than previous versions and shared the same accent color schemes as the hood bird.

Inside the 1973 Firebird, the standard interior equipment was almost the same as in prior years. A new &quot;Horse Collar&quot; optional custom interior featured new seat coverings and door panels. Interior colors were limited to Black, White, Red and Saddle, with the rare option for customers to order orange, red and blue carpet to any of the interior options. The 1973 Firebird also had to meet the new safety and emissions requirements for 1973. There were extra steel reinforcements in the bumper and core support to the fender.

The 1973 Trans Am engine displaced 455 cubic inches in the base L75 and the Super Duty LS2 option. The base 455 produced 40 fewer horsepower than the round port Super Duty 455. Horsepower for the base L75 455 was rated at at 4000 rpm and at 2800 rpm. Pontiac removed the H.O. designation from the base engine, and simply decaled the now non-functioning shaker with &quot;455&quot;.

The &quot;all hand-assembled&quot; LS2 SD455 engine was rated at at 4000 rpm and at 3600 rpm. All Pontiac engines included a new EGR system, which delayed the SD-455 program until late into the production year. The shaker decal on the scoop read &quot;SD-455&quot;.

The 1973 Trans Am introduced &quot;Radial Tuned Suspension&quot;. When ordered, it included 15-inch radial tires. This delivered a more comfortable ride while also providing better cornering.

The 1973 Trans Am production was up over previous years, the L75 455 production was 3,130 with automatic and 1,420 with manual transmission. The special ordered $550 Option LS2 SD-455 production saw 180 automatics and 72 manuals.

===1974===
Curb weights rose dramatically in the 1974 model year because of the implementation of telescoping bumpers and various other crash- and safety-related structural enhancements; SD455 Trans Ams weighed in at in their first year of production (1974 model year; actually 1973).

The 1974 models featured a redesigned &quot;shovel-nose&quot; front end and new wide &quot;slotted&quot; taillights. The 400, 455, and SD-455 engines were offered in the Trans Am and Formula models during 1974. A June 1974 test of a newly delivered, privately owned SD-455 Trans Am appeared in &quot;Super Stock and Drag Illustrated&quot;. With an unmodified car and a test weight of 4,010 lbs the testers clocked 14.25 seconds at 101 mph. The car had a Turbo-Hydramatic 400 3-speed automatic transmission and came equipped with air conditioning, an option that added considerable weight to the car and engine. Output was at 4,400 RPM. A production line stock 1974 SD455 produced on a chassis dyno, as reported by &quot;High-Performance Pontiac&quot; magazine (January 2007). This is consistent with the 290 SAE net horsepower factory rating (as measured at the crankshaft).

A 1974 Firebird was driven by Jim Rockford in the pilot movie and the first season (1974–1975) of &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;; every following season, Rockford would change to the next model year. However, in the sixth season (1979–1980), Rockford continued to drive the 1978 Firebird from season five, as the star, James Garner, disliked the 1979 model&#x27;s restyled front end. The cars in the show were badged as a lower-tier bronze-coloured Firebird Esprit, however, these cars were in actuality de-badged Firebird Formula 400&#x27;s that had the twin-scoop hood replaced with a standard flat base model Firebird hood. At many points throughout the show, the twin exhausts and rear anti-roll bars were visible, which were not available on the Esprit.

===1975===
The 1975 models featured new wraparound rear windows that curved out to occupy more of the B-Pillars, but the rear body shape and bumper remained unchanged. The turn signals were moved up from the valance panel to the grills which helped distinguish the 1975 from the 1974 front end as they are otherwise similar. This was also the last year of the larger profile larger snout Formula hood for the Firebird Formula.

The LS2 Super Duty engine and Turbo-Hydramatic 400 three-speed automatic were no longer available in 1975. Due to the use of catalytic converters starting in 1975, the TH400 would not fit alongside the catalytic converter underneath the vehicle. The smaller Turbo-Hydramatic 350 3-speed automatic was deemed suitable as the power output for the engine had significantly decreased from the earlier years. The TH350 drew less power and also did not require an electronic kick down system. The Pontiac L78 400 was standard in the Trans Am and the 455 was optional for both 1975 and 1976 models.

1975 also saw the start of the &quot;500557&quot; (in addition to similar cast codes starting with 5) cast 400 engine blocks entering production. The 500557 blocks were considered a weaker cast, as they had a lower nickel content, and had metal shaved off in the lower journals of the block to decrease the overall weight and cost. These blocks were used until the W72 engine reverted to the original specifications from the start of the decade with the 481988 cast in late 1977.

Originally, the L75 455 7.5L V8 was dropped entirely, but it returned mid-year, available only with a four-speed Borg Warner Super T-10, and it was no longer available for the Formula. Although it was brought back as the &quot;455 HO&quot;, it was not the same engine as the 1971-1972 LS2 455 HO seen in the earlier Firebirds. It was a standard D-port engine with a low profile camshaft and restrictive exhaust system that was also seen in the larger body Pontiac platforms. Power output was restricted to 200 HP with a torque rating of 330 lb⋅ft at 2,000 rpm. It was the largest displacement &quot;performance&quot; engine still available. Track testing in 1975 showed the 455 capable of 16.12-second quarter-mile time, which was similar to the L82 Corvette.

===1976===
The 1976 model year saw a revision to the design and had done away with the rubber bumperettes on the front and back bumpers. Instead, the body featured a sleeker design with polyurethane front and rear bumpers that adhered to the safety standards at the time. The interior design was unchanged from the standard interior, however, the deluxe interior seats had changed to feature larger and deeper buckets. The engine options across the Firebird remained the same as the previous year. This was the last year for the optional 15x7 honeycomb wheels. 1976 marked the end of the Pontiac L75 455 7.5L V8, as it could no longer meet the tightening emissions restrictions, and the &quot;HO&quot; moniker used the year prior was dropped. The L75 was only available with a four-speed manual Borg Warner Super T-10 and was exclusive to the Trans Am.

1976 also introduced the &quot;W50 appearance package&quot; for the Formula model line, consisting of a two-tone appearance package with lower accents across the bottom of the body, a large &quot;Formula&quot; decal across the bottom of each door, and a Firebird decal on the rear spoiler. The Formula had a one-year exclusive steel hood design with smaller recessed, less pronounced hood snorkels for this model year.

Pontiac celebrated its 50th anniversary year in 1976. To commemorate this event, Pontiac unveiled a special Trans Am option at the 1976 Chicago Auto Show. Designated the RPO code Y82, it was painted in black with gold accents, this was the first &quot;anniversary&quot; Trans Am package and the first production black and gold special edition. A removable T-top developed by Hurst was set to be included on all Y82 50th Anniversary T/As, but proved problematic in installation and quality control, leading most Y82s to not be delivered with the Hurst T-top roof. All Hurst T-top equipped cars were built at the Norwood, Ohio, factory. 110 of the Y82s equipped with the L75 455 engine received the Hurst T-tops.

T-Tops became a regular production option for other Firebirds in 1977. The Y82 option included exclusive black and gold decals, gold pinstriping along the body of the car, a Formula steering wheel with gold spokes and horn button, gold honeycomb 15x7 wheels, gold window crank covers (if ordered with power windows), a gold shifter button for automatic cars, and a gold aluminum machined dash bezel with a black outline.

===1977===
The 1977 Firebird received a facelift that featured four rectangular headlamps. The shaker scoop was also revised for this year, with the early 1977-built T/As coming with off-center, lower-profile shaker scoops. The Formula hood was changed for the last time for the second generation with a much lower profile. The snowflake wheel became an option for all Firebirds and was standard with the Y82 appearance package, although it could be replaced with Rally II wheels as a credit option.

For the Esprit, an optional appearance package RPO W60 called the &quot;Skybird appearance package&quot; became available, featuring an all-blue exterior and interior. This package was originally slated to be called the &quot;Bluebird&quot; similar to the &quot;Yellowbird&quot; and &quot;Redbird&quot; packages to follow in the upcoming model years, but the name was already in use for a company that produced school buses.

In 1977, General Motors began to source a larger selection of V8 engines to supply in the lower model Firebirds, and the Oldsmobile 350 (5.7L) &amp; 403 (6.6L) V8, as well as the Chevrolet 305 (5.0L) &amp; 350 (5.7L) V8, became options for the Firebird, Esprit, and Formula after June 1977. Previously, the Chevrolet inline-six was the only outsourced engine in a Firebird. Pontiac made the 301 (4.9 L) V8 available for order in the lower Firebird models, but due to such high demand and popularity, they removed its availability from the Firebird model to allow enough 301 engines for the other Pontiac lines. It was re-introduced as an option in 1979 as production for the 400 ceased and tooling was converted over to the 301.

The Trans Am now had three different engine options, the standard Pontiac L78 400, the optional extra-cost Pontiac W72 400, and the Oldsmobile-sourced L80 403. The 1977 models also saw the cubic inch numbers on the shaker switched in favor of the metric displacement. The shakers had a &quot;6.6 Litre&quot; decal for all L78 Pontiac 400 and L80 Oldsmobile 403 engines. Only the optional W72 Pontiac 400 received the &quot;T/A 6.6&quot; decal.

As Pontiac had discontinued the 455 in the previous model year, a modified 400 Pontiac V8 dubbed the &quot;T/A 6.6&quot; with the RPO W72 became available as a pay-extra upgrade to the standard L78 400. It came featured with a tuned four-barrel 800CFM Rochester Quadrajet carburetor and was rated at at 3,600 rpm and a maximum torque of at 2,400 rpm, as opposed to the regular &quot;6.6 Litre&quot; 400 (RPO L78) rated at . The T/A 6.6 engine also came equipped with chrome valve covers, while the base 400 engines had blue painted valve covers. For 1977, the W72 shared the same air cleaner and shared the same 500577 cast block as the L78, but received the 6x4 heads, whereas the L78 only received the lower compression 6x8 heads. The 6x4 heads were used on early Pontiac 350 blocks that helped increase the compression and also had hardened valve seats for a higher RPM operating range.

The Oldsmobile 403 was implemented as the 400 Pontiac could not satisfy emissions requirements for high-altitude states and California. Wanting to still offer a 6.6 L option for the Trans Am, the 403 Olds was seen as a suitable replacement as when equipped with an A.I.R emissions system, it could satisfy the emissions criteria for these states and still offer the power ratings expected of the Trans Am. The L80 Oldsmobile 403 V8 had slightly more power than the standard L78 Pontiac 400 at 185 hp (138 kW) and offered the same low-end torque of 320 lb⋅ft (430 N⋅m) at a more usable operating range of 2,200rpm.

From 1977 until 1981, the Firebird used four square headlamps, while the Camaro continued to retain the two round headlights that had been shared by both second-generation designs. The 1977 Trans Am Y82 Special Edition gained significant fame after its film debut in &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot;, leading to a drastic increase in sales of the Pontiac Firebird in the following years, and its current day collectability.

===1978===

Changes for 1978 were slight, with a switch from a honeycomb to a crosshatch pattern grille being the most notable change to the body style. The decals for the standard Trans Ams changed from the &quot;looping style&quot; lettering to the &quot;block-style&quot; font that would remain on the Firebird until the end of the second generation. The optional T-Tops transitioned from Hurst installed units to Fisher units designed and created &quot;in-house&quot; by GM in mid-year 1978. Pontiac also introduced the Red Bird package on the Firebird Esprit model. Painted in Code 72 Roman Red with a matching deluxe Carmine Red interior, it demonstrated gold accents with a unique Red Bird graphic on the exterior b-pillars. It also included a Formula steering wheel with gold spokes and gold dash bezel, similar to the ones included in the Special Edition package, however, the red and gold steering wheel was exclusive to the Red Bird Esprit.

A new appearance package on offer for the Trans Am was the gold Y88 Special Appearance package, available for order in late 1977. It was a new variation of the black Y82 Special Appearance Package and featured an all-gold color pallet, exclusive gold mirrored T-Tops, 15x7 snowflake aluminum wheels, and a new 5-color gold hood decal. All Y88s were painted in paint code 51 Solar Gold and always featured code 62 Camel Tan interior, however, the WS6 Special Performance Package, deluxe interior and tan-colored seatbelts were still pay-extra options. The Y88 featured brown pinstriping, as opposed to the gold pinstriping on the Y82/Y84 package, and included the new design 5-color hood decal and block-style gold font callouts. The Y88 SE debuted the Fisher-style T-Top roof and featured special gold tinted Fisher glass tops exclusive to the Y88. There are no confirmed documented examples of hard-top Y88s made. The Y88 was discontinued due to problems Pontiac experienced with the Solar Gold paint such as streaking in the paint, or a green discoloration with the water-based paint used at the Van Nuys assembly plant. It was then changed back to the black Y84 (replaced RPO Y82) Special Appearance package for the remainder of the 1978 Special Edition Trans Ams built.

The W72 engine option also saw a revision to the camshaft duration and the tuning of the Rochester Quadrajet which led to a 10% increase in horsepower from the prior year, bringing the total to 220 hp. Additionally, the earlier stronger and more durable 481988 cast block returned on the W72, denoted with a large &quot;XX&quot; cast protruding on the side of the block near the cast code. The WS6 Trans Am Special Performance package developed by Herb Adams was introduced as a handling option for the Trans Am, including a larger diameter rear sway bar, tighter ratio steering box, 15x8-inch snowflake wheels, additional frame bracing, as well as other suspension changes. Initially, the W72 engine was bundled in with the WS6 package, but mid-year, the options separated and became two pay-extra items on the dealer invoice. Delays in manufacturing prevented the rear disc brake (RPO J65) from being available in the 1978 model year. Approximately 23.1% (28,239) of Trans Ams in 1978 had the WS6 option according to Pontiac sales information at the start of 1979.

===1979===
The body was completely restyled for 1979, featuring a new aerodynamic front end, revised rear end spoiler, larger flares for the Trans Am, and a revised connected single taillight assembly design that would remain consistent for the rest of the Firebird&#x27;s design. The grilles had been repositioned to the lower section of the front bumper to allow more cold air to travel directly to the lower part of the radiator and engine bay. The interior remained mostly unchanged from the previous model year, however, the deluxe cloth interior had now changed from velour to a Hobnail pattern. The hood decal from the Y88 SE and Solar Gold cars from 1978 became the standard design across the entire Trans Am line and now came in a variety of colors. The Formula steering wheel that was optional in the lower models and standard in the Trans Am now came color coded to the interior.

For 1979, there were three possible engine options. The L80 Oldsmobile 403 6.6L V8 engine became the standard option and was only available with the Turbo Hydramatic 350 3-speed automatic. The W72 Pontiac 400 6.6L V8 was available for a short period and in limited supply. This was the last of the line for the Pontiac large displacement V8 engines, and only available with the 4-speed manual Borg-Warner Super T-10 transmission, while also requiring the WS6 handling package as mandatory equipment in conjunction with this driveline choice. A credit option was available, being the smaller displacement L37 Pontiac 301 4.9L V8, and it could come with either the Super T-10 four-speed manual transmission or the Turbo Hydramatic 350 3-speed automatic.

The Formula received some revisions for the 1979 model year, where the two-tone W50 colored stripe decal now became the standard look for the Formula, however, the W50 package was still available and it added the &quot;Formula&quot; lettering along the bottom of the doors and rear deck spoiler. The WS6 package had now been renamed from the &quot;Trans Am Mk IV Special Handling Package&quot; to the &quot;Special Handling Package&quot; as it was now available for the Firebird Formula. The dashboard bezel now wore the same machined swirl aluminum bezel as the Trans Am. As the Pontiac 301 had now ramped up production as the Pontiac 400 production had ceased, it became the standard engine for the Formula. Due to significant popularity and demand for the option to receive 4-wheel disc brakes in the WS6 handling package, some WS6 equipped cars were shipped without the option of rear disc brakes and were instead coded WS7, but still received all other equipment included in the WS6 package.
A limited-edition Firebird to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the 1969 Firebird Trans Am was produced for the 1979 model year. It featured platinum silver paint with charcoal gray upper paint accents, mirrored T-tops, 15x8&quot; &quot;Turbo&quot; wheels, a special interior featuring silver leather seats with custom-embroidered Firebird emblems, and aircraft-inspired red lighting for the gauges. Colloquially known as the &quot;TATA&quot; (Tenth Anniversary Trans Am), it featured every single available production option on the Firebird, however, cruise control was not compatible with the manual transmission resulting in the option being credited on the window sticker for the 4-speed equipped TATAs. The TATA also featured special 10th-anniversary decals, including a Firebird hood decal that extended off of the hood and onto the front fenders. Pontiac produced 7,500 Y89 TATAs (RPO Y89), of which 1,817 were equipped with the Pontiac &quot;T/A 6.6&quot; W72 400 engine and 4-speed manual transmission. The remainder all featured the L80 Oldsmobile 403 and automatic 3-speed transmission. Two TATAs were the actual pace cars for the 1979 Daytona 500, which had been dubbed &quot;the race that made NASCAR&quot;.

&quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine named the Trans Am equipped with the WS6 Special Performance Package the best handling car of 1979. During period dyno testing, the National Hot Rod Association rated the &quot;T/A 6.6&quot; W72 Pontiac 400 engine at 260–280 net horsepower, which was significantly higher than Pontiac&#x27;s conservative rating of 220 hp. In 1979 Pontiac sold 116,535 Trans Ams, the highest sold in any Firebird model year.

===1980===
In 1980, ever-increasing emissions restrictions led Pontiac to drop all of its large-displacement engines. The year saw the biggest engine changes for the Trans Am. The 301, offered in 1979 as a credit option, was now the standard engine. No manual transmission was available for the Firebird in 1980, all received the 3-speed automatic Turbo Hydramatic 350. Dealer order information listed a 3-speed manual available with the Buick V6 in the base model Firebird, however, none were ordered or built.

Optional engines for the Trans Am and Formula included a turbocharged 301 4.9L V8 or the LG4 Chevrolet 305 5.0L V8 small block. The Chevrolet 305 was mandatory in Californian and High Altitude emission states. There were three different iterations of the 301 in 1980, the L37 301, the W72 301 E/C &quot;T/A 4.9&quot;, and the LU8 301 Turbo. The W72 E/C 301 was standard for the Trans Am and optional for the Formula, however, the W72 E/C could be deleted on the Trans Am and instead come equipped with the standard L37 301 with a credit. The turbocharged 301 used a Garrett TB305 turbo attached to a single Rochester Quadrajet four-barrel carburetor and featured a hood-mounted &quot;boost&quot; gauge that would light up as the TB305 accumulated boost. The hood of the 301T equipped Firebirds had a large offset bulge to accommodate for the mounting position of the carburetor on the engine as the turbocharger exhaust occupied a large amount of space in the engine bay. The 301T equipped cars were restricted to an automatic transmission, a 3.08 rear differential ratio, and were required to have A/C. A memo from Pontiac to dealers in late 1980 mandated that all 301T cars must be ordered with J65 rear disc brakes or the orders would be rejected. However, the WS6 Special Handling Package was never mandatory with the 301 Turbo.

The Redbird Esprit was discontinued in 1980, and the new Yellowbird Esprit was introduced. This was the last year to feature the colored Esprit appearance packages. It featured a two-tone yellow exterior with yellow snowflake wheels, a deluxe Camel Tan interior, a gold dash bezel, special yellow Firebird decals, and a Formula steering wheel.
The new Limited Edition Trans Am produced for 1980 was the Y85 Turbo Trans Am Pace Car that was featured in the Indianapolis 500 race series. A total of 5,700 Pace Cars were made. Standard on the Y85 included mirrored T-Tops, a special hood and paint decal that covered the hood and roof, 15x8-inch aluminum Turbo wheels, the 301 cu in (4.9 L) Turbo, the WS6 handling package, an exclusive embroidered oyster Hobnail cloth interior, a special digital AM/FM ETR stereo, power windows, Tungsten Halogen headlamps, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel. While some of the options were standard on the Y85 Pace car, many options were still extra (unlike the Y89 TATA which had all possible options standard), such as power door locks, power trunk release, tilt steering column, cruise control, etc. The &quot;Official Pace Car&quot; door decals were shipped alongside the car to dealers to install as per customer request or to the dealer&#x27;s liking.

A 1980 Turbo Trans Am Y84 Special Edition was featured in the movie &quot;Smokey and the Bandit II&quot;, but was fitted with nitrous oxide tanks by Marvin Miller Systems to get the desired performance.

===1981===

The 1981 model year became the final run for the second-generation Pontiac Firebird. The three engine options were unchanged for the model line-up, however, the option for a four-speed Borg Warner Super T-10 was re-introduced for the Formula and Trans Am, but was only available with the Chevrolet sourced LG4 305 &quot;5.0 LITRE&quot; V8. The W72 E/C 301 replaced the standard L37 301, so the W72 code was dropped as all 301 engines now featured the Electronic Spark Control system. The 301T became certified to pass Californian and H/A emissions requirements, making it the most powerful Pontiac engine to be sold in California since the mid-1970s, even with a slight power decrease from the previous year. As with all other General Motors vehicles for 1981, all engines came equipped with the &quot;Computer Command Control&quot; (CCC) system attached to the carburetor. The Canadian market and Export Firebird models slightly varied, with the Z49 Canadian delivered Firebirds not receiving any of the computer controlled carburettor systems. The Export Turbo engines received the same Power Enrichment Vacuum Regulator (PEVR) set up as the previous year. Some Canadian base model, Esprit and Formula models received the Chevrolet sourced L39 267cu V8.

The hood decal and lettering for the 1981 model year was also slightly restyled. The fender, rear spoiler and lettered decals were decreased in size. All Firebirds also received an embossed silver Firebird decal on the petrol tank cap attached to the rear taillights. On the special edition Trans Ams, this Firebird was gold. The &quot;Turbo&quot; wheel previously exclusive to the 301 Turbo cars now became available across the Esprit and Formula line in a slightly smaller size (15x7.5&quot; as opposed to the WS6 Formula/Trans Am 15x8&quot;). The interior design remained the same, with options for the seat material and color combinations slightly changing. The deluxe cloth Hobnail material being dropped for the Pimlico cloth material. Millport cloth became available as an option in limited colours for the standard interior. 

The Formula received some changes for the 1981 model year, as previously in 1979-80, the two-tone W50 style paint was standard without the Formula lettering. However, if the W50 package was not ordered, the Formula simply appeared in the body color they were ordered in, with the smaller fender decals. This also prompted an increase in price for the W50 option as the decals were not included in the base Formula package anymore. In mid-1981, the Buick V6 became the standard engine in the Formula.

The G80 &quot;Safe-T-Track&quot; limited-slip differential that was previously standard for the last decade on all Trans Ams became a pay-extra option. This decision was made by Pontiac to prepare dealers for the new ordering and pricing for the third-generation Firebird where RPO G80 was no longer being included as a standard option for the Trans Am.
The new Limited Edition Trans Am on offer was a new iteration of the Y85 Turbo Trans Am Pace Car for the Daytona 500 race series. Instead of the grey/oyster and white color scheme from the year prior, the 1981 Pace Car featured a black and white two-tone exterior accompanied by a deluxe black and red Recaro interior with embroidered Firebirds stitched into the door panels and rear seat. It was the first production General Motors car to feature German manufactured Recaro seats and interior as factory standard equipment, however, Pontiac had used Recaro seats in prototype vehicles such as the 1978-79 Kammaback K-Type station wagon Trans Ams, as well as many dealers and tuner companies installing Recaro seats, such as DKM in the Macho Trans Ams and VSE in the Fire Ams. The Y85 for 1981 was limited to a smaller 2,000 units, and like with the Y85 in 1980, many options on the car were still extra on top of the large base cost of the Pace Car. It came standard with a Delco digital ETR AM/FM Stereo with inbuilt cassette, with an option to credit this stereo for a Delco AM/FM Stereo with inbuilt 40 channel CB radio.

== Third generation (1982–1992) ==

The availability and cost of gasoline (two fuel crises had occurred by this time) meant the weight and the fuel consumption of the third generation had to be considered in the design. In F-body development, both the third-generation Firebird and Camaro were proposed as possible front-wheel-drive platforms, but the idea was scrapped. Computerized engine management was in its infancy, and with fuel efficiency being the primary objective, it was not possible to have high horsepower and torque numbers. They did manage to cut enough weight from the design so that acceleration performance would be better than the 1981 models. They also succeeded in reducing fuel consumption, offering a four-cylinder Firebird that would provide . GM executives decided that engineering effort would best be spent on aerodynamics and chassis development. They created a modern platform so that when engine technology advanced, they would have a well-balanced package with acceleration, braking, handling, and aerodynamics.

The Firebird and Camaro were completely redesigned for the 1982 model year, with the windshield slope set at 62 degrees, (about three degrees steeper than anything GM had ever tried before), and for the first time, a large, glass-dominated hatchback that required no metal structure to support it. Two concealed pop-up headlights, a first on the F-Body cars, were the primary characteristic that distinguished the third-generation Firebird from both its Camaro sibling and its prior form (a styling characteristic carried into the fourth generation&#x27;s design). In addition to being about lighter than the previous design, the new design was the most aerodynamic product GM had ever released. Wind tunnels were used to form the new F-Body platform&#x27;s shape, and Pontiac took full advantage of it. The aerodynamic developments extended to the finned aluminum wheels with smooth hubcaps and a functional rear spoiler.

=== 1988 ===
In 1988 the Trans Am GTA, which was built with the standard 350 cu in 5.7 L V8 engine, was offered with the option of the removable roof &quot;T-tops&quot;. However, any buyer ordering this option could only order the 305 cu in 5.0 L V8 engine, because the roof did not have the support for all the extra torque from the engine, requiring a power trade-off for those who wanted this option. Pontiac also introduced a rare option for the Trans Am GTA in the 1988 model year, the $800 (~$ in ) &quot;notchback&quot;, which replaced the standard long large, glass-dominated hatchback to make the Firebird design look less like the Camaro design, and shared an appearance with the Pontiac Fiero. The notchback was a special fiberglass rear deck lid, replacing the long-sloped window with a short vertical rear window, resembling the back of a Ferrari 288 GTO.

A total of 718 of these Notchbacks were built in 1988. The promotion was only in the form of a sheet in the back of a notebook of available options. They were made by Auto-Fab of Auburn Hills, Michigan. Problems with the incorrect fitting of the notchbacks to the GTAs at the Van Nuys plant often resulted in delays of several months for buyers who wanted this option. Furthermore, quality control problems plagued the notchback, many owners complained of rippling and deforming of the fiberglass rear deck, and others complained of large defects resembling acne forming in the notchbacks. Pontiac had to repair them under warranty, sanding down the imperfections, and repainting them, only to have more flaws resurface months later. Because of the poor quality and numerous expensive warranty repairs and repainting, the notchback was subsequently canceled for the 1989 model year, via a bulletin in August 1988, although production records indicate that a few were produced.

=== 1989 ===
For 1989, most Firebird models were nearly identical to those made in 1988. The Trans-Am GTA and Formula 350 models were fitted with upgraded Corvette 5.7 Liter L98 Engines, replacing the 5.7 Liter L98 engine version that powered the 1987 and 1988 models. The L98 was not a factory option on the non-GTA version of the Trans Am in 1989, which was downgraded to only feature the 5.0 Liter LB9 Engine. The Formula and GTA models sold with manual transmissions all featured the LB9 engines as well.

In 1989, Pontiac made a limited edition 20th Anniversary Turbo Trans Am, which was the Indianapolis 500 Pace Car that year. The 20th Anniversary model featured the 3.8-liter turbocharged Buick engine used in the 1987 GNX, with two modifications: re-engineered cylinder heads (because the F-Body had less engine room than the G-body) with 8:1 instead of 9:1 compression, and upgraded turbocharger components that provided extra boost (16 psi vs. 14 psi for the Buick GNX). The Turbo Trans Am came with a 5-year 50,000-mile warranty rather than the 12-month 12,000-mile warranty that applied to the Buick GNX. Though officially rated at and , dynamometer testing of the 20th Anniversary model tests regularly recorded over 300 horsepower. Hagerty reported that the Turbo Trans Am was 0.1 second faster than the GNX in both 0-60 mph and 1/4-mile tests.

The 20th Anniversary Trans Am also featured Chevrolet&#x27;s high-performance &#x27;police-Camaro&#x27; 1LE brakes, and it was the first Indy-500 Pace Car that did not require an engine, suspension, and other performance upgrades and modifications to handle Pace Car duties at Indianapolis.

The 20th Anniversary Trans Am was the last &#x27;anniversary&#x27; model to feature more than a custom interior and special exterior paint trim.

== Fourth generation (1993–2002) ==
The fourth-generation Firebird amplified the aerodynamic styling initiated by the previous generation. While the live rear axle and floorpan aft of the front seats remained largely the same, ninety percent of the Firebird&#x27;s parts were all-new. Overall, the styling of the Firebird more strongly reflected the Banshee IV concept car than the 1991 &quot;facelift&quot; did. As with the Camaro, major improvements included standard dual airbags, four-wheel anti-lock brakes, 16-inch wheels, rack-and-pinion power steering, short/long-arm front suspension, and several non-rusting composite body panels. Throughout its fourth generation, trim levels included the V6-powered Firebird, V8-powered Formula, and Trans Am. Standard manual transmissions were the T5 five-speed manual for the V6s, Borg-Warner′s T56 six-speed manual for the V8s. The 4L60 four-speed automatic was optional for both in 1993, becoming the 4L60E with built-in electronic controls in 1994.

===1993–1997===
From 1993 until 1995 (1995 non-California cars), Firebirds received a 3.4 L V6, an enhanced version of the third-generation&#x27;s 3.1 L V6. Beginning mid-year 1995 onward, a Series II 3.8 L V6 with became the Firebird&#x27;s sole engine. From 1993 until 1997, the sole engine for the Formula and Trans Am was the 5.7 L LT1 V8, essentially identical to the LT1 in the C4 Corvette except for more flow-restrictive intake and exhaust systems.
Steering wheel audio controls were included with optional uplevel cassette or compact disc stereo systems.

Beginning with 1994 model year cars, &quot;Delco 2001&quot;-series stereo systems replaced the previous Delco units. This revised series, also introduced for other Pontiac car lines, featured ergonomically designed control panels with larger buttons and an optional seven-band graphic equalizer. Also in 1994, the fourth-generation convertible was available; every Firebird (and Camaro) convertible featured a glass rear window with a built-in electric defroster.

The 1995 models were the same as those of previous years, but traction control (ASR: acceleration slip regulation) was available for LT1 Firebirds, controlled by a switch on the console. The steering wheels in all Firebirds were also changed; their optional built-in audio controls were more closely grouped on each side. The &quot;Trans Am GT&quot; trim level was dropped from the lineup after its model year run in 1994. For 1995, all Trans Ams received 155-mph speedometers and Z-rated tires. 1995 was also the first year of the vented version of the Opti-Spark distributors on LT1 F-cars, addressing a common mechanical fault with the unit. The &#x27;transmission perform&#x27; button was available only in the 1994 and 1995 Formula and Trans Am. This option was stopped for the 1996 and later models, but the unused connections remain available for the 1996 and 1997 Formula and Trans Am. While 1995 cars still used the OBD-I (on-board diagnostic) computer system (the last year of any American car including the F-body to use OBD-I), a majority of them had OBD-II connector ports under the dash.

Firebird performance levels improved for 1996, with the establishment of the stronger 200-hp 3.8 L V6 as the new base engine, and the power rating of the LT1 increased to 285 for 1996, due to its new dual catalytic-converter exhaust system. 1996 was also the first model year of the OBD-II computer system. Optional performance enhancements were available for each Firebird trim level; the Y87 performance packages for V6s added mechanical features of the V8 setups, such as four-wheel disc brakes, faster-response steering, limited-slip rear differential, and dual tailpipes. For Formulas and Trans Ams, functional dual-inlet &quot;Ram Air&quot; hoods returned as part of the WS6 performance package. The optional package boosted rated horsepower from 285 to 305, and torque from 325 lb·ft to 335. Also included were 17x9-inch wheels with 275/40ZR17 tires, suspension improvements, oval-shaped dual tailpipe tips, and a WS6 badge. Bilstein shocks was a further option with the package.

The 1997 model year introduced standard air conditioning, daytime running lamps (utilizing the front turn signal lamps), a digital odometer, and optional 500-watt Monsoon cassette or compact disc stereo systems to all Firebird trim levels. For V6 Firebirds, a W68 sport appearance package was also introduced as a counterpart to the Camaro RS trim level. The WS6 &quot;Ram Air&quot; performance package was now also an option for the Formula and Trans Am convertibles, although these convertibles did not receive the 17-inch wheel-and-tire combination. There were 41 Formula convertibles and 463 Trans Am convertibles produced from 1996 until 1997 with the WS6 package.

===1998–2002===
In 1997, in relation to the Camaro, the Firebird received a mid-cycle refresh for the 1998 model year. Major changes included a new hood and front fascia with dual intakes, retracting quad halogen headlights, circular turn signals and fog lamps, a front license plate pocket, lower fender air vents, unified-style lower door raised lettering for each trim level, and a new &quot;honeycomb&quot; rear light panel, with circular reverse lamps. In the dashboard, &quot;next-generation&quot; reduced-force dual airbags became standard. As before, the Formula and Trans Am again received a close derivative of the Corvette&#x27;s 5.7 L V8, the LS1 of the C5 Corvette, as the LT1 (and LT4) V8s were discontinued. The LS1 Firebirds were also equipped with an aluminum driveshaft, replacing the previous steel version, while all Firebird trim levels gained four-wheel disc brakes with dual-piston front calipers and larger rotors at each wheel, complete with a solenoid-based Bosch anti-lock system. The Formula convertible was no longer offered.

Beginning in 1998 for 1999 models, a standard 16.8-gallon non-metallic fuel tank increased the potential traveling range. GM&#x27;s ASR traction control system was extended to the V6-powered Firebirds, and all LS1 (V8) and Y87 (V6) Firebirds also received a Zexel/Torsen II slip-reduction rear axle. An electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD) system replaced the old hydraulic proportioning valve for improved brake performance. An enhanced sensing and diagnostic module (SDM) recorded vehicle speed, engine rpm, throttle position, and brake use in the last five seconds prior to airbag deployment. In 1999, a Hurst shifter for variants with the 6-speed manual and a power steering cooler became options for LS1 Firebirds.

In 2000, the WS6 performance package was available exclusively for the 2001 model year Trans Am coupe and convertible variants.

In 2002, more convenience items such as power mirrors and power antennae became standard equipment, while cassette stereos were phased out.

===Special editions===

===Firehawk===

The Firehawk was first sold as a production vehicle in 1992. The 1992 Firehawk models were modified Formula 350s with major engine, intake, suspension, and other upgrades, including the Chevrolet Corvette ZR-1&#x27;s 6-speed transmission. Producing over 350 HP (269 KW) and 390 lb-ft of torque (526 N-m), they were the fastest and most powerful regular production Firebirds ever made available through Pontiac dealers (RPO code: B4U).
 The special modifications were done by SLP (Street Legal Performance) Engineering, in Tom&#x27;s River, New Jersey. Those performance upgrades pushed the price to $40,000 (and there was an extra special street racing upgrade for another $10,000, which included the same brakes used on the Ferrari F40). Consequently, only 25 of the &#x27;regular&#x27; Firehawks were sold, and only 2 of the race models were sold during the 1992 model year, making the 1992 Firehawk an extremely rare vehicle.
 The 1992 models are the only 3rd-generation F-Body Firehawks.

The special-edition extra-performance Firehawk (available in Formula trim for 1993–1997, and again in both Formula and Trans Am trims for 1999–2002) was produced by SLP Engineering, Inc., and sold through Pontiac dealerships. Featuring 17-inch wheels with namesake Firestone Firehawk 275/40ZR17 tires along with a functional twin-inlet hood above a specific air cleaner box, its rated power increased to and 330 lb·ft (445 Nm) of torque. A total of 201 Firehawks were built in 1993. In 1994, the Firehawk package was expanded to include options for a suspension upgrade as well as a larger-diameter exhaust system that increased power to . T-top Formula coupes and convertibles could also be optioned as Firehawks beginning in 1995. For 1996 and 1997, the Firehawk gained rectangular driving lights mounted inside the front scoops and (except for Firehawk convertibles) the Trans Am&#x27;s elevated rear wing. In 1997, an LT4 Firehawk was also available, utilizing the same , balanced-and-blueprinted LT4 V8 engine as found in the manual-transmission 1996 Corvette. A total of 29 LT4-powered Firehawks were produced.

Power levels for the 1999 Firehawk, powered by the LS1 V8, rose to (330 in 2000, 335 in 2001, and 345 in late 2002 models equipped with the &quot;Blackwing&quot; intake). A 10th-anniversary Firehawk was available in 2001, distinguished as a black Trans Am coupe (123 units) and convertible (16 units) with gold-painted hood stripes (prototype only), gold vinyl stripes on hood and spoiler (production), gold 17-inch wheels, and gold tailpipe tips.

===1994 Trans Am GT===
In 1994 only, a &quot;Trans Am GT&quot; option was available. Trans Am GTs did not receive any special badging, graphics, or emblems, and looked externally identical to the base Trans Am cars. The GT package included 245/50ZR16 tires and a 155-mph speedometer. Non-GT optioned Trans Ams in 1994 received 235/55R16 tires, a 115-mph speedometer, and a much lower top-speed limiter. The &quot;highrise spoiler&quot;, leather, and T-tops were not standard on the Trans Am GT cars in 1994, nor any year of the LT1 Trans Am. RPO code T43 &quot;uplevel spoiler&quot; was an option on all Trans Ams, and while the mass majority of 1994 Trans Am GT cars received the T43 spoiler (along with the majority of all 1993–1997 Trans Ams), it was not part of the Trans Am GT package. Both base Trans Ams and Trans am GTs could be ordered as a coupe, T-top, or convertible versions and were both available with automatic or manual transmissions. While the GT package was a cost option on the 1994 Trans Am, a majority of 1994 Trans Ams were made with the GT package.

All of the 1994 Trans Am GT options became standard in 1995–2002 as part of the Trans Am package, and the GT name/package was dropped for 1995. Some of the early fourth-generation Trans Am and Formula Firebirds list &quot;GT&quot; on the vehicle&#x27;s title or registration. The reason is that the VIN does not specify a &quot;package&quot; (Formula, Trans Am, Trans Am GT, Firehawk, etc.); it only specifies the engine (5.7 L V8 LT1). Because the title is based on the VIN alone, titles and registrations often list all of the packages, but it does not mean the car is equipped with any certain package.

===1994 25th-anniversary Trans Am===
The 1994 model year marked the 25th anniversary of the Trans Am, and another anniversary edition was released, painted white with a single dark blue stripe down the center of the vehicle that was reminiscent of the 1970 Trans Am. It also featured white-painted, five-spoke, 16-inch alloy wheels, white leather seats, and door trim. This edition was available in either coupe, T-top, or convertible form.

===1999 30th-anniversary Trans Am===
As with the previous 25th-anniversary edition, the 30th-anniversary edition was either a white WS6 convertible or WS6 T-top coupe, with twin dark blue stripes from hood to tail, and distinct blue anodized five-spoke 17-inch alloy A-mold wheels, with white leather seats and door trim.

2001 was the 75th anniversary of Pontiac. A 75th-anniversary package incorporated a power and performance package that included power door locks including retained accessory power, power windows including express down drivers side, dual power sport mirrors, and power antenna. Radio, ETR AM/FM stereo with CD player and 7-band graphic equalizer including a clock, seek up/down, remote CD pre-wiring Monsoon 500-watt peak power with 10-speaker premium sound system and steering wheel leather-wrapped w/driver touch radio controls. 4-speed automatic transmission, power drivers 6-way seat, security package (includes theft-deterrent system and remote key-less entry), 3800 performance package that included 3.42 gears with &quot;posi-trac&quot; Zexel Torsen T2 limited-slip differential, 4-wheel disc brakes, dual mufflers, and an LS1 steering rack= 14.4:1, 235/55/16 tires, hatch roof, removable, 16-inch chromed aluminum wheels, 50-state low emission vehicle. There were a total of 472 of these packages sold in 2001, No. 239 on the L36 Firebird, 231 on the Formula W66 coupe, 5 on Formula Firehawks, and 2 on Trans-Ams. The manufacturer original window stickers included this as a separate package listing the items and one price.

===2002 collector&#x27;s edition Trans Am===
For the Firebird&#x27;s final year, a collector&#x27;s edition Trans Am was released as either a yellow WS6 convertible or WS6 T-top coupe, with twin black stripes from hood to tail, black-painted five-spoke 17-inch alloy wheels, and further black-trimmed body details.

=== Engines ===


== Firebird Trans Am ==


The Trans Am was a specialty package for the Firebird, typically upgrading handling, suspension, and horsepower, as well as minor appearance modifications such as exclusive hoods, spoilers, fog lights and wheels. Introduced for 1969, it continued throughout the Firebird&#x27;s production run.

Despite its name, the Trans Am was not initially used in the Trans Am Series, as its smallest engine exceeded the SCCA&#x27;s five-liter displacement limit.

The Firebird Trans Am was selected as the Official Pace Car for the 1979 Daytona 500, 1980 Indianapolis 500, and again for the 1981 Daytona 500.

The Trans Am GTA (Gran Turismo Americano) was an options package available on the Firebird Trans Am which added gold 16-inch diamond-spoke alloy wheels, a monochromatic paint scheme, and special cloisonné GTA badges. The GTA (along with the Formula model that was intended to fill the gap between the base model Firebird and mid-level Trans Am) was the brainchild of former Pontiac marketing manager Lou Wassel. It was intended to be the &quot;ultimate&quot; Trans Am and was the most expensive Firebird available. The GTA equipment package officially went on sale in 1987 and avoided a gas-guzzler tax thanks to its lightweight PW 16-inch gold cross-lace wheels. The high-performance WS6 suspension package was also re-tuned to offer a more compliant ride while still maintaining tight handling characteristics. Engine choices consisted of an L98 TPI V8 mated to GM&#x27;s corporate 700R4 automatic transmission or the TPI V8. A five-speed manual was available but was mated to the 5.0 L only. The GTA trim level was available from 1987 through the 1992 model year.

For 1989, the 20th-anniversary turbo Trans Am project (originally conceived by Bill Owen of Pontiac) was outsourced to PAS, Inc., an engineering firm led by Jeff Beitzel. Beitzel and his team did most of the TTA development work. The 3.8 L turbocharged V6 engines were built by PAS at their 40,000 square foot City of Industry, CA plant. From there, they went to GM&#x27;s plant in Van Nuys, CA to be installed into GTAs on the F-Body assembly line. The cars were then shipped back to PAS for final assembly, testing, and quality control. Incidentally, the GTA chassis were selected at random, thus there is no correlation between the VIN and production sequence number. The initial number of cars to be produced ranged from 500 to 2,500 until GM finally settled on 1,500. In all, a total of 1,555 Turbo Trans Ams were manufactured. One of these served as the 1989 Indianapolis 500 pace car.

The 2002 model-year WS6 Trans Am produced at 5,200 rpm and of torque at 4,000 rpm out of its 5.7 L LS1 V8 engine. A stock WS6 completed the in 13.16 seconds at on Eagle F1 street tires.

==Post–Pontiac Trans Am==

In 2012, General Motors signed a licensing deal with Trans Am Depot to use the Trans Am name and Pontiac logos in custom coach built versions of new Trans Am. Under this agreement, Trans Am Depot takes brand-new model Chevrolet Camaros, strips them down to their basic components and rebuilds what looks like a new Trans Am. They make these in the designs of the 6T9 version Trans Am, 6T9 Goat (&quot;GTO&quot;), 7T7 Trans Am and the limited-edition Hurst Trans Am.

On March 26, 2017, at the New York International Auto Show, the Bandit Edition Trans Am was introduced. Built by Trans Am Depot, only 77 will be produced, each signed by Burt Reynolds. Powertrain is a direct injection version of the current Generation V LT1 V8 engine equipped with a Magnuson supercharger with a boost of , developing and of torque.

=== Burt Reynolds collection of Firebirds ===
On April 14, 2018, at the Barrett-Jackson collector car auction in Palm Beach, FL, just 5 months before his death, actor Burt Reynolds presided over the sale of 3 Pontiac Firebird Trans Ams from his personal collection, sold via Bandit Movie Cars of Florida, the custodian of the Burt Reynolds collection. He was also an avid Firebird collector after filming the &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot; movie series and &quot;Hooper&quot;. The first car was a red 1977 Firebird Trans Am survivor car from the Restore a Muscle Car Collection with a price of $57,200 (~$ in ). The second vehicle was a rare 1974 Pontiac Trans AM 455 Super Duty, which was another survivor that reached $100,000 (~$ in ) plus 10% buyer commission. The third car Reynolds sold was a 1980 Indianapolis Pace car turbo Trans Am, which was also $100,000, (~$ in ) plus 10% buyer commission.

== Performance (Firebird / Firebird Trans Am) ==
== Racing ==
Firebirds were used in the Trans-Am series in the 1960s and 1970s. When the Firebird Trans-Am was released, there was controversy over the model&#x27;s inability to compete in the Trans-Am because the smallest available engine was too large for use in the series at 400 cubic inches (6.6 L). The name also caused controversy because it was used without permission from the SCCA, who threatened the suit. GM settled the dispute by paying $5 to the SCCA for each car they sold. When the Trans-Am was last seen, the model year 2002 Firebirds were in use. From 1996 to 2006, a WS6 Trans Am coupe provided the body style for the mechanically identical racing cars used in the International Race of Champions (IROC).

During the 1995, 1996, and 1997 NHRA seasons, 14-time funny car champion John Force used a Firebird body to replace the obsolete Oldsmobile Cutlass and Chevrolet Lumina bodies he had used since 1988. He used it for three seasons, winning the championship in all three years. The Firebird was also used by drivers such as Del Worsham, Tim Wilkerson, Frank Pedregon, and Jerry Toliver. The Firebird body also replaced the Oldsmobile Cutlass in the pro stock class in 1995, forcing drivers Warren Johnson, Jerry Eckman, and Mark Pawuk to replace their body styles for the 1996 year. None of them would win with the first year of the Firebird body, but pro stock driver Jim Yates, a second-year driver, using the Firebird body, did.

<text>Karen Lea Wynn Fonstad (April 18, 1945 – March 11, 2005) was an American cartographer and academic who designed several atlases of fictional worlds, including her 1981 &quot;The Atlas of Middle-earth&quot; about J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s creations.

== Early life and education ==

Born Karen Lea Wynn in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma to parents James and Estis Wynn. She was raised in Norman, Oklahoma where he father ran a sheet metal shop. She graduated from Norman High School, and then earned a B.S. degree in Physical Therapy in 1967, from the University of Oklahoma. In 1968, she was among the first women accepted into the school&#x27;s geography graduate program, where she wrote a style manual of cartographic symbology as her master’s thesis. While at the University she met Todd A. Fonstad, also in the geography department. They married in 1970, and in 1971 moved to Wisconsin where Todd taught at the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh.They had two children. 

== Mapping Middle-earth ==

A friend lent Fonstad a copy of Tolkien&#x27;s work and she became enchanted. &quot;I doubt if any other book or books will ever grasp my interest as much as these,&quot; she wrote in her journal in 1975. &quot;Each time I finish a reading I immediately feel as if I hadn&#x27;t read them for weeks and I am lonely for them — lonely for the characters within the books, the tremendously vivid descriptions, the whole essence.&quot; &quot;Her son said she had read &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; some 30 times before pitching the atlas.&quot; &quot;The Atlas of Middle-earth&quot;, published in 1981, provides detailed maps of the lands of Middle-earth. The maps are treated as if they are of real landscapes, drawn according to the rules of a real atlas, and taking into account each land&#x27;s history and geology.

==Career==

Before her &quot;retirement&quot; to raising children and writing companion atlases, Fonstad was Director of Cartographic Services at the University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh. Her formal acknowledgments for &quot;The Atlas of Pern&quot; (1984) include &quot;my husband, Todd, associate professor geography&quot; and the UW Oshkosh Department of Geography. She served on the Oshkosh City Planning Commission for twenty-four years and was a member of the Oshkosh Common Council. Other interests and activities included the Grand Opera House Board of Directors, Hotel/Convention Center and Mass Transportation Center Development Committees, Oshkosh Commercial Development Corporation, Business Improvement Council Board of Directors, Downtown Oshkosh Committee, the Oshkosh Symphony League, the Camp Fire and Cub Scout programs, and the UW-Oshkosh Faculty Dames, where she held the offices of president and secretary.

==Death==

Fonstad died, aged 59, from complications of breast cancer.

<doc id="386232" wikidata="Q1752500" url="?curid=386232" title="Psychosynthesis">
<text>Psychosynthesis is a framework and approach to psychology developed by Italian psychiatrist Roberto Assagioli. It is &quot;one of the prime forces in transpersonal psychology.&quot; It &quot;stretches beyond the boundaries of personal psychology and individuality by postulating a deeper center of identity: the Self, our essential Being. The Self includes, but transcends, our personal day-to-day consciousness, leading to an enhanced sense of life direction and purpose.&quot; Along with the idea of a spiritual or transpersonal &quot;Self,&quot; Psychosynthesis emphasizes &quot;the value placed upon exploration of creative potential, and the hypothesis that each individual has a purpose in life.

Psychosynthesis considers the Self an &quot;ontological reality,&quot; a Being, often referred to as the &quot;Higher Self.&quot; It is a stable center or core of life. By contrast, the &quot;personal&quot; self, the self-conscious “I” that is our everyday sense of identity, is actually a reflection of the Self in the normal person. Psychosynthesis sees each individual as unique in terms of purpose in life, and places value on the exploration of human potential, combining spiritual development with psychological healing and including the life journey of an individual or their unique path to self-realization. Psychosynthesis is actively used in the efforts of individuals toward personal self-actualization and transpersonal Self-realization, but is also used by professionals around the world in the contexts of life coaching and psychotherapy. It has also been used in other contexts, including medicine, education, environmental design, community and organizations.

Psychosynthesis as a whole, with all its implications and developments . . . [is not] a particular psychological doctrine, nor a single technical procedure. It is, first and foremost, a dynamic and even a dramatic conception of our psychological life, which it portrays as a constant interplay and conflict between the many different and contrasting forces and a unifying center which ever tends to control, harmonize and utilize them. Psychosynthesis is, further, a plastic combination of several methods of inner action aiming, first, at the development and perfection of the personality, and then at its harmonious co-ordination and increasing unification with its Spiritual Self. These phases may be called, respectively, “personal psychosynthesis” and “spiritual psychosynthesis.” 

“Speaking of &quot;Synthesis&quot; means approaching the &quot;guiding principle&quot; of Assagiolian psychology, both the means and the goal of the entire psychosynthetic pathway. . . Synthesis is a process that involves the creation of a relationship between two or more elements through a third entity, in order to create a new reality.

The integrative framework of psychosynthesis began with Sigmund Freud&#x27;s theory of the unconscious, which it expands and modifies as a method of investigation, while rejecting the specific theories of sexuality, etc. held by Freud. Psychosynthesis also has some similarities with Existential psychology, Analytical Psychology and Humanistic Psychology. Among other uses, psychosynthesis can be used to address psychological distress and intra-psychic and interpersonal conflicts. Psychosynthesis has a strong presence in the fields of coaching and especially psychotherapy, some of which can be referenced in the external links and training centers listed at the bottom of this page. For Assagioli, synthesis is “a trend that is the expression of a universal principle” whose manifestation can be found in all aspects of reality: from the world of inorganic matter to the organic vegetable and animals worlds, from the psychic world of emotions and ideas to the world of interpersonal and social relationships, to the spiritual worlds.

== Development ==
Psychosynthesis was developed by Italian psychiatrist, Roberto Assagioli, who was a colleague of Freud, Jung and Bleuler. He began to formulate his ideas as early as 1910, but did not collect his thinking into a whole until the presentation of his pamphlet &quot;A New Method of Healing: Psychosynthesis,&quot; which was published in 1927. He later compared psychosynthesis to the prevailing thinking of the day, contrasting psychosynthesis with existential psychology, but unlike the latter he considered loneliness not to be &quot;either ultimate or essential&quot;. Assagioli asserted that &quot;the direct experience of the self, of pure &quot;self-awareness&quot; — independent of any &#x27;content&#x27; of the field of consciousness and of any situation in which the individual may find himself — is a true, &#x27;phenomenal&#x27; experience, an inner reality which can be empirically verified.&quot; Spiritual goals of &quot;self-realization&quot; and the &quot;interindividual psychosynthesis&quot;—of &quot;social integration...the harmonious integration of the individual into ever larger groups up to the &#x27;one humanity&#x27;&quot;—were central to Assagioli&#x27;s theory.

Psychosynthesis departed from the empirical foundations of behavioral psychology because it studied a person as a personality and a soul, even though Assagioli continued to insist that it was scientific. He asserted that it is a mistake to consider fields of research “scientific” or not; rather it is the &quot;method&quot; of research that is scientific or not. He asserted that the scientific method means clear thinking and sound reasoning on well-established facts, which are not limited to what can be weighed or measured. He asserted that “It is undeniable that all &quot;subjectively lived&quot; psychological phenomena are &quot;facts&quot;, even if not susceptible to direct weighing and measuring procedures, and as such can be studied scientifically. The pragmatic principle must be accepted that everything has its reality which produces an effect that modifies a preexistent state.&quot; Scientific studies of internal states are often done by gathering testimony about inner experiences. This is an accepted approach to study of altered states of consciousness. Assagioli developed therapeutic methods beyond those in psychoanalysis. Although the unconscious is an important part of his theory, he was careful to maintain a balance with rational, conscious therapeutical work. Psychosynthesis was not intended to be a school of thought or an exclusive method.“It could be defined principally as a general attitude, a tendency toward, and a series of activities aiming at, integration and synthesis in every field.” However, many conferences and publications had it as a central theme, and psychosynthesis training centers were formed in Italy, the UK and the United States in the 1960s and are now found in many countries in Europe, North and South America, Asia, New Zealand and Australia. Today, psychosynthesis is recognized through its membership in the European Association of Psychotherapy.

Assagioli was not the first to use the term &quot;psychosynthesis&quot;. The earliest use was by James Jackson Putnam, who used it as the name of his electroconvulsive therapy. The term was also used by C. G. Jung and A. R. Orage, who were both more aligned with Assagioli&#x27;s use of the term than Putnam&#x27;s use. C. G. Jung, in comparing his goals to those of Sigmund Freud, wrote, &quot;If there is a &#x27;psychoanalysis&#x27; there must also be a &#x27;psychosynthesis which creates future events according to the same laws&#x27;.&quot; A. R. Orage, who was the publisher of the influential journal, The New Age, used the term as well, but hyphenated it (psycho-synthesis). Orage formed an early psychology study group (which included Maurice Nicoll who later studied with Carl Jung) and concluded that what humanity needed was not psychoanalysis, but psycho-synthesis. The term was also used by Bezzoli. Freud, however, was opposed to what he saw as the directive element in Jung&#x27;s approach to psychosynthesis, and Freud argued for a spontaneous synthesis on the patient&#x27;s part: &quot;[During psychoanalysis] the great unity which we call his ego fits into itself all the instinctual impulses which before had been split off and held apart from it. The psycho-synthesis is thus achieved in analytic treatment without our intervention, automatically and inevitably.&quot;

== Origins ==

In 1909, C.G. Jung wrote to Sigmund Freud of &quot;a very pleasant and perhaps valuable acquaintance, our first Italian, a Dr. Assagioli from the psychiatric clinic in Florence&quot;. Later however, this same Roberto Assagioli (1888 – 1974) wrote a doctoral dissertation, &quot;La Psicoanaisi,&quot; in which he began to move away from Freud&#x27;s psychoanalysis toward what he called psychosynthesis:
A beginning of my conception of psychosynthesis was contained in my doctoral thesis on Psychoanalysis (1910), in which I pointed out what I considered to be some of the limitations of Freud&#x27;s views.
In developing psychosynthesis, Assagioli agreed with Freud that healing childhood trauma and developing a healthy ego were necessary aims of psychotherapy, but Assagioli believed that human growth could not be limited to this alone. A student of philosophical and spiritual traditions of both East and West, Assagioli sought to address human growth as it proceeded beyond the norm of the well-functioning ego; he wished to support the fruition of human potential—what Abraham Maslow later termed self-actualization—into the spiritual or transpersonal dimensions of human experience as well.

Assagioli envisioned an approach to the human being that could address both the process of personal growth—of personality integration and self-actualization—as well as transpersonal development. The transpersonal dimension is glimpsed for example during peak experiences (Maslow) of inspired creativity, spiritual insight, and unitive states of consciousness. Psychosynthesis recognizes the process of self-realization, of contact and response with one&#x27;s deepest callings and directions in life, which can involve either or both personal and transpersonal development.

Psychosynthesis is therefore one of the earliest forerunners of both humanistic psychology and transpersonal psychology, even preceding Jung&#x27;s break with Freud by several years. Assagioli&#x27;s conception has an affinity with existential-humanistic psychology and other approaches that attempt to understand the nature of the healthy personality, personal responsibility, and choice, and the actualization of the personal self. Similarly, his conception is related to the field of transpersonal psychology with its focus on higher states of consciousness, spirituality, and human experience beyond the individual self. Assagioli served on the board of editors for both the &quot;Journal of Humanistic Psychology&quot; and the &quot;Journal of Transpersonal Psychology&quot;.

Assagioli presents two major theoretical models in his seminal book, &quot;Psychosynthesis&quot;, models that have remained fundamental to psychosynthesis theory and practice:

# A diagram and description using a model of the constitution of the human person
# A stage theory of the process of psychosynthesis

==Aims==
In &quot;Psychosomatic Medicine and Bio-psychosynthesis&quot;, Assagioli states that the principal aims and tasks of psychosynthesis are:

# the elimination of the conflicts and obstacles, conscious and unconscious, that block [the complete and harmonious development of the human personality]
# the use of active techniques to stimulate the psychic functions still weak and immature.

In his book, &quot;Psychosynthesis: A Collection of Basic Writings&quot; (1965), Assagioli writes of three aims of psychosynthesis:
Let us examine whether and how it is possible to solve this central problem of human life, to heal this fundamental infirmity of man. Let us see how he may free himself from this enslavement and achieve an harmonious inner integration, true Self-realization, and right relationships with others. (p. 21)
== Model of the person ==
The concept of the human psychological constitution in psychosynthesis theory is illustrated in the so-called &quot;Egg Diagram,&quot; which maps the human psyche into different distinct and interconnected levels.

===The Lower Unconscious===
For Assagioli, the lower unconscious contains the elementary psychological activities which direct the life of the body; the fundamental drives and primitive urges; many emotionally charged complexes; many dreams and imaginings of a “lower kind;” “lower” uncontrolled parapsychological processes; and various pathological manifestations such as phobias, obsessions, compulsive urges and paranoid delusions. By another account, &#x27;the lower unconscious, which contains one&#x27;s personal psychological past in the form of repressed complexes, long-forgotten memories and dreams and imaginations&#x27;.

According to John Firman and Ann Gila, &quot;the lower unconscious is that realm of the person to which is relegated the experiences of shame, fear, pain, despair, and rage associated with primal wounding suffered in life. One way to think of the lower unconscious is that it is a particular bandwidth of one&#x27;s experiential range that has been broken away from consciousness. It comprises that range of experience related to the threat of personal annihilation, of destruction of self, of nonbeing, and more generally, of the painful side of the human condition. As long as this range of experience remains unconscious, the person will have a limited ability to be empathic with self or others in the more painful aspects of human life.&quot; Firman and Gila assert that the lower unconscious is &quot;formed&quot; when a person separates experiences of empathic failures from consciousness.

Roberto Assagioli’s approach to the lower unconscious is diametrically opposite to this: he regarded it as part of the fundamental constitution of a human being. He did &quot;not&quot; assert that either the lower and higher unconscious are by definition repressed. Comparing his egg diagram to Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, he states: “We can look at the diagram of the psychological constitution of man [egg-diagram]. The basic and normal personal needs concern the lower and middle psychological life, both conscious and unconscious.” Assagioli accepted that parts of the lower unconscious are repressed, but not all of it. There is also no evidence that Assagioli accepted the concepts of “personal annihilation” or “nonbeing” that these writers discuss. These writers share an outlook and use terminology derived from certain existentialist philosophers (Jean-Paul Sartre asserted that nothingness is part of reality, and nothingness is a &quot;lack of being&quot;). Assagioli explicitly contradicted this position, saying, “In certain periods men can feel internally isolated, but the extreme existentialist position is not true, &quot;neither psychologically nor spiritually&quot;.”

&quot;The lower unconscious merely represents the most primitive part of ourselves...It is not &quot;bad&quot;, it is just &quot;earlier&quot; &#x27;. Indeed, &#x27;the &quot;lower&quot; side has many attractions and great vitality&#x27;.

=== The Middle Unconscious ===
According to Roberto Assagioli, “the middle unconscious is formed of psychological elements similar to those of our waking consciousness and easily accessible to it. In this inner region our various experiences are assimilated, our ordinary mental and imaginative activities are elaborated and developed in a sort of psychological gestation before their birth into the light of consciousness.”

The middle unconscious is a sector of the person whose contents, although unconscious, nevertheless support normal conscious functioning in an ongoing way (thus it is illustrated as most immediate to &quot;I&quot;). It is the capacity to form patterns of skills, behaviors, feelings, attitudes, and abilities that can function without conscious attention, thereby forming the infrastructure of one&#x27;s conscious life.

The function of the middle unconscious can be seen in all spheres of human development, from learning to walk and talk, to acquiring languages, to mastering a trade or profession, to developing social roles. Anticipating today&#x27;s neuroscience, Assagioli even referred to &quot;developing new neuromuscular patterns&quot;. All such elaborate syntheses of thought, feeling, and behavior are built upon learnings and abilities that must eventually operate unconsciously.

According to Firman and Gila, &#x27;Human healing and growth that involves work with either the middle or the lower unconscious is known as &quot;personal psychosynthesis&quot; &#x27;.

===The Higher Unconscious or Superconscious===
Assagioli referred to The Higher Unconscious or Superconscious as the region from which “we receive our higher intuitions and inspirations—artistic, philosophical or scientific, ethical “imperatives” and urges to humanitarian and heroic action. It is the source of the higher feelings such as altruistic love, of genius and of the states of contemplation, illumination and ecstasy. In this realm are latent the higher psychic functions and spiritual energies.”

The higher unconscious (or superconscious) denotes &quot;our higher potentialities which seek to express themselves, but which we often repel and repress&quot;. As with the lower unconscious, this area is often not available to consciousness, so for many people its existence is inferred from moments in which contents from that level affect consciousness.

Psychosynthesis stresses that any distinction between “higher” and “lower” unconscious is developmental, not moralistic. The lower unconscious is simply our past, and forms the ‘foundation’ of our present awareness. Assagioli, however, did stress the evolutionary differences and development of the three sectors in the egg diagram. In the &quot;Act of Will&quot; he says the following: “The existence of different levels of being having different values is an evident and undeniable manifestation of the great law of evolution, as it progresses from simple and crude stages to more refined and highly organized ones. Applying this to the sphere of love … it is evident that a love that is overpowering, possessive, jealous, and blind is at a lower level than one that is tender and concerned with the person of the loved one, that seeks his well-being and desires the union of the best aspects of both personalities.”

Conscious contact with the higher unconscious can be seen in those moments, termed peak experiences by Maslow, which are often difficult to put into words, experiences in which one senses deeper meaning in life, a profound serenity and peace, a universality within the particulars of existence, or perhaps a unity between oneself and the cosmos. This level of the unconscious represents an area of the personality that contains the &quot;heights&quot; overarching the &quot;depths&quot; of the lower unconscious. As long as this range of experience remains unconscious – in what Desoille termed &#x27;&quot;repression of the sublime&quot;&#x27; – the person will have a limited ability to be empathic with self or other in the more sublime aspects of human life.

The higher unconscious thus represents &#x27;an autonomous realm, from where we receive our higher intuitions and inspirations – altruistic love and will, humanitarian action, artistic and scientific inspiration, philosophic and spiritual insight, and the drive towards purpose and meaning in life&#x27;.

The higher unconscious in psychosynthesis must not be confused with Freud’s “superego.” Assagioli asserted, “There is one point that needs clarification; and that is that there are different levels of moral consciousness, and it is important to distinguish between them. On the one hand, there is the moral consciousness that Freud referred to by the name “super-ego,” which is largely derived from prohibitions and parental commands. This type of “conscience” is linked to intense emotional charges, such as fear of doing wrong and guilt for every transgression, and consequently is harmful. This type of morality, produced by introjected external influences, is rigid, strict and intransigent. According to Assagioli, “the superconscious constitutes the higher section or aspect of the person of which the ego or self (the point in the middle of the circle) is not normally aware. But at times the conscious self rises or is raised to that higher region where it has specific experiences and states of awareness of various kinds which can be called “spiritual” in the widest sense. At other times it happens that some contents of the superconscious “descend” and penetrate into the area of the normal consciousness of the ego, producing what is called “inspiration.” This interplay has great importance and value, both for fostering creativity and for achieving psychosynthesis.

Concerning the &quot;experience&quot; of the Higher Self, Assagioli differentiates between the experience of the contents, processes and activities of the superconscious and the &quot;contentless&quot; experience of the Higher Self. He said that there is a &quot;difference between becoming aware of superconscious levels of experience and contents on the one hand, and pure Self-realization on the other. Self-realization, in this specific well-defined sense, means the momentary or more or less temporary identification or blending of the I-consciousness with the spiritual Self, in which the former, which is the reflection of the latter, becomes reunited, blended with the spiritual Self. In these cases there is a forgetfulness of all contents of consciousness, of all which forms the personality both on normal levels and those of the synthesized personality which include superconscious or spiritual levels of life and experience; there is only the pure intense experience of the Self.

===Subpersonalities===
William James recognized that various psychological traits are not integrated, but form behavioral roles that he called &quot;the various selves,&quot; which shift according to the relationships we have with other people, surroundings, groups, etc. Roberto Assagioli calls these &quot;subpersonalities,&quot; and recognized that they are part of everyday normal behavior. You can recognize them by noticing that &quot;you behave differently in your office, at home, in social interplay, in solitude, at church, or as a member of a political party . . . Ordinary people shift from one to the other without clear awareness, and only a thin thread of memory connects them; but for all practical purposes they are different beings – they act differently, they show very different traits.&quot;

Subpersonalities form a central strand in psychosynthesis thinking. &#x27;One of the first people to have started really making use of subpersonalities for therapy and personal growth was Roberto Assagioli&#x27;, psychosynthesis reckoning that &#x27;subpersonalities exist at various levels of organization, complexity, and refinement&#x27; throughout the mind. A five-fold process of recognition, acceptance, co-ordination, integration, and synthesis &#x27;leads to the discovery of the Transpersonal Self, and the realization that that is the final truth of the person, not the subpersonalities&#x27;.

Some subpersonalities may be seen &#x27;as psychological contents striving to emulate an archetype...&quot;degraded expressions of the archetypes of higher qualities&quot; &#x27;. Others will resist the process of integration; will &#x27;take the line that it is difficult being alive, and it is far easier – and safer – to stay in an undifferentiated state&#x27;. Roberto Assagioli said that [some] subpersonalities are the semi-independent nuclei of a number of differing and conflicting tendencies. Other subpersonalities, or roles, are those played in the different social groups . . . which [a person] may have or may want to play in life. &quot;One should become clearly aware of these subpersonalities because . . . it is possible to synthesize [them] into a larger organic whole without repressing any of the useful traits.&quot;

===The Conscious Self or &quot;I&quot;===
The &quot;I&quot; or conscious self is a point or center of pure self-awareness: the direct &quot;reflection&quot; or &quot;projection&quot; of the Self, distinct but not separate from the personality and all contents of conscious experience. The &quot;I&quot; is a center of consciousness, or awareness, and will, whose field of consciousness (the part of our personality of which we are directly aware) is represented by the concentric circle around the &quot;I&quot; in the star diagram.

It is well to become aware of the relationships between the self and the will on one hand and the various other psychological functions on the other. The will has been placed at the center of the star diagram in direct contact with the conscious I, or personal self, to show the close connection between them. Through the will, the I acts on the other six psychological functions, regulating and directing them. The diagram is oversimplified, like all diagrams, but it helps to give prominence to the central position of the will. The self is not only a center of awareness. &quot;There is another part of the inner self – the will-er or the directing agent – that actively intervenes to orchestrate the various functions and energies of the personality.&quot;

Assagioli describes the experience of the conscious “I” with these words: “the body, feelings, and mind are &quot;instruments&quot; of experience, perception and action, tools that are changeable and impermanent. But the &#x27;I&#x27; is essentially different: it is simple, unchanging, self-conscious. The experience of the &#x27;I&#x27; can be formulated as follows: &#x27;I am I, a Center of pure consciousness.&#x27; Affirming this with conviction does not mean that one has already achieved the &quot;experience&quot; of the &#x27;I,&#x27; self-identification, but it is the path that leads there and is a means of mastering our psychic activities.&quot; … &quot;All this is preparation for the final &quot;positive&quot; stage, the affirmation and experience of self-consciousness: &#x27;I am convinced and affirm that I am a Center of pure awareness, of pure self-consciousness; I am a Center of will, capable of mastering, directing and using all my psychic functions and my body. I AM. Let us dwell on this statement, striving to realize this pure consciousness of &quot;being&quot;, this stable, unchanging Center, steady as a rock amidst the churning waves of becoming. &#x27;I AM.&#x27;&quot;

Assagioli developed his &quot;Exercise of Disidentification and Self-Identification&quot; to help people make the distinction between the &quot;I&quot; and its experiences:1. The first stage is to sit comfortably, releasing all muscle and nerve tension; this can be helped by a prior practice of the relaxation exercise. It is good to keep the spine straight, the head slightly lowered; close the eyes; then take a few deep, slow, regular breaths. (pause)

2. Affirm slowly, with attention and conviction, “I have a body, but I &quot;am not&quot; my body. My body may be in different conditions of health or sickness, it may be rested or tired, but this has nothing to do with Me, with my true Self. My body is a valuable instrument of experience and action in the outer world, but it is only a tool; I treat it well, I try to keep it healthy, but &quot;it is not my self&quot;. I have a body, but I &quot;am not&quot; my body.&quot; (After a period of training one can simply repeat the final sentence several times, “I have a body, but I am not my body.” The same applies to the later stages as well.)(pause)

3. We affirm with conviction, “I have emotions, but I &quot;am not&quot; my emotions. They are different, changing, conflicting, while I always remain me, myself, in the alternation of hope and discouragement, joy and sorrow, irritation and calm. I can observe, understand and judge my emotions, and become more and more capable of mastering, directing and using them.” — “I have emotions, but I &quot;am not&quot; my emotions.”(pause)

4. “I have desires, but I &quot;am not&quot; my desires. Desires are also changeable, conflicting; they are a succession of attractions and repulsions. There are desires &quot;in me&quot;, but they &quot;are not&quot; Me.&quot; (pause)

5. “I have a mind, but I &quot;am not&quot; my mind. It may be more or less developed and active; it is undisciplined, but little by little I can master and direct it. It is an organ of knowledge, both of the external world and of the internal world, but it &quot;is not&quot; myself. I have a mind, but I &quot;am not&quot; my mind.” (pause)

6. All this is preparation for the final &quot;positive&quot; stage, the affirmation and experience of self-consciousness: “I am convinced and affirm that I am a Center of pure awareness, of pure self-consciousness; I am a Center of will, capable of mastering, directing and using all my psychic functions and my body. I AM.” Psychosynthesis suggests that &quot;we can experience the will as having four stages. The first stage could be described as &#x27;having no will, and might perhaps be linked with the hegemony of the lower unconscious. &quot;The next stage of the will is understanding that &#x27;will exists&#x27;. We might still feel that we cannot actually do it, but we know...it is possible&quot;. &quot;Once we have developed our will, at least to some degree, we pass to the next stage which is called &#x27;having a will, and thereafter &quot;in psychosynthesis we call the fourth and final stage of the evolution of the will in the individual &#x27;being will – which then &quot;relates to the &#x27;I&#x27; or self...[and] draws energy from the transpersonal self&quot;.

It is the &quot;I&quot; who is aware of the psyche-soma contents as they pass in and out of awareness; the contents come and go, while &quot;I&quot; may remain present to each experience as it arises. But &quot;I&quot; is dynamic as well as receptive: &quot;I&quot; has the ability to affect awareness, in addition to the contents of awareness, by choosing to focus awareness (as in many types of meditation), expand it, or contract it.

Regarding the conscious self or “I,” Assagioli wrote, The changing &quot;contents&quot; of our consciousness . . . are one thing, while the “I,” the self, the &quot;center&quot; of our consciousness is another.&quot; &quot;The reflection appears to be self-existent but has, in reality, no autonomous substantiality. It is, in other words, not a new and different light but a projection of its luminous source&quot;. The next section describes this &quot;luminous source&quot;, the Self.

===The Self===
At the top of the oval diagram, shown as a “star” that is partly within and partly outside of the oval, is the Self (which has also been called the Higher Self or the Transpersonal Self). Assagioli wrote, “The conscious self is generally not only submerged in the ceaseless flow of psychological contents but seems to disappear altogether when we fall asleep, when we faint, when we are under the effect of an anesthetic or narcotic, or in a state of hypnosis. And when we awake the self mysteriously reappears, we do not know how or whence—a fact which, if closely examined, is truly baffling and disturbing. This leads us to assume that the re-appearance of the conscious self or ego is due to the existence of a permanent center, of a true Self situated beyond or “above” it.”

Assagioli understood the Higher Self as a superconscious entity or being that pervades the personality with its energies through the superconscious: ”The key thought is in the [Bhagavad] Gita: “Having pervaded with one part of myself the whole universe, I remain”. What “remains” is &quot;the Self on its own level&quot;. Yet while it remains there, it can pervade and is pervading the whole universe of the personality, and this it does &quot;through&quot; the superconscious.” Assagioli also understood the Higher Self as a transcendent being: “This Self is above, and unaffected by, the flow of the mind-stream or by bodily conditions; and the personal conscious self should be considered merely as its reflection, its “projection” in the field of the personality. The transpersonal Self is “outside” time and above it. It exists and lives in the dimension of the Eternal.”
When it comes to the &quot;experience&quot; of the Higher Self, Assagioli differentiates between the experience of the contents, processes, and activities in the superconscious and the contentless experience of the Higher Self, which must not be confused.

Assagioli describes Self-Realization (not to be confused with self-actualization) as “the realization of one’s True Self — the discovery or creation of a &quot;unifying center: the controlling Principle of our life.&quot; He presents the Self-realization process in three ascending stages. In &quot;The Act of Will&quot;, Assagioli states:

“In the terminology of psychosynthesis, self-actualisation corresponds to personal psychosynthesis. This includes the development and harmonising of all human functions and potentialities at all levels of the lower and middle area in the diagram of the constitution of man [i.e. egg-diagram]… Self-realisation concerns the third higher level, that of the superconscious, and pertains to Transpersonal or spiritual psychosynthesis.

Self-realisation itself has three different stages. The first is the activation and expression of the potentialities residing in the superconscious: it includes… various types of transcendence… Leonardo da Vinci or Goethe would be good examples of this.

The second stage of Self-realisation is the &quot;direct awareness&quot; of the SELF, which culminates in the unification of the consciousness of the personal self, or “I”, with that of the Transpersonal Self. Here one might mention those who have done self-sacrificing work for a beneficent cause in any field. Active humanitarians who have given themselves to a cause are good examples: Gandhi, Florence Nightingale, Martin Luther King, Schweitzer. Schweitzer is typical because he gave up even some of his higher interests – music and culture – in order to do humanitarian work. In terms of will, it is the unification of the personal will with the Transpersonal Will.

The third stage of Self-realisation is the communion of the Transpersonal Self with the Universal Self, and correspondingly of the individual will with the Universal Will. Here we find the highest mystics of all times and places.”

The relationship of the &quot;I&quot; and the Self is paradoxical. Assagioli was clear that &quot;I&quot; and Self were from one point of view, one. He wrote, &quot;There are not really two selves, two independent and separate entities. The Self is one&quot;. Such a nondual unity is a fundamental aspect of this level of experience. But Assagioli also understood that there could be an experience of illumination that is initiated by the Transpersonal Self as well:Consciousness is able to participate, at least in part, in what takes place in the superconscious, and to receive the gifts that come down from the Spirit, and then &quot;contemplation produces illumination&quot;. How can one say &quot;what illumination is&quot;? In human language it is already difficult to express the delicate nuances and tones of normal states of mind, to indicate the different qualities of inner experiences; but how much more difficult is it to give an adequate idea of states of mind that are so much higher or more intense, and qualitatively so different from the usual ones! 

Accounts of religious experiences often speak of a &quot;call&quot; from God, or a &quot;pull&quot; from some Higher Power; this sometimes starts a &quot;dialogue&quot; between the man [or woman] and this &quot;higher Source&quot;...In his essay &quot;Contemplation and Illumination,&quot; which was originally part of a series of lectures in 1934 at his Institute in Florence, Assagioli discusses such experiences in more detail, quoting R. Maurice Bucke, Charles Finney (former President of Oberlin College) and French philosopher Pascal, and for specific examples refers us to William James&#x27; well-known survey &quot;Varieties of Religious Experience,&quot; first published in 1902. The most well-known example of the experience of illumination initiated from a higher level is the account of the conversion of the apostle Paul, as recounted in The Acts of the Apostles.

However Assagioli made a clear distinction between experience of the Self and experience of God, or The Universal. He said, “those who have these higher human experiences usually mix the experience of the Self with expressions about God, or some superconscious aspect, such as beauty or the simple experience of ecstasy. Or they jump directly to the Universal Self . . .There is such an intense feeling of oneness that people often do not pay attention to the fact that it is &quot;the Self&quot; [not the personal self or “I”] that experiences Oneness.” This is a subtle but crucial issue. If one were truly immersed in the universal, &quot;one would not know it&quot;.

Roberto Assagioli insisted that the &quot;actual&quot; experience of The Self is often mixed up with other experiences. The conscious experience of the Self is exemplified by such experiences as illumination or mystical union: it is not an ordinary “experience.” Self-consciousness can be experienced through exercises and a gradual, one might say “scientific” procedure. We tend to jump from the personal to the Universal . . . without the experience of illumination of the Self, and also of intermediate degrees, the percentage of self-consciousness at the higher levels and of communion with the Universal.”

== Stages ==

Writing about the model of the person presented above, Assagioli states that it is a &quot;structural, static, almost &#x27;anatomical&#x27; representation of our inner constitution, while it leaves out its dynamic aspect, which is the most important and essential one&quot;. Thus he follows this model immediately with a stage theory outlining the process of psychosynthesis. These stages relate to his clinical theory: how personal psychosynthesis is accomplished through a counseling process.This scheme can be called the &quot;stages of psychosynthesis&quot;, and is presented here.

It is important to note that although the linear progression of the following stages does make logical sense, these stages may not in fact be experienced in this sequence; they are not a ladder up which one climbs, but aspects of a single process. Further, one never outgrows these stages; any stage can be present at any moment throughout the process of Psychosynthesis. Assaglioli acknowledges &#x27;persisting traits belonging to preceding psychological ages&#x27; and the perennial possibility of &#x27;retrogression to primitive stages&#x27;.

The stages of Psychosynthesis may be tabulated as follows:
# Thorough knowledge of one&#x27;s personality.
# Control of its various elements.
# Realization of one&#x27;s true Self—the discovery or creation of a unifying center.
# Psychosynthesis: the formation or reconstruction of the personality around a new center.
Assagioli divided his theory of development into two broad phases: “Psychosynthesis utilizes many techniques of psychological action, aiming first at the development and perfection of the personality, and then at its harmonious co-ordination and increasing unification with the Self. These phases may be called respectively “personal” and “spiritual” psychosynthesis.”

In his book &quot;The Act of Will&quot; he further elaborates on his developmental theory, aligning his view with Maslow’s &quot;Hierarchy of Needs,&quot; proposing an ascending stage model where the &quot;I&quot; develops from prepersonal (lower unconscious) to personal (middle unconscious) to transpersonal development (transpersonal unconscious or superconscious) culminating in the unification of the &quot;I&quot; with the Higher Self and ultimately with the Universal Self.

“The realization of the Higher Self “is a process which primarily reaches through the Superconscious, towards the soul [higher Self] and the Universal Self. A prolonged phase of purification is also a part of this process, so the descent into the abyss of the lower unconscious is also necessary. Our personal energies must be purified so they can express the universal love-wisdom that flows from the Superconscious.”

In his article &quot;Spiritual Development and Nervous Diseases&quot;, which was first published in 1932 and later revised and included as chapter two in his first book under the title “Self-Realization and Psychological Disturbances,” he gives further information about spiritual development and the stages we undergo, listing five spiritual crises:

1. Crises preceding the spiritual awakening.

2. Crises determined by the spiritual awakening.

3. Reactions to the spiritual awakening.

4. Phases of the process of transmutation.

5. The “Dark Night of the Soul.”

==Methods==

Psychosynthesis was regarded by Assagioli as more of an orientation and a general approach to the whole human being, and as existing apart from any of its particular concrete applications. This approach allows for a wide variety of techniques and methods to be used within the psychosynthesis context. &#x27;Dialogue, Gestalt techniques, dream work, guided imagery, affirmations, and meditation are all powerful tools for integration&#x27;, but &#x27;the attitude and presence of the counselor are of far greater importance than the particular methods used&#x27;. Sand tray, art therapy, journaling, drama therapy, and body work; cognitive-behavioral techniques; object relations, self psychology, and family systems approaches, may all be used in different contexts, from individual and group psychotherapy, to meditation and self-help groups. Psychosynthesis offers an overall view which can help orient oneself within the vast array of different modalities available today, and be applied either for therapy or for self-actualization.

Recently, two psychosynthesis techniques were shown to help student sojourners in their acculturation process. First, the self-identification exercise eased anxiety, an aspect of culture shock. Secondly, the subpersonality model aided students in their ability to integrate a new social identity. In another recent study, the subpersonality model was shown to be an effective intervention for aiding creative expression, helping people connect to different levels of their unconscious creativity. Most recently, psychosynthesis psychotherapy has proven to activate personal and spiritual growth in self-identified atheists.

One broad classification of the techniques used involves the following headings: &#x27;Analytical: To help identify blocks and enable the exploration of the unconscious&#x27;. Psychosynthesis stresses &#x27;the importance of using obstacles as steps to growth&#x27; – &#x27;blessing the obstacle...blocks are our helpers&#x27;. &#x27;Mastery...the eight psychological functions need to be gradually retrained to produce permanent positive change&#x27;. &#x27;Transformation...the refashioning of the personality around a new centre&#x27;. &#x27;Grounding...into the concrete terms of daily life.&#x27;Relational...to cultivate qualities such as love, openness and empathy&#x27;.

Psychosynthesis allows practitioners the recognition and validation of an extensive range of human experience: the vicissitudes of developmental difficulties and early trauma; the struggle with compulsions, addictions, and the trance of daily life; the confrontation with existential identity, choice, and responsibility; levels of creativity, peak performance, and spiritual experience; and the search for meaning and direction in life. None of these important spheres of human existence need be reduced to the other, and each can find its right place in the whole. This means that no matter what type of experience is engaged, and no matter what phase of growth is negotiated, the complexity and uniqueness of the person may be respected—a fundamental principle in any application of psychosynthesis.

==Criticism==

In the December 1974 issue of &quot;Psychology Today&quot;, Assagioli was interviewed by Sam Keen and was asked to comment on the limits of psychosynthesis. He answered paradoxically: &quot;The limit of psychosynthesis is that it has no limits. It is too extensive, too comprehensive. Its weakness is that it accepts too much. It sees too many sides at the same time and that is a drawback.&quot;

According to one writer, psychosynthesis &quot;has always been on the fringes of the &#x27;official&#x27; therapy world&quot; and it &quot;is only recently that the concepts and methods of psychoanalysis and group analysis have been introduced into the training and practice of psychosynthesis psychotherapy&quot;. However, Assagioli always advocated using the methods of psychoanalysis while disavowing Freudian doctrines. He insisted from the beginning that “psychosynthesis presupposes psychoanalysis, or rather, includes it as a first and necessary stage.” When asked about the major differences between psychoanalysis and psychosynthesis, Roberto Assagioli responded, &quot;We pay far more attention to the higher unconscious and to the development of the transpersonal self. In one of his letters Freud said, &#x27;I am interested only in the basement of the human being.&#x27; Psychosynthesis is interested in the whole building. We try to build an elevator which will allow a person access to every level of his personality. After all, a building with only a basement is very limited. We want to open up the terrace where you can sun-bathe or look at the stars. Our concern is the synthesis of all areas of the personality. That means psychosynthesis is holistic, global and inclusive. It is not against psychoanalysis or even behaviour modification but it insists that the needs for meaning, for higher values, for a spiritual life, are as real as biological or social needs.&quot;

Psychosynthesis has been at times exposed to the dangers of cultism, so that on one occasion, having &quot;started out reflecting the high-minded spiritual philosophy of its founder, in the hands of one particular group [it] became more and more authoritarian, more and more strident in its conviction that psychosynthesis was the One Truth&quot;. That particular group, headed by James Vargiu, &quot;gradually degenerated into a cult in the worst sense of the word,&quot; but collapsed in 1980. It seems plain from its history since that unfortunate episode that the &quot;dangers&quot; are long past. Other teachers and centers in North America and elsewhere in the world, especially in Europe, continue to present psychosynthesis in alignment with the vision of its founder.

A more technical danger is that premature concern with the transpersonal may hamper dealing with personal psychosynthesis: for example, &quot;evoking serenity ... might produce a false sense of well-being and security&quot;. Practitioners have noted how &quot;inability to ... integrate the superconscious contact with everyday experience easily leads to inflation&quot;, and have spoken of &quot;an &#x27;Icarus complex&#x27;, the tendency whereby spiritual ambition fails to take personality limitations into account and causes all sorts of psychological difficulties&quot;. As in every approach to spiritual growth or psychological healing, the results depend upon the person involved, and upon the practitioner&#x27;s ability to discern the stages or state of health, and the needs, of that person. Assagioli himself discussed the issue of psychological disturbances related to spiritual awakening or Self-realization, and its diagnosis and treatment, in Chapter 2 of his book &quot;Psychosynthesis&quot; (1965.) 

==Fictional analogies==

Stephen Potter&#x27;s &quot;Lifemanship Psycho-Synthesis Clinic&quot;, where one may &quot;find the psycho-synthesist lying relaxed on the couch while the patient will be encouraged to walk up and down&quot; would seem a genuine case of &quot;parallel evolution&quot;, since its clear targets, as &quot;the natural antagonists...of the lifeplay, are the psychoanalysts&quot;.

<text>Geills Turner ( Kilgour; born December 23, 1937) is a Canadian businesswoman and the widow of John Turner, the 17th Prime Minister of Canada. Her first name is pronounced like &quot;Jill&quot;.

==Early life and work==
Turner, the eldest of three children, was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba. She is the grand-niece of John McCrae, author of the poem &quot;In Flanders Fields&quot;, and the sister of long time Alberta member of Parliament David Kilgour. Her father was David Kilgour, Sr., who was the chief executive officer of Great West Life Assurance Company. Turner grew up in a wealthy family. She excelled in science and mathematics, and graduated from McGill University with a degree in math and physics. She enrolled in the post-graduate business administration course at Harvard Business School. After graduating from Harvard, she left the United States since investment firms in New York City were not interested in hiring a woman. Turner moved to Montreal to work for IBM. Author Gordon Donaldson called her an &quot;upper-crust pretty [girl]&quot;.

She met John Turner when she was a campaign worker for his first election campaign and she &quot;brought computers into Turner&#x27;s campaign.&quot; They married in 1963 and had three children: Elizabeth (born 1964), Michael (born 1965), David (born 1968, died 2021), and James Andrew (born 1972).

==Spouse of the prime minister==
Her husband served as prime minister of Canada from June 30 to September 17, 1984.

The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation states that &quot;she was not keen to subsume her personality to further her husband’s goals, and for the most part stayed out of the spotlight.&quot; She also did not like the way she was portrayed in the press and therefore tried to stay away from it. In his book &quot;Birds of a Feather: The Press and the Politicians&quot;, Allan Fotheringham claimed that Turner tried to exact her revenge on the press during the 1988 election campaign by secretly taking photographs of journalists partying on a campaign bus, with an eye toward publishing them in a magazine. The photographs were never subsequently published, however, and Fotheringham states that John Turner himself most likely killed the idea.

==Later life==
After the family returned to Toronto, Turner enrolled in a four-year photography program at Ryerson University.

In 2001, Turner made news when she crashed her minivan and was charged for careless driving. She stated that she had momentarily stopped driving responsibly to save her dog.

In March 2008 Turner brought an action in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice against the City of Guelph, claiming ownership of several of John McCrae&#x27;s wartime medals which were donated to the McCrae House in 1997 and 2005. She was seeking to have personal possession of the medals. The action was settled in 2012 with an agreement for the medals to remain with the museum.

<text>Ahmes ( “, a common Egyptian name also transliterated [[Ahmose (disambiguation)|Ahmose]]) was an ancient Egyptian scribe who lived towards the end of the Fifteenth Dynasty (and of the Second Intermediate Period) and the beginning of the Eighteenth Dynasty (and of the New Kingdom). He transcribed the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus, a work of ancient Egyptian mathematics that dates to approximately 1550 BC; he is the earliest contributor to mathematics whose name is known. Ahmes claimed not to be the writer of the work but rather just the scribe. He claimed the material came from an even older document from around 2000 B.C.

<text>The Kitchener Rangers are a major junior ice hockey team based in Kitchener, Ontario, Canada. They are members of the Midwest Division of the Western Conference of the Ontario Hockey League. The Rangers have won the J. Ross Robertson Cup as OHL champions in 1981, 1982, 2003 and 2008. They have appeared in six Memorial Cups (1981, 1982, 1984, 1990, 2003 and 2008), advancing to the final game of the tournament each of those six years. They are two-time Memorial Cup champions (1982, 2003).

The Rangers are one of six teams in the Canadian Hockey League (Moose Jaw Warriors, Swift Current Broncos, Lethbridge Hurricanes, Peterborough Petes) that are publicly owned. Since the club&#x27;s inception, a 39-person Board of Directors, including a nine-person executive committee, is elected by the team&#x27;s season ticket subscribers who act as trustees of the team. This Board of Directors is also comprised entirely and only of Kitchener Rangers season ticket subscribers.

They are one of the most successful Canadian Hockey League teams in terms of alumni with over 180 players and coaches going on to serve in the NHL including Gabriel Landeskog, Jeff Skinner, Radek Faksa, John Gibson, Nazem Kadri, Mike Richards, David Clarkson, Steve Mason, Derek Roy and Peter DeBoer. Five of their alumni have gone on to be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame: Scott Stevens, Bill Barber, Paul Coffey, Larry Robinson and Al MacInnis.

==History==
The Kitchener Rangers franchise was inaugurated ahead of the 1947–48 Ontario Hockey Association season as the Guelph Biltmore Mad Hatters. Based in nearby Guelph, Ontario, the Biltmore Mad Hatters were a farm team for the National Hockey League&#x27;s New York Rangers. The team enjoyed considerable success in the 1950s, winning three league championships and a Memorial Cup. However, by 1960, the team was struggling financially and was sold to new ownership. The new owners re-branded the team as the Guelph Royals to match Guelph&#x27;s nickname, the &quot;Royal City&quot;. Despite these efforts to reignite the fading brand, the team&#x27;s financial struggles persisted. At the end of the 1962–63 season, Kitchener entrepreneur Eugene George was approached by the New York Rangers about moving the team to Kitchener in hopes of building a more stable junior environment.

In 1963, George and a group of Kitchener businessmen relocated the Guelph Royals to Kitchener and renamed them the Kitchener Rangers Junior &quot;A&quot; Hockey Club. The New York Rangers sponsorship of the team ended in 1967 with the expansion of the NHL&#x27;s &quot;Original Six’&quot; Era, so George agreed to purchase the team from the New York Rangers for a sum of one dollar, but declined the opportunity for private ownership. He instead turned the team over to the community through the creation of a not-for-profit organization. The Kitchener Rangers Charter declared &quot;no person shall be a member of the Corporation unless he is a season ticket subscriber for the current season of the home hockey games of the club, and all persons who are season ticket subscribers are automatically entitled to membership.&quot;

===The 1960s===
For their debut season in 1963–64 the team moved into the Kitchener Memorial Auditorium, which had previously been home to the Kitchener Greenshirts and the Kitchener Canucks. On Tuesday, October 1, 1963, the Rangers&#x27; first coach, Steve Brklacich, welcomed a 54-player roster of training camp hopefuls just two weeks prior to the home opener. The first exhibition game took place on Sunday, October 6, 1963 against the Peterborough Petes. The team&#x27;s first regular season game featured the Rangers and the visiting St. Catharines Black Hawks on Tuesday, October 15, 1963 which dressed the likes of league All-Stars Dennis Hull and Doug Jarrett. The first goal in team history was scored by John Beechey, assisted by Gary Sabourin and Tommy Miller, at 11:36 of the first period. The team&#x27;s first captain, Alexander &#x27;Sandy&#x27; Fitzpatrick, would score the first game-winning goal in team history, breaking open a 3–3 tie in the third period to propel the Blueshirts to a 4–3 win. The Rangers were successful promoting the team in the community, drawing high attendance despite a poor first season in the standings which finished with a record of 9-41-6 (W-L-T).

The Rangers struggled during their first three seasons in the OHA, finishing under .500 in the following two campaigns (6th in 1964–65, 7th in 1965–66). Despite the seventh-place finish in 1965–66, the team finished the year strong and won the first two rounds of playoffs to make it to the OHA Finals, eventually falling 4–1 in a best-of-seven series to the Oshawa Generals and a young Bobby Orr. Kitchener finished in first place the next season (1966–67, 38-10-6), earning their first Hamilton Spectator Trophy in franchise history as regular season champions, but fell to the Toronto Marlboros in the semi-finals. In 1967–68, the Rangers were first again in the OHA and went on to win their second consecutive Hamilton Spectator Trophy. They played in the Finals again, but this time losing a close series 4 games to 3 with a tie, to the eventual Memorial Cup champion Niagara Falls Flyers. In 1968–69, Jim Malleck succeeded Eugene George as the team&#x27;s president. In November 1968, Kitchener native Dave Weber was appointed coach after Wally Kullman was relieved of his duties. But the Rangers posted just nine wins (9-40-5), finishing in 10th place after seeing 13 players from the previous season graduate to the professional ranks. In 1969, Walter (Punch) Scherer, a former scout for the Boston Bruins, became the team&#x27;s general manager. The decade finished on a high note, however, as rookie Bill Barber dressed in his first of three junior seasons in Kitchener and tallied 37 goals and 86 points in just 54 regular season games.

1969 also marked the year that Les Bradley joined the team. Bradley was a mainstay on the bench as the team&#x27;s trainer from 1969 to 1986, then after retiring as a trainer became an ambassador in the press room for more than 15 years.

===The 1970s===
Gerry Forler became the Rangers&#x27; coach for the 1970–71 season but resigned in December, 1970 and was replaced by Ron Murphy for the remainder of the season. Kitchener struggled through most of the decade, posting only two winning seasons (a 31-24-8 record in 1971–72, and 43-18-9 in 1973–74). Barber posted his first of two straight 100+ point seasons in 1970–71, scoring 46 goals and 105 points in 61 regular season games. He was one of two players to hit the 100-point milestone (Tom Cassidy, 104 points) that year, but the Rangers were unable to get out of the first round of the playoffs. In 1973–74, the Rangers finished first in the OHA for their third Hamilton Spectator Trophy in eight years in large part due to the goalkeeping of Don Edwards, who had the league&#x27;s lowest goals against average. The team lost to the Peterborough Petes in the second round of the playoffs.

In the 1974–75 season, the club finished last in the league and 20 points out of a playoff spot with a record of 17-47-6. Despite their last-place finish, the Rangers would host the Memorial Cup that season as no host team was in place. For the following season in 1975–76, there were changes at president, general manager and coach. The team improved by 17 points, rising to a fourth-place finish in the standings. In 1976–77, Foster would set the Rangers franchise record for points in a single season (143), a mark that still stands today. His total 382 points in 262 regular season games over 1973-77 also remains a club record.

The Rangers&#x27; record during the 1979–80 season dropped to 17-51-0, but Paul Coffey, a young acquired defenceman from the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds, collected 71 points in 52 regular season games before being drafted sixth overall by the Edmonton Oilers in the 1980 NHL Entry Draft.

===The 1980s===
==== 1981 Memorial Cup ====
The Rangers were looking to rebound from a 17-51-0 season in 1979–80, but the first half of the 1980-81 campaign left them in last place at Christmas. But a strong second half - culminating with eight wins in nine games to finish the season - propelled the Rangers to a first-place finish and an Emms Division title. They would see a 35-point improvement from the previous season, finishing with a mark of 34-33-1. Coached by Orval Tessier, the Rangers were led offensively by 49 goals and 116 points from right winger Brian Bellows, along with 54 goals and 108 points from left winger Jeff Larmer. Centreman Grant Martin was just two points shy of joining them in the century club, notching 41 goals and 98 points. Other standouts on the squad included Al MacInnis, Mike Eagles, Larry Carroll and goalie Wendell Young.

Kitchener&#x27;s playoffs began against the Niagara Falls Flyers, and they defeated them with a 4–2 series win, including one tie. The Rangers scored five or more goals in every game of the series, with the exception of the 3–3 tie in Game 4. Next up was a meeting with the Windsor Spitfires in Round 3, which the Rangers won 4–0 with one tie. Again the Blueshirts offense proved formidable, scoring no fewer than four goals in each contest and twice scoring seven. This set the stage for an OHL Final vs. the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds. The Hounds were favoured to win the league title, having averaged the highest goals per game average in the league and finishing 27 points ahead of Kitchener in the regular season standings. The Rangers, however, held the Greyhounds to 16 goals in the series six games and were undefeated in the league final. They skated to a 3–0 series win with three ties to earn their first J. Ross Robertson Cup as OHL champions in franchise history.

The 1981 Memorial Cup was played at the Windsor Arena in Windsor, Ontario. Kitchener represented the Ontario Hockey League while centre Barry Pederson (65 goals, 147 points in 55 regular season games), right winger Rich Chernomaz (49 goals, 113 points in 72 games) and goaltender Grant Fuhr were key pieces of the Western Hockey League&#x27;s Victoria Cougars. The Quebec Major Junior Hockey League squad - and defending Memorial Cup Champions - were the Cornwall Royals which featured the likes of centre Dale Hawerchuk (81 goals, 183 points in 72 games), left winger Marc Crawford (42 goals, 99 points in 63 games) and centre Doug Gilmour (35 points in 51 games).

Kitchener lost its first two games; 6–3 to Cornwall and 7–4 to Victoria. The Rangers then posted consecutive victories; 6–4 over the Royals in which Bellows scored a hat trick, and 4-2 vs. the Cougars. The Rangers went on to face Cornwall in the tournament final but dropped a 5-2 decision to the Royals, who would win their second consecutive Memorial Cup.

====1982 Memorial Cup====
Joe Crozier took over the coaching duties after the 1980–81 season after coach/general manager Orval Tessier left the team to become head coach of the American Hockey League&#x27;s New Brunswick Hawks, who he would lead to a Calder Cup championship. Kitchener picked up where it left off from the previous season, finding success while being led by top players Larry Carroll, Brian Bellows and Jeff Larmer, as well as added future NHL players Scott Stevens and Mike Hough. The Rangers won the Emms Division for the second year in a row with a much improved record (44-21-3).

Kitchener earned a first round bye in the playoffs, then skated to a 4–0 series win over the Windsor Spitfires in Round 2. They once again clashed with the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds, this time in Round 3, and again earned a series win this time in five games (4-1). The Rangers faced off against the Ottawa 67&#x27;s, coached by Brian Kilrea, in the league final and claimed their second straight J. Ross Robertson Cup with a 4–0 series victory, including one tie.

The 1982 Memorial Cup was played at Robert Guertin Arena in Hull, Quebec. Kitchener represented the Ontario Hockey League, while left winger Gerard Gallant (34 goals, 92 points in 58 regular season games) and centre John Chabot (34 goals, 143 points in 62 games) were members of the QMJHL&#x27;s Sherbrooke Castors. Centre Ken Yaremchuk (58 goals, 157 points in 72 games) and right winger Brian Shaw (56 goals, 132 points in 69 games) were members of the Western Hockey League champion Portland Winter Hawks.

Kitchener lost 10-4 to Sherbrooke in their opener before rebounding with a 9–2 win over Portland in game two. Brian Bellows scored 11 seconds into the game against Portland, setting a Memorial Cup record. In their third game, the Rangers shut out the Castors 4–0. The game was very physical, and included a bench-clearing brawl in the second period. Kitchener seemed to be a bit worn out the next night, losing 4–2 to Portland.

The Rangers and the Castors made it to the finals on a better goals for and against total, after all three teams won and lost two games each in the round-robin. The final game drew 4,091 spectators who saw Bellows score a hat trick and add two assists, propelling the Rangers to a 7–4 victory and their first Memorial Cup championship.

In 1982–83, the Rangers finished with a 45-23-2 record and a second-place finish in the Emms Division. After a first round bye they faced the North Bay Centennials in Round 2 and won the series, 4–1. They would meet the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds for the third consecutive year in the playoffs but this time the Hounds won the series, 4–2 with one tie, eliminating the Blueshirts from post-season play.

====1984 Memorial Cup====
Even before the season began the Rangers knew they would be returning to the Memorial Cup for the third time in four seasons, as they were awarded the right to host the event in 1984. Tom Barrett took over coaching duties prior to the campaign, which saw Kitchener post the best record in the OHL (52-16-2) with 106 points. The Rangers were led offensively by right winger Wayne Presley (63 goals, 139 points in 70 regular season games) and centre John Tucker (40 goals, 100 points in 39 games). Tucker would go on to be named the OHL&#x27;s Most Outstanding Player, while Presley was the top scoring right winger. Shawn Burr (41 goals, 85 points in 68 games) was the league&#x27;s Rookie of the Year.

At the end of the regular season, Kitchener earned its third straight first round bye before sweeping the London Knights, 4–0, in the second round. The Rangers avenged the previous season&#x27;s loss to Sault Ste. Marie by winning that series, 4–3. Kitchener then faced the Ottawa 67&#x27;s in a rematch of the 1982 OHL Finals, but this time the 67&#x27;s won the series, 3–0, with two ties.

Kitchener represented the host team in the tournament, while the 67&#x27;s - including right winger Don McLaren (53 goals, 113 points in 70 games), left winger Gary Roberts (27 goals, 57 points in 48 games) and goaltender Darren Pang - represented the Ontario Hockey League as champions. The Western Hockey League was represented by centre Dean Evason (49 goals, 137 points in 57 games), defenceman Doug Bodger (21 goals, 98 points in 70 games) and the Kamloops Junior Oilers, while the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League champion Laval Voisins featured a 17-year-old Mario Lemieux who tallied 133 goals and 282 points in 70 regular-season games that year.

Kitchener defeated Laval 8–2 in game one, holding Lemieux scoreless. In game two, Kitchener had an 8–0 lead over Kamloops but narrowly held on to win the game 9–7. Ottawa had also won its first two games. The Rangers faced the 67&#x27;s in the final game of round-robin play, posting a 7–2 victory to earn a berth in the finals. Ottawa won their semi-final, 7–2, for the right to play Kitchener for the championship where they would also hand the Rangers a 7–2 defeat to win the Memorial Cup.

Following the 1984 Memorial Cup, the Rangers would finish sixth (1984–85), third (1985–86), fourth (1986–87) and sixth (1987–88) in their division before reclaiming top spot in the Emms with a 41-19-6 record in 1988–89. Goaltender Gus Morschauser was named the OHL Goaltender of the Year, but the Rangers were upset in the first round of the playoffs by the North Bay Centennials.

===The 1990s===
====1990 Memorial Cup====
In 1989–90, the Rangers finished second overall in the Emms Division (38-21-7) but used their experience to prevail through the playoffs. Kitchener earned a 4–1 series win over the North Bay Centennials before earning a second-round bye. They defeated the Niagara Falls Thunder in the third round, 4–1, setting up a final vs. an Oshawa Generals team which featured Eric Lindros (17 goals, 36 points in 25 games). The Rangers took a 3–1 series lead before the Generals won three straight games en route to the J. Ross Robertson Cup as OHL champions.

The 1990 Memorial Cup was played at Copps Coliseum in Hamilton, Ontario. The Dukes of Hamilton were slated to host the tournament, but due to af poor start to their season they finished last place in the league (11-49-6). They were removed from participation, and the Rangers, as league finalists, took their place.

The other two opponents Kitchener would face in the Memorial Cup were the same opponents they faced the last time they played in the tournament; the QMJHL&#x27;s Laval Titan (formerly Voisins) and the WHL&#x27;s Kamloops Blazers (formerly Junior Oilers). Kitchener won their opener vs. Kamloops, 8–7 in overtime. They followed that up with a 5–3 win over Laval. Similar to 1984, both Ontario-based team were undefeated after two games and faced each other in the last game of the round-robin. The game was played in front of 11,134 fans, lasting 4 hours 15 minutes into double overtime, with Oshawa winning 5–4. Kitchener then played Laval in the semi-finals, claiming a 5–4 victory.

The Rangers played the Generals in the tournament final with 17,383 fans in attendance. Much like the first game between the two teams, the championship went into double overtime with the Generals emerging as victors, 4–3.

Following the 1990 Memorial Cup run, the remainder of the decade was lackluster for Kitchener. The team managed three winning seasons (32-30-4 in 1992–93, and 35-28-3 in 1995–96) with their best season coming in 1996–97 with a Central Division title and a record of 34-22-10.

The Rangers earned a first-round bye during the playoffs that year, and claimed a 7–3 win over the Sarnia Sting in Game 7 of Round 2. They fell behind, 3–1, in their third round series vs. the Oshawa Generals before winning Game 5, 5–4. But after games in three straight days and five games in their last six, the two teams had a three-day break before resuming their series. After the break, the Raiders lost 6–1 in Game 6, dropping the series, 4–2.

The final two campaigns of the decade would see the team finish beneath .500, where they would remain until the early 2000s.

===The 2000s===
After missing the playoffs for the second time in three years (1998–99 and 2000–01), the team fired general manager Jamie McDonald, who earlier released Jess Snyder of his duties as head coach. Prior to the start of the 2001–02 season, Peter DeBoer was named the team&#x27;s new head coach. He would lead them to a 35-22-10-1 record and a third-place finish in the Midwest Division, culminating in a first round playoff matchup with division rival, the Guelph Storm. The Storm would sweep the season series, 4–0.

In 2002-03 the Rangers brought in Steve Spott, a former assistant to Peter DeBoer in their days with the Plymouth Whalers, into the fold. The team, which featured the likes of Mike Richards, Derek Roy, Gregory Campbell and David Clarkson, began the season three losses and a tie in their first four games. After reaching mid-October with a record of 3-3-2-1 the team&#x27;s record improved, winning eight in a row (11-3-2-1). During November and December they lost just five games, and sported a 26-8-3-1 record as the calendar year changed to 2003. It wasn&#x27;t until January 12 when they lost their tenth game of the season, and they rebounded with their 30th win of the campaign the following game on January 17. They only lost back-to-back games once from January on; the final two games of the regular season.

The Rangers finished the campaign with a record of 46-14-5-3 (W-L-T-OTL), winning the Midwest Division; those 46 wins setting a new franchise best. Their division title set up a first-round playoff matchup with the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds, who the Rangers beat in four straight games. The Greyhounds managed just three goals in the series, being shut out twice by goaltender Scott Dickie in Games 1 and 2. The Rangers faced the Guelph Storm in Round 2, dropping their Highway 7 rivals in five games. Round 3 saw them face the Plymouth Whalers. After skating to a 2–2 series tie through the first four games, the Whalers claimed a 2–1 overtime win at The Aud to take a 3–2 lead. The Rangers earned a 7–4 win in Game 6 to stay alive, then skated to a berth in the OHL Final with a 3–1 win in Game 7.

In the league championship they would take on the eastern conference champion Ottawa 67&#x27;s. The 67&#x27;s picked up a 3–2 overtime win in Game 1, but from thereon out it was all Kitchener as the Rangers won the next four games to be crowned J. Ross Robertson Cup champions for the third time in their history. Of the five-game series, three games went to overtime including the series clinching game which was decided in double OT. Derek Roy was named the MVP of the playoffs.

====2003 Memorial Cup====
The 2003 Memorial Cup was played at Colisée Pepsi in Quebec City, Quebec. Kitchener represented the champions of the Ontario Hockey League, while defencemen Josh Georges, Duncan Keith and Shea Weber were members of the Western Hockey League champion Kelowna Rockets. The Hull Olympiques - featuring forwards Max Talbot and Jean-Michel Daoust - were the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League champions while the host Quebec Remparts were led by forwards David Masse and Josh Hennessy.

Kitchener went through the round-robin undefeated, beating the Remparts 4–3 in their opener, the Olympiques, 4–1 in their second game, and the Rockets, 4–2. In the championship final, the Rangers jumped out to a 1–0 lead on a goal by Andre Benoit just 1:45 into the game, and were up 2-0 after a Gregory Campbell power play goal at 3:32. Evan McGrath&#x27;s first of two second period goals made it 3-0 Kitchener, as the Rangers and Olympiques each tallied three goals a piece in the middle frame. With the Rangers holding a 5–3 lead through 40 minutes of play, David Clarkson added another with 2:38 to play to secure the club&#x27;s second Memorial Cup title, defeating Hull, 6–3.

The following season the Rangers finished with a modest record of 34-26-6-2 as they competed with division rivals, the London Knights and Guelph Storm, who each finished the campaign with more than 100 points. Their first round playoff match-up was against the Plymouth Whalers, but besides eking out a 5–4 win in Game 3, the Rangers were handily defeated in the series, 4–1.

In 2004–05, the Rangers once again finished the regular season third in the Midwest Division (35-20-9-4), but their run in the playoffs was much longer than the prior year&#x27;s. After defeating the Erie Otters in six games, Kitchener went on to sweep the Owen Sound Attack in Round 2. Their third round match-up was vs. the London Knights, but after skating through a 1–1 series tie after the first two games, the Knights won the next three and eliminated the Rangers in five games.

Despite registering a franchise-best 47 wins the following year in 2005-06 (47–19–1–1) (W–L–OTL–SOL), the Blueshirts and their 96-point campaign was second-best to the London Knights (49 wins, 102 points) in the Midwest Division standings. But after such a successful regular season, in the first round of the playoffs the Owen Sound Attack (who finished 25 points behind Kitchener in the regular season), dropped the Rangers in five games in the opening round.

The 2006–07 saw the team once again turning out another 47-win campaign (47–17–1–3, 98 points), but they again finished second in the Midwest Division to the London Knights (50–14–1–3, 104 points). The Rangers barreled out of the first round, sweeping the Sarnia Sting, 4–0, but were halted by the Plymouth Whalers, 4–1, in Round 2.

In May 2007, it was announced that the Rangers would host the 2008 Memorial Cup, giving the team an automatic entry into the tournament. The 2007-08 team finished with a regular season record of 53-11-1-3, which remains a franchise best in wins and points to this day. They were crowned the winners of the Hamilton Spectator Trophy as the team with the most points (110) in the OHL through the regular season.

In the opening round of the playoffs the Rangers downed the Plymouth Whalers in four straight games, outscoring their opponents, 29–13. In Round 2 it was another sweep for the Blueshirts, this time against the Sarnia Sting. The Rangers surrendered just six goals in those four games, outscoring Sarnia, 18–4. In the third round they met the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds, but again skated to victory, this time with a 4–1 series win. The Ontario Hockey League final pitted the Rangers against the eastern conference champion Belleville Bulls. A 3-0 Rangers series lead evaporated into a 3–3 tie, but the Rangers earned their fourth Ontario Hockey League championship with a 4–1 win over the Bulls in the finale.

====2008 Memorial Cup====
The 2008 Memorial Cup was played at the Kitchener Memorial Auditorium in Kitchener, Ontario. Kitchener represented both the champions of the Ontario Hockey League and the host team. As league finalists, the Belleville Bulls (featuring Matt Beleskey; 41 goals, 90 points in 62 regular season games and PK Subban; eight goals, 46 points in 58 games) also earned a berth in the tournament as representatives of the OHL. Jared Spurgeon, Tyler Johnson, Jared Cowen and Dustin Tokarski were members of the Western Hockey League champion Spokane Chiefs. The Gatineau Olympiques - featuring forwards Claude Giroux, Matthew Pistilli and Paul Byron - were the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League champions.

Kitchener won its first game of the tournament, 6–5 in overtime, vs. Gatineau, before dropping a 2-1 decision to Spokane in the second game of the round robin. Their third game was a 4–3 overtime loss to Belleville, which set up a semi-final meeting between the two teams two nights later in which the Rangers won, 9–0. During the Kitchener-Spokane final, though, the Chiefs skated to a 4–1 win and a Memorial Cup championship on the Rangers home ice at The Aud. During the trophy presentation, the Chiefs endured an infamous gaffe which saw the Memorial Cup come apart and break while the team was passing it among themselves during their celebration.

Following the Memorial Cup run of 2007–08, head coach Peter DeBoer was hired as head coach of the NHL&#x27;s Florida Panthers and assistant Steve Spott was named the new head coach of the club. After seven straight winning seasons, the team took a step back in the 2008-09 campaign after losing many graduating players from their championship squad. They finished under .500 and fifth in the Midwest Division with a 26-37-3-2 record, missing the playoffs for the first time since 2000–01.

It didn&#x27;t take long to turn things around with Spott at the helm, as the team rebounded with a 34-point improvement the following season, finishing with a record of 42-19-4-3. After a 4–2 series win over the Saginaw Spirit and an 8–3, Game 7 win over the favoured London Knights in Round 2, the Rangers were bounced from the playoffs in the third round by the Windsor Spitfires in Game 7 after holding a 3–0 series lead. The Spitfires would go on to win their first of back-to-back Memorial Cups.

====Ben Fanelli incident====
On October 30, 2009, 16-year-old rookie defenceman Ben Fanelli was hit from behind by 20-year-old overage forward Michael Liambis of the Erie Otters at a high speed behind the Rangers&#x27; net. The hit, which came at the 7:52 mark of the second period, occurred with such force that it caused Fanelli&#x27;s helmet to fly off before his head struck a glass partition at the Zamboni entrance. He would suffer a fractured skull and orbital bone and was immediately airlifted to Hamilton General Hospital where he was placed in intensive care. Fanelli was released from Hamilton General Hospital a week later on November 6, 2009. Liambas was suspended for the remainder of the season and the playoffs. After an absence of nearly two years, Fanelli returned to the Rangers and later became team captain. He was named the recipient of the Dan Snyder Memorial Trophy as the OHL Humanitarian of the Year, and also named the CHL Humanitarian of the Year.

===The 2010s===
The 2009–10 season was highlighted by a 50-goal campaign by Jeff Skinner, followed by a 47-goal effort by Jeremy Morin. The team would finish the regular season third in the western conference with a record of 42-19-4-3 for 91 points. After defeating the Saginaw Spirit in six games in Round 1, and the London Knights in Game 7 of Round 2, the Rangers took a 3–0 series lead over the Windsor Spitfires in the Western Conference Final but surrendered four straight games to the eventual Memorial Cup champion Spits, who never lost another game after Game 3 vs. the Rangers en route to the CHL championship.

The Rangers once again finished third in the conference in 2010–11, and were led by overage Jason Akeson (24G - 84A = 108 points). Down 3–1 in their best-of-seven opening round playoff series vs. the Plymouth Whalers, the Rangers battled back to force a Game 7 but fell short in the deciding game, 4–2. Akeson earned a slew of awards at season&#x27;s end, including the Eddie Powers Memorial Trophy as the OHL Top Scorer, Jim Mahon Memorial Trophy as the OHL Top Scoring Right Winger, the William Hanley Trophy as OHL Most Sportsmanlike Player, and the Leo Lalonde Memorial Trophy as OHL Top Overage Player.

In 2011–12, Tobias Rieder breached the 40-goal mark, potting 42 goals and 85 points to lead the team offensively. The team returned to the Western Conference Final after a 4–1 series win in Round 1 vs. the Owen Sound Attack, a 4–3 series win vs. the Plymouth Whalers in Round 2, but were swept in Round 3 by the London Knights. Chief Operating Officer and Governor, Steve Bienkowski, was named the CHL&#x27;s Executive of the Year.

The team slipped to fourth in the western conference standings in 2012–13 but advanced to Round 2 of the playoffs after a 4–1 series win over the Guelph Storm. The London Knights skated to a 4–1 series win of their own to end the Rangers&#x27; postseason. Ben Fanelli was named as both the winner of the Dan Snyder Memorial Award as the OHL&#x27;s Humanitarian of the Year, and the CHL Humanitarian of the Year.

The team took a step back in 2013–14, falling to ninth place in the conference standings (22-41-2-3 = 49 points) and missing the playoffs for the first time since 2008–09. The finish led to the Rangers selecting second overall in the upcoming 2014 OHL Priority Selection where they chose left winger Adam Mascherin.

In 2014–15, the team saw a 25-point increase from the season prior, finishing 6th in the western conference with a record of 32-26-3-7 (74 points). They returned to the playoffs, but fell to the London Knights, 4–2, in the opening round.

The team improved by another 21 points the following season, finishing with a record of 44-17-5-2 (95 points) under the tutelage of new head coach Mike Van Ryn in 2015–16. Forwards Ryan MacInnis and Adam Mascherin led the team in points with 81, and Jeremy Bracco had the second-longest point streak in Rangers&#x27; franchise history from October 7 - December 9 (26 games), tallying 17 goals and 34 assists for 51 points in that span. The team advanced to the second round of the playoffs for the first time since 2012–13 with a 4–1 series win vs. the Windsor Spitfires before falling in four straight games to the London Knights in Round 2.

After one season behind the Rangers bench, head coach Mike Van Ryn left the team, and associate coach Jay McKee was named the team&#x27;s new skipper in 2016–17. Adam Mascherin reached the 100-point milestone (35G, 63A) to lead the team in scoring. Down 2–1 in their opening round playoff series vs. the Owen Sound Attack, Rangers goaltender Luke Opilka made 64 saves on 70 shots in Game 4. Owen Sound outshot Kitchener 30–5 in the first period of play, 12–10 in the second, and 29–5 in the third for a game total of 71–20. The Attack would take the best-of-seven series in five games to eliminate the Rangers from the playoffs.
Prior to the 2017–18 season the team acquired defenceman, Memorial Cup champion and Waterloo native, Logan Stanley, from the Windsor Spitfires. Over the course of the season they also added players including Kole Sherwood, Givani Smith, Austin McEneny, Logan Brown and Mario. In the regular season, the team claimed its first Midwest Division championship (43-21-3-1, 90 points) in ten years. They claimed victories in both Round 1 (4-2 vs. Guelph) and Round 2 (4-2 vs. Sarnia) before meeting the CHL&#x27;s top ranked Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds in the Western Conference Final. 

After a literal last-second goal gave the Greyhounds a 3–2 win in the Soo in Game 1, the &#x27;Hounds went up 2–0 in the series following a 4–2, Game 2 win. When the series shifted back to Kitchener, Mario Culina backstopped the team to a 24-save, 3–0 shutout in Game 3, and a seven-goal offensive onslaught - powered by a four-point game by Joseph Garreffa - propelled the Rangers to a 7–4 win and tied the series, 2-2. The Rangers fell, 7–3, in Game 5 and played Game 6 back at The Aud two days later. The Rangers led, 3–2, late in the third period but the Greyhounds tied the game with a power play goal with just 1:25 to play, sending the game to overtime. Kole Sherwood extended the Rangers playoff hopes, and the series, by scoring the game-winning goal at 13:12 to force a deciding Game 7. In the clinching game, the teams exchanged goals throughout the night, the Rangers erasing 1-0 and 2-1 leads. With the Greyhounds leading 3–2 in the final minutes of regulation, Logan Stanley blasted a shot from the point that beat goaltender Matthew Villalta and tied the game, 3-3, with just 51 seconds remaining and sent the game to overtime. After a scoreless first overtime period, the game was finally decided in double OT when a Jack Kopacka shot deflected past Culina to win the series for the Greyhounds, affording them a berth into the Ontario Hockey League Final.

==Players==
===Honoured numbers===
The Rangers do not retire numbers (except for the no. 1 which is dedicated to the fans) but choose to honour numbers instead; hanging banners from the rafters while still having them in use for present players. Honoured numbers include five Rangers alumni who were later elected into the Hockey Hall of Fame:

*# 3 Scott Stevens
*# 4 Al MacInnis
*# 6 Paul Coffey
*# 7 Bill Barber

Two other numbers are also raised to the rafters of the Kitchener Memorial Auditorium, honouring two former Rangers who lost their lives at a young age:

*# 21 Gary Crosby

Gary Crosby was a member of the Rangers for two seasons from 1968 to 1970. The centre was tragically killed in the early morning hours of July 29, 1972 in a head-on collision on Highway 7, eleven kilometers west of Stratford. Crosby was 20 years old.

*# 22 Jim McGeachie

Jim McGeachie was a member of the Rangers for two seasons from 1978 to 1980. The left winger was tragically killed in May 1980, after his red Ford Pinto was hit by an oncoming vehicle along Highway 9 near Teviotdale while he was a member of the Rangers. McGeachie was 19 years old.

The Kitchener Rangers play home games at the Kitchener Memorial Auditorium Complex. The Auditorium was built in 1951 and underwent major renovations in 2002. In 2007–08, over 500 seats were added to accommodate larger crowds for the 2008 Memorial Cup. Over the 2012 off-season, The Aud was once again expanded with the addition of close to 1,000 seats, as well as an upper concourse and improvements to team dressing rooms and business offices. The Kitchener Memorial Auditorium Complex includes Jack Couch Park for baseball, Kiwanis and Kinsmen ice pads in the arena, and the main Auditorium arena known as the Dom Cardillo Arena. Centennial Stadium (football) was demolished in Spring, 2013 due to safety concerns.

* Capacity = 7,068 seats + 632 standing room = total capacity of 7,700
* Ice size = 192&#x27; x 85&#x27;

The Auditorium hosted the Memorial Cup tournament in 1962, 1975, 1984 and 2008. The OHL All-Star Game was played there in 1980 &amp; 1985 as well as the CHL Top Prospects Game in 2003 and in 2021.

<text>Interstate 880 (I-880) is a north–south auxiliary Interstate Highway in the San Francisco Bay Area of Northern California. It runs from I-280 and State Route 17 (SR 17) in San Jose to I-80 and I-580 in Oakland, running parallel to the eastern shore of San Francisco Bay. For most of its route, I-880 is officially known as the Nimitz Freeway, after World War II fleet admiral Chester W. Nimitz, who retired to the Bay Area. The northernmost is also commonly referred to as the Cypress Freeway, after the former alignment of the freeway and its subsequent replacement.

==Route description==

The southern terminus of I-880 is at its interchange with I-280 and SR 17 in San Jose. From there, it heads roughly northeast past San Jose International Airport to US Route 101 (US 101). The Nimitz Freeway then turns northwest, running parallel to the southeastern shore of San Francisco Bay, connecting the cities of Milpitas, Fremont, Newark, Union City, Hayward, and San Leandro before reaching Oakland. In Oakland, I-880 passes by Oakland International Airport, Oakland Coliseum, the Port of Oakland, and Downtown Oakland. The northern terminus of I-880 is in Oakland at the junction with I-80 and I-580 (known as the MacArthur Maze), near the eastern approach of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge.

I-880 between I-238 in San Leandro and the MacArthur Maze is used as the main truck route; trucks over are prohibited through Oakland on I-580.

I-880 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). Officially, the Nimitz Freeway designation is Route 880 from Route 101 to Route 80, as named by Senate Concurrent Resolution 23, Chapter 84 in 1958.

Since the late 1990s, an infamous misconception for certain commuters and businesses in San Jose is that I-880 extends from I-280 to SR 85 in Los Gatos (which would extend the length to ).

===Express lanes===
High-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes along I-880 between the Milpitas–Fremont line at Dixon Landing Road and Lewelling Boulevard in San Lorenzo opened in October 2020. The southbound express lanes extend north to Hegenberger Road in Oakland and south to SR 237 in Milpitas.

, the HOT lanes&#x27; hours of operation is weekdays between 5:00 am and 8:00 pm; they are otherwise free and open to all vehicles at other times. Solo drivers are tolled using a congestion pricing system based on the real-time levels of traffic. Two-person carpools and clean air vehicles with a solo driver are charged 50 percent of the posted toll. Carpools with three or more people and motorcycles are not charged. All tolls are collected using an open road tolling system, and therefore there are no toll booths to receive cash. Each vehicle using the HOT lanes is required to carry a FasTrak &quot;Flex&quot; transponder with its switch set to indicate the number of the vehicle&#x27;s occupants (1, 2, or 3+). Those with clean air vehicles need to apply for a special FasTrak &quot;CAV&quot; tag. Solo drivers may also use the FasTrak standard tag without the switch. Drivers without any FasTrak tag will be assessed a toll violation regardless of whether they qualified for free.

==History==

The state legislature added the proposed San Jose–Richmond East Shore Highway to the state highway system in 1933, and it became an extension of the previously short (San Rafael to the bay) Legislative Route (LRN) 69, and part of Sign Route 13 (soon changed to 17) in 1934. From San Jose, this route temporarily followed existing LRN 5 (present Oakland Road, Main Street, Milpitas Boulevard, and Warm Springs Boulevard) to SR 21 at Warm Springs and then continued along existing county roads and city streets, now known as Fremont Boulevard, Alvarado Boulevard, Hesperian Boulevard, Lewelling Boulevard, Washington Avenue, 14th Street, 44th Avenue, 12th Street, 14th Avenue, 8th Street, and 7th Street, into Downtown Oakland. It then turned north at Cypress Street (now Mandela Parkway), passing through the MacArthur Maze and following a newly constructed alignment (signed as US 40) to El Cerrito.

The first short piece of the new Eastshore Freeway opened to traffic on July 22, 1949, connecting Oak Street downtown with 23rd Avenue. It was extended to 98th Avenue on June 1, 1950, Lewelling Boulevard on June 13, 1952, and Jackson Street (SR 92) on June 5, 1953. At the San Jose end, the overlap with Route 5 between Bayshore Highway (US 101) and Warm Springs was bypassed on July 2, 1954. Within Oakland, the double-decker Cypress Street Viaduct opened on June 11, 1957, connecting the freeway with the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge. The Oakland segment was extended south to Fremont Boulevard at Beard Road on November 14, 1957, and the gap was filled on November 24, 1958, soon after the state legislature named the highway after Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz. (The short spur to Route 5 at Warm Springs (now SR 262) remained in the state highway system as a branch of Route 69.) As these sections opened, Sign Route 17 (and LRN 69) was moved from its old surface routing, which mostly became local streets. Other than Route 5 south of Warm Springs, the portion from San Leandro into Oakland was also kept as part of Route 105 (now SR 185).

===Historic alignments===
====SR 17====

Prior to 1984, the route known as I-880 used to be part of SR 17, which was US 48 from current I-238 to US 101 from 1926 to 1931, then US 101E from 1929 to the mid-1930s. SR 17 used to run from Santa Cruz all the way through San Jose, Oakland, and then continued north via the Eastshore Freeway (I-80) through Richmond to the Richmond–San Rafael Bridge and San Rafael.

In 1984, the segment of SR 17 from I-280 in San Jose to the MacArthur Maze in Oakland was renumbered as I-880, and the portion of SR 17 from the MacArthur Maze to San Rafael was renumbered as part of I-580.

====Nimitz Freeway====
In 1947, construction commenced on a freeway to replace the street routing of SR 17 through the East Bay. The new freeway was named the &quot;Eastshore Freeway&quot;, and, with the subsequent addition of a freeway to replace the Eastshore Highway north of the MacArthur Maze in the mid 1950s, it ran, appropriately, almost the entire length of the east shore of San Francisco Bay. In 1958, following a joint resolution of the California State Legislature, the portion south of the MacArthur Maze was renamed the Nimitz Freeway in honor of WWII Admiral Nimitz, while the portion to the north retained the name Eastshore Freeway. The formal dedication, with the participation of Admiral Nimitz, took place on August 12, 1958.

====Historic US 50 Bus.====
The northern portion of I-880 was designated US 50 Business (US 50 Bus.) for a time between the I-80 interchange and Downtown Oakland.

====Original routing in Sacramento====
From 1971 to 1983, I-880 was the original route designation for the Beltline Freeway, the northern bypass freeway for the Sacramento area. This freeway begins in West Sacramento as a fork from the original I-80, continues northeast over the Sacramento River to its interchange with I-5, continues east through the communities of North Sacramento and Del Paso Heights, and ends at an interchange with the Roseville Freeway (I-80). The now-designated Capital City Freeway was then the original I-80 routing, continuing southwest directly into Downtown Sacramento. I-80 was then rerouted along the Beltline Freeway in 1983, while the Capital City Freeway became I-80 Bus.

===Modern history===
====Cypress Viaduct and the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake====

A large double-decker section in Oakland, known as the Cypress Street Viaduct, collapsed during the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, causing 42 deaths; initial estimates were significantly higher, but, because many commuters on both sides of the bay had left early or stayed late to watch Game 3 of the San Francisco–Oakland World Series, the freeway was far less crowded than normal at the time of the quake.

Due to environmental impact concerns, and the desire by the West Oakland community to reconnect the neighborhood with the rest of the city, among other reasons, a new route was selected along an industrial area and railroad yard around the outskirts of the neighborhood. Although only about in length, the replacement freeway cost over $1.2 billion (equivalent to $ in ), and did not open until 1997 for several reasons: it crossed over and under the elevated Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) line to San Francisco; it squeezed between a postoffice, the West Oakland station, the Port of Oakland, a railyard, and an East Bay Municipal Utility District sewage treatment plant; it occupied an entirely new right-of-way, which required the acquisition of large amounts of valuable industrial real estate near the Port of Oakland; and it had to be earthquake resistant. The former path of the structure was then renamed Mandela Parkway, and the median where the freeway stood became a landscaped linear park.

====Flood plains====
Several aspects of the I-880 facility have been constructed in designated floodplains such as the 1990 and 2004 interchange improvements at Dixon Landing Road. In that case, the FHWA was required to make a finding that there was no feasible alternative to the new ramp system as designed. In that same study, the FHWA produced an analysis to support the fact that adequate wetlands mitigation had been designed into the improvement project.

====Sound barriers====
Due to high sound levels generated from this highway and the relatively dense urban development in the highway corridor, the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) has conducted numerous studies to retrofit the right-of-way with noise barriers. This activity has occurred in Oakland, San Leandro, Hayward, Newark, and Fremont. During the 1989 widening of I-880 in parts of Newark and Fremont, scientific studies were conducted to determine the need for sound walls and to design optimum heights to achieve Federal noise standards.

====No interchange with SR 87/Guadalupe Freeway====
Between Coleman Avenue and 1st Street in San Jose, SR 87 (Guadalupe Freeway) crosses above I-880 without an interchange, making it the only point in California where two freeways cross without a connection. Because of its proximity to the runways at San Jose International Airport, Caltrans cannot construct elevated ramps without them interfering with flight paths. Tunneling underneath to build underground ramps would also make a significant environmental impact to the nearby Guadalupe River.

====Gasoline tanker accident in 2007====
On April 29, 2007, a gasoline tanker overturned and caught fire on the connector between westbound I-80 and southbound I-880 on the MacArthur Maze interchange. The fire caused major damage to both this connector and one directly above (eastbound I-80 onto eastbound I-580). The overpass was replaced and reopened 27 days later. The governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, declared it as a state of emergency and all public transportation was free on the first commute day.

====2012–2015 I-880/I-280 interchange improvement====
Improvements to the I-280/I-880 and Stevens Creek Boulevard interchanges finished early 2015. Changes included breaking up the handful of ramps that both interchanges shared so they would be independent from one another. Construction began in late 2012 and the ramp from I-280 north to I-880 north opened in April 2015.

====I-880 Corridor Improvement Project====
The I-880 Corridor Improvement Project, one of the last seismic retrofit projects of a major transportation corridor in California, consisted of eight separate projects located in a segment of the freeway between Oakland and Hayward.

The overall goal of the project was to improve the seismic safety of the corridor. After the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, Caltrans initiated Phase 1 of its seismic retrofit program. After the 1994 Northridge earthquake, Caltrans initiated Phase 2 of its seismic retrofit program, which included projects along the I-880 corridor. Other goals include reducing traffic congestion and improving road quality.

The individual projects included in the I-880 Corridor Improvement Project were retrofitting or replacing the 5th Avenue, 23rd Avenue, 29th Avenue, Fruitvale Avenue, and High Street bridges in Oakland; improvements to both the I-238 and SR 92 interchanges (the latter, a four-year project, completed in October 2011); and an overall rehabilitation/repaving project along the entire segment. Construction began in 2006, although certain projects were completed in 2020. The total cost of the project is $462.7 million (equivalent to $ in ), provided by federal, state, and regional funds.

<text>Jerez de la Frontera () or simply Jerez, also cited in old English-language sources as , is a city and municipality in the province of Cádiz in the autonomous community of Andalusia, Spain. Located in southwestern Iberia, it lies on the Campiña de Jerez, an inland low-land plain crossed by the Guadalete river, midway the Atlantic Ocean, the Guadalquivir river and the western reaches of the Subbaetic System.

, with 213,105 inhabitants, Jerez is the most-populated municipality in the province of Cádiz. Its municipality covers an area of and includes Los Alcornocales Natural Park.

Winegrowing has long been, particularly upon the transition to modern agro-extractivism in the mid 18th century, the main drive of the economy of Jerez. During the 19th century, the local wine Sherry was overwhelmingly produced for foreign export, catering to the British market in the first place. Throughout this century the city earned a reputation as a paradigm for large landowners, high social inequality, and the winery-related identity.

Since 1987, Grand Prix motorcycle racing has been held at the Circuito de Jerez in early May. The circuit has also hosted several Formula One Grands Prix, including the 1997 European Grand Prix, which decided the 1997 Formula One World Championship. Other festivals in the city un in nclude the Feria de Jerez and the Holy Week.

==Etymology==

The classical Latin name of &quot;Asta Regia&quot;, unrelated to the present name, referred to an ancient city now found within Mesas de Asta, a rural district approximately from the center of Jerez.

The current Spanish-language name came by way of the Arabic-language name &quot;Sharīsh&quot;, used during the Muslim period in Iberia. The placename was rendered as &quot;Xerez&quot; or &quot;Xerés&quot; () in old Romance sources; hence the name of the famous fortified wine, sherry. (&#x27;frontier&#x27;) referred to its location on the border between the Moorish and Christian regions on the Iberian Peninsula during the 13th century. Upon the Modern-era readjustment and simplification of Spanish-language sibilant phonemes (including changed into ) the spelling of the place name ended up being changed accordingly.

The old spelling &quot;Xerez&quot; survived in several foreign languages and led to the name given to sherry: Portuguese , Catalan , English &quot;sherry&quot; , French . The city&#x27;s main football team continues to use the old spelling, &quot;Xerez&quot;.

==History==
===Prehistory and ancient history===
Traces of human presence in the area date from the upper Neolithic, and humans have inhabited Jerez de la Frontera since at least the Copper or Neolithic Age, but the identity of the first natives remains unclear. The first major protohistoric settlement in the area (around the third millennium BC) is attributed to the Tartessians. Jerez later became a Roman city under the name of &quot;Asta Regia&quot; (located 8 km further north at Cortijo el Rosario).

===Middle Ages===
After the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, the Vandals and the Visigoths ruled the area until the Umayyad conquest of Hispania in the early 8th century. In the 11th century it briefly became the seat of an independent taifa. Some years later &#x27;Abdun ibn Muhammad united it with Arcos de la Frontera and ruled both (ca. 1040–1053). In 1053 it was annexed to Seville. From 1145 to 1147 the region of Arcos and Jerez briefly operated as an emirate under the dependency of Granada, led by Abu&#x27;l-Qasim Ahyal. Later the Almohads conquered the city. In the 12th and 13th centuries Jerez underwent a period of great development, building its defense system and setting the current street layout of the old town.

In 1231 the Battle of Jerez took place within Jerez. Christian troops under the command of Álvaro Pérez de Castro, lord of the House of Castro and grandson of Alfonso VII, king of Castile and León, defeated the troops of the Emir Ibn Hud, despite the numerical superiority of the latter. After a month-long siege in 1261, the city surrendered to Castile, but its Muslim population remained. It rebelled and was finally defeated in 1264.

Due to its agriculture-based economy and demographics, Jerez was already a major city of the Lower Andalusia towards the end of the Middle Ages.

Historically, a Jewish community existed in Jerez until the 1492 expulsion of the Jews. Today the street &quot;Juderia&quot;, meaning Jewish quarter in Spanish, in Jerez marks where the old Jewish quarter once existed.

===Early modern period===

The discovery of the Americas and the conquest of Granada, in 1492, made Jerez one of the most prosperous cities of Andalusia through trade and through its proximity to the ports of Seville and Cádiz. Attracted by the economic possibilities offered by the winemaking business, a substantial foreign European population (English, Flemish, Portuguese and, most notably, Genoese) installed in the city. Together with the local wealthy class, they participated in slave ownership.

Despite the social, economic and political decadence that occurred in the seventeenth century, towards the end of the Habsburg rule, the city managed to maintain a reasonable pace of development, becoming world-famous for its wine industry.

===Late modern period===
In January 1892, a peasant uprising took place in Jerez and its violent repression lead to a series of protests and revenge bombings in the next decade.

==Government==
The city of Jerez is governed by the &quot;ayuntamiento&quot; (municipality) of Jerez, whose representatives, as in other towns in Spain, are elected every four years by universal suffrage for all citizens older than 18 years of age. The body is chaired by the mayor of Jerez.

==Economy==

The economy of Jerez has traditionally been centred on the wine industry, with exports of sherry worldwide. Because it lacks the civil service that other cities enjoy, Jerez has based its economy on industry. The cultivation of fruits, grains, and vegetables and horse and cattle husbandry has also been important to the local economy. It is the home base for the Spanish Military Stud farm, the Yeguada Militar de Jerez de la Frontera.

After the wine crisis in the 1990s, the city is now seeking to expand its industrial base. Tourism has been successfully promoted. The city&#x27;s strong identity as a center for wine, flamenco, and horses, its popular festivals, MotoGP hosting and its historical heritage have contributed to this success.

The city is the home of Jerez Airport and has also been positioning itself as a logistics hub for western Andalusia, through the integration between the airport, the rail system and nearby ports.

==Geography==
=== Location ===

Jerez de la Frontera is located in the region of Campiña de Jerez, which includes the municipalities of Jerez de la Frontera and San José del Valle. The territory of the region corresponds to the previous municipality of the city of Jerez, before the disintegration of San José del Valle in 1995. The municipality of Jerez is the largest in the province of Cadiz and the sixth in Spain with 1188 square kilometers.

The region of the Campiña de Jerez is crossed by the Guadalete River. There are several wetlands in its territory, such as the lagoons of Medina and Torrox. There are also the Montes de Propio de Jerez, included in the Natural Park of Los Alcornocales. Its agriculture is known for the designation of origin of its wine, sherry, grown in the triangle formed between Jerez de la Frontera, Sanlúcar de Barrameda and El Puerto de Santa María.

Jerez de la Frontera is located from El Puerto de Santa Maria, from the Atlantic Ocean and from the Strait of Gibraltar. The city is one of the six municipalities that make up the Metropolitan Area of the Bay of Cadiz-Jerez, a polynuclear urban agglomeration formed by the municipalities of Cadiz, Chiclana de la Frontera, Jerez de la Frontera, Puerto Real, El Puerto de Santa Maria and San Fernando located in the Bay of Cadiz.

=== Climate ===
Jerez de la Frontera and the rest of the Cádiz metropolitan area have a Subtropical–Mediterranean climate. For its situation being inland (specially the airport which is further inland than the city), the Atlantic influences are small. Jerez is characterized by mild, short winters with occasional cool nights and hot, long summers with occasional very hot temperatures; unlike the surrounding coastal areas which are characterized by very mild winters and long warm summers. Most of the rain falls from October to January, while the summers are very dry but not rainless. For its situation being inland, the daytime temperatures are higher than in the coast and the lows are cooler, with a difference of at least 10 °C between the highs and the low temperatures of each month. The average annual temperature is during the day and at night. The average annual precipitation is per year, concentrated in the months of October through April. December is the wettest month with . The city averages 53 rainy days, 137 clear days and 2,965 hours of sunshine a year. Snow is extremely rare, and it is even more infrequent than in most of the southern European islands. The last snowfall recorded in the city happened on February 2, 1954. Since then, no snowfall has been recorded.

==Culture==

===Wine===
Jerez is the world capital of sherry, a fortified wine made from white grapes grown near the city of Jerez. Jerez has been a centre of viniculture since the Phoenicians introduced winemaking to Spain in 1100 BC. The Romans continued the practice after they took control of Iberia around 200 BC. The Moors conquered the region in AD 711 and introduced distillation, which led to the development of brandy and fortified wine. Because sherry was a major wine export to the United Kingdom, British families founded many of the Jerez cellars. The city has many &quot;bodegas&quot; (wineries), many of which are of British origin. The most important include:
* González Byass: Manuel María González Angel founded this bodega in 1835, and his English agent, Robert Blake Byass subsequently joined in. The firm produces the fino sherry Tío Pepe.
* Williams &amp; Humbert: This is a winery located in Jerez de la Frontera dedicated to the production of sherry wines and brandies and other liqueurs. Sir Alexander Williams and Arthur Humbert founded it in 1877.
* Grupo Garvey: founded in 1780 by William Garvey Power.
* Grupo Estévez: owns the Marqués del Real Tesoro and Valdespin bodegas. With origins dating from 1430, Valdespino is one of the oldest bodegas in the area.
* Domecq: is a winemaking company founded by Álvaro Domecq Díez&#x27;s father.

Brandy de Jerez is a brandy exclusively produced within the &quot;Sherry Triangle&quot; (which is bounded by Jerez de la Frontera, El Puerto de Santa María and Sanlúcar de Barrameda, all in the province of Cádiz). Brandy de Jerez is used in Spanish cuisine, especially with meats.

===Carthusian breed of horses===

Jerez is the original home of the Carthusian sub-strain of the Andalusian horse breed, known as the &quot;Caballo cartujano&quot; in Spain. In the latter 1400s, the Carthusian monks began breeding horses on lands donated by Álvaro Obertos de Valeto for construction of the Charterhouse of Jerez de la Frontera (&quot;la Cartuja de Jerez de la Frontera&quot;). When the Spanish Crown decreed that Spanish horse breeders should breed their Andalusian stock with Neapolitan and central European stock, the monks refused to comply, and continued to select their best specimens to develop their own jealously guarded bloodline for almost four hundred years.

Jerez is the home of the Royal Andalusian School of Equestrian Art, a riding school comparable to the famous Spanish Riding School of Vienna.

Another famous equine institution headquartered in Jerez is the Yeguada Militar de Jerez de la Frontera (known outside Spain as the Yeguada Militar), the Spanish military stud farm dedicated to the breeding of purebred Andalusian and Arabian horses. Founded in 1847, it became the official stud farm of the Spanish military in 1893.

The 2002 FEI World Equestrian Games were held in Jerez at the Estadio Municipal de Chapín, which was remodeled for the event, from September 10 to September 22, 2002. This was the 4th edition of the games, which are held every four years and run by the FEI.

===Flamenco===
Jerez is proud of its Andalusian Centre of Flamenco, which was founded in 1993 to safeguard and promote the values and standards of flamenco. It is devoted to the investigation, recovery, and collection of flamenco-related historical documents, whether they are in audio, visual, or journalistic form. It also has a collection of flamenco artifacts, including musical instruments, costumes, promotional posters, sheet music, and postcards. The centre operates a museum and library to help educate the public and serve as a resource for scholars. Many of the most famous personalities of the city are or were involved in the performance of flamenco, including La Paquera de Jerez, Lola Flores and José Mercé.

===Festivals===

Since 1987 the Grand Prix motorcycle racing has been held at the Circuito de Jerez in early May. Thousands of motorbikers from around the world come to the city this week to watch the MotoGP race held in Jerez annually. The race is one of the most watched races in Europe.

Another popular festival is the Feria del Caballo (declared a festival of international tourist interest), one of the most famous Spanish fairs, and the most important fair in the province of Cádiz. It is celebrated annually in the Parque González Hontoria for one week in May, occurring always after the Spanish motorcycle Grand Prix. The a fair dedicated mainly to the horse. All booths (&quot;casetas&quot;) at the fair are open to the public, so that attendees may walk into any one of them and enjoy the food, drinks, and dancing. This is one of the main features that differentiates the Feria de Jerez from the rest of the Andalusian Fairs, such as the Seville Fair, where most of the &quot;casetas&quot; are private and only card-holding members are allowed in.

Holy Week in Jerez, as in other cities in Andalusia, commemorates the Passion of Jesus Christ. It is celebrated by Catholic religious brotherhoods and fraternities that perform penance processions on the streets during the last week of Lent, the week immediately before Easter. The Holy Week of Jerez de la Frontera stands out for being one of the most important in Andalusia in terms of number of brotherhoods, quality in its carvings and iconographic sets. Holy Week in Jerez was declared of National Tourist Interest in 1993.

During the Christmas season, from the end of November to the end of December, many &quot;peñas&quot; (religious and cultural clubs) celebrate the holidays with public festivals where anyone can go to drink, eat, dance and sing Christmas carols, accompanied by friction drums called &quot;zambombas&quot;.

There are also:

*Flamenco festival de Jerez
*Carnival of Jerez
*Fiestas de la Vendimia (Declared a festival of international tourist interest)

===Other institutions===

<text>Ivybridge is a town and civil parish in the South Hams, in Devon, England. It lies about east of Plymouth. It is at the southern extremity of Dartmoor, a National Park of England and Wales and lies along the A38 &quot;Devon Expressway&quot; road. There are two electoral wards in Ivybridge East and Ivybridge West with a total population of 11,851.

Mentioned in documents as early as the 13th century, Ivybridge&#x27;s early history is marked by its status as an important crossing-point over the River Erme on the road from Exeter to Plymouth. In the 16th century mills were built using the River Erme&#x27;s power. The parish of Saint John was formed in 1836. Ivybridge became a civil parish in 1894 and a town in 1977.

The early urbanisation and development of Ivybridge largely coincided with the Industrial Revolution. Stowford Paper Mill was built in 1787 and rebuilt again in the 1860s with extensive investment. In 1848 the South Devon Railway arrived on the northern edge of the village. The paper mill closed in 2013 after 226 years in Ivybridge and the buildings are being converted to homes and shops. Ivybridge is often referred to as a commuter town, although a small proportion of people work in the town itself, and agriculture continues to play an economic role for the surrounding area. The area surrounding Ivybridge is varied and complex, including river valleys, farmland and dense woodland.

While heavy industry diminished during the latter half of the 20th century, the population grew significantly from 1,574 people in 1921 to 12,056 in 2001.

==History==

The name Ivybridge is derived from a small 13th century hump-backed bridge of the same name. The Ivy Bridge was the only means of crossing the river until the 1830s although plans were put forward in 1819. &quot;Ivy&quot; was used to describe the bridge, because there was ivy growing along the bridge. As the bridge was the centre of the village and important to its very existence, it was named the &quot;parish of Ivybridge&quot; in 1894.

The first mention of a settlement in the Ivybridge area was the manor of Stowford in the Domesday Book of 1086. Although the first mention of Ivybridge came in 1280 when it was described as &quot;dowry of land on the west side of the River Erme, by the Ivy Bridge.&quot; There was once a chapel, that was on the site of present-day Saint John&#x27;s Church, originating from 1402. From the 16th century onwards mills were built in the town, harnessing the power of the river. Records show that in the 16th century there was a corn mill, a tin mill and an edge mill. One of the mills, &#x27;Glanville&#x27;s Mill&#x27; (a corn mill), was situated where many of the town shops are today and gives its name to the shopping centre. The first church (Saint John&#x27;s) was built in 1790 as a chapel of ease, but 45 years later in 1835 it was consecrated as a district church. The oldest burial in St John&#x27;s church yard is from 1836. In the 1830s the Ivy Bridge lost its position as the only means of crossing the river when the &#x27;New Bridge&#x27; was built joining Fore Street and Exeter Road. Today, this bridge has been modernised so as to carry the increased weight and traffic of the 21st century.
Stowford Mill is depicted on a commemorative coin produced for the town of Ivybridge by Bigbury Mint Ltd, based in Ermington near the town. The 25 mm diameter coin also features the town&#x27;s viaduct which stands at an impressive 104 feet high. The coin was first struck circa 2005 by Bigbury Mint.

In 1977 Ivybridge became a town. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s it underwent a period of rapid growth and was designated as the fastest growing town in Europe, the construction of the A38 &quot;Devon Expressway&quot; adjacent to the town significantly contributed to the town growth during this period.

==Governance==
Ivybridge is represented by five tiers of elected government.

* Ivybridge Town Council forms the lowest tier of local government. Ivybridge town council consists of sixteen council members who are elected from two wards, Ivybridge East and Ivybridge West. The council members are elected every four years and a town mayor is elected every year by the town council members. The town council is responsible for the provision of a number of local services including the management of parks, open spaces, cemeteries and allotments. A committee of the town council reviews all planning applications and makes recommendations to the District Council, which is the planning authority for the town. The town council also represents the views of the town on issues such as local transport, policing and the environment. The town council raises its own tax to pay for these services, known as the parish precept, which is collected as part of the Council Tax. The old town hall in Chapel Place is close to the centre of the town, while the new town hall is at Erme Court.
* The next tier is South Hams District Council. They take care of matters such as local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks and tourism.
* The next tier is Devon County Council, who take care of matters such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire service trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning.
* The Parliament of the United Kingdom is responsible for matters such as education, health and justice.

The town is divided into two wards: Ivybridge East (the half of the parish lying east of the River Erme, plus some of the town&#x27;s eastward expansion into Ugborough parish) and Ivybridge West (the half of the parish west of the river).

Until 1894, Ivybridge was made up of four neighbouring parishes: Harford – north; Ugborough – east; Ermington – south; and Cornwood – northwest. All the parishes&#x27; boundaries met at the Ivy Bridge. In 1836 the parish of Saint John was formed (the name of the church at the time, which was dedicated to John the Evangelist). The parish represented the small central area of present-day Ivybridge. In 1894, St John&#x27;s became a parish church for the newly created parish of Ivybridge. 83 years later the village and civil parish of Ivybridge became a town in 1977. Its local government district has been the South Hams since 1 April 1974.

For Westminster elections, the town forms part of the county constituency of South West Devon. The seat has been held since 2024 by Rebecca Smith for the Conservatives.

== International links ==
Ivybridge&#x27;s first official twinning was with Saint-Pierre-sur-Dives in 1972, before Ivybridge became a town. Since then, it has developed unofficial town twinnings (exchanges) and friendship treaties:

* : Saint-Pierre-sur-Dives, Lower Normandy, since 1972
* : Beverungen, North Rhine-Westphalia, since 1975 (then in West Germany)
* : Bedford, Virginia, since 2004

==Geography==

At coordinates Ivybridge is situated deep in the south western peninsula of England, Ivybridge is from London, from Totnes and from Exeter. The main road in and out of the town (the A38) allows fast access to its nearby city Plymouth for many of Ivybridge&#x27;s commuters.

The topography of Ivybridge is generally hilly. This is because of the River Erme which flows right through the centre of town. To the east and to the west of the river the land is elevated forming a valley. The river first enters the town at above sea level and leaves the town at above sea level. At its height the top of the east and west of the valley is above sea level. The western beacon is a hill that overlooks the town; its peak can be seen from almost anywhere in the town. It is above sea level and above the town. There is also an area of woodland called Longtimber Woods to the north of the town, which attracts many walkers along its riverside path.

The geology of Ivybridge is varied. Throughout most of the town the rock is Old Red Sandstone (correction:this should read ‘heat-altered slates), (sedimentary) from the Devonian period. To the north of the town Granite can be found as it is situated on the slopes of Dartmoor – a large pre-volcanic area of Granite. Along the River Erme large boulders and rocks can be found deposited on its meandering path brought all the way from Dartmoor; the Ivy Bridge itself is made out of Granite.
The built environment in and around Ivybridge is mainly characterised by its suburban streets plans and houses, although in the centre of Ivybridge it&#x27;s mainly characterised by Victorian buildings. From the centre of the town most buildings are terraced and now many of these buildings have been converted into retail outlets along Fore Street – the town&#x27;s central business district. In the middle layer of the town most buildings are semi-detached and built on quite steep roads. More detached houses are found on the outer layers of the city on the east and on the west of the town. Over the past decades the town has been shaped by its two most essential pieces of infrastructure: the railway line to the north and the A38 dual carriageway to the south. No large scaling housing has been built on either side of these boundaries. Due to this Ivybridge has been forced to grow east and west rather than north and south; it stretches approximately from east to west and from north to south.

===Climate===
Along with the rest of South West England, Ivybridge has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the British Isles. The annual mean temperature is approximately and shows a seasonal and a diurnal variation, but due to the modifying effect of the sea the range is less than in most other parts of the British Isles. February is the coldest month with mean minimum temperatures between and . July and August are the warmest months with mean daily maxima over .

The climate of South West England has a favoured location with respect to the Azores high pressure when it extends its influence north-eastwards towards the British Isles, particularly in summer. Coastal areas have average annual sunshine totals over 1,600 hours.

Rainfall tends to be associated with Atlantic depressions or with convection. The Atlantic depressions are more vigorous in autumn and winter and most of the rain which falls in those seasons in the south-west is from this source. Average annual rainfall is around . The number of days with snow falling is typically less than ten per winter. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, with June to August having the lightest winds. The predominant wind direction is from the south-west and, as a result, the air quality in Ivybridge may be reduced by the (proposed) construction of an incinerator southwest of the town (at the New England Quarry) with possible implications for health.

==Demography==

Ivybridge&#x27;s most recent census indicates that Ivybridge had a population of 11,851. The United Kingdom Census 2011 was carried out by the Office for National Statistics in England and Wales, on Sunday, 27 March 2011. To put that figure into comparison with the area surrounding Ivybridge: it accounts for about 14% of the South Hams&#x27; total population (83,140) and it accounts for about 1% of Devon&#x27;s total population (1,133,800). The town has a median age of 42 (up from 36 since 2001), which is above the national average of 39.

The ethnicity of Ivybridge is predominately white with 98.7% of the population identifying themselves as such. This is slightly higher than the local average of the South Hams (98.3%) and much higher than the national average for England (85.5%). Of the remaining ethnic groups, 0.7% are mixed, 0.5% are Asian, 0.1% are Black and 0.1% are classed as &quot;other&quot;.

==Economy==

Ivybridge&#x27;s earliest known economy relied on the River Erme with a corn mill, tin mill and an edge mill in existence in the town. Later development of the town relied on both the River Erme and the railway, which was built in the latter part of the Industrial Revolution of the United Kingdom. The largest employer to the town from 1787 Stowford Paper Mill, which led to population growth in the town. The paper mill closed in 2013. With the expansion of the town in the late 20th century much of the new jobs are in the service sector of industry. Due to the A38 Ivybridge&#x27;s transport to nearby city Plymouth was made possible as a commuter route. As a result, a lot of Ivybridge&#x27;s work or &quot;economy&quot; is made in Plymouth and nearby towns. Ivybridge does still have some of its own industry with a small industrial estate at the south of the town and very nearby an industrial estate just to the west at Lee Mill. There have been attempts to brand the town as a walking centre for southern Dartmoor. There is good access to Dartmoor from the town. For example, one route follows the route of the old china clay railway to Redlake in the heart of the moor, another follows the Erme through Longtimber Woods. There are other accesses to the Moor. The Two Moors Way, which crosses Dartmoor and Exmoor starts in Ivybridge and finishes in Lynmouth on the North Devon coast.

The shopping area is mainly along Fore Street and Glanvilles Mill and provides many jobs and services for the town, although the local schools combine to be the biggest employers. There are some out of town jobs at the Tesco Extra superstore at Lee Mill and Endsleigh Garden &amp; Leisure (Wyevale). The town has six traditional public houses: The Sportsmans, the Trehill Arms, the Exchange, the Old Smithy, the Duke of Cornwall and the Imperial.

==Landmarks==
The town&#x27;s natural landmark is Western Beacon; a hill that overlooks the town. People walk up there for the views of Ivybridge and the South Hams. The town&#x27;s first manmade landmark is the Ivy Bridge; a 13th-century hump-backed bridge covered in Ivy. It is still in use today and gives the name of the town – Ivybridge. The two remaining industrial landmarks of the town are the viaduct over the River Erme and the paper mill. The original viaduct was built by Isambard Kingdom Brunel in 1848, only the granite piers remain. The operational line alongside was built by Sir James Charles Inglis opened in 1894 for the Great Western Railway. It still carries the mainline trains. They were key to the town&#x27;s initial growth in the Industrial Revolution and are still importance to the town today. In the centre of the town a war memorial, equidistant from three of the churches, was unveiled in 1922 and each year on Remembrance Day the town holds a ceremony to those who lost their lives. In recent years another memorial has also been built nearby commemorating the lives of American servicemen stationed in and near the town in 1943–1944, many of whom died on Omaha Beach on D-Day. The &quot;Watermark&quot; is one of the town&#x27;s modern landmarks, which began construction in 2007 and was completed in March 2008 at a cost of £1.4 million. It functions as a library, entertainment venue, cinema and offers office space.

==Transport==
Ivybridge has long been a staging post on the Exeter to Plymouth road dating back to the 13th century and the &quot;Ivy Bridge&quot; was the only way over the River Erme at the time. The bridge itself is still in use to this day taking cars (one-way) and pedestrians across the river. In the 1830s a new bridge was built at the top of Fore Street (approximately 130 yards down the river). It is now used as a 1-way road across the river for vehicles and a separate pedestrian bridge lies alongside it. Another bridge (Marjorie Kelly Way/B3213, built in the 1990s) is situated at the bottom of Fore Street. In 1974 the A38 road was opened linking Ivybridge to Plymouth and Exeter. It was the first major trunk road for Ivybridge and was bypassed at the B3213, which runs through the centre of Ivybridge and connects it to the nearby villages of Bittaford and Wrangaton.

The first railway station at Ivybridge was not complete when the South Devon Railway was opened, but was brought into use six weeks later on 15 June 1848. The building was situated on the north side of the track, immediately to the west of Ivybridge Viaduct. Passenger trains were withdrawn in 1959 and the goods facility closed in 1965. On 15 July 1994 a new station was opened on a new site costing £380,000, outside the town, to the east. It is operated by Great Western Railway who run links to London Paddington via Exeter and also south west to Cornwall. The station is advertised as a Park and Ride for the nearby city of Plymouth, although the level of service is infrequent and sporadic.

The town has a bus service (Gold) to Plymouth, Totnes, Paignton and Torquay operated by Stagecoach South West. It operates a half hourly route with Ivybridge as a primary stop. The X38 bus to Exeter is every 2 hours, and is also operated by Stagecoach South West. Plymouth Citybus operate the hourly 20A service to Plymouth, via Lee Mill and Plympton. This is a popular bus with shoppers, as it calls at the Tesco Superstore in Lee Mill.

==Shopping==
The shopping area is mainly along Fore Street, with some small shops and restaurants situated in the Glanvilles Mill shopping centre which is accessible from Fore Street and the car park.

==Education==
The town has six schools: four state primary schools, the Dame Hannah Roger&#x27;s special school, and Ivybridge Community College, the town&#x27;s secondary state school, which has a sixth form. It has specialist status as a sports college and has recently been given awards in science and mathematics as well as languages. The school has a very large catchment area which stretches from Shaugh Prior on Dartmoor, to Bigbury on the coast and covers many of the villages in the South Hams such as Ugborough, Modbury and Yealmpton. There are no independent schools in Ivybridge, but Dame Hannah Rogers School provides a boarding education for children with disabilities and communication needs. The nearest university is the University of Plymouth. In 2008 a new library and resource centre called the Watermark was opened, replacing the small library on Keaton Road. Notable people from the community college include sports teacher Michaela Breeze who won a gold medal weightlifting in the 2002 Commonwealth Games for Wales and won another gold medal in the 2006 Commonwealth Games., Nigel Martin (footballer) was a pupil, Chris Bell, a retired rugby union player with Leeds, Harlequins, Sale Sharks and Wasps, and the school&#x27;s former principal – Geoffrey Rees now retired, who was given a CBE for his services to education.

==Religion==

Ivybridge has five churches. St John&#x27;s Church (Anglican) is the parish church situated in Blachford Road. There is also an Evangelical Baptist church and a Methodist church. On the western outskirts of the town is a Roman Catholic church – St Austin&#x27;s Priory. The Salvation Army Church hold meetings in Fore Street.

In 2011, 65.1% of the population stated that they were Christian, 26.5% stated as no religion and 7.8% did not state their religion. Furthermore, there were a few people stating other religions: 0.3 (31 people) as other religions, 0.2% (18 people) stated as Buddhist, 0.1 (16 people) as Muslim, 0.1% (7 people) as Hindu, and one Jew. Since 2001, there has been a shift from Christian (down 13 percentage points) to non-religious (up 12 points).

<doc id="386251" wikidata="Q110257493" url="?curid=386251" title="African desert warbler">
<text>The African desert warbler (Curruca deserti) is a typical warbler.

==Taxonomy==
Until recently it was considered conspecific with the Asian desert warbler (and called just &quot;desert warbler&quot;), but is now given specific status. The two are still each other&#x27;s closest living relatives, and their relationships to other typical warblers are not clear; they may be fairly close to the common whitethroat. But it seems that all these three taxa are fairly basal members of the genus.

==Distribution and habitat==
The warbler breeds in the deserts of north-western Africa south of the Atlas Mountains from southern Morocco east to western Libya and south to Mali and Niger. It winters in the same area, and does not migrate other than short distances.

==Description==
It is a small bird, marginally the smallest in the genus, 11–12 cm long, and 7–10 g weight. The sexes are almost identical in colour, pale sandy yellow-brown above and whitish below; the bill and legs are yellowish, and the eye has a yellow iris; it differs from the Asian desert warbler in its more yellowish overall colour.

==Behaviour==

Like its relatives, it is insectivorous, but will also take small berries; unlike most warblers, it commonly feeds on the ground. The song is a distinctive jingle often given in an advertisement flight, with clear notes (differing from Asian desert warbler in having few harsh notes). It breeds in desert and semi-desert environments, as long as some scattered bushes for nesting occur. The nest is built in low shrub, and 2–5 eggs are laid.

<doc id="386252" wikidata="Q110257494" url="?curid=386252" title="Asian desert warbler">
<text>The Asian desert warbler (Curruca nana) is a typical warbler which breeds in the deserts of central and western Asia and the extreme east of Europe (Volga Delta area east to western Inner Mongolia in China), and migrating to similar habitats in southwestern Asia (Arabia to northwestern India) and the far northeast of Africa (Red Sea coastal regions) in winter. Until recently it was considered conspecific with the African desert warbler (and called just &quot;desert warbler&quot;), but is now given specific status. The two are still each other&#x27;s closest living relatives, and their relationships to other typical warblers are not clear. They may be fairly close to the common whitethroat; particularly, female whitethroats look much like a richly coloured Asian desert warbler. But it seems that all these three taxa are fairly basal members of the genus.

It is a small bird (the second-smallest in the genus after African desert warbler), 11.5–12.5 cm long. The sexes are almost identical in colour, pale grey-brown above with browner wings and tail, and whitish below; the bill and legs are yellowish, and the eye has a yellow iris. Like its relatives, it is insectivorous, but will also take small berries; unlike most warblers, it commonly feeds on the ground. The song is a distinctive jingle often given in an advertisement flight, with a mix of clear and harsher notes. It breeds in semi-desert and dry steppe environments, as long as some bushes for nesting occur. The nest is built in low shrub, and 4–6 eggs are laid.

It has occurred as a rare vagrant as far west as Great Britain.

The specific &quot;nana&quot; is Latin for &quot;dwarf&quot;, from earlier Ancient Greek &quot;nanos&quot;.

<text>Peter Mark Andrew Phillips (born 15 November 1977) is a British businessman. He is the son of Anne, Princess Royal, and Mark Phillips, and a nephew of King Charles III. At the time of his birth during the reign of his maternal grandmother Elizabeth II, he was 5th in the line of succession to the British throne; as of 2025, he is 19th.

Phillips attended the University of Exeter before working at Jaguar Racing. He is a managing director for SEL UK, a boutique sports management company. He married Autumn Kelly, a Canadian management consultant, in 2008 in St George&#x27;s Chapel at Windsor Castle. They have two children together, separated in 2019, and divorced in 2021.

==Early life and education==

Peter Phillips was born at 10:46 am on 15 November 1977, in the Lindo Wing of St Mary&#x27;s Hospital, London. He was the first child of Princess Anne and Mark Phillips, who had married in 1973, and the first grandchild of Elizabeth II and Prince Philip. At the time of his birth, there was a 41-gun salute from the Tower of London. He was baptised on 22 December 1977 by the Archbishop of Canterbury Donald Coggan in the Music Room of Buckingham Palace. His godparents were his maternal uncle, Prince Charles; Geoffrey Tiarks; Captain Hamish Lochore; Lady Cecil Cameron of Lochiel and Jane Holderness-Roddam.
Phillips was fifth in line to the throne at birth and remained so until the birth of his cousin William, Prince of Wales in 1982. His parents were said to have refused offers from his grandmother Queen Elizabeth II that would have led to his being born in the peerage. Phillips was the first legitimate grandchild of a monarch in more than 500 years to be born without a title or courtesy title. Phillips has a younger sister, Zara Tindall (née Phillips; born 1981), and two younger half-sisters, Felicity Wade (née Tonkin; born 1985), the daughter of Mark Phillips and his former mistress Heather Tonkin; and Stephanie Phillips (born 1997), the daughter from his father&#x27;s second marriage to Sandy Pflueger.

Phillips went to Port Regis Prep School in Shaftesbury, Dorset before following some of his family by attending Gordonstoun School in Moray, Scotland. Whilst at Gordonstoun, he was chosen to be head boy. During his gap year, he went to Sydney and worked for Sports Entertainment Limited (SEL), a company to which he would later return; he also worked for Jackie Stewart&#x27;s Formula One racing team during that time. Phillips represented Scotland at rugby union at youth and junior level in the mid-1990s.

He attended the University of Exeter and graduated with a degree in Sports Science. He played for the Exeter University rugby league team.

==Career==
After his graduation in 2000, Phillips worked for Jaguar as corporate hospitality manager and then for Williams racing team, where he was sponsorship accounts manager. He left Williams in September 2005, for a job as a manager at the Royal Bank of Scotland in Edinburgh. In March 2012, he left RBS to take on a role as managing director at SEL UK.

In August 2012, he was guest of honour at the Rugby league Challenge Cup Final between Warrington Wolves and Leeds Rhinos at Wembley.

In the year leading up to June 2016, Phillips was responsible for organising the &quot;Patron&#x27;s Lunch&quot;, in celebration of the Queen&#x27;s 90th birthday. It included a parade down The Mall and a hamper picnic for 10,000 guests.

In January 2020, Phillips appeared in an advertisement for Chinese company Bright Food. In the video, he uses his status as a &quot;British royal family member&quot; to promote the company&#x27;s milk, while surrounded by luxury.

==Personal life==

Phillips dated Elizabeth Iorio, a cod liver oil heiress from the United States, for two years. In 2001 they lived together for eight months. Later, he had a four-month relationship with Tara Swain, a flight attendant.

In 2003, Phillips met Autumn Kelly, a Canadian management consultant, at the Formula 1 Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal. Their engagement was announced on 28 July 2007.

Kelly, who was raised in the Catholic Church, was received into the Church of England before her marriage. If she had been Roman Catholic at the time of the marriage, Phillips would have lost his place in the line of the succession to the throne because of since-repealed terms of the Act of Settlement 1701. Shortly before their wedding, the couple were interviewed and photographed by &quot;Hello!&quot; magazine, and were reported to have been paid £500,000, resulting in some concern in royal circles. They married on 17 May 2008 at St George&#x27;s Chapel in Windsor Castle. The service was conducted by David Conner, the Dean of Windsor.
The couple lived in Hong Kong after Phillips changed positions within the Royal Bank of Scotland and became head of their sponsorships activities in the region.

Their first child, and the Queen&#x27;s first great-grandchild, a daughter named Savannah Anne Kathleen, was born on 29 December 2010 at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital. The Queen was present for the baby&#x27;s baptism, which took place on 23 April 2011 at Church of the Holy Cross in Avening, Gloucestershire, near Gatcombe Park, the home of Phillips&#x27; mother. Savannah was born 12th in the line to the throne and is now 20th. On 29 March 2012, the couple&#x27;s second daughter, Isla Elizabeth, was born at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital. She was born 13th in the line to the throne and is now 21st.

On 11 February 2020, Phillips and his wife confirmed that they had separated in 2019 and announced they were planning to divorce. The divorce was settled on 14 June 2021.

After his divorce, Phillips began a relationship with Lindsay Wallace in 2021, with whom he made his official debut as a couple at the Epsom Derby in June 2022. The two ended their relationship in 2024.

On 17 September 2022, during the period of official mourning for Queen Elizabeth II, Phillips joined his sister and six cousins to mount a 15-minute vigil around the coffin of their grandmother as it lay in state at Westminster Hall. On 19 September 2022, he joined the Queen&#x27;s children and other senior members of the royal family in walking behind the cortege in the state funeral procession.

By June 2024, Phillips had introduced his partner, NHS paediatric nurse and freelance writer Harriet Sperling (née Sanders), great-great niece of Raymond Courage, Lord of the Manor of Edgcote, to King Charles and Queen Camilla.

<doc id="386257" wikidata="Q427974" url="?curid=386257" title="Operation Gold">
<text>Operation Gold (also known as Operation Stopwatch by the British) was a joint operation conducted by the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the British MI6 Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) in the 1950s to tap into landline communication of the Soviet Army headquarters in Berlin using a tunnel into the Soviet-occupied zone. This was a much more complex variation of the earlier Operation Silver project in Vienna.

The plan was activated in 1954 because of fears that the Soviets might be launching a nuclear attack at any time, having already detonated a hydrogen bomb in August 1953 as part of the Soviet atomic bomb project. Construction of the tunnel began in September 1954 and was completed in eight months. The Americans wanted to hear any warlike intentions being discussed by their military and were able to listen to telephone conversations for nearly a year, eventually recording roughly 90,000 communications. The Soviet authorities were informed about Operation Gold from the very beginning by their mole George Blake but decided not to &quot;discover&quot; the tunnel until April 21, 1956, in order to protect Blake from exposure.

Some details of the project are still classified, and whatever authoritative information could be found was scant until recently. This was primarily because the then-Director of Central Intelligence (DCI), Allen Dulles, had ordered &quot;as little as possible&quot; to be &quot;reduced to writing&quot; when the project was authorized. In 2019, additional specifics became available.

==Background==
After the Red Army followed the Soviet diplomatic department and transferred its most secure communications from radio to telephone landlines, the post-World War II Western Allies lost a major Cold War source of information. Operation Gold, was hence, at least the third tunnel built to aid intelligence in the Cold War period after the end of World War II. From 1948 onwards, under Operation Silver, the British SIS had undertaken a number of such operations in then still occupied-Vienna, the information from which enabled the restoration of Austrian sovereignty in 1955. The KGB later commissioned the Red Army to construct a tunnel to tap into a cable that served the major US Army garrison in Berlin.

==Operational agreement==
In early 1951, the CIA undertook an assessment process for replacing lost Soviet radio communications intelligence. Revealing their plans to the British, the SIS, having read the report, which included the idea of tapping Soviet telephone lines, revealed the existence of Operation Silver in Vienna.

On the reassignment of CIA agent Bill Harvey to Berlin to explore available options, Reinhard Gehlen, the head of the &quot;Bundesnachrichtendienst&quot;, alerted the CIA to the location of a crucial telephone junction, less than 2 meters (6 ft. 7 in.) underground, where three cables came together close to the border of the American sector of West Berlin. Operation Gold was planned jointly by the SIS and the CIA. Initial planning meetings were held at No. 2 Carlton Gardens, London, from which the West German government was excluded due to the &quot;highly infiltrated nature&quot; of their service. The resulting agreement was that the US would supply most of the financing and construct the tunnel (as the closest access point was in their sector), while the British would use their expertise from Operation Silver to tap the cables and provide the required electronic communications equipment.

One of those who attended the early meetings was George Blake, a mole in the British intelligence apparatus. Blake apparently alerted the KGB immediately, as two of Gehlen&#x27;s agents were caught trying to get a potential tapping wire across a Berlin canal. The KGB decided to let Operation Gold proceed since, in order to attack the tunnel, the Soviets would have to compromise Blake, and they found it preferable to sacrifice some information rather than their valuable agent. According to the author of a 2019 book about the operation, the Soviets &quot;valued Blake so much that they feared his exposure more than a breach of their secrets.&quot;

The KGB did not inform anyone in Germany, including the East Germans or the Soviet users of the cables, about the taps. According to a CIA report, &quot;there were no known attempts to feed disinformation to the CIA.&quot; Although the British SIS suspected the opposite, the CIA report states that &quot;the Soviet military continued to use the cables for communications of intelligence value.&quot;

==Construction==
In December 1953, the operation was placed under the direction of William King Harvey, a former U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) official who transferred to the CIA. Captain Williamson of the United States Army Corps of Engineers was placed in charge of construction.

The first project was the construction of a &quot;warehouse&quot;, which acted as a disguise and had an US Army ELINT (radar) station avove it. The warehouse, in the Neukölln/Rudow district of the US sector of Berlin, had an unconventionally deep basement at to serve as the staging area for the tunnel and to house the spoil removed from the tunnel. Digging the initial vertical shaft for the tunnel began on September 2, 1954, and was completed on February 25, the following year.

The covert construction of the 450-meter (1,476 ft) tunnel under the world&#x27;s most heavily patrolled border to intersect a series of cables less than 47 centimeters (19 in.) below a busy street was an exceptional engineering challenge. Using the shield method of construction, which pushed forward on hydraulic rams, the resultant space was lined with sand and 1,700 cast-iron lining plates. A wooden railway track acted as a guide for the rubber-wheeled construction vehicles, which by the end of construction had removed 3,000 tons (3,000 long tons and 3,300 short tons) of material. This included a number of evacuations, including when the diggers broke through into an undocumented pre-World War II cesspool and flooded the tunnel. Throughout the construction and in operational use, the entire tunnel was rigged with explosives, designed to ensure its complete destruction (although the explosives were not used; US Army Major General Charles Dasher &quot;would not approve an action which could be the start of World War III&quot;. 

Once complete, the tunnel ran into the Altglienicke area of Treptow borough, where British Army Captain Peter Lunn—a former Olympic alpine skier and the head of the SIS in Berlin supervised construction of the vertical shaft and the tapping of the three cables.Tunnelling was difficult with the need to avoid subsidence in the soft crumbly soil. For the vertical shaft work an improvised device called the Mole was used by the British team from the Royal Engineers and the SIS plus staff from the BPO Research Station at Dollis Hill. The tapping into the three cables was carried out by specialist BPO cable jointing staff; Scotsman Blake Rymer &quot;the best jointer they had&quot; plus Les Sparks and Arthur Loomes. 

Originally costed at S50,000, the final cost of the completed tunnel was over US$6.5M (although many items were just &quot;written off&quot;), or equivalent to the final procurement cost of two Lockheed U-2 spy planes.

==Operation== 
The tunnel ran 1,476 feet (450 m) and was six feet (1.8 m) in diameter and operated for 11 months and 11 days according to a 2019 book by &quot;Washington Post&quot; journalist Steve Vogel, who reviewed all of the available documents and interviewed 40 of the project&#x27;s participants. &quot;Betrayal in Berlin: The True Story of the Cold War&#x27;s Most Audacious Espionage Operation&quot; includes a &quot;virtually month-by-month account of the tunnel&#x27;s excavation and operation&quot;, according to one review. As well, after that book was published, the CIA released a less redacted version of their documents about the tunnel.

Inside, the British and the Americans listened and recorded the messages flowing to and from Soviet military headquarters in Zossen, near Berlin: conversations between Moscow and the Soviet embassy in East Berlin and conversations between East German and Soviet officials.

The West was unable to break Soviet encryption at this time. Instead they took advantage of valuable intelligence gained &quot;from unguarded telephone conversations over official channels.&quot; &quot;Sixty-seven thousand hours of Russian and German conversations, were sent to London for transcription by a special section staffed by 317 Russian emigres and German linguists. Teleprinter signals, many of them multiplexed, were also collected on magnetic tape and forwarded to Frank Rowlett&#x27;s Staff D for processing.&quot;

To protect Blake, the KGB was forced to keep the flow of information as normal as possible with the result that the tunnel was a bonanza of intelligence collection for the US and Britain in a world that had yet to witness the U-2 or satellite imagery.

According to Stephen Budiansky, &quot;The KGB&#x27;s own high-level communications went on a separate system of overhead lines that could not be tapped without its being obvious, and, concerned above all with protecting Blake as a valuable source inside SIS and unwilling to share its secrets with rival agencies, the KGB had simply left both the GRU and the Stasi in the dark about the tunnel&#x27;s existence.&quot;

==Discovery by the Soviets==
When Blake received a transfer in 1955, the Soviets were free to &quot;discover&quot; the tunnel. On 21 April 1956, months after the tunnel went into operation, Soviet and East German soldiers broke into the eastern end of the tunnel. One source indicates that the wiretap had been in service for roughly 18 months. The Soviets announced the discovery to the press and called it a &quot;breach of the norms of international law&quot; and &quot;a gangster act&quot;. Newspapers around the world ran photographs of the underground partition of the tunnel directly under the inter-German frontier. The wall had a sign in German and Russian reading &quot;Entry is Forbidden by the Commanding General.&quot;

In the planning phase, the CIA and SIS had estimated that the Soviets would cover up any discovery of the tunnel, through embarrassment and any potential repercussions. However, most world media portrayed the tunnel project as a brilliant piece of engineering. The CIA may have gained more than the Soviets did from the &quot;discovery&quot; of the tunnel. In part, this was because the tunnel was discovered during Soviet First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s state visit to the United Kingdom, and specifically the day before a state banquet with HM Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle. It is suspected that the Soviets and the British agreed to mute media coverage of British participation in the project even though the equipment shown in most photographs was British-built and clearly labelled as such.

Only in 1961, when Blake was arrested, tried and convicted, did Western officials realize that the tunnel had been compromised long before construction had begun. Although DCI Allen Dulles has publicly celebrated the success of Operation Gold in providing order of battle and other information about Soviet and East Bloc activities behind the Iron Curtain, a declassified NSA history implied that NSA may have thought less of the value of the tunnel collection than did the CIA.

In 1996 the Berlin city government contracted a local construction company to excavate approximately 83 meters (270ft) from the former American Berlin sector of the tunnel to make way for a new housing development.
In 1997 a 12-meter (40ft) section was excavated under the guidance of William Durie from what had been the Soviet Berlin sector. This section of tunnel is displayed at the Allied Museum. The museum&#x27;s claim that this section was retrieved from the American sector is false.
The CIA museum received outer tunnel shell elements in 1999 and the International Spy Museum in Washington thereafter.

==In fiction==
Operation Gold forms the background to the novels &quot;The Innocent&quot; by Ian McEwan, &quot;Voices Under Berlin: The Tale of a Monterey Mary&quot; by T.H.E. Hill and to the film &quot;The Innocent&quot; by John Schlesinger.

<text>Olive Evangeline Diefenbaker ( Freeman; April 14, 1902 – December 22, 1976) was the second wife of John Diefenbaker, the 13th Prime Minister of Canada. Diefenbaker proposed to her in Paddockwood, Saskatchewan, while she was a school teacher, and they were married on December 8, 1953. They had no children together, but they raised a daughter from her previous marriage to Toronto solicitor Harry Palmer, who died less than three years after the birth of the child. On her husband&#x27;s death in 1979, her remains, buried in 1976 in Ottawa, were reburied in Saskatoon in 1979.

== Life ==
Olive was born to two Nova Scotian parents. Her father was a Baptist Minister from Canning, Nova Scotia. Due to her father&#x27;s occupation she grew up moving around the Canadian Prairies. Olive first met her second husband John Diefenbaker in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan at a church where her father was working. John had just gotten back from fighting in World War I and was studying law at this time.

She attended McMaster University and the Ontario College of Education and in 1933 she started her career as a high school teacher. She taught French at the Guelph Collegiate Vocational Institute in Ontario. She wore a steel back brace due to several slipped disks.

She met her first husband Harry Palmer during 1933. He was a Toronto Barrister and lawyer. He later died in 1936 after three years of marriage and one child. During her marriage to Harry, she stepped away from her profession but after his untimely death she started a new career as the director of child guidance for the Ontario Department of Education. Olive reunited with John Diefenbaker in 1951 and they married in 1953 in Toronto. Diefenbaker&#x27;s first wife, Edna Brower, had died in 1951. Olive Freeman was born in 1902 in Roland, Manitoba.

== Political influence ==
Olive Diefenbaker was a known supporter of the suffrage movement. During 1964 she spoke to a group of 600 people belonging to the Progressive Conservative Women&#x27;s Association about the power of the unification of women in politics. During a visit to the Fraser Valley, Olive addressed a group of her followers about her preference of flats over heels after following her husband&#x27;s two campaigns. She spoke French and considered her French grammar better than her English grammar, she would even address the French-speaking voters in French. She was a very talented conversationalist.

John considered Olive an asset to his campaign team because of her ability with the voters and remember names. She would write her husband notes during his speeches with advice on how to appeal to the voters, for instance, during 1963 while John was delivering a speech in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, Olive wrote him a note to mention the painting they had hung over their fireplace back at home which is a landscape of Cape Breton to help appeal to his audience.

Although she was very politically active, she was very humble about her participation and considered her and John to be a strong team. She was well known for her grace when hosting at 24 Sussex Drive.

== Interests ==
Olive had several hobbies including; sewing, leather work and metal work. She also would give items from her closet to local bazaars supporting women&#x27;s institutes. An example is her white fitted floral hat bought by Mrs Bell Hall, an Ontario Councillor.

==Legacy==
Olive Diefenbaker Drive in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan is named in her honour.
