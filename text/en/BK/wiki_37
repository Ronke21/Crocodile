<text>Donald James Stewart (17 October 1920 – 23 August 1992) was Scottish National Party (SNP) Member of Parliament (MP) from 1970 to 1987 for the Western Isles. He also served as President of the Scottish National Party (SNP) from 1982 to 1987. He was a councillor in Stornoway for many years and twice served as the town&#x27;s provost.

==Early life==
Stewart was born on 17 October 1920 in Stornoway, Western Isles, Scotland. He was educated at the Nicolson Institute. Stewart left school at 16 to work as a junior clerk in a local solicitor&#x27;s office, before going on to work in the office of Kenneth Mackenzie Ltd, a Stornoway Harris Tweed firm. He saw active service during the Second World War with the Royal Navy, serving on the corvette for the duration of the war. Following the war, he returned to Kenneth Mackenzie Ltd, eventually becoming a director. He remained with the firm until his election to Parliament in 1970.

==Political career==
A lifelong socialist, Stewart became convinced of the case for Scottish independence at the 1935 United Kingdom general election, and joined the Scottish National Party the following year. He also joined the Labour Party in 1937, but became disillusioned with the party and left it in 1939. He first elected to Stornoway Town Council in 1951, and remained a councillor until his election to Parliament in 1970. He stood in the 1952 Dundee East by-election. Stewart was the provost of Stornoway from 1959 to 1965, and again from 1968 to 1970. At the 1970 general election he was the SNP&#x27;s first ever MP returned at a general election, and the last declared result in 1970, which caused great attention in the media.

Stewart was the SNP&#x27;s sole Westminster representative from 1970 until he was joined by Margo MacDonald who won Glasgow Govan in the by-election of 1973. At the February 1974 General Election he was joined by six other SNP MPs, and at the October General Election of that year this number increased to eleven. Stewart became the SNP parliamentary group leader, with William Wolfe as the SNP leader overall. In 1977, Donald Stewart was appointed as a Privy Counsellor.

When Robin Cook MP moved an amendment to legalise homosexual acts to the Bill which became the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980, he stated &quot;The clause bears the names of hon. Members from all three major parties. I regret that the only party represented among Scottish Members of Parliament from which there has been no support for the clause is the Scottish National Party. I am pleased to see both representatives of that party in their place, and I hope to convert them in the remainder of my remarks.&quot; When the amendment came to a vote, Stewart and the SNP&#x27;s other MP Gordon Wilson both voted against the decriminalisation of homosexual acts.

In 1981 Stewart attempted to introduce some provisions for Gaelic through a private members bill, but it was met with hostility from the Conservatives and talked out by Bill Walker. It was only with the introduction of the Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act 2005 by the devolved Scottish Parliament, that the language was afforded some official recognition.

In March 1985 Stewart announced he would retire from front-line politics at the next election, although continued to represent the Western Isles until 1987. At the General Election of that year his replacement as SNP candidate Ian Smith, then the party&#x27;s spokesman on transport, was defeated by Calum MacDonald of the Labour Party. The SNP vote dropped by 26% and the constituency saw an SNP to Labour swing of 19.6% in what was included by election analysts David Butler and Robert Waller as among the &quot;exceptional results&quot; seen in &quot;individual constituencies&quot; in that election.
Labour held it until the 2005 general election when it was regained by the SNP&#x27;s Angus MacNeil.

Upon his retirement from Parliament, Stewart was offered a Life Peerage, but refused it. Stewart was working on an autobiography when he died in 1992. It was edited and completed by his sister, and published in 1994 as &quot;A Scot in Westminster&quot;.

It was Stewart who famously described the SNP as a &quot;radical party, with a revolutionary aim&quot;.

==Personal life==
He married Christina MacAulay.

In August 1992 he suffered a heart attack. He died a week later, aged 71, at Lewis hospital, Stornoway.

<text>Blackfriars Railway Bridge is a railway bridge crossing the River Thames in London, between Blackfriars Bridge and the Millennium Bridge.

==First bridge==
There have been two structures with the name. The first bridge was opened in 1864 and was designed by Joseph Cubitt for the London, Chatham and Dover Railway. Massive abutments at each end carried the railway&#x27;s insignia, preserved and restored on the south side. Following the formation of the Southern Railway in 1924, inter-city and continental services were concentrated on Waterloo, and St Paul&#x27;s Station became a local and suburban stop. For this reason, the use of the original bridge gradually declined. It eventually became too weak to support modern trains, and was therefore removed in 1985 – all that remains is a series of columns crossing the Thames and the southern abutment, which is a Grade II listed structure.

At the southern end of the bridge was Blackfriars Bridge railway station which opened in 1864 before closing to passengers in 1885 following the opening of what is today the main Blackfriars station. Blackfriars Bridge railway station continued as a goods stop until 1964 when it was mostly demolished, and much of it redeveloped into offices.

==Second bridge==
The second bridge, built slightly further downstream (to the east), was originally called St Paul&#x27;s Railway Bridge and opened in 1886 together with a new station in Queen Victoria Street called St Paul&#x27;s Station. The joint engineers for the works were William Mills, of the London, Chatham, and Dover Company, and John Wolfe Barry and Henry Marc Brunel. The resident engineer in charge of the construction was Edward Cruttwell. The bridge is made of wrought iron. It was built by Lucas and Aird.

The need for the second bridge was the lack of capacity and overcrowding at the first station which had become &quot;in the highest degree dangerous&quot;. The directors of the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway determined that they needed to double the lines across the Thames.

The original design was for four rail lines but once work was underway it was decided to expand the bridge to carry seven lines of railway which required extensions to the four piers. The bridge had a clear width of 81 ft between the parapets, increasing to 123 ft at the northernmost span to provide space for the platforms. The bridge had five spans, the shore span on the Surrey side being 183 ft, the centre span and Middlesex shore span 185 ft each, and the second and fourth spans 175 ft each. The lengths of the three middle spans corresponded with those of the old bridge alongside for ease of navigation.

When St Paul&#x27;s railway station changed its name to Blackfriars in 1937 the name of the bridge was changed as well to Blackfriars Railway Bridge.

As part of the Thameslink Programme, the platforms at Blackfriars station were extended across the Thames and partially supported by the 1864 bridge piers. The project was designed by Will Alsop and built by Balfour Beatty. The work also included the installation of a roof covered with photovoltaic solar panels. It is the largest of only three solar bridges in the world (the others being Kennedy Bridge in Bonn, Germany, and Kurilpa Bridge in Australia). Other green improvements included sun pipes and systems to collect rain water.

<doc id="380904" wikidata="Q917361" url="?curid=380904" title="Daiquiri">
<text>The daiquiri (; ) is a cocktail whose main ingredients are rum, citrus juice (typically lime juice), and sugar or other sweetener.

The daiquiri is one of the six basic drinks listed in David A. Embury&#x27;s classic &quot;The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks&quot;, which also lists some variations.

== Origins ==
&quot;Daiquirí&quot; is also the name of a beach and an iron mine near Santiago de Cuba in eastern Cuba, and is a word of Taíno origin. The drink was supposedly invented by an American mining engineer named Jennings Cox, who was in Cuba (then at the tail-end of the Spanish Captaincy-General government) at the time of the Spanish–American War of 1898. It is also possible that William A. Chanler, a US congressman who purchased the Santiago iron mines in 1902, introduced the daiquiri to clubs in New York in that year.

Originally the drink was served in a tall glass packed with cracked ice. A teaspoon of sugar was poured over the ice, and the juice of one or two limes was squeezed over the sugar. Two or three ounces of white rum completed the mixture. The glass was then frosted with a long-handled spoon. Later the daiquiri evolved to be mixed in a shaker with the same ingredients but with shaved ice. After a thorough shaking, it was poured into a chilled coupe glass.

The basic recipe for a daiquiri is also similar to the grog British sailors drank aboard ships from the 1780s as a means of preventing scurvy. By 1795 the Royal Navy daily grog ration contained rum, water, ¾ ounce of lemon or lime juice, and 2 ounces of sugar. This was a common drink across the Caribbean, and as soon as ice became available this was included instead of the water.

Consumption of the drink remained localized until 1909, when Rear Admiral Lucius W. Johnson, a U.S. Navy medical officer, tried Cox&#x27;s drink. Johnson subsequently introduced it to the Army and Navy Club in Washington, D.C., and drinkers of the daiquiri increased over the space of a few decades. It was one of the favorite drinks of the writer Ernest Hemingway and U.S. President John F. Kennedy.

The drink became popular in the 1940s. World War II rationing made whiskey and vodka hard to come by, yet rum was easily obtainable owing to U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s Good Neighbor policy, which opened up trade and travel relations with Latin America, Cuba, and the Caribbean. The Good Neighbor policy, also known as the Pan-American program, helped make Latin America fashionable. Consequently, rum-based drinks (once frowned upon as the choice of sailors and down-and-outs) also became fashionable, and the daiquiri saw tremendous popularity in the US.

== Variations ==

* Hemingway daiquiri (Hemingway special) – or – two and a half jiggers of white rum, juice of two limes and half a grapefruit, six drops of maraschino liqueur, without sugar.
* Mulata daiquiri: rum mixed with either coffee or chocolate liqueur and with fresh lime juice and sugar syrup
* Old Rose daiquiri: strawberry syrup and rum along with two teaspoons of sugar and lime juice
* Royal Bermuda Yacht Club: Barbados rum, fresh lime juice, Cointreau, and falernum, recorded since 1941.

== Frozen daiquiri ==
A wide variety of alcoholic mixed drinks made with finely pulverized ice are often called frozen daiquirí. These drinks can also be combined and poured from a blender, eliminating the need for manual pulverisation and producing a texture similar to a smoothie. On larger scales, such drinks are often commercially made in larger machines and come in various flavors with various alcohol or liquors. Another way to create a frozen daiquiri (mostly fruit-flavored variants) is by using frozen limeade, providing the required texture, sweetness and sourness all at once.

=== Variations === 
* Banana daiquiri – regular daiquiri with half a banana.
* Strawberry daiquiri – a blender drink of puréed whole strawberries, rum, cane sugar and lime juice

<text>The Treaty of Riga was signed in Riga, Latvia, on between Poland on one side and Soviet Russia (acting also on behalf of Soviet Belarus) and Soviet Ukraine on the other, ending the Polish–Soviet War (1919–1921). The chief negotiators of the peace were Jan Dąbski for the Polish side and Adolph Joffe for the Soviet side.

Under the treaty, Poland recognized Soviet Ukraine and Belarus, abrogating its 1920 Treaty of Warsaw with the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic. The Treaty of Riga established a Polish–Soviet border about east of the Curzon Line, incorporating large numbers of Ukrainians and Belarusians into the Second Polish Republic. Poland, which agreed to withdraw from areas further east (notably Minsk), renounced claims to the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth&#x27;s border prior to the 1772 First Partition of Poland, recovering only those eastern regions (Kresy) lost to Russia in the 1795 Third Partition. Russia and Ukraine agreed to withdraw their claims to lands west of the demarcated border line. Poland, by recognising the puppet states of the USSR and simultaneously withdrawing recognition of the UPR (its only ally in the Polish-Bolshevik war), was in fact giving up on the federation programme, while Russia approved of the fact that the whole of Galicia, as well as the territories of the former Russian Empire, inhabited largely by non-Polish people, were to be found within Poland&#x27;s borders. The treaty also addressed matters of sovereignty, citizenship, national minorities, repatriation, and diplomatic and commercial relations. The Treaty lasted until the invasion of Poland by the Soviet Union in 1939, and their borders were redefined by an agreement in 1945.

== Background ==

World War I removed former state borders across Europe. Following the Russian Revolution which had renounced Tsarist claims to Poland, as well as the Central Powers provisions for Congress Poland in the March 1918 Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, The Great War had ended with the collapse of the Central Powers. The Treaty of Versailles had re-established Poland&#x27;s independence after a century and a half of being divided by three empires.

The Russian Civil War presented an opportunity for Poland, under the leadership of Józef Piłsudski, to regain parts of the territories of the former Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth that had been incorporated into the Russian Empire during the Partitions of Poland–Lithuania. In 1920, Piłsudski&#x27;s initially successful military offensive into Ukraine, whose aim was to establish an independent Ukraine in alliance with Poland, was met with a Soviet counter-offensive into central Poland. Poland was seen by the Soviets, who intended to extend the revolution westwards, as a land bridge to Western Europe. The Polish–Soviet War culminated in the Battle of Warsaw, won by the Poles. Further military setbacks persuaded Soviet Russia to enter into peace treaty negotiations. This was a relief for the government of Poland, a country heavily damaged and exhausted by the war, who also wanted to conclude peace talks. Piłsudski and his supporters, however, having failed in their quest, opposed the peace process.

== Negotiations ==

Peace talks began in Minsk on 17 August 1920, but the talks were moved to Riga, and resumed on . The Soviets proposed two solutions, the first on 21 September and the second on . The Polish delegation made a counter-offer on 2 October. Three days later the Soviets offered amendments to the Polish offer, which Poland accepted. An armistice was signed on 12 October and went into effect on 18 October 1920. The chief negotiators were Jan Dąbski for Poland and Adolph Joffe for the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. The Soviet side insisted, successfully, on excluding non-communist Ukrainian representatives from the negotiations.

The Soviets&#x27; military setbacks made their delegation offer Poland substantial territorial concessions in the contested border areas. However, to many observers, it looked as though the Polish side conducted the Riga talks as if Poland had lost the war. The Polish delegation was dominated by members of the National Democrats, who were Piłsudski&#x27;s political opponents. The National Democrats did not want non-Polish minorities in the reborn Polish state to constitute more than one-third of the overall population, therefore, prepared to accept a Polish-Soviet border substantially to the west of what was being offered by the Soviets even though it would leave hundreds of thousands of ethnic Poles on the Soviet side of the border.

That decision was also motivated by political objectives. The National Democrats&#x27; base of public support was among Poles in central and western Poland. In the east of the country and in the disputed borderlands, support for the National Democrats was greatly outweighed by support for Piłsudski, and in the countryside, outside the cities, Poles were outnumbered by Ukrainians or Belarusians in those areas. A border too far to the east would thus be against not only the National Democrats&#x27; ideological objective of minimising the minority population of Poland but also their electoral prospects. Warweary public opinion in Poland also favoured an end to the negotiations, and both sides remained under pressure from the League of Nations to reach a deal.

A special parliamentary delegation, consisting of six members of the Polish Sejm, held a vote on whether to accept the Soviets&#x27; far-reaching concessions, which would have left Minsk on the Polish side of the border. Pressured by the National Democrat ideologue, Stanisław Grabski, the 100 km of extra territory was rejected, a victory for the nationalist doctrine and a stark defeat for Piłsudski&#x27;s federalism.

Regardless, the peace negotiations dragged on for months because of Soviet reluctance to sign. However, the matter became more urgent for the Soviet leadership, which had to deal with increased internal unrest towards the end of 1920, such as the Tambov Rebellion and later the Kronstadt rebellion against the Soviet authorities. As a result, Vladimir Lenin ordered the Soviet plenipotentiaries to finalise the peace treaty with Poland.

The Treaty of Riga, signed on 18 March 1921, partitioned the disputed territories in Belarus and Ukraine between Poland and Russia and ended the conflict.

==Terms==
The Treaty consisted of 26 articles. Poland was to receive monetary compensation (30 million rubles in gold) for its economic input into the Russian Empire during the Partitions of Poland. Under Article 14 Poland was also to receive railway materials (locomotives, rolling stock, etc.) with a value of 29 million gold roubles. Russia was to surrender works of art and other Polish national treasures acquired from Polish territories after 1772 (such as the Jagiellonian tapestries and the Załuski Library). Both sides renounced claims to war compensation. Article 3 stipulated that border issues between Poland and Lithuania would be settled by those states.
Article 6 created citizenship options for persons on either side of the new border. Article 7 consisted of a mutual guarantee that all nationalities would be permitted &quot;free intellectual development, the use of their national language, and the exercise of their religion.&quot; In the treaty, it was agreed that Poland would refuse to form federations with Lithuania, Belarus and Ukraine.

==Aftermath==
The Allied Powers were initially reluctant to recognise the treaty, which had been concluded without their participation. Their postwar conferences had supported the Curzon Line as the Polish-Russian border, and Poland&#x27;s territorial gains in the treaty lay about 250 km east of that line. French support led to its recognition in March 1923 by France, the United Kingdom, Italy and Japan, followed by the United States in April.

In Poland, the Treaty of Riga was met with criticism from the very beginning. Some characterised the treaty as short-sighted and argued that much of what Poland had gained during the Polish-Soviet war was lost during the peace negotiations. Józef Piłsudski had participated in the Riga negotiations only as an observer and called the resulting treaty &quot;an act of cowardice&quot;. Piłsudski felt the agreement was a shameless and short-sighted political calculation, with Poland abandoning its Ukrainian allies. On 15 May 1921, he apologised to Ukrainian soldiers during his visit to the internment camp at Kalisz. The treaty substantially contributed to the failure of his plan to create a Polish-led Intermarium federation of Eastern Europe, as portions of the territory that had been proposed for the federation were ceded to the Soviets.

Lenin also considered the treaty unsatisfactory, as it forced him to put aside his plans for exporting the Soviet revolution to the West.

The Belarusian and Ukrainian independence movements saw the treaty as a setback. Four million Ukrainians and over a million Belarusians lived within areas ceded to Poland. In one estimate, only 15% of the population was ethnically Polish. The Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic, led by Symon Petliura, had been allied with Poland under the Treaty of Warsaw, which was abrogated by the Treaty of Riga. The new treaty violated Poland&#x27;s military alliance with the UPR, which had explicitly prohibited a separate peace. Doing so worsened relations between Poland and the Ukrainians who had supported Petliura. The supporters felt that Ukraine had been betrayed by its Polish ally, which would be exploited by the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists and contribute to the growing tensions and eventual anti-Polish massacres in the 1930s and the 1940s. By the end of 1921, most Poland-allied Ukrainian, Belarusian and White Russian forces had been annihilated by Soviet forces or had crossed the border into Poland and laid down their arms.

According to the Belarusian historian Andrew Savchenko, Poland&#x27;s new eastern border was &quot;military indefensible and economically unviable&quot; and a source of growing ethnic tensions, as the resulting minorities in Poland were too large to be ignored or assimilated and too small to win their desired autonomy.

==Further consequences==
While the Treaty of Riga led to a two-decade stabilisation of Soviet-Polish relations, conflict was renewed with the Soviet invasion of Poland during World War II. The treaty was subsequently overridden after a decision by war&#x27;s Allied powers to change Poland&#x27;s borders once again and transfer the populations.

In the view of some foreign observers, the treaty&#x27;s incorporation of significant minority populations into Poland led to seemingly insurmountable challenges, because the newly formed organizations such as OUN engaged in terror and sabotage actions across ethnically mixed areas to inflame conflict in the region. Nevertheless, many groups representing national minorities welcomed Piłsudski&#x27;s return to power in 1926 providing opportunities to play a role in the Polish government.

The populations separated from Poland by the new Polish-Soviet border experienced a different fate from their fellow citizens. Ethnic Poles left within Soviet borders were subjected to discrimination and property confiscation. At least 111,000 were summarily executed in the NKVD operation in 1937/38, preceding other ethnic repression campaigns perpetrated during World War II, while others were exiled to different regions of the Soviet Union.

Belarusians and Ukrainians, having failed to create their own states, were subjects of repression in the Soviet Union, and even liquidation e.g. Executed Renaissance or persecuted kobzars and bandurists. Belarusians and Ukrainians living on the Polish side of the border were subjected to Polonization; which contributed to the rise of Ukrainian nationalist organisations and the adoption of terrorist tactics by Ukrainian extremists.

The Soviet Union, although thwarted in 1921, would see its sphere of influence expand as a result of World War II. After the Soviet Union established its control over the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland, the Polish-Soviet border was moved westwards in 1945 to roughly coincide with the Curzon Line. This shift was accompanied by large population transfers which led to the expulsion of the Poles living east of the new border, and also moved most of the Ukrainian minority remaining in Poland to the former German territories that were ceded to Poland in compensation. The unified Belarusian and Ukrainian territories were fully incorporated into the USSR.

However, in 1989, Poland would regain its full sovereignty, and soon afterwards, with the fall of the Soviet Union, Belarus and Ukraine would go on to become independent nations.

<text>The four-toothed whales or giant beaked whales are beaked whales in the genus Berardius. They include Arnoux&#x27;s beaked whale (&quot;Berardius arnuxii&quot;) in cold Southern Hemispheric waters, and Baird&#x27;s beaked whale (&quot;Berardius bairdii&quot;) in the cold temperate waters of the North Pacific. A third species, Sato&#x27;s beaked whale (&quot;Berardius minimus&quot;), was distinguished from &quot;B. bairdii&quot; in the 2010s.

Arnoux&#x27;s and Baird&#x27;s beaked whales are so similar that researchers have debated whether or not they are simply two populations of the same species. However, genetic evidence and their wide geographical separation has led them to be classified as separate. Lifespan estimates, based on earwax plug samples, indicate male whales can live up to 85 years, while females can have a lifespan of 54 years. It is estimated that the length at birth is ~. Growing up to ~, these are the largest whales belonging to the family Ziphiidae. Sato&#x27;s beaked whale is much smaller, with adult males having a length of ~.

While &quot;Berardius arnuxii&quot; and &quot;Berardius bairdii&quot; are considered least concern by the IUCN, &quot;Berardius minimus&quot; is labeled as near threatened .

This article currently largely treats four-toothed whales as monospecific, due to a lack of species-specific information.

==Species overview==
&quot;Berardius&quot; was once classified as containing only two species: Arnoux&#x27;s beaked whale (&quot;Berardius arnuxii&quot;) in the Southern Hemisphere waters, and Baird&#x27;s beaked whale (&quot;Berardius bairdii&quot;) in the North Pacific. Arnoux&#x27;s beaked whale was described by Georges Louis Duvernoy in 1851. The genus name honors admiral Auguste Bérard (1796–1852), who was captain of the French corvette &quot;Le Rhin&quot; (1842–1846), which brought back the type specimen to France where Duvernoy analyzed it; the species name honors Maurice Arnoux, the ship&#x27;s surgeon who found the skull of the type specimen on a beach near Akaroa, New Zealand. Baird&#x27;s beaked whale was first described by Leonhard Hess Stejneger in 1883 from a four-toothed skull he had found on Bering Island the previous year. The species is named for Spencer Fullerton Baird, a past Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

Researchers have debated over whether the northern and southern populations represent distinct species or whether they are simply geographic variants. Several morphological characters have been suggested to distinguish them, but the validity of each has been disputed; currently, it seems that there are no significant skeletal or external differences between the two forms, except for the smaller size of the southern specimens known to date. The morphological similarity gave rise to the hypothesis that the populations were sympatric as recently as the last Pleistocene Ice Age, approximately 15,000 years ago, but subsequent genetic analyses suggest otherwise. Phylogenetic analyses of the mitochondrial DNA control region (D-loop) revealed that Baird&#x27;s and Arnoux&#x27;s beaked whales were reciprocally monophyletic — lineages from each of the species grouped together to the exclusion of lineages from the other species. Diagnostic DNA substitutions were also found. These results are consistent with the current classification of Baird&#x27;s and Arnoux&#x27;s beaked whales as distinct species. Further, the degree of differentiation between the northern and southern forms of &quot;Berardius&quot; suggest that the species may already have been separated for several million years.

It is speculated that the Baird&#x27;s and Arnoux&#x27;s whales separated from one another after their common ancestor separated from the kurotsuchi; however, this is not certain. The &quot;Berardius&quot; sp. are deep divers that can spend long periods of time submerged below the surface of the water and thus are difficult to study. 

===Possible species===
Sightings during whale watching tours and studies of stranded individuals suggest the possibility of another form of &quot;Berardius&quot; in the Sea of Okhotsk inclusive of the coast of northern Hokkaido especially around Shiretoko Peninsula and off Abashiri, or to Sea of Japan off Korean Peninsula and north pacific and Bering Sea off Alaska. These whales are generally much smaller than known species (), darker in color, and inhabit shallow waters closer to coastal areas, enough to be trapped within fixed nets for salmon. Local whalers had called them &quot;kurotsuchi&quot; (= black &quot;Berardius&quot;) or &quot;karasu&quot; (= ravens); it is not known whether these terms are synonyms or identify two separate species. Genetic studies indicate that kurotsuchi are &quot;Berardius minimus&quot;, recognized as a distinct species in the 2010s.

&quot;Bottlenose whales in the Sea of Okhotsk&quot; had been reported since the time of the Soviet Union&#x27;s whaling, and an unknown type of beaked whale resembling Baird&#x27;s beaked whales having four tusks on upper and lower jaws has also been recorded by traditional whalers in Japan. It is unknown whether these records correspond with this new form.

An unknown type of large beaked whale of similar size to fully grown &quot;Berardius bairdii&quot; have been reported to live in the Sea of Okhotsk, somewhat resembling Longman&#x27;s beaked whale. The &quot;Moore&#x27;s Beach monster&quot;, an initially unidentified carcass found in 1925 on Moore&#x27;s Beach on Monterey Bay, was identified by the California Academy of Sciences as a Baird&#x27;s beaked whale. There have been claims that records of strandings of these whales exist along the areas within and adjacent to Tatar Strait in the 2010s.

==Physical description==

The two established species, Baird&#x27;s and Arnoux&#x27;s beaked whales, have very similar features and would be indistinguishable at sea if they did not exist in disjoint locations. Both whales reach similar sizes, have bulbous melons, and long prominent beaks. Their lower jaw is longer than the upper, and once sexual maturity is reached the front teeth are visible even when the mouth is fully closed. The Baird&#x27;s and Arnoux&#x27;s beaked whales are the only whales in the Ziphiidae family where both sexes have erupted teeth. The teeth in the Ziphiidae are presumed to be used by the males for fighting and competition for females. Ziphiidae has the most prevalent and pronounced markings caused by teeth scaring among the cetaceans. Front-facing teeth may be covered in barnacles after many years. 

Baird&#x27;s and Arnoux&#x27;s beaked whales have similarly shaped small flippers with rounded tips, and small dorsal fins that sit far back on their body. Adult males and females of both species pick up numerous white linear scars all over the body as they age, and these may be a rough indicator of age. These traits are similar in both sexes, as there is little sexual dimorphism in either species. Among the observed differences in the sexes is their size: female Baird&#x27;s and Arnoux giant beaked whales are slightly larger than the males.

Although fairly similar, there exist some differences between the species. Baird&#x27;s beaked whales are around when born, and can reach lengths of as adults, making them the largest members of the beaked whale family. Members of the Baird&#x27;s species have fairly narrow body shapes despite their large size, and have dorsal fins that are rounded at the tips. Their coloration is fairly uniform and can range from brown to grey. Arnoux&#x27;s beaked whales are around long as calves and can reach lengths up to as adults. Their bodies are not as narrow as the Baird&#x27;s, and resemble a spindle. Unlike the Baird&#x27;s beaked whale, Arnoux&#x27;s have slightly hooked dorsal fins. Arnoux&#x27;s beaked whales have a dark coloration that ranges from brown to orange due to a buildup of algae on its body.

A third species, &quot;B. minimus&quot;, (known by the Japanese common name &quot;kurotsuchi&quot;, which means &quot;black &quot;Berardius&quot;&quot;) was formally named in 2019, after being distinguished in 2016, based on differences in haplotypes from mtDNA. It generally has a short beak (~4% body length). While other four-toothed whales are generally grey with scars, kurotsuchis usually have few linear scars, so that the dark, smooth skin contrasts highly with round, white scars of about 5 cm diameter (from cookiecutter shark bites). The tip of the rostrum is also white. The kurotsuchi is shorter than other four-toothed whales, around long at maturity, hence the species name, &quot;B. minimus&quot; (=&quot;smallest&quot;). No females of this species have yet been described in the research literature.

==Population and distribution==
The total population is not known for two of the three species. Estimates for Baird&#x27;s are of the order of 30,000 individuals. Nothing is known at all about the population size of the third species of &quot;Berardius&quot;, first scientifically described in the 2010s. Baird&#x27;s and Arnoux&#x27;s beaked whales have an allopatric (non-overlapping) antitropical distribution; kurotsuchis are known to live in the North Pacific.

===Arnoux&#x27;s===
Arnoux&#x27;s beaked whales inhabit great tracts of the Southern Ocean. Large groups of animals, pods of up to 47 individuals, have been observed off Kemp Land, Antarctica. Beachings in New Zealand and Argentina indicate the whale may be relatively common in the Southern Ocean between those countries and Antarctica; sporadic sightings have been recorded in polar waters, such as in McMurdo Sound. It has also been spotted close to South Georgia and South Africa, indicating a likely circumpolar distribution. The northernmost stranding was at 34 degrees south, indicating the whales inhabit cool and temperate, as well as polar, waters. There is no stock report for the Arnoux&#x27;s beaked whale to date by NOAA.

===Baird&#x27;s===
Baird&#x27;s beaked whale is found in the North Pacific Ocean, the Sea of Japan and the southern part of the Sea of Okhotsk. They appear to prefer seas over steep cliffs at the edge of the continental shelf, but are known to migrate to oceanic islands and to near shore waters where deep cliffs locate next to landmasses such as at Rishiri Island and in Tsugaru Strait, Shiretoko Peninsula, Tokyo Bay, and Toyama Bay.

The continental shelf was reported in the Alaska stock report as the whales migrate to the shelf in the summer months during when the water temperature are at the highest. According to the California/Oregon/Washington NOAA stock assessment report the Baird&#x27;s beaked whales can be found in the deep waters along the continental slopes of the North Pacific Ocean. They are often seen along the slope between late spring to early fall.

Specimens have been recorded as far north as the Bering Sea and as far south as the Baja California Peninsula. They are also found on the east side and the southern islands (Izu and Bonin Islands) of Japan on the west although it is unclear whether records at these islands are of &quot;Berardius bairdii&quot;. Southern limits of historical occurrences in east Asian were unclear, while there had been either a stranding or a catch in East China Sea at Zhoushan Islands in the 1950s, and was a disentanglement at Kamae, Ōita. Whales off the east coast of North America seems to approach coasts less frequently than in the western North Pacific, but they may travel further south than in Japan. Historical distributions of southward migrations or vagrants in Asian waters are unknown as the whales wintering from Bōsō Peninsula and in Tokyo Bay to Sagami Bay and around Izu Ōshima have been severely depleted or nearly wiped out by modern whaling (recently whalers shifted their major hunting grounds from Bōsō Peninsula to further north due to the very small numbers of whales still migrating to the former habitats). Within the Sea of Japan, the first scientific approaches to the species were made in Peter the Great Gulf, and the whales can widely distribute more on Japanese archipelago from west of Rebun Island to west of Oki Islands on unknown regularities, and major whaling grounds were in Toyama Bay and Oshima Peninsula.

Baird&#x27;s beaked whales are not found in southern Chinese waters because they prefer cooler waters, but may be seasonal in colder northern waters. Capture records by Japanese whalers suggest that there may have been historical migrant groups of Baird&#x27;s beaked whales that once regularly reached the Yellow and Bohai Seas, especially around the island of Lingshan off Jiaozhou Bay and off Dalian, This may have included regions at least as far south as the Zhoushan archipelago. 12 individuals were caught as by-catch along the east coasts of the Korean Peninsula between 1996 and 2012. Canada; Japan; Korea, Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea; Mexico; Russian; United States, (Taylor et al. 2008). Endemic to the North Pacific Ocean and the adjacent seas. There are two different stocks of Baird beaked whales that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) keeps track of for management of the species, the Alaska stock and the California-Oregon-Washington stock. (NOAA website). According to the Alaska 2017 stock report, the range of the Baird&#x27;s beaked whale is north of the Cape Navarn (62o N) and Central Sea of Okhotsk (57o N) that spans to St. Matthew Island, the Pribilof Islands, and the northern Gulf of Alaska. (Alaska Stock assessment report and Balcomb 1989).

The seasonal distribution can be observed when the Baird&#x27;s beaked whales spend the summer months in the Sea of Okhotsk and the Bering Sea between April–May to October. (Tomilin 1957, Kasuya 2002, Alaska Stock assessment report 2017). The wintering habitats is assumed to be located in the northern Gulf of Alaska which was determined by using acoustic detection, (Baumann-Pickering et al. 2012b. and Alaska Stock assessment report 2017.)

===Sato&#x27;s===
&quot;B. minimus&quot; is currently known to reside in only the central and western North Pacific Ocean. The species&#x27; range includes portions of Japan, Russia, and Alaska, between 40°N and 60°N and 140°E and 160°W. However, this distribution is based primarily on data collected from stranded specimens, and its range may extend further.

==Behavior==

Little is known about the behavior of Arnoux&#x27;s beaked whale, but it is expected to be similar to that of Baird&#x27;s. Distinctions between the two species are so slight that they are speculated to be the same, although genetic makeup and geographic distribution offer evidence otherwise. Baird&#x27;s beaked whales generally move in pods of 5 to 20 individuals, with groups of 50 observed in rarer circumstances. Congregating groups of Baird&#x27;s whales are led by a single large male. Scarring among males indicate competition for this leadership position that must entail more breeding opportunities and gives evidence that the species&#x27; behaviors portray sexual selection. Potentially one of the deepest diving cetaceans, they can dive for an hour at a time, predating on deep-water and bottom-dwelling fish, cephalopods, and crustaceans. When not diving, they drift along the surface. The deep diving whales can dive to depths of , and when feeding, they generally prefer deep waters near the continental shelf or around seamounts, where high biological activity is present in shallower waters. The deepest recorded dive is .

Diel variation in behavior suggests that beaked whales spend less time at the surface during the day than they do at night, so as to avoid surface predators like sharks and killer whales.
Considering the extent of whaling on the Baird&#x27;s species, the pod&#x27;s uninfluenced structure is not well known. To date, two-thirds of the whales caught have been male, despite the fact that females are somewhat larger than males and would be thought to be the preferred targets for whalers. They are listed as least concern under the IUCN Red List and not listed as depleted under the MMPA. They are not being hunted for research due to Japan pulling out of the whaling commission in 2018/2019.

Observations of Arnoux&#x27;s beaked whales in Doubtful Sound, New Zealand in the same seasons in 2009 and in 2010 indicate that this species may possess a form of bond to locations similar to those of other species such as right whales. Another 4 or 5 sightings have been recorded in the Doubtful Sound between 2007 and in 2011. Underwater recordings, made in the austral summer in the Antarctic of a large group of 47 Arnoux&#x27;s beaked whales showed that they were highly vociferous animals at this time. The whales produced clicks, click trains, and frequency modulated pulses and whistles which gives their vocalizations a characteristic warbling aural impression. The group swam in coordinated positions along the ice edge, some of them splitting and reassembling.

== Reproduction ==
Mating in Baird&#x27;s beaked whales happens in the months of October and November and calving occurs in March and April after a 17-month gestational period. Scarring among males indicate competition for leadership position that must entail more breeding opportunities and gives evidence that the species&#x27; behaviors portray sexual selection. The sex ratio seems to be skewed in favor of males from observational data; with some observations indicating as high is 3:1. Males are recorded to live longer. Males live 39 years longer than females with the adult sex ratio strongly biases toward males and the female&#x27;s exhibit high annual ovulation. It is possible that these results are seasonal abundances of different sexes in the region studied. They exhibit a slight reverse sexual dimorphism with females tending to be larger than males in size. The females have no post-reproductive stage. Cetaceans in general have an interbirth interval which is the time between births of new calves. The mysticetes tend to have two or three years or relative to body size intervals whereas the odontocete interbirth intervals are more varied. Baird beaked whales have interbirth intervals similar to mysticeti to their size than they do with other odontocetes. In July 2006, in the Sea of Cortez, Mexico, there was summer stranding event of 10 males of mixed age composition that was highly suggestive of male alloparental care. Females are slightly larger than the males and exhibit high annual ovulation and pregnancy rates. Males live about 30 years longer than the females with this sex ratio biased toward males it is speculated that the males provide alloparetnel care to offspring which in turn allows the females to have a shorten birth interval frequency.

== Feeding ==
Baird&#x27;s beaked whale has a diet that consists primarily of deep sea fish and cephalopods found at its preferred dive depths (1000–1777m). On rare occasions, it has been known to eat octopus, lobster, crab, rockfish, herring, starfish, pyrosomes and sea cucumbers. Baird&#x27;s beaked whales in the southern Sea of Okhotsk diet consists of deep-water gadiform fishes and cephalopods. The species has a mean dive time of about 1 hour, which suggests a long search and handling time. Its generalist feeding strategy may be reflective of limited prey availability at such depths or regions, as mammals become more general feeding strategists as prey diversity decreases. It may also explain the species&#x27; migrational patterns around the North Pacific. In summer months, Baird&#x27;s beaked whale can be found off the Pacific coast of Japan where demersal fish are abundant. Stomach content analysis&#x27;s found that Baird&#x27;s beaked whale feeds in benthic zones both day and night. This behavior differs from its other Odontocete relatives (namely the common dolphin and Dall&#x27;s porpoise) who feed in mesopelagic regions during the day when the light can penetrate the water column. This suggests that Baird&#x27;s beaked whale does not rely as much on its sense of sight and has evolved to navigate and hunt competently with echolocation. There is little information on the foraging behavior of Baird&#x27;s beaked whales and their ecological role in the marine ecosystem.

==Conservation==
Arnoux&#x27;s beaked whale has rarely been exploited, and although no abundance estimates are available, the population is not believed to be endangered.
Arnoux&#x27;s beaked whale is covered by the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (Pacific Cetaceans MOU).

Baird&#x27;s beaked whale is listed by the Mammalogical Society of Japan as rare in Japanese coastal waters. The Baird&#x27;s beaked whale is listed on Appendix II of the convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). It is listed on Appendix II as it has an unfavorable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international co-operation organised by tailored agreements. It is considered Least Concern by the IUCN. They are not listed as &quot;threatened&quot; or &quot;endangered&quot; under the endangered species act nor depleted under the MMPA. There is preliminary evidence of the Baird&#x27;s beaked whale being sensitive to anthropogenic aquatic noise pollution, as other odontocete species are. Anthropogenic sound sources such as military sonar and seismic testing. The testing of military sonar has been recorded to effect the diving behavior of beaked whales. This implication on the whales effects their ability to decompress upon surfacing and results in the whales suffering the bends, increase nitrogen gas bubbles in the blood.

In the 20th century, Baird&#x27;s beaked whales were hunted primarily by Japan and to a lesser extent by the USSR, Canada and the United States. The USSR reported killing 176 before hunting ended in 1974. Canadian and American whalers killed 60 before halting in 1966. Japan killed around 4000 individuals before the 1986 moratorium on whaling (about 300 were killed in the most prolific year, 1952). Baird&#x27;s beaked whales are not protected under the International Whaling Commission&#x27;s moratorium on commercial whaling, as Japan argues they are a &#x27;small cetacean&#x27; species, despite being larger than minke whales, which are protected. Each year, 62 Baird&#x27;s beaked whales are hunted commercially in Japan, with the meat sold for human consumption. A landing and processing of a Baird&#x27;s beaked whale was filmed by the Environmental Investigation Agency on 7 August 2009. Meat and blubber food products of the whales have been found to contain high levels of mercury and other pollutants, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).

===Population status===

Estimates of the abundance of populations are unavailable. They are not listed as &quot;threatened&quot; or &quot;endangered&quot; under the endangered species act nor depleted under the MMPA.

===Threats===

The Baird&#x27;s beaked whale is hunted by Japan. As of 2019, Japan pulled out of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) to continue harvesting whales commercially. The California large mesh drift gillnet fishery has known to interact with the CA-OR-WA population. There are habitat concerns for the Alaska stock, in areas with oil and gas activities or shipping and military activities are high. For the Baird&#x27;s beaked whale. Anthropogenic sound sources such as military sonar and seismic testing. The testing of military sonar has been recorded to effect the diving behavior of beaked whales. This implication on the whales effects their ability to decompress upon surfacing and results in the whales suffering the bends, increase nitrogen gas bubbles in the blood.

<doc id="380914" wikidata="Q629227" url="?curid=380914" title="Arnoux's beaked whale">
<text>Arnoux&#x27;s beaked whale (Berardius arnuxii), also called the southern four-toothed whale, southern beaked whale, New Zealand beaked whale, southern giant bottlenose whale and southern porpoise whale is one of the species of &quot;Berardius&quot;. Arnoux&#x27;s and Baird&#x27;s beaked whales are so similar that researchers debated whether or not they are simply two populations of the same species, until genetic evidence and their wide geographical separation led them to be classified as separate. Little is known about their behavior due to infrequent encounters with live individuals.
==Etymology== 
Named Berardius arnuxii in 1851 for the French surgeon, M. Arnoux, who presented the skull to the Paris Museum of Natural History in 1846.
==Physical description==

Arnoux&#x27;s and Baird&#x27;s beaked whales, have very similar features and would be indistinguishable at sea if they did not exist in disjoint locations. Both whales reach similar sizes, have bulbous melons, and long prominent beaks. Their lower jaw is longer than the upper, and once sexual maturity is reached the front teeth are visible even when the mouth is fully closed. The Baird&#x27;s and Arnoux&#x27;s beaked whales are the only whales in the Ziphiidae family where both sexes have erupted teeth. The teeth in the Ziphiidae are presumed to be used by males for fighting and competition for females. Ziphiidae have the most prevalent and pronounced markings caused by teeth scarring among the cetaceans. Front-facing teeth may be covered in barnacles after many years. 

Baird&#x27;s and Arnoux&#x27;s beaked whales have similarly shaped small flippers with rounded tips, and small dorsal fins that sit far back on their bodies. Adult males and females of both species pick up numerous white linear scars all over the body as they age, and these may be a rough indicator of age. These traits are similar in both sexes, as there is little sexual dimorphism in either species. Among the observed differences in the sexes is their size: female Baird&#x27;s and Arnoux giant beaked whales are slightly larger than the males.

== Population and distribution ==

Arnoux&#x27;s beaked whales inhabit great tracts of the Southern Ocean. Large groups of animals, pods of up to 47 individuals, have been observed off Kemp Land, Antarctica. Beachings in New Zealand and Argentina indicate the whale may be relatively common in the Southern Ocean between those countries and Antarctica; sporadic sightings have been recorded in polar waters, such as in McMurdo Sound. It has also been spotted close to South Georgia and South Africa, indicating a likely circumpolar distribution. The northernmost stranding was at 34 degrees south, indicating the whales inhabit cool and temperate, as well as polar, waters. There is no stock report for the Arnoux&#x27;s beaked whale to date by NOAA.

An April 2022 sighting in the Weddell Sea prompted a review of 108 prior sightings of 1125 individuals, dating to 1986-1998. This review corroborated their presumed range in the Southern Ocean, and found that Arnoux&#x27;s beaked whales prefer the coasts of icy landmasses. In temperate regions above 60 degrees South, they can also be found near continents, even in fjords far inland.

== Conservation ==
Arnoux&#x27;s beaked whale has rarely been exploited, and although no abundance estimates are available, the population is not believed to be endangered.
Arnoux&#x27;s beaked whale is covered by the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (Pacific Cetaceans MOU).

<doc id="380915" wikidata="Q803927" url="?curid=380915" title="Baird's beaked whale">
<text>Baird&#x27;s beaked whale (Berardius bairdii), also known as the northern giant bottlenose whale, North Pacific bottlenose whale, giant four-toothed whale, northern four-toothed whale and the North Pacific four-toothed whale, is a species of whale from the genus &quot;Berardius&quot;. Baird&#x27;s and Arnoux&#x27;s beaked whales are so similar that researchers have debated whether or not they are simply two populations of the same species. However, genetic evidence and their wide geographical separation has led them to be classified as separate. Baird&#x27;s beaked whale is the second largest living species of toothed whale after the sperm whale.

==Taxonomy==
Baird&#x27;s beaked whales were first described in 1883 by American zoologist Leonhard Stejneger based on a skull from a specimen that had been found stranded on the eastern shore of Bering Island the previous fall. The species was named after Spencer Fullerton Baird, the then Secretary of the Smithsonian. A few months after Stejneger&#x27;s description was published, Swedish zoologist August Wilhelm Malm published a description of a new species in the &quot;Beradius&quot; genus, &quot;Beradius vegae&quot;, based on a portion of a skull found on Bering Island in 1879. &quot;Beradius vegae&quot; was later determined to be a junior synonym of &quot;Beradius bairdii&quot;.

==Description== 

The species reaches lengths of about for males and for females. 

The snout, called a beak, is elongated and lacks all teeth except for one or two sets in the lower mandible, which are called &quot;battle teeth&quot; for their use in intra-species conflict. Individuals often bear scars from such confrontations.

Baird&#x27;s beaked whale can live for up to 84 years.
==Distribution==
The species occurs primarily in the North Pacific Ocean, where it is a deep-water cetacean, often frequenting depths between in its search for prey. 

In the northwestern part of its range, sightings have been documented off of Hokkaido, Japan, Sakhalin and Kamchatka, as well as in the Sea of Okhotsk, the Bering Sea and the Aleutian Islands. In the more eastern and southern reaches of their distribution, they have been seen from southern Alaska and down the U.S. West Coast to San Diego and northern Baja California.

<text>Indiana State University (ISU) is a public university in Terre Haute, Indiana, United States. It was founded in 1865 and offers over 100 undergraduate majors and more than 75 graduate and professional programs. Indiana State is classified among &quot;D/PU: Doctoral/Professional Universities&quot;.

==History==
Indiana State University was established by the Indiana General Assembly on December 20, 1865, as the Indiana State Normal School in Terre Haute. Its location in Terre Haute was secured by a donation of $73,000 by Chauncey Rose.
As the State Normal School, its core mission was to educate elementary and high school teachers. 

The school awarded its first baccalaureate degrees in 1908 and the first master&#x27;s degrees in 1928. In 1929, the Indiana State Normal School was renamed as the Indiana State Teachers College, and in 1961, it was renamed Indiana State College due to an expanding mission. In 1965, the Indiana General Assembly renamed the college as Indiana State University in recognition of increasing student population and expansion of degrees offered.

A seminary building was constructed and later used for Vigo Collegiate Institute. After several years the school closed and the property sold to be part of a public institution of education. It is now part of the Indiana State University campus.

== Campus ==

The Indiana State University main campus is located on the north side of Terre Haute&#x27;s downtown business district and covers more than in the heart of the city. The main campus comprises over 60 brick and limestone buildings, halls and laboratories. Efforts to beautify the campus continue: a section of Seventh Street that runs by the university has been converted into a boulevard with flower beds and antique light posts; the old power plant was razed in 2002 and replaced with a modern facility; Stalker Hall reopened in fall 2005 after a complete renovation; Normal Hall, a Neo-Classic building erected in 1909, originally served as the library, was newly renovated in 2015. In 2009, the university dedicated a more than Student Recreation Center, financed via private funding and student fees, and the Bayh College of Education was relocated to the newly renovated, historic University Hall. The Scott College of Business has relocated to the renovated former Terre Haute Federal Building, a classic Art Deco building built in 1933. In fall 2019, the Fine Arts Building was rededicated after a $15 million renovation begun in the summer of 2018. In 2020, The Hulman Center athletic arena was renovated at a cost of $50 million. In February 2023, Dreiser Hall was rededicated after an $18 million renovation. Beginning in 2024, the Technology Annex building was demolished and rebuilt as part of a $66 million modernization and expansion effort, which was the largest capital project funded by the State of Indiana in University history.

The Indiana State University field campus is an outdoor teaching, learning, and research area designed to accommodate educational programs and services. The field campus is located on approximately east of Terre Haute near Brazil, Indiana, and includes eight man-made lakes.

===Fairbanks Hall===
Fairbanks Hall serves not only as an academic space for learning but also as a performance and fine arts venue. The Bare-Montgomery Gallery located inside provides students with the opportunity to exhibit their work or to curate exhibitions of student work.

Fairbanks Hall serves as both a working art studio as well as gallery space for the art department of Indiana State University. Originally built as a Terre Haute public library in 1903–06; it is an outstanding example of Beaux-Arts architecture and constructed entirely from Indiana Limestone.

In 1903, Fairbanks offered to construct a new public library on a site the city would provide; it was to be named in honor of his mother Emeline Fairbanks. Terre Haute acquired a parcel of land at Seventh and Eagle Streets by May 5, 1903, and the groundbreaking took place on March 15, 1904. On August 10, 1904, the cornerstone was placed. A time capsule containing the history of the building, as well as a list of city and university officials, photographs of the namesake Fairbanks family, a copy of the program for the ceremony, copies of the city&#x27;s newspapers and a 1904 Terre Haute city directory.

The informal opening and dedication of the completed building took place on April 29, 1906. On Saturday, August 11, 1906, a formal ceremony to open the building to the public was held, the following Monday, the Emeline Fairbanks Memorial Library opened to the general public.

In 1978, Indiana State University took ownership and following its renovation, it was named Fairbanks Hall in honor of the prominent Terre Haute businessman and philanthropist, responsible for its original construction, Mr. Crawford Fairbanks.

===Normal Hall===
Originally built as the library in 1909, Normal Hall is the last remaining structure from Indiana State&#x27;s Normal School era. Normal Hall served as the university library until Cunningham Memorial Library was built in 1974 and named in honor of Indiana State&#x27;s first Librarian, Arthur Cunningham (1891–1928). On the centennial of Normal Hall&#x27;s construction, it was announced that it would be fully remodeled and will become a student academic honors center. The 2014–15 renovation was approximately $16 million; the original grand staircase and a stained-glass dome featuring images of at least 24 educators and philosophers were restored and the building now meets ADA requirements.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.

===Center for Student Success (CFSS)===
The Center for Student Success, housed within Normal Hall, provides tutoring, supplemental instruction, mentoring, advising, classroom instruction, counseling, and academic success workshops.

The center also provides specialized support programs including the 21st Century Scholar Corps Program, First-Generation Program, Summer Career Exploration Program (SCEE), Students in Transition Program, and Student Support Services Program which includes assistance to persons with disabilities and special needs, and first-generation, low-income students.

===University Hall===
The Indiana State Teachers College Laboratory School was a PWA-funded project, built on land donated to the university by the City of Terre Haute. The initial wing of the building was completed in July 1935. The Sycamore Theater and a gymnasium were completed in 1937 through funding provided by an additional PWA grant. Terre Haute-native Gilbert Brown Wilson added several murals to the interior. The laboratory school operated as a unit of the Vigo County School Corporation. In 2008–09, it was renovated at a cost of $29.8 million and became the new home of the Bayh College of Education.

The Bayh College of Education houses:
* Administrative Placement
* Audiology Clinic
* College of Education

===Students===
For fall 2023, minority student enrollment was 2,359, which represents 29.22% of total enrollment. The top three international student countries are India, Nigeria, and Ghana. Vigo and Marion County are the two largest counties that enrolled students originate from and approximately 57% of enrolled students originate from the state of Indiana.

Indiana State was the first public university in Indiana to require incoming freshmen to have a laptop. ISU first awarded laptop scholarships to incoming freshmen with high school GPAs of 3.0 or higher (on a 4.0 scale), giving students the option of choosing either a laptop or an iPad. The university now awards a laptop computer to those students who are admitted and are Pell-eligible as determined by the FAFSA.

=== Colleges ===
ISU offers more than 100 programs in the Colleges of Arts &amp; Sciences, Business, Education, Technology, and Health and Human Services. The College of Graduate and Professional Studies offers programs that lead to doctoral and master&#x27;s degrees. Students can also pursue certificates in a concentrated area of study, enroll in professional development courses, and fulfill continuing education requirements. ISU also offers 20 bachelor&#x27;s degrees, 22 master&#x27;s degrees, and 7 doctoral degrees—in addition to many professional certifications—available through Indiana State Online.


Indiana State University is organized into six academic colleges:
* Bayh College of Education (est. 1865)
* Donald W. Scott College of Business (est. 1918)
* College of Graduate and Professional Studies (est. 1961)
* College of Arts and Sciences (est. 1962)
* Bailey College of Engineering and Technology (est. 1962)
* College of Health and Human Services (est. 1963)

ISU is also a member of the College Consortium of Western Indiana. This membership allows students who are full-time at their home institution to take classes at the other member institutions of Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology and Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College.

===Library===
The Cunningham Memorial Library collections include more than two million items. Undergraduate students may check out most materials for a three-week loan period, using their student ID.

===Accreditation===
Indiana State University as a whole has been accredited by The Higher Learning Commission continuously since 1915. The Scott College of Business is accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) and the Bayh College of Education is accredited by the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE). The doctoral program in clinical psychology (Psy.D.) is accredited by the American Psychological Association (APA). The School of Music is accredited by the National Association of Schools of Music (NASM). The nursing programs are accredited by the Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing (ACEN). The Bachelor in Social Work program and the Master in Social Work program are both accredited by the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE). The Doctor of Athletic Training program is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Athletic Training Education (CAATE).

==== Campuses ====
Indiana State University-Evansville (now University of Southern Indiana) was created as a branch campus in 1965. Like Ball State University (formerly Indiana State University-Muncie), it became an independent institution of higher education when it was granted independent standing as the University of Southern Indiana in 1985.

===Student Media===
Student Media was created in 2012 in a merger of Student Publications and electronic media outlets under Academic Affairs. Since then, in addition to operating the Indiana Statesman, Sycamore Video, and WISU-FM; Student Media has grown to include &quot;The Sycamore&quot;, a digital yearbook; Syc Creations, a client-driven video and web production group; the Indiana State Sports Network, which produces video for ESPN3 and ESPN+; WZIS, a student-staffed station created when WISU converted to a public radio format; and the Center for Innovation in Technology and Digital Media. While the center is the newest venture, Student Media outlets have been a part of the Indiana State experience for decades. &quot;The Statesman&quot; dates back to 1895 and WISU first went on the air in the early 1960s. The Sycamore, long an institution at Indiana State, was suspended in 1993 and revived in 2013–14.

==University traditions==

===Donaghy Day===
Named for Fred Donaghy, graduate of the Normal School (1912) and a professor of life sciences, this tradition was initiated in 1976 as a day set aside for the community to celebrate the season and to work to help beautify the campus and surrounding community; Donaghy Day is now conducted during the first week of the fall semester and is used to acquaint new students with the university&#x27;s commitment to community engagement.

===Homecoming===
ISU&#x27;s homecoming dates back to December 15, 1917, when Birch Bayh Sr. asked Charlotte Burford, Dean of Women if State could have a Blue and White Day similar to DePauw&#x27;s Black and Gold Day. At that time it was merely an alumni reunion with the big event being the alumni varsity basketball game. The start of Blue and White Day began December 3, 1921, which included religious exercises, &quot;The Alumni Welcome&quot;, a performance by the school orchestra, a pep session, noon luncheon, and the alumni varsity basketball game. Homecoming 1922 brought the addition of &quot;Friday Night Affair&quot; which was a theater party and pep session held at the Indiana Theater. The start of what is now the largest student-organized parade in the nation was December 8, 1923. &quot;The Spirit of Normal,&quot; drawn by two white horses was the winning float, with the honor going to Omega Sorority. The annual bonfire and football game was added to the activities in November 1935. Going up against Rose-Poly (now Rose-Hulman), ISNS, won 25–6. It wasn&#x27;t until sometime in the mid-30s that &quot;Homecoming&quot; was officially adopted as the actual name for the annual celebration.

1937 marked the first year that a Homecoming Queen was crowned. That honor went to Bette Whitmore of Kappa sorority (now Alpha Omicron Pi). The Bachelor of the Year became a part of Homecoming from 1974 to 1989. In 1992, a major change occurred in the traditional contest to diversify and become more inclusive of the student body. The Sycamore Court replaced the Queen and Bachelor of Year to include one female and one male representative from Greek, Residence Hall, African- American, International, Commuter, and Graduate students. It was decided to discontinue the contest entirely in 1993, due to few students participating in the voting of candidates.

The Sycamore Cup Tricycle Derby, a ten-lap race, was added to the growing list of events in 1963. Students rode children&#x27;s tricycles around the &quot;Quad.&quot; The winners were Reeve Hall for the women and Parsons Hall for the men. The popularity of the race became such that students wanted to make the event more prestigious. Thus, in 1967 larger tricycles were customized using frames from Sting-Ray model bicycles. The race moved from the Quad to Marks Field adding more laps and introducing exchanges to make it more competitive. Riders then began conditioning exercises and practices. Due to resurfacing of Marks Field in 1992, the race was moved to ISU&#x27;s Driver Education Center at the Wabash Valley Fairgrounds located five miles south of campus. Today, the race is held at Recreation East which was dedicated in Spring 2000 as the new home for Trike and Tandem races. During the 2005 Homecoming Tricycle Derby festivities, the Michael Simmons Student Activity Center and Susan M. Bareford classroom were dedicated. This building, which is adjacent to the Recreation Track, serves as the headquarters for the two races as well as provides much needed multipurpose space.

The annual Blue and White Dance was always a popular formal dance held either in the Mayflower Room of the Terre Haute House or the Heritage and State Rooms in Tirey Memorial Student Union. Sycamore Showcase replaced the dance in 1968. The first year featured trumpeter Al Hirt with the Tijuana Brass. Throughout the next few years, performers included Bill Cosby, Dionne Warwick, Sergio Mendes and Brazil &#x27;66, Johnny Carson and Doc Severinsen, and Bob Hope. For several years the Sycamore Showcase was replaced with smaller comedy shows because of the difficulty of getting big-name talent to book on specific dates and their reluctance to appear in smaller venues.

Major events today include a campus-wide Blue and White Homecoming Parade, Sycamore Tricycle Derby, Stompin&#x27;, Torchlight Parade, Pep Rally, Tent City, and the Football Game.

The Walk is an Indiana State Homecoming tradition that began in the late 70s. The Walk begins at 6AM on gameday when a large number of students, reaching in the thousands, make the two mile walk east on Wabash Avenue towards the Football Stadium, stopping and having a drink at each bar along the way. In recent years Indiana State University has launched new program to make the walk safer for all. In 2009, the university launched “SoberRide” and “Designated Walker” programs for homecoming. The walk also coincides with the Blue and White parade that runs throughout downtown Terre Haute on game day.

The Walk can be traced back to the late 1970s when students walked from Saturday night football games back to campus, stopping for a beer at every establishment that served beer on Wabash.

===Founders Day===
Conducted in January or February of each year, this event commemorates the opening of the institution in 1870 when 23 students presented themselves to a faculty of three on the first day of classes at the Indiana State Normal School.

===Mascots===
The school has had two mascots. Early on in the school&#x27;s history, the athletes were referred to as the &quot;Fighting Teachers&quot; until the students chose the name &quot;Sycamores&quot;, from the abundance of Sycamore trees in Indiana and especially in the Wabash River Valley; though it is believed that the students voted on &#x27;Sycamores&#x27; on a lark, never thinking it would win. During the 1950s and 60s, the sycamore tree itself was used as Indiana State&#x27;s mascot, with a student dressed in a tree costume. However, as a tree does not lend itself well to an athletic mascot, especially considering Indiana State&#x27;s in-state rivalries with the Ball State Cardinals and Butler Bulldogs, the university created an Indian mascot named Chief Ouabachi, and his Princess, in 1969. 
This change paid homage to the fact that ISU was the &quot;State&quot; university of a state named after Indians (before statehood Indiana was primarily inhabited by Indians). However, the university stopped using Chief Ouabachi as a mascot in 1989. For six years, Indiana State did not have a mascot. In 1995, the university welcomed Sycamore Sam to the ISU family. The blue-and-white creature is a favorite among young and old alike.

==== Sycamores ====
In 1921 a contest was held to pick a name for the athletic teams at what was then called the Indiana State Normal School. Until that time, the term &quot;Fighting Teachers&quot; was frequently used in press accounts of athletic contests. In January 1922, it was announced that the name Sycamores had won a popular vote of the student body. Indiana State University has used this team name ever since.

=== Spring Week and Tandem ===

Spring Week Began in 1970 as part of Indiana State University&#x27;s official Centennial Celebration. The major highlight of Spring Week is the Tandem Race—thought to be the only co-ed tandem bicycle race in the nation. Today, Spring Week is the largest all-campus activity in the spring. The activities include community service, educational, recreational, entertainment, and competitive involvement for students and organizations.

Tandem teams are composed of campus organizations—providing 10 male and female riders, plus two alternates. Organizations enter individually and are paired by drawings.

The 1970 tandem race featured 25 laps on a course through Fairbanks Park on the bank of the Wabash River. Included in the event were competitive games, special entertainment, and a carnival presented by campus organizations. In 1971, the race took place at the Wabash Valley Fairgrounds on the Action Track, a half-mile oval dirt track. It consisted of a 50-mile, 100- lap test of endurance and speed. Activities included midget-races, skydiving, arts and crafts, entertainment, and full-fledged carnival with rides.

The race returned to Fairbanks Park in 1972, then moved to campus in 1973. The race was held in the city streets, which surrounded Sycamore Tower Complex (4th, 5th, Chestnut, and Mulberry Streets). The name “Tandemonia” was coined to replace “Spring Week”. The race moves again in 1974 to Marks Field and consisted of 100 laps or 25 miles on a quarter-mile track. Seventeen teams competed in the race. Corners were close, but no wrecks were caused by the track itself. The 1976 Tandemonia Committee decided to begin the process of “changing over” from Schwinn bikes to newer, lightweight bikes.

Tandemonia 1991 included a Tandem kick-off that replaced the Donaghy Day activities and Tandem Games. Tandemfest, a lip-sync contest was held in Tilson Music Hall, Yell-Like-Hell, the Baseball Rally, and the actual race continued in their traditional pattern.

Due to resurfacing Mark&#x27;s Field for major track events, the race was moved to the Driver&#x27;s Education Center at the Wabash Valley Fairgrounds in 1993. Nineteen races were held on Mark&#x27;s Field.

The 25th anniversary was held in 1995 with “Tandemonia” changing back to “Spring Week” and activities more like the original event, including a campus carnival. The 1996 Spring Week Committee emphasized involving more individuals, as well as residence hall students, by providing a roller blade contest and having pairing decorate windows in Residence Halls rather than in sorority suites. The race continued at the Wabash Valley Fairgrounds through April 1999. Seven races were held at the Driver&#x27;s Education facility. In February 2000 the Tandem practice was moved to the new track at the Recreation East Facility located on 9th and Spruce Streets on the ISU campus. Nine teams competed on April 15, 2000, for a place in the history books as the first race on the new track.

The Michael Simmons Activity Center was added to the Recreation East complex in 2005. This building has added a new dimension to the practices and race by providing officials a central place to score the race and fans to have bleachers for better viewing of the competition.

==== Blue and White ====
In 1899, it was announced that Yale Blue and White would replace the colors of Salmon Pink and White. The colors are also applied to the Blue and White Parade and the Blue and White Dance held during Homecoming each fall.

==== Book and torch ====
The book and torch are official symbols of the university and are featured in its seal. The book symbolizes knowledge and truth gained here and the torch symbolizes the light of inspiration that comes to students in these halls

==== Book and Torch Ceremony ====
This traditional ceremony marks the commitment of the senior class to become active alumni of Indiana State. Historically, each senior class was charged with adding to the Parsons-Sandison Living Memorial Fund, a scholarship fund for Indiana State students. This tradition encompasses two ceremonies, the first of which is on Founder&#x27;s Day (generally in January), at which time the president of the Alumni Board charges the senior class to commit to the university. At commencement, another ceremony is conducted. As part of this ceremony, the senior class answers the challenge of commitment, as they become alumni of the university.

===Trike===
The Indiana State Tricycle Derby was first run in 1963 as a 10-lap race around the sidewalks of the Quadrangle on children&#x27;s tricycles. The races featured a men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s division (the Powder Puff Derby). The races now feature men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams racing on specially built tricycles at the new Recreation East complex at Ninth and Sycamore streets. In October 2005, the Michael Simmons Student Activity Center opened at Rec East, featuring commemorative displays chronicling the history and the participants of trike and tandem, containing bleacher seating, an all-purpose room, restrooms, an observation deck, and storage.

==Songs==

===Fight song===

&quot;March On! (You Fighting Sycamores)&quot;, the university&#x27;s fight song, was authored and arranged by Joseph A. Gramelspacher, an ISU professor of music, as a pep song. It was first performed at a homecoming eve pep rally on October 20, 1939.

Before &quot;March On!&quot;, the school&#x27;s fight song was &quot;Cheer for the Blue and White&quot;, composed in 1931 as part of the Indiana State Teachers College song contest.

In addition to The Marching Sycamores (Pride of Indiana) the School of Music provides these other Ensembles available for music students to participate in as part of the well established School of Music: Concert Band, Jazz Combos, Jazz Ensemble, Percussion Ensemble, Steel Drum Band, University Symphony, Wind Orchestra, Wind Symphony, Sycamore Basketball Band, Choral Ensembles, Concert Choir, Masterworks Chorale, Music Theater/Opera, Sycamore Singers, &amp; Women&#x27;s Chorale.

===Alma mater===
Charles M. Curry, Professor of English and Literature authored &quot;The Alma Mater&quot;. It was originally entitled, &quot;Indiana&#x27;s Normal&quot; and first printed in a June 1912 issue of the &quot;Normal Advance&quot;. Dr. Curry used the music of Annie Lisle for &quot;The Alma Mater&quot;.

==Athletics==
The school&#x27;s athletic teams are known as the &quot;Sycamores&quot;. They participate in the Division I Missouri Valley Conference and NCAA FCS Missouri Valley Football Conference.

Athletically, it is known as the alma mater of basketball player Larry Bird; World Champion gymnast Kurt Thomas; and Olympic, World, and Pan-American Champion freestyle wrestler Bruce Baumgartner. Basketball coach John Wooden coached the Sycamores before accepting the head coaching position at UCLA. The men&#x27;s basketball team played their first season in 1896, making them the oldest team in the NCAA along with Bucknell, Minnesota, Washington and Yale, winning the 1950 NAIB National Championship and finishing as National Runner-Up in 1946 and 1948. They were also the NCAA College Division (Div II) National Runner-Up in 1968 and the Division I National Runner-Up in 1979. The 1950 team comprised the core of the 1951 Pan-American Gold Medal Team. In 1971, Coach Grete Treiber led the ISU Women&#x27;s gymnastics team to a National Runner-up finish at the AIAW National Championships. Kurt Thomas led the Men&#x27;s Gymnastics Team to the 1977 NCAA National Championship. Men&#x27;s tennis player Vedran Vidovic holds the NCAA Division I record for most consecutive singles victories by winning 37 matches in a row from March 18, 2001, to October 28 of the same year.

===Facilities===
Hulman Center, originally named Hulman Civic-University Center, is a multi-use arena that opened in December 1973. It seats 10,200 people for basketball and is home to the Indiana State University Sycamores men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams of the Missouri Valley Conference. It has hosted multiple concerts and the Missouri Valley Conference men&#x27;s basketball tournament title game in 1979, the year legendary Larry Bird helped the undefeated Sycamores reach the championship game of the NCAA tournament. The Hulman Center hosted the 1974 Midwest Region of the NCAA Tournament which featured Creighton, Texas, Oral Roberts, Syracuse, Louisville, and Kansas. It reopened after a two-year, $50 million renovation in December of 2020.

The baseball field is located within a mile of the main campus along the Wabash River. Bob Warn Field at Sycamore Stadium is home to the Sycamore Baseball program and played host to the 2014, 2016, and 2023 Missouri Valley Conference Baseball Championship, as well as the 2023 Terre Haute Regional as part of the NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament. Memorial Stadium, the home field for Indiana State&#x27;s NCAA Football Championship Subdivision football team of the Missouri Valley Football Conference, and the women&#x27;s soccer team is located on Wabash Avenue, two miles (3 km) east of the main campus. The Gibson Track and Field Complex is the newest athletic facility at Indiana State and is located along the Wabash River on the west side of campus. It hosted the 2016 and 2024 Missouri Valley Conference Track and Field Championships. Price Field is the home for the Sycamore Softball team.

Indiana State University has hosted thirteen (2002, 2004–2011, 2013–2014, 2016, 2019) NCAA Division I cross country championships at the LaVern Gibson Championship Cross Country Course, and was once again selected to host them in 2026.

<text>Mark William Latham (; born 28 February 1961) is an Australian politician and media commentator who is a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council. He previously served as the leader of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and leader of the opposition from December 2003 to January 2005, leading the party to defeat at the 2004 federal election. He left the ALP in 2017 and joined Pauline Hanson&#x27;s One Nation in 2018, gaining a seat for that party in the New South Wales Legislative Council at the 2019 New South Wales state election and winning re-election in 2023.

Latham was born in Sydney and studied economics at the University of Sydney. He joined the Labor Party at a young age and worked as a research assistant to Gough Whitlam and Bob Carr. He was elected to the Liverpool City Council in 1987 and became mayor in 1991. Latham entered the House of Representatives by winning the seat of Werriwa at the 1994 Werriwa by-election. He was included in Labor&#x27;s shadow cabinet after the 1996 federal election, but left the frontbench in 1998 following a dispute with the party leader, Kim Beazley. He returned to the shadow cabinet in 2001, when Simon Crean became leader.

Latham became leader of the Labor Party in December 2003, narrowly defeating Beazley in a leadership vote after Crean&#x27;s resignation. He was the youngest leader of the party since Chris Watson in 1901. At the 2004 federal election, the ALP lost five seats and reduced its share of the two-party-preferred vote; the incumbent Howard government was re-elected to a fourth term. Latham became disillusioned with politics and retired in January 2005. After leaving politics, he published a memoir, &quot;The Latham Diaries&quot;, in which he attacked his former colleagues and condemned the state of political life in Australia.

After leaving parliament, Latham started a career as a prominent political and social commentator, and became highly critical of the Labor Party and left-wing politics. He would soon gain a reputation for making inflammatory and controversial comments. In December 2016, he began co-hosting &quot;Outsiders&quot; on Sky News Live, but he was fired from the network in March 2017 after he made insulting comments about a fellow presenter and the teenage daughter of a governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia. Latham returned to politics and joined the Liberal Democratic Party in May 2017, which led to him receiving a lifetime ban from the Labor Party. In November 2018, Latham left the party and announced that he had joined One Nation as its state leader in New South Wales. He successfully stood for the party in the upper house at the 2019 state election. He resigned in the middle of his eight-year term on 2 March 2023 in order to run for a new eight-year term at the state election later that month.

In August 2023, it was announced that Pauline Hanson had removed Latham from the position of party leader for One Nation (New South Wales). On 22 August 2023, Latham resigned from One Nation to sit as an independent.
==Early career==
Latham was born on 28 February 1961 in Ashcroft, a suburb of south-western Sydney in New South Wales. He was educated at Hurlstone Public School; the Hurlstone Agricultural High School, where he was dux; and at the University of Sydney, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Economics with Honours in 1982. While he was a student, Latham worked at the Green Valley Hotel for 2 years. He also worked as an adviser to Labor politician John Kerin from 1980 to 1982. After completing his degree, Latham worked as a research assistant to the former Labor prime minister Gough Whitlam from 1982 to 1987, which included working on the latter&#x27;s book &quot;The Whitlam Government&quot;, and then as an adviser to then-Leader of the New South Wales Opposition Bob Carr from 1988 to 1991.

In 1987, he was elected to the Liverpool City Council, in Sydney&#x27;s south-west, and was mayor from 1991 to 1994. Latham played rugby union with the Liverpool Bulls club and had a stint as its president. He has also been a fan of St George Dragons rugby league club since 1968.

Latham&#x27;s term as mayor saw radical changes introduced to the council, with large spending on public works, to be paid for by a combination of loans and efficiencies achieved from outsourcing many council services.

In an article in &quot;Quarterly Essay&quot;, journalist Margaret Simons, who conducted an extensive investigation of the period, concluded that there were real issues in the financial management of the council. These mostly related to the drafting of the outsourcing agreements. Simons also said most of the allegations come from council members who were sacked for incompetence by the state government.

On 1 June 2004, Latham told Parliament that during his time as mayor he had reduced Liverpool&#x27;s debt service ratio from 17 to 10 percent, which he said was less than half of western Sydney&#x27;s average. He also said Liverpool had adopted a debt retirement strategy that he claimed would have made it debt free by 2005, but it was not implemented by his successors.

==Labor member of Parliament==
In January 1994, Latham was elected at a by-election to the House of Representatives for the Sydney seat of Werriwa, which had been Gough Whitlam&#x27;s seat from 1952 to 1978. He was elected to the Opposition front bench after Labor lost the 1996 election, and became shadow minister for education. After the 1998 election he resigned from the front bench following a policy dispute with the opposition leader, Kim Beazley. The two became political enemies following this incident.

The views expressed in &quot;Civilising Global Capital&quot; (see below) alienated him from many Labor traditionalists, but his aggressive parliamentary style won him many admirers. He once referred to Prime Minister John Howard as an &quot;arselicker&quot; and to the Liberal Party frontbench as a &quot;conga line of suckholes&quot;. He also described U.S. President George W. Bush as &quot;the most incompetent and dangerous president in living memory&quot;.

On politics, Latham commented in 2002: I&#x27;m a hater. Part of the tribalness of politics is to really dislike the other side with intensity. And the more I see of them the more I hate them. I hate their negativity. I hate their narrowness. I hate the way, for instance, John Howard tries to appeal to suburban values when I know that he hasn&#x27;t got any real answers to the problems and challenges we face. I hate the phoniness of that.

==Leader of the Opposition==
Latham was a strong supporter of Kim Beazley&#x27;s successor Simon Crean, defending the leader against his critics within the party. He called Crean&#x27;s principal frontbench detractors, Stephen Smith, Stephen Conroy and Wayne Swan &quot;the three roosters&quot;. When Crean resigned the Labor leadership, Latham contested the ballot for leader against Beazley. On 2 December 2003, Latham won the vote for the leadership by 47 votes to 45. Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard were early contenders for the leadership, but both withdrew in favour of Beazley and Latham respectively. At age 42, Latham became the youngest leader of the federal parliamentary Labor Party since its first leader Chris Watson, who became leader at age 33 in 1901. In his first press conference as leader, Latham championed his belief in a &quot;ladder of opportunity&quot; that would bring prosperity to all Australians.
The Howard government targeted Latham&#x27;s brash personality and his colourful past. Howard characterised him as &quot;Mr Flip-Flop&quot;, referring to a character in a children&#x27;s book. Peter Costello attempted to damage Latham&#x27;s economic credentials by referring to the experimental economic ideas that he had put forward as shadow treasurer, such as abolishing negative gearing and replacing the GST with a Progressive Expenditure Tax. Frequent references were made to Latham&#x27;s temper; he was alleged to have broken a taxi-driver&#x27;s arm in a scuffle arising from a fare dispute.

On winning the leadership, Latham appointed his predecessor, Simon Crean, as shadow treasurer, while also retaining a number of Kim Beazley&#x27;s supporters in senior positions. In July 2004 Beazley himself was re-elected to the ALP front bench as Shadow Minister for Defence.

In January 2004, the Labor Party national conference was held in Sydney. During the conference, Latham received very positive media coverage and introduced his plans for early childhood literacy. He introduced an unusual campaign style, choosing to focus on &quot;values&quot; issues, such as reading to children and economic relief for middle-class Australia, which he termed with the political slogan &quot;ease the squeeze&quot;.

Latham also put forward plans to reform the education and health systems. In contrast to the intense stagecrafting of Latham&#x27;s image at the conference, he boosted his profile by means of loosely organised &quot;town hall&quot;-style direct meetings around the country. By March, Labor had taken the lead over the Coalition in the opinion polls, and Latham had a higher personal approval rating than any opposition leader since Bob Hawke in 1983. Commentators began to discuss the serious possibility that Latham could be Prime Minister by the end of the year.

In March, following the Spanish election at which the pro-Bush administration People&#x27;s Party government was defeated, Latham sparked a new controversy by committing a Labor government to withdrawing Australian troops from Iraq by Christmas. At that time, Australia had about 850 troops in Iraq, mostly involved in patrol work and in training members of the new Iraqi defence forces. Howard accused Latham of a &quot;cut and run&quot; approach and said &quot;it&#x27;s not the Australian way not to stay the distance&quot;.

===2004 federal election campaign===

Until March 2004, Labor under Latham&#x27;s leadership held a strong lead in national opinion polls. Latham&#x27;s commitment to withdraw from Iraq caused a sharp drop in Labor&#x27;s lead, but following the revelations of prisoner abuse in the Abu Ghraib prison, Labor&#x27;s lead increased again, suggesting that support for involvement in Iraq had declined, undermining Howard&#x27;s position.

In June 2004, Labor&#x27;s &quot;troops home by Christmas&quot; policy came under fire from U.S. President George W. Bush who, at a White House press conference during Howard&#x27;s visit to Washington DC, described it as &quot;disastrous&quot;. Bush&#x27;s comments raised controversy in Australia over whether Bush was interfering in Australia&#x27;s domestic political affairs, whether the election of a Latham government would endanger the U.S. alliance, and whether the comments were made with Howard&#x27;s prior knowledge.

Shortly afterwards, Latham announced the recruitment of Peter Garrett, president of the Australian Conservation Foundation and former lead singer with the rock band Midnight Oil, as a Labor candidate in Kingsford Smith, a safe Sydney electorate being vacated by the retiring former minister Laurie Brereton. Garrett revealed that he had been approached months before by senior ALP figures, including John Faulkner and Kim Beazley, and had taken this long to make up his mind. Most commentators regarded his recruitment as a high-risk tactic, seeing the potential advantage to Labor of Garrett&#x27;s popularity among young people as being offset by the possibility that his record of radical and anti-American statements in the past would offend moderate voters.

The second coup scored by Latham was the announcement that he would abolish the generous superannuation schemes available to members of parliament; his plan was quickly adopted by the Howard government in the face of a rising wave of public support with the support of his mentor former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, the former member for Werriwa.

Other announced policies and initiatives included: the introduction of federal government parenting classes for those parents deemed to be failing to adequately discipline their children; a ban on food and drink advertising during children&#x27;s television viewing hours; the introduction of a national youth mentoring program; the government distribution of free story books to the families of newborn children; a federal ban on plastic shopping bags; and the introduction of legislation to prohibit vilification on the basis of religious beliefs or sexual orientation, similar to laws adopted in the state of Victoria that some critics said had led to a restriction of free speech. Some of these initiatives prompted Howard to criticise Latham as a &quot;behavioural policeman&quot;.

In July 2004, Latham again became the centre of controversy when it was alleged on a commercial television network that he had punched a political rival during his time on Liverpool Council. Latham strongly denied the accusation. On 6 July 2004, he called a press conference and denounced the government for maintaining what he called a &quot;dirt unit,&quot; which he said was gathering personal material about him, including details of his first marriage. The government denied that any such unit existed, but some observers speculated that Liberal Party researchers had accumulated more potentially embarrassing material about Latham, which would be used during the election campaign (a threat which never eventuated), in addition to claims that Latham was an inexperienced economic manager.

Between March and August, Latham&#x27;s position in the opinion polls gradually declined, leading to renewed speculation that Howard would call an early election. During August, Labor claimed a tactical victory over the government on the issue of the Australia – United States Free Trade Agreement and there were allegations in a Senate inquiry that Howard had lied about the &quot;Children Overboard Affair&quot; during the 2001 election campaign. By mid-August, Labor was again ahead in all three national opinion polls.

The election was held on 9 October 2004. Although opinion polls showed the ALP leading the government at various stages of the six-week campaign, the government was re-elected with an increased majority. This was despite Latham being generally credited with a strong performance and a victory in the sole campaign debate. In the days after the election, Latham was criticised for releasing many key policies too late, a case in point being Labor&#x27;s policy regarding conservation of Tasmanian old growth forests.

Among those critical of Latham were journalists Tom Allard and Mark Metherell, who said &quot;the flurry of releases meant Mr Latham went off message from Labor&#x27;s core strengths of health and education.&quot; Labor&#x27;s party president, Carmen Lawrence, blamed the unexpected severity of the defeat on an effective Coalition &quot;scare campaign&quot; focused on Latham&#x27;s limited economic management experience, and the alleged threat of a rise in interest rates under Labor, which was not effectively countered, reportedly in an attempt by Tim Gartrell to conserve funds for later in the campaign (where, in previous years, Labor had been outspent by the Liberals).

Gartrell also apparently failed to anticipate the interest rates scare campaign. The inability of his campaign to counter the Liberal campaign would later be cited by Latham himself, in the &quot;Latham Diaries&quot;, as a key reason for the election loss. Latham wrote that he had told his wife Janine that &quot;I&#x27;ve tried to carry the whole show on my shoulders: my family, my community, my party. But now I&#x27;m stuffed. I have collapsed under the weight of those fucking ads&quot;. Michael Costello, a former chief of staff to Kim Beazley, said: &quot;This is a complete train wreck. We now face at least two terms before we can win government again. We face at least three years with John Howard pretty much in control of the Senate.&quot;

On the morning of 8 October, the day before the election, a television crew filmed Latham and Howard shaking hands as they crossed paths outside an Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio studio in Sydney. The footage showed Latham appearing to draw Howard towards him and tower over his shorter opponent. The incident received wide media coverage and, while Latham claimed to have been attempting to get revenge for Howard squeezing his wife&#x27;s hand too hard at a press function, it was variously reported as being &quot;aggressive&quot;, &quot;bullying&quot; and &quot;intimidating&quot; on the part of Latham. The Liberal Party campaign director, Brian Loughnane, later said this incident generated more feedback to Liberal headquarters than anything else during the six-week campaign, and that it &quot;brought together all the doubts and hesitations that people had about Mark Latham&quot;. Latham disputes the impact of this incident, however, having described it as a &quot;Tory gee-up: we got close to each other, sure, but otherwise it was a regulation man&#x27;s handshake. It&#x27;s silly to say it cost us votes – my numbers spiked in the last night of our polling.&quot; According to Latham&#x27;s account of events, Latham came in close to Howard for the handshake to prevent Howard shaking with his arm rather than his wrist.

Latham became the first Labor opposition leader since Frank Tudor in 1917 to fail to make a net gain in seats from the government at his first election. Some commentators, including Kim Beazley, said Latham&#x27;s leadership had rescued Labor from a much heavier defeat. Beazley said polling a year before the election indicated the ALP would lose &quot;25–30 seats&quot; in the House of Representatives. Instead the party lost a net four seats in the lower house, a swing of 0.21% and there was a 1.1% swing to the ALP in the Senate.

===Leadership tensions===

Labor&#x27;s defeat led to media criticisms of Latham&#x27;s personal style and policy priorities, and also to a crisis in confidence in his leadership within the Labor caucus. Several prominent members of the front-bench, notably John Faulkner, Lindsay Tanner and Bob McMullan, chose not to recontest front-bench positions. McMullan made it clear he was unhappy with Latham&#x27;s leadership style and gave an interview suggesting there would be a leadership challenge early in 2005. The national secretary of the Australian Workers&#x27; Union, Bill Shorten, was also highly critical of Latham.

In December, after Latham was incorrectly reported to have blamed Labor&#x27;s state premiers for the defeat, an unnamed Labor frontbencher predicted a leadership challenge within the next few months, saying Latham&#x27;s supporters had lost confidence in him. Latham also had a heated public confrontation with the Labor deputy leader in the Senate, Stephen Conroy, renewing speculation there would be a challenge to Latham&#x27;s leadership in the new year.

Latham was helped by the fact that there was no obvious successor to the leadership. The most likely candidates, Kevin Rudd, Wayne Swan and Stephen Smith, accepted senior positions on Latham&#x27;s frontbench and pledged loyalty to him. The leaders of the Socialist Left faction, and the centre-left under Martin Ferguson and Julia Gillard, also maintained their support for him. There was little support for a return to Beazley, and neither Tanner nor McMullan were seen as viable leadership candidates. In the longer run, however, many commentators doubted Latham would survive until the 2007 election after such a heavy defeat.

The final crisis for Latham&#x27;s leadership erupted in the aftermath of the December 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. With both Latham and his deputy leader, Jenny Macklin, on leave, the acting opposition leader, Senator Chris Evans, issued statements in the aftermath of the tsunami. Latham was criticised for not issuing a statement as leader personally, particularly at a time when John Howard expressed national sympathy over the disaster, pledged $1 billion in loans to Indonesia and declared a national day of mourning. Latham rejected the criticism of his non-appearance after the tragedy, saying &quot;none of my verbiage could make any practical difference – bring back the dead, reverse the waves, organise the relief effort&quot;. Macklin issued a statement on the disaster on 30 December before also choosing to take leave.

Opinion polls in January showed a sharp decline in Latham&#x27;s support and a preference for the return of Beazley as Labor leader.

===Departure from politics===
On 18 January 2005, citing life-threatening illness and family concerns, Latham announced his resignation from the Labor Party leadership and from Parliament. He strongly criticised the media for invading his family&#x27;s privacy during his illness. Latham had been federal Labor leader for 13 months, the shortest tenure since Billy Hughes was expelled from the party in 1916. Latham was only the second federal Labor leader, after Matthew Charlton in 1928, to leave politics without ever having held ministerial office.

Political journalist Mungo MacCallum wrote: Latham became leader too early in his career, he lacked the skills needed to deal with the webs of intrigue within his own party, he refused to massage the media and the advisers he did listen to were out of their depth against Howard&#x27;s praetorian guard. But he had many qualities that were not only desirable and attractive but are in short supply in today&#x27;s ALP. In other circumstances he could have developed into a formidable leader, even prime minister. As it is, he remains one of the great what-ifs.

==Publications==
Although Latham wrote &quot;Civilising Global Capital&quot; while he was an MP, most of his works have been written after his parliamentary career.

===&quot;Civilising Global Capital&quot;===
While on the backbench of Parliament in the late 1990s, Latham published &quot;Civilising Global Capital: New Thinking for Australian Labor&quot; (Allen and Unwin, 1998), in which he argued that Labor needed to abandon many of its traditional policies and embrace the aspirational values (home ownership, higher education) of the upwardly-mobile skilled working class and small business class. His policies as the leader of the Labor Party were largely derived from the stance taken in this book, which ideologically is described as &quot;the third way&quot;.

===Biography===
Latham&#x27;s biography &quot;Loner: Inside a Labor Tragedy,&quot; by Bernard Lagan, was launched on 29 June 2005 by Senator John Faulkner, published by Allen &amp; Unwin. The book caused furore within Labor ranks. Most of this was due to material contained within a single email written by Latham in the last page of the book. Of Kim Beazley&#x27;s return to the leadership, Latham said: &quot;Labor got the leader it truly deserves – it is well suited to a conservative stand-for-nothing type of leader.&quot; Latham also criticised state Labor premiers Bob Carr, Peter Beattie and Geoff Gallop, calling them &quot;A-grade arseholes.&quot; Union leader Bill Shorten remarked that Latham had displayed &quot;all the attributes of a dog except loyalty.&quot;

Of his election loss, Latham wrote: I had my shot at being prime minister. It didn&#x27;t work out on several fronts. But life goes on, potentially in a splendid way, spending so much time with my family. After suffering testicular cancer, the greatest gift in my life has been the ability to have children with Janine. I would be a fool to waste it.

===&quot;The Latham Diaries&quot;===

Soon after his retirement, Latham announced his decision to publish a selection of diary entries spanning almost a decade. Following a bidding war, it was announced that Melbourne University Press (MUP) would publish the &quot;Diaries&quot; in late September. MUP later awarded the exclusivity rights for extracts to News Ltd and the exclusivity for the first interview to the ABC television program &quot;Enough Rope,&quot; which was due to be broadcast at 9.30 pm on Monday 19 September 2005.

Meanwhile, excerpts of the &quot;Diaries&quot; were published by &quot;The Australian&quot; from 15 September ahead of their publication in book form on 19 September. The excerpts published include attacks by Latham on the ALP, his successor Kim Beazley, frontbencher Kevin Rudd and former Labor prime ministers Paul Keating and Gough Whitlam.

Due to the publicity the &quot;Diaries&quot; were now generating, the extensive amount of published extracts, and concerns that Latham had recorded other interviews, in particular with another ABC program, &quot;Lateline&quot;, &quot;Enough Rope&quot; pushed to have the interview broadcast four days early on Thursday 15 September at 8.30 pm with a simultaneous broadcast on some ABC radio stations. However, when the time came to broadcast, the ABC announced that the interview would not be shown due to a legal injunction sought by News Limited (owner of &quot;The Australian&quot;), which had the rights to publish extracts from the &quot;Diaries&quot;. Reports on the night said any broadcast by the ABC was a breach of confidentiality between News and the book&#x27;s publisher, MUP, the newspaper publisher having signed to an A$80,000 deal to publish excerpts of the book in the weekend newspapers. However, at 10.30 pm, the ABC aired the Denton interview after the Supreme Court of New South Wales lifted the injunction. Justice Harry Palmer said the publication of large parts of the book in News Limited newspapers largely destroyed the value of the material. Due to the last-minute changes, the edition of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Lateline&quot; program scheduled for 10.30 pm featuring another interview with Latham (also subject to the short-lived injunction) was aired the following night.

The &quot;Diaries&quot; represent a remarkable and unprecedented statement by a former leader of a major political party. In the book, Latham is scathing about Australia&#x27;s political system: It takes committed people ... and turns them into one-dimensional robots ... The only good news is that the public is on to them. The electorate has worked out the artificiality of it all. They can see through the spin doctors, the publicity stunts, the polling and the tricks of marginal-seat campaigning. This is why people now talk about politics with a cool anger. They have a clear feeling that the system is far from genuine. That the robots, in fact, are tin men.

===&quot;A Conga Line of Suckholes&quot;===
Latham&#x27;s seventh book, a collection of quotations titled &quot;A Conga Line of Suckholes&quot;, was released by Melbourne University Publishing in late September 2006.

===&quot;No Exit The ALP&quot;===
In November 2010, Latham contributed an essay in &quot;The Monthly&quot; titled &quot;No Exit The ALP&quot;. In it, Latham again criticised the ALP, writing that &quot;for all the heightened rhetoric, for the seemingly endless creation of summits, committees and policy review processes, the lasting impression from the Rudd years is one of emptiness&quot;. He also remarked that &quot;Without a guiding philosophy of politics, Rudd&#x27;s prime ministership was an exercise in populism. He avoided tough decisions and mastered the art of media manipulation as a way of extending his honeymoon&quot;. Latham concludes that Labor had &quot;lost its way&quot;. His suggested solution is that Labor again champions great causes, writing that:

Having studied the literature and, at one time, been part of these debates, I can identify just three credible ideas that have been advanced for the renewal of the social democratic project. Each seeks to move beyond economic issues, beyond the material realm of politics, to stake out new ground. The first tries to reclaim social capital, the rebuilding of mutualism and community, as a Labor icon. The second positions Labor as an anti-establishment party, breaking down the entrenched centres of power in society. The third champions a crusade on climate change, an uncompromising attempt to roll back the materialism of western society in favour of environmental values.

Latham finishes his essay by writing about the difficulties of each approach.

=== Other publications ===
Mark Latham also wrote &quot;Reviving Labor&#x27;s agenda: a program for local reform&quot; (Pluto Press / Australian Fabian Society, 1990), &quot;What did you learn today?: creating an education revolution&quot; (Allen &amp; Unwin, 2001), &quot;From the Suburbs: Building a Nation from our Neighbourhoods&quot; (Pluto Press Australia, 2003), &quot;The Political Bubble: Why Australians Don&#x27;t Trust Politics&quot; (Pan Macmillan, 2014), &quot;Latham at Large&quot; (Melbourne University Press, 2015), and &quot;Taking Back Australia: Saving Our Country, Our Culture, Our Civilisation&quot; (Wilkinson Publishing, 2018).

He also wrote a weekly column for the Spectator magazine (Australian edition) entitled &quot;Latham&#x27;s Law&quot;.

==Post-political life==

===Melbourne University Lecture===
Latham gave his first public lecture since the release of the &quot;Diaries&quot;, titled &quot;Ten Reasons Why Young Idealistic People Should Forget About Organised Politics&quot;, on 27 September 2005, at Melbourne University. During the lecture, he argued that organised politics is ineffective at achieving real social change, due to public apathy, the rise of conservatism and the inward-focused structure of the major parties, and instead encouraged youth to focus on more grassroots, community-based programs. He also claimed politics has a detrimental impact on health, happiness and family life, largely blaming the &quot;arrogant&quot; and &quot;incompetent&quot; media, as well as internal party struggles.

===Incident at Hungry Jack&#x27;s===
On 19 January 2006, Latham was eating with his two sons at a Hungry Jack&#x27;s restaurant in Campbelltown, New South Wales when he was photographed by Ross Schultz, a photographer from &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. Latham snatched the camera and smashed it, without destroying the electronic media that contained the photographs. The &quot;Telegraph&quot; subsequently announced plans for upcoming publication of the photographic images in the following Saturday&#x27;s edition and that it would be seeking $12,000 from Latham to replace the equipment. The following day, Latham appeared to drive towards a Channel 7 television cameraman at his Sydney home. The photographer was unhurt but Seven&#x27;s head of news in Sydney, Chris Willis, said the footage clearly showed Latham&#x27;s car veer toward the cameraman as he stood on the side of the road. In February 2006, Latham was charged with assault, malicious damage and theft in relation to the incident. Latham did not appear in Campbelltown Local Court to face the charges, on 22 March, instead giving a lecture to political science students at the Australian National University. When asked by a student how he could blame everyone else but himself, Latham replied: &quot;I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t come in here and expose myself as a miserable arsewipe.&quot; On 26 April, &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; reported that Latham again chose not to appear in Campbelltown Local Court in relation to the 19 January incident. The case was adjourned to 24 May. On 6 June, &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; reported that Latham escaped having a criminal conviction for malicious damage to the camera being used by Schultz recorded against him, but had been placed on a good behaviour bond for two years. After pleading guilty to malicious damage, he had the charges of assault and theft dropped. He was also required to pay $6,763.70 in compensation for the damaged camera.

&quot;The Sun Herald&quot; reported on 13 August 2006 that the family were moving from their Glen Alpine home to a property at Mount Hunter, near Camden.

===2007 federal election===
He commented on the 2007 federal election campaign with an article in the &quot;Australian Financial Review&quot;, in which he said Australia was having a &quot;Seinfeld election, a show about nothing&quot;. Latham wrote that, no matter which party won, Australia would have a conservative economic policy and an industrial relations system which was decentralised and productivity-based. He stated that Australian public life had reached the &quot;zenith of policy convergence&quot;, and that &quot;Many people in the Labor movement are expecting Labor in power to be far more progressive than its stated election promises. I expect a Labor administration to be even more timid, more conservative&quot;.

===2010 federal election===
In 2010, Latham was a guest reporter for television show &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, where he reported on the federal election campaign. It was here that during a report he confronted Julia Gillard. Latham pushed his way through the crowd and confronted Gillard and her partner, Tim Mathieson, saying: &quot;I understand you have made a complaint about me working for Channel 9&quot;. Gillard replied &quot;I don&#x27;t know anything about that, Mark. If you want to work with Channel 9, that&#x27;s a matter for you&quot;, before Latham suggested that Kevin Rudd had been behind the leaks against her during the campaign.

During the campaign, Latham attacked Gillard&#x27;s stance on population growth as &quot;a fraud&quot;, arguing that the Gillard government would have to reduce immigration levels if it was serious about easing population pressures in Australia&#x27;s capital cities.

He also caused a stir when, on &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, he urged voters to issue a protest vote by leaving the ballot paper blank on election day: They say that voting in Australia is compulsory, but it&#x27;s not compulsory to fill out the ballot paper. You can put it in the ballot box, totally blank. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll be doing on Saturday and I urge you to do the same. It&#x27;s the ultimate protest vote. Following that interview, he continued to attack Gillard as well as journalist Laurie Oakes.

===2013 federal election===
On 14 August 2013, during the election federal campaign, Latham was interviewed by the 3AW radio station in Melbourne. He caused controversy when asked to comment on Liberal Party leader Tony Abbott&#x27;s characterisation of Fiona Scott, the Liberal candidate for Lindsay, as having &quot;sex appeal&quot;. Latham responded: It showed very bad judgment, it showed that he&#x27;s got low standards. I&#x27;ve had a good look at Fiona Scott [...] and I don&#x27;t think she&#x27;s got sex appeal at all. [... Abbott] must have had the beer goggles on because she&#x27;s not that good of a sort, and I&#x27;d rather have an aspirant for the prime ministership who&#x27;s a good judge when it comes to checking out the good sorts.

===Controversy at the &quot;Australian Financial Review&quot; and Triple M===
In August 2015, Latham resigned from his regular column after spending eight years with the &quot;Australian Financial Review&quot;. His resignation was linked to a series of articles critical of Australian of the Year Rosie Batty and also Group Captain Catherine McGregor.

In January 2016, further controversy erupted over Latham&#x27;s radio podcast on Triple M with comments that he paraphrased from a government report saying &quot;men who have lost their self esteem&quot; turn to domestic violence &quot;as a coping mechanism.&quot; Latham referred to Batty (whose son was murdered by his father) as &quot;exploiting her personal tragedy&quot; and &quot;doing more harm than good&quot; by publicising domestic violence against women and children as an epidemic &quot;when the official reports show it at one percent.&quot; Batty responded that she hoped &quot;someone like Mark is able to become more informed and (is) not stuck in the, I guess, ignorant position because that type of thinking went out several decades ago...there are still some people unfortunately very influenced and stuck in those (mindsets).&quot;

Triple M is a supporter of White Ribbon Campaign, a charity which is led by men to raise awareness of domestic violence caused by men. Since Latham&#x27;s podcast was broadcast, there have been widespread calls for White Ribbon to distance itself from Triple M and Latham. The chair of White Ribbon, John Rosewarn, responded that &quot;Mark Latham&#x27;s views on domestic violence, as aired by Triple M, show his lack of understanding and knowledge of this complex issue, including its prevalence, causes and community response.&quot; White Ribbon also tweeted: &quot;Domestic violence is much more than physical violence; it&#x27;s never a coping mechanism.&quot;

===2016 US presidential election===
During the 2016 United States presidential election, Latham announced his support for Republican candidate Donald Trump, stating &quot;Donald is by no means perfect but I much prefer his approach to the lying snakes of machine politics and media manipulation&quot; and praised Trump&#x27;s pledge to dismantle the Obama administration&#x27;s deals with Iran.

===Commentator===

After leaving federal politics, Latham worked as a journalist and political and social commentator, appearing on numerous panel programs including &quot;Sunrise&quot; on the Seven Network and &quot;The Verdict&quot; on the Nine Network. In 2016, Latham became co-host of Sky News Live programs &quot;Jones + Co&quot; and in 2017 co-host of &quot;Outsiders&quot;.

In a March edition of &quot;Outsiders&quot;, Latham criticised a lack of diversity among corporate diversity officers and included Sky News colleague Peter van Onselen&#x27;s wife as an example. Van Onselen and his &quot;To The Point&quot; co-host Kristina Keneally criticised Latham for the segment. Latham responded by criticising both, including negative statements about Keneally&#x27;s record as Premier of New South Wales. Keneally threatened to take defamation action and made a formal complaint to Sky News management. In a separate incident, ABC Radio Sydney presenter Wendy Harmer initiated legal action after Latham made numerous statements criticising her.

A third controversy related to Latham questioning the sexuality of a school student during an &quot;Outsiders&quot; segment criticising a video put out by Sydney Boys High School in support of International Women&#x27;s Day and suggested he &quot;thought that first guy was gay&quot;, referring to a student in the video. Latham was fired from Sky News on 29 March 2017 after the story was published.

Latham later defended himself saying that a lot of journalists who discussed the comments had not seen the show: That video was put out there to deliberately confuse people, because the young people were using the words of women and the first fellow up was talking about sex with a man - so it became clear later on what the sort of trick was, but they put it up there for public discussion, we had a discussion about it on the show. No offence was meant, none should have been taken. It really is appalling that people who complained about nothing at the time all of a sudden get worked up later on...

In April 2017, Latham launched a website called Mark Latham&#x27;s Outsiders and hosted a weekly Facebook Live program. Despite sharing the same name, it is unrelated to the Sky News program &quot;Outsiders&quot; which has continued without him as host.

In the same month, Latham created a video titled &quot;What&#x27;s Gone Wrong With Australian Multiculturalism: Ethnic Enclaves in Fairfield&quot;, where he was subsequently criticised by the leaders of Fairfield for describing the deficiency of English in the area as &quot;disgraceful&quot;. In the video, he tried to interview the residents of Fairfield, most of whom refused to speak due to a language barrier. Also in the video, Latham postulated that the ethnic enclave in Fairfield and Cabramatta signaled multiculturalism was failing as the West Asian-descent people in Fairfield did not want to visit Cabramatta, a suburb with a large East Asian population. Assyrian Resource Centre manager Carmen Lazar rebutted Latham, saying many programs in Fairfield aid refugees to learn English, such as Navitas Limited.

In 2019, Latham was a keynote speaker at the inaugural Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Australia, alongside former prime minister Tony Abbott and British politician Nigel Farage.

==Return to politics==
===Liberal Democrats===
In May 2017, Latham announced via his Facebook page that he would be joining the Liberal Democrats, a libertarian party. The Labor Party responded by placing a life ban on Latham from ever re-joining the party, after a motion was passed by the New South Wales branch of the Labor Party. According to Latham, he had terminated his ALP membership in March 2017 after being refused permission to address a party gathering.

Latham also announced that he was open to running as a candidate for the Liberal Democrats in future elections. However, he was blocked by the party executive from running as a candidate and, as a result, resigned his party membership in September 2018.

===One Nation===
In November 2018, Latham announced that he had joined One Nation as the party&#x27;s state leader in New South Wales, and would stand for the Legislative Council at the 2019 state election. In response, Luke Foley, the state ALP leader, ruled out recommending preferences to One Nation candidates. Latham ran on a platform which opposed immigration, congestion, overdevelopment and renewable power, and proposed DNA tests for Aboriginal welfare recipients and banning the burqa in Government buildings.

Latham was successful in his bid to return to parliament, winning an eight-year term in the Legislative Council alongside Rod Roberts. Latham&#x27;s maiden speech to the state parliament focused on criticising &quot;leftist elites&quot;, maintaining the values of Western civilisation, the importance of education and the right to freedom of speech, as exemplified in the recent Israel Folau controversy.

Since 2020, Latham has promoted a bill titled &quot;Parental Rights&quot; which seeks to prohibit teachers from discussing &quot;the ideology of gender fluidity to children in schools&quot;.

In 2021, Latham moved a motion to pull Bruce Pascoe&#x27;s book &quot;Dark Emu&quot; from the New South Wales school curriculum. One Nation, Fred Nile and the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party voted for it, while the Liberal Party, the National Party, Labor and the Greens voted down the motion.

In October 2022, Latham announced his plan to quit the Legislative Council just before the 2023 New South Wales state election and to run again on the top of the One Nation ticket. The plan was designed to increase the numbers of One Nation in the Legislative Council from two to four after the election. He resigned from the Legislative Council on 2 March 2023 and was re-elected 23 days later. His seat was filled by Tania Mihailuk.

Following an intervention from the federal branch of One Nation, Latham was removed from the position of state leader of One Nation in New South Wales. Hanson cited the party&#x27;s worse than expected 14% drop in vote at the New South Wales state election in March. No member has replaced Latham as leader of the NSW One Nation branch. Latham denounced this decision, declaring that Hanson should &quot;buy a mirror&quot; as her own vote share had decreased at the previous federal election, and that she had stacked the NSW state executive with interstate residents. Latham&#x27;s colleagues split over the issue; Roberts supported his position by denouncing several members of the new executive as unqualified, while Mihaluk remained silent and was seen as being supportive of Hanson&#x27;s decision. On 22 August 2023, Latham and Roberts resigned from One Nation to sit as independents.

==Political positions==
===Immigration===
Latham supports a travel ban on certain Islamic countries, saying, &quot;If you know that there&#x27;s a country that&#x27;s producing a lot of troublemakers, would-be terrorists, radical jihadists coming to Australia, what sort of sane nation would say, &#x27;Bring &#x27;em in!&#x27; If you know there&#x27;s a nation that&#x27;s no good for us, then turn off the tap.&quot;

===Burqa ban===
Latham supports banning the burqa in government buildings, banks and airports.

===LGBT rights===
====Same-sex-marriage====
Latham has previously claimed he is a supporter of same-sex marriage. However, in 2017 during the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey he endorsed the &#x27;no&#x27; vote, saying that a &#x27;yes&#x27; vote &quot;will open a can of worms&quot;.

====Alex Greenwich homophobic tweet controversy====
Following the 2023 New South Wales state election, Alex Greenwich, who is openly gay, called Latham &quot;a disgusting human being&quot;, in response to pro-LGBT protesters being attacked outside a church Latham was delivering a speech in, regarding &quot;religious freedom, parental rights, school education and protecting [non-government] schools from Alphabet Activism&quot;.

Latham wrote, in reply to Greenwich saying he was &quot;disgusting&quot;, a tweet saying that anal sex between men was &quot;disgusting&quot;, in terms that were universally reviled as offensive and inflammatory, even by his own lawyers in court, who stated that although the tweet was &quot;offensive and crass and vulgar&quot;, it was not defamatory. The comments were deemed to be homophobic by Greenwich and other politicians, and received significant backlash, even from within his own party as Pauline Hanson criticised Latham and called for him to apologise. Latham later deleted the tweet, but refused to apologise. Greenwich strongly criticised the tweet (which he says brought him to tears), calling Latham &quot;unfit for office&quot;.

Conservative commentator Andrew Bolt, who had interviewed Latham several times on &quot;Sky News Australia&quot;, said that Latham had a &quot;self-destruct button&quot; and questioned his ability to function as a political leader after &quot;earning the contempt of so many&quot;. Newly elected New South Wales Premier Chris Minns called Latham&#x27;s tweet &quot;vile and shameful&quot;, and labelled him a &quot;bigot&quot;. Environment Minister Penny Sharpe also criticised Latham&#x27;s comments. Federal Nationals leader David Littleproud called on Pauline Hanson to take action against Latham for his comments.

On 28 April 2023, Greenwich threatened legal action against Latham for &quot;homosexual vilification&quot;. Latham again refused to apologise, causing Opposition Leader Mark Speakman to condemn his comments. In May 2023, Greenwich announced he would be launching defamation action against Latham over the tweet. He also made a formal police complaint about Latham using a carriage service to harass and offend, and a homosexual vilification complaint to the anti-discrimination board.

On 11 September 2024, Judge David O&#x27;Callaghan of the Federal Court ruled that the tweet was defamatory because it made Greenwich out to be a person that &quot;engages in disgusting sexual activities&quot;. He rejected Latham&#x27;s defences, a statutory defence of honest opinion and a common law defence of qualified privilege, right of reply to attack. Greenwich also claimed that the tweet conveyed that Greenwich was not a fit and proper person to be a member of the New South Wales Parliament, however, the judge found that allegation not proven. The court awarded Greenwich $140,000 in damages. Greenwich praised the judgement, saying &quot;It gives me confidence that we&#x27;ve established some case law here that can protect other LGBTQ people&quot;, and that &quot;The strength of this judgment is that it is made clear that this Trump-style political attack on your opponents based on their sexuality, based on whatever you want to attack them for, has no place in the Australian public political discourse&quot;.

===Australia Day===
In 2018, Latham launched a Save Australia Day campaign with help from Aboriginal politician Jacinta Price in response to the #ChangeTheDate social media campaign which called for the date of Australia Day to be moved or for the holiday to be abolished entirely. Latham argued &quot;Changing the date will not change the circumstances of any disadvantaged Indigenous people&quot; and &quot;if the Left succeeds in moving or abolishing Australia Day, there is nothing about Australia that will be safe into the future&quot;.

==Personal life==
Latham began dating his first wife, Gabrielle Gwyther, in 1987, and they married in 1991. They separated in 1997 and divorced in 1999. Latham married his second wife, Janine Lacy, in 2000; they have two sons together. Latham announced his separation from Lacy in 2022.

Latham has described himself as a humanist. In a 2004 interview he said &quot;I&#x27;m agnostic. I think there&#x27;s a force, a spiritual world beyond the material. But I&#x27;m not in a position to define it, let alone put it into a certain form of religious practice.&quot;

<text>John Pendleton Kennedy (October 25, 1795 – August 18, 1870) was an American novelist, lawyer and Whig politician who served as United States Secretary of the Navy from July 26, 1852, to March 4, 1853, during the administration of President Millard Fillmore, and as a U.S. Representative from Maryland&#x27;s 4th congressional district, during which he encouraged the United States government&#x27;s study, adoption and implementation of the telegraph. A lawyer who became a lobbyist for and director of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, Kennedy also served several terms in the Maryland General Assembly and became its Speaker in 1847.

Kennedy later helped lead the effort to end slavery in Maryland, which, as a non-Confederate state, was not affected by the Emancipation Proclamation and required a state law to free slaves within its borders and to outlaw the furtherance of the practice.

Kennedy also advocated religious tolerance, and furthered studies of Maryland history. He helped preserve or found Historic St. Mary&#x27;s City (site of the colonial founding of Maryland and the birthplace of religious freedom in America), St. Mary&#x27;s College of Maryland (then St. Mary&#x27;s Female seminary), the Peabody Library (now a part of Johns Hopkins University) and the Peabody Conservatory of Music (also now a part of Johns Hopkins).

==Early life and education==
John Pendleton Kennedy was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on October 25, 1795, the son of an Irish immigrant and merchant, John Kennedy. His mother, the former Nancy Pendleton, was descended from the First Families of Virginia family. Poor investments resulted in his father declaring bankruptcy in 1809. John Pendleton Kennedy attended private schools while growing up and was relatively well-educated for the time. He graduated from Baltimore College in 1812. His brother Anthony Kennedy would become a U.S. Senator.
Kennedy&#x27;s college studies were interrupted by the War of 1812. He joined the army and in 1814, marched with the United Company of the 5th Baltimore Light Dragoons, known as the &quot;Baltimore 5th,&quot; a unit that included rich merchants, lawyers, and other professionals. Kennedy wrote humorous amounts of his military escapades, such as when he lost his boots and marched onward in dancing pumps. The war was, however, serious, and Kennedy participated in the disastrous Battle of Bladensburg as the British threatened the new national capitol, Washington, D.C. Secretary of State James Monroe ordered the Baltimore 5th to move back from the left of the forward line to an exposed position a quarter-mile away. After the British forces crossed a bridge, the 5th moved forward. The fighting was intense: nearly every British officer among the advancing troops was hit, but then the British fired Congreve rockets. At first, the 5th stood firm, but when the two regiments to the right ran away, the 5th also broke. Kennedy threw away his musket and carried a wounded fellow-soldier (James W. McCulloh) to safety. Kennedy later fought in the Battle of North Point, which saved Baltimore from a burning similar to that of the capitol. Another wartime contact who proved crucial in Kennedy&#x27;s later political and business career was George Peabody, who later helped finance the B&amp;O Railroad and founded the House of Morgan, as well as the Peabody Institute.

Kennedy spent his summers in Martinsburg, Virginia, where he read law under the tutelage of his relative Judge Edmund Pendleton (descendant of the patriot Edmund Pendleton, who sat on the Virginia Court of Appeals). Kennedy would later often allude to genteel life on Southern plantations based on his youthful summers in Martinsburg. Later, Kennedy inherited some money from a rich Philadelphia uncle, and in 1829 married Elizabeth Gray, whose father Edward Gray was a wealthy mill-owner with a country house on the Patapsco River below Ellicott&#x27;s Mills, and whose monetary generosity would allow Kennedy to effectively withdraw from his law practice for a decade to write.

==Literary life==
Although admitted to the bar in 1816, he was much more interested in literature and politics than law. He associated with the focal point of Baltimore&#x27;s literary community, the Delphian Club. Kennedy&#x27;s first literary attempt was a fortnightly periodical called the &quot;Red Book&quot;, published anonymously with his roommate Peter Hoffman Cruse from 1819 to 1820. Kennedy published &quot;Swallow Barn, or A Sojourn in the Old Dominion&quot; in 1832, which would become his best-known work. &quot;Horse-Shoe Robinson&quot; was published in 1835 to win a permanent place of respect in the history of American fiction.
Kennedy&#x27;s friends and personal associates included George Henry Calvert, James Fenimore Cooper, Charles Dickens, Washington Irving, Edgar Allan Poe, William Gilmore Simms, and William Makepeace Thackeray.
Kennedy&#x27;s journal entries dated September 1858 state that Thackeray asked him for assistance with a chapter in &quot;The Virginians&quot;; Kennedy then assisted him by contributing scenic written depictions to that chapter.

While sitting round a back parlor table at the home of noted Baltimore literarist, civic leader and friend John H. B. Latrobe at 11 West Mulberry Street, across from the old Baltimore Cathedral in the Mount Vernon, Baltimore neighborhood in October 1833, imbibing some spirits and genial conversation with another friend James H. Miller, they together judged the draft of &quot;MS. Found in a Bottle&quot; from a then-unknown aspiring writer Edgar Allan Poe to be worthy of publishing in the &quot;Baltimore Sunday Visitor&quot; because of its dark and macabre atmosphere. Also in 1835, he helped later introduce Poe to Thomas Willis White, editor of the &quot;Southern Literary Messenger&quot;.

While abroad, Kennedy became a friend of William Makepeace Thackeray and wrote or outlined the fourth chapter of the second volume of &quot;The Virginians&quot;, a fact which accounts for the great accuracy of its scenic descriptions. Of his works, &quot;Horse-Shoe Robinson&quot; is the best and ranks high in antebellum fiction. Washington Irving read an advance copy of it and reported he was &quot;so tickled with some parts of it&quot; that he read it aloud to his friends. Kennedy sometimes wrote under the pen name &#x27;Mark Littleton&#x27;, especially in his political satires.

==Lawyer and politician==
Kennedy enjoyed politics more than law (although the Union Bank was a prime client), and left the Democratic Party when he realized that under President Andrew Jackson it came to oppose internal improvements. He thus became an active Whig like his father-in-law and favored Baltimore&#x27;s commercial interests. He was appointed Secretary of the Legation in Chile on January 27, 1823, but did not proceed to his post, instead resigning on June 23 of the same year. He was elected to the Maryland House of Delegates in 1820 and chaired its committee on internal improvements, championing the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal so vigorously (despite its failure to pay dividends), that he failed to win re-election after his 1823 vote for state support.

In 1838, Kennedy succeeded Isaac McKim in the U.S. House of Representatives, but was defeated in his bid for reelection in November of that year. Meanwhile, in 1835, Kennedy was among the 10 Baltimoreans who attended a railroad meeting in Brownsville, Pennsylvania, where he delivered a very well-received address urging completion of the B&amp;O Railroad to the Ohio River valley (rather than to Pennsylvania canals, which fed Philadelphia rather than Baltimore). Kennedy was also on the 25-man committee that lobbied the Maryland legislature on the B&amp;O&#x27;s behalf and ultimately secured passage of the &quot;Eight Million Dollar Bill&quot; in 1836, which led to his becoming a B&amp;O board member the following year (and remained such for many years). When the B&amp;O chose a route westward through Virginia rather than the mountains near Hagerstown, Maryland in 1838, Kennedy was in the B&amp;O&#x27;s delegation to lobby Virginia&#x27;s legislature (together with B&amp;O President Louis McLane and well-connected Maryland delegate John Spear Nicholas, son of Judge Philip Norborne Nicholas, a leader of the Richmond Junto) that secured passage of a law authorizing a $1,058,000 (~$ in ) subscription (40% of the estimated cost for building the B&amp;O through the state). However, the B&amp;O&#x27;s shareholders would reject the necessary Wheeling subscription because of its onerous terms, and Kennedy would again take up his pen in the B&amp;O&#x27;s defense against criticism by Maryland Governor William Grason.

Kennedy won re-election to Congress in 1840 and 1842; but, because of his strong opposition to the annexation of Texas, he was defeated in 1844. His influence in Congress was largely responsible for the appropriation of $30,000 to test Samuel Morse&#x27;s telegraph. In 1847, Kennedy became speaker of the Maryland House of Delegates, and used his influence to help the B&amp;O, although by the late 1840s it was caught in a three-way controversy with the states of Pennsylvania and Virginia as to whether the B&amp;O&#x27;s terminus should be Wheeling, Parkersburg or Pittsburgh. After an acrimonious shareholders meeting on August 25, 1847, the B&amp;O affirmed Wheeling as its terminus, and finally completed track to the city in 1853.

Meanwhile, President Millard Fillmore appointed Kennedy as Secretary of the Navy in July 1852. During Kennedy&#x27;s tenure in office, the Navy organized four important naval expeditions including that which sent Commodore Matthew C. Perry to Japan and Lieutenant William Lewis Herndon and Lieutenant Lardner Gibbon to explore the Amazon.
Kennedy was proposed as a vice-presidential running mate to Abraham Lincoln when Lincoln first sought the Presidency of the United States, although Kennedy was ultimately not selected. Kennedy became a forceful supporter of the Union during the Civil War, and he supported the passage of the Emancipation Proclamation. Later, since the proclamation did not free Maryland slaves because the state was not in rebellion, he also used his influence to push for legislation in Maryland that ultimately ended slavery there in 1864.

In 1853, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.

==Position on religious tolerance==

Kennedy called for erecting a monument to the founding of the state of Maryland and to the birth of religious freedom in its original colonial settlement in St. Mary&#x27;s City, Maryland. Three local citizens then expanded on his idea and sought to start a school that would become a &quot;Living Monument&quot; to religious freedom. The school was founded as such a monument in 1840 by order of the state legislature. Its original name was St. Mary&#x27;s Seminary, but it would later be known as St. Mary&#x27;s College of Maryland.

Earlier, when he was in the Maryland state legislature, Kennedy was instrumental in repealing a law that discriminated against Jewish people in court and trial procedures in Maryland. Jewish people were a tiny population in the state at the time and Kennedy was not Jewish, so there was no political or personal advantage to his position. His opposition to slavery in Maryland can be traced back for decades but the depth of that opposition went through an evolution from mild and more economically based in the beginning, to being stronger and more morally based by the time of the Emancipation Proclamation. Kennedy, an Episcopalian, also helped to lead private charitable efforts to aid Irish Catholic immigrants, who were experiencing a great deal of discrimination in the state at the time. However, he did also advocate setting limits on overall foreign national immigration into Maryland beginning in the 1850s, stating that he felt that the sheer number of new immigrants might overwhelm the economy.

==Opposition to slavery==
Kennedy&#x27;s opposition to slavery was first publicly expressed in his writings and later in his life as a politician through his speeches and political initiatives. His opposition to slavery in Maryland can be traced back through many decades of his life, but the depth of that opposition went through an evolution from milder and more understated in the beginning, to being stronger, more vocal and more morally based by the time of the Emancipation Proclamation and then the following state-level effort to end slavery in Maryland, as the state was not included in the Emancipation Proclamation because it was not in the Confederacy.

Kennedy once wrote that witnessing a speech by Frederick Douglass had opened his eyes more fully to the &quot;curse&quot; of slavery, as Kennedy called it by 1863.

Kennedy&#x27;s 1830s novel &quot;Swallow Barn&quot; is critical of slavery but also idealizes plantation life. However, the original manuscript shows that some of Kennedy&#x27;s initial descriptions of plantation life were much more critical of slavery, but that he crossed those out of the manuscript before the book went to the printer, possibly because he was afraid of being too openly critical of slavery while living in Maryland, a slave state.

Historians are not in consensus as to whether his earlier softer opposition to slavery was a way of preventing violent attacks against himself, since he lived in a border state where slavery was still practiced and still widely supported. Outright abolitionism at that time would have been an unpopular and potentially dangerous position in pro-slavery Maryland. Other historians maintain that his views on slavery simply evolved from weaker opposition to stronger opposition.

The novel, although more muted in its criticism of slavery by the time of its publication and also expressing some idyllic stereotypes about plantation life, leads to the prediction that slavery would bring the Southern states to ruin. &quot;Swallow Barn&quot; was published in 1832, 29 years before the start of the Civil War and long before anyone else was known to predict that the Southern and Northern states were headed for armed conflict.

===Civil War===
Just prior to the Civil War, Kennedy wrote that abolishing slavery immediately was not worth full-scale civil war and that slavery should instead be ended in stages to avoid war. He noted that civil wars were historically the most bloody and devastating kinds of warfare and suggested a negotiated, phased approach to ending slavery to prevent war between the sections.

But after the war broke out, he returned to a position of outright opposition to slavery and began to call for &quot;immediate emancipation&quot; of slaves. His demands for the end of slavery grew stronger as the war progressed. By the height of the Civil War, when Kennedy&#x27;s opposition to slavery had become much stronger, he signed his name to a key political pamphlet in Maryland opposing slavery and calling for its immediate end.

There is consensus among historians that Kennedy was critical of slavery to some degree for decades, strongly opposed to slavery by the height of the Civil War, and strongly opposed the Confederacy. In Maryland state politics and charity leadership, Kennedy was also known to help other minority groups, notably Jews and Irish Catholics. When the Emancipation Proclamation did not end slavery in Maryland, Kennedy played a key leadership role in campaigning for the end of slavery in the state.
Because Maryland was not in the Confederacy, the Emancipation Proclamation did not apply to the state and slavery continued there. Since there was no active insurrection in Maryland, President Lincoln did not feel constitutionally authorized to extend the Emancipation Proclamation to Maryland. Only the state itself could end slavery at this point, and this was not a certain outcome as Maryland was a slave state with strong Confederate sympathies. John Pendleton Kennedy and other antislavery leaders, therefore, organized a political gathering. On December 16, 1863, a special meeting of the Central Committee of the Union Party of Maryland was called on the issue of slavery in the state.

At the meeting, Thomas Swann, a state politician, put forward a motion calling for the party to work for &quot;Immediate emancipation (of all slaves) in Maryland&quot;. John Pendleton Kennedy spoke next and seconded the motion. Since Kennedy was the former speaker of the Maryland General Assembly, as well as a respected author, his support carried enormous weight in the party. A vote was taken and the motion passed. However the people of Maryland as a whole were by then divided on the issue and so twelve months of campaigning and lobbying on the matter of slavery continued throughout the state. During this effort, Kennedy signed his name to a party pamphlet calling for &quot;immediate emancipation&quot; of all slaves that was widely circulated. On November 1, 1864, after a year-long debate, a state referendum was put forth on the slavery question. The citizens of Maryland voted to abolish slavery, though only by a 1,000 vote margin, as the Southern part of the state remained heavily dependent on the slave economy.

==Work with cultural and educational institutions==
Kennedy, in his close association with George Peabody, was instrumental in the establishment of the Peabody Institute, which later evolved and split into the Peabody Library and the Peabody Conservatory of Music, which are now both part of Johns Hopkins University. He also served on the first board of trustees for the institute and did the first writing that outlined its mission. He also recorded minutes for the board&#x27;s earliest meetings. Kennedy is known to have worked for years to help lay the groundwork for these institutions.

Kennedy also played an essential but unintended role in the establishment of St. Mary&#x27;s Female Seminary which is now known as St. Mary&#x27;s College of Maryland, the state&#x27;s public honors college. Kennedy&#x27;s used his reputation as a respected Maryland politician and author, to call for designating St. Mary&#x27;s City as the state&#x27;s &quot;Living Monument to religious freedom&quot;, memorializing its location on the site of Maryland&#x27;s first colony, which was also considered to be the birthplace of religious freedom in America as well. A few years later three local citizens refined his idea into calling for a school in St. Mary&#x27;s City that would be the &quot;Living monument&quot;. The school continues to have this designation to this day.

Kennedy was the primary initial impetus and was also pivotal in gaining early state recognition of its responsibility for protecting, studying and memorializing St. Mary&#x27;s City, Maryland (the then-abandoned site of Maryland&#x27;s first colony and capitol, as well as being the birthplace of religious freedom in America), as a key state historic area, placing historical research and preservation mandates under the original auspices of the new state-sponsored St. Mary&#x27;s Female Seminary, located on the same site. This planted the early seeds of what would eventually become Historic St. Mary&#x27;s City, a state-run archeological research and historic interpretation area that exists today on the site of Maryland&#x27;s original colonial settlement.

Historic St. Mary&#x27;s City also co-runs (jointly with St. Mary&#x27;s College of Maryland) the now internationally recognized Historical Archaeology Field School, a descendant of Kennedy&#x27;s idea that a school should be involved in researching and preserving the remains of colonial St. Mary&#x27;s City.

During his term as U.S. Secretary of the Navy, Kennedy made the request for the establishment of the United States Naval Academy Band in Annapolis in 1852. The band continues to be active to this day.

==Roles in science and technology==

===Federal study and acceptance of the telegraph===

While serving in the United States Congress, John Pendleton Kennedy was the primary and decisive force in Congress in securing $30,000 (an enormous sum at the time) for testing Samuel Morse&#x27;s telegraph communications system. This was the first electronic means of long-distance communication in human history. The government tests corroborated Morse&#x27;s invention and led to federal adoption of the technology and the subsequent establishment of the American telegraph communications system, which revolutionized communications and the economic development of the United States. Federal acceptance of the telegraph had a major impact on Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s management of the Civil War as well.

===Commissioner of the 1867 Paris Exposition===

Kennedy was a commissioner of the 1867 Paris Exposition, an international science, technology and arts fair that was held in Paris, France, in 1867. The fair had participation from 42 nations and had over 50,000 exhibits. It was the second World&#x27;s Fair.

==Retirement from public office==
Kennedy retired from elected and appointed offices in March 1853 when President Fillmore left office, but he remained very active in both Federal and state of Maryland politics, supporting Fillmore in 1856, when Fillmore won Maryland&#x27;s electoral votes and Kennedy&#x27;s brother Anthony won a U.S. Senate seat. His name was mentioned as one of the vice-presidential prospects on the Republican ticket alongside Abraham Lincoln in 1860. Instead, Kennedy was the Maryland chairman of the Constitutional Union Party, which nominated John Bell and Edward Everett for the Presidency. Kennedy played an instrumental leadership role in the Union Party&#x27;s successful effort to end slavery in Maryland in 1864. This had to be done at the state level because the Emancipation Proclamation did not apply to the state. At the end of the American Civil War – during which he forcefully supported the Union – he advocated amnesty for former rebels.

During this time, he had a summer home overlooking the south branch of the Patapsco River upstream near Orange Grove-Avalon-Ilchester off the main western line of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad now in the area of Patapsco Valley State Park, which was devastated by a disastrous flood in 1868.

Kennedy died in Newport, Rhode Island, on August 18, 1870, and is buried in Greenmount Cemetery in Baltimore, Maryland.

==Legacy==
In his will, Kennedy wrote the following:

It is my wish that the manuscript volumes containing my journals, my note or common-place books, and the several volumes of my own letters in press copy, as also all my other letters, such as may possess any interest or value (which I desire to be bound in volumes) that are now in loose sheets, shall be returned to my executors, who are requested to have the same packed away in a strong walnut box, closed and locked, and then delivered to the Peabody Institute, to be preserved by them unopened until the year 1900, when the same shall become the property of the Institute, to be kept among its books and records.

Today there are two large special collections of his papers, manuscripts and correspondence; one remains at the Peabody Institute in Baltimore and the other is at the Enoch Pratt Free Library in Baltimore. There are also a number of libraries from Virginia to Boston that have smaller collections of his correspondence (both private and official letters).

The naval ships USS &quot;John P. Kennedy&quot; and USS &quot;Kennedy&quot; (DD-306) were named for him.

<text>In computing, codice_1 (or codice_2) is a command which will remove an empty directory on various operating systems.

==Implementations==
The command is available in Unix (e.g. macOS, Solaris, AIX, HP-UX), Unix-like (e.g. FreeBSD, Linux), DOS, Digital Research FlexOS, IBM OS/2, Microsoft Windows or ReactOS operating systems. On MS-DOS, the command is available in versions 2 and later. DR DOS 6.0 also includes an implementation of the command.

It is also available in the open source MS-DOS emulator DOSBox and in KolibriOS. The numerical computing environments MATLAB and GNU Octave include an codice_1 
function with similar functionality.

==Usage==
===Unix, Unix-like===
Normal usage is straightforward:
$ rmdir name_of_directory
where name_of_directory corresponds with the name of the directory one wishes to delete. There are options to this command such as -p in Unix which removes parent directories if they are also empty.

For example:
$ rmdir -p foo/bar/baz
will first remove baz/, then bar/ and finally foo/ thus removing the entire directory tree specified in the command argument.

rmdir will not remove a directory if it is not empty in UNIX. The  command will remove a directory and all its contents recursively. For example:
$ rm -r foo/bar/baz
$ rm -rf foo/bar/baz
===DOS, OS/2, Windows, ReactOS===

Normal usage is identical to Unix-like operating systems:
&gt;rmdir name_of_directory
The equivalent command in MS-DOS and earlier (non-NT-based) versions of Microsoft Windows for deleting non-empty directories is .

In later version of Windows:
&gt;rd /s directory_name
Windows based on the NT kernel (XP, Vista, 7, 8, Server 2003/2008) are case insensitive, just like their earlier predecessors, unless two files of the same name and different case exist. Then case sensitivity applies when selecting which file to use, or if the case does not match either file, one may be chosen by Windows.

Having two files named the same with different case sensitivity is allowed either when Windows Services for Unix is installed or when the Windows Registry settings are set to allow it.

An example of the security risk is:

Using rd/rmdir and two directories with the same name and different case sensitivities exist, one of which contains valid data and/or programs, and the other contains incriminating materials and/or malware. If rd/rmdir gets executed without regard to case sensitivity and Windows chooses the legitimate folder to delete, the only folder left is the undesired one. Windows then uses this folder instead of the previously legitimate one to execute programs, and one may be led to believe it contains legitimate data.

<doc id="380949" wikidata="Q2185565" url="?curid=380949" title="Paul Shane">
<text>Paul Shane (19 June 1940 – 16 May 2013) was a British actor and comedian. He was known for his television work, in particular for playing Ted Bovis in the 1980s BBC sitcom &quot;Hi-de-Hi!&quot;.

==Early life==
Shane was born on 19 June 1940 as George Frederick Speight, in Thrybergh, near Rotherham, in the West Riding of Yorkshire. After leaving school in 1955, he was a miner at Silverwood Colliery until he suffered double herniated discs after slipping on soap in the pithead baths in 1967, being pensioned from the coal mines as a result. Two years later he became a professional entertainer. He already had ten years&#x27; experience as a part-time entertainer in pubs and clubs in south Yorkshire.

==Career==
Shane&#x27;s first appearance, as a singer, was at the Grafton pub — now demolished — in St Ann&#x27;s Road, Rotherham. His first club booking was at St Ann&#x27;s Club in Rotherham, for 30 shillings. His transformation from singer to comedian was gradual, starting with his version of &quot;Green, Green Grass of Home&quot;, which was straight at first, but ultimately became a send-up of the version by Tom Jones.

Shane played small parts and made guest appearances in television series throughout the 1970s. In May 1979, the comedy writer Jimmy Perry spotted Shane playing Frank Roper in an episode of &quot;Coronation Street&quot; and offered him the part of Ted Bovis in his new holiday-camp sitcom &quot;Hi-de-Hi!&quot;. The series ran from 1980 until 1988, when Perry and his co-writer David Croft wrote the pilot of &quot;You Rang, M&#x27;Lord?&quot; and invited Shane to play Alf Stokes. That show ran until 1993.

In 1991, Shane was given his own show, &quot;Very Big Very Soon&quot;, which ran for one series.

Shane&#x27;s performance of &quot;You&#x27;ve Lost That Lovin&#x27; Feeling&quot; on &quot;Pebble Mill at One&quot; in 1996 was voted the 72nd-funniest moment on British television in an opinion poll on Channel 4 in 2004.

Between 1995 and 1997, Shane played Jack Skinner in two series of &quot;Oh, Doctor Beeching!&quot;. Subsequently, he appeared most frequently in theatre, though he also had guest spots in &quot;Holby City&quot; and &quot;Emmerdale&quot; on television.

Shane also appeared in variety theatre in towns including Blackpool in 2006, and in pantomime in &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot; in 2008. In 2008, he was in an episode of the ITV drama series &quot;A Touch of Frost&quot;, playing boatsman &quot;Diesel Bob&quot;. He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1981, when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews in London&#x27;s Covent Garden.

==Personal life and death==
Shane was married to Dorothy Shortt (born 28 February 1943) from 1961 until her death on 4 April 2001 aged 58. They had three daughters.

On 1 April 1984, he was inducted into the Grand Order of Water Rats.

In May 2009, Shane was admitted to the Northern General Hospital in Sheffield for heart surgery and made a full recovery.

Following another short period of ill-health, he died on 16 May 2013 in a Rotherham hospice, aged 72. His funeral was held on 31 May 2013 at Rotherham Minster.

<doc id="380957" wikidata="Q781206" url="?curid=380957" title="Charmides (dialogue)">
<text>The Charmides (; ) is a dialogue of Plato, in which Socrates engages a handsome and popular boy named Charmides in a conversation about the meaning of &quot;sophrosyne&quot;, a Greek word usually translated into English as &quot;temperance,&quot; &quot;self-control,&quot; or &quot;restraint.&quot; When the boy is unable to satisfy him with an answer, he next turns to the boy&#x27;s mentor Critias. In the dialogue, Charmides and then later Critias champion that Temperance is &quot;doing one&#x27;s own work&quot; but Socrates derides this as vague. The definition given next of &quot;knowing oneself&quot; seems promising but the question is then raised if something can even have the knowledge of itself as a base. As is typical with Platonic early dialogues, the two never arrive at a completely satisfactory definition, but the discussion nevertheless raises many important points. The &quot;Charmides&quot; is one of Plato&#x27;s most homoerotic dialogues. Socrates admires Charmides&#x27; beauty at the beginning of the dialogue, saying &quot;I saw inside his cloak and caught on fire and was quite beside myself.&quot;
==Characters==
*Socrates the Athenian philosopher
*Charmides, the son of &quot;Dropidas&quot;, a handsome young boy and wrestler famed for his beauty and temperance
*Critias, Charmides&#x27; uncle and the most cruel and bloodthirsty of the Thirty Tyrants. His connection to Socrates was one of the main charges of scandal against him in the &quot;Apology&quot;. This dialogue ultimately tests his views of temperance.
*Chaerephon, enthusiastic friend of Socrates and jokingly described as &quot;a kind of madman&quot;

== Setting==
Socrates narrates the dialogue, and says that he has just returned from a battle at Potidaea, a city besieged and conquered by the Athenians at the beginning of the Peloponnesian War. Socrates says that, shortly after returning home, he again sought out his habitual conversations by heading to the palaestra of Taureas, a wrestling school where boys gathered. With the help of Chaerephon, who pushes him for details about the battle, he finds his way to Critias and asks him about affairs at home, the present state of philosophy, and whether any of the boys had distinguished himself for wisdom or beauty, or both. Critias answers that Socrates will soon get to know the beauties firsthand, for Charmides and his entourage have just arrived.

Critias tells Socrates that Charmides is his cousin, son of his uncle Glaucon. Chaerephon rushes over and asks Socrates if the boy is not beautiful, and Socrates agrees with a poetic quote from Cydias. Chaerephon says suggestively that if Socrates could see his naked form, he would forget all about his handsome face. Socrates says all this will be good and well if the boy also has a noble soul. Socrates tells Critias that before they look at his body, they will ask the boy to strip and show them his soul.

Charmides was Plato&#x27;s uncle, his mother&#x27;s brother. Critias, Socrates&#x27; other interlocutor, was Charmides&#x27; first cousin, making Plato Critias&#x27; first cousin once removed. Both Critias and Charmides went on to become important members of the Thirty Tyrants, the short-lived oligarchic regime that was established following Athenian defeat in the Peloponnesian War in 404 BCE, making the question of their &quot;sophrosyne&quot;, or moderation, alternatively ironic or pressing.

This is generally considered one of Plato&#x27;s earlier dialogues based on analysis of his writing and the fact that it ends in aporia. Some critics like Johann Gottfried Stallbaum traced the dialogue back to the period before the Thirty Tyrants&#x27; reign of tyranny over Athens, around 405 BC, while the majority bring it back much later, around 388, after the death of Socrates.

== Struggle to define ==
Socrates tells Critias that there would be no shame in his just talking to the beautiful and popular boy, even if he were younger than he is. Socrates informs the reader that Critias is the child&#x27;s guardian or caretaker (ἐπίτροπος, literally &quot;one to whom the charge of anything is entrusted&quot;) (155a). Critias agrees and tells an attendant to tell Charmides to come and see the physician (&quot;iatros&quot;) about an illness that Charmides has complained about. Critias suggests that Socrates pretend to know a cure for a headache to lure the boy over.

Charmides approaches and tells Socrates about his ailment. Socrates responds that he can find a cure he heard of from Zalmoxis but in order for the cure to work, the patient must have a good soul and possess temperance. Charmides is ashamed to reply that he has temperance as he feels it will make him look vain. Socrates asks him that first instead of answering if he has it that maybe they should provide a definition of what it is exactly. That way they can have a metric to judge the character of Charmides&#x27; temperance with.

Charmides first suggests that sophrosyne is a kind of quietness or slowness (159b). Socrates talks him out of this because quickness, energetic attitude and agility are more useful to learning than quietness or slowness. Next Charmides proposes that sophrosyne is the same as modesty. Socrates says this can&#x27;t be right because Homer (whose authority they both accept on this point) says that modesty is not good for all people, but it is agreed that sophrosyne is (160e). Charmides proposes that temperance is minding your own business. Socrates finds this particularly offensive, and tells Charmides that he must have heard this from some fool (162b). Socrates can tell from the uneasy look on Critias face that this was his idea, and they exchange some words. Critias accuses Charmides of misrepresenting him. Socrates says to him testily that at his age, Charmides can hardly be expected to understand temperance (162e). At this point in the argument, Critias takes up the argument with Socrates suggesting that temperance might be the same as self-knowledge. Socrates confesses as they discuss this that his motive in refuting Critias is to examine himself, that he pursues the argument for his own sake (166c-d).

Critias says that &quot;to work&quot; and &quot;to make&quot; are two completely different things and this is the basis for Socrates misunderstanding him. Critias quotes the authority of Hesiod who said &quot;no work is dishonorable.&quot; He says that you have to use context and the quote clearly means noble professions such as shoemaking and not ignoble ones such as prostitution. He says that Hesiod would agree with him that anyone who is good and follows his noble profession is temperate. Socrates responds by asking if those who do good always know they are doing good. Critias says temperate men can not be ignorant of their own temperance and Socrates rebukes him by mentioning that doctors or physicians can sometimes do good to both themselves and others without even knowing it. This definition is then discarded.

Critias next suggests temperance is self-knowledge. Socrates asks what product this knowledge makes and Critias says not all knowledge creates a product. Socrates finds this answer unreasonable. Critias&#x27; suggestion that sophrosyne is self-knowledge spurs Socrates to a discussion of the relation between medicine and science. He says that medicine is the science of health and disease, and that a person who does not understand these things is not in a position to distinguish a real physician from a quack (171c). He says that if wisdom is the science of knowing what you know and knowing what you don&#x27;t know, no one would ever make a mistake, and we would pass through life without erring. He concludes that this does not happen, therefore this definition of wisdom is inaccurate.

Socrates asks Critias what type of knowledge wisdom is. He suggests a prophet or sooth-sayer and Critias agrees. Socrates asks him by what knowledge do these people become wise. Is it the knowledge of fortune games? or of health? Critias responds in the negative and concludes to him it&#x27;s &quot;the knowledge of good and evil.&quot; Socrates likes this answer and says that knowledge of other things like health are useless unless you understand good from evil.

Socrates says he dreams, however, of a world in which no one pretends to be something he is not (173a-d). In the end, Socrates appears to have recruited a new disciple to philosophy: Charmides says he is willing to be charmed every day by Socrates, and Critias tells the boy that if he is willing to do this, he will have proof of his temperance. Charmides says that if his guardian instructs him to submit to Socrates&#x27; charms, then he would be wrong not to do it.

Socrates&#x27; analogy, that ignorance is to the philosopher what disease is to the physician, is important and persistent in the dialogues. And everywhere, Socrates fails to effect a cure. In the Protagoras, for example, when the sophist Prodicus accuses Socrates of making a mess of their discussion, Socrates accepts the complaint and calls himself a laughable doctor (&quot;geloios iatros&quot;), whose treatment not only does not cure the disease, it worsens it (Protagoras 340e).

A variation on the medical theme is in the Theaetetus, where Socrates compares himself to a midwife who helps boys and men give birth to their ideas. He says there that he (never having conceived of a viable idea himself) is barren, and has frequently had to commit the intellectual equivalent of infanticide (Theaetetus 160e).

<text>Admiral Sir Charles Howe Fremantle GCB (1 June 1800 – 25 May 1869) was a British Royal Navy officer. The city of Fremantle, Western Australia, is named after him.

==Early life==
Fremantle was the second son of Thomas Fremantle, an associate of Horatio Nelson, and of Fremantle&#x27;s wife Elizabeth, the diarist. His middle name, Howe, is derived from his date of birth: the anniversary of Lord Howe&#x27;s victory over the French on the Glorious First of June, 1794.

==Career==
Fremantle joined the Royal Navy in 1812 and worked his way up the ranks on a number of vessels. From 1818 to 1819 he served on his father&#x27;s flagship in the Mediterranean Fleet.

In 1824 Fremantle received the first gold gallantry medal of the new Royal National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck, later the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, for an attempted rescue at Whitepit near Christchurch, Dorset. 

In April 1826 Fremantle was charged with raping a 15-year-old girl. His family is said to have paid off witnesses and leant on the judiciary to avoid scandal. He then went on to groom 10 more girls under the age of 18, his family has denied all allegations.

===Swan River Colony===
In August 1826 Fremantle was promoted to captain and in 1828 took command of the 26-gun frigate , and sent to claim the west coast of Australia for the United Kingdom. &quot;Challenger&quot; was dispatched by the Admiralty from the Cape of Good Hope on 20 March 1829, anchored in Cockburn Sound on 27 April and landed on Garden Island the next day. On 2 May he hoisted the British flag on the south head of the mouth of the Swan River and took formal possession in the name of His Majesty King George IV of &quot;all that part of New Holland (Australia) which is not included within the territory of New South Wales.&quot;

The appointed Lieutenant Governor James Stirling arrived in Cockburn Sound, Western Australia, on 2 June, aboard the hired transport barque . He brought his family and other intending settlers, numbering 69, to found a colony at the Swan River. On 8 June they were joined by a military detachment of some 56 officers and men who disembarked from the consort ship . On 17 June, a proxy proclamation was read by Stirling confirming Fremantle&#x27;s earlier one. These immigrants, along with Frederick Town, the semi-exclave military outpost of New South Wales established two years earlier, began the history of Western Australia as a British colony, then as a state of federal Australia.

===Trincomalee===
Fremantle left the Swan River Colony on 28 August 1829, heading for the British base at Trincomalee, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), where he was based for a couple of years. While there he visited many locations, including Kowloon in China, which he recommended as a good site for a British settlement. The British government agreed and Hong Kong Island was settled in 1841.

On his way back to England from Ceylon, Fremantle in September 1832 visited the Swan River Colony for a week, but never returned. In 1833 he stopped at Pitcairn Island, where he tried to resolve a leadership dispute between Joshua Hill and George Hunn Nobbs. He was given command of in the Mediterranean Fleet in 1843 and of , also in the Mediterranean, in 1847. Then in 1853 he became Captain of on the Australia Station.

===Balaclava===
Fremantle served as Rear-Admiral controlling the naval transport service from Balaclava during the Crimean War. He went on to be Commander-in-Chief of the Channel Squadron in July 1858 and Commander-in-Chief, Plymouth in 1863.

==Family life==
Fremantle married Isabella Wedderburn on 8 October 1836. They had three children:
*Emily Caroline Alexander (14 April 1838 – 10 February 1929), who married Reverend C. L. Alexander, Rector of Sturton-by-Bridge, Derbyshire
*Celia Elizabeth McNeil (8 October 1840 – 15 February 1929), who married Canon E. A. McNeile, Vicar of St Paul&#x27;s, Princes Park, Liverpool
*Louisa Frances Fremantle (23 February 1843 – 20 March 1909)

Fremantle died in 1869 and is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London. The grave lies against the east wall, near a more prominent monument to the politician David Lyon.

<doc id="380965" wikidata="Q43135" url="?curid=380965" title="Kevin Rudd">
<text>Kevin Michael Rudd (born 21 September 1957) is an Australian diplomat and politician who served as the 26th prime minister of Australia from 2007 to 2010 and June to September 2013. He held office as the leader of the Labor Party and was the member of parliament (MP) for the Queensland division of Griffith from 1998 to 2013. Since 2023, Rudd has been the 23rd ambassador of Australia to the United States.

Born in Nambour, Queensland, Rudd graduated from the Australian National University with honours in Chinese studies, and is fluent in Mandarin. Before politics, he worked as a diplomat and public servant for the Queensland state government of Wayne Goss. Rudd was elected to the Australian House of Representatives at the 1998 federal election, as (MP) for Griffith. Promoted to the shadow cabinet in 2001 as Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, he assumed leadership of the Labor Party in December 2006 by defeating Kim Beazley in a leadership spill, becoming leader of the opposition. Rudd led Labor to a landslide victory at the 2007 election; his government&#x27;s earliest acts included ratifying the Kyoto Protocol on climate change and delivering the first national apology to Australia&#x27;s Indigenous peoples for the Stolen Generations. His government responded to the 2007–2008 financial crisis, implementing economic stimulus packages that resulted in Australia becoming one of the only developed countries to avoid the Great Recession. Rudd&#x27;s government also oversaw the establishment of the National Broadband Network (NBN), the launch of the Digital Education Revolution and Building the Education Revolution programs, dismantling WorkChoices, and withdrew Australian troops from the Iraq War.

By 2010, Rudd&#x27;s leadership had faltered due to a loss of support among the Labor caucus and failure to pass key legislation like the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. He resigned as prime minister in June 2010 after his deputy Julia Gillard challenged him in a leadership spill. He was replaced by Gillard as prime minister, who later appointed him as Minister for Foreign Affairs in her government. Leadership tensions between Rudd and Gillard continued, leading to Rudd resigning as Foreign Minister in February 2012 to unsuccessfully challenge her for the leadership of the party. After further leadership speculation, Rudd defeated Gillard in a final leadership ballot in June 2013, becoming prime minister for the second time. However, Labor were defeated in the 2013 election, ending his second term after only two months.

Rudd retired from parliament following the election, but he has stayed active in political discourse and academia, completing a DPhil at Jesus College, Oxford, in 2022. He has been involved in a number of international organizations, advocating for issues such as China–United States relations and Australian media diversity. He was appointed as Australia&#x27;s Ambassador to the U.S. by the Albanese government in March 2023.

==Early life and education==
Rudd is of English and Irish descent. His father&#x27;s great-grandparents were English: Thomas Rudd and Mary Cable. Thomas had been convicted of stealing a bag of sugar, arriving in NSW on board the &quot;Earl Cornwallis&quot; in 1801. Mary had been sentenced to transportation for stealing a bolt of cloth, arriving in the colony in 1804. His mother&#x27;s grandparents, Owen Cashin and Hannah Maher, who were both born in Ireland, met and married in Brisbane in 1887.

Rudd was born in Nambour, Queensland, to Albert (&quot;Bert&quot;) and Margaret (née DeVere) Rudd, the youngest son of four children, and grew up on a dairy farm in nearby Eumundi. At an early age (5–7), he contracted rheumatic fever and spent a considerable time at home convalescing. It damaged his heart, in particular the valves, for which he has thus far had two aortic valve replacement surgeries, but this was discovered only some 12 years later. Farm life, which required the use of horses and guns, is where he developed his lifelong love of horse riding and shooting clay targets. He attended Eumundi State School.

When Rudd was 11, his father, a share farmer and Country Party member, died. Rudd states that the family was required to leave the farm amidst financial difficulty between two and three weeks after the death, though the family of the landowner states that the Rudds didn&#x27;t have to leave for almost six months. Following this traumatic childhood and despite familial connections with the Country Party, Rudd joined the Australian Labor Party in 1972 at the age of 15.

Rudd boarded at Marist College Ashgrove in Brisbane, although these years were not happy due to the indignity of poverty and reliance on charity; he was known to be a &quot;charity case&quot; due to his father&#x27;s sudden death. He has since described the school as &quot;tough, harsh, unforgiving, institutional Catholicism of the old school&quot;. Two years later, after she retrained as a nurse, Rudd&#x27;s mother moved the family to Nambour, and Rudd rebuilt his standing through study and scholastic application and was dux of Nambour State High School in 1974. In that year, he was also the state winner of the &quot;Youth Speaks for Australia&quot; public speaking competition sponsored by the Jaycees. His future Treasurer Wayne Swan attended the same school at the same time, although they did not know each other as Swan was three years ahead.

Rudd studied at the Australian National University in Canberra, where he resided at Burgmann College and graduated with Bachelor of Arts (Asian Studies) with First-Class Honours. He majored in Chinese language and Chinese history, and became proficient in Mandarin. His Chinese name is Lù Kèwén (). Rudd completed his BA in 1978, deferring his honours component for a year during which time he took a study trip to Taiwan. He also volunteered as a research assistant with the Zadok Institute for Christianity and at a St Vincent de Paul drug rehabilitation centre.

Rudd&#x27;s thesis on Chinese democracy activist Wei Jingsheng was supervised by Pierre Ryckmans, the eminent Belgian-Australian sinologist. During his studies, Rudd did housecleaning for political commentator Laurie Oakes to earn extra money. In 1980 he continued his Chinese studies at the Mandarin Training Center of National Taiwan Normal University in Taipei, Taiwan. Delivering the 2008 Gough Whitlam Lecture at the University of Sydney on &quot;The Reforming Centre of Australian Politics&quot;, Rudd praised the former Labor Prime Minister for implementing educational reforms, saying he was:... a kid who lived Gough Whitlam&#x27;s dream that every child should have a desk with a lamp on it where he or she could study. A kid whose mum told him after the 1972 election that it might just now be possible for the likes of him to go to university. A kid from the country of no particular means and of no political pedigree who could therefore dream that one day he could make a contribution to our national political life.

==Diplomatic career==
Rudd joined the Department of Foreign Affairs in 1981 as a graduate trainee. His first posting was as Third Secretary at the Australian Embassy in Stockholm from November 1981 to December 1983 where he organised an Australian film festival, represented Australia at the Stockholm Conference on Acidification of the Environment, and reported on Soviet gas pipelines and European energy security. In 1984, Rudd was appointed Second Secretary at the Australian Embassy in Beijing, and promoted to First Secretary in 1985, where he was responsible for analysing Politburo politics, economic reform, arms control and human rights under Ross Garnaut, David Irvine and Geoff Raby. He returned to Canberra in 1987 and was assigned to the Policy Planning Branch, then the Staffing Policy Section, and was selected to serve as the Office of National Assessments Liaison Officer at the Australian High Commission in London commencing in 1989 but declined.

==Entry into politics==
In 1988, he was appointed Chief of Staff to the Opposition Leader in Queensland, Wayne Goss. He remained in that role when Goss was elected Premier in 1989, a position he held until 1992 when Goss appointed him Director-General of the Office of Cabinet. In this position, Rudd was arguably Queensland&#x27;s most powerful bureaucrat. He presided over a number of reforms, including development of a national program for teaching foreign languages in schools. Rudd was influential in both promoting a policy of developing an Asian languages and cultures program which was unanimously accepted by the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) in 1992 and later chaired a high-level working group which provided the foundation of the strategy in its report, which is frequently cited as &quot;the Rudd Report&quot;.

The Goss Government saw its majority slashed in 1995, before losing it altogether after a by-election one year later. After Goss&#x27; resignation, Rudd left the Queensland Government and was hired as a Senior China Consultant by the accounting firm KPMG Australia. While in that position, he won selection to be the Labor candidate for the seat of Griffith at the 1996 federal election. Despite being endorsed by the retiring Labor MP, Ben Humphreys, Rudd was considerably hampered by Labor&#x27;s unpopularity in Queensland, as well as a redistribution that almost halved Labor&#x27;s majority. Rudd was defeated by Liberal Graeme McDougall on the eighth count as Labor won only two seats in Queensland. Rudd stood in the same seat against McDougall in the 1998 election, this time winning on the fifth count.

==Member of Parliament (1998–2007)==

Rudd made his maiden speech to the House of Representatives as the new Member for the Division of Griffith on 11 November 1998. It drew heavily his personal experience of poverty to argue for the need for strong social security, public hospitals, and public housing.

===Shadow Minister (2001–2006)===
Following Labor&#x27;s defeat in the 2001 federal election, Rudd was promoted to the Shadow Cabinet and appointed Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs. In 2002, he met with British intelligence and helped define the position that Labor would take in regards to the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

There is no debate or dispute as to whether Saddam Hussein possesses weapons of mass destruction. He does. There&#x27;s no dispute as whether he&#x27;s in violation of UN Security Council resolutions. He is.

After the fall of Saddam Hussein he would criticise the Howard government over its support for the United States, while maintaining Labor&#x27;s position of support for the Australian-American alliance.

Well, what Secretary Powell and the US seems to have said is that he now has grave doubts about the accuracy of the case he put to the United Nations about the claim that Iraq possessed biological weapons laboratories – the so-called mobile trailers. And here in Australia, that formed also part of the government&#x27;s argument on the war. I think what it does is it adds to the fabric of how the Australian people were misled about the reasons for going to war.

Rudd&#x27;s policy experience and parliamentary performances during the Iraq War made him one of the best-known Labor members. When Labor Leader Simon Crean was challenged by his predecessor Kim Beazley, Rudd did not publicly commit himself to either candidate. When Crean resigned, Rudd was considered a possible candidate for the Labor leadership, however he announced that he would not run in the leadership ballot, and would instead vote for Kim Beazley.

Rudd was predicted by some commentators to be demoted or moved as a result of his support for Beazley following the election of Mark Latham as Leader, but he retained his portfolio. Relations between Latham and Rudd deteriorated during 2004, especially after Latham made his pledge to withdraw all Australian forces from Iraq by Christmas 2004 without consulting Rudd. After Latham failed to win the 2004 federal election, Rudd was again spoken of as a possible alternative leader, although he disavowed any intention of challenging Latham.

When Latham suddenly resigned in January 2005, Rudd was in Indonesia and refused to say whether he would be a candidate for the Labor leadership. After returning from Indonesia, Rudd announced that he would again not contest the leadership, and Beazley was subsequently elected unopposed. Following this, Rudd was given expanded responsibilities in the Shadow Cabinet, retaining his role as Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs and also becoming the Shadow Minister for Trade.

===Leader of the Opposition (2006–2007)===

Following opinion polls indicating that voter support for Rudd as Labor Leader was higher than for Beazley, speculation mounted that Rudd would challenge Beazley for the leadership. One particular poll in November 2006 indicated that support for Labor would double if Rudd was to become Leader. On 1 December 2006, Beazley called a leadership election. Rudd announced his candidacy for the leadership hours later. On 4 December, Rudd was elected Leader of the Labor Party and Leader of the Opposition with 49 votes to Beazley&#x27;s 39. Julia Gillard was subsequently elected unopposed as Deputy Leader after Jenny Macklin resigned.

At his first press conference as Labor Leader, having thanked Beazley and Macklin, Rudd said he would offer a &quot;new style of leadership&quot; and would be an &quot;alternative, not just an echo&quot; of the Howard government. He outlined the areas of industrial relations, the war in Iraq, climate change, Australian federalism, social justice and the future of Australia&#x27;s manufacturing industry as major policy concerns. Rudd also stressed his long experience in state government and also as a diplomat and in business before entering federal politics.

Rudd and the Labor Party soon overtook the Howard government in both party and leadership polling. Rudd maintained a high media profile with major announcements on an &quot;education revolution&quot;, federalism, climate change, a National Broadband Network, and the domestic car industry.

In March 2007, the government raised questions over a series of meetings Rudd had had with former West Australian Labor Premier Brian Burke during 2005, alleging that Rudd had been attempting to use Burke&#x27;s influence to become Labor leader (after losing office, Burke had spent time in prison before returning to politics as a lobbyist). Rudd said that this had not been the purpose of the three meetings and said that they had been arranged by his colleague Graham Edwards, the Member for Cowan.

From 2002, Rudd appeared regularly in interviews and topical discussions on the popular breakfast television program &quot;Sunrise&quot;, along with Liberal MP Joe Hockey. This was credited with helping to raise Rudd&#x27;s public profile even further. Rudd and Hockey ended their joint appearances in April 2007, citing the increasing political pressures of an election year.

On 19 August 2007, it was revealed that Rudd, while on a visit to New York City as Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, had visited a strip club in September 2003, with &quot;New York Post&quot; editor Col Allan and Labor MP Warren Snowdon. By way of explanation, Rudd said: &quot;I had had too much to drink, I have no recollection, and nor does Mr Snowdon, of any incident occurring at the nightclub – or of being asked to leave...it is our recollection that we left within about an hour&quot;. The incident generated a lot of media coverage, but made no impact on Rudd&#x27;s popularity in the polls. Some believe the incident may have enabled Rudd to appear &quot;more human&quot; and lifted his popularity.

====2007 election====
Electoral writs were issued for the 2007 federal election on 17 October 2007. On 21 October, Rudd faced incumbent Prime Minister John Howard in a television debate, where he was judged by most media analysts to have performed strongly.

On 14 November, Rudd officially launched the Labor Party&#x27;s election campaign with a policy of fiscal restraint, usually considered the electoral strength of the opposing Liberal Party. Rudd proposed Labor spending measures totalling $2.3 billion, contrasting them to $9.4 billion Rudd claimed the Liberals had promised, declaring: &quot;Today, I am saying loud and clear that this sort of reckless spending must stop.&quot;

The election was held on 24 November, and was won overwhelmingly by Labor. The result was dubbed a &#x27;Ruddslide&#x27; by the media and was underpinned by the considerable support from Rudd&#x27;s home state of Queensland, with the state result recording a two-party preferred swing of 7.53%. The overall swing was 5.44% from the Liberals to Labor, the third largest swing at a federal election since two party estimates began in 1949.

As foreshadowed during the election campaign, on 29 November Rudd announced the members of his Government (see First Rudd Ministry), breaking with more than a century of Labor tradition whereby the frontbench was elected by the Labor caucus, with the leader then given the right to allocate portfolios.

==First term as Prime Minister (2007–2010)==

On 3 December 2007, Rudd was sworn in as the 26th prime minister of Australia by governor-general Michael Jeffery. Rudd was the first Labor Prime Minister since Paul Keating left office in 1996, and the first to make no mention of the monarch when taking his oath of office. He also became only the second Queenslander to lead his party to a federal election victory (the first being Andrew Fisher in 1910) and was the first prime minister since the Second World War not to have come from either New South Wales or Victoria.

Early initiatives of the Rudd government included the signing of the Kyoto Protocol, a Parliamentary Apology to the Stolen Generations and the 2020 Summit in April 2008. Other achievements of the Rudd government included keeping Australia out of recession during the 2007–2008 financial crisis, commencing the rollout of the National Broadband Network, the introduction of nationwide early childhood education, the development of a national Australian Curriculum for schools, the construction of 20 cancer clinics around regional Australia, and paid parental leave. Rudd was named as one of the most influential people in the world by &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 2008.

During his first two years in office, Rudd set records for popularity in Newspoll opinion polling, maintaining very high approval ratings. By 2010, however, Rudd&#x27;s approval ratings had begun to drop significantly, with controversies arising over the management of the 2007–2008 financial crisis, the Senate refusal to pass the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, policies on asylum seekers and a debate over a proposed &quot;super profits&quot; tax on the mining industry.

On 23 June 2010, following lengthy media speculation, Deputy Prime Minister Julia Gillard publicly asked that a leadership election be held. Rudd announced a leadership election for the following day.

===Domestic policies===
====Environment====
In opposition, Rudd made combatting climate change a key priority for the Labor Party, proposing an emissions trading scheme and setting an ambitious long term target of a cut to greenhouse gas emissions by 60% before 2050. He also released a plan before the election to require 20% of Australia&#x27;s electricity to be generated from renewable power sources. Prior to the election, Paul Kelly wrote that Rudd had &quot;enshrined climate change as the new moral passion for the Labor Party in a way that recalled Ben Chifley&#x27;s invocation of the Light on the Hill&quot;.

The first official act of the Rudd government, on 3 December 2007, was to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. Rudd attended the UN Climate Change Conference in Bali, Indonesia, in December 2007 just ten days after being sworn in. In February 2008, the Prime Minister told Parliament that &quot;the costs of inaction on climate change are much greater than the costs of action&quot; and that &quot;Australia must... seize the opportunity now to become a leader globally&quot;. In the 2008 budget, the Rudd government set out its climate agenda which included an emissions trading scheme and a number of renewable energy, energy efficiency and research, development and demonstration (RD&amp;D) programs.
Rudd established the Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute to accelerate the deployment of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology globally and the sharing of information. The institute was launched in a joint press conference with US President Barack Obama and Rudd at the Major Economies Forum in Italy in 2009. Obama said the partnership aimed to double the amount of investment in research and development needed to make alternative technologies viable and &quot;points to the ability for us to pool our resources in order to see the technological breakthroughs necessary in order for us to solve this problem.&quot; The Institute received international support with 15 governments and more than 40 major companies and industry groups signing on as foundation members.

The Rudd government committed significant resources to renewable energy. Legislation for an expanded Renewable Energy Target was passed in August 2009, expanding it from 9,500 GWh by 2010 to 45,000 GWh by 2020 and introducing a &#x27;solar credits&#x27; multiplier to provide an additional incentive for the installation of solar photovoltaic systems.

The Rudd government sought to introduce an emissions trading scheme to tackle climate change in Australia and embarked on a thorough policy development process involving the Garnaut Review led by its climate change adviser, Ross Garnaut, followed by a green paper on ETS design issues, Treasury modelling to inform mitigation target decisions and a final white paper, which would be published in December 2008. The White Paper included a plan to introduce an emissions trading scheme in 2010, known as the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, and gave a target range for Australia&#x27;s greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 of between 5% and 15% less than 2000 levels. However, the ultimate legislation was frustrated in the Australian Senate — with the Liberal Party, Nationals and Australian Greens voting against it, the Senate rejected it on 13 August 2009. Rudd and key Labor ministers worked with the Liberals under opposition leader Malcolm Turnbull, who personally supported action on emissions, to achieve compromise on details of the scheme and gain their support. On 1 December 2009, Turnbull was replaced in a leadership spill called over the issue, by ETS opponent Tony Abbott, and the following day, the Senate voted against the revised package of bills. Rudd criticised the Liberals heavily for their refusal to support the legislation (&quot;What absolute political cowardice, what absolute failure of leadership, what absolute failure of logic ...&quot;) but in April 2010 announced that the Government would delay implementing an emissions trading scheme until 2011.Rudd personally committed himself to international action on climate change in the lead-up to the Copenhagen Summit in December 2009. Ahead of the summit, he convened a meeting of leaders at the 2009 APEC conference in Singapore which brought together the leaders of China, the United States, Japan and Denmark for the first time to discuss their respective positions. Rudd announced financial help for small island states affected by climate change at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Trinidad and Tobago in 2009 and used the meeting to rally support for the Copenhagen summit. Rudd played a key role in Copenhagen in delivering an accord despite the wide divergence of views among advanced and emerging economies. Gordon Brown, the then-prime minister of the United Kingdom, said of Rudd at Copenhagen: &quot;Kevin stood up to those who wanted to say &#x27;no&#x27; on climate change ... The fact we got a Copenhagen declaration which has now led to the next stage ... is in no small measure due to him.&quot; However, the perceived weakness of the Copenhagen accord in setting binding targets impacted upon the momentum towards an emissions trading scheme at home. Rudd reflected later that &quot;we all failed... though not for want of effort from many of us.&quot;

====Stolen Generations====

As the parliament&#x27;s first order of business, on 13 February 2008, Rudd gave a national apology to Indigenous Australians for the &quot;stolen generations&quot;. The apology, for the policies of successive parliaments and governments, passed unanimously as a motion by both houses of parliament. Rudd pledged the government to bridging the gap between Indigenous and Non-Indigenous Australian health, education and living conditions, and in a way that respects their rights to self-determination. During meetings held in December 2007 and March 2008 the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) adopted six targets to improve the wellbeing of Indigenous Australians over the next five to twenty years. As of 2016, there have been eight Closing the Gap Reports presented to Parliament, providing data in areas that previously had none and updates on progress.

Since leaving politics, Rudd has established the Australian National Apology Foundation, as foreshadowed in his final speech to Parliament, to continue to promote reconciliation and closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. He has contributed $100,000 to the Foundation and to kickstart fundraising for a National Apology Chair at the Australian National University.

====Economy====
The Rudd government&#x27;s economic policy response to the 2007–2008 financial crisis has been cited as an effective international model and described by Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz as &quot;one of the strongest Keynesian stimulus packages in the world&quot; that &quot;helped Australia avoid recession and saved up to 200,000 jobs&quot;. Following the start of the 2007–2008 financial crisis, increased exports and consumer spending stimulated by the Rudd government&#x27;s intervention helped the Australian economy avoid recession in 2009. Australia was the only western economy to do so. Internationally, Kevin Rudd helped lead efforts to make the G20 the most influential global forum coordinating policies to counter the global impact of the crisis.

In his first speech to Parliament in 1998, Rudd outlined his belief in the need for governments to take an active role in the economy, particularly to assure equality of opportunity. He affirmed his general belief in competitive markets, but repudiated neoliberalism and free market economists such as Friedrich Hayek, saying governments must regulate markets and intervene where they fail. Upon becoming leader in December 2006, he promised an economic policy with two arms to its philosophy and practice: rewarding hard work and achievement, but with a guarantee of fairness and social justice.

On election to office prior to the 2007–2008 financial crisis, the Rudd government announced a five-point plan to combat inflation. The first budget of the Rudd government was delivered by Treasurer Wayne Swan in May 2008 and a projected surplus of $21.7 billion was announced. In line with Rudd&#x27;s explanation of his economic philosophy on taking office, his government intervened early as the global recession began to take hold by guaranteeing bank deposits and announcing two stimulatory spending packages. The first was worth $10.4 billion and announced in late 2008, and included measures such as lump sum payments for low to middle income earners, increasing the first homebuyers&#x27; bonus, doubling training places and fast-tracking a national infrastructure program. The second, worth $42 billion, was announced in February 2009 and included $900 cash payments to resident taxpayers who paid net tax in the 2007–08 financial year. Stating that his Government would &quot;move heaven and earth to reduce the impact of the global recession&quot;, Rudd delivered a spending program for infrastructure, schools and housing worth $28.8 billion as part of this package. After initially raising interest rates to combat inflation, The Reserve Bank cut official interest rates several times in increments of up to 1 percent, and fell to 3 percent in May 2009, the lowest since 1960. The second budget, released in May 2009, projected a $57.6 billion deficit for 2009–10. The majority of the deficit was created by a loss of taxation revenue as a result of the recession, with the rest made up in stimulus and other spending. The downturn was expected to remove $210 billion in taxation revenue from the budget over the next four years.

The Nation Building Economic Stimulus Plan, as it was branded, contained a range of programs implemented through Commonwealth legislation and overseen by Commonwealth agencies, although administered by state governments and other authorities. The Building the Education Revolution (BER) program, worth $16.2 billion, sought to stimulate the nationwide economy by employing construction workers in school building developments. These included the construction of libraries, classrooms and multipurpose centres, the refurbishment and repairs of existing facilities, and science and language centres in 70 secondary schools in disadvantaged areas. A$4 billion Energy Efficient Homes Package was also launched, containing a Home Insulation Program (HIP) which provided $1,600 worth of assistance to owner-occupiers to install ceiling insulation in existing homes. The government estimated that 40% of homes were not insulated, and that this had costs in energy waste, household bills for heating and cooling, and resident health and comfort among others. Other components included social and defence housing construction, funding for local community infrastructure and road projects, and the $950 cash bonus. The OECD assessed in its 2009 Economic Outlook Report that the Rudd government&#x27;s policy response to the crisis had reduced the impact of the global recession on employment.

Two major controversies, however, affected public reception of the scheme. The Home Insulation Program became controversial in early 2010 after reports of house fires, possible fraud and the deaths of four young insulation installers. Rudd responded by demoting the minister responsible, Peter Garrett, suspending the scheme and commissioning an immediate review of the program by Dr Allan Hawke. Hawke noted in his report that &quot;despite the safety, quality and compliance concerns, there were solid achievements against the program objectives&quot;. Approximately 1.1 million homes had been insulated through the scheme by April 2010, about 10,000 jobs had been created, and national safety standards and training were a focus. However, Hawke found the department was not up to the task of monitoring thousands of independent contractors around Australia on a tight timeframe and that demand was higher than anticipated, which led to safety and quality risks that &quot;cannot be fully abated&quot;. Greg Combet, who had been appointed Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, announced upon the report&#x27;s release on 22 April that the scheme would not resume, and that he would work to restore public confidence in the home insulation industry. Rudd personally apologised to the families on 26 April. In a 2014 Royal Commission investigation into the scheme, Rudd accepted his Government&#x27;s responsibility for systems failures that led to the deaths, describing them as a &quot;deep tragedy&quot; and acknowledged the pain of the families involved.

The Building the Education Revolution program rolled out 23,670 school projects around Australia representing a completion rate of 92 per cent. However, claims of overpricing and poor value for money in some projects resulted in a taskforce being established to examine the implementation of the scheme, led by Brad Orgill, the former CEO of UBS Australasia. Only 3% of complaints about the scheme were upheld, and most projects were found to have been good value for money.

In early 2009, during the Great Recession, Rudd stated &quot;that the great neo-liberal experiment of the past 30 years has failed&quot;, and that &quot;Neo-liberalism and the free-market fundamentalism it has produced has been revealed as little more than personal greed dressed up as an economic philosophy. And, ironically, it now falls to social democracy to prevent liberal capitalism from cannibalising itself.&quot; Rudd called for a new era of &quot;social capitalism&quot; from social democrats such as himself and US President Barack Obama to &quot;support a global financial system that properly balances private incentive with public responsibility&quot;. The Center for Strategic and International Studies has acknowledged Kevin Rudd as one of the founders of the G20 that helped prevent a second global depression.

The Rudd government&#x27;s third budget in 2010 projected a $40.8 billion deficit for 2010–11 but forecast that Australia would return to surplus by 2012–13. The government proposed a &quot;super profits&quot; tax on the mining industry and included $12 billion in revenue from the proposal in the forecast, although the tax had not been passed by the Senate.

====Australia 2020 Summit====
In February 2008 Rudd announced the Australia 2020 Summit, held from 19 to 20 April 2008, which brought together 1000 leading Australians to discuss ten major areas of policy innovation. Among the initiatives supported at the event, the summit voted in favour of a plebiscite on Australia &quot;relinquishing ties&quot; to the United Kingdom followed by a referendum on the model for an Australian republic, a bill of rights, the re-formation of an Indigenous peak representative body similar to ATSIC, (which had been abolished by the Howard government), the introduction of an Emissions Trading Scheme and a National Disability Insurance Scheme, and a review of the taxation system.

Findings released in April 2009 reported that nine out of the 1000 submitted ideas were to be immediately enacted and that the government was deliberating on other ideas proposed. By mid-2010, among the key reform ideas suggested, Prime Minister Rudd had sought to introduce an ETS, but postponed it after failing to secure passage through the senate; formed a consultative committee on a Bill of rights then rejected its recommendation for implementation; established the National Congress of Australia&#x27;s First Peoples in 2010; commissioned the Henry Review of taxation (on the basis of which the Rudd government proposed a new &quot;super-profits&quot; tax on mining); and Rudd had described the issue of a vote on a republic as not being &quot;a priority&quot;.

====Industrial relations====
Kevin Rudd came to office pledging to overhaul WorkChoices, a key Howard government policy commencing in March 2006 which had been attacked for reducing pay and conditions in the workplace, and which was crucial to Howard&#x27;s defeat at the 2007 federal election.

Upon Rudd&#x27;s arrival as Leader of the Opposition in December 2006, he gave a speech emphasising this commitment. In April 2007, he announced Labor&#x27;s &quot;Forward with Fairness&quot; plan to take to the election, which included a phased abolition of Australian Workplace Agreements (AWAs) over five years, a safety net consisting of 10 National Employment Standards, an independent umpire and simplified industrial awards. It also included the restoration of unfair dismissal laws for companies with under 100 employees (probation period of 12 months for companies with less than 15 employees), and the retention of the Australian Building and Construction Commission until 2010. It retained the illegality of secondary boycotts, the right of employers to lock workers out, restriction of a union right of entry to workplaces, and restrictions on workers&#x27; right to strike. It was broadly seen as a concession to business on some areas of concern while still upholding key elements of the original plan.

On 20 March 2008, the &quot;Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Act 2008&quot; gained assent, and gave effect to some of these measures, including preventing any new AWAs from being signed. Rudd declared AWA&#x27;s &quot;dead and buried&quot;, saying: &quot;Today we declare this shameful chapter in the history of Australia&#x27;s workplaces to be dead and buried. And today with this legislation we begin the process of burying the rest of the Work Choices omnibus once and for all.&quot;

In 2009, the &quot;Fair Work Act&quot; was passed. Rudd also established a single industrial relations bureaucracy called Fair Work Australia, designed to play a far more interventionist role than the Howard government&#x27;s Fair Pay Commission. Fair Work Australia mediated the 2011 Qantas industrial disputes.

====Education====
During the election, Rudd promised a &quot;Digital Education Revolution&quot;, including provision of a computer on the desk of every upper secondary student. The program initially stalled with state governments asserting that the proposed funding was inadequate. The federal government increased proposed funding from $1.2 billion to $2 billion, and did not mandate that a computer be provided to each upper secondary student. The program supplied office software, photo and video editing software, and web design software, some of it unusable due to the hardware becoming obsolete.

====Immigration====
As prime minister, Rudd professed his belief in a &quot;Big Australia&quot;, while his government increased the immigration quota after to around 300,000 people. In 2010, Rudd appointed Tony Burke as population minister to examine population goals.

In 2008, the government adjusted the mandatory detention policies established by the Keating and Howard governments and declared an end to the Pacific Solution. Boat arrivals increased considerably during 2009 and the Opposition said this was due to the government&#x27;s policy adjustments, the Government said it was due to &quot;push factors&quot;. After a fatal explosion on an asylum seeker boat in April 2009, Rudd said: &quot;People smugglers are the vilest form of human life.&quot; Opposition frontbencher Tony Abbott said that Kevin Rudd was inept and hypocritical in his handling of the issue during the Oceanic Viking affair of October 2009. In April 2010, the Rudd government suspended processing new claims by Sri Lankan and Afghan asylum seekers, who comprised 80 per cent of all boat arrivals, for three and six months respectively.

====Taxation====
In the 2007 election, Rudd committed to increase the fairness of the tax system. The 2008 Budget aimed to achieve this with a range of measures including $47 billion of tax cuts over four years focused on lower and middle income workers, an increase of the child care tax rebate from 30% to 50%, an increase of the income level at which the Medicare Levy Surcharge was targeted, and introducing means tests for some other benefits. Some other measures were blocked or amended in the Senate, in which any crossbencher in combination with the Liberal-National Coalition could defeat a bill.

In May 2008, Rudd committed to a &quot;root and branch&quot; review of all aspects of the Australian taxation system, led by the secretary of the Treasury, Ken Henry, and taking evidence from a wide range of sources. After receiving around 1,500 submissions and running a two-day conference, the Henry Tax Review reported to the Treasurer in December 2009. On 2 May 2010, the Rudd government formally responded, announcing a package of measures to help support investment in the non-mining sectors and rebalance the economy to a more sustainable trajectory.

The government&#x27;s tax plan had three components: reducing the corporate tax rate to 28% and introducing investment incentives for small business; increasing the compulsory employee superannuation rate to 12% to increase the savings base; and eliminating state-based mining royalties, establishing a $5.6 billion infrastructure fund to support resources sector expansion and competitiveness, and increasing tax rebates for mining exploration. These three components were to be funded by a new Resources Super Profits Tax (RSPT) on the &#x27;super profits&#x27; of mining companies. The RSPT was a profits-based tax, which meant that when resource companies made large profits their effective tax rate increased and when those profits fell, their tax rate fell. The tax policy was the subject of strong opposition from the mining industry, including an advertising campaign.

Immediately following Kevin Rudd&#x27;s replacement as prime minister by Julia Gillard, the Government did a deal with the largest mining companies to replace the RSPT with a new tax – the Minerals Resource Rent Tax (MRRT). The Government claimed the new tax would raise $10.6 billion in its first two years, just $1.5 billion less than the $12 billion that RSPT had been forecast to raise. It was quickly realised that this was a wildly optimistic estimate. John Quiggin said, &quot;All the changes that were made to the package between the original tax and the agreement they reached in the end were too generous.&quot; Prior to the introduction of the MRRT in the May 2012 budget, the government revised down its forecasts, suggesting that the tax would only bring in $3 billion for the financial year. In October 2012, the figure was reduced to $2 billion, while on 14 May 2013, it was announced that the receipts were expected to be less than $200 million.

====Healthcare====
Rudd announced a significant and far-reaching strategic reform to Australian healthcare in 2010. However, this was not pursued beyond in-principle agreements with Labor State and Territory governments, and was scrapped by Julia Gillard during her first year in office.

====Families====
The Rudd government increased the age pension by more than $100 a fortnight for singles and $76 for couples, the largest increase since 1909, in response to the Harmer Review which found that single retirees living on their own were unusually disadvantaged. It also lifted the Child Care Tax Rebate from 30 to 50 per cent for around 600,000 families – paid quarterly rather than annually. In addition, the Government introduced an Education Tax Refund of 50 per cent of up to $750 per child, benefiting 1.3 million families. Prime Minister Rudd was also responsible for Australia&#x27;s first paid parental leave scheme – benefiting 150,000 new parents 18 weeks of paid leave each year.

====Disabilities====
Work began under Rudd on the National Disability Insurance Scheme. First floated as a big idea by advocates at the 2020 Summit in April 2008, the Rudd government doubled funding for disability services to the States and introduced the National Disability Strategy. The PM referred the idea of an insurance scheme to the Productivity Commission in 2009, announced at the National Disability Awards in Canberra.

===Foreign affairs===
As prime minister, Rudd saw Australia as being able to help shape world responses to urgent global challenges through active diplomacy, including the creation of global and regional institutions and building of coalitions, and playing an important role in the &quot;Asia Pacific century&quot;.

Rudd&#x27;s first official overseas visit as prime minister was to Indonesia in December 2007 for the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, then visited Australian troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. In February 2008, he visited East Timor following the assassination attempt on the President of East Timor, Dr José Ramos-Horta, and in March 2008 travelled to Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. The Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands, Dr Derek Sikua, was also the first foreign head of government Mr Rudd received as prime minister. In April 2008, Rudd signed Australia to the global Millennium Development Goals Call to Action.

====Pacific Islands====
A close, co-operative relationship was developed with the Pacific Island nations, leading to Australia hosting the Pacific Islands Forum in 2009, and the application of a Millennium Development Goals framework to Australian aid programs with development partners across the Pacific.
The revised aid program set out concrete goals in areas such as health, education and employment for Australia&#x27;s 15 development partners in the region. In August 2008, at the Pacific Islands Forum in Niue, Mr Rudd also announced the introduction of a three-year pilot seasonal worker scheme for up to 2,500 workers from Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, Tonga and Kiribati to work in Australia&#x27;s horticulture industry for up to seven months. This acceptance of guest workers was a radical departure from previous Australian policy. The seasonal worker scheme got off to slow start, bringing in 1,100 workers to 2012. However, it accelerated over the ensuing years as demand for labour increased.

====Iraq====
In his 2007 election campaign, Kevin Rudd committed to withdrawing Australian military forces from Iraq. He dismissed each of the reasons which had been used to commit Australian troops to the Iraq War in 2003, and accused his predecessor of abusing pre-war intelligence, some of which indicated that an attack on Iraq would increase the threat of terrorism.

In accordance with a Multinational Force Iraq agreement with the new Iraqi Government,
Labor&#x27;s plan to withdraw the Australian Defence Force combat contingent was completed on 28 July 2009, three days ahead of the deadline. In mid-2010, there were about 65 ADF personnel remaining in Iraq supporting UN operations or the Australian Embassy.

In March 2009, Nouri Al-Maliki, the then-Prime Minister of Iraq, visited Australia. During the visit, Prime Minister Al-Maliki and then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd signed a declaration on increased cooperation in six key areas and to enhance trade and investment ties. The leaders agreed to an Australia-Iraq Agricultural Partnership focused on bolstering Iraq&#x27;s agricultural productivity and food security as a central element of Iraq&#x27;s reconstruction and development. Australia also appointed a Senior Trade Commissioner to contribute to stronger commercial links, and committed to an AusAID presence in Baghdad to support the Government&#x27;s three-year A$165 million development assistance commitment.

====Afghanistan====
The Rudd government redefined Australia&#x27;s role in Afghanistan, including Australia&#x27;s particular responsibility for Uruzgan Province. In Afghanistan, the Australian presence not only trained the 4th Brigade of the Afghan National Army, but also undertook large scale programs in the education of women and girls, the building of mosques with schools attached, basic healthcare and the extension of the road network. From a total of $56 million spent on foreign aid in 2009–2010, $25 million went to Afghanistan through the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund.

Rudd continued to support Australian military involvement in Afghanistan, despite the growing number of Australian casualties. On 29 April 2009, Rudd committed 450 extra troops to the region bringing the total to 1550. Explaining the deployment, he said, &quot;A measured increase in Australian forces in Afghanistan will enhance the security of Australian citizens, given that so many terrorists attacking Australians in the past have been trained in Afghanistan.&quot;

On a November 2009 visit to Afghanistan, Rudd told Australian troops: &quot;We from Australia will remain for the long haul.&quot; In April 2010, the Australian Government decided not to commit further troops to Uruzgan Province to replace Dutch forces when they withdrew, but increased the numbers of diplomatic, development aid, and police personnel to around 50 with military effort and civilian work focussed on Uruzgan.

The United States diplomatic cables leak reported Rudd&#x27;s criticisms of Australia&#x27;s European allies in the Afghanistan campaign.

===Political positions===
====Nationhood====

As shadow foreign minister, Rudd reformulated Labor&#x27;s foreign policy in terms of &quot;Three Pillars&quot;: engagement with the UN, engagement with Asia, and the US alliance.

Although disagreeing with the original commitment to the Iraq War, Rudd supports the continued deployment of Australian troops in Iraq, but not the continued deployment of combat troops. Rudd was also in favour of Australia&#x27;s military presence in Afghanistan.

Rudd backs the road map for peace plan and defended Israel&#x27;s actions during the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict, condemning Hezbollah and Hamas for violating Israeli territory.

As prime minister, he also pledged support for East Timor, stating that Australian troops would remain in East Timor for as long as East Timor&#x27;s government wanted them to.

Rudd also gave his support for the independence of Kosovo from Serbia,
before Australia officially recognised the republic. This decision sparked protests of the Serbian Australian community against Rudd.

In 2008 Rudd advised the appointment of Quentin Bryce as the first female Governor-General of Australia to Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of Australia.

====Society====
Some commentators have described Rudd as a social conservative. He has moved to remove financial discrimination against LGBT couples, but he had previously been opposed to legislation to recognise same-sex marriage.

In May 2013, however, Rudd announced he had changed his position based on personal experience and the fact that his children had long thought him &quot;an unreconstructed dinosaur&quot; for not supporting marriage equality legislation. He went on to say that &quot;I believe the secular Australian state should be able to recognise same sex marriage&quot; while opposing any compulsion for churches to marry same-sex couples if that was not their wish.

In a conscience vote in 2006, Rudd supported legislation to transfer regulatory authority for the abortion-inducing drug RU486 from the federal Minister For Health to the Therapeutic Goods Administration, removing the minister&#x27;s veto on the use of RU486 in Australia. Rudd said that &quot;For me and for the reasons I have outlined, the life of the unborn is of great importance. And having tested these reasons with men and women of faith, and men and women of science, that I&#x27;ve decided not to oppose this bill. &quot;

In another 2006 conscience vote, Rudd voted against legislation to expand embryonic stem cell research

In May 2008, Rudd was drawn into the controversy over photographic artist Bill Henson and his work depicting naked adolescents as part of a show due to open at an inner-city gallery in Sydney. In a televised interview, Rudd stated that he found the images &quot;absolutely revolting&quot; and that they had &quot;no artistic merit&quot;. These views swiftly drew censure from members of the &quot;creative stream&quot; who attended the 2020 Summit convened by Rudd, led by actress Cate Blanchett.

===Resignation===

On 23 June 2010, the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; reported that Rudd&#x27;s Chief of Staff, Alister Jordan, had talked to over half of the Labor caucus to gauge the level of Rudd&#x27;s support within the party. This followed significant media speculation that his deputy, Julia Gillard, would challenge him for the leadership. Late that evening, after it became clear that Rudd had lost the support of a large number of Labor MPs, Gillard publicly requested that Rudd hold a leadership election as soon as possible. Rudd subsequently announced a leadership election for 24 June, saying that he would stand. Hours before the vote, however, it became clear that Rudd would not have the support to win, and so he stood down as Labor leader and prime minister.

Gillard was elected unopposed, becoming Australia&#x27;s first female prime minister. Bill Shorten, the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children&#x27;s Services and a key member of the Labor Party&#x27;s right faction, speculated that it was the Government&#x27;s handling of the insulation program, the sudden announcement of change of policy on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, and the way in which they had &quot;introduced the debate&quot; about the Resource Super Profits Tax as the main reasons which had led to a collapse in support for Rudd&#x27;s leadership.

Barry Cohen, a former minister in the Hawke government, said that many in the Labor Party felt ignored by Rudd&#x27;s centralist leadership style, and his at times insulting and rude treatment of staff and other ministers. Many were willing to overlook this due to his immense popularity, but when Rudd&#x27;s poll numbers began to drop in late 2009 and 2010, they wanted to install a leader more able to establish consensus and involve the party caucus as a whole. Rudd became the first Australian prime minister to be removed from office by his own party during his first term.

===Popularity and assessment===
Rudd maintained long periods of popularity in opinion polls during his initial tenure as prime minister for his management of the 2007–2008 financial crisis and his well renowned apology to the Indigenous community, achieving some of the highest approval ratings for an Australian prime minister on record during the height of the 2007–2008 financial crisis. However, he would see a rapid decrease in popularity after his failed handling of legislative negotiations, ultimately leading to the demise of his premiership. The circumstances of his removal from office have remained controversial; his supporters have decried the undemocratic nature of his ousting, while critics have accused him of an autocratic and flawed leadership style. He is often ranked in the middle-to-lower tier of Australian prime ministers.

==2010 election==
Rudd announced following his resignation as prime minister that he would re-contest his seat of Griffith for the 2010 federal election, set for 21 August. Early in the campaign, he suffered abdominal pain and underwent surgery to remove his gall bladder. His first public statements after the operation were in an interview with ABC Radio National&#x27;s Phillip Adams for &quot;Late Night Live&quot;, which received wide national coverage; in it, he denied being the source of political leaks concerning Julia Gillard. Gillard later requested that Rudd join the national campaign to boost Labor&#x27;s chances of re-election, which he did. Rudd and Gillard were subsequently photographed together during a private meeting in Brisbane, both appearing uncomfortable, unsmiling and unspeaking. Rudd was comfortably re-elected as the Member for Griffith. The election resulted in a hung parliament after both major parties failed to win a majority of seats. Weeks later, Gillard was able to form a minority government with the support of the Greens and independent MPs.

==Foreign minister (2010–2012)==

Prime Minister Julia Gillard appointed Rudd as Minister for Foreign Affairs in Cabinet on 14 September 2010. He represented Gillard at a UN General Assembly meeting in September 2010.

WikiLeaks, in 2010, published material about Kevin Rudd&#x27;s term as prime minister, included United States diplomatic cables leak. As foreign minister, Rudd denounced publishing classified documents by WikiLeaks. The Australian media reported that references to Rudd in the cables included frank discussions between Rudd and US officials about China and Afghanistan. This included negative assessments of some of Rudd&#x27;s foreign policy initiatives and leadership style, written in confidence for the US Government by the US Embassy staff in Australia.

Before his first visit to Israel as foreign minister, Rudd stated Israel should be subject to International Atomic Energy Agency inspection. Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman rejected the call.

Following the 2011 Egyptian revolution and resignation of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Rudd called for &quot;constitutional reform and a clear timetable towards free and fair elections&quot;.

In response to the 2011 Libyan civil war, Rudd announced in early March 2011, the international community should enforce a no-fly zone, as the &quot;lesser of two evils&quot;. The US officials in Canberra sought clarification on what the Australian Government was proposing. Gillard said the United Nations Security Council should consider a full range of alternatives, and that Australia was not planning to send forces to enforce a no-fly zone.
Following the devastating 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan, Rudd announced after talking with Japanese Foreign Minister Takeaki Matsumoto, he had offered Australian field hospitals and disaster victim identification teams to help with recovery. Rudd also said he had offered Australian atomic expertise and sought urgent briefings following an explosion at a nuclear plant.
Rudd announced his resignation as foreign minister on 22 February 2012, citing Gillard&#x27;s failure to counter character attacks launched by Simon Crean and &quot;other faceless men&quot; as his reasons. Speaking to the press, Rudd explained that he considered Gillard&#x27;s silence as evidence that she no longer supported him, and therefore he could not continue in office. &quot;I can only serve as Foreign Minister if I have the confidence of Prime Minister Gillard and her senior ministers,&quot; he said.

Rudd resigned as the Minister for Foreign Affairs followed heated speculation about a possible leadership spill. Craig Emerson temporarily replaced Rudd as Minister for Foreign Affairs, until Senator Bob Carr became Minister for Foreign Affairs on 13 March 2012.

==Leadership tensions==
===February 2012 spill===

Speculation regarding Rudd&#x27;s desire to challenge Gillard to regain the leadership of the Labor Party—and hence the Prime Ministership—became a near constant feature of media commentary on the Gillard government. In October 2011, Queensland MP Graham Perrett, the member for the marginal Brisbane-area seat of Moreton, announced that if Labor replaced Gillard with Rudd, he would resign and force a by-election—a move that would have likely cost Labor its majority. In her speech to Labor&#x27;s 2011 Conference, Prime Minister Gillard mentioned every Labor Prime Minister since World War II with the exception of Kevin Rudd. The speech was widely reported as a snub to Rudd. In early 2012, Labor MPs began to openly discuss the issue of leadership. Simon Crean told Radio 3AW, &quot;[Rudd] can&#x27;t be leader again...people will not elect as leaders those they don&#x27;t perceive as team players&quot;.
Following a &quot;Four Corners&quot; program that revisited Gillard&#x27;s role in Rudd&#x27;s downfall as prime minister, a breakdown in party discipline saw Labor MP Darren Cheeseman call on Gillard to resign, while his colleague Steve Gibbons called Rudd a &quot;psychopath with a giant ego&quot;. Amidst the controversy, an expletive-laden video of out-takes of an intemperate Kevin Rudd attempting to record a Chinese language message during his time as prime minister was released anonymously on YouTube, apparently aimed at discrediting his push for the leadership. While Rudd said publicly only that he was &quot;happy as Foreign Minister&quot;, media commentators widely declared that a leadership challenge was &quot;on&quot;.

When Rudd resigned on 22 February 2012, Deputy Prime Minister Wayne Swan lambasted Rudd as &quot;dysfunctional&quot;. His Cabinet colleague Tony Burke also spoke against Rudd, saying of his time in office that &quot;the stories that were around of the chaos, of the temperament, of the inability to have decisions made, they are not stories.&quot;. Labor Senator Doug Cameron came out in support of Rudd and called on his colleagues to show him respect.

Later that day, Rudd said that he did not think Gillard could defeat the Coalition at the next election and that, since his resignation, he had received encouragement from Labor MPs to contest the leadership. Gillard responded to these developments by announcing a leadership election for the morning of 27 February 2012, and stating that she would be a candidate. Two days later, Rudd announced his own candidacy. Before the vote, Rudd promised that he would not initiate any further leadership challenges against Gillard should he lose, but he did not rule out becoming Leader again at a later date.

Gillard won the leadership election comfortably with 71 votes to Rudd&#x27;s 31. Following the result Rudd returned to the backbenches, reiterating that he would not mount any further leadership challenges against Gillard, and stating that he would support her in any further leadership elections.
===March 2013 spill===

On 21 March 2013, following a request from Simon Crean, the prime minister, Julia Gillard, called a leadership spill. It was widely reported that Rudd was considering nominating for the leadership of the Australian Labor Party, but he chose not to stand. Gillard was the sole candidate and was elected unopposed.

===June 2013 spill===

On 10 June 2013, the security of Gillard&#x27;s position as leader was put in doubt following the loss of significant support in the Labor caucus. Furthermore, polling in the preceding week indicated that the party could be left with a very low number of 40 seats in the Federal Parliament, while one Labor backbencher compared the Labor Party to the &quot;Titanic&quot;. ABC reported that &quot;some former staunch supporters&quot; held the view that Gillard could not win the election, and ABC journalist Barrie Cassidy identified Rudd as the only feasible replacement.

The political editor of the &quot;Australian&quot; newspaper, Dennis Shanahan, reported on 10 June 2013 that Rudd had been &quot;mobbed&quot; by supporters in the Victorian city of Geelong days earlier and that he was &quot;expected to be returned to the ALP leadership&quot;.

On 26 June 2013, Julia Gillard called a leadership spill, intending to head off any challenge. Rudd announced that he would challenge the prime minister. Gillard said that, in her view, the loser of the ballot should retire from politics; Rudd agreed that this would be appropriate. Key Gillard supporter Bill Shorten, who was one of the main figures responsible for Rudd&#x27;s previous overturn as prime minister, this time announced his support for Rudd. Rudd subsequently won the leadership ballot, 57–45, and became the Leader of the Labor Party for the second time.

==Second term as Prime Minister (2013)==
Following the leadership election on 26 June 2013, Julia Gillard resigned as prime minister. After seeking legal advice from the acting Solicitor-General, Robert Orr, the Governor-General, Quentin Bryce, invited Rudd to be sworn in as prime minister for the second time on 27 June. At 9:53 am (AEST), Rudd was sworn in as prime minister for a second term, becoming the second Labor Prime Minister to have a second non-consecutive term; the first was Andrew Fisher.

===2013 election===

On 4 August 2013, Rudd announced that he had visited Governor-General Quentin Bryce at Parliament House, asking her to dissolve Parliament and for a federal election to be held on 7 September. After Labor subsequently lost the election, Rudd resigned as prime minister for the second time on 18 September 2013.

==Post-political career (2013–present)==
===Resignation from Parliament===
On 13 November 2013, Rudd announced that he would soon resign from Parliament. In his valedictory speech to the House of Representatives, Rudd expressed his attachment to his community but said he wanted to dedicate more time to his family and minimise disruption to House proceedings. Rudd submitted his resignation in writing to the Speaker, Bronwyn Bishop, on 22 November 2013, formally ending his parliamentary career. Terri Butler was selected to run for the Labor Party at the resulting by-election in the electorate of Griffith to be held on 8 February 2014. Rudd offered Butler his support and advice, and campaigned with her in a low-key appearance on 11 January 2014. Butler ultimately succeeded Rudd in the seat.

===International roles===
In early 2014, Rudd left Australia to work in the United States, where he was appointed a Senior Fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School&#x27;s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he completed a major research effort on the future of US-China relations. Through 2014 Rudd joined the Center for Strategic and International Studies as a distinguished statesman, and was appointed a distinguished fellow at both the Paulson Institute at the University of Chicago, Illinois and Chatham House, London.

In September of that year, he was appointed Chair of the Independent Commission on Multilateralism at the International Peace Institute in Vienna, Austria, and in October became the first president of the Asia Society Policy Institute in New York City.

On 5 November 2015, Rudd was appointed to chair Sanitation and Water For All, a global partnership to achieve universal access to drinking water and adequate sanitation. He has also actively contributed to the World Economic Forum&#x27;s Global Agenda Council on China. Rudd is also a member of the Berggruen Institute&#x27;s 21st Century Council. On 21 October 2016, he was awarded an honorary professorship at Peking University.

In 2016, Rudd asked the Government of Australia (then a government of the Liberal-National Coalition) to nominate him for Secretary-General of the United Nations. At its meeting on 28 July, the Cabinet was divided on his suitability for the role and, on that basis, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull decided to decline the request; since nomination by the Australian government was considered a necessary prerequisite for candidacy, Turnbull&#x27;s decision essentially ended Rudd&#x27;s campaign; Rudd later confirmed as much. However, there remains dispute over what if any earlier assurances Turnbull may have given to Rudd and about what happened in the Cabinet meeting.

Rudd is also a member of the Global Leadership Foundation, a non-profit organisation comprising a network of former heads of state or government.

===Royal commission into Australian news media===
On 10 October 2020, Rudd launched a petition for a royal commission into what he termed the &quot;Murdoch media monopoly&quot; and its impact on Australian democracy. The public demand to sign the petition following Rudd&#x27;s Twitter announcement caused the Australian Parliament House&#x27;s ePetitions site to experience technical difficulties. On 25 October 2020, Rudd was joined by former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull who gave him his support, tweeting that he too had signed the petition. With more than 500,000 signatures, the petition became the most signed parliamentary e-petition in Australia and the third most signed parliamentary petition ever. The petition was tabled in the House of Representatives by Labor MP Andrew Leigh on 9 November 2020. Peta Credlin, a Sky News commentator gave an on air apology in February 2021 to Rudd as part of a confidential legal settlement regarding defamation over comments she made in 2020 about him and his petition.

===Academic===
In 2017, Rudd began studying for a doctorate on Xi Jinping at Jesus College, Oxford. In 2022, Rudd was conferred with a Doctorate of Philosophy from the University of Oxford. In his thesis, titled &quot;China&#x27;s new Marxist nationalism: defining Xi Jinping&#x27;s ideological worldview&quot;, Rudd argues that Xi has adopted a more Marxist political and economic approach to government and that will have negative consequences for economic growth and China as a whole.

===Ambassador to the United States===

In late 2022, there were calls for Rudd to be appointed as the next Australian Ambassador to the United States. On 20 December 2022, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Minister for Foreign Affairs Penny Wong announced that Rudd would be appointed as the 23rd Ambassador of Australia to the United States in early 2023, succeeding Arthur Sinodinos. Rudd assumed the position on 20 March 2023.

In March 2024, Rudd was criticised by former US president Donald Trump, who labelled him &quot;nasty&quot; and indicated that he would be removed as US ambassador should Trump win the 2024 presidential election. Rudd had previously been highly critical of Trump during his first presidency. Penny Wong later clarified that Rudd would stay on as ambassador even in the result of Trump winning the election.

In the role, Rudd has been a vocal advocate for AUKUS security partnership, urging American decision makers to implement its promise of technology sharing. While it was hoped he might defuse tension between the United States and China in the role, Rudd has become a blunt critic of China&#x27;s expansionism.

== Writings ==

Rudd has authored several books. While prime minister, he co-authored a children&#x27;s book with entertainer Rhys Muldoon, &quot;Jasper &amp; Abby and the Great Australia Day Kerfuffle&quot;, which was published in 2010. In October 2017, Rudd launched the first volume of his autobiography, entitled &quot;Not for the Faint-hearted: A Personal Reflection on Life, Politics and Purpose&quot;, which chronicles his life until becoming prime minister in 2007. The following year, he published the second volume of his autobiography, &quot;The PM Years&quot;, which covers his prime ministership, the events leading to his removal, and his subsequent return to the position in 2013.

In March 2021, Rudd published &quot;The Case for Courage&quot; as part of Monash University Publishing&#x27;s &quot;In the National Interest&quot; series. The book details Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s domination of the Australian media landscape and poses ideas for how the Labor Party can ensure longevity in office. His next book, &quot;The Avoidable War&quot;, focuses on the bilateral relationship between the United States and China and how the two nations can avoid conflict.

==Personal life==

In 1981, Rudd married Thérèse Rein whom he had met at a gathering of the Australian Student Christian Movement during his university years. Both were residents at Burgmann College during their first year of university. Rudd and Rein have three children. Rudd is a supporter of the Brisbane Lions.

===Religion===
Rudd and his family attend the Anglican church of St John the Baptist in Bulimba in his electorate. Although raised a Roman Catholic, Rudd was actively involved in the Evangelical Union while studying at the Australian National University, and he began attending Anglican services in the 1980s with his wife. In December 2009, Rudd attended a Catholic Mass to commemorate the canonisation of Mary MacKillop at which he received Holy Communion. Rudd&#x27;s actions provoked criticism and debate among both political and religious circles. A report by &quot;The Australian&quot; quoted that Rudd embraced Anglicanism but at the same time did not formally renounce his Catholic faith.

Rudd was a mainstay of the parliamentary prayer group in Parliament House, Canberra.
He has been vocal about his Christianity and has given a number of prominent interviews to the Australian religious press on the topic.
Rudd has defended church representatives engaging with policy debates, particularly with respect to WorkChoices legislation, climate change, global poverty, therapeutic cloning, and asylum seekers. In 2003, he described himself as &quot;an old-fashioned Christian socialist&quot;. In a 2006 essay in &quot;The Monthly&quot;, he argued:
A [truly] Christian perspective on contemporary policy debates may not prevail. It must nonetheless be argued. And once heard, it must be weighed, together with other arguments from different philosophical traditions, in a fully contestable secular polity. A Christian perspective, informed by a social gospel or Christian socialist tradition, should not be rejected contemptuously by secular politicians as if these views are an unwelcome intrusion into the political sphere. If the churches are barred from participating in the great debates about the values that ultimately underpin our society, our economy and our polity, then we have reached a very strange place indeed.

He cites Dietrich Bonhoeffer as a personal inspiration in this regard.

When in Canberra, Rudd and Rein worshipped at St John the Baptist Church, Reid, where they were married. Rudd often did a &quot;door stop&quot; interview for the media when leaving the church yard.

===Health===
In 1993, Rudd underwent a cardiac valve transplant operation (Ross procedure), receiving a cadaveric aortic valve replacement for rheumatic heart disease. In 2011, Rudd underwent a second cardiac valve transplant operation, making a full recovery from the surgery.

<doc id="380966" wikidata="Q13522447" url="?curid=380966" title="John Barlow (diplomat)">
<text>John Barlow was a member of Henry VIII&#x27;s Protestant Church as Dean of Worcester Cathedral. During the king&#x27;s search for an annulment to his first marriage, Barlow acted as a courier between England and Italy, while Rector of Hever.

==Life==

He graduated M.A. at the University of Oxford in 1521.

Barlow was intimately involved in the King&#x27;s attempts to secure a divorce from his first wife, Katherine of Aragon from the Pope. Barlow was a supporter of Henry&#x27;s fiancée, Anne Boleyn. Barlow uncovered evidence of Cardinal Wolsey&#x27;s betrayal of the King&#x27;s cause in Rome, which he faithfully reported to a horrified Anne in 1528. This information helped solidify the future queen&#x27;s hatred towards Wolsey, something which played a major part in the Cardinal&#x27;s fall from power the following year.

Barlow is described as &quot;one of her [Anne Boleyn&#x27;s] favourite clerics&quot;.
In June 1530 he was appointed dean of the College of Westbury-on-Trym, just outside Bristol, but actually in the diocese of Worcester. On the dissolution of the College in 1544, Barlow became dean of Worcester. His closeness to Anne Boleyn led some to suggest he must have known of her &#x27;treason.&#x27;
One unfortunate Welsh vicar who suggested this was hounded by Barlow who was intolerant and confrontational.&#x27;
Barlow was Dean of Worcester from 1544 until he was deprived of the role under Queen Mary in 1553.

==Family==
John Barlow was the son of Robert Barlow, a merchant of Colchester in Essex, and his wife Anna. He had three brothers: William Barlow, and Thomas, who were both men of the church, and Roger, a merchant operating in Seville and Bristol, and who sailed to South America with Sebastian Cabot.

<doc id="380981" wikidata="Q7896480" url="?curid=380981" title="University of Toronto Faculty of Dentistry">
<text>The [[University of Toronto]] Faculty of Dentistry is a dental school located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is one of the ten dental schools in Canada. It is the largest dental school in Canada with a range of undergraduate and graduate level programs with a total enrolment in the range of 560. The faculty is located at the heart of Downtown Toronto&#x27;s Discovery District, a neighbourhood with a high concentration of hospitals and research institutes, just south of the University of Toronto&#x27;s St. George campus. In 2014, the Faculty of Dentistry joined the Toronto Addis Ababa Academic Collaboration (TAAAC), providing support in building capacity for oral health in Ethiopia by creating collaborative teaching opportunities.

==History==
In 1868, the province of Ontario passed the &quot;Act Respecting Dentistry&quot;. This Act granted the Royal College of Dental Surgeons of Ontario (RCDSO) dual responsibilities of licensing and dental education in Ontario. In 1875, the Royal College of Dental Surgeons was founded, with its first semester schedule to start on November 3, 1875. Under the Act, the RCDS could grant a Licentiate of Dental Surgery (LDS), which was not a formal degree, but training that granted those interested in a license to practice dentistry in Ontario. James Branston Willmott was the first Dean of the school. Dr. Willmott, joined by Dr. Luke Teskey were the only two professors guiding the first class of eleven students in 1875–1876. The RCDS established an affiliation with the University of Toronto in 1888, but it was not until 1889 that it granted the Doctor of Dental Surgery (DDS) degrees. In 1925, the RCDS became the Faculty of Dentistry at the University of Toronto.

One of the alumni of the Faculty of Dentistry, Dr. Harold Keith Box, DDS, PhD (1890–1956), was as a stakeholder in establishing the Canadian Dental Association Research Foundation (CDAF), organized by a committee of the Canadian Dental Association. The CDAF was the first of its kind in Canada, an organization that focused on providing funding for dental research projects in Canadian dental schools. Due to his contribution to the establishment of the CDAF and the various publications that emerged from his work, Dr. Harold Keith Box is known as the father of dental research in Canada. The Faculty of Dentistry continued to contribute to dental research initiatives and became a distinguished contributor at the international level. In 1921, International Association of Dental Research had four chapters, one of which was in Toronto (in addition to Chicago, Boston and New York). In 1927, the IADR Toronto Chapter was successful in receiving funds for the first hospital internship that ensured students had four free hours per day so that they could devote time to research.

In 1945, after years of negotiations, three University of Toronto Faculty of Dentistry professors, Dr. Frank Lott, Dr. Harvey Reid and Dr. Roy G. Ellis, in their role as members of the CDA Research Committee, were able to secure funding for dental research from the National Research Council of Canada. This ensured that generations of dental researchers had access to funding. With the continuous flow of funding, the Faculty of Dentistry was able to establish the first Dental Public Health specialty in 1946, and with its inception began a long history of effort in research and initiatives that would influence oral health policies in Canada.

===Ice hockey team===
The faculty of dentistry formerly operated a senior ice hockey team known as the Toronto Dentals, which competed in the Ontario Hockey Association and won the J. Ross Robertson Cup in 1917. The Toronto Dentals also became Canadian national champions with their victory at the 1917 Allan Cup. Alumni of the Toronto Dentals hockey team include Stan Brown, Bert McCaffrey, Glenn Smith, Rod Smylie, Charles Stewart and Harry Watson.

== Curriculum ==
The Faculty offers a number of programs. The undergraduate programs include a four-year internationally recognized dental degree Doctor of Dental Surgery (DDS), and an International Dentist Advanced Placement Program (IDAPP). Graduate studies programs include MSc or PhD with a research option or in one of ten dental specialty training options, including Dental Anesthesia, Dental Public Health, Endodontics, Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology, Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology and/or Oral Medicine, Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics, Paediatric Dentistry, Periodontics, and Prosthodontics. Approximately 13 yearly residencies for the dental specialty training are available at several of Toronto&#x27;s teaching hospitals, namely The Hospital for Sick Children, Mount Sinai Hospital, and Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre. The Faculty also hosts ongoing onsite and online courses and workshops for dental professionals through their Continuing Dental Education unit.

== Research ==
The Faculty of Dentistry has various research foci, including Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering, Connective Tissues and Regenerative Medicine, Dental Public Health, Education Research, Microbiology, Oral Pathology and Cancer, and Pain and Neuroscience. In addition, the Faculty of Dentistry, in collaboration with the Faculty of Medicine and the Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering, has established the world-renowned Institute of Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering (IBBME).

===Imaging research facility===
In 2019, the Faculty of Dentistry opened the Collaborative Advanced Microscopy Laboratories of Dentistry (Camilod), an imaging facility available to researchers in the Toronto area.

<text>Cockburn Sound () is an inlet of the Indian Ocean on the coast of Western Australia. It extends from the south of the mouth of the Swan River at Fremantle for about to Point Peron near Rockingham. The total area of the sound is about .

It is bounded on the east by the mainland council areas of Fremantle, Cockburn, Kwinana and Rockingham, on the west by Garden Island and Carnac Island, and includes several rocky outcrops and reefs. Gage Roads lies to the north.

The sound was named in 1827 by Captain James Stirling, probably after Admiral Sir George Cockburn.

The Perth Seawater Desalination Plant can be found here.

== Water pollution ==
Several media reports have been made on pollution of the water in Cockburn Sound, where in late 2015 an estimated 2,100 fish died as a result of algal blooms through poor local water quality.

Reports from 2010 suggest the monitoring of pollutants was not adequate, using degradation of sea-grass since 2005 as a key indicator.

Media coverage in December 2016 indicates the leaking of firefighting chemicals from the local defence base at Garden Island could be a factor, however the report was only made available in September 2016. Prior official reports indicate the water quality was improving. However, there is doubt towards the scope of the report, as it does not include factors such as thermal stress from increased water temperature and oxygen stress as a result of climate change and localised desalination.

<doc id="380983" wikidata="Q262130" url="?curid=380983" title="Richard Donner">
<text>Richard Donner (born Richard Donald Schwartzberg; April 24, 1930 – July 5, 2021) was an American film director, producer and actor. Described as &quot;one of Hollywood&#x27;s most reliable makers of action blockbusters&quot;, Donner directed some of the most financially successful films of the 1970s and 1980s. His 50-year career crossed genres and influenced trends among filmmakers across the world.

Donner began his career in 1957 as a television director. In the 1960s, he directed episodes of the series &quot;The Rifleman&quot;, &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;, &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, &quot;The Banana Splits&quot;, and many others. Donner made his film debut with the low-budget aviation drama &quot;X-15&quot; in 1961, but had his critical and commercial breakthrough with the horror film &quot;The Omen&quot; in 1976. He directed the landmark superhero film &quot;Superman&quot; in 1978, which provided an inspiration for the fantasy film genre to eventually gain artistic respectability and commercial dominance. Donner later went on to direct films in the 1980s such as &quot;The Goonies&quot; and &quot;Scrooged&quot;, while reinvigorating the buddy cop film genre with the &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; series.

Donner and his wife, Lauren, owned a production company, The Donners&#x27; Company, which is most successful for producing the &quot;Free Willy&quot; and &quot;X-Men&quot; film franchises. Donner also produced &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; and co-wrote several comic books for &quot;Superman&quot; publisher DC Comics. In 2000, Donner received the President&#x27;s Award from the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films.

==Early years==
Richard Donald Schwartzberg was born in the Bronx, New York City, to Russian Jewish parents, Hattie (Horowitz) and Fred Schwartzberg. His father owned a small furniture-manufacturing business and his mother was a housewife. He had a sister, Joan. His grandfather owned a Brooklyn movie theatre which had an early influence on his perception of film.

After graduating from high school, Donner served in the U.S. Navy, becoming an aerial photographer. He briefly attended New York University but left to pursue a career in acting, relocating to Los Angeles and adopting the stage name &quot;Richard Donner&quot;.

==Television==
Initially, Donner wanted to develop a career as an actor. He gained a big part in a television program directed by Martin Ritt, who encouraged Donner to become a director instead. Ritt hired Donner as his assistant. Later, Donner was on the staff of Desilu, where he directed commercials. He made the transition into television dramas in the late 1950s, directing some episodes of the Steve McQueen western serial &quot;Wanted Dead or Alive&quot; and the Chuck Connors western &quot;The Rifleman&quot;.

During his early career as a director he worked on over twenty-five television series, including &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot;, &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, &quot;Combat!&quot;, &quot;Get Smart&quot;, &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;, &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot;, &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;, &quot;Kojak&quot; and &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; (such as the episodes &quot;Nightmare at 20,000 Feet&quot; starring William Shatner, The Jeopardy Room starring Martin Landau and &quot;From Agnes—With Love&quot; starring Wally Cox), as well as the serial &quot;Danger Island&quot; from the children&#x27;s program &quot;The Banana Splits&quot;.

In the 1990s, Donner served as executive producer of the HBO anthology horror series &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot;, based on the EC Comics series of the same name. He directed three episodes during its run (&quot;Dig That Cat... He&#x27;s Real Gone&quot;, &quot;The Ventriloquist&#x27;s Dummy&quot;, &quot;Showdown&quot;), and also produced three feature film spinoffs; &quot;Demon Knight&quot;, &quot;Bordello of Blood&quot; and &quot;Ritual&quot;.

==Films==
Donner&#x27;s first feature film was &quot;X-15&quot; (1961), which starred David McLean, Charles Bronson and Mary Tyler Moore. Seven years passed before he directed his next, &quot;Salt and Pepper&quot; (1968), with Sammy Davis Jr. and Peter Lawford. His breakthrough film was &quot;The Omen&quot; (1976). A supernatural horror made in the wake of the success of &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, the film stars Gregory Peck, David Warner and Lee Remick. It was the fifth-highest-grossing film of 1976.

===&quot;Superman&quot; (1978)===
In 1978, Donner directed &quot;Superman: The Movie&quot;, starring Christopher Reeve in the title role. Donner approached the film with the concept of creating verisimilitude, an intuitive feeling evoked in the audience that makes the fantasy story feel real within the story&#x27;s context. It was a hit worldwide, projecting Reeve to international fame. The film co-starred Margot Kidder as Lois Lane, Marlon Brando as Jor-El and Gene Hackman as archvillain Lex Luthor. At the box office, it grossed $134 million domestically.

Principal photography of &quot;Superman&quot; included filming of its first sequel, &quot;Superman II&quot;. Donner filmed most of &quot;Superman II&quot; with the expectation he would complete the sequel after the release of &quot;Superman&quot;. Despite the first film&#x27;s success, Donner was fired from &quot;Superman II&quot;. Throughout the filming of both &quot;Superman&quot; films, Donner had a difficult relationship with executive producers Alexander Salkind and Ilya Salkind and producer Pierre Spengler. The Salkinds refused Donner&#x27;s demand that Spengler be fired; instead, the Salkinds replaced Donner as director of &quot;Superman II&quot; with Richard Lester, who had worked with the Salkinds on &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; and &quot;The Four Musketeers&quot; and as an uncredited producer on &quot;Superman&quot;. Following Donner&#x27;s dismissal, Marlon Brando&#x27;s scenes were removed from &quot;Superman II&quot; and much of the film was re-shot under Lester&#x27;s direction. Gene Hackman refused to return for re-shoots; consequently, all the Lex Luthor scenes that appear in &quot;Superman II&quot; were filmed by Donner, although Donner refused to be credited.

Rotten Tomatoes&#x27; summary states that &quot;&quot;Superman II&quot; meets, if not exceeds, the standard set by its predecessor.&quot; Donner continued to promote the view that his contribution was superior to the rest of the series. &quot;Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut&quot; was released on November 28, 2006, the same date as the DVD release of the summer film &quot;Superman Returns&quot;. This version of the film features the re-insertion of Marlon Brando&#x27;s scenes as Jor-El and relies on a minimum of footage shot by Richard Lester.

===1980s and 1990s===

Donner directed mixed commercial flops (&quot;Inside Moves&quot;, &quot;Radio Flyer&quot;) and successes (&quot;The Goonies&quot;, the &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; series, &quot;Scrooged&quot;, and &quot;Conspiracy Theory&quot;).

====&quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; (1987–1998)====
Donner&#x27;s next blockbuster film was the action comedy &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot;, written by Shane Black. It starred Mel Gibson as a widowed narcotics detective with a suicidal bent &quot;who breaks every rule for the sheer joy of it&quot;. It co-starred Danny Glover as a calm homicide detective with a loving family and consideration for retirement. The film&#x27;s action sequences were considered &quot;truly spectacular&quot; and made the film one of the year&#x27;s biggest hits.

Donner directed six films starring Mel Gibson in total, creating a &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; franchise with three sequels; the last of these was &quot;Lethal Weapon 4&quot;, released in 1998. In an interview in 2000, Gibson described his impressions of Donner:

Uncle Dick. He&#x27;s a great guy, just terrific. Extremely professional. He&#x27;s an old veteran and has an understanding of film that is the culmination of years of experience. He&#x27;s got his technical stuff down, his vision down. No matter what you say about Dick, it underrates him. He really loves what he&#x27;s doing, loves working with actors, and he allows you freedom to explore all kinds of areas. &quot;All right, kid,&quot; he&#x27;ll say, and slap you on the back and let you try something, because even he doesn&#x27;t know sometimes. He&#x27;s just an extremely charming, talented, great fuckin&#x27; guy. I love him.

====&quot;X-Men&quot;====
Donner became the executive producer for the 2000 Marvel Comics film &quot;X-Men&quot;, then also an executive producer for the 2009 &quot;X-Men&quot; prequel, &quot;X-Men Origins: Wolverine&quot;. In addition, Donner&#x27;s wife has produced all of the films in the &quot;X-Men&quot; film series under their Donners&#x27; Company brand.

On October 16, 2008, Donner and Lauren Shuler Donner received stars in a double ceremony on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for their achievements in motion pictures, located at 6712 Hollywood Boulevard.

==== Unrealized projects ====
Donner was the first choice to direct the &quot;unofficial&quot; James Bond film &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot;, but turned it down after he decided he disliked Lorenzo Semple Jr.&#x27;s script. He would have served as director of &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; had Columbia/TriStar won the bidding war for the screen rights against other studios. Donner was also considered as director for &quot;The Lost Boys&quot;, &quot;The Last Boy Scout&quot;, &quot;Memoirs of an Invisible Man&quot;, &quot;Dave&quot;, &quot;Forever Young&quot;, and &quot;The Sandlot&quot;. In 2001, Donner claimed he planned to direct a sequel to &quot;The Goonies&quot; after &quot;Timeline&quot;, and he planned to direct the fifth and final &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; film before his death in 2021.

=== Comic books ===

One of Donner&#x27;s assistants in the late 1990s was comic book writer Geoff Johns. In October 2006, Donner, Johns, and artist Adam Kubert became the new creative team on &quot;Action Comics&quot;, the publisher&#x27;s most time honored publication and one of DC Comics&#x27; two main &quot;Superman&quot; titles. Together, Johns and Donner collaborated on the stories &quot;Last Son&quot; and &quot;Escape from Bizarro World&quot;, both of which have been released in collected book form. Donner and Johns also co-wrote a story for &quot;Action Comics #1000&quot;, released in April 2018.

=== Biography ===
In 2010, Donner&#x27;s authorized biography titled &quot;You&#x27;re the Director... You Figure It Out: The Life and Films of Richard Donner&quot; by James Christie was published by BearManor Media. The book features a foreword by Mel Gibson.

&quot;Script Magazine&quot; described the book as an &quot;engaging portrait of a warm-hearted (if occasionally gruff) man who can justly be considered the modern equivalent of Victor Fleming and Michael Curtiz—a highly talented, professional director of motion pictures who has thrived in the studio system and made some pretty good pictures to boot.&quot;

The Directors Guild of America called the book &quot;a compelling study of an ebullient, ballsy risk-taker who was a director even before he was aware of it&quot; that &quot;ably captures Donner&#x27;s joy in doing a job he loves.&quot;

== Personal life and death ==
Donner married film producer Lauren Shuler on November 27, 1985. The two merged their respective production companies to create Shuler-Donner Productions (now The Donners&#x27; Company) the same year. Donner and Shuler remained together until the former&#x27;s death.

Donner was a cousin of actor Steve Kahan, who played a policeman tracking Otis in &quot;Superman: The Movie&quot;, and played Captain Ed Murphy in the &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; film franchise. Donner also cast Kahan in some of his other films.

Donner died on July 5, 2021 at his home in West Hollywood, California, at the age of 91. The cause of death was heart failure with atherosclerosis as an underlying cause.

<text>The Lingqu () is a canal in Xing&#x27;an County, near Guilin, in the northwestern corner of Guangxi, China. 

It connects the Xiang River (which flows north into the Yangtze) with the Li River (which flows south into the Gui River and Xijiang), and thus is part of a historical waterway between the Yangtze and the Pearl River Delta. It was the first canal in the world to connect two river valleys and enabled boats to travel inland from Beijing to the Pearl River Delta. It is also one of the most well-preserved such projects in the world.

The canal is long.

== History ==
In 214 BC, Qin Shi Huang, the First Emperor of the Qin dynasty (221–206 BC), ordered the construction of a canal connecting the Xiang and the Li rivers, in order to attack the Baiyue tribes in the south. The architect who designed the canal was Shi Lu (). It is the oldest contour canal in the world, receiving its water from the Xiang. It was fitted with thirty-seven flash locks by 825 AD. There is a clear description of pound locks in the twelfth century, which were probably installed one or two centuries before. The canal also aided water conservation by diverting up to a third of the flow of the Xiang to the Li.

The canal has been placed on the UNESCO World Heritage Sites tentative list.

<text>The rainbow boa (Epicrates cenchria) is a boa species endemic to Central and South America. A semi-arboreal species (not only do they climb in the wild but also proven in captivity), it is known for its attractive iridescent/holographic sheen caused by structural coloration. Five subspecies are currently recognized, including the nominate subspecies described here.

==Distribution and habitat==
The rainbow boa is found in lower Central America (Costa Rica and Panama), and farther south into South America. It occurs east of the Andes, roughly reaching northern Argentina (in the provinces Chaco, Córdoba, Corrientes, Formosa, Salta, Santiago del Estero and Tucumán).

The rainbow boa&#x27;s habitat generally consists of humid woodlands and rainforests, but it can also be found in open savannas.

== Description ==
The rainbow boa is typically orange, brown, or reddish brown, with a paler belly and black markings: three parallel stripes on the head, rings down the back, and lateral blotches with a crescent over them, although there is a great deal of natural variation that may be heightened by artificial breeding. It is 4 to 6 feet in length and sexually dimorphic, as females are slightly longer and have wider abdomens. Males are stronger when compared with females of the same length and more resistant to handling.

== Behavior ==
Rainbow boas are nocturnal and most active in the middle of the night.

This species is semi-arboreal, spending time both on the ground and in trees. They are also known to spend time in bodies of water, and are considered capable swimmers.

=== Mating habits ===

The rainbow boa reaches sexual maturity at 1.2 meters for males and 1.4 meters for females, or when they&#x27;re approximately 2.5 to 4 years old. Females need to be the correct size otherwise they could have complications during and after birth. Males can mate with multiple females which can be beneficial for reptile breeding.

==== Eating habits during breeding season ====
Males generally go without feeding during the mating season and females tend to eat smaller portions during the breeding season. In order to decrease the probability of birthing issues, females should be fed smaller rats/mice in order to save space for proper ova development.

It is not unusual for both sexes to go without eating during the mating season.

==Captivity==
The most common type of rainbow boa found in the pet trade is the Brazilian rainbow boa, &quot;E. c. cenchria&quot;. During the 1980s and early 1990s, substantial numbers were exported from Suriname. Today, however, far fewer are exported, and most offered for sale are captive bred. With good care, a captive Brazilian rainbow boa can be expected to live for up to 30 years, but most live up to 20.

==Subspecies==
==Etymology==
The subspecific names &quot;barbouri&quot; and &quot;gaigeae&quot; are in honor of American herpetologists Thomas Barbour and Helen Beulah Thompson Gaige, respectively.

<text>Blubberhouses is a small village and civil parish in the Washburn Valley in North Yorkshire, England. The population as at the 2011 Census was less than 100, so details were included in the civil parish of Fewston. In 2015, North Yorkshire County Council estimated the population of the village and parish to be 40. Blubberhouses is situated to the south of the Yorkshire Dales National Park, and to the north of a Roman road and Fewston Reservoir on the A59 road linking Harrogate to Skipton.

==History==
The name of the village derives from the Anglo-Saxon &quot;bluberhūs&quot; = &quot;the house(s) which is/are at the bubbling stream&quot;, with a later regularised plural; the &quot;-um&quot; form came from the Anglo-Saxon dative plural case &quot;æt bluberhūsum&quot; = &quot;at the houses which ...&quot;. Later forms of the name on record include &quot;Bluburgh&quot;, &quot;Bluborrow&quot;, and &quot;Bluburhouse&quot;. A forge was recorded at Blubberhouses in 1227, and in the 16th century, the village had metal smelters for lead and iron ore. The lead was mined locally around Fewston. The other major industry in the area was cloth-working with Westhouse mill being located just across the A59 road from the church. Westhouse opened in the 1790s to process flax, but closed in 1877 and the stone from the mill was used in the construction of the dam wall of Fewston Reservoir.

St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Blubberhouses was designed by Edward Buckton Lamb and was built in 1851. It is now a grade II listed building. It is part of the ecclesiastical parish of Fewston, and is maintained by the Friends of Blubberhouses Church, after it was decided to keep the church open in 2015 in spite of the need to repair the church roof at quite a cost. The village has a cricket team who play in the Theakston Nidderdale League, and their ground is alongside the River Washburn in the village.

The road through Blubberhouses, which is now the A59, running in an east/west direction, was first turnpiked in the 1770s. The section to the west of Blubberhouses towards Skipton goes over Blubberhouses Moor, and between 1823 and 1827, a new cut was made to the south with a gentler gradient, but following the contours of the hill. The 19th century section has suffered many landslips, and so a new bypass, following the route of the original turnpike, is due to open in 2025.

In July 2014, Stage 2 of the 2014 Tour de France from York to Sheffield, passed through the village. It was also the location of the first climb of the stage, the Category 4 Côte de Blubberhouses, at the point. It was long at an average gradient of 6.1%. The single point for the King of the Mountains competition was claimed by Frenchman, Cyril Lemoine of Cofidis.

Blubberhouses is used as a key setting for local composer Andy Tillison&#x27;s composition &quot;Le Sacre Du Travail&quot;, a five movement electric sinfonia recorded by the progressive rock ensemble The Tangent. The work is, according to the CD sleeve notes, loosely based around Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Le Sacre Du Printemps&quot; (&quot;The Rite Of Spring&quot;). One section of the second movement is named &quot;Dawn At Blubberhouses&quot; and the village is mentioned by name in the lyrics/libretto. A short story in the CD sleeve describes the journey of a man travelling to work through the village in the small hours of the morning. The CD album was released in 2013 by the German record label Inside Out Music.

== Governance ==
There is no record of Blubberhouses in the Domesday Book, but it is recorded in 1172 as &quot;Bluberh(o)usum&quot;, being in the lower division of the wapentake of Claro in the West Riding of Yorkshire. It is now in the county of North Yorkshire. At the 1901 census, the size of the parish was recorded as , and in 2021, it was listed as reaching to . The village and parish is represented at Parliament as part of the Skipton and Ripon Constituency. In 2011, the population was estimated to be 30, which by 2015, had risen to 40.

<text>Clifton Chenier (June 25, 1925 – December 12, 1987), was an American musician known as a pioneer of zydeco, a style of music that arose from Creole music, with R&amp;B, blues, and Cajun influences. He sang and played the accordion. Chenier won a Grammy Award in 1983.

Chenier was known as the King of Zydeco, and also billed as the King of the South.

==Biography==
Chenier was a native of Leonville, Louisiana, near Opelousas. He spoke Louisiana French as a first language.

Chenier was exposed to music growing up, as he accompanied his father, Joseph Chenier, a farmer and player of the single-row diatonic accordion, to dances. His uncle, Morris Chenier, played fiddle. Musical influences that he cited from radio were Muddy Waters, Peetie Wheatstraw, and Lightning Hopkins, while local influences included Creole musicians Claude Faulk, Jesse and ZoZo Reynolds, and Sidney Babineaux. Clifton began playing accordion around 1947, and by 1950 was playing in a club in Basile with his brother Cleveland Chenier on rubboard. Before launching a professional music career, Chenier worked in fields and at a Gulf Oil refinery in Port Arthur, Texas, outside of whose gates he also played music with Cleveland.

Chenier began his recording career in 1954, when he signed with Elko Records and released &quot;Cliston Blues&quot; [sic], a regional success. Imperial Records picked up and reissued the single and Chenier cut four more sides for their &quot;Post&quot; subsidiary. These early sides were credited to Cliston Chanier. In 1955, he signed with Specialty Records and garnered his first national hit with his label debut &quot;Eh, &#x27;tite Fille&quot; (&quot;Hey, Little Girl&quot;, a cover of Professor Longhair&#x27;s song). The release&#x27;s national success led to numerous tours with popular rhythm and blues performers such as Ray Charles, Etta James, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, T-Bone Walker, and Lowell Fulson. He also toured in the early days with Clarence Garlow, billed as the Two Crazy Frenchmen. Chenier was signed with Chess Records in Chicago, followed by the Arhoolie label in the early 1960s. Arhoolie gave Chenier exposure to new audiences of blues and rock listeners across the US.

In April 1966, Chenier appeared at the Berkeley Blues Festival on the University of California campus and was subsequently described by Ralph J. Gleason, jazz critic of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, as &quot;one of the most surprising musicians I have heard in some time, with a marvelously moving style of playing the accordion ... blues accordion, that&#x27;s right, blues accordion.&quot; Over time, the band expanded to include saxophone and organ, and electric effects pedals, with all melody instruments taking turns at solos.

Chenier was the first act to play at Antone&#x27;s, a blues club on Sixth Street in Austin, Texas. In 1976, he reached a national audience by appearing on the first season of the PBS music program &quot;Austin City Limits&quot;. In 1979 he returned to the show with his Red Hot Louisiana Band.

Chenier&#x27;s popularity peaked in the 1980s, and he was recognized with a Grammy Award in 1983 for his album &quot;I&#x27;m Here!&quot; It was the first Grammy for his new label Alligator Records. Chenier followed Queen Ida as the second Louisiana Creole to win a Grammy.

Chenier is credited with redesigning the wood and crimped tin washboard into the &quot;vest frottoir&quot;, an instrument that easily hung from the shoulders. He sketched his idea for a metalworker in Port Arthur named Willie Landry, who made the first frottoir. Cleveland Chenier, Clifton&#x27;s older brother, also played in the Red Hot Louisiana Band. He found popularity for his ability to manipulate the distinctive sound of the frottoir by rubbing several bottle openers (held in each hand) along its ridges.

During their prime, Chenier and his band traveled throughout the world.

==Later years and death==
Chenier suffered from diabetes, which eventually forced him to have a foot amputated and required dialysis because of associated kidney problems.

He died of diabetes-related kidney disease in December 1987 in Lafayette, Louisiana. His funeral took place at Immaculate Heart of Mary Church in Lafayette.

==Legacy and tributes==
Since 1987, his son C. J. Chenier (born Clayton Joseph Thompson) has carried on the zydeco tradition by touring with Chenier&#x27;s band and recording albums. Clifton Chenier&#x27;s bandmate and protégé Buckwheat Zydeco achieved national success playing the piano accordion.

Paul Simon mentioned Chenier in his song &quot;That Was Your Mother&quot; on his 1986 album &quot;Graceland&quot;, calling him the &quot;King of the Bayou.&quot; Rory Gallagher wrote a song in tribute to Chenier, &quot;The King of Zydeco&quot; on his last studio album &quot;Fresh Evidence&quot; (1990). Sonny Landreth recalls growing up on the rhythm of Clifton and Cleveland and the Red Hot Louisiana Band in &quot;South of I-10&quot;, song title and name of the album released in 1995. John Mellencamp refers to &quot;Clifton&quot; in his song &quot;Lafayette&quot;, about the Louisiana city where Chenier often performed, on Mellencamp&#x27;s 2003 album &quot;Trouble No More&quot;. Zachary Richard mentions Chenier in his song &quot;Clif&#x27;s Zydeco&quot; (on Richard&#x27;s 2012 album &quot;Le Fou&quot;). The Squeezebox Stompers&#x27; &quot;Zydeco Train&quot; says, &quot;Clifton Chenier, he&#x27;s the engineer.&quot;

The jam band Phish often covers Chenier&#x27;s song &quot;My Soul&quot; in live performances.

Chenier is the subject of Les Blank&#x27;s 1973 documentary film &quot;Hot Pepper&quot;.

==Awards and honors==
Chenier received a 1984 National Heritage Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts, the U.S. government&#x27;s highest honor in folk and traditional arts. He was inducted posthumously into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1989, and the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame in 2011. In 2014, he received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.

In 2016, the Library of Congress deemed Chenier&#x27;s album &quot;Bogalusa Boogie&quot; to be &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; and selected it for preservation in the National Recording Registry.

<doc id="381006" wikidata="Q7449276" url="?curid=381006" title="Semi-Tough">
<text>Semi-Tough is a 1977 American sports comedy film directed by Michael Ritchie and starring Burt Reynolds, Kris Kristofferson, Jill Clayburgh, Robert Preston, Lotte Lenya, and Bert Convy. It is set in the world of American professional football.

The plot involves a love triangle between the characters portrayed by Reynolds, Kristofferson, and Clayburgh. &quot;Semi-Tough&quot; also includes a parody of Werner Erhard&#x27;s Erhard Seminars Training (&quot;est&quot;), depicted in the film as an organization called &quot;B.E.A.T.&quot;.

The film is based on the 1972 novel of the same name by Dan Jenkins. It was adapted for the screen by writer Walter Bernstein and director Ritchie, who added a new storyline that included a satire of the self-help movement and new religions.

&quot;Semi-Tough&quot; follows the story of pro football friends Billy Clyde Puckett and Marvin &quot;Shake&quot; Tiller, who have a third roommate, Barbara Jane Bookman. A romance develops between Shake and Barbara Jane when he becomes self-confident after completing a self awareness course called &quot;B.E.A.T.&quot;, at which point Billy Clyde slyly makes a play to win her for himself.

The film received mixed receptions. Some reviewers praised its parodies of the est training, Erhard and other new age movements such as Rolfing. Others criticized the script and direction, noting that some of director Ritchie&#x27;s previous films had more of a personal tone. Still other reviews lamented the film&#x27;s departure from the novel &quot;Semi-Tough&quot;, which dealt with football rather than the new age movement.

==Plot==
Wide receiver Marvin &quot;Shake&quot; Tiller and running back Billy Clyde Puckett are football buddies who play for a Miami pro team owned by &quot;Big Ed&quot; Bookman. Bookman&#x27;s daughter Barbara Jane is roommates with both men, and the film depicts a subtle love triangle relationship developing between Barbara Jane and her two friends. Initially the three of them are just good friends, but she begins to have romantic feelings for Shake, who has become more self-confident after taking self-improvement training from seminar leader Friedrich Bismark. The program is called Bismark Energy Action Training, or B.E.A.T. After Shake completes his course, Barbara Jane and he have sex and start a relationship. They plan to marry after the football season ends.

Barbara Jane is not a follower of B.E.A.T., and Shake is warned by his leader Bismark that &quot;mixed marriages don&#x27;t work&quot;. Barbara Jane is determined to make it work, so she attends B.E.A.T. in an effort to &quot;get it&quot;. At the end of the long training session, she is worn out from Bismark&#x27;s &quot;sadistic abuse, pious drivel, and sheer double talk&quot;. She also feels guilty that she did not &quot;get it&quot;. Shake is insistent that the training has had proven results for him, noting that he has not dropped a football pass since completing B.E.A.T.

Billy Clyde also has feelings for Barbara Jane and, without telling Shake or Barbara Jean beforehand, enrolls in the same B.E.A.T. training session as Barbara Jane in order to understand what she is going through. In the training, Billy Clyde is shown coping successfully with the seminar rules that prohibit going to the bathroom or talking to other trainees. When the trainees are encouraged to express their most repressed feelings, he exhibits the strongest, most primal display of them all. Shake is surprised to see Billy Clyde emerge from Barbara Jane&#x27;s B.E.A.T. training session. Billy Clyde &quot;confesses&quot; to Shake that he took the training so that he&#x27;d be able to mock it more effectively afterwards, but says that he actually &quot;got it&quot;. For a time, he pretends he underwent a conversion to Bismark&#x27;s way of thinking, often using B.E.A.T. terminology and clichés in everyday conversation.

Shake worries that Barbara Jane hasn&#x27;t &quot;gotten it&quot;, and Billy Clyde tries to reassure Shake that it doesn&#x27;t matter, but Shake remains dubious. During the wedding, as Big Ed escorts Barbara Jane to the altar, the minister turns to Bismark and gives him some advice on how he can avoid capital gains tax in his business. When the minister asks Shake if he takes Barbara Jane to be his wife, he hesitates and finally says &quot;no&quot;. An outraged Big Ed vows to trade Shake to the worst team in the league, then tells Bismark to &quot;experience this&quot; as he punches him in the face, starting a general brawl. Billy Clyde makes a disparaging remark about Bismark to Barbara Jane, causing her to realize that he had been sandbagging all along about having &quot;gotten it&quot; from B.E.A.T. The two of them leave in the commotion, and reveal their feelings about each other as they walk along the beach in their wedding attire.

==Production==

===Adaptation===
&quot;Semi-Tough&quot; is based on the best-selling novel of the same name by Dan Jenkins, and the screenplay was written by Walter Bernstein. Bernstein and director Michael Ritchie used parts of Jenkins&#x27;s novel and added parodies of self-help groups, new religions, and the Human Potential Movement. Ritchie was partially influenced by Adam Smith&#x27;s book, &quot;Powers of Mind&quot;. Though the screenplay altered his original work, Dan Jenkins wrote that &quot;Semi-Tough&quot; &quot;wasn&#x27;t a horrible movie in my opinion&quot;. Jenkins later commented that the film adaptation of his book &quot;Baja Oklahoma &quot; was: &quot;a lot more faithful to the novel than &quot;Semi-Tough&quot; ever was&quot;.

===Preparation===
Burt Reynolds began training with Kris Kristofferson to get in shape before film production. Before work began on the film, actor Bert Convy attended one of Werner Erhard&#x27;s est training sessions to prepare for his role as B.E.A.T. seminar leader Friedrich Bismark. Pro football stars were hired to give realism to the film, including John Matuszak, Paul Hornung, Joe Kapp, and Ed &quot;Too Tall&quot; Jones. The football scenes were shot at the Cotton Bowl.

== Parodies of self-improvement, new religions ==
Bernstein and Ritchie&#x27;s modified screenplay based on Jenkins&#x27; book includes a storyline with &quot;satiric jabs&quot; at new religions, self-improvement, and the Human Potential Movement. A form of Rolfing is also parodied in the film by Lotte Lenya, whose character Clara Pelf is seen as a spoof of &quot;a Rolf-like masseuse&quot;. Big Ed Bookman is seen crawling around on all fours practicing something called &quot;creep therapy&quot; or &quot;movagenics&quot;. Movagenics is seen in the film as a way for individuals to find their &quot;lost center of consciousness&quot;. Big Ed Bookman is also shown proselytizing for &quot;Movagenics&quot;, a fictional group in the film which &quot;TIME&quot; referred to in its review as both a cult and a new faith.

The film includes a parody with B.E.A.T. as a stand-in for est . In &quot;American Film Now&quot;, Friedrich Bismark is simply described as &quot;the Werner Erhard character&quot;. &quot;The Grove Book of Hollywood&quot; describes Bert Convy as a &quot;Werner Erhard-lookalike&quot;, in his portrayal of Friedrich Bismark. Barbara Jane Bookman&#x27;s guilty feelings for not &quot;getting it&quot; after completing her B.E.A.T. seminar are seen as a reference to: &quot;how creeds like est put nonbelievers on the defensive&quot;. The book also notes: &quot;The film captures the peculiar mixture of spirituality and pragmatism that surrounded est&quot;, and also describes the minister&#x27;s capital gains tax advice to Friedrich Bismark at Shake&#x27;s wedding as &quot;sardonic&quot;. A 1977 review in &quot;TIME&quot; refers to Friedrich Bismark&#x27;s B.E.A.T. as &quot;an est-like movement&quot;, and notes: &quot;the Ritchie-Bernstein version of an est seminar is done with marvelous malice&quot;. &quot;Psychiatry and the Cinema&quot; characterizes the film as a &quot;devastating parody&quot; of the est training.

After &quot;Semi-Tough&quot;&#x27;s release in 1977, Bert Convy was contacted by a number of est followers, as well as by Werner Erhard. After Convy appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; and discussed his experiences attending Erhard Seminars Training in preparation for his role as Friedrich Bismark, he received a letter from Erhard stating: &quot;it would be great for us to get together&quot;. Of the est seminar itself, Convy recalled that when another attendee complained of a headache during the course, the group leader told him to &quot;experience it&quot;, and when another attendee wet his pants, he was told to &quot;experience the warmth&quot;. In a scene from the film, a woman exclaims to Friedrich Bismark in the middle of a seminar: &quot;I peed in my pants and it felt &quot;good.&quot;&quot; During actual filming on &quot;Semi-Tough&quot;, Convy received a late-night phone call from actress Valerie Harper, known in Hollywood as a devoted student of Werner Erhard. She related to Convy that Erhard was &quot;pleased&quot; with the role, and she wished him success in the film. Convy suspected that her real reason for calling was to subtly pressure him to go easy on his parody of Erhard in the film. Harper is mentioned by name in the completed film.

==Reception==

===Box office and releases===
The film grossed $37,187,139 at the box office. &quot;Semi-Tough&quot; was later developed as a short-lived television series with a similar theme, and was a candidate to be picked up in the fall of 1980. The 1980 series starred Bruce McGill playing Burt Reynolds&#x27; original role, with co-star David Hasselhoff. The film has since been released in both VHS and DVD formats.

===Awards===
In 1978, Walter Bernstein received a nomination for a WGA Award from the Writers Guild of America in the &quot;Best Comedy Adapted from Another Medium&quot; category, for his adaptation of Dan Jenkins&#x27; novel.

===Critical reception===

The press disagreed on the satire of Erhard in the film, some praising it, some not. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; criticized the film, save for its satirical nature: &quot;The movie isn&#x27;t much - an erratic ramble - but it has some pleasant moments, and a delicious send-up of the self-improvement guru Werner Erhard.&quot; &quot;The Charlotte Observer&quot; praised Bert Convy&#x27;s portrayal of the self-help guru Frederick Bismark, and called Convy: &quot;… a hilariously smug consciousness-raiser with a more than passing resemblance to EST&#x27;s [sic] Werner Erhard&quot;. &quot;Magill&#x27;s Survey of Cinema&quot; described the film as a chiding of American &quot;religious fads and philosophies&quot;, and &quot;The Grove Book of Hollywood&quot; called it a &quot;cheeky film&quot; that poked fun at the &quot;est&quot; craze and other human potential fads. &quot;TIME&quot; called the film one of 1977&#x27;s best comedies, and also noted that it was: &quot;without a doubt the year&#x27;s most socially useful film&quot;.

The film did not receive a positive review in &quot;Variety&quot;, where the reviewer commented: &quot;&quot;Semi-Tough&quot; begins as a bawdy and lively romantic comedy about slap-happy pro football players, then slows down to a too-inside putdown of contemporary self-help programs.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; noted that stars Burt Reynolds, Kris Kristofferson, and Jill Clayburgh were &quot;excellent&quot; within the &quot;zigzag&quot; script and poor direction they were given. Michael Costello of &quot;Allmovie&quot; also criticized the script, and wrote: &quot;While much of this is quite predictable, a number of the jokes score, Burt Reynolds works his charm overtime, and Jill Clayburgh and Kris Kristofferson are effective as comic foils.&quot; In &quot;American Film Now&quot;, author James Monaco commented on director Michael Ritchie&#x27;s directing style in &quot;Semi-Tough&quot;, stating that in the film Ritchie was &quot;speaking in a professional voice&quot;. Monaco noted that Ritchie&#x27;s prior films evoked a more personal tone, and had more of a sense of wonder than &quot;Semi-Tough&quot;.

Chapman&#x27;s &quot;In Search of Stupidity&quot; characterized the film as: &quot;Possibly one of the best movies ever made by Burt Reynolds&quot;, and described the film&#x27;s parody of est as accurate and amusing. Leonard Maltin criticized parts of the script, stating that Reynolds&#x27; charm filled in for the film&#x27;s other deficiencies. Hunsberger criticized Ritchie&#x27;s screenplay adaptation in his work &quot;The Quintessential Dictionary&quot;, complaining that the game of football should have supported the film as a plot device, but was instead left to the side in favor of other stories.

<doc id="381007" wikidata="Q7248139" url="?curid=381007" title="Professor Chronotis">
<text>Professor Urban Chronotis is a fictional character created by Douglas Adams. He was originally created for the 1979 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;Shada&quot;, starring Tom Baker and Lalla Ward. However, the filming of the serial was never completed due to a strike. Adams then re-used the character and many of the themes from &quot;Shada&quot; in his novel &quot;Dirk Gently&#x27;s Holistic Detective Agency&quot;, first published in 1987. In both versions, Chronotis is a clandestine time-traveller, whose time machine (or TARDIS, as they are termed in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;) is disguised as his college rooms.

==Shada==
In 1992, &quot;Shada&quot; was completed through the use of linking narration by Tom Baker and released on home video. In this version, the character was played by Denis Carey.

In 2003, &quot;Shada&quot; was remade as an animated webcast by Big Finish Productions for the BBC. Professor Chronotis was played by James Fox in this version, which was also released as an audio play on CD.

Chronotis holds the post of Regius Professor of Chronology at Cambridge University. He is also a Fellow of the fictional St. Cedd&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he has resided for three centuries. In &quot;Shada&quot;, Chronotis is a retired Time Lord and old friend of the Doctor, living out his remaining centuries in academic seclusion. His unnaturally long life goes un-discussed by his colleagues, owing to the discretion he claims is a hallmark of the old Cambridge colleges. Owing to repeated time travel and advanced age, he is extremely forgetful and absent-minded. He often does not remember which period he has travelled to nor the reason why. He has a liking for tea and silly jokes. It is also revealed during the course of &quot;Shada&quot; that Chronotis was a Time Lord criminal named Salyavin, who was falsely imprisoned on and escaped from the prison planetoid Shada.

Despite his innocence, the Time Lords attempted to imprison Salyavin in Shada for fear of him using his unique mind powers to take over Gallifrey. Salyavin escaped by using his mind powers to control the guards escorting him. Salyavin escapes with his TARDIS, disguised as a bookmark. Shortly after escaping Shada, he used his powers to remove all memory of Shada from every Time Lord. In doing so, he is forced to regenerate, and take the name of Chronotis.

==Dirk Gently==
The &quot;Dirk Gently&quot; version of the character is almost identical to the &quot;Shada&quot; version, though the novel contains no references to Time Lords. Here Chronotis is so old and forgetful that he has no idea who or what he originally was, though he has vague memories of Cleopatra (who he claims wore outrageous earrings and reeked of cat food and death), and believes that he achieved his position after his retirement from &quot;something pretty good&quot;. He is known as &quot;Reg&quot;, short for Regius Professor Chronotis.

His Chair of Chronology was created by mad king George III who was terrified that if time were to start flowing backwards, all the bad experiences of his life might recur. In fact, central to the book&#x27;s theme are the three questions the King asked Reg upon his appointment: if one could travel through time, if there was a reason one thing happened after another, and if there was any way of stopping it (the answers are, in order, yes, no and maybe), Reg apparently promptly realising the answer to the three questions and concluding that he could then take time off in reasonable comfort. However, at the conclusion of the novel his time machine was burned out when the phone repair man fixed Reg&#x27;s telephone so that it would never go wrong again; for some reason the phone always malfunctioned whenever Reg used the time machine due to there being something fundamentally inexplicable about the British telephone system.

In 2007, &quot;Dirk Gently&#x27;s Holistic Detective Agency&quot; was adapted to radio and Professor Chronotis was portrayed by Andrew Sachs (who had previously played Skagra in the Big Finish audio/BBC webcast version of Shada).

<doc id="381010" wikidata="Q17019511" url="?curid=381010" title="Group algebra of a locally compact group">
<text>In functional analysis and related areas of mathematics, the group algebra is any of various constructions to assign to a locally compact group an operator algebra (or more generally a Banach algebra), such that representations of the algebra are related to representations of the group. As such, they are similar to the group ring associated to a discrete group.

== The algebra &quot;Cc&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) of continuous functions with compact support==
If &quot;G&quot; is a locally compact Hausdorff group, &quot;G&quot; carries an essentially unique left-invariant countably additive Borel measure &quot;μ&quot; called a Haar measure. Using the Haar measure, one can define a convolution operation on the space &quot;Cc&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) of complex-valued continuous functions on &quot;G&quot; with compact support; &quot;Cc&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) can then be given any of various norms and the completion will be a group algebra.

To define the convolution operation, let &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; be two functions in &quot;Cc&quot;(&quot;G&quot;). For &quot;t&quot; in &quot;G&quot;, define

:formula_1

The fact that formula_2 is continuous is immediate from the dominated convergence theorem. Also

:formula_3

where the dot stands for the product in &quot;G&quot;. &quot;Cc&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) also has a natural involution defined by:

:formula_4

where Δ is the modular function on &quot;G&quot;. With this involution, it is a *-algebra.

Theorem. With the norm:

:formula_5

&quot;Cc&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) becomes an involutive normed algebra with an approximate identity.

The approximate identity can be indexed on a neighborhood basis of the identity consisting of compact sets. Indeed, if &quot;V&quot; is a compact neighborhood of the identity, let &quot;fV&quot; be a non-negative continuous function supported in &quot;V&quot; such that

:formula_6

Then {&quot;fV&quot;}&quot;V&quot; is an approximate identity. A group algebra has an identity, as opposed to just an approximate identity, if and only if the topology on the group is the discrete topology.

Note that for discrete groups, &quot;Cc&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) is the same thing as the complex group ring C[&quot;G&quot;].

The importance of the group algebra is that it captures the unitary representation theory of &quot;G&quot; as shown in the following

Theorem. Let &quot;G&quot; be a locally compact group. If &quot;U&quot; is a strongly continuous unitary representation of &quot;G&quot; on a Hilbert space &quot;H&quot;, then

: formula_7

is a non-degenerate bounded *-representation of the normed algebra &quot;Cc&quot;(&quot;G&quot;). The map

: formula_8

is a bijection between the set of strongly continuous unitary representations of &quot;G&quot; and non-degenerate bounded *-representations of &quot;Cc&quot;(&quot;G&quot;). This bijection respects unitary equivalence and strong containment. In particular, &quot;U&quot; is irreducible if and only if &quot;U&quot; is irreducible.

Non-degeneracy of a representation of &quot;Cc&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) on a Hilbert space &quot;H&quot; means that

:formula_9

is dense in &quot;H&quot;.

== The convolution algebra &quot;L&quot;1(&quot;G&quot;) ==
It is a standard theorem of measure theory that the completion of &quot;Cc&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) in the &quot;L&quot;1(&quot;G&quot;) norm is isomorphic to the space &quot;L&quot;1(&quot;G&quot;) of equivalence classes of functions which are integrable with respect to the Haar measure, where, as usual, two functions are regarded as equivalent if and only if they differ only on a set of Haar measure zero.

Theorem. &quot;L&quot;1(&quot;G&quot;) is a Banach *-algebra with the convolution product and involution defined above and with the &quot;L&quot;1 norm. &quot;L&quot;1(&quot;G&quot;) also has a bounded approximate identity.

=== The group C*-algebra &quot;C*&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) ===
Let C[&quot;G&quot;] be the group ring of a discrete group &quot;G&quot;.

For a locally compact group &quot;G&quot;, the group C*-algebra &quot;C*&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) of &quot;G&quot; is defined to be the C*-enveloping algebra of &quot;L&quot;1(&quot;G&quot;), i.e. the completion of &quot;Cc&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) with respect to the largest C*-norm:

:formula_10

where ranges over all non-degenerate *-representations of &quot;Cc&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) on Hilbert spaces. When &quot;G&quot; is discrete, it follows from the triangle inequality that, for any such , one has:

:formula_11

hence the norm is well-defined.

It follows from the definition that, when G is a discrete group, &quot;C*&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) has the following universal property: any *-homomorphism from C[&quot;G&quot;] to some B(&quot;H&quot;) (the C*-algebra of bounded operators on some Hilbert space &quot;H&quot;) factors through the inclusion map:

:formula_12

== The reduced group C*-algebra &quot;Cr*&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) ==
The reduced group C*-algebra &quot;Cr*&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) is the completion of &quot;Cc&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) with respect to the norm

:formula_13

where

:formula_14

is the &quot;L&quot;2 norm. Since the completion of &quot;Cc&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) with regard to the &quot;L&quot;2 norm is a Hilbert space, the &quot;Cr*&quot; norm is the norm of the bounded operator acting on &quot;L&quot;2(&quot;G&quot;) by convolution with &quot;f&quot; and thus a C*-norm.

Equivalently, &quot;Cr*&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) is the C*-algebra generated by the image of the left regular representation on &quot;ℓ&quot;2(&quot;G&quot;).

In general, &quot;Cr*&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) is a quotient of &quot;C*&quot;(&quot;G&quot;). The reduced group C*-algebra is isomorphic to the non-reduced group C*-algebra defined above if and only if &quot;G&quot; is amenable.

== von Neumann algebras associated to groups ==
The group von Neumann algebra &quot;W*&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) of &quot;G&quot; is the enveloping von Neumann algebra of &quot;C*&quot;(&quot;G&quot;).

For a discrete group &quot;G&quot;, we can consider the Hilbert space ℓ2(&quot;G&quot;) for which &quot;G&quot; is an orthonormal basis. Since &quot;G&quot; operates on ℓ2(&quot;G&quot;) by permuting the basis vectors, we can identify the complex group ring C[&quot;G&quot;] with a subalgebra of the algebra of bounded operators on ℓ2(&quot;G&quot;). The weak closure of this subalgebra, &quot;NG&quot;, is a von Neumann algebra.

The center of &quot;NG&quot; can be described in terms of those elements of &quot;G&quot; whose conjugacy class is finite. In particular, if the identity element of &quot;G&quot; is the only group element with that property (that is, &quot;G&quot; has the infinite conjugacy class property), the center of &quot;NG&quot; consists only of complex multiples of the identity.

&quot;NG&quot; is isomorphic to the hyperfinite type II1 factor if and only if &quot;G&quot; is countable, amenable, and has the infinite conjugacy class property.

<text>In mathematics, the support of a real-valued function formula_1 is the subset of the function domain of elements that are not mapped to zero. If the domain of formula_1 is a topological space, then the support of formula_1 is instead defined as the smallest closed set containing all points not mapped to zero. This concept is used widely in mathematical analysis.

==Formulation==

Suppose that formula_4 is a real-valued function whose domain is an arbitrary set formula_5 The of formula_6 written formula_7 is the set of points in formula_8 where formula_1 is non-zero:
formula_10

The support of formula_1 is the smallest subset of formula_8 with the property that formula_1 is zero on the subset&#x27;s complement. If formula_14 for all but a finite number of points formula_15 then formula_1 is said to have .

If the set formula_8 has an additional structure (for example, a topology), then the support of formula_1 is defined in an analogous way as the smallest subset of formula_8 of an appropriate type such that formula_1 vanishes in an appropriate sense on its complement. The notion of support also extends in a natural way to functions taking values in more general sets than formula_21 and to other objects, such as measures or distributions.

==Closed support==

The most common situation occurs when formula_8 is a topological space (such as the real line or formula_23-dimensional Euclidean space) and formula_4 is a continuous real- (or complex-) valued function. In this case, the of formula_1, formula_26, or the of formula_1, is defined topologically as the closure (taken in formula_8) of the subset of formula_8 where formula_1 is non-zero that is,
formula_31Since the intersection of closed sets is closed, formula_26 is the intersection of all closed sets that contain the set-theoretic support of formula_33 Note that if the function formula_34 is defined on an open subset formula_35, then the closure is still taken with respect to formula_8 and not with respect to the ambient formula_37.

For example, if formula_38 is the function defined by
formula_39
then formula_26, the support of formula_1, or the closed support of formula_1, is the closed interval formula_43 since formula_1 is non-zero on the open interval formula_45 and the closure of this set is formula_46

The notion of closed support is usually applied to continuous functions, but the definition makes sense for arbitrary real or complex-valued functions on a topological space, and some authors do not require that formula_4 (or formula_48) be continuous.

==Compact support==

Functions with &#x27; on a topological space formula_8 are those whose closed support is a compact subset of formula_5 If formula_8 is the real line, or formula_23-dimensional Euclidean space, then a function has compact support if and only if it has &#x27;, since a subset of formula_53 is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded.

For example, the function formula_38 defined above is a continuous function with compact support formula_46 If formula_56 is a smooth function then because formula_1 is identically formula_58 on the open subset formula_59 all of formula_1&#x27;s partial derivatives of all orders are also identically formula_58 on formula_62 

The condition of compact support is stronger than the condition of vanishing at infinity. For example, the function formula_38 defined by
formula_64
vanishes at infinity, since formula_65 as formula_66 but its support formula_21 is not compact.

Real-valued compactly supported smooth functions on a Euclidean space are called bump functions. Mollifiers are an important special case of bump functions as they can be used in distribution theory to create sequences of smooth functions approximating nonsmooth (generalized) functions, via convolution.

In good cases, functions with compact support are dense in the space of functions that vanish at infinity, but this property requires some technical work to justify in a given example. As an intuition for more complex examples, and in the language of limits, for any formula_68 any function formula_1 on the real line formula_21 that vanishes at infinity can be approximated by choosing an appropriate compact subset formula_71 of formula_21 such that
formula_73
for all formula_15 where formula_75 is the indicator function of formula_76 Every continuous function on a compact topological space has compact support since every closed subset of a compact space is indeed compact.

==Essential support==

If formula_8 is a topological measure space with a Borel measure formula_78 (such as formula_79 or a Lebesgue measurable subset of formula_79 equipped with Lebesgue measure), then one typically identifies functions that are equal formula_78-almost everywhere. In that case, the of a measurable function formula_4 written formula_83 is defined to be the smallest closed subset formula_84 of formula_8 such that formula_86 formula_78-almost everywhere outside formula_88 Equivalently, formula_89 is the complement of the largest open set on which formula_86 formula_78-almost everywhere
formula_92

The essential support of a function formula_1 depends on the measure formula_78 as well as on formula_6 and it may be strictly smaller than the closed support. For example, if formula_96 is the Dirichlet function that is formula_58 on irrational numbers and formula_98 on rational numbers, and formula_99 is equipped with Lebesgue measure, then the support of formula_1 is the entire interval formula_101 but the essential support of formula_1 is empty, since formula_1 is equal almost everywhere to the zero function.

In analysis one nearly always wants to use the essential support of a function, rather than its closed support, when the two sets are different, so formula_89 is often written simply as formula_26 and referred to as the support.

==Generalization==

If formula_106 is an arbitrary set containing zero, the concept of support is immediately generalizable to functions formula_107 Support may also be defined for any algebraic structure with identity (such as a group, monoid, or composition algebra), in which the identity element assumes the role of zero. For instance, the family formula_108 of functions from the natural numbers to the integers is the uncountable set of integer sequences. The subfamily formula_109 is the countable set of all integer sequences that have only finitely many nonzero entries.

Functions of finite support are used in defining algebraic structures such as group rings and free abelian groups.

==In probability and measure theory==
In probability theory, the support of a probability distribution can be loosely thought of as the closure of the set of possible values of a random variable having that distribution. There are, however, some subtleties to consider when dealing with general distributions defined on a sigma algebra, rather than on a topological space.

More formally, if formula_110 is a random variable on formula_111 then the support of formula_8 is the smallest closed set formula_113 such that formula_114

In practice however, the support of a discrete random variable formula_8 is often defined as the set formula_116 and the support of a continuous random variable formula_8 is defined as the set formula_118 where formula_119 is a probability density function of formula_8 (the set-theoretic support). 

Note that the word can refer to the logarithm of the likelihood of a probability density function.

==Support of a distribution==

It is possible also to talk about the support of a distribution, such as the Dirac delta function formula_121 on the real line. In that example, we can consider test functions formula_122 which are smooth functions with support not including the point formula_123 Since formula_124 (the distribution formula_125 applied as linear functional to formula_84) is formula_58 for such functions, we can say that the support of formula_125 is formula_129 only. Since measures (including probability measures) on the real line are special cases of distributions, we can also speak of the support of a measure in the same way.

Suppose that formula_1 is a distribution, and that formula_131 is an open set in Euclidean space such that, for all test functions formula_132 such that the support of formula_132 is contained in formula_134 formula_135 Then formula_1 is said to vanish on formula_137 Now, if formula_1 vanishes on an arbitrary family formula_139 of open sets, then for any test function formula_132 supported in formula_141 a simple argument based on the compactness of the support of formula_132 and a partition of unity shows that formula_143 as well. Hence we can define the of formula_1 as the complement of the largest open set on which formula_1 vanishes. For example, the support of the Dirac delta is formula_146

==Singular support==

In Fourier analysis in particular, it is interesting to study the of a distribution. This has the intuitive interpretation as the set of points at which a distribution .

For example, the Fourier transform of the Heaviside step function can, up to constant factors, be considered to be formula_147 (a function) at formula_148 While formula_149 is clearly a special point, it is more precise to say that the transform of the distribution has singular support formula_129: it cannot accurately be expressed as a function in relation to test functions with support including formula_123 It be expressed as an application of a Cauchy principal value integral.

For distributions in several variables, singular supports allow one to define and understand Huygens&#x27; principle in terms of mathematical analysis. Singular supports may also be used to understand phenomena special to distribution theory, such as attempts to &#x27;multiply&#x27; distributions (squaring the Dirac delta function fails – essentially because the singular supports of the distributions to be multiplied should be disjoint).

==Family of supports==

An abstract notion of on a topological space formula_152 suitable for sheaf theory, was defined by Henri Cartan. In extending Poincaré duality to manifolds that are not compact, the &#x27;compact support&#x27; idea enters naturally on one side of the duality; see for example Alexander–Spanier cohomology.

Bredon, &quot;Sheaf Theory&quot; (2nd edition, 1997) gives these definitions. A family formula_153 of closed subsets of formula_8 is a , if it is down-closed and closed under finite union. Its is the union over formula_155 A family of supports that satisfies further that any formula_156 in formula_153 is, with the subspace topology, a paracompact space; and has some formula_158 in formula_153 which is a neighbourhood. If formula_8 is a locally compact space, assumed Hausdorff, the family of all compact subsets satisfies the further conditions, making it paracompactifying.

<doc id="381018" wikidata="Q1739389" url="?curid=381018" title="Superphénix">
<text>Superphénix (; , SPX) was a nuclear power station prototype on the Rhône river at Creys-Malville in France, close to the border with Switzerland. Superphénix was a 1,242 MWe fast breeder reactor with the twin goals of reprocessing nuclear fuel from France&#x27;s line of conventional nuclear reactors, while also being an economical generator of power on its own. , Superphénix remains the largest breeder reactor ever built.

Construction began in 1976, the reactor went critical in 1985 and was connected to the grid in 1986. The project suffered cost overruns, delays and enormous public protests. Overall, the reactor totalized a very low operation factor of 14.4%. Despite many technical issues related to being a first-of-a-kind project most of its downtime was caused by administrative procedure: the plant was technically capable of resuming operations but was forbidden to do so. Technical problems were solved over time and, by 1996, the plant had reached an availability of 95%.

The plant was powered down in December 1996 for maintenance, and while it was closed it was subject to court challenges that prevented its restart. In June 1997, the newly appointed Prime Minister, Lionel Jospin, announced that Superphénix would be closed permanently; this was made official by ministerial decree in December 1998.

==Design==

===Background===
France had considered the problem of plutonium production just after the end of World War II. At the time, the conventional solution to this problem was to use a graphite moderated air or water cooled reactor fueled with natural uranium. Such designs have little economic value in terms of power production, but are simple solutions to the problem of &quot;breeding&quot; plutonium fuel, which can then be separated from the original uranium fuel with chemical processing.

It had long been known that another solution to the breeder reactor design was to replace the graphite with liquid sodium metal. The graphite is used as a moderator, slowing the neutrons released in the nuclear reactions to a speed that makes other uranium atoms receptive to them. If the natural uranium fuel is replaced with fuel sensitive to fast neutrons, typically highly enriched uranium or plutonium, the reaction can run without the use of a moderator.

While this design eliminates the need for a moderator, the core still needs to be cooled. Ideally the coolant would be both highly efficient, allowing the core size to be reduced, as well as being largely transparent to neutrons. The most studied example of such a material is liquid sodium, although salts and other metals have also been used.

This not only greatly reduces the size of the reactor, but the fast neutrons from a single reaction are capable of causing several breeding reactions. By surrounding the core with additional fertile material such as natural uranium, or even nuclear waste from other reactors, the breeding reaction will take place in a larger volume and in otherwise useless materials. This section is known as the &quot;blanket&quot;. Such a design also has the quality that it generates more fuel than it consumes, as long as the &quot;breeding ratio&quot; is greater than 1.

Such a design has three major advantages over conventional military designs.
* The entire reaction cycle occurs much faster so it breeds new fuel at a faster rate
* It can use a wider variety of breeding materials because it is not used as the fuel as well
* It generates ample amounts of heat, which can be used to produce power
The downside is that it has to be fueled with some sort of enriched fuel, although the fissile material being bred in the blanket can be used.

===Earlier work and Phénix ===
Plans for a French fast reactor date as far back as 1958&#x27;s &quot;Rapsodie&quot;, and followed up in 1964 for a larger design with a power output of 1 GWe. Construction of the Rapsodie facility started in 1962 and went critical on 28 January 1967. It did not have power producing systems, but its 22 MW of thermal output (MWth) would translate to perhaps 8 MW of electrical output (MWe). Experiments on core configurations were carried out in the &quot;Masurca&quot; facility starting in 1966, and design of a larger power-producing facility was already well underway.

During the 1960s, interest in nuclear power was reaching a crescendo. For France, with little uranium supply of its own, large-scale nuclear generation would be subject to supply constraints, especially given that nuclear power was experiencing a boom in construction that suggested the available supply would be limited even on a worldwide basis. In France&#x27;s plans, breeders would serve the twin purposes of producing fuel for its conventional light water reactor fleet, as well as producing that fuel from the waste fuel from those reactors, thereby reducing the amount of nuclear waste it would have to dispose of. Only a small number of breeders, estimated to be around 20, would be required to fuel the fleet of about 200 light water reactors.

France began construction of the Phénix demonstration plant in November 1968, only a year after Rapsodie went critical. It was fueled with 931 kg of reactor grade plutonium with around 77% Pu-239 (weapons grade is at least 93%). The fuel load is capable of running for about 90 days maximum, but in practice it normally ran for two month periods. Due to its design, refueling required the reactor to be shut down. As a result, it had a low capacity factor (CF), on the order of 65%. As a prototype plant, a high CF was not a design goal, although any practical design would have to improve this. Phénix demonstrated a breeding ratio of 1.16, meaning it produced 16% more fuel than it consumed, while also producing 233 MWe in normal operation.

Phénix ran without problems through the 1970s and 1980s, but between 1989 and 1990 experienced 4 power transients which triggered automatic SCRAM. A 1991 report did not clearly identify the cause. In 1993 renovation and life extension works started. The reactor was restarted in 2003 with a reduced power of 130 MWe.

===Superphénix===
In 1971 and 1972, France, Germany and Italy signed agreements for the joint construction of full-scale breeders, one in France and one in Germany. The 1973 oil crisis made the issue of fuel security of significant importance. As part of the Messmer Plan, France began to plan for a future in which the vast majority of their electrical power would come from nuclear sources. New priority was given to a follow-on breeder design with the goal of continual operation, high CF, and economic operation even as a stand-alone reactor. This became the Superphénix design.

A public enquiry was carried out over an &quot;excessively short&quot; period from 9 October to 8 November 1974. This led to almost immediate opposition. In November, a group of 80 physicists from the Lyon Physics Institute wrote an open letter about the risks of breeder technology, and in February 1975, about 400 scientists signed their name to an expanded letter. On the other side of the argument, Andre Giraud, head of French Nuclear Commission (CEA), stated that they should carry on with the buildout, warning that delays would have &quot;catastrophic consequences on the uranium savings that are expected.&quot; In spite of opposition, Superphénix construction pushed ahead in 1976, although this was not made official until the next year, when initial construction was already underway.

==Construction==
Design work began in 1968, the same year as construction began for the smaller-scale LMFBR Phénix, following the abandonment of the graphite-gas designs. The fast breeder design was chosen in the face of fears of disruption to the supply of other fuels; the &quot;plutonium economy&quot; seemed viable if oil prices stayed high and uranium supplies dwindled. Construction was approved in 1972 and lasted from 1974 to 1981, but power production did not begin until 1985. Costs rose rapidly during construction. The plant was run by the consortium NERSA, 51% owned by EDF, 33% by ENEL and 16% by SBK (Schnell Brüter Kernkraftwerksgesellschaft).

=== Protest ===
The construction evoked much public protest. For example, a march by 60,000 protestors, which included the Anarchist group &quot;Fédération Anarchiste&quot;, resulted in the protestors&#x27; use of molotov cocktails. This July 1977 protest was finally broken up by the CRS with the death of Vital Michalon and over a hundred serious injuries, with the police using truncheons and firing tear gas grenades to disperse the protestors.

===Rocket attack===
Against a background of ongoing protest and low-level sabotage, on the night of January 18, 1982 an RPG-7 rocket-propelled grenade attack was launched against the unfinished plant. Five rockets were fired across the Rhône at the incomplete containment building. Two rockets hit and caused minor damage to the reinforced concrete outer shell, missing the reactor&#x27;s empty core. Initially there were no claims of responsibility.

On May 8, 2003, Chaïm Nissim, who in 1985 was elected to the Geneva cantonal legislature for the Swiss Green Party, admitted carrying out the attack. He claimed that the weapons were obtained from Carlos the Jackal via the Belgian terrorist organisation Cellules Communistes Combattantes (Communist Combatant Cells).

==Operation==
Designed electrical power output was 1.20 GW, though year to year its availability was from zero to 33%. As time passed, problems developed from another source: the liquid sodium cooling system suffered from corrosion and leaks. These problems were eventually fixed and in December 1996 the power reached 90% of the nominal power.

In December 1990 structural damage occurred to the turbine hall, following heavy snowfall. Power production did not resume until the &quot;Direction de la sûreté des installations nucléaires&quot; approved it in 1992.

The plant was connected to EDF grid on 14 January 1986 and produced 4,300 GWh of electricity, worth about a billion 1995 Franc, during 10 months of operation, up until 1994. In 1996 it produced 3,400 GWh, worth about 850 million Francs, during 8 months of operation.

In September 1998, the plant was closed. Two incidents earlier in the year had culminated in a third, which triggered an automatic shutdown.

During 11 years, the plant had 53 months of normal operations (mostly at low power), 25 months of outages due to fixing technical problems of the prototype, and 66 months spent on halt due to political and administrative issues.

==Closure==
Superphénix had been a focus point of many groups opposed to nuclear power, including the green party Les Verts, since its planning and construction. A national network called Sortir du nucléaire was formed, bringing together hundreds of organisations: local committees, ecological associations, citizen movements and parties.

Power production was halted in December 1996 for maintenance. However, following a court case led by opponents of the reactor, on February 28, 1997, the Conseil d&#x27;État (Supreme State Administrative Court) ruled that a 1994 decree, authorizing the restart of Superphénix, was invalid. In June 1997, one of the first actions of Lionel Jospin on becoming prime minister was to announce the closure of the plant because of its excessive costs.

A 1996 report by the French Accounting Office (Cour des Comptes) acknowledge low availability factors (below 10%) but also noticed improvements in 1996 and evaluated that availability above 46% would have made economically convenient to keep the plant open at least up to 2001. The total expenditure on the reactor was estimated at 60 billion francs (9.1 billion euro).

A 1998 &quot;Inquiry commission on Superphenix and fast neutrons reactor sector&quot; reported that &quot;decision to close Superphénix was included in Jospin&#x27;s program ... in the agreement between Socialist Party and Green Party&quot;. Also the same report says &quot;despite many difficulties, the technical results are meaningful&quot;. In the explanation of vote at the end of the report, commission members says &quot;give up on Superphenix has been a big error&quot; and &quot;Superphenix has to die because is a symbol&quot;.

The last of the 650 fuel rods was removed from the reactor on March 18, 2003. They are now stored in spent fuel pools.

A public inquiry was launched in April 2004 to consider plans to set up a plant to incorporate the 5,500 tonnes of sodium coolant in 70,000 tonnes of concrete. The plan is similar to that used following the closure of the Dounreay Fast Reactor in the United Kingdom.

Superphénix was the last fast breeder reactor operating in Europe for electricity production.

<text>The Queen of Prussia () was the queen consort of the ruler of the Kingdom of Prussia, from its establishment in 1701 to its abolition in 1918. As all rulers of Prussia had to be male, there was never a Queen regnant of Prussia. Until 1806, the Queen of Prussia was also Electress of Brandenburg; after 1871, she was also German Empress. Until 1772, her title was &quot;Queen in Prussia&quot; (see King in Prussia).

<doc id="381026" wikidata="Q2884709" url="?curid=381026" title="Chipping Barnet">
<text>Chipping Barnet or High Barnet is a suburban market town in north London, forming part of the London Borough of Barnet, England. It is a suburban development built around a 12th-century settlement, and is located north-northwest of Charing Cross, east from Borehamwood, west from Enfield and south from Potters Bar. Its population, including its localities East Barnet, New Barnet, Hadley Wood, Monken Hadley, Cockfosters and Arkley, was 47,359 in 2011.

Its name is very often abbreviated to just Barnet, which is also the name of the borough of which it forms a part; the town has been part of Greater London since 1965 after the abolition of Barnet Urban District then in Hertfordshire. Chipping Barnet is also the name of the Parliamentary constituency covering the local area – the word &quot;Chipping&quot; denotes the presence of a market, one that was established here at the end of the 12th century and persists to this day. Chipping Barnet is one of the highest urban settlements in London, with the town centre having an elevation of about .

== History ==
The town&#x27;s name, recorded as &quot;Barneto&quot; in about 1070, &quot;Barnet&quot; in 1197, and &quot;La Barnette&quot; in 1248, is derived from Old English &quot;bærnet&quot;: &quot;the land cleared by burning&quot;. It refers to the clearing of land in an area that was once densely forested.

In Saxon times the site was part of an extensive wood called Southaw, belonging to the Abbey of St Albans. Barnet&#x27;s elevated position is indicated in one of its alternative names (&quot;High Barnet&quot;), which appears in many old books and maps, and which the Great Northern Railway company adopted for the railway station opened in 1872 (now High Barnet tube station). The area was historically a common resting point on the traditional Great North Road between the City of London and York and Edinburgh.

The Battle of Barnet in 1471 was fought at nearby Monken Hadley, where Yorkist troops led by King Edward IV killed the rebellious &quot;Kingmaker&quot; Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, and Warwick&#x27;s brother, John Neville, 1st Marquess of Montagu. This was one of the most important battles of the Wars of the Roses.

Barnet Fair is a well-known horse fair dating back to 1588, which takes place each September. Queen Elizabeth I granted a charter to the Lord of the Manor of Barnet to hold a twice yearly fair. The fair gives its name to the rhyming slang of &quot;Barnet Fair&quot; or &quot;barnet&quot; for &quot;hair&quot;.

The famous Barnet Market is now (2024) nearly 825 years old. On 23 August 1199 King John issued a charter for a market at Barnet to the Lord of the Manor, the Abbot of St. Albans, John de Cella.

Chipping Barnet was historically a civil parish of Hertfordshire and formed part of the Barnet Urban District from 1894. The parish was abolished in 1965 and the Chipping Barnet section of its former area was transferred from Hertfordshire to Greater London and the newly created London Borough of Barnet. In 1801 the parish had a population of 1,258 and covered an area of . By 1901 the parish was reduced to and had a population of 2,893. In 1951 the population was 7,062.

Barnet belonged to the County of Hertfordshire until 1965, when under the London Government Act 1963, East Barnet Urban District and Barnet Urban District were abolished and their area was transferred to Greater London to form part of the present-day London Borough of Barnet.

At the beginning of the 21st century, a tongue-in-cheek movement calling for the name Barnet to be changed to &quot;Barnét&quot; began to gain the attention of the public and the national media, with many public road signs in the area regularly being altered to contain the accented character.

=== Religious sites ===
St John the Baptist Church is a landmark for miles around and stands in what was the centre of the town. It was erected by John de la Moote, abbot of St Albans, about 1400, the architect being Beauchamp. Playing on its antiquity, it continues to call itself &quot;Barnet Church&quot;, although this is not an official title. It is in fact the parish church of Chipping Barnet only, whilst Christ Church is the parish church of High Barnet, St Mark&#x27;s is the parish church of Barnet Vale, St James&#x27;s is the parish church of New Barnet, and Holy Trinity is the parish church of the Lyonsdown district. In addition, St Mary the Virgin is the parish church of East Barnet and St John of Friern Barnet. The parish church of St Mary the Virgin, Monken Hadley (rebuilt 1494) also has parish boundaries that include a significant part of High Barnet, including much of Barnet High Street.


The living of Barnet is a curacy, held with the rectory of East Barnet till the death of the last incumbent in 1866, when the livings were separated. The parish of Chipping Barnet, served by St John&#x27;s Church, was provided with a chapel-of-ease in Victorian times; subsequently Chipping Barnet parish was split in two, and the chapel-of-ease (on Bells Hill, Barnet) raised to the status of a parish church, dedicated to St Stephen.

== Geography ==
Chipping Barnet is designated as a Neighbourhood Centre in the London Plan.

The tower of Barnet parish church – St John the Baptist – at the top of Barnet Hill claims to be the highest point between itself and the Ural Mountains to the east. However, the same has been said of numerous other points. Since the opening of the railway, development has increased considerably, especially in the west of the area near Arkley.

For a London town, Barnet lies very high; the High Street is above sea level and the surrounding southern land no less than .

== Demography ==
Chipping Barnet town centre is covered by the High Barnet ward. According to the 2011 census, the population was 82% white (68% White British, 11% Other White, 3% White Irish). Indians made up 4% of the population, and all black groups made up 3%. The whole town is defined as the Chipping Barnet parliamentary constituency, which takes up the eastern third of the wider borough. This data does not represent the town as a whole because it contains six other wards.

== Transport ==

Barnet Hill is a major hill on the historic Great North Road. In coaching days, 150 stagecoaches passed through Barnet daily. The modern Great North Road replacement, the A1, runs to the west of the town along Barnet Bypass.

=== Tube and train ===
High Barnet Underground station is on the Northern line while New Barnet railway station is on the East Coast Main Line served by services from King&#x27;s Cross and to . Totteridge and Whetstone Underground station serves the affluent areas bearing the same name southwest of High Barnet town centre. Oakleigh Park railway station serves the eastern extremity of the town. The Barnet Tunnel is also in the area.

== Public services ==

Barnet is served by Barnet Hospital, which is run by the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust as part of the English National Health Service. There is also an NHS clinic in Vale Drive (near Barnet Hill and High Barnet station). London Ambulance Service responds to medical emergencies in Barnet. Home Office policing is provided by the Metropolitan Police Service. Statutory emergency fire service is provided by the London Fire Brigade, which has a station on Station Road, built in 1992.

== Sport and recreation ==
Barnet FC is the local football team, currently in the Vanarama National League, the fifth tier of English football – at the end of the 2017/18 season Barnet were relegated from League Two, and have remained in the Vanarama National League since. They played at the Underhill Stadium until 2012/13 but from the 2013/14 season are playing at The Hive Stadium in Stanmore in the London Borough of Harrow. They first reached the Football League in 1991 as champions of the GM Vauxhall Conference but lost their status 10 years later with relegation, only to return four years later – again as Conference champions. London Lions F.C. is also based in Barnet, near Stirling Corner, but the 1st team plays midweek and some cup home games at Hemel Hempstead Town F.C. as its own ground is not floodlit and does not meet the requirements for some cup competitions. There are a number of amateur football clubs based in Barnet including East Barnet Old Grammarians and Ravenscroft Old Boys.

Barnet Cricket Club and Old Elizabethans&#x27; Cricket Club have merged to form one club in Barnet and currently play their games at Gypsy Corner. Shaftesbury Barnet Harriers is a local athletics club. Barnet and Old Elizabethans rugby clubs merged to form Barnet Elizabethans RFC, playing in Byng Road, Barnet, near Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s School. Chipping Barnet has a King George&#x27;s Field in memorial to King George V. Old Court House Recreation Ground is a park in High Barnet.

High Barnet has an Everyman cinema, the Barnet Museum, the All Saints Art Centre, the Ravenscroft local park and Barnet recreational park, a now disused well that was frequented by, among others, Samuel Pepys, and many restaurants and public houses. Local festivals include the traditional annual Barnet Fair, which was chartered in medieval times, the High Barnet Chamber Music Festival, and Barnet Medieval Festival.

==Local papers==
The principal local newspapers are &quot;The Barnet and Potters Bar Times&quot; and &quot;The Barnet Post&quot;, which was established in July 2021.

The &quot;Barnet Press&quot; operated until 2017.

<doc id="381039" wikidata="Q2634456" url="?curid=381039" title="The Thin Red Line (Battle of Balaclava)">
<text>The Thin Red Line described an episode of the Battle of Balaclava on 25 October 1854, during the Crimean War. In the incident, around 500 men of the 93rd Sutherland Highlanders led by Sir Colin Campbell, aided by a small force of 100 walking wounded, 40 detached Guardsmen, and supported by a substantial force of Turkish infantrymen, formed a line of fire against the Russian cavalry. Previously, Campbell&#x27;s Highland Brigade had taken part in actions at the Battle of Alma and the Siege of Sevastopol. There were more Victoria Crosses presented to the Highland soldiers at that time than at any other. The event was lionised in the British press and became an icon of the qualities of the British soldier in a war that was arguably poorly managed and increasingly unpopular.

==The battle==
A Russian cavalry force of 2,500, commanded by General Ryzhov, was advancing on the camp of the British cavalry. About 400 Russians were involved in the incident. It was early morning, and the only troops between the oncoming cavalry and Balaklava was the 93rd Regiment.

Colin Campbell, 1st Baron Clyde, is said to have told his men, &quot;There is no retreat from here, men. You must die where you stand.&quot; Sir Colin&#x27;s aide John Scott is said to have replied, &quot;Aye, Sir Colin. If needs be, we&#x27;ll do that.&quot; Campbell felt he had insufficiently trained men to form square, and arranged the 93rd into a line two deep—the &quot;thin red line&quot;, though convention prescribed a line four deep, to meet the cavalry charge. As the Russian cavalry approached, the Turks on the flanks broke and fled. The 93rd discharged two volleys, at . They did not get a chance to discharge one at point-blank range as the Russians turned away. Accounts of the Highlanders state that they started forward for a counter-charge before the final volley, but Sir Colin stopped them with a cry of &quot;93rd, damn you Highlanders for all that eagerness!&quot;

Canadian historian George T. Denison, in his book &quot;A History of Cavalry from the Earliest Times, With Lessons for the Future&quot;, wrote &quot;... the Russian squadrons had no intention whatever of charging, but were simply at the time making demonstrations to oblige the allied troops to display their arrangements, and that when the 93rd showed their line upon the hill, the object was gained, and the cavalry withdrew.&quot; 

&quot;The Times&quot; correspondent, William H. Russell, wrote that he could see nothing between the charging Russians and the British regiment&#x27;s base of operations at Balaklava but the &quot;thin red streak tipped with a line of steel&quot; of the 93rd; in his later accounts, he changed the phrase to &quot;thin red line&quot;. 

The battle is represented in Robert Gibb&#x27;s 1881 oil painting &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot;, which is displayed in the Scottish National War Museum in Edinburgh Castle. It is also commemorated in the assembly hall of Campbell&#x27;s former school, High School of Glasgow, where there is a painting of the action hung in the grand position, a tribute to one of the school&#x27;s two generals, the other being Sir John Moore, who was killed at Corunna during the Peninsular War.

==Later uses of the term==

&quot;The Thin Red Line&quot; has become an English language figure of speech for any thinly spread military unit holding firm against attack. The phrase has also taken on the metaphorical meaning of the barrier which the relatively limited armed forces of a country present to potential attackers.

The term &quot;the thin red line&quot; later referred to the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders and their job to defend the British Empire and the United Kingdom after the incorporation of the Argylls and Sutherlands into a single regiment now known as the Argyll and Sutherland battalion of the Royal Regiment of Scotland.

Rudyard Kipling wrote in the poem &quot;Tommy&quot;: &quot;Then it&#x27;s Tommy this, an&#x27; Tommy that, an&#x27; Tommy, &#x27;ow&#x27;s yer soul? / But it&#x27;s &#x27;Thin red line of &#x27;eroes&#x27; when the drums begin to roll,&quot; – &quot;Tommy Atkins&quot; being slang for a common British soldier.

George MacDonald Fraser describes the Thin Red Line, the Charge of the Heavy Brigade, and the Charge of the Light Brigade in his novel &quot;Flashman at the Charge&quot;.

In the 1968 film &quot;Carry On... Up the Khyber&quot;, a soldier played by Charles Hawtrey draws a thin red line on the ground with paint and brush, arguing that the enemy will not dare to cross it.

The term was adopted as a reference to the fire brigade, via the derived &quot;thin blue line&quot; referring to police. Such uses are common in the US on bumper stickers expressing membership or support of police and fire departments.

James Jones wrote a novel about American infantry soldiers fighting in Guadalcanal during World War II and titled it &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot;. The book was adapted into feature films in 1964 and in 1998.

<text>Gorki Leninskiye (, &quot;Lenin&#x27;s Gorki&quot;) is an urban locality (a work settlement) in Leninsky District of Moscow Oblast, Russia, located south of Moscow city limits and the Moscow Ring Road. Its population is: 

The estate of Gorki belonged to various Muscovite noblemen from the 18th century. Zinaida Morozova, the widow of Savva Morozov, purchased it in 1909, the year before she married General Anatoly Reinbot (later Anatoly Rezvoy), the chief of Moscow police. She engaged the most fashionable Russian architect, Fyodor Schechtel, to remodel the mansion in the then-current Neoclassical style, complete with a six-column Ionic portico.

On 21 January 1924, Vladimir Lenin, the first leader of the Russian SFSR and subsequently the USSR, died at this estate, which he had used as his personal dacha since its nationalization in 1918.

==Lenin&#x27;s dacha==
After the Soviet government moved to Moscow in 1918, it nationalized the luxurious estate and converted it into Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s dacha. In September 1918, the Soviet leader recuperated there following an assassination attempt. He spent an increasing amount of time there as his health declined over the following years. On May 15, 1923, Lenin followed medical advice and left the Moscow Kremlin for Gorki. He lived there in semi-retirement until his death on January 21, 1924.
After Lenin&#x27;s death, Gorki was renamed &quot;Gorki Leninskiye&quot; (meaning &quot;Lenin&#x27;s Gorki&quot;). The house became a museum holding many of Lenin&#x27;s possessions. Also located on the estate is a large museum built in 1987 concerning Lenin&#x27;s life there, containing such artifacts as his Last Testament (as transcribed by Nadezhda Krupskaya), other documents, photos, books, Lenin&#x27;s car (a Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost), his wheelchairs, and his apartment and office from the Kremlin, reconstructed in a separate building. A monument representing &quot;The Death of the Leader&quot; was unveiled in the 18th-century park in 1958.

<doc id="381047" wikidata="Q858513" url="?curid=381047" title="New Providence">
<text>New Providence is the most populous island in The Bahamas, containing more than 70% of the total population. On the eastern side of the island is the national capital city of Nassau; it had a population of 246,329 at the 2010 Census, and a population of 292,522 at the 2022 census. Nearly three quarters of The Bahamas&#x27;s population lives in New Providence. 

The island was originally under Spanish control following Christopher Columbus&#x27;s purported discovery of the New World, but the Spanish government showed little interest in developing the island (and The Bahamas as a whole). Nassau, the island&#x27;s largest city, was formerly known as Charles-town, but it was burned to the ground by the Spanish in 1684. It was laid out and renamed Nassau in 1695 by Nicholas Trott, the most successful Lord Proprietor, in honour of the Prince of Orange-Nassau who became William III of England.

The three branches of Bahamian Government: the executive, the legislative, and the judiciary, are all headquartered on New Providence. New Providence functions as the main commercial hub of The Bahamas. It is also home to more than 400 banks and trust companies, and its hotels and port account for more than two-thirds of the four million-plus tourists who visit The Bahamas annually. New Providence is the only part of The Bahamas that lacks local government. Local affairs are handled by the national government, but the island is divided into 24 supervisory districts.

Other settlements on New Providence include Grants Town, Bain Town, Fox Hill, Adelaide, Yamacraw, South Beach, Coral Harbour, Lyford Cay, Paradise Island, Sea Breeze, Centreville, The Grove (South) and The Grove (West Bay), Cable Beach, Delaporte, Gambier, Old Fort Bay, Carmichael Road, and Love Beach.

==Etymology==
The Indigenous Lucayan people called the island &quot;Nema&quot;, meaning &quot;middle-water&quot;. The name New Providence Island is derived from a 16th‐century governor who gave thanks to Divine Providence for his survival after a shipwreck. The &quot;New&quot; was added later to distinguish it from Providencia in Western Caribbean (now Colombia) used by pirates.

==History==
After 1670, Bermudian salt rakers gathering sea salt in Grand Turk and Inagua became regular visitors to the island. The first lasting European settlement was on Eleuthera in 1648, and then New Providence in 1666.

By 1670, there were over 900 people on the settlement of Charles-Town. Due to ineffective governors, Charles-Town was attacked by the French and Spanish navies, became a home base for pirates, and was eventually destroyed by a Spanish attack in 1684. However, two years later in 1686, new English colonists from Jamaica came and settled. They were called back by the governor of Jamaica, but they ignored this order. In 1695, Governor Nicolas Trott rebuilt the town and added a fort, both were called Nassau. However, the fort was heavily damaged in a Spanish attack in 1700 and the colonists eventually abandoned the fort in 1703 after a French and Spanish attack. Due to the lack of cannon and soldiers in the fort, New Providence soon became a home base for pirates. By 1713, there were over 1000 pirates in Nassau and they outnumbered the 400–500 law-abiding inhabitants; pirate Thomas Barrow even declared himself &quot;Governor of New Providence&quot;. In 1718, Governor Woodes Rogers (sent by King George I of Great Britain) came in and offered a pardon for any pirate willing to give up their ways. Using his intelligence and threatening to execute them if they did not take the pardon, Rogers was eventually able to rid Nassau of pirates.

In February 1776, American Esek Hopkins led a squadron of over seven ships to raid the British-held island in order to secure supplies and munitions. In an event known as the Battle of Nassau, on March 3 and 4, Hopkins landed the first-ever amphibious assault by American military forces consisting of 250 Marines and sailors. Under the covering fire of the &quot;Providence&quot; and &quot;Wasp&quot;, the attackers overwhelmed Fort Montague. The British retreated to Fort Nassau, but then surrendered to Continental forces. The Americans managed to secure 88 cannon and 15 mortars, but most of the much desired gunpowder was evacuated before capture. Hopkins spent two weeks loading his ships with the booty before finally returning home.

The frigate &quot;South Carolina&quot;, of the South Carolina Navy, arrived at Havana on 12 January 1782. At Havana, after negotiations between Alexander Gillon and the Spanish, the &quot;South Carolina&quot; joined a force of 59 vessels carrying Spanish forces under the overall command of Bernardo de Galvez. On 22 April the expedition sailed to capture New Providence. By May 6 the whole fleet had reached New Providence and on 8 May the British colony surrendered. This was the third capture of New Providence by a foreign force during the American Revolutionary War.

After the American Revolution, several thousand Loyalists and their slaves emigrated to New Providence and nearby islands, hoping to re-establish plantation agriculture. The shallow soils and sparse rainfall doomed this activity to failure, and by the early 19th century The Bahamas had become a nearly vacant archipelago. Salt raking continued here and there, wreck gleaning was profitable in Grand Bahama, but New Providence was the only island with any prosperity because of the large British military establishment. The fortresses began to crumble and were abandoned by 1850. New Providence afterwards had two periods of high economic success: during the American Civil War of 1861–65, when it was a highly popular port for blockade-runners serving the Confederate States of America; and during Prohibition, when it was a smuggling centre for distilled spirits.

==Tourist destination==
By the late 19th century, New Providence had begun billing itself as the &quot;sanitarium of the western hemisphere&quot;. Testimonials by residents and visitors emphasized its extremely mild climate with minimal daily temperature fluctuations (often as little as in any given 12-hour period) and warm winters (a typical winter morning in the range of , excellent drainage, ample variety and number of Christian (Protestant) churches, well-tended and rectilinear roads, modern luxurious facilities, and native English speakers. Steam ships plied between the coastal southern United States, Cuba, and Nassau, and the popularity of the destination proceeded to grow.

By the late 1920s, New Providence had become well-established especially as an American vacation destination with many tourist facilities, including a deepened harbour for short-visit cruise ship visitors and hotels offering gambling.

<text>A national day is a day on which celebrations mark the statehood or nationhood of a state or its people. It may be the date of independence, of becoming a republic, of becoming a federation, or a significant date for a patron saint or a ruler (such as a birthday, accession, or removal).

The national day is often an official public holiday. Many countries have more than one national day. Denmark and the United Kingdom are the only countries without a national day. Denmark has what is not a public holiday but an unofficial celebration called Constitution Day. National days emerged with the age of nationalism, with most appearing during the 19th and 20th centuries.

National day may also be known as Independence Day, Liberation Day, or Republic Day, depending on the nation, and its history. 


==List of national days==
Nations that are not broadly recognized sovereign states are shown in pink. Defunct states are highlighted in light grey. For nations that are dependent on, or part of, a sovereign state (such as federal states, autonomous regions, or colonies), the name of the sovereign state is shown in parentheses.

Days that are not fixed to the Gregorian calendar are sorted by their occurrences.

<doc id="381053" wikidata="Q5178407" url="?curid=381053" title="Court of Session">
<text>The Court of Session is the highest national court of Scotland in civil cases. The court was established in 1532 to take on the judicial functions of the royal council. Its jurisdiction overlapped with other royal, state and church courts but as those were disbanded, the role of the Court of Session ascended. The Acts of Union establishing the United Kingdom provided that the court will &quot;remain in all time coming&quot;.

Cases at first instance are heard in the Outer House by a single judge. The Inner House hears appeals from the Outer House and all other courts and tribunals in Scotland. Only Scottish advocates and solicitor-advocates may argue cases before the court. The Court of Session has sat at Parliament House since 1707. The Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service and the Principal Clerk administers the court and judges.

Decisions of the court are subject to review by the European Court of Human Rights and on appeal, the UK Supreme Court can overturn them altogether. These courts lie outwith Scotland and so the Court of Session is the supreme court of Scotland for civil cases. Early judges of the court recorded their decisions and codified the law at a time early in the development of Scots law, leading to the development and distinct character of Scots law. In modern times, the court has ruled on issues of public importance and proceedings of its Inner House have been streamed and recorded since 2023. The court now hears cases from any part of Scotland on any issue, other than criminal cases, which belong to its sister court, the High Court of Justiciary.

Judges are termed Lords of Council and Session and appointed simultaneously to the College of Justice and the High Court of Justiciary. Their number is fixed by statute, currently to 37, although a number of temporary judges assist the court with its workload. The court is led by the Lord President of the Court of Session who also heads the Scottish judiciary.

==History==

=== Establishment of the court ===
The creation of the court was part of wider efforts to improve and reform access to justice in Scottish society. By 1153, the local feudal courts had been established. Depending on the part of Scotland where the cause originated, justice might also be available from the local baron or lord of regality, sitting with the king&#x27;s authority. Parties often found these courts ineffectual. Appeal of the decisions of local courts lay to the king and the Lords of Council, sitting together as the King&#x27;s Council, or the Parliament of Scotland. The burden on these bodies of hearing appeals led to a growing effort to divest their judicial functions.

James I decided that a Session would be held periodically to hear appeals and decide cases. It came to be known as the Auld Session and sat three times a year, comprising the Lord Chancellor and &quot;certain discreet persons of the Three Estates&quot; as the Lords of Session. The Sessions had universal jurisdiction to hear disputes formerly arguable to the king&#x27;s Council. According to the Stair Memorial Encyclopedia, they were so named because the Sessions were &quot;a court and[…] the term &#x27;session&#x27; was used to distinguish this new court from the royal court which was peripatetic, whereas the Session sat at such places as the king appointed.&quot;

By 1438, the Session was convening only yearly and it ceased altogether at a time between 1457 and 1468, with its function transferring back to the king&#x27;s council and decided by the Lords of Council. The voluntary and unpaid nature of the office of Lord of Session was likely responsible for the Auld Session&#x27;s failure. The work of the Session continued under the auspices of the king&#x27;s council and in 1491, an act proclaimed that &quot;the Chancellor with certain Lords of Council or else the Lords of Session sit for the administration of justice thrice each year… so that justice may be put to due execution to all parties complaining&quot;.

These sittings, or &#x27;sessions&#x27;, became more regular. Edinburgh was fixed as the location for the sessions, addressing a frustrating feature of the royal courts – litigants would summon an opponent to appear at one place on one date, but by that day the king may have decided to move onto another location. The summons would fail and the litigant would have to spend considerable money both following the court and issuing a fresh summons. The Lords of Council and the Lords of Session became commingled, and the modern court&#x27;s judges are still styled &quot;Lords of Council and Session&quot;.

In 1531, it was decided to create a permanent, dedicated, national court of Scotland. James V obtained a papal bull in 1531 and established the College of Justice in 1532, basing it on the Parisian &quot;parlement&quot;. The council lords became members of the College of Justice and judges of the new Court of Session. The Lord Chancellor of Scotland presided over the court.

The court began providing free access to a lawyer, the &quot;advocatus pauperum&quot;, in 1534. Initially, the court&#x27;s judiciary numbered fourteen and was split evenly between clerics and laymen. Judges were at first selected by the king and council, but the court grew anxious at the quality of those selected, and from 1579 nominees had to be confirmed by the existing judges.

===Early operation===
On its founding, the court had jurisdiction over &quot;all civil actions&quot;. Consistorial and succession causes were moved from the church courts to the Court of Session after the Reformation. As the court&#x27;s jurisdiction grew, it began to direct that smaller causes be heard in the local courts, with the Court of Session acting as an appeal court. The court also developed the doctrine of &quot;nobile officium&quot; under which it had an inherent power to provide a remedy for any injustice not already provided for by Scots law. Scots law did not develop a distinction between its common law and equitable principles partly due to the &quot;nobile officium&quot;.

The Courts Act 1672 allowed for five of the Lords of Session to be appointed as Lords Commissioners of Justiciary, and as such becomes judges of the High Court of Justiciary. The High Court of Justiciary is the supreme criminal court of Scotland. Previously the Lord Justice General, the president of the High Court, had appointed deputes to preside in his absence. From 1672 to 1887, the High Court consisted of the Lord Justice General, Lord Justice Clerk, and five Lords of Session.

In 1640, membership of the court was restricted to laymen only, by withdrawing the right of churchmen to sit in judgement of legal causes. The number of laymen was increased to maintain the number of lords in the court.

===Towards the modern day===
The Court of Session is explicitly preserved &quot;in all time coming&quot; in Article XIX of the Treaty of Union between England and Scotland, subsequently passed into legislation by the Acts of Union in 1706 and 1707 respectively. The office of Extraordinary Lord of Session was abolished in 1762. Outer House judges continue to be addressed in the Inner House as &quot;the Lord Ordinary&quot;, a remnant of the historical distinction between the Extraordinary Lords of Session and the other or &#x27;Ordinary&#x27; ones.

Several significant changes were made to the court during the 19th century, with the Court of Session Act 1810 formally dividing the Court of Session into the Outer House (with first-instance jurisdiction before a Lord Ordinary) and Inner House (with appellate jurisdiction.) Cases in the Outer House were to be heard by Lords Ordinary who either sat alone or with a jury of twelve. Cases in the Inner House were to be heard by three Lords of Council and Session, but significant or complicated cases were to be heard by five or more judges. A further separation was made in 1815, by the Jury Trials (Scotland) Act 1815 (55 Geo. 3. c. 42), with the creation of a lesser Jury Court to allow certain civil cases to be tried by jury. In 1830 the Jury Court, along with the Admiralty and Commissary courts, was absorbed into the Court of Session following the enactment of the Court of Session Act 1830.

In 1834, the remuneration and working conditions were a matter of public discussion and debate in the House of Commons. On 6 May 1834 Sir George Sinclair addressed the House of Commons to plead for an increase in the salaries of the senators, noting that &quot;a Civil Judge in the Supreme Court in Scotland received only &quot; and the masters in the Court of Chancery were paid . A select committee was appointed to investigate the matter.

In October 1834, &quot;The Spectator&quot; reported on the conflicting views around the remuneration and working conditions of the judges of the Court of Session, with conflicting views being presented in response to the &quot;Report on the Scotch Judges&#x27; Salaries&quot;. &quot;The Spectator&quot; reported the arguments made by Sir William Rae, Lord Advocate, that the judges of the Court of Session had considerable duties, which he listed as:

The select committee&#x27;s Report recommended that the salaries of the Lord President, Lord Justice Clerk and remaining senators should be increased, and also recommended that all senators should become &quot;Lords Commissioners of Justiciary&quot;. The recommended salaries were:
* Lord President: increase from to 
* Lord Justice Clerk: increase from to 
* Senator: increase from to 
However, &quot;The Spectator&quot; was very critical of the actual amount of work done by the judges of the court, noting that there was much public criticism of their effectiveness. The article noted that the judges were entitled to 7 months vacation in each year. &quot;The Spectator&quot; also asserted that civil justice was out of the reach of the poor in Scotland.

In 1887 all of the Lords of Session were made Lords Commissioners of Justiciary, and thus judges of the High Court of Justiciary, following the passage of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1887 (50 &amp; 51 Vict. c. 35).

==Work==

Decisions of the Court of Session are influential or binding on all the courts of Scotland, and the court handles all manner of civil business, from commercial and contract disputes to family and taxation. Appeal lies to Supreme Court of the United Kingdom and may be taken only with the permission of either court. The Court of Session and the local sheriff courts of Scotland have concurrent jurisdiction for all cases with a monetary value in excess of ; the pursuer is given first choice of court. The majority of complex, important, or high value cases are brought in the Court of Session. The sheriff courts and Sheriff Personal Injury Court may remit cases to the Court of Session at the presiding sheriff&#x27;s request.

===Civil cases===

The Court of Session is the supreme civil court of Scotland, and it shares concurrent jurisdiction with the local sheriff courts over all cases with a value of more than (including personal injury claims.) Where a choice of jurisdiction exists between the Court of Session and the sheriff courts, including the Sheriff Personal Injury Court, it is for the pursuer to decide which court to raise the action in. The court sits in Parliament House in Edinburgh and is both a trial court and a court of appeal.

===Exchequer cases===
The primary task of the Court of Session is to decide on civil law cases. The court is also the Court of Exchequer for Scotland, a jurisdiction previously held by the Court of Exchequer. (In 1856, the functions of that court were transferred to the Court of Session, and one of the Lords Ordinary sits as &quot;Lord Ordinary in Exchequer Causes&quot; when hearing cases therein.) This was restated by the Court of Session Act 1988.

===Admiralty cases===
The Court of Session is also the admiralty court for Scotland, having been given the duties of that court by the provisions of the Court of Session Act 1830. The boundaries of the jurisdiction of the Court of Session in maritime cases were specified in 1999 by an Order in Council: the Scottish Adjacent Waters Boundaries Order 1999.

=== &quot;Nobile officium&quot; ===
The jurisdiction of the Court of Session extends beyond statutory and common law powers, with the Court having an equitable and inherent jurisdiction called the &quot;nobile officium&quot;, unique among British courts. The &quot;nobile officium&quot; enables the court to provide a legal remedy where statute or the common law are silent, and prevent mistakes in procedure or practice that would lead to injustice. The exercise of this power is limited by adherence to precedent, and when legislation or the common law do not already specify the relevant remedy. Thus, the court cannot set aside a statutory power, but can deal with situations where the law is silent, or where there is an omission in statute. Such an omission is sometimes termed a &quot;casus improvisus&quot;.

The &quot;nobile officium&quot; was used to implement recognition of an order of the High Court of Justice of England and Wales for the placement of children in secure accommodation in Scotland, in the case of &quot;Cumbria County Council, Petitioners [2016] CSIH 92&quot;. An application was made to the Court of Session under the &quot;nobile officium&quot; by Cumbria County Council, Stockport Metropolitan Council, and Blackpool Borough Council on behalf of four children. There was insufficient accommodation in England to house the children, so the councils sought to place them in suitable Scottish accommodation. However, legislation was silent on the cross-border jurisdiction of such orders as made by the High Court of Justice. Nonetheless, equivalent orders made by a Scottish court were enforceable in England and Wales. Thus, the Court of Session found, using its inherent powers, that the orders could be applied as though they had been issued by the Court of Session itself.

In September 2019 UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that he would &quot;rather be dead in a ditch&quot; than apply for an extension to Britain&#x27;s application to leave the European Union (Brexit), due on 31 October, although the UK parliament had required him to do so under circumstances laid out in the Benn Act. Following this, an application was made to the Court of Session to require the Prime Minister to sign a letter requesting extension if no exit deal could be agreed in time. The applicants hoped that the unique power of &quot;nobile officium&quot; would enable the court to send the article 50 extension letter on Johnson&#x27;s behalf, if he declined to do so.

===Appellate jurisdiction===
Appeals in the Court of Session are generally heard by the Inner House before three judges, although in important cases in which there is a conflict of authority a court of five judges or, exceptionally, seven, may be convened. The Inner House is sub-divided into two divisions of equal authority and jurisdiction - the First Division, headed by the Lord President; and the Second Division headed by the Lord Justice Clerk. The courts to hear each case are, ordinarily, drawn from these divisions. When neither is available to chair a hearing, an Extra Division of three senators is summoned, chaired by the most senior judge present; due to pressure of business the Extra Division sits frequently nowadays.

Until 2015 civil cases that went to a full proof (hearing) in the sheriff courts of Scotland could be appealed by right to the Inner House of the Court of Session. Appellants could take the appeal to a sheriff principal for an initial appeal, and then onto the Inner House, or they could take the appeal directly to the Inner House. However, the appellate jurisdiction of sheriffs principal for all civil cases (including summary cause and small claims actions) was transferred to the Sheriff Appeal Court following passage of the Courts Reform (Scotland) Act 2014. The 2014 Act also modified the appellate jurisdiction of the Inner House with civil appeals from the sheriff courts being heard by an appeal sheriff sitting in the Sheriff Appeal Court. Such appeals are binding on all sheriff courts in Scotland, and appeals can only be remitted (transferred) to the Inner House where they are deemed to be of wider public interest, raise a significant point of law, or are particularly complex:
===Oath of Allegiance===

The Oath of Allegiance is taken by holders of political office in Scotland before the Lord President of the Court of Session at a meeting of the court.

=== Acts of Sederunt ===

Civil procedure in Scotland is regulated by the Court of Session through Acts of Sederunt, which are subordinate legislation and take legal force as Scottish statutory instruments. The power to enact Acts of Sederunt is granted by the Courts Reform (Scotland) Act 2014 and the Tribunals (Scotland) Act 2014, which replaced powers regulated by the Court of Session Act 1988 and the Sheriff Courts (Scotland) Act 1971. These are generally incorporated into the Rules of Court, which are published by the Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service and form the basis for Scots civil procedure.

Acts of Sederunt regulate civil procedure in the Court of Session, the sheriff courts of Scotland (including the Sheriff Appeal Court and Sheriff Personal Injury Court), and in the tribunals of Scotland. The Court of Session can amend or repeal any enactment, including primary legislation, if it relates to matters an &quot;Act of Sederunt&quot; may cover. Rules for regulating civil procedure are decided upon by the Scottish Civil Justice Council before being presented to the Lords of Session for decision; the Lords of Session may approve, amend or reject the rules so presented.

An Act of Sederunt, Act of Sederunt (Regulation of Advocates) 2011, devolves authority to the Faculty of Advocates to regulate admission to practice as an advocate before the Court of Session and the High Court of Justiciary; advocates are notionally officers of the court, and are &quot;de jure&quot; appointed by the court.

==Structure==
The court is divided into the Inner House of twelve senators, which is primarily an appeal court, and the Outer House, which is primarily a court of first instance. The Inner House is further divided into divisions of six senators: the first division, presided over by the Lord President, and second division, presided over by the Lord Justice Clerk. Cases in the Inner House are normally heard before a bench of three senators, though more complex or important cases are presided over by five senators. On very rare occasions the whole Inner House has presided over a case. Outer House cases are heard by a single senator sitting as a Lord Ordinary, occasionally with a jury of twelve.

The current Lord President is Lord Carloway. In addition to the 35 senators, a number of temporary judges have been appointed to the court, typically from serving sheriffs and sheriffs principal or advocates in private practice.
===Inner House===

The Inner House is the senior part of the Court of Session, and is both a court of appeal and a court of first instance. The Inner House has historically been the main locus of an extraordinary equitable power called the &quot;nobile officium&quot; – the High Court of Justiciary has a similar power in criminal cases. Criminal appeals in Scotland are handled by the High Court of Justiciary sitting as the Court of Appeal.

The Inner House is the part of the Court of Session which acts as a court of appeal for cases decided the Outer House and of civil cases from the sheriff courts, the Court of the Lord Lyon, Scottish Land Court, and the Lands Tribunal for Scotland. The Inner House always sits as a panel of at least three senators and with no jury.

Unlike in the High Court of Justiciary, there is a right of appeal to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom of cases from the Inner House. The right of appeal only exists when the Court of Session grants leave to this effect or when the decision of the Inner House is by majority. Until the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 came into force in October 2009, this right of appeal was to the House of Lords (or sometimes to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council).

===Outer House===
The Outer House is a court of first instance, although some statutory appeals are remitted to it by the Inner House. Such appeals are originally referred from the sheriff courts, the court of first instance for civil causes in the court system of Scotland. Judges in the Outer House are referred to as &quot;Lord or Lady [name]&quot;, or as &quot;Lord Ordinary&quot;. The Outer House is superficially similar to the High Court in England and Wales, and in this house judges sit singly—and with a jury of twelve in personal injury or defamation actions. Subject-matter jurisdiction is extensive and extends to all kinds of civil claims unless expressly excluded by statute, and it shares much of this jurisdiction with the sheriff courts. Some classes of cases, such as intellectual property disputes, are heard by an individual judge designated by the Lord President as the jurist for intellectual property cases.

Final judgments of the Outer House, as well as some important judgements on procedure, may be appealed to the Inner House. Other judgments may be so appealed with leave.

=== Other sittings ===
The court sits as the Lands Valuation Appeal Court is a Scottish civil court, composed of three Court of Session judges, and established under Section 7 of the Valuation of Lands (Scotland) Amendment Act 1879. It hears cases where the decision of a local Valuation Appeal Committee is disputed. The senators who make up the Lands Valuation Appeal Court was specified in 2013 by the Act of Sederunt (Lands Valuation Appeal Court) 2013, which has both Lord Carloway (Lord President) and Lady Dorrian (Lord Justice Clerk) as members with a further four senators specified.

==Administration==

===Legal aid===
Legal aid, administered by the Scottish Legal Aid Board, is available to persons with little disposable income for cases in the Court of Session.

===Rights of audience===
Members of the Faculty of Advocates, known as advocates or counsel, and as of 1990 also some solicitors, known as solicitor-advocates, have practically exclusive rights of audience in the court. Barristers from England and Wales have no right of audience, which caused controversy in 2011 (over an appeal from an immigration tribunal) and again in 2015 (over an appeal from a tax tribunal) when barristers recognised by the General Council of the Bar were denied the right to take an appeal on behalf of clients they had represented at tribunal.

===Principal Clerk===
The administration of the court is part of the Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service, and is led by the Principal Clerk of Session and Justiciary. She is responsible for the administration of the Supreme Courts of Scotland and their associated staff. Gillian Prentice has been the Principal Clerk since June 2018.

==Judges==
The court&#x27;s president is the Lord President, the second most senior judge is the Lord Justice Clerk, with a further 33 senators of the College of Justice holding office as Lords of Council and Session. The total numbers of judges is fixed by Section 1 of the Court of Session Act 1988, and subject to amendment by Order in Council. Judges are appointed for life, subject to dismissal if they are found unfit for office, and subject to a compulsory retirement age of 75.

Temporary judges can also be appointed.

The court is a unitary collegiate court, with all judges other than the Lord President and the Lord Justice Clerk holding the same rank and title—&quot;Senator of the College of Justice&quot; and also &quot;Lord&quot; or &quot;Lady of Council and Session&quot;. There are thirty-four judges, in addition to a number of temporary judges; these temporary judges are typically sheriffs, or advocates in private practice. The judges sit also in the High Court of Justiciary, where the Lord President is called the Lord Justice General.

===Appointment and removal===
To be eligible for appointment as a senator, or temporary judge, a person must have served at least five years as sheriff or sheriff principal, been an advocate for five years, a solicitor with five years rights of audience before the Court of Session or High Court of Justiciary, or been a Writer to the Signet for ten years (having passed the exam in civil law at least two years before application).
Appointments are made by the King on the recommendation of the First Minister of Scotland who receives recommendations from the 
Judicial Appointments Board for Scotland. The Judicial Appointments Board has a statutory authority for making recommendations under Sections 9 to 27 of the Judiciary and Courts (Scotland) Act 2008 (as amended by the Courts Reform (Scotland) Act 2014). Appointments to the Inner House are made by the Lord President and Lord Justice Clerk, with the consent of the Scottish Ministers.

The Lord President, Lord Justice Clerk and other senators can be removed from office after a tribunal has been convened to examine their fitness for office. The tribunal is convened on the request of the Lord President, or in other circumstances that the First Minister sees fit. However, the First Minister must consult the Lord President (for all other judges) and the Lord Justice Clerk (when the Lord President is under investigation.) Should the tribunal recommend their dismissal the Scottish Parliament can resolve that the First Minister make a recommendation to the Monarch.

===Lord President===

The Lord President is the most senior judge of the Court of Session, and is also president of the First Division of the Inner House. The Lord Justice Clerk is the second most senior judge of the Court of Session, and deputises for the Lord President when the Lord President is absent, unable to fulfil his duties, or when there is a vacancy for Lord President. The Lord Justice Clerk is president of the 2nd Division of the Inner House.

<doc id="381067" wikidata="Q7169287" url="?curid=381067" title="Permanent normal trade relations">
<text>The status of permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) is a legal designation in the United States for free trade with a foreign state. The designation was changed from &quot;most favored nation&quot; (MFN) to &quot;normal trade relations&quot; by Section 5003 of the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998. &quot;Permanent&quot; was added to &quot;normal trade relations&quot; some time later.

In international trade, MFN status (or treatment) is awarded by one country to another. It means that the receiving nation will be granted all trade advantages, such as low tariffs, that any other country also receives. Thus, a country with MFN status will not be discriminated against and will not be treated worse than any other country with MFN status.

==Applicability==
Granting of permanent normal trade relations status is automatic, except where specifically denied by law.

Embargoes also apply to additional parties; see United States embargoes.

==History==
In 1948, the United States joined the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the predecessor organization of the World Trade Organization. In accordance with GATT provisions the United States agreed to extend what was then called Most Favored-Nation status (MFN) to all GATT member countries. This status was also applied to some countries that were not GATT members. However, a member may opt out of its obligations by invoking the non-application provision (Article XIII of the WTO or Article XXXV of the GATT) if it determines it cannot extend GATT/WTO principles to newly acceding members for political reasons.

In 1951, the U.S. Congress directed President Harry Truman to revoke MFN status to the Soviet Union and other Communist countries except for Yugoslavia. During the Cold War, most Communist countries were denied MFN status if they did not meet certain conditions.

In December 1960, Poland was granted MFN status by President Eisenhower. In 1962, Congress enacted a directive that jeopardized the MFN status of Poland and Yugoslavia; however, the directive was delayed until a new one was passed that allowed any countries with MFN to keep the status if the President determined it to be in the national interest of the United States.

Title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 superseded these provisions. Section 401 of Title IV requires the President to withhold MFN status from countries that had not acquired that status by the time of the law&#x27;s enactment on January 3, 1975. In effect, this meant all communist countries, except Poland and Yugoslavia. Section 402, the Jackson–Vanik amendment, withholds MFN status from countries with strict restriction on freedom of emigration. Countries that wish to have PNTR must fulfill two basic requirements: (1) comply with the Jackson–Vanik provisions of the Trade Act of 1974 that states that the President of the United States determines that a country neither denies or impedes the right or opportunity of its citizens to emigrate; and (2) reach a bilateral commercial agreement with the United States. Jackson–Vanik allows for the President to issue a yearly waiver to allow the granting of PNTR.

For many years, People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) was the most important country in this group which required an annual waiver to maintain free trade status. The waiver for the PRC had been in effect since 1980. Every year between 1989 and 1999, legislation was introduced in Congress to disapprove the President&#x27;s waiver. The legislation had sought to tie free trade with China to meeting certain human rights conditions that go beyond freedom of emigration. All such attempted legislation failed to pass. The requirement of an annual waiver was inconsistent with the rules of the World Trade Organization, and for the PRC to join the WTO, Congressional action was needed to grant PNTR to the PRC. This was accomplished in late 1999, allowing the PRC to join WTO in the following year.

By Act of Congress, the United States granted permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) status to Czechoslovakia (later the Czech Republic and Slovakia), Hungary, and Romania after the fall of the communist governments in those countries. The United States granted PNTR to Albania, Bulgaria, Cambodia, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania before their countries acceded to the WTO. Before it granted PNTR, the United States invoked the non-application provision against Mongolia for more than two years after it joined the WTO on January 29, 1997. It also invoked the provision against Armenia from its WTO accession on February 5, 2003, until it was granted PNTR on January 7, 2005, and with Kyrgyzstan from when it joined the WTO on December 20, 1998, until receiving PNTR on June 29, 2000.

According to a 2005 Congressional Research Service report, as of 2005, only Cuba (see United States embargo against Cuba) and North Korea (see North Korea–United States relations), were specifically denied NTR status. The same report said that in accordance with the Jackson–Vanik amendment, Belarus and Turkmenistan had been temporarily afforded NTR treatment by presidential waiver and that Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan were temporarily afforded NTR treatment by a presidential compliance determination.

In December 2006, the U.S. granted Permanent Normal Trade Relations status to Vietnam. Vietnam had a temporary free trade status on a year-to-year waiver basis as a prerequisite for accession to the WTO since 2001.

In the same year Ukraine was granted PNTR. In December 2012, President Barack Obama signed the Russia and Moldova Jackson–Vanik Repeal and Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2012 (Magnitsky Act) granting PNTR to Russia and Moldova.

In April 2022, President Joe Biden signed a law which revokes the PNTR status for Russia and Belarus. This happened as part of a coordinated action of the European Union and G7 countries to collectively revoke any MFN status from Russia in response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

==U.S. and China==
The Trade Act of 1974 required the trade status of PRC be reviewed annually. On May 15, 2000, Representative William Reynolds Archer, a Republican from Texas, introduced H.R. 4444 to make the trade status of China permanent, saying that the bill was a top priority for the rest of the year and it was vital to the U.S. agriculture market to have access to a market that accounts for one-fifth of the world&#x27;s population 

Congress added some important points into the legislation to make sure that when the PRC entered the World Trade Organization it could be reprimanded for crimes against the workers of the country, and certain markets would be mutually exclusive between the two countries. The People&#x27;s Republic of China would need to abide by human rights for their workers as stated in the internationally recognized worker rights. To monitor the workers&#x27; rights Congress established the Congressional–Executive Commission on the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The commission was to monitor acts of China which reflect compliance or violation, compile lists of persons believed to be imprisoned, detained, or tortured due to pursuit of their human rights, monitor the development of the rule of law in China, and encourage the development of programs and activities of the U.S. government and private organizations with a goal of increasing the interchange of people and ideas. The committee formed, along with the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR), and the International Trade Commission (ITC) was to give an annual report to the President.

Congress believed that they needed to pass a bill that would help the economy stay stimulated if not have a higher growth than at the time. The most productive and trouble-free way to keep the economy growing strong was to outsource and trade more with China. China was to help provide America with superior markets in industry, agriculture, and technology. Congress as whole thought that without these things America would fall behind economically and technologically to some enemies of America. If China did not get support from America they could go to another country that would not be so strict on their treatment of people, and they could use that country to gain access to the WTO. The down side to this was that no markets could provide and receive China&#x27;s goods like the United States markets could.

The International Trade Commission&#x27;s report was the determination of China&#x27;s impacts on United States market, and how those certain disruptions can be remedied or expanded. The ITC was to find what domestic industries were being hurt by the trade and to present how the repair could be made. This was the most important part of the bill for most of the country. The bill breaks down to depending on how the different markets in the U.S. economy are doing it can use China&#x27;s markets as a catalyst to help stabilize when need be.

The bill created a stir among Congress and the American people when presented because people did not believe that America could actually do anything to help regulate China&#x27;s treatment of workers. Aside from people&#x27;s rights activists many business men believed in the bill to help flourish the different areas of industry. The legislation was passed by the House of Representatives on May 24, 2000, and by the Senate on September 19, 2000. Members of the senate wanted to add in amendments on treating their workers even better than stated in previous legislation, and to make the punishment for breaking the rules greater. Congress was up for re-election that year so due to time constraints all twenty four amendments were rejected. The President signed on Oct 10, 2000 and that day it became .

US imports from China more than quadrupled between 2000 and 2015, increasing the decline of US manufacturing jobs. Since the passing of the bill there have been three attempts to repeal the PNTR with China. The strongest attempt was in 2005 when House Representative Bernie Sanders and 61 co-sponsors introduced a legislation that would repeal the Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China. Rep. Sanders said to the House, &quot;anyone who takes an objective look at our trade policy with China must conclude that is an absolute failure and needs to be fundamentally overhauled&quot;. The Representative cited statistics, including the increase in the trade deficit and the number of American jobs lost to overseas competitors. One point that Sanders did not make due to time constraints and the legislation being passed so quickly was that nothing in the way China treats its workers has changed.

In November 2024, John Moolenaar, chairman of the United States House Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party, introduced legislation to revoke PNTR status for the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The same month, the United States–China Economic and Security Review Commission unanimously recommended revocation of China&#x27;s PNTR status.

<doc id="381069" wikidata="Q2454052" url="?curid=381069" title="Olney, Buckinghamshire">
<text>Olney (, rarely , rarely ) is a market town and civil parish in the unitary authority area of the City of Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, England. At the 2011 Census, it had a population of 6,477. 

Lying on the left bank of the River Great Ouse, the town is located around from Central Milton Keynes, and from Bedford, Northampton and Wellingborough.

== History ==
During Roman Britain, an area NE of the current town was occupied by a Roman settlement. In 2023, archaeologists uncovered a villa mosaic which were declared &quot;remains of high significance&quot;. 

Olney is mentioned as &quot;Ollanege&quot; (Olla&#x27;s island) in 932, the town has a history as a lace-making centre. According to the Domesday Book the place, later called &quot;Olnei,&quot; was held in 1086 by Geoffrey de Montbray, Bishop of Coutances, as its overlord.

During the English Civil War, Olney was the site of the Battle of Olney Bridge.

In the late 18th century, William Cowper and John Newton collaborated here on what became known as the Olney Hymns, which include Amazing Grace. The town has the Cowper and Newton Museum dedicated to them. The museum was adapted from Cowper&#x27;s former residence, which was given to the town in 1905 by the publisher William Hill Collingridge (who had been born in the house). Newton was succeeded as curate in Olney by the biblical commentator Thomas Scott (1747–1821).

The hamlet of Olney Park Farm to the north of the town of Olney derives its name from a park established in 1374 by Ralph, Third Baron Bassett of Sapcote in Leicester. In 1861 it attained civil parish status, but was subsequently incorporated into an enlarged Olney civil parish around 1931.

The 1841 census gave the population as 2,362.

=== Olney Pancake Race ===
Since 1445, a pancake race has been run in the town on many Pancake Days, the day before the beginning of Lent. Tradition records that in 1445 on Shrove Tuesday, the &quot;Shriving Bell&quot; rang out to signal the start of the Shriving church service. On hearing the bell a local housewife, who had been busy cooking pancakes in anticipation of the beginning of Lent, ran to the church, frying pan still in hand, tossing the pancake to prevent it from burning, and dressed in her kitchen apron and headscarf.

The women of Olney recreate this race every Shrove Tuesday (known in some countries as Mardi Gras or Fat Tuesday) by running from the market place to the Church of St. Peter and St. Paul, a distance of over 400 yards. The traditional prize is a kiss from the verger. In modern times, Olney competes with the town of Liberal, Kansas in the United States for the fastest time in either town to win the &quot;International Pancake Race&quot;. There is also a children&#x27;s race, run by children from the local schools. The children have to run a distance of about 20 yards. This competition has been run every year since 1950.

===Listed buildings and structures===
The parish has one grade I listed building, the Church of Saints Peter and Paul; four grade II*, and a further 114 at grade II. The church is 14th century, with later additions. There is a scheduled monument, a Romano-British settlement, on the northern outskirts of the town.

===Amazing Grace 250===
In July 2022, following the securing of funding from MK City Council, the MK Community Foundation, the National Lottery Heritage Fund and Arts Council England, the town&#x27;s Cowper and Newton Museum launched the &quot;Amazing Grace 250&quot; project to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the Amazing Grace hymn, featuring a host of exhibitions and special events in Olney, the wider Milton Keynes UA, and beyond.

== Description ==
The A509 road runs into the wide High Street bordered by historic townhouses. The Market Place is the site of a general market on Thursdays and a farmers&#x27; market on the first Sunday of each month. The vast majority of Olney shops are independent, attracting shoppers from further afield to find the galleries, antique, rug and furniture sellers, as well as boutiques for interior design, fashionable clothes and perfumery. There are restaurants, pubs, cafés and takeaways offering a wide variety of British and international food.

As Olney continues to expand with new housing estates, a secondary-level satellite campus, Ousedale School, has opened for pupils from year 7 to year 11. Olney Infants School is for reception to year 2 children and Olney Middle School takes the children up to year 6, at the age of 11.

Olney is the northernmost town in the Milton Keynes UA, Buckinghamshire and the South East England region, close to the boundary with Northamptonshire (and the East Midlands), and Bedfordshire (and the East of England).

==Transport==
===Rail===
The closest passenger rail service is at (approximately distant), with inter-city services from and railway stations (each approximately distant). Olney formerly had its own railway station on the Stratford-upon-Avon and Midland Junction Railway and the Bedford-Northampton line, but passenger services were withdrawn in 1962.

===Road===
The town is bisected by the Central Milton Keynes-Kettering A509 road, which runs southbound towards the M1 at Junction 14 (roughly distant), and northbound towards the A428 (which runs westbound towards Northampton and eastbound towards Bedford, and Cambridge further afield).

===Bus===
Bus 21 (Red Rose) connects the town with Lavendon to the north-east, and Newport Pagnell and Central Milton Keynes to the south running approximately every hour from Monday to Friday. Bus 41 (Stagecoach) connects the town with Lavendon, Bedford and Northampton, formerly running approximately every 30 minutes from Monday to Friday. In October 2022, service 41 was reduced to one service to and from Olney per day. However, in April 2023, Milton Keynes City Council stated intent to increase the frequency of the service by providing subsidised fares and discretionary funding using the UK Government&#x27;s Bus Recovery Grant scheme, with the support expected to come into effect by June 2023.

The City Council also operates an on demand bus service known as &quot;MK Connect&quot;, which serves the whole MK unitary authority area, including Olney.

==Developments==
Olney is identified by MK City Council (in local planning documents) as one of the three &quot;Key Settlements&quot; in the Milton Keynes UA outside of the 1967 &quot;designated area&quot; of the New Town, with the town&#x27;s complementary Neighbourhood Plan, adopted in May 2017, allocating a total of 300 homes for the town between then and 2031, with 30% of dwellings planned to be affordable.

== Media ==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC East and ITV Anglia. Local radio stations are BBC Three Counties Radio, Heart East and MKFM. The town is served by the local newspaper Milton Keynes Citizen.

==Governance==
Olney has been part of the Borough (now City) of Milton Keynes since 1974, which has been a unitary authority since 1997. This gives Milton Keynes City Council the responsibility for the provision of most local government services. Voters registered in the town are represented on MK City Council, which has (since 2014) been divided into 19 wards each carrying 3 councillors with Olney being part of the larger ward of the same name. 

At the parish level, Olney has a town council based at the Olney Centre on the town&#x27;s high street.

== Sport ==
=== Rugby football ===
Olney has a rugby team Olney Rugby Football Club dating to 1877.

=== Association football ===
The town&#x27;s football club, Olney Town, played in the United Counties League but closed down in 2018.

The town also has a junior football club, Olney Town Colts FC. The FA Charter Standard club has 27 teams ranging from U5s to U18s and an adult development team ensuring local players can continue playing beyond youth football.

<text>The Moscow Kremlin or simply the Kremlin is a fortified complex in Moscow, Russia. Located in the centre of the country&#x27;s capital city, it is the best known of the kremlins (Russian citadels) and includes five palaces, four cathedrals, and the enclosing Kremlin Wall along with the Kremlin towers. Within the complex is the Grand Kremlin Palace, which served as the royal residence of the Emperor of Russia. It is now the official residence of the President of the Russian Federation. The Kremlin overlooks the Moskva River to the south, Saint Basil&#x27;s Cathedral and Red Square to the east, and Alexander Garden to the west. 

The name &quot;kremlin&quot; means &#x27;fortress within a city&#x27; in Russian, and is often also used metonymically in international politics to refer to the Government of the Russian Federation. Likewise, during the Cold War, it referred to the Government of the Soviet Union, which operated out of the city in the erstwhile Russian SFSR. The term &quot;Kremlinology&quot; is related to the metonym and refers to the study of Soviet and Russian politics.

Largely open to the public, the Kremlin offers supervised tours; the accompanying Moscow Kremlin Museums reportedly attracted 1,024,610 visitors in 2023.

==History==

===Origin===
The site had been continuously inhabited by Finnic peoples (especially the Meryans) since the 2nd century BCE. The Slavs occupied the south-western portion of Borovitsky Hill as early as the 11th century, as evidenced by a metropolitan seal from the 1090s which was unearthed by Soviet archaeologists in the area. The Vyatichi built a fortified structure (or &quot;grad&quot;) on the hill where the Neglinnaya River flowed into the Moskva River.

Up to the 14th century, the site was known as the &quot;grad of Moscow&quot;. The word &quot;Kremlin&quot; was first recorded in 1331 (though etymologist Max Vasmer mentions an earlier appearance in 1320). The grad was greatly extended by Prince Yuri Dolgorukiy in 1156, destroyed by the Mongols in 1237 and rebuilt in oak by Ivan I Kalita in 1339.

===Seat of the grand dukes===
Dmitri Donskoi replaced the oak palisade with a strong citadel of white limestone in 1366–1368 on the basic foundations of the current walls; this fortification withstood a siege by Khan Tokhtamysh. Dmitri&#x27;s son Vasily I resumed construction of churches and cloisters in the Kremlin. The newly built Cathedral of the Annunciation was painted by Theophanes the Greek, Andrei Rublev, and Prokhor in 1406. The Chudov Monastery was founded by Dmitri&#x27;s tutor, Metropolitan Alexis; while his widow, Eudoxia, established the Ascension Convent in 1397.

===Residence of the tsars===
Grand Prince Ivan III organised the reconstruction of the Kremlin, inviting a number of skilled architects from Renaissance Italy, including Pietro Antonio Solari, who designed the new Kremlin wall and its towers, and Marco Ruffo who designed the new palace for the prince. It was during his reign that three extant cathedrals of the Kremlin, the Deposition Church, and the Palace of Facets were constructed. The highest building of the city and Muscovite Russia was the Ivan the Great Bell Tower, built in 1505–1508 and augmented to its present height in 1600. The Kremlin walls as they now appear were built between 1485 and 1495. Spasskie gates of the wall still bear a dedication in Latin praising Pietro Antonio Solari for the design.

After construction of the new kremlin walls and churches was complete, the monarch decreed that no structures should be built in the immediate vicinity of the citadel. The Kremlin was separated from the walled merchant town (Kitay-gorod) by a 30-meter-wide moat, over which Saint Basil&#x27;s Cathedral was constructed during the reign of Ivan the Terrible. The same tsar also renovated some of his grandfather&#x27;s palaces, added a new palace and cathedral for his sons, and endowed the Trinity metochion inside the Kremlin. The metochion was administrated by the Trinity Monastery and contained the graceful tower church of St. Sergius, which was described by foreigners as one of the finest in the country.

During the Time of Troubles, the Kremlin was held by the Polish forces for two years, between 21 September 1610 and 26 October 1612. The Kremlin&#x27;s liberation by the volunteer army of prince Dmitry Pozharsky and Kuzma Minin from Nizhny Novgorod paved the way for the election of Mikhail Romanov as the new tsar. During his reign and that of his son Alexis and grandson Feodor, the eleven-domed Upper Saviour Cathedral, Armorial Gate, Terem Palace, Amusement Palace and the palace of Patriarch Nikon were built. Following the death of Alexis&#x27;s son, Feodor, and the Moscow Uprising of 1682, Tsar Peter escaped with much difficulty from the Kremlin and as a result developed a dislike for it. Three decades later in 1703, Peter abandoned the residence of his forefathers for his new capital, Saint Petersburg.
The Golden Hall, a throne room with murals painted probably after 1547, was destroyed to make place for the Kremlin Palace, commissioned by Elizabeth of Russia and designed by the Italian architect Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli in 1752.

===Imperial period===

Although still used for coronation ceremonies, the Kremlin was abandoned and neglected until 1773, when Catherine the Great engaged Vasili Bazhenov to build her new residence there. Bazhenov produced a bombastic Neoclassical design on a heroic scale, which involved the demolition of several churches and palaces, as well as a portion of the Kremlin wall. After the preparations were over, construction was delayed due to lack of funds. Several years later the architect Matvey Kazakov supervised the reconstruction of the dismantled sections of the wall and of some structures of the Chudov Monastery and built the spacious and luxurious Offices of the Senate, since adapted for use as the principal workplace of the President of Russia.

During the Imperial period, from the early 18th and until the late 19th century, the Kremlin walls were traditionally painted white, in accordance with fashion.

French forces occupied the Kremlin from 2 September to 11 October 1812, following the French invasion of Russia. When Napoleon retreated from Moscow, he ordered the whole Kremlin to be blown up. The Kremlin Arsenal, several portions of the Kremlin Wall and several wall towers were destroyed by explosions and the Faceted Chamber and other churches were damaged by fire. Explosions continued for three days, from 21 to 23 October 1812. However, rain damaged the fuses, and the damage was less severe than intended. Restoration works were undertaken in 1816–1819, supervised by Osip Bove. During the remainder of the reign of Alexander I, several ancient structures were renovated in a fanciful neo-Gothic style, but many others, including all the buildings of the Trinity metochion, were condemned as &quot;disused&quot; or &quot;dilapidated&quot; and were torn down.

On visiting Moscow for his coronation festivities, Tsar Nicholas I was not satisfied with the Grand Palace (alias Winter Palace), which had been erected in the 1750s to the design of Francesco Rastrelli. The elaborate Baroque structure was demolished, as was the nearby church of St. John the Precursor, built by Aloisio the New in 1508 in place of the first church constructed in Moscow. The architect Konstantin Thon was commissioned to replace them with the Grand Kremlin Palace, which was to rival the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg in its dimensions and in the opulence of its interiors. The palace was constructed in 1839–1849, followed by the re-building of the Kremlin Armoury in 1851.

After 1851 the Kremlin changed little until the Russian Revolution of 1917. The only new features added during this period were the Monument to Alexander II and a stone cross marking the spot where in 1905 Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia was assassinated by Ivan Kalyayev. These monuments were destroyed by the Bolsheviks in 1918.

===Soviet period===
The Soviet government moved from Petrograd (present-day Saint Petersburg) to Moscow on 12 March 1918. Vladimir Lenin selected the Kremlin Senate as his residence. Joseph Stalin also had his personal rooms in the Kremlin. He was eager to remove all the &quot;relics of the tsarist regime&quot; from his headquarters. Golden eagles on the towers were replaced by shining Kremlin stars, while the wall near Lenin&#x27;s Mausoleum was turned into the Kremlin Wall Necropolis.

The Chudov Monastery and Ascension Convent, with their 16th-century cathedrals, were demolished to make room for the military school. The Little Nicholas Palace and the old Saviour Cathedral were pulled down as well. 

During the Second World War, in order to confuse the German pilots, the towers were repainted with different colors and covered with wooden tents. Every roof was painted rusty brown so as to make them indistinguishable from typical roofs in the city. The grounds, paved with cobblestone, were covered up with sand. Tents painted to look like roofs were stretched over the gardens, and the facades of the buildings were also painted.
The residence of the Soviet government was closed to tourists until 1955. It was not until the Khrushchev Thaw that the Kremlin was reopened to foreign visitors. The Kremlin Museums were established in 1961, and the complex was among the first Soviet patrimonies inscribed on the World Heritage List in 1990.

Although the current director of the Kremlin Museums, Elena Gagarina (Yuri Gagarin&#x27;s daughter), advocates a full-scale restoration of the destroyed cloisters, recent developments have been confined to expensive restoration of the original interiors of the Grand Kremlin Palace, which were altered during Stalin&#x27;s rule.

Overall, during the Soviet rule (1917–1991), 28 out of 54 historic buildings in the Kremlin were destroyed (among them 17 out of 31 churches and cathedrals), most of them centuries-old.

====State Kremlin Palace====

The State Kremlin Palace (alias Kremlin Palace of Congresses), was commissioned by Nikita Khrushchev as a modern arena for Communist Party meetings and was built within the Kremlin walls 1959–1961. Externally the palace is faced with white marble and the windows are tinted and reflective. The construction replaced several heritage buildings, including the old neo-classical building of the State Armoury, and some of the rear parts of the Grand Kremlin Palace. The Palace was constructed and integrated into the larger complex of the Great Kremlin Palace with walkways linking it to the Patriarchal Chambers and the Terem Palace.

==Buildings==


The existing Kremlin walls and towers were built by Italian masters from 1485 to 1495. The irregular triangle of the Kremlin wall encloses an area of . Its overall length is , but the height ranges from , depending on the terrain. The wall&#x27;s thickness is between .

Originally there were eighteen Kremlin towers, but their number increased to twenty in the 17th century. All but three of the towers are square in plan. The highest tower is the Troitskaya, which was built to its present height of in 1495. Most towers were originally crowned with wooden tents. The extant brick tents with strips of colored tiles date to the 1680s.

Cathedral Square is the heart of the Kremlin. It is surrounded by six buildings, including three cathedrals. The Cathedral of the Dormition was completed in 1479 to be the main church of Moscow and where all the Tsars were crowned. The massive limestone façade, capped with its five golden cupolas, was the design of Aristotele Fioravanti. Several important metropolitans and patriarchs are buried there, including Peter and Makarii. The gilded, three-domed Cathedral of the Annunciation was completed next in 1489, only to be reconstructed to a nine-domed design a century later. On the south-east of the square is the much larger Cathedral of the Archangel Michael (1508), where almost all the Muscovite monarchs from Ivan Kalita to Ivan V of Russia are interred. Also Boris Godunov was originally buried there but was moved to the Trinity Monastery.

There are two domestic churches of the Metropolitans and Patriarchs of Moscow, the Church of the Twelve Apostles (1653–1656) and the exquisite one-domed Church of the Deposition of the Virgin&#x27;s Robe, built by Pskov artisans from 1484 to 1488 and featuring superb icons and frescoes from 1627 and 1644.

The other notable structure is the Ivan the Great Bell Tower on the north-east corner of the square, which is said to mark the exact center of Moscow and resemble a burning candle. Completed in 1600, it is high. Until the Russian Revolution, it was the tallest structure in the city, as construction of buildings taller than that was forbidden. Its 21 bells would sound the alarm if any enemy was approaching. The upper part of the structure was destroyed by the French during the Napoleonic Invasion in 1812 and has been rebuilt. The Tsar bell, the largest bell in the world, stands on a pedestal next to the tower.

The oldest secular structure still standing is Ivan III&#x27;s Palace of Facets (1491), which holds the imperial thrones. The next oldest is the first home of the royal family, the Terem Palace. The original Terem Palace was also commissioned by Ivan III, but most of the existing palace was built in the 17th century. The Terem Palace and the Palace of Facets are linked by the Grand Kremlin Palace. This was commissioned by Nicholas I in 1838. The largest structure in the Kremlin, it cost 11 million rubles to build and more than one billion dollars to renovate in the 1990s. It contains dazzling reception halls, a ceremonial red staircase, private apartments of the tsars, and the lower story of the Resurrection of Lazarus church (1393), which is the oldest extant structure in the Kremlin and the whole of Moscow.

The northern corner of the Kremlin is occupied by the Arsenal, which was built for Peter the Great in 1701. The southwestern section of the Kremlin holds the Armoury building. Built in 1851 to a Renaissance Revival design, it is currently a museum housing Russian state Regalia and Diamond Fund.

The haloalkaliphilic methylotrophic bacterium &quot;Methylophaga muralis&quot; (first called &quot;Methylophaga murata&quot;) was first isolated from deteriorating marble in the Kremlin.

===Helipad===

To stop disruptions to traffic caused by motorcades, Russian President Vladimir Putin authorized the construction of a helipad in the Kremlin. The helipad was completed in May 2013. The Russian President will now commute back and forth to the Kremlin using a Mil Mi-8 helicopter. Careful consideration was taken in choosing the location of the helipad. The location chosen is said to be of no threat to the architecture of the Kremlin helipad.

== Stations of the Moscow Metro ==

<text>Retford (), also known as East Retford, is a market town in the Bassetlaw District in Nottinghamshire, England. It lies on the River Idle and the Chesterfield Canal. Retford is located east of Sheffield, west of Lincoln and north-east of Nottingham. The population at the 2021 census was 23,740. It is near North Wheatley. The town is bypassed by the A1 road.

The borough of East Retford was enlarged in 1878 to include Ordsall, West Retford and part of the parish of Clarborough. The East Retford constituency was a noted example of a rotten borough, being effectively controlled by local landowners the Dukes of Newcastle until reformed in the early nineteenth century. Retford and the surrounding area was also a centre of Nonconformism.

== History ==

===Origins of the name===

The origins of the town&#x27;s name are unknown and have been subject to much debate, but consensus seems to conclude that it gets its name from an ancient ford crossing the River Idle. There is considerable variation in how its name has been spelt historically, although in early usage it is usually styled as &quot;Redeforde&quot; or &quot;Redforde&quot;. A common explanation of the name is that the river water was tinged red due to the frequent crossing of people and livestock disturbing the clay river bed. Other traditions include that it refers to the reeds that are plentiful in the river, or that the name references the Battle of the River Idle which was said to tinge the Idle red with blood.

Writing in 1908, before the advent of modern etymology, local historian Edwin Wilmshurst proposed a more fanciful theory:
The historical importance of the town as a river crossing is underlined by the fact that one of the main streets is named &#x27;Bridgegate&#x27;.

The town is generally known as Retford, although the borough was officially called &quot;East Retford&quot; right up until its abolition in 1974, despite West Retford having been absorbed into the borough in 1878. The town&#x27;s charter trustees still use the name East Retford, but the Ordnance Survey now labels the town &quot;Retford&quot; on its maps, and the post town is likewise just &quot;Retford&quot;.

===Settlement===
The first land settled was on the western side of the ford, this area being less liable to flooding. However, as the community grew it spread to occupy land on the other bank of the river, and it was this eastern part of the town that eventually became more important; hence Retford&#x27;s alternative name of &quot;East Retford&quot;. The centre of Retford is characterised by a large Market Square surrounded by Georgian period architecture. The Retford Conservation Area contains the historic cores of both West and East Retford, which sit either side of the River Idle. The Conservation Area also extends southwards up to and including the 18th century Chesterfield Canal. The town also includes the small villages and hamlets that are adjacent to it, which have effectively become suburbs of the town. These include Ordsall and Babworth.

====Early history====
Evidence of early human activity around Retford stretches back to the Mesolithic period, with archaeological evidence of human activity in the area including a Mesolithic flint tool found in Ordsall, an axe from the Neolithic era (New Stone Age) from Little Morton, and a Neolithic polished flint axe discovered near the River Idle at Tiln. A Bronze Age spearhead was found near Whinney Moor Lane, and Romano-British crop marks are visible around Babworth.

The area Retford is situated in was on the border of the territories of the Brigantes and the Corieltauvi during the Iron Age period. It is likely that the existence of Retford is partly owed to its water resources, in the form of both the river Idle (and its crossing) and the wells that are dotted around the area that are either still in existence or can be identified from placename evidence. These include Spa Common, Cobwell Road (named after the Cob Well) and the ancient well at Welham (called &#x27;Wellun&#x27; in the Domesday Book).

Between Retford and Grove there are a range of earthworks of unknown date. They may be pre-historic and/or Roman. There is evidence of a medieval moated site or possible motte &amp; bailey construction. This site was later reinforced during the English Civil War. The wood here is known as Castle Hill Wood.

Roman-era artefacts are rare in Retford, although 1st–2nd century items were found at a site on Carolgate in 1922. The remains of a group of 1st–3rd century buildings were found at Babworth in 1981. A coin hoard was found at Little Morton that was dated to the 3rd century, and Roman artefacts and pottery fragments have been found at Tiln (Stroud, 2001). Evidence of Roman field patterns were identified by Derrick Riley of Sheffield University in the 1970s and 80s. Nottingham University archaeological researchers have said that during the 5th century and even into the 6th century, North Nottinghamshire was probably populated by &quot;British communities with a sub-Romano-British culture&quot;.

====Anglo-Saxon and Viking period====
Retford has traditionally been placed within the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Mercia because it is situated within Nottinghamshire. More recent historical research suggests that the South of Nottinghamshire and North Nottinghamshire may have had very different cultures. North Nottinghamshire, including Retford, belonged to an area called Bernet-seatte, which later became Bernesedelaue and then Bassetlaw. This territory is now thought to have been &quot;substantially British&quot;. It practised, for example, partible inheritance, had British placenames and there is relatively little Anglo-Saxon material. West and East Markham seem to have been on the boundaries of this territory (maerc means boundary). It is not known if Bernet-seatte extended across the whole of North Nottinghamshire, or whether the Kingdom of Lindsey controlled the East of this area (Retford and Retford rural district). What is known is that this corridor of land was seen as strategic, which is why several notable battles were fought in the area between the kings of Northumbria and Mercia.

The strategic Battle of the River Idle (617) was fought in or near Retford. The Battle of the River Idle was significant in establishing Rædwald&#x27;s power, such that Bede called him &quot;Rex Anglorum&quot; (King of the Angles). Various battlesites have been suggested including at Retford, Eaton and Bawtry. No evidence of a battlefield has been found in any of these sites, although according to Hunt this led to a saying: &quot;The River Idle was foul with the blood of Englishmen&quot;. A variant local tradition says this was the origin of the name &quot;Redforde&quot;.

Placename evidence in Retford does suggest Viking settlement. Many of the streets in the centre of town are -gates, deriving from the Old Norse &quot;gata&quot;, which means street. In Retford there are streets named &quot;Moorgate&quot;, &quot;Bridgegate&quot;, &quot;Chapelgate&quot;, &quot;Churchgate&quot; and &quot;Carolgate&quot;. Grove Street was previously known as &quot;Newgate&quot; and Lidgett Lane was originally &quot;Hildgeat&quot; or Hildgate. The Reverend WP McFarren (1947) wrote that Bridgegate was previously spelt &quot;Briggate&quot; (1340) suggesting the river had a bridge from a very early date. Moorgate contains both Anglo-Saxon (AS) and Old Norse (ON) elements, deriving from AS &quot;mor&quot; and ON &quot;gate&quot;. Its literal meaning is &#x27;miry street&#x27;. This is a reference to the beck that used to cross it. (This beck was progressively contained within a culvert and is no longer visible for most of its course into the Idle.) Carolgate is derived from the ON &quot;karla&quot; (karl) + ON &quot;gate&quot;. A karl was a freeman. WP McFarren (1947) also mentions a &#x27;Kynegesgate&#x27; (Kingsgate), which is now lost. Piercy mentions Carhillgate (p. 146).

Timber piles were found in Retford in 1995 on the western bank of the Idle at Bridgegate, which were dated to 947-1030 AD.

====Norman period and Middle Ages====
In the Domesday Book of 1086, Retford was recorded as Redforde, and joined to Odesthorpe (now unknown). It was held by the Archbishop of York and Roger de Busli, a Norman baron who was granted large amounts of land in what had been Anglo-Saxon Mercia. The Domesday Book does not distinguish between East Retford and West Retford, and it is thought that the Retford referred to in the book was West Retford. The Retford described was a relatively small settlement, with no mention of urban trades or burgesses.

East Retford was established as a new town on the east side of the Idle in the early twelfth century; the town&#x27;s charter trustees and Bassetlaw District Council say it was founded as a borough in 1105, although the earliest charter referring to it as a borough dates from the thirteenth century. There is some debate over when exactly it was granted its first charter, with Piercy (1828) suggesting it was granted in 1246 by Henry III, which allowed an eight-day annual fair to be held. However, Ballard &amp; Tait (1923) and Dolby (1997) say that there is no existing historical evidence to support this, making the 1259 charter the earliest known to have been granted. The earliest surviving charter dates from 1313 and is now held in the Bassetlaw Museum. Retford was granted a total of 17 Royal Charters (including the Letters Patent of 1225 that granted it the right to levy tolls on travellers in North Nottinghamshire) up to 1607. East Retford was only the second place to become a borough in the county after Nottingham itself; the next borough to be created in the county was Newark in 1549.

According to Marcombe (1993), the intention was for East Retford &quot;to compete with the trading privileges of Blyth Priory and to exploit the market opportunities of north Nottinghamshire&quot;. In 1225, the burgesses of Retford are said to have taken over the collection of &#x27;river tolls&#x27; from Blyth Priory.

The first town hall or &#x27;moot hall&#x27; was built in 1388 and demolished in 1754. It is believed that this may have been situated in what is now known as Cannon Square. The hall was built of timber and faced east. On the ground floor of this building was the Shambles. At that time, the present Market Square was possibly used for cattle/horses, with Marcombe suggesting this was the site of the ‘beast market’ in the Tudor period.
====Modern period====

16th century

In 1528 a fire destroyed more than three-quarters of the buildings in East Retford. By 1552 Retford&#x27;s population had dropped to 700. In 1558 there was an outbreak of plague, which caused 300 deaths in East Retford and killed half the people of West Retford. A fire in 1585 was so profound that the people of Worksop raised money for &#x27;the poor men of the late burned town of Retford&#x27;. Yet another fire struck in 1631 and caused £1,300 worth of damage.

17th century

The Civil War seems to have largely bypassed Retford, although W.E. Doubleday wrote in the &quot;Nottinghamshire Guardian&quot; (1947) that &quot;During the Civil War a Roundhead force from Retford attempted to capture the mansion occupied by the Royalist Gervase Lee, but the attack was beaten off and the besiegers compelled to retreat as a party of Cavalier troops from Newark approached rapidly&quot;. Charles I was also said to have stayed in the house of Mr Lane, a lawyer, on 20 August 1645. He was on his way from Doncaster and set off the following day to Lord Danecourt&#x27;s in Newark.(Wilmshurst 1908)

In 1657 there was a Great Storm, which destroyed the steeple and Chantries of St Swithun&#x27;s Church. This was restored in 1658 at a cost of £3,648.

18th century

Retford was more troubled during the Jacobite rising of 1745. Cornelius Brown records that in 1745 an army of 6,000 English and Hessian troops camped on Wheatley Hills and the soldiers marched through Retford and used East Retford (St Swithun&#x27;s) church as a stable. This was The Derbyshire Blues, which had been formed to protect Derby under the aegis of the Duke of Devonshire, but which retreated 50 miles to Retford when reports reached Derby that the Jacobites had a 9,000 strong army.

On 23 August 1750, an earthquake struck Retford.

In 1757 the Town Clerk successfully petitioned for the Great North Road to be diverted to run through the town, which led to an Act of Parliament (1760) authorising the re-routing of the Great North Road between Barnby Moor and Markham Moor to pass through Retford. The new turnpike was completed in 1765–66 and after this the town prospered. (Piercy 1828) Then in 1777 the Chesterfield Canal was built by James Brindley through the town.

During the 18th century improvements were made to West Retford Bridge - the main bridge over the Idle which is where the original ford was situated. Moss says that the first stone bridge was erected in 1659 and that it was thirteen feet wide and had five arches. Wilmshurst records that in 1752 the bridge was &quot;widened for carts&quot; and was replanked, suggesting that at least part of the construction was still wooden. In 1794 it was rebuilt on stone arches, according to Wilmshurst, with Moss adding that it was thirty-one feet wide at this time. Moss notes that before 1776 a toll was charged to cross the river and that to the north side were the corn mills mentioned in the Domesday Book that were once owned by Hubert de Burgh. The 1794 bridge was later to be replaced in 1886 with the current bridge, which Wilmshurst says was because of floods: &quot;In consequence of these continuous Floods the Corporation demolished the great Mill, and the narrow 5-arched Bridge, and erected present wide girder Bridge in West Retford&quot;. Moss (1908) says this bridge (which he dates as 1868) cost £1,500 to construct.

Moss (1908) tells us that in 1760 Retford&#x27;s ducking stool was used for the last time. He says it was situated at the end of a narrow street opposite the Post Office that led down the River Idle. The use of the ducking stool was granted in 1279 by Edward I and was used for the last time to punish a &quot;Scotswoman of violent temperament&quot; called &quot;Dame Barr&quot;, who was ducked for offending John White by &quot;throwing the contents of her snuff-box in his face, and uttering opprobrious terms&quot;.

19th century

In 1801 there were 5,999 people, which rose to 12,340 by 1901. Many improvements were made including the direct London to York railway being routed via the borough in 1849.

In 1831, the Gas Works was built by James Malam and gaslights were lit in the town for the first time on 22 December 1831. The Square was lit by a cast iron light bearing five gas lamps at that time. The Gas Works became a target on 2 September 1916 when a German Zeppelin dropped 14 bombs on Retford. The Retford Times (8 September 1916) noted that bombs were dropped from Zeppelin L-13 into the orchard that surrounded the Gas Works, and although there wasn&#x27;t a direct hit, shrapnel hit the sides of the gasometers setting them on fire. This fire was said to be so intense that according to the Retford Times &quot;apples [were] baked on the trees, and roosting wild birds roasted alive&quot;. The Nottingham Daily Express (8 September 1916) reported that the Zeppelin then departed &quot;at great altitude and terrific speed&quot;. The manager and his family were said to have had a very lucky escape as the shrapnel also hit their house. John Hook records that the Zeppelin left Retford at 1.05am, dropping a further bomb just south of Lea. One of the replacement gasometers later exploded on 16 March 1955, injuring 7 men and killing the manager. According to reports in The Retford Times, flames shot 200 feet into the air. The gasometers were finally dismantled when the town was connected to North Sea gas in the 1970s.

20th century
One of the main changes in Retford during the 20th century was the opening of King&#x27;s Park in 1938. The park commemorated the reign of George V and the coronation of George VI. The site was presented to the Borough by Mrs M J Huntsman of West Retford Hall, with £2000 towards the cost of the park layout raised by public subscription.

According to war records, Retford was bombed six times during the Second World War – on 26 September 1940, 30 October 1940, 16 December 1940, 15 March 1941 (2 injuries), 15 August 1941 and 25 August 1941. Although it was on the bombing route to larger targets such as Sheffield and Rotherham, was surrounded by airforce bases, and had the intersection between two railway lines, no-one was killed in the raids and the town escaped the war virtually unscathed.

The Great North Road was diverted around the town in 1961 and part of the old route through the town is now pedestrianised. The 1971 census showed the population to be 18,407. By 2001 the population had grown to 22,000 (Nicholson, 2008), with a large proportion living on housing estates in Ordsall, Hallcroft and Spital Hill.

===Historians===

John Shadrach Piercy was born in Rillington, near Malton, North Yorkshire, and moved to Retford in 1822 to teach at the National School (a school that traditionally had strong links with St Swithun&#x27;s church) on Grove Street. While living in Retford, Piercy wrote &quot;The History of Retford in the County of Nottingham&quot; (1828). This is an important work because it contains references to material that has subsequently been lost. Jones &amp; Co Solicitors hold the Piercy Manuscript.

Robert Thoroton was a physician and country gentleman who published a history of Nottinghamshire in 1667 entitled &quot;The Antiquities of Nottinghamshire&quot;. In 1796 a new edition was published by John Throsby (1740–1803), who added an additional volume. Retford is mentioned in Volume 3. pp. 274–280.

==Governance==
There are two tiers of local government covering Retford, at district and county level: Bassetlaw District Council and Nottinghamshire County Council. There is no civil parish covering the town, which has been an unparished area since 1974, but all the Bassetlaw councillors who represent the town&#x27;s wards act as charter trustees. The trustees meet four times a year, usually at Retford Town Hall, and are responsible for looking after the town&#x27;s civic traditions, including appointing one of their number as mayor each year.

===Administrative history===

East Retford was an ancient borough. When commissioners examined boroughs across England in 1835 it was reported that the town was a &quot;borough by prescription&quot;, indicating that an exact date of it being made a borough was not known. The borough corresponded to the parish of East Retford. The borough was reformed to become a municipal borough in 1836, giving it the right to appoint a mayor.

In 1837 proposals were considered to enlarge the municipal borough to take in parts of the neighbouring parishes of Clarborough, Ordsall and West Retford, where the urban area was growing beyond the historical borough and parish boundary of East Retford, but they were not implemented. Instead, both the parishes of Ordsall and West Retford were made local board districts in 1850. The borough was finally enlarged in 1878 to take in all of the parishes of Ordsall and West Retford and parts of the parish of Clarborough.

The Local Government Act 1894 said that parishes could no longer straddle borough boundaries, and so the part of Clarborough within the borough was made a new parish of North Retford. The four parishes in the borough were then East Retford, North Retford, Ordsall and West Retford; as urban parishes they did not have parish councils but were directly administered by the borough council. The four parishes within the borough were merged into a single parish called East Retford covering the whole borough in 1921.

Despite including both East Retford and West Retford from 1878, the official name of the borough remained East Retford until its abolition in 1974. The borough was abolished under the Local Government Act 1972 to become part of the wider district of Bassetlaw, named after the historical Anglo-Saxon Bassetlaw Wapentake. Charter trustees were established on the abolition of the borough to maintain Retford&#x27;s civic traditions.

The town&#x27;s coat of arms consists of two rampant choughs, which were taken from an old seal of the Borough. The crest is based on the design on a Mace presented to the Borough in 1679 by Sir Edward Neville, with few changes. A small shield replaces the original rose, upon which the lion rests its paw. The shield features a deed which references the Boroughs ancient Royal Charters. The unicorns are from the heraldry of Lord Galway, whose ancestors were High Stewards of the Borough. The shells are from the arms of Rt Hon FJ Savile Foljambe, appointed High Steward 1880.

===Constituency===
From 1316 Retford was a parliamentary borough (a constituency), entitled to two Members of Parliament, although by 1330 it was begging to be excused the privilege on the grounds of poverty, inability to afford the cost of paying the heavy expenses of the MPs&#x27; long journeys to and from the capital. The petition was granted and it was to be several generations (1571) before Retford was represented again.

The East Retford constituency gained a reputation as one of the most corrupt rotten boroughs, being effectively controlled by the Duke of Newcastle. There were vigorous debates in Parliament over whether to transfer Retford&#x27;s franchise to one of the larger unrepresented towns such as Manchester or Birmingham. Hansard records that during the House of Lords debates on the Disfranchisement Bill, the town had an active committee, led by a couple of attorneys and meeting at the Turk&#x27;s Head Inn, who were trying to make the borough seem even more corrupt than it was to ensure its extinction. One of the committee members was later seen wearing a gold watch, apparently presented in gratitude by well-wishers in Birmingham. Viscount Howick objected to the disenfranchisement of Retford not on the basis that the accusations of corruption were not true, but that it punished the innocent as well as the guilty and ignored the fact that many boroughs were equally corrupt.

The 1830 Act extended the parliamentary borough&#x27;s boundaries (which had previously matched the borough&#x27;s municipal boundaries) to encompass the Wapentake of Bassetlaw, which included the whole of the northern end of Nottinghamshire, including the town of Worksop. All those within this area who were qualified to vote in the county elections were given votes for East Retford. Within a year, Parliament was debating the Great Reform Bill, but the extended boundaries meant Retford could retain its seats until in 1885 the Municipal Borough of East Retford was reformed and the constituency replaced by an identically delineated single-member county constituency - Bassetlaw. Retford and its rural district was removed from Bassetlaw in 1983 and transferred to the redrawn Newark constituency. The boundaries were redrawn again in 2010, with Retford returning to the Bassetlaw parliamentary constituency.

The Bassetlaw constituency was held by Labour from 1929 until 2019 when the sitting Labour MP (John Mann) stood down. The current MP is Jo White who won the seat in the General Election 2024 and is part of the Labour Party. Taking the seat from Conservative Brendan Clarke-Smith

==Geography and climate==
Retford lies in a shallow, fertile river valley which has a wide flood plain on either side of the River Idle. This makes the low-lying land next to the river prone to flooding. The underlying geology is Primo-Triassic rocks which lie over coal measures. This district therefore forms part of the Nottinghamshire-Yorkshire Coalfield. To the West are Pebble Beds and Sandstone outcrops. To the east are heavy claylands of Keuper Marl.

===Weather===
Retford lies 18m above sea level and the climate is mild, and generally warm and temperate. The climate is classified as Cfb by the Köppen Climate Classification (temperate oceanic climate). The average annual temperature in Retford is 10.1 °C or 50.1 °F. Average rainfall is 685 mm or 27.0 inches. The nearest official Met Office weather station for which online records are available is an automatic station at Gringley on the Hill, about eight miles north of Retford. (Location: 53.406, -0.883)

===Flooding===

Retford lies in the Idle River Valley and low-lying areas are prone to flooding. Flooding is confined to the well-defined and wide flood plain of the Idle, and areas above the flood plain or on sandstone (to the west) do not flood. To the north and east the land is clay and the area was historically marshy (see Isle of Axholme), but was drained by Dutch engineers under Cornelius Vermuyden in the 17th century.

Hardmoors, which is adjacent to the Idle at Ordsall, was so called because it floods and freezes in winter. According to the Environment Agency, which has a gauge on the Idle at Ordsall (location ID 4164) for 90% of the time since monitoring began the Idle has had a depth of between 0.19m and 0.85m. In 2020 the range was 0.22m to 0.86m. The highest level ever recorded since the gauge was put in place was 1.79m, reached on 22 October 2023, which was during Storm Babet.

In 1947, an article in &quot;The Retford Times&quot; by Rev. W.P. McFarren notes that Moorgate (one of the principal streets) derives from the Anglo-Saxon &#x27;mor&#x27; meaning a marsh. The author notes that across Moorgate there runs a brook commonly called &#x27;The Beck&#x27;, which floods annually. He comments that &quot;The soil here is largely clay, and Moorgate was well called the &#x27;morgata&#x27; – the miry street&quot;.

Many floods are recorded in the historical record including:
* A Great Flood in 1775 which destroyed a house.
* February 1795 the town flooded.
* 1872 there were &quot;serious floods on 4 April and two other dates&quot;.
* There was a great flood in 1886 which caused considerable damage. The council demolished the bridge and built a new bridge in West Retford to facilitate the flow of water under the bridge.
* 1922 Flood.
* 1930 Flood.
* On 27 June 2007, a few low-lying parts of the town were affected by the 2007 United Kingdom floods. The majority of Kings Park was flooded under three feet of water. The Asda and Morrisons supermarkets adjacent to the river were also flooded.
* In November 2019, Retford along with the surrounding areas suffered extensive flooding along the Idle flood plain, including in the centre of town where the Idle crosses King&#x27;s Park and around the Idle bridge in Ordsall. The local hedgehog rescue centre was flooded, with locals having to rally round to save 70 rescue hedgehogs.
* In March 2020 there was flooding at Grove Lane and Blackstope Lane, with 31 properties affected after a month&#x27;s worth of rain fell in 24 hours.
* In January 2021 there was flooding on low-lying land along the course of the Idle near Victoria Road which is currently used for allotments. This resulted in another call for action against flooding which has been partly attributed to building on the natural flood plain. Restoration of the flood plain has been one solution suggested to address the issue.
* Extensive flooding was recorded and 200 houses were evacuated in October 2023 due to Storm Babet.

===Nature and biodiversity===
The area in and around Retford has a varied geology and habitat. There are 30 known Ancient woodlands of more than 2 hectares in Bassetlaw, and the town is surrounded by a rich and diverse ecosystem including rare and endangered animals and birds.

The Idle Valley Nature Reserve, which is managed by Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust (NWT) is the largest of the trust&#x27;s reserves in Nottinghamshire. The eastern boundary is created by the natural path of the River Idle; redundant gravel quarries to the west of the river have created wetland areas which comprise the majority of the site. The reserve contains many different habitats over 450 hectares, with 300 hectares being designated with SSSI status. It is the largest wetland area in Nottinghamshire and over 250 species of birds have been recorded there making it one of the top birding sites in the UK. The reserve is known for spectacular starling murmations. NWT has a program of activities and events for the benefit of schools, community groups and individuals and is becoming increasingly popular with established walking groups in the area and also neighbouring counties.

The River Idle is a critical habitat for eels – with an eel pass being installed in 2018 to help silver eels get upstream. 9 species of bats have been recorded in and around the town including Daubenton&#x27;s bat, whiskered bat, Brandt&#x27;s bat, Natterer&#x27;s bat, common noctule, Leisler&#x27;s bat, common pipistrelle, soprano pipistrelle and brown long-eared bat. And a range of mammals and amphibians can be seen such as hedgehog, frog, rabbit, brown hare, grey squirrel, toad, newts, mole, badger and red fox.

In 2021, Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust revealed that it had consulted on the re-introduction of beavers to the Idle valley and planned to release 4 beavers (2 pairs) into the 55 hectare Idle Valley Nature Reserve in the summer of 2021. The trust stated that it planned to create one of the largest beaver enclosures in England, with space for up to three beaver families. Eight beavers - four adults and four kits - were released into a specially built enclosure in November 2021, the largest release of beavers in the UK to date.


Bassetlaw has 19 Sites of Special Scientific Interest that cover broadleaved woodland, wetlands and grasslands comprising 1361 hectares. The area also has 290 Local Wildlife Sites. SSI&#x27;s around Retford, including the reason for their importance:

== Landmarks and built environment ==

===Opinions on Retford===
In &quot;The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1820-1832&quot; Retford was described as &quot;a thriving and genteel market town in the hundred of Bassetlaw, on the border with Yorkshire, [which] boasted hat and sailcloth manufacturing, but had been superseded by Worksop in the barley trade&quot;.

William White in his &quot;Directory of Nottinghamshire&quot; (1853) wrote: &quot;The approach to the town, from every side, is by a beautiful and gradual descent, and its open and spacious Market-place, surrounded by good regular buildings, and having several commodious streets of neat houses branching from it gives the whole an air of importance, comfort, and wealth, possessed but by few country towns of the same size.&quot;

In 1896, Cornelius Brown wrote that Retford was &quot;discernible from the Great Northern Railway line as a mass of red-brick houses and smoking chimneys, with the tower of an old parish church rising in their midst&quot;.
However, Retford and its environs were thought to be sufficiently attractive for the railway company to organise trips based in Retford (1908). Visitors stayed at the White Hart Hotel, with a fare inclusive of the railway journey, the drive (by four in-hand, landau, citoria or dogcart), and a couple of meals. C. Moss, author of the 1908 handbook, notes: &quot;Attention, almost at the very outset of the journey, is directed to the beauties of the drive. By a gentle incline we pass into the fair demesne of Babworth. At the foot of the declivity, Babworth Hall, the church, the rectory and the lake, wherein shrub and tree are shadowed, naturally catch the eye... Not only does the proximity of Retford to the Dukeries make the town attractive to visitors, but it is also sought after as a place of residence... One of the charms of Retford is undoubtedly its antiquity.&quot;

Nikolaus Pevsner, architectural historian, writing in 1951, was fairly scathing about Retford and its lack of distinguished buildings. &quot;A singularly unattractive town,&quot; he wrote.

Bill Bryson, the American author and former president of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, praised the town. In his bestselling book &quot;Notes from a Small Island&quot;, he writes, &#x27;Retford, I am pleased to report, is a delightful and charming place even under the sort of oppressive grey clouds that make far more celebrated towns seem dreary and tired. Its centrepiece is an exceptionally large and handsome market square lined with a picturesque jumble of noble Georgian buildings. Beside the main church stood a weighty black cannon with a plaque saying &#x27;Captured at Sevastopol 1855&#x27;, which I thought was a remarkable piece of initiative on the part of the locals - it&#x27;s not every day, after all, that you find a Nottinghamshire market town storming a Crimean redoubt and bringing home booty - and the shops seemed prosperous and well ordered.&#x27;


===Market Square===
The Square is in the centre of Retford and features an ornate French-inspired Victorian Town Hall (Grade II listed), in front of which is the Grade II listed Broad Stone.

====Broad Stone====
Legend says that the Broad Stone had a hollow in it that used to be filled with vinegar during plague times to disinfect coins. However, it is thought to be the upturned base of a boundary marker – perhaps the &quot;Dominie Cross&quot;.

A 1908 guidebook to the town says the following:

Stapleton suggested in his study of Nottinghamshire crosses that the crosses mentioned in the 1908 guide were market crosses.

====War memorial====
The Grade II*–listed war memorial is in the style of an Eleanor Cross, an octagonal structure of late Gothic design. It was unveiled by Sir Frederick Milner, the town&#x27;s former MP, in 1921. The memorial features an eternal flame, with the names of the men killed in the First World War on the lower eight panels, with bronze plaques containing the names of those killed in the Second World War. The monument was designed by architect Leonard W. Barnard FRIBA of Cheltenham, and built of Stancliffe stone from Darley Dale, Derbyshire by RL Boulton &amp; Sons. A plaque for the Korean War was unveiled and dedicated on 17 August 2008.

In addition to the main memorial in The Square, there are other war memorials in the town. For example, the Sevastopol Cannon in neighbouring Cannon Square is a memorial to those killed in the Crimean War. A window in the south aisle of St Swithun&#x27;s church (by Charles Eamer Kempe) was erected in memory of the Sherwood Rangers who fell in the Second Boer War, being unveiled in December 1903. The tablet below contains the following inscription: &quot;To the glory of God, and to the Memory of those of the Sherwood Rangers Imperial Yeomanry who died for their Sovereign and Country in South Africa, 1900-1902&quot; and after the names: &quot;This Window was dedicated by their friends&quot;. In St Swithun&#x27;s is also a set of oak boards, naming the 205 fallen members of the Parish from the First World War.

In St Saviour&#x27;s Church there is a memorial to the 65 men of the parish killed in the First World War. In the churchyard of All Hallows’ Church in Ordsall is a carved granite cross based on St Columb&#x27;s Cross in Cornwall. The inscription is in lead letters and reads: &quot;1914-1918/ 1939-1945/ In Proud Remembrance Of Those Who Did Not Return.&quot; No names are given. This is a replacement (1951) for an earlier wooden cross, and is Grade II listed. There is also a memorial window in All Hallows’ church. Fives Court is a Grade II listed monument of the Rugby Fives type, but without the usual back wall, and was built at the former King Edward VI school site by the mother of William Eyre, a former pupil who died in the First World War. The plaque reads: &quot;In Memory Of Capt. William Eyre; Who Died Of Wounds; August 19th 1916; Their Name Liveth Forever More.&quot; Bassetlaw Council notes that the year of death is incorrect (it should read 1915).

====Town Hall====
Retford has had two known moot halls, and two town halls (including the current building). The earliest known moot hall dated from 1388. The building was in the old market square, North of the current market square. Like many early buildings the moot hall was almost certainly badly damaged in the 1528 fire. It was replaced in 1528 but according to Piercy by 1754 was in such a poor state of repair that the corporation decided to demolish it. It was replaced in 1755 by a town hall designed in the neoclassical style by Messrs White and Watson. This hall was demolished in 1868 because it had become an obstruction to traffic.

It was decided to move the town hall to a new site to the south of the current market place to alleviate the problem with traffic. The current Retford Town Hall was designed in the Italianate style on the new site by Bellamy and Hardy and dates from 1868.

===Cannon Square===
Just across from the Market Square is Cannon Square which has St Swithun&#x27;s Church and a cannon captured from the Russians during the Siege of Sevastopol at the end of the Crimean War in 1856.
 The cannon, supporting plinth, lamp arch and iron posts with chains are all listed (Grade II). The cannon arrived in Retford in April 1858 by rail. It was given the name ‘The Earl of Aberdeen’ and was officially unveiled on 17 February 1859 by Gunner Cole (of the Royal Artillery). It was removed during the scrap drive of the Second World War, but was rescued by Alderman Alfred Wilson. The cannon was reinstated after the Second World War, set on a new wooden gun carriage, being officially unveiled on 29 March 1950 by the Mayor of Retford, Councillor T. Richmond.

In 2006 the Sebastopol Cannon was taken away to be restored through funds raised by the Retford Civic Society and on 16 September it was re-installed and a day of celebration was held to re-enact the original arrival of the cannon in 1858. The Retford Civic Society had a replica cannon built especially for the occasion and it was paraded through the town as part of the celebration.

In 2019 The Crimea Memorial was sited in the exhibition cupboards in Retford Town Hall. It records the names and regiments of 24 local men who served in the Crimean War (1854–56).

===King&#x27;s Park===

Kings&#x27; Park was opened on 29 June 1938, to commemorate not only the reign of King George V, but also the Coronation year of King George VI. The site for the original park occupies the land from Chancery Lane to the River Idle and was donated by Mrs M Huntsman of West Retford Hall in 1937. A public appeal by the Borough of East Retford at the time raised £2,000 towards the estimated cost of £8,000 (equivalent to £485,000 today) to develop the park.

In 1960 a further donation of land by R H Williamson to the west of the River Idle allowed for an extension to the park within the former grounds of the historic West Retford Hall, which dates from 1699 and still stands outside the north-west boundary of the park.

Kings Park has received many awards, including winning the prestigious Britain&#x27;s Best Park competition in the Midlands region (2007). It also received the Green Flag Award in both 2008 and 2009, and was voted the UK&#x27;s fifth-favourite park in 2014 in the People&#x27;s Choice Vote. It is described as a &#x27;jewel in the crown&#x27; by Bassetlaw council.

The Park now covers some 10 hectares on either side of the Idle River, just off the town centre. In addition to formal gardens, it contains large areas of grassland suitable for ball games and picnics, a children&#x27;s water play area, bowling greens, tennis courts, skate park, children&#x27;s play ground, a performance stage, rose gardens, wildlife gardens and public conveniences.

===Sloswicke’s Hospital===

Sloswicke&#x27;s Hospital is a Grade II* listed building founded in 1657 from money left in Richard Sloswicke&#x27;s will to found almshouses &quot;for the maintenance of six poore old men of good carriage and behaviour to the end of the world.&quot; The present building dates from 1806; an additional pair of houses being added in 1819.

===Trinity Hospital===

Trinity Hospital Retford is a Grade II listed alms house, set in gardens off Hospital Road. It was established over 340 years ago through the will of John Darrell. The current building on Hospital Road was designed by Edward Blore with 1872 additions.

===Corporation Almshouses, Union Street===
Consisting of a terrace of nine almshouses, which were built for £1,100 in 1823 for women of the town.

=== Amcott House ===
A Grade II* listed 18th century townhouse on Grove Street, which was rebuilt in its current brick and slate style by Retford M.P. Wharton Amcott around 1780. Previously, a 17th-century house belonging to the Wharton family stood on the site. Inside the current building are original features such as ornamental plasterwork ceilings and a wrought-iron staircase. From the 1870s until the 1930s the house belonged to the Pegler family, founders of the Northern Rubber Company. The building was bought by the former East Retford Rural District Council following Stephen Pegler&#x27;s death and used as council offices. In 1983 it became the site of the Bassetlaw Museum.

===Other buildings of note===

The town does not have any Grade I listed buildings (the highest level of protection), but has six Grade II* and 123 Grade II listed buildings.

===Spa Common===
There were originally two commons in Retford - Spa Common and Far Common. Today only Spa Common remains. It is located behind Carolgate, lying adjacent to the Chesterfield Canal. The common gets its name because there used to be a spa in the North East corner of the common.

Retford sits on Artesian aquifer – with rain water filtering through the Bunter sandstone. Before mains water was established, most houses had their own wells or used communal wells. One of these wells was located on what is now called Spa Common. The water from this well developed a reputation for being able to cure various ailments whether drunk or used to wash in. An article in &quot;The Retford Times&quot; newspaper (5 July 1957) that was compiled from the notes of the historian, John Piercy, noted that he had personally tried the water and said it was red in colour and tasted of ink.

J.C. Short MD, writing in 1734, says that at that time the water on Spa Common bubbled to the surface inside a handsome freestone basin which itself was enclosed in a pleasant, decorated building shaped like a pyramid. He says that the red colour of the water was probably the result of iron oxide, and that it developed a white scum on the surface when left standing, due to the presence of gypsum.

The building mentioned by Short was later demolished by John Kirke and John Hutchinson, according to Piercy, before Robert Hudson re-opened the well. This building was also subsequently demolished and today there is no trace of the spa on the Common.

== Religion and places of worship ==
A circle 30 miles in diameter drawn around Retford encompasses an area that has had an enormous global impact on Christianity. Every English-speaking nonconformist church in the world can trace its origins back to this area.

===St Michael the Archangel===
The limestone built, Grade II* listed St Michael the Archangel church, West Retford was dedicated in 1227 and sits on an elevation on Rectory Road. The oldest part of the church is the south aisle and the chapel dedicated to Oswald of Northumbria. Its outstanding feature is the octagonal spire on a square tower (a &#x27;broach&#x27; spire) which is said to be an exact, early 14th century replica of the spire of St Michael at Rouen in Normandy. At that time, Lincoln Cathedral was served by Norman priests from Rouen, and as the Manor of West Retford was among the Manors granted to Roger-de-Buesli, it is almost certain that this and other churches in Nottinghamshire were designed and built by Norman architects from Rouen.

Originally, the spire was surmounted by an iron cross, but in 1855 a severe gale damaged the tip of the spire and the cross was replaced by the current weather vane. It is the crocketted spire and tower that was referred to by Pugin as &quot;a poem in stone&quot; and by Nikolaus Pevsner (1979) as &quot;remarkable&quot;. There are six bells in the tower, the largest tenor bell weighing 9cwt in A Flat is dated to 1619 and is inscribed &quot;Jesus be our speed&quot;, the 5th bell was originally cast in 1620 and recast in 1884 by Mr Taylor of Loughborough at the cost of £200 raised by public subscription. There is an inscription on this bell that reads &quot;Fili Dei Misere Mei&quot; – &quot;Son of God have Mercy on me&quot;. The other four bells were cast in the 19th century.

St Oswald&#x27;s chapel is the oldest part of the church. There is a carved statue of St Oswald in a niche on one of the pillars in the south aisle, which was placed there in the 19th century. The church was significantly restored in 1863 by notable Gothic Revival architect James Fowler. The window above the altar depicts St Michael and was designed by the architect William Butterfield in memory of the Rev Charles Butterfield, rector of West Retford parish from 1857 to 1866. In the small chapel at the end of the north aisle, also known as the &#x27;Mary chapel&#x27;, there is a reredos by Sir Ninian Comper.

Within the grounds of St Michael&#x27;s is a stone known as the ‘preaching cross’. It is thought this could be an old boundary cross (Stapleton) or a plague stone (Percy), being the West Retford equivalent to the Broadstone. During the Georgian and Victorian periods this stone sat on the top of the boundary wall before being moved to its current location in the late-19th or early-20th century.

===St Swithun&#x27;s===

St Swithun&#x27;s Church, East Retford is a Grade II* listed church in East Retford that is dedicated to St Swithun and founded in 1258. The church is located in the centre of town between Churchgate and Chapelgate.

St Swithun&#x27;s is of cruciform shape, now mainly of perpendicular architecture, but still preserving in its south and west doorways, and in the tracery of some of its windows, marks of earlier styles. In 1528 there was a great fire in Retford which damaged the church. In 1535, we learn that: &quot;Where sumtyme were iiii chauntries which now er in decaye by reason they er consumed wt. fyer.&quot; The tower and chancel collapsed in 1651 and were rebuilt in 1658. The current building is therefore largely the work of restorers of 1658, 1854-5 and 1905.

The church has a square, battlemented tower, containing a clock and 10 bells. The oldest, virtually untouched, part is the north transept, although it has now been transformed into a chapel as a war memorial. The tower is supported by four massive arches and the nave and aisles are separated by arcades of five bays. There is a stone pulpit, an eagle lectern in oak, and a large organ erected in 1841. In the north transept is an incised slab to Henry Smyth (d 1496) and Sir Whatton Amcotts (d 1807) by William Kinnard, architect. The Victorian stained glass includes work by Clayton and Bell, Charles Eamer Kempe, Michael O’Connor, Hardman &amp; Co, William Wailes and George Shaw.

The figure over the southern door is locally said to be of St Swithun, but according to Kidson is of a bishop. He says the figure was brought from a dissolved monastery in Portugal and was given to the Church, and placed in its present position, in about 1895.

The British Museum contains several architectural drawings of East Retford Church by Samuel Hieronymous Grimm. These include a general view of the exterior, and a drawing of the tracery of the east window. There are also drawings by Thomas Kerrich (1748–1828) including a drawing of a window which used to be in the Chancel, but which no longer exists.
John Buckler (1770–1851) made several drawings of the church, including one of the figure in the vesica piscis, at the beginning of the nineteenth century.

===St Joseph===

Catholics mainly worshipped in homes following the reformation and up until the 20th century, although demand for a Catholic church rose with an increase in Irish workers and Italian immigrants in the 19th and early 20th centuries. In 1895 a piece of land was purchased on the corner of Queen Street and Pelham Road and what came to be known locally as the &quot;tin chapel&quot; was constructed. A nearby house on Pelham Road was used by the priest.

As the Catholic community continued to expand it was decided to build a bigger church and land was purchased on the Babworth Road. The present Catholic church - St Joseph&#x27;s - opened in 1959 and was designed by Ernest Bower Norris in modern Romanesque design, incorporating Art Deco elements. The church was later reordered in 1968 by renowned Modernist architect Gerard Goalen, at which time a large sculpture by Steven Sykes was introduced. St Joseph&#x27;s is prominently located on Babworth Road and its campanile serves as a local landmark. In its Conservation Plan, Bassetlaw Council says: &quot;The bell tower with copper roof is one of the most prominent architectural features within the entire Conservation Area.&quot; Next to the church is St Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Primary School.

===All Hallows, Ordsall===

Ordsall is a village that is now a suburb of Retford. Its church All Hallows is a Grade II* listed building. The first recorded rector is in 1277. The current building dates from that period but was rebuilt in the 19th century by TC Hine of Nottingham. The church has a short, square tower with diagonal buttresses that is thought to date from the 15th century. The upper parts of the tower had to be repaired in 1823 after it was struck by lightning.

The church&#x27;s east window is by Camm Brothers of Smethwick and dates from 1877, as is the window in the north aisle east (1881). In the chancel there is a window by James Powell and Sons (Flint memorial, 1923) and another by Charles Eamer Kempe (Hall memorial, 1905). There are a number of unusual brass plates in the south aisle, dating from the 17th and 18th centuries. In the north aisle is a memorial made of Nottinghamshire alabaster with kneeling figure between Corinthian columns (c 1600–20).

===St Saviour&#x27;s, Retford===

St Saviour&#x27;s is a Grade II listed church in Retford at the top of Moorgate Hill. It was designed by the Lincoln architect Edward James Willson, FSA and was completed in 1829. It was the first major project by Willson and cost £4,000.

At the West End of the building are a pair of octagonal towers which have ogee shaped, lead covered, caps. The church is built in yellow brick, which has weathered to dark grey. There is a brass plaque at the church which says the following: &quot;This first stone of the new chapel dedicated to the Saviour, and containing silver and copper coins of the reign of George the Fourth, was laid on the second day of June, AD 1828, by Henry Clark Hutchinson Esq., of Welham.&quot; The church was restored and repewed in 1877–8. In 1936 there was a reduction in seats and the removal of the side galleries. A major reordering of the inside of the church was carried out in 2001, removing the oak pews and replacing them with individual seats.

The building seems to be far bigger than was required. BJ Biggs in &#x27;Looking at Old Retford&#x27; (p14) notes: &quot;There were 1,040 sittings and it is interesting to speculate whether they were ever fully occupied. At the time of the census of 1851 there was an average morning congregation of 300 adults and 123 children, and an average evening attendance of 400.&quot;

===Methodist Chapel===


The current Grade II listed Methodist chapel in Grove Street dates from 1880 and was built by Bellamy and Hardy, who were also the architects of Retford Town Hall. Its listing states that the chapel retains a high quality of architectural and artistic embellishment in both the external and internal detail. The oval galleries are an architectural expression of distinctive worshipping practice and there has been minimal alteration to the original fabric or fittings. The chapel contains flooring laid in the early 20th century, an example of the terrazzo and mosaic craft of Italian immigrant craftsmen.

===Nonconformists===
Retford and its rural district contain a large number of historic churches. The area has a strong nonconformist tradition. In addition to the Methodist chapel on Grove Street there are other non-conformist chapels around the town. Some are in use as places of worship and others are now used for other purposes.

&quot;Pilgrim Fathers&quot;

The Pilgrim Fathers, a name commonly applied to early Separatist settlers of the Plymouth Colony in present-day Massachusetts originated from the villages of Babworth and Scrooby on the outskirts of Retford between 1586 and 1605. At the time they were known as &#x27;Separatists&#x27; and only a few left Nottinghamshire, most stayed behind to try and reform the church from within. The Denmans were a prominent Retford family who were Nonconformists but chose to remain in Retford.

Retford&#x27;s Bassetlaw Museum was awarded £776,000 (including £450,000 of National Lottery Funding) in 2018 to create a gallery dedicated to telling the story of the Pilgrim Fathers. The gallery was opened by Dr Jeremy Bangs, director of The Leiden American Pilgrim Museum in the Netherlands, the Lord Lieutenant of Nottinghamshire, Sir John Peace, and chairman of Bassetlaw District Council, Cllr Debbie Merryweather in 2019. 

&quot;The Society of Friends&quot;

Retford played a role in the early history of the Society of Friends (commonly known as Quakers). In 1652(?) James Parnell converted to the faith after walking 150 miles from Retford to Carlisle and visiting George Fox in gaol. Parnell had been born in Retford and attended the King Edward VI Grammar School. He became a well known preacher, writer and advocate of Quakerism before dying in Colchester in 1656 at the age of 19(?). He was regarded as being a martyr and became known as &#x27;The Boy Martyr&#x27;.

&quot;Methodism&quot;

Retford was involved in the early history of Methodism, with John Wesley preaching in the town square in 1779. However, Methodism was said to have been introduced to the town by a Scot named John MacFarlane in 1776. When Wesley visited in 1779 &quot;a mob of local rowdies&quot; planned a warm reception, led by a certain John Willey. In the end, because of MacFarlane and his supporters, this was limited to the throwing of a bad egg, which missed Wesley but hit his sister. She was said to have retaliated with a torrent of abuse that made the crowd laugh.

Retford&#x27;s first Methodist chapel opened the same year as Wesley&#x27;s visit. This chapel was deemed too small for the crowd expected for his second visit to Retford when he was 83 years old. According to Wesley&#x27;s journal he preached first at the New Inn, afterwards at Newark, and in the evening at Retford. Biggs (1967) records that there is a tablet in the wall of a house in Bridgegate, marking the spot where Wesley preached under a pear tree in an orchard just over the Idle in the parish of West Retford. Moss (1908) notes that the inscription states that in an orchard on this site on the evening of 24 June 1786, a sermon was preached by the Rev. John Wesley, M.A., from the words &#x27;I saw the small and great stand before God&#x27;.

Biggs (1968) records that John MacFarlane fell on hard times in later life but refused a place in Trinity Hospital because it would mean he would have to attend West Retford Church saying he would not &quot;sell his soul to the devil for a place&quot;. Instead, he entered the workhouse, where he was known as &quot;Johnny Mac-farthing&quot;. Friends conducted him to the stone-laying in Newgate Street where he laid a stone. He died in 1824 and was buried in the Methodist cemetery on Grove Street.

===Other places of worship in Retford===
* The Bridge Church, Bridgegate, Retford
* The Well, Hospital Road, Reford – a Baptist church
* St Alban&#x27;s Church, London Road – a Grade II listed, stone-built Edwardian church that fell into disuse and was gutted by fire in 2008
* Salvation Army, Exchange Street, Retford
* Hallcroft Methodist Church, Retford
* All Saints, Babworth – a Grade I listed church on the outskirts of Retford in the village of Babworth

== Economy ==

===Current economy of Retford===
Since the 1980s many of Retford&#x27;s long-established companies such as Jenkins Newell Dunford (engineering) and Bridon Ropes (wire rope) have closed, with the economy becoming more services-based.

Retford is an important commercial centre for the local area, with large supermarkets, many independent shops and a market every Thursday, Friday and Saturday. In 2013, Retford&#x27;s town centre had an empty shop rate of only 9%, 5% less than the national average. Bassetlaw Council refurbished Retford market square at a cost of £1.5 million as well as investing £2.5 million in Retford Enterprise Centre.

Retford has a strong economy mainly consisting of services with some light industry. Retail, health, manufacturing, education and accommodation are major employers. There is also a high representation of arts &amp; recreational, finance &amp; insurance jobs.

The town has a very low unemployment rates compared to the national average. In 2018, Nottinghamshire County Council calculated unemployment in Retford as follows: East Retford South (1.8%), East Retford North (1.6%), East Retford East (1.5%), East Retford West (1.3%). This compares to 1.7% for Bassetlaw as a whole and 4.4% nationally. The highest rate of unemployment in Bassetlaw at this time was in Worksop South East (3.5%) According to the ONS, 61% of people work locally (2011 Census ONS), which is far lower than neighbouring areas. Strong transport links mean that many Retford workers commute to neighbouring towns and cities such as Sheffield, Doncaster, Mansfield and Lincoln; some commute to London.

The Northern Rubber Company, which was established in 1871 by Alfred Pegler has evolved into the specialist aerospace components manufacturer Icon, employing 200+ people on Thrumpton Lane, Retford. Langley Holdings is based in Retford and owns more than 80 subsidiaries including Piller, Druck Chemie, Oakdale Homes, Protran and Claudius Peters. Langley&#x27;s subsidiaries produce components for the automotive industry, parts for Airbus wings, and supply back-up power for data centres amongst other activities. In 2012 Langley Holdings bought the sheet-fed operations of German printing press company Manroland Sheetfed out of insolvency for £140 million.

Brewing was traditionally an important industry in Bassetlaw with brewers such as Worksop &amp; Retford Brewing Company. Retford was also an important hop market. This tradition was revived by a number of microbreweries based in or near the town including Broadstone Brewery (1999–2006), Idle Valley Brewing (2014–2018), Harrisons Brewery (2018–), Pheasantry Brewery in East Markham (2012–) and Springhead in Laneham (1990–).

===Historical economy of Retford===
Retford did not experience the large-scale industrial growth of nearby towns and remained primarily a rural market town. Historically it traded agricultural produce, but has also been a producer of hats, sail-cloth, rope, sack bags, paper and leather.

In 1788 Major John Cartwright, the older brother of Edmund Cartwright inventor of the power loom, built The Revolution Mill on Spital Hill, near the Chesterfield Canal. The mill was a steam-powered wool spinning and weaving mill employing around 600 people. The ambitious enterprise, however, failed a few years later and the site and machinery were eventually sold at great loss in 1805. Only one building survives.

Hezekiah Clark of Derby came to work in Cartwright&#x27;s mill in the 1780s as a dyer. After the Mill failed he set up as a dyer in Retford in 1798, resulting in the business Clarks of Retford. This business gave its name to Dyers Court in Retford. The company eventually became known for its dry cleaning and laundry services, and had 138 shops before it ceased trading in the 1980s. The business is commemorated by a mural in Dyer&#x27;s Court.

The Bolham Paper Making Company made glazed papers, shop papers, boards, boxboards; other new paper mills were built in the mid-19th century, including a mill on Albert Road (1867). Foundries and iron works were also established. The Beehive Works was built in Thrumpton in 1873 and William Bradshaw set up his Carr Foundry in Albert Road which specialised in heating and rainwater pipes, gutters, stoves, fireplaces and general engineering castings. The late nineteenth century also saw the introduction of new technologies when the Northern Rubber Company was created by Alfred Pegler in 1871. The factory&#x27;s proximity to the junction of two important railways helped it prosper.

The agricultural land surrounding Retford was an important area for hop growing from the seventeenth century onwards. According to DCD Pocock, &quot;Retford, as the most northerly hop fair in the country, was of special importance until the breaking down of traditional economic watersheds and marketing limits with the advent of rail transport&quot;. These North Clay hops (named after the North Clay Division of which Retford is part) were considered much stronger than Kentish hops and were used in the original Nottingham Brewery&#x27;s bitter beers. At the beginning of the 19th Century 11,000 acres of hops were grown, which had dwindled to 29 acres by 1880. Hops are no longer cultivated in the area.

===The role of women in Retford&#x27;s economy===

Women have played an important role in the economy of Nottinghamshire particularly in certain industries (such as lace making and farming). In Retford women were always economically active and some businesses relied heavily on female labour (such as Clark&#x27;s of Retford).

Until the Black Death, most beer in the UK was produced by women. The term for a female brewer is &#x27;brewster&#x27;. Brewing was an important industry in Nottinghamshire from hop growing, to brewing to selling beer. Nottinghamshire women have had considerable involvement in all aspects of the brewing trade, with many historic Retford pubs being recorded as having female managers.

Women-owned businesses were also relatively common in Retford. For example, Piercy mentions in 1828 that the Post Office in Grove Street is run by the post mistress Miss Elizabeth Barker. Three years later, White&#x27;s 1831 directory notes it is run by Mrs Elizabeth Taylor. The postal service seems to have historically involved women workers in Retford. Moss (1908) noted there were four deliveries of letters per day and says: &quot;Within living memory the letters were distributed by one woman, &#x27;Old Betty Chapman.&#x27;&quot;

Women are recorded in the 1831 directory undertaking a number of other trades. Mary Clark and Catherine Dean were grocers; Mary Stocks was a boat owner; Mrs Jane Taylor, Frances Holliday, Susanna Slaney and Elizabeth Wilkinson were stay makers; Faith Walker was a farmer; Margaret Holderness was a bookseller; Ellen Lawrence was a shoemaker; Mary Burley was a China and Glass dealer; Ann Appleby, Ann Colbeck, Sarah Graves, Mary Penington and Susan Penington were straw hat makers; Ann Burton, Mary Chester and Jane Walker were shopkeepers. Several Retford public houses were also run by a landlady at that time.

The first female councillor on Retford Town Council was Mrs Ellen Gentle Howell, born in 1872 in Huckle, Luton, who was elected in 1926, becoming Mayoress of Retford. Not until 1951 did a woman become mayor of Retford in her own right: Mrs M E Williamson JP, who was also the Chair of Governors of Retford High School for Girls, and who became the first woman Alderman on Retford Town Council (1961). The first female magistrate in Retford was Miss Grace M Bradshaw, who sat on the Retford Borough Bench (1933) and was also appointed to the Retford County Bench in 1934. Bradshaw was also the Chairman of Governors of the County High School for Girls, Retford and secretary of the Retford Ladies Health Association.

The work of the WVS of Retford is celebrated with a plaque at Retford train station, which states that between March 1940 and March 1946 they served 2,284,000 meals to HM and Allied Forces in the canteen and rest room.

== Transport ==
===Roads===
Retford was historically on the Great North Road. It is now bypassed by the A1 trunk road and the A57 which links Retford to a number of major towns and cities, with London just over two hours away. The East Retford bypass was built in three stages mostly along what was previously the A57.

In 1957, the West Drayton diversion opened up to the B6387 near Elkesley. Also near Elkesley and Gamston is the Retford Gamston Airport. The section from Elkesley bypass to Five Lane Ends (A614 junction) at Apleyhead Wood opened in 1958, and the third section was from Five Lane Ends to north of Checker House at Ranby (A620 junction). Recent investment led to a renovation of junctions at Blyth, Great Whin Covert and Markham Moor.

===Buses===

The town is served by several bus operators including Stagecoach in Bassetlaw, Stagecoach in Lincolnshire and TM Travel; route destinations include Worksop, Newark, Nottingham and Doncaster. Retford bus station is also the terminus of the 450 National Express coach service between Victoria Coach Station in London and Retford.

The current bus station was built and opened on 30 July 2007, at a cost of £1.4 million, and was given a highly commended accolade in the infrastructure category of the UK Bus Awards 2008. The previous bus station, on the same site, was a collection of bus shelters, but also allowed vehicles to drive illegally through it; the new facility has new traffic controls in order to prevent this.

===Railway===

Retford railway station is at a junction of two railway lines:
* The East Coast Main Line links London, Yorkshire and Scotland; services are operated by London North Eastern Railway. Trains take from 1hr 20 minutes to 
* The Sheffield–Lincoln line which provides trains to , , , , and . Services are operated by Northern Trains.

Retford station was Grade II listed by Historic England in July 2020. The buildings date from 1891 to 1892 and the reason for listing was given as: &quot;the very rare survival of the original finishes in the dining room and refreshment room&quot; which are said to be ornate and featuring &quot;fine craftsmanship&quot;; the &quot;remarkably long and well-balanced composition in the Italianate style&quot; of the station buildings and the &quot;impressive&quot; canopy over the platform; and the well-preserved plan form which make it &quot;one of the most intact medium-sized GNR stations.&quot;

===Canal===

Retford is connected to the UK Inland Waterways network by the Chesterfield Canal. Up to Retford, the canal was built to be accessible by broad-beam boats rather than the more usual narrowboats; Retford Town Lock was the first narrow lock on the canal from its junction with the River Trent at West Stockwith. However, narrow sections now prevent such craft reaching Retford. The canal starts at Chesterfield in Derbyshire.

The canal was built to export coal, limestone and lead from Derbyshire; iron from Chesterfield; and corn, deals, timber, groceries and general merchandise into Derbyshire; it is now used for leisure purposes. Based in Retford, on the lower side of the Town Lock, is a boat club called &quot;Retford Mariners Boat Club&quot;, (R.M.B.C), which was formed in November 1978 by a group of canal enthusiasts.

The Chesterfield Canal hit international headlines in 1978. While dredging the bottom of the canal to remove rubbish, a maintenance team pulled up a large chain which had a wooden plug attached to it. Later that day, it was noticed that a whirlpool had formed and it became evident that the section of the canal between Whitsunday Pie Lock and Retford Town Lock was losing water. Unbeknown to the workmen, but commonly known locally, the plug was an original engineering feature of the canal to allow sections to be drained for future maintenance. The water drained (as designed) harmlessly into the nearby river Idle. The accidental removal of the plug became a national and international story; it was even recorded in Lloyd&#x27;s List.

An early twentieth century crane situated at Retford Wharf was Grade II listed by Historic England in 1996.

===Air===

Retford (Gamston) Airport is a private airport, located a few miles south of Retford in the village of Gamston; it is operated by Gamston Aviation Ltd.

== Leisure, entertainment, traditions ==
===Museum===
Retford is home to the Bassetlaw Museum, which was created in 1983 and has a number of collections donated by people in the local area. The museum tells the history of North Nottinghamshire from its earliest people to the present day. Collection highlights include: Carlton-in-Lindrick knight, Anglo-Saxon boat and autochromes by Stephen Pegler. It was voted the Nottinghamshire Museum of the Year in 2009, following extensive renovation, and is based in the Grade II* listed Amcott House.

In 2002, the Heritage Lottery Fund gave the museum a grant of £78,000 to enable the purchase and digitisation of 20,000 negatives taken by professional photographers Edgar Welchman and Son of Grove Street, Retford between 1910 and 1960. The photograph collection at the Museum contains over 27,000 photographs of the towns and villages of North Nottinghamshire and people who lived there from about 1870 onwards. 8,000 general photographs from the museum&#x27;s collections have been added to the Welchman Project images.

In 2019 The Pilgrims Gallery was added as part of a £750,000 Heritage Lottery funded project to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the Mayflower&#x27;s voyage to America in 1620. The Gallery features a recreation of William Brewster&#x27;s study.


===Theatres and cinemas===
Piercy mentions a theatre situated on &quot;the west side, and nearly in the centre, of Carrhillgate&quot; which was built in 1789 by Mr William Pero who purchased the ground from Sir Thomas Woolaston White.
Retford now has two theatres in the town: the Grade II listed Majestic Theatre, which hosts famous entertainers, music concerts from local performers and plays, and Retford Little Theatre, a smaller theatre which hosts the Retford Little Theatre amateur drama group.

The Majestic is an Art Deco building designed by Alfred John Thraves for Cyril Getliffe as a joint cinema and theatre building on Coronation Street, Retford. It opened with a stage production of &quot;No, No, Nanette&quot; in 1927. It was closed three times, threatened with demolition and has been used as a bingo hall. In 1993 it was bought by The Retford Theatre Trust and since 1996 a small group of volunteers have restored its original features. It is now Grade II listed.

Retford also had a cinema built around 1917 called The Picture House, later The Roxy, which stood on Carolgate and was also owned by Cyril Getliffe. It was demolished in the 60s.

The Regent Theatre is an Art Deco cinema opened in Carolgate in 1911 and renamed The Ritz in 1934. It closed in 1957 and the building became a Masonic hall in 1962. It can now be hired for weddings and other events.

===Historic pubs===
According to Cornelius Brown, a licence was granted to John Watson and his wife in 1625 to keep a tavern and sell whisky, with a payment of £3 per annum due to the king.

The Retford area had a thriving hops industry and traditionally a large number of pubs, because it was situated on the Great North Road. White, in his 1831 trade directory, records 27 public houses and 11 beer houses, which had increased by 1896 to 56 Inns and 3 beer houses. Retford&#x27;s pubs have played an important part in its social, cultural and political history. For example, The Duke of Newcastle&#x27;s True Blue Club met in The Turk&#x27;s Head.
Many of the historic public houses are listed buildings. Historic pubs include:
* The White Hart, an historic (Grade II–listed) 18th-century coaching inn that has a cobbled yard and stabling for horses. At its peak it saw 19 stages a day pass through.
* The Vine Inn (Grade II–listed), an 18th-century public house
* Whitehouse Inn (Grade II–listed) an 18th-century inn on the south edge of town.
* The Olde Sun on Chapelgate is a Grade II–listed timber-framed building that dates from the 16th century and is one of the oldest buildings remaining in the town
* The Crown Inn (building still exists but no longer a pub) dates from 1754; was once the principal place of conducting business in the town
* The Queen&#x27;s Head, a Grade II–listed public house on Moorgate
* New Inn Public House (building still exists but no longer a pub), a Grade II–listed building on Whinney Moor Lane
* The Black Boy, a Grade II–listed 19th-century public house on Moorgate
* The Turk&#x27;s Head which replaced an earlier building and was built in the 1930s. Many original features remain
* The Elms Hotel, an early 19th-century detached stucco house on London Road
* Galway Arms, an early 19th-century public house on Bridgegate that was previously called the Mermaid Inn
* Newcastle Arms on Bridgegate. An historic Grade II listed former pub, now used as housing.
* The Anchor, a Grade II listed early 19th-century public house on Carolgate now called &#x27;The Idle Valley Tap&#x27;.
* The Sherwood Ranger on Churchgate which was built in the late 1800s and was originally known as the &quot;Ram Inn&quot; but was renamed in 1894 in honour of the Sherwood Ranger Yeomanry Regiment who were based in Retford

In White&#x27;s 1831 directory, several of the public houses are recorded as having female proprietors, including Ann Green of the Black Head (Chapelgate), Ann Sheppard of the George Inn (Moorgate), Mary Barlow of the Granby (Carolgate), Sarah Walker of the Sun (Spittal Hill) and Ann Clarke of the Turk&#x27;s Head (Grove Street).

In 2020 the landlord of the historic Black Boy Inn in Retford removed the pub&#x27;s signage after it was highlighted on a crowdsourced map entitled &#x27;topple the racists - statues and monuments that celebrate slavery and racism&#x27; during the Black Lives Matter protests. The name of the pub is said to refer to its royalist history. Charles II was called &#x27;the black boy&#x27; by his mother Henrietta Maria due to his swarthy complexion and dark hair. During the interregnum, some public houses across England changed their name to The Black Boy in a show of concealed (and deniable) allegiance and because they were meeting places for royalist supporters.

===Sundown Adventureland===
Sundown Adventureland is a 30-acre children&#x27;s theme park for the under 10s situated in the Retford Rural District at Rampton. It was originally opened as a farmyard in 1968 (as&#x27;Pets Corner&#x27;) and is privately owned by the Rhodes family. The park currently attracts over 270,000 visitors a year, employs 120 staff at peak season, and in 2019 TripAdvisor voted it the 23rd best theme park in Europe. In February 2020 it was announced that the park had been granted planning permission to add 90 holiday lodges.

===Youth groups===
Retford is served by many youth groups including The Scout Association, Girlguiding UK, St. John Ambulance and Young Farmers, meeting within the town.

The money raised is donated to charity.

===Retford Heritage Day===
Since 2007 Retford has held an annual Heritage Day organised by the Civic Society. It is part of the National Heritage Days weekend with Retford celebrating its heritage with a host of activities and entertainment. Each year has a different theme, with 2014 being &#x27;The End of an Era&#x27;, 2015 being &#x27;Entertainment&#x27;, 2016 being &#x27;Rebels and Pilgrims&#x27;, and 2017 was &#x27;Dukes and Outlaws&#x27;. In 2019, the Heritage Day is planned to take place at the same time as the first North Notts Literary Festival and the start of the Chesterfield Canal Walking Festival, with the theme being the Chesterfield Canal and Retford&#x27;s working history.

Located at the south eastern edge of the town, Retford Golf Club is a private members club founded in 1921. The original six hole course was designed by Tom Williamson and laid out on 38 acres of land leased from Colonel Sir Albert Whitaker of Babworth Hall around the area known locally as Whisker Hills. Two further new holes were opened in 1958 by Sir Stuart Goodwin. In 1990 nine more holes were added. The current course provides a varied mixture of open parkland, oak-lined fairways and changes of level. It is a popular destination for golf societies from across the East Midlands and South Yorkshire areas.

===Racing===
The East Retford Cavalry Races were held between 1849 and 1864. On 1 April 1868, the United Hunt Committee organised a race meeting at which the Sandbeck Farmers Stakes was won by a horse named Gobbo and the Retford United Hunt Steeplechase was won by Gladiateur.

On 9 April 1877, after a gap of 10 years, meetings began being held on land owned by the 7th Viscount Galway to the north of the town (off Bigsby Road). The second meeting took place on 1 April 1878 with five races being held: the Nottinghamshire Steeplechase, The Grove Farmers Stakes, Maiden Steeplechase, Innkeepers Selling Steeplechase Plate and the Retford Steeplechase. The third meeting did not take place until 1894 due to lack of interest. Various promotions were attempted to boost attendance including train excursions and in 1898 a Tenant Farmers lunch in the Town Hall followed by a free pass to the races. The Retford Hunt Committee oversaw the meetings until 1913, with racing being suspended during WW1 until being resumed in 1921. The final meeting took place in 1928. The land was then sold off to pay the debts of the 8th Viscount Galway. The Retford Handicap was transferred to the course at Southwell Racecourse and ran until the early 2000s.

===Eaton Hall===
Between 1939 and 1941, Mrs KL Kayser agreed to allow the upper floors of Eaton Hall to be used as a maternity hospital for soldiers&#x27; wives who had been bombed-out of their homes.

===Retford Hospital===
Retford and District Hospital was built in 1922 with the foundation stone laid by the Mayor of Retford, Alderman SH Clay. At that time it comprised two wards, a private patients’ wing, an operating theatre, casualty service, and X-ray. It was extended in the late 1960s and early 1970s with two more wards, which were used for long-stay, elderly patients.

The operating theatre was closed in 1980 and inpatient services were transferred to Bassetlaw Hospital in the late 1980s. The Trust now provides a range of outpatient and community services on the site, which is also the headquarters of Bassetlaw PCT. Services include: an outpatient department, physiotherapy, speech therapy, chiropody, audiology, child health, community occupational health, community nursing/ equipment loans, continence service, dental, Genito-Urinary medicine, intermediate care and medical imaging.

To the rear of the hospital is Bassetlaw Hospice which was built in 1994.

===First World War ===
Retford during the First World War had two Red Cross Hospitals for wounded servicemen. One was based at Babworth Hall, and the Sherwood Rangers Headquarters hospital was at 12 Lime Tree Avenue, Retford.

== Media ==
The majority of the town receives its terrestrial television from the Emley Moor transmitting station, which broadcasts local news from &quot;BBC Look North&quot; and &quot;Calendar News&quot;. A minority of residents receive programming from Belmont serving Lincolnshire and East Yorkshire (to the east) and Waltham serving the East Midlands (to the south).

Retford&#x27;s officially designated BBC Local Radio station in terms of radio coverage is BBC Radio Sheffield. However, editorially, local news coverage is covered on BBC Radio Nottingham&#x27;s radio and Internet outlets, despite Retford being outside the official coverage area of both BBC Radio Nottingham&#x27;s FM and DAB signals. Hits Radio South Yorkshire&#x27;s and Greatest Hits South Yorkshire&#x27;s AM signals also cover the town of Retford. National analogue FM radio services from the BBC and Classic FM are broadcast from the Holme Moss transmitting station in West Yorkshire. Digital Radio services come primarily from the Clarborough transmitter outside of Retford for the Sheffield and Digital One multiplexes, Clifton transmitter near Doncaster for the BBC National DAB multiplex and the Belmont, High Hunsley (near Hull) and Tapton Hill (Sheffield), Waltham and Emley Moor transmitters for the Sound Digital multiplex.

Trax FM formerly editorially covered the town of Retford, although its Ofcom designated FM coverage area only covered the Doncaster area, Worksop and rural areas west of Retford, Retford was covered on DAB via the Sheffield multiplex. It has since been replaced with a relay of Greatest Hits Radio Yorkshire on its former FM frequencies. TX1 Radio took over as a replacement local commercial service from 2020 for the same editorial area as Trax FM covered via the Internet and for a short time on DAB via the Lincolnshire multiplex which has overspill coverage into the Doncaster and Bassetlaw area.

Retford also has one newspaper serving the town, the &quot;Retford Times&quot; which is published on Thursdays. It was founded in 1869 by Alexander Watson Lyall as the &#x27;Retford and Gainsborough Times and Worksop Weekly News&#x27;. In 1880 it changed its name to the &#x27;Retford and Gainsborough Times and Worksop &amp; Newark Weekly News&#x27; and from 1901 it was the &#x27;Retford, Gainsborough &amp; Worksop Times and Newark &amp; Mansfield Weekly News&#x27;. In 1967 it became the &#x27;Retford, Gansborough &amp; Worksop Times&#x27; before dropping &#x27;Worksop&#x27; from its masthead in 2011. In 2013 it became simply &#x27;The Retford Times&#x27;. It is now published by Lincolnshire Media, although the editorial offices are in Retford.

The &quot;Worksop Guardian&quot;, although predominately a newspaper serving Worksop and its area, also covers stories in Retford. The publishers of the &quot;Worksop Guardian&quot; formerly published a free weekly newspaper for Retford and Bawtry, the &quot;Guardian and Trader&quot; newspaper.

==Retford cemetery==
Retford cemetery is a Victorian era cemetery, with the site&#x27;s first burial dating back to 1854 (when it was built). Prior to the cemetery, maps dating back to 1835 confirm that the area was covered by farmland. It is approximately in size, situated between Babworth Road and North Road. It is bounded by the Chesterfield canal (which separates the two halves of the cemetery) and has two entrances – one on North Road (the original entrance) and one on Babworth Road next to St Joseph&#x27;s church. It is maintained by Bassetlaw District Council (BDC), which has freehold ownership of the site.

The cemetery was opened in several parts. The oldest part of the cemetery dates to 1854 and was opened at a cost of £1,800. It had two mortuary chapels designed by Arthur Wilson (one Church of England and one Nonconformist) that were linked by a porch. These were demolished in the 1970s. It also had a cemetery lodge designed by James Fowler which still exists as a private home. In the 1854 cemetery is a separate Catholic cemetery. In the 1890s the town cemetery was extended to land on the other side of the canal, with the two halves linked by a bridge. In the 1950s a donation of land was made by the Catholic church to extend the 1890 cemetery. This land had been donated in 1922 by Major Milner for the burial of Catholics. Part of the land was used for a Catholic church, school and hall. The remainder was donated to extend the general cemetery, with provision for a (new) separate Catholic cemetery.

Retford cemetery contains 14 Commonwealth war graves from the First World War, and 16 from the Second World War. There is also one Polish soldier buried there.

As part of a major overhaul of secondary schools in the Bassetlaw area, all schools have now been moved to new facilities built around the town as part of the Transform Schools scheme. Retford is home to a Post-16 centre the aim of which was to unite all Sixth Form students in one site (formerly Ordsall Hall School) and provide other courses available through North Nottinghamshire College (based at Worksop). Since the spring of 2018, A Level students have returned to their respective secondary schools and now use the dedicated Post-16 centre for vocational and technical courses, as well as higher education.

===Historic schools===

King Edward VI Grammar School (Motto - Ex Pulvere Palma) opened in August 1857 and was designed by the noted Victorian architect Decimus Burton. The school traced its foundations to Thomas Gunthorpe of Babworth in 1519, although there are references to a still earlier school in the town. It was refounded around 1551 during the reign of King Edward VI. The school accepted boarders from at least the 17th century onwards, with the last boarders leaving in 1938. Retford during the Second World War took in over 6,000 evacuee children, including a number of boys from Great Yarmouth Grammar School who were evacuated to Retford (from 1940 to 1944) and taught in classrooms at King Edward VI Grammar School. The school eventually became part of the Retford Oaks Academy and moved to new premises on the edge of town, although the original Grade II listed buildings still exist on London Road.

The school donated the sledge pulled by the pony Michael in Robert Falcon Scott&#x27;s expedition to the South Pole. Scott had appealed to the school boys of Great Britain to provide funds for the expedition, and the boys of Retford Grammar School contributed three guineas, with the Head Master adding 12s 6d to round it up to the cost of providing one sledge. Scott acknowledged the donation and wrote a postscript to the acknowledgement by hand to say: &quot;Will you please give my hearty thanks to the boys for their generous subscription and good wishes. A sledge will be called ‘Retford.’—R.S.&quot;
Retford County High School for Girls has its origins in a meeting convened at the White Hart Hotel, Retford &#x27;to consider the advisability of taking steps to establish a public High School for Girls in the district&#x27;. The prime instigator in the new project was the manager of the Westminster Bank, Mr. William Oakden, who in 1891 had moved from Nottingham to Retford. He and other like-minded people wanted to provide their daughters with some form of higher education. The school eventually found a site on the corner of Pelham Road and Queen Street, adjacent to the canal. The school educated around 400 girls in the 1950s to 1970s. In 1979 the secondary schools in Retford were reorganised and the 11+ abolished. Boys were to be admitted for the first time. The result was a comprehensive school called &#x27;The Elizabethan High School&#x27; under head teacher Mrs Coxon-Butler. At this time the former Hallcroft Girls&#x27; secondary modern school on Hallcroft Road became the new school&#x27;s Lower Site and the Retford Girls&#x27; High School became the school&#x27;s Upper Site. The former Pelham Road/Queen Street site was demolished when the school moved to new buildings in Hallcroft and was renamed The Elizabethan Academy. The Pelham Road site is now a housing estate.

<text>The National Day of Mourning is an annual demonstration, held on the fourth Thursday in November, that aims to educate the public about Native Americans in the United States, notably the Wampanoag and other tribes of the Eastern United States; dispel myths surrounding the Thanksgiving story in the United States; and raise awareness toward historical and ongoing struggles facing Native American tribes. The first National Day of Mourning demonstration was held in 1970 after Frank &quot;Wamsutta&quot; James&#x27;s speaking invitation was rescinded from a Massachusetts Thanksgiving Day celebration commemorating the 350th anniversary of the landing of the &quot;Mayflower&quot;. James instead delivered his speech on Cole&#x27;s Hill in Plymouth, Massachusetts next to a statue of Ousamequin, where he described Native American perspectives on the Thanksgiving celebrations. The gathering became an annual event organized by the United American Indians of New England (UAINE) and coincides with both Thanksgiving Day in the United States and with Unthanksgiving Day, an annual ceremony held on Alcatraz Island in California.

==History==
===Frank &quot;Wamsutta&quot; James&#x27; speech cancelled===
In the fall of 1970, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts held a commemorative Thanksgiving celebration on the 350th anniversary of the first landing of the &quot;Mayflower&quot;. The event&#x27;s organizers, including Governor Francis Sargent, invited Frank &quot;Wamsutta&quot; James to speak at the event. James was the leader of the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head and president of the Federated Eastern Indian League.

The event&#x27;s organizers requested to review James&#x27; speech in advance of the event. Once it had been reviewed, James was informed that he would not be permitted to give the speech as written. Of particular dispute was James&#x27;s depiction of the winter of 1620-21, in which Pilgrims scavenged corn and beans found in burial grounds in a desperate bid to fend off starvation; James had planned to use his speech to accuse the Pilgrims of grave robbing and theft. An alternate speech, written by the event&#x27;s public relations team, was provided to him. A representative from the Department of Commerce and Development explained to James that
 According to a recollection from Tall Oak, who continues to participate in modern National Days of Mourning, the event organizers anticipated that James&#x27;s accusations would have been rejected by most of those in attendance, had he been allowed to issue them: &quot;we can’t allow you to read that (be)cause 90% of the people would walk out.&quot;

===Initial event===
Wamsutta Frank James, Tall Oak Weeden, Gary Parker, Shirley Mills, Rayleen Bey, and several other people organized speakers, recruited attendees on a national scale, and arranged accommodations for out-of-town guests.

The first National Day of Mourning event was held on Thanksgiving Day, November 26, 1970, on Cole&#x27;s Hill in Plymouth, Massachusetts. James delivered an amended speech beside a statue of Ousamequin, including
The event was attended by close to 500 Native Americans from throughout the United States and has been held annually on the fourth Thursday in November every year since. James&#x27; speech was one of the first public criticisms of the Thanksgiving story from Native American groups.

==Later protests==
The United American Indians of New England (UAINE), founded by James in 1970, continues to organize the annual National Day of Mourning rally at Cole&#x27;s Hill. The event&#x27;s objectives include
* Education around the history of the Wampanoag people
* Dispelling of the mythology commonly taught as part of the Thanksgiving story
* Awareness of historical and ongoing struggles of Native American tribes

===Controversy 1995–97===
At the 1995 event, protestors dumped sand and seaweed on Plymouth Rock as part of the demonstration. In 1997, police attacked peaceful National Day of Mourning marchers, which included the use of pepper spray. Twenty-five marchers were arrested and charged with misdemeanor as well as felony crimes. Plymouth agreed to drop the charges in a 1998 settlement with UAINE.

===Modern commemoration===

The National Day of Mourning protest is held annually at Cole&#x27;s Hill and is attended by several hundred participants. Estimates of attendance in 2021 range from 1,000 – 2,000. Frank James&#x27; son Roland Moonanum James continued to be involved in the event until his death in December 2020, and Frank&#x27;s granddaughter Kisha James helps organize it in her role as UAINE youth coordinator. Mahtowin Munro has been co-leader since the 1990s.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the rally was held both in-person and virtually, and over 1600 people tuned in to the livestream and more than 20,000 to the online video.

<text>Frederick William Vanderbilt (February 2, 1856 – June 29, 1938) was a member of the American Vanderbilt family. He was a director of the New York Central Railroad for 61 years, and also a director of the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad and of the Chicago and North Western Railroad.

==Early life==
Vanderbilt was born on February 2, 1856, in New Dorp, Staten Island. He was the third son of eight children born to William Henry Vanderbilt (1821–1885) and Maria Louisa (née Kissam) Vanderbilt (1821–1896). His siblings were Cornelius Vanderbilt II, who married Alice Claypoole Gwynne; Margaret Louisa Vanderbilt, who married Elliott Fitch Shepard; William Kissam Vanderbilt, who married Alva Erskine Smith and Anne Harriman Sands Rutherfurd; Emily Thorn Vanderbilt, who married William Douglas Sloane and Henry White; Florence Adele Vanderbilt, who married Hamilton McKown Twombly; Eliza Osgood Vanderbilt, who married William Seward Webb; and George Washington Vanderbilt II, who married Edith Stuyvesant Dresser.

He was the grandson of Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt, who first created the Vanderbilt family&#x27;s wealth. Upon his grandfather&#x27;s death in 1877, 95% of the $100 million estate was left to his father and his three brothers ($5 million to Cornelius, and $2 million apiece to William, Frederick, and George).

In 1876, Vanderbilt graduated from Yale University&#x27;s Sheffield Scientific School to which he later donated $500,000 (equivalent to $ today) in 1902. While at Yale, he joined St. Anthony Hall and paid for a new chapter house and domatory.

==Career==
After graduating from Yale, he joined his father at the New York Central Railroad, like his brothers, working in one department after another to gain an understanding of the railroad business. After working for many years at the railroad, he devoted his time to travel and yachting.

Vanderbilt was a director of 22 railroads, including New York Central Railroad, the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad, and the Chicago and North Western Railroad.

==Yachts==

Vanderbilt was a member of the New York Yacht Club. In the course of his life he owned four steam yachts: &quot;Vedette&quot;, &quot;Conqueror&quot;, , and &quot;Virginia&quot;, which he renamed &quot;Vedette&quot; after his first yacht. In January 1914 &quot;Warrior&quot;, his largest yacht, ran aground on the Colombian coast while on a Caribbean cruise. Mr and Mrs Vanderbilt were rescued, along with their guests: the Duke and Duchess of Manchester and Lord Falconer; and their servants. There was no loss of life, and &quot;Warrior&quot; was eventually salvaged.

==Legacy==
Vanderbilt maintained residences in New York City (he lived for a while at 450 Fifth Avenue), Newport (&quot;Rough Point&quot;), Bar Harbor (&quot;Sonogee&quot;), Upper St. Regis Lake in the Adirondacks (&quot;Pine Tree Point&quot;), and a country palace in Hyde Park, New York (&quot;Hyde Park&quot;) now preserved by the National Park Service as Vanderbilt Mansion National Historic Site. He built the nearby Howard Mansion and Carriage House for his nephew Thomas H. Howard in 1896.

Vanderbilt was the owner of 10 East 40th Street in Manhattan, a prominent example of art deco architecture, until his death. He commissioned a number of campus buildings at Yale University by architect Charles C. Haight that survive to this day, from campus dormitories comprising the present-day Silliman College, to Vanderbilt Hall, Phelps Hall, the Mason, Sloane and Osborn laboratories, and his secret society, St. Anthony Hall.

==Personal life==
In 1878, Frederick married Louise Holmes Torrance (née Anthony) (1854–1926), the daughter of Charles Lee Anthony and Catherine (née Holmes) Anthony. Louise&#x27;s father was a successful dry-goods merchant in New York City. Louise had been previously married, in 1868, to Frederick&#x27;s cousin Alfred Torrance, before their divorce in 1877.

Frederick Vanderbilt died in Hyde Park, New York, on June 29, 1938. He was buried at Vanderbilt Family Cemetery and Mausoleum in New Dorp. His estate was valued at $79,845,478 (equivalent to $ today) upon his death. He left $5,200,000 to the Sheffield Scientific School, $3,900,000 to Vanderbilt University, $1,300,000 to the Salvation Army, and $650,000 to the New York Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor. After his charitable donations, his niece, Mrs. Margaret Louise Van Alen (1876–1969), was the chief heir of his estate, receiving his 5th Avenue home, Hyde Park home, and 25% of the residue of the estate.

<text>Batroun ( &#x27;;, ancientBotrys (), is a coastal city in northern Lebanon and one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. It is the capital city of Batroun District.

== Etymology ==

&quot;Batroun&quot; appears in Western Aramaic, and is attested in as &quot;bṯrwn&quot; () in premodern Arabic texts, with the expected lenition of t for an Aramaic term. Elie Mardini suggests the shift of the th to t in Aramaic terms in the Levant is due to the merger of certain fricatives in Levantine Arabic.

== History ==
Batroun is likely the &quot;Batruna&quot; mentioned in the Amarna letters (EA 078, EA 079, EA 081, EA 087, EA 088, EA 090, EA 093, EA 095, EA 124, EA 129), dating to the 14th century B.C. Batroun was mentioned by the ancient geographers Strabo, Pliny, Ptolemy, Stephanus of Byzantium, and Hierocles. Theophanes the Confessor called the city &quot;Bostrys.&quot;

The Phoenicians founded Batroun on the southern side of the promontory called in classical antiquity Theoprosopon and during the Byzantine Empire, Cape Lithoprosopon. Batroun is said to have been founded by Ithobaal I (Ethbaal), king of Tyre (whose daughter Jezabel married Ahab).

The city was under Roman rule to Phoenice Province, and later after the region was Christianized became a suffragan of the Patriarch of Antioch.

In 551, Batroun was destroyed by an earthquake, which also caused mudslides and made the Cape Lithoprosopon crack. Historians believe that Batroun&#x27;s large natural harbor was formed during the earthquake.

Three Greek Orthodox bishops are known to have come from Batroun: Porphyrius in 451, Elias about 512 and Stephen in 553 (Lequien, II, 827). According to a Greek &quot;Notitia episcopatuum&quot;, the Greek Orthodox See has existed in Batroun since the tenth century when the city was then called &quot;Petrounion&quot;. After the Muslim conquests of the region, the name was Arabicized to Batroun.

Batroun was controlled by the Crusaders in 1104, to be known as the Lordship of Botrun as part of the County of Tripoli, until it was conquered by the Mamluk Sultanate in 1289. One of Batroun&#x27;s archaeological sites is Mseilha Fort, which is constructed on an isolated massive rock with steep sides protruding in the middle of a plain surrounded by mountains.

Under Ottoman rule, Batroun was the centre of a kaza in the mutessariflik of Lebanon and the seat of a Maronite diocese, suffragan to the Maronite Catholic Patriarchate of Antioch. Since 1999, it has been the seat of the Maronite eparchy.

== Economy and urban development ==
Historically, the city of Batroun was settled at the interface between the sea and the national road that connected Beirut to Tripoli.

Lately, the radical shift of the historical functions of the local economic tissue into a leisure service-based economy (nightclubs, bars, restaurants, stores, etc.) has become the unique and only lever of the development of the city. The economic metamorphosis has resulted in the resettlement of housing towards emerging city suburbs (nearby hills: New Batroun, Batroun Hills, Basbina, etc.) consequently to the overvaluation of the real estate market in the city centre. It clearly reveals here the constitution of a business city-centre (dedicated to leisure and business) balanced by the constitution of residential suburbs, where accelerated urban sprawl has led to the destruction of natural lands (pinewood and orange groves) and to the fatal rise in land prices.

== Tourism ==
Batroun is a major tourist destination in North Lebanon. The town boasts historic Maronite and Greek Orthodox churches. The town is also a major beach resort with a vibrant nightlife that includes pubs and nightclubs. Citrus groves surround Batroun, and the town has been famous (from the early 20th century) for its fresh lemonade sold at the cafés and restaurants on its main street. Biking along the Batroun coastline is also a major activity mainly in late summer days.
In 2009, the Batroun International Festival was born. It began hosting leading local and international artists. The festival takes place usually in July and/or August of each year in the old harbor area.

==Demographics==
In 2014, Christians made up 89.69% and Muslims made up 9.80% of registered voters in Batroun. 64.16% of the voters were Maronite Catholics, 16.44% were Greek Orthodox and 7.97% were Sunni Muslims.

The people of Batroun are mainly Maronite, Melkite, and Greek Orthodox Christians. Batroun is a Roman Catholic (Latin rite) Titular See.

== Politics ==
Recent years have seen municipal and parliamentary elections become a growing factor and interest in Batroun. This is mainly in the context of local and national struggle for power. The current serving Mayor of Batroun is Marcelino El Harek.

<text>Maron, also called Maroun or Maro (, &#x27;; ,&#x27;; ; ), was a 4th-century Syriac Christian hermit monk in the Taurus Mountains whose followers, after his death, founded a religious Christian movement that became known as the Maronite Church, in full communion with the Holy See and the Catholic Church. The religious community which grew from this movement are the modern Maronites.

Maron, revered as a highly spiritual ascetic monk with a connection to God through his communion with the natural environment, garnered widespread respect within Christian circles. In addition to his emphasis on ascetic spirituality, he played an important role in advancing Christian missions in the region. One of his disciples, Abraham of Cyrrhus, emerged as a missionary, successfully disseminating the Maronite variant of Christianity in Lebanon, which took root in the region and persisted ever since.

Saint Maron is often portrayed in a black monastic habit with a hanging stole, accompanied by a long crosier staffed by a globe surmounted with a cross. His feast day in the Maronite Church is February 9.

==Life==
Maron, born in what is now modern Syria, in the middle of the 4th century, was a priest who later became a hermit, retiring to the Taurus Mountains in the region of Cyrrhus, near Antioch. His holiness and miracles attracted many followers, and drew attention throughout the empire. John Chrysostom wrote to him around AD 405 expressing his great love and respect, and asking Maron to pray for him. Maron and Chrysostom are believed to have studied together in the great Christian learning center at Antioch, which at the time was the third largest city in the Roman Empire.

Maron embraced a life of quiet solitude in the mountains north-west of Aleppo. He was known for his simplicity and his extraordinary desire to discover God&#x27;s presence in all things.

Maron is considered the Father of the spiritual and monastic movement now called the Maronite Church.

==Monastic spirituality==
Maron&#x27;s way was deeply monastic with emphasis on the spiritual and ascetic aspects of living. For Maron, all was connected to God and God was connected to all. He did not separate the physical and spiritual world and actually used the physical world to deepen his faith and spiritual experience with God. He was able to free himself from the physical world by his passion and fervour for prayer and enter into a mystical relationship of love with God.

He lived his life in the open air next to a temple he had transformed to a church. He spent his time in prayer and meditation exposed to the forces of nature such as sun, rain, hail and snow. Theodoret of Cyrrhus wrote that this was a new type of asceticism that soon enjoyed wide acceptance in Syria and Lebanon. His &quot;Religious History&quot;, written around AD 440, mentions fifteen men and three women who followed this practice, many of them trained or guided by Maron.

==Missionary==

Saint Maron was a mystic who initiated a new ascetic-spiritual approach that attracted many people in the region encompassing what is now Syria and Lebanon to become his disciples. Accompanying his deeply spiritual and ascetic life, he was a zealous missionary with a passion for spreading the message of Christ by preaching it to all he encountered. He sought not only to heal physical ailments but also had a profound commitment to nurturing and healing the “lost souls” of both non-Christians and Christians of his time.

This missionary work came to fruition when, in the mountains of the region, Saint Maron was able to convert a temple into a Christian church in Kafr Nabu. This marked the beginning of the conversion to Christianity in the region, which would eventually influence and spread to the ancient region of Mount Lebanon. After his death in the year 410 in Kalota, his spirit and teachings continued to thrive through his disciples.

The exact location of his burial is a topic of debate. Some Lebanese sources, such as Giuseppe Simone Assemani and Maronite bishop Yusef al-Dibs, believed he was buried in Arethusa or modern-day al-Rastan along the Orontes River in the region, while others, like Jesuit priest Henri Lammens, have claimed he is buried in Brad village to the north of Aleppo.

The Maronite movement reached Mount Lebanon when Saint Maron’s first disciple, Abraham of Cyrrhus, who was called the Apostle of Lebanon, realized that there were many non-Christians in the ancient region of Mount Lebanon, and he set out to convert them to Christianity by introducing them to the teachings of Saint Maron. William of Tyre, chronicling his arrival in the region of Lebanon during the crusades, writes of the Maronites that they took their name from a certain Maro, whose heresies (described as monothelitism) they followed for “almost five hundred years,” but which they recanted at the time of William’s report. Though William of Tyre’s indictment of “Maro and his followers” as monothelite heretics has resulted in controversy among scholars, in all probability, he was mistakenly referring to a Maro from Edessa instead of the fourth-century St. Maro. Maronite historians argue that they have always remained in full communion with Rome. Saint Maron’s feast day is celebrated on February 9.

==Veneration==
Saint Maron was known for his gift for healing.

==Notable recognitions==
On 23 February 2011, Pope Benedict XVI unveiled a statue of Saint Maron on the outer wall of Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica in the Vatican and imparted his Apostolic Blessing. The 15 feet tall statue was commissioned by the Maronite Church to the Spanish sculptor Marco Augusto Dueñas. The saint appears in the sculpture holding a miniature, Maronite style church; the sculpture also features an inscription in Syriac reading: &quot;The righteous will flourish like a palm tree, they will grow like a cedar of Lebanon&quot;. The statue occupied the last available niche in the outer perimeter of Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica.

In June 2012, an impressionist painting of Saint Maron, as well as several icons based on images from the 5th-century Syriac &quot;Rabboula&quot; manuscript including the Crucifixion, the Marian icon of the &quot;Mother of Light&quot; and the Evangelists, was donated, installed and was solemnly attended by Cardinal Donald Wuerl at the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington D.C., and was formally dedicated on September 23, 2012.

<text>Magnetic ink character recognition code, known in short as MICR code, is a character recognition technology used mainly by the banking industry to streamline the processing and clearance of cheques and other documents. MICR encoding, called the &quot;MICR line&quot;, is at the bottom of cheques and other vouchers and typically includes the document-type indicator, bank code, bank account number, cheque number, cheque amount (usually added after a cheque is presented for payment), and a control indicator. The format for the bank code and bank account number is country-specific.

The technology allows MICR readers to scan and read the information directly into a data-collection device. Unlike barcode and similar technologies, MICR characters can be read easily by humans. MICR encoded documents can be processed much faster and more accurately than conventional OCR encoded documents.

== Pre-Unicode standard representation ==
The ISO standard ISO 2033:1983, and the corresponding Japanese Industrial Standard JIS X 9010:1984 (originally JIS C 6229–1984), define character encodings for OCR-A, OCR-B and E-13B.

==International spread==
There are two major MICR fonts in use: E-13B and CMC-7. There is no particular international agreement on which countries use which font. In practice, this does not create particular problems as cheques and other vouchers do not usually flow out of a particular jurisdiction.

The E-13B font has been adopted as an international standard in ISO 1004-1:2013, and is the standard in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States, as well as Central America and much of Asia, besides other countries.

The CMC-7 font has been adopted as an international standard in ISO 1004-2:2013, and is widely used in Europe, including France and Italy, Mexico, and South America, including Argentina, Brazil, Chile, besides other countries.

Israel is the only country that can use both fonts simultaneously, though the practice makes the system significantly less efficient. This situation is the product of the Israelis adopting CMC-7, while the Palestinians opted for E-13B.

==Fonts==
===E-13B===

E-13B is a 14-character set, comprising the 10 decimal digits, and the following symbols:

* ⑆ (transit: used to delimit a bank code);
* ⑈ (on-us: used to delimit a customer account number);
* ⑇ (amount: used to delimit a transaction amount);
* ⑉ (dash: used to delimit parts of numbers—e.g., routing numbers or account numbers).

In the check printing and banking industries the E-13B MICR line is also commonly referred to as the TOAD line. This reference comes from the 4 characters: Transit, Onus, Amount, and Dash. Compared to CMC-7, some pairs of E-13B characters (notably 2 and 5) can produce relatively similar results when magnetically scanned; however, as a fallback if magnetic reading fails, E-13B also performs well under optical character recognition.

The E-13B repertoire can be represented in Unicode (see below). Prior to Unicode, it could be encoded according to ISO 2033:1983, which encodes digits in their usual ASCII locations, &quot;transit&quot; as 0x3A, &quot;on us&quot; as 0x3C, &quot;amount&quot; as 0x3B, and &quot;dash&quot; as 0x3D. For EBCDIC, IBM code page 1001 encodes digits in their usual EBCDIC locations, &quot;transit&quot; as 0xDB, &quot;on us&quot; as 0xEB, &quot;amount&quot; as 0xCB, and &quot;dash&quot; as 0xFB.

IBM code page 1032 extends code page 1001 by adding alternative encodings for &quot;transit&quot; at 0x5C, 0x7A and 0xC1, &quot;on us&quot; at 0x4C, 0x61 and 0xC3, &quot;amount&quot; at 0x5B, 0x5E and 0xC2 and &quot;dash&quot; at 0x60, 0x7E and 0xC4, in addition to a zero-width space at 0x5A. These alternative representations were added for interoperability with Siemens and Océ printers.

===CMC-7===

CMC-7 includes 10 numeric digits, 26 capital letters, and 5 control characters: S I S II S III S IV (an unused character), and S V 

CMC-7 has a barcode format, with every character having two distinct large gaps in different places, as well as distinct patterns in between, to minimize any chance for character confusion while reading magnetically; however, these bars are too close and narrow to be reliably recognised at a typical scan resolution if falling back to optical scanning. CMC-7 can also produce superficially successful, but incorrect, scans of upside-down MICR lines.

Unicode does not include support for the CMC-7 control symbols. IBM code page 1033 encodes:

*Digits and capitals in their usual EBCDIC locations
*S I (&quot;internal&quot;) as 0x5E, 0x61 or 0xCB;
*S II (&quot;terminator&quot;) as 0x4C, 0x5B or 0xEB;
*S III (&quot;amount&quot;) as 0x60, 0x7E or 0xFB;
*S IV as 0x50, 0x7A or 0xDB;
*S V (&quot;routing&quot;) as 0x5C, 0x6E or 0xBB.

==MICR reader==
MICR characters are printed on documents in one of the two MICR fonts, using magnetizable (commonly known as magnetic) ink or toner, usually containing iron oxide. In scanning, the document is passed through a MICR reader, which performs two functions: magnetization of the ink, and detection of the characters. The characters are read by a MICR reader head, a device similar to the playback head of a tape recorder. As each character passes over the head, it produces a unique waveform that can be easily identified by the system.

MICR readers are the primary tool for cheque sorting and are used across the cheque distribution network at multiple stages. For example, a merchant will use a MICR reader to sort cheques by bank and send the sorted cheques to a clearing house for redistribution to those banks. Upon receipt, the banks perform another MICR sort to determine which customer&#x27;s account is charged and to which branch the cheque should be sent on its way back to the customer. However, many banks no longer offer this last step of returning the cheque to the customer. Instead, cheques are scanned and stored digitally. Sorting of cheques is done as per the geographical coverage of banks in a nation.

==Unicode==
OCR and MICR characters have been included in the Unicode Standard since at least version 1.1 (June 1993). Since the Unicode Character Database only tracks characters starting with version 1.1, they may also have been present in Unicode 1.0 or 1.0.1.

The Unicode block that includes OCR and MICR characters is called Optical Character Recognition and covers U+2440–U+245F. Of the characters in this block, four are from the MICR E-13B font:
* 
* (corrected alias )
* (corrected alias )

The names of the latter two characters were inadvertently switched when they were named in ISO/IEC 10646:1993, and they have been assigned accurate names as formal aliases. Per the Unicode Stability Policy, the existing names remain, allowing their use as stable identifiers. Additionally, all four characters have informative (non-formal) aliases in the Unicode charts: &quot;transit&quot;, &quot;amount&quot;, &quot;on us&quot;, and &quot;dash&quot; respectively.

Prior to Unicode, these symbols had been encoded by the ISO-IR-98 encoding defined by ISO 2033:1983, in which they were simply named through . They were encoded immediately following the digits, which were encoded at their ASCII locations. Although ISO 2033 also specifies encoding for OCR-A and OCR-B, its encoding for E-13B is known simply as by the IANA.
==History==

Before the mid-1940s, cheques were processed manually using the Sort-A-Matic or Top Tab Key method. The processing and cheque clearing was very time-consuming and was a significant cost in cheque clearance and bank operations. As the number of cheques increased, ways were sought for automating the process. Standards were developed to ensure uniformity in financial institutions. By the mid-1950s, the Stanford Research Institute and General Electric Computer Laboratory had developed the first automated system to process cheques using MICR. The same team also developed the E-13B MICR font. &quot;E&quot; refers to the font being the fifth considered, and &quot;B&quot; to the fact that it was the second version. The &quot;13&quot; refers to the 0.013-inch character grid.
The trial of MICR E-13B font was shown to the American Bankers Association (ABA) in July 1956, which adopted it in 1958 as the MICR standard for negotiable documents in the United States. ABA adopted MICR as its standard because machines could read MICR accurately, and MICR could be printed using existing technology. In addition, MICR remained machine readable, even through overstamping, marking, mutilation and more. The first cheques using MICR were printed by the end of 1959. Although compliance with MICR standards was voluntary in the United States, it had been almost universally adopted in the United States by 1963. In 1963, ANSI adopted the ABA&#x27;s E-13B font as the American standard for MICR printing, and E-13B was also standardized as ISO 1004:1995.

Other countries set their own standards, though the MICR readers and most other equipment were US manufactured. MICR technology has been adopted in many countries, with some variations. The E-13B font was adopted as the standard in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, and many other countries. In Australia, the system is managed by the Australian Payments Network.
The CMC-7 font was developed in France by Groupe Bull in 1957. It was adopted as the MICR standard in Argentina, France, Italy, and some other European countries.

In the 1960s, the MICR fonts became a symbol of modernity or futurism, leading to the creation of lookalike &quot;computer&quot; typefaces that imitated the appearance of the MICR fonts, which unlike real MICR fonts, had a full character set.

MICR E-13B is also used to encode information in other applications, such as sales promotions, coupons, credit cards, airline tickets, insurance premium receipts, deposit tickets, and more. E-13b is the version specifically developed for offset litho printing. There was a subtly different called E-13a. Also, there was a rival system named &#x27;Fred&#x27; (Figure Reading Electronic Device) which used figures that looked more conventional.

<doc id="381102" wikidata="Q672994" url="?curid=381102" title="Avro Manchester">
<text>The Avro 679 Manchester was a British twin-engine heavy bomber developed and manufactured by the Avro aircraft company in the United Kingdom. While not being built in great numbers, it was the forerunner of the more famed and more successful four-engined Avro Lancaster, which was one of the most capable strategic bombers of the Second World War.

Avro designed the Manchester in conformance with the requirements laid out by the British Air Ministry Specification P.13/36, which sought a capable medium bomber with which to equip the Royal Air Force (RAF) and to replace its inventory of twin-engine bombers, such as the Armstrong Whitworth Whitley, Handley Page Hampden and Vickers Wellington. Performing its maiden flight on 25 July 1939, the Manchester entered squadron service in November 1940, just over twelve months after the outbreak of the war.

Operated by both RAF and the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), the Manchester came to be regarded as a complete operational failure, primarily as a result of its Rolls-Royce Vulture engines, which were underdeveloped and hence underpowered and unreliable, and production was terminated in 1941. However, the Manchester was redesigned into a four-engined heavy bomber, powered by the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine instead, which became known as the Lancaster.

==Development==
The Manchester has its origins in a design produced by Avro in order to fulfil the British Air Ministry&#x27;s Specification P.13/36. This was the same specification to which Handley Page had also produced their initial design for what would become the Halifax bomber. Issued in May 1936, Specification P.13/36 called for a twin-engine monoplane &quot;medium bomber&quot; for &quot;worldwide use&quot;, which was to be capable of carrying out shallow (30°) dive bombing attacks and carry heavy bombloads (8,000 lb/3,630 kg) or two 18 in (457 mm) torpedoes. Additionally, provisions to conduct catapult assisted takeoffs, which would permit the carriage of the maximum payload, was also a stated requirement, although this provision was removed in July 1938. The envisioned cruising speed of the bomber was to be a minimum of 275 mph at 15,000 feet. The Air Ministry had expectations for an aircraft of similar weight to the B.1/35 specification, but smaller and faster.

Avro had already started work on a corresponding design prior to having received a formal invitation to tender. The company was in competition with Boulton Paul, Bristol, Fairey, Handley Page and Shorts. Vickers also had its Warwick, which had Napier Sabre engines, but eventually chose against tendering it. In early 1937, both the Avro design and the rival Handley Page HP.56 were accepted and prototypes of both ordered; but in mid-1937, the Air Ministry exercised their rights to order the types &quot;off the drawing board&quot;. This skipping of the usual process was necessary due to the initiation of a wider expansion of the RAF in expectation of large scale war in Europe. From 1939, it was expected that the P.13/36 would begin replacing the RAF&#x27;s existing medium bombers, such as the Armstrong Whitworth Whitley, Handley Page Hampden and Vickers Wellington.

The Avro design used the Rolls-Royce Vulture 24-cylinder X-block engine, which was two Rolls-Royce Peregrine Vee cylinder blocks mounted one on top of the other, the bottom one inverted to give the &quot;X&quot; shape. When developed in 1935, the Vulture engine had promise — it was rated at 1,760 hp (1,310 kW) but it proved woefully unreliable and had to be derated to 1,480–1,500 hp (1,100–1,120 kW). Avro&#x27;s prototype Manchester &quot;L7246&quot;, was assembled by their experimental department at Manchester&#x27;s Ringway Airport and first flew from there on 25 July 1939, with the second aircraft following on 26 May 1940. The Vulture engine was chosen by Avro and not stipulated by the Air Ministry as is sometimes claimed; other engine layouts considered included the use of two Bristol Hercules or Bristol Centaurus radial engines. The Handley Page HP.56, always intended as the backup to the Avro, was redesigned to take four engines on the orders of the Air Ministry in 1937, when the Vulture was already showing problems.

While the Manchester was designed with a twin tail, the first production aircraft, designated the Mk I, had a central fin added and twenty aircraft like this were built. They were succeeded by the Mk IA which reverted to the twin-fin system but used enlarged, taller fin and rudders mounted on a new tailplane, with span increased from 22 ft (6.71 m) to 33 ft (10.06 m). This configuration was carried over to the Lancaster, except for the first prototype, which also used a central fin and was a converted, unfinished Manchester. Avro constructed 177 Manchesters while Metropolitan-Vickers completed 32 aircraft. Plans for Armstrong Whitworth and Fairey Aviation at Ringway (now Manchester Airport) to build the Manchester were abandoned. Fairey&#x27;s order for 150 Manchesters was replaced by orders for the Halifax.

==Design==

The Avro Manchester was designed with great consideration for ease of manufacture and repair. The fuselage of the aircraft comprised longitudinal stringers or longerons throughout, over which an external skin of aluminium alloy was flush-riveted for a smooth external surface. The wings were of a two-spar construction, the internal ribs being made of aluminium alloys; fuel was contained with several self-sealing fuel tanks within the wings. The tail shared a similar construction to the wing, featuring a twin fin-and-rudder configuration that provided good vision for the dorsal gunner.

The cockpit housed the pilot and fighting controller&#x27;s position underneath the canopy, and these two crew members were provided with all-round vision. The navigator was seated aft of the fighting controller and the position included an astrodome for use of a sextant. The bomb aimer&#x27;s station was housed inside the aircraft&#x27;s nose, beneath the forward turret and bomb aiming was conducted using optical sights housed in this compartment. For crew comfort on lengthy missions, a rest area was situated just to the rear of the main cabin.

The aircraft&#x27;s undercarriage was entirely retractable via hydraulic systems, or in an emergency, a backup air system. The doors to the bomb bay were also operated by these systems, an additional safety measure was installed to ensure that the bombs could not be dropped if the doors were shut. The bombs were housed on bomb racks inside the internal bomb bay, and other armaments such as torpedoes could also be fitted. All fuel tankage was located in the wings in order to keep the fuselage free to accommodate more armaments in the bomb bay which covered nearly two-thirds of the underside of the fuselage.

Vulnerable parts of the aircraft were armoured; the pilot had additional armour and bulletproof glass and an armoured bulkhead was to the rear of the navigator&#x27;s position. The Manchester featured three hydraulically-operated turrets, located in the nose, rear and mid-upper fuselage; the addition of a ventral turret directly behind the bomb bay had been considered and tested on the second prototype, but did not feature on production aircraft. Access to all crew stations was provided by a walkway and crew positions had nearby escape hatches.

The Manchester was powered by a pair of Vulture engines; in service these proved to be extremely unreliable. Aviation author Jon Lake stated of the Vulture: &quot;The engine made the Manchester mainly notable for its unreliability, poor performance, and general inadequacy to the task at hand&quot; and attributed the aircraft&#x27;s poor service record to the engine troubles.

I was one of the six original pilots to have flown with the first Manchester squadron. That was a disaster. The aircraft itself, the airframe, had many shortcomings in equipment in the beginning, but as we found out Avro were excellent in doing modifications and re-equipping the aeroplane. The engines never were and never did become reliable. They did not give enough power for the aeroplane, so we ended up with two extremely unreliable 1,750 hp engines having to haul a 50,000-pound aircraft. We should really have had 2,500 hp engines. You felt that if you&#x27;d lost one, that was it, you weren&#x27;t coming home. It didn&#x27;t matter if you feathered the propeller or not. There was only one way you went and that was down. I have seen an aircraft doing a run up on the ground and have two pistons come right out through the side of the engine. The original bearings were made without any silver as an economy measure, so they weren&#x27;t hard enough. The bearings would collapse the connecting rod and the piston would fling out through the side of the engine and bang! Your engine just destroyed itself.

==Operational history==

On 5 August 1940, the first production Avro Manchester, &quot;L7276&quot;, was delivered to RAF Boscombe Down in advance of service acceptance trials. In November 1940, the Manchester officially entered service with the newly reformed No. 207 Squadron of RAF Bomber Command. The type passed all acceptance tests by 21 December 1940, and 207 Squadron had at least eight Manchesters on strength by the end of 1940. The Manchester&#x27;s first operational mission was conducted on 24–25 February 1941 in a raid on the French port of Brest. On 13 March 1941, &quot;L7319&quot; became the first Manchester to be shot down by enemy fire.

On 13 April 1941, all Manchesters were temporarily grounded due to a higher than expected number of engine bearing failures; on 16 June 1941, a second grounding of the type was ordered due to more engine troubles. The unserviceability of the Vulture engine forced squadrons to make use of obsolete bombers such as the Hampden in its place. Upon the restart of operations in August 1941, additional failings were encountered; excessive tail flutter, hydraulic failures and faulty propeller feathering controls. Production of the Manchester was halted in November 1941, by which point a total of 202 aircraft had been constructed. A total of eight bomber squadrons were equipped with the type, it also served in two further squadrons and also saw use by RAF Coastal Command.
While modifications were made by Avro to address some of the technical issues experienced, unit strength suffered and Bomber Command was frequently unable to raise significant numbers of aircraft to participate in large bombing missions; on 7 November 1941, all of the RAFs serviceable bombers had been dispatched to bomb Berlin, out of a force of over 400 bombers, only 15 were Manchesters. On 3 March 1942, out of a force of nearly 200 bombers sent against a Renault factory near Paris, 25 were Manchesters; while during the first 1,000 bomber raid on Cologne on 30 May 1942, 35 Manchesters were amongst the 1,047 bombers sent to attack the city. Flying Officer Leslie Manser was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions while piloting Manchester &quot;L7301&quot; of 50 Squadron during the Cologne bombing mission.

The Mk III Manchester (serial number &quot;BT308&quot;) which first flew on 9 January 1941, was essentially the first Lancaster, featuring a longer wing fitted with four Rolls-Royce Merlins in new unitized, power-egg nacelles – originally developed by Rolls-Royce for the Merlin-powered Beaufighter II – although initially retaining the three fins and twin outboard rudders (the central fin had no movable control surface) of the Manchester I. &quot;BT308&quot; received the &quot;Lancaster&quot; name immediately after its first flight. The second prototype Lancaster &quot;DG595&quot; featured the twin, enlarged fins and rudders of the Manchester IA. Manchester production continued until November of that year but some aircraft that were still in production were instead completed as Lancasters.

The 193 operational Manchesters flew 1,269 sorties with Bomber Command, dropping 1,826 tons (1,657 tonnes) of bombs and lost 78 aircraft in action, flying its last operation against Bremen on 25 June 1942. A further 45 were non-operational losses of which 30 involved engine failure. The Manchester was withdrawn from operations in mid-1942 in favour of more capable aircraft. Its final role in RAF service was as instructional trainers for converting crews to the RAF&#x27;s new Lancaster bombers; the Manchester and Lancaster shared nearly identical crew positions and fuselages. The type persisted in use for training purposes into 1943 before being completely retired.

==Variants==
;Manchester &quot;L7246&quot;
:First prototype originally with twin tail. Due to lack of directional stability, it had a third fin added. Became a training airframe in November 1942.
;Manchester &quot;L7247&quot;
:Second prototype first flown 26 May 1940, fitted with armament, became a training airframe in October 1941.
;Manchester I
:First production version with 90 ft wing and 28 ft twin tail and additional central fin later added; 20 of this type were built.
;Manchester IA
:Main production version with 90 ft wing, twin tail with 33 ft enlarged tailplane. It also had taller fins and rudders.
;Manchester IB
:As Manchester IA but with thin-gauge fuselage skin.
;Manchester IC
:As Manchester IB but with 2 x 2,520 hp Bristol Centaurus. Installed in one airframe but never flown.
;Manchester II
:As Manchester IB but with 95 ft wing.
;Manchester IIA
:As Manchester II but with 2 x Bristol Centaurus. None built.
;Manchester III &quot;BT308&quot;
:This version was powered by four Merlin engines with increased wingspan; also, the three fins and rudders of the Manchester I were retained. This variant was the first prototype of the later Avro Lancaster.

===Orders and production===
* Two prototypes were ordered against specification P.13/36 and were built by Avro at Ringway.
* Production contract for 200 Manchesters placed with Avro to be built at Chadderton, contract changed to Lancaster I production after 157 had been built, delivered between August 1940 and November 1941.
* Production contract for 150 Manchesters placed with Fairey to be built at Ringway, order cancelled.
* Production contract for 200 Manchesters placed with Metropolitan-Vickers at Trafford Park, contract changed to Lancaster I production after 43 had been built, delivered between March 1941 and March 1942. The first 12 aircraft being built on the Trafford Park production line were destroyed in a German air raid on 23 December 1940, not being completed they are not included in the total aircraft built.
* Production contract for 150 Manchesters placed with Armstrong-Whitworth, order cancelled.
In total two prototypes and 200 production aircraft were built before the production lines changed to building the four-engine Lancaster.

<doc id="381103" wikidata="Q1302527" url="?curid=381103" title="Māra">
<text>Māra is the highest-ranking goddess in Latvian mythology, the ancient Dawn-goddess, previously called Austra, and, not at all, although often stated, the same as Zemes māte (Mother Earth, pace).

==Names==
Alternative names: Māre, Mārīte (diminutive), Mārša, Māršava (Western Latvia).

==Description==
She is the patroness of all feminine duties (children, cattle), patroness of all the economic activities (&quot;God made the table, Māra made the bread&quot;), even money and markets. Being the alternate side of Dievs, she takes a person&#x27;s body after their death while Dievs is taking the soul. She is the goddess of the land, which is called &quot;Māras zeme&quot; (&#x27;Māra&#x27;s land&#x27;). She is called &#x27;Mother of Cows&#x27; (&quot;Govu māte&quot;), the same way the Vedic Dawn-goddess is called &quot;gávām mātár-&quot; &#x27;id&#x27;.

In western Latvia, and to a lesser degree in the rest of Latvia, she was strongly associated with Laima, and may have been considered the same deity.

==Festivals==
The festival Māras was held in her honor every August 15. This is probably a result of Christian influence and identification of Māra with Mary, whose main festival (the Assumption) has fallen on the same date since early times. Opinions are divided over whether Māra is a pre-Christian deity, or originated as a reflection of the Christian Mary created by semi-Christian Livonian peasants.

<text>Mara, in Buddhism, is a malignant celestial Asura king who tried to stop Prince Siddhartha from Awakening by trying to seduce him with his celestial Army and a vision of beautiful women who, in various legends, are often said to be Mara&#x27;s daughters.

In Buddhist cosmology, Mara is associated with death, rebirth and desire. Nyanaponika Thera has described Mara as &quot;the personification of the forces antagonistic to enlightenment.&quot;

He is Yama&#x27;s fearsome persona and all beings associated with him, darkness and death, become forces of Mara. These forces consist of Asuras, Rakshasa, Pisacas, Aratis and animals.

== Origin ==
His name is first mentioned in the &quot;Atharva Veda&quot; (1200 BCE–1000 BCE) as Mrtyu and Agha Mara, the evil slayer. He is called the &quot;evil one who kills&quot; and &quot;Papiyan&quot;, denoting a being which is not only morally bad but intertwined with sorrow, pain and misfortune.

While Mara&#x27;s origin is of Hindu nature, the development of the symbolism of Mara was spread by Buddhism.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;Māra&quot; comes from the Sanskrit form of the verbal root &quot;mṛ&quot;. It takes a present indicative form &quot;mṛyate&quot; and a causative form &quot;mārayati&quot; (with strengthening of the root vowel from ṛ to ār). &quot;Māra&quot; is a verbal noun from the causative root and means &#x27;causing death&#x27; or &#x27;killing&#x27;. It is related to other words for death from the same root, such as: &quot;maraṇa&quot; and &quot;mṛtyu&quot;. The latter is a name for death personified and is sometimes identified with Yama.

The root &quot;mṛ&quot; is related to the Indo-European verbal root &quot;*mer&quot; meaning &quot;die, disappear&quot; in the context of &quot;death, murder or destruction&quot;. It is &quot;very wide-spread&quot; in Indo-European languages suggesting it to be of great antiquity, according to Mallory and Adams.

==Four types of Māra==
In traditional Buddhism, four or five metaphorical forms of Māra are given:
* &quot;Kleśa-māra&quot; – Māra as the embodiment of all unskillful emotions, such as greed, hate and delusion.
* &quot;Mṛtyu-māra&quot; – Māra as death.
* &quot;Skandha-māra&quot; – Māra as metaphor for the entirety of conditioned existence.
* &quot;Devaputra-māra&quot; – the deva of the sensuous realm, who tried to prevent Gautama Buddha from attaining liberation from the cycle of rebirth on the night of the Buddha&#x27;s enlightenment.

==Character==
Early Buddhism acknowledged both a literal and psychological interpretation of Mara.

Mara is described both as an entity having an existence in Kāma-world, just as are shown existing around the Buddha, and also is described in pratītyasamutpāda as, primarily, the guardian of passion and the catalyst for lust, hesitation and fear that obstructs meditation among Buddhists. The Denkōroku refers to him as the &quot;One Who Delights in Destruction&quot;, which highlights his nature as a deity among the Parinirmitavaśavarti devas.

&quot;Buddha defying Mara&quot; is a common pose of Buddha sculptures. The Buddha is shown with his left hand in his lap, palm facing upwards and his right hand on his right knee. The fingers of his right hand touch the earth, to call the earth as his witness for defying Mara and achieving enlightenment. This posture is also referred to as the bhūmisparśa &quot;earth-witness&quot; mudra.

In certain Sri Lankan traditions, the mount of Mara is said to be Girimekhala, a gargantuan elephant with black hide, and reaching 250 yojana in height.

===Three daughters===
In some accounts of the Buddha&#x27;s enlightenment, it is said that the demon Māra did not send his three daughters to tempt but instead they came willingly after Māra&#x27;s setback in his endeavor to eliminate the Buddha&#x27;s quest for enlightenment. Mara&#x27;s three daughters are identified as (Thirst), &quot;Arati&quot; (Aversion, Discontentment), and &quot;Rāga&quot; (Attachment, Desire, Greed, Passion). For example, in the Samyutta Nikaya&#x27;s &quot;Māra-sayutta&quot;, Mara&#x27;s three daughters were undressing in front of the Buddha; but failed to entice him:
:They had come to him glittering with beauty –
:Taṇhā, Arati, and Rāga –
:But the Teacher swept them away right there
:As the wind, a fallen cotton tuft.
The three daughters of Māra were inspired by Aratis, a type of feminine goblin that was associated with avarice.

===Mara&#x27;s conversion===
&quot;The Jingde Record of the Transmission of the Lamp&quot; and the &quot;Denkoroku&quot; both contain a story of Mara&#x27;s conversion to Buddhism under the auspices of the monk Upagupta.

According to the story, Upagupta journeyed to the kingdom of Mathura and preached the Dharma with great success. This caused Mara&#x27;s palace to tremble, prompting the deity to use his destructive powers against the Dharma. When Upagupta entered samadhi, Mara approached him and slipped a jade necklace around his neck.

Upagupta reciprocated by transforming the corpses of a man, a dog, and a snake into a garland and gifted it to Mara. When Mara discovered the true nature of the gift, he sought the help of Brahma to remove it. Brahma informed him that because the necklace was bestowed by an advanced disciple of the Buddha, its effects could only be assuaged by taking refuge in Upagupta.

Mara returned to the human world where he prostrated before the monk and repented. At Upagupta&#x27;s recommendation, he vowed never to do harm to the Dharma and took refuge in the Three Jewels.

==In popular culture==
Mara appears in Roger Zelazny&#x27;s 1967 novel &quot;Lord of Light&quot; as a god of illusion.

Mara has appeared as a recurring Demon in the Megami Tensei franchise, as well as in its spinoffs. Here, Mara takes the appearance of a giant penis riding a golden chariot. Mara has consistently been one of the most popular demons in the series, even reaching #1 popularity on some demon popularity polls.

In 2020, the singer-songwriter Jack Garratt released a song entitled &quot;Mara&quot;. Inspired by the story of Mara&#x27;s distraction of the Buddha, &quot;Mara&quot; describes Garratt&#x27;s experience of intrusive thoughts.

In the manga/anime, Record of Ragnarok, the character Hajun (Papiyas in the English translation) was inspired by Mara and becomes an enemy to Buddha in the sixth round of the Ragnarok tournament. Hajun is portrayed as being tall and muscular with long lilac hair, two gigantic red buffalo-shaped horns protruding from each side of his head, and several spike-like seemingly bones protruding from his forearms and his shoulders with intricate tattoos. He also has a prominent hole marking on the left side his chest and wears a giant patterned loincloth. He is ultimately killed by Buddha at the end of the round.

<doc id="381114" wikidata="Q26155" url="?curid=381114" title="Jounieh">
<text>Jounieh (, or &quot;Juniya&quot;, ) is a coastal city in Keserwan District, about north of Beirut, Lebanon. Since 2017, it has been the capital of Keserwan-Jbeil Governorate. Jounieh is known for its seaside resorts and bustling nightlife, as well as its old stone souk, ferry port, paragliding site and gondola lift (&quot;le téléphérique&quot;), which takes passengers up the mountain to the shrine of Our Lady of Lebanon in Harissa.

Above Jounieh, and on the way to Harissa, a small hill named Bkerké (, or &quot;Bkerki&quot;), overlooking the Jounieh bay, is the seat of the Patriarch of the Maronite Catholic Church of Lebanon. Residents of Jounieh and the surrounding towns are overwhelmingly Maronite Catholics. Maameltein is a district of Ghazir village.

==History==
The history of Jounieh goes back to the time the Phoenicians. The town was an important trading center along the Lebanon coastline. In those days the port was an important one during winter, as it served as a safe spot for ships sailing south to Byblos. This gave the place the name of the name of &quot;Palaebyblus&quot; that means &#x27;Before Byblos”. In his geographic description the Greek historian Strabo mentions this town.

The reason few remains can be seen today is due to the fact that during the Roman and Byzantine period, many buildings and structures were built over the Phoenicians buildings and some are still visible today.

The medieval Muslim historian al-Idrisi (d. 1165) notes that Jounieh was a sea fortress whose inhabitants were Jacobite Christians. The Syrian geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi (d. 1226) called it a dependency of Tripoli.

In the sixth part of &quot;The Introduction to Jounieh in the Mid Nineteenth Century&quot;, Professor Butrus Al-Boustani said: “Jounieh is a place on the Keserwan coast which has warehouses, stores, and a dye house. Ships and boats bring supplies and its grain trade is very popular. Thus a district of the following villages: Sarba, Ghadir, and Harat Sakhr was named for it. Its total population is 2,500. Jounieh itself is not a residential area but mainly a commercial district whose workers come from neighboring towns.”

=== Ottoman Empire ===
Jounieh was connected with neighboring areas by roads built for carriages. So it was connected with Bkerké and beyond it during the rule of Dawud Basha, the ruler of Mount Lebanon. It was connected to Ghazir between 1867 and 1868 despite the objection of Ghazir&#x27;s residents. Another road connected Jounieh to the Beirut Bridge during the rule of Rustum Basha. To the north it was connected by a carriage&#x27;s road until Batroun during the rule of Wasa Basha (1883–1892). In 1892, Jounieh was connected to Beirut via a railroad that had stations between the two locations, three of which in Jounieh and its environs: Sarba, Jounieh, and Mu’amilitain at the end of the line, which facilitated the transportation of goods and passengers from and to the Governorate of Beirut. In 1876, the number of shops exceeded 300, five silk factories, three rest houses, a mill, three juice factories, an artificial ice factory, a bank known by its owner&#x27;s name &quot;Bank Baghos&quot;, and a group of small sailboat construction sites.

In 1906, according to the &quot;Guide to Lebanon&quot; by Ibrahim Beik Al-Soud, the population of Jounieh was 2,400, and it had a silk factory owned by the Nasras, a silkworms choker owned by Moussa de Franj, a silk factory owned by the heirs of Rizkallah and Abdul Ahad Khadra which had 190 wheels and produced 10,000 cocoons, 330 domestic animals, and owned 80 carriages.
According to the records of the Keserwan Governorate, the town of Ghadir, in 1914, had 433 corporations and its population was 1,263. The town of Sarba had 213 commercial institutions and its population was 1,714. In Harat Sakhr, there were 165 corporations and its population was 808. In Sahil ‘Alma, there were 21 corporations its population reached 187. Jounieh had seen noticeable prosperity after France and the Maronite Patriarchy supported the opening a port for commercial ships which became (with the Al-Nabi Younes Port on the Chouf Coast) the official port of Mount Lebanon.

In 1913 and during the Mandate era, Jounieh suffered economic decline and recession as the French administration moved part of Jounieh’s administrative role to the Capital, Beirut. Also Jounieh came out of the First World War weakened by famine and economic stagnation. So several of its inhabitants were forced to move to the capital or to immigrate, and Jounieh lost most of its expertise. Its social and population development stopped, and its economic development weakened. The 1932 statistics showed 1,286 housed in Jounieh: 371 in Sarba, 434 in Ghadir, 350 houses in Harat Sakhr, and 131 in Sahil ‘Alma. This affected the building industry and records in the town hall showed very limited number of permits given from 1922-1940. The only active sectors in that period were schools, small crafts, and planting of citrus trees, sugar cane, and vegetables. This situation stayed the same until the rule of President Fuad Chehab who outfitted the city with all that it needed to become modern. Jounieh then awakened from its slumber with projects for roads, lighting, modern planning, a stadium, a tourist port, a government house, and infrastructure. President Chehab used a number of experts and engineers headed by the French engineer Ecochard. The talk became of “Monte Carlo of the East” and Jounieh stood out as a bride of the Lebanese coast. In 1959, it started to attract banks, the first which were the Lebanese Commerce Bank and the Lebanese Federal Bank. By 1975 the number of banks reached six and today there are 38 banks in addition to the Lebanese Central Bank which was established in 1879.

=== Modern history ===

The area also witnessed an increase in the price of land from an average of seven to nine Lebanese pounds per square meter between 1950 and 1960 to an average of 25 to 35 Lebanese pounds in 1965.

The construction sector developed slowly starting from Sarba to Harat Sakhr, and finally the coast of ‘Alma. The buildings also started expanding around the city as the agricultural sector contracted and became confined to the coasts of Kaslik and some orchards in Ghadir, Harat Sakhr and the coast of ‘Alma. In the beginning of the seventies, Jounieh was transformed to a major and complete tourist center with the tourist network around it and on its edges including: Casino du Liban, the cable cars, the Harisa Church, the caverns in Jeita, restaurants, hotels, nightclubs, and the port.

==== Lebanese Civil War ====
With the war of 1975, and the division of Beirut into East and West parts and the escalation of the violence, many people fled to safe areas and were organizing their lives in accordance with the new realities.

From 1980 to 1990, Jounieh witnessed a massive migration as a large number of the Beirut traders moved to its markets. Buildings took over its green spaces, and the tourist complexes took over its shores. So its features changed randomly though it benefited from the use of the tourist port for commerce.

During the Civil War the ferry making the 120 mile journey from Jounieh to Larnaca was the only way to travel in and out of Lebanon for those living in the areas controlled by Christian militias. Over the fourteen years from 1975 an estimated 990,000 Lebanese left the country, up to 40% of the population.
During the 1989 fighting between General Aoun and the Lebanese Forces 10,000 civilians from Beirut arrived in Cyprus over a six-week period. On 24 February 1990 the ferry was attacked by an unidentified naval patrol boat. One passenger was killed and seventeen wounded. In 1997 a catamaran was operating between Larnaca and Jounieh. A return ticket for the four-hour journey cost US$100. At the time the average monthly income in Lebanon was US$132.

==== Post Civil War ====
On 18 June 1991 six people were killed and 30 wounded after an explosion at a Lebanese Forces ammunition dump.

On 7 May 2005, a car bomb exploded between the Christian Sawt al Mahaba radio station and the Mar Yuhanna Church in Jounieh. The radio station was destroyed and the church suffered major damage. Twenty-two people were wounded.

Today, close to 100,000 people reside in Jounieh. Those who live in its suburbs exceed that number. By the middle of the century, it is predicted that Jounieh will become a suburb of Beirut in a coastal line that forms one city that expands the length of the coastal road at a time when the inhabitants of Lebanon will reach six million plus around the year 2025. The population of Jounieh is majority Maronite.

==Demographics==
In 2014, Christians made up 97.71% of registered voters in Jounieh. 71.19% of the voters were Maronite Catholics, 8.82% were Greek Catholics, 6.03% were Armenian Orthodox and 5.40% were Greek Orthodox.

==International relations==

<text>In New Zealand, long distance walking or hiking for at least one overnight stay is known as tramping. There are a number of walkways in New Zealand, however most of these are relatively short and can be walked in a day or less. Many are also an easy walk, with well formed footpaths. However, some tracks require an overnight stay either because of the rugged country or the length of the track.

New Zealand has both public and private tramping tracks. Public tracks are managed by the Department of Conservation, Regional Councils or other authorities. They generally cross public land (including National Parks), or private land with negotiated public access. Access is free and in most cases unrestricted, although fees are payable for overnight stays in huts or camping.

Private tracks cross private land, with restricted fee-based access. Itineraries are generally fixed. Fees may cover things such as overnight accommodation, food and pack transportation.
