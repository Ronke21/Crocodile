<doc id="389540" wikidata="Q3116531" url="?curid=389540" title="Takenaka Corporation">
<text>is one of five major general contractors in Japan. Takenaka provides architectural, engineering, and construction services and has its headquarters located in Chūō-ku, Osaka, Osaka Prefecture. Takenaka has eight domestic offices in Japan with overseas offices in Asia, Europe, and the United States. It has remained under family control since the founding of Takenaka Corporation in 1609, and is currently led by the 17th generation of the family.

The Takenaka corporation designed and built the Takenaka Carpentry Tools Museum.

== About Takenaka ==
In 1610 Tobei Masataka Takenaka (竹中 藤兵衛正高), a shrine and temple carpenter, started a business in Nagoya. The business continued as a family business and built some of the first Western-style buildings in Japan during the last half of 19th century, most of them in Nagoya. In 1899 Toemon Takenaka (竹中 藤右衛門), a 14th generation descendant of the original founder established a branch office in Kobe and founded Takenaka Corporation as an official company.

The company grew during the 20th century; its capital in 1909 was about ¥100,000. This rose to ¥6 million in 1938, ¥1.5 billion in 1959 and ¥50 billion in 1979. Today, Takenaka Corporation is a multinational company with offices in 18 different countries. The current president is Masato Sasaki (since 2019).

The Takenaka Corporation claims to be the oldest operating firms of its type in the world. In 2006 Takenaka acquired competing family architect-carpentry business (Miyadaiku) Kongō Gumi which had been in operation for 1,427 years.

The company is now regarded in Japan as one of the &quot;Big Five&quot; contractors ranked alongside Kajima, Obayashi, Shimizu and Taisei. The firm has built some of the most important buildings in Japan, including the Tokyo Tower, the Tokyo Dome (the first large-scale stadium with an air-supported membrane roof in Japan), the Fukuoka Dome (Japan&#x27;s first large-scale stadium with a retractable roof), and the Kobe Meriken Park Oriental Hotel among others.

Among its current proposals is the Sky City 1000 project.

Takenaka reconstructed the &quot;Suzakumon&quot; in Nara.

== Issues ==

=== Insufficient reinforcement ===
* On November 19, 2007, during the construction of a 27-story (94 meter high) highrise condominium in Minato, Tokyo, the whole 8th and 9th floors of the building had to be dismantled and rebuilt because the reinforcing steel used was of insufficient strength.

=== Industrial accident cover-ups ===
* According to a report of December 28, 2007, a 52-year-old foreman of a Takenaka condominium construction site in Fukushima ward, Osaka, reported an industrial accident in which a falling concrete hose seriously injured a worker of sub-contractor, Airtech Co., Ltd. The accident was reported as having happened at a different demolition site that the foreman was also in charge of. Takenaka and Airtech were issued a summary indictment by the Osaka prosecutor&#x27;s office for violating the Industrial Safety and Health Act.
* Takenaka also announced on December 19, 2007, that it had failed to report an industrial accident at a Toyota factory it was building in Kariya City, Aichi Prefecture, and that it was under investigation for violation of the Industrial Safety and Health Act.

=== Tax evasion (non-reporting of income) ===
* In March 2013, it was discovered that the Osaka National Tax Office had reprimanded the company for failing to declare about ¥30 million of income (¥9 million of it intentionally) between 2008 and 2011.
* In April 2015, the same office reprimanded the company again for underreporting its income for the four years between 2010 and 2013 by about ¥150 million.

=== Leaky subway ===
* On September 25, 2014, train services at Nagoya Station on the Higashiyama Subway Line were suspended for nine hours due to water leaking into the station as a result of construction work the company was carrying out on the JR Tower Nagoya building.

=== Falling window ===
* On February 17, 2015, a window frame weighing approximately 100 kg fell from the 4th floor of the Kofu City Hall building, which had been built by the company and two other companies. A subsequent investigation by Kofu City found 87 defects in the building. Executives of Takenaka and the other two companies involved, Nihon Sekkei and Sankyo Tateyama, visited the mayor of Kofu on March 20, 2015, to apologize.

<text>Johann Friedrich Fasch (15 April 1688 – 5 December 1758) was a German violinist and composer. Much of his music is in the Baroque-Classical transitional style known as galant.

==Life==
Fasch was born in the town of Buttelstedt, 11 km north of Weimar, the eldest child of schoolmaster Friedrich Georg Fasch and his wife Sophie Wegerig, from Leißling near Weißenfels. After his father&#x27;s death in 1700, Fasch lived with his maternal uncle, the clergyman Gottfried Wegerig in Göthewitz, and it was presumably in this way that he made the acquaintance of the Opera composer Reinhard Keiser.

Fasch was a choirboy in Weissenfels and studied under Johann Kuhnau at the St. Thomas School in Leipzig. It was in Leipzig in 1708 that he founded a Collegium Musicum. In 1711 he wrote an opera to be performed at the Peter-Paul Festival in Naumburg, and a second one for the festival in 1712.

In 1714, unable to procure aristocratic patronage for a journey to Italy, Fasch instead travelled to Darmstadt to study composition for three months under his former Leipzig prefect Christoph Graupner and Gottfried Grünewald. He then traveled extensively in the Holy Roman Empire, becoming a violinist in the orchestra in Bayreuth in 1714, was an amanuensis in Gera till 1719 and from 1719 until 1721 held a court post as organist in Greiz.

His next major post was Prague, where he served for two years as Kapellmeister and court composer to Count Morzin. In 1722, he &quot;reluctantly accepted the position&quot; of court &quot;Kapellmeister&quot; at Zerbst, Saxony-Anhalt, a post he held until his death. (The organist Johann Ulich was his assistant.) Also in 1722, he was invited to apply for the position of Thomaskantor in Leipzig at his alma mater, the St. Thomas School, but he chose to withdraw his name from the competition. The Leipzig opening was eventually filled by Johann Sebastian Bach, who had considerable esteem for Fasch.

==Works==
His works include cantatas, concertos, symphonies, and chamber music. None of his music was published in his lifetime, and according to The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians in 2014, &quot;it appears that most of his vocal works (including 9 complete cantata cycles, at least 14 masses and four operas) are lost, while the instrumental works are mostly extant.&quot; However, his music was &quot;widely performed&quot; in his day and was held in high regard by contemporaries. Georg Philipp Telemann performed a cycle of his church cantatas in 1733 in Hamburg; an organ work once attributed to Johann Sebastian Bach as BWV 585 is now known to be an arrangement of movements from a Fasch trio sonata; and Bach&#x27;s Collegium Musicum in Leipzig (a different group than the one founded by Fasch) performed some of Fasch&#x27;s Orchestral Suites (ten of them, according to Hugo Riemann in 1900, based on his examination of copies in the library of the St. Thomas School, which Riemann said were partly in Bach&#x27;s hand. Only one of these suites survived World War II; it is in the hand of Bach&#x27;s student Carl Gotthelf Gerlach).

In 1900, Riemann asserted that Fasch&#x27;s style was an important link between the Baroque and Classical periods, and that he was one of those who &quot;set instrumental music entirely on its feet and displaced fugal writing with modern &#x27;thematic&#x27; style’&quot;; &quot;New Grove&quot;&#x27;s entry on Fasch states, &quot;Later research has largely confirmed [Riemann&#x27;s] assessment.&quot;

==Legacy==
Fasch died in Zerbst at the age of 70 on 5 December 1758. He was the father of Carl Friedrich Christian Fasch, born on 18 November 1736, like his father a musician of note. The city of Zerbst/Anhalt has been hosting International Festivals since 1983, biennially since 1993. The Sixteenth International Fasch Festival (2021) was cancelled due to COVID-19 restrictions. The 17th International Fasch Festival was scheduled to take place from 15 to 18 June 2023 in Zerbst/Anhalt.

==Works list==
This listing is based on Rüdiger Pfeiffer&#x27;s now out-dated &quot;Fasch Werke Verzeichnis.&quot; The Internationale Fasch Gesellschaft e.V. has been working on a new online Fasch-Verzeichnis, which is now called Fasch-Repertorium. Its main contributor, Dr. Gottfried Gille, gave a paper on the project&#x27;s progress at the 2013 international Fasch conference, held on the occasion of the twelfth International Fasch Festival (18-21 April 2013). All papers presented at the conference were published in vol. 12 of Fasch-Studien.

<doc id="389542" wikidata="Q434475" url="?curid=389542" title="Carmen Lawrence">
<text>Carmen Mary Lawrence (born 2 March 1948) is an Australian academic and former politician who was the premier of Western Australia from 1990 to 1993, the first woman to become the premier of an Australian state. To date she is the only female premier of Western Australia. A member of the Labor Party, she later entered federal politics as a member of the House of Representatives from 1994 to 2007, and served as a minister in the Keating government.

Lawrence was born in Northam, Western Australia. She studied psychology at the University of Western Australia, obtaining a doctorate in 1983, and before entering politics worked as a lecturer and researcher. Lawrence was elected to state parliament in 1986, and became a government minister in 1988. She replaced Peter Dowding as premier in 1990, as Australia&#x27;s second female head of government (after ACT Chief Minister Rosemary Follett) and first female state premier. She and the Labor Party lost power at the 1993 state election.

In 1994, Lawrence entered federal parliament through a by-election for the Division of Fremantle. She was almost immediately appointed to cabinet by Paul Keating, serving as Minister for Human Services and Health and Minister for Women until the government&#x27;s defeat in 1996. Lawrence remained in parliament until the 2007 election, on the frontbench until 2002 and then as a backbencher. From 2004 to 2005, she was federal president of the Labor Party, the first person to be directly elected to the position. She returned to academia after leaving politics, as a psychology professor at the University of Western Australia.

==Early life==
Lawrence was born in Northam, in the agricultural district of Western Australia and spent her early childhood in the towns of Gutha and Dongara.

She was one of seven children, six girls and a boy, born to Ernest Richard Lawrence, a farmer, and his wife Mary Norma (née Watson).
From the age of six she was educated at various Roman Catholic boarding schools: Marian Convent at Morawa; Dominican Ladies College at Dongara and Santa Maria College at Attadale from which she matriculated in 1964 with distinctions in six subjects, a General Exhibition for Academic Achievement and the Special Subject Exhibition in economics.

==Further education and employment==
In 1965, Lawrence enrolled at the University of Western Australia in Perth. In 1968 she graduated as a Bachelor of Psychology with First Class Honours, having won five prizes including that for the most outstanding graduate throughout the Faculties of Arts, Economics and Commerce, Law, Architecture and Education. In 1968 she was Senior Student in Saint Catherine&#x27;s residential college.

She was politically active from an early stage. While at UWA she lobbied, successfully, to have the Campus Beauty Contest abolished. In Melbourne in the early 1970s she helped to found the Victorian Branch of the Women&#x27;s Electoral Lobby.

She tutored at the University of Melbourne in 1971 and 1972, tutored and lectured at the Western Australian Institute of Technology (WAIT) from 1973 to 1978 and was a lecturer with the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Western Australia from 1979 until 1983. During this period she continued with post-graduate research, having won two scholarships for PhD studies in psychology, and received the doctoral degree in 1983, for her dissertation &quot;Maternal Responses to Infant Crying&quot;.

From 1983 until her election to parliament in 1986, Lawrence was employed in the Research and Evaluation Unit of the Psychiatric Services Branch of the Department of Health of Western Australia.

==State political career==
===Entry to state parliament===
During this period, Lawrence joined the Labor Party. She unsuccessfully contested the seat of East Melville at the 1983 election against sitting Liberal Party member Anthony Trethowan, but was more successful in 1986 when she won the seat of Subiaco following the retirement of long-serving Liberal-turned-independent Tom Dadour. In 1988, following the sudden departure of Brian Burke as Premier, she was appointed Minister for Education. At the 1989 election, her seat of Subiaco was abolished in a redistribution, and she won the new seat of Glendalough.

The Western Australian Labor government was in a state of crisis as a result of corruption allegations against the cabinets of two successive premiers, Brian Burke and Peter Dowding, the so-called &quot;WA Inc&quot; period.

===Premier of Western Australia===
In February 1990, Dowding was forced by his colleagues to resign. Lawrence, a prominent opponent within the Labor Party of Brian Burke&#x27;s Right faction, of which Dowding was a member, replaced him as Premier on 12 February 1990, with Ian Taylor as her deputy.

Lawrence was the first female Premier of an Australian State. However, she was not the first female head of government of a province of the Commonwealth of Australia; being preceded by Rosemary Follett, who became Chief Minister of the ACT on 11 May 1989.

On 19 November 1990, Lawrence called a Royal Commission into matters related to the WA Inc deals, after considerable public and media pressure. The commission hearings began on 12 March 1991, and within months, the Labor party became a minority government as three left-wing MPs left the party to sit as independents. Coverage of the commission hearings dominated media headlines for most of the period from then until the 1993 election.

==== Juvenile crime ====
Between mid-1990 and early 1992, several high-speed chases involving cars stolen by repeat juvenile offenders resulted in the deaths of 10 people, including a businessman and several young parents. All received considerable media attention, most notably from 6PR&#x27;s Howard Sattler. On 25 December 1991, 22-year-old Margaret Blurton and her infant son Shane were killed in a crash involving Kingsley Arnold Pickett, a 14-year-old Aboriginal offender in a stolen motor vehicle. 
Margaret&#x27;s husband Peter survived, and gained public sympathy through bedside interviews to print and electronic media. A candlelight vigil was organised outside Parliament House on 4 January 1992, and exactly a month later, responding directly to the public call for action, Lawrence and deputy leader Ian Taylor tabled the &quot;Crime (Serious and Repeat Offenders) Sentencing Bill 1992&quot;, which was rushed through parliament despite the advice of a committee that it was &quot;unworkable and unsustainable&quot;. Peter Blurton established the Margaret and Shane Foundation to channel both his own grief and the immense public sympathy into a workforce to fight for the rights of crime victims. The law, however, turned out to be defective and Lawrence later declared it to have been a mistake. The Act was repealed in June 1994.

====Transport infrastructure====
The other matter which preoccupied the Government was the ongoing construction of the Northern Suburbs Transit System, later to be known as the Joondalup line, which proceeded throughout Lawrence&#x27;s term as Premier. She officially opened the line on 20 December 1992, with three stations on the line opening initially. On 21 March 1993, the other stations opened. The Perth City Busport (now known as Elizabeth Quay Bus Station) was opened on 30 November 1991 to centralise services travelling through the central business district.

===Easton petition===
=== Election defeat ===
In the election held on 6 February 1993, the Lawrence government was defeated by the Liberal-National coalition and Richard Court, who had replaced Barry MacKinnon as opposition leader just a year earlier, became Premier. Lawrence remained as Opposition Leader until early 1994.

In December 1993, Lawrence, Jim McGinty and Geoff Gallop joined in a petition to the High Court of Australia to challenge the franchise system for the Western Australian Legislative Council. The system of vote-weighting tended to favour the conservative parties and was a long-term obstacle to the ALP gaining control of the council. On 20 February 1996, the High Court rejected the challenge on the basis that the law was not unconstitutional.

==Federal political career==

===Entry to Federal Parliament and Cabinet Ministry===

On 12 March 1994, following the resignation of former Federal treasurer and member for Fremantle, John Dawkins, she won a by-election for the seat and entered federal politics. Fremantle is a safe Labor seat which had once been held by Labor Prime Minister John Curtin, and later, Whitlam-era Education Minister Kim Beazley senior.

On 25 March 1994, she was appointed Minister for Human Services and Health and Minister assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women in the Keating government.

====The Royal Commission====
In May 1995, Premier Court requested the establishment of a Royal Commission to determine the circumstances of the tabling of the Easton affair petition. On 14 November 1995, the Royal Commission released a report which found that Lawrence had misled the Western Australian Parliament concerning her knowledge of and role in the tabling of the petition. Paul Keating denounced the commission as a political stunt and accused the Commissioner, Kenneth Marks QC, of bias.

At the 1996 federal election, the Keating government lost office and, following Paul Keating&#x27;s resignation of the leadership, Kim Beazley, a Western Australian, became the new Leader of the Opposition.

Lawrence was appointed to the Opposition frontbench as Shadow Environment Minister. On 21 February 1997, she was charged with three counts of perjury resulting from the findings of the Marks Royal Commission. She stood down from the shadow ministry pending her trial. She was acquitted on 23 July 1999.

====Later political life====
In September 2000 Beazley approved her reappointment to the Labor frontbench, and appointed her shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, the Arts and Status of Women.

During the 2001 federal election campaign, Lawrence strongly disapproved of Beazley&#x27;s support for the government&#x27;s policy of detaining asylum-seekers (see Tampa affair). In December 2002 she resigned from the Shadow Cabinet, describing the party&#x27;s policies on asylum and immigration as &quot;brutal and inhumane&quot;.

She announced on 29 March 2007 that she would not recontest her seat in the Parliament at the 2007 Australian federal election.

===Presidency of the ALP===
During 2002 the Labor Party approved a series of reforms proposed by new Opposition leader Simon Crean, among them the direct election of the party&#x27;s National President by the party membership (the post had previously been filled by election at the party&#x27;s National Conference) and a reduction of the unions&#x27; representation at party conferences from 60% to 50%. Lawrence emerged as the candidate of the party&#x27;s Left faction for the post, and the election took place in November 2003. Although she did not win an absolute majority of the votes, Lawrence topped the poll and was elected president, taking office on 1 January 2004, shortly after Mark Latham succeeded Crean as party Leader. She used the position to campaign in favour of a policy of better treatment for asylum-seekers entering Australia. Her term as National President ended on 1 January 2005, when she was succeeded by Barry Jones.

===After Parliament===

As foreshadowed in her announcement of March 2007, Lawrence did not contest the federal election held on 24 November 2007, thereby retiring from Parliament.
She was succeeded as Member for Fremantle by Melissa Parke, also of the ALP.

Following her departure from the federal Parliament, Lawrence was engaged for a term, in 2008, as a Professorial Fellow at the University of Western Australia. Her brief was to conduct collaborative research with a focus on the origins of fanaticism and extreme behaviour, including terrorism, under the auspices of the university&#x27;s Institute of Advanced Studies.

In 2016 Lawrence became president of the Conservation Council of Western Australia, and has campaigned against continuing sponsorship of major sporting clubs by companies involved in fossil fuel extraction.

In 2022, Lawrence was appointed Officer of the Order of Australia in the 2022 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours for &quot;distinguished service to the people and Parliaments of Australia and Western Australia, to conservation, and to arts administration&quot;.

<text>A scold&#x27;s bridle, sometimes called a witch&#x27;s bridle, a gossip&#x27;s bridle, a brank&#x27;s bridle, or simply branks, was an instrument of punishment, as a form of public humiliation. It was an iron muzzle in an iron framework that enclosed the head (although some bridles were masks that depicted suffering). A bridle-bit (or curb-plate), about in size, was slid into the mouth and pressed down on top of the tongue, often with a spike on the tongue, as a compress. It functioned to silence the wearer from speaking entirely, to prevent the women from nagging. The scold&#x27;s bridle was used on women. This prevented speaking and resulted in many unpleasant side effects for the wearer, including excessive salivation and fatigue in the mouth. For extra humiliation, a bell could also be attached to draw in crowds. The wearer was then led around town by a leash.

== Origin and purpose ==

===England and Scotland===
First recorded in Scotland in 1567, the branks were also used in England and its colonies. The kirk-sessions and barony courts in Scotland inflicted the contraption mostly on female transgressors and women considered to be rude, nags, common scolds, or drunken.

Branking (in Scotland and the North of England) was designed as a mirror punishment for shrews or scolds—women of the lower classes whose speech was deemed riotous or troublesome—by preventing them from speaking. This also gives it its other name, the &quot;Gossip&#x27;s Bridle&quot;.

It was also used as corporal punishment for other offences, notably on female workhouse inmates. The person to be punished was placed in a public place for additional humiliation and sometimes beaten. The Lanark Burgh Records record a typical example of the punishment being used: &quot;Iff evir the said Elizabeth salbe fund [shall be found] scolding or railling ... scho salbe sett [she shall be set] upone the trone in the brankis and be banishit [banished of] the toun thaireftir [thereafter]&quot; (1653 Lanark B. Rec. 151).

When the branks was installed, the wearer could be led through town to show that they had committed an offence or scolded too often. This was intended to humiliate them into repenting their alleged offensive actions. A spike inside the gag prevented any talking since any movement of the mouth could cause a severe piercing of the tongue. When wearing the device, it was impossible for the person either to eat or speak. Other branks included an adjustable gag with a sharp edge, causing any movement of the mouth to result in laceration of the tongue.

In Scotland, branks could also be permanently displayed in public by attaching them, for example, to the town cross, tron, or tolbooth. Then, the ritual humiliation would take place, with the convict on public show. Displaying the branks in public was intended to remind the populace of the consequences of any rash action or slander. Whether the person was paraded or simply taken to the point of punishment, the process of humiliation and expected repentance was the same. Time spent in the bridle was normally allocated by the kirk session or a local magistrate.

Quaker women were sometimes punished with the branks by non-Quaker authorities for preaching their religious doctrine in public places.

Jougs were similar in their effect to a pillory, but did not restrain the sufferer from speaking. They were generally used in both England and Scotland in the 16th and 17th centuries.

===The New World===
The scold&#x27;s bridle did not see much use in the New World, though Olaudah Equiano recorded seeing it used to control a Virginia slave in the mid-18th century.

Escrava Anastacia (&#x27;Anastacia the female slave&#x27;) is a Brazilian folk saint said to have died from wearing a punitive slave iron bit.

== Historical examples ==
Scotland
In 1567, Bessie Tailiefeir (pronounced Telfer) allegedly slandered the baillie Thomas Hunter in Edinburgh, saying that he was using false measures. She was sentenced to be &quot;brankit&quot; and fixed to the cross for one hour.

England
Two bridles were bought for use by the magistrates of Walsall in the 17th century, but it is not clear what happened to them or whether they were ever used. The Quaker preacher Dorothy Waugh was subjected to the bridle in 1655 in Carlisle and wrote an account of her imprisonment.

In Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, a replica of a scold&#x27;s bridle from 1633 that was stolen in 1965, was in a dedicated cabinet in the vestry of the church, with the inscription &quot;Chester presents Walton with a bridle, to curb women&#x27;s tongues that talk too idle.&quot; Oral tradition is this Chester lost a fortune due to a woman&#x27;s gossip, and presented the instrument of restraint or torture out of anger and spite. The church states it came to the parish in 1723 from Chester. The bridle was donated by the parish to Big Heritage CIC, an organisation based in Chester, for use in their museum displays, as it was felt to be inappropriate to continue to display it in a church building.

&quot;Mediæval London&quot; (1906) named six instances &quot;of branks preserved, I believe, to this day ... at Worcester, Ludlow, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Oxford, Shrewsbury ... Lichfield ... and many other places&quot;.

As late as 1856, such an item was used at Bolton le Moors, Lancashire.

== In fiction ==

* &quot;The Scold&#x27;s Bridle&quot; is the title of a novel by Minette Walters, where a scold&#x27;s bridle is a key element in the plot.
* In &quot;Brimstone&quot; (2016) actress Carice van Houten is wearing a scold&#x27;s bridle in some scenes.
* In &quot;Three Men in a Boat&quot; (1889), the iron scold&#x27;s bridle at Walton Church in Walton on Thames, Surrey, is mentioned as a local item of interest.

<doc id="389563" wikidata="Q4547812" url="?curid=389563" title="11th Army Group">
<text>The 11th Army Group was the main British Army force in Southeast Asia during the Second World War. Although a nominally British formation, it also included large numbers of troops and formations from the British Indian Army and from British African colonies, and also Nationalist Chinese and United States units.

==Formation==
11th Army Group was activated in November 1943 to act as the land forces HQ for the newly formed South East Asia Command (SEAC), Admiral Lord Mountbatten, Supreme Commander of SEAC. The commander of 11th Army Group was General George Giffard, who had formerly been Commander-in-Chief West Africa Command and Commander of Eastern Army (part of GHQ India). The headquarters was first situated in New Delhi, eventually moving to Kandy, Ceylon. Its responsibilities were limited to the handling of operations against Japanese forces. GHQ India remained responsible for the rear areas and the training of the Army in India, although there was often overlap between the headquarters&#x27; responsibilities and (in the first year of Eleventh Army Group&#x27;s existence) conflicts between their planners.

The main subordinate formations of 11th Army Group were Fourteenth Army (under General William Slim) and the Ceylon Army Command. The Indian XXXIII Corps, training in Southern India for amphibious operations, also came under Eleventh Army Group for some purposes.

It seemed logical that 11th Army Group should incorporate all Allied land forces, across the whole front in Burma, under a single command structure, including Northern Combat Area Command (NCAC), which was made up mostly of Republic of China Army divisions under General Joseph Stilwell, the most senior officer among US forces in China, Burma and India. Stilwell controlled significant
forces: while NCAC units were to advance from Ledo (India), towards Myitkyina (Burma), to cover the construction of the Ledo Road, Stilwell also commanded the Chinese Expeditionary Force (CEA), which would advance into Burma from the north-east, out of Yunnan. If both of Stilwell&#x27;s commands were placed under the 11th Army Group at the same level as the Fourteenth Army, the attacks could then be co-ordinated at Army Group level. As Stilwell was also Deputy Supreme Commander of SEAC and, technically, already Giffard&#x27;s superior, this would have meant Stilwell relinquishing day-to-day field control of NCAC and CEA forces. However, Stilwell rejected this suggestion; he and Giffard had very different personalities and a poor relationship in general. Slim later commented wryly: &quot;Stilwell ... bitterly resisted... To watch Stilwell ... shift his opposition [to Gifford] from one of ... his numerous Allied, American and Chinese offices, to another was a lesson in mobile offensive-defence.&quot; At a meeting organized by Mountbatten, to solve the problem, Stilwell surprised the others present by agreeing that, while he would direct NCAC and CEA in the field, &quot;I am prepared to come under General Slim&#x27;s operational control until I get to Kamaing&quot;. In effect, Stilwell would both temporarily become Slim&#x27;s deputy and, &quot;de facto&quot;, temporarily vacate his role as Deputy Commander of SEAC. That is, Slim would continue to report to Giffard in regard to Fourteenth Army, but would report directly to Mountbatten in regard to NCAC/CEA. Mountbatten accepted this temporary command structure. 

In practice, Slim found that he was able to work well with Stilwell and &quot;this illogical command set-up worked surprisingly well&quot;. Once Stilwell&#x27;s forces reached Kamaing on 20 May 1944, the arrangement ceased and Stilwell again took orders only from Mountbatten.

==Allied Land Forces South East Asia==

On 12 November 1944, Eleventh Army Group was redesignated Allied Land Forces South East Asia (ALFSEA). General Sir Oliver Leese succeeded Giffard in command. (Mountbatten&#x27;s Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Pownall, had been lobbying for some time for Leese to be appointed, but Leese could not be relieved of command of Eighth Army for several months).

Many of the land command problems in South East Asia had been relieved when General Stilwell was recalled to Washington on 19 October, at the behest of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. His replacement as commander of NCAC and the administrative HQ U.S. Forces, India-Burma Theater (USFIBT) was Lieutenant General Sultan. (Stilwell&#x27;s replacements for his other responsibilities were Lieutenant General Wedemeyer as Chief of Staff to Chiang Kai-shek and General Wheeler as Deputy Supreme Commander, SEAC.)

As part of the reorganisation, NCAC was placed directly under ALFSEA, although they were also subject to directives from Chiang. Indian XV Corps, commanded by Lieutenant General Christison, was removed from command of Fourteenth Army and subordinated directly to ALFSEA. The Corps was responsible for operations in Burma&#x27;s coastal Arakan Province, and had its own separate lines of communication and supply. Fourteenth Army, still under Slim&#x27;s command, was the largest component of ALFSEA, making the main attack into Central Burma.

After the capture of Rangoon in May 1945, British Twelfth Army was formed in Burma, and became part of ALFSEA. Indian XV Corps reverted to the command of Fourteenth Army, which was preparing amphibious operations to recover Malaya. NCAC had previously ceased active operations. Leese was relieved and replaced as commander of ALFSEA by General Slim.

After Japan surrendered in August 1945, ALFSEA was responsible for deploying troops into Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, Thailand and French Indo-China to disarm Japanese forces and repatriate Allied prisoners of war. The headquarters was closed down later in the year.

<text>Quantitative research is a research strategy that focuses on quantifying the collection and analysis of data. It is formed from a deductive approach where emphasis is placed on the testing of theory, shaped by empiricist and positivist philosophies.

Associated with the natural, applied, formal, and social sciences this research strategy promotes the objective empirical investigation of observable phenomena to test and understand relationships. This is done through a range of quantifying methods and techniques, reflecting on its broad utilization as a research strategy across differing academic disciplines.

There are several situations where quantitative research may not be the most appropriate or effective method to use:

1. When exploring in-depth or complex topics.

2. When studying subjective experiences and personal opinions.

3. When conducting exploratory research.

4. When studying sensitive or controversial topics

The objective of quantitative research is to develop and employ mathematical models, theories, and hypotheses pertaining to phenomena. The process of measurement is central to quantitative research because it provides the fundamental connection between empirical observation and mathematical expression of quantitative relationships.

Quantitative data is any data that is in numerical form such as statistics, percentages, etc. The researcher analyses the data with the help of statistics and hopes the numbers will yield an unbiased result that can be generalized to some larger population. Qualitative research, on the other hand, inquires deeply into specific experiences, with the intention of describing and exploring meaning through text, narrative, or visual-based data, by developing themes exclusive to that set of participants.

Quantitative research is widely used in psychology, economics, demography, sociology, marketing, community health, health &amp; human development, gender studies, and political science; and less frequently in anthropology and history. Research in mathematical sciences, such as physics, is also &quot;quantitative&quot; by definition, though this use of the term differs in context. In the social sciences, the term relates to empirical methods originating in both philosophical positivism and the history of statistics, in contrast with qualitative research methods.

Qualitative research produces information only on the particular cases studied, and any more general conclusions are only hypotheses. Quantitative methods can be used to verify which of such hypotheses are true. A comprehensive analysis of 1274 articles published in the top two American sociology journals between 1935 and 2005 found that roughly two-thirds of these articles used quantitative method.

==Overview==
Quantitative research is generally closely affiliated with ideas from &#x27;the scientific method&#x27;, which can include:

* The generation of models, theories and hypotheses
* The development of instruments and methods for measurement
* Experimental control and manipulation of variables
* Collection of empirical data
* Modeling and analysis of data

Quantitative research is often contrasted with qualitative research, which purports to be focused more on discovering underlying meanings and patterns of relationships, including classifications of types of phenomena and entities, in a manner that does not involve mathematical models. Approaches to quantitative psychology were first modeled on quantitative approaches in the physical sciences by Gustav Fechner in his work on psychophysics, which built on the work of Ernst Heinrich Weber. Although a distinction is commonly drawn between qualitative and quantitative aspects of scientific investigation, it has been argued that the two go hand in hand. For example, based on analysis of the history of science, Kuhn concludes that &quot;large amounts of qualitative work have usually been prerequisite to fruitful quantification in the physical sciences&quot;. Qualitative research is often used to gain a general sense of phenomena and to form theories that can be tested using further quantitative research. For instance, in the social sciences qualitative research methods are often used to gain better understanding of such things as intentionality (from the speech response of the researchee) and meaning (why did this person/group say something and what did it mean to them?) (Kieron Yeoman).

Although quantitative investigation of the world has existed since people first began to record events or objects that had been counted, the modern idea of quantitative processes have their roots in Auguste Comte&#x27;s positivist framework. Positivism emphasized the use of the scientific method through observation to empirically test hypotheses explaining and predicting what, where, why, how, and when phenomena occurred. Positivist scholars like Comte believed only scientific methods rather than previous spiritual explanations 
for human behavior could advance.

Quantitative methods are an integral component of the five angles of analysis fostered by the data percolation methodology, which also includes qualitative methods, 
reviews of the literature (including scholarly), interviews with experts and computer simulation, and which forms an extension of data triangulation.

Quantitative methods have limitations. These studies do not provide reasoning behind participants&#x27; responses, they often do not reach underrepresented populations, and they may span long periods in order to collect the data.

==Use of statistics==
Statistics is the most widely used branch of mathematics in quantitative research outside of the physical sciences, and also finds applications within the physical sciences, such as in statistical mechanics. Statistical methods are used extensively within fields such as economics, social sciences and biology. Quantitative research using statistical methods starts with the collection of data, based on the hypothesis or theory. Usually a big sample of data is collected – this would require verification, validation and recording before the analysis can take place. Software packages such as SPSS and R are typically used for this purpose. Causal relationships are studied by manipulating factors thought to influence the phenomena of interest while controlling other variables relevant to the experimental outcomes. In the field of health, for example, researchers might measure and study the relationship between dietary intake and measurable physiological effects such as weight loss, controlling for other key variables such as exercise. Quantitatively based opinion surveys are widely used in the media, with statistics such as the proportion of respondents in favor of a position commonly reported. In opinion surveys, respondents are asked a set of structured questions and their responses are tabulated. In the field of climate science, researchers compile and compare statistics such as temperature or atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide.

Empirical relationships and associations are also frequently studied by using some form of general linear model, non-linear model, or by using factor analysis. A fundamental principle in quantitative research is that correlation does not imply causation, although some such as Clive Granger suggest that a series of correlations can imply a degree of causality. This principle follows from the fact that it is always possible a spurious relationship exists for variables between which covariance is found in some degree. Associations may be examined between any combination of continuous and categorical variables using methods of statistics. Other data analytical approaches for studying causal relations can be performed with Necessary Condition Analysis (NCA), which outlines must-have conditions for the studied outcome variable. 

==Measurement==
Views regarding the role of measurement in quantitative research are somewhat divergent. Measurement is often regarded as being only a means by which observations are expressed numerically in order to investigate causal relations or associations. However, it has been argued that measurement often plays a more important role in quantitative research. For example, Kuhn argued that within quantitative research, the results that are shown can prove to be strange. This is because accepting a theory based on results of quantitative data could prove to be a natural phenomenon. He argued that such abnormalities are interesting when done during the process of obtaining data, as seen below:

:When measurement departs from theory, it is likely to yield mere numbers, and their very neutrality makes them particularly sterile as a source of remedial suggestions. But numbers register the departure from theory with an authority and finesse that no qualitative technique can duplicate, and that departure is often enough to start a search (Kuhn, 1961, p. 180).

In classical physics, the theory and definitions which underpin measurement are generally deterministic in nature. In contrast, probabilistic measurement models known as the Rasch model and Item response theory models are generally employed in the social sciences. Psychometrics is the field of study concerned with the theory and technique for measuring social and psychological attributes and phenomena. This field is central to much quantitative research that is undertaken within the social sciences.

Quantitative research may involve the use of &quot;proxies&quot; as stand-ins for other quantities that cannot be directly measured. Tree-ring width, for example, is considered a reliable proxy of ambient environmental conditions such as the warmth of growing seasons or amount of rainfall. Although scientists cannot directly measure the temperature of past years, tree-ring width and other climate proxies have been used to provide a semi-quantitative record of average temperature in the Northern Hemisphere back to 1000 A.D. When used in this way, the proxy record (tree ring width, say) only reconstructs a certain amount of the variance of the original record. The proxy may be calibrated (for example, during the period of the instrumental record) to determine how much variation is captured, including whether both short and long term variation is revealed. In the case of tree-ring width, different species in different places may show more or less sensitivity to, say, rainfall or temperature: when reconstructing a temperature record there is considerable skill in selecting proxies that are well correlated with the desired variable.

==Relationship with qualitative methods==

In most physical and biological sciences, the use of either quantitative or qualitative methods is uncontroversial, and each is used when appropriate. In the social sciences, particularly in sociology, social anthropology and psychology, the use of one or other type of method can be a matter of controversy and even ideology, with particular schools of thought within each discipline favouring one type of method and pouring scorn on to the other. The majority tendency throughout the history of social science, however, is to use eclectic approaches-by combining both methods. Qualitative methods might be used to understand the meaning of the conclusions produced by quantitative methods. Using quantitative methods, it is possible to give precise and testable expression to qualitative ideas. This combination of quantitative and qualitative data gathering is often referred to as mixed-methods research.

==Examples==
* Research that consists of the percentage amounts of all the elements that make up Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.
* Survey that concludes that the average patient has to wait two hours in the waiting room of a certain doctor before being selected.
* An experiment in which group x was given two tablets of aspirin a day and group y was given two tablets of a placebo a day where each participant is randomly assigned to one or other of the groups. The numerical factors such as two tablets, percent of elements and the time of waiting make the situations and results quantitative.
* In economics, quantitative research is used to analyze business enterprises and the factors contributing to the diversity of organizational structures and the relationships of firms with labour, capital and product markets.

<text>The 15th Army Group was an army group in World War II, composed of the British Eighth Army and initially the Seventh United States Army (1943), replaced by the Fifth United States Army (from January 1944), which apart from units from across the British Empire and United States, also had entire units from other allied countries/regions, including: one corps from Free France and one from Poland; one division from Brazil; multiple separate brigades of Italians and Greeks; plus support to, and from, local Italian partisans. It operated in the Italian Campaign from 1943 to 1945.

The 15th Army Group was activated in 1943 in Algiers, North Africa, to plan the invasion of Sicily, codenamed Operation Husky. Its main forces for this job were the Seventh United States Army, under Lieutenant General George Patton, and the British Eighth Army, under General Bernard Montgomery. Following the capture of Sicily, the army group became responsible for the invasion of mainland Italy for which the U.S. Seventh Army was replaced by the U.S. Fifth Army, under Lieutenant General Mark Clark. In January 1944, the army group was re-designated successively Allied forces in Italy and then Allied Central Mediterranean Force.

In March 1944, the army group was renamed Allied Armies in Italy. Throughout this period, the army group was under command of the British General Sir Harold Alexander. By late 1944, the army group had pushed northward through Italy, capturing Rome, and driving the retreating Axis forces into Northern Italy. Despite and due to the rapid advance of the Allied forces in Italy in June–July 1944, after the liberation of Rome, the high allied command in Western Europe decided to take away from the Italian front the French Expeditionary Corps and the U.S. VI Corps, reassigned for landing in the South of France in support of the advance in the north of that country, and to liberate southern France, including the huge port complexes of Marseilles and Toulon, and bring into action the seven divisions of the French 1st Army (1st and 5th armored, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 9th infantry) that had been reequipped in French North Africa by the United States. The gap in the ranks of the U.S. Fifth Army caused by the withdrawal of seven divisions (three US Army, the 3rd, 36th, and 45th infantry divisions; and four French, the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th divisions) was filled in 1944-45 by five US Army (10th Mountain, 85th, 88th, 91st, and 92nd infantry divisions) and one US-equipped Brazilian Army division (the 1st). Additional replacements and service elements were provided by conversion of the US Army&#x27;s 2nd Cavalry Division, which had arrived in the theater in 1944.

In order to complicate the Allied ambitions in Italy, between October 1944 and March 1945, the available British forces were also weakened by breaking up the 1st Armoured Division because of a lack of replacements for 8th Army&#x27;s casualties, and the withdrawal and deployment to Greece of two British infantry divisions (4th and 46th), the British-controlled 4th Indian Division, the British 23rd Armoured Brigade, the British 2nd Parachute Brigade, and the Greek 3rd Mountain Brigade. In addition, the Canadian I Corps and the British 5th Infantry Division were withdrawn and redeployed to northwestern Europe in Operation Goldflake, to make up for British and Canadian losses in France and Belgium in 1944. The British and Canadian divisions that were withdrawn to shore up 21st Army Group took advantage of the ports in southern France liberated by the US 7th and French 1st armies in Operation Dragoon. The new gaps on the Italian front was filled by four Italian &quot;combat groups,&quot; each equivalent to a &quot;light&quot; (two brigade) division under the British table of organization and equipment, additional US troops (detached from the forces in France or converted from army-level cavalry and anti-aircraft units) and one additional brigade made up largely of infantry recruited in the British Mandate of Palestine.

In December 1944, Alexander was made Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces Headquarters responsible for all military operations in the Mediterranean theatre and Lieutenant General Mark Clark became the new commander and the army group was renamed 15th Army Group once again. After the definitive break up of the Gothic Line, the Axis forces in Italy were finally defeated in the 15th Army Group&#x27;s spring offensive, with Axis forces surrendering on 2 May 1945. On 5 July, 15 Army Group was reorganized and redesignated the U.S. Occupational Forces Austria.

<text>&#x27; (; English: A Song of Love&quot;&quot;&#x27;) is French writer Jean Genet&#x27;s only film, which he directed in 1950. Because of its explicit (though artistically presented) homosexual content, the 26-minute movie was long banned. The film first screened publicly in 1954 with the sexually explicit scenes expurgated.

== Plot ==

The film begins with a hand extended from prison bars, swinging a bouquet of flowers towards, but never reaching another hand extended from adjacent prison bars. The plot is set in a French prison, where a prison guard takes voyeuristic pleasure in observing the prisoners perform masturbatory sexual acts. In two adjacent cells, there is an older Algerian-looking man and a tattooed convict in his twenties. The older man is in love with the younger one, rubbing himself against the wall and sharing his cigarette smoke with his beloved through a straw.

The prison guard, apparently jealous of the prisoners&#x27; relationship, enters the older convict&#x27;s cell and beats him. Following this, the inmate drifts off into a fantasy where he and his object of desire roam the countryside. In the final scene, it becomes clear that the guard&#x27;s power is no match for the intensity of attraction between the prisoners, even though their relationship is not consummated. The prison guard makes the older prisoner suck on his gun in a sexual fashion. The guard therefore becomes a distorted reflection of the prisoners&#x27; love for each other. The film ends with the other hand grasping the flowers and taking the flowers behind his own bars.

Genet does not use dialogue in his film, but focuses instead on close-ups of bodies, on faces, armpits and penises. The film is also rich in symbolism, and the entire narrative may be read as symbolic of the desire for consummation of love between two persons, realised in part through the voyeuristic and sadistic intervention of a third.

 was French writer Jean Genet&#x27;s only film, which he directed. Jean Cocteau was believed to be the film&#x27;s cinematographer.

== Controversy and ban ==
== Critical reception ==
 was described in &quot;The Queer Encyclopedia of Film &amp; Television&quot; as &quot;one of the earliest and most remarkable attempts to portray homosexual passion on-screen&quot;. Fernando F. Croce of &quot;Slant&quot; wrote &quot;A revolutionary vision of emancipation through sensuality, is a song of love both universal and eternal.&quot; Jamie Rich of DVD Talk called it &quot;an effective film, albeit a tad clumsy and pretentious&quot; that is &quot;still a progressive and interesting experiment worth the time one is willing to put into it.&quot; Phil Hall of &quot;Film Threat&quot; was more critical, writing &quot;working in a silent film medium robs Genet of the lyrical language that dominated his artistic genius, and instead he presents a skein of imagery that becomes sillier and sillier as the film progresses. [...] Strictly of curio value, &quot;&quot; can offer contemporary viewers little more than some unintentional gay giggles.&quot;

On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 100% based on reviews from 8 critics.

== Legacy ==
The film has been cited as an influence for many gay filmmakers, including Derek Jarman, Andy Warhol, and Paul Morrissey.

<text>Inowrocław (; , ) is a city in central Poland with a total population of 68,101 (as of December 2022). It is situated in the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship. It is one of the largest and most historically significant cities within the historic region of Kuyavia.

Inowrocław is an industrial town located about southeast of Bydgoszcz known for its saltwater baths and salt mines. The town is the 5th largest agglomeration in its voivodeship, and is a major railway junction, where the west–east line (Poznań–Toruń) crosses the Polish Coal Trunk-Line from Chorzów to Gdynia.

== History ==
The town was first mentioned in 1185 as Novo Wladislaw, possibly in honor of Władysław I Herman or after the settlers from Włocławek. Many inhabitants of Włocławek settled in Inowrocław fleeing flooding. In 1236, the settlement was renamed Juveni Wladislawia. It was incorporated two years later by Casimir Konradowic. In medieval Latin records, the town was recorded as &quot;Juniwladislavia&quot;. As a result of the fragmentation of Poland into smaller duchies, after 1230 Inowrocław was the capital of the Duchy of Kuyavia, and from 1267 to 1364 it was the capital of the Duchy of Inowrocław, before it became part and capital of Poland&#x27;s Inowrocław Voivodeship, which covered northern Kuyavia along with the Dobrzyń Land. The voivodeship later also formed part of the larger Greater Poland Province. Inowrocław was a royal city of the Kingdom of Poland. The town&#x27;s development was aided by the discovery of extensive salt deposits in the vicinity during the 15th century.
It was an important city of late medieval Poland. In 1321, a Polish-Teutonic trial was held in Inowrocław regarding the Teutonic occupation of Gdańsk Pomerania, while the city itself was occupied by the Teutonic Knights from 1332 to 1337. King Casimir III the Great often stayed in the city, and in 1337 he held a meeting with King John of Bohemia in the local castle. A strong garrison was located in the city during the Polish-Teutonic War (1409–1411), and it was the main base of King Władysław II Jagiełło after his victory in the Battle of Grunwald.

Inowrocław was occupied and plundered by Swedish troops during the Deluge in the 1650s, and was annexed to the Kingdom of Prussia in February 1772 during the First Partition of Poland and added to the Netze District. Following the Franco-Prussian Treaty in July 1807, Inowrocław was transferred to the newly created Duchy of Warsaw, which was a client state of the French Empire. The city was a headquarters for Napoleon Bonaparte during his 1812 invasion of Russia. Following the Congress of Vienna in 1815, Inowrocław (as first Inowraclaw and later Inowrazlaw) was transferred back to Prussia as part of the Grand Duchy of Posen. Initially, until 1838 the mayors were still Poles, then Germans. Despite Germanisation attempts, the city was an important center of the Polish resistance during the partitions. It flourished after the establishment of a railway junction in 1872 and a spa in 1875. The city and the region were given the Germanized name &quot;Hohensalza&quot; on December 5, 1904. It was electrified in 1908.

===Interbellum===
After the end of World War I, in November 1918, Poland regained independence and Polish insurgents re-captured the city in January 1919. Restoration to the re-established sovereign Polish state was confirmed in the Treaty of Versailles (which came into effect on January 10, 1920), and the historic name Inowrocław was restored. High unemployment resulting from trade embargoes led to violent confrontations between workers and the police in 1926 and hunger strikes killed 20 in 1930. Inowrocław was part of Poznań Voivodeship until 1925, when it became an independent urban district. This district was briefly assigned to Great Pomerania during the reform of Polish regional administration just before World War II.

===World War II===

Captured by the German 4th Army during the invasion of Poland on September 11, 1939, Inowrocław was again renamed Hohensalza and initially administered under the military district (&quot;Militärbezirk&quot;) of Posen before being incorporated into Nazi Germany first as part of the &quot;Reichsgau&quot; of Posen (1939) and then as part of Reichsgau Wartheland (1939–1945).

The &quot;Einsatzgruppe IV&quot; entered the city on September 12–15, 1939, to commit various atrocities against Poles. Poles arrested during the &quot;Intelligenzaktion&quot; were held in the local prison and in a transit camp, and afterwards mostly murdered in the prison or in the nearby Gniewkowo forest, while some were deported to Nazi concentration camps. In a large massacre, on the night of October 22–23, 1939, the Germans murdered 56 Poles in the prison, including numerous teachers. Families of the victims were expelled, alike local Polish activists and craftsmen, whose workshops were handed over to German colonists in accordance to the Nazi &quot;Lebensraum&quot; policy. In total, the Germans expelled a few thousand Poles from the city, including over 2,900 already in 1939. Several Poles from Inowrocław were also murdered by the Russians in the large Katyn massacre in April–May 1940. Multiple local members of the Home Army, a major Polish resistance organization, were imprisoned and murdered by the Germans in the prison camp in Żabikowo in 1944–1945.

Between 1940 and 1945, Hohensalza was used as a resettlement camp for Poles and an internment camp for Soviet, French and British prisoners of war. Germany also operated a forced labour camp in the city.

===Recent period===
Inowrocław returned to Poland and its original name following the arrival of the Soviet Red Army on January 21, 1945. The last German air raid occurred on April 4, 1945, when a single aircraft dropped four fragmentation bombs and fired on travelers waiting at the Inowrocław train platform. Between 1950 and 1998, the town was part of Bydgoszcz Voivodeship, but the 1999 reforms left it part of Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship.

===Jewish community===
The first recorded instance of Jews in Inowroclaw was in 1447. By the end of the 16th century, there was an established Jewish community with a rabbi. However, by the end of the 16th century, many of these Jews were murdered by Stefan Czarniecki&#x27;s army in 1656. In 1680, John III Sobieski restored the rights of Jews in Inowroclaw that had been lost during the previous siege. By 1765, there were 980 Jews living in Inowroclaw, but in 1774 there was a fire that destroyed many Jewish homes, causing many to flee elsewhere.

The ongoing emancipation of Jews in the 18th and 19th centuries lifted restrictions on Jews. Nevertheless, the Jews of Inowroclaw remained devoted to their traditions. They were increasingly allowed into public life, and Jews were even allowed to run for seats in the Municipal Council. In the 1830s, illiteracy was abolished amongst Jewish boys in Inowroclaw as they were made to take German classes. However, there was a disparity between the young and old Jewish generations as many older Jews were interested in staying true to their traditions and did not want to be Germanized.

A synagogue was created on 9 September 1836. However, in 1908, this synagogue closed and was turned into a beth midrash, house of prayer, and the seat of the community administration. A new synagogue, funded by Leopold Levy, one of the wealthiest Jews in the town, was created in its place.

The community steadily lost its population in second half of the 19th century as many moved to Germany and the United States. In 1921, there were only 252 Jews left in the town.

On 14 September 1939, the Nazis seized Inowroclaw. The synagogue was plundered and set on fire. The next day, the Jews were ordered to stand in the synagogue, where Leopold Levy was executed. Both the old and new Jewish cemeteries were destroyed. The Inowroclaw Jews went through a selection process. The people chosen for extermination were sent to the Inowroclaw prison. In October, they were taken to the forest in Gniekowo and shot dead. By the end of 1940, there were no Jews left in Inowroclaw, with few surviving the war. The few Jews who survived came back to Inowroclaw after the war; however, there was no attempt to re-establish a Jewish community.

<text>Miesbach () is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in Bavaria, Germany. It is bounded by (from the west and clockwise) the districts of Bad Tölz-Wolfratshausen, Munich and Rosenheim, and by the Austrian state of Tyrol.

==History==
In medieval times, most of the district was occupied by clerical states. The Miesbach district today is the union of the areas that were formerly occupied by the Hohenwaldeck county, the territories owned by the powerful Tegernsee Abbey, the territories owned by the Weyarn Abbey and Valley County. Hohenwaldeck was annexed by Bavaria in 1734, Valley in 1777. The clerical states were dissolved in 1803 and fell to Bavaria as well. Miesbach was established in 1803: the foundation ceremony took place in the court district of Hohenwaldeck. In 1818 Tegernsee was established. The same year the Aibling district was established too and Miesbach had to deliver 12 municipalities. In 1939 Tegernsee was merged into Miesbach. During the territorial reform in Bavaria in 1972 Otterfing was merged into Miesbach too and the district Wolfratshausen as well.

==Geography==

The southern half of the district is located in the Bavarian Alps. This section of the Alps is called Mangfall Mountains (&quot;Mangfallgebirge&quot;) as the River Mangfall has its source here. The most important peaks are Rotwand (&quot;Red Wall&quot;, 1,884 m), the highest mountain in the area, and Wendelstein (1,838 m) .

The river Mangfall, a short but broad affluent of the river Inn, flows northward with the district&#x27;s municipalities on either bank. In the initial part of its course it runs through Tegernsee Lake (9 km2).

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms displays:
* a red eagle and two crossed staves, symbolising the county of Hohenwaldeck
* two water lily leaves above a wavy line, the ancient arms of the monastery of Tegernsee

<doc id="389571" wikidata="Q214026" url="?curid=389571" title="21st Army Group">
<text>The 21st Army Group was a British headquarters formation formed during the Second World War. It controlled two field armies and other supporting units, consisting primarily of the British Second Army and the First Canadian Army. Established in London during July 1943, under the command of Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF), it was assigned to Operation Overlord, the Western Allied invasion of Europe, and was an important Allied force in the European Theatre. At various times during its existence, the 21st Army Group had additional British, Canadian, American, and Polish field armies or corps attached to it. The 21st Army Group operated in Northern France, Luxembourg, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany from June 1944 until August 1945, when it was renamed the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR).

==Western European theatre==
===Normandy===
Commanded by General (later Field Marshal) Sir Bernard Montgomery, 21st Army Group initially controlled all ground forces in Operation Overlord (the United States First Army and British Second Army). When sufficient American forces had landed, their own 12th Army Group was activated, under General Omar Bradley, and the 21st Army Group was left with the British Second Army and the newly activated First Canadian Army which, despite its title, also contained many British and Polish troops.

Normandy was a battle of attrition for the British and Canadian troops, drawing in most of the available German reinforcements, especially armoured divisions, around Caen at the eastern end of the lodgement. These operations left the Germans unable to prevent the American breakout at the western end of the Normandy beachhead in early August 1944. Following the German attack towards Mortain, the American breakout and an advance by the 21st Army Group the German armed forces in Normandy were nearly enveloped in the Falaise pocket, and subsequently routed, retreating towards the Low Countries.

===Advance into the Low Countries===
After the successful landings in the south of France by the US 6th Army Group, the 21st Army Group formed the left flank of the three Allied army groups arrayed against German forces in the West. It was therefore responsible for securing the ports upon which Allied supply depended, and also with overrunning German V-1 and V-2 launching sites along the coasts of western France and Belgium.

By 29 August, the Germans had largely withdrawn across the Seine River without their heavy equipment. The campaign through Northern France and Belgium was largely a pursuit, with the ports – formally designated &quot;Fortress Towns&quot; by the Germans – offering only limited opposition to the First Canadian Army. The advance was so rapid, 250 miles in four days, that Antwerp, Belgium, was captured undefended on 4 September 1944 and the port facilities were cleared of the German defenders in the following days.

On 1 September 1944, the 21st Army Group was relieved of operational control of the American armies, and those armies formed the 12th Army Group.

By mid-September, elements of 21st Army Group had reached the Dutch border, but were halted due to lack of supplies, and by flooding caused by the widespread German demolition of Dutch dikes. German control of some of the channel ports and the approaches to Antwerp, and previous Allied bombing of the French and Belgian railways, resulted in a long supply line from Normandy served mainly by trucks.

===Operation Market Garden===
After the break-out from Normandy, there were high hopes that the war could be ended in 1944. In order to do so, the last great natural defensive barrier of Germany in the west, the Rhine River had to be crossed. Operation Market Garden was orchestrated to attempt just this. It was staged in the Netherlands with the airborne troops of the American 82nd and 101st and one British 1st airborne divisions and the 1st Polish Parachute Brigade (attached to the 1st Airborne Division) being dropped to capture bridges over the lower Rhine before they could be blown by the Germans. The airborne formations were then to be relieved by armoured forces of the Guards Armoured Division advancing rapidly northwards through Eindhoven and Nijmegen to Arnhem, opening the north German plains, and the industrial Ruhr Valley, to the Allies.

However, the British armoured forces had only one main highway to operate on, and crucial information about the German forces in the operational area was either missing or ignored. The scratch forces remaining after the retreat from France were much stronger than expected, thus giving the armoured units of the XXX Corps a much tougher fight than had been anticipated, slowing the advance. The 1st British Airborne Division in Arnhem was practically destroyed during the battle.

The advance stopped south of the Lower Rhine, resulting in a narrow salient that ran from the north of Belgium across the south-east of the Netherlands and was vulnerable to attack. German assaults in this salient, particularly north of Nijmegen were repelled.

The thin salient was then expanded Eastwards with Operation Aintree which saw bitter fighting around the town of Overloon. To the West Operation Pheasant was conducted which resulted in the liberation of the cities of Tilburg and &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch broadening the front line.

===Battle of the Scheldt===
Since the approaches to the port of Antwerp had not been cleared when the city was captured it had allowed the German army time to reorganise and dig in along the approaches making the port completely unusable.
Thus an operation was needed to clear the approaches and thereby ease the supply problem. The island of Walcheren was strongly held by German forces and commanded the estuary of the Scheldt which flows through Antwerp. Operations by II Canadian Corps cleared the approaches to Antwerp both north and south of the water during the Battle of the Scheldt. Walcheren itself was captured in late 1944 by the last major amphibious assault in Europe in the Second World War. A combination of British and Canadian forces and Royal Marines undertook the operation.

===Battle of the Bulge===
After the capture of Walcheren came the last great German offensive of the war in the west. In a repeat of their 1940 attack, German formations smashed through weak Allied lines in the Ardennes in Belgium. The Battle of the Bulge presented a command problem to General Eisenhower. It had sliced through US lines, leaving some American formations north and south of the new German salient. However, the headquarters of the US 12th Army Group lay to the south, and so Eisenhower decided to place American forces north of the &quot;Bulge&quot; salient under 21st Army Group. They, with the US Third Army under General George S. Patton, reduced the salient.

After the battle, control of the First US Army which had been placed under Field Marshal Montgomery&#x27;s temporary command was returned to Bradley&#x27;s 12th Army Group. The US Ninth Army remained under Montgomery longer, before being returned to American command in Germany.

===Battle for the Roer Triangle===
Prior to the Rhineland Campaign the enemy had to be cleared from the Roer Triangle during Operation Blackcock. This large methodical mopping up operation took place between 14 and 27 January 1945. It was not planned to make any deep thrust into the enemy defences or capture large numbers of prisoners. It proceeded from stage to stage almost entirely as planned and was completed with minimal casualties.

===Rhineland Campaign===
Allied forces closed up to the Rhine by March 1945. 21st Army Group at this time comprised the British Second Army under General Miles Dempsey, the First Canadian Army under General Harry Crerar and the US Ninth Army, under General William Simpson.

The First Canadian Army executed Operation Veritable in difficult conditions from Nijmegen eastwards through the Reichswald Forest then southwards. This was to have been the northern part of a pincer movement with the US Ninth Army moving northwards towards Düsseldorf and Krefeld (Operation Grenade), to clear the west bank of the Rhine north of Cologne. However the Americans were delayed by two weeks when the Germans destroyed the Roer dams and flooded the American route of advance. As a result, the Canadians engaged and mauled the German reserves intended to defend the Cologne Plain.

In Operation Plunder, starting on 13 March 1945, the British Second Army and the US Ninth Army crossed the Rhine at various places north of the Ruhr and German resistance in the west quickly crumbled. The First Canadian Army wheeled left and liberated the northern part of the Netherlands and captured adjoining areas of Germany, the British Second Army occupied much of north-west Germany and the US Ninth Army formed the northern arm of the envelopment of German forces in the Ruhr Pocket and on 4 April reverted to Omar Bradley&#x27;s 12th Army Group.

On 4 May 1945, Field Marshal Montgomery accepted the unconditional surrender of the German forces in the Netherlands, in north west Germany and Denmark.

==British Army of the Rhine==
After the German surrender, 21st Army Group was converted into the headquarters for the British occupation zone in Germany. It was renamed the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR) on 25 August 1945 and eventually formed the nucleus of the British forces stationed in Germany throughout the Cold War.

==Order of battle==
The main constituent formations of 21st Army Group were the First Canadian Army and the British Second Army. In practice, neither of the two armies were homogeneously British or Canadian. Also included was the Polish I Corps, from Normandy onwards and small Dutch, Belgian, and Czechoslovak units; units of the US Army were attached from time to time.

<text>Świecie (; ) is a town in northern Poland with 24,841 inhabitants (2023), capital of Świecie County in the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship. It is located within the ethnocultural region of Kociewie.

== Location ==
Świecie is located on the west bank of river Vistula at the mouth of river Wda, approximately north-east of Bydgoszcz, 105 kilometers south of Gdańsk and 190 kilometers south-west of Kaliningrad.

==History==

A fishermen&#x27;s village existed at the site of the present-day town in the Early Middle Ages. The area became part of the emerging Polish state in the 10th century. The name of the town comes from the Polish word &quot;świecić&quot;, which means &quot;to shine&quot;. During the period of the fragmentation of Poland, Świecie became the residence of Pomeranian Duke Grzymisław. Grzymisław&#x27;s duchy included part of Gdańsk Pomerania with prominent towns of Starogard Gdański and Lubiszewo Tczewskie, as well as Skarszewy.

The Teutonic Order conquered Gdańsk in 1309 and in 1310 bought the region in Soldin from the Margraves of Brandenburg, who claimed the region, which however legally formed part of Poland. By then, the settlement already had the status of &quot;Civitas&quot;, just as Gdańsk and Tczew did. Świecie was granted a municipal form of government by the Teutonic Order, when it was still located on the high west bank of the Vistula. Probably because of destruction by fire, during the period 1338–1375 the town was relocated down into the valley at the Vistula. The town was briefly recaptured by the Poles after their victory in the Battle of Grunwald in 1410.

In 1454, in the beginning stages of the Thirteen Years&#x27; War, it was captured by the Prussian Confederation, which opposed Teutonic rule, and upon the request of which King Casimir IV Jagiellon re-incorporated the territory to the Kingdom of Poland that same year. The Teutonic Knights renounced any claims to the town, and recognized it as part of Poland in 1466. Administratively it formed part of the Pomeranian Voivodeship in the province of Royal Prussia in the Greater Poland Province. The town prospered due to its location at the intersection of the Amber Road and the trade route connecting Western Pomerania with Warmia, Masuria and Lithuania. In the 17th century, Świecie suffered as a result of the Swedish invasion of Poland and an epidemic.

In 1772, during the First Partition of Poland, the town was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia, and as &quot;Schwetz&quot; was integrated into the newly formed Province of West Prussia. In 1871, it also became part of Germany. The economic development was decisively improved by the connection to the railway network in 1888. In 1905, the town had a Protestant church, two Catholic churches and a synagogue. In 1910, Schwetz had a population of 8,042, of which 4,206 (52.3%) were German-speaking, 3,605 (44.8%) were Polish-speaking and 166 (2.1%) were bilingual in German and another language.

After World War I and the restoration of independent Poland, Świecie was restored by Germany to Poland in 1920 according to the Treaty of Versailles and became part of the Pomeranian Voivodeship of the Second Polish Republic. In 1920, Stanisław Kostka, a distinguished Polish activist who was active in Grudziądz and Świecie under Prussian rule, became the mayor of the town. Stanisław Kostka built new flood embankments that protect Świecie from floods to this day, and under his administration the town developed economically and culturally.
During the Second World War, Nazi Germany occupied Świecie and annexed it on 8 October 1939, making it the seat of the &quot;Kreis&quot; county of Schwetz. It was administered as part of the Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia. Prominent Poles were arrested using secret politically targeted hit list and murdered using the &quot;Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz&quot; paramilitaries. Local Poles were murdered in large massacres in Świecie, Grupa and Mniszek.

The Germans also murdered the staff and 1,350 patients of the local psychiatric hospital in large massacres in the Szpęgawski and Luszkówko forests. Local Poles were also subjected to expulsions.

The town was captured by combined Polish and Soviet forces on February 10, 1945, and restored to Poland, where it became part of the Bydgoszcz Voivodeship formed in 1946 in the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland. An internment camp was operation for Germans of the region, who could be selected for forced labor each morning by the Polish; many Germans died. The camp was dissolved in March, some Germans were sent to Germany, some were sent to the Central Labour Camp in Potulice.

The town grew rapidly with population reaching 13,500 by 1961. Sugar refinery was expanded, meat, cattle feed plants, and mills were built, including the paper factory launched in 1968, with 4,600 employees. In 1988 Świecie was awarded with the Officer&#x27;s Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta, one of Poland&#x27;s highest state orders.

<text>Nakło nad Notecią ( ) is a town in north-central Poland on the river Noteć with 23,687 inhabitants (2007). It is the seat of Nakło County, and also of Gmina Nakło nad Notecią, situated in the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship. It is located in the ethnocultural region of Krajna.

== History ==

Nakło began to develop as a Pomeranian settlement by the middle of the 10th century. It was initially called &quot;Nakieł&quot;, and its name comes from the Old Polish word &quot;nakieł&quot;. The name morphed into &quot;Nakło&quot; in the 16th century. The town was first mentioned in 11th-century documents. Between 1109 and 1113 it fell to Duke Bolesław III Wrymouth of Poland. It received Magdeburg town rights in 1299. It was a royal town of the Polish Crown and a county seat located in the Kalisz Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province.

Nakło was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia during the First Partition of Poland in 1772 and known by the German name &quot;Nakel&quot;. It began to develop significantly after the completion of the Bydgoszcz Canal, which connected the Vistula with the Noteć, Warta, and Oder rivers. After the defeat of Prussia in the Napoleonic War of the Fourth Coalition, Nakło became part of the Duchy of Warsaw in 1807. After the defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1815, it was restored to Prussia in the Congress of Vienna as part of the autonomous Grand Duchy of Posen. One of the main escape routes for surviving insurgents of the Polish November Uprising from partitioned Poland to the Great Emigration led through the town.

During the course of 19th-century industrialization, Nakło developed further after being connected with the Prussian Eastern Railway in 1851. It became part of the Prussian-led German Empire in 1871. After World War I, in 1918, Poland regained independence and many inhabitants joined the Greater Poland uprising (1918–19) in aim to reintegrate the town with the reborn state. The town was captured by Polish insurgents on 1 January 1919, however, they were forced to withdraw in accordance to a Polish-German truce. The Germans then brought reinforcements to the town. In June 1919, American and British journalists visited the town, and the Germans tried to keep Poles away from the journalists. Local Polish craftsman Antoni Nadskakuła shouted a pro-Polish and pro-Allied slogan to the journalists, and was later lynched by the Germans in revenge, and his workshop was destroyed. The town was eventually restored to the Second Polish Republic according to the Treaty of Versailles. Within interwar Poland, it was administratively located in the Pomeranian Voivodeship.
During the invasion of Poland, which started World War II, the German army invaded the town on 3 September 1939, and afterwards it was occupied by Nazi Germany until January 1945. The German gendarmerie and the &quot;Selbstschutz&quot; carried out mass arrests of Poles in October and November 1939, and a prison for Poles was established in the local gymnasium. Many Poles from Nakło, including teachers, craftsmen, merchants and children, were murdered in large massacres in the nearby village of Paterek. In November 1939, the commander of the &quot;SD-EK 16&quot; declared that all Polish intelligentsia capable of resistance had been eliminated. Many Polish families expelled by the Germans from the region were deported to Nakło and then marched from the town to the nearby Potulice concentration camp. 73 Poles from the Nakło County, including 20 policemen, were also murdered by the Russians in the large Katyn massacre in April–May 1940. In August 1944, the Germans brought around 300 Polish forced labourers aged 15–50 from the Wyrzysk area to the town, and then deported them to a newly established forced labour camp in Jajkowo.

The town was administratively part of the Bydgoszcz Voivodeship from 1975 to 1998.

<doc id="389578" wikidata="Q15262992" url="?curid=389578" title="Twelve Days of Christmas">
<text>The Twelve Days of Christmas, also known as the Twelve Days of Christmastide, are the festive Christian season celebrating the Nativity.

Christmas Day is the First Day. The Twelve Days are 25 December to 5 January, counting first and last. The Octave, or Eighth Day, is New Year&#x27;s Day and the Feast of the Circumcision, the day Jesus was circumcised in accordance with the Jewish faith. The evening of the last day of the Twelve Days of Christmastide is Twelfth Night or Epiphany Eve, with the next morning being Epiphany, which commences the season of Epiphanytide in certain traditions.

For Christian denominations such as the Anglican Communion or the Lutheran Church, the Twelve Days are identical to Christmastide (December 25 through January 5). For the Roman Catholic Church, however, Christmastide lasts longer, running through the Feast of the Baptism of the Lord. For some, the Twelve Days are considered December 26 to January 6, thus including Epiphany.

==History==

In 567, the Council of Tours &quot;proclaimed the twelve days from Christmas to Epiphany (that is, through the end of 5 January, as Epiphany begins the following day) as a sacred and festive season, and established the duty of Advent fasting in preparation for the feast.&quot; Christopher Hill, as well as William J. Federer, states that this was done in order to solve the &quot;administrative problem for the Roman Empire as it tried to coordinate the solar Julian calendar with the lunar calendars of its provinces in the east.&quot;

==Eastern Christianity==
The Armenian Apostolic Church and Armenian Catholic Church celebrate the Birth and Baptism of Christ on the same day, so that there is no distinction between a feast of Christmas and a feast of Epiphany.

The Oriental Orthodox (other than the Armenians), the Eastern Orthodox, and the Eastern Lutherans and Eastern Catholics both of whom follow the same traditions have a twelve-day interval between the two feasts. Christmas and Epiphany are celebrated by these churches on 25 December and 6 January of the Julian calendar, which correspond to 7 and 19 January on the Gregorian calendar. The Twelve Days, using the Gregorian calendar, end at sunset on 18 January.

===Eastern Orthodoxy===
For the Eastern Orthodox, both Christmas and Epiphany are among the Twelve Great Feasts that are only second to Easter in importance.

The period between Christmas and Epiphany is fast-free. During this period one celebration leads into another. The Nativity of Christ is a three-day celebration: the formal title of the first day (i.e. Christmas Eve) is &quot;The Nativity According to the Flesh of our Lord, God and Saviour Jesus Christ&quot;, and celebrates not only the Nativity of Jesus, but also the Adoration of the Shepherds of Bethlehem and the arrival of the Magi; the second day is referred to as the &quot;Synaxis of the Theotokos&quot;, and commemorates the role of the Virgin Mary in the Incarnation; the third day is known as the &quot;Third Day of the Nativity&quot;, and is also the feast day of the Protodeacon and Protomartyr Saint Stephen. 29 December is the Orthodox Feast of the Holy Innocents. The Afterfeast of the Nativity (similar to the Western octave) continues until 31 December (that day is known as the Apodosis or &quot;leave-taking&quot; of the Nativity).

The Saturday following the Nativity is commemorated by special readings from the Epistle () and Gospel () during the Divine Liturgy. The Sunday after the Nativity has its own liturgical commemoration in honour of &quot;The Righteous Ones: Joseph the Betrothed, David the King and James the Brother of the Lord&quot;.

Another of the more prominent festivals that are included among the Twelve Great Feasts is that of the Circumcision of Christ on 1 January. On this same day is the feast day of Saint Basil the Great, and so the service celebrated on that day is the Divine Liturgy of Saint Basil.

On 2 January begins the Forefeast of the Theophany. The Eve of the Theophany on 5 January is a day of strict fasting, on which the devout will not eat anything until the first star is seen at night. This day is known as Paramony (Greek Παραμονή &quot;Eve&quot;), and follows the same general outline as Christmas Eve. That morning is the celebration of the Royal Hours and then the Divine Liturgy of Saint Basil combined with Vespers, at the conclusion of which is celebrated the Great Blessing of Waters, in commemoration of the Baptism of Jesus in the Jordan River. There are certain parallels between the hymns chanted on Paramony and those of Good Friday, to show that, according to Orthodox theology, the steps that Jesus took into the Jordan River were the first steps on the way to the Cross. That night the All-Night Vigil is served for the Feast of the Theophany.

==Western Christianity==
Within the Twelve Days of Christmas, there are celebrations both secular and religious.

Christmas Day, counted as the first day of Christmastide in Catholicism, Lutheranism and Anglicanism, is celebrated by Christians as the liturgical feast of the Nativity of the Lord. It is a public holiday in many nations, including some such as India where the majority of the population is not Christian. On this see the articles on &quot;Christmas&quot; and &quot;Christmas traditions&quot;.

26 December is &quot;Saint Stephen&#x27;s Day&quot;, a feast day in the Western Church. In the United Kingdom and its former colonies, it is also the secular holiday of Boxing Day. In some parts of Ireland it is denominated &quot;Wren Day&quot;.

27 December is the Feast of Saint John the Evangelist, while the 28 December is Childermass or the Feast of the Holy Innocents, in observance of the Massacre of the Innocents of the Nativity narrative, in which Herod the Great, king of Judea, orders the execution of all male children who are two years old and under in the vicinity of Bethlehem.

New Year&#x27;s Eve (31 December) is the feast of Pope St. Sylvester I and is known also as &quot;Silvester&quot;. The transition that evening to the new year is an occasion for secular festivities in many nations, and in several languages is known as &quot;St. Sylvester Night&quot; (&quot; in Italian, &quot; in German, &quot; in French, and &quot; in Hebrew). Several Christian traditions, such as Catholic, Lutheran, Anglican, Methodist, and Moravian churches, offer various forms of Watchnight services, where the congregants are encouraged to review the year passed and pray for the year to come, often in connection with the celebration of Mass or the Lord&#x27;s Supper.

New Year&#x27;s Day (1 January) is an occasion for further secular festivities or for rest from the celebrations of the night before. In the Roman Rite of the Roman Catholic Church, it is the Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God, liturgically celebrated on the Octave Day of Christmas. It has also been celebrated, and still is in some denominations (such as Lutheranism and Anglicanism), as the Feast of the Circumcision of Christ, because according to Jewish tradition He would have been circumcised on the eighth day after His Birth, inclusively counting the first day and last day. This day, or someday proximate to it, is also celebrated by the Roman Catholics as World Day of Peace.

In many nations, e. g., the United States, the Solemnity of Epiphany is transferred to the first Sunday after 1 January, which can occur as early as 2 January. That solemnity, then, together with customary observances associated with it, usually occur within the Twelve Days of Christmas, even if these are considered to end on 5 January rather than 6 January.

Other Roman Catholic liturgical feasts on the General Roman Calendar that occur within the Octave of Christmas and therefore also within the Twelve Days of Christmas are the Feast of St. John, Apostle and Evangelist on 27 December; the Feast of the Holy Innocents on 28 December; Memorial of St. Thomas Becket, Bishop and Martyr on 29 December; and the Feast of the Holy Family of Jesus, Mary, and Joseph on the Sunday within the Octave of Christmas or, if there is no such Sunday, on 30 December. Outside the Octave, but within the Twelve Days of Christmas, there are the feasts of Sts. Basil the Great and Gregory of Nazianzus on 2 January and the Memorial of the Holy Name of Jesus on 3 January.

Other saints are celebrated at a local level.

===Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages===
The Second Council of Tours of 567 noted that, in the area for which its bishops were responsible, the days between Christmas and Epiphany were, like the month of August, taken up entirely with saints&#x27; days. Monks were therefore in principle not bound to fast on those days. However, the first three days of the year were to be days of prayer and penance so that faithful Christians would refrain from participating in the idolatrous practices and debauchery associated with the new year celebrations. The Fourth Council of Toledo (633) ordered a strict fast on those days, on the model of the Lenten fast.

===England in the Middle Ages===

In England in the Middle Ages, this period was one of continuous feasting and merrymaking, which climaxed on Twelfth Night, the traditional end of the Christmas season on 5 January (the last night before Epiphany which started 6 January). William Shakespeare used it as the setting for one of his most famous stage plays, &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;. Often a Lord of Misrule was chosen to lead the Christmas revels.

Some of these traditions were adapted from the older pagan customs, including the Roman Saturnalia and the Germanic Yuletide. Some also have an echo in modern-day pantomime where traditionally authority is mocked and the principal male lead is played by a woman, while the leading older female character, or &#x27;Dame&#x27;, is played by a man.

===Colonial North America===

Some early English colonists brought their version of the Twelve Days with them to North America, and adapted them to their new country, adding their own variations over the years. In New England, however, both the Pilgrims in Plymouth Colony and the Puritans in Massachusetts Bay frowned upon the observance of Christmas. As early as Christmas Day in 1621, Governor William Bradford &quot;encounterd a group of people who were taking the day off from work, and he promptly sent them back to work.&quot; Nissenbaum further notes that &quot;[what] bothered the governor was that these Christmas-keepers were, in his own words, out &#x27;gaming [and] reveling in the streets.&quot;
One tradition, the modern-day Christmas wreath, may have originated with these colonials. A homemade wreath would be fashioned from local greenery, and fruits, if available, were added. Making the wreaths was one of the traditions of Christmas Eve; they would remain hung on each home&#x27;s front door beginning on Christmas Night (first night of Christmas) through Twelfth Night or Epiphany morning. As was already the tradition in their native England, all decorations would be taken down by Epiphany morning and the remainder of the edibles would be consumed. A special cake, the king cake, was also baked then for Epiphany.

==Modern Western customs==
===United Kingdom and Commonwealth===
Many in the UK and other Commonwealth nations still celebrate some aspects of the Twelve Days of Christmas. Boxing Day, 26 December, is a national holiday in many Commonwealth nations. Victorian era stories by Charles Dickens, and others, particularly &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, hold key elements of the celebrations such as the consumption of plum pudding, roasted goose and wassail. These foods are consumed more at the beginning of the Twelve Days in the UK.

In the Western Christian world, the two traditional days when Christmas decorations are removed are Twelfth Night and if they are not taken down on that day, Candlemas, the latter of which ends the Christmas-Epiphany season in some denominations. Taking down Christmas decorations before Twelfth Night, as well as leaving the decorations up beyond Candlemas, is historically considered to be inauspicious. In Germany, Christmas decorations are traditionally removed on Candlemas Day.

===United States===

In the United States, Christmas Day is a federal holiday which holds additional religious significance for Christians.

The traditions of the Twelve Days of Christmas have been nearly forgotten in the United States. Contributing factors include the popularity of the stories of Charles Dickens in nineteenth-century America, with their emphasis on generous giving; introduction of secular traditions in the 19th and 20th centuries, e. g., the American Santa Claus; and increase in the popularity of secular New Year&#x27;s Eve parties. Presently, the commercial practice treats the Solemnity of Christmas, 25 December, the first day of Christmas, as the last day of the &quot;Christmas&quot; marketing season, as the numerous &quot;after-Christmas sales&quot; that commence on 26 December demonstrate. The commercial calendar has encouraged an erroneous assumption that the Twelve Days &quot;end&quot; on Christmas Day and must therefore begin on 14 December.

Many American Christians still celebrate the traditional liturgical seasons of Advent and Christmas, especially Amish, Anglo-Catholics, Episcopalians, Lutherans, Mennonites, Methodists, Moravians, Nazarenes, Orthodox Christians, Presbyterians, and Roman Catholics. In Anglicanism, the designation of the &quot;Twelve Days of Christmas&quot; is used liturgically in the Episcopal Church in the US, having its own invitatory antiphon in the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; for Matins.

Christians who celebrate the Twelve Days may give gifts on each of them, with each of the Twelve Days representing a wish for a corresponding month of the new year. They may feast on traditional foods and otherwise celebrate the entire time through the morning of the Solemnity of Epiphany. Contemporary traditions include lighting a candle for each day, singing the verse of the corresponding day from the famous &quot;The Twelve Days of Christmas&quot;, and lighting a yule log on Christmas Eve and letting it burn some more on each of the twelve nights. For some, the Twelfth Night remains the night of the most festive parties and exchanges of gifts. Some households exchange gifts on the first (25 December) and last (5 January) days of the Twelve Days.

<text>Cognitive neuropsychology is a branch of cognitive psychology that aims to understand how the structure and function of the brain relates to specific psychological processes. Cognitive psychology is the science that looks at how mental processes are responsible for the cognitive abilities to store and produce new memories, produce language, recognize people and objects, as well as our ability to reason and problem solve. Cognitive neuropsychology places a particular emphasis on studying the cognitive effects of brain injury or neurological illness with a view to inferring models of normal cognitive functioning. Evidence is based on case studies of individual brain damaged patients who show deficits in brain areas and from patients who exhibit double dissociations. Double dissociations involve two patients and two tasks. One patient is impaired at one task but normal on the other, while the other patient is normal on the first task and impaired on the other. For example, patient A would be poor at reading printed words while still being normal at understanding spoken words, while the patient B would be normal at understanding written words and be poor at understanding spoken words. Scientists can interpret this information to explain how there is a single cognitive module for word comprehension. From studies like these, researchers infer that different areas of the brain are highly specialised. Cognitive neuropsychology can be distinguished from cognitive neuroscience, which is also interested in brain-damaged patients, but is particularly focused on uncovering the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive processes.

==History==
Cognitive neuropsychology has its roots in the diagram-making approach to language disorder that started in the second half of the 19th century. The discovery that aphasia takes different forms depending on the location of brain damage provided a powerful framework for understanding brain function.

In 1861, Paul Broca reported a post mortem study of an aphasic patient who was speechless apart from a single nonsense word: &quot;Tan&quot;. Broca showed that an area of the left frontal lobe was damaged. As Tan was unable to produce speech but could still understand it, Broca argued that this area might be specialised for speech production and that language skills might be localized to this cortical area. Broca did a similar study on another patient, Lelong, a few weeks later. Lelong, like Tan, could understand speech but could only repeat the same five words. After examining his brain, Broca noticed that Lelong had a lesion in approximately the same area as his patient Tan. He also noticed that in the more than 25 patients he examined with aphasia, they all had lesions to the left frontal lobe but there was no damage to the right hemisphere of the brain. From this he concluded that the function of speech was probably localized in the inferior frontal gyrus of the left hemisphere of the brain, an area now known as Broca&#x27;s area.

Karl Wernicke subsequently reported patients with damage further back in the temporal lobe who could speak but were unable to understand what was said to them, providing evidence for two potentially interconnected language centres. These clinical descriptions were integrated into a theory of language organisation by Lichtheim. Subsequently, these models were used and developed to inform Dejerine&#x27;s account of reading, Liepmann&#x27;s theory of action and Lissauer&#x27;s 1890 account of object recognition and Lewandowsky and Stadelmann&#x27;s 1908 account of calculation.

However, the early 20th century saw a reaction to the overly-precise accounts of the diagram-making neurologists. Pierre Marie challenged conclusions against previous evidence of Broca&#x27;s areas in 1906 and Henry Head attacked the whole field of cerebral localisation 1926.

The modern science of cognitive neuropsychology emerged during the 1960s stimulated by the insights of the neurologist Norman Geschwind who demonstrated that the insights of Broca and Wernicke were still clinically relevant. The other stimulus to the discipline was the cognitive revolution and the growing science of cognitive psychology which had emerged as a reaction to behaviorism in the mid-20th century.
Psychologists in the mid-1950s acknowledged that the structure of mental information-processing systems could be investigated in scientifically acceptable ways. They developed and applied new cognitive processing models to explain experimental data from not only studies of speech and language but also those of selective attention. Cognitive psychologists and clinical neuropsychologists developed more research collaborations to gain a better understanding of these disorders. The rebirth of neuropsychology was marked by the publishing of two seminal collaborative papers from Marshall &amp; Newcombe (1966) on reading and Warrington &amp; Shallice (1969) on memory. Subsequently, work by pioneers such as Elizabeth Warrington, Brenda Milner, Tim Shallice, Alan Baddeley and Lawrence Weiskrantz demonstrated that neurological patients were an important source of data for cognitive psychologists.

It took less than one decade for neuropsychology to be fully re-established. More achievements in neuropsychology were recognized: the establishment of the first major book discussing neuropsychology using a cognitive approach, &quot;Deep Dyslexia&quot;, in 1980 after a scientific meeting about the topic in Oxford in 1977, the birth of the &quot;Cognitive Neuropsychology&quot; journal in 1984, and the publishing of the first textbook of neuropsychology, &quot;Human Cognitive Neuropsychology&quot; in 1988.

A particular area of interest was memory. Patients with amnesia caused by injuries to the hippocampus in the temporal cortex and midbrain areas (especially the mamillary bodies) were of early interest. A patient with severe case of amnesia will not be able to remember meeting the examiner if they leave the room and return, let alone events of the previous day (episodic memory), but they will still be able to learn how to tie their shoes (procedural memory), remember a series of numbers for a few seconds (short-term memory or working memory) and be able to recall historical events they have learned in school (semantic memory). By contrast, patients may lose their short-term memory abilities while retaining their long term memory functions. Many other studies like this have been done in the field of neuropsychology examining lesions and the effect they have on certain areas of the brain and their functions.
Studies on the amnesic patient Henry Molaison, formerly known as patient H.M., are commonly cited as some of the precursors, if not the beginning of modern cognitive neuropsychology. Molaison had parts of his medial temporal lobes surgically removed to treat intractable epilepsy in 1953. Much of the hippocampus was also removed along with the medial temporal lobes. The treatment proved successful in reducing his dangerous seizures, but left him with a profound but selective amnesia. After the surgery, Molaison was able to remember some big events from before the surgery, such as the stock market crash in 1929, but was confused about many others and could no longer form new memories. This accidental experiment showed scientists how the brain processes different types of memory. Because Molaison&#x27;s impairment was caused by surgery, the damaged parts of his brain were known, information which was usually not knowable in a time before accurate neuroimaging became widespread. Scientists concluded that while the hippocampus is needed in the creation of new memories, it is not needed in the retrieval of old ones; they are two separate processes. They also realized that the hippocampus and the medial temporal lobes, both of the areas removed from Molaison, are the areas responsible for converting short-term memory to long-term memory.

Much of the early work of cognitive neuropsychology was carried out with limited reference to the detailed localisation of brain pathology. Neuroimaging was relatively imprecise and other anatomically based techniques were also limited. The emphasis of many researchers as late as 1990 was on the analysis of patterns of cognitive deficit rather than on where the injury was located. Despite the lack of detailed anatomical data, studies of reading, language and memory had a number of important implications. The first is that certain cognitive processes (such as language) could be damaged separately from others, and so might be handled by distinct and independent cognitive (and neural) processes. (For more on the cognitive neuropsychological approach to language, see Eleanor Saffran, among others.) The second is that such processes might be localized to specific areas of the brain. Whilst both of these claims are still controversial to some degree, the influence led to a focus on brain injury as a potentially fruitful way of understanding the relationship between psychology and neuroscience.

==Methods==
A key approach within cognitive neuropsychology has been to use single case studies and dissociation as a means of testing theories of cognitive function. For example, if a theory states that reading and writing are simply different skills stemming from a single cognitive process, it should not be possible to find a person who, after brain injury, can write but not read or read but not write. This selective breakdown in skills suggests that different parts of the brain are specialized for the different processes and so the cognitive systems are separable.

The philosopher Jerry Fodor has been particularly influential in cognitive neuropsychology, particularly with the idea that the mind, or at least certain parts of it, may be organised into independent modules. Evidence that cognitive skills may be damaged independently seem to support this theory to some degree, although it is clear that some aspects of mind (such as belief for example) are unlikely to be modular. Fodor, a strict functionalist, rejects the idea that the neurological properties of the brain have any bearing on its cognitive properties and doubts the whole discipline of cognitive neuropsychology.

With improved neuroimaging techniques, it has been possible to correlate patterns of impairment with a knowledge of exactly which parts of the nervous system are damaged, allowing previously undiscovered functional relationships to be explored (the &quot;lesion method&quot;). Contemporary cognitive neuropsychology uses many of the same techniques and technologies from the wider science of neuropsychology and fields such as cognitive neuroscience. These may include neuroimaging, electrophysiology and neuropsychological tests to measure either brain function or psychological performance. Useful technology in cognitive neuropsychology includes positron-emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). These techniques make it possible to identify the areas of the brain responsible for performing certain cognitive tasks by measuring blood flow in the brain. PET scans sense the low-level radiation in the brain and produce 3-D images, whereas an fMRI works on a magnetic signal and is used to “map the brain”. Electroencephalography (EEG) records the brain’s electrical activity and can identify changes that occur over milliseconds. EEG is often used in patients with epilepsy to detect seizure activity.

The principles of cognitive neuropsychology have recently been applied to mental illness, with a view to understanding, for example, what the study of delusions may tell us about the function of normal belief. This relatively young field is known as cognitive neuropsychiatry.

<text>Łosice (; &quot;Loshitz&quot;, &quot;Lositze&quot;) is a town in eastern Poland, seat of the Łosice County and Gmina Łosice (commune) in the Masovian Voivodeship.

==History==

Łosice was first mentioned in 1264, as a medieval settlement from around the 11th–13th centuries; situated near the village of Dzięcioły. However, the location prevented the town&#x27;s further development and in the late 15th and early 16th century, the community was moved to Łosice&#x27;s present location. 
The first documented history of the town is preserved in the privileges issued by King Alexander Jagiellon in Radom on May 10, 1505; thus releasing Łosice from under the Ruthenian and Lithuanian city laws, and giving it more progressive Magdeburg rights. Private judiciary was revoked enabling the inhabitants to form a municipal government with a mayor and city council. The privileges allowed also for weekly markets and four fairs a year at a more convenient location; and, proposed the establishment of a town hall.

By 1551, there were two Eastern Orthodox churches, and two Roman Catholic churches in Łosice founded and endowed by King Sigismund I the Old. Throughout the 16th century the town enjoyed a period of economic development, with most inhabitants living off trade in leather, furs, and salt; as well as crafts, and a variety of services. According to a 1580 registry, there were 47 carpenters, 32 tailors, 20 bakers, 10 butchers, 7 stove fitters, and 4 blacksmiths in the town, not to mention millers, a locksmith, a goldsmith and a weaver. A nearly complete destruction of Łosice came about during the Swedish Deluge of 1655–1660. Only in the second half of the 18th century, the town began to gradually recover.

In 1795, after the Third Partition of Poland Łosice fell under Austrian rule. It was regained by Poles following the Austro–Polish War of 1809, and included within the short-lived Duchy of Warsaw. As a result of the Treaty of Vienna in 1815, the duchy ceased to exist, and the town came under Russian rule. During the November Uprising a Polish battalion under Colonel Raczyński formed in the town with many local residents. Before and during the January Uprising against the Russian rulership, local doctor Władysław Czarkowski led a unit of several hundred conspirators in an attack against the garrisons. After the Uprising&#x27;s defeat, the Russians brought reprisals against the Polish population. Łosice had been deprived of its Roman Catholic parish, and in 1867 lost its municipal rights. The process of Russification policies intensified right until the liberation of Poland. After World War I, in 1918, Poland regained independence and control of Łosice. In 1919, town rights were restored.

In 1975–1998, it was administratively located in the Biała Podlaska Voivodeship.

===History of the Jewish community===

Between the world wars, there were approximately 2,900 Jews in Łosice, about 70% of its inhabitants. They were living a full life there, handling with politics, religion, economic, youth groups and everyday life. In 1920, a pogrom took place against the town&#x27;s Jewish by the local Polish citizens.

On September 12, 1939, during the joint German-Soviet invasion of Poland which started World War II, the town was taken over by the Germans, but shortly thereafter it was transferred to the Soviet Union. In the wake of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, the town returned under German occupation, and they began to rob and murder Jews. The &quot;Judenrat&quot; that has been established in the town in early 1940, headed by Gershon Levin, ordered hundreds of Jewish workers to be sent to forced labor in German labor camps. Later, many Jews from the surrounding settlements were brought into the town. In December 1940, the Jews of Łosice were assembled in the ghetto where other Jews were brought. Jews were executed from time to time. Payments were demanded from the Jews. In May 1942, the number of inhabitants of the Łosice ghetto reached 6,800.

On August 22, 1942, SS men and Ukrainian policemen raided the ghetto in the town and marched its Jewish inhabitants to Siedlce, killing about 1,000 people on the way, and the remaining 5,500 Jews were loaded onto freight cars and sent to the Treblinka extermination camp. The 300 Jews who remained in Łosice were sent off to be murdered on November 27, 1942. Just a few Jews survived the Nazi extermination camps and returned to Łosice in 1945, but they were violently expelled by the Polish citizens of the town, who took over the Jewish property.

<text>Terespol (; ) is a border town in eastern Poland on the border with Belarus. It lies on the border river Bug, directly opposite the city of Brest, Belarus. It has 5,794 inhabitants as of 2014.

==Overview==
Since 1999 Terespol has been within Biała Podlaska County in Lublin Voivodeship. Between 1975 and 1998 it belonged to Biała Podlaska Voivodeship. The town is a busy border crossing between Poland and Belarus on the European route E30 which links Berlin-Warsaw-Minsk-Moscow. Another crossing into Brest is located at Kukuryki northwest of Terespol. There was also a local train between Brest and Terespol. It comes 3 times a day. The trip took 18 minutes and was a very comfortable way of crossing border between Belarus and Poland. Due to the Coronavirus pandemic, the train was cancelled at the beginning of 2020 and has been suspended for an indefinite period.

Terespol features in a novel by the Yiddish Nobel Prize-winning writer Isaac Bashevis Singer, &quot;The Family Moskat&quot; (1950), in which the young protagonist, Asa Heshel Bennet, comes to Warsaw from his hometown of Terespol Minor to study.

==History==

The town of Terespol is located in the spot of a village called Błotków or Błotkowo, which existed in the 16th and 17th centuries. In 1512, this area became property of a nobleman called Iwan Sapieha of Kodeń. Later it belonged to the Hornostaj and Dorohostajski families. Administratively it was part of the Podlaskie Voivodeship until 1566, and the Brest Litovsk Voivodeship afterwards until the Partitions of Poland. In 1609, King Sigismund III of Poland built here a spacious palace with a vast garden. Due to proximity to the city of Brześć Litewski (Brest), the settlement prospered. During Swedish invasion of Poland (1655–1660), Błotków together with the palace were ransacked and burned to the ground by Swedish soldiers.

In the second half of the 17th century, Błotków with its ruined palace was purchased by Castellan of Vilnius Józef Bogusław Słuszka, who founded here a town, named Terespol after his wife, Teresa née Gosiewska. In 1697, Holy Trinity church was built here, soon afterwards, Dominican friars settled in Terespol. In 1748, Terespol became property of Grand Treasurer of Lithuania Georg Detlev von Flemming, who made great contribution to the development of the town, draining local swamps and building a number of dykes and canals. Furthermore, Flemming introduced a number of German settlers, and built a manor house in the location of the destroyed royal castle. In 1757, one weekly and two one-day annual fairs were established. In 1764, Terespol was ransacked by private soldiers of Polish magnate Karol Stanisław &quot;Panie Kochanku&quot; Radziwiłł, who waged a personal war with Flemming for his support of the Czartoryski family. Later on the town passed to the Czartoryski family.

After the Third Partition of Poland (1795) Terespol briefly belonged to the Habsburg Empire. After the Polish victory in the Austro-Polish War of 1809, it was part of the Polish Duchy of Warsaw, and from 1815 to 1916, it belonged to Russian-controlled Congress Poland. The town burned in several fires, but continued to prosper, due to the construction of a highway from Warsaw to Brest (1819–1823). After the November Uprising, Terespol belonged to the Russian Imperial government. In 1855, due to the construction of Brest Fortress, Terespol was moved westwards, and all buildings in the old town were destroyed for military purposes. In 1867, a railroad to Warsaw was completed; in 1870, it was extended to Brest. As a result of Russian discriminatory regulations the town saw a large influx of Jews, who then became the town&#x27;s largest ethnic group.

In 1915, all residents living within from the fortress were forcibly resettled into Russia, and during the evacuation, the town was ransacked and burned. Terespol was reintegrated with Poland, after the country regained independence in 1918. In the Second Polish Republic Terespol was part of the Lublin Voivodeship.

During World War II Terespol was briefly occupied by the Soviets in September 1939, and then by Nazi Germany from 1939 to 1944. During the occupation, most Jews were murdered in the Holocaust. The Germans also established a transit camp for Polish prisoners of war in Terespol. Terespol became a border town after the Soviet Union annexed former eastern territories of Poland.

==Climate==
Terespol has an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Cfb&quot;) using the isotherm or a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Dfb&quot;) using the isotherm.

==Sights==

Around Terespol one can find some of the old fortifications that were once part of the Brest Fortress. In Terespol there is a former powder magazine of the fortress. Other sights include the 19th-century monument to the construction of the highway connecting Warsaw with nearby Brest, and modern monuments: the Independence Monument and the Tadeusz Kościuszko monument.

<doc id="389582" wikidata="Q34267" url="?curid=389582" title="Międzyrzec Podlaski">
<text>Międzyrzec Podlaski () is a town in Biała Podlaska County, Lublin Voivodeship, Poland, with the population of 17,102 inhabitants . The total area of the town is . Międzyrzec is located in the historic region of Podlachia, near the Krzna river, not far from the border with Belarus.

==History==
The first official mention of Międzyrzec Podlaski as a town dates back to 1434, or (alternatively) 1455 and 1477 according to different historical sources. At that time, the newly established town was located along a busy merchant route from Łuków to Brześć. Międzyrzec quickly developed: in 1486, a Roman Catholic church was built here, and town&#x27;s owner, Jan Nassutowicz, received permission for fairs. In 1598, a salt warehouse was opened, the town also was center of beer industry. Międzyrzec was a private town of the Nassutowicz, Wyszyński, Zabrzeziński, Zbaraski and Czartoryski noble families.

The period of peace and prosperity ended in 1648, when Miedzyrzec was raided by Zaporozhian Cossacks. During the Swedish invasion of Poland, the town was ransacked and burned by Swedes, who returned in 1706 and 1708, during the Great Northern War. Furthermore, Międzyrzec was raided by Russians in 1660. In 1775, Międzyrzec was the largest city in Podlachia.
In 1795, following the Third Partition of Poland, the town was annexed by the Habsburg Empire. In 1800, educator Grzegorz Piramowicz became the parish priest in Międzyrzec. Following the Polish victory in the Austro-Polish War of 1809, it was regained by Poles and included within the short-lived Duchy of Warsaw, and after the Congress of Vienna of 1815 it became part of so-called Congress Poland under the control of the Russian Tsar. Międzyrzec developed rapidly as a major trade hub in Podlachia, especially between 1830 and 1863. In 1867 it became a stop on the Polish railway system. By that time, Miedzyrzec was an important center of Greek Catholic Church: in 1772, Duke August Aleksander Czartoryski founded here Unite Church of St. Peter and Paul. Since mid-19th century, government of Russian-controlled Congress Poland initiated the process of Russification, aimed at the Uniates. As a result, two local Uniate churches were turned into Orthodox (1875).

During World War I, the town was occupied by Germany. On 16 November 1918, German troops committed a massacre of some 44 Poles, members of the Polish Military Organisation and civilians. German occupation ended on 17 November 1918, and the town was reintegrated with Poland, which regained independence a few days earlier.

A large Jewish community was present at least since the 16th century Międzyrzec. At the end of the 1930s in the reborn Polish Republic approximately 12,000 inhabitants, or 75% of its population, were Jewish.

===World War II===

In 1939, during the Nazi–Soviet Invasion of Poland, the town was overrun by Wehrmacht on 13 September 1939, and ceded to the Russians on 25 September, in accordance with the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. Two weeks later, it was transferred back to Germany after the new Boundary Treaty. In 1940 six separate slave labor camps were set up by the Nazis for some 2,000 local Jews; along with Judenrat, and the Jewish police.

The German army entered the Soviet occupation zone on 22 June 1941 under the codename Operation Barbarossa. More Jews from the surrounding area including expellees from Kraków were shipped in. On 19 April 1942 the Jews were ordered by the Gestapo to turn over of gold within 3 days. Some 40 hostages were murdered on the streets. On 25–26 August 1942, the first mass deportation of Jews from Międzyrzec took place with around 10,000 prisoners forcibly put on 52 cattle cars (shipment #566 according to the German inventory) and sent to Treblinka extermination camp. Two days later, the Międzyrzec Podlaski Ghetto was established under the management of Judenrat. Several more mass deportation actions followed. On 17 July 1943, the ghetto was definitively liquidated, along with the local transit camp. Fewer than 1% of the Jewish population of the town survived the Nazi mass executions and deportations to death camps.

The German occupiers also operated a forced labour subcamp of the Stalag 366 prisoner-of-war camp, in which Italian POWs were held. On 23 July 1944, 60 remaining Italians from the subcamp were massacred by the Germans before their withdrawal from the town.

==Economy==
Of the approximately 4,900 employed citizens of the town, ca. 36% work in industrial fields, 19% in trade markets, and 11% in education. The unemployment rate in the town was 22% in October 2005.

The town lies at the intersection of two important national roads: DK2 (Poland&#x27;s main east–west connector) and DK19. In the future Expressway S19 will run just west of the town. A section of it already constructed as the town&#x27;s bypass road and opened in 2008 allows north–south traffic on DK19 road to avoid the town centre.

<text>Radzyń Podlaski is a town in eastern Poland, about 60 km north of Lublin, with 15,808 inhabitants (2017). The town has been part of the Lublin Voivodeship since 1999, previously it was part of the Biała Podlaska Voivodeship (1975–1998). It is the capital of Radzyń Podlaski County, and historically belongs to the region of Lesser Poland (despite the adjective &quot;Podlaski&quot;, which suggests that it is part of another Polish province, Podlaskie). The town was founded in 1468, and its most important landmark is the rococo Potocki Palace.

Radzyń lies on the Białka River within the South Podlasie Lowland, at the height of above sea level. The town has the area of 20,29 square kilometers, of which forests make only 5%. It is located along the Expressway S19, which passes through Białystok, Lublin and Rzeszów.

==History==

In the early years of Polish statehood Radzyń was located in extreme northeastern corner of Lesser Poland, near the border with Podlachia, which often passed between Poland, Ruthenia and the Duchy of Lithuania. The region was frequently raided by its neighbors, which had a negative impact on the economy. This sparsely populated borderland of Lesser Poland began to see improvements after 1385, when Poland and Lithuania formed the Polish–Lithuanian union under the Union of Krewo. Settlers from other part of Lesser Poland, as well as Mazovia, came to Radzyń, churches were built and villages were founded. According to historical documents, the town of Radzyń was preceded by a settlement called &quot;Kozirynek&quot; (also spelled as &quot;Cozirynek&quot; and &quot;Kozyrynek&quot;; this name appears in documents as late as 1580).

In 1456, first Roman Catholic parish at Radzyń was created, and in 1468, the town was incorporated based on Magdeburg rights. It was a royal possession, leased by kings to different noblemen, such as the Mniszech family. In 1690, King John III Sobieski granted several privileges to town&#x27;s residents. At that time, Radzyń had Roman Catholic, Greek-Catholic and Orthodox churches, as well as a synagogue. Radzyń was a private town, administratively located in the Lublin Voivodeship in the Lesser Poland Province of the Polish Crown. Since 1741 until the late 18th century, Radzyń belonged to the Potocki family. General Eustachy Potocki built a rococo palace here. His son Ignacy Potocki (1750–1809) was born here.

===19th century===
Following the Partitions of Poland at the end of the 18th century, Radzyń was annexed by Austria, then following the Austro-Polish War, in 1809, it was liberated by Poles and included within the short-lived Duchy of Warsaw, and after its dissolution, in 1815 it became part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland. Many inhabitants participated in the large Polish uprisings of 1830–1831 and 1863–1864. In 1867 Russian authorities created Radzyń County, which gave the town a boost. Later on, Radzyń got a rail connection with Lublin and Siedlce, and the town began a period of development.

===World War I===

During World War I, the town was occupied by Germany. In November 1918, Poland regained independence, and the occupying German forces opened fire on Poles who tried to liberate the town, but it was still reintegrated with the reborn Polish state. Within the Second Polish Republic, Radzyń was the seat of a county in Lublin Voivodeship. The town was briefly occupied by the Russians during the Polish–Soviet War in mid-August 1920, and recaptured by Poles on August 16, 1920. After a major fire in 1930, the houses on the market square, formerly from wood, were rebuilt of stone and brick.

===World War II===
During the joint German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II, on September 9, 1939, Radzyń was bombed by the Luftwaffe. In late September of that year, it was one of centers of Polish resistance, with units of Independent Operational Group Polesie stationed there for some time. The first Germans appeared in Radzyń after the Battle of Kock, in early October 1939.

In June 1940, during the &quot;AB-Aktion&quot;, the Germans carried out mass arrests of Poles, many of whom were afterwards imprisoned in the Lublin Castle and deported to concentration camps. From Radzyń, 6,000 local Jews were sent to Treblinka extermination camp in August 1942 amid gunfire and screams. Some went through the transit point in the Międzyrzec Podlaski Ghetto. The pacification actions were conducted by the Nazi German Reserve Police Battalion 101. The town was a major center of Home Army, with 4,200 members, and the German occupation lasted until July 23, 1944, when the Red Army entered the town. The Jewish community was never reconstituted.

==Jewish community==
Jews settled in Radzyn Podlaski in the 16th century. In the 19th century, it became known as an important center of Jewish learning. The town had a Jewish population of 2,900 before World War II. It was home to the Radzyn Hasidic dynasty.

==Landmarks==
Among the local points of interest are the St. Trinity Church (1641), built in the so-called Lublin Renaissance style, as well as the Potocki Palace (1740s), built by a Polish-Italian architect Jakub Fontana. Its interior was destroyed twice: in 1915 by Imperial Russian troops, and in 1944 by the Wehrmacht during the occupation of Poland in World War II. The palace was in 1920 the headquarters of General Edward Rydz-Śmigły, during the Battle of Warsaw. Since 1920, it has served as office of local administration.

<text>Parczew is a town in eastern Poland, with a population of 10,281 (2006). It is the capital of Parczew County in the Lublin Voivodeship.

Parczew historically belongs to Lesser Poland (&quot;Małopolska&quot;) region. The town lies 60 kilometers north of Lublin, and 70 kilometers south of Biala Podlaska. It has a rail station on the secondary-importance line from Lublin to Łuków, which was inaugurated in 1898.

==History==

The settlement of Parczew existed since the 12th century, lying near then-eastern border of the Kingdom of Poland. In 1401, it received Magdeburg rights town charter from King Władysław II Jagiełło. The union of Poland and Lithuania (see Union of Krewo) helped Parczew to develop, as it ceased to be a border town. The town was conveniently located on one of the routes joining the capitals of the two united nations - Kraków and Vilnius. In the Union of Horodło (1413), Parczew was designated to be the location of Polish–Lithuanian councils. The town emerged as one of the centers of political life of the two nations. Parczew was visited by all kings of the Jagiellonian dynasty, and the last council took place here in 1564.
Parczew had a defensive wall, with three gates, and a royal residence, where Polish kings stayed on their way to and from Vilnius. The town was the seat of a starosta, with a town hall located on the market square, two bath houses, four mills and breweries. In the 16th century, it had three Roman Catholic churches, one Orthodox church, a synagogue, a school and a hospital. In 1500 and 1544, Parczew was destroyed in Crimean Tatars raids, and in 1655, it was seized, ransacked and burned by the Swedes (see Deluge). After the wars of the mid-17th century, the town did not recover until the reign of Stanisław August Poniatowski. The 1st Polish Infantry Regiment was stationed in the town in 1793.

Parczew administratively belonged to the Lublin Voivodeship in the Lesser Poland Province until the Third Partition of Poland in 1795, when it was annexed by Austria. It was regained by Poles following the Austro-Polish War of 1809, and included within the short-lived Duchy of Warsaw. After the duchy&#x27;s dissolution, it was part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland. During the January Uprising, on June 29, 1863, it was the site of a skirmish between Polish insurgents and Russian troops. In 1898, the rail line from Lublin, via Parczew, to Łuków was built. In 1918, Poland regained independence and control of the town. During the Polish–Soviet War, the town was briefly occupied by the Russian invaders, before it was recaptured by the Poles on August 16, 1920. In the interbellum, the town had a population of 10,000.
Following the joint German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II in September 1939, the town was occupied by Germany. On 20 February 1940, the SS and &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; committed a massacre of 350 Polish prisoners-of-war of Jewish origin. It was a center of Polish resistance. In local forests, numerous Home Army and Armia Ludowa units operated. On July 22, 1944, Parczew was liberated by the Home Army, and in the summer of 1945, the anti-Communist unit of Leon Taraszkiewicz attacked a local Urząd Bezpieczeństwa prison.

In 1955, Parczew County was created, and in 2001, the town celebrated its 600th anniversary. From 1975 to 1998, it was administratively located in the Biała Podlaska Voivodeship.

== Jews in Parczew ==
An organized Jewish community existed in the town since the early 16th century. Just before the outbreak of World War II the Jewish community numbered 5,000, more than half of the town&#x27;s population. During the German occupation of Poland the Jews were first confined to a ghetto crammed with inhabitants of neighbouring settlements as well. In the course of the Holocaust, on August 19, 1942 the Nazi German Reserve Police Battalion 101 aided by the Trawniki men rounded up and deported 3,000 Jews to Treblinka extermination camp; 2,000 more Jews were loaded onto Holocaust trains and murdered upon arrival. The battalion returned to Parczew with the same company of Hiwis in October 1942. There were 5,000 more Jews in the ghetto. They were massacred in a mass shooting action and deported, at which point the town was declared &quot;Judenfrei&quot; (&quot;free of Jews&quot;). The Parczew partisans anti-Nazi fighter group operated in the forests around the town, which included Jewish men and women who managed to escape the slaughter.

<doc id="389586" wikidata="Q209932" url="?curid=389586" title="Biała Podlaska">
<text>Biała Podlaska (; ) is a city in eastern Poland with 56,498 inhabitants It is situated in the Lublin Voivodeship (since 1999), having previously been the capital of Biała Podlaska Voivodeship (1975–1998). It is the capital of Biała Podlaska County, although the city is not part of the county (it constitutes a separate city county). The city lies on the Krzna river.

==History==
===Early history===
The first historical document mentioning Biała Podlaska dates to 1481. In the beginning, Biała Podlaska belonged to the Illnicz family. The founder of the city may have been Piotr Janowicz, nicknamed &quot;Biały&quot; (Polish for &quot;white&quot;), who was the hetman of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Biała Podlaska was administratively part of the Podlaskie Voivodeship, and then the Brest Litovsk Voivodeship in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (then in union with Poland).

In 1569, Biała Podlaska changed ownership; the new owners were the Radziwiłł family. Under their rule, Biała Podlaska had been growing for two and a half centuries. In 1622, Aleksander Ludwik Radziwiłł built the fortress and the castle. In 1628, Krzysztof Ciborowicz Wilski established Bialska Academy as a regional center of education (since 1633 it was a branch of the Jagiellonian University, then called Kraków Academy). It was one of the best schools in Poland in that time (about 1650–1700). During this time, many churches were erected, as was a hospital.

The prosperity period ended with the Swedish invasion in 1655. Then Biała Podlaska was attacked by Cossacks and Rákóczi armies. The town was significantly destroyed; however, thanks to Michał Kazimierz Radziwiłł and his wife Katarzyna Sobieska, it was rebuilt. In 1670, Michał Kazimierz Radziwiłł gives Biała Podlaska town rights and the coat of arms, which depicts archangel Michael standing on a dragon.
In 1720, Anna Katarzyna Radziwiłłowa began building the tower and the gate - both buildings exist to this day and are the most interesting remains of the castle and palace. In the 18th century, the city and the fortress were times destroyed many times in warfare and rebuilt. The last heir, Dominik Hieronim Radziwiłł, died on 11 November 1813 in France, as a colonel of the Polish army. The palace fell into ruin and was pulled down in 1883.

===Late modern period===
After the Third Partition of Poland in 1795, Biała Podlaska temporarily came under the rule of Austrian Habsburgs (Austrian partition of Poland). Following the Austro-Polish War of 1809, temporarily recovered by Poles, Biała Podlaska was part of the Polish Duchy of Warsaw. In 1815, the town became part of Congress Poland within the Russian Partition of Poland. At the end of the 19th century, Biała Podlaska was a large garrison town of the Imperial Russian Army. Near the intersection of Brzeska Street and Aleje Tysiclecia Avenue is a cemetery for soldiers killed during World War I.

In 1918, following World War I, Poland regained independence and the town was reunited with Poland. During the Second Polish Republic in the interwar period, Biała Podlaska was growing fast. The town was the seat of the Podlaska Wytwórnia Samolotów (PWS), an important aircraft factory. There was also a garrison of the 34th infantry regiment of the Polish Armed Forces. The regiment, formed in 1919, fought successfully in the Polish–Soviet War, and also fought against Germans and Soviets during the invasion of Poland, which started World War II in 1939. During the Polish–Soviet War, on 1 August 1920, Russians invaded the city, but were quickly repelled by the Poles, and later on they invaded again, before the town was eventually liberated by the Polish 1st Legions Infantry Division on 17 August 1920. The last commander of the regiment, lieutenant colonel Wacław Budrewicz, was taken prisoner of war by the Soviets and murdered by them in the 1940 Katyn massacre, in which also multiple Polish teachers and policemen from the city, and alumni of local schools were murdered.

===World War II===

World War II halted the town&#x27;s development because of Nazi and Soviet repression. The Germans captured Biała Podlaska on 13 September 1939, but withdrew on 26 September to allow the Soviets to a station in the town. But, on 10 October 1939, in accordance with the terms of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, the Soviets departed and the town was reoccupied by the Germans. By that time, the Soviets had already completely plundered the PWS aircraft factory, so that nothing but empty buildings remained.

Poles expelled by the Germans in 1939–1940 from various places in German-annexed western Poland were deported to the area, while their previous homes were handed over to German colonists as part of the &quot;Lebensraum&quot; policy. In March and July 1940, the Germans imprisoned dozens of Poles in the local prison, and then massacred them in the nearby Grabarka forest. Over 40 Polish teachers were arrested in the town on 24 June 1940, imprisoned in Lublin and then deported to concentration camps, as part of the &quot;AB-Aktion&quot;. On 5 July 1940 the Germans carried out another massacre of Poles in Grabarka, whom they previously imprisoned in the town. Further massacres of Poles were carried out by the Germans throughout the war. Despite such circumstances, the Polish resistance movement was active in the city.
After Germany attacked their Soviet ally in Operation Barbarossa, a German prisoner-of-war camp was set up near Biała Podlaska for Soviet and Polish POWs. In 1942, they were replaced by some 600 French POWs brought from Rawa Ruska, who were soon relocated to a camp in nearby Hola. In 1943, Italian POWs were brought to the city and placed in a local subcamp of the Stalag 366/Z POW camp. The Germans subjected the Italians to mass starvation, epidemics, harassment and beatings, and over 400 Italians died in the camp. Poles provided food to starving Italians, despite the threat of being shot on sight by German guards, for both Italians and Poles for such attempts, with confirmed cases of such killings. There was also a forced labour subcamp for some 200–300 Italian POWs in the city.

On 12 April 1944, the 14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS, composed of Ukrainian nationalists collaborating with Germany, pacified the present-day district of Sielczyk, burning twelve houses and murdering nine Polish men and women.

In 1944 the town was recaptured by Polish and Soviet troops and restored to Poland, although with a Soviet-installed communist regime, which remained in power until the Fall of Communism in the 1980s.

===Recent history===
In the postwar period and after the fall of communism, Biała Podlaska has developed as a more modern city. It retains many of the historic features in the central Polish old town of the city. From 1975 to 1999 Biała Podlaska was a capital of the voivodeship, later it again became a city county, as before 1975.

===History of the Jewish community===
The first mention of Jewish settlement in Biała Podlaska dates from 1621, when 30 Jewish families were granted rights of residence there. By 1841, there were 2,200 Jews of a total population of 3,588 in the town. In 1897, the number was 6,549 out of 13,090 inhabitants. In the 19th century, the chasidic movement established strong roots in Biała Podlaska.

A descendant of the Yid Hakodosh of Przysucha formed the Biala chasidic court, which survives to this day with communities in London, and cities in the United States and Israel. The chasidim of Kotsk also had a large presence in Biała Podlaska, some of whom later became Gerrer chasidim. In sovereign Poland by 1931, the Jews constituted 64.7% of the total population, or 6,923 out of 10,697 citizens. Four Yiddish newspapers were published locally between the two world wars.

The Germans captured Biała Podlaska on 13 September 1939 during the invasion of Poland but withdrew on 26 September. On 10 October 1939, the Soviets handed the town back to the Germans when the line of demarcation was finally set up. Around 600 Jews escaped the town during the Soviet departure. The Germans formed a Judenrat in November 1939, which set up a public kitchen and a Jewish infirmary. By the end of the year, the Nazis began to impose discriminatory restrictions against the Jews. On 1 December 1939, they decreed that all Jews had to wear a yellow Star of David. Jews were ordered to move into an open-type ghetto along the Grabanów, Janowa, Prosta and Przechodnia streets, and a Jewish Ghetto Police was established. At the end of 1939, some 2,000 to 3,000 more Jews were brought there as a result of deportations from Suwałki and Serock. The overcrowding and poor sanitations resulted in a typhus epidemic in Biała Podlaska in early 1940, causing many deaths. The Germans imprisoned some Poles in the local prison and then deported them to concentration camps for helping and rescuing Jews.

Several hundred more Jews were brought in from as far as Kraków and Mława during German &quot;resettlement&quot; actions conducted in 1940 and 1941. The men were sent to new labour camps in the Wola district at an airfield, the train station, and elsewhere. Hundreds were forced to pave roads, drain ditches, construct sewage lines and build barracks. Many Jewish women worked in the Nazi farms. In March 1942 the ghetto had 8,400 inmates.

====The Holocaust====
After the launch of Operation Reinhard on 6 June 1942– the code name for the most deadly phase of the Holocaust in occupied Poland – the Jews were told to prepare for &quot;resettlement&quot;. Only workers from the forced labour camps possessing labour permits were to be exempt from the deportation. On 10 June 1942, some 3,000 Jews, including women with children, were assembled in the synagogue courtyard. Many Jews fled to the forests. The assembled Jews were led by the German police to the train station. The next day the prisoners were packed into deportation trains and sent to Sobibór extermination camp. All were gassed.

In September 1942, some 3,000 Jews from the neighbouring towns of Janów and Konstantynów were brought into Biała Podlaska Ghetto. The overcrowding became desperate. The Jews sensed that the ghetto was slated for liquidation. Many escaped to the forests; others prepared hiding places in the basements. On 6 October 1942, the Germans deported about 1,200 Jews from the local labour camps to Międzyrzec Podlaski Ghetto. The subsequent &quot;deportation actions&quot; conducted by the Nazi German Reserve Police Battalion 101, augmented by the Ukrainian Trawnikis, lasted throughout October and November 1942. In total, some 10,800 Jews from around Biała Podlaska and its county were murdered at the Treblinka extermination camp, away, or massacred on the spot during roundups.

Chil Rajchman, a &quot;Sonderkommando&quot; who survived the Treblinka revolt and the war, later testified that he witnessed a transport of 6,000 Jews from Biała Podlaska arrive at Treblinka. When the sealed doors were opened, 90 percent of prisonersmen, women, and childrenwere already dead inside. Their bodies were thrown into smouldering mass grave at the &quot;Lazaret&quot;.

The remaining Jews of Biała Podlaska were sent to a transit point at the Międzyrzec Podlaski Ghetto for deportations to death camps. In July 1943 the transit ghetto in Międzyrzec was liquidated. All its inmates were deported to Majdanek and Treblinka, where they were murdered in the gas chambers. The Nazis left a small group of 300 Jewish slave labourers in Biała Podlaska to clean up the decaying ghetto area. In May 1944, the surviving workers were murdered at Majdanek. Biała Podlaska was captured by the Red Army on 26 July 1944. Only 300 of the Jews who had lived in Biała Podlaska are known to have survived the Holocaust. Most of them left Poland after the war.

====Remembrance====
The parts of the city which were originally the Jewish &quot;quarter&quot; still exist.
The Jewish community is commemorated by a memorial erected at the site of the Jewish cemetery, which was destroyed by the Nazis. Another memorial was recently erected by Jewish survivors from the town who now live in the USA. Two former private prayer houses of the Jewish community are still in existence. The cemetery otherwise stands as a reminder of the hole that was ripped out of Biała Podlaska life by the Holocaust and loss of so many Jews. Apart from Israel, Melbourne in Australia has the largest number of Jewish survivors from Biała Podlaska - all now very aged.

<doc id="389602" wikidata="Q746232" url="?curid=389602" title="George Barnes (British politician)">
<text>George Nicoll Barnes (2 January 1859 – 21 April 1940) was a British Labour Party politician and a Leader of the Labour Party (1910–1911).

==Early life==
Barnes was born on 2 January 1859 in Lochee, Dundee, the second of five sons of James Barnes, a skilled engineer and mill manager from Yorkshire, and his wife, Catherine Adam Langlands. His brother T. B. Barnes was also active in politics, later becoming a Labour Party councillor in Dundee. The family moved back to England and settled at Ponders End in Middlesex, where his father managed a jute mill in which George himself began working at the age of eleven, after attending a church school at Enfield Highway. He then spent two years as an engineering apprentice, first at Powis James of Lambeth then at Parker&#x27;s foundry, Dundee.

After finishing his apprenticeship he worked for two years at the Vickers shipyard in Barrow before returning once again to the London area, where he experienced unemployment during the slump of 1879. He had a number of short-term jobs before settling for eight years at Lucas and Aird in Fulham.

==Trade union and political involvement==
During his time in London, Barnes became an active member of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers. He stood for the general secretaryship of the union in 1895, but was narrowly defeated by the incumbent, John Anderson. However, the following year, Anderson was dismissed for &quot;wilful neglect of duty&quot;, and Barnes easily beat him in a new election. Barnes was a committed member of the co-operative movement, and a keen if moderate socialist, which led him to join the Independent Labour Party on its foundation in 1893.

==Parliamentary career==

At the 1895 general election he stood unsuccessfully for the Independent Labour Party in Rochdale. He was elected as MP for Glasgow Blackfriars and Hutchesontown at the 1906 general election for the Labour Party, becoming one of the first two Labour MPs to be elected in Scotland. He sat for Blackfriars and Hutchesontown until the constituency was abolished for the 1918 general election, and thereafter sat for Glasgow Gorbals (which covered the same area) until he stood down at the 1922 election.

==From high office to expulsion==
Barnes was Leader of the Labour Party from 14 February 1910 to 6 February 1911. , he is the shortest-serving Labour leader, remaining in the post for only 11 months. He was Minister of Pensions (1916–1917), rising to Minister without Portfolio as one of David Lloyd George&#x27;s powerful five member war cabinet (1917–1920). In 1918 the Labour Party decided to leave the Lloyd George Coalition but Barnes refused to resign. As a result, he was expelled from the Labour Party, and with the British Workers League founded the pro-coalition National Democratic and Labour Party, many of whose candidates were elected on the Coalition Coupon in December 1918. He also stood in 1918 under the Coalition Labour title. As a reward for his loyalty, he was a participant at the Paris Peace Conference, he was instrumental in the creation of the International Labour Organization (ILO), he was a signatory to the Treaty of Versailles, he is featured in William Orpen&#x27;s famous painting of the treaty signing (seated second from the right), and he was lionised in the iconic painting, &quot;Statesmen of World War I&quot; (standing directly above Winston Churchill).

==Later life==
After resigning as a minister early in 1920 he played no further significant role in British politics. In March 1920 he was appointed a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour for his ministerial services. He quit politics when the Labour Party announced that it would again field a candidate against him in the general election of 1922. As it was clear that the tide would turn strongly towards the official Labour candidates throughout Glasgow, and as he had no wish to serve in any other party, he decided to withdraw from his seat.

Barnes had a long and active retirement, continuing to support the International Labour Organization, serving as chairman of the Co-operative Printing Society, and publishing several books, including his autobiography, &quot;From Workshop to War Cabinet&quot; (1923), and a &quot;History of the International Labour Office&quot; (1926). He was a pleasant-looking, mild-mannered man, but little is known about his private life. In 1882 he had married Jessie, daughter of Thomas Langlands, with whom he had two sons and a daughter; his youngest son was killed in action in France while serving as a Second Lieutenant with the Gordon Highlanders during the First World War.

In 1932, he became the first president of the pacific organization The New Commonwealth. He died in 1940 at his London home, and was buried in Fulham Cemetery.

<text>Miss Van (born 1973 in Toulouse, France), also known as Vanessa Alice, is a graffiti and street artist. Miss Van started painting on the street of Toulouse alongside Mademoiselle Kat at the age of 18. Today, she is now internationally known as a street and fine artist. Primarily, her work is marked by the use of unique characters, called &quot;poupées,&quot; or dolls. Miss Van&#x27;s work has appeared on streets internationally, although she also exhibits canvases in galleries across France, Europe and the United States. Today, her work is characterized by both street art and fine art, blurring the lines between both worlds.

Miss Van currently resides in Barcelona and has written and published several books with the publishing house Drago and coordinated several art shows across Europe. She remains one of the most famous female street and graffiti artists in the world, recognized as one of the top figures in early 21st-century street art canon.

== Artwork ==

In her artwork, Miss Van typically depicts sloe-eyed women, covering a varied array of female forms and expressing many different emotions. Common themes in her work include eroticism, sexuality, desire and innocence which are represented by animal masks, pastel colors, and revealing clothing. Miss Van&#x27;s work illustrates a cartoonish, dream-like world of female sexuality. Over time the stylization of the women has changed, reflecting Miss Van&#x27;s artistic and personal evolution as she has grown and matured. This change is paralleled in Miss Van&#x27;s increased preference for the gallery over the street. In the gallery, Miss Van embraces enclosed and intimate gallery space as part of the artistic experience .

Between 2008 and 2016, Miss Van exhibited artwork in private galleries in Shanghai, London, Rome, Berlin, Paris and Vienna. In North America, she has held shows in Detroit, Santa Monica, Los Angeles, Montreal, Chicago and New York. Notable shows include, &quot;Still a Little Magic&quot; at Upper Playground, San Francisco in 2008; &quot;Cachetes Colorados&quot; at Upper Playground, Mexico City in 2010; and &quot;A Moment in Time&quot; at Saatchi Gallery, London in 2016. The same year, Miss Van also showed at the Atmossphere Biennale in Moscow, where she exhibited a woven wool rug based on an original painting.

== Critical reception ==
Thematically, her work has provoked a negative reaction from some feminists due to the portrayal of women in her graffiti. Although she receives this backlash, her reasoning for her painting is more personal. &quot;Painting on walls was a way to show that I was boycotting the conventional art world&quot;. Despite negative critique of her work, some critics perceive her portrayal of sexuality and feminity as a powerful rejection of male supremacy and male-dominated art. Her work is also appreciated for centering women and increasing the representation of women in street art. Furthermore, the depiction of a full-figured female form in Miss Van&#x27;s work is representative of body positive politics. Miss Van is regarded as one of the most famous female graffiti and street artists in the world, a genre that is generally considered as having few female artists.

In 2016, Miss Van held her first institutional art show at Centro de Arte Contemporáneo de Málaga in Spain, titled &quot;For The Wind in My Hair.&quot; The show featured 39 original paintings on canvas. Artnet News calls the show as &quot;interesting discourse between the worlds of fine art and street art.&quot; Miss Van also displays how meaning changes between these two artistic sites, the street and the gallery.

<text>Volvo Car AB, trading as Volvo Cars (, styled VOLVO in the company&#x27;s logo) is a Swedish multinational manufacturer of luxury vehicles. Volvo is headquartered in Torslanda, Gothenburg. The company manufactures SUVs, station wagons, and sedans. The company&#x27;s main marketing revolves around safety and its Swedish heritage and design.

Volvo Cars has been separate from its former parent conglomerate and producer of heavy trucks, buses, and construction equipment (among others) AB Volvo since 1999 when AB Volvo sold its automobile division Volvo Cars to Ford Motor Company for billion. On 28 March 2010, Ford sold Volvo Cars at a loss to Geely Holding for $1.8 billion; the deal closed in August 2010. Volvo Cars was publicly listed on the Nasdaq Stockholm stock exchange in 2021, though Geely Holding still retains majority ownership. Volvo Cars and AB Volvo share the Volvo logo, and cooperate in running the Volvo Museum.

In March 2021, Volvo Cars announced that it would be a fully electric brand by 2030, with vehicles sold exclusively online. In June 2021, Volvo Cars and Swedish battery developer and manufacturer Northvolt announced the intention to establish a 50/50 joint venture consisting of a battery gigafactory and R&amp;D (research and development) center. In December 2021, it was revealed the battery R&amp;D center would be located in Gothenburg. In February 2022, Gothenburg was also chosen as the location for the battery gigafactory.
During 2021 and 2022, Volvo Cars transferred its hybrid engine research and production capabilities in Skövde and Zhangjiakou to Aurobay, in a joint venture with Geely. In 2023, Volvo removed conventional engines as an option, meaning mild hybrids are the base engine option in the US.

Volvo Cars owns 18% of Polestar and 50% of NOVO Energy (electric vehicle batteries), 100% of Zenseact (AD and ADAS software), and 100% of HaleyTek (Android-based infotainment systems). As of 2022, Volvo Cars has production plants in Torslanda in Sweden, Ridgeville, South Carolina in the United States, Ghent in Belgium, and Daqing in China.

==History==

===1927–1999===
Volvo was founded upon the concept of safety in 1927, in Gothenburg, Sweden:

The company was created as a subsidiary to SKF. Assar Gabrielsson was appointed managing director and Gustav Larson technical manager.

The trademark &quot;Volvo&quot; (which is Latin for &#x27;I roll&#x27;) was first registered by SKF on 11 May 1915 with the intention to use it for a special series of ball bearing for the American market but it was never used for this purpose (however in the application for the trademark, it was also designated for the purpose of &quot;automobiles&quot;). The SKF trademark as it looks today was used instead for all the SKF-products. Some pre-series of Volvo-bearings stamped with the brand name &#x27;Volvo&#x27; were manufactured but never released to the market, and it was not until 1927 that the trademark was used again, now as a trademark and company name for an automobile.

The first Volvo car left the assembly line on 14 April 1927, and was called Volvo ÖV 4. After this the young company produced closed top and cabriolet vehicles, which were designed to hold strong in the Swedish climate and terrain. In the registration application for Volvo logotype in 1927, they simply made a copy of the entire radiator for ÖV4, viewed from the front. The round logo with the arrow pointing to the right ( ♂ ) is the Greek alchemical symbol for iron.

Presented in 1944, the Volvo PV444 passenger car only entered production in 1947. It was the smallest Volvo yet and became the most produced car that Volvo made, and spearheaded Volvo&#x27;s move into the profitable American market. The first Volvos arrived in the United States in 1955, after the hardware wholesaler Leo Hirsh began distributing cars in California. Later, Texas was added, and in 1956, Volvo themselves began importing cars to the US. North America has consistently provided Volvo with their main outlet since.

In 1963, Volvo opened the Volvo Halifax Assembly plant, the first assembly plant in the company&#x27;s history outside of Sweden, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. In 1964, Volvo opened its Torslanda plant in Sweden, which currently is one of its largest production sites (chiefly large cars and SUVs). Then in 1965, the Ghent, Belgium plant was opened, which is the company&#x27;s second largest production site. This was also Volvo&#x27;s first location producing cars within the European Economic Community. In 1989, the Uddevalla plant in Sweden was opened, which was jointly operated by Volvo Car Group and Pininfarina Sverige AB from 2005 to 2013.


In the early 1970s, Volvo acquired the passenger car division of the Dutch company DAF, and marketed their small cars as Volvos before releasing the Dutch-built Volvo 340, which went on to be a big seller in the UK market in the 1980s. In 1986 Volvo sold 113,267 cars in the US marking a record year for the company. The appearance of Japanese brands like Acura and Lexus and the growing popularity of Subaru station wagons in subsequent years meant the loss of a significant market share for Volvo, one which they have never regained.

Volvo&#x27;s long-time CEO Pehr G. Gyllenhammar saw early on that Volvo was too small to survive in the future, and attempted several times to merge with other manufacturers. Volvo nearly merged with Saab in the late seventies, while in 1978 an aborted affair would have seen the Norwegian state take over 40 percent of the company. In return, Volvo would receive 200 million SEK and a ten percent concession in the Oseberg oil field. Major institutional actors in Sweden opposed the deal and blocked it. A deal to merge with Renault was blocked in 1993, mainly opposed by a Swedish stockholders&#x27; association.

A collection of Volvo&#x27;s most important historical vehicles are now housed in the Volvo Museum, which opened in a permanent location in Arendal at Hisingen on 30 May 1995. For several years, the collection had been housed at the Blue Hangar, at the then closed Torslanda Airport.

In 1999, Volvo Group decided to sell its automobile manufacturing business in order to concentrate on commercial vehicles, and to buy a 5% stake in Japanese automaker Mitsubishi Motors (with which Volvo Group along with the Dutch government had participated in a joint venture at the former DAF plant in Born, Netherlands since 1991). Ford saw advantages in acquiring a profitable prestige mid-size European automobile manufacturer, well renowned for its safety aspects, as an addition to its Premier Automotive Group. The buyout of Volvo Cars was announced on 28 January 1999, and in the following year the acquisition was completed at a price of US$6.45 billion. As a result of the divestiture, the Volvo trademark was used by two separate companies:

* Volvo Group – a manufacturer of trucks, buses and construction equipment (among others) owned by Swedish interests
* Volvo Car Group or Volvo Cars – a manufacturer of automobiles owned by Ford Motor Company

Volvo Group completed its 5% deal with Mitsubishi in November 1999, but sold its stake back to Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in March 2001.

===Ford era, 1999–2010===

Volvo Car Group was part of Ford Motor Company&#x27;s Premier Automotive Group (PAG), along with Jaguar, Aston Martin and Land Rover. While part of the PAG, the company significantly expanded its range of vehicles. Ford, in turn, attempted with little market success to leverage synergies from Volvo, namely by sharing a re-engineered platform and many safety features from the Volvo S80 with the Ford Five Hundred (et al.).

After Ford sold Jaguar Land Rover to Tata Motors of India in 2008, the company initially decided to keep Volvo Cars despite mounting losses and major economic downturns. Ford decided to restructure plans for Volvo Cars, pushing it further upmarket, alongside the lower end of Mercedes and BMW sedans, wagons, and SUV crossovers. The outcome was the luxurious second generation Volvo S80 and the new small premium crossover Volvo XC60.

When the global economic crisis of 2008 threatened the US automakers, Swedish authorities became concerned about the fate of Volvo, should Ford file for bankruptcy. These concerns mounted after repeated mass-layoffs at Volvo. In December 2008, Ford announced that it was considering selling Volvo Cars. Initially, a sale price of US$6 billion was reported. Ford said it was also looking into the possibility of spinning off Volvo as an independent company. The Swedish government was asked to look into a possible state ownership of Volvo, or a financial bailout for Volvo Cars and SAAB of GM. Former parent AB Volvo agreed to help Volvo cut costs through partnerships, and suggested taking part in a shared ownership of Volvo Cars, as part of a larger consortium. Other rumored candidates to purchase Volvo Cars included BMW AG of Germany, Investor AB of Sweden, Chinese investors, and Russian investors.

Although it was rumoured that Volkswagen would buy Volvo Cars, and despite initial denials, the company Geely Holding Group was ultimately selected to take over the Swedish automaker. Geely Holding allegedly bid about US$1.5 billion to take over Volvo, with Goldman Sachs investing HK$2.59 billion (US$334 million) in the holding company.

===Geely era, 2010–present===

Ford Motor Company offered Volvo Cars for sale in December 2008, after suffering losses that year. On 28 October 2009, Ford confirmed that, after considering several offers, the preferred buyer of Volvo Cars was Geely Holding Group, the parent of motor manufacturer Geely Automobile. On 23 December 2009, Ford confirmed the terms of the sale to Geely had been settled. A definitive agreement was signed on 28 March 2010, for billion. The European Commission and China&#x27;s Ministry of Commerce approved the deal on 6 and 29 July 2010, respectively. The deal closed on 2 August 2010 with Geely paying $1.3 billion cash and a $200 million note. Further payments are expected with a later price &quot;true-up&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;www.ford.com/about-ford/news-announcements&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It is the largest overseas acquisition by a Chinese automaker.

Stefan Jacoby, formerly chief executive of Volkswagen of America, became Volvo Car Group&#x27;s president and chief executive on 16 August 2010, replacing Stephen Odell, who became chief executive of Ford Europe. Li Shufu became Volvo Cars&#x27; chairman of the board. His board members include vice-chairman Hans-Olov Olsson, a former president and chief executive of Volvo Cars, and Håkan Samuelsson, formerly chief executive of MAN.

Under Geely ownership, Volvo has refocused its product lineup. The manufacturer has developed a new line of 3- and 4-cylinder diesel and petrol engines while eliminating larger engines. It has also developed a new vehicle platform, the Scalable Product Architecture (SPA), and re-introduced an expanded -90 series of models, including the S90 sedan and Volvo V90 wagon in addition to a redesigned XC90 SUV.

In 2015, Volvo sold more than half a million cars for the first time in its 89-year history.
Volvo reported strong sales from all three core global regions. Sales in Europe rose 10% in 2015 to 269k, representing over 50% of total global volume. Volvo&#x27;s revival in the US gained momentum, with sales up 24% in 2015, while China was flat amid a challenging sales environment, but sales were up 11% in the fourth quarter.

In July 2017, the automaker announced that beginning in 2019, all of its new models will include an electric motor in their powertrain. Implementation of the announcement could mean Volvo becoming the first manufacturer to end production of internal combustion-only vehicles, with all vehicles hybrid or electric powered. Between 2019 and 2021, Volvo plans to launch three electric cars under the Volvo brand and two more under the Polestar performance brand.

Volvo is one of the proponents of autonomous vehicles. On 20 November 2017, Uber announced that it planned to buy up to 24,000 Volvo cars designed to accept autonomous technology between 2019 and 2021. This non-binding intent includes a plan for Uber Advanced Technologies Group to design and build the self-driving system in the XC90 SUV. In 2016, the companies announced that they planned to collaborate on the design and financing of cars with self-driving systems. Such vehicles require a different type of steering and braking mechanism, as well as sensors. The CEO of Volvo Cars, Håkan Samuelsson, made this comment in an interview: &quot;We get support developing this car ... It’s also a big commercial deal.&quot;

Also in 2017, Volvo announced a vehicle subscription offering called Care by Volvo, which offers the Volvo XC40 for a monthly payment that includes insurance and maintenance. Care by Volvo is offered in several European markets, such as Germany, the UK and Italy, as well as in the U.S.

In February 2020, Volvo and Geely announced that they had started formal discussions about a merger of business. Geely had owned 100% of Volvo, but Volvo Cars had largely been allowed autonomy with its resources. These merger talks were later halted, and 18% of Volvo Cars shares were listed on the Nasdaq Stockholm stock exchange in October 2021.

In early 2021 the company announced plans to completely stop selling fossil fuel-based cars by 2030, switching to electric-powered cars. The plan includes phasing out fossil-fuel-only cars by 2025, manufacturing only electric cars or hybrids.

In 2021, Volvo Cars set up a joint venture with Geely for its hybrid engine operations. The new business, Aurobay will develop and market powertrain solutions, and as of 2022, includes Volvo Cars&#x27; engine plants in Skövde and Zhangjiakou, together with its powertrain research and development operations in Gothenburg.

In June 2023, Ukraine blacklisted Geely due to its refusal to leave the Russian market. In this regard, the Swedish authorities began to discuss the possibility of a boycott of Volvo Cars. The discussion was initiated by the Ministry of Defense of Sweden.

In November 2023, Volvo Cars announced the launch of an Energy Solutions business, beginning with a vehicle-to-grid (V2G) pilot programme in Gothenburg along with local power utility Goteborg Energi.

In 2024, Volvo Cars scrapped its goal of becoming fully electric by 2030, adjusting its strategy due to industry challenges.

In November 2024, Volvo Cars announced the sale of its 30&amp;% stake in Lynk &amp; Co to Zeekr, at a price of RMB 5.4 billion.

==Safety==

Volvo cars have long been marketed as safe and the company has stressed their historic reputation for solidity and reliability in marketing campaigns. Volvo uses high-tech safety systems as standard equipment in new vehicles. Prior to strong government safety regulation Volvo had been at the forefront of safety engineering.

In 1944, laminated glass was introduced in the PV model. After Vattenfall engineers presented their pioneering work to Volvo in the 1950s, Volvo engineer Nils Bohlin invented and patented the modern three-point safety belt, which became standard on all Volvo cars in 1959, and then made this design patent open in the interest of safety and made it available to other car manufacturers for free. Additionally, Volvo developed the first rear-facing child seat in 1964 and introduced its own booster seat in 1978.

In 1991, the 960 introduced the first three-point seat belt for the middle of the rear seat and a child safety cushion integrated in the middle armrest. Also in 1991, it introduced the Side Impact Protection System (SIPS) on the 700, 940/960 and 850 models, which channels the force of a side impact away from the doors and into the safety cage.

In 1994, to add to its SIPS, Volvo was the first to introduce side airbags and installed them as standard equipment in all models from 1995. At the start of the 1995 model year, side impact protection airbags were standard on high trim-level Volvo 850s, and optional on other 850s. By the middle of the production year, they were standard on all 850s. In model year 1995, SIPS airbags became standard on all Volvo models.

In 1995, the Volvo 745 was recalled as the front seatbelt mounts could break in a collision.

In 1998, Volvo installed a head-protecting airbag, which was made standard in all new models as well as some existing models. The IC head-protecting airbag was not available on the 1997 C70 since the initial design deployed the airbag from the roof, and the C70, being a convertible, could not accommodate such an airbag. A later version of the C70 featured a head-protecting airbag deploying upwards from the door, avoiding this problem. It has been stated by many testing authorities that side head protecting curtain airbags can reduce the risk of death in a side impact by up to 40% and brain injury by up to 55%, as well as protect occupants during a rollover. In 1998, Volvo introduced its Whiplash Protection System (WHIPS), a safety device to prevent injury to front seat users during collisions.

In 2002, Volvo pioneered the development of a virtual crash test dummy representing a midsized pregnant female. It was named Linda and was modeled in her 36th week of pregnancy to analyze the effects of high-speed impact on the womb, placenta, and fetus. Collaborating with Chalmers University of Technology, they also crafted a computer model of an average-sized female to advance their Whiplash Protection System (WHIPS).

In 2004, Volvo introduced the Blind Spot Information System (BLIS), which detects vehicles entering the vehicle&#x27;s blind spot with a side-view-mirror-mounted camera, and alerts the driver with a light. That year also saw Volvos sold in all markets equipped with side-marker lights and daytime running lights. Also, since 2004 all Volvo models except for the coupes (C70 and C30) are available with an all-wheel drive system developed by Haldex Traction of Sweden.

In 2005, Volvo presented the second generation of Volvo C70, which came with extra stiff door-mounted inflatable side curtains (the first of its kind in a convertible) dubbed &#x27;DMIC&#x27;.

Volvo&#x27;s safety systems remained standard on all Volvo vehicles while under ownership of Ford Motor Company. Volvo had patented many of its safety innovations, including SIPS, WHIPS, ROPS, DSTC, and body structures. Some of these systems were fitted to other Ford and Premier Automotive Group vehicles in forms similar to those of Volvo systems.

A 2005 Folksam report, put the 740/940 (from 1982 on) in the 15% better than average category, the second from the top category.

In 2005, when the American non-profit, non-governmental Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) released its first annual &quot;Top Safety Picks&quot; vehicles list, none of Volvo&#x27;s offered vehicles in the US were included on the list.
According to Russ Rader, a spokesman for IIHS, Volvo lagged behind its competitors. Dan Johnston, a Volvo spokesman, denied that the company&#x27;s vehicles were any less safe than the institute&#x27;s top-rated vehicles, adding that

In 2006, Volvo&#x27;s Personal Car Communicator (PCC) remote control was launched as an optional feature with the all-new Volvo S80. Before a driver enters their car, they can review the security level and know whether they had set the alarm and if the car is locked. Additionally, a heartbeat sensor warns if someone is hiding inside the car. The S80 was also the first Volvo model to feature adaptive cruise control (ACC) with Collision Warning and Brake Support (CWBS).

In 2008, a French court found Volvo partially responsible for causing the death of two children and serious injuries of another in Wasselonne on 17 June 1999, when the brakes of a 1996 Volvo 850 failed. The court subjected Volvo to a €200,000 fine.

According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), Volvo&#x27;s S80 became one of the 2009 Top Safety Picks Award winners. The previous versions of the S40 and S60 models (2005–09 models with standard side airbags) failed to attain the highest rating in their side impact test. However, according to the IIHS, in recent years Volvo cars have still managed to maintain their high class safety ratings as seen in test results. The Volvo XC90, S80, C70, XC60, S60 and C30 are all rated Top Safety Picks in these crash tests. The 2014 models of the XC60, XC90, S60 and S80 have even received the Top Safety Pick+ rating. All Volvos tested in the small overlap test have received a &#x27;good&#x27; rating.

Volvo has also scored high in Euro NCAP tests. Since 2009, all the Volvo models that Euro NCAP have tested have received five-star safety ratings: Volvo C30, V40, V60, V60 plug-in hybrid, XC60 and V70. The second generation Volvo V40 got the best test result of any car model ever tested by Euro NCAP at the time. As well the redesigned XC60 received the highest adult occupant score (98%) in 2017.

In the United States, Volvo paid $19.6 million in fines for missing its Corporate Average Fuel Economy targets for the 2010–2014 model years. In July 2017, Volvo announced that new models launched from 2019 onward would be fully electric or hybrid-electric, heralding the end of production of nearly a century of Volvo vehicles powered solely by the internal combustion engine. Volvo, however, will continue to produce non-electric, non-hybrid cars from models introduced before that year but will discontinue them once the non-hybrid, non-electric cars receive a facelift or complete redesign. In 2019, Volvo announced that it plans to produce only electrified cars from the year 2040 onwards.

In 2019, Volvo introduced the E.V.A. (Equal Vehicles for All) Initiative which aims to share the results of research and safety development since 1970. This initiative&#x27;s goal is to contribute to safer cars for everyone - regardless of gender and size. Due to the traditional use of male crash test dummies in safety tests, women face a higher risk of injury in car accidents. Volvo&#x27;s Accident Research Team, however, has been collecting real-world collision data since the 1970s, ensuring representation for both men and women.

===Tri-digit nomenclature===
Starting with the 140 series in 1966, Volvo used a tri-digit system for their cars. The first number was the series, the second number the number of cylinders and the third number the number of doors; so a 164 was a 1-series with a six-cylinder engine and four doors. However, there were exceptions to this rule – the 780 for example, came with turbocharged I4 and naturally aspirated V6 petrol engines and I6 diesel engines, but never an eight-cylinder, as the &quot;eight&quot; would suggest. Similarly, the 760 often was equipped with a turbocharged I4 engine, and the Volvo 360 only had four cylinders. Some 240GLT had a V6 engine. The company dropped the meaning of the final digit for later cars like the 740, but the digit continued to identify cars underhood on the identification plate.

===Current models===
Today, the company uses a system of letters denoting body style followed by the series number. &quot;S&quot; stands for &quot;sedan&quot;, &quot;C&quot; stands for &quot;coupé&quot; or &quot;convertible&quot; (including three-door hatchback AKA &quot;shooting brake&quot;) and &quot;V&quot; stands for &quot;versatile&quot; (5-door hatchback and station wagon). A V50 is an estate (also under &quot;V&quot;) that is smaller than the V70. &quot;XC&quot; stands for &quot;cross country&quot; originally added to a more rugged V70 model as the V70XC and indicates all wheel drive paired with a raised suspension to give it an SUV look. Volvo would later change the name to the &quot;XC70&quot; in keeping with its car naming consistent with the XC90.

Originally, Volvo was planning a different naming scheme. S and C were to be the same, but &quot;F&quot;, standing for &quot;flexibility&quot;, was to be used on station wagons. When Volvo introduced the first generation S40 and V40 in 1995, they were announced as the S4 and F4. However, Audi complained that it had inherent rights to the S4 name, since it names its sporty vehicles &quot;S&quot;, and the yet to be introduced sport version of the Audi A4 would have the S4 name. Volvo agreed to add a second digit, so the vehicles became the S40 and F40. However, that led to another complaint from Ferrari, who used the Ferrari F40 name on their legendary sports car. This led to Volvo switching the &quot;F&quot; to &quot;V&quot;, for versatile.

==Alternative propulsion==

In 2019, Volvo announced that it plans to produce only fully electrified cars from the year 2040 onwards. From 2040, it plans to no longer produce internal combustion engine powered vehicles. In March 2021, Volvo doubled down on these plans and committed to being an electric-only car maker by 2030.


===Flexible-fuel vehicles===

In 2005, Volvo introduced to the Swedish market the company&#x27;s first E85 flexifuel models. Volvo introduced its S40 and V50 with flexible-fuel engines, joined in late 2006 by the then new C30. All Volvo models were initially restricted to the Swedish market, until 2007, when these three models were launched in eight new European markets. In 2008, Volvo launched the V70 with a 2.5-litre turbocharged flexifuel engine.

===Plug-in hybrids===

The Volvo ReCharge is a plug-in hybrid concept car with an all-electric range (AER) of . It was officially unveiled at the 2007 Frankfurt Auto Show.

On 1 June 2009, Volvo announced the launching of series production diesel-electric plug-in hybrids by 2012. The company plans to sell a series hybrid with the goal of achieving emissions of less than 50 grams of CO2 per kilometer. As part of a joint venture with Vattenfall, a Swedish energy company, Volvo converted two Volvo V70 to plug-in hybrid demonstrators that have been in field testing in Göteborg, Sweden since December 2009. Vattenfall offered customers participating in this trial the supply of renewable electricity generated from wind power or hydropower. Among other challenges, this test has allowed to experience the all-electric range at low temperatures, which has been a disadvantage of plug-in vehicles.

===Electric car===

The Volvo C30 DRIVe Electric concept car was exhibited at the 2010 Paris Motor Show and Volvo announced that field testing will begin in 2011, in the US, Europe, and China. The C30 DRIVe electric car has a lithium-ion battery, a top speed of , and an all-electric range of up to . Field testing began in 2010 with 10 units in Göteborg, Sweden.

===Gas-turbine Hybrid===

The Volvo ECC (Environmental Concept Car) was exhibited at the 1992 Paris Motor Show. The vehicles range on batteries alone was 90 miles (140 km), and when combined with a full tank of fuel for the turbine, about 415 miles (668 km).

===Drive-E engines===
Starting in the 2015 model year (Volvo S60, V60, and XC60), Volvo introduced a line of forced-induction four-cylinder engines, dubbed &quot;Drive-E&quot;, to increase the efficiency of their models without sacrificing performance. These engines also debuted throughout the lineup that year, and also appeared in the second-generation Volvo XC90. Hybridized versions of these engines would, in theory, have enough power to match eight-cylinder engines.

==Motorsport==


In 1959, Volvo had set up its own motorsport department. This led to Volvo enjoying worldwide success in the motorsport arena throughout the early 1960s. In 1961, Gran Premio de Argentina Gunnar Andersson was appointed Volvo&#x27;s competition department manager, signing a number of drivers, including Carl-Magnus Skogh, Tom Trana and Ewy Rosqvist, though he himself still continued to compete in rallies. In 1964, Volvo made heavy investments in the Safari Rally, entering four Volvo PV544s in the 1964 competition. A PV544, borrowed from Volvo and then modified and driven by Joginder and Jaswant Singh won the Safari Rally in 1965.

Volvo entered the European Touring Car Championship with the Volvo 240 Turbo in the 1980s. In the 1984 European Touring Car Championship, the Swedish team Sportpromotion won the EG Trophy at Zolder circuit, followed by placing second in the Mugello. In 1985, Volvo signed Swiss engine guru Ruedi Eggenberger to run its works team through Eggenberger Motorsport. Team drivers Gianfranco Brancatelli and Thomas Lindström led the 240T to victory in the 1985 ETCC.

Also in 1985, New Zealander Mark Petch had purchased a 240T from the Magnum team in Sweden (and claimed to run the only privateer Volvo 240T outside of Europe), and drivers Robbie Francevic and Michel Delcourt had also won the Wellington 500 street race in New Zealand in January. Francevic went on to finish 5th in the 1985 Australian Touring Car Championship, taking wins at Symmons Plains and Oran Park. The factory-supported Petch team also participated in the 1985 Bathurst 1000. Thomas Lindström later joined Francevic to win the 1986 Wellington 500. The Petch team become the Volvo Dealer Team in 1986, and expanded to two cars, with the other being for John Bowe, who had driven the Volvo with Francevic at the 1985 Bathurst 1000.

Volvo contracted Belgian based team RAS Sport to be its works team in the ETCC in 1986, following Eggenberger moving to race Ford Sierra&#x27;s. This team included defending champion Lindström, joined by ex-Formula One and Grand Prix motorcycle racer Johnny Cecotto, as well as Ulf Granberg and Anders Olofsson. The team took wins at wins at Hockenheim, Anderstorp, Brno, Österreichring and Zolder, though the wins at Anderstorp and the Österreichring were disqualified due to the use of illegal fuel.

The 240T also entered the Guia Race, part of the Macau Grand Prix in 1985, 1986 and 1987, winning in both 1985 and 1986.

Volvo also saw success in the Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft (German Touring Car Championship), with a 240 Turbo driven by Per Stureson winning the 1985 DTM.

Volvo also entered the British Touring Car Championship in the 1990s with Tom Walkinshaw Racing. This partnership was responsible for the controversial 850 Estate racing cars, driven by Rickard Rydell and Jan Lammers and with a best qualifying placing of third and a best race finish of fifth, which was only rendered uncompetitive when the FIA allowed the use of aerodynamic aids in 1995. TWR then built and ran the works 850 Saloon, with six wins in 1995, and five wins in 1996, and a S40, with one win in 1997 in the BTCC, as well as Volvo placing third in the Manufacturers Championship, both in 1995 and 1996. In 1998, TWR Volvo won the British Touring Car Championship with Rickard Rydell driving the S40R.

Volvo also competed in the Super Touring category with the 850 across Europe and in Australia. Australian race car driver Peter Brock drove an 850 T5 with Tony Scott in the 1994 James Hardie 12 Hour production car race at Bathurst, finishing 25th. He also drove an 850 saloon in the 1996 Australian Super Touring Championship, placing sixth in the Drivers’ Championship.

Volvo regularly entered the S60 in the Swedish Touring Car Championship, where it finished 2nd in the drivers&#x27; championship twice and won the manufacturers&#x27; title once. The S60 continued to be raced after the formation of the Scandinavian Touring Car Championship, a merger of the Swedish and Danish touring car championships. Thed Björk won three consecutive titles from 2013 to 2015, driving an S60 prepared by Polestar Racing.

From 2002 to 2007, there was an S60 one-make racing series as a support series to the Swedish Touring Car Championship known as the S60 Challenge Cup, using 26 factory-modified S60s.

An S60 was driven by Robert Dahlgren in the Swedish round of the 2007 World Touring Car Championship.

The first generation S60 made its competitive debut in 2006, racing in the Speed World Challenge GT class. The second-generation model was introduced for the 2009 season. In 2010, its programme was expanded to include the SCAA Pro Racing World Challenge, where it won both the drivers&#x27; and manufacturers&#x27; championships in the GT class. The programme was expanded again in 2011, to include the Pirelli World Challenge.

In 2008, Volvo entered the Swedish Touring Car Championship with a C30 powered by bioethanol E85 fuel. Robert Dahlgren and Tommy Rustad were the drivers, finishing 5th and 10th respectively in the championship. Volvo had also signalled their intentions to enter the 2009 British Touring Car Championship with the same car.

Volvo entered the V8 Supercars Championship with two S60s in 2014 with Garry Rogers Motorsport, and were immediately competitive. Following ten pole positions and four race wins, Scott McLaughlin finished fifth in the championship and was awarded the Barry Sheene Medal.

==Marketing==
The name Volvo is Latin for &quot;I roll&quot;.

===Logo===
The Volvo symbol is an ancient chemistry sign for iron. The iron sign is used to symbolize the strength of iron used in the car as Sweden is known for its quality iron. The diagonal line (a strip of metal) across the grille came about to hold the actual symbol, a circle with an arrow, in front of the radiator.

===Sponsorship===

Volvo has, since the 1950s, had special international sales programs for customers assigned abroad, for example Diplomat Sales, Military Sales and Expat Sales.

The Volvo trademark is now jointly owned (50/50) by Volvo Group and Volvo Car Group. One of the main promotional activities for the brand is the sailing Race Volvo Ocean Race, formerly known as the &quot;Whitbread Around the World Race&quot;. There is also a Volvo Baltic Race and Volvo Pacific Race, and Volvo likes to encourage its image by sponsoring golf tournaments all over the world including major championship events called the Volvo Masters and Volvo China Open.

Volvo sponsored the Volvo Ocean Race, the world&#x27;s leading round-the-world yacht race for the first time in 2001–02. The next edition was to take place between 2011 and 2012. Volvo has also had a long-standing commitment to the International Sailing Federation (ISAF) and is involved in the Volvo/ISAF World Youth Sailing Championships since 1997.

In 2011, Volvo Cars is the main sponsor of the winter sports and music festival Snowbombing in Austria.

In 2012, Volvo signed NBA star Jeremy Lin to an endorsement agreement for two years to participate in Volvo&#x27;s corporate and marketing activities as a &quot;brand ambassador&quot; for Volvo Car Corp.

In 2015, Volvo signed a deal with Chennaiyin FC, a football franchise team of the Indian Super League as a side shirt sponsor.

===Video games===

In May 2009, &quot;Volvo – The Game&quot; was released. It was developed by Simbin Studios (now Sector3 Studios).

==Volvo trademark lawsuit==

In 1990, Volvo Cars filed a lawsuit against Hong Kong-based Club Volvo night club for infringement in Hong Kong High Court. The lawsuit ended with settlement where the night club paid 1 dollar to Volvo Cars. Since then, Club Volvo had been renamed to Club Borubo (the Japanese pronunciation of &quot;Volvo&quot;), and then Club Bboss (reference to Big Boss).

<doc id="389615" wikidata="Q1455871" url="?curid=389615" title="Child care">
<text>Childcare, also known as day care, is the care and supervision of one or more children, typically ranging from two weeks to 18 years old. Although most parents spend a significant amount of time caring for their child(ren), childcare typically refers to the care provided by caregivers who are not the child&#x27;s parents. Childcare is a broad topic that covers a wide spectrum of professionals, institutions, contexts, activities, and social and cultural conventions. Early childcare is an important and often overlooked component of child development.

A variety of people and organizations are able to care for children. The child&#x27;s extended family may also take on this caregiving role. Another form of childcare is that of center-based childcare. In lieu of familial caregiving, these responsibilities may be given to paid caretakers, orphanages or foster homes to provide care, housing, and schooling.

Professional caregivers work within the context of center-based care (including crèches, daycare, preschools and schools) or a home-based care (nannies or family daycare). The majority of child care institutions available require child care providers to have extensive training in first aid and be CPR certified. In addition, background checks, drug testing at all centers, and reference verifications are normally a requirement. Child care can consist of advanced learning environments that include early childhood education or elementary education. The objective of the program of daily activities at a child care facility should be to foster age appropriate learning and social development. In many cases the appropriate child care provider is a teacher or person with educational background in child development, which requires a more focused training aside from the common core skills typical of a child caregiver.

As well as these licensed options, parents may also choose to find their own caregiver or arrange childcare exchanges/swaps with another family.

Access to and quality of childcare have a variety of implications for children, parents and guardians, and families. Child care can have long-term impacts on educational attainment for children. Parents, particularly women and mothers, see increased labor force attachment when child care is more accessible and affordable. In particular, increased affordable child care opportunities have economic benefits for immigrant communities and communities of color.

==Overview==
Childcare varies dramatically across cultures. While many global communities prefer children aged 7–10 for designated caregiving responsibilities, children no younger than 12 are preferred in the Western world, where paid childcare is common. For example, very young children in Zaire regularly use machetes safely and skillfully while American middle-class adults do not trust their young children with knives. Child development is not just biological or psychological—it is also a cultural process and it is not universal. In countries where children are given more responsibility the adults serve as &quot;occasional supervisors,&quot; and children take pride in their responsibilities.

Therefore, an important aspect of childcare is considering the cultural differences and accepted behaviors in differing households. Children should be able to retain their cultural tradition and norms, while also being exposed to other cultures.

==Childcare by country ==

===Australia===
Australia has a large childcare industry, but in many locations (especially in inner-city suburbs of large cities and in rural areas), the availability is limited and the waiting periods can be up to several years. The Australian Government&#x27;s Child Care Subsidy scheme provides assistance with child care costs, but this still leaves many families with a large out of pocket expense. The median weekly cost of center-based long day care in 2013 was approximately A$364 which puts it out of the reach of lower income earners.

Regulation is governed by the Australian Children&#x27;s Education &amp; Care Quality Authority (ACECQA), a federal government body, which acts as a central body for the state bodies. As of 2021, minimum supervision ratios of educators to children were 1:4 for infants, 1:5 for 2–3 years old (except for VIC – 1:4), 1:10 for preschoolers in NSW, TAS and WA, and 1:11 for preschoolers in ACT, NT, QLD, SA and VIC.

All childcare workers must have, or be undertaking, the minimum Certificate III in Children&#x27;s Services in order to work in a center (Recognition of Prior Learning is available to help qualify staff with many years experience, but no qualifications). (Common more advanced qualifications are &#x27;Diploma of Children&#x27;s Services&#x27; and an Early Childhood Education degree).

Rules differ between states regarding family day care in Australia. To start a Family Day Care business in Victoria, an educator should be either have a Certificate III in Children&#x27;s Services or be actively working towards the same. Additionally, a current police check, current first aid training and insurance (specifically for family day care) are necessary for starting a family day care. The house should be safe for children. A group of 15 educators works under one Supervisor who must have a Diploma in Children&#x27;s Services.

In Australia, Nannies are also a viable childcare option for many families, although they do not currently reap the benefits of the Government Child Care Subsidy. Nannies often offer many styles of services, including casual and permanent nannies, as well as au pairs and overnight nannies.

===Canada===

Canada offers both private and subsidized daycare centers. Some shortages of subsidized openings can lengthen the time needed to find a suitable childcare provider. To counter this, government or private enterprises sometimes enable parents to look for available spaces online.

A 2008 article in &quot;The Star&quot; said that not-for-profits are much more likely to produce the high quality environments in which children thrive.&quot;

Local governments, often municipalities, may operate non-profit day care centers.

For all providers, the largest expense is labor. Local legislation may regulate the operation of daycare centers, affecting staffing requirements. In Canada, the workforce is predominantly female (95%) and low paid, averaging only 60% of average workforce wage. Some jurisdictions require licensing or certification. Legislation may specify details of the physical facilities (washroom, eating, sleeping, lighting levels, etc.).

In 2021, in reflection on the circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Canadian government reflected upon the benefits and values of child care on child development and economic growth. As such, the government made it a goal to decrease the cost of child care. This policy change is reflected in the 2021 Canadian budget, which invests up to $8.3 billion for child care services for early learning and for indigenous communities.

===Denmark===
In Denmark most daycares accept children ranging from 6 months old to three years old. 91.2% of one- and two-year-old children are enrolled in different types of daycare institutions. Most of these are managed by a municipality and mostly government funded. The different types of institutions ranges from separate day-care institutions (&quot;Vuggestue&quot;), kindergartens with a daycare department (&quot;Integrerede institutioner&quot;) and in-home day-care (&quot;Dagpleje&quot;).

The daycares are play-based focusing on the children&#x27;s perspective and involvement in day-to-day life. The day-cares are staffed by trained social educators or pedagogues (&quot;pædagog&quot;).

The Danish government claims that most families in Denmark take advantage of the guaranteed access to center-based child care in the county. These institutions for child care in Denmark include those run by municipalities and some private facilities. Some facilities are not centered in a child care facility but in the home of a woman who is not a professional child care administrator. Certain scholars and individuals accredit the near universal participation in the Danish child care system as a model that other countries should follow in order to increase educational attainment and equality. Danish policies that support families also include parental leave programs.

=== France ===
Childcare systems in France put great value into childcare providers having received a certain level of formal education in order to properly care for children. They have two separate branches of early childhood childcare. These two branches are called crèche and école maternelle. Crèche is the program for infants and toddlers and école maternelle is part of the education system. They both require teachers to have a college degree with an occasional specialized degree on top of that.

France also couples public child care services with private and family child care services. These services are part of the 3.6% of the French GDP spent on family policies. Services in France are offered to people with full-time French residence and people whose children are vaccinated.

===Germany===
In Germany, preschool education is the domain of the &quot;Kindertagesstätte&quot; (literally &quot;children&#x27;s day site&quot;, often shortened to &quot;Kita&quot; or &quot;KITA&quot;), which is usually divided into the &quot;Kinderkrippe&quot; (crèche) for toddlers (age up to three years) and the &quot;Kindergarten&quot; for children who are older than three years and before school. Children in their last Kindergarten year may be grouped into a &quot;Vorschule&quot; (&quot;preschool&quot;) and given special pedagogic attention; special preschool institutions comparable to the US-American kindergarten are the exception.

Kitas are typically run by public (i.e., communal) and &quot;free&quot; carriers (such as the churches, other religious organizations, social organizations with a background in the trade unions, and profit-orientated corporations), and subsidized by the states (&quot;Länder&quot;). In this case, the care is open to the general public—e.g., a Protestant or Muslim child may claim a place in a Kita run by the catholic church.

Preschool education, unlike school and university, is not in the exclusive domain of the states. The federal government regulates daycare through the &quot;Kinder- und Jugendhilfegesetz (KJHG)&quot;, which stipulates a legal claim to daycare:
* for children over the age of three and before school (i.e., kindergarten; this law became effective in 1996)
* for children under the age of three and before Kindergarten (i.e., Kinderkrippe; this law becomes effective 1 August 2013)

Alternative daycare can be provided through &quot;Tagespflegepersonen&quot; (usually &quot;Tagesmütter&quot;, &quot;day mothers&quot;), i.e., stay-at-home parents who provide commercial daycare to other children. This form of daycare is also federally regulated through the KJHG.

Preschool education (&quot;Frühpädagogik&quot;) is increasingly seen as an integral part of education as a whole; several states, such as Bavaria have released detailed educational plans for daycare carriers who claim state subsidies. &quot;Early pedagogics&quot; has increasingly moved into the academic domain, with an increasing number of staff being trained at universities of applied science (&quot;Fachhochschulen&quot;) and regular universities. Non-academic personnel in daycare facilities have usually attended specialized schools for several years. In the state of Bavaria for example, daycare assistants (&quot;Kinderpfleger&quot;) will have attended school for two years and daycare teachers (&quot;Erzieher&quot;) for three years with an additional two-year internship.

===India===

India has a system of universal childcare which is free and provided by the state through the Integrated Child Development Services. It provides food, preschool education, primary healthcare, immunization, contraceptive counselling, health check-up and referral services to children under 6 years of age and their mothers. For nutritional purposes ICDS provides 500 kilocalories (with 12–15 gm  grams of protein) every day to every child below 6 years of age. For adolescent girls it is up to 500 kilo calories with up to 25 grams of protein every day. The services of Immunisation, Health Check-up and Referral Services are delivered through Public Health Infrastructure under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. During the 2018–19 fiscal year, free childcare cost the state . 
Additionally, private childcare services also exist in the country for wealthier families.

In 2008, the GOI adopted the World Health Organization standards for measuring and monitoring child growth and development, both for the ICDS and the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM). Since 1997, WHO has conducted an extensive study of six developing nations to develop these standards. They are known as the New WHO Child Growth Standard and measure the physical growth, nutritional status, and motor development of children from birth to 5 years of age. Despite increasing funding over the past three decades, the ICDS fell short of its stated objectives and still faces a number of challenges. Also, though it has widespread coverage, operational gaps mean that service delivery is not consistent in quality and quantity across the country. The World Bank has highlighted certain key shortcomings of the programme including the inability to target girl child improvements, the participation of wealthier children more than the poorer children, and the lowest level of funding for the poorest and most undernourished states of India. Additionally, private childcare services also exist in the country for wealthier families.

===Japan===
Licensed childcare in Japan falls under the jurisdiction of Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, but each licensed daycare facilities are run by private or public organizations, which are licensed and inspected by the local prefectural, ordinance city, or core city governments.

Japan has a universal childcare system and childcare is free or relatively affordable as the national government provides subsidies and a framework for working families. Based on household incomes and the number of children in need of childcare, local municipal governments set fee schedules for childcare for children under the age of 2. The second child who needs care receives a 50% discount, and the third child or low-income households do not pay any fees. Licensed childcare for ages 3 to 5 is free for a single parent or when both parents are working. The national government only covers the cost of the core childcare program and does not cover the cost of transportation, special activities, meals or snacks, although meals and snacks are partially covered for low-income households.

Parents apply to licensed childcare in Japan through a single point of access by visiting their local municipal government, which handles all the payments and manages the master waiting list for the neighbourhood. The waiting list is not on a first-come, first-served basis but rather a priority list based on the points system. A child from single-parent families, parents with illness or disabilities, and low-income households is typically prioritized over children from other households.

Because of the popularity for licensed childcare and the increasing number of women in the workforce, many children are placed on a waiting list. This is one of the biggest social problems in Japan, known as in larger cities.

As of April 2019, Okinawa had the highest percentage of children on the waitlist at 2.8% of all the applicants (1,702 children), while Tokyo had the largest number of children on the waitlist at 3,690 children (1.19% of applicants). On a nationwide scale, the average percentage of children placed on the waitlist was 0.6% and there was an excess supply of licensed childcare, with 2,679,651 children filling 2,888,159 spots available throughout Japan. Of all children on the waitlist, 63% of applicants resided in larger cities.

The number of &quot;taiki jidō&quot; may not represent the actual numbers as those parents who can afford may choose unlicensed childcare or baby sitters due to a lack of space in the licensed childcare system. Although unlicensed childcare and babysitters are also eligible for government subsidies, a parent must apply with local municipal government for funding and the maximum funding is capped at 37,000 yen per month.

===Mexico===
In Mexico, President Felipe Calderón Hinojosa created a Social Program named &quot;Programa de Estancias Infantiles&quot; that included more than 8,000 daycare spaces for children between 1 and 3.11 years old. This program subsidizes mothers that work and study and also single fathers in a vulnerable situation. It has a great success having more than 125,000 children over the country. This is regulated by the Social Development Minister (Secretaría de Desarrollo Social).

Childcare has been on the rise in Mexico due to the increasing interest it has within the people and the effect it has on the government. This is due to the rise of urban areas in developing countries and the need to keep up with the economic development. There has always been many child care services available but due to the high costs, they were mainly unavailable for the low income families. Childcare became a hot topic of discussion when more women were joining the workforce and the debate of how this would affect how the children would be raised. Another topic of debate is how would the women pay for these expensive services while working minimum wage jobs or having limited times they could work, so the idea of subsidies arose. In specific to the child, the topic of &quot;street children&quot;, how and where children should grow up, was debated, and if they should be allowed to be considered part of the street instead of a particular home. This issue was of great debate because it not only affects the child but also the community the child is in, since they usually seek out public spaces for shelter, food and play. Childcare is generally broken into three general categories such as governmental institutions, religious organizations, and independent agencies (such as NGOS). All of these take on the same objectives which are &quot;containment, paternalist cure approach and street education.&quot;

The creation of childcare programs in Mexico is quite different from others because it focuses on the &quot;defeminization of labor and the defamilization of care.&quot; Female participation is a goal that the government has so it set in place many policies and modes to achieve this. The creation of a successful program of child care has been sought out and many different aspects have been changed over the years but it can be seen that there is an increase in early childhood education and care services (ECEC). ECEC services can be broken down into three different time periods and models which were implemented. The first would be in the 1970s when the Institute for Social Security focuses on covering children for mothers who were covered by Social Security services. This caused a huge gap in the children that could be covered due to the fairly large number of women working in the informal sector and being denied these services. The second stage would be in the early 2000s when the Ministry of Public Education made preschool mandatory for all children from ages 3 to 5. This was useful in theory because all of the children in this age range would be cared for, but in reality caused a strain in the amount of time that the parents had to go and work or dedicate their time elsewhere. The last stage would be in 2007 when the Ministry of Social Development created a childcare program in which was focuses on helping out children and mothers who were not covered by the social security services. This was successful since it targeted low income families specifically. For families to be eligible for this service the mothers had to be working or searching for a job, the income was taken into consideration in comparison to that of minimum wage, and that they did not have any other access to services. Women&#x27;s participation in the workforce and be directly tied to the availability of childcare services and how it would affect their household.

The program that was created in 2007 became known as the Federal Daycare Programme for Working Mothers. This program allowed for subsidized home and community based childcare. The one running the care centers would only have to have a training component, which consisted of a psychological test and training courses to understand the principles of childcare, before being able to open their business in which they would be given money to furnish the facility as necessary for a safe caring center to be created. Another way this program was set into place was by subsidizing the care of non-profits, private for profits, or religious institutions who were based in the area of need.

=== Norway ===
Many children in Norway start daycare between 10 months and 3 years old. Funded parental leave for working parents is either 44 weeks with full pay, or 54 weeks with 80% pay (both up to a certain level only). The government guarantees daycare for all children that are at least 1 year old by 1 August. Coverage is still not 100%, but most regions are getting close (2011). There&#x27;s a maximum price to enable all families to afford it.

The World Economic Forum lauds Norway as one of the best countries to raise a child. Like other Scandinavian countries, Norway has a prominent welfare system that offers family benefits and policies. Norway&#x27;s child care services include a Maternity Package that provides new mothers with products for their new child. Additionally, parents in Norway receive an allowance that can be used on child care. Norway also caps fees for child care in kindergarten at NOK 2,500.

===Spain===
Spain provides paid maternity leave of 16 weeks to mothers and 5 weeks of paternity leave to fathers.

In Spain, beyond maternity leave provisions of four months, families frequently choose to enroll their children in pre-school programs, including about 95–97% of three to four year olds that attend a combination of state and private nurseries. The Spanish government does subsidize child care, and state led childcare services require proof of low income.

===United Kingdom===
In England, childcare is inspected and regulated by His Majesty&#x27;s Inspectors (Office for Standards in Education). Care for children under five is split into childcare on domestic premises (childminding and daycare). In the UK being a &#x27;Childminder&#x27; is a protected title and can only be used by registered professionals. Registered childminders are trained, insured and qualified in Pediatric First Aid. They comply and work with the Early Years Foundation Stage statutory framework provided by the Department for Education. All pupils in the Early Years must follow a programme of education in seven areas, divided into &#x27;prime areas&#x27; and &#x27;specific areas&#x27;.

The three prime areas:
* communication and language
* physical development
* personal, social and emotional development
The four specific areas:
* literacy
* mathematics
* understanding the world
* expressive arts and design

The Early Years Foundation Stage sets the standards that all early years providers must meet to ensure that children learn and develop well and are kept healthy and safe. It promotes teaching and learning to ensure children&#x27;s &#x27;school readiness&#x27; and gives children the broad range of knowledge and skills that provide the right foundation for good future progress through school and life.

Childminders have the same responsibilities for education as nurseries and reception classes. They generally work from their own homes and are always self-employed setting their own terms and conditions. The Professional Association for Childcare &amp; Early Years promotes and supports high-quality child-minding expertise, and provides information for childminders and parents. The UK has a wide range of childcare options, including childminders, day nurseries, playgroups and pre-school education at school. Childcare in both the state and public sector is regulated and registered by the Office for Standards in Education in England and Care Inspectorate Wales for Wales, which operate the application and inspection process for the sector.

Every child in England at the first school term after their third birthday is entitled to 15 hours per week free childcare funding. Childcare is primarily funded by parents after this age, however, the Single Funding Formula (pre-school funding) can be used at some day nurseries, playgroups and schools for a maximum of 5 sessions per week, after a child reaches 3 years. The government introduced childcare vouchers for businesses.

In Scotland Care Commission is responsible for improving care and education for children from birth to age eighteen. Inspection reports include feedback from staff and parents as well as the inspectors, aiming to provide parents and carers information to help them decide whether a particular child care setting is providing good quality child care and meeting government standards.

===United States===
As of 2001, more than one half of the children in the United States attend childcare facilities. This number has increased as the number of working parents has increased. The increase in the number of children that are required to have some sort of childcare service has brought childcare facilities into increasing demand.

State legislation may regulate the number and ages of children allowed before the home is considered an official daycare program and subject to more stringent safety regulations. Each state has different regulations for teacher requirements. In some states, teachers must have an associate degree in child development. States with quality standards built into their licensing programs may have higher requirements for support staff, such as teacher assistants. In Head Start programs, by 2012, all lead teachers must have a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Early Childhood Education. States vary in the standards set for daycare providers, such as teacher-to-child ratios.

If the provider chooses to go through the process, family childcare can also receive national accreditation from the National Association of Family Childcare. National accreditation is only awarded to those programs who demonstrate the quality standards set forth by the NAFCC.

A number of universities and institutions undertake research on child care in the United States, including University of Florida&#x27;s Department of Family, Youth and Community Sciences (IFAS) from 2006, the Public Agenda from 2001, the National Child Care Information and Technical Assistance Center (NCCIC) from 2009, the government resource, Childcare,
 and the IRS Child and Dependent Care Credit information from 2003.

In 1971, the Comprehensive Child Development Act was passed by Congress, but was vetoed by then President Richard Nixon. It &quot;would have created nationally funded child care centers providing early childhood services and after-school care, as well as nutrition, counseling, and even medical and dental care. The centers would charge parents on a sliding scale.&quot; Various proposals have been considered, but to date, none leading to legislation that would establish a national policy supporting day care in the United States.

In 1990, the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 was enacted under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, creating a dedicated federal funding stream for child care subsidies to low-income families.

According to the 1995 U.S. Census Bureau Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), over 36% of families of preschoolers with working mothers primarily relied on childcare in the home of a relative, family daycare provider or other non-relative.

In 1996, the 104th Congress passed The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA), consolidating three federal child care programs previously serving low-income families under the program formerly known as Aid to Families with Dependent Children.

By 2001, child care had become an important aspect of American society, with more than &quot;thirteen million American children under 5 years of age experiencing some form of child care before entering formal school.&quot;

By 2003, almost 26% of families used organized childcare facilities as their primary arrangement.

Economics professor Nancy Folbre reported on a weakness of the Commission for the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress in Paris, saying that one of the major weaknesses of the press coverage of the commission&#x27;s report in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, and &quot;The Financial Times&quot; was the lack of consideration for unpaid work, such as that of family or community members.

In March 2014, the U.S. Senate passed a reauthorization of the Child Care and Development Block Grant program that included &quot;some baseline changes to make sure there’s safe child care&quot;, said Nick Vucic, a senior government affairs associate at Child Care Aware of America.&quot; Child Care Aware of America supported the bill, saying that it is &quot;time to strengthen minimum protections for children,&quot; which they believed the reauthorization and amendments would do. The organization supported having background checks on workers, requiring training basic CPR and health training, and holding unannounced inspections. Afterschool Alliance also supported the bill, saying &quot;it is important to emphasize the value of quality school-age child care to achieve positive outcomes for children, including improved academic performance, work habits and study skills. On 12 September 2014, House and Senate leaders reached a bipartisan agreement to reauthorize the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act. Negotiated by Representatives John Kline (R-MN), George Miller (D-CA), Todd Rokita (R-IN), and David Loebsack (D-IA), and Senators Tom Harkin (D-IA), Lamar Alexander (R-TN), Barbara Mikulski (D-MD), and Richard Burr (R-NC), the agreement will enhance transparency, strengthen health and safety protections, and improve the quality of care. The U.S. House of Representatives passed the amended version of the bill on 15 September 2014.

On 19 November 2014, President Barack Obama signed S.1086, the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 2014 into law.

In addition to the cost of childcare in the United States, the quality of institutions and programs is inferior to other countries. A 2013 &quot;The New Republic&quot; cover story entitled, &quot;The Hell of American Day Care&quot;, said that there are potential benefits and harms related to formal child care.The article cited a National Institute of Child Health Development survey from 2007 that indicated the lack in quality of American healthcare centers.

In the United States—unlike many other developing countries—a full economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic crisis has been &quot;hampered&quot; by one of its &quot;most daunting obstacles&quot;—&quot;America&#x27;s already fragile child-care system&quot;. In a &quot;Bloomberg&quot; interview the University of California, Berkeley&#x27;s Center for the Study of Child Care Employment said that the American child-care system had been &quot;upended&quot;.

In 2023, the average cost of childcare in the U.S. exceeded $13,600 per child-.Census.gov

===New Zealand===

By 2006, New Zealand began to use learning stories as a learning model in their curriculum called &quot;Te Whaariki&quot;. It highlights children&#x27;s learning outcomes as &#x27;disposition&#x27; which are &quot;situated learning strategies plus motivation-participation repertoires from which a learner recognize, selects, edits, responds
to, resists, searches for and constructs learning opportunities&quot;. This was adopted in other places, including Australia. Learning stories are documents that are used by caregivers and educators in childcare settings. They use a storytelling format instead of a traditional &#x27;observation&#x27; report to document the different ways that young children learn, and capture the moment in greater detail and provide parents with a greater insight into the events that occur in their child&#x27;s time in childcare. Learning stories include the story of the child&#x27;s progress, pictures of the experiences, the child&#x27;s strengths, interests and needs, and spaces for parent feedback

==Types==

===In the child&#x27;s home===
At home, care is typically provided by nannies, au pairs, or friends and family. The child is watched inside the home. Depending on the number of children in the home, the children utilizing in-home care could enjoy the greatest amount of interaction with their caregiver, in turn forming a close bond. There are no required licensing or background checks for in-home care, making parental vigilance essential in choosing an appropriate caregiver. Nanny and au pair services provide certified caregivers and the cost of in-home care is the highest of childcare options per child, though a household with many children may find this the most convenient and affordable option. Many nannies study towards childcare qualifications. This training is intended to teach a carer how to create a safe and stimulating environment for children to enjoy and thrive in. Typically, au pairs or nannies provide more than routine child care, often providing assistance with daily household activities, which include running errands, shopping, doing laundry, fixing meals, and cleaning the house.

The most common way to find a nanny is online on dedicated websites specializing in child care services, or through a nanny agency. Nanny agencies may provide a more thorough check of an applicant&#x27;s references and run a criminal background check on the candidate. Depending on local prices, a nanny could be cheaper than putting multiple children in a daycare setting full-time. Proponents believe in-home care may provide stability for the child, due to the fact supervision takes place in an already familiar and comfortable setting for the child. Nannies may also provide care for sick children whereas nurseries typically do not. This enables working parents to continue working instead of leaving to pull a sick child out of day care, which may make in home care ideal for parents who work jobs that they cannot leave, such as nurses. Depending on local laws, some carers can be subject to visits from their local childcare regulatory bodies.

===In the provider&#x27;s home===
Family child care providers care for children in the provider&#x27;s own home. The children could be in a mixed age group with a low adult-to-child ratio. Care can also potentially be personalized and individual. The hours may be more flexible and the provider may offer evening and weekend care for parents who work shifts. The cost of family child care could be significantly lower on average than that of a center.

Child care facilities in the US have the option of becoming accredited. An outside organization is in charge of setting and enforcing this standard. In centers, National Association for the Education of Young Children institutes it. For family child care providers, the National Association of Family Child Care Providers award the credentials.

Licensed or unlicensed home daycare is also referred to as family child care or in-home care. It refers to the care provided to a group of children in the home of a caregiver. State laws differ regarding rules for licensed versus unlicensed care. In Canada, most home daycares are unlicensed, and this is completely lawful. Licensing home daycares in Canada can help greatly with oversight, but at the cost of a large portion of the daycare provider&#x27;s pay. Family child cares are small in size and also have the benefits of flexible hours, lower costs, accessibility, and cultural compatibility. Home-based providers can give more individualized care. In addition, family care generally has a smaller ratio of adults to children in care, allowing for more interaction between child and provider than would be had at a commercial care center. The providers are able to communicate each day with parents on a personal level and share information about the development of the child. Providers care for multi-aged groups of children, allowing children to remain with one caregiver for many years, which helps children develop a sense of trust and security. Multi-aged settings allow children to learn from one another and allow siblings to stay together. Some family child care providers may offer parents more flexibility with hours of operation such as evening, weekend, overnight, and before and after school care.

===Center based childcare===
In a childcare center, teachers focus on the physical and mental developments of their students. In order to have a greater understanding of the student, teachers in centers must incorporate a relationship with their students that benefits their wants and needs while pushing them toward a higher set of values. This type of teaching with a caring relationship will improve a student&#x27;s moral and incidental learning.

Commercial care center also known as daycares, are open for set hours and provide a standardized and regulated system of care for children. Parents may choose from a commercial care center close to their work, and some companies may even offer care at their facilities. Parents may decide the child care facility based on their mission statement and learning objectives they find necessary to be addressed. The child care provider must see how these objectives are most fit for the child and mend them case by case to their specific needs. In setting up activities for these objectives, both indoor and outdoor activities must be taken into account. The parents tend to give their input on what they deem as necessary when the needs of their children may be different. Parents are able to communicate with the staff of these facilities because workers who speak the same native language or language of preference must be available for these conversations.

Active children may thrive in the educational activities provided by a quality commercial care center, but according to the National Center for Early Development and Learning, children from low quality centers may be significantly less advanced in terms of vocabulary and reading skills. Classes are usually largest in this type of care, ratios of children to adult caregivers will vary according to state licensing requirements. Some positive aspects of commercial care are that children may gain a sense of independence, academic achievement, and socialization. Not only is this age crucial for the improvement of their social skills, but also it begins the stages of understanding a classroom setting. Childcare is seen as a reasonable option because it is different from parenting, since it can be seen as more of a routine for the child. Children are placed into centers of socialization and learn many similarities and differences from one another from a very young age. Children are also placed into settings to develop their linguistics and cognitive abilities, which can be measured through observations.

Pre-school is often the term used to refer to child care centers that care primarily for 3 and 4-year-old children. Preschool can be based in a center, family child care home or a public school. Older children, in their turn, in most countries are cared in an educational setting, usually a primary school environment. The children are supervised by a teacher who is responsible for their physical, intellectual, emotional and social development. In this regard, most western countries have compulsory education during which the great majority of children are at school starting from five or six years of age. The school will act &quot;in loco parentis&quot; meaning &quot;in lieu of parent supervision.&quot; In many locales, government is responsible for monitoring the quality of care.

==== Staff ====
For all providers, the largest expense is labor. In a 1999 Canadian survey of formal child care centers, labor accounted for 63% of costs and the industry had an average profit of 5.3%. Given the labor-intensive nature of the industry, it is not surprising that the same survey showed little economies of scale between larger and smaller operators.

Local legislation may regulate the operation of daycare centers, affecting staffing requirements. Laws may mandate staffing ratios (for example 6 weeks to 12 months, 1:4; 12 to 18 months, 1:5; 18 to 24 months, 1:9; et and even higher ratios for older children). Legislation may mandate qualifications of supervisors. Staff typically do not require any qualifications but staff under the age of eighteen may require supervision. Typically, once the child reaches the age of twelve, they are no longer covered by daycare legislation and programs for older children may not be regulated.

In Canada, the workforce is predominantly female (95%) and low paid, averaging only 60% of average workforce wage. Many employees are at local minimum wage and are typically paid by the hour rather than salaried. In the United States, &quot;child care worker&quot; is the fifth most female-dominated occupation (95.5% female in 1999). In the US, staffing requirements vary from state to state.

===Non-profit daycare===
Considerable research has shown that non-profit child care facilities are much more likely to produce the high quality environments in which children thrive.&quot; Not-for-profit organizations are more likely to provide quality childcare to lower income families.

Non-profit day cares have some structural advantages over for-profit operations. They may receive preferential treatment in rent payments, especially if they are affiliated with a church that is otherwise unoccupied during the week, or with a school that has surplus space. Location within a school may have the advantage of coordinated programs with the school and the advantage of a single location for parents who have older school-age children as well.

Local governments, often municipalities, may operate non-profit day care centers. In non-profits, the title of the most senior supervisor is typically &quot;executive director&quot;, following the convention of most non-profit organizations.

===Family child care homes===
Family child care homes can be operated by a single individual out of their home. In most states, the legal age of 18 is only required. There may be occasions when more than one individual cares for children in a family childcare home. This can be a stay-at-home parent who seeks supplemental income while caring for their own child. There are also many family childcare providers who have chosen this field as a profession. Both state and county agency legislation regulate the ratios (number and ages of children) allowed per family child care home. Some counties have more stringent quality standards that require licensing for family child care homes while other counties require little or no regulations for childcare in individuals&#x27; homes. Some family child care homes operate illegally with respect to tax legislation where the care provider does not report fees as income and the parent does not receive a receipt to qualify for childcare tax deductions. However, licensing a family child care home is beneficial for family child care home providers so that they can have access to financial benefits from their state government, or the federal government where they are allowed to accept children from parents who meet the criterion to benefit from the government childcare subsidy funding. Examples of such benefits are: free Professional Development and training courses, Child and adult Care Food Program (which allows eligible childcare and family childcare home providers to claim a portion of costs relating to nutritious meals served to children), and more.

Family childcare may be less expensive than center-based care because of the lower overhead (lower ratios mean less staff are required to maintain regulated ratios. Many family childcare home providers may be certified with the same credentials as center based staff potentially leading to higher level of care.

Franchising of family child care home facilities attempts to bring economies of scale to home daycare. A central operator handles marketing, administration and perhaps some central purchasing while the actual care occurs in individual homes. The central operator may provide training to the individual care providers. Some providers even offer enrichment programs to take the daycare experience to a more educational and professional level.

===Informal care===
Informal childcare is a childcare system that utilizes both family and community members. This includes but is not limited to grandparents, siblings, and both children and adult neighbors. This system is inexpensive and many cultures utilize and embrace informal childcare as beneficial to a child&#x27;s upbringing and education.

In monetary- and production-based societies (such as in the United States), informal childcare is seen in families who do not have enough funds to finance placing their children in a more expensive child care facility. A study done by Roberta Iversen and Annie Armstrong explains that due to long and irregular working hours of working parents, low- socioeconomic families are more likely to utilize informal childcare. Those low income families are also more apt to work longer hours on an irregular and inflexible schedule, which ultimately makes using a childcare facility, that has regular business hours, unlikely.

====Children caring for adults====
Many types of childcare discuss the different ways in which children are cared for by adults or older children. One additional type of child care involves children caring for adults. Children as caretakers are most often seen in developing countries with restricted or hard-to-access medical assistance. Child caretakers are common in families where the parents are affected by HIV/AIDS and other illnesses that might limit their parental functioning.

Developmentally, these child caretakers have shown certain positive associations that affect their future resilience in the face of adversity. Caring for disabled parents raises their sense of responsibility and maturity, increases social and life skills, fosters closer parent-child relationships, and enhances a child&#x27;s early sense of purpose. Children caring for sick or disabled parents also experience less anxiety surrounding their parents compared to children who have an additional caregiver for their disabled parent. This is because the children understand more about the illness and feel more in control over the situation.

==Effects on child development==
A variety of researchers have studied the impacts of childcare on child development, and these findings suggest the importance of childcare for development and health outcomes for children.

===Childcare centers and development ===
Child development researcher Lian Tong analysed the results from a Haley and Stansbury experiment and concluded that, &quot;parent responsiveness also facilitates cognitive, social, and emotional development and reduces negative emotions in infants.&quot; That is, the amount of time that a parent or teacher is willing to spend teaching, listening to, playing with, and exploring with the child the more socially, emotionally, and educationally developed the child will become. Whether that child receives the majority of his or her care at a center or at its house, the biggest factor in deciding what will have the best effect on the child will be those willing to put in the time and effort it takes to properly develop a child&#x27;s social, physical, and academic skills.

The quality of childcare given by a facility is generally indicated by the center&#x27;s cost of enrollment. If the center charges more for the service, it will generally provide better care to the children. Centers that charge more for their services can provide quality education, more current resources, and nicer facilities. These are all helpful when trying to educate a child academically. A higher standard for teachers, such as requiring a degree in early childhood education or a degree of the like, has shown to result in improved growth in the development of a child.

Whether at an expensive facility or relatively inexpensive, children who attend daycare facilities tend to develop social skills more quickly than children of the same age group that are reared at home. They communicate better with children of the same age and often try harder to communicate with those that are younger than them, by using patience and taking different approaches at presenting the data. A study done by Erik Dearing proved that negative social behavioral patterns are not directly connected to daycare. By studying a large selection of children from the Norwegian childcare system, he concluded that the number of hours a child spends at a daycare and their behavior do not have a dependent relationship. Though in America, children who attend childcare systems have a higher risk of externalizing the symptoms of negative social behavior, exhibiting these traits can directly correlate with their time spent in the center.

A study that followed up on the randomized Abecedarian Early Intervention Project showed that 5 years of high-quality, targeted cognitively and linguistically stimulating center-based care starting between 3 and 21 weeks of age resulted in significant changes in midlife brain structure in males. MRI scans showed that several brain region and total brain volumes were substantially larger in participants of the child care program than in the control group.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1162/jocn_a_01709&quot;&gt; Available under .&lt;/ref&gt;

Several studies undertaken in the United States from 2000 to 2007, said that good daycare for non-infants is not harmful. In some cases, good daycare can provide different experiences than parental care does, especially when children reach two years old and are ready to interact with other children. Bad daycare puts the child at physical, emotional and attachment risk. Higher quality care was associated with better outcomes. Children in higher quality childcare had somewhat better language and cognitive development during the first 4½ years of life than those in lower quality care. They were also somewhat more cooperative than those who experienced lower quality care during the first 3 years of life.

The National Institute of Health released a study in March, 2007 after following a group of children through early childhood to the 6th grade. The study found that the children who received a higher quality of childcare scored higher on 5th grade vocabulary tests than the children who had attended childcare of a lower quality. The study also reported that teachers found children from childcare to be &quot;disobedient&quot;, fight more frequently, and more argumentative. The study reported the increases in both aggression and vocabulary were small. &quot;The researchers emphasized that the children&#x27;s behavior was within the normal range and were not considered clinically disordered.&quot;

As a matter of social policy, consistent, good daycare, may ensure adequate early childhood education for children of less skilled parents. From a parental perspective, good daycare can complement good parenting.

One 2003 American study appearing in &quot;Child Development&quot; said that the amount of time spent in daycare before four-and-a-half tended to correspond with the child&#x27;s tendency to be less likely to get along with others, to be disobedient, and to be aggressive, although still within the normal range.

==Health issues==
===Childcare infection===

Childcare infection is the spread of infection during childcare, typically because of contact among children in daycare or school. This happens when groups of children meet in a childcare environment, and there is an individual with an infectious disease who may then spread it to the entire group. Commonly spread diseases include influenza-like illness and enteric illnesses, such as diarrhea among babies using diapers. Illnesses and diseases may also include ringworm, head lice, and hand, feet, mouth disease. It is uncertain how these diseases spread, but hand washing reduces some risk of transmission and increasing hygiene in other ways also reduces risk of infection.

Due to social pressure, parents of sick children in childcare may be willing to give unnecessary medical care to their children when advised to do so by childcare workers and even if it is against the advice of health care providers. In particular, children in childcare are more likely to take antibiotics than children outside of childcare.

== Inequities in access to and provision of childcare ==
Based on the previous sections in this article, it is evident that various countries focus on childcare as a means of supporting their workforces, that childcare leads to beneficial health and developmental outcomes for children, and that childcare takes many forms for many different communities. Given the importance of these outcomes, an analysis of which communities are not able to receive adequate childcare can yield insight into various other issues about race, gender, and class.

There are links between the income, education, and importance of consistency and the well-being of the child, to the parents, and the development of their child. Higher educated parents place more importance on the education of their children than the parents who do not have a college degree or have not graduated from high school. Likewise, parents who have a higher income level are more willing to part with their money to purchase a private tutor or nanny to assist the parent in the education of their child. They also tend to stress the importance of being socially inept. The first few years of a child&#x27;s life are important to form a basis for good education, morality, self-discipline and social integration. Consistency of approach, skills and qualifications of caregivers have been shown in many studies to improve the chances of a child reaching his or her full potential. Child care in much of western society is currently in crisis: there are not enough daycare spots, the cost for most parents is beyond their means, and child care staff are grossly underpaid. Starting wages for Early Childcare Educators start at $11 or $12, causing a high turnover rate, and decreases the likelihood of potentially safe, effective, and loving child care providers from even entering the field. For preschool teachers the average salary is about $28,570. According to a survey done by HiMama, 68% of for-profit child care organizations ranked &#x27;Labor&#x27; as their top risk and 65% ranked &#x27;Talent and Recruitment&#x27; as their top priority for 2017.

Another consideration in the inequities in childcare is who is providing childcare disproportionately. Historically, the task has fallen onto Black and immigrant women—two groups who have not been able to advocate for themselves due to historical, structural, and social tensions. The authors of the article &quot;Suited for Service: Racialized Rationalizations for the Ideal Domestic Servant from the Nineteenth to Early Twentieth Century&quot; argue that the racial legacy of domestic service in the United States has created a relationship of servitude between those who hire domestic caregivers and the caregivers themselves.

==Value of unpaid childcare==
Caregivers nurture and develop their children into being functional members of society. For centuries it has been assumed that women will stay home and take care of the children while their husbands go out and work. In most cases, the husbands get all the credit for providing for the family. However, the homemaker deserves credit for care work. Caregivers do not receive monetary compensation and, because they spend a significant amount of time raising their children, must pay a &#x27;care-penalty&#x27; (the opportunity costs in both time and money that one pays for doing care work for a family member). Instead of taking care of a family member, a caregiver could spend time working or performing leisure activities. Care penalties are not strictly related to childcare – they can also refer to taking care of a sick family member, babysitting a younger sibling, or taking an elderly family member on errands such as grocery shopping or doctor&#x27;s appointments.

===Monetary value===
Studies have been done to get an annual salary estimate for a female caregiver. One survey suggested that the value of a mother&#x27;s work, if she were paid the average wage for each task she performs in running the household and caring for her children, is $117,867 per year. The reason for the high salary is because mothers typically perform about 10 different job functions throughout the week. Some of these job functions are poorly paid, including cleaning, driving, caring for children, and washing laundry, but others, especially financial and managerial tasks that the survey equated with being the chief executive officer of a company, are highly paid. Neither a nanny nor a housekeeper makes nearly as much money, and almost all of these tasks except direct child care also have to be done by non-parents. The value of unpaid childcare is also an important figure in various legal entities. Expert witnesses (most often economists) are occasionally brought into court cases to give estimates on the value of unpaid labor. By giving estimation, the plaintiff or defendant can be fairly compensated for their labor.

Developmental benefits are also seen for older siblings or relatives tasked to care for younger children. For example, children with siblings are more likely to exhibit prosocial behaviors (such as the ability to take another&#x27;s perspective or sharing with others) than children without siblings. Additionally, sibling caretakers have the opportunity to develop deeper communication skills as they teach younger siblings to participate in everyday tasks.

==History==

According to Chris Knight:… the ancestors of extant humans comprised a small population dwelling somewhere in sub-Saharan Africa. Although disagreements abound, some genetic studies indicate that their population size at one point may have resembled that of a modern endangered species, possibly no more numerous than today’s mountain gorillas. What happened next was extraordinary. The population exploded, &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; soon colonising the globe. Population expansion on such a scale is inconsistent with female tolerance of infanticide, harassment, or the heavy costs to mothers of male philandering and double standards. If unusually large numbers of unusually large-brained offspring were being successfully raised to maturity, the quality of childcare must have been exceptional. We know what the optimal solution would have been. There can be no doubt that mothers would have done best by taking advantage of every available childcare resource.Plato, according to Elaine Hoffman Baruch, around 394 , argued that a system of child care would free women to participate in society. Among the early English authors to devote a book to child care in the modern sense was Elizabeth Dawbarn (&quot;The Rights of Infants, or... Nursing of Infants&quot;, 1805).

The first crèche was opened by Firmin Marbeau on 14 November 1844 in Paris, The Société des Crèches was recognized by the French government in 1869. Originating in Europe in the late 18th and early 19th century, day cares were established in the United States by private charities in the 1850s, such as the Charity Organization Society founded by Ansley Wilcox. The Fitch Creche in Buffalo, New York was known as the first day center for working mothers in the United States. Another at that time was the New York Day Nursery in 1854.

In English-speaking and other conservative countries, the vast majority of childcare is still performed by the parents, in-house nannies or through informal arrangements with relatives, neighbors or friends, but most children are in daycare centers for most of the day in Nordic Countries, for example. Child care in the child&#x27;s own home is traditionally provided by a nanny or au pair, or by extended family members including grandparents, aunts and uncles. Child care is provided in nurseries or crèches or by a nanny or family child care provider caring for children in their own homes. It can also take on a more formal structure, with education, child development, discipline and even preschool education falling into the fold of services.

The day care industry is a continuum from personal parental care to large, regulated institutions. Some childminders care for children from several families at the same time, either in their own home (commonly known as &quot;family day care&quot; in Australia) or in a specialized child care facility. Some employers provide nursery provisions for their employees at or near the place of employment.

For-profit day care corporations often exist where the market is sufficiently large or there are government subsidies.

Independent studies suggest that good daycare is not harmful. In some cases, good daycare can provide different experiences than parental care does, especially when children reach two and are ready to interact with other children. Children in higher quality childcare had somewhat better language and cognitive development during the first 4½ years of life than those in lower quality care.

=== Early cross-cultural research on child care outside the home ===

In their 1977 Thomas S. Weisner and Ronald G. Gallimore article said that by 1969 there had been no crosscultural work reference to caretaking of children by anyone other than parents published in &quot;The Handbook of Socialization Theory and Research&quot; included in its 1,182 pages virtually no reference to caretaking of children by anyone other than parents.reported on Their 1977 article reported on their study of over a hundred countries. They found that in agricultural/ horticultural societies where work is done to provide sustenance for the community, siblings and similar-aged children are responsible for younger children. Other factors of childcare that vary cross-culturally are the relative ages of both caretaker and child, parental expectations, demands of the child, culturally-varied conceptions of children&#x27;s maturity, and factors affecting demographic makeup. They said that there are discrepancies attributed to the homestead and household environments. That is, the type of work performed by adult caretakers in a given community strongly influence the type of childcare used. Weisner said that children that receive informal care may or may not receive the same educational and preparatory regimens as those in a center- or home-based center often do. In many situations, there will be no curriculum or teaching schedule, and instead learning occurs informally as a direct result of the caretaker and charge&#x27;s interactions. Learning and development occur differently for every individual. Different periods of a child&#x27;s growth are known to affect the care taking styles associated with them, from the care of an infant to that of an older adolescent. Other influences on caretaking include the expectations of the three parties involved- the parents, caretakers, and children. Many agricultural communities highly value sibling- and peer- caretaking. Accounts from the Idakho tribe in Kenya portray infants being left to the care and guidance of other relatively young children in the community with adults and other tribe members merely within shouting distance should a problem arise. The same pattern of caregiving is seen in the Kikuyu people in Kenya, where mothers in the horticultural society are often away working, which relies on siblings, cousins, and neighbors to care for children as young as 4 months old. In most cases children are taken care of by their parents, legal guardians, or siblings. In some cases, it is also seen that children care for other children. This informal care includes verbal direction and other explicit training regarding the child&#x27;s behavior, and is often as simple as &quot;keeping an eye out&quot; for younger siblings. Care given by unpaid providers in an informal setting affect multiple developmental and psychological dimensions in children. Whether the providers are the child&#x27;s siblings or a member of the family/community, research dictates this type of care influences factors such as sense achievement, affiliation, conformity, and individual interests. More specifically, further research indicates that children being cared for by siblings or similarly aged children (a trend more commonly seen in agriculturally-based cultural communities) have certain psychological and developmental effects on those being cared for. These effects include but are not limited to: mother-child attachment, emergence of childhood developmental stages, formation of playgroups, development of social responsibility, sex differences, personality differences, cognition, and motivation and performance in the classroom.

==Business==
The day care industry is a continuum from personal parental care to large, regulated institutions.

The vast majority of childcare is still performed by the parents, in-house nanny or through informal arrangements with relatives, neighbors or friends. For example, in Canada, among two parent families with at least one working parent, 62% of parents handle the childcare themselves, 32% have other in-home care (nannies, relatives, neighbours or friends) and only 6.5% use a formal day care center.

However, for-profit day care corporations often exist where the market is sufficiently large or there are government subsidies. For instance, in North America, KinderCare Learning Centers, one of the largest of such companies, has approximately 1,600 centers located in 39 states and the District of Columbia. Bright Horizons Family Solutions another of the largest has over 600 daycare centers. Similarly the Australian government&#x27;s childcare subsidy has allowed the creation of a large private-sector industry in that country.

Another factor favoring large corporate daycares is the existence of childcare facilities in the workplace. Large corporations will not handle this employee benefit directly themselves and will seek out large corporate providers to manage their corporate daycares. Most smaller, for-profit daycares operate out of a single location.

In general, the geographic limitations and the diversity in type of daycare providers make child daycare a highly fragmented industry. The largest providers own only a very small share of the market. This leads to frustration for parents who are attempting to find quality child daycare, with 87% of them describing the traditional search for child daycare as &quot;difficult and frustrating&quot;.

== Access ==

The availability of child care, whether with other family members or professional care, affects the ability of parents to work. This includes both single parents and families where both parents need or want to earn money. Many governments in higher-income countries provide subsidies for child care programs for the benefit of low-income families or parents in general. There is political debate over whether the government should provide universal child care services in the United States, where there are few subsidies. Related debates include those over universal preschool and paid family leave.

==Standards and requirements==
Some jurisdictions require licensing or certification. Parents may also turn to independent rating services or rely on recommendations and referrals. Some places develop voluntary quality networks; for example, in Australia, most childcare services are part of a national Quality Assurance system. Some places require caregivers to take classes in pediatric CPR and first aid. Most countries have laws relating to childcare, which seek to keep children safe and prevent and punish child abuse. Such laws may add cost and complexity to childcare provision and may provide tools to help ensure quality childcare.

Additionally, legislation typically defines what constitutes daycare (e.g., so as to not regulate individual babysitters). It may specify details of the physical facilities (washroom, eating, sleeping, lighting levels, etc.). The minimum window space may be such that it precludes day cares from being in a basement. It may specify the minimum floor space per child (for example, 2.8 square metres) and the maximum number of children per room (for example, 24). It may mandate minimum outdoor time (for example, 2 hours for programs lasting 6 hours or longer). Legislation may mandate qualifications of supervisors. Staff typically do not require any qualifications but staff under the age of eighteen may require supervision. Some legislation also establishes rating systems, the number and condition of various toys, and documents to be maintained. Typically, once children reach the age of twelve, they are no longer covered by daycare legislation and programs for older children may not be regulated.

Legislation may mandate staffing ratios (for example, 6 weeks to 12 months, 1:4; 12 to 18 months, 1:5; 18 to 24 months, 1:9; etc.). The caregiver-to-child ratio is one factor indicative of quality of care. Ratios vary greatly by location and by daycare center. Potential consequences of a caregiver-child ratio which is too high could be very serious . However, many states allow a higher numbers of toddlers to caregivers and some centers do not comply consistently. For example, within the US: Pennsylvania, ages 1–3, 1 teacher to 5 children; Missouri: age 2, 1 teacher to 8 children; North Carolina: 1 teacher to 10 children.

Many organizations in the developed world campaign for free or subsidized childcare for all. Others campaign for tax breaks or allowances to provide parents a non-finance driven choice. Many of the free or subsidized childcare programs in the United States are also Child Development programs, or afterschool programs, which hire certified teachers to teach the children while they are in their care. There are often local industry associations that lobby governments on childcare policy, promote the industry to the public or help parents choose the right daycare provider.

In the United States, childcare in regulated commercial or family childcare home setting is administered or led by teachers who may have a Child Development Associate or higher credentials. These higher credentials include Associate, Bachelor, and even master&#x27;s degrees in the field of Early Childhood Education (ECE). Although childcare professionals may obtain a degree, many states require that they attend workshops yearly to upgrade their knowledge and skill levels. Many day cares require a teacher to obtain a certain amount of training. For example, Texas requires a minimum of 25 hours a year, and a first-year teacher is required to have 50 hours.

<text>Corscombe is a village and civil parish in the English county of Dorset, in the Dorset Council administrative area. The parish includes the small settlements of Benville and Toller Whelme to the south and in the 2011 census had a population of 445.

Corscombe village is sited &quot;into hollows and along sunken lanes&quot; on the northern scarp slope of the Dorset Downs, approximately south-south-west from the town of Yeovil in Somerset. Evidence of early human occupation within the parish includes lynchets and, south of the village, three standing stones.

On the higher ground in the village stands the 15th-century parish church of St. Mary, which was restored in 1875–7. In 1905 Sir Frederick Treves described the church as a &quot;handsome building&quot; with an &quot;exceedingly fine&quot; situation. Nearby Corscombe Court dates from the 13th century and is partially surrounded by a moat. It has a 15th-century tithe barn which was once used by the monks of Sherborne Abbey.

About 2 kilometres to the south of Corscombe village, across the A356, is Toller Down, one of the highest hills in Dorset, with good views of the surrounding countryside.

The musician Polly Jean Harvey is a former resident.

<text>Bruno Keats Öijer (born 26 November 1951 in Linköping, Sweden) is a contemporary Swedish poet.

==Biography==
Öijer was born in Linköping in 1951. His first collection of poems, &quot;Sång för anarkismen&quot; (lit. &quot;Song for Anarchism&quot;) was published in 1973.

Öijer is perhaps most appreciated as a stage performance poet, and he has made notable appearances in front of large audiences. During the 1970s, he was a part of poetry group Vesuvius.

In 1986, Öijer, along with Bryn Settels, released the LP shade coming. He has on several occasions collaborated with the Pork Quartet, which played with him, among other things, when performing &quot;Sketches for one of the speech of death&quot; on television. On June 6, 2003, he performed in conjunction with the group Kent&#x27;s concert at Stockholm Stadium. Öijer&#x27;s poems have also been toned by several Swedish composers. These include Molly Kien, Håkan Larsson, Martin B Svensson, Tomas Winter, Hans Ek, Henrik Strindberg, Ylva Skog, Joakim Sandgren and Kim Hedås. 

One of his appearances was that in Stockholm on June 6, 2003, at the occasion of the national day concert by Kent.

<text>Sir Robert Giffen (22 July 1837 – 12 April 1910) was a Scottish statistician and economist.

==Life==
Giffen was born at Strathaven, Lanarkshire. He entered a solicitor&#x27;s office in Glasgow, and while in that city attended courses at the university. He drifted into journalism, and after working for the &quot;Stirling Journal&quot; he went to London in 1862 and joined the staff of the Globe. He also assisted John Morley, when the latter edited the &quot;Fortnightly Review&quot;. In 1868 he became Walter Bagehot&#x27;s assistant-editor on &quot;The Economist&quot;; and his services were also secured in 1873 as city editor of the &quot;Daily News&quot;, and later of &quot;The Times&quot;.

His reputation as a financial journalist and statistician, gained in these years, led to his appointment in 1876 as head of the statistical department in the Board of Trade, and subsequently he became assistant secretary (1882) and finally controller-general (1892), retiring in 1897. As chief statistical adviser to the government, he drew up reports, gave evidence before commissions of inquiry, and acted as a government auditor.

Giffen was president of the Statistical Society (1882–1884); He was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1891. In 1892 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1894 he received the Guy Medal (gold) from the RSS. He was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1897.

Robert Giffen continued in later years to take a leading part in all public controversies connected with finance and taxation, and his high authority and practical experience were universally recognised. He was awarded a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 1895. He died somewhat suddenly in Fort Augustus, Scotland on 12 April 1910.

==Works==
Giffen published essays on financial subjects. His major publications were:

* &quot;American Railways as Investments&quot; (1873); 
* &quot;Essays on Finance&quot; (1879 and 1884); 
* &quot;The Progress of the Working Classes&quot; (1884);
* &quot;The Growth of Capital&quot; (1890);
* &quot;The Case against Bimetallism&quot; (1892); and 
* &quot;Economic Inquiries and Studies&quot; (1904).

The concept of a Giffen good is named after him. Alfred Marshall wrote in the third (1895) edition of his &quot;Principles of Economics&quot;:

As Mr. Giffen has pointed out, a rise in the price of bread makes so large a drain on the resources of the poorer labouring families and raises so much the marginal utility of money to them, that they are forced to curtail their consumption of meat and the more expensive farinaceous foods: and, bread being still the cheapest food which they can get and will take, they consume more, and not less of it.

Marshall&#x27;s attribution identified no corresponding passage in Giffen&#x27;s writings.

On 25 March 1908, Giffen spoke at the Royal United Services Institution in London, where he predicted that a major war would shock the world credit system, which in turn would virtually halt international trade. This inspired the British Admiralty&#x27;s plans for economic warfare at the outbreak of the First World War.

<text>Gagauzia () or Gagauz-Yeri, officially the Autonomous Territorial Unit of Gagauzia (ATUG), is an autonomous territorial unit of Moldova. Its autonomy is intended for the local Gagauz people, a Turkic-speaking, primarily Orthodox Christian ethnic group.

Bessarabia, previously the eastern half of the Principality of Moldavia, was annexed by the Russian Empire in 1812. At the end of World War I, all of Bessarabia – including Gagauzia – was annexed to the Kingdom of Romania. A Soviet invasion and occupation began in June 1940, but the territory was again occupied by Romania from 1941 to 1944, after the latter joined the Axis powers and helped invade the USSR. After World War II, it was incorporated into the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic. In 1990, Gagauzia declared itself independent from Moldova as the Gagauz Republic during the dissolution of the Soviet Union, but was ultimately reintegrated into Moldova in 1995.

== History ==
In the early 20th century, Bulgarian historian M. Dimitrov enumerated 19 different theories concerning the origin of the Gagauz people. Several decades later, the Gagauz ethnologist M. N. Guboglo listed 21 such theories. In some, the Gagauz are presented as descendants of Bulgars, Cumans-Kipchaks, or a clan of Seljuk Turks led by the Turkoman dervish Sarı Saltık. Their Orthodox confession may suggest that their ancestors were already living in the Balkans prior to the Ottoman conquest in the late 14th century. Another theory suggests a Kutrigur descent. In the official Gagauz museum, a plaque mentions that one of the two main theories is that they descend from the Bulgars.

===Russian Empire===
Bessarabia, previously the eastern half of the Principality of Moldavia, was annexed by the Russian Empire in 1812 following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in the Russo-Turkish War of 1806–1812 (&quot;see Treaty of Bucharest (1812)&quot;). Nogai tribes who inhabited several villages in south Bessarabia (or Budjak) were forced to leave. Between 1812 and 1846, the Russians relocated the Gagauz people from what is today eastern Bulgaria (which was then under the Ottoman Empire) to the orthodox Bessarabia, mainly in the settlements vacated by the Nogai tribes. They settled there together with Bessarabian Bulgarians in Avdarma, Comrat, Congaz, Tomai, Cișmichioi, and other former Nogai villages. Some Gagauz were also settled in the part of the Principality of Moldavia that did not come under Russian control in 1812. But, within several years, villagers moved to live with their own people in the compact area in the south of Bessarabia where their descendants inhabit in the 21st century.

With the exception of a six-day &quot;de facto&quot; independence in the winter of 1906, when a peasant uprising declared an autonomous Comrat Republic, ethnic Gagauz have always been ruled by other dominant groups: the Russian Empire (1812–1917), the Kingdom of Romania (1918–1940 and 1941–1944), the Soviet Union (1940–41 and 1944–91), and Moldova (1917–18 and 1991 to date).

===Soviet Union===
Gagauz nationalism remained an intellectual movement during the 1980s, but strengthened by the end of the decade, as the Soviet Union began to embrace liberal ideals. In 1988, activists from the local intelligentsia aligned with other ethnic minorities to create a movement known as the Gagauz People. A year later, the Gagauz People held its first assembly; they passed a resolution demanding the creation of an autonomous territory in southern Moldova, with the city of Comrat as its capital.

The Gagauz national movement intensified when Moldovan (Romanian) was accepted as the official language of the Republic of Moldova in August 1989, challenging the then-dominant Russian language which was the official language of the USSR. A part of the multiethnic population of southern Moldova was concerned about the change in official languages. They did not trust the central government in Chișinău. The Gagauz were also worried about the implications for them if Moldova reunited with Romania, as seemed likely at the time. In November 1989, the Gagauz ASSR was declared within Moldova. In August 1990, Comrat declared itself an autonomous Soviet republic separate from Moldova, but the Moldovan government annulled the declaration as unconstitutional. At that time, Stepan Topal emerged as the leader of the Gagauz national movement.

===Independent Moldova===

Support for the Soviet Union remained high in Gagauzia, with a referendum in March 1991 returning an almost unanimous vote in favour of remaining part of the USSR. Many Gagauz supported the Moscow coup attempt in August 1991, and in September the same year, Transnistria declared its independence, thus further straining relations with the government of Moldova. But, when the Moldovan parliament voted on independence on 27 August 1991, six of the 12 Gagauz deputies in the Moldovan parliament voted in favour, while the other six abstained. The Moldovan government began to pay more attention to minority rights. The economic dependence of Gagauzia on the rest of Moldova, and the Moldovan army&#x27;s inability to defeat Transnistria, created reasons for compromise on both sides.

In February 1994, President Mircea Snegur promised autonomy to the Gagauz, but opposed independence. He was also opposed to the suggestion that Moldova become a federal state made up of three republics: Moldova, Gagauzia, and Transnistria.

In 1994, the Parliament of Moldova awarded to &quot;the people of Gagauzia&quot; (through the adoption of the new Constitution of Moldova) the right of &quot;external self-determination&quot;. On 23 December 1994, the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova accepted the &quot;Law on the Special Legal Status of Gagauzia&quot; (). The law entered into force on 14 January 1995, resolving the dispute peacefully. 23 December is now a Gagauz holiday. Gagauzia is now a &quot;national-territorial autonomous unit&quot; with three official languages: Romanian, Gagauz, and Russian.

Communes with over 50% ethnic Gagauz held referendums where a simple majority was required to join the autonomous region. Communes with fewer Gagauz could have referendums if they were requested by one-third of the population. Following the 5 March 1995 referendum, three towns and 26 communes were included in the Autonomous Gagauz Territory. was elected to serve as the Governor (, ) of Gagauzia for a four-year term, as were the deputies of the local parliament, &quot;The People&#x27;s Assembly&quot; (), with as chairman.

 won the 1999 governor elections and began to assert the rights granted to the governor by the 1994 agreement. The central authorities of Moldova proved unwilling to accept the results, initiating a lengthy stand-off between the autonomy and Chișinău. Finally, Croitor resigned in 2002 due to the pressure from the Moldovan government, which accused him of abuse of authority, relations with the separatist authorities of Transnistria, and other charges.

The central electoral commission of Gagauzia did not register Croitor as a candidate for the post of the governor in the subsequent elections, and Tabunșcic was elected in what was described as unfair elections. Mihail Formuzal served as the governor of Gagauzia from 2006 until 2015. That year Irina Vlah was elected to the position, with 51% of the vote.

On 2 February 2014, Gagauzia held a referendum with an overwhelming majority of voters opting for closer ties with Russia over EU integration. They also said they preferred Gagauzian independence if Moldova were to choose to enter the EU.

On 23 March 2015, Irina Vlah of the Party of Socialists was elected as the new governor after a strongly pro-Russian campaign, dominated by the quest for closer ties with the Russian Federation. On 19 July 2023, Vlah was succeeded by Evghenia Guțul of the Șor Party, a Eurosceptic and Russophilic party that was declared unconstitutional and banned by the Constitutional Court of Moldova exactly 1 month earlier after an investigation was launched in May 2023 into suspected voter bribery during the 2023 Gagauz gubernatorial election. Guțul sits as an independent as a result of the Moldovan ban of Șor.

In the 2024 Moldovan referendum on membership of the European Union, Gagauzia voted 94.84% against the wording &quot;Do you support the amendment of the Constitution with a view to the accession of the Republic of Moldova to the European Union?&quot;, the highest opposition of any administrative division of Moldova. Neighbouring Taraclia District had the second-highest opposition, at 92.04%, whereas the country as a whole voted narrowly in favour (50.39%), despite allegations of Russian interference from president Maia Sandu and from the European Union, including Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and evidence of vote buying reported by BBC News.

== Geography ==
Gagauzia comprises four enclaves, and is divided into three districts. The main, central enclave includes the cities Comrat and Ceadîr-Lunga and is divided into two districts with those cities serving as administrative centers. The second largest enclave is located around the city of Vulcănești, while two smaller enclaves are the villages of Copceac and Carbalia. The village of Carbalia falls under administration of Vulcănești, while Copceac is part of the Ceadîr-Lunga district.

== Administrative divisions ==
Gagauzia consists of one municipality, two cities, and 23 communes containing a total of 32 localities.

== Politics ==
The autonomy of Gagauzia is guaranteed by the Moldovan constitution and regulated by the 1994 Gagauz Autonomy Act. If Moldova decided to unite with Romania, Gagauzia would have the right of self-determination. The Gagauz People&#x27;s Assembly (; ) has a mandate for lawmaking powers within its own jurisdiction. This includes laws on education, culture, local development, budgetary and taxation issues, social security, and questions of territorial administration. The People&#x27;s Assembly also has two special powers: it may participate in the formulation of Moldova&#x27;s internal and foreign policy; and, should central regulations interfere with the jurisdiction of Gagauz-Yeri, it has the right of appeal to Moldova&#x27;s Constitutional Court.

The highest official of Gagauzia, who heads the executive power structure, is the Governor of Gagauzia (; ). The governor is elected by popular suffrage for a four-year term, and has power over all public administrative bodies of Gagauzia. The governor is also a member of the Government of the Republic of Moldova. Eligibility for governorship requires fluency in the Gagauz language, Moldovan citizenship, and a minimum age of 35 years.

Permanent executive power in Gagauz Yeri is exercised by the Executive Committee (&quot;Bakannik Komiteti&quot; / &quot;Comitetul Executiv&quot;). Its members are appointed by the governor, or by a simple majority vote in the Assembly at its first session. The Committee ensures the application of the laws of the Republic of Moldova and those of the Assembly of Gagauz-Yeri.

As part of its autonomy, Gagauzia has its own police force.

Gagauz Halkı is a former Gagauz separatist political party, now outlawed.

Despite declaring Gagauz as the national language of the autonomous region, the local authorities do not provide any full Gagauz-teaching school; most of those are Russian-language as opposed to inner Moldovan full Romanian language education.

== Culture ==
Turkey financed the creation of a Turkish cultural centre (&quot;Türk İşbirliği Ve Kalkınma İdaresi Başkanlığı&quot;) and a Turkish library (&quot;Atatürk Kütüphanesi&quot;). In the village of Beșalma, there is a Gagauz historical and ethnographical museum established by Dimitriy Kara Çöban.

== Sport ==
Not being a sovereign nation, Gagauzia&#x27;s football team cannot be admitted to FIFA. However, in 2006 Gagauzia did participate in the ELF Cup, held in North Cyprus, where it competed with teams from other regions around the world which fall short of full national sovereignty.

Gagauzia has various football clubs. FC Olimp Comrat and Univer-Oguzsport are based in Comrat and FC Saxan Gagauz Yeri is based in Ceadîr-Lunga and they play their matches in Ceadîr-Lunga Stadium.

<text>The Streets is an English musical project led by vocalist and multi-instrumentalist Mike Skinner. The project was founded in the early 90s, while Skinner was still a teenager; however, no music would formally eventuate until the early 2000s. In the initial run of The Streets, the project released five studio albums: &quot;Original Pirate Material&quot; (2002), &quot;A Grand Don&#x27;t Come for Free&quot; (2004), &quot;The Hardest Way to Make an Easy Living&quot; (2006), &quot;Everything Is Borrowed&quot; (2008) and &quot;Computers and Blues&quot; (2011). The Streets also released a string of successful singles during this time, which reached the Top 40 on the UK Singles chart – including &quot;Has It Come to This?&quot;, &quot;Fit but You Know It&quot;, &quot;Dry Your Eyes&quot; (the project&#x27;s only number-one single), &quot;When You Wasn&#x27;t Famous&quot; and &quot;Prangin&#x27; Out&quot;. After disbanding The Streets in 2011, Skinner pursued several other musical projects before ultimately reviving the moniker in 2017. A mixtape, &quot;None of Us Are Getting Out of This Life Alive&quot;, was released in 2020. The Streets&#x27; sixth studio album, &quot;The Darker the Shadow the Brighter the Light&quot;, was released in September 2023.

The Streets is considered one of the most important and influential acts within the trajectory of hip-hop, garage and grime music within the UK. In 2020, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; described &quot;Original Pirate Material&quot; as &quot;a landmark for UK rap&quot;, while &quot;Dazed&quot; wrote in 2018 that the album &quot;soundtracked the beginning of a decade – recovering from the Britpop hangover and comedown from New Labour euphoria – but also defined it.&quot;

==History==
===2001–2003: &quot;Original Pirate Material&quot;===
Mike Skinner sent a demo tape to a record shop in north London, run by A&amp;R Nick Worthington. The song developed into Skinner&#x27;s first single, &quot;Has It Come to This?&quot;, and was released under the name The Streets. The song peaked at number 18 on the UK Singles Chart in October 2001.

The Streets&#x27; debut album, &quot;Original Pirate Material&quot;, was released in March 2002. The album was successful both with critics and the general public. In the UK, the album was nominated for the Mercury Prize. &quot;Original Pirate Material&quot; was nominated for British Album of the Year, and The Streets was nominated for British Urban Act, British Breakthrough Act and British Male Solo Artist at the 2003 BRIT Awards. &quot;NME&quot; named &quot;Original Pirate Material&quot; as the third best album of 2002. Subsequent singles from &quot;Original Pirate Material&quot; include &quot;Don&#x27;t Mug Yourself&quot;, &quot;Weak Become Heroes&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Push Things Forward&quot;.

===2004–2005: &quot;A Grand Don&#x27;t Come for Free&quot;===
In May 2004, Skinner released the single &quot;Fit but You Know It&quot;, which peaked at number 4 on the UK Singles Chart. The single was later used by EA Sports as part of the soundtrack for its video game &quot;FIFA Football 2005&quot;. &quot;Fit But You Know It&quot; appeared on The Streets&#x27; second album, &quot;A Grand Don&#x27;t Come for Free&quot;. The album entered the UK album charts at number two, but later reached number one after six weeks. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Dry Your Eyes&quot;, debuted at the top of the chart in the UK. &quot;Blinded by the Lights&quot;, the third single from &quot;A Grand Don&#x27;t Come for Free&quot;, peaked at number 10 on the UK Singles Chart in 2004.

===2006–2007: &quot;The Hardest Way to Make an Easy Living&quot;===
The Streets&#x27; third studio album, &quot;The Hardest Way to Make an Easy Living&quot;, was released on 10 April 2006. In the UK it debuted the album chart at number one.

===2008–2009: &quot;Everything Is Borrowed&quot;===
In September 2008, The Streets released their fourth studio album, &quot;Everything Is Borrowed&quot;. One song from the album was on Skinner&#x27;s Myspace page for a while before being replaced by a cover of &quot;Your Song&quot;. In a posting on his Myspace blog, Skinner noted that the group&#x27;s upcoming LP would contain &quot;peaceful, positive vibes&quot; in comparison with 2006&#x27;s &quot;weird guilt-ridden indulgence&quot; that was &quot;The Hardest Way To Make An Easy Living.&quot;

In a blurb about the album on Skinner&#x27;s Myspace, he says, &quot;This album started off life as parables but then I realised that it might get a bit cheesy so I got rid of the alien song and the devil song replaced them with more straight up songs. I&#x27;ve pretty much kept my promise that I made to myself not to reference modern life on any of them though which is hard to do and keep things personal at the same time.&quot;

===2010–2011: &quot;Computers and Blues&quot; and &quot;Cyberspace and Reds&quot;===

In November 2010, Skinner announced on the official The Streets website, that he would release what he referred to as a mixtape album called &quot;Cyberspace and Reds&quot;, consisting of various recordings he had made since he had finished work on the final Streets album, &quot;Computers and Blues&quot;. &quot;Cyberspace and Reds&quot; was released in January 2011, initially only for download via the Streets iPhone app. A so-called &quot;deluxe&quot; edition was later made available for general download through the Streets website.

The fifth album &quot;Computers and Blues&quot; was released on 7 February 2011, the first single being &quot;Going Through Hell&quot;. 

===2017–present===
On 22 December 2017, The Streets released two new tracks: &quot;Burn Bridges&quot; and &quot;Sometimes I Hate My Friends More Than My Enemies&quot;. It was The Streets&#x27; first new music released in six years.

In 2018, The Streets released three singles: &quot;If You Ever Need to Talk I&#x27;m not Here&quot; was released on 31 January, &quot;You Are Not the Voice in Your Head...&quot; was released on 30 March, and &quot;Call Me in the Morning&quot; was released on 22 November.

On 1 April 2020, Skinner announced a new single featuring Australian music project Tame Impala, included on a mixtape titled &quot;None of Us Are Getting Out of This Life Alive&quot;, released 10 July 2020. The track premiered on Annie Mac&#x27;s BBC Radio 1 show.

In March 2021, following the UK Government&#x27;s announced COVID-19 restriction easing timetable, The Streets released the single &quot;Who&#x27;s Got the Bag (21st June)&quot;. Referencing the earliest possible date when nightclubs could reopen and the names of members of government the single was described by Skinner as a &quot;end of lockdown celebratory track&quot;.

In October 2023, the first studio album in twelve years, &quot;The Darker the Shadow the Brighter the Light&quot;, was released.

<text>Kirk Thompson (born 26 July 1968), better known by his stage name Krust, is an English drum and bass producer, DJ and co-owner of the Full Cycle record label. Beyond his roles in the music industry, Thompson is also responsible for two businesses: creative consultancy Disruptive Patterns and Amma Life, a CBD oil company he co-owns with Sophia Ali.

He is regarded as one of drum &amp; bass and jungle&#x27;s founders and pioneers and noted for his unique musical style. Krust has released over 100 tracks and three albums on labels such as Full Cycle, Talkin&#x27; Loud and V Recordings. He was a member of Mercury Music Award-winning collective Reprazent and his most prominent releases such as &quot;Warhead&quot; and &quot;Soul in Motion&quot; are cited by peers and press as some of the most highly influential within the genre.

Thompson has been active as a recording artist since his debut single with UK top 10 charting Bristol collective Fresh 4 in 1989. His release rate did, however, slow down between 2008 and 2017 as he studied and established himself in other fields such as Neuro-Linguistic Programming and life coaching. While never quitting music entirely, he became increasingly more active in drum &amp; bass with the re-launch of Full Cycle in 2016. and made a return as a recording artist in 2017 with an Om Unit collaboration called &quot;Underground Cinema&quot;.

His first new album in 14 years entitled &quot;Edge of Everything&quot; was released in November 2020 with lead single &quot;Constructive Ambiguity&quot; picking up single of the month in &quot;DJ Magazine&quot;.

==Early life==
Born 26 July 1968 in Bristol England, Krust grew up in Bristol&#x27;s Knowle West council estate where he embraced the city&#x27;s burgeoning b-boy culture and learnt to breakdance. Inspired by hip hop film &quot;Wild Style&quot;, he set up his first crew Fresh 4 in school who would perform, host competitions and discos at local youth clubs across Bristol. Key members of the collective alongside Krust were his brother J Flynn and friend Paul Southey (Suv) After leaving school, Fresh 4 established themselves in a squat in Bedminster where they would regularly hold parties.

==Career==
===Early career===
Inspired by Bristol&#x27;s Wild Bunch collective (which comprised members of Massive Attack) Krust&#x27;s brother Flynn approached Bristol roots reggae and sound system dub music influenced producer Rob Smith with an idea for song which later became &quot;Wishing on a Star&quot;; a cover of the song by Billie Calvin, that sampled Faze O&#x27;s &quot;Riding High&quot; and James Brown&#x27;s &quot;Funky Drummer&quot; break. The song featured Lizz E on vocals and charted at number 10 in the UK official charts on 7 October 1989. It was the highest-charting release to come from the musical movement often referred to as the Bristol scene until Portishead charted at number eight with &quot;All Mine&quot; in 1997.

Fresh 4 released a follow-up single &quot;Release Yourself&quot; in July 1990. It charted at 81. The band signed an album deal with Virgin Records and worked regularly in London for two years to work on an album but left the label due to artistic differences. The album was eventually released in 2015 as &quot;The Lost Tapes&quot; on Bristol Archive Records.

In 1992 Fresh 4 disbanded as a group and returned to Bristol. Krust continued to work on music while attending raves in the UK southwest region. He released two studio productions during this time with Flynn and Suv under the name Hocus Pocus. These early hardcore tracks were released on Twisted Records, a label financed by roots reggae and dub music influenced Smith &amp; Mighty. During this time Krust also ran a citywide bicycle courier company called Catch 22 and, alongside Suv and DJ Die, would also host events in the Bedminster area of Bristol in the same squat that the video for Fresh 4&#x27;s &quot;Wishing on a Star&quot; was filmed in. These squat raves would often hire the Diditek soundsystem run by Carl Williams whose brother, Roni Size, was the engineer.

===1993–1997: Full Cycle, V Recordings, Dope Dragon, Philly Blunt===
Thompson released his first drum &amp; bass productions under his Krust alias in 1993. &quot;The Resister&quot; was released on Full Circle Records, a label set up by Krust and Size that changed its name to Full Cycle after its first release. This marked the most prolific chapter of Thompson&#x27;s career as a recording artist during which he released a large body of work under a variety of aliases such as Krust, Deceivers, Glamour Gold and Gang Related. He also released numerous collaborations with fellow Full Cycle artists Roni Size, Die and Suv under aliases such as Wings, 3 Way and, later, Kamanchi.

As well as establishing Full Cycle, Krust and Size also launched Dope Dragon, a label established as an experimental outlet for the Bristol collective to have fun and release under different aliases. Between these two labels Krust displayed a wide sonic repertoire that ranged from deeper, jazzy tracks such as &quot;Touch&quot; and &quot;Future Talk&quot; to heavier, dub and jungle-oriented club tracks such as &quot;Oh My Gosh&quot; and &quot;Rukus&quot;.

Amid these releases were also many appearances on V Recordings, the label run by Jumping Jack Frost and Bryan Gee; the DJ credited for signing Krust and his peers and championing what is often referred to in drum &amp; bass as &quot;the Bristol Sound&quot;. V Recordings launched with the &quot;Fatal Dose&quot; EP by Krust under the alias The Deceivers and consequently released frequent Krust productions. He also appeared many times on its subsidiary, more jungle-defined label Philly Blunt and wrote a considerable number of remixes as the decade developed ranging from Shy FX (&quot;Funkindemup&quot;, 1996) Björk (&quot;So Broken&quot;, 1998) to Korn (&quot;Falling Away from Me&quot;, 1999).

Krust&#x27;s output was described by author Peter Shapiro in his book &quot;Drum &#x27;n&#x27; Bass The Rough Guide&quot; as &quot;becoming more progressively apocalyptic as the 1990s developed&quot;. Often, but not always, characterised by orchestral elements, cinematic soundscapes and long drawn-out bass textures, some of the most documented, influential and popularly played Krust productions were released during this time. These include &quot;Warhead&quot;, &quot;Angles&quot;, &quot;True Stories&quot; and &quot;Soul in Motion&quot; which has made such an impression on the genre, Need For Mirrors and Bailey named their fortnightly London event after it.

During this period Krust releases were notoriously circulated as dubplates upwards of years before their release and many were twice the length of typical five- to seven-minute drum &amp; bass tracks. Tracks such as &quot;Brief Encounter&quot; and &quot;Ideal World&quot; on his 1996 EP &quot;Genetic Manipulation&quot; were 13 minutes and 10 minutes respectively, as was &quot;True Stories&quot; which was released in 1998 on Talkin&#x27; Loud.

===1997–2001: Talkin Loud, Def Jam Records===
Thompson&#x27;s solo productions began to slow down during the late 90s as he became a recording and touring member of Roni Size&#x27;s Reprazent collective. Signed to Gilles Peterson&#x27;s Talkin&#x27; Loud imprint, the band&#x27;s debut album &quot;New Forms&quot; won the UK Mercury Music Prize in 1997 and charted in the UK Official Charts Top 40 six times between 1997 – 2001 with singles such as &quot;Share the Fall&quot;, &quot;Heroes&quot;, &quot;Brown Paper Bag&quot; and &quot;Dirty Beats&quot;. The band were signed to Mercury in the UK and Def Jam in the US and released a second album &quot;In the Mode&quot; in 2000.

Talkin&#x27; Loud was also responsible for many Krust productions during this time including &quot;True Stories&quot;, &quot;Future Unknown&quot; and his debut solo album &quot;Coded Language&quot; in 1999. Rapper and slam poet Saul Williams featured on the title track and the album also included beatless string pieces such as &quot;One Moment&quot; and the vocals of singer Morgan on the track &quot;Re Arrange&quot;. It was met with favourable reviews. &quot;Coded Language&quot; was followed by a remix album &quot;Decoded&quot; in 2000 which featured remixes by Krust himself, DJ Die and previously unreleased track &quot;Witchcraft&quot;. Krust also appeared on Talkin&#x27; Loud&#x27;s soundtrack to UK horror movie &quot;Long Time Dead&quot; with a cover of David Bowie and Giorgio Moroder&#x27;s &quot;Cat People&quot;.

===2000–08: Full Cycle, Kamanchi, Hidden Knowledge===
Thompson continued to release music on Full Cycle and V during his time on Talkin&#x27; Loud and Def Jam (who released Talkin&#x27; Loud in North America). Prominent releases during the early 2000s were new versions of &quot;Warhead&quot;; the Steppa Pt 2 remix and &quot;Warhead 2000&quot; (released on Planet V – &quot;The Remixes&quot;), a remix of Roni Size&#x27;s &quot;Snapshot&quot; and the angular, paranoid &quot;Kloakin&#x27; Device&quot; which led to a follow-up &quot;Kloakin King&quot; and its b-side &quot;Don&#x27;t Front&quot; in 2002.

In contrast to the &quot;Kloakin&quot; series, Thompson and DJ Die continued to work together on their funkier, more soulful Kamanchi project. Following the release of &quot;Stay&quot; in 1999 on V Recordings&#x27; &quot;Planet V&quot; and numerous dubplates such as &quot;Warrior Ship&quot; and &quot;Right Now Doing Our Thing&quot;, Kamanchi released their only album &quot;I Kamanchi&quot; in 2003. The album featured live instrumentation and had a heavy vocal presence from singers Tali, Leanne and Keirin Kirby (under the name Violet) and rappers Rodney P, Darrison and Retna. It was described by Dutch dance website Party Scene as one &quot;that underlines that the future of drum &#x27;n&#x27; bass lies in the vocals and warmth and not so much in sinister baldness&quot; while US site XLR8R wrote how the album &quot;valiantly finds a balance between the crossover cut and the dancefloor filler.&quot;

Following Kamanchi, Krust and Die collaborated under their solo names with &quot;Collision Course&quot; in 2004. Other collaborations during this time included one with DJ Zinc on Bingo Beats (&quot;Again&quot;  / &quot;New Territory&quot;, 2005) and Clipz (&quot;Brainwash&quot; and &quot;Robots Rebellion&quot;, 2005) while solo singles such as &quot;Follow Da Vision / Paper Monster&quot; and &quot;Malice / Manipulation&quot; led towards his second solo album &quot;Hidden Knowledge.&quot;

Released in 2006, the album was described by UK music site The Skinny as capturing &quot;every element that Krust has explored throughout his illustrious production career.&quot; Krust has stated in interviews how the album was written during a time of studying philosophy and religion and how tracks such as &quot;Belief System&quot;, &quot;Choose Consciousness&quot; and &quot;Human Awareness&quot; were titled to encourage researching their topics.

It included a bonus CD with a selection of some of Krust&#x27;s previous successful tracks such as &quot;Guess&quot;, &quot;Soul in Motion&quot;, &quot;Jazz Note&quot; and &quot;Last Day&quot;. Singles that came off the album included the &quot;Hidden Knowledge&quot; EP, which featured a DJ Zinc remix of past hit &quot;Follow Da Vision&quot; and an instrumental version of &quot;New Humans&quot; and a 12 inch of &quot;Belief System&quot; / &quot;Mystery School&quot;. These were Krust&#x27;s last official single releases of the 2000s. His last release during this era was a retrospective Full Cycle double mix CD &quot;Journey thru the Cycle&quot; in 2007. Full Cycle ceased business in 2008. Both Krust and Roni have stated in interviews how the label had run its course for that period and how they needed to take time away from music to focus on their families and future.

===2008–present: Disruptive Patterns, Amma Life and return to music===
Thompson moved to London in 2006 and took time out of the music industry in 2008 for a number of years as he &quot;needed to develop in different ways&quot;. He studied neurolinguistic programming and his first non-music business venture was Disruptive Patterns, a lifestyle coaching consultancy launched in 2009 and aimed at translating the ideologies of jungle into other industry sectors. Disruptive Patterns workshops and seminars involve advice on time management, overcoming personal challenges, creative thinking, wellness and the development of the working mindset and have been held across music colleges and universities across the UK and venues such as The Barbican and Soho House. They also spawned a run of seminars aimed specifically at new producers called Future Minds.

Coaching and advice has remained a main drive for Thompson and is evident in various online activities with Disruptive Patterns podcasts, his blog, and his active interactions on crowd sourced question and answer site Quora. He regularly discusses the idea of breaking the rules, unlearning what you know and experimenting with new ideas.

In 2014 Thompson also launched Amma Life, a CBD oil company with business partner Sophia Ali who met Kirk through her work as a therapist at Bristol&#x27;s Relaxation Centre. Their company creates a wide range of CBD products. The Amma Life website describes their business ethic as wanting to &quot;support people to live creative, happy, healthy lives and to tap into their unrealised potential to live life to the fullest.&quot;

In 2010 Thompson began to gradually make his return to electronic music and bass culture with his band The Rules with fellow Bristol artist Nick Toots. They released &quot;Sign Up&quot; in 2010 with a remix by drum &amp; bass artist Zen It was released on Krust&#x27;s new imprint Rebel Instinct, a label established as &quot;a breeding ground for revolution&quot; and was followed by a selection of digital releases including a various artists EP entitled &quot;Transparency&quot; featuring Need For Mirrors and new material from Thompson under both his Krust and Gang Related aliases and an EP by Benjamin One. Rebel Instinct also introduced George Kurts, a new experimental, non-drum &amp; bass alias from Thompson that has so far released and uploaded a small selection of tracks: &quot;Monitor Your Thoughts&quot; (2012), &quot;Big Foot&quot; (2015) and &quot;Mad Paradise&quot; (2015).

In 2014 Krust remixed Claude VonStroke&#x27;s &quot;Oakland Rope&quot;. It was released on the remix edition of &quot;Urban Animal&quot;. VonStroke had previously stated on his social media that the track was a homage to Krust and the Bristol sound.

In 2016 Krust&#x27;s return to drum &amp; bass developed with the re-launch of Full Cycle with Roni Size. The announcement followed Krust and Roni Size&#x27;s first DJ gig together in many years at the BBC&#x27;s 6 Music Festival 2016 in Bristol&#x27;s Colston Hall. Full Cycle launched in March 2016 with &quot;Formulate&quot;, a 1996 collaboration with Size that was previously only released on an American label Breakbeat Science and a remix of Krust&#x27;s &quot;Kloaking Device&quot; by UK artist Fracture. Krust has stated that Full Cycle still celebrates originality and excitement and how the label is working with artists who &quot;share the same vision as us and can expand the next chapter of Full Cycle.&quot; Artists to appear on the label since its relaunch include Total Recall, Need For Mirrors and D Product.

2016 also saw Thompson collaborate with London artist Om Unit as he featured on &quot;Underground Cinema&quot;, an 8-minute track &quot;FACT Magazine&quot; described as a &quot;future classic&quot;. It was followed in 2017 by the release of two previously unreleased dubplates from the mid 1990s on Dom &amp; Roland&#x27;s &quot;Dubs from the Dungeons&quot; series: &quot;Ivory Puzzle&quot; and &quot;Flip It&quot;.

Thompson then released his first full single release in over 10 years, since the closure of Full Cycle, in January 2018. &quot;The Portal&quot; and &quot;Concealing Treachery&quot; were released on Doc Scott&#x27;s 31 Records. Scott stated on Twitter about the release: &quot;There have been many moments as a label owner that I can look back on that make me very proud. But this might be my proudest moment of all.&quot; Resident Advisor&#x27;s reviewer Mark Smith also commented that if Krust &quot;can maintain this standard, it&#x27;ll be one of the strongest comebacks in drum &amp; bass history.&quot;

<doc id="389670" wikidata="Q205322" url="?curid=389670" title="Frankie Knuckles">
<text>Francis Warren Nicholls Jr. (January 18, 1955 – March 31, 2014), known professionally as Frankie Knuckles, was an American DJ, record producer, and remixer. He played an important role in developing and popularizing house music, a genre of music that began in Chicago during the early 1980s and subsequently spread worldwide. In 1997, Knuckles won the Grammy Award for Remixer of the Year, Non-Classical. Due to his importance in the development of the genre, Knuckles was often called &quot;The Godfather of House Music&quot;.

==Musical career==
===1970s–1980s===
Born in New York City, in the Bronx, Knuckles and his friend Larry Levan began frequenting discos as teenagers. While studying textile design at the FIT, Knuckles and Levan began working as DJs, playing soul, disco, and R&amp;B at two of the most important early discos, The Continental Baths and The Gallery. Their DJing led them to the Loft and the Gallery, with Levan becoming the main DJ at the Continental Baths. Knuckles, initially hesitant about the Baths, eventually began playing there until its closure in 1976.

The Continental Baths, located below the Ansonia Hotel, was an opulent gay bathhouse known for its steam rooms, swimming pool, disco, and more. Levan left in 1974, later establishing the prototype for the Paradise Garage. After Levan&#x27;s departure, Knuckles became the Baths&#x27; resident DJ until its closure.

In the late 1970s, Knuckles moved from New York City to Chicago, where his old friend, Robert Williams, was opening what became the nightclub called Warehouse. When the club opened in Chicago in 1977, he was invited to play on a regular basis. Knuckles accepted the offer and moved to Chicago in 1977, becoming the resident DJ at the Warehouse. The Warehouse, situated in Chicago&#x27;s west side industrial zone, emerged as a sanctuary for the city&#x27;s black and gay community, offering a haven for those seeking freedom and salvation through music. Knuckles&#x27; DJ sets at the Warehouse were transformative experiences, drawing in crowds of up to 2,000 people, primarily from the black and gay demographic. The club&#x27;s intense and soulful parties became akin to a religious gathering, where the diverse attendees found unity and spiritual connection.

In the late 1970s, as disco faced challenges, Knuckles sought ways to keep the genre alive in Chicago. He began experimenting with re-edits of songs, extending intros and breaks, and adding new beats to rejuvenate old favorites. These DJ alchemy experiments at the Warehouse laid the foundation for the emergence of house music. While the Warehouse initially faced skepticism from the wider Chicago club scene, it eventually gained recognition as adventurous straight audiences began attending. Wayne Williams, a young DJ from the south side, was among those influenced by Knuckles&#x27; music. Williams, inspired by the unique sound, introduced it to his audiences, becoming one of Chicago&#x27;s most successful DJs and spreading the &quot;house&quot; sound beyond the gay clubs.

House music&#x27;s name itself originated from the Warehouse, reflecting the exclusive, underground vibe of the club. Initially, &quot;house&quot; referred to an attitude and a feeling associated with cool, underground music. As Knuckles continued to reshape disco tracks and experiment with remixing, the term &quot;house&quot; evolved into a genre of its own.

Knuckles continued DJing at the Warehouse until November 1982, when he started his own Chicago club, The Power Plant.

Around 1983, Knuckles bought his first drum machine to enhance his mixes from Derrick May, a young DJ who regularly made the trip from Detroit to see Knuckles at the Warehouse and Ron Hardy at the Music Box, both in Chicago. The combination of bare, insistent drum machine pulses and an overlay of cult disco classics defined the sound of early Chicago house music, a sound which many local producers began to mimic in the studios by 1985.

When his next club the Powerhouse closed in 1987, Knuckles moved to the UK for four months and DJ-ed at DELIRIUM!, a Thursday night party at Heaven, a gay nightclub in London. Chicago house artists were in high demand and having major success in the UK with this new genre of music. Knuckles also had a stint in New York, where he continued to immerse himself in producing, remixing, and recording. 1988 saw the release of Pet Shop Boys&#x27; third album, &quot;Introspective&quot;, which featured Knuckles as a co-producer of the song &quot;I Want a Dog.&quot;

===Work with Jamie Principle===
In 1982, Knuckles was introduced to then-unknown Jamie Principle by mutual friend Jose &quot;Louie&quot; Gomez, who had recorded the original vocal-dub of &quot;Your Love&quot; to reel-to-reel tape. Louie Gomez met up with Frankie at the local record pool (I.R.S.) and gave him a tape copy of the track. Knuckles played Gomez&#x27;s unreleased dub mix for an entire year in his sets during which it became a crowd favorite. Knuckles later went into the studio to re-record the track with Principle, and in 1987 helped put &quot;Your Love&quot; and &quot;Baby Wants to Ride&quot; out on vinyl after these tunes had been regulars on his reel-to-reel player at the Warehouse for a year.

As house music was developing in Chicago, producer Chip E. took Knuckles under his tutelage and produced Knuckles&#x27; first recording, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Hide from Yourself&quot;. Then came more production work, including Jamie Principle&#x27;s &quot;Baby Wants to Ride&quot;, and later &quot;Tears&quot; with Robert Owens (of Fingers Inc.) and (Knuckles&#x27; protégé and future Def Mix associate) Satoshi Tomiie.

===1990s–2010s===

Knuckles made numerous popular Def Classic Mixes with John Poppo as sound engineer, and Knuckles partnered with David Morales on Def Mix Productions. His debut album &quot;Beyond the Mix&quot; (1991), released on Virgin Records, contained what would be considered his seminal work, &quot;The Whistle Song&quot;, which was the first of four number ones on the US dance chart. The Def Classic mix of Lisa Stansfield&#x27;s &quot;Change&quot;, released in the same year, also featured the whistle-like motif. Another track from the album, &quot;Rain Falls&quot;, featured vocals from Lisa Michaelis. Eight thousand copies of the album had sold by 2004. Other key remixes from this time include his rework of the Electribe 101 anthem &quot;Talking with Myself&quot; and Alison Limerick&#x27;s &quot;Where Love Lives&quot;.

When Junior Vasquez took a sabbatical from The Sound Factory in Manhattan, Knuckles took over and launched a successful run as resident DJ. He continued to work as a remixer through the 1990s and into the next decade, reworking tracks from Michael Jackson, Luther Vandross, Diana Ross, Eternal and Toni Braxton. He released several new singles, including &quot;Keep on Movin&#x27;&quot; and a re-issue of an earlier hit &quot;Bac N Da Day&quot; with Definity Records. In 1995, he released his second album titled &quot;Welcome to the Real World&quot;. By 2004, 13,000 copies had sold.

Openly gay, Knuckles was inducted into the Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame in 1996.

In 2004, Knuckles released a 13-track album of original material – his first in over a decade – titled &quot;A New Reality&quot;.

==Death==
In the mid-2000s, Knuckles developed Type II diabetes. He developed osteomyelitis after breaking his foot snowboarding, and had it amputated after declining to take time off for treatment. On March 31, 2014, he died in Chicago at the age of 59 due to the complications from his diabetes.

==Legacy==
In April 2015, a year after his death, Defected Records released a retrospective compilation, &quot;House Masters Frankie Knuckles&quot;; Knuckles had selected the track list before his death. Also, the same month, as a tribute to Knuckles, a version of his song &quot;Baby Wants to Ride&quot; was released by Underworld and Heller and Farley to mark the year anniversary of his death. It went straight to number one on the UK&#x27;s first ever Official Vinyl Singles Chart. All proceeds went to the Frankie Knuckles Trust/Elton John AIDS Foundation. A year after his death, on April 4, 2015, an in Memoriam Essential Mix on BBC Radio 1 was played containing two previously unreleased Knuckles mixes.
Knuckles was featured in the documentary films &quot;Maestro&quot; (2003), written and directed by Josell Ramos, &quot;The UnUsual Suspects: Once Upon a Time in House Music&quot; (2005), directed by Chip E. and &quot;Continental&quot; (2013) about the Continental Baths.

Frankie Knuckles established a signature performance style characterized by consistently wearing a simple black t-shirt during his DJ sets starting in the 1980s. This minimalist aesthetic became an influential professional statement within electronic dance music, signaling a focus on musical authenticity and technical skill over visual performance.

Frankie Knuckles famously referred to house music as &quot;disco&#x27;s revenge&quot; – a phrase that has been lauded by artists and DJs since his passing.

Frankie Knuckles&#x27;s role in the creation of Chicago house music was discussed in Episode 3 of the 2024 PBS series &quot;Disco: Soundtrack of a Revolution&quot;.

==Awards and honors==

In 1997, Knuckles won the Grammy Award for Remixer of the Year, Non-Classical. In 2004, the city of Chicago – which &quot;became notorious in the dance community around the world for passing the so-called &#x27;anti-rave ordinance&#x27; in 2000 that made property owners, promoters and deejays subject to $10,000 fines for being involved in an unlicensed dance party&quot; – named a stretch of street in Chicago after Knuckles, where the old Warehouse once stood, on Jefferson Street between Jackson Boulevard and Madison Street. That stretch of street, called Frankie Knuckles Way, &quot;was renamed when the city declared August 25, 2004, as Frankie Knuckles Day. The Illinois state senator who helped make it happen was Barack Obama.&quot; In 2005, Knuckles was inducted into the Dance Music Hall of Fame.

<text>The University of Iceland ( ) is a public research university in Reykjavík, Iceland, and the country&#x27;s oldest and largest institution of higher education. Founded in 1911, it has grown steadily from a small civil servants&#x27; school to a modern comprehensive university, providing instruction for about 14,000 students in twenty-five faculties. Teaching and research is conducted in social sciences, humanities, law, medicine, natural sciences, engineering and teacher education. It has a campus concentrated around &quot;Suðurgata&quot; street in central Reykjavík, with additional facilities located in nearby areas as well as in the countryside.

==History==
The University of Iceland was founded by the on 17 June 1911, uniting three former post-secondary institutions: &quot;Prestaskólinn&quot;, &quot;Læknaskólinn&quot; and &quot;Lagaskólinn&quot;, which taught theology, medicine and law, respectively. The university originally had only faculties for these three fields, in addition to a faculty of humanities. During its first year of operation, 45 students were enrolled. The first rector of the university was Björn M. Ólsen, a professor in the faculty of humanities.

The university played an important role in the construction of the Icelandic nation-state and was perceived by Icelanders as an important stepping stone towards full independence. Demands for a national Icelandic university stretch as far back as to the first session of the elected assembly of Althingi in 1845. Icelandic nationalist leaders petitioned Denmark at the time to create a &quot;national school&quot; to achieve cultural and material progress, but also to make sure that the education that Icelanders obtained was sufficiently national in character.

For its first 29 years, the university was housed in the Icelandic Parliament building, , in central Reykjavík. In 1933, the university received a special licence from to operate a cash-prize lottery called &quot;Happdrætti Háskólans&quot;. The university lottery, which started in 1934, remains a major source of funding for the construction of new university buildings. In 1940, the university moved into the main building, designed by Icelandic state architect Guðjón Samúelsson. The main building forms the core of the university campus on &quot;Suðurgata&quot;, where most of the principal buildings of the university are located today.

In recent years, there has been some major restructuring. In 2008, the university was divided into five different schools. Simultaneously, the Iceland University of Education was merged with the University of Iceland to become its School of Education. Increased competition from local colleges has encouraged the university to greatly improve its marketing strategies, which had previously been deemed unnecessary.

On 21 January 2021, a broken main water pipe serving the Vesturbær neighbourhood of Reykjavík flooded the campus with over 2,000 tonnes of water, causing damage to buildings Háskólatorg and Gimli.

==Campus==

===School buildings===
The university&#x27;s main campus lies immediately south-west of Tjörnin lake in the centre of Reykjavík. It covers about 10 hectares in total. There are around 30 buildings in total, the oldest of which, Gamli Garður, was built in 1934. The Main Building overlooks a semi-circular lawn, featuring a statue of Sæmundur fróði. In 2007, a new service centre was opened next to the main building and many of the most vital service desks were relocated there. Some lectures take place in Háskólabíó cinema at the northern end of the campus. There are also a gym, several dormitories, and smaller research institute buildings on the grounds. Most buildings are located on the main campus and nearby neighbourhoods. The Faculty of Sport, Leisure Studies and Social Education, on the other hand, is located in the village of Laugarvatn.

===Library===
In 1994, the university library (formally established in 1940) merged with the national library of Iceland, &quot;Landsbókasafn Íslands&quot; (est. 1818) to form one large academic library, the National and University Library of Iceland (). The library main building, &quot;Þjóðarbókhlaðan&quot;, is situated next to the main campus.

===Hospital===
Education and research at the University of Iceland are closely tied with the National University Hospital in Reykjavík. The facilities of the School of Health Sciences are therefore largely located on the hospital grounds.

==Organisation==

===Administration===

The University Council is the highest administrative authority within the institution and consists of the Rector and ten other members, including two students and two members endorsed by the University Forum. The University Forum consists of the Rector, faculty heads and various domestic representatives. It does not have any executive powers but works with the Council on the overall strategy of the university. The five academic schools and their faculties are headed by deans and have much control over curricula and day-to-day administration.

Jón Atli Benediktsson is the current Rector of the University of Iceland. He took over from Kristín Ingólfsdóttir in 2015.

===Schools and faculties===

The University of Iceland is divided into five schools (&quot;svið&quot;) which are further divided into a total of twenty-five faculties (&quot;deildir&quot;). Prior to 2008, it was divided into eleven faculties which were then divided into departments (&quot;skorir&quot;). The largest current school is the School of Social Sciences with over 4,700 students, while each of the other four have around half that number. The university also operates a continuing education centre.
The university consists of the following schools and faculties:

* School of Social Sciences

:* Faculty of Business Administration
:* Faculty of Economics
:* Faculty of Law
:* Faculty of Social Sciences
:* Faculty of Social Work
:* Faculty of Political Science

* School of Health Sciences

* School of Engineering and Natural Sciences

:* Faculty of Industrial-, mechanical engineering and computer science
:* Faculty of Earth Sciences
:* Faculty of Life and environmental sciences
:* Faculty of Electrical and computer engineering
:* Faculty of Physical sciences
:* Faculty of Civil and Environmental Engineering

===Institutes===
There are over sixty research institutes and seven rural research stations run by the university. Some of the most notable are:

:*Árni Magnússon Institute for Icelandic Studies
:* Institute of Earth Sciences (includes the Nordic Volcanological Centre)
:* Keldur – Institute for Experimental Pathology
:* Social Science Research Institute
:*Vigdís Finnbogadóttir Institute of Foreign Languages (a UNESCO category 2 institute)

==Academics==
In addition to the major faculties, there are numerous research institutes attached to the university. With more than 700 tenured teachers, over 2,000 non-tenured teachers and about 300 researchers and administrators, the University of Iceland is the largest single work-place in Iceland.

Some of the resources available at the university are uniquely Icelandic; these include the manuscripts preserved in the Árni Magnússon Institute for Icelandic Studies, Icelandic census records dating from 1703, exceptionally complete genealogical data and climatological, glaciological, seismic and geothermal records.

===Education===
The University of Iceland offers studies in more than 160 undergraduate programmes in the humanities, science and social sciences and in professional fields such as theology, law, business, medicine, odontology, nursing, pharmacology and engineering. Postgraduate studies are offered by all faculties, most of them research-based although not exclusively. There are also several multidisciplinary master&#x27;s programmes available in the fields of health and environmental sciences, some of them in cooperation with other European universities.

The principal language of instruction is Icelandic. Textbooks are mainly in English and Icelandic. Most departments offer courses in English and allow foreign students to take their examinations in English. Icelandic language, medieval studies and environmental sciences are some of the university&#x27;s strongest specialties, owing to Iceland&#x27;s unique literary heritage and nature. A growing number of English-taught programmes are offered in these fields and others, attracting a large number of foreign students.

===Rankings===

In 2011, &quot;Times Higher Education&quot; included the University of Iceland for the first time, placing it in the 276-300 band globally. The following year it had risen to the 251-275 band on the same list. The 2017 edition of Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) placed it in the 401-500 band globally.

==Student life==

===Student funding===
The University of Iceland is a public, government-funded university and as such it does not charge tuition (although an enrollment fee of 75,000 króna must be paid). In terms of living expenses, most students at the University of Iceland either work part-time to finance their studies or receive student loans at favourable interest rates from the Icelandic Student Loan Fund.

The Icelandic Ministry of Education, Science and Culture annually offers awards to foreign students for the study of Icelandic language, history and literature at the University of Iceland. Scholarships are usually restricted to students from selected countries each year. Awards are tenable for one academic year and aim to cover board and lodging.

The major source of funding available to foreign graduate students is the Eimskipafélag Íslands University Fund, which is open to both scholars and current or prospective PhD students. Each grant from the fund is approximately 2.5 million ISK per year, for a period of up to three years and is intended to cover living expenses.

===Student politics, unions and services===
The &quot;Students&#x27; Council&quot; is the official representative of those studying at the university. It handles all kinds of rights issues and relations with internal and external authorities. Elections for the council take place every year. There are three major parties that participate in the student politics. These are Vaka and Röskva. Many local politicians started their careers as members of the council.

There are over 60 student unions in operation within the university. Each union is made up of students of a particular subject or a few related ones. Postgraduate students in some fields have their own unions. Membership is optional. A large part of the unions&#x27; function revolves around social activities, the most common of which are the so-called &quot;science trips&quot;, a tradition where companies and organizations in the industry invite students in a relevant field over for a presentation and drinks. Some postgraduate student unions also organize small-scale academic seminars.

Félagsstofnun stúdenta is a self-owned institution that runs several services in and around the campus. These include kindergartens, low-rent apartments, cafeterias and a large bookstore.

<text>SPITBOL (Speedy Implementation of SNOBOL) is a compiled implementation of the SNOBOL4 programming language. Originally targeted for the IBM System/360 and System/370 family of computers, it has now been ported to most major microprocessors including the SPARC. It was created by Robert Dewar and Ken Belcher, who were then at the Illinois Institute of Technology.

Prior to the development of SPITBOL, SNOBOL4 was thought to be slow, memory-intensive, and impossible to compile due to its dynamic nature. While delayed binding prevents everything from being determined at compile time, SPITBOL adopts various strategies for making decisions as early as possible. Recent versions of the SPITBOL compiler are available. Since 2001 the source code for the original SPITBOL 360 compiler has been made available under the GNU General Public License.

MACRO SPITBOL is an implementation of SPITBOL written in the 1970s by Robert Dewar and Anthony P. McCann. MACRO SPITBOL is coded in MINIMAL, an assembly language for an abstract machine. The instruction set is carefully defined to allow some latitude in its implementation, so that hardware operations favorable to string processing can be exploited.

An implementation of MINIMAL that was designed for interpretation on microcomputers was done by translating MINIMAL into MICRAL using a translator that was itself implemented in SPITBOL. The MICRAL version of MACRO SPITBOL, together with the MICRAL interpreter ran in under 40K bytes. This extreme object code compression of MICRAL is achieved using a set of machine code macro substitutions that minimizes the space required for the object code and macro table. The complexity of known algorithms for an optimal solution to this problem are high, but efficient heuristics attain near-optimal results.

The source code for MACRO SPITBOL was released under the GNU General Public License on April 17, 2009.

<text>Dudley Zoo &amp; Castle (previously Dudley Zoological Gardens) is a zoo within a 200-acre densely-wooded site located within the grounds of Dudley Castle in the town of Dudley, in the Black Country region of the West Midlands, England. The zoo opened to the public on 18 May 1937. It contains 12 modernist animal enclosures and other buildings designed by the architect Berthold Lubetkin and the Tecton Group. The zoo went into receivership in 1977 and was purchased by Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council. Dudley Zoo is now operated by Dudley and West Midlands Zoological Society, founded in 1978 and a registered charity.

==History==
The owner of Dudley Castle, William Ward, 3rd Earl of Dudley, decided to create a zoo in the castle grounds in the 1930s. The initial Board of the Dudley Zoological Society was made up of the Earl, Ernest Marsh (director of Marsh and Baxter) and Captain Frank Cooper, owner of Oxford Zoo, who wanted to sell his animals and it was Oxford Zoo, which closed in 1936, that supplied Dudley with the majority of its initial collection of animals. The zoo was built between 1935 and 1937, with Dr Geoffrey Vevers, the Superintendent at London Zoo acting as an advisor. Thirteen zoo buildings were designed by Berthold Lubetkin and engineering was carried out by Ove Arup. The steepness of much of the terrain and the presence of caverns produced by limestone mining in previous centuries presented the architects and builders with a number of difficulties. Further constraints were presented by the castle being a scheduled monument, its structure and immediate surroundings being protected by a government department, the Office of Works.

The architects chose a deliberately modern style for the animal enclosures, entrance and visitor refreshment facilities, making no attempt to match the appearance of the castle ruins. The main material chosen for the construction was pre-stressed reinforced concrete which gave the possibility of forming curved structures and projecting platforms. It was decided to avoid cages where possible and to display the animals in a deliberately artificial manner rather than create an imitation of natural surroundings.

The zoo opened on 18 May 1937. The opening day was a success, with over 250,000 people recorded as visiting the zoo on its opening day. 700,000 people visited the zoo in its first year.

The opening weeks of the zoo were not always positive as on 18 June 1937, a Malayan brown bear escaped from the zoo, biting a Dudley resident and was struck by a policeman&#x27;s truncheon. The bear then spent a few hours in local gardens before recapture. Just 3 days later the animal made another escape, this time being shot dead in the castle grounds.

During his reign, King Edward VIII was a regular visitor to the zoo. The King was a close friend of the zoo&#x27;s co-owner, William Ward, 3rd Earl of Dudley.

Elephant rides were one of the attractions of the zoo since it opened in 1937, as it was reported in April 1937 that two Indian elephants had been brought to Dudley Zoo with that purpose in mind. The zoo continued to have elephants until 9 April 2003 when the zoo’s last two African elephants, Flossie and Flora, were relocated to Planete Sauvage in south-west France.

A miniature railway was added in 1938 with two locomotives constructed by G &amp; S Light Engineering, of Stourbridge. The locomotives ran on a track about 1 mile long, carrying up to 150 passengers.

In 1958 a chair lift was introduced to take visitors from near the entrance up the steep grass bank towards the elephant house. The chair lift was opened on 11 May 1958 by the comedian Richard Hearne. In 2000, the chairlift was put out of use due to safety concerns. It was relaunched in August 2012 following a Heritage Lottery Fund refurbish. 

The zoo was bought by the Scotia leisure group in 1970. In 1977, the zoo went into receivership but was bought by Dudley Metropolitan Council. Finally, in 1978, The Dudley and West Midlands Zoological Society charity was set up to run the zoo, although the council still owns the grounds.

In 1979, the Penguin Pool had to be demolished because of damage to the concrete caused by the salty water. This was the one major original animal enclosure to unfortunately be lost.

On 23 October 2018 zoo staff shot dead an 8-year-old snow leopard named Margaash, after he had left his enclosure when a keeper failed to secure it. In a post to its website on 30 November 2018 the zoo confirmed that it was closed with no visitors on site at the time of the incident, and there is no suggestion that Margaash posed any immediate threat to any human. The zoo described the killing as &quot;euthanasia&quot;. A backlash and protest followed as local people disagreed with the killing of Margaash, describing it as a &quot;needless killing&quot;.

==Animals==

Dudley Zoo was home to a gorilla named Bonzo from 1962 until his death in 1994. Due to his local fame and connection with the zoo&#x27;s many visitors, a bust was erected of Bonzo in 2016.

In 2003, in common with other urban zoos, Dudley parted with their two female African elephants so that they could benefit from more spacious surroundings. The elephants were moved to West Midland Safari Park to benefit from a more spacious enclosure. The remaining large animals include giraffes, tigers, lions, reindeer, wallabies, and three snow leopards, the latest being born in May 2013. Primates are well represented, and there are several aviaries and a reptile house.

There was a time where Dudley Zoo housed polar bears and Southern elephant seals. Cuddles, a male orca, was housed at the zoo from 1971, until his death in February 1974. The dolphin and whale pools were modified seal and sea lions pools with the walls being built up to create more depth. However, these plans were in breach of the local planning laws and the zoo was ordered to return the pools to their original state. As the zoo was not prepared to invest in new purpose built pools Cuddles was put up for sale, but died before being moved, from long-term gastro-intestinal problems. The pools were returned to their original design and now house the zoo&#x27;s sea lions.

==Modernist Architecture==


The zoo buildings include twelve listed buildings, seven Grade II and five Grade II*, erected in 1937 by Berthold Lubetkin&#x27;s Tecton Group which employed, among others, structural engineer Ove Arup. Most of the zoo buildings are in the International Style (architecture).

In 2011, the zoo announced refurbishment and renovation plans for the zoo&#x27;s listed buildings and parts of the zoo itself; totalling £1.15 million. Initial funding for the project was met by the Heritage Lottery Fund.

In January 2013, newly released construction proposals indicated the entrance to the zoo would connect with the Black Country Museum and the Dudley Canal Trust, creating a single entrance for the three attractions. The new entrance was completed in September 2015. Focus will then shift to the bear pits, which zoo officials say will be renovated to provide &quot;a dramatic backdrop in the landscape&quot;. This was the subject of an investigation by the Born Free Foundation in 2012.

In November 2018 a £6 million expansion of the zoo was announced, where tunnels running underneath the Castle Hill site from the Second World War could be brought back, so that visitors can glimpse the mining history of Dudley. The zoo&#x27;s iconic 1930s Tecton buildings could also be refurbished with this £6 million expansion. The work began in 2020.

In February 2019 Dudley Zoo&#x27;s Director, Derek Grove, announced plans to renovate animal enclosures and improve visitor facilities. These new renovations included; refurbishing the Lemur walk-through exhibit, adding a new indoor adventure playground, extending the Sumatran Tiger exhibit, and bringing back the European brown bears.

==Artistic connections==

A painting by Percy Shakespeare, &quot;Tropical Bird House, Dudley Zoo&quot; (1939), is in Dudley Museum and Art Gallery.

In 2015, 89-year-old artist Rama Samaraweera, who was inspired to paint while a keeper at Dudley Zoo, donated three original oil paintings to the zoo to express his gratitude. His painting &quot;Clouded Leopard&quot; was a best-selling print in America in the 1970s. Animal Architecture (2015), a film by Adam Kossoff, narrated by Lenny Henry, explored the zoo and the restoration of Berthold Lubetkin&#x27;s animal enclosures.

==Castle==
Access to Dudley Castle, a Grade I listed building built in the 11th century, is included in the zoo entrance fee.

==Chairlift==
A visitor chairlift was opened between the zoo&#x27;s entrance and the castle on 11 May 1958 by Richard Hearne. It was taken out of use in 2000 due to health and safety concerns to the public. 

In August 2012 the chairlift was reopened after a 12-week, £117,000 Heritage Lottery Fund restoration which included returning it to its original light cream colour.

<text>Dudley Castle is a ruined fortification in the town of Dudley, West Midlands, England. Originally, a wooden motte and bailey castle built soon after the Norman Conquest, it was rebuilt as a stone fortification during the twelfth century but subsequently demolished on the orders of Henry II of England. The rebuilding of the castle took place in the second half of the thirteenth century. It culminated in the construction of a range of buildings within the fortifications by John Dudley. The fortifications were slighted by order of the Parliament of England during the English Civil War and the residential buildings were destroyed by fire in 1750. In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the site was used for fêtes and pageants. Today, Dudley Zoo is located on its grounds.

Its location, Castle Hill, is an outcrop of Wenlock Group limestone that was extensively quarried during the Industrial Revolution and which now, along with Wren&#x27;s Nest Hill, is a scheduled monument of the best-surviving remains of the limestone industry in Dudley. It is also a Grade I listed building. Localised structural problems led to it being placed on Historic England&#x27;s Heritage at Risk register in 2020.

The Dudley Tunnel runs beneath Castle Hill, but not the castle itself.

==History==
===Medieval===
The antiquarian William Camden claimed a castle was constructed at Dudley about the year 700 by a Mercian duke named Dodo or Doddo and some subsequent histories and articles repeated this claim. However, this assertion is not taken seriously by today&#x27;s historians, who usually date the castle from soon after the Norman Conquest of 1066. It is thought one of the Conqueror&#x27;s followers, Ansculf de Picquigny, built the first castle in 1070. The Domesday Book of 1086 records that Ansculf&#x27;s son, William Fitz-Ansculf, was in possession of the castle when it was recorded at the time of the survey of 1086. The first line of the Domesday entry for Dudley translates as: &quot;the said William held Dudley; and there is his castle&quot;. Some of the earthworks from this castle, notably the &quot;motte&quot;, the vast mound on which the present castle keep now sits, still remain. However, the earliest castle would have been of wooden construction and no longer exists.

After Fitz-Ansculf, the castle came into the possession of the Paganel family, who built the first stone castle on the site. This castle was strong enough to withstand a siege in 1138 by the forces of King Stephen. However, after Gervase Paganel joined a failed rebellion against King Henry II in 1173, the castle was demolished (slighted) by order of the king. According to historian Sidney Painter, it was one of at least 21 castles demolished on Henry II&#x27;s instructions. The Somery&#x27;s were the next dynasty to own the site when Ralph de Somery I succeeded his uncle, Gervase Paganel in 1194. Roger de Somery II set about rebuilding the castle in 1262. The castle was far from complete on the death of Roger de Somery II in 1272 and the construction carried on from this time into the 14th century by Roger&#x27;s heirs. The keep (the most obvious part of the castle when viewed from the town) and the main gate date from this re-building.

The last of the male line of Somery, John Somery, died in 1321. It is thought that the fortifications were complete by this date. The castle and estates passed to John Somery&#x27;s sister Margaret and her husband John de Sutton. Subsequently, members of this family often used Dudley as a surname. John and Margaret were only in possession of the castle for a few years before the property was seized by the younger Hugh Despenser, a favourite of Edward II of England. Despenser owned the castle from 1325 to 1326, being dispossessed when the king fell from power. The castle was returned to John and Margaret in 1327. It was probably during the time of John and Margaret&#x27;s son and successor John Sutton II that a chapel and great chamber were added within the castle walls. Following the death of John Sutton II, the castle passed to his wife, Isabel, daughter of John de Cherleton who held it until her death in 1397.

In 1532, another John Sutton inherited the castle but after having money problems, he was ousted by a relative, John Dudley, later Duke of Northumberland, in 1537. John Dudley was the great-grandson of John Sutton, 1st Baron Dudley and had risen to prominence during the reign of Henry VIII. Starting around 1540, a range of new buildings were erected within the older castle walls by him. The architect was William Sharington and the buildings are thus usually referred to as the Sharington Range. According to Historic England, the Sharrington Range represents &quot;one of the earliest known examples of the influence of the Italian Renaissance on the secular architecture of the West Midlands.&quot; John Dudley was executed in 1553 for his attempt to set Lady Jane Grey on the throne of England.

The castle was returned to the Sutton family by Queen Mary, ownership being given to Edward Sutton. The castle was visited by Queen Elizabeth I in August 1575 and was considered a possible place of imprisonment for Mary, Queen of Scots. However, the Sutton family were not destined to hold the castle for much longer and Edward Sutton&#x27;s son, Edward Sutton III, was the last of the male line to possess the property. In 1592, this Edward sent men to raid the property of Gilbert Lyttelton, carrying away cattle which were impounded in the Castle grounds. Financial difficulties continued to mount, however, until Edward Sutton III solved the problem by marrying his granddaughter and heir, Frances Sutton, to Humble Ward, the son of a wealthy merchant.

===Civil War===

During the First English Civil War, the castle was held by a Royalist garrison commanded by Colonel Thomas Leveson, a local Catholic who was later one of only 25 former Royalists listed by Parliament in 1651 as subject to &#x27;perpetual banishment and confiscation.&#x27;. It was besieged by Parliamentary forces in 1644 and finally surrendered to forces led by Sir William Brereton on 13 May 1646. The castle was partly demolished to prevent it from being used again and the present ruined appearance of the keep results from this decision. However, some habitable buildings remained and were subsequently used occasionally by the Earls of Dudley, although by this time they preferred to reside at Himley Hall, approximately four miles away, when in the Midlands.

===Final years and ruin===
A stable block was constructed on the site at some point before 1700. This was the final building to be constructed in the castle.

The bulk of the remaining habitable parts of the castle was destroyed by fire in 1750. However, in the nineteenth century, the site found a new use as a &#x27;Romantic Ruin&#x27; and a certain amount of tidying up of the site was carried out by the Earls of Dudley. Battlements on one of the remaining towers were reconstructed and two cannons captured during the Crimean Wars were installed. In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the site was used for fêtes and pageants. In 1937, when the Dudley Zoo was established, the castle grounds were incorporated into the zoo.

==Location==
The castle is located on a hill at one end of Dudley Town centre with the entrance (shared with Dudley Zoo) to the grounds off Castle Hill (the A459). The hill is an outcrop of limestone that was extensively quarried during the Industrial Revolution.

Despite being situated on the edge of Dudley town centre, historically, the castle was situated within the borders of Sedgley–which was part of neighbouring Staffordshire rather than Worcestershire as shown by the maps of Christopher Saxton drawn in 1579 and John Speed in 1610. The borders were changed to include the castle and its grounds within the Dudley borough only in 1926 when the restructuring of the boundaries took place to allow the development of the Priory Estate.

==The castle remains==

===Motte and bailey===

The motte is the oldest remaining structure at the castle site. It originally had a moat at its foot which could have been wet or dry. The motte has a core of limestone rubble encased in clay. It stands around 9 metres high. The oval-shaped bailey, which measures 100 metres north to south and 80 metres east to west is surrounded by a dry moat. In the medieval period, there were probably buildings in an outer court beyond the bailey moat.

===The keep===

The castle keep dates from the rebuilding that started in 1262. It rests on the motte, constructed in the Norman period but somewhat reduced in height afterwards. The original building was slightly rectangular in plan with approximate dimensions 15 metres north to south and 22 metres east to west. The four drum towers on each corner are 9.8 metres in diameter. After the slighting at the end of the civil war, only the north side of the castle and parts of two of the drum towers remain.

===Main gatehouse===


A little to the east of the keep is the main gatehouse. Like the keep, it was subject to slighting at the end of the Civil War. Some elements of Paganell&#x27;s Norman castle remain in the structure, but it mainly dates from the rebuilding carried out after 1262 by the de Somery family. A double gateway with two portcullises was constructed at this time. Under the Suttons, a barbican was added to the outside of the gatehouse so that the whole structure was sometimes called the &#x27;Triple Gate&#x27;. Originally, the gatehouse was connected to the keep by a thick curtain wall. When built, the gatehouse had three floors with the machinery for operating the portcullises on the first floor and a guardroom on the second floor. Above the guardroom were the battlements.

===Great chamber and chapel block===
Probably constructed during the time of John Sutton II but re-modelled in the Tudor era when the Sharington Range was built for John Dudley. The block was in ruins before the fire of 1750.

===Sharington range===
Constructed for John Dudley, starting around 1540, the three-storey range included a great hall, kitchen, servery, buttery, cellars and bedrooms. A small amount of masonry dating from the early Paganell castle is evident in the ruins. The range was destroyed by the fire of 1750.

===Stable block===
Once thought to be lodgings, the stable block was one of the last buildings constructed at the castle site, dating from before 1700. The block is situated between the Main Gate and the base of the motte.

===Elizabethan gatehouse and east watch tower===
In front of the main gate but further down the hill is a gatehouse dating from the Elizabethan era. A wall runs to the east of this gate to a round tower, built at the same time, known as the watch tower.

===Cannon===
Two Russian cannons brought back as trophies from the Crimean War are installed in prominent positions on the remains of the two south-facing drum towers. The cannons were brought to the castle in June 1857, during one of the Dudley Castle Fêtes.

==Visitor centre==

The castle visitor centre was opened by Queen Elizabeth II in June 1994, and amongst other exhibits housed a computer-generated reconstruction of the castle as it was in 1550, displayed through hardware that demonstrated an early use of the virtual tour concept.

==Claims of haunting==

Dudley Castle has the distinction of being haunted. Dudley is believed to be the most haunted castle in England. One of the supernatural presences that has usually been sighted at the site is the Grey Lady, who is believed to be the spirit of Dorothy Beaumont, a woman who died in the Castle, along with her baby, shortly after childbirth. She&#x27;d requested to be buried next to her daughter and for her husband to attend the funeral, but neither happened and so it&#x27;s thought she now wanders the castle and its grounds.

The ghost of Dorothy can often be seen near the castle keep and in the pub that was named after her on the castle grounds, the Grey Lady Tavern. Since opening, there have been many reports here, mostly of unexplained sounds, alarms going off in the middle of the night without explanation, and extreme drops in temperature that are often accompanied by a strange blue mist that floats through the bar.

Currently, it is believed that the most haunted place in the castle is its underground chapel, where there is an ancient stone coffin which is believed to have contained the body of John Somery, one of the lords of the Castle. Many people reported seeing what are believed to be Somery&#x27;s legs next to the coffin. 

==List of lords of Dudley Castle==
Dudley Castle was the capital of the feudal barony of Dudley, with several lords over its history:

* Ansculf de Picquigny, a Norman who took part in the Battle of Hastings
* William Fitz-Ansculf, his son
* Fulke Paganell (fl.1100-30)
* Ralph Paganell (fl.1130s-1150s), his son
* Gervase Paganell (d.1194), his son

<doc id="389682" wikidata="Q310123" url="?curid=389682" title="Jânio Quadros">
<text>Jânio da Silva Quadros (; 25 January 1917 – 16 February 1992) was a Brazilian lawyer and politician who served as the 22nd president of Brazil from 31 January to 25 August 1961, when he resigned from office. He also served as the 24th and 36th mayor of São Paulo, and the 18th governor of the state of São Paulo. Quadros was known for his populist style of government and eccentric behavior. 

As president, he focused on economic reform and attempted to root out corruption. He also pursued an independent foreign policy, trying to balance Brazil&#x27;s relations between the United States and the Eastern Bloc. Although he was elected by a huge margin, his term was marked by uncertainty and political instability, culminating in his resignation. That unexpected move caused a national crisis, with the presidency being assumed by João Goulart after the Legality Campaign.

== Early life == 
Quadros was born in Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul, on January 25, 1917, to Gabriel Quadros and Leonor da Silva Quadros. He attended the University of São Paulo, funded his education by teaching geography and Portuguese, and graduated in 1939 with a degree in law.

He then practiced law and taught geography at Dante Alighieri School, in São Paulo, until 1945, when he became involved in politics. 

== Early political career ==
In 1947, Quadros was elected to the city council of São Paulo, and he was a member until 1950. He was very active in the role and introduced more legislation than had any other member. Quadros ran for mayor of São Paulo in 1953 and defeated the well-funded establishment candidate, Francisco Cardoso, and served as mayor until 1955. During his time as mayor, Quadros gained a reputation for honesty and innovation. He frequently visited the poor neighborhoods of São Paulo and listened to the complaints of residents, which made him popular with the working class. He also succeeded in balancing the city&#x27;s budget in under a year, adding to his formidable reputation. 

In 1955, Quadros resigned in order to run for governor of the State of São Paulo. He defeated the experienced politician Adhemar de Barros, his longtime rival, by a margin of 1%. He served as governor until 1959, when he resigned to run for president. Quadros&#x27;s meteoric rise may be attributed to his widespread use of populist rhetoric and his extravagant behavior. He appealed to popular frustration with the government by making his campaign symbol a broom, symbolic of his pledge to &quot;sweep away corruption.&quot; He was also a very charismatic leader who proved adept at gaining the trust of the public.

== Election of 1960 ==
Prior to the 1960 election, Quadros was nominated by several opposition parties, forming a coalition of his National Labour Party, the Christian Democratic Party and the largest opposition party, the National Democratic Union (UDN). Although he was not an enthusiastic supporter of the UDN, it supported his candidacy because it lacked a viable alternative. Throughout the campaign, Quadros clashed with the UDN. His trip to communist Cuba in March 1960 demonstrated a clear disregard for the party&#x27;s preferred foreign policy. However, Quadros enjoyed widespread popularity with the Brazilian electorate. The ruling coalition, composed of the PSD and PTB, nominated Henrique Lott, the marshal of the Brazilian army. However, Lott was a flawed candidate whose stubbornness and bluntness cost him potential supporters. Quadros easily won, and his 15.6% margin of victory would be the largest margin for a presidential election held by popular vote until Fernando Henrique Cardoso won by 27% in 1994. Quadros&#x27;s share of the popular vote was 48%, larger than that of any previous president. Despite that success, the separate race for vice president was won by João Goulart, Lott&#x27;s running mate.

The election marked a historic moment in Brazilian history. When Quadros took office on January 31, 1961, it marked the first time since Brazil had become a republic in 1889 that an incumbent government peacefully transferred power to an elected member of the opposition. It was also the first time in 31 years that the presidency was not held by an heir to the legacy of Getúlio Vargas.

== Presidency ==

After his victory in the 1960 election, Quadros spent the three months before his inauguration traveling in Europe and refraining from discussing what he would do as president. His absence was criticized by many of his allies, who wanted him to take a more active role in preparing the administration to govern. Quadros took office on January 31, 1961. In his inaugural speech, he emphasized the issues of government inefficiency, inflation, and debt. Quadros laid the blame for the country&#x27;s high rate of inflation on his predecessor, Juscelino Kubitschek, whom he berated for nepotism and corruption. Quadros quickly replaced most incumbent ministers with members of the UDN and other parties that had supported him. However, the Movimento Popular Jânio Quadros was denied influence in the new government, despite its support for Quadros and its prominent role in the campaign. Despite his political skills, Quadros&#x27;s ability to govern effectively was hampered throughout his presidency by his inexperience with party politics and his small staff. 

===Domestic policy===

At the beginning of his presidency, Brazil was faced with high inflation and large debts to foreign countries. Quadros&#x27;s government announced an anti-inflation program in March that simplified exchange rates and cut public spending. The reforms gained the approval of the IMF, and Quadros was able to renegotiate debts with the United States and Europe. Brazil received a total of 1.64 billion dollars of new loans, greatly mitigating the debt crisis that it had been facing. That represented a major breakthrough for the Quadros administration, as several previous Brazilian presidents had failed to renegotiate the debt. In addition to his campaign against inflation, Quadros attempted to reduce bureaucratic inefficiency and corruption. He launched an anti-corruption campaign and largely bypassed the bureaucracy by issuing presidential decrees. However, the policies undermined morale within the government and alienated many members of Congress, and this was exacerbated by his failure to cooperate with his allies, as he rarely consulted the UDN on important decisions and held only two cabinet meetings in his first month in office. As president, Quadros also dissipated his energy on relatively unimportant issues, exerting significant effort to outlaw gambling and to ban women from wearing bikinis on the beach.

=== Foreign policy ===

Quadros pursued an independent foreign policy, outlining &quot;freedom, independence, and non-interference&quot; as his guiding principles. He also tried to pursue closer relationships with Africa, hoping to gain influence in the non-aligned movement. He attempted to show solidarity with newly independent African countries by promoting decolonization and opposing racism. He also tried to promote trade and cultural exchanges with those countries. However, Quadros&#x27;s government often supported states ruled by white minority governments, such as South Africa, which undermined his efforts. Quadros attempted to follow a neutral foreign policy, instead of the pro-American policies of his predecessors, and hoped to play the major powers against one another. However, his willingness to embrace the communist governments of Cuba, China, and the Soviet Union alienated many of his supporters, particularly the UDN. His decision to award the Order of the Southern Cross, Brazil&#x27;s highest medal for foreigners, to Che Guevara was particularly controversial and led many to suspect that he was a communist sympathizer. Quadros&#x27;s foreign policy was one of the most controversial aspects of his presidency and was a major factor in the decline of his support in Congress.

==Resignation==

In the summer of 1961, Quadros faced increasing opposition from Congress and had alienated many former allies. On August 25, 1961, he unexpectedly resigned, citing foreign and &quot;terrible occult forces&quot; in his cryptic resignation letter. It is commonly believed that his resignation was a move to increase his power and that Quadros expected to return to the presidency by the acclamation of the people or by the request of the National Congress of Brazil and the military. Based on Goulart&#x27;s unpopularity with the military and other conservative elements, he likely expected that his resignation would not be accepted. However, that maneuver was immediately rejected by the National Congress of Brazil, which accepted Quadros&#x27;s resignation and called on the president of the Chamber of Deputies of Brazil, Pascoal Ranieri Mazzilli, to take office until the vice president, João Goulart, could come back from his trip to China. Quadros&#x27;s resignation created a serious political crisis, setting the stage for the 1964 coup. The military, which feared Goulart&#x27;s leftist tendencies, seemed poised to oppose his inauguration by force. The United States was also concerned about the prospect of a Goulart presidency and considered supporting anti-Goulart forces. Goulart finally took the oath as president on September 7, 1961, but his power was restricted by an amendment to the constitution passed on September 2 that created a parliamentary system of government. Goulart was not of the same party as Quadros because, at that time, Brazilians could split their vote for president and vice president from different parties.

==Exile and return to politics== 
Shortly after his resignation, Quadros left the capital and traveled to Europe, promising to return to Brazil. The political crisis initiated by his resignation culminated in a military coup in 1964. The military did not allow him to participate in politics, but by the 1980s, Quadros had made a comeback. He joined the Brazilian Labor Party and was candidate for governor of São Paulo in 1982, only to be defeated by André Franco Montoro. Nevertheless, he was elected mayor of São Paulo in 1985, for the second time, defeating the favored candidate, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, later president of Brazil. Quadros served as mayor until 1988.

==Personal life==
Quadros married Eloa do Valle in 1942. His daughter, Dirce, was a member of the Brazilian National Congress.

He died of kidney and lung failure and a hemorrhage on February 16, 1992, at the Albert Einstein Hospital in São Paulo after being hospitalized for 12 days.

<doc id="389689" wikidata="Q1074135" url="?curid=389689" title="Veblen good">
<text>A Veblen good is a type of luxury good, named after American economist Thorstein Veblen, for which the demand increases as the price increases, in apparent contradiction of the law of demand, resulting in an upward-sloping demand curve.

The higher prices of Veblen goods may make them desirable as a status symbol in the practices of conspicuous consumption and conspicuous leisure. A product may be a Veblen good because it is a positional good, something few others can own.

== Background ==
Veblen goods are named after American economist Thorstein Veblen, who first identified conspicuous consumption as a mode of status-seeking (i.e., keeping up with the Joneses) in &quot;The Theory of the Leisure Class&quot; (1899). The testability of this theory was questioned by Colin Campbell due to the lack of complete honesty from research participants. However, research in 2007 studying the effect of social comparison on human brains can be used as an evidence supporting Veblen. The idea that seeking status can be an incentive to spend was also later discussed by Fred Hirsch.

Additionally, there have been different arguments on whether Veblen’s theory applies only to luxury goods or all goods.

== Analysis ==

A corollary of the Veblen effect is that lowering the price may increase the demand at first, but will decrease the quantity demanded afterwards.

The following concepts can explain the existence of Veblen goods:

* Pecuniary emulation (or pecuniary success), which leads to invidious comparison (or invidious distinction).
* Relative consumption trap.
* The inverse relationship between one’s well-being with another’s income.
* The suppression of explicit attempts to emphasize social status differences.

The theory of Veblen good made a significant contribution towards marketing and advertising. There are multiple studies considering Veblen goods as a tool to develop and maintain a strong relationship with consumers.

While Veblen goods are more affordable for high income households and affluent societies are usually known as the targeted income groups of Veblen brands, they have been experiencing a trend away from conspicuous consumption.  

== Ethical concerns ==
Being aware of the existence of Veblen goods, concerns were raised regarding their wastefulness as they are viewed as deadweight loss. Consuming Veblen goods also results in other financial and social consequences such as conspicuous demonstration of unequal wealth distribution and possible changes to optimal tax formulas. Another negative outcome is that this type of consumption can be a culprit of the future exacerbation of pollution.

Nonetheless, one exception is ethical consumers interested in virtue signaling through their consumption of goods and services. Veblen goods targeting this market segment must also be ethically manufactured to increase in their quantity demanded.

== Related concepts ==

The Veblen effect is one of a family of theoretical anomalies in the general law of demand in microeconomics. Related effects include:

* The snob effect: expressed preference for goods because they are different from those commonly preferred; in other words, the demand for a certain good by individuals of a higher income level is inversely related to its demand by those of a lower income level.
* The common law of business balance: the low price of a good is believed by many to indicate that the producer may have compromised quality, that is, &quot;you get what you pay for&quot;.
* The hot-hand fallacy: stock buyers have fallen prey to the fallacy that previous price increases suggest future price increases. Other rationales for buying a high-priced stock are that previous buyers who bid up the price are proof of the issue&#x27;s quality, or conversely, that an issue&#x27;s low price may be evidence of viability problems.

== Bandwagon effect ==
Sometimes, the value of a good increases as the number of buyers (or particular group of buyers and users) increases. This is called the bandwagon effect when it depends on the psychology of buying a product because it seems popular, or the network effect when numerous buyers or users itself increases the value of a good. For example, as the number of people with telephones or Facebook accounts increased, the value of having a telephone or a Facebook account increased, because users of those could reach more people. However, neither of these effects suggests that raising the price would boost demand at a given level of saturation.

== Relationship with laws of demand and supply ==
Veblen effects are discussed in a 1950 article by economist Harvey Leibenstein. Counter-examples have been called the counter-Veblen effect. The counter-Veblen effect occurs when preference for goods increases with the decrease in their price, thereby outperforming the supply and demand effect, as a result of conspicuous thrift amongst some consumers.

The effect on demand depends on the range of other goods available, their prices, and whether they serve as substitutes for the goods in question. The effects are anomalies within demand theory, because the theory normally assumes that preferences are independent of price or the number of units being sold. They are therefore collectively referred to as &quot;interaction effects&quot;.

Interaction effects are a different kind of anomaly from that posed by Giffen goods. The Giffen goods theory is one for which observed quantity demanded rises as price rises. Still, the effect arises without any interaction between price and preference—it results from the interplay of the &quot;income effect&quot; and the &quot;substitution effect&quot; of a price change.

<doc id="389693" wikidata="Q13089982" url="?curid=389693" title="New Rome">
<text>New Rome (, &quot;Néa Rhṓmē&quot;; ; ; ) was the original name given by the Roman emperor Constantine the Great to his new imperial capital in 330 CE, which was built as an expansion of the city of Byzantium on the European coast of the Bosporus strait. 

The city was founded as Byzantion () by Megarian colonists in 657 BCE. It was renamed by Constantine the Great first as &quot;New Rome&quot; (&quot;Nova Roma&quot;) during the official dedication of the city as the new Roman capital in 330 CE, which he soon afterwards changed to Constantinople (&quot;Constantinopolis&quot;). The city was officially renamed as Istanbul in the 20th century, after the establishment of the Turkish Republic in 1923.

Constantine essentially rebuilt the city on a monumental scale from 326 to 330, partly modeling it after Rome. Names of this period included , &quot;the New, second Rome&quot;; , ; , &quot;Byzantine Rome&quot;; , &quot;Eastern Rome&quot;; and &quot;Roma Constantinopolitana&quot;.

The term &quot;New Rome&quot; was used to indicate that Byzantium, thereafter Constantinople, was the second/new capital of the Roman Empire. In modern times, &quot;New Rome&quot; remains part of the official title of the Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarch of that city.

During the Tetrarchy system established by Diocletian in the 3rd century, Nicomedia (modern İzmit) near Istanbul was the Eastern (and most senior) capital of the Roman Empire (Diocletian had his seat in Nicomedia as the Augustus of the East). The last Roman co-emperor in Nicomedia, Licinius, was defeated by Constantine at the Battle of Chrysopolis (in the modern Üsküdar district on the Asian side of Istanbul) on 18 September 324. Constantine used Nicomedia as his interim capital city between 324 and 330, while rebuilding and expanding Byzantium as &quot;Nova Roma&quot; (which he soon renamed again as &quot;Constantinopolis&quot;). Constantine died at a villa near Nicomedia on 22 May 337.

MMORPGs are large multi-user games that take place in perpetual online worlds with a great number of other players. In most MMORPGs each player controls an avatar that interacts with other players, completes tasks to gain experience, and acquires items. MMORPGs use a wide range of business models, from free of charge, free with microtransactions, advertise funded, to various kinds of payment plans. Most early MMORPGs were text-based and web browser-based, later 2D, isometric, side-scrolling and 3D games emerged, including on video game consoles and mobile phones.

<text>The Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial is a presidential memorial in Washington D.C., dedicated to the memory of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the 32nd president of the United States, and to the era he represents. The memorial is one of two in Washington honoring Roosevelt.

Dedicated on May 2, 1997, by President Bill Clinton, the national memorial, spread over adjacent to the southwest side of the Tidal Basin along the Cherry Tree Walk in West Potomac Park, traces 12 years of the history of the United States through a sequence of four outdoor rooms, one for each of FDR&#x27;s terms of office. Sculptures inspired by photographs depict the 32nd president alongside his dog Fala.

Other sculptures depict scenes from the Great Depression, such as listening to a fireside chat on the radio and waiting in a bread line. A bronze statue of First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt standing before the United Nations emblem honors her work with the UN and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This is the only presidential memorial to depict a First Lady. 
Considering Roosevelt&#x27;s disability, the memorial&#x27;s designers intended to create a memorial that would be accessible to those with various physical impairments. Among other features, the memorial includes an area with tactile reliefs with braille writing for people who are blind. However, the memorial faced criticism from disabled activists. Vision-impaired visitors complained that the braille dots were improperly spaced and that some of the braille and reliefs were mounted eight feet off of the ground, placing it above the reach of most people.

==Design and features==


The memorial&#x27;s design and development represents the capstone of a distinguished career for the memorial&#x27;s designer, landscape architect Lawrence Halprin partly because Halprin had fond memories of Roosevelt, and partly because of the sheer difficulty of the task. 
Halprin won the competition for the Memorial&#x27;s design in 1974. However, Congress did not appropriate the funds to move beyond this conceptual stage for more than 20 years. Halprin collaborated with architect Robert Marquis who designed the visitor center in the winning plans.

The memorial&#x27;s design concept of four outdoor &quot;rooms&quot; and gardens is animated by water, stone, and sculpture. The national memorial now includes sculptures and works by Leonard Baskin, Neil Estern, Robert Graham, Tom Hardy, and George Segal.

Running water is an important physical and metaphoric component of the memorial. Each of the four &quot;rooms&quot; representing Roosevelt&#x27;s respective terms in office contains a waterfall. As one moves from room to room, the waterfalls become larger and more complex, reflecting the increasing complexity of a presidency marked by the vast upheavals of economic depression and world war.

Tour guides describe the symbolism of the five main water areas as:

* &quot;A single large drop&quot; – The crash of the economy that led to the Great Depression
* &quot;Multiple stairstep drops&quot; – The Tennessee Valley Authority dam-building project
* &quot;Chaotic falls at varying angles&quot; – World War II
* &quot;A still pool&quot; – Roosevelt&#x27;s death
* &quot;A wide array combining the earlier waterfalls&quot; – A retrospective of Roosevelt&#x27;s presidency

The architecture critic of the &quot;Washington Post&quot; stated that the memorial was designed &quot;to give people as many options as possible to go this way or that, to reverse directions, to pause, to start over, to be alone, to meet others, and to experience as many different sights, smells and sounds as the site permits.&quot;

When the memorial first opened, people were encouraged to wade into the fountains and waterfalls. However, within a matter of days, the National Park Service (NPS), which operates the Memorial, prohibited people from entering the water due to fear of accidents.

The site is a component of the NPS&#x27;s National Mall and Memorial Parks administrative unit. As a historic area that the NPS manages, the memorial was administratively listed on the National Register of Historic Places on the date of its establishment, May 2, 1997.

==Wheelchair depiction==
The statue of Franklin Delano Roosevelt stirred controversy over the issue of his disability. Designers decided against plans to have FDR shown in a wheelchair. Instead, the statue depicts the president in a chair with a cloak obscuring the chair, showing him as he appeared to the public during his life. Roosevelt&#x27;s reliance on a wheelchair was not publicized during his life, as there was a stigma of weakness and instability associated with any disability. However, historians and some disability-rights advocates wanted his disability to be shown for historical accuracy and to tell the story of what they believed to be the source of his strength. Other disability advocates, while not necessarily against showing him in a wheelchair, were wary of protests about the memorial that leaned toward making Roosevelt a hero because of his disability.

The sculptor added casters to the back of the chair in deference to advocates, making it a symbolic &quot;wheelchair&quot;. The casters are only visible behind the statue.
The National Organization on Disability, headed by the efforts of Alan Reich, raised US$1.65 million over two years to fund the addition of another statue that clearly showed the president in a wheelchair. In January 2001, the additional statue was placed near the memorial entrance showing FDR seated in a wheelchair much like the one he actually used. The memorial&#x27;s designer construed the wheelchair controversy as evidence of success: &quot;The most important thing about designing is to generate creativity in others, and to be inclusive – to include the needs and experiences of people interacting with the environment, and to let them be part of its creation.&quot;

==Original Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial==

During a conversation that he had with Supreme Court Associate Justice Felix Frankfurter in 1941, Roosevelt said that if he were to have a monument in Washington, it should be in front of the National Archives and should be no larger than his desk. A tall, long, wide block of white marble was subsequently dedicated in 1965 as his memorial near the southeast corner of Ninth Street NW and Pennsylvania Avenue NW, within a lawn in front of the National Archives Building. The engraved words on the memorial state: &quot;In Memory of Franklin Delano Roosevelt 1882–1945&quot;.

<doc id="389712" wikidata="Q2506756" url="?curid=389712" title="Priestley Riots">
<text>The Priestley Riots (also known as the Birmingham Riots of 1791) took place from 14 July to 17 July 1791 in Birmingham, England; the rioters&#x27; main targets were religious dissenters, most notably the politically and theologically controversial Joseph Priestley. Both local and national issues stirred the passions of the rioters, from disagreements over public library book purchases, to controversies over Dissenters&#x27; attempts to gain full civil rights and their support of the French Revolution.

The riots started with an attack on the Royal Hotel, Birmingham—the site of a banquet organised in sympathy with the French Revolution. Then, beginning with Priestley&#x27;s church and home, the rioters attacked or burned four Dissenting chapels, twenty-seven houses, and several businesses. Many of them became intoxicated by liquor that they found while looting, or with which they were bribed to stop burning homes. A small core could not be bribed, however, and remained sober. The rioters burned not only the homes and chapels of Dissenters, but also the homes of people they associated with Dissenters, such as members of the scientific Lunar Society.

While the riots were not initiated by Prime Minister William Pitt&#x27;s administration, the national government was slow to respond to the Dissenters&#x27; pleas for help. Local officials seem to have been involved in the planning of the riots, and were later reluctant to prosecute ringleaders. Industrialist James Watt wrote that the riots &quot;divided [Birmingham] into two parties who hate one another mortally&quot;. Those who had been attacked gradually left, leaving Birmingham a more conservative city than previously.

==Historical context==

===Birmingham===
Over the course of the eighteenth century, Birmingham became notorious for its riots, which were sparked by a number of causes. In 1714 and 1715, the townspeople, as part of a &quot;Church-and-King&quot; mob, attacked Dissenters (Protestants who did not adhere to the Church of England or follow its practices) in the Sacheverell riots during the London trial of Henry Sacheverell, and in 1751 and 1759 Quakers and Methodists were assaulted. During the anti-Catholic Gordon Riots in 1780, large crowds assembled in Birmingham. In 1766, 1782, 1795, and 1800 mobs protested about high food prices. One contemporary described Birmingham rioters as the &quot;bunting, beggarly, brass-making, brazen-faced, brazen-hearted, blackguard, bustling, booby Birmingham mob&quot;.

Up until the late 1780s, religious divisions did not affect Birmingham&#x27;s elite. Dissenter and Anglican lived side by side harmoniously: they were on the same town promotional committees; they pursued joint scientific interests in the Lunar Society; and they worked together in local government. They stood united against what they viewed as the threat posed by unruly plebeians. After the riots, however, scientist and clergyman Joseph Priestley argued in his &quot;An Appeal to the Public on the Subject of the Birmingham Riots&quot; (1791) that this cooperation had not in fact been as amicable as generally believed. Priestley revealed that disputes over the local library, Sunday Schools, and church attendance had divided Dissenters from Anglicans. In his &quot;Narrative of the Riots in Birmingham&quot; (1816), stationer and Birmingham historian William Hutton agreed, arguing that five events stoked the fires of religious friction: disagreements over inclusion of Priestley&#x27;s books in the local public library; concerns over Dissenters&#x27; attempts to repeal the Test and Corporation Acts; religious controversy (particularly involving Priestley); an &quot;inflammatory hand-bill&quot;; and a dinner celebrating the outbreak of the French Revolution.

Once Birmingham Dissenters started to agitate for the repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts, which restricted Dissenters&#x27; civil rights (preventing them, for instance, from attending the Universities of Oxford or Cambridge, or from holding public office), the semblance of unity among the town&#x27;s elite disappeared. Unitarians such as Priestley were at the forefront of the repeal campaign, and orthodox Anglicans grew nervous and angry. After 1787, the emergence of Dissenting groups formed for the sole purpose of overturning these laws began to divide the community; however, the repeal efforts failed in 1787, 1789 and 1790. Priestley&#x27;s support of the repeal and his heterodox religious views, which were widely published, inflamed the populace. In February 1790, a group of activists came together not only to oppose the interests of the Dissenters but also to counteract what they saw as the undesirable importation of French Revolutionary ideals. Dissenters by and large supported the French Revolution and its efforts to question the role monarchy should play in government.
One month before the riots, Priestley attempted to found a reform society, the Warwickshire Constitutional Society, which would have supported universal suffrage and short Parliaments. Although this effort failed, the efforts to establish such a society increased tensions in Birmingham.

In addition to these religious and political differences, both the lower-class rioters and their upper-class Anglican leaders had economic complaints against the middle-class Dissenters. They envied the ever-increasing prosperity of these industrialists as well as the power that came with that economic success. Historian R. B. Rose refers to these industrialists as belonging to &quot;an inner elite of magnates&quot;. Priestley himself had written a pamphlet, &quot;An Account of a Society for Encouraging the Industrious Poor&quot; (1787), on how best to extract the most work for the smallest amount of money from the poor. Its emphasis on debt collection did not endear him to the poverty-stricken.

===British reaction to the French Revolution===

The British public debate over the French Revolution, or the Revolution Controversy, lasted from 1789 through 1795. Initially many on both sides of the Channel thought the French would follow the pattern of the English Glorious Revolution of a century before, and the Revolution was viewed positively by a large portion of the British public. Most Britons celebrated the storming of the Bastille in 1789, believing that France&#x27;s absolute monarchy should be replaced by a more democratic form of government. In these heady early days, supporters of the Revolution also believed that Britain&#x27;s own system would be reformed as well: voting rights would be broadened and redistribution of Parliamentary constituency boundaries would eliminate so-called &quot;rotten boroughs&quot;.

After the publication of statesman and philosopher Edmund Burke&#x27;s &quot;Reflections on the Revolution in France&quot; (1790), in which he surprisingly broke ranks with his liberal Whig colleagues to support the French aristocracy, a pamphlet war discussing the Revolution began in earnest. Because Burke had supported the American colonists in their rebellion against Great Britain, his views sent a shockwave through the country. While Burke supported aristocracy, monarchy, and the Established Church, liberals such as Charles James Fox supported the Revolution, and a programme of individual liberties, civic virtue and religious toleration, while radicals such as Priestley, William Godwin, Thomas Paine, and Mary Wollstonecraft, argued for a further programme of republicanism, agrarian socialism, and abolition of the &quot;landed interest&quot;. Alfred Cobban called the debate that erupted &quot;perhaps the last real discussion of the fundamentals of politics in [Britain]&quot;.

==Hints of trouble==

On 11 July 1791, a Birmingham newspaper announced that on 14 July, the second anniversary of the storming of the Bastille, there would be a dinner at the local Royal Hotel to commemorate the outbreak of the French Revolution; the invitation encouraged &quot;any Friend to Freedom&quot; to attend:

Alongside this notice was a threat: &quot;an authentic list&quot; of the participants would be published after the dinner. On the same day, &quot;an ultra-revolutionary&quot; handbill, written by James Hobson (although his authorship was not known at the time), entered circulation. Town officials offered 100 guineas for information regarding the publication of the handbill and its author, to no avail. The Dissenters found themselves forced to plead ignorance and decry the &quot;radical&quot; ideas promoted by the handbill. It was becoming clear by 12 July that there would be trouble at the dinner. On the morning of 14 July graffiti such as &quot;destruction to the Presbyterians&quot; and &quot;Church and King for ever&quot; were scrawled across the town. At this point, Priestley&#x27;s friends, fearing for his safety, dissuaded him from attending the dinner.

==14 July==

About 90 hardy sympathisers of the French Revolution came to celebrate on 14 July; the banquet was led by James Keir, an Anglican industrialist who was a member of the Lunar Society of Birmingham. When the guests arrived at the hotel at 2 or 3 p.m., they were greeted by 60 or 70 protesters who temporarily dispersed while yelling, rather bizarrely and confusingly, &quot;no popery&quot;. By the time the celebrants ended their dinner, around 7 or 8 p.m., a crowd of hundreds had gathered. The rioters, who &quot;were recruited predominantly from the industrial artisans and labourers of Birmingham&quot;, threw stones at the departing guests and sacked the hotel. The crowd then moved on to the Quaker meeting-house, until someone yelled that the Quakers &quot;never trouble themselves with anything, neither on one side nor the other&quot; and convinced them instead to attack the New Meeting chapel, where Priestley presided as minister. The New and Old Meeting Houses, two Dissenting chapels, were set alight.

The rioters proceeded to Priestley&#x27;s home, Fairhill at Sparkbrook. Priestley barely had time to evacuate and he and his wife fled from Dissenting friend to friend during the riots. Writing shortly after the event, Priestley described the first part of the attack, which he witnessed from a distance:

His son, William, stayed behind with others to protect the family home, but they were overcome and the property was eventually looted and razed to the ground. Priestley&#x27;s valuable library, scientific laboratory, and manuscripts were largely lost in the flames.

==15, 16 and 17 July==

The Earl of Aylesford attempted to stem the mounting violence on the night of 14 July, but despite having the help of other magistrates, he was unable to control the crowd. On 15 July, the mob liberated prisoners from the local gaol. Thomas Woodbridge, the Keeper of the Prison, deputised several hundred people to help him quell the mob, but many of these joined in with the rioters themselves. The crowd destroyed John Ryland&#x27;s home, Baskerville House, and drank the supplies of liquor that they found in the cellar. When the newly appointed constables arrived on the scene, the mob attacked and disarmed them. One man was killed. The local magistrates and law enforcement, such as it was, did nothing further to restrain the mob and did not read the Riot Act until the military arrived on 17 July. Other rioters burned down banker John Taylor&#x27;s home at Bordesley Park.

On 16 July, the homes of Joseph Jukes, John Coates, John Hobson, Thomas Hawkes, and John Harwood (the latter a blind Baptist minister) were all ransacked or burned. The Baptist Meeting at Kings Heath, another Dissenting chapel, was also destroyed. William Russell and William Hutton, tried to defend their homes, but to no avail—the men they hired refused to fight the mob. Hutton later wrote a narrative of the events:

When the rioters arrived at John Taylor&#x27;s other house at Moseley, Moseley Hall, they carefully moved all of the furniture and belongings of its current occupant, the frail Dowager Lady Carhampton, a relative of George III, out of the house before they burned it: they were specifically targeting those who disagreed with the king&#x27;s policies and who, in not conforming to the Church of England, resisted state control. The homes of George Russell, a Justice of the Peace, Samuel Blyth, one of the ministers of New Meeting, Thomas Lee, and a Mr. Westley all came under attack on the 15th and 16th. The manufacturer, Quaker, and member of the Lunar Society Samuel Galton only saved his own home by bribing the rioters with ale and money.
By 2 p.m. on 16 July, the rioters had left Birmingham and were heading towards Kings Norton and the Kingswood Chapel; it was estimated that one group of the rioters totalled 250 to 300 people. They burned Cox&#x27;s farm at Warstock and looted and attacked the home of a Mr. Taverner. When they reached Kingswood, Warwickshire, they burned the Dissenting chapel and its manse. By this time, Birmingham had shut down—no business was being conducted.

Contemporary accounts record that the mob&#x27;s last sustained assault was around 8 p.m. on 17 July. About 30 &quot;hard core&quot; rioters attacked the home of William Withering, an Anglican who attended the Lunar Society with Priestley and Keir. But Withering, aided by a group of hired men, managed to fend them off. When the military finally arrived to restore order on 17 and 18 July, most of the rioters had disbanded, although there were rumours that mobs were destroying property in Alcester and Bromsgrove.

All in all, four Dissenting churches had been severely damaged or burned down and twenty-seven homes had been attacked, many looted and burned. Having begun by attacking those who attended the Bastille celebration, the &quot;Church-and-King&quot; mob had finished up by extending their targets to include Dissenters of all kinds as well as members of the Lunar Society.

==Aftermath and trials==
Priestley and other Dissenters blamed the government for the riots, believing that William Pitt and his supporters had instigated them; however, it seems from the evidence that the riots were actually organised by local Birmingham officials. Some of the rioters acted in a co-ordinated fashion and seemed to be led by local officials during the attacks, prompting accusations of premeditation. Some Dissenters discovered that their homes were to be attacked several days before the rioters arrived, leading them to believe that there was a prepared list of victims. The &quot;disciplined nucleus of rioters&quot;, which numbered only thirty or so, directed the mob and stayed sober throughout the three to four days of rioting. Unlike the hundreds of others who joined in, they could not be bribed to stop their destructions. Essayist William Hazlitt&#x27;s first published work was a letter to the &quot;Shrewsbury Chronicle&quot;, printed later in July 1791, condemning the Priestley riots; Priestley had been one of (then 13-year-old) Hazlitt&#x27;s teachers.

If a concerted effort had been made by Birmingham&#x27;s Anglican elite to attack the Dissenters, it was more than likely the work of Benjamin Spencer, a local minister, Joseph Carles, a Justice of the Peace and landowner, and John Brooke (1755-1802), an attorney, coroner, and under-sheriff. Although present at the riot&#x27;s outbreak, Carles and Spencer made no attempt to stop the rioters, and Brooke seems to have led them to the New Meeting chapel. Witnesses agreed &quot;that the magistrates promised the rioters protection so long as they restricted their attacks to the meeting-houses and left persons and property alone&quot;. The magistrates also refused to arrest any of the rioters and released those that had been arrested. Instructed by the national government to prosecute the riot&#x27;s instigators, these local officials dragged their heels. When finally forced to try the ringleaders, they intimidated witnesses and made a mockery of the trial proceedings. Only seventeen of the fifty rioters who had been charged were ever brought to trial; four were convicted, of whom one was pardoned, two were hanged, and the fourth was transported to Botany Bay. But Priestley and others believed that these men were found guilty not because they were rioters but because &quot;they were infamous characters in other respects&quot;.

Although he had been forced to send troops to Birmingham to quell the disturbances, King George III commented, &quot;I cannot but feel better pleased that Priestley is the sufferer for the doctrines he and his party have instilled, and that the people see them in their true light.&quot; The national government forced the local residents to pay restitution to those whose property had been damaged: the total eventually amounted to £23,000. However, the process took many years, and most residents received much less than the value of their property.

After the riots, Birmingham was, according to industrialist James Watt, &quot;divided into two parties who hate one another mortally&quot;. Initially Priestley wanted to return and deliver a sermon on the Bible verse &quot;Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do,&quot; but he was dissuaded by friends convinced that it was too dangerous. Instead, he wrote his &quot;Appeal&quot;:
The riots revealed that the Anglican gentry of Birmingham were not averse to using violence against Dissenters whom they viewed as potential revolutionaries. They had no qualms, either, about raising a potentially uncontrollable mob. Many of those attacked left Birmingham; as a result, the town became noticeably more conservative after the riots. The remaining supporters of the French Revolution decided not to hold a dinner celebrating the storming of the Bastille the next year.

<text>Kevin Mann (born January 10, 1969), better known by his stage name Brotha Lynch Hung, is an American rapper, songwriter and record producer from Sacramento, California who was described in 2005 as &quot;the creator of horrorcore rap&quot;. He is also a former 24th Street Garden Blocc Crip gang member, which is a Crip-affiliated street gang based in Meadowview, Sacramento.

==Early life==
Mann grew up in Sacramento. He became a fan of East Coast rappers such as Rakim and Slick Rick. He started rapping at the age of 13. He became a member of the 24 Street Garden Blocc Crips by age 16 during the 1980s. He was once shot in the side after trying to break up a confrontation between a Crip and a Blood at a house party; the bullet was never removed.

==Career==

===Musical style===
Although often credited as being a major pioneer and even the main creator of the horrorcore rap genre, Mann himself has claimed that his style is less literally “horrorcore” and instead falls more directly under his own distinct category or sub-category of rap called rip gut, which specifically emphasizes (usually) graphic violence.

The ripgut genre itself reportedly stemmed from his love of meat, but this lyrical style is also sometimes considered to be either associated with or connected to the common thoughts and feelings occasionally experienced during manic and/or violent states of mind brought on by the use of certain illicit drugs such as phencyclidine (PCP).

===1993–2002: Black Market Records===
In 1993, Mann signed to Black Market Records and released his debut EP, &quot;24 Deep&quot;. followed by the album &quot;Season of da Siccness&quot; in 1995. &quot;24 Deep&quot; reached No. 91 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, and &quot;Season of da Siccness&quot; reached No. 26.

Mann appeared on several No Limit Records 1997 releases such as &quot;West Coast Bad Boyz II&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Bout It&quot;, and Mr. Serv-On&#x27;s &quot;Life Insurance&quot;. He wrote and produced all of his appearances.

2000 marked the release of Mann&#x27;s first and only starring role in a film, &quot;Now Eat&quot;, a horror comedy based on his music, while an album of the same name was released to coincide with the film.

After Mann released his second LP, &quot;Loaded&quot;, he began a long-standing feud with label head Cedric Singleton over the rights to his back catalog. Singleton released Mann&#x27;s next album &quot;EBK4&quot; without Mann&#x27;s permission, using other artists off the label to complete unfinished songs. This practice continued with his next solo album &quot;The Virus&quot; in 2001, and three compilations, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Remains: Book II&quot;, and &quot;Book III&quot;, in 2002.

===2003–2008: &quot;Lynch by Inch: Suicide Note&quot;, &quot;The Ripgut Collection&quot; and &quot;Snuff Tapes&quot;===
Mann left Black Market in 2003 and had three releases on different record labels during the next few years. He released &quot;Lynch by Inch: Suicide Note&quot; in June 2003 under Madesicc Music. He then released &quot;The Ripgut Collection&quot; compilation on Madesicc in 2007 and &quot;Snuff Tapes&quot; &quot;mix tape&quot; in 2008 available on Siccness.net. Both releases enter the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums peaking at 55 and 78 respectively.

===2009–2013: Strange Music===
In May 2009, Mann signed a contract with Strange Music. He released three albums on the label, &quot;Dinner and a Movie&quot; (2010), &quot;Coathanga Strangla&quot; (2011), and &quot;Mannibalector&quot; (2013). The label offered to extend his contract after the third album was released, but he decided to stay on his own label Madesicc Musicc.

===2013–present: Madesicc Musicc===
After leaving Strange Music, Mann released several independent EPs and a collaboration album with Ren Da Heatmonsta titled &quot;Premeditated&quot; (2017). 

In 2023, Mann released a compilation album titled &quot;Choice Kuttz: Da Best of Brotha Lynch Hung&quot;, marking his return to the hip-hop scene.

<text>The Volvo 140 Series is a line of mid-size cars manufactured and marketed by Volvo from 1966 to 1974 in two and four door sedan (models 142 and 144 respectively) as well as five door station wagon (model 145) body styles—with numerous intermediate facelifts. More than a million Volvo 140s were built in 8 years.

==Introduction==
Volvo Cars began manufacturing the Volvo 144 at Torslandaverken in the late summer of 1966 for the 1967 model year. The 144 series, which followed the Volvo Amazon (120 series, outside of Sweden), was the first Volvo to use a tri-digit nomenclature, where the first digit indicated series, second digit indicated the number of cylinders, and third digit indicated the number of doors. Thus, a &quot;144&quot; was a 1st series, 4-cylinder, 4-door sedan. The 144 was the first Volvo to feature a more rectilinear or boxy styling. Compared to the Volvo Amazon, the 140 was a radical departure with minimal exterior and interior carryover, notably a stylised version of the front split grille. The car&#x27;s basic shape would survive into the 1990s as the 200 series. Mechanically, the car used many of the same drivetrain components as the Amazon, but also showcased many improvements, including disc brakes on all four wheels. It was named car of the year in 1966 by Swedish magazine &quot;Teknikens Värld&quot;. The engine in the standard 144 was the same as found in the standard Amazon (121), the 1.8l B18A, but the 144S was given the more powerful B18B from the 123GT and 1800S. Late in the 1967 model year production of the Volvo 142 (2-door sedan) began, in time to build 1500 units for the first year. In 1968 production of the Volvo 145 5-door station wagon began, completing the three body styles used in the 140 range.

== Model updates ==
For the 1969 model year Volvo enlarged the B18 to become the 2.0 litre B20 and replaced the generator with a more modern alternator. It was also in 1969 that Volvo introduced the 164, which shared much of the 140 series structure and styling aft of the windshield while incorporating a six-cylinder engine, the B30 which was simply a B20 with two more cylinders and a few strengthened and enlarged components. Volvo also introduced the Express this year (see below).

In 1970 a flow-through ventilation system, where vents were added towards the rear of the car (on the exterior under the rear window on the 142 and 144 and as a grille next to the right side taillight of the 145) and electrically defrosted rear windows, were introduced. The split rear side window on the 145 became one piece which was no longer possible to open.

In 1971 the first of several styling changes were introduced, including a revised black grille which saw the now ubiquitous Volvo diagonal line introduced as well as new wheels. A console on the transmission tunnel with a clock was now standard. Model year 1971 also saw the introduction of the B20E, which was a high compression version of the B20 which introduced Bosch D-Jetronic electronic fuel injection, giving a power figure of DIN or SAE. These new cars were either given the designation E (the German word Einspritzung, or &quot;injection&quot;) or GL (for Grand Luxe), which was a more upmarket version of the car. The Grand Luxe received a four-speed manual with overdrive as standard fitment, with an automatic optional.

The styling changes continued in 1972 with the introduction of flush mounted door handles and a slightly revised dashboard with fake woodgrain trim, newly designed switches and a small central panel with a clock. The transmission tunnel was taken from the 164 as was the same short-shifter gear stick and the automatic transmission became controlled by a selector mounted on the floor at the same place. The outer rear seats now had the mounting points for retractable seatbelts. A low compression fuel injected engine (8.7:1), the B20F was introduced for the US and certain other markets.

In 1973 the 140 series received a major facelift, with a new plastic grille, new larger indicators and a completely revised tail end. Also, the S designation was dropped and the range consisted of three trim levels, standard (with no designation, known as L, or &quot;luxe&quot;), de Luxe, and the most upmarket, Grand Luxe. The interior also had a completely redesigned padded dashboard with a new instrument cluster consisting of dials rather than the strip speedometer previously used, rocker switches replacing the push-pull switches (with the exception of the headlight switch), and vents to direct air towards the person augmenting the defrost and floor vents. This dashboard in its basic form was carried over to the 200-series with only small modifications.

In 1974, the B20E/F engine switched from using the Bosch D-Jetronic to the K-Jetronic mechanical fuel injection system. Also, several safety changes were introduced including a fuel tank that was located close to the axle to protect it in the case of a rear-end collision, and larger bumpers that protruded more from the body. The quarter-light windows in the front doors were removed as a result of the improvements in ventilation inside the car, and small anodised aluminium strips were added to the bottom of the side windows. US-market cars received the emissions-scrubbed B20F engine producing at 6000 rpm.

A total of 412,986 2-door sedans, 523,808 4-door sedans, and 268,317 5-door station wagons were produced.

In 1974, the 140 series evolved into the 240 series for the 1975 model year. The 164 was continued for another year in certain markets.

== 145 Express ==

As a replacement for the Volvo Duett, Volvo produced a high roofed version of the Volvo 145 station wagon, known as the 145 Express. From the windscreen back, the roof was raised by approximately , and from the B-pillar back it was raised again by about . It was available in three configurations: standard station wagon (full glazing and five seats with the option of an extra two rear-facing seats), fully glazed panel-van with only two seats, and a two-seater panel van with no glass in the rear doors and rear quarter panels. It found a niche market, and several coachbuilder firms later made Express versions of the 245. Its rear hatch was made of glass-reinforced plastic.

<text>The &quot;Gibraltar Anthem&quot; is the national song of the British overseas territory of Gibraltar.

In common with the United Kingdom, Crown dependencies and other British territories, the official national anthem of Gibraltar is &quot;God Save the King&quot;. The Gibraltar anthem is the national song, and was chosen in a competition in 1994. Both the lyrics and music were composed by Peter Emberley, who is not a Gibraltarian.

The anthem is sung every 10 September by the general public at the annual release of red and white ticker paper on Gibraltar National Day. Balloons used to be released, but this was stopped following concerns about the impact on the environment.

<text>Anna Seward (12 December 174225 March 1809) was an English Romantic poet, often called the Swan of Lichfield. She benefited from her father&#x27;s progressive views on female education.

==Life==
===Family life===

Seward was the elder of two surviving daughters of Thomas Seward (1708–1790), a prebendary of Lichfield and Salisbury and an author, and his wife Elizabeth. Elizabeth later had three further children (John, Jane and Elizabeth), who all died in infancy, and two stillbirths. Anna Seward mourned their loss in her poem &quot;Eyam&quot; (1788). Born in 1742 at Eyam, a mining village in the Peak District of Derbyshire, where her father was Rector, she and her sister Sarah, some 16 months younger, passed nearly all their life in that small area of the Peak District of Derbyshire, and at Lichfield, a cathedral city in adjacent Staffordshire.

In 1749, Anna&#x27;s father was appointed a Canon-Residentiary at Lichfield Cathedral. The family moved there, where her father educated her at home. In 1754 they moved into the Bishop&#x27;s Palace in Cathedral Close. When a family friend, Mrs Edward Sneyd, died in 1756, the Sewards took in one of her daughters, Honora Sneyd, who became an adopted foster sister to Anna. Honora was nine years younger. Anna Seward described in a poem, &quot;The Anniversary&quot; (1769), how she and her sister first met Honora on returning from a walk. Sarah (known as Sally) died suddenly of typhus at the age of 19 in 1764. She was said to have an admirable character, though less talented than her sister. Anna consoled herself with affection for Honora Sneyd, as she describes in &quot;Visions&quot;, written a few days after her sister&#x27;s death. There she expresses a hope that Honora (&quot;this transplanted flower&quot;) would replace her sister (referred to as Alinda) in her and her parents&#x27; affections.

Anna Seward cared for her father in the last ten years of his life, after he had suffered a stroke. When he died in 1790, he left her financially independent with an income of £400 per annum. She continued to dwell at the Bishop&#x27;s Palace until she died in 1809.

===Anecdotes===
Seward, as a long-term friend of the Levett family of Lichfield, noted in her &quot;Memoirs of the Life of Dr. Darwin&quot; (Erasmus) that three of the town&#x27;s foremost citizens were thrown from their carriages and injured their knees in the same year. &quot;No such misfortune,&quot; Seward wrote, &quot;was previously remembered in that city, nor has it recurred through all the years which since elapsed.&quot;

===Education and career===
Anna showed a bent for learning from early childhood. Canon Seward, author of &quot;The Female Right to Literature&quot; (1748), held progressive views on female education. Encouraged by her father, Anna was said to be able to recite works of Milton by the age of three.

Her gift for writing was clear at the age of seven, when the family moved to Lichfield. The family home in the Bishop&#x27;s Palace became the centre of a literary circle that included Erasmus Darwin, Samuel Johnson and James Boswell, where Anna was encouraged to join in, as she later relates. Canon Seward&#x27;s (if not his wife&#x27;s) attitudes to educating girls was progressive for the time, but not excessively so. He was a poet himself, yet tried to curb Anna&#x27;s passion for poetry, although she chose the composition of it for her own studies. Among the subjects he taught were theology and numeracy, how to read and appreciate poetry, and how to write and recite it, although these deviated from the conventional drawing-room accomplishments of the time. The omissions were also notable, including languages and science, although the girls could pursue them alone if they felt inclined. Nor was Anna unskilled in domestic matters.

Among many literary figures Anna Seward conversed with was Sir Walter Scott, who later published her poetry posthumously. Also in her circle were the writers Thomas Day, Francis Noel Clarke Mundy, Sir Brooke Boothby, Willie Newton (the Peak Minstrel) and Mary Martha Sherwood. She came to be seen as heading a coterie of regional poets, influenced by writers such as Thomas Whalley, William Hayley, Robert Southey, Helen Maria Williams, Hannah More and the Ladies of Llangollen. She was also involved in the Lunar Society in Birmingham, which would sometimes meet at their home. Both Darwin and Day belonged. Seward corresponded with other members such as Josiah Wedgwood and Richard Lovell Edgeworth.

Between 1775 and 1781, Seward was a guest and participant at a much-mocked salon held by Anna Miller at Batheaston, near Bath. However, it was there that Seward&#x27;s talent was recognised. Her work appeared in the yearbook of poems from the gatherings, a debt that Seward acknowledged in &quot;Poem to the Memory of Lady Miller&quot; (1782).

===Relationships===
Seward remained single, despite offers and friendships. She was outspoken about the institution of marriage, not unlike her heroine in &quot;Louisa&quot;, a position later echoed in the novels of her step-niece, Maria Edgeworth. She shunned marriage and sexual love as inferior to the equality and virtue of Aristotelian friendship. She had friends of both genders, although only seeking romantic relations with women. In 1985 Lillian Faderman suggested that her orientation was lesbian, but there is little known evidence of the erotic or sexual in her ties and the term relates more to 20th than to 18th-century concepts of identity. Since 1985, Seward remains within the lesbian poetic canon, but Teresa Barnard argues against this, based more on examining her correspondence than on her poetry, while more recently Redford Barrett has argued for it, based on other sources. It is also known that Seward named her pet dog Sappho, after the sixth-century BCE poet of the same name.

Much of the literature on Seward&#x27;s relations focuses on her childhood friend Honora Sneyd: sonnets reveal her passion for her when they were together and her despair when Sneyd married Richard Edgeworth. Compared with the correspondence, her sonnets display more intense emotion, such as Sonnet 10 (&quot;Honora, shou&#x27;d that cruel time arrive&quot;), which describes feelings of betrayal. When the Edgeworths moved to Ireland, despair turned to anger, as in Sonnet 14 (&quot;Ingratitude, how deadly is thy smart&quot;).

==Work==

===Poetry===
Seward began to write poetry early with encouragement from her father, a published poet, but against the wishes of her mother. When Anna was 16, her father revised his position, fearing she might become a &quot;learned lady&quot;. Later she was encouraged by Dr Erasmus Darwin, who set up a medical practice in Lichfield in 1756, although their relations with him included frequent conflicts.

Her verses, which date from at least 1759, include elegies and sonnets, and a verse-novel, &quot;Louisa&quot; (1784), of which five editions were published. However, she did not publish her first poem until 1780, at the age of 38. Seward&#x27;s many letters and other writings have been called &quot;commonplace&quot;. Horace Walpole said she had &quot;no imagination, no novelty&quot;, but she was praised by Mary Scott, who had written admiringly of her father&#x27;s attitude to female education.

Several poems, particularly Lichfield ones, concern her friend and adopted sister Honora Sneyd, in a tradition described as &quot;female friendship poetry&quot;. Seward struck a middle path in a period when women had to tread carefully. Her work could also be arch and teasing, as in her poem &quot;Portrait of Miss Levett&quot;, on a Lichfield beauty later married to Rev. Richard Levett. She contributed to Boswell&#x27;s &quot;Life of Samuel Johnson&quot; (1791), but was less than happy with Boswell&#x27;s treatment of her material. Her work circulated widely.

Authorship has been a continuing problem in assessing her work. She was known to suggest others had used her work as their own: &quot;a charge of plagiarism must rest somewhere.&quot;

===Correspondence and biography===
Seward was a prodigious correspondent. Six vast volumes of her letters appeared posthumously in 1811, revealing broad knowledge of English literature and casting light on Midland literary culture in her day. Early on, in 1762–1768, she used an imaginary friend, Emma, to express her thoughts, writing 39 letters to her. She was seen variously as an authority on English literature by contemporaries such as Walter Scott, Samuel Johnson and Robert Southey. She also wrote a biography: &quot;Memoirs of the Life of Dr. Darwin&quot; (1804).

===Science===
Keenly interested in botany, Seward associated closely with the Lichfield Botanical Society (despite the name, composed of only three men: Erasmus Darwin, Sir Brooke Boothby and John Jackson) and published anonymously in its name. She was encouraged by Darwin to reject a conservative backlash to the revelations of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s sexual system of plant classification. This was seen as unfitting for ladies&#x27; modesty. &quot;I had heard it was not fit for the female eye. It can only be unfit for the perusal of such females as still believe the legend of their nursery that children are dug out of a parsley-bed; who have never been at church, or looked into a Bible, – and are totally ignorant that in the present state of the world, two sexes are necessary to the production of animals.&quot;

This caution prevailed through most of the 19th century, typically from writers such as Richard Polwhele, in his poem &quot;The Unsex&#x27;d Females&quot; (1798), although she escaped his personal criticism, being considered to have a proper attitude.

==Legacy==
After Seward&#x27;s death, Sir Walter Scott edited her &quot;Poetical Works&quot; in three volumes (Edinburgh, 1810). To these he prefixed a memoir of the author and extracts from her correspondence. Scott&#x27;s editing shows considerable censorship and he declined to edit the bulk of her letters, which later appeared in six volumes from Archibald Constable as &quot;Letters of Anna Seward 1784–1807&quot; (1811). Her reputation barely outlived her, but interest revived in the 21st century, after some dismissive views among early 20th-century critics. Later feminist scholars in particular have seen Seward as a valuable observer of gendered relations in late 18th-century society, playing a transitional role in its principles and emerging romanticism. Her stance on the political, cultural and literary issues of the time likewise reflects the social responses to such issues. Kairoff sees her as &quot;one of the — in a literal sense — ultimate eighteenth-century poets&quot;.
There is a plaque to Anna Seward (spelt Ann) in Lichfield Cathedral by the entrance; Anne herself is buried underneath the choir stalls. The epitaph was written by her friend Walter Scott. Seward appears as a character in the novel &quot;The Ladies&quot; by Doris Grumbach (1984).

<text>Alexander Romanovich Luria (, ; 16 July 1902 – 14 August 1977) was a Soviet neuropsychologist, often credited as a father of modern neuropsychology. He developed an extensive and original battery of neuropsychological tests during his clinical work with brain-injured victims of World War II, which are still used in various forms. He made an in-depth analysis of the functioning of various brain regions and integrative processes of the brain in general. Luria&#x27;s magnum opus, &quot;Higher Cortical Functions in Man&quot; (1962), is a much-used psychological textbook which has been translated into many languages and which he supplemented with &quot;The Working Brain&quot; in 1973.

It is less known that Luria&#x27;s main interests, before the war, were in the field of cultural and developmental research in psychology. He became famous for his studies of low-educated populations of nomadic Uzbeks in the Uzbek SSR arguing that they demonstrate different (and lower) psychological performance than their contemporaries and compatriots under the economically more developed conditions of socialist collective farming (the &quot;kolkhoz&quot;). He was one of the founders of Cultural-Historical Psychology and a colleague of Lev Vygotsky. Apart from his work with Vygotsky, Luria is widely known for two extraordinary psychological case studies: &quot;The Mind of a Mnemonist&quot;, about Solomon Shereshevsky, who had highly advanced memory; and &quot;The Man with a Shattered World&quot;, about Lev Zasetsky, a man with a severe traumatic brain injury.

During his career Luria worked in a wide range of scientific fields at such institutions as the Academy of Communist Education (1920-1930s), Experimental Defectological Institute (1920-1930s, 1950-1960s, both in Moscow), Ukrainian Psychoneurological Academy (Kharkiv, early 1930s), All-Union Institute of Experimental Medicine, and the Burdenko Institute of Neurosurgery (late 1930s). A &quot;Review of General Psychology&quot; survey, published in 2002, ranked Luria as the 69th most cited psychologist of the 20th century.

== Life and career ==
===Early life and childhood===
Luria was born on 16 July 1902, to Jewish parents in Kazan, a regional centre east of Moscow. Many of his family were in medicine. According to Luria&#x27;s biographer Evgenia Homskaya, his father, Roman Albertovich Luria was a therapist who &quot;worked as a professor at the University of Kazan; and after the Russian Revolution, he became a founder and chief of the Kazan Institute of Advanced Medical Education.&quot; Two monographs of his father&#x27;s writings were published in Russian under the titles, &quot;Stomach and Gullet Illnesses&quot; (1935) and &quot;Inside Look at Illness and Gastrogenic Diseases&quot; (1935). His mother, Evgenia Viktorovna (née Khaskina), became a practicing dentist after finishing college in Poland. Luria was one of two children; his younger sister Lydia became a practicing psychiatrist.

===Early education and move to Moscow===
Luria finished school ahead of schedule and completed his first degree in 1921 at Kazan State University. While still a student in Kazan, he established the Kazan Psychoanalytic Society and briefly exchanged letters with Sigmund Freud. Late in 1923, he moved to Moscow, where he lived on Arbat Street. His parents later followed him and settled down nearby. In Moscow, Luria was offered a position at the Moscow State Institute of Experimental Psychology, run from November 1923 by Konstantin Kornilov.

In 1924, Luria met Lev Vygotsky, who would influence him greatly. The union of the two psychologists gave birth to what subsequently was termed the Vygotsky, or more precisely, the Vygotsky-Luria Circle. During the 1920s Luria also met a large number of scholars, including Aleksei Leontiev, Mark Lebedinsky, Alexander Zaporozhets, Bluma Zeigarnik, many of whom would remain his lifelong colleagues. Following Vygotsky and along with him, in mid-1920s Luria launched a project of developing a psychology of a radically new kind. This approach fused &quot;cultural&quot;, &quot;historical&quot;, and &quot;instrumental&quot; psychology and is most commonly referred to presently as cultural-historical psychology. It emphasizes the mediatory role of culture, particularly language, in the development of higher psychological functions in ontogeny and phylogeny.

Independently of Vygotsky, Luria developed the ingenious &quot;combined motor method,&quot; which helped diagnose individuals&#x27; hidden or subdued emotional and thought processes. This research was published in the US in 1932 as &quot;The Nature of Human Conflicts&quot; and made him internationally famous as one of the leading psychologists in Soviet Russia. In 1937, Luria submitted the manuscript in Russian and defended it as a doctoral dissertation at the University of Tbilisi (not published in Russian until 2002).

Luria wrote three books during the 1920s after moving to Moscow, &quot;The Nature of Human Conflicts&quot; (in Russian, but during Luria&#x27;s lifetime published only in English translation in 1932 in the US), &quot;Speech and Intellect in Child Development&quot;, and &quot;Speech and Intellect of Urban, Rural and Homeless Children&quot; (both in Russian). The second title came out in 1928, while the other two were published in the 1930s.

In early 1930s both Luria and Vygotsky started their medical studies in Kharkiv, then, after Vygotsky&#x27;s death in 1934, Luria completed his medical education at 1st Moscow Medical Institute.

===Multiculturalism and neurology===
The 1930s were significant to Luria because his studies of indigenous people opened the field of multiculturalism to his general interests. This interest would be revived in the later twentieth century by a variety of scholars and researchers who began studying and defending indigenous peoples throughout the world. Luria&#x27;s work continued in this field with expeditions to Central Asia. Under the supervision of Vygotsky, Luria investigated various psychological changes (including perception, problem solving, and memory) that take place as a result of cultural development of undereducated minorities. In this regard he has been credited with a major contribution to the study of orality.

In response to Lysenkoism&#x27;s purge of geneticists, Luria decided to pursue a physician degree, which he completed with honors in the summer of 1937. After rewriting and reorganizing his manuscript for &quot;The Nature of Human Conflicts&quot;, he defended it for a doctoral dissertation at the Institute of Tbilisi in 1937, and was appointed Doctor of Pedagogical Sciences. &quot;At the age of thirty-four, he was one of the youngest professors of psychology in the country.&quot; In 1933, Luria married Lana P. Lipchina, a well-known specialist in microbiology with a doctorate in the biological sciences. The couple lived in Moscow on Frunze Street, where their only daughter Lena (Elena) was born.

Luria also studied identical and fraternal twins in large residential schools to determine the interplay of various factors of cultural and genetic human development. In his early neuropsychological work in the end of the 1930s as well as throughout his postwar academic life he focused on the study of aphasia, focusing on the relation between language, thought, and cortical functions, particularly on the development of compensatory functions for aphasia.

===World War II and aftermath===
For Luria, the war with Germany that ended in 1945 resulted in a number of significant developments for the future of his career in neuropsychology. He was appointed Doctor of Medical Sciences in 1943 and Professor in 1944. Of specific importance for Luria was that he was assigned by the government to care for nearly 800 hospitalized patients with traumatic brain injury caused by the war. Luria&#x27;s treatment methods dealt with a wide range of emotional and intellectual dysfunctions. He kept meticulous notes on these patients, and discerned from them three possibilities for functional recovery: &quot;(1) disinhibition of a temporarily blocked function; (2) involvement of the vicarious potential of the opposite hemisphere; and (3) reorganization of the function system&quot;, which he described in a book titled &quot;Functional Recovery From Military Brain Wounds&quot;, (Moscow, 1948, Russian only.) A second book titled &quot;Traumatic Aphasia&quot; was written in 1947 in which &quot;Luria formulated an original conception of the neural organization of speech and its disorders (aphasias) that differed significantly from the existing western conceptions about aphasia.&quot; Soon after the end of the war, Luria was assigned a permanent position in General Psychology at the central Moscow State University in General Psychology, where he would predominantly stay for the remainder of his life; he was instrumental in the foundation of the Faculty of Psychology, and later headed the Departments of Patho- and Neuropsychology. By 1946, his father, the chief of the gastroenterological clinics at Botkin Hospital, had died of stomach cancer. His mother survived several more years, dying in 1950.

===1950s===
Following the war, Luria continued his work in Moscow&#x27;s Institute of Psychology. For a period of time he was removed from the Institute of Psychology, and in the 1950s he shifted to research on intellectually disabled children at the Defectological Institute. Here he did his most pioneering research in child psychology, and was able to permanently disassociate himself from the influence that was then still exerted in the Soviet Union by Pavlov&#x27;s early research. Luria said publicly that his own interests were limited to a specific examination of &quot;Pavlov&#x27;s second signal system&quot; and did not concern Pavlov&#x27;s simplified primary explanation of human behavior as based on a &quot;conditioned reflex by means of positive reinforcement&quot;. Luria&#x27;s continued interest in the regulative function of speech was further revisited in the mid-1950s and was summarized in his 1957 monograph titled &quot;The Role of Speech in the Regulation of Normal and Abnormal Behavior&quot;. In this book Luria summarized his principal concerns in this field through three succinct points summarized by Homskaya as: &quot;(1) the role of speech in the development of mental processes; (2) the development of the regulative function of speech; and (3) changes in the regulative functions of speech caused by various brain pathologies.&quot;

Luria&#x27;s main contributions to child psychology during the 1950s are well summarized by the research collected in a two-volume compendium of collected research published in Moscow in 1956 and 1958 under the title of &quot;Problems of Higher Nervous System Activity in Normal and Anomalous Children&quot;. Homskaya summarizes Luria&#x27;s approach as centering on: &quot;The application of the Method of Motor Associations (which) allowed investigators to reveal difficulties experienced by (unskilled) children in the process of forming conditioned links as well as restructuring and compensating by means of speech ... (Unskilled) children demonstrated acute dysfunction of the generalizing and regulating functions of speech.&quot; Taking this direction, already by the mid-1950s, &quot;Luria for the first time proposed his ideas about the differences of neurodynamic processes in different functional systems, primarily in verbal and motor systems.&quot; Luria identified the three stages of language development in children in terms of &quot;the formation of the mechanisms of voluntary actions: actions in the absence of a regulative verbal influence, actions with a nonspecific influence, and, finally, actions with a selective verbal influence.&quot; For Luria, &quot;The regulating function of speech thus appears as a main factor in the formation of voluntary behavior ... at first, the activating function is formed, and then the inhibitory, regulatory function.&quot;

===Cold War===
In the 1960s, at the height of the Cold War, Luria&#x27;s career expanded significantly with the publication of several new books. Of special note was the publication in 1962 of &quot;Higher Cortical Functions in Man and Their Impairment Caused by Local Brain Damage&quot;. The book has been translated into multiple foreign languages and has been recognized as the principal book establishing Neuropsychology as a medical discipline in its own right. Previously, at the end of the 1950s, Luria&#x27;s charismatic presence at international conferences had attracted almost worldwide attention to his research, which created a receptive medical audience for the book.

Luria&#x27;s other books written or co-authored during the 1960s included: &quot;Higher Brain and Mental Processes&quot; (1963), &quot;The Neuropsychological Analysis of Problem Solving&quot; (1966, with L. S. Tzvetkova; English translation in 1990), &quot;Psychophysiology of the Frontal Lobes&quot; (first published in 1973), and &quot;Memory Disorders in Patients with Aneurysms of the Anterior Communicating Artery&quot; (co-authored with A. N. Konovalov and A. N. Podgoynaya). In studying memory disorders, Luria oriented his research to the distinction of long-term memory, short-term memory, and semantic memory. It was important for Luria to differentiate neuropsychological pathologies of memory from neuropsychological pathologies of intellectual operations. These two types of pathology were often characterized by Luria as; &quot;(1) the inability to make particular arithmetical operations while the general control of intellectual activity remained normal (predominantly occipital disturbances)... (2) the disability of general control over intellectual processes (predominantly frontal lobe disturbances.&quot; Another of Luria&#x27;s important book-length studies from the 1960s which would only be published in 1975 (and in English in 1976) was his well-received book titled &quot;Basic Problems of Neurolinguistics&quot;.

===Late writings===
Luria&#x27;s productive rate of writing new books in neuropsychology remained largely undiminished during the 1970s and the last seven years of his life. Significantly, volume two of his &quot;Human Brain and Mental Processes&quot; appeared in 1970 under the title &quot;Neuropsychological Analysis of Conscious Activity&quot;, following the first volume from 1963 titled &quot;The Brain and Psychological Processes&quot;. The volume confirmed Luria&#x27;s long sustained interest in studying the pathology of frontal lobe damage as compromising the seat of higher-order voluntary and intentional planning. &quot;Psychopathology of the Frontal Lobes&quot;, co-edited with Karl Pribram, was published in 1973.

Luria published his well-known book &quot;The Working Brain&quot; in 1973 as a concise adjunct volume to his 1962 book &quot;Higher Cortical Functions in Man&quot;. In this volume, Luria summarized his three-part global theory of the working brain as being composed of three constantly co-active processes, which he described as:
# the attentional (sensory-processing) system
# the mnestic-programming system
# the energetic maintenance system, with two levels: cortical and limbic

This model was later used as a structure of the Functional Ensemble of Temperament model matching functionality of neurotransmitter systems. The two books together are considered by Homskaya as &quot;among Luria&#x27;s major works in neuropsychology, most fully reflecting all the aspects (theoretical, clinical, experimental) of this new discipline.&quot;

Among his late writings are also two extended case studies directed toward the popular press and a general readership, in which he presented some of the results of major advances in the field of clinical neuropsychology. These two books are among his most popular writings. According to Oliver Sacks, in these works &quot;science became poetry&quot;.
# In &quot;The Mind of a Mnemonist&quot; (1968), Luria studied Solomon Shereshevsky, a Russian journalist with a seemingly unlimited memory, sometimes referred to in contemporary literature as &quot;flashbulb&quot; memory, in part due to his fivefold synesthesia. 
#In &quot;The Man with the Shattered World&quot; (1971) he documented the recovery under his treatment of the soldier Lev Zasetsky, who had experienced a brain wound in World War II.

In 1974 and 1976, Luria presented successively his two-volume research study titled &quot;The Neuropsychology of Memory&quot;. The first volume was titled &quot;Memory Dysfunctions Caused by Local Brain Damage&quot; and the second &quot;Memory Dysfunctions Caused by Damage to Deep Cerebral Structures&quot;. Luria&#x27;s book written in the 1960s titled &quot;Basic Problems of Neurolinguistics&quot; was finally published in 1975, and was matched by his last book, &quot;Language and Cognition&quot;, published posthumously in 1980. Luria&#x27;s last co-edited book, with Homskaya, was titled &quot;Problems of Neuropsychology&quot; and appeared in 1977. In it, Luria was critical of simplistic models of behaviorism and indicated his preference for the position of &quot;Anokhin&#x27;s concept of &#x27;functional systems,&#x27; in which the reflex arc is substituted by the notion of a &#x27;reflex ring&#x27; with a feedback loop.&quot; In this approach, the classical physiology of reflexes was to be downplayed while the &quot;physiology of activity&quot; as described by Bernshtein was to be emphasized concerning the active character of human active functioning.

Luria&#x27;s death is recorded by Homskaya in the following words: &quot;On June 1, 1977, the All-Union Psychological Congress started its work in Moscow. As its organizer, Luria introduced the section on neuropsychology. The next day&#x27;s meeting, however, he was not able to attend. His wife Lana Pimenovna, who was extremely sick, had an operation on June 2. During the following two and a half months of his life, Luria did everything possible to save or at least to soothe his wife. Not being able to comply with this task, he died of a myocardial infarction on August 14. His funeral was attended by an endless number of people – psychologists, teachers, doctors, and just friends. His wife died six months later.&quot;

== Main areas of research ==
In her biography of Luria, Homskaya summarized the six main areas of Luria&#x27;s research over his lifetime in accordance with the following outline: (1) The Socio-historical Determination of the Human Psyche, (2) The Biological (Genetic) Determination of the Human Psyche, (3) Higher Psychological Functions Mediated by Signs-Symbols; The Verbal System as the Main System of Signs (along with Luria&#x27;s well-known three-part differentiation of it), (4) The Systematic Organization of Psychological Functions and Consciousness (along with Luria&#x27;s well-known four-part outline of this), (5) Cerebral Mechanisms of the Mind (Brain and Psyche); Links between Psychology and Physiology, and (6) The Relationship between Theory and Practice.

A &quot;Review of General Psychology&quot; survey, published in 2002, ranked Luria as the 69th most cited psychologist of the 20th century.

== Principal research trends ==
As examples of the vigorous growth of new research related to Luria&#x27;s original research during his own lifetime are the fields of linguistic aphasia, anterior lobe pathology, speech dysfunction, and child neuropsychology.

===Linguistic aphasia===
Luria&#x27;s neuropsychological theory of language and speech distinguished clearly between the phases that separate inner language within the individual consciousness and spoken language intended for communication between individuals intersubjectively. It was of special significance for Luria not only to distinguish the sequential phases required to get from inner language to serial speech, but also to emphasize the difference of encoding of subjective inner thought as it develops into intersubjective speech. This was in contrast to the decoding of spoken speech as it is communicated from other individuals and decoded into subjectively understood inner language. In the case of the encoding of inner language, Luria expressed these successive phases as moving first from inner language to semantic set representations, then to deep semantic structures, then to deep syntactic structures, then to serial surface speech. For the encoding of serial speech, the phases remained the same, though the decoding was oriented in the opposite direction of transitions between the distinct phases.

=== Frontal (anterior) lobes===
Luria&#x27;s studies of the frontal lobes were concentrated in five principal areas: (1) attention, (2) memory, (3) intellectual activity, (4)emotional reactions, and (5) voluntary movements. Luria&#x27;s main books for investigation of these functions of the frontal lobes are titled &quot;The Frontal Lobes&quot;, &quot;Problems of Neuropsychology&quot; (1977), &quot;Functions of the Frontal Lobes (1982, posthumously published), &quot;Higher Cortical Functions in Man.&quot; (1962) and &quot;Restoration of Function After Brain Injury&quot; 

Luria was first to identify the fundamental role of the frontal lobes in sustained attention, flexibility of behaviour, and self-organization. Based on his clinical observations and rehabilitation practice, he suggested that different areas of the frontal lobes differentially regulate these three aspects of behaviour. This suggestion was later supported by the neuroscience investigating frontal lobes. Practically all modern neuropsychological tests for frontal lobes damage have some components that were offered by Luria in his assessment and rehabilitation practice.

===Speech dysfunction===
Luria&#x27;s research on speech dysfunction was principally in the areas of (1) expressive speech, (2) impressive speech, (3) memory, (4) intellectual activity, and (5) personality.

===Child neuropsychology===
This field was formed largely based upon Luria&#x27;s books and writings on neuropsychology integrated during his experiences during the war years and later periods. In the area of child neuropsychology, &quot;The need for its creation was dictated by the fact that children with localized brain damage were found to reveal specific different features of dissolution of psychological functions. Under Luria&#x27;s supervision, his colleague Simernitskaya began to study nonverbal (visual-spatial) and verbal functions, and demonstrated that damage to the left and right hemispheres provoked different types of dysfunctions in children than in adults. This study initiated a number of systematic investigations concerning changes in the localization of higher psychological functions during the process of development.&quot; Luria&#x27;s general research was mostly centered on the treatment and rehabilitation &quot;of speech, and observations concerning direct and spontaneous rehabilitation were generalized.&quot; Other areas involving &quot;Luria&#x27;s works have made a significant contribution in the sphere of rehabilitation of expressive and impressive speech (Tzvetkova, 1972), 1985), memory (Krotkova, 1982), intellectual activity (Tzvetkova, 1975), and personality (Glozman, 1987) in patients with localized brain damage.&quot;

== Luria-Nebraska neuropsychological test ==
The Luria-Nebraska is a standardized test based on Luria&#x27;s theories regarding neuropsychological functioning. Luria was not part of the team that originally standardized this test; he was only indirectly referenced by other researchers as a scholar who had published relevant results in the field of neuropsychology. Anecdotally, when Luria first had the battery described to him he commented that he had expected that someone would eventually do something like this with his original research.
