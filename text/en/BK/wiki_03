<text>Carlos Alberto Arroyo Bermúdez (born July 30, 1979) is a Puerto Rican former professional basketball player. He played in the National Basketball Association with the Toronto Raptors, Denver Nuggets, Utah Jazz, Detroit Pistons, Orlando Magic, Miami Heat, and Boston Celtics.

In the 2008–09 season, he played for Maccabi Tel Aviv in the Israeli Basketball Premier League, winning the league&#x27;s championship, and being named the Final&#x27;s Most Valuable Player. In 2009 he also was the Israeli Premier League Assists Leader. He has also played professionally in Puerto Rico, Spain, and Turkey.

Arroyo was a member of the senior Puerto Rican national basketball team that defeated the United States at the 2004 Summer Olympic Games. He also represented Puerto Rico at the 2006 FIBA World Championship in Japan. In May 2019, Arroyo was picked by Trilogy to play in the Big3, a 3-on-3 basketball league founded by rapper Ice Cube. He played in that league for one season, and then turned his focus to music, releasing the international hit song, &quot;Baila Reggaeton&quot;.

== Early years and education ==

Carlos Arroyo was born and raised in Fajardo, Puerto Rico. He is an identical twin, born along his brother Alberto. Arroyo is a cousin of actor Benicio del Toro.

Arroyo graduated from Colegio Santiago Apostol in Fajardo. Arroyo attended Brookwood School in Thomasville, Georgia, for his junior year in high school, where he averaged nearly 30 points and 10 assists per game.

== College career ==
Arroyo studied in Florida International University (FIU) from 1998 to 2001, where he played for the campus&#x27; team, the Golden Panthers. He was a four-year letterman at the university having completed his B.A while playing with the team for four years and establishing several team records. Among these records are the all-time lead in assists, as well as the single-season assist record, having 459 in one season. Arroyo is also the only player in Florida International University to have scored more than six hundred points in a single season. He is also the second all-time leading scorer for FIU, having scored 1,600 points during his university career, with an average of 16.0 points per game and 4.6 assists per game over his 100 games. Arroyo was also selected as a member of the Sun Belt Conference&#x27;s All-Star team on two separate occasions. On January 5, 2007, Florida International University held a ceremony where Arroyo&#x27;s university number (30) was retired to recognize his play over his time there.

== Professional career ==

=== Early years ===
Arroyo began his professional career in the Baloncesto Superior Nacional of Puerto Rico when he was 17 years old. He debuted with the Cariduros de Fajardo in 1996. During his first season, he averaged 10.9 points per game while shooting 52%. The next year, he improved his numbers to 17 points and 5.5 assists per game. That season, he also shot 42% from the 3-point line.

The next year, he played for the Cangrejeros de Santurce, where he was a teammate of then starting center of the Puerto Rican national basketball team, José Ortiz. In 2000, Arroyo averaged 17.1 points and 3.9 assists per game. During his tenure with the team, the Cangrejeros won four consecutive national titles in 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2003, winning five league championships in six years.

=== First stint in the NBA (2001–2008) ===
After graduating from FIU, Arroyo was signed by the National Basketball Association&#x27;s Toronto Raptors for the 2001–02 NBA season, but was released in January 2002. He then played briefly in the Spanish ACB League with TAU Cerámica before being signed by the Denver Nuggets in March of the same year. He saw limited action with those two teams, playing seventeen games with the Raptors and twenty with the Nuggets before his initial NBA season was over. He only played an average of 9.7 minutes per game during those thirty-seven games in which he saw action.

==== Utah Jazz ====
Arroyo joined the Utah Jazz for the 2002-03 NBA season. He did not play much during his first year in Utah; he was the team&#x27;s third string point guard behind John Stockton and Mark Jackson. However, Arroyo watched and learned from Stockton and Jackson, and his time to play soon arrived.

Stockton retired shortly after the season ended, and Jackson joined the Houston Rockets during the offseason, leaving Arroyo as the starter for the 2003–04 season. With the retirement of Stockton and the subsequent departure of Karl Malone to the Los Angeles Lakers, it was expected that the Jazz would suffer through a miserable season and sink to the bottom of the league. However, to the surprise of many, the remaining Jazz players pulled together and kept the team competitive, even in the tough Midwest Division. With Arroyo leading the way, Utah finished with an impressive 42–40 record, narrowly missing a berth in the playoffs. Arroyo set career highs by averaging 12.6 points and 5.0 assists per game. He scored a career-high 30 points against the Minnesota Timberwolves on November 14, the 2nd highest single-game total ever for a Puerto Rican player in the NBA.

==== Detroit Pistons ====
During the 2004-05 NBA season with the Jazz, Arroyo had several disputes with head coach Jerry Sloan. He eventually found himself back on the bench. In January 2005, Arroyo was traded to the Detroit Pistons for veteran center Elden Campbell (who would quickly be waived and later be reclaimed by the Pistons) and a future first-round pick.

With the Pistons, Arroyo came within one game of becoming the third Puerto Rican to win an NBA championship after Butch Lee and JJ Barea In what was dubbed by some Hispanic newspapers as &quot;The Hispanic NBA Finals&quot; (because Arroyo played for the Pistons and Argentine Manu Ginóbili starred for the San Antonio Spurs), the Spurs won the series in seven games, with a final game score of 81–74. Arroyo&#x27;s playing time was reduced significantly due to Larry Brown&#x27;s tight defensive style.

Initially, with Pistons coach Flip Saunders&#x27; style of coaching, Arroyo received more minutes of playing time, and demonstrated value off the bench. He led the team in assists several times despite playing fewer minutes than other players. However, again, his minutes declined as the season progressed.

On January 11, 2006, Arroyo was suspended for one game after he made contact with an official during the Pistons&#x27; 96–86 victory over the New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets on January 10.

==== Orlando Magic ====
On February 15, 2006, Arroyo was dealt (along with Darko Miličić) from Detroit to the Orlando Magic, in exchange for Kelvin Cato and a future first-round draft choice.

The addition of Arroyo and Miličić, plus the return of point guard Jameer Nelson from the injured list, sparked a resurgence of the Magic in the last quarter of the 2005–2006 season, as they finished with a 12–3 run, nearly reaching the playoffs. During this run, the team had an eight-game winning streak, beating top teams such as the Dallas Mavericks, San Antonio Spurs, Miami Heat and the Detroit Pistons. During the stretch run, Arroyo averaged 22.1 MPG, 10.8 PPG, 2.8 APG, and 2.2 RPG off the bench, which earned him the back-up point guard position behind Nelson. These averages were significant improvements from the statistics he accumulated with the Pistons, when he averaged only 12 minutes per game. He scored a season-high 21 points against the Phoenix Suns on March 3, 2006. On April 9, 2006, Arroyo injured his left hamstring and was sidelined for four games, returning on April 17 and scoring 17 points in the last game of the season.

Arroyo started the 2006–07 season as the team&#x27;s backup point guard but was demoted by the team&#x27;s coach Brian Hill following an offensive slump, but regained his back-up position later in the season.

The Orlando Magic started the 2007–08 season with new coach Stan Van Gundy, and Arroyo was again assigned backup point-guard responsibilities. On November 28, 2007, he had a career-high 14 assists in a game against the Seattle SuperSonics. On December 29, 2007, Arroyo was promoted to the starting position after Nelson experienced an extended offensive slump. With Nelson in the starting lineup prior to this change, the team had been committing an average of seventeen turnovers per game, and Nelson had been unable to score in double digits on 10 out of 17 games. This led to Van Gundy making several references to the team&#x27;s performance and leading to Arroyo&#x27;s inclusion in the starting lineup. During Arroyo&#x27;s first three games in the starting position the number of turnovers produced by the team was lowered to eleven per game. Arroyo&#x27;s averaged double digits in these games as well as seventeen assists over that period. Arroyo closed January starting, the team finishing the month winning five out of six games. 

However, after playing 5 minutes on February 6, 2008, and being replaced by Nelson, Arroyo saw his playing time limited again. Arroyo did not play from February 11, when he played for less than 10 minutes and scored 7 points, until March 1. In an interview with Puerto Rican newspaper &quot;El Nuevo Día&quot;, coach Van Gundy said that he preferred Keyon Dooling at back-up point guard. Due to injuries to both Nelson and Dooling, Arroyo was re-inserted into the starting lineup that day and ended up with 13 points and 8 assists in 41 minutes. Following the conclusion of the 2007–2008 NBA season Arroyo became a free agent. When interviewed, Arroyo noted that he was interested in returning to Orlando, but that he was also open to hearing offers from the New York Knicks and Miami Heat.

=== Maccabi (2008–2009) ===
In the summer of 2008, Arroyo signed a three-year contract with the Israeli League powerhouse Maccabi Tel Aviv after having spent the previous 6 years in the NBA. The contract was worth $7.5 million net income, with his team paying all of his taxes and that included opt-out options after each of the first two seasons In the end of the 2008–09 season with Maccabi, he won the Israeli League, being named the Most Valuable Player of the league&#x27;s finals. In Israel, he averaged 15.3 points (51.6% 2FGP) in 31 mins per game.

=== Return to the NBA (2009–2011) ===

==== Miami Heat ====

On October 11, 2009, Arroyo signed a non-guaranteed, one-year contract with the Miami Heat. He had an established residence in Pinecrest, Florida, and had participated in a workout with the team before signing. His contract was guaranteed for the full year later in the season.

Upon starting the season, Arroyo shared point guard responsibilities with Mario Chalmers. On January 7, 2010, the Heat signed veteran free agent Rafer Alston, sending Arroyo to the bench. However, Alston was suspended after starting 25 games and in early March, Arroyo was moved back to the starting lineup. Over the last two months of the season, Arroyo averaged 9 points and 4.5 assists per game. He finished the season with a 4.27-to-1 assist-to-turnover ratio, second only to Chris Paul&#x27;s for the season. Arroyo averaged 6.8 points and 2.2 assists per game during the playoffs first round against the Boston Celtics where the Heat were eliminated in 5 games.

After the season ended, Arroyo became a free agent. However, on July 21, 2010, it was announced that he and the Heat had reached an agreement for the 2010–11 season. He began the season as the team&#x27;s starting point guard. LeBron James&#x27;s arrival meant a decrease in Arroyo&#x27;s ball-handling responsibilities and so coach Erik Spoelstra encouraged Arroyo to be more proactive with his shots. On December 6, 2010, Arroyo had a perfect game shooting from the field (6–6 FG, 2–2 FT, 2–2 3PT), finishing with 18 points, 2 rebounds, and only 1 turnover. His 18 points were the most he had scored in 2 years.

On January 22, 2011, coach Spoelstra replaced Arroyo as the Miami Heat starting point guard with Mario Chalmers. According to Spoelstra, &quot;It&#x27;s not an indictment on Carlos... It&#x27;s just something I think will be beneficial for the team right now.&quot; Although Arroyo and Chalmers shared similar statistics, the latter edged Arroyo in the significant +/- statistic. On March 1, 2011, the Heat released Arroyo in an effort to clear a roster spot for the expected addition of free-agent guard Mike Bibby. During the season, Arroyo started 42 games for the Heat, averaging 5.6 points and 2 assists per game. He also improved his 3-point shooting to a career-best 43.8%, leading the team in that statistic.

==== Boston Celtics ====

On March 6, 2011, Arroyo agreed to a contract with the Boston Celtics for the remainder of the season. The contract was for the veteran minimum of $1.2 million. After the news surfaced, Arroyo tweeted on his Twitter account &quot;Embracing this new opportunity in my life... Excited to meet my new teammates!!&quot;.

Arroyo debuted with the Celtics on March 9, 2011, in a home game against the Los Angeles Clippers. He contributed with 4 points (2–3 FG), 3 rebounds, 2 assists, and 1 steal in 15 minutes of play. After the game, coach Doc Rivers praised Arroyo&#x27;s performance, calling it &quot;phenomenal&quot;. Rivers was particularly impressed when Arroyo called a play from memory that he hadn&#x27;t yet run with the team in practice. Celtics veterans Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce also welcomed Arroyo&#x27;s contribution to the team. However, after the return of Delonte West from the injured list, Arroyo saw his playing time diminish.

During the first-round playoff series against the New York Knicks, Arroyo remained inactive as Rivers decided to keep Troy Murphy on the active roster because of his size. He was activated for their second-round series against his former team, the Miami Heat. Doc Rivers said &quot;He knows this team... So I thought he may be able to help us in some way.&quot; However, Arroyo didn&#x27;t play in the series and the Celtics were eliminated in five games.

Arroyo&#x27;s final NBA game was on April 13, 2011, in a 112–102 win over the New York Knicks where he recorded 6 points, 4 assists and 3 rebounds as the Celtics&#x27; starting point guard.

=== Return to Europe (2011–2015) ===

==== Beşiktaş Milangaz ====
On December 22, 2011, Arroyo signed a deal with the Turkish club Beşiktaş Milangaz until the end of the 2011–12 season. His first game with the team was on December 31, 2011, against Anadolu Efes S.K. Arroyo scored nine points, with 5 rebounds and three assists in 22 minutes of play, and his team ended up winning 83–76. With only four weeks in Turkey, Arroyo was invited to play in the league All-Star game to be held in January 2012. During the game, he contributed with 13 points, 2 rebounds, and 13 assists. He also scored a last second three-point basket, to lead his team to a 140–139 win.

When the season resumed, Arroyo led his team to win the Turkish Basketball Cup title. He ended up averaging 28.4 minutes, 14 points, and 4.5 assists per game, and a three-point field goal percentage of 47%. After that, he helped his team win the EuroChallenge, while averaging 10.7 points and 3.6 assists per game. In June 2012, Arroyo led his team to win the championship of the Turkish Super League by defeating the Anadolu Efes team in the Turkish League Finals. Arroyo finished the 6th and last game of the Turkish League Finals with 18 points, 5 rebounds, and 8 assists. He was named the Turkish Super League Finals MVP.

==== Galatasaray ====

In January 2013, Arroyo signed with Galatasaray Medical Park of the Turkish Basketball Super League (BSL). On February 25, Arroyo scored 15 points and 7 assists on a win against Olin Edirne. On March 16, 2013, he scored 19 points, 3 rebounds, and 6 assists on a win against Mersin BB. On March 26, 2013, Arroyo faced his former team, Beşiktaş, and led Galatasaray to a 76–72 victory. Arroyo was the lead scorer for his team with 17 points, 5 rebounds, and 3 assists.

On June 15, 2013, Arroyo and Galatasaray won the BSL championship after defeating Banvit B.K. 76–58 in the final series. Arroyo scored 15 points and had 8 assists in the game. This was Arroyo&#x27;s second championship in the BSL, after winning it in 2012 with Beşiktaş. Galatasaray had only lost one game since Arroyo joined the team in January. The next month, Arroyo re-signed with Galatasaray on a one-year deal with the option of a second. In June 2014, Arroyo guided the team to another BSL final, this time against Fenerbahçe Ülker. The series was taken to a seventh and decisive game. He was also selected as team captain for Galatasaray, replacing Ender Arslan.

On August 14, 2014, Galatasaray took up the option on Arroyo&#x27;s contract, re-signing him for the 2014–15 season. After averaging 15.7 points and 5.1 assists per game during the first half of the season, Arroyo was selected to participate in the All-Star Game of the Turkish Basketball Super League for the European Team. The game was held in January 2015, and Arroyo finished the game with 14 points, 11 rebounds, and 22 assists, leading his team to defeat Team Asia 138–130. At the end of the game, Arroyo was selected Most Valuable Player of the game.

On March 2, 2015, Arroyo parted ways with Galatasaray, due to the unpaid salaries.

== Musical career ==
Interested in reggaeton, Carlos Arroyo established his own studio and independent record label called &quot;Arroyo Hit Music&quot; and launched a mini-musical career in 2009. He has released two singles so far, &quot;Oculto Secreto&quot; in 2009 and &quot;Se Va Conmigo&quot; in 2010. The latter features fellow Puerto Rican artist Yomo. Later after releasing his hit single with Reggaeton singer Yomo, he decided to work on the remix which features the &quot;Queen of Reggaeton&quot; Ivy Queen. The original version with Yomo peaked at #45 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Digital Songs chart, #26 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Rhythm Airplay chart, and #13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Rhythm Digital Songs chart.

Carlos Arroyo also had his own theme music accompaniment at American Airlines Arena, namely El Gran Combo&#x27;s &quot;Fiesta de Pilito&quot;. Arroyo collaborated with Probably Pablo on the song &quot;Imaginarme&quot;.

In March 2020, Arroyo released the single &quot;Baila Reggaeton&quot;, featuring the popular duo Zion &amp; Lennox; the song became an international hit, and Arroyo quickly became &quot;one of the biggest reggaeton stars in the world&quot;.

== Personal life ==
After finishing his studies in Florida International University (FIU), Arroyo established his residence in Florida, since it is the closest location to Puerto Rico within the United States, where he works. It was there that he met his wife, Xiomara Escobar, with whom he has three children, Gabriella (b. 2005), Daniela (b. 2010), and Carlos Adrián (b. 2012). On November 2, 2007, Arroyo was forced to miss two games with the Orlando Magic when he had to make an emergency visit to Puerto Rico because his daughter was suffering from pneumonia. Arroyo&#x27;s grandmother was a cancer patient which motivated him to participate in activities directed towards children suffering from the condition. His eldest daughter Gabriella committed to the University of Dayton volleyball team in the NCAA Division I in 2022.

<doc id="375105" wikidata="Q1467097" url="?curid=375105" title="Governor of Queensland">
<text>The governor of Queensland is the representative of the monarch, currently King Charles III, in the state of Queensland. In an analogous way to the governor-general at the national level, the governor performs constitutional and ceremonial functions at the state level. In particular the governor has the power to appoint and dismiss the premier of Queensland and all other ministers in the Cabinet, and issue writs for the election of the state parliament.

The current governor of Queensland, former Chief Health Officer of Queensland Jeannette Young, was sworn in on 1 November 2021.

The chief justice of the Supreme Court of Queensland, currently Helen Bowskill, acts in the position of governor in the governor&#x27;s absence. In June 2014, Queen Elizabeth II, upon the recommendation of then-Premier Campbell Newman, accorded all current, future and living former governors the title &quot;The Honourable&quot; in perpetuity.

==Official residence==
The governor has resided at Government House, Brisbane since 1910. The mansion, set in of gardens and bushland in the Brisbane suburb of Paddington, is also known as &quot;Fernberg&quot;. Unlike Fernberg, the original Government House was purpose-built and was used from 1862 to 1910; the building still exists today on the grounds of Queensland University of Technology&#x27;s CBD campus.

==Constitutional provisions==

The office of the governor was initially established by letters patent issued by Queen Victoria on the founding of Queensland in 1867. However, up until 1977 the office was not formally recognised in Queensland legislation, with the powers of the governor set down in the letters patent and in an imperial order in council which preserved the effect of the &quot;Australian Constitutions Act 1842&quot; (Imp) (the document that granted NSW a semi-elected assembly) as regard to the governor and restricted the power of the Queensland assembly to remove the position. However, following the 1975 Dismissal crisis then premier Sir Joh Bjelke-Peterson amended the &quot;Constitution Act 1867&quot; (Qld) to replicate the provisions of the order in council. This was done as the order in council only applied due to the continuing authority of the British Parliament in regard to the states. It was feared that a future Commonwealth government would either assert or acquire by consent the exiting powers of the imperial parliament over the states, giving them the power to either abolish the office or make it subordinate to the governor-general, allowing the Commonwealth to order the state governor to refuse royal assent to state bills. This amendment provision was doubly entrenched, requiring a referendum for the provisions about the governor to be amended or removed. Following the passage of the &quot;Australia Act 1986&quot;, the power of the British Parliament to legislate for the states has been removed. However, there remains academic doubts of the legal effectiveness of the double entrenchment provisions.

The &quot;Constitution Act 2001&quot; consolidated the previous constitutional documents, including the most recent letters-patent, leaving the role of the governor fully defined by Australian law. However, the doubly entrenched provisions of the 1867 constitution remains in place as a referendum was not sought to amend them.

In accordance with the conventions of the Westminster system of parliamentary government, the governor nearly always acts solely on the advice of the head of the elected government, the Premier of Queensland. The governor may exercise reserve powers (powers able to be used in the absence of or contrary to advice) only in limited circumstances.

The Queensland Constitution expressly provides that the governor &quot;is not subject to direction by any person and is not limited as to the Governor&#x27;s sources of advice&quot; on the appointment or dismissal of ministers (s 35), another provision inserted by the Bjelke-Petersen government in the wake of the 1975 federal dismissal. This provision worked against Bjelke-Petersen when, in the dying days of his government in November 1987, he tried and failed to convince governor Sir Walter Campbell to remove several ministers to shore up his own support within Parliament. When the parliamentary wing of the National Party deposed Bjelke-Petersen and elected one of the dissident ministers, Mike Ahern, as the new leader of the National Party, Bjelke-Petersen initially refused to resign as premier and Sir Walter resisted calls to dismiss him. Bjelke-Petersen elected to resign on 1 December 1987.

The governor is head of the Executive Council, a Queensland equivalent to the Federal Executive Council. The Council is composed of ministers from the government of the day. The Chief Justice of Queensland and other judges in the Queensland judicial system are appointed by the governor acting on the advice of the Executive Council.

==Governor&#x27;s standard==

The governor&#x27;s standard comprises a Union Jack with a white roundel in the centre with the state badge of Queensland: a light blue Maltese cross, surmounted by a royal crown and surrounded by garland of laurel leaves.

The general design of standards for British governors was approved by Queen Victoria in 1869. The design for governors of Queensland was created and flown as a personal standard since 1876, when the Maltese cross was adopted as the colonial badge.

If the standard is flying at Government House, on a vehicle or at an event, this indicates that the governor is present.

==List of governors of Queensland==
The first Australian born Governor of Queensland was Lieutenant-General Sir John Lavarack (appointed 1946). His successor, Sir Henry Abel Smith, the husband of the niece of Queen Mary, Lady May Abel-Smith, was British. All subsequent governors have been Australian-born, except for Leneen Forde, who was born in Canada but who emigrated to Australia at an early age.

Prior to the Separation of Queensland in 1859, it was part of New South Wales under the governors of New South Wales.

There have been 26 past governors of Queensland, prior to the current governor:


==List of administrators and lieutenant-governors of Queensland==
Administrators and lieutenant-governors are deputy roles generally appointed to carry out the duties of the governor when the governor is unavailable, due to travel or illness. If one is not appointed, then the duties are carried out by the Chief Justice of Queensland (or the most senior judge available). The following are the administrators and lieutenant-governors of Queensland:

<text>César (born Cesare Baldaccini; 1 January 1921 – 6 December 1998), also occasionally referred to as César Baldaccini (), was a noted French sculptor.

César was at the forefront of the Nouveau Réalisme movement with his radical compressions (compacted automobiles, discarded metal, or rubbish), expansions (polyurethane foam sculptures), and fantastic representations of animals and insects. 

== Biography ==

He was a French sculptor, born in 1921 to Italian parents from Tuscany in the working-class neighbourhood of la Belle-de-Mai in Marseilles. His father was a cooper and bar owner. After studying at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, Marseilles (1935-9) he went on to the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris (1943-8). He began making sculptures by welding together pieces of scrap metal in 1952 and first made his reputation with solid welded sculptures of insects, various kinds of animals and nudes.

His first one-man exhibition was at the Galerie Lucien Durand, Paris, 1954.

His early work used soldered and welded metal as well as junk materials, and by 1960 César was considered one of France&#x27;s leading sculptors. In that year, on a visit to a scrap merchant in search of metal, he saw a hydraulic crushing machine in operation, and decided to experiment with it in his sculpture. He astonished his followers by showing three crushed cars at a Paris exhibition. It was for these &#x27;Compressions&#x27; that César became renowned. César selected particular cars for crushing, mixing elements from differently coloured vehicles. In this way he could control the surface pattern and colour scheme of the piece.

Later the same year he joined the Nouveaux Réalistes (New Realists) - Arman, Klein, Raysse, Tinguely, Pierre Restany and others who found their inspiration in urban life.

In 1965, he started to work with plastics, first with plastic moulds of human imprints, then from 1966 by pouring expanded polyurethane, which was allowed to expand and solidify. He gave up making welded-metal sculpture in 1966 and organised a series of Happenings from 1967 to 1970, in which he produced expansions in the presence of an audience. His later works also included sculptures made out of molten crystal.

In 1995, he was asked to paint a McLaren F1 GTR that participated in the famous 24 Hours of Le Mans. The car Chassis GTR5 is still in the livery created by César, and represents the only &#x27;Art Car&quot; based on the iconic Mclaren.

He is the creator of the César du cinéma trophy, which is awarded to the best in French cinema.

He was made &quot;Chevalier&quot; (Knight) of the Légion d&#x27;honneur on 22 January 1978 and promoted &quot;Officier&quot; (Officer) in 1993.

He married Rosine and had one daughter. 
He died in Paris in December 1998. Following his death there was an extended dispute over his will between his widow and daughter on the one hand and Stéphanie Busuttil, his companion at the time of his death, on the other.

==Works on public display==
Examples of César&#x27;s work can be seen in the permanent collection of le Centre national d&#x27;art et de culture Georges-Pompidou (&quot;Bas relief&quot;,&quot; Tortue&quot;, &quot;le Diable&quot;) and the Musée d&#x27;art moderne de la Ville de Paris (Facel Véga). He also designed his own grave at the Montparnasse Cemetery, on the esplanade de La Défense (&quot;Le Pouce&quot;), in Marseille on the avenue de Hambourg near the MAC and the Bonneveine Centre (&quot;Le Pouce Géant&quot;).

One of his most iconic pieces, &quot;Conserve expansion - Martial Raysse&quot; (1970-1972), is at the Museo Cantonale d&#x27;Arte in Lugano.

&quot;The Flying Frenchman&quot; was installed in Hong Kong in the early 1990s.

<text>United Defense Industries (UDI) was an American defense contractor which became part of BAE Systems Land &amp; Armaments after being acquired by BAE Systems in 2005. The company produced combat vehicles, artillery, naval guns, missile launchers and precision munitions.

==History==

The company started as a division of the agricultural machine business, Food Machinery Corporation (FMC), when they won a US Federal Government contract to build the Landing Vehicle Tracked (LVT) and became a weapon manufacturer during World War II. In 1964, FMC broadened their defense business by purchasing Northern Ordnance Company (formerly Northern Pump Company) in Fridley, Minnesota which specialized in Naval shipboard guns and missile launchers.

Bowen McLaughlin York (BMY), which became the BMY division of Harsco Corporation, was a separate business involving design and manufacture of various combat vehicles and other defense hardware. Following a massive decline in orders for tracked combat vehicles between 1983 and 1994, FMC and the Harsco Corporation agreed in January 1994 to combine their defense businesses to form United Defense. The new company owned the former FMC California-based Ground Systems Division, the former FMC Minnesota-based Armament Systems Division and Harsco&#x27;s Pennsylvania-based BMY Combat Systems Division. The new company restructured its operations to concentrate final assembly and testing of combat vehicles to Pennsylvania.

In September 2000, UDI purchased Bofors Weapon Systems AB of Sweden, subsequently renamed Bofors Defence.

In 1997 UDI was subject to a takeover bids by rival General Dynamics and The Carlyle Group. It chose the lowest bid from private equity firm The Carlyle Group, which floated the company in 2001 but retained a share of the company.

===BAE Systems acquisition===

On March 7, 2005 UK-based defence contractor BAE Systems announced it was to acquire UDI for US$3.974 billion (£2.1 billion). This followed expressions of interest from companies including Northrop Grumman.

BAE Systems&#x27; bid was referred to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to ensure there were no national security implications of the sale. The CFIUS granted approval of the deal in April 2005. BAE completed its acquisition of United Defense on June 24, 2005 and announced plans to merge the company with its existing land systems businesses to form BAE Systems Land and Armaments.

==Products==
United Defense products included:

<text>Othala (), also known as ēðel and odal, is a rune that represents the &quot;o&quot; and &quot;œ&quot; phonemes in the Elder Futhark and the Anglo-Saxon Futhorc writing systems respectively. Its name is derived from the reconstructed Proto-Germanic *&quot;ōþala-&quot; &quot;heritage; inheritance, inherited estate&quot;. As it does not occur in Younger Futhark, it disappears from the Scandinavian record around the 8th century, but its usage continued in England into the 11th century, where it was sometimes further used in manuscripts as a shorthand for the word (&quot;homeland&quot;), similarly to how other runes were sometimes used at the time.

As with other symbols used historically in Europe such as the swastika and Celtic cross, othala has been appropriated by far-right groups such as the Nazi party and neo-Nazis, who have used it to represent ideas like Aryan heritage, a usage that is wholly modern and not attested in any ancient or medieval source. The rune also continues to be used in non-racist contexts, both in Heathenry and in wider popular culture such as the works of J.R.R. Tolkien and video games.

==Name and etymology==
The sole attested name of the rune is , meaning &quot;homeland&quot;. Based on this, and cognates in other Germanic languages such as and , the can be reconstructed, meaning &quot;ancestral land&quot;, &quot;the land owned by one&#x27;s kin&quot;, and by extension &quot;property&quot; or &quot;inheritance&quot;. is in turn derived from , meaning &quot;nobility&quot; and &quot;disposition&quot;.

Terms derived from are formative elements in some Germanic names, notably &quot;Ulrich&quot;.

The term &quot;odal&quot; () refers to Scandinavian laws of inheritance which established land rights for families that had owned that parcel of land over a number of generations, restricting its sale to others. Among other aspects, this protected the inheritance rights of daughters against males from outside the immediate family. Some of these laws remain in effect today in Norway as the &quot;Odelsrett&quot; (allodial right). The tradition of Udal law found in Shetland, Orkney, and the Isle of Man, is from the same origin.

==Elder Futhark &quot;o&quot;-rune==

The &quot;o&quot;-rune is attested early, in inscriptions from the 3rd century, such as the Thorsberg chape (DR7) and the Vimose planer (&quot;Vimose-Høvelen&quot;, DR 206).
 The corresponding Gothic letter is (derived from Greek Ω), which had the name &quot;oþal&quot;. The othala rune is found in some transitional inscriptions of the 6th or 7th century, such as the Gummarp, Björketorp and Stentoften runestones, but it disappears from the Scandinavian record by the 8th century. The Old Norse &quot;o&quot; phoneme at this time becomes written in Younger Futhark in the same way as the &quot;u&quot; phoneme, with the Ur rune.

It has been suggested that the othala rune on the Ring of Pietroassa is used to represent the word &quot;*oþal&quot;, referencing the ring as hereditary treasure. Similarly, Wolfgang Krause speculated that the &quot;o&quot; rune is used as an ideograph denoting possession in the Thorsberg chape inscription, reading the inscription &quot;owlþuþewaz&quot; as &quot;O[þila] - W[u]lþu-þewaz&quot; &quot;inherited property - the servant of Wulþuz&quot;.

==Anglo-Saxon &quot;œ&quot;-rune==
===Usage and shape===
The Anglo-Saxon runes preserve the full set of 24 Elder Futhark runes (as well as introducing innovations), but in some cases these runes are given new sound values due to Anglo-Frisian sound changes. The othala rune is such a case: the &quot;o&quot; sound in the Anglo-Saxon system is now expressed by &quot;ōs&quot; ᚩ, a derivation of the old Ansuz rune; the othala rune is known in Old English as &quot;ēðel&quot; (with umlaut due to the form &quot;ōþila-&quot;) and is used to express an &quot;œ&quot; sound, but is attested only rarely in epigraphy (outside of simply appearing in a futhark row). In some runic inscriptions, such as on the Seax of Beagnoth, and more commonly in manuscripts, othala is written with a single vertical line instead of the two diagonal legs, perhaps due to its simpler form.

The rune is also used as a shorthand for the word or (&quot;ancestral property or land&quot;) in texts such as &quot;Beowulf&quot;, &quot;Waldere&quot; and the Old English translation of Orosius&#x27; &quot;Historiae adversus paganos&quot;. This is similar to wider practices of the time, in which runes such as , and were also used as shorthands to write the name of the rune.

===Notable attestations===
Epigraphical attestations include:
*the Frisian Westeremden yew-stick, possibly as part of a given name &quot;Ƿimod&quot; (&quot;Ƿimœd&quot;)
*the Harford (Norfolk) brooch, dated c. 650, in a finite verb form: &quot;luda:gibœtæsigilæ&quot; &quot;Luda repaired the brooch&quot;
*the left panel of the Franks Casket, twice: &quot; tƿœgen gibroþær afœddæ hiæ ƿylif&quot; &quot;two brothers (scil. Romulus and Remus), a she-wolf nourished them&quot;.

===Rune poem===
The Anglo-Saxon rune poem preserves the meaning &quot;an inherited estate&quot; for the rune name:
==Modern use==
===Far-right iconography===

====Deliberate use as a far-right symbol====

The symbol derived from othala with &quot;wings&quot; or &quot;feet&quot; (serifs) was the badge of the SS Race and Settlement Main Office, which was responsible for maintaining the racial purity of the Nazi Schutzstaffel (SS). It was also the emblem of &quot;ethnic Germans&quot; (&quot;&quot;) of the 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen operating during World War II in the Nazi Germany-sponsored Independent State of Croatia.

The rune and winged symbol have been used by the Neo-Nazi in Germany, and in South Africa by the Anglo-Afrikaner Bond, the , the , the Italian neo-fascist group National Vanguard, the Afrikaner Student Federation and the far-right wing White Liberation Movement before it was disbanded. In November 2016, the leadership of the National Socialist Movement announced their intention to replace the Nazi-pattern swastika with the othala rune on their uniforms and party regalia in an attempt to enter mainstream politics. The rune was further used, along with other traditional symbols from European cultures such as a Tiwaz rune and a Celtic cross, and slogans associated with Nazism and far-right extremism by the Christchurch mosque shooter Brenton Harrison Tarrant. Heathen Front was a Neo-Nazi group, active during the 1990s to 2005 that espoused a racist form of Heathenry and described its ideas as &quot;odalism&quot; in reference to the alternative name for othala.

White supremacists who use the rune often claim it symbolises the heritage or land of &quot;white&quot; or &quot;Aryan&quot; people which should be free from foreigners. It has been noted however that this usage is a new invention by the groups and is not attested in any source from before the modern period, being labelled by runologist Michael Barnes as &quot;spring[ing] entirely from the imagination&quot;.

====Alleged use as a far-right symbol====
In some cases, individuals and organisations have been accused of using the rune as a far-right symbol, such as in April 2014 when the British Topman clothing company apologised after using it in one of their clothing lines. Furthermore, at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) held in Orlando, Florida, on February 25–28, 2021, the floor layout of the main stage resembled the winged form of the othala rune, leading to speculation on social media as to why that design was chosen. CPAC chairman Matt Schlapp said comparisons were &quot;outrageous and slanderous&quot;. Design firm Design Foundry later took responsibility for the design of the stage, saying that it &quot;intended to provide the best use of space, given the constraints of the ballroom and social distancing requirements.&quot; Ian Walters, director of communications for the ACU and CPAC, said they would stop using Design Foundry.

The neo-folk group Death in June used othala on the cover of their 7&quot; &quot;Come Before Christ And Murder Love&quot; alongside their &quot;Totenkopf 6&quot; logo. The group does not openly support far-right ideologies however scholars have noted the group&#x27;s fascination with Nazism and extensive usage of Nazi, and more widely fascist, imagery.

===Heathenry===

Othala, along with other runes more widely, often feature prominently in the practices of Heathens, and are commonly used to decorate items and in tattoos. The use of runes such as othala by far-right groups has been strongly condemned by some Heathen groups, including Asatru UK which released a public statement that &quot;[it] is categorically opposed to fascist movements, or any movements, using the symbols of our faith for hate&quot;.

===Popular culture===
The Anti-Defamation League notes that because it is part of the runic alphabet, the othala rune is used widely in a non-racist manner and should be interpreted in conjunction with its context.

As with other historical runes, othala is used by J.R.R. Tolkien in The Hobbit as seen on Thror&#x27;s map of Erebor, and as a base for the dwarvish Cirth writing systems used in The Lord of the Rings and described in Tolkien&#x27;s Legendarium. Othala is also used as the symbol for the &quot;Lore&quot; resource in Northgard, released in 2018.

The name of the rune is also used in Stargate SG-1, in which Othala is a world in the Ida Galaxy where the Asgard had lived.

<text>Tsim Sha Tsui (), often abbreviated as TST, is an area in southern Kowloon, Hong Kong. The area is administratively part of the Yau Tsim Mong District. Tsim Sha Tsui East is a piece of land reclaimed from the Hung Hom Bay now east of Tsim Sha Tsui. The area is bounded north by Austin Road and in the east by Hong Chong Road and Cheong Wan Road.

Geographically, Tsim Sha Tsui is a cape on the tip of the Kowloon Peninsula pointing towards Victoria Harbour, opposite Central. Several villages had been established in this location before Kowloon was ceded to the British Empire in 1860. The name &quot;Tsim Sha Tsui&quot; in Cantonese means &quot;sharp sandspit&quot;. It was also known as Heung Po Tau (), i.e. a port for exporting incense tree.

Tsim Sha Tsui is a major tourist hub in Hong Kong, with many high-end shops, bars, pubs and restaurants that cater to tourists. Many of Hong Kong&#x27;s museums are located in the area.

==Etymology==
The name Tsim Sha Tsui () means &#x27;sharp sandspit&#x27; in Cantonese.

==Geography==
Before any land reclamation, Tsim Sha Tsui consisted of two parallel capes with a bay in between in the south. The west cape, Kowloon Point, the proper Tsim Sha Tsui, coincided with the small hill where the Former Marine Police Headquarters is sited, while the east cape was the hill that is today known as Blackhead Point. The bay between the capes extended as far north as the present-day Mody Road. Today, Canton Road marks the western edge of Tsim Sha Tsui, and Chatham Road the eastern edge. The area is hilly, although many hills were levelled for reclamation.

==History==
Historical maps in Ming or Qing dynasty named the channel between Tsim Sha Tsui and Central as Chung Mun (Pinyin: Zhong Men, 中門, lit. the middle gate) as it is located in the middle of the two other channels, Kap Shui Mun in the west and Lei Yue Mun in the east, in the harbour.

Before Kowloon was ceded to Britain in 1860, many villages were present in the area. Incense trees (&quot;Aquilaria sinensis&quot;) from the New Territories were gathered at some quays in Tsim Sha Tsui and transferred to Shek Pai Wan in southern Hong Kong Island to be exported to the rest of the world. It was thus known as Heung Po Tau, the fragrant quay. Shortly after the land was ceded to Britain, construction began on the first section of Tsim Sha Tsui&#x27;s major thoroughfare, Nathan Road.

In 1888, the Star Ferry offered regular transport between Central and Tsim Sha Tsui, and the area has flourished ever since. Until the 20th century, Tsim Sha Tsui was a leafy suburb that contained numerous facilities of the British garrison in Hong Kong. Whitfield Barracks, converted into Kowloon Park in 1970, ran to the west of Nathan Road, and Kowloon Naval Yard occupied the waterfront to the west of the army encampment. In the early 20th century, Chinese people were allowed to live in the area to attract more people to trade in the colony. Garden houses were replaced with crowded residential blocks. Wharves and godowns were built along the west shore. Major developers like Hormusjee Naorojee Mody and Catchick Paul Chater actively participated in the development of Tsim Sha Tsui.

The Kowloon–Canton Railway (British Section) commenced service on 1 October 1910. Kowloon station in Tsim Sha Tsui was approved to be constructed on reclaimed land in 1912. It was built on the new southern reclamation from 1913 to 1915. The rails extended along the western reclamation parallel to Chatham Road, with old Hung Hom station near the Gun Club Hill Barracks at the junction of Chatham Road and Austin Road. Another major road, Salisbury Road, was completed in approximately the same period. The landmark Peninsula Hotel was built on the reclamation in 1928, opposite to the station.

The Kowloon station was relocated to a new Hung Hom station in 1978. The whole station and rails were demolished except the landmark Clock Tower. Hong Kong Space Museum and later the Hong Kong Cultural Centre were erected on the site. The rails were replaced with New World Centre and other gardens in Tsim Sha Tsui East.

In 2016 the Tsim Sha Tsui Waterfront Revitalisation Plan was shelved due to public controversy.

==Industry==

Tsim Sha Tsui remains tertiary sector from colonial days to present. In early colonial days, transport, tourism and trading are main business of the area. As port and rail facilities moved out of the area, the major industry falls on the later two. Tsim Sha Tsui, like Central, contains several centres of finance. After Kai Tak Airport closed, the height restrictions on buildings has dropped and now larger taller skyscrapers, parallel to those of Central, have been constructed.

== Culture ==

Some depictions of the cartoon cat Din Dong appear throughout the city. A statue in the Avenue of Comic Stars was built in Kowloon Park.

==Recreation and tourist attractions==
===Hotels===

Tourist hospitality is a major industry in Tsim Sha Tsui. The area has the highest concentration of hotels in Hong Kong. Some of the hotels include The Peninsula, Rosewood Hong Kong, Kowloon Shangri-La, The Regent Hong Kong, The Mira Hong Kong, Baden-Powell International House, Hotel Icon, and the Hotel Panorama. The Hyatt Regency Hong Kong was closed on 1 January 2006 and the iSQUARE shopping mall was built at its former location; it re-opened in October 2009 on Hanoi Road of Tsim Sha Tsui within the new The Masterpiece skyscraper. Other hotels in virtually every price range and level of luxury can be found throughout the area; Chungking Mansions is known for providing cheap lodging for backpackers.

===Restaurants===

Tsim Sha Tsui is one of many places to find exotic restaurants in Hong Kong. Hillwood Road at the north of Observatory Hill concentrates on restaurants of different national dishes. Knutsford Terrace on the other side of the hill is a terrace of pubs. Kimberley Street is famous for the Korean cuisine restaurants and grocery stores, especially after the advent of Korean Wave () in Hong Kong, giving the street the nickname of Koreatown (). From there, a string of Korean restaurants are located on Austin Avenue which circles Observatory Hill. Located on Nathan Road, the Chungking Mansions is a major tourist attraction in Tsim Sha Tsui. Georgetown Parade is well known for its dog nose biscuits. These recognisable buildings were featured in the film &quot;Chungking Express&quot;, and are full of inexpensive guest houses, Indian restaurants, and money changers.

Hong Kong Museum of History and Hong Kong Science Museum are situated in Tsim Sha Tsui East. The Hong Kong Heritage Discovery Centre and the Health Education Exhibition and Resource Centre, located within Kowloon Park, are housed in preserved and restored blocks of the former Whitfield Camp.

===Tourist attractions===

Tsim Sha Tsui was once the terminus of the Kowloon–Canton Railway (KCR). After the British Section of the railway was opened for traffic on 1 October 1910, the construction of the railway station in Tsim Sha Tsui started in 1913. Construction on the railway station and its clock tower were completed in 1915. The main building of the Tsim Sha Tsui station was demolished in 1978. The station was relocated to Hung Hom to make way for the Hong Kong Space Museum and the Hong Kong Cultural Centre. But the Clock Tower of the station was not demolished and was kept in place. It is all that remains standing of the station. The clock tower is forty-four metres high, surmounted by a lightning rod. It is now surrounded by the public piazza of the Cultural Centre and has become a landmark of Hong Kong. Six pillars of the railway were relocated to the Urban Council Centenary Garden in TST East. The Avenue of Stars starts at the &quot;New World Centre&quot; shopping centre near the Cultural Centre. There is also the attraction of shopping at a clothing store frequented by famous people from all over the world, at Sam&#x27;s Tailor.

The Tsim Sha Tsui waterfront is another popular destination for locals and tourists alike. It is especially popular for photographers, as it offers an unobstructed view of the Central area of Hong Kong across Victoria Harbour. The Star Ferry terminal is another popular attraction for tourists, and the Avenue of Stars is also popular with photographers.

==East Tsim Sha Tsui==
East Tsim Sha Tsui or Tsim Sha Tsui East (尖沙咀東 or simply 尖東) is an area east of Chatham Road South reclaimed from Hung Hom Bay in the 1970s. The Tsim Sha Tsui East Promenade links the area with the Hong Kong Cultural Centre near the Clock Tower. In 2004, the East Rail line returned to Tsim Sha Tsui with the extension of the line from Hung Hom to the new East Tsim Sha Tsui station, which serves as an interchange station with Tsim Sha Tsui station on the Tsuen Wan line. Unlike other East Rail line stations, it was built underground near Blackhead Point. An extensive tunnel system was constructed for pedestrians to access the most popular destinations in Tsim Sha Tsui, and to change trains between the two lines.

East Tsim Sha Tsui is the last district in Hong Kong to use a grid plan system before the Hong Kong government adopted its high land price policy, meaning that development in East Tsim Sha Tsui is less centralised than in newer districts. It is characterised by a large number of mid-rise buildings including hotels, offices and shopping centres. Pedestrian plazas are located in between the buildings.

In 2005, there were 15 office buildings and 5 hotels in Tsim Sha Tsui East:
* Office buildings: New Mandarin Plaza, Chinachem Golden Plaza, South Seas Center, Harbor Crystal Center, East Ocean Center, Energy Plaza, Hilton Towers, Inter-Continental Plaza, Auto Plaza, Mirror Tower, Houston Center, Wing On Plaza, Tsim Sha Tsui Centre and Empire Center.
* Hotels: The Royal Garden Hotel, Regal Kowloon Hotel, Kowloon Shangri-La, Grand Stanford Harbor View Hotel and Hotel Nikko Hong Kong.

==Public transport==
===Trains===
Tsim Sha Tsui is served by the MTR Tsim Sha Tsui station, on the Tsuen Wan line. Another station, East Tsim Sha Tsui station, opened in late 2004 as a southern extension of the East Rail line from Hung Hom station. On 16 August 2009, the Kowloon Southern Link of the West Rail line, from Nam Cheong station to East Tsim Sha Tsui station was opened. Simultaneously, the segment between East Tsim Sha Tsui station and Hung Hom station was transferred from the East Rail line to the West Rail line, so Hung Hom station is now the interchange station between the East Rail line and the West Rail line. East Tsim Sha Tsui station is connected to Tsim Sha Tsui Station and a number of locations in the area though an extensive pedestrian subway network. On 27 June 2021, the Tuen Ma line replaced the West Rail line.

===Ferries===
The Star Ferry connects Tsim Sha Tsui to Central and Wan Chai. Various hydrofoil services out of the Hong Kong China Ferry Terminal on Canton Road link Tsim Sha Tsui to Macau, Guangzhou, and several other places in the Pearl River Delta. They depart from China Hong Kong City, located near Harbour City.

===Buses===
Since Tsim Sha Tsui is in the heart of Kowloon Peninsula, the area is served by an extensive network of bus routes to many parts of Hong Kong. There are major bus terminals beside the Star Ferry terminal and atop East Tsim Sha Tsui underground station on Chatham Road.

==Education==
Tsim Sha Tsui is in Primary One Admission (POA) School Net 31. Within the school net are multiple aided schools (operated independently but funded with government money) and Jordan Road Government Primary School.

<doc id="375120" wikidata="Q947452" url="?curid=375120" title="ValuJet Flight 592">
<text>ValuJet Airlines Flight 592 was a regularly scheduled flight from Miami to Atlanta in the United States. On May 11, 1996, the ValuJet Airlines McDonnell Douglas DC-9 operating the route crashed into the Florida Everglades about ten minutes after departing Miami as a result of a fire in the cargo compartment caused by mislabeled and improperly stored hazardous cargo (oxygen generators). All 110 people on board were killed.

ValuJet, a low-cost carrier, already had a poor safety record before the crash and the incident brought widespread attention to the airline&#x27;s problems. Its fleet was grounded for several months after the crash. When operations resumed, the airline was unable to attract as many customers as it had before the deadly crash. The airline acquired AirTran Airways in 1997 but the lingering damage to the ValuJet brand led its executives to assume the AirTran name. It is the deadliest plane crash in Florida history .

==Background==
ValuJet Airlines was founded in 1992 and was known for its aggressive cost-cutting measures. Many of the airline&#x27;s planes were purchased in used condition from other airlines, little training was provided to workers and contractors were hired for maintenance and other services. ValuJet quickly developed a reputation for a lackluster safety record. In 1995, the United States military refused the airline&#x27;s bid to fly its personnel due to safety concerns, and some officials at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) wanted the airline grounded.

In 1986, an American Trans Air McDonnell Douglas DC-10 being serviced at Chicago&#x27;s O&#x27;Hare International Airport was destroyed on the ground by a fire caused by chemical oxygen generators. On February 3, 1988, aboard American Airlines Flight 132, a fire began in the cargo hold of the McDonnell Douglas MD-83 while the plane was in flight, caused by hazardous materials (primarily hydrogen peroxide); in that case the crew landed the aircraft safely. After Flight 132, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) recommended to the FAA that all class D cargo holds be fitted with smoke detectors and fire-suppression systems.

==Aircraft and crew==
The aircraft, a DC-9-32 registered N904VJ, was the 496th DC-9 assembled at the Long Beach plant. It was 27 years old and had been previously flown by Delta Air Lines. Its first flight occurred on April 18, 1969, and it was delivered to Delta on May 27, 1969 as N1281L. The airframe flew for Delta until the end of 1992, when it was retired and sold back to McDonnell Douglas. McDonnell Douglas then sold the plane to ValuJet in 1993. The aircraft was powered by two Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D-9A turbofan engines.

The aircraft had suffered a series of incidents in the two years before the crash, including two aborted takeoffs and eight emergency landings. Engine and pressurization errors were the primary issues in several of the incidents. In May 1995, the FAA issued a rewiring directive for all DC-9 cockpits because the wire bundles in the switch panel could cause &quot;fire and uncontrolled smoke throughout the cockpit as a result of chafing and shorting.&quot;

In the flight deck were two experienced pilots, Captain Candi Kubeck (35) and First Officer Richard Hazen (52). Kubeck had accumulated 8,928 total flight hours throughout her career (including 2,116 hours on the DC-9) and Hazen had more than 11,800 total flight hours throughout his career, with 2,148 on the DC-9.

==Incident==
On the afternoon of May 11, 1996, Flight 592 left Gate G2 in Miami after a delay of one hour and four minutes because of electrical problems. There were 110 people on board: 105 passengers, mainly from Florida and Georgia and a crew of two pilots and three flight attendants. At 2:04 p.m. EDT, the DC-9 departed from Runway 9L (now Runway 8R) and began a normal climb.

At 2:10 p.m., the passengers began to smell smoke. At the same time, the pilots heard a loud bang in their headsets and noticed that the plane was losing electrical power. The sag in electrical power and the banging sound were eventually determined to be the result of an explosion of a tire in the cargo hold. Seconds later, a flight attendant entered the cockpit and informed the flight crew of a fire in the passenger cabin. Passengers&#x27; shouts of &quot;fire, fire, fire&quot; were recorded on the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) when the cockpit door was opened. Although ValuJet&#x27;s flight-attendant training manual stated that the cockpit door should not be opened when smoke or other harmful gases might be present in the cabin, the intercom was not functional and there was no other way to alert the pilots. The flight data recorder (FDR) indicated a progressive failure of the DC-9&#x27;s electrical and flight control systems resulting from the spreading fire.

Kubeck and Hazen immediately asked air traffic control to return to Miami and were given instructions for a return to the airport. One minute later, Hazen requested the nearest available airport. Kubeck began to turn the plane left in preparation for the return to Miami.

Flight 592 disappeared from radar when it crashed at 2:13:42 p.m., about ten minutes after takeoff.

Eyewitnesses watched as the plane banked sharply, rolled onto its side and nosedived into the Francis S. Taylor Wildlife Management Area in the Everglades, a few miles west of Miami, at a speed in excess of . According to the NTSB&#x27;s report, two witnesses fishing nearby testified that &quot;they saw a low-flying airplane in a steep right bank. According to these witnesses, as the right bank angle increased, the nose of the airplane dropped and continued downward. The airplane struck the ground in a nearly vertical attitude.&quot; They reported seeing no external damage nor any sign of fire or smoke other than the engine exhaust. A group of sightseers in a small private plane also witnessed the crash and provided a nearly identical account, stating that Flight 592 seemed to &quot;disappear&quot; after hitting the swamp and that they could see nothing but scattered small debris, part of an engine and a large pool of jet fuel near the crash site.

Kubeck had lost control of the plane less than 10 seconds before impact. Examination of debris suggested that the fire had burned through the floorboards in the cabin, resulting in structural failure and damage to cables underneath the instrument panels. The NTSB report on the accident stated that &quot;the Safety Board cannot rule out the possibility that the flightcrew was incapacitated by smoke or heat in the cockpit during the last 7 seconds of the flight.&quot; Interruptions in the cockpit voice recorder occurred on two occasions, one of which was one minute and 12 seconds in length. The aircraft hit the water at 2:13:42 p.m. EDT, about 10 minutes after takeoff. The impact site was on the eastern edge of Florida Water Conservation Area 3B, between two levees, in an area known as the L-67 Pocket.

All on board were killed in the crash. Recovery of the aircraft and victims was severely complicated by the location of the crash. The nearest road of any kind was more than a quarter of a mile (400 m) away from the crash scene, and the location of the crash itself was a deep-water swamp with a floor of solid limestone. The aircraft was destroyed on impact, with no large pieces of the fuselage remaining. Sawgrass, alligators and risk of bacterial infection from cuts plagued searchers involved in the recovery effort.

==Victims==
Notable passengers killed on the flight included:
* San Diego Chargers running back Rodney Culver
* Songwriter and musician Walter Hyatt
* DelMarie Walker, 38, the prime suspect in a murder in Georgia

Recovery of the passengers and crew took several weeks, and very few intact human remains were found given the sheer violence of the impact, immersion in swamp water and scavenging by wildlife. About 68 of the 110 victims were identified, in some cases from examining jawbones, and at least one individual from a single tooth. A piece of torn flesh was proven to belong to Hazen, but Kubeck&#x27;s remains were never found. Because of the adverse conditions, performing toxicology tests on the human remains to determine their exposure to fumes and smoke from the in-flight fire was not possible.

==Investigation==
At the end of a 15-month investigation, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined that the fire had developed in a cargo compartment below the passenger cabin. The cargo compartment was of a Class D design, in which fire suppression is accomplished by sealing the hold from outside air. Any fire in such an airtight compartment would quickly exhaust all available oxidizers and then extinguish itself. As the fire suppression can be accomplished without any intervention by the crew, such holds are not equipped with smoke detectors.

The NTSB determined that just before takeoff, 144 expired chemical oxygen generators, each slightly larger than the size of a tennis-ball can, had been placed in the cargo compartment in five boxes marked COMAT (company material) by ValuJet&#x27;s maintenance contractor SabreTech. This violated Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations forbidding the transport of hazardous materials in passenger-aircraft cargo holds. Failure to cover the generators&#x27; firing pins with the prescribed plastic caps made accidental activation much more likely. The investigation revealed that rather than covering the pins, maintenance personnel simply cut the cords attached to the pins or applied duct tape around the cans, and consumer-grade adhesive tape was also used to secure the ends. SabreTech employees indicated on the cargo manifest that the &quot;oxy canisters&quot;, which were loosely packed in boxes that were each sealed with tape and bubble wrap, were &quot;empty.&quot; ValuJet workers then loaded the boxes in the cargo hold in the mistaken belief that the devices were simply empty canisters that would be safe and legal to transport on a passenger aircraft.

Chemical oxygen generators, when activated, produce oxygen for passengers if the plane suffers a decompression. However, they also produce a great quantity of heat because of the exothermic nature of the chemical reaction involved. Therefore, not only could the heat and generated oxygen start a fire, but the oxygen could also keep the fire burning.

Investigators determined that one of the oxygen generators was likely triggered when the plane experienced a slight jolt while taxiing. As the aircraft taxied and took off, the generator began releasing heat that caused other canisters to activate. Each activation created more heat, which rapidly caused all of the generators to activate. The intense heat ignited a fire in the other materials in the cargo hold. The fire was worsened by the presence of two main aircraft tires, one of them mounted on a main wheel, and a nose tire and wheel that were also included in the list of materials shipped as COMAT.

Laboratory testing showed that canisters of the same type could heat nearby materials up to . The oxygen from the generators fed the resulting fire in the cargo hold without any need for outside air, defeating the cargo hold&#x27;s airtight design. A pop and jolt heard on the cockpit voice recording and correlated with a brief and dramatic spike in the altimeter reading in the flight data recording were attributed to the sudden cabin-pressure change caused by one of the wheels in the cargo hold exploding from the heat. Investigators also determined that in this process, the fire began to destroy control cables that ran to the back of the aircraft, which explained why the pilots began losing control before the plane crashed. The NTSB concluded that the aircraft was under positive control by the pilots until the time of the sharp right turn and dive immediately prior to impact.

===Regulatory change===
Smoke detectors in the cargo holds can alert the flight crew of a fire long before the problem becomes apparent in the cabin, and a fire-suppression system buys valuable time to land the plane safely. This would prevent a scenario similar to Flight 592 in which the emergency had escalated well beyond the flight crew&#x27;s ability to respond by the time that the problem had become apparent. In February 1998, the FAA issued revised standards requiring all Class D cargo holds to be converted by early 2001 to Class C or E; these types of holds have additional fire-detection and fire-suppression equipment.

===Culpability===
The NTSB report placed responsibility for the accident on three parties:
* SabreTech, for improperly packaging and storing hazardous materials
* ValuJet, for not supervising SabreTech
* The FAA, for not mandating smoke-detection and fire-suppression systems in cargo holds as recommended in 1988 after a similar incident with American Airlines Flight 132
In 1997, a federal grand jury indicted SabreTech for mishandling hazardous materials, failing to train its employees in proper handling of hazardous materials, conspiracy and making false statements. SabreTech&#x27;s maintenance supervisor Daniel Gonzalez and two mechanics who worked on the plane, Eugene Florence and Mauro Ociel Valenzuela-Reyes, were charged with conspiracy and making false statements. Two years later, having been found guilty on the mishandling hazardous materials and improper training charges, SabreTech was fined $2 million and ordered to pay $9 million in restitution. Gonzalez and Florence were acquitted on all charges, while Valenzuela failed to appear and was indicted &quot;in absentia&quot; for contempt of court. A warrant was issued for Valenzuela&#x27;s arrest in 2000, and he remains a fugitive as of 2025. In 2010, he was specifically highlighted in the EPA&#x27;s announcement of a website to search for &quot;environmental fugitives.&quot; The FBI has offered a $10,000 reward for information on his whereabouts.

In May 2001, SabreTech agreed to pay $2.25 million in fines to the FAA (later reduced to $1.75 million), but did not admit wrongdoing. In November 2001, the United States 11th Circuit Court of Appeals overturned most of the verdict against SabreTech. It found that at the time, federal law did not support criminal penalties for reckless violations of hazmat regulations. SabreTech had been convicted of violating the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act, which did not provide criminal penalties for reckless violations of the act. However, the 11th Circuit did allow the conviction for improper training to stand, and remanded that count to a lower court for resentencing. In 2002, federal judge James Lawrence King sentenced SabreTech to a $500,000 fine and three years&#x27; probation.

Just before the federal trial, a Florida grand jury indicted SabreTech on 110 counts of manslaughter and another 110 counts of third-degree murder: one for each person who died in the crash. SabreTech settled the state charges by agreeing to plead no contest to a state charge of mishandling hazardous materials and make a $500,000 donation to promote aviation safety.

SabreTech was the first American aviation company to be criminally prosecuted and convicted for its role in an American airline crash. The company, a subsidiary of St. Louis-based Sabreliner Corporation, went out of business in 1999.

ValuJet was grounded by the FAA on June 16, 1996. It was allowed to resume flying again on September 30, but never recovered from the crash. In 1997, the company acquired AirTran Airways. Although ValuJet was the nominal survivor, the merged airline took the AirTran name. ValuJet executives believed that a new name was important to regain the trust of the flying public. AirTran made little mention of its past as ValuJet, though it did not make any major announcements on the crash&#x27;s 10th anniversary out of respect for the victims. In 2011, AirTran was purchased by Southwest Airlines.

Many families of Flight 592&#x27;s victims were outraged that ValuJet was not prosecuted, given the airline&#x27;s poor safety record. ValuJet&#x27;s accident rate was not only 14 times higher than that of legacy airlines, but one of the highest in the low-fare sector as well. In the aftermath of the crash, an internal FAA memo surfaced questioning whether ValuJet should have been allowed to stay in the air. The victims&#x27; families also point to statements made by ValuJet&#x27;s officials immediately after the crash that led many to believe that ValuJet knew that the generators were on the plane and had ordered them returned to Atlanta rather than properly disposed in Miami.

==Legacy==
On the third anniversary of the accident in 1999, a memorial was dedicated to the victims in the Everglades. The memorial, consisting of 110 concrete pillars, is located just north of Tamiami Trail, about 12 miles west of Krome Avenue in Miami-Dade County. It points to the location of the crash site 12 miles to the north-northeast. Students from the American Institute of Architecture Students designed the memorial, and local contractors, masons and labor unions built it for free.

In a June 4, 2013 &quot;Miami Herald&quot; article, a local resident stated that while slogging through the sawgrass several months earlier, he had found a partially melted gold pendant in the same area. It was believed to have been a possession of a victim of either the ValuJet crash or the crash of Eastern Air Lines Flight 401, which had occurred about from the ValuJet crash site.

==In popular culture==
Three National Geographic shows, &quot;Why Planes Crash&quot; (&quot;Fire in the Sky&quot;), &quot;Seconds from Disaster&quot; (&quot;Florida Swamp Air Crash&quot;) and &quot;Mayday&quot; (&quot;Fire in the Hold&quot;), covered the crash. It was also featured in the last episode of the four-part Travel Channel series &quot;Probable Cause: Air Crash Investigations&quot; and in an episode of &quot;Cops&quot; being filmed in the Miami area at the time. The series premiere of &quot;&quot; also referenced elements of the crash such as the Everglades search.

<doc id="375127" wikidata="Q643872" url="?curid=375127" title="Gemini 1">
<text>Gemini 1 was the first mission in NASA&#x27;s Gemini program. An uncrewed test flight of the Gemini spacecraft, its main objectives were to test the structural integrity of the new spacecraft and modified Titan II launch vehicle. It was also the first test of the new tracking and communication systems for the Gemini program and provided training for the ground support crews for the first crewed missions.

Originally scheduled for launch in December 1963, difficulties in the development of both the spacecraft and its booster caused four months of delay. Gemini 1 was launched from Launch Complex 19 at Cape Kennedy (now Canaveral), Florida on April 8, 1964. The spacecraft stayed attached to the second stage of the rocket. The mission lasted for three orbits while test data were taken, but the spacecraft stayed in space for almost 64 orbits until its orbit decayed due to atmospheric drag. The spacecraft was not intended to be recovered, and holes were drilled through its heat shield to ensure it would not survive re-entry.

== Background ==

Project Gemini was conceived as a bridge between America&#x27;s single-seat Project Mercury and the three-seat Project Apollo. With a design largely extrapolated from its predecessor, the Gemini spacecraft would allow two astronauts to conduct the maneuvers inherent in Apollo&#x27;s lunar mission: rendezvous, docking, and changing of orbit. Moreover, Gemini would support astronauts in space for extended flights, approximating the expected length of the Apollo missions.

Its two-person capacity and greater capabilities meant that Gemini would be a substantially heavier spacecraft than Mercury had been — too heavy to be lofted into orbit by Mercury&#x27;s Atlas rocket. A replacement was needed. The newly developed Titan II ICBM (which had also been tapped by the Air Force for its X-20 spaceplane project) was an attractive replacement. It had a thrust some two and a half times that of the Atlas, a far simpler mechanical construction, and the ability to store propellants indefinitely. Moreover, the Titan II&#x27;s propellants mixed less violently than those of Atlas meaning a booster explosion, should it happen, would be less violent. This made obsolete the heavy escape tower used in the Mercury program; instead, ejection seats could be used.

The primary goal of the first Gemini mission was to flight test the modified Titan II launch vehicle and the basic structural soundness of the Gemini capsule under launch and orbital conditions. Consequently, the first Gemini capsule could be a largely boilerplate structure. Secondary goals of the mission included testing the remote guidance systems, the Titan&#x27;s redundancy systems, and evaluation of the Gemini-Titan malfunction detection system.

== Pre-flight ==

Gemini Spacecraft Number 1 was built specifically for the uncrewed mission. Most internal systems were replaced with dummies and ballast approximating the weight and balance of the crewed spacecraft. In place of the crew couches, two pallets of instruments were installed for the relaying via telemetry of the pressure, vibration, acceleration, temperature, and structural loads experienced during the short flight. A spacecraft heat shield was installed, but four large holes were drilled in it to ensure Gemini 1 was destroyed during reentry.

Even with the simplified systems, this first Gemini encountered several weeks of delay in testing. Nevertheless, it was not the spacecraft that caused the launch date, originally planned for December 1963, to slip. Rather, it was the testing and man-rating of the Titan II launch vehicle. Assembled on May 21, 1963, the first Titan-Gemini launch vehicle required comprehensive testing and retesting, and it was not until October that it was ready for transport to the launch site — where considerable preparation still had to be done. Moreover, there was concern that the Titan II produced too much vertical oscillation (pogo) to be usable at all, and consideration was given to using the Saturn I rocket instead, at least for the first missions. However, on November 1, 1963, the Air Force flew a Titan II rocket with standpipes in its oxidizer lines and mechanical accumulators in its fuel lines, which suppressed the pogo effect.

Inefficient project management threatened to further delay the first Gemini launch, which by November had already been pushed back to February 28, 1964. Gemini Manager Charles Mathews united the several disparate teams into a single Gemini Launch Vehicle Coordination Committee with clearly defined management and communication channels. This measure ensured that no more time would be lost due to uncertain authority, duplicated effort, or conflicting decisions. Still, issues that arose during testing caused the launch date to slip further. The Titan II booster was not ready for final readiness testing until March 3, 1964, the same day that Gemini Spacecraft Number 1 arrived at the launch complex for mating with its booster. Faulty test equipment caused a further delay of two weeks. By late March, all serious hurdles cleared, Gemini 1&#x27;s launch date was set for April 7. The resolution of a failure in the secondary autopilot caused one last day of delay. Finally, by noon of the seventh, Gemini 1&#x27;s Mission Review Board determined unanimously that all systems were cleared for flight.

== Mission and results ==
After a flawless countdown, Gemini 1&#x27;s Titan II booster lifted off from Cape Kennedy&#x27;s (now Canaveral) Launch Complex 19 at 11:00:01 EDT, April 8, 1964. The first stage was jettisoned after two and a half minutes with the rocket high and downrange. At that moment, there was an unexpected three-second loss of signal from the craft. It was later determined that this brief communications blackout was caused by charged ions from the separation and startup of the second stage, similar to the blackout during spacecraft reentry. All subsequent Gemini flights would have the same brief blackout.

The spacecraft achieved orbit five and a half minutes after launch. The launch vehicle had imparted an excess 7 meters (24 feet) per second of velocity to the Gemini 1, placing the spacecraft into an orbit with an apogee of instead of the planned . This lengthened Gemini 1&#x27;s lifespan from the planned three and a half days to four.

The formal mission of Gemini 1 was over long before that. Its battery had only been designed to last a single orbit, and only the first three orbits — lasting four hours and 50 minutes — were part of the flight plan. Gemini 1 and its attached second stage were tracked by the Manned Space Flight Network until they reentered over the South Atlantic, midway between South America and Africa, on April 12, 1964, during their 64th orbit.

As a result of the successful flight, the Titan II was considered &quot;man-rated&quot; (safe for use in human spaceflight). Man-rating the Gemini capsule itself would not be accomplished until the launch of Gemini 2 nine months later, on January 19, 1965.

The Gemini 1 mission was supported by 5,176 United States Department of Defense personnel, as well as eleven aircraft and three ships provided by the Department of Defense.

<doc id="375128" wikidata="Q6276315" url="?curid=375128" title="Jordan, Hong Kong">
<text>Jordan () is an area in Hong Kong, located on Kowloon Peninsula. It is named after a road of the same name in the district. The area is bordered by King&#x27;s Park to the east, Tsim Sha Tsui to the south, Ferry Point to the west, and Yau Ma Tei to the north. Administratively, it is part of Yau Tsim Mong District.

==Geography==
Jordan is located in the central part of the Yau Tsim Mong District. The western portion is officially known as Kwun Chung (), especially before the MTR metro system went into service in 1979.

Jordan is considered as an area surrounded by Cox&#x27;s Road to the east, Austin Road to the south, Ferry Street to the west, and to the north. This would make Jordan approximately in size with a population of about 150,000.

Like most of southern Kowloon, Jordan is entirely developed and urbanised other than a few small parks. Motor and pedestrian traffic throughout most of the day is very dense.

==Character==

Jordan is a microcosm of working-class Hong Kong. Like nearby districts of Mong Kok and Tsim Sha Tsui, large sections of Jordan hosts a mix of older residential high-rises, office buildings, street markets, hotels, eateries and an almost infinite variety of small shops. There are also sections offering karaoke, hostess bars and massage parlours; nearby Mong Kok is better known for such services, however.

Although Jordan lacks the sights and comforts to support mass mainstream tourism, it still attracts a small cadre of adventurous tourists interested in experiencing authentic working-class life in Hong Kong. For locals, many live in Jordan for its relatively affordable housing, its centralised location on the spine of Hong Kong&#x27;s transportation network and its diverse cultural flavour.

Jordan is home to a large number of Indians, Pakistanis, Nepalese and other ethnic minorities. The area bordering Ferry Point therefore hosts a wide array of South Asian and other restaurants and market stores.

<doc id="375130" wikidata="Q184564" url="?curid=375130" title="Aldosterone">
<text>Aldosterone is the main mineralocorticoid steroid hormone produced by the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex in the adrenal gland. It is essential for sodium conservation in the kidney, salivary glands, sweat glands, and colon. It plays a central role in the homeostatic regulation of blood pressure, plasma sodium (Na+), and potassium (K+) levels. It does so primarily by acting on the mineralocorticoid receptors in the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the nephron. It influences the reabsorption of sodium and excretion of potassium (from and into the tubular fluids, respectively) of the kidney, thereby indirectly influencing water retention or loss, blood pressure, and blood volume. When dysregulated, aldosterone is pathogenic and contributes to the development and progression of cardiovascular and kidney disease. Aldosterone has exactly the opposite function of the atrial natriuretic hormone secreted by the heart.

Aldosterone is part of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system. It has a plasma half-life of less than 20 minutes. Drugs that interfere with the secretion or action of aldosterone are in use as antihypertensives, like lisinopril, which lowers blood pressure by blocking the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), leading to lower aldosterone secretion. The net effect of these drugs is to reduce sodium and water retention but increase the retention of potassium. In other words, these drugs stimulate the excretion of sodium and water in urine, while they block the excretion of potassium.

Another example is spironolactone, a potassium-sparing diuretic of the steroidal spirolactone group, which interferes with the aldosterone receptor (among others) leading to lower blood pressure by the mechanism described above.

Aldosterone was first isolated by Sylvia Tait (Simpson) and Jim Tait in 1953; in collaboration with Tadeusz Reichstein.

==Biosynthesis==

The corticosteroids are synthesized from cholesterol within the zona glomerulosa and zona fasciculata of adrenal cortex. Most steroidogenic reactions are catalysed by enzymes of the cytochrome P450 family. They are located within the mitochondria and require adrenodoxin as a cofactor (except 21-hydroxylase and 17α-hydroxylase).

Aldosterone and corticosterone share the first part of their biosynthetic pathways. The last parts are mediated either by the aldosterone synthase (for aldosterone) or by the 11β-hydroxylase (for corticosterone). These enzymes are nearly identical (they share 11β-hydroxylation and 18-hydroxylation functions), but aldosterone synthase is also able to perform an 18-oxidation. Moreover, aldosterone synthase is found within the zona glomerulosa at the outer edge of the adrenal cortex; 11β-hydroxylase is found in the zona glomerulosa and zona fasciculata.
Aldosterone synthase is normally absent in other sections of the adrenal gland.

===Stimulation===
Aldosterone synthesis is stimulated by several factors:
* increase in the plasma concentration of angiotensin III, a metabolite of angiotensin II
* increase in plasma angiotensin II, ACTH, or potassium levels, which are present in proportion to plasma sodium deficiencies. (The increased potassium level works to regulate aldosterone synthesis by depolarizing the cells in the zona glomerulosa, which opens the voltage-dependent calcium channels.) The level of angiotensin II is regulated by angiotensin I, which is in turn regulated by renin, a hormone secreted in the kidneys.
* Serum potassium concentrations are the most potent stimulator of aldosterone secretion.
* the ACTH stimulation test, which is sometimes used to stimulate the production of aldosterone along with cortisol to determine whether primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency is present. However, ACTH has only a minor role in regulating aldosterone production; with hypopituitarism there is no atrophy of the zona glomerulosa.
* plasma acidosis
* the stretch receptors located in the atria of the heart. If decreased blood pressure is detected, the adrenal gland is stimulated by these stretch receptors to release aldosterone, which increases sodium reabsorption from the urine, sweat, and the gut. This causes increased osmolarity in the extracellular fluid, which will eventually return blood pressure toward normal.
* adrenoglomerulotropin, a lipid factor, obtained from pineal extracts. It selectively stimulates secretion of aldosterone.

The secretion of aldosterone has a diurnal rhythm.

==Biological function==
Aldosterone is the primary of several endogenous members of the class of mineralocorticoids in humans. Deoxycorticosterone is another important member of this class. Aldosterone tends to promote Na+ and water retention, and lower plasma K+ concentration by the following mechanisms:

# Acting on the nuclear mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) within the principal cells of the distal tubule and the collecting duct of the kidney nephron, it upregulates and activates the basolateral Na+/K+ pumps, which pumps three sodium ions out of the cell, into the interstitial fluid and two potassium ions into the cell from the interstitial fluid. This creates a concentration gradient which results in reabsorption of sodium (Na+) ions and water (which follows sodium) into the blood, and secreting potassium (K+) ions into the urine (lumen of collecting duct).
# Aldosterone upregulates epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs) in the collecting duct and the colon, increasing apical membrane permeability for Na+ and thus absorption.
# Cl− is reabsorbed in conjunction with sodium cations to maintain the system&#x27;s electrochemical balance.
# Aldosterone stimulates the secretion of K+ into the tubular lumen.
# Aldosterone stimulates Na+ and water reabsorption from the gut, salivary and sweat glands in exchange for K+.
# Aldosterone stimulates secretion of H+ via the H+/ATPase in the intercalated cells of the cortical collecting tubules
# Aldosterone upregulates expression of NCC in the distal convoluted tubule chronically and its activity acutely.

Aldosterone is responsible for the reabsorption of about 2% of filtered sodium in the kidneys, which is nearly equal to the entire sodium content in human blood under normal glomerular filtration rates.

Aldosterone, probably acting through mineralocorticoid receptors, may positively influence neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus.

==Mineralocorticoid receptors==
Steroid receptors are intracellular since steroid hormones are able to cross the cell membrane without a specific transporter. The aldosterone mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) complex binds on the DNA to specific hormone response element, which leads to gene specific transcription.
Some of the transcribed genes are crucial for transepithelial sodium transport, including the three subunits of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), the Na+/K+ pumps and their regulatory proteins serum and glucocorticoid-induced kinase, and channel-inducing factor, respectively.

The MR is stimulated by both aldosterone and cortisol, but a mechanism protects the body from excess aldosterone receptor stimulation by glucocorticoids (such as cortisol), which happen to be present at much higher concentrations than mineralocorticoids in the healthy individual. The mechanism consists of an enzyme called 11β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD). This enzyme co-localizes with intracellular adrenal steroid receptors and converts cortisol into cortisone, a relatively inactive metabolite with little affinity for the MR. Liquorice, which contains glycyrrhetinic acid, can inhibit 11β-HSD and lead to a mineralocorticoid excess syndrome.

==Control of aldosterone release from the adrenal cortex==
===Major regulators===

====The role of the renin–angiotensin system====
Angiotensin is involved in regulating aldosterone and is the core regulation. Angiotensin II acts synergistically with potassium, and the potassium feedback is virtually inoperative when no angiotensin II is present. A small portion of the regulation resulting from angiotensin II must take place indirectly from decreased blood flow through the liver due to constriction of capillaries. When the blood flow decreases so does the destruction of aldosterone by liver enzymes.

Although sustained production of aldosterone requires persistent calcium entry through low-voltage-activated Ca2+ channels, isolated zona glomerulosa cells are considered nonexcitable, with recorded membrane voltages that are too hyperpolarized to permit Ca2+ channels entry. However, mouse zona glomerulosa cells within adrenal slices spontaneously generate membrane potential oscillations of low periodicity; this innate electrical excitability of zona glomerulosa cells provides a platform for the production of a recurrent Ca2+ channels signal that can be controlled by angiotensin II and extracellular potassium, the 2 major regulators of aldosterone production. Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels have been detected in the zona glomerulosa of the human adrenal, which suggests that Ca2+ channel blockers may directly influence the adrenocortical biosynthesis of aldosterone in vivo.

====The plasma concentration of potassium====
The amount of plasma renin secreted is an indirect function of the serum potassium as probably determined by sensors in the carotid artery.

====Adrenocorticotropic hormone====
Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), a pituitary peptide, also has some stimulating effect on aldosterone, probably by stimulating the formation of deoxycorticosterone, a precursor of aldosterone. Aldosterone is increased by blood loss, pregnancy, and possibly by further circumstances such as physical exertion, endotoxin shock, and burns.

===Miscellaneous regulators===

====The role of sympathetic nerves====
The aldosterone production is also affected to one extent or another by nervous control, which integrates the inverse of carotid artery pressure, pain, posture, and probably emotion (anxiety, fear, and hostility) (including surgical stress). Anxiety increases aldosterone, which must have evolved because of the time delay involved in migration of aldosterone into the cell nucleus. Thus, there is an advantage to an animal&#x27;s anticipating a future need from interaction with a predator, since too high a serum content of potassium has very adverse effects on nervous transmission.

====The role of baroreceptors====
Pressure-sensitive baroreceptors are found in the vessel walls of nearly all large arteries in the thorax and neck, but are particularly plentiful in the sinuses of the carotid arteries and in the arch of the aorta. These specialized receptors are sensitive to changes in mean arterial pressure. An increase in sensed pressure results in an increased rate of firing by the baroreceptors and a negative feedback response, lowering systemic arterial pressure. Aldosterone release causes sodium and water retention, which causes increased blood volume, and a subsequent increase in blood pressure, which is sensed by the baroreceptors. To maintain normal homeostasis these receptors also detect low blood pressure or low blood volume, causing aldosterone to be released. This results in sodium retention in the kidney, leading to water retention and increased blood volume.
====The plasma concentration of sodium====
Aldosterone levels vary as an inverse function of sodium intake as sensed via osmotic pressure. The slope of the response of aldosterone to serum potassium is almost independent of sodium intake. Aldosterone is increased at low sodium intakes, but the rate of increase of plasma aldosterone as potassium rises in the serum is not much lower at high sodium intakes than it is at low. Thus, potassium is strongly regulated at all sodium intakes by aldosterone when the supply of potassium is adequate, which it usually is in hunter-gatherer diets.

===Aldosterone feedback===
Feedback by aldosterone concentration itself is of a nonmorphological character (that is, other than changes in the cells&#x27; number or structure) and is poor, so the electrolyte feedbacks predominate, short term.

==Associated clinical conditions==
Hyperaldosteronism is abnormally increased levels of aldosterone, while hypoaldosteronism is abnormally decreased levels of aldosterone.

A measurement of aldosterone in blood may be termed a &quot;plasma aldosterone concentration&quot; (&quot;PAC&quot;), which may be compared to plasma renin activity (PRA) as an aldosterone-to-renin ratio.

===Hyperaldosteronism===
Primary aldosteronism, also known as &quot;primary hyperaldosteronism&quot;, is characterized by the overproduction of aldosterone by the adrenal glands, when not a result of excessive renin secretion. It leads to arterial hypertension (high blood pressure) associated with hypokalemia, usually a diagnostic clue. Secondary hyperaldosteronism, on the other hand, is due to overactivity of the renin–angiotensin system.

Conn&#x27;s syndrome is primary hyperaldosteronism caused by an aldosterone-producing adenoma.

Depending on cause and other factors, hyperaldosteronism can be treated by surgery and/or medically, such as by aldosterone antagonists.

The ratio of renin to aldosterone is an effective screening test to screen for primary hyperaldosteronism related to adrenal adenomas. It is the most sensitive serum blood test to differentiate primary from secondary causes of hyperaldosteronism. Blood obtained when the patient has been standing for more than 2 hours are more sensitive than those from when the patient is lying down. Before the test, individuals should not restrict salt and low potassium should be corrected before the test because it can suppress aldosterone secretion.

===Hypoaldosteronism===
An ACTH stimulation test for aldosterone can help in determining the cause of hypoaldosteronism, with a low aldosterone response indicating a primary hypoaldosteronism of the adrenals, while a large response indicating a secondary hypoaldosteronism.
The most common cause of this condition (and related symptoms) is Addison&#x27;s disease; it is typically treated by fludrocortisone, which has a much longer persistence (1 day) in the bloodstream.

<doc id="375136" wikidata="Q423211" url="?curid=375136" title="Glyceraldehyde">
<text>Glyceraldehyde (glyceral) is a triose monosaccharide with chemical formula C3H6O3. It is the simplest of all common aldoses. It is a sweet, colorless, crystalline solid that is an intermediate compound in carbohydrate metabolism. The word comes from combining glycerol and aldehyde, as glyceraldehyde is glycerol with one alcohol group oxidized to an aldehyde.

== Structure ==
Glyceraldehyde has one chiral center and therefore exists as two different enantiomers with opposite optical rotation:

* In the nomenclature, either from Latin &quot;Dexter&quot; meaning &quot;right&quot;, or from Latin &quot;Laevo&quot; meaning &quot;left&quot;
* In the R/S nomenclature, either R from Latin &quot;Rectus&quot; meaning &quot;right&quot;, or S from Latin &quot;Sinister&quot; meaning &quot;left&quot;

While the optical rotation of glyceraldehyde is (+) for &quot;R&quot; and (−) for &quot;S&quot;, this is not true for all monosaccharides. The stereochemical configuration can only be determined from the chemical structure, whereas the optical rotation can only be determined empirically (by experiment).

It was by a lucky guess that the molecular geometry was assigned to (+)-glyceraldehyde in the late 19th century, as confirmed by X-ray crystallography in 1951.

===Aqueous and concentrated solutions of glyceraldehyde===
The description above focuses on classification of isomers, but the glyceraldehyde is subject to a further complications: the tendency of hydroxy-aldehydes to exist as hydrates. NMR measurements indicate that in aqueous solution, glyceraldehyde exists in a hydrate owing to this reaction:
The same study indicates that concentrated (&quot;syrupy&quot;) forms of glyceraldehyde exist as dimers, indicating hemiacetal formation.

== Nomenclature ==
In the system, glyceraldehyde is used as the configurational standard for carbohydrates. Monosaccharides with an absolute configuration identical to (&quot;R&quot;)-glyceraldehyde at the &quot;last&quot; stereocentre, for example C5 in glucose, are assigned the stereo-descriptor . Those similar to (&quot;S&quot;)-glyceraldehyde are assigned an . 

==Synthesis and reactions==
Glyceraldehyde can be prepared from acetals of acrolein (CH2=CHCHO) in two steps, oxidation followed by hydrolysis of the acetal. Its cyclohexylidene acetal can also be produced by oxidative cleavage of the bis(acetal) of mannitol.

Glyceraldehyde is a precursor to four-carbon sugars (tetroses) via cyanation followed by hydrolysis of the cyanohydrin:
:

== Biochemistry ==
The enzyme glycerol dehydrogenase (NADP+) has two substrates, glycerol and NADP+, and 3 products, D-glyceraldehyde, NADPH and H+.

The interconversion of the phosphates of glyceraldehyde (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate) and dihydroxyacetone (dihydroxyacetone phosphate), catalyzed by the enzyme triosephosphate isomerase, is an intermediate step in glycolysis.

<text>Rashad Khalifa (; November 19, 1935 – January 31, 1990) was an Egyptian-American biochemist, closely associated with the United Submitters International (USI), an organization that promotes the practice and study of Quranism. Khalifa saw his role as purging the accretions that found their way into Islam via hadith and sunnah, which he claimed were corrupted. Similarly, he believed that previous revelations of God, such as the Bible, contained contradictions due to human interference (a concept known as &quot;tahrif)&quot;.
Instead, he believed that the beliefs and practices of Islam should be based on the Quran alone. He is also known for his claims regarding the existence of a Quran code, also known as The Number 19. 

However, his changing views regarding the essence of faith, recorded in his two renditions of the Quran, and declaring himself as a divine messenger who communicated with Gabriel, drew opposition from other Muslims. On January 31, 1990, Khalifa was found stabbed to death inside the Mosque of Tucson, in Arizona, which he founded.

==Life==

Khalifa was born in Egypt on November 19, 1935. He obtained an honors degree from Ain Shams University, before he immigrated to the United States in 1959. He later earned a Master&#x27;s Degree in biochemistry from University of Arizona and a Ph.D. from University of California, Riverside. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen and lived in Tucson, Arizona. He was married to an American woman and they had a son and a daughter together.

Khalifa worked as a science adviser for the Libyan government for about one year, after which he worked as a chemist for the United Nations Industrial Development Organization. He next worked as a senior chemist in Arizona&#x27;s State Office of Chemistry in 1980.

He founded the United Submitters International (USI), an organization that promulgated his beliefs.

==Doctrine==
He saw his role as purging the accretions that found their way into Islam via hadith and sunnah, which he claimed were corrupted. Similarly, he believed that previous revelations of God, such as the Bible, contained contradictions due to human interference (a concept known as &quot;tahrif)&quot;. Instead, he believed that the beliefs and practices of Islam should be based on the Quran alone.

Starting in 1968, Khalifa used computers to analyze the frequency of letters and words in the Quran. He published his findings in 1973 in the book &quot;Miracle of the Quran: Significance of the Mysterious Alphabets&quot;, in 1981 in the book &quot;The Computer Speaks: God&#x27;s Message to the World&quot;, and in 1982 in the book &quot;Quran: Visual Presentation of the Miracle&quot;. Khalifa claimed that the Quran, unlike the Hadith, was incorruptible because it contained a mathematical structure based on the number 19, namely the Quran code or known as Code 19. For example, he claimed that this mathematical structure rejected the Quranic verses 9:128-129. Some Muslims objected to this interpretation. However, Khalifa believed this mathematical structure prevented the Quran from being adulterated and that it was proof of its divine authorship.

Khalifa&#x27;s research did not receive much attention in the West. In 1980, Martin Gardner mentioned it in &quot;Scientific American&quot;. Gardner later wrote a more extensive and critical review of Khalifa and his work.

==Assassination==
On January 31, 1990, Khalifa was found stabbed to death inside the mosque of Tucson, Arizona, which he founded. 

Nineteen years after the murder, on April 28, 2009, the Calgary Police Service arrested Glen Cusford Francis, a 52-year-old citizen of Trinidad and Tobago, on suspicion of having killed Rashad Khalifa. Investigators in Tucson learned that Francis, who was going by the name Benjamin Phillips, had begun his studies under Khalifa in January 1990. Phillips disappeared shortly after the slaying, and was said to have left the country. An investigation revealed Phillips and Francis were the same man when the police analyzed fingerprints found in Phillips&#x27; apartment. A specialty unit of the Tucson Police Department progressed in its investigation in 2006 and in December 2008, and was able to use DNA testing on forensic evidence from the crime scene to tie Francis to the assassination. In October 2009, a Canadian judge ordered Francis&#x27;s extradition to the United States to face trial.

The trial for the murder began on December 11, 2012. On December 19, the jury, after a three-hour deliberation, found Glen Francis guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced him to life in prison. Prior to the Francis trial, James Williams, an alleged member of the Jamaat ul-Fuqra organization, was convicted of conspiracy in the slaying. Williams disappeared in 1994 on the day of his sentencing. In 2000, Williams was apprehended attempting to re-enter the United States and was sentenced to serve 69 years in prison. In 2003, his convictions were upheld on appeal by the Colorado Court of Appeals, except for one count of forgery.

<doc id="375140" wikidata="Q7366241" url="?curid=375140" title="Room-temperature superconductor">
<text>A room-temperature superconductor is a hypothetical material capable of displaying superconductivity above , operating temperatures which are commonly encountered in everyday settings. As of 2023, the material with the highest accepted superconducting temperature was highly pressurized lanthanum decahydride, whose transition temperature is approximately at 200 GPa.

At standard atmospheric pressure, cuprates currently hold the temperature record, manifesting superconductivity at temperatures as high as . Over time, researchers have consistently encountered superconductivity at temperatures previously considered unexpected or impossible, challenging the notion that achieving superconductivity at room temperature was infeasible. The concept of &quot;near-room temperature&quot; transient effects has been a subject of discussion since the early 1950s.

== Reports ==
Since the discovery of high-temperature superconductors (&quot;high&quot; being temperatures above , the boiling point of liquid nitrogen), several materials have been claimed, although not confirmed, to be room-temperature superconductors.

=== Corroborated studies ===
In 2014, an article published in &quot;Nature&quot; suggested that some materials, notably YBCO (yttrium barium copper oxide), could be made to briefly superconduct at room temperature using infrared laser pulses.

In 2015, an article published in &quot;Nature&quot; by researchers of the Otto Hahn Institute suggested that under certain conditions such as extreme pressure transitioned to a superconductive form at 150 GPa (around 1.5 million times atmospheric pressure) in a diamond anvil cell. The critical temperature is which would be the highest &quot;T&quot;c ever recorded and their research suggests that other hydrogen compounds could superconduct at up to .

Also in 2018, researchers noted a possible superconducting phase at in lanthanum decahydride () at elevated (200 GPa) pressure. In 2019, the material with the highest accepted superconducting temperature was highly pressurized lanthanum decahydride, whose transition temperature is approximately .

=== Uncorroborated studies ===
In 1993 and 1997, Michel Laguës and his team published evidence of room temperature superconductivity observed on MBE deposited ultrathin nanostructures of BiSrCaCuO. These compounds exhibit extremely low resistivities orders of magnitude below that of copper, strongly non-linear I(V) characteristics and hysteretic I(V) behavior. 

In 2000, while extracting electrons from diamond during ion implantation work, Johan Prins claimed to have observed a phenomenon that he explained as room-temperature superconductivity within a phase formed on the surface of oxygen-doped type IIa diamonds in a vacuum.

In 2003, a group of researchers published results on high-temperature superconductivity in palladium hydride (PdH&quot;x&quot;: ) and an explanation in 2004. In 2007, the same group published results suggesting a superconducting transition temperature of 260 K, with transition temperature increasing as the density of hydrogen inside the palladium lattice increases. This has not been corroborated by other groups.

In March 2021, an announcement reported superconductivity in a layered yttrium-palladium-hydron material at 262 K and a pressure of 187 GPa. Palladium may act as a hydrogen migration catalyst in the material.

On 31 December 2023, &quot;Global Room-Temperature Superconductivity in Graphite&quot; was published in the journal &quot;Advanced Quantum Technologies&quot;, claiming to demonstrate superconductivity at room temperature and ambient pressure in highly oriented pyrolytic graphite with dense arrays of nearly parallel line defects.

=== Retracted or unreliable studies ===
In 2012, an &quot;Advanced Materials&quot; article claimed superconducting behavior of graphite powder after treatment with pure water at temperatures as high as 300 K and above. So far, the authors have not been able to demonstrate the occurrence of a clear Meissner phase and the vanishing of the material&#x27;s resistance.

In 2018, Dev Kumar Thapa and Anshu Pandey from the Solid State and Structural Chemistry Unit of the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore claimed the observation of superconductivity at ambient pressure and room temperature in films and pellets of a nanostructured material that is composed of silver particles embedded in a gold matrix. Due to similar noise patterns of supposedly independent plots and the publication&#x27;s lack of peer review, the results have been called into question. Although the researchers repeated their findings in a later paper in 2019, this claim is yet to be verified and confirmed.

Since 2016, a team led by Ranga P. Dias has produced a number of retracted or challenged papers in this field. In 2016 they claimed observation of solid metallic hydrogen in 2016. In October 2020, they reported room-temperature superconductivity at 288 K (at 15 °C) in a carbonaceous sulfur hydride at 267 GPa, triggered into crystallisation via green laser. This was retracted in 2022 after flaws in their statistical methods were identified and led to questioning of other data. In 2023 he reported superconductivity at 294 K and 1 GPa in nitrogen-doped lutetium hydride, in a paper widely met with skepticism about its methods and data. Later in 2023 he was found to have plagiarized parts of his dissertation from someone else&#x27;s thesis, and to have fabricated data in a paper on manganese disulfide, which was retracted. The lutetium hydride paper was also retracted. The first attempts to replicate those results failed.

On July 23, 2023, a Korean team claimed that Cu-doped lead apatite, which they named LK-99, was superconducting up to 370 K, though they had not observed this fully. They posted two preprints to arXiv, published a paper in a journal, and submitted a patent application. The reported observations were received with skepticism by experts due to the lack of clear signatures of superconductivity. The story was widely discussed on social media, leading to a large number of attempted replications, none of which had more than qualified success. By mid-August, a series of papers from major labs provided significant evidence that LK-99 was not a superconductor, finding resistivity much higher than copper, and explaining observed effects such as magnetic response and resistance drops in terms of impurities and ferromagnetism in the material.

== Theories ==
=== Metallic hydrogen and phonon-mediated pairing ===
Theoretical work by British physicist Neil Ashcroft predicted that solid metallic hydrogen at extremely high pressure (~500 GPa) should become superconducting at approximately room temperature, due to its extremely high speed of sound and expected strong coupling between the conduction electrons and the lattice-vibration phonons.

A team at Harvard University has claimed to make metallic hydrogen and reports a pressure of 495 GPa. Though the exact critical temperature has not yet been determined, weak signs of a possible Meissner effect and changes in magnetic susceptibility at 250 K may have appeared in early magnetometer tests on an original now-lost sample. A French team is working with doughnut shapes rather than planar at the diamond culette tips.

=== Organic polymers and exciton-mediated pairing ===
In 1964, William A. Little proposed the possibility of high-temperature superconductivity in organic polymers.

=== Other hydrides ===
In 2004, Ashcroft returned to his idea and suggested that hydrogen-rich compounds can become metallic and superconducting at lower pressures than hydrogen. More specifically, he proposed a novel way to pre-compress hydrogen chemically by examining IVa hydrides.

In 2014–2015, conventional superconductivity was observed in a sulfur hydride system ( or ) at 190 K to 203 K at pressures of up to 200 GPa.

In 2016, research suggested a link between palladium hydride containing small impurities of sulfur nanoparticles as a plausible explanation for the anomalous transient resistance drops seen during some experiments, and hydrogen absorption by cuprates was suggested in light of the 2015 results in as a plausible explanation for transient resistance drops or &quot;USO&quot; noticed in the 1990s by Chu &quot;et al.&quot; during research after the discovery of YBCO.

It has been predicted that (scandium dodecahydride) would exhibit superconductivity at room temperature – between and – under a pressure expected not to exceed 100 GPa.

Some research efforts are currently moving towards ternary superhydrides, where it has been predicted that (dilithium magnesium hexadecahydride) would have a of at 250 GPa.

=== Spin coupling ===
It is also possible that if the bipolaron explanation is correct, a normally semiconducting material can transition under some conditions into a superconductor if a critical level of alternating spin coupling in a single plane within the lattice is exceeded; this may have been documented in very early experiments from 1986. The best analogy here would be anisotropic magnetoresistance, but in this case the outcome is a drop to zero rather than a decrease within a very narrow temperature range for the compounds tested similar to &quot;re-entrant superconductivity&quot;.

In 2018, support was found for electrons having anomalous 3/2 spin states in YPtBi. Though YPtBi is a relatively low temperature superconductor, this does suggest another approach to creating superconductors.

&quot;Quantum bipolarons&quot; could describe how a material might superconduct at up to nearly room temperature.

<text>The Massey Lectures is an annual five-part series of lectures given in Canada by distinguished writers, thinkers, and scholars who explore important ideas and issues of contemporary interest. Created in 1961 in honour of Vincent Massey, a former Governor General of Canada and coordinator of the 1951 Massey Report, it is widely regarded as one of the most acclaimed lecture series in the country.

Notable Massey lecturers have included Northrop Frye, John Kenneth Galbraith, Noam Chomsky, Jean Vanier, Margaret Atwood, Ursula Franklin, George Steiner, Claude Levi Strauss, and Nobel laureates Martin Luther King Jr., George Wald, Willy Brandt, and Doris Lessing. In 2003, novelist Thomas King was the first person of Cherokee descent to be invited as a lecturer.

== Sponsorship ==
The event is co-sponsored by CBC Radio, House of Anansi Press and Massey College in the University of Toronto. The lectures have been broadcast by the CBC Radio show &quot;Ideas&quot; since 1965.

Prior to 1989, the lectures were recorded for broadcast in a CBC Radio studio in Toronto. From 1989 to 2002, the lectures were delivered before a live audience at the University of Toronto. Since 2002, the lectures have been presented and recorded for broadcast at public events in five different cities across Canada.

The lectures are broadcast each November on &quot;Ideas&quot; and published simultaneously in book form by House of Anansi Press.

Many of the lectures can be listened to online on the Ideas website, while others can be purchased on various sites.

In addition to the print version for each individual year, several of the earlier lectures are available in compilations, including The Lost Massey Lectures.

===Notes===
For Lawrence Hill&#x27;s Massey Lectures in 2013, the CBC Radio website featured a visual narrative to accompany that year&#x27;s theme &quot;Blood: The Stuff of Life&quot;. The story included full-screen images of blood, animations that visually demonstrated historical attitudes towards blood and videos of people affected culturally by it.

1996 did not feature a lecture because &quot;Ideas&quot; producers and the selected Lecturer Robert Theobald could not agree on an appropriate manuscript for the programme. The theme was to have been on the future of work. Theobald later published his manuscript as &quot;Reworking Success: New Communities at the Millennium&quot; (1997).

<text>Dermot Desmond (born 14 August 1950) is an Irish businessman and financier. He is estimated to be worth €2.04 billion and is ranked by the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; as the ninth-richest person in Ireland.

==Early life and education==
Desmond was born in Macroom, County Cork in 1950 and grew up in Marino, Dublin. He was educated at Scoil Mhuire, Marino and Good Counsel College in New Ross. He left school in 1968 to work at Citibank in Dublin.

==Business career==
In 1968, Desmond&#x27;s business career began with Citibank in Dublin, followed by Price Waterhouse in Kabul, Afghanistan. In 1981, he founded National City Brokers in Dublin. The company competed with already established stockbroking names in Dublin such as Davy&#x27;s and Goodbodys. Desmond sold the company to Ulster Bank in 1994, which at the time was part of the National Westminster Group, for a reported £39 million. Subsequently, as a result of Natwest&#x27;s takeover in 2003 by RBS, NCB was bought out by its management with the support of former billionaire businessman Sean Quinn who was believed at that time to control 25% of the company.

He was appointed chairman of the board of Aer Rianta in 1990 under the Charles Haughey government, but resigned in October 1991 amid the scandal over the purchase of the Johnston Mooney &amp; O&#x27;Brien site by Telecom Éireann.

In 1995, he founded International Investment &amp; Underwriting (IIU), a private equity firm and his primary investment vehicle. It is located in Ireland&#x27;s International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) at IFSC House and is regulated by the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority. Companies that are controlled through IIU include Daon, Inc. (a biometric enabling technology company). IIU Asset Strategies Limited is the hedge fund arm of the company, offering convertible bonds and equity funds.

In 1996, Desmond backed a consortium headed by Fran Rooney to purchase Baltimore Technologies for £300,000. The company quickly purchased an e-commerce license from the EU and it experienced rapid growth over the following years. It was briefly a member of the FTSE 100 and had a market capitalization of £4.5 billion. The company though fell victim to the dotcom bust and all but collapsed.

In 1997, together with business partners John Magnier and J.P. McManus, Desmond purchased the five-star Barbados resort Sandy Lane Hotel. The hotel underwent a US$450 million renovation and was re-opened in 2001.

Desmond purchased London City Airport from Mowlem for £23.5 million in 1995. The investment was considered a large risk as London&#x27;s Docklands was in recession and the neighbouring Canary Wharf development was in receivership. The airport has since become one of the more profitable in the United Kingdom. Desmond sold London City Airport in October 2006 for a reported £750 million to a consortium consisting of insurer AIG, GE Capital and Credit Suisse.

BETDAQ is the trading name of Global Betting Exchange, a betting exchange operator based in Ireland. It is the second largest betting exchange operator in the country. The company was founded in 2000 by Desmond and started trading in September 2001. Its headquarters are in the International Financial Services Centre in Dublin. Desmond sold BETDAQ to Ladbrokes for €30 million in 2013 and is a shareholder at the bookmaker as a result of the deal. In November 2021, Desmond bought BETDAQ back from the Entain group (owner of Ladbrokes Coral) for an &quot;undisclosed sum&quot;.

Desmond was a major shareholder in Irish food company Greencore for several years. He sold his shares in 2006.

In 2005, Desmond opened the Sporting Emporium, a Dublin-based private members gaming club. It was reported Desmond had invested €5.5 million in the venture. After being open for only seven months it faced closure.

Desmond purchased 33.1% of Latvian Rietumu Banka in 2005 for a reported €66 million. He invested in the bank as a result of being very impressed with its management team and capital structure. The investment in Rietumu initially looked a successful one with Desmond&#x27;s holding at one stage being valued at €200 million. However, the subsequent economic downturn has reduced the value of Desmond&#x27;s holding in the bank significantly.

In August 2008, Desmond was offered the position of chairman of the Irish airline Aer Lingus. Desmond turned down the offer citing prior commitments as a factor which would not allow him the sufficient time necessary to do the job. Former GPA chief operating officer and current Babcock &amp; Brown Air chief executive Colm Barrington was subsequently named chairman of Aer Lingus.

On 19 September 2018, it was announced that Desmond had increased his stake in Toronto mining company Mountain Province Diamonds to 28% which is valued at a current market price of approximately $158 million. The company&#x27;s sole asset is the Canadian Gahcho Kue Diamond Mine Project.

In September 2018, he secured planning permission to construct a 17,168 sq ft. palatial mansion on Shrewsbury Road in the D4 postal district of Dublin. In getting the go-ahead for the ambitious mansion plan, Desmond was also given approval to demolish the existing house, &quot;Walford&quot;, the most expensive house ever sold in the State at a €58 million in 2005.

===Glackin report===
In 1991, a company law inspector, solicitor John Glackin, was appointed by the then Government to investigate complicated dealings involving Mr Desmond and the purchase and sale of the former Johnston Mooney and O&#x27;Brien site in Ballsbridge, Dublin. While Mr Desmond represented himself as an intermediary in the sale, Glackin&#x27;s report said Mr Desmond, businessman JP McManus and John Magnier were beneficiaries of the sale. Mr Desmond strenuously disputed Glackin&#x27;s findings. According to the Glackin Report, Hoddle Investments (the vehicle through which the deal was handled) executed two contracts with Telecom Éireann for the sale of the Johnston Mooney &amp; O&#x27;Brien site for an aggregate price of £9.4 million, on 7 May 1990. The proceeds of the sale were lodged to an NCB account.

According to the Moriarty Tribunal report, the next day, on 8 May 1990, £206,613.57 was withdrawn from one NCB account, converted into sterling £200,000 and transferred to the Aurum Nominees No.6 account at NCB (proxied to an offshore Ansbacher Cayman account) held for the benefit of then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey. Aurum Nominees Limited was a company established by NCB for the benefit of its clients, and used at the time by several of the beneficiaries to the deal, including JP McManus, Lochlann Quinn and Martin Naughton. Quinn and Naughton were owed money by Desmond and he used the proceeds of the sale to pay off his debt to them, according to the report.

===Flood Tribunal===
Desmond gave evidence relating to the Century Radio module of the Flood Tribunal. He said he had given former Fianna Fáil press secretary PJ Mara a loan of £46,000 between 1986 and 1989, as Mr Mara claimed he had run into financial difficulties. He said he made the payments by cheque.

===Moriarty Tribunal===
The Moriarty Tribunal found that Desmond made substantial payments to Taoiseach Charles Haughey. In September 1994 Mr Desmond made a payment of £100,000 sterling to Haughey and in October 1996 he made a payment of £25,000 sterling. While Desmond claims these payments to be loans, repayable by Haughey, the Tribunal did not accept this explanation. Ultimately Haughey was forced to settle with the Revenue Commissioners, as it appears he had failed to declare the payments from Desmond.

The Tribunal noted that the payments were made via the Swiss bank account of a company called Anesia Etablissement, Banque Scandinave en Suisse, Case Postale 901, 1211 Geneva 3, of which Desmond was the beneficial owner, via an account at Henry Ansbacher &amp; Company to an account at Cayman International Bank Trust Company, held for Haughey&#x27;s benefit. £25,000 was paid via Desmonds&#x27;s Bottin International Investments Limited which had an account with Anglo Irish Bank, 69 Athol Street, Douglas, Isle of Man. Desmond said Haughey asked him for the money in 1996 because of &quot;a shortage of funds&quot;.

Desmond also loaned money to Feltrim plc, which was at the time managed by Charles Haughey&#x27;s son, Conor Haughey. In August 1991, Desmond loaned the company £55,000, made up of £40,000 loaned on 12 August 1991 and £15,000 on 28 August 1991. Conor Haughey told the Tribunal that the company was in danger of being liquidated and he approached Desmond for the money. The loan was never repaid, and was instead converted into equity.

===Celtic Mist===
Desmond also paid £75,456 for the refurbishment of Haughey&#x27;s yacht, the Celtic Mist, between 1990 and 1991, at a time according to the Tribunal, that Haughey earned between £69,764 and £72,354 a year as Taoiseach. Desmond again claimed this payment was a loan, but the Tribunal disagreed, noting again that Haughey had settled with the Revenue Commissioners in relation to the sum, having failed to pay Capital Gains Tax at the time. The Tribunal also found that the yacht itself amounted to an indirect benefit to Haughey. This was it despite being unable to find the source of the £167,073.90 paid for the yacht. Haughey&#x27;s son Conor told the Tribunal in 1999 that he had learned money to refurbish the yacht had come from the bank account of Freezone Limited. Money from the sale of the Johnston Mooney &amp; O&#x27;Brien site had ended up in the same account – a revelation that Conor Haughey said he was &quot;very concerned&quot; about.

The yacht was subsequently given to the Irish Whale and Dolphin Group by the family of Haughey and now operates as a maritime research vessel

===Esat Digifone===
Desmond was an investor in Esat Digifone through his International Investment Underwriters (IIU) vehicle, ultimately owning 20% of the company. It was reported that he made up to £100 million in profit after selling his stake in Esat.

===Football===
Desmond is the largest individual shareholder of the Scottish Premiership football club Celtic F.C. Desmond previously held a stake in Manchester United. He sold the stake to Malcolm Glazer in 2005.

In 2019 Desmond purchased a 25% stake in League of Ireland club Shamrock Rovers.

===Horse racing===
Desmond&#x27;s racehorse Commanche Court won the Triumph Hurdle (1997), the Irish Grand National (2000), the Punchestown Gold Cup (2000), the Lismullen Hurdle (1998), the Christmas Hurdle (1998) and the Spring Juvenile Hurdle (1997).

<text>Black Diamond Cheese Limited is a cheese manufacturing company in Canada.

Black Diamond employs approximately 470 people at its factory in Belleville, Ontario, and its products can be found at most major retailers in Canada. The company has been owned by Parmalat Canada (Lactalis Canada) since 1998. In the United States, the brand is licensed to DCI Cheese in Wisconsin.

== History ==
Black Diamond, initially named Belleville Cheddar Cheese Limited, was established in 1933 by Robert F. Hart, originally for the purpose of exporting aged Canadian cheddar to the British market, thus making it the first brand-name cheddar in Canada.

Black Diamond was purchased by Brooke Bond in 1968. In 1984, Brooke Bond became part of Unilever, which divested Black Diamond to Canada Packers in 1987. Canada Packers then sold the plant to major dairy Ault Foods in 1991, which after several divestments was sold to Parmalat Canada in 1997.

In 2011, Groupe Lactalis acquired Parmalat, therefore making Parmalat Canada a subsidiary of the Toronto-based Lactalis Canada.

<text>The [[educational system]] in [[Finland]] consists of daycare programmes (for babies and toddlers), a one-year &quot;preschool&quot; (age six), and an 11-year compulsory basic comprehensive school (age seven to age eighteen). As of 2024, secondary general academic and vocational education, higher education and adult education are compulsory.

During their nine years of common basic education, students are not selected, tracked, or streamed. There is also inclusive special education within the classroom and instructional efforts to minimize low achievement. After basic education, students must choose to continue with secondary education in either an academic track (&quot;lukio&quot;) or a vocational track (&quot;ammattioppilaitos&quot;), both of which usually take three years and give a qualification to continue to tertiary education. Tertiary education is divided into university and polytechnic (&quot;ammattikorkeakoulu&quot;, also known as &quot;university of applied sciences&quot;) systems. Universities award licentiate- and doctoral-level degrees. Formerly, only university graduates could obtain higher (postgraduate) degrees, however, since the implementation of the Bologna process, all bachelor&#x27;s degree holders can now qualify for further academic studies. There are 17 universities and 27 universities of applied sciences in the country.

The United Nations Development Programme derived an Education Index, a reflection of mean years of schooling of adults and expected years of schooling of children, that placed Finland fourth in the world as of 2019.

Finland has consistently ranked high in the PISA study, which compares national educational systems internationally, although in the recent years Finland has been displaced from the very top. In the 2012 study, Finland ranked sixth in reading, twelfth in mathematics and fifth in science, while back in the 2003 study Finland was first in both science and reading and second in mathematics. Finland&#x27;s tertiary Education has moreover been ranked first by the World Economic Forum.

On the other hand, domestically a decline in the learning outcomes has long been pointed out, and in 2023, Ministry of Education and Culture published a report called bildung review, in which it admitted that the exceptionally rapid drop in the reading and mathematics proficiency has been observed.

In another international assessment called TIMSS, the results of Finland has constantly been mediocre.

While celebrated for its overall success, Finland had a gender gap on the 2012 PISA reading standards identified in a 2015 Brookings Institution report, but this can be put down to many factors such as the choice of the field of work into which each gender goes. The performance of 15-year-old boys then was not significantly different from OECD averages and was 0.66 of a standard deviation behind that of girls the same age.

The governments of Jyrki Katainen, Alexander Stubb and Juha Sipilä cut education funds in Finland over 2011–2018 by a total of €1.5 billion. The number of university and college employees was cut by more than 7500.

==History==

Literacy is a key part of Lutheranism, the state and majority religion of Finland, as Christians are supposed to be able to read the Bible in their native language. Bishop Mikael Agricola studied under Martin Luther and translated the New Testament to Finnish in 1548. The first university in Finland (Royal Academy of Turku) was founded in 1640. Literacy reached over 50% in the late 18th century and 80–90% in the mid-19th century. Where there were no schools in a municipality, reading was taught in traveling schools (&quot;kiertokoulu&quot;). Confirmation, a rite of transition to adulthood, is only permissible for the literate, and enables e.g. entrance into marriage. Official statistics are available from 1880, when literacy was 97.6%. The early system under Swedish rule was in Swedish and consisted of a basic &quot;pedagogio&quot; for teaching reading and writing, a trivial school teaching grammar, Latin, Greek, rhetoric and dialectics, a gymnasium preparing for university, and the university. In the 19th century, the system evolved into what was later known as &quot;kansakoulu&quot; (&quot;people&#x27;s school&quot;) and &quot;oppikoulu&quot; (&quot;learning school&quot;), including high school (&quot;lukio&quot;), followed by university. In mid-19th century, Finnish became an official language, and gradually replaced Swedish as the schooling language. In 1898, everyone was given the right to attend &quot;kansakoulu&quot;. Attendance reached 50% in 1911 and became mandatory in 1921; municipalities were obliged to provide the schooling. Free school lunches became mandatory in 1948. &quot;Oppikoulu&quot;, entered at the age of 10, was still optional and entrance was competitive. Since it was the only way to university education and entrance was heavily affected by the status and choices of parents, it severely limited the opportunities of the less-well off. Working-class people would often complete only the &quot;kansakoulu&quot; and enter the workforce. This system was phased out in 1972–1977 in favor of the modern system where grades 1–9 are mandatory. After the age of 15, the system bifurcates into academic (&quot;lukio&quot;) and vocational tracks (&quot;ammattioppilaitos&quot;) both at the secondary and tertiary levels. Recently, it became formally possible to enter tertiary education with a vocational degree, although this is practically difficult as the vocational study plan does not prepare the student for the university entrance exams.

== Early childhood education ==
In Finland, high class daycare and nursery-kindergarten are considered critical for developing the cooperation and communication skills important to prepare young children for lifelong education, as well as formal learning of reading and mathematics. This preparatory period lasts until the age of 7. Finnish early childhood education emphasizes respect for each child&#x27;s individuality and chance for each child to develop as a unique person. Finnish early educators also guide children in the development of social and interactive skills, encourage them to pay attention to other people&#x27;s needs and interests, &quot;to care about others&quot;, and to have a positive attitude toward other people, other cultures, and different environments. The purpose of gradually providing opportunities for increased independence is to enable all children to take care of themselves as &quot;becoming adults, to be capable of making responsible decisions, to participate productively in society as an active citizen, and to take care of other people who will need his (or her) help.&quot;
To foster a culture of reading, parents of newborn babies are given three books - one for each parent, and a baby book for the child - as part of the &quot;maternity package.&quot; According to Finnish child development specialist Eeva Hujala, &quot;Early education is the first and most critical stage of lifelong learning. Neurological research has shown that 90% of brain growth occurs during the first five years of life, and 85% of the nerve paths develop before starting school (NB: at the age of seven in Finland).&quot; &quot;Care&quot; in this context is synonymous with upbringing and is seen as a cooperative endeavor between parents and society to prepare children physically (eating properly, keeping clean) and mentally (communication, social awareness, empathy, and self-reflection) before beginning more formal learning at age seven. The idea is that before seven they learn best through play, so by the time they finally get to school they are keen to start learning.

Finland has had access to free universal daycare for children aged eight months to five years in place since 1990, and a year of &quot;preschool/kindergarten&quot; at age six since 1996. &quot;Daycare&quot; includes both full-day childcare centers and municipal playgrounds with adult supervision where parents can accompany the child. Municipalities also pay mothers who wish to do so to remain at home and provide &quot;home daycare&quot; for the first three years. In some cases this includes occasional visits from a careworker to see that the environment is appropriate. The ratio of adults to children in local municipal childcare centers (either private but subsidized by local municipalities or paid for by municipalities with the help of grants from the central government) is, for children three years old and under: three adults (one teacher and two nurses) for every 12 pupils (or one-to-four); and, for children age three to six: three adults (one teacher and two nurses) for every 20 children (or circa one-to-seven). Payment, where applicable, is scaled to family income and ranges from free to about 200 euros a month maximum. According to Pepa Ódena in these centers, &quot;You are not &quot;taught&quot;, you learn. The children learn through playing. This philosophy is put into practice in all the schools we visited, in what the teachers say, and in all that one sees.&quot;

Early childhood education is not mandatory in Finland, but is used by almost everyone. &quot;We see it as the right of the child to have daycare and preschool,&quot; explained Eeva Penttilä, of Helsinki&#x27;s Education Department. &quot;It&#x27;s not a place where you dump your child when you&#x27;re working. It&#x27;s a place for your child to play and learn and make friends. Good parents put their children in daycare. It&#x27;s not related to socio-economic class.&quot;

The focus for kindergarten students is to &quot;learn how to learn&quot;, Ms. Penttilä said. Instead of formal instruction in reading and math there are lessons on nature, animals, and the &quot;circle of life&quot; and a focus on materials- based learning. It is strongly believed that when children develop learning to learn as a life skill and see the real life applications of the knowledge they gather, they will become lifelong learners.

== Basic comprehensive education ==

The compulsory educational system in Finland consists of a nine-year comprehensive school from 1st to 9th grade, (Finnish peruskoulu, Swedish grundskola, &quot;basic school&quot;), and with new legislation, the compulsory education was expanded to ages of 7 to 18 and to include upper secondary school (Finnish lukio, Swedish gymnasium) or vocational school (Finnish ammattikoulu, Swedish yrkesskola, &quot;profession school&quot;). (Homeschooling is allowed, but rare). There are no &quot;gifted&quot; programs, and the more advanced children are expected to help those who are slower to catch on.

In most countries, the term &quot;comprehensive school&quot; is used to refer to comprehensive schools attended after primary school, and up to 12th and 13th grade in some countries, but in Finland this English term is used to include primary school, i.e. it is used to refer to all of the grades 1 to 9 (and not higher grades). One can of course also describe the Finnish grades 1 to 6 in English as being comprehensive schools, but this is unnecessary and confusing because primary schools have always been comprehensive in almost all countries, including Finland. In addition, it is best to not try to translate the Finnish term &quot;peruskoulu&quot; with a single term in English. In order to avoid confusion in English, it is best to describe the Finnish compulsory education system as consisting of 6-year primary schools, called &quot;alakoulu&quot; or &quot;ala-aste&quot; in Finnish, followed by comprehensive 3-year middle schools, called &quot;yläkoulu&quot; or &quot;yläaste&quot; in Finnish. Although this division of the peruskoulu into two parts was officially discontinued, it is still very much alive — the distinction is made in everyday speech, the teachers&#x27; training and classification and teaching, and even in most school buildings. In addition, the use of two different terms for grades 1–6 and 7–9 is easier to understand for people from most other countries, most of which do not have a single term for primary and middle schools. On the contrary, middle schools and high schools are usually included in the term secondary education in English, which is why the use of this term in English is often confusing for Finns. (The Finnish direct translation &quot;toisen asteen koulutus/oppilaitos&quot; only refers to schools after 9th grade, i.e. high schools, vocational schools, etc).

Schools up to the university level are almost exclusively funded and administered by the municipalities of Finland (local government). There are few private schools. The founding of a new private comprehensive school requires a decision by the Council of State. When founded, private schools are given a state grant comparable to that given to a municipal school of the same size. However, even in private schools, the use of tuition fees is strictly prohibited, and selective admission is prohibited, as well: private schools must admit all its pupils on the same basis as the corresponding municipal school. In addition, private schools are required to give their students all the education and social benefits that are offered to the students of municipal schools. Because of this, existing private schools are mostly faith-based or Waldorf schools, which are comprehensive by definition.

Teachers, who are fully unionized, follow state curriculum guidelines but are accorded a great deal of autonomy as to methods of instruction and are even allowed to choose their own textbooks.

Classes are small, seldom more than twenty pupils. From the outset pupils are expected to learn two languages in addition to the language of the school (usually Finnish or Swedish), and students in grades one through nine spend from four to eleven periods each week taking classes in art, music, cooking, carpentry, metalwork, and textiles. Small classes, insisted upon by the teachers&#x27; union, appear to be associated with student achievement, especially in science. Inside the school, the atmosphere is relaxed and informal, and the buildings are so clean that students often wear socks and no shoes. Outdoor activities are stressed, even in the coldest weather; and homework is minimal to leave room for extra-curricular activities. In addition to taking music in school, for example, many students attend the numerous state-subsidized specialized music schools after class where for a small fee they learn to play an instrument as a hobby and study basic solfège and music theory using methods originated in Hungary by Kodály and further developed by the Hungarian-born Finn Csaba Szilvay and others.

Reading for pleasure is actively encouraged (Finland publishes more children&#x27;s books than any other country). Television stations show foreign programs in the original languages with subtitles, so that in Finland children even read while watching TV.

During the first years of comprehensive school, grading may be limited to verbal assessments rather than formal grades. The start of numerical grading is decided locally. Most commonly, pupils are issued a report card twice a year: at the ends of the autumn and spring terms. There are no high-stakes tests.

Grades are awarded on a scale from 4 to 10. In individual exams, but not on school year report or basic education certificate, it is also possible to divide the scale further with &#x27;½&#x27;, which represents a half grade, and &#x27;+&#x27; and &#x27;–&#x27;, which represent one-fourth a grade better or worse. For example, the order is &quot;9 &lt; 9+ &lt; 9½ &lt; 10– &lt; 10. The grade &#x27;10+&#x27; can also be awarded for a perfect performance with extra effort by the student.

If a comprehensive school pupil receives a grade of 4 for a particular subject at the end of the spring term, they must show that they have improved in the subject by sitting a separate examination at the end of summer term. If the pupil receives multiple failing grades, they may have to repeat the entire year, though it is considered far preferable to provide a struggling student with extra help and tutoring. In the rare case where a student needs to repeat, the decision is made by the teachers and the headmaster after interviewing the pupil and the parents.

Comprehensive school students enjoy a number of social entitlements, such as school health care and a free lunch every day, which covers about a third of the daily nutritional need. In addition, pupils are entitled to receive free books and materials and free school trips, or even housing in the event that they have a long or arduous trip to school.

== Upper secondary education ==

Upper secondary education begins at 15 or 16 and lasts three to four years (roughly corresponding to the last two years of American high school plus what in the USA would be a two-year Community or Junior College). It used to be optional, but has since become compulsory since September 2021. Finnish upper secondary students may choose whether to undergo occupational training to develop vocational competence and/or to prepare them for a polytechnic institute or to enter an academic upper school focusing on preparation for university studies and post-graduate professional degrees in fields such as law, medicine, science, education, and the humanities. Admissions to academic upper schools are based on GPA, and in some cases academic tests and interviews. For example, during the year 2007, 51% of the age group were enrolled in the academic upper school.

The system, however, is not rigid and vocational school graduates may formally qualify for a university of applied sciences or, in some cases, university education; conversely, academic secondary school graduates may enroll in vocational education programs. It is also possible to attend both vocational and academic secondary schools at the same time. Tuition is free, and vocational and academic students are entitled to school health care, a free lunch, books and a transport to the school.

Upon graduation, vocational school graduates receive a vocational school certificate. Academic upper secondary school graduates receive both secondary school certification and undergo a nationally graded matriculation examination (Finnish: &quot;Ylioppilastutkinto&quot;). This was originally the entrance examination to the University of Helsinki, and its high prestige survives to this day. Students in special programs may receive a vocational school certificate and take the matriculation examination (&quot;kaksoistutkinto&quot;) or all of the three certifications (&quot;kolmoistutkinto&quot;). Approximately 83% of the upper academic school students, or 42% of the age group, complete the matriculation examination.

Polytechnic institutes require school certification for admission, whereas the matriculation examination is more important in university admissions. However, some tertiary education programs have their own admission examinations, and many use a mixture of both.

=== Advanced curricula in the upper academic school ===
In relation to mathematics, the second national language and foreign languages, a student can choose to study a curriculum from different levels of difficulty. Students choose their relevant levels at the beginning of school, when selecting appropriate courses, and at the end of school, when registering for the matriculation exam in order to receive the relevant exam paper. These two choices are not directly linked, but students generally keep the level the same for the matriculation exam. One common exception to this rule of thumb occurs when a student has barely completed a higher level course and is unsure of their performance in the matriculation exam. In those cases, a student may elect to take an easier exam.

In mathematics, the advanced level is in practice a prerequisite for the more competitive university science programs, such as those of the universities of technology, other university mathematical science programs, and medicine. In mathematics, 20% of the matriculation examinees take the advanced level. The nationwide matriculation exam together with entirely percentile-based grading provides an easy way to objectively classify each student based on their mathematical ability, regardless of the year when the exam was taken. For example, assuming that the best mathematical students are selected first to the upper academic school and then to the advanced mathematics curriculum, the students achieving laudatur would comprise the mathematically best 0.4% of the age group, comparable to 800 SAT mathematics section. The percentile equality does not, however, mean that the absolute level of a laudatur student in the advanced mathematics in Finland is equal to that of an 800 SAT student in the US, due to differences in the mean quality of the population.

== Teachers ==

Both primary and secondary teachers must have a master&#x27;s degree to qualify. Teaching is a respected profession and entrance to university programs is highly competitive. A prospective teacher must have very good grades and must combat fierce opposition in order to become a teacher. Only about 10% of applicants to certain programs are successful.

== Tertiary education ==


There are two sectors in the tertiary education: traditional universities (&quot;yliopisto&quot;, &quot;universitet&quot;) and universities of applied sciences (&quot;ammattikorkeakoulu&quot;, &quot;yrkeshögskola&quot;, or &quot;AMK&quot;/&quot;YH&quot; for short). Admissions are based on the high school final GPA, the high school final exam (the &quot;abitur&quot;), and the university entrance examinations. The selection process is fully transparent, merit-based, and objective; there are no application essays, no human factor in selection, no underrepresented minority support (except for preset quotas for Swedish speakers), and no weight on extracurricular activities. Moreover, the entrance examinations are rarely long multiple-choice exams, and instead consist of a smaller number of longer and more complicated questions that are supposed to test more than memorization and quick mechanical problem solving. Therefore, the selection process is very different from many other countries.

The focus for universities is research in science, and they give theoretical education. In many programs graduating with a master&#x27;s degree is expected, with no separate admissions process between Bachelor and master&#x27;s degrees. The universities of applied sciences focus more on responding to the needs of the world of work and they engage in industry development projects. The nature of research is more practical and theories are applied to advanced problem solving. For example, physicians are university graduates, whereas registered nurses and engineers graduate from universities of applied sciences. (However, universities also award degrees in Nursing Science and Engineering). The vocational schools and universities of applied sciences are governed by municipalities, or, in special cases, by private entities. (As an exception to the rule, the Police College is governed by the Ministry of the Interior). All Finnish universities, on the other hand, were owned by the state until 2010, after which they have been separated from the state into foundations or corporations under public law. A bachelor&#x27;s degree takes about three–four years. Depending on the programme, this may be the point of graduation, but it is usually only an intermediate step towards the master&#x27;s degree. A bachelor&#x27;s degree in a university of applied sciences (a polytechnic degree), on the other hand, takes about 3.5–4.5 years. Polytechnic degrees are generally accepted as equivalent to university degrees.

Graduates from universities and universities of applied sciences are able to continue their studies by applying to master&#x27;s degree programmes in universities or universities of applied sciences. After bachelor&#x27;s degree graduates have completed two years&#x27; work experience in their field, they are qualified to apply for master&#x27;s degree programmes in universities of applied sciences which are work- and research-oriented. Lower university degree graduates are also qualified to apply, but with additional studies. The master&#x27;s degree programme in universities of applied sciences takes two years and can be undertaken in conjunction with regular work. After the master&#x27;s degree, the remaining degrees (Licentiate and Doctor) are available only in universities. All master&#x27;s degrees qualify their recipients for graduate studies at doctoral level.

The equivalence discussed above is only relevant when applying for public sector jobs.

In universities, membership in the students&#x27; union is compulsory. Students&#x27; unions in universities of applied sciences are similarly recognized in the legislation, but membership is voluntary and does not include special university student health care (which is organised and partly financed by the students&#x27; unions). Finnish students are entitled to a student benefit, which may be revoked if there is a persistent lack of progress in the studies.

Some universities provide professional degrees. They have additional requirements in addition to merely completing the studies, such as demonstrations of competence in practice. An example of such a degree is &quot;Lääketieteen lisensiaatti&quot;, &quot;medicine licentiat&quot;, Licentiate of Medicine. A Bachelor of Medicine (&quot;lääketieteen kandidaatti&quot;, &quot;medicine kandidat&quot;) is allowed to conduct clinical work under the supervision of senior medical staff. The Licentiate of Medicine is not equivalent to licentiate&#x27;s degree in other fields, but to a master&#x27;s degree. For this reason, no Licentiate&#x27;s thesis is required unlike in other fields. The equivalent of a Medical Doctor in the U.S. sense is therefore not called &quot;doctor&quot;, but licentiate. The research doctorate, which is equivalent to a PhD in Medicine, is called &quot;Doctor of Medicine&quot; (&quot;lääketieteen tohtori&quot;, &quot;medicine doktorsexamen&quot;).

After the master&#x27;s degree, there are two further post-graduate degrees— an intermediate postgraduate degree, called &quot;Licentiate&quot;, and the doctoral (Doctorate) degree. A Licenciate programme has the same amount of theoretical education as a Doctor, but its dissertation work has fewer requirements. On the other hand, the requirements for a doctoral dissertation are a little bit higher than in other countries.

The most typical Finnish doctoral degree is &quot;Doctor of Philosophy&quot; (&quot;filosofian tohtori&quot;, &quot;filosofie doktorsexamen&quot;). However, universities of technology award the title Doctor of Science (Technology), &quot;tekniikan tohtori&quot;, &quot;teknologie doktorsexamen&quot; and there are several branch-specific titles, e.g., in medicine &quot;lääketieteen tohtori&quot;, &quot;medicine doktorsexamen&quot;, in art &quot;taiteen tohtori&quot;, and in social sciences &quot;valtiotieteen tohtori&quot;, &quot;politices doktorsexamen&quot;.

=== Tuition fees ===
Up until 2017, public universities in Finland did not collect tuition fees. However, since the 1990s there had been plans at government level to introduce tuition fees to students from outside the European Union/EEA. The students&#x27; organisations have opposed those plans.

Since the autumn semester 2017, students from outside the EEA have to pay tuition fees of at least 1,500 euros per year to study in Finland, while students from the EEA continue to study for free. Typical tuition fees for non-European students range from around 6,000 to around 18,000 euros per year depending on the university and programme. The goal of the fees was to &quot;advance these institutions&#x27; opportunities for education export and also expand their funding base&quot;, &quot;putting greater emphasis on educational quality as a competitive factor.&quot;

== Adult education ==
Completing secondary school on a vocational programme with full classes on a three-year curriculum provides a formal qualification for further studies. However, it may prove necessary to obtain post-secondary education before being admitted to a university, as the entrance examinations require a relatively high level of knowledge. Post-secondary education is provided by municipal schools or independent &#x27;adult education centres&#x27;, which can give either vocational education or teaching at comprehensive or upper secondary school levels. It is possible to obtain the matriculation diploma, or to better the comprehensive school grades, in these programmes. A new trade can also be learned by an adult at an adult education centre (&quot;aikuiskoulutuskeskus&quot;, &quot;vuxenutbildningscenter&quot;), for example, if structural change of the economy has made the old trade redundant.

In universities, the &quot;Open University&quot; (, ) programme enables people without student status to enroll in individual university courses. There are no requirements, but there is a modest tuition fee (e.g., 60 euros per course). Universities of applied sciences have their own similar programme (, ). While &quot;Open University&quot; students cannot pursue studies towards a degree, they may, after passing a sufficient number of separately determined courses with a sufficiently high grade point average, be eligible for transfer into an undergraduate degree program. Alternatively, a few institutions offer foreign qualifications, such as the private Helsinki School of Business, which offers the UK-accredited Higher National Diploma, enabling graduates to earn an undergraduate degree after completing a top-up year abroad.

A third branch of adult education is formed by the so-called &quot;vapaa sivistystyö&quot;, the &quot;Free Education&quot;. This is formed by the partially state-funded, independent educational institutes offering diverse courses varying in length and academic level. The purpose of the &quot;Free Education&quot; is not to provide professional or degree-oriented education but to &quot;support the multi-faceted development of personality, the ability to act in the community and to pursue the fulfilment of democracy, equality and diversity in the society.&quot; Historically, the &quot;Free Education&quot; stems from the late 19th century efforts to educate the general populace with little previous academic experience.

The &quot;Free Education&quot; is offered by
* 206 &quot;kansalaisopisto&quot; or &quot;työväenopisto&quot; (Citizens&#x27; or Workers&#x27; Institutes)
* 88 &quot;kansanopisto&quot; (People&#x27;s Institutes)
* 14 Sports&#x27; training centres ()
* 20 Summer universities ()
* 11 Study Centres ()

The most common type of &quot;Free Education&quot; is a &quot;kansalaisopisto&quot;, sometimes called &quot;työväenopisto&quot; for historical reasons. These are mostly evening-type municipal institutions offering language, handicraft and humanities courses. The academic level varies strongly, and many courses do not require any requisite knowledge. The &quot;kansanopistos&quot;, on the other hand, are boarding-schools, often maintained by associations with either a strong ideological or religious mission. Also here, the academic level varies strongly. In all these institutions, the courses carry a modest tuition. The Sports&#x27; training centers are institutions for the professional or semi-professional sportsmen&#x27;s training, while Summer universities and study centers are auxiliary bodies for the O&quot;rganization of&quot; &quot;Free Education&quot;.

==Duties==
The Minister of Education has the responsibility of electronically preserving and distributing public domain works. Finland has millions of public domain works (books, pictures, music and films) and views access to them as a basic human right of access to science and culture.

== Future prospects ==
The ongoing Bologna Process blurs the distinction between vocational and academic qualifications. In some fields, new postgraduate degrees have been introduced. Co-operation between the different systems is rising and some integration will occur (although not without a substantial amount of pressure). This results from not only the Bologna Process but also the goal of Finnish politicians— to educate the vast majority of Finns to a higher degree (ca. 60–70% of each annual cohort enter higher education).

In recent years, a cut in the number of new student places has often been called for by the economic sphere, as well as trade and student unions, because of an ongoing trend of rising academic unemployment, which is interpreted as a result of the steep increase in student places in higher education in the 1990s. In particular, some degrees in universities of applied sciences (&quot;AMK&quot;/&quot;YH&quot;) have suffered inflation. In a reflection of this current belief, the Ministry of Education has recently decreed a nationwide cut of 10% in new student places in universities of applied sciences to be applied starting from 2007 and 2008. It is still largely undecided whether (and when) some of those cuts could be redistributed to areas in need of a more highly educated workforce. In 2001 and 2002, university graduates had a 3.7% unemployment rate, and university of applied sciences graduates had 8%, which is on a par with the general unemployment rate (see the OECD report).
In 2015, under prime minister Juha Sipilä&#x27;s cabinet, the government decided to cut down on university funding by approximately €500 million.

An increase in vocational school student places might be preferred, as a shortage of basic workforce such as plumbers and construction workers is widely acknowledged in Finland. It should also be noted that retiring age groups are bigger than the ones entering higher education in Finland at present and for quite some time into the foreseeable future. If the current number of student places were kept unchanged to the year 2020, for example, Eastern Finland would have enough student places for 103% of the estimated size of the age group 19–21.

=== Higher education system restructuring ===
Due to globalization and increasing competition for diminishing younger age groups, system-wide restructuring has been called for by the Ministry of Education. Since 2006, all institutions of higher education have been sharing methods of cooperation. The total number of institutions is expected to drop significantly within 10–15 years.

The process within universities began with merger of the University of Kuopio and the University of Joensuu into the University of Eastern Finland in 2010. In Helsinki, three local universities, namely Helsinki University of Technology, Helsinki School of Economics and University of Art and Design Helsinki, merged to a new Aalto University on 1 August 2009. Also several universities of applied sciences have announced mergers (such as Haaga and Helia, which merged into Haaga-Helia in 2007).

New methods of cooperation such as consortia and federations have been introduced within universities (e.g., University of Turku and Turku School of Economics Consortium). Partnerships between traditional universities and universities of applied sciences are also developing (e.g., the University of Kuopio and Savonia University of Applied Sciences formed the Northern Savonia Higher Education Consortium). In general, such system-wide change closely follows the pattern established in Central Europe, the United States, Spain and Hungary.

==National Curriculum Framework 2016==

Commencing in the 2016–2017 academic year, Finland will begin implementing educational reform that will mandate that phenomenon-based learning be introduced alongside traditional subject-based instruction. As part of a new &quot;National Curriculum Framework&quot;, it will apply to all basic schools for students aged 7–16 years old. Finnish schools have used this form of instruction since the 1980s, but it was not previously mandatory. It is anticipated that educators around the world will be studying this development as Finland&#x27;s educational system is considered to be a model of success by many. This shift coincides with other changes that are encouraging development of 21st century skills such as collaboration, communication, creativity, and critical thinking.

== Media and technology ==
In 2011, documentary filmmaker, Bob Compton, and Harvard researcher, Tony Wagner, researched the Finnish school system and its excellence. The result of their research is the film, &quot;The Finland Phenomenon: Inside the World&#x27;s Most Surprising School System.&quot;

In 2018, the University of Helsinki announced together with the Finnish tech company Reaktor that they would aim to educate 1% (the total of 54,000) of all Finns on the basics of artificial intelligence. The organizations said they want to make Finland &quot;the world&#x27;s most educated country in the field of artificial intelligence.&quot; The course is freely accessible to anyone anywhere online and has already garnered over 220,000 sign-ups.

== Languages ==
One of the competitive advantages in Finland has been their ability in foreign languages. All students learn at least two languages in addition to their mother tongue, mainly English and obligatory Finnish or Swedish, up to high school. A citizens&#x27; initiative to remove obligatory Swedish from education reached parliament in 2014, but failed to pass. Despite being a mandatory part of the national curriculum, more than half of all Finns consider themselves to be unable to understand Swedish at an elementary or near elementary level. Over half of Finns report that Swedish has been completely or almost completely useless for them in their personal lives.

<doc id="375172" wikidata="Q1432285" url="?curid=375172" title="Parmalat">
<text>Parmalat S.p.A. is an Italian dairy and food corporation which is a subsidiary of French multinational company Lactalis. It was founded by Calisto Tanzi in 1961.

Having become the leading global company in the production of long-life milk using ultra-high-temperature processing, the company collapsed in 2003 with €14bn ($20bn; £13bn) of debt in what remains Europe&#x27;s biggest bankruptcy. Since 2011, it has been a subsidiary of French group Lactalis (with fuller control since 2019). Today, Parmalat is a company with a global presence, having operations in Europe, North America, South America, Australia, China, and South Africa.

Still specializing in UHT milk and milk derivatives (varieties of yogurt, cheese, butter, ice cream, etc.), the group also sells fruit juices distributed under the brand names Lactis, Santal, Malù, and Kyr. Its worldwide operations include almost 140 production centres and some 16,000 employees, with 5,000 Italian dairy farms supplying it. Its shares were listed on the Borsa Italiana.

== Early history (1961–2002) ==
In 1961, Calisto Tanzi, a 22-year-old college dropout, opened a small pasteurisation plant in Parma. Two decades later, the company had grown into a multinational corporation diversifying into milk, dairy, beverage, bakery, and other product lines in the 1980s, becoming listed on the Milan stock exchange in 1990, and expanding further in the 1990s. By 22 April 2002, Parmalat&#x27;s share price had reached a record and the company was valued at €3.7bn, employing over 30,000 people in 30 countries. The company began to expand and had listed in its portfolio amongst other things: an expansion in the space of a decade from six countries into ownership of ParmaTour (a travel group) and Odeon TV, Parma F.C., Paulista Futebol Clube and S.E. Palmeiras.

In the early 1980s, Parmalat was the title sponsor of the Brabham Formula 1 team, and its logotype, prominently displayed on the vehicles, became strongly associated with the team. The company continued as a minor sponsor of other Formula 1 teams in the late 1990s.

== Financial fraud (2002–2005) ==

In 1997, Parmalat expanded into financial markets, financing several international acquisitions, especially in the Western Hemisphere, with debt. But by 2001, many of the new divisions were producing losses, and the company financing shifted largely to the use of derivatives, apparently at least in part with the intention of hiding the extent of its losses and debt. In February 2003, chief financial officer Fausto Tonna unexpectedly announced a new €300 million bond issue. This came as a surprise both to the markets and to the CEO, Calisto Tanzi. Tanzi forced Tonna to resign and replaced him with Alberto Ferraris. According to an interview he later gave &quot;Time&quot; magazine, Ferraris was surprised to discover that, though now CFO, he still did not have access to some of the corporate books, which were being handled by chief accounting officer Luciano Del Soldato. He began making some inquiries and began to suspect that the company&#x27;s total debt was more than double that on the balance sheet.

The plan for a €300 million fundraising effort was dropped in September 2003, and the company&#x27;s shares depreciated significantly as a result of the publicised concerns raised over transactions with mutual fund Epicurum, a Cayman-based company linked to Parmalat by November. Ferraris resigned less than a week after the public fall-out and was replaced by Del Soldato. Del Soldato resigned the next month, unable to get cash from Epicurum fund, needed to pay debts and make bond payments totalling at least €150 million. Bonlat was a subsidiary of Parmalat set up in the Cayman Islands. Bonlat&#x27;s bank, Bank of America, then released a document showing €3.95 billion in Parmalat&#x27;s bank account as a forgery. Tanzi resigned as chairman and CEO. Hundreds of thousands of investors lost their money and would never recover it.

Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi changed bankruptcy laws by decree to allow a company to seek accelerated protection from creditors, by giving extraordinary powers to a government-appointment administrator (&quot;commissario&quot;). Enrico Bondi was named &quot;commissario&quot;.

Calisto Tanzi was detained hours after the firm was declared officially insolvent in late December and admitted that there was a hole of €8 billion in Parmalat&#x27;s accounts, but denied any cover-up. The arrest of five other executives followed. The auditors of the administration eventually determined that the debts amounted to €14.3 billion, which was almost eight times the sum originally stated. Several of the company&#x27;s subsidiaries subsequently went insolvent, including its Brazilian, Argentinian and American operations and its football club in Parma.

Tanzi was eventually charged with financial fraud and money laundering. Among the questionable accounting practices used by Parmalat were selling itself credit-linked notes, in effect placing a bet on its own creditworthiness to conjure up an asset out of thin air. After his arrest, Tanzi reportedly admitted during questioning at Milan&#x27;s San Vittore prison that he diverted funds from Parmalat into Parmatour and elsewhere. The family football and tourism enterprises were financial disasters as well, as Tanzi attempted to rival Berlusconi by buying Odeon TV, only to sell it at a loss of about €45 million. Tanzi was sentenced to 10 years in prison for fraud relating to the collapse of the dairy group. The other seven defendants, including executives and bankers, were acquitted. Another eight defendants settled out of court in September 2008. New leadership at Parmalat began investigating and suing Bank of America, Deloitte and Grant Thornton International – the bank and auditing firms that were alleged to have helped in perpetuing the fraud of earlier management at Parmalat.

In 2007, Deloitte settled on paying $149M to Parmalat. Bank of America, Parmalat&#x27;s bank in many Special-purpose entities, settled for $100M payment to Parmalat in 2009. Grant Thornton International, Parmalat&#x27;s auditing company, settled after repeated lawsuits for $4.4M with Parmalat. The new management at Parmalat recovered about $700M in payments from the banks and auditing firms it sued for negligence and aiding in the fraud of former Parmalat leadership.

== Modern history ==

In 2005, Vicenzi bought from Parmalat the unprofitable bakery plant of Nusco, opened in 1984 for political reasons because it was the home town of Democrazia Cristiana chieftain Ciriaco De Mita.

By 2011, Parmalat had grown cash to €1.5 billion. In March 2011, the French multinational Lactalis, which already owns the Galbani, Invernizzi, Locatelli and Cademartori brands in Italy and is controlled by the Besnier family, began to acquire Parmalat shares. Lactalis quickly purchased nearly 30% of the company on the open market and in July 2011, succeeded in its €2.5 billion takeover offer, reaching a control of 80% shares at €2.6 per share.

In 2015, revenues reached €6.42 billion and EBITDA €444.5 million. On 27 December 2016, the French group, which controls 87.74% of Parmalat, activated the delisting procedure trying to withdraw it from the stock exchange listing. Lactalis prepared to delist Parmalat in 2016, with a buyout offer at €2.8 per share to acquire the remaining 12%, then raised to €3 but eventually failed due to opposition by hedge fund Amber and others. In December 2018, Lactalis was thought to have almost reached 95% shares at an open market price of around €2.85/share and to be about to launch a new takeover and delisting offer. Lactalis acquired 7% of the shares from Amber and other shareholders which had opposed the 2016 takeover, and confirmed the delisting for March 2019.

Lactalis moved all strategic activities to France and gradually wound down operations in Italy. In 2019, the future of the historical factory in Rome was also in doubt.

<text>Eugene Field Sr. (September 2, 1850 – November 4, 1895) was an American writer, best known for his children&#x27;s poetry and humorous essays. He was known as the &quot;poet of childhood&quot;.

==Early life and education==

Field was born in St. Louis, Missouri at 634 S. Broadway where today his boyhood home is open to the public as The Eugene Field House and St. Louis Toy Museum. After the death of his mother in 1856, he was raised by an aunt, Mary Field French, in Amherst, Massachusetts.

Field&#x27;s father, attorney Roswell Martin Field, was the lawyer who filed Dred Scott&#x27;s case.

Field attended Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts. His father died when Eugene turned 19, and he subsequently dropped out of Williams after eight months. He then went to Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois, but dropped out after a year, followed by the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri, where his brother Roswell was also attending. Field was not a serious student and spent much of his time at school playing practical jokes. He led raids on the president&#x27;s wine cellar, painted the president&#x27;s house school colors, and fired the school&#x27;s landmark cannons at midnight. Field tried acting, studied law with little success, and also wrote for the student newspaper. He then set off for a trip through Europe but returned to the United States six months later, penniless.

==Career==

Field then set to work as a journalist for the &quot;St. Joseph Gazette&quot; in Saint Joseph, Missouri, in 1875. That same year he married Julia Comstock, with whom he had eight children. For the rest of his life he arranged for all the money he earned to be sent to his wife, saying that he had no head for money himself.

Field soon rose to city editor of the &quot;Gazette&quot;.

He became known for his light, humorous articles written in a gossipy style, some of which were reprinted by other newspapers around the country. It was during this time that he wrote the famous poem &quot;Lovers Lane&quot; about a street in St. Joseph, Missouri.

From 1876 through 1880, Field lived in St. Louis, first as an editorial writer for the &quot;Morning Journal&quot; and subsequently for the &quot;Times-Journal&quot;. After a brief stint as managing editor of the &quot;Kansas City Times&quot;, he worked for two years as editor of the Denver &quot;Tribune&quot;.

In 1883, Field moved to Chicago where he wrote a humorous newspaper column called &quot;Sharps and Flats&quot; for the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot;. His home in Chicago was near the intersection of N. Clarendon and W. Hutchinson in the neighborhood now known as Buena Park.

The &quot;Sharps and Flats&quot; column ran in the newspaper&#x27;s morning edition. In it, Field made quips about issues and personalities of the day, especially in the arts and literature. A pet subject was the intellectual greatness of Chicago, especially compared to Boston. In April 1887, Field wrote, &quot;While Chicago is humping herself in the interests of literature, art and the sciences, vain old Boston is frivoling away her precious time in an attempted renaissance of the cod fisheries.&quot; Also that year, Chicago&#x27;s National League baseball club sold future baseball Hall of Famer Mike &quot;King&quot; Kelly to Boston, and coincidentally soon after, famous Boston poet and diplomat James Russell Lowell made a speaking tour of Chicago. &quot;Chicago feels a special interest in Mr. Lowell at this particular time because he is perhaps the foremost representative of the enterprising and opulent community which within the last week has secured the services of one of Chicago&#x27;s honored sons for the base-ball season of 1887,&quot; Field wrote. &quot;The fact that Boston has come to Chicago for the captain of her baseball nine has reinvigorated the bonds of affection between the metropolis of the Bay state [sic] and the metropolis of the mighty west; the truth of this will appear in the mighty welcome which our public will give Mr. Lowell next Tuesday.&quot;
Four months later, upon Kelly&#x27;s first return to Chicago as a player for Boston, Field would speak to &quot;Col. Samuel J. Bosbyshell, the Prairie avenue millionaire.&quot; Bosbyshell said, &quot;I like Mr. Kelly better than I do Lowell. When Lowell was here I had him out to the house to a $3,500 dinner, and do what I could, I couldn&#x27;t get him waked up. He didn&#x27;t seem to want to talk about anything but literature. Now, when I&#x27;m out in society I make it a point never to talk shop, and Lowell&#x27;s peculiarity mortified me. If it hadn&#x27;t been for [Chicago humorist] Frank Lincoln, with his imitations and funny stories, the dinner would have been a stupid affair. But Kelly is another kind of man; he is more versatile than Lowell. I don&#x27;t believe he mentioned books once during the four hours we sat at dinner last Saturday evening. Nor did he confine his conversation to base-ball topics; he is deeply versed in turf lore, and he talked most entertainingly of the prominent race horses he was acquainted with and of the leading jockeys he has met.&quot;

Field first started publishing poetry in 1879, when his poem &quot;Christmas Treasures&quot; appeared in &quot;A Little Book of Western Verse&quot;. Over a dozen volumes of poetry followed and he became well known for his light-hearted poems for children, among the most famous of which are &quot;Wynken, Blynken, and Nod&quot; and &quot;The Duel&quot; (which is perhaps better known as &quot;The Gingham Dog and the Calico Cat&quot;). Equally famous is his poem about the death of a child, &quot;Little Boy Blue&quot;. Field also published a number of short stories, including &quot;The Holy Cross&quot; and &quot;Daniel and the Devil.&quot;
The volume, &quot;The Love Affairs of a Bibliomaniac,&quot; was published posthumously with an introduction by Field&#x27;s brother, Roswell Martin Field in 1896.

Field died in Chicago of a heart attack at the age of 45. He is buried at the Church of the Holy Comforter in Kenilworth, Illinois. Slason Thompson&#x27;s 1901 biography of Field states that he was originally buried in Graceland Cemetery in Chicago, but his son-in-law, Senior Warden of the Church of the Holy Comforter, had him reinterred on March 7, 1926.

==Legacy==

Several of his poems were set to music with commercial success by composers such as Isabel Stewart North, Gertrude Ross, and Ella May Dunning Smith. Many of his works were accompanied by paintings from Maxfield Parrish. 

His childhood home in St. Louis is now a museum. The Eugene Field House contains many of Field&#x27;s mementos, including original manuscripts, books, furniture, personal effects, and some of the toys that inspired his poems.

Field has his own star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame.

In 2016, Field was inducted into the Chicago Literary Hall of Fame.

As a memorial to Field, a statue of the Dream Lady from his poem &quot;Rock-a-by-Lady&quot; was erected in 1922 at the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago. There is also a park and fieldhouse named in his honor in Chicago&#x27;s Albany Park neighborhood. In nearby Oak Park, Illinois, another park is named in his honor; a sign there offers a brief biography. A statue of Wynken, Blynken and Nod adorns Washington Park, near Field&#x27;s Denver home. Another statue of Wynken, Blynken and Nod sits in the center of the town square (called &quot;the green&quot; by locals) in Wellsboro, Pa.

Numerous elementary schools throughout the Midwest are named for him, e.g. Eugene Field Elementary School in Chicago, Illinois; Wheeling, Illinois; Rock Island, Illinois; Elmhurst, Illinois; Normal, Illinois; Park Ridge, Illinois; Maryville, Missouri; St. Joseph, Missouri; Hannibal, Missouri; Columbia, Missouri; Mexico, Missouri; Neosho, Missouri; Poplar Bluff, Missouri; Springfield, Missouri; Webb City, Missouri; Manhattan, Kansas; Ottawa, Kansas; Minneapolis, Minnesota; and formerly in Muncie, Indiana (closed in 1973).

Other schools named after Field are located in Littleton, Colorado; Mitchell, South Dakota;Sioux Falls, South Dakota; Tulsa, Oklahoma; Altus, Oklahoma; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Hugo, Oklahoma; Beaumont, Texas; Houston, Texas; Albuquerque, New Mexico; Mesa, Arizona; Pasadena, California; San Diego, California; and Silverton, Oregon. 

One of the branches of the Denver Public Library near Field&#x27;s Denver home is named after him, as is an apartment building in Denver&#x27;s Poet&#x27;s Row. A dormitory in the Orchard Hill residential area at the University of Massachusetts Amherst also bears Field&#x27;s name.

Before his death, Field wrote and published an anonymous work about a 12-year-old boy being seduced by a woman in her 30s. It was titled &quot;Only a Boy&quot;. In the 1920s, American drama critic and magazine editor George Jean Nathan recalled it as a popular forbidden work among those coming of age at the turn of the century, along with &quot;Fanny Hill&quot; and &quot;Green Girls of Paris&quot;. It was published by Grove Press in 1968 with the real author&#x27;s name.

<text>On 4 January 1989, two Grumman F-14 Tomcats of the United States Navy shot down two Libyan-operated Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23 Floggers which the American aircrews believed were attempting to engage and attack them, as had happened eight years prior during the 1981 Gulf of Sidra incident. The engagement took place over the Mediterranean Sea, about north of Tobruk, Libya.

==Background==
In 1973, Libya claimed much of the Gulf of Sidra (south of Latitude 31° 30′) as its territorial waters and subsequently declared a &quot;line of death&quot;, the crossing of which would invite a military response. The United States did not recognize Libya&#x27;s territorial claims and continued to challenge the line, leading to military hostilities in August 1981 and March 1986. A terrorist attack in Germany which killed two American soldiers and one Turkish civilian on 5 April 1986 was linked to Libya and prompted the U.S. to carry out retaliatory air strikes against targets in Libya ten days later.

Attempts by Libya to obtain weapons of mass destruction were of great concern to U.S. President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s administration since it viewed Libya as a state sponsor of terrorism. Tensions between Libya and the U.S. were running high after the latter accused Libya of building a chemical weapons plant near Rabta in the fall of 1988. During a December 1988 press interview, Reagan indicated the potential for military action to destroy the plant. The possibility of a U.S. attack caused Libya to increase its air defenses around Rabta and its state of military readiness throughout the country.

==Engagement==

On the morning of 4 January 1989, the aircraft carrier was sailing toward the eastern Mediterranean Sea for a scheduled port visit to Haifa, Israel. The carrier was over north of Libya and had aircraft operating roughly north of the country. Aircraft operating from the &quot;Kennedy&quot; included several flights of A-6 Intruders on exercises south of Crete, two pairs of F-14 Tomcats from VF-14 and VF-32 conducting combat air patrols, and an E-2 Hawkeye from VAW-126 providing airborne early warning and control.

The easternmost combat air patrol station was provided by the two F-14s from VF-32 with aircraft call signs &quot;Gypsy 207&quot; (crewed by Commander Joseph Bernard Connelly and Commander Leo F. Enwright in Bureau Number &quot;159610&quot;) and &quot;Gypsy 202&quot; (crewed by Lieutenant Herman C. Cook III and Lieutenant Commander Steven Patrick Collins in Bureau Number &quot;159437&quot;). Although the &quot;Kennedy&quot; battle group was not operating within the contentious Gulf of Sidra and was away from Rabta, the battle group commander believed Libyan concerns over a U.S. attack increased the likelihood of a confrontation. He gave the American air crews a special briefing emphasizing their rules of engagement.

At 11:55 local time, the airborne E-2 detected two Libyan MiG-23 Floggers taking off from Bomba (Al Bumbah) airfield near Tobruk, and observed them heading north toward the battle group. The two F-14s from VF-32 were directed to intercept the MiG-23s, while the F-14s from VF-14 covered the A-6s as they departed to the north. Using their onboard radars, the intercepting F-14s began tracking the MiG-23s when the Libyan aircraft were away, at an altitude of and traveling at . Unlike some previous aerial encounters in which Libyan pilots were instructed to turn back after detecting an F-14&#x27;s radar signal sweep their aircraft, the MiG-23s continued to close on the American fighters with a head-on approach.

As both pairs of aircraft converged, the E-2 and other U.S. eavesdropping assets in the area monitored radio communications between the Libyan aircraft and their ground controllers. The Americans listened to the MiG-23s receiving guidance to intercept the F-14s from ground controllers at a radar station in Bomba. This radar station was one of several activated along the Libyan coast to support the MiG-23s.
At 11:58, the F-14s made a left turn, away from the MiG-23s, to initiate a standard intercept. Seven seconds later, the MiG-23s turned back into the American fighters for another head-on approach and were descending in altitude. At this point, the F-14 aircrews began employing tactics to reduce the effectiveness of the MiG-23s&#x27; radars and the 12-mile-range () AA-7 Apex missiles they were potentially carrying. The American aircraft started descending from to fly lower than the Libyan fighters. The drop in altitude was meant to prevent the MiG-23s from detecting the F-14s by using ocean clutter to confuse their onboard radars. The American pilots executed another left turn away from the Libyan aircraft during the descent. Moments after the F-14s created a 30-degree offset, the MiG-23s turned to place themselves back into a collision course and accelerated to .

The air warfare commander on the &quot;Kennedy&quot; gave the American aircrews the authority to fire if they believed the MiG-23s were hostile. The F-14s turned away from the approaching MiG-23s two more times, and each time, the American aircrews saw the Libyan aircraft turn back toward them for a head-on approach. At 12:00:53, the Radar Intercept Officer (RIO) in the lead F-14, Commander Leo Enwright in &quot;Gypsy 207&quot;, ordered the arming of the AIM-7 Sparrow and AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles on the American fighters, after what he determined was the fifth time the Libyan aircraft turned back toward them.

The American aircrews armed their weapons when the opposing aircraft were less than away, the two groups closing in on each other at a rate of . At a distance of about , the lead F-14 pilot, Commander Joseph Connelly, made a radio call to the carrier group&#x27;s air warfare commander to see if there was any additional information in regard to the MiG-23s. There was no response to his call. At 12:01:20 and at a range of , Enwright fired an AIM-7, surprising Connelly, who did not expect to see a missile accelerate away from their aircraft. The missile failed to track toward its target. At a distance of about , Enwright launched a second AIM-7, but it also failed to hit its target.

The MiG-23s continued to fly directly toward the American fighters at . The F-14s executed a defensive split, where both aircraft made turns in opposite directions. Both Libyan fighters turned left to pursue the second F-14, &quot;Gypsy 202&quot;. Connelly prepared &quot;Gypsy 207&quot; for a right turn to get behind the MiG-23s as they went after the other American fighter. With the MiG-23s pointed directly at them, the crew of &quot;Gypsy 202&quot; fired a third AIM-7 from roughly away and downed one of the Libyan aircraft.

After executing a sharp right turn, &quot;Gypsy 207&quot; gained a position in the rear quadrant of the remaining MiG-23. As the Libyan fighter was turning left and from a distance of , Connelly fired an AIM-9 missile, which downed its target. The second MiG-23 was hit by the AIM-9 at 12:02:36. The F-14s descended to an altitude of several hundred feet and returned at high speed to the carrier group. The Libyan pilots were both seen to successfully eject and parachute into the sea, but it is not known whether the Libyan Air Force was able to successfully recover them.

==Aftermath==

The following day, Libya accused the U.S. of attacking two unarmed reconnaissance planes which were on a routine mission over international waters. Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi called for a United Nations emergency session to take up the incident. The U.S. claimed the American aircrews acted in self-defense due to demonstrations of hostile intent by the Libyan aircraft.

Two days after the engagement, the Pentagon released photographs taken from the videotapes on the F-14s which, according to U.S. naval intelligence analysts, showed the lead MiG-23 armed with two AA-7 Apex missiles and two AA-8 Aphid missiles. The AA-7 can be either a semi-active radar-homing missile or an infrared-homing (heat-seeking) missile, and it can be fired at another aircraft from head-on. The imagery was used to prove the Libyan fighters were armed and helped support the U.S. position that the MiG-23s were hostile.

The intent for the Libyan aircraft on 4 January is not known for certain. Gaddafi could have believed the U.S. was preparing for an attack on the chemical facility in Rabta and ordered his military to see if the aircraft offshore were bombers bound for targets in Libya. The possible reasons for the MiG-23s&#x27; flight profile range from a deliberate attack against the battle group to a radio breakdown with ground controllers leading to the Libyan fighters merging with the F-14s.

Details released three months after the incident revealed that the MiG-23s never turned on their fire control radars, needed to guide their AA-7 missiles at maximum range. The turns by the Libyan pilots prior to the first missile launch by the F-14s were considered too slight to be hostile, according to U.S. House Armed Services Committee chairman Les Aspin. Despite these findings, Aspin said the self-defense claim by the U.S. was still justified due to the continued acceleration of the MiG-23s as they closed the distance with the F-14s and Libya&#x27;s history of firing first.

==Legacy==
===F-14 Tomcat Bureau Numbers &quot;159437&quot;, &quot;159610&quot;===

At the request of the National Air and Space Museum, the U.S. Navy provided Bureau Number (BuNo) &quot;159610&quot; to its Udvar-Hazy location near Dulles International Airport. Although Tomcat BuNo &quot;159610&quot; downed the Libyan MiG-23 as a VF-32 F-14A model Tomcat, it returned from that deployment and was entered into the F-14D re-manufacture program, later serving in a precision strike role as a VF-31 F-14D(R).

<text>Enemy at the Gates (&quot;Stalingrad&quot; in France and &quot;L&#x27;Ennemi aux portes&quot; in Canada) is a 2001 war film directed, co-written, and produced by Jean-Jacques Annaud, based on William Craig&#x27;s 1973 nonfiction book &quot;Enemy at the Gates: The Battle for Stalingrad&quot;, which describes the events surrounding the Battle of Stalingrad in the winter of 1942–1943. The screenplay was written by Annaud and Alain Godard. The film&#x27;s main character is a fictionalized version of Vasily Zaitsev, a sniper and Hero of the Soviet Union during World War II. It includes a snipers&#x27; duel between Zaitsev and a &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; sniper school director, Major Erwin König.

The cast includes Jude Law as Zaitsev, Rachel Weisz as Tania Chernova, and Ed Harris as König, with Joseph Fiennes, Bob Hoskins, Ron Perlman, Eva Mattes, Gabriel Marshall Thomson, and Matthias Habich in supporting roles.

== Plot ==
Vassili Zaitsev, a soldier in the Red Army, is sent to the frontline of the Battle of Stalingrad in 1942. Forced into a suicidal charge without a rifle but with ammunition, he hides among a pile of corpses, while a tank shell incapacitates a car. The occupant, Commissar Danilov, takes cover in the same heap of corpses and finds a rifle. Vassili reveals himself, advising the commissar not to fire until an explosion covers the noise. Danilov gives the rifle to Vassili, who, to the former&#x27;s astonishment, is able to kill five German soldiers in less than a minute.

Nikita Khrushchev demands ideas from his subordinates to improve morale. While the other commissars suggest more severe discipline and terror, Danilov, now a senior lieutenant, recommends giving the troops inspiration. He suggests they should &quot;make examples, but examples to follow,&quot; and recommends Zaitsev for that role. Soon after, Danilov begins publishing heroic tales of Vassili&#x27;s exploits in the army&#x27;s newspaper. Vassili is transferred to the sniper division and becomes friends with Danilov. Both also become romantically interested in Tania Chernova, a private in the local militia. In fear for her safety, Danilov has her transferred to an intelligence unit, ostensibly to make use of her German skills in translating radio intercepts.

With the Soviet snipers taking an increasing toll on the German forces, German Major Erwin König is deployed to kill Vassili and crush Soviet morale. When the Red Army command learns of König&#x27;s mission after he wipes out Vassili&#x27;s sniper unit, they dispatch König&#x27;s former student Koulikov to help Vassili kill him. König, however, outmaneuvers Koulikov and kills him, shaking Vassili&#x27;s spirits. Danilov finds a boy, Sacha Filipov, who volunteers to act as a double agent by passing König false information about Vassili&#x27;s whereabouts in exchange for food. Vassili sets a trap for König and manages to wound him with the help of Tania. During a second attempt, Vassili falls asleep, and his sniper log is stolen by a looting German soldier. The German command takes the log as evidence of Vassili&#x27;s death and plans to send König home, but König does not believe that Vassili is dead.

General Friedrich Paulus confiscates König&#x27;s dog tags to prevent Soviet propaganda from profiting if König is killed and identified. In turn, König gives the general a War Merit Cross that was posthumously awarded to his son, a lieutenant in the 116th Infantry Division who was killed in the early days of the battle. König tells Sacha where he will be next after deducing that the boy is responsible for his being wounded. Tania and Vassili have meanwhile fallen in love. That night, Tania secretly goes to the Soviet barracks and makes love with Vassili. The jealous Danilov disparages Vassili in a letter to his superiors.

König spots Tania and Vassili waiting for him at his next ambush spot, confirming his suspicions about Sacha. He then kills the boy and hangs his body to bait Vassili. Vassili vows to kill König and asks Tania and Danilov to evacuate Sacha&#x27;s mother. Tania is wounded by shrapnel en route to the boats. Thinking she is dead, Danilov regrets his jealousy of Vassili and even his ardor for communist ideals begins to falter. Finding Vassili waiting to ambush König, Danilov puts on a helmet and exposes himself to provoke König into shooting him and revealing his own position. Thinking that he has killed Vassili, König goes to inspect the body only to find himself in the Russian&#x27;s sights. Accepting his fate, König grimly turns to look Vassili in the face before being shot. Two months later, after Stalingrad has been liberated and German forces have surrendered, Vassili finds Tania recovering in a field hospital.

== Cast ==

== Production ==
The filming of &quot;Enemy at the Gates&quot; took place in Germany. The crossing of the Volga River was shot on the Altdöberner See, a man-made lake near the village of Pritzen, in the south of Brandenburg. A derelict factory in the village of Rüdersdorf was used to recreate the ruins of Stalingrad&#x27;s tractor factory. The massive outdoor set of Stalingrad&#x27;s Red Square was built at Krampnitz, near Potsdam. It was a former &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; riding school that had served as a Soviet barracks during the Cold War. Set construction began in October 1999 and took almost five months to complete. The scene at the end with the waving coats is a reference to Sergio Leone.

== Soundtrack ==
The soundtrack to &quot;Enemy at the Gates&quot; was written by James Horner and released on 31 March 2001.
== Reception ==
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 53% approval rating from 139 critics with a weighted average score of 5.70/10. The website&#x27;s consensus says: &quot;Atmospheric and thrilling, &quot;Enemy at the Gates&quot; gets the look and feel of war right. However, the love story seems out of place.&quot; Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating, calculated an average score of 53 out of 100, based on 33 reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Military historian David R. Stone praised the cast and said the film is &quot;a good thing for the study of the Eastern Front during World War II&quot; but criticized its historical inaccuracies and presentation, concluding: &quot;To end on a brighter note, &quot;Enemy at the Gates&quot; has at the very least boosted the number of my students who drop by the office to ask questions about Stalingrad. I only wish it had done a better job of giving them good answers.&quot; For the Society for Military History, historian Roger Reese wrote: &quot;As a work of fictionalized history this movie serves a useful purpose beyond entertainment, that of bringing to the attention of movie-goers in the West the sacrifices Soviet soldiers made in defending their country and defeating Hitler and giving a face to those legions still largely anonymous to us.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three stars out of four and wrote that it &quot;is about two men placed in a situation where they have to try to use their intelligence and skills to kill each other. When Annaud focuses on that, the movie works with rare concentration. The additional plot stuff and the romance are kind of a shame.&quot; &quot;New York&quot;″s Peter Ranier was less kind, declaring: &quot;It&#x27;s as if an obsessed film nut had decided to collect every bad war-film convention on one computer and program it to spit out a script.&quot; Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; admitted the film had faults but said that &quot;any flaws in execution pale against those moments when the film brings history to vital life.&quot;

The film received unenthusiastic reviews in Russia but had good box office in Moscow and Saint Petersburg. Some Red Army Stalingrad veterans were so offended by inaccuracies in the film and how the Red Army was portrayed that on 7 May 2001, shortly after the film premiered in Russia, they expressed their displeasure in the State Duma, demanding a ban of the film but their request was not granted. The film was also received poorly in Germany. Critics stated that it simplified history and glorified war. At the Berlinale film festival, it was booed. Annaud stated afterwards that he would not present another film at Berlinale, calling it a &quot;slaughterhouse&quot; and said that his film received a much better reception elsewhere.

== Historical accuracy ==

As a film inspired by real events, it was dramatized and the plot was fictional in several ways. It contained several inaccuracies, including about Vasily Zaitsev, developments of the war, graphic details, and maps depicting a modern map of Russia, Ukraine, and the Baltic states as independent countries, as well as Switzerland and Turkey being invaded by Nazi Germany. Zaitsev was a senior sergeant () in the 2nd Battalion, 1047th Rifle Regiment, 284th &quot;Tomsk&quot; Rifle Division, during the Battle of Stalingrad. The film uses events from William Craig&#x27;s 1973 nonfiction book &quot;Enemy at the Gates: The Battle for Stalingrad&quot; but is not a direct adaptation. The book by Zaitsev himself &quot;There was no land for us beyond the Volga. Sniper&#x27;s Notes&quot; (), which completely contradicts the point of view presented in Craig&#x27;s book and the film on the events that took place, is not taken into account. Historian Antony Beevor said he believed Zaitsev&#x27;s story to be fictional. There is no documentation about the duel between Zaytsev and Major Erwin König.

The film misrepresents the role of blocking detachments in the Red Army. Although there was Order No. 227 () that became the rallying cry of &quot;Not a step back!&quot; (), machine gunners were not placed behind regular troops with orders to kill anyone who retreated, and they were used only for penal troops. As per Order No. 227, each detachment would have between three and five barrier squads per 200 personnel. At the same time, the film has been accused of understating the role of women. In the film, two women snipers appear but never shoot at anyone, in fact, Soviet women snipers have been credited with killing over 10,000 enemies in combat.

The film&#x27;s first scene shows new Soviet troops, including Zaitsev, arriving at the Stalingrad front, being screamed at, threatened, and in general humiliated by their commanders. They are then transported and locked in crowded boxcars to stop them from deserting. According to military historian Boris Yulin, that was forbidden and is unrealistic, as the soldiers would have then been killed in case of a German air raid or shelling. According to historian Alexey Isaev, who has written several books about the Battle of Stalingrad, blocking detachments were mostly used in Stalingrad as &quot;usual combat regiments&quot; although the film emphasizes the message that &quot;most Soviet soldiers needed a literal gun in the back in order to go into battle&quot;. As there were many cases of heroism, it is argued it was unlikely that Soviet soldiers were motivated only by fear. In regards to the lack of weapons, which happened early in the war and changed by 1942, Isaev said: &quot;There were no unarmed soldiers sent to the attack... What is shown in &quot;Enemy at the Gates&quot; is pure nonsense.&quot;

<text>The Medal of Honour (; MH) is part of the honours system in Hong Kong. It was created in 1997 to replace the British honours system after the transfer of sovereignty to the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the establishment of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The Medal of Honour is the entry level award under the Hong Kong honours system and is awarded for community service in a district or in a particular area for a long period of time. It may also be awarded to civil servants for serving with distinction.

This medal essentially replaced the Order of the British Empire prior to 1 July 1997.

<doc id="375188" wikidata="Q6573351" url="?curid=375188" title="List of Hollywood novels">
<text>This is a list of Hollywood novels i.e., notable fiction about the American film and television industry and associated culture. The Hollywood novel is not to be confused with the Los Angeles novel, which is a novel set in Los Angeles and environs but not overtly about the movie business and its effect on the lives of industry participants and moviegoers. For instance, the works of Paul Beatty, Neal Stephenson&#x27;s &quot;Snow Crash&quot;, and Aldous Huxley&#x27;s &quot;Ape and Essence&quot; are Los Angeles novels but not Hollywood novels; The &quot;Oxford Companion to English Literature&quot; deems Nathanael West&#x27;s &quot;The Day of the Locust&quot; a standard example of the Hollywood novel.

The Hollywood novel genre dates to 1916 and is the &quot;only American regional genre determined by a specific industry.&quot; Hollywood novels portray the entertainment industry as &quot;glitzy, powerful, and often sleazy.&quot; According to the New York Society Library, &quot;Yes, there is a part of Los Angeles called Hollywood, but the Hollywood of our imagination is so much more. It is the locus of the motion picture industry. Home to stars and producers and writers. A glamorous place. A place that is quintessentially American—where strivers and connivers can reinvent themselves and where there is always the possibility of being discovered. For better or worse, it has helped to define our country to ourselves and to the world. It is easy to see why writers have taken it up as a subject so frequently.&quot; 

According to author Michael Friedman in &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, &quot;My informal taxonomy revealed that, as far as subject is concerned, Hollywood novels tend to fall into the following loose categories: moguls (Fitzgerald), divas (McCourt, Vidal), train wrecks (Stone, Didion), ingénues en route to stardom (Lambert), foolish dreams of being discovered (West, McCoy), and Brits who have had enough of our philistine ways and ersatz culture and return home to civilization (Waugh, Wodehouse).&quot;

<text>Susan Margaret Collins (born December 7, 1952) is an American politician serving as the senior United States senator from Maine. A member of the Republican Party, she has held her seat since 1997 and is Maine&#x27;s longest-serving member of Congress.

Born in Caribou, Maine, Collins is a graduate of St. Lawrence University in Canton, New York. Beginning her career as a staff assistant for Senator William Cohen in 1975, she became staff director of the Oversight of Government Management Subcommittee of the Committee on Governmental Affairs (which later became the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs) in 1981. Governor John R. McKernan Jr. then appointed her commissioner of the Maine Department of Professional and Financial Regulation in 1987. In 1992 President George H. W. Bush appointed her director of the Small Business Administration&#x27;s regional office in Boston. Collins became a deputy state treasurer in the office of the Treasurer and Receiver-General of Massachusetts in 1993. After moving back to Maine in 1994, she became the Republican nominee for governor of Maine in the 1994 general election. She was the first female major-party nominee for the post, finishing third in a four-way race with 23% of the vote. After her bid for governor in 1994, she became the founding director of the Center for Family Business at Husson University in Bangor, Maine.

Collins was first elected to the Senate in 1996. She was reelected in 2002, 2008, 2014, and 2020. She chaired the Senate Special Committee on Aging from 2015 to 2021 and the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs from 2003 to 2007. Collins is a senior Republican woman in the Senate, the dean of Maine&#x27;s congressional delegation, and the only New England Republican in the 116th, 117th, and 118th Congresses. Along with Dave McCormick of Pennsylvania, Collins is one of only two Republicans to represent a Northeastern state in the Senate. Thus far, Collins is the longest-serving Republican woman in the Senate, and since 2019, the only Republican official holding statewide office in Maine.

Generally regarded as a moderate Republican, Collins is often a pivotal vote in the Senate. She was one of three Republicans to vote against a partial repeal of the Affordable Care Act. She was the sole Republican to vote against confirming Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court and one of three to vote to confirm Ketanji Brown Jackson. As a pro-choice Republican, she drew scrutiny for her vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh, who she believed would not support overturning &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;. In 2022, he joined the majority opinion in &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot;, which overturned &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;. Collins subsequently opposed the Women&#x27;s Health Protection Act, proposing alternative legislation with two other Republicans to codify &quot;Roe&quot;.

During the impeachment trial of Bill Clinton, Collins was one of 10 Republican senators to vote to acquit him on the first charge and one of five to vote to acquit on the second. During the first impeachment trial of Donald Trump, Collins joined all Senate Republicans but one in voting to acquit him on the first charge, and all Republicans to acquit on the second. In his second impeachment trial, she was one of seven Republicans to vote to convict Trump of incitement of insurrection.

==Early life==

One of six children, Collins was born in Caribou, Maine, where her family operates a lumber business established by her great-great-great-grandfather, Samuel W. Collins, in 1844. Her parents, Patricia (née McGuigan) and Donald Collins (1925–2018), each served as mayor of Caribou. Her father, a decorated veteran of World War II, also served in the Maine Legislature, with one term in the House, and four in the Senate.

Collins&#x27;s mother was born in Barrancabermeja, Colombia, to American parents. Collins is of English and Irish ancestry. Her uncle, Samuel W. Collins Jr., sat on the Maine Supreme Judicial Court from 1988 to 1994 and served in the Maine Senate from 1973 to 1984.

Collins attended Caribou High School, where she was president of the student council. During her senior year of high school in 1971, she was chosen to participate in the U.S. Senate Youth Program, through which she visited Washington, D.C., for the first time and had a two-hour conversation with Maine&#x27;s first female United States Senator, Margaret Chase Smith, also a Republican. Collins is the first program delegate elected to the Senate and holds the seat once held by Smith. After graduating from high school, she continued her education at St. Lawrence University in Canton, New York. Like her father, she was elected to the Phi Beta Kappa national academic honor society. She graduated from St. Lawrence &quot;magna cum laude&quot; with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in government in 1975.

==Early political career==

Following graduation, Collins worked as a legislative assistant to U.S. Representative and later U.S. Senator William Cohen from 1975 to 1987. She was also staff director of the Oversight of Government Management Subcommittee on the United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs from 1981 to 1987.

In 1987, Collins joined the cabinet of Governor John R. McKernan Jr. as Commissioner of the Department of Professional and Financial Regulation. President George H. W. Bush appointed her the New England regional director for the Small Business Administration in 1992. After briefly serving in this post until the 1992 election of President Bill Clinton, she moved to Massachusetts and became Deputy State Treasurer of Massachusetts under Joe Malone in 1993.

Returning to Maine, Collins won an eight-way Republican primary in the 1994 gubernatorial election, becoming the first woman nominated by a major party for governor of Maine. During the campaign, she received little support from Republican leaders and was criticized by conservative groups for her more liberal views on social issues. She lost the general election, receiving 23% of the vote and placing third behind Democrat Joseph E. Brennan and the winner, Independent candidate Angus King, her future Senate colleague.

In December 1994, Collins became the founding executive director of the Richard E. Dyke Center for Family Business at Husson College. She served in this post until 1996, when she announced her candidacy for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by her former boss, William Cohen, who retired to become United States Secretary of Defense under President Bill Clinton. With Cohen&#x27;s public endorsement, she won a difficult four-way primary and faced Brennan, her opponent in the 1994 gubernatorial election, in the general election. She defeated him, 49% to 44%.

==U.S. Senate==
===Elections===

Collins was elected to the Senate in 1996. During the campaign she pledged that, if elected, she would serve only two terms.

Collins was reelected in 2002 over State Senator Chellie Pingree, 58%–42%, in 2008 over Representative Tom Allen, 61.5%–38.5%, and in 2014 over Shenna Bellows, 68.5%–31.5%. In her first three reelection campaigns, she carried every county in Maine.

In 2020, Collins was challenged by Democratic State House Speaker Sara Gideon. The hotly contested race became the most expensive in Maine history, with Collins spending $23 million and Gideon nearly $48 million. The race also had national implications, as defeating Collins was a key part of the Democrats&#x27; strategy to achieve a Senate majority. Despite trailing Gideon in every public poll of the race, Collins defeated Gideon by a decisive margin.

In 2009, Collins was called one of &quot;the last survivors of a once common species of moderate Northeastern Republican&quot;. She is considered a centrist Republican and an influential player in the Senate.

Although she shared a centrist ideology with Maine&#x27;s former senator, Olympia Snowe, Collins is considered a &quot;half-turn more conservative&quot; than Snowe. She was consistently endorsed by the Human Rights Campaign, a major LGBT rights organization, until 2020. She supported John McCain in the 2008 presidential election. She became the state&#x27;s senior senator in 2013 when Snowe left the Senate and was replaced by independent Angus King, who defeated Collins in the 1994 governor election.

===Tenure===
====First term====

In the 1990s, Collins played an important role during the Senate&#x27;s impeachment trial of Bill Clinton when she and Snowe sponsored a motion that would have allowed the Senate to vote separately on the charges and the sentence. The motion failed, and Snowe and Collins voted to acquit, believing that while Clinton had committed perjury, that was not grounds for removal from office.

In March 1997, the Senate adopted a broader investigation into White House and Congressional campaign fund-raising practices than Senate Republicans initially wanted. Collins said there were &quot;a number of allegations that may or may not be illegal, but they may be improper.&quot;

In a May 1997 interview, Collins stated her support for a proposal by Tom Daschle banning all abortions after the fetus is capable of living outside the womb except to save the life of the woman or protect her from physical injury. Of an alternative measure proposed by Rick Santorum that would ban partial-birth abortion, Collins said it &quot;ignores cases in the medical literature involving women with very serious physical health problems&quot;.

In 2001 Collins authored a measure that granted the United States Secretary of Education authority to grant waivers that would relieve reservists and members of the National Guard from making federal student loan payments during active duty and grant the same privileges to victims and families of those affected by the September 11 attacks. The bill passed the Senate and House in December 2001.

In November 2002, the Senate overwhelmingly approved the creation of the Department of Homeland Security while a Democratic effort to remove the bill&#x27;s provisions fell short on a 52-to-47 vote that came after President George W. Bush lobbied against the vote. Collins and other senators said that Senate and House Republicans, as well as the White House, had given them an &quot;ironclad promise&quot; to essentially rescind provisions in the first spending bill to pass Congress the following year.

====Second term====

In 2004, Collins was one of the primary sponsors of legislation overhauling the U.S. intelligence community by creating a new post, Director of National Intelligence, to oversee budgets and most assets of the spy agencies, and mandating that federal agencies establish minimum standards for states pertaining to issuing driver&#x27;s licenses and birth certificates along with directing the United States Department of Homeland Security to form standards for ID used to board airplanes. The bill passed in the House and Senate in December. Collins said, &quot;This was the most difficult bill to bring from conception to birth that I can imagine being involved with. But that makes the victory doubly satisfying.&quot; Bush signed the bill, formally known as the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act, on December 17, 2004.

In May 2005, Collins was one of 14 senators (seven Democrats and seven Republicans) to forge a compromise on the Democrats&#x27; use of the judicial filibuster, thus allowing the Republican leadership to end debate without having to exercise the nuclear option. Under the agreement, Democrats agreed they would filibuster Bush&#x27;s judicial nominees only in &quot;extraordinary circumstances&quot;; three Bush appellate court nominees (Janice Rogers Brown, Priscilla Owen, and William Pryor) would receive a vote by the full Senate; and two others, Henry Saad and William Myers, were expressly denied such protection (both eventually withdrew their names from consideration).

In October 2008, Collins criticized robocalls by the McCain campaign claiming that Barack Obama &quot;has worked closely with domestic terrorist Bill Ayers, whose organization bombed the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, a judge&#x27;s home and killed Americans&quot;, asserting that those &quot;kind of tactics have no place in Maine politics&quot; and urging McCain to cease the calls immediately.

====Third term====

In 2009, Collins was criticized for blocking flu relief funding during the swine flu pandemic. She said she had done so on procedural grounds, because the funding did not belong in a stimulus bill: &quot;while worthwhile, [it does] not boost our economy,&quot; and &quot;it does not make sense to include $870million for pandemic flu preparedness.&quot;

In April 2010, Collins and Senator Joe Lieberman issued a subpoena seeking documents and interviews associated with the American government&#x27;s investigation into the conduct of investigators during their interactions with Nidal Hasan before the Fort Hood shooting. The Pentagon announced that the Obama administration would not authorize Senate investigators to question intelligence agents who reviewed e-mails between Hasan and an extremist Islamic cleric before the shooting. Collins and Lieberman issued a statement accusing the Departments of Justice and Defense of refusing &quot;to provide access to their agents who reportedly reviewed Major Hasan&#x27;s communications with radical extremist cleric Anwar al Awlaki and to transcripts of prosecution interviews with Hasan&#x27;s associates and superiors, which DOD already provided to its internal review.&quot;
In May 2010, Collins and Snowe were the only two Republicans to vote for an unsuccessful Democratic measure that would have prevented bailouts, highlighted financial products of complexity and toughened consumer protection.

In February 2013, Collins announced her opposition to the confirmation of Chuck Hagel for United States Secretary of Defense, citing her belief that Hagel&#x27;s &quot;past positions, votes and statements [do not] match the challenges of our time.&quot; The announcement came as a surprise, as Collins was considered a possible supporter of his nomination, and it occurred while the nomination was being filibustered. The filibuster on Hagel&#x27;s nomination was defeated, and he was confirmed later that month.

In May 2013, following a report that the Internal Revenue Service had put additional scrutiny on conservative groups, Collins said the revelation &quot;contributes to the profound distrust that the American people have in government&quot; and added that she was disappointed that Obama &quot;hasn&#x27;t personally condemned this and spoken out&quot;.

In April 2014, the Senate debated the Minimum Wage Fairness Act (S. 1737; 113th Congress). The bill would have amended the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) to increase the federal minimum wage to $10.10 per hour over two years. The bill was strongly supported by Obama and many Democratic senators but strongly opposed by Republicans in the Senate and House. Collins tried to negotiate a compromise bill that centrist Republicans could agree to but was unable to do so.

====Fourth term====

In May 2016, the Senate passed an appropriations bill containing an amendment by Collins that she said would help prevent the Department of Housing and Urban Development from gaining &quot;national zoning authority for every neighborhood in our country&quot;. The legislation was given a veto threat by the White House, which was said by the Office of Management and Budget to oppose &quot;the inclusion of problematic ideological provisions that are beyond the scope of funding legislation&quot;.

In 2016, Collins authored the Safe Treatments and Opportunities to Prevent Pain Act, a provision intended to encourage the National Institutes of Health to further its research into opioid therapy alternatives for pain management, and the Infant Plan of Safe Care Act, which mandated that states ensure safe care plans are developed for infants who are drug-dependent before they are discharged from hospitals. These provisions were included in the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, legislation that created programs and expanded treatment access alongside implementing $181million in new spending as part of an attempt to curb heroin and opioid addiction. Obama signed the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act into law on July 22, 2016.

On August 8, 2016, Collins announced that she would not vote for Donald Trump, the Republican nominee in the 2016 presidential election. She said that as a lifelong Republican she did not make the decision lightly but felt he was unsuitable for office, &quot;based on his disregard for the precept of treating others with respect, an idea that should transcend politics&quot;. She considered voting for the Libertarian Party&#x27;s ticket or a write-in candidate.

In the 2016 United States presidential election, Collins received one electoral vote for vice president from a faithless elector in Washington.

In January 2017, Collins and Senator Lisa Murkowski voted for Trump&#x27;s nominee for Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, within the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, passing DeVos&#x27;s nomination by a vote of 12–11 to allow the full Senate to vote. Collins justified her vote, saying, &quot;Presidents are entitled to considerable deference in the selection of Cabinet members.&quot; Later, she and Murkowski were the only Republicans to break party lines and vote against DeVos&#x27;s confirmation. This caused a 50–50 tie that was broken by Senate President Mike Pence to confirm DeVos.

In March 2017, Collins said she could not support the American Health Care Act, the House Republicans&#x27; plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. She announced she would vote against the Senate version of the Republican bill to repeal Obamacare. Collins also clarified that she opposed repealing the ACA without a replacement proposal. On July 26, Collins was one of seven Republicans in voting against repealing the ACA without a suitable replacement. On July 27, she joined two other Republicans in voting against the &quot;skinny&quot; repeal of the ACA. In October, Collins called on Trump to support a bipartisan Congressional effort led by Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray to reinstate insurer payments, saying that what Trump was doing was &quot;affecting people&#x27;s access and the cost of health care right now&quot;.

On December 14, 2017, the day the FCC was set to hold a vote on net neutrality, Collins and King sent the FCC a letter asking that the vote be postponed to allow public hearings on the merits of repealing net neutrality. They expressed concerns that repealing net neutrality could adversely affect the U.S. economy. As part of this drive, Collins is reported to support using the authority under the Congressional Review Act to nullify the FCC&#x27;s repeal vote. In 2018, Collins was one of three Republicans voting with Democrats to repeal rule changes enacted by the Republican-controlled FCC. The measure was meant to restore Obama-era net neutrality rules.

In 2017, The Lugar Center, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit founded by Senator Richard Lugar, released a bipartisan index in cooperation with Georgetown University that ranked Collins the most bipartisan senator during the first session of the 115th Congress (and the only U.S. Senator from the Northeast ranked among the top 10 most bipartisan senators).

In January 2018, in response to the Trump administration&#x27;s not implementing congressionally approved sanctions on Russia, Collins said it was confirmed Russia had tried to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, adding, &quot;not only should there be a price to pay in terms of sanctions, but also we need to put safeguards in place right now for the elections for this year.&quot; She noted that the legislation received bipartisan support and predicted Russia would also attempt to interfere in the 2018 elections. In January 2019, Collins was one of 11 Republican senators to vote to advance legislation intended to block Trump from lifting sanctions on three Russian companies. She said she disagreed with &quot;the easing of the sanctions because I think it sends the wrong message to Russia and to the oligarch and close ally of Mr. Putin, Oleg Deripaska, who will in my judgment continue to maintain considerable [ownership] under the Treasury&#x27;s plan.&quot;

In 2018, Collins and Senators Tim Kaine, Catherine Cortez Masto, and Shelley Moore Capito authored the Building Our Largest Dementia (BOLD) Infrastructure for Alzheimer&#x27;s Act, legislation centered on providing a public health approach to Alzheimer&#x27;s. The bill would authorize $20million annually to establish the &quot;Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease and Related Dementias Public Health Centers of Excellence&quot; and aid statewide efforts to promote brain health and reduce cognitive decline. It passed the Senate and House and was signed by Trump in January 2019.

In September 2018, Collins authored two bills as part of the Opioid Crisis Response Act, a bipartisan package of 70 Senate bills that would alter programs across multiple agencies in an effort to prevent opioids from being shipped through the U.S. Postal Service and grant doctors the ability to prescribe medications designed to wean opioid addictions. The bills passed 99 to 1.

In February 2019, Collins was one of five senators to sponsor legislation authorizing the Treasury Department to mint coins honoring George H. W. Bush and Barbara Bush under the Presidential $1 Coin Act of 2005 and introduced the Reviving America&#x27;s Scenic Byways Act of 2019 along with Ben Cardin. The bill required the Secretary of Transportation to request nominations and make determinations in regard to roads that would be designed under a voluntary, community-based program and was signed into law by Trump in September of that year. After the Senate Intelligence Committee held a closed-door meeting with Michael Cohen, Collins said senators &quot;clearly need to re-interview some witnesses whose accounts [Cohen] contradicts&quot;. Her comment was seen as hinting at the Intelligence Committee&#x27;s interest in speaking with Donald Trump Jr. again. In June, Collins cosponsored an amendment to form the John S. McCainIII Human Rights Commission, which would hold hearings and briefings on human rights violations ahead of collaborations with the Trump administration to address the violations, and be included in a defense authorization bill McCain had helped create as Armed Services Committee chairman.

In her May 2019 commencement speech at Maine Maritime Academy, Collins said getting the Senate to approve funding for a new training ship for the academy was her &quot;number one priority&quot; and that funding was included in Trump&#x27;s proposed budget while she would still seek further funds through other measures.

In July 2019, Collins cosponsored the Fallen Journalists Memorial Act, a bill introduced by Ben Cardin and Rob Portman that would create a new, privately funded memorial that would be constructed on federal lands in Washington, D.C. in order to honor journalists, photographers, and broadcasters who died in the line of duty. Collins called freedom of the press &quot;one of our fundamental constitutional rights&quot; and spoke of the risks of reprisals faced by reporters around the world for their work.

In February 2020, Collins voted &quot;not guilty&quot; on both articles in the first impeachment trial of Donald Trump.

On October 26, 2020, Collins was the only Republican senator to vote against the confirmation of Trump&#x27;s nominee Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. Barrett was confirmed by a vote of 52–48.

====Fifth term====

On January 6, 2021, Collins was participating in the certification of the Electoral College vote count when Trump supporters attacked the United States Capitol. She was on the Senate floor listening to speeches related to the objection to counting Arizona&#x27;s votes when the Sergeant at Arms of the U.S. Senate and U.S. Capitol Police removed Vice President Mike Pence and Senators Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer. She called the experience &quot;frightening and appalling.&quot; Collins later called the attack &quot;a dangerous, shameful, and outrageous attack on our democracy&quot; and blamed Trump for &quot;working up the crowd and inciting this mob&quot;. She called on him to call off the rioters. When Congress reconvened after the Capitol was secure, Collins voted to certify the count.

Toward the end of January 2021, Collins led a group of 10 Republican senators who requested that President Joe Biden join bipartisan negotiations when creating his COVID-19 economic relief package. After meeting with the group, Biden opted to pass his relief package using the reconciliation process, for which he did not need Republican support.

On February 13, 2021, Collins was one of seven Republican senators to vote to convict Trump in his second impeachment trial.

Political analysis website FiveThirtyEight found that Collins had voted in line with President Joe Biden around 67% of the time in the 117th Congress.

On May 18, 2021, Axios revealed the Federal Bureau of Investigation investigation of defense contractor Martin Kao, former CEO of Navatek, who funneled $150,000 to a pro-Collins super PAC, 1820PAC, via a shell LLC, Society for Young Women Scientists and Engineers, as a federal contractor, and reimbursed donations to the Collins 2020 campaign, both of which are illegal. A spokesperson said that the campaign had no knowledge of the exchange.

Collins cast her 8,000th consecutive roll call vote on October 28, 2021; only Chuck Grassley and William Proxmire have set longer streaks. On April 19, 2024, the Senate recognized her 9,000th vote that night, surpassing Grassley&#x27;s 8,927-vote streak earlier in March.

Collins voted to confirm Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court, making her one of the only three GOP senators to support her nomination, the other two being Lisa Murkowski and Mitt Romney.

==Political positions==


Collins has been described as a moderate Republican and a centrist, having voted with her party 59% of the time from 1997 to 2016. She voted with her party more often, about 87% of the time, in 2017, at the beginning of the Trump administration.

In 2013, Collins sided with Obama&#x27;s position 75.9% of the time, one of only two Republicans to vote with him more than 70% of the time. As of January 2021, according to &quot;FiveThirtyEight&quot;, she had voted with Trump&#x27;s positions about 65% of the time, the lowest among all Republican senators. During Trump&#x27;s presidency she voted with the Republican majority on party-line votes much more often than during Obama&#x27;s presidency. According to FiveThirtyEight, as of January 2023, she had voted with Biden&#x27;s position about 67% of the time.

Collins voted to acquit Trump of all charges at his first impeachment trial. She said she did not think Trump&#x27;s request that the Ukrainian President announce an investigation into Joe Biden met the &quot;high bar&quot; for &quot;removing a duly elected president&quot;. She said Trump had &quot;learned from this case&quot; and &quot;will be much more cautious in the future.&quot; Shortly after his acquittal, Trump fired witnesses in the impeachment inquiry. In the following months, he fired inspectors general of the State Department and the intelligence community. Collins criticized the firing, provoking a retaliatory response from Trump.

On February 13, 2021, Collins was one of the seven Republican senators who voted to convict Trump in his second impeachment trial. On May 27, 2021, along with five other Republicans and all present Democrats, she voted to establish a bipartisan commission to investigate the Capitol attack. She had amended the bill in the hopes of drawing sufficient Republicans to support it, but the vote failed for lack of 60 required &quot;yes&quot; votes to prevent a filibuster.

In 2023, the Lugar Center ranked Collins first among senators for bipartisanship.

===Abortion===
Collins is one of two Republican U.S. Senators, along with Lisa Murkowski, who describe themselves as pro-choice, or pro-abortion rights, and supported &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;.

According to &quot;HuffPost&quot;, Collins has repeatedly voted to confirm judges who have signaled opposition to abortion rights. She has defended these votes by citing her support for both of Obama&#x27;s Supreme Court appointments. She voted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court, saying she did not believe he would overturn &quot;Roe&quot;. She said she felt &quot;vindication&quot; in 2018 when Kavanaugh voted with the court&#x27;s four Democratic-appointed justices and Chief Justice John Roberts not to hear cases against Planned Parenthood from Kansas and Louisiana, although Planned Parenthood disagreed with her assessment of the situation. In 2020, Collins faced renewed criticism of her vote by progressive groups when Kavanaugh said states should be permitted to severely reduce access to and availability of abortion in his dissent in &quot;June Medical Services LLC v Russo&quot;.

In 2021, Collins was one of three Republican senators to decline to sign an &quot;amicus&quot; brief supporting an anti-abortion Mississippi law banning abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. She faced renewed criticism after Kavanaugh voted with the majority, in a 5–4 vote, to reject an emergency petition to block a Texas law banning abortion after six weeks of pregnancy; the law went into effect while facing continued challenges in the courts. Responding to the legislation and criticism, Collins denounced the Texas anti-abortion law as &quot;extreme, inhumane, and unconstitutional&quot; and said she supports the &quot;Roe&quot; precedent as the &quot;law of the land&quot;.

In 2022, Collins received additional criticism for her support of Kavanaugh after a leaked draft of the Supreme Court opinion in &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot; indicated the Court would overturn &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, with Kavanaugh breaking with his statements that &quot;Roe&quot; was &quot;settled law&quot;. She has also received criticism for calling the police in reaction to chalk protests due to her votes to confirm justices involved in the draft ruling.

On May 11, 2022, Collins voted against the Women&#x27;s Health Protection Act of 2022, a bill that would prohibit a variety of restrictions on access to abortion, on the basis that it went too far beyond the standards established in &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; and &quot;Planned Parenthood v. Casey&quot;. Collins joined Murkowski and Senator Kyrsten Sinema in drafting the Reproductive Choice Act, alternative legislation that would codify &quot;Roe&quot; and &quot;Casey&quot; into federal law more narrowly.

===Economy===

In 2004, Collins expressed concerns about how the Bush administration wanted to implement its proposed plan to cut taxes. She cited deficit concerns as a reason for opposing the plan, but ultimately voted in favor of the Bush tax cuts in 2003 and for their extension in 2006. Collins was one of just three Republican lawmakers to vote for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, prompting heated criticism from the right for crossing party lines.

In December 2017, Collins voted to pass the 2017 Republican tax plan. The bill greatly reduces corporate taxes while reducing taxes for some individuals and increasing them for others by removing some popular deductions. The bill also repeals Affordable Care Act&#x27;s individual mandate, leaving thirteen million Americans uninsured and raising premiums by an estimated additional 10% per year. After the vote, Collins said she received assurances from congressional leaders that they would pass legislation intended to mitigate some of the adverse effects of the individual mandate&#x27;s repeal. When asked how she could vote for a bill that would increase the deficit by an estimated $1trillion (over ten years) after having railed against the deficit during the Obama administration, Collins insisted that it would not increase the deficit. She said she had been advised in this determination by economists Glenn Hubbard, Larry Lindsey, and Douglas Holtz-Eakin. Conservative columnist Jennifer Rubin wrote that Hubbard and Holtz-Eakin denied saying the plan would not increase the deficit.

After voting for the tax plan, Collins became the top recipient of political donations from private equity firms. Blackstone chief executive Steven Schwarzman donated $2 million to Collins&#x27;s PAC, and Ken Griffin of the hedge fund Citadel donated $1.5 million.

Along with all other Senate and House Republicans, Collins voted against the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. On September 30, 2021, she was one of 15 Senate Republicans to join all Democrats and both Independents to approve a temporary spending bill to continue government funding and avoid a government shutdown. On October 7, 2021, she voted with 10 other Republicans and all members of the Democratic caucus to break the filibuster on raising the debt ceiling. She voted with all Republicans against the legislation to raise the debt ceiling.

===Environment===
In 2008, Collins joined the bipartisan Gang of 20, which sought to break a deadlock on a bill allowing offshore drilling that would devote billions in proceeds to renewable energy development.

In February 2017, Collins was the only Republican to vote against undoing an Obama administration rule that required coal mining companies to avoid contaminating local waterways. She was the only Republican to vote against the confirmation of Scott Pruitt, and later Andrew Wheeler, to lead the Environmental Protection Agency.

In 2017, Collins voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, allowing oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, after unsuccessfully attempting to remove that part of the bill.

As of 2022, Collins has a lifetime score of 60% from the League of Conservation Voters, the highest of any incumbent Senate Republican.

===Foreign policy and national security===

In 2003, Collins voted in favor of the Iraq War Resolution authorizing President Bush to go to war against Iraq. In November 2007, she was one of four Republicans to vote for a Democratic proposal of $50billion that would condition further spending on a timeline for withdrawing troops, mandating that a withdrawal begin 30 days after the bill was enacted as part of a goal of removing all U.S. troops in Iraq by December 15, 2008. The bill failed to get the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster. In April 2008, Collins and Senators Ben Nelson and Evan Bayh met with Bush&#x27;s advisor on Iraq and Afghanistan, Douglas Lute, and expressed support for a prohibition on spending for major reconstruction projects, the proposal requiring Iraqis to pay for its security forces to be trained and equipped and reimburse the American military for the estimated $153million a month the military spent on fueling in combat operations in Iraq. Collins said after the meeting that while the administration did not have a view entirely similar to the senators&#x27;, it at least seemed open to their proposal. In June 2014, while growing violence erupted in Iraq under the leadership of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, Collins said the violence would have been slower had a residual NATO force been present in Iraq and that the question was whether airstrikes were effective.

In September 2009, Collins said she was unsure whether sending more American troops to Afghanistan would help end the Afghanistan War, but cited the need for &quot;more American civilians to help build up institutions&quot; and growth of the Afghan army. In 2010, she called for the removal of Arnold Fields as Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, citing his repeated expressing of concern for the SIGAR and his disappointment with the Obama administration&#x27;s &quot;ongoing failure to take decisive action&quot;. In August 2017, Collins commended Trump for providing clarity after years of the U.S. lacking a &quot;clear focus and defined strategy&quot; with respect to Afghanistan and said he made the case that the Afghan government must participate &quot;in defending its people, ending havens for terrorists, and curtailing corruption&quot;.

Before Obama met President of the People&#x27;s Republic of China Xi Jinping at an informal retreat in June 2013, Collins cosponsored legislation that would authorize the Commerce Department to investigate whether currency manipulation is a form of subsidization. In April 2018, she said the U.S. needed &quot;a more nuanced approach&quot; in dealing with China but gave Trump &quot;credit for levying these tariffs against the Chinese, with whom we&#x27;ve talked for a decade about their unfair trade practices and their theft of intellectual property from American firms&quot;, adding that while the U.S. needed to toughen its stance against China, it would need to do this in a manner that did not create &quot;a trade war and retaliation that will end up with our European and Asian competitors getting business that otherwise would have come to American farmers&quot;.

In March 2015, Collins was one of seven Senate Republicans not to sign a March 2015 letter to the leadership of the Islamic Republic of Iran attempting to cast doubt on the Obama administration&#x27;s authority to engage in nuclear-proliferation negotiations with Iran. She announced her opposition to the Iran nuclear agreement later that year, saying it was &quot;fundamentally flawed because it leaves Iran as capable of building a nuclear weapon at the expiration of the agreement as it is today&quot;, and predicted Iran &quot;will be a more dangerous and stronger nuclear threshold state&quot; after the agreement expires. In June 2019, after the United States nearly launched an airstrike on Iran after Iran downed an American surveillance drone, Collins said the U.S. could not &quot;allow Iran to continue to launch this kind of attack&quot; but warned that miscalculations by either side &quot;could lead to a war in the Middle East&quot;.

In March 2017, Collins co-sponsored the Israel Anti-Boycott Act (S.270), which made it a federal crime, punishable by a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment, for Americans to encourage or participate in boycotts against Israel and Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories if protesting actions by the Israeli government.

In March 2018, Collins was one of five Republican senators to vote against tabling a resolution that would cease the U.S. military&#x27;s support for Saudi Arabia&#x27;s bombing operations in Yemen. In December, she was one of seven Republican senators to vote for the resolution withdrawing American armed forces&#x27; support for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen and an amendment by Todd Young ensuring midair refueling between American and Saudi Air Force did not resume. Collins was one of seven Republicans to vote to end U.S. support for the war in Yemen in February 2019, and, in May 2019, she was one of seven Republicans to vote to override Trump&#x27;s veto of the resolution on Yemen. In June 2019, Collins was one of seven Republicans to vote to block Trump&#x27;s Saudi arms deal providing weapons to Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Jordan and one of five Republicans to vote against an additional 20 arms sales.

In May 2020, Collins voted to confirm U.S. Representative John Ratcliffe as Director of National Intelligence. In 2019, there was bipartisan opposition to Ratcliffe&#x27;s nomination. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called Collins&#x27;s support for Ratcliffe &quot;key&quot; to his 2020 confirmation.

===Gun policy===

Collins voted for the Manchin–Toomey bill to amend federal law to expand background checks for gun purchases. She voted against a ban on high-capacity (more than ten rounds) magazines. In 2014 she received a &quot;C&quot; grade on gun rights from the NRA Political Victory Fund, rising to a &quot;B&quot; rating in 2020. She received a D− from Gun Owners of America in 2012.

In 2018, Collins co-sponsored the NICS Denial Notification Act, legislation developed in the aftermath of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting that would require federal authorities to inform states within a day after a person failing the National Instant Criminal Background Check System attempted to buy a firearm.

In February 2019, Collins supported the Terrorist Firearms Prevention Act, legislation enabling the attorney general to deny the sale of a firearm to people on the no-fly list or selectee list. It passed the House but failed to advance in the Senate.

In 2020, Gun Owners of Maine gave Collins a B rating, writing, &quot;On 2nd Amendment issues, Susan Collins generally stands with gun owners. She has opposed magazine capacity restrictions and voted to prohibit lawsuits against gun manufacturers for crimes committed with guns.&quot;

In 2022, Collins became one of ten Republican senators to support a bipartisan agreement on gun control, which included a red flag provision, a support for state crisis intervention orders, funding for school safety resources, stronger background checks for buyers under the age of 21, and penalties for straw purchases.

===Health care===

In May 2017, Collins was one of six senators to introduce the Medicaid Coverage for Addiction Recovery Expansion Act, legislation that would allow treatment facilities with up to 40 beds reimbursement by Medicaid for 60 consecutive days of inpatient services and serve as a modification of the Medicaid Institutions for Mental Disease law, which authorized Medicaid coverage only for facilities with 16 or fewer beds.

Though she voted against the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), Collins (along with fellow Republicans John McCain and Lisa Murkowski) voted against an unsuccessful &quot;skinny repeal&quot; attempt in July 2017. Later that year, she voted with Republican senators to repeal the individual mandate of the ACA. The absence of the individual mandate weakened the ACA&#x27;s legal stability, leading the Trump administration in 2020 to seek to have the ACA ruled unconstitutional by the courts (in a 5–4 Supreme Court decision in 2012, Chief Justice Roberts upheld the ACA by citing the individual mandate). The ACA remained intact, despite the lack of the individual mandate, following a 7-2 Supreme Court decision to reject a challenge to the law.

In December 2017, Collins was one of nine senators to sign a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer describing opioid use as a nonpartisan issue that was &quot;ravaging communities in every state and preys upon individuals and families regardless of party affiliation&quot; and requesting that they &quot;make every effort to ensure that new, substantial and sustained funding for the opioid epidemic is included in any legislative package&quot;.

In April 2019, Collins cosponsored the Protecting Jessica Grubb&#x27;s Legacy Act, legislation that authorized the sharing of the medical records of patients being treated for substance use disorder among healthcare providers if the patient provided the information. Cosponsor Shelley Moore Capito said the bill also prevented medical providers from unintentionally providing opioids to individuals in recovery.

===Immigration===

In 2007, Collins voted against the bipartisan McCain-Kennedy comprehensive immigration reform proposal, which would have given undocumented immigrants (including those brought into the United States as minors) a pathway to citizenship if they met certain requirements, while also substantially increasing border enforcement. In 2010, she voted against the DREAM Act. In 2013, Collins was one of 14 Republicans to vote in favor of a comprehensive immigration bill that included border security and a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. She opposed Obama&#x27;s decision to achieve immigration reform through executive action, which gave deportation relief to as many as five million undocumented immigrants through Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).

In 2017, Collins opposed Trump&#x27;s executive order to ban entry to the U.S. by citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, saying, &quot;The worldwide refugee ban set forth in the executive order is overly broad and implementing it will be immediately problematic.&quot; In 2019, she introduced bipartisan legislation to oppose Trump&#x27;s declaration emergency at the southern border in order to build a wall. She was one of a dozen Republicans who broke with their party, joining all Democrats, to vote for the resolution rejecting the emergency declaration. In September 2019, she again voted with 10 other Republicans to overturn Trump&#x27;s emergency declaration on the border.

===LGBTQ policy===

In 2004, Collins was one of six Republicans who voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment, a proposed amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would ban same-sex marriage. She voted in favor of the Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell Repeal Act of 2010 and was the primary Republican sponsor of the repeal effort. In 2015, she was one of 11 Republican senators to vote to give Social Security benefits to same-sex couples in states where same-sex marriage was not yet recognized.

In 2017 and 2019, Collins co-sponsored bills with Democratic senators to prevent Trump from banning transgender people from the United States military and prohibit anti-LGBT housing discrimination. She was the only Republican co-sponsor of the Equality Act, which aims to comprehensively prohibit LGBT discrimination. In February 2021, Collins announced she would no longer co-sponsor the bill over amendments that were not made.

In 2021, Collins was one of 49 senators to vote for an amendment to the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, which aimed to defund schools allowing transgender students to compete in sports.

The Human Rights Campaign (HRC), which rates politicians&#x27; support for LGBT issues, gave Collins a score of 85% during the 114th Congress (2015–17), and a score of 33% during the 115th Congress (2017–19). She received a 49% score in the 116th Congress. In 2020, the HRC endorsed an opponent of Collins for the first time since 1996, citing her votes for judicial nominees, particularly Brett Kavanaugh. In 2022, Collins was one of 12 Republicans in the Senate voting to advance and pass the Respect for Marriage Act, legislation intended to codify same-sex marriage rights into federal law.

=== Net neutrality ===
Collins strongly supports FCC Open Internet Order 2010. After former Federal Communications Commission chairman Ajit Pai repealed net neutrality regulations in 2017, Collins and Senator Angus King announced they would support a bipartisan enactment of the Congressional Review Act to reverse the FCC&#x27;s decision. In another statement, Collins argued that net neutrality regulations would help rural communities obtain access to the internet and that the regulations strengthened consumer privacy protections, citing the Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal for failing to protect consumers&#x27; privacy.

===United States Postal Service===

In 2006, Collins sponsored the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act, which passed the Senate unanimously. It requires the USPS to prepay 50 years&#x27; worth of employee health and retirement benefits. Since the act passed, the USPS has defaulted on payments.

==Honors and awards==
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a lobbying group, awarded Collins the 2013 Spirit of Enterprise Award for her support of its positions.

On May 7, 2014, &quot;The National Journal&quot; recognized Collins as the senator with &quot;perfect attendance&quot;, noting that she had not missed a single vote since her election to the Senate in 1997.

In 2014, &quot;Elle&quot; magazine named Collins one of its &quot;10 Most Powerful Women in D.C&quot;.

Collins received the Publius Award from the Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress on March 12, 2014.

The Veterans of Foreign Wars gave Collins its 2017 Congressional Award, which is annually given to one member of Congress for their significant legislative contributions on behalf of military veterans.

In 2022, Collins received the Academy of Achievement&#x27;s Golden Plate Award.

In December 2024, Susan Collins was included on the BBC&#x27;s 100 Women list.

==Honorary degrees==

==Personal life==

Collins is married to Thomas Daffron, a lobbyist who worked as chief operating officer at Jefferson Consulting Group in Washington, D.C. from 2006 to 2016; he consulted on Collins&#x27;s 1996, 2002 and 2008 Senate campaigns. They were married on August 11, 2012, at the Gray Memorial United Methodist Church in Caribou, Maine. Collins is Roman Catholic.

==Electoral history==

Collins has been on the general-election ballot six times in Maine: once for governor, five times for U.S. senator. She has been defeated just once, in her 1994 campaign for governor.

<doc id="375197" wikidata="Q710721" url="?curid=375197" title="William Cohen">
<text>William Sebastian Cohen (born August 28, 1940) is an American lawyer, author, and politician from the U.S. state of Maine. A Republican, Cohen served as both a member of the United States House of Representatives (1973–1979) and Senate (1979–1997), and as Secretary of Defense (1997–2001) under Democratic President Bill Clinton.

Described as &quot;a Republican moderate from Maine&quot; and &quot;something of a maverick centrist&quot; by David Halberstam, Cohen had very good working relations with President Clinton and National Security Adviser Sandy Berger and an &quot;almost ideal&quot; collaboration with the Joint Chiefs of Staff; however he often clashed with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, whom he saw as &quot;a grandstander, too outspoken on policy matters, and too eager to use military force.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Cohen was born in Bangor, Maine. His mother, Clara (née Hartley), was of Protestant Irish ancestry, and his father, Reuben Cohen, was born in New York and was the son of a Russian Jewish immigrant; the two owned the Bangor Rye Bread Co.

Pursuant to his father&#x27;s wishes, Cohen was raised Jewish, attended a synagogue, and also attended Hebrew School in preparation for his bar mitzvah, but he decided not to follow through with his bar mitzvah when he was informed that he would have to convert formally to Judaism, and he began to practice Christianity.

After graduating from Bangor High School in 1958, Cohen attended Bowdoin College, graduating &quot;cum laude&quot; with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Latin in 1962. While a student at Bowdoin, Cohen was initiated as a brother of the Kappa chapter of the Psi Upsilon fraternity.

While in high school and college, Cohen was a basketball player and was named to the Maine all-state high school and college basketball team, and at Bowdoin was inducted into the New England All-Star Hall of Fame. Cohen attended law school at the Boston University School of Law, graduating with a Bachelor of Laws degree &quot;cum laude&quot; in 1965.

==Legal, academic, and early political career==
He became an assistant county attorney for Penobscot County (1968–1970). In 1968 he became an instructor at Husson College in Bangor, and later was an instructor in business administration at the University of Maine (1968–1972).

Cohen served as the vice president of the Maine Trial Lawyers Association (1970–1972) and as a member of the Bangor School Board (1971–1972). He became a fellow at Harvard Kennedy School in 1972, and in 1975 was named as one of the U.S. Jaycee&#x27;s &quot;ten outstanding young men.&quot;

Cohen was elected to the Bangor City Council (1969–1972) and served as Bangor Mayor in 1971–1972.

==House of Representatives and Senate==

In the 1972 election, Cohen won a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, representing Maine&#x27;s 2nd congressional district, succeeding Democrat William Hathaway, who was elected to the US Senate. Cohen defeated Democratic State Senator Elmer H. Violette of Van Buren.

During his first term in Congress, Cohen was assigned to the House Judiciary Committee, where he participated in the 1974 impeachment hearings against President Richard Nixon. He was one of the first Republicans on the committee to support impeaching Nixon. During this time, &quot;Time&quot; magazine named him one of &quot;America&#x27;s 200 Future Leaders&quot;. In July 1974, he said,


After three terms in the House, Cohen was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1978, defeating incumbent William Hathaway in his first bid for reelection. Cohen was reelected in 1984 and 1990, serving a total of 18 years in the Senate (1979–1997). In 1990, he defeated Democrat Neil Rolde. Cohen developed a reputation as a moderate Republican with liberal views on social issues and has been described as &quot;a career-long maverick with a reputation for fashioning compromise out of discord.&quot;

In 1994 Cohen investigated the federal government&#x27;s process for acquiring information technology, and his report, &quot;Computer Chaos: Billions Wasted Buying Federal Computer Systems&quot;, generated much discussion. He chose not to run for another Senate term in 1996; Susan Collins, who had worked for Cohen, was elected to succeed him.

While in the Senate, Cohen served on both the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Governmental Affairs Committee (1979–1997) and was a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee 1983–1991 and again 1995–1997, serving as Vice Chairman from 1987 to 1991. He also participated in the drafting of several notable laws related to defense matters, including the Competition in Contracting Act (1984), the Montgomery G.I. Bill Act (1984), the Goldwater–Nichols Act (1986), the Intelligence Oversight Reform Act (1991), the Federal Acquisition Reform Act (1996), the Nunn–Cohen Act Amendment creating the United States Special Operations Command, and the Information Technology Management Reform Act, also known as the Clinger–Cohen Act (1996). Cohen voted in favor of the bill establishing Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a federal holiday and the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 (as well as to override President Reagan&#x27;s veto). Cohen voted in favor of the nominations of Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas to the U.S. Supreme Court.

==Secretary of Defense==
On December 5, 1996, President Bill Clinton announced his selection of Cohen as Secretary of Defense, saying that he was the &quot;right person&quot; to build on the achievements of retiring secretary William Perry &quot;to secure the bipartisan support America&#x27;s armed forces must have and clearly deserve.&quot; As Secretary of Defense Cohen played a large role in directing the United States military actions in Iraq and Kosovo, including the dismissal of Wesley Clark from his post as the NATO Supreme Allied Commander. Both Operation Desert Fox in Iraq and Operation Allied Force in Kosovo were launched just months after al-Qaeda carried out the United States embassy bombings in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania and Nairobi, Kenya in 1998.

===Confirmation===
During his confirmation hearings, Cohen said he thought he might differ with Clinton on specific national security issues on occasion. He implicitly criticized the Clinton administration for lacking a clear strategy for leaving Bosnia and stated that he thought U.S. troops should definitely be out by mid-1998. He also asserted that he would resist further budget cuts, retain the two regional conflicts strategy, and support spending increases for advanced weapons, even if it necessitated further cuts in military personnel. Cohen questioned whether savings from base closings and acquisition reform could provide enough money for procurement of new weapons and equipment that the Joint Chiefs of Staff thought necessary in the next few years. He supported the expansion of NATO and looked on the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction as the most serious problem the United States faced.

After confirmation by a unanimous Senate vote, Cohen was sworn in as the 20th Secretary of Defense on January 24, 1997. He then settled into a schedule much fuller than he had followed in the Senate. Routinely he arrived at the Pentagon before 7 a.m., received an intelligence briefing, and then met with the Deputy Secretary of Defense (John Hamre 1997–2000, Rudy de Leon 2000–2001) and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (Gen. Hugh Shelton). The rest of the day he devoted to policy and budget briefings, visits with foreign and other dignitaries, and to what he termed &quot;ABC&quot; meetings at the White House with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and National Security Advisor Sandy Berger as well as President Bill Clinton. He also traveled abroad several times during his first months in office.

===Defense budget===

One of Cohen&#x27;s first major duties was to present to Congress the fiscal year 1998 defense budget, which had been prepared under Secretary Perry. Cohen requested a $250.7 billion budget, which represented 3 percent of the nation&#x27;s estimated gross domestic product for FY 1998. Cohen stressed three top budget priorities: people (recruiting and retaining skilled people through regular military pay raises, new construction or modernization of barracks, and programs for child care, family support, morale, welfare, and recreation), readiness (support for force readiness, training, exercises, maintenance, supplies, and other essential needs), and modernization (development and upgrading of weapon and supporting systems to guarantee the combat superiority of U.S. forces). This meant increasing the funds available for procurement of new systems, with the target set at $60 billion by FY2001.

When he presented the FY1998 budget, Cohen noted that he would involve himself with the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), which would focus on the challenges to U.S. security and the nation&#x27;s military needs over the next decade or more. When the QDR became public in May 1997, it did not fundamentally alter the military&#x27;s budget, structure, and doctrine. Many defense experts thought it gave insufficient attention to new forms of warfare, such as terrorist attacks, electronic sabotage, and the use of chemical and biological agents. Cohen stated that the Pentagon would retain the &quot;two regional wars&quot; scenario adopted after the end of the Cold War. He decided to scale back purchases of jet fighters, including the Air Force&#x27;s F-22 Raptor and the Navy&#x27;s F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, as well as Navy surface ships. The review included cutting another 61,700 active duty service members—15,000 in the Army, 26,900 in the Air Force, 18,000 in the Navy, and 1,800 in the Marine Corps, as well as 54,000 reserve forces, mainly in the Army National Guard, and some 80,000 civilians department-wide. Cohen also recommended two more rounds of base closings in 1999 and 2001. The Pentagon hoped to save $15 billion annually over the next few years to make possible the purchase of new equipment and weapon systems without a substantial budget increase above the current level of $250 billion.

===International relations and situations===

Cohen faced the question of the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which he supported and its relationship to Russia. At a summit meeting between President Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin in Helsinki, Finland, in March 1997, Yeltsin acknowledged the inevitability of broader NATO membership. Two months later he agreed, after negotiations with NATO officials, to sign an accord providing for a new permanent council. The council would include Russia, the NATO secretary general, and a representative of the other NATO nations, to function as a forum in which Russia could air a wide range of security issues which it was concerned about. Formal signing of this agreement would pave the way for a July 1997 invitation from NATO to several nations, probably including Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic to join the organization.
The proposed U.S. missile defense system received attention at the Helsinki summit, where Clinton and Yeltsin agreed to an interpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty allowing the United States to proceed with a limited missile defense system currently under development. Specifically, Clinton and Yeltsin agreed to distinguish between a national missile defense system, aimed against strategic weapons, not allowed by the ABMT, and a theater missile defense system to guard against shorter range missile attacks. Some critics thought that any agreement of this kind would place undesirable limits on the development of both theater and strategic missile defenses. The Helsinki meeting also saw progress in arms control negotiations between the United States and Russia, a matter high on Cohen&#x27;s agenda. Yeltsin and Clinton agreed on the need for early Russian ratification of the Second Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START II) and negotiation of START III to make further significant cuts in the strategic nuclear arsenals of both nations.

At least until mid-1998, the continuation of the existing peacekeeping mission involving U.S. forces in Bosnia and the possibility that other such missions would arise worried Cohen, who earlier had expressed reservations about such operations. Humanitarian efforts that did not involve peacekeeping, such as in Rwanda in the recent past, also seemed likely. Other persistent national security problems, including tension with Iraq in the Persian Gulf area, Libya in North Africa, and North Korea in East Asia, could flare up again, as could the Arab–Israeli conflict.

In preparing future budgets, the challenge would be to find the right mix between money for operation and maintenance accounts on the one hand and modernization procurement funds on the other, while facing the prospect of a flat DoD budget of about $250 billion annually for the next decade or so. A relatively new problem that could affect the DoD budget was vertical integration in the defense industry. It occurred on a large scale in the 1990s as mergers of major defense contractors created a few huge dominant companies, particularly in the aerospace industry. They were called vertical because they incorporated most of the elements of the production process, including parts and subcomponents. Cohen and other Pentagon leaders began to worry that vertical integration could reduce competition and in the long run increase the costs of what the Department of Defense had to buy.

===Social issues===
In December 1999, Cohen ordered an immediate review of the Clinton administration&#x27;s controversial &quot;don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell&quot; policy regarding the status and treatment of gays and lesbians in the U.S. military. The order was given shortly after the president said publicly that the policy was not working. During his tenure as Defense Secretary, Cohen also had to address various other social issues, including: the role of women in combat as well as in other military jobs, racism, and sexual harassment.

==Recent years==

After leaving the Pentagon in 2001, Cohen founded &quot;The Cohen Group&quot;, a business consulting firm, with three Pentagon officials, Bob Tyrer, Jim Bodner, and H.K. Park. Cohen was presented with the Woodrow Wilson Award for Public Service by the Woodrow Wilson Center of the Smithsonian Institution on March 7, 2002, in New York City.

On January 5, 2006, he participated in a meeting at the White House of former Secretaries of Defense and State to discuss United States foreign policy with Bush administration officials.

Cohen has written several books, including mysteries, poetry, and (with George Mitchell) an analysis of the Iran–Contra affair. He is a Chairman Emeritus of the US–Taiwan Business Council. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; ran an article entitled &quot;From Public Life to Private Business&quot; about Cohen&#x27;s abrupt transition to the business of Washington lobbying within &quot;weeks of leaving office.&quot; (May 28, 2006). It discussed the affairs of the Cohen Group in greater detail and, while alleging no specific impropriety, took a generally negative view of the former Senator and Secretary of Defense.

On August 21, 2006, Cohen&#x27;s novel, &quot;Dragon Fire&quot;, was released. The plot revolves around a secretary of defense who contends with a potential nuclear threat from a foreign country. In December 2006, he released a memoir with his wife, author Janet Langhart, entitled &quot;Love in Black and White&quot;, a memoir about race, religion, and the love couple shares over similar life circumstances and backgrounds. He then appeared on &quot;The Daily Show&quot; (August 22, 2006) and on &quot;Fox &amp; Friends First&quot; (August 25, 2006), where he said to host Brian Kilmeade, &quot;I think there should be a commitment to universal service. I think that only a few people are really committed to this war against terrorism... We ought to have a real call to national service to commit ourselves to some form of public service...to put us on a war footing mentality.&quot;
BBC News hired Cohen as a world affairs analyst in May 2016. Cohen appears in this capacity on &quot;BBC World News America&quot; and other broadcasts.

Cohen and Madeleine Albright co-chaired a &quot;Genocide Prevention Task Force&quot;. Their appointment was criticized by Harut Sassounian and by the Armenian National Committee of America.

Cohen serves as an advisory board member for the Partnership for a Secure America and is also a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One. In addition, he serves as a board member of the U.S.-China Business Council, having served as vice-chairman between 2011 and 2013, and the U.S.-India Business Council.

During the 2016 presidential election, Cohen joined many Republicans in breaking with party ranks to oppose the candidacy of Republican nominee Donald Trump. He endorsed Democratic nominee former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. In the 2020 election, Cohen again announced his support for the Democratic presidential candidate, endorsing Joe Biden. However, he also endorsed incumbent Republican Maine Senator Susan Collins for re-election.

Cohen, along with all of the living former secretaries of defense, ten in total, published a &quot;Washington Post&quot; op-ed piece in January 2021 telling President Trump not to involve the military in determining the outcome of the 2020 elections.

In July 2022, Cohen helped found a group of U.S. business and policy leaders who share the goal of constructively engaging with China in order to improve U.S.-China relations.

==Personal life==
In 1987, Cohen filed for divorce from his first wife, Diana Dunn, with whom he has two sons, Kevin and Christopher. On February 14, 1996, Cohen and Janet Langhart were married. Langhart is a former model, Boston television personality, and BET correspondent. She was known as the &quot;First Lady of the Pentagon&quot; during Cohen&#x27;s tenure as secretary.

Cohen served as best man in then-Senate Naval Liaison John McCain&#x27;s second wedding (Gary Hart was a groomsman). McCain later became his Senate colleague.

According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Cohen was considered a loner in Congress.

He is a Unitarian Universalist. At one point in 2007, he considered reconciling with Judaism and agreed to once again attend a synagogue.

===Attack at Holocaust Museum===

On the afternoon of June 10, 2009, Cohen was at the U.S. Holocaust Museum waiting for his wife Janet Langhart who was to perform in the world premiere of her one-act play &quot;Anne and Emmett&quot;. The play imagines a conversation between Anne Frank and Emmett Till. While Cohen waited, an elderly man with a slide-action rifle attacked the facility, fatally shooting a security guard—Museum Special Police Officer Stephen Tyrone Johns—before the attacker himself was wounded by the other guards. Cohen and Langhart were not injured, and appeared on CNN that afternoon to tell what they had seen and respond to the shooter&#x27;s racist beliefs. The man was James W. von Brunn, 88, of Annapolis, a longtime &quot;hard-core&quot; white supremacist whose Internet writings contain extensive criticism against Jews and African Americans. He was charged in federal court with first-degree murder and was indicted by a federal grand jury on seven counts, including hate-crime charges. Langhart&#x27;s play had been promoted in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; the week before, and was being presented in honor of the eightieth anniversary of Anne Frank&#x27;s birth.

<text>Love and Rockets (often abbreviated L&amp;R) is a comic book series by the Hernandez brothers: Gilbert, Jaime, and Mario. It was one of the first comic books in the alternative comics movement of the 1980s.

The Hernandez brothers produce stories in the series independently of each other. Gilbert and Jaime produce the majority of the material, and tend to focus on particular casts of characters and settings. Those of Gilbert usually focus on a cast of characters in the fictional Central American village of Palomar; the stories often feature magic realist elements. The &quot;Locas&quot; stories of Jaime center on a social group in Los Angeles, particularly the Latina friends and sometime-lovers Maggie and Hopey.

==Publication history==
The brothers Gilbert, Jaime, and Mario Hernandez self-published the first issue of &quot;Love and Rockets&quot; in 1981. In 1982, Fantagraphics Books republished this issue with a color cover. The series was published at magazine size, larger than typical American comic books. Either Gilbert or Jaime, the series&#x27; main contributors, would provide the front cover for a given issue, and the other the back; they alternated these duties each issue. The first volume ended with the 50th issue in 1996. The second volume ran for twenty issues from 2001 to 2007 in standard US comic book size.
===New stories===
The third series, &quot;Love and Rockets: New Stories&quot;, which ran for eight issues, began in 2008, published annually in 100-page, graphic novel-sized issues:
# &quot;New Stories&quot;, volume 1, 112 pages (2008)
# &quot;New Stories&quot;, volume 2, 104 pages (2009)
# &quot;New Stories&quot;, volume 3, 104 pages (2010)
# &quot;New Stories&quot;, volume 4, 104 pages (2011)
# &quot;New Stories&quot;, volume 5, 96 pages (2012)
# &quot;New Stories&quot;, volume 6, 100 pages (2013)
# &quot;New Stories&quot;, volume 7, 100 pages (2015)
# &quot;New Stories&quot;, volume 8, 100 pages (2016)

In 2012, Jaime Hernandez&#x27;s individual stories from the first two volumes of &quot;New Stories&quot; were collected into a single collection, entitled &quot;God and Science: Return of the Ti-Girls&quot;, which also included about 30 new pages of comics. In 2014, his stories from volumes 3 and 4 were collected into a single collection entitled &quot;The Love Bunglers&quot;. In 2019, two collections were released: &quot;Is This How You See Me?&quot; collecting stories from volumes 5, 7 and 8, as well as issues 1-5 of Vol. IV; and &quot;Tonta&quot;, collecting stories from volumes 5 and 6.

===Volume IV===
In 2016, Fantagraphics began releasing Volume IV of &quot;Love and Rockets&quot;, returning to its original, magazine-sized format. As of February 2025, fifteen issues have been released.

==Overview==
The Hernandez brothers self-published the first issue of &quot;Love and Rockets&quot; in 1981, but since 1982 it has been published by Fantagraphics Books. The brothers sent a copy of their self-published comic to &quot;The Comics Journal&quot;, an imprint of Fantagraphics, for a review. Gary Groth was so impressed with it that the company offered them a publishing deal. The magazine temporarily ceased publication in 1996 after the release of issue #50, while Gilbert and Jaime went on to do separate series involving many of the same characters. However, in 2001 &quot;Los Bros Hernandez&quot; (as they are often referred to) revived the series as &quot;Love and Rockets&quot; Volume 2.

&quot;Love and Rockets&quot; contains several ongoing serial narratives, the most prominent being Gilbert&#x27;s &quot;Palomar&quot; stories and Jaime&#x27;s &quot;Hoppers 13&quot; (aka &quot;Locas&quot;) stories. It also contains one-offs, shorter stories, surrealist jokes, and more.

&quot;Palomar&quot; tells the story of a fictional village in Latin America and its inhabitants. Its vibrant characters and sometimes-fantastic events are sometimes compared to the magical realism literary style of authors such as Gabriel García Márquez and Jorge Luis Borges. The series is also sometimes referred to as &quot;Heartbreak Soup&quot;, after the first story set in Palomar.
&quot;Hoppers 13&quot; follows the tangled lives of a group of primarily chicano characters, from their teenage years in the early days of the California punk scene to the present day. Hoppers, or Huerta, is a fictional city based on the Hernandezes&#x27; home town of Oxnard, California. Two memorable members of Jaime&#x27;s cast are Margarita &quot;Maggie&quot; Luisa Chascarrillo and Esperanza &quot;Hopey&quot; Leticia Glass, whose on-again, off-again romance is a focus for many &quot;Hoppers 13&quot; storylines. The series is also often called &quot;Locas&quot; (Spanish for &quot;crazy women&quot;) because of the many quirky female characters depicted.

The original runs of &quot;Palomar&quot; and &quot;Locas&quot; have each been collected in recent one-volume editions by Fantagraphics (see &quot;Palomar&quot; (graphic novel)), although not all of the stories involving &quot;Locas&quot; and &quot;Palomar&quot; characters are contained in these collections. The original fifty-issue &quot;Love and Rockets Volume One&quot; has also been reprinted in its entirety in both a fifteen-volume paperback library, and more recently a seven-volume mass-market paperback series by Fantagraphics. In addition, several hardcovers collect edited versions of the series tales.

Many attempts have been made to make &quot;L&amp;R&quot; into a movie, or series of movies. The movie rights had been held up in litigation for over 15 years. Gilbert Hernandez publicly announced in Toronto, Ontario in May 2013 that a deal had been struck to make a movie out of his &quot;Palomar&quot; story-line and that he was currently writing the script.

==Characters==
===Jaime===

*Margarita Luisa &quot;Maggie&quot; Chascarrillo: called &quot;Perla&quot; by her family; best friend (and occasional girlfriend) of Hopey; otherwise dates men, most prominently Ray Dominguez. She befriended Hopey in the punk rock scene of their southern Californian hometown and briefly becomes a world-travelling mechanic who goes on science-fiction flavored adventures in the early issues. Maggie and Hopey were ranked #95 on Wizard Magazine&#x27;s 200 Greatest Comic Book Characters of all time.
*Esperanza Leticia &quot;Hopey&quot; Glass: sharp-tongued, wild and adventurous best friend of Maggie. A lesbian who plays bass in a series of punk bands, often touring and furthering her adventures/story.
*Beatríz &quot;Penny Century&quot; García: bombshell friend to Maggie/Hopey and wife of the ridiculously wealthy H.R. Costigan. She aspires to become a superhero.
*Isabel Maria &quot;Izzy&quot; Ortiz Reubens: Friend/mentor to Maggie and a sister of Speedy. Izzy is a writer who suffers a nervous breakdown after a divorce/abortion, becoming a notorious &quot;witch lady&quot; in Hoppers.
*Daphne &quot;Daffy&quot; Matsumoto: a rich, naive young friend of Maggie and Hopey who is a prominent supporting character in the early comics, but later goes off to college.
*Ray Dominguez: one of Maggie&#x27;s boyfriends, a painter. Jaime follows his life from Hoppers to LA.
*Doyle Blackburn: Ray&#x27;s childhood friend, who struggles with a history of violence.
*Rena &quot;La Toña&quot; Titañon and Vicki Glori: championship rivals in the world of women&#x27;s Mexican wrestling. Rena is Maggie&#x27;s friend and (through her many adventures) a loved (and hated) Latin American revolutionary icon. Vicki, later a wrestling coach and league official, is Maggie&#x27;s aunt and her guardian during her Huerta years.
*Danita Lincoln: Maggie&#x27;s coworker at Vandy&#x27;s. She dates Ray after Maggie leaves town, also works as a stripper with Doyle&#x27;s girlfriend Lily.
*H.R. Costigan: horned billionaire who has an open marriage with Penny Century.
*Theresa &quot;Terry&quot; Downe: talented, cold, pretty guitar player who still pines for ex-girlfriend Hopey.
*Rand Race: handsome, world-famous mechanic who hires Maggie and takes her on adventures, oblivious to her crush on him because of his infatuation with former girlfriend Penny Century.
*Eulalio &quot;Speedy&quot; Ortiz: Isabel&#x27;s brother, a member of the local &quot;Hoppers&quot; gang, shared a mutual crush on Maggie until his untimely death. The character is the inspiration for the rock group Speedy Ortiz.
*Esther Chascarillo: Maggie&#x27;s younger sister. Maggie calls her &quot;Esther Babies&quot; or &quot;Babies&quot;. She has a brief relationship with Speedy.

===Gilbert===
*Luba: no-nonsense, hammer-wielding, promiscuous, enormously busty bañadora (bath giver) who rises to mayor of Palomar and has a complex history before coming to town.
*Luba&#x27;s children: Maricela, Guadalupe, Doralis, Casimira, Socorro, Joselito, Concepción.
*Luba&#x27;s lovers: Archie, Khamo, Peter, Jose.
*Ofelia: Luba&#x27;s cousin who helped raise her and her children.
*Heraclio and Carmen: a loving couple who served as central characters for many early Palomar stories.
*Israel, Satch, Vicente, Jesús: Heraclio and Pipo&#x27;s childhood gang of friends.
*Chelo: sheriff of Palomar, midwife who delivered many of the main characters.
*Pipo, Gato, Sergio: beautiful, vain, successful Pipo; her angry but devoted (ex-)husband Gato, and her son (by Manuel) Sergio, a world-famous soccer star.
*Tonantzín Villaseñor: beautiful, hard-partying girl who sells fried babosos (slugs) and later becomes passionately politically active.
*Manuel and Soledad: friends/lovers/rivals, stars of the first Palomar story &quot;Heartbreak Soup&quot;
*Fritz, Petra, Venus: Fritz and Petra are Luba&#x27;s long-lost half-sisters who share her voluptuous figure and penchant for adventure. Venus is Petra&#x27;s precocious, comics-loving daughter.
*María: Luba&#x27;s mother, who abandoned her when she was a toddler. She emigrated to United States and became mother to Fritz and Petra.
*Errata Stigmata: a somewhat surreal character who develops stigmata as a reaction to severe emotional trauma. Her first appearance was in &quot;Radio Zero&quot; and her origin is told in &quot;Tears from Heaven&quot;.

==Landmark stories==

* &quot;Human Diastrophism &quot;(also known as &quot;Blood of Palomar&quot;) – Palomar&#x27;s residents hunt for a serial killer as Luba finds herself helplessly in love with a young construction worker, and hard-partying Tonantzín becomes politically active. Published in book form under the title &quot;Blood of Palomar&quot;.
* &quot;Poison River&quot; – an immensely complex story of Luba&#x27;s pre-Palomar life. Details a plot involving the Mexican government, the mob, trans women, racist comic books, and Luba&#x27;s beauty queen mother and indigenous laborer father.
* &quot;Love and Rockets X&quot; – mostly set outside of Palomar, a young, white garage band named Love and Rockets runs into racism between blacks and whites; as well as clashes between rich and poor through Los Angeles. Set near the time of the 1992 Los Angeles riots.

<text>Jim is a comic book series by Jim Woodring. It began in 1980 as a self-published zine and was picked up by Fantagraphics Books in 1986 after cartoonist Gil Kane introduced Woodring to Fantagraphics co-owner Gary Groth. The publisher released four magazine-sized black-and-white issues starting in September 1987. A comic book-sized continuation, &quot;Jim Volume II&quot;, with some color, began in 1993 and ran for six issues until 1996.

&quot;Jim&quot;, which Woodring described as an &quot;autojournal&quot;, contained comics on a variety of subjects, many based on dreams, as well as surreal drawings and free-form text which resembled Jimantha automatic writing. Besides dreams, the work drew on Woodring&#x27;s childhood experiences, hallucinations, past alcoholism, and Hindu beliefs. It also included stories of recurring Woodring characters such as Pulque (the embodiment of drunkenness), boyhood friends Chip and Monk, and, in &quot;Volume II&quot;, his signature creation Frank.

==Content==

&quot;Jim&quot; is made up of a variety of short comics, text pieces, and artwork. Most of the works are short comics based on Woodring&#x27;s dreams. Some of the pieces are surreal parodies of advertisements in the &quot;Mad&quot; tradition.

==Publication==

The series began as a photocopied 12-page minicomic that Woodring self-published in 1980. The contents were drawn from Woodring&#x27;s autojournal—a journal in which he recorded his dreams in comics, prose, drawings, and paintings. Fantagraphics Books co-owner Gary Groth began publishing the series; the four issues of the first volume ran from 1987 to 1990.

Most of the contents of the first volume were reprinted in the book collection &quot;The Book of Jim&quot; in 1993. A collection of both volumes appeared in 2014 under the title &quot;Jim&quot;, subtitled &quot;Jim Woodring&#x27;s Notorious Autojournal&quot;.

==Reception==

Comics critic Joe McCulloch stated, &quot;What Woodring did better than anyone was promote the idea that the subconscious, the imaginary, and the dreamtime state were perfectly valid terrains for autobiographical exploration&quot; at a time when the confessional work of Justin Green and the mundane stories of Harvey Pekar defined the range of autobiographical comics.

&quot;Jim&quot; ranked No. 71 on &quot;The Comics Journal&quot;″s list of the hundred greatest English-language comics of the 20th century.

<text>Frank is a cartoon character created by American cartoonist Jim Woodring. Frank is a bipedal, bucktoothed animal of uncertain species whom Woodring described as a &quot;generic anthropomorph&quot;. The stories and supporting characters appear in a world called the Unifactor.

==Overview==
Frank is a bipedal anthropomorphic animal character of uncertain species—what his creator Jim Woodring describes as a &quot;generic anthropomorph&quot;. The surreal, symbolic, and pantomimic stories take place in an idyllic world of mysterious forces called the Unifactor. Woodring describes Frank as &quot;11 years old ... covered with short, dense fur like a mole&#x27;s ... innocent but not noble ... mortal and must someday die&quot;. His pets and protectors Pupshaw and Pushpaw accompany him on his wanderings through the Unifactor, where he encounters colorful, top-shaped jivas, geometrically shaped Jerry Chickens, the diabolic moon-faced Whim, his &quot;Faux Pa&quot; (or &quot;false father&quot;), and the avaricious Manhog. Frank is prey to his temptations and subverts expectations by not always triumphing; despite the consequences he undergoes, he never learns from his experiences.

==Publication history==
The first published drawing of Frank was the cover of &quot;Jim&quot; #4, and the first comic story featuring the character was in &quot;Buzz&quot; #2, the Kitchen Sink Press-published comics anthology. Frank was a regular feature in the &quot;Tantalizing Stories&quot; series by Woodring and Mark Martin, and dominated that comic&#x27;s inaugural special issue, &quot;Tantalizing Stories Presents Frank in the River&quot;. When &quot;Tantalizing Stories&quot; ended Frank became a recurring feature in &quot;Jim Volume II&quot;; in 1996 he got his own self-titled comic series which ran for four issues. A long Frank story titled &quot;Frank&#x27;s Real Pa&quot; also appeared in 1994&#x27;s &quot;The Millennium Whole Earth Catalog&quot; and was later released as a comic book. Two book collections of the Frank stories were released in 1994 and 1997. In 2003 &quot;The Frank Book&quot; collected nearly all of the previously published Frank stories as well as the conclusion of &quot;Frank&#x27;s High Horse&quot;, a serialized story that had been left unfinished at the end of the &quot;Frank&quot; comic book. In 2005 a standalone, limited-release comic &quot;The Lute String&quot; was released, and beginning in 2010 two full-length graphic novels featuring Frank were published.

===&quot;Frank&quot; series===

From 1996 to 2001 Fantagraphics put out four issues of Woodring&#x27;s series &quot;Frank&quot;. All but the first issue included one color story. The ending to &quot;Frank&#x27;s High Horse&quot;—the first two installments of which appeared in the last two issues of &quot;Frank&quot;—was only published when Fantagraphics put out the deluxe &quot;The Frank Book&quot; in 2003 (it was later included in &quot;The Portable Frank&quot; as well).

==Characters==
The stories involving these characters occur in the surreal world Woodring calls the Unifactor.
;Frank:A bipedal, bucktoothed animal of uncertain species with a short tail, described by Woodring as a &quot;generic anthropomorph&quot; and &quot;naive but not innocent&quot;, &quot;completely naive, capable of sinning by virtue of not knowing what he&#x27;s really about.&quot; The character design is reminiscent of those found in American animated shorts from the 1920s and 1930s, such as from Fleischer Studios. Usually he appears in black and white, but when he appears in color his fur is purple.
;Manhog:An &quot;unholy hybrid of human ambivalence&quot;. Woodring says he sympathizes with Manhog: &quot;He is very much at a disadvantage because of his looks and his weak character. He’d be good if he could, and when given a chance, he &quot;is&quot; good. But he has no discipline, no grit, no ability to select a better path and stick with it.&quot; Earlier, however, Woodring had said he was &quot;completely craven, incapable of a good act.&quot; His acts often led to a very nasty, bloody end.
;Whim: A perpetually smiling, devilish character who inhabits a body with a moon-shaped head, &quot;the spirit of politics&quot;. When the body is destroyed, it turns out that Whim is actually a &quot;tiny, malicious worm&quot; that is able to crawl inside others (including Frank) and has the power of transformation. According to Woodring, &quot;[h]e’s a conniver, a user. His body can be smashed, but he always gets a new one. Much in the same way that politicians are more or less interchangeable. They surrender their individuality to be part of that hideous game.&quot;
;The Jerry Chickens:Mischievous chicken-like characters, each a different geometric shape.
;Pupshaw:A female canine-like &quot;godling&quot; companion whom Frank bought from one of the Jerry Chickens in an early story. Testy in nature, but a faithful protector to Frank.
;Pushpaw:Pupshaw&#x27;s somewhat simple-minded but plucky and good-natured mate and male counterpart.
;Lucky:A man with a grotesquely elongated, pendulous proboscis for a mouth. His feet are wrapped in rags and he wears a nightgown. He is a born drudge taking on the most menial work (the best job was being a delivery man in the story that introduced Pupshaw). In another story, he is amputating his proboscis, a painful task.
;Frank&#x27;s Pas:Identical creatures that resemble older, less anthropomorphic versions of Frank. One of them (Frank&#x27;s &quot;Real Pa&quot;) is Frank&#x27;s father; the other is thus his &quot;Faux Pa&quot;. Frank will look like them when he grows old. They are physically identical to one another except for one tiny difference. The Faux Pa enthusiastically embraces his role as a father figure and gives Frank the worst possible advice.

==Influence and recognition==
While the Frank stories have never been a mainstream success, they have attracted an avid cult following and have been extensively merchandised as t-shirts, action figures and other things. Many alternative cartoonists (Dave Cooper, for example) have cited the Frank stories as an inspiration, and mainstream comic book creators have also expressed their admiration, with Alan Moore including an image of Frank as part of an alternate universe in the pages of his superhero series &quot;1963&quot;. Various artists have created short Frank animations based on Woodring&#x27;s original tales, nine of which were collected on the 2007 DVD release, &quot;Visions of Frank: Short Films by Japan&#x27;s Most Audacious Animators&quot;.

Woodring has won multiple Harvey Awards for his Frank stories, including the Best Single Issue or Story award for &quot;Frank in the River&quot; in 1993. In 1999 &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; ranked the Frank stories #55 in its list of the 100 best comics of the century.

Frank is also referenced on the Channel 4 sitcom &quot;The IT Crowd&quot;. A color poster of Frank is prominently displayed on the wall behind the desk of main character Roy.

Yo La Tengo bassist James McNew has a tattoo of the characters Pupshaw and Pushpaw on his arm.

<doc id="375205" wikidata="Q2580010" url="?curid=375205" title="Faygo">
<text>Faygo Beverages, Inc., is a soft drink company headquartered in Detroit, Michigan. The beverages produced by the company, branded as Faygo or Faygo Pop, are distributed in the Midwestern, Mid-Atlantic, and Central Southern regions of the United States, as well as southern and western Canada. Faygo Beverages, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of the National Beverage Corporation started in Detroit, Michigan in 1907 as Feigenson Brothers Bottling Works.

==History==

Faygo was founded in Detroit, Michigan, in November 1907, as Feigenson Brothers Bottle Works by Russian baker immigrants Ben and Perry Feigenson. The original flavors of Faygo (fruit punch, strawberry, and grape) were based on cake frosting recipes used by the Feigensons in Russia. Initially, the brothers used a horse-drawn wagon for deliveries and lived above the bottling plant.

As the business grew over the next 10 years, the Feigensons were able to purchase houses, hire their first employee, and acquire a second wagon and horse for deliveries. More flavors were added to the lineup, including Sassafras Soda and Lithiated Lemon. The brothers&#x27; success also allowed them to build a new plant on Detroit&#x27;s Beaubien Street.

In 1921, as the company expanded, they decided the brand name &quot;Feigenson Brothers&quot; was too long and changed it to Faygo. The brothers bought their first delivery truck in 1922, and started home deliveries the following year. New flavors in the 1920s were a vanilla flavored soft drink, a seltzer water, &quot;Ace Hi&quot; (similar in flavor to Nehi), and Rock and Rye (named after a Prohibition Era drink). The company opened its currently operating bottling plant in 1935 on Gratiot Avenue in Detroit. The company briefly entered into beer production.

The brothers ran the company until the mid-1940s, when they turned it over to their sons. In 1956, the company created a series of radio and television advertisements featuring a fictional cowboy called the Faygo Kid, who was portrayed in animation for television commercials for Faygo Old-Fashioned Root Beer. Jim Henson&#x27;s Muppets, Inc. produced a small series of ads for Faygo strawberry soda starring the Muppet characters Wilkins and Wontkins (best known as the spokes-characters for the Washington, D.C.–based Wilkins Coffee). Three ads are known to exist.
Because the drink had a limited shelf life, the company sold its products only in Michigan until the late 1950s. Company chemists later resolved this issue by installing a filtration system to remove impurities from the manufacturing plant&#x27;s water system. In the 1960s, the soda&#x27;s regional popularity expanded when the company began advertising during broadcasts of Detroit Tigers games. With the Tiger ads reaching beyond the Faygo market area at the time and the inability to cancel the ads, Faygo shipped products to the wholesalers&#x27; warehouses. This increased company sales from $6 million in 1966 to $20.4 million in 1971. Advertisements produced in the 1970s featured &quot;everyday people&quot; on a Boblo Boat singing the &quot;Faygo Boat Song&quot;.

The company introduced a low-calorie version of their products in the 1960s called Ohana. This sub-line soon became a majority of company sales. In 1961, the Royal Line was launched as a premium product line. The juice extract used to produce the initial run of Royal Hawaiian Pineapple Orange was not sterilized and became rancid, causing a buildup of gases such that, after hitting store shelves, the bottles exploded. The soda was recalled and Dole gave Faygo enough sterilized juice to offset the company&#x27;s losses. Six other flavors also entered into production in the 1960s. The original strawberry flavor from 1907 was renamed Redpop in the late 1960s.

With Michigan&#x27;s beverage container deposit law passed in 1978, Faygo thought people would prefer returnable cans instead of glass. With this choice being incorrect, the company had a hard time making the switch back to bottles, cutting into profits for several years.

Assessing the industry and the second generation&#x27;s pending retirement, the company was put up for sale. TreeSweet Products Corp. bought the company from the Feigenson family in early 1986 for $105 million. TreeSweet in turn sold the company to National Beverage Corp. a year later in 1987. In the 1980s, they introduced flavored carbonated water.

Faygo expanded in 1996 with a non-carbonated drink line, again named Ohana, which included punches, iced tea and lemonade. In 2007, Faygo celebrated its 100th anniversary with a new flavor and contests for label design. Ten thousand entries were received and a fourth-grade Ohio teacher won with Centennial Soda. In March 2014, the company introduced its ginger ale, Faygo Gold, rivaling cross town company Vernors&#x27; flagship drink.

==Reception==
Faygo was ranked the best-tasting American root beer in the September 2009 issue of &quot;Bon Appétit&quot;, calling it &quot;dry and crisp, with a frothy head, a good bite and a long finish&quot;.

==In popular culture==
The Detroit hip hop group Insane Clown Posse references Faygo in several songs and sprays live audiences with &quot;Faygo showers&quot;. The band has expressed interest in collaborating on limited edition product runs with the company, but Faygo has not reciprocated this interest as they desire to &quot;keep a healthy distance&quot; from the group.

<text>James William Woodring (born October 11, 1952) is an American cartoonist, fine artist, writer and toy designer. He is best known for the dream-based comics he published in his magazine &quot;Jim&quot;, and as the creator of the anthropomorphic cartoon character Frank, who has appeared in a number of short comics and graphic novels.

Since he was a child, Woodring has experienced hallucinatory &quot;apparitions&quot;, which have inspired much of his surreal work. He keeps an &quot;autojournal&quot; of his dreams, some of which have formed the basis of some of his comics. His most famous creation is fictional—the pantomime comics set in the universe he calls the Unifactor, usually featuring Frank. These stories incorporate a highly personal symbolism largely inspired by Woodring&#x27;s belief in Vedanta from Hindu philosophy. He also does a large amount of surrealist painting, and has been the writer on a number of comics from licensed franchises published by Dark Horse and others.

Woodring identified &quot;Bimbo&#x27;s Initiation&quot; as &quot;one of the things that laid the foundation for my life&#x27;s philosophy.&quot;

Woodring has won or been nominated for a number of awards. He placed twice on &quot;The Comics Journal&quot;&#x27;s list of the 100 best comics of the century, with the &quot;Frank&quot; stories ranked #55, and &quot;The Book of Jim&quot; ranked #71.

==Biography==
The elder of two children, Woodring was born in Los Angeles. He suffered from hallucinations (which he called &quot;apparitions&quot;) of floating, gibbering faces over his bed (among other visions) when he was a child, and &quot;was obsessed with death at a tender age&quot; and was afraid his parents would come into his bedroom and kill him. He had behavioral problems, finding himself unable to stop himself from doing things he knew he should not be doing, which he says he did not bring in line until he got married. Woodring has also been diagnosed with prosopagnosia.

He graduated from high school in 1970 and went to Glendale Junior College for about two months. While there,

Woodring dropped out of college and spent the next year and a half as a garbage man. During this time he developed a serious drinking problem, which lasted about eight years. He eventually quit drinking because he felt it was interfering with his growth as an artist.

===Animation industry===
In 1979 he was persuaded by his best friend John Dorman to take work as an artist with the Ruby-Spears animation studio. He did &quot;[s]toryboards during the production season and presentation work during the off-season.&quot; He did work for the cartoon shows &quot;Mister T&quot;, &quot;Rubik the Amazing Cube&quot;, and &quot;Turbo Teen&quot;, and he has often said that these were the worst cartoons ever produced. At that time, he formed friendships with and was somewhat mentored by celebrated comic book artists Gil Kane and Jack Kirby, who were both disgruntled with the comics business and were working in animation at the time.

===Comics===
While working at Ruby-Spears he began self-publishing &quot;Jim&quot;, an anthology of comics, dream art and free-form writing which he described as an &quot;autojournal&quot;. In 1986, Woodring was introduced by Gil Kane to Gary Groth of Fantagraphics Books. &quot;Jim&quot; was published as a regular series by Fantagraphics starting in 1986, to critical acclaim if less than spectacular sales, and Woodring became a full-time cartoonist. &quot;Frank&quot;, a wordless surrealist series which began as an occasional feature within &quot;Jim&quot;, became his best-known work, eventually spinning off into its own series in 1996. Most of the content of the first of the two volumes of &quot;Jim&quot; were collected as &quot;The Book of Jim&quot; in 1993, which was subsequently ranked as #71 on The Comics Journal&#x27;s100 best comics of the century list.

Woodring created a short-lived comics series for children, &quot;Tantalizing Stories&quot;, with Mark Martin. This was the place in which his character, Frank, first featured prominently, in stories that &quot;have a dreamlike flow and an internal logic to them&quot; written in a &quot;symbolic visual language&quot; that is &quot;defined by thick, unforgiving cartoon lines that marry Walt Kelly with Salvador Dalí.&quot;

Most of the Frank stories have been done in black and white, but a number are notable for being in (usually painted) full color. In particular, Woodring was nominated for &quot;Best Colorist&quot; at the 1993 Eisner Awards for the story &quot;Frank in the River&quot;. &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; ranked the &quot;Frank&quot; stories #55 in its list of the 100 best comics of the century.

He has also worked as a freelance illustrator and comics writer, adapting the film &quot;Freaks&quot; with F. Solano Lopez for Fantagraphics and writing comics based on &quot;Aliens&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot; for Dark Horse.

Woodring produced a new &quot;Frank&quot; book in 2005 (&quot;The Lute String&quot;) and in 2010 his first graphic novel-length &quot;Frank&quot; book, &quot;Weathercraft&quot;, which found itself on a number of &quot;Best of 2010&quot; lists. This was followed up with another, &quot;Congress of the Animals&quot;, in May 2011. Woodring says that, while he had been away from comics, he built up a backlog of new stories, and he intends to complete a total of four 100-page books like &quot;Weathercraft&quot; and &quot;Congress of the Animals&quot;, and then return to the types of stories he had done in &quot;Jim&quot;.

===Other projects===
In June 2010, Scott Eder Gallery in Brooklyn featured a solo show of Jim&#x27;s &quot;Weathercraft&quot; art.

A 48-minute DVD called &quot;Visions of Frank: Short Films by Japan&#x27;s Most Audacious Animators&quot; was released by Japan&#x27;s PressPop Music in 2005. It is a collection of nine animated shorts created between 2000 and 2005, each produced by a different artist or team interpreting a different &quot;Frank&quot; work. Aside from designing the packaging, Woodring had no input into the production of these films, leaving their interpretation entirely up to the animators.

In 2010, a 93-minute documentary was released entitled &quot;The Lobster and the Liver: The Unique World of Jim Woodring&quot;, directed by Jonathan Howells.

As of April 2011, Woodring keeps an infrequently updated blog, where he sometimes posts panels from works-in-progress, including &quot;Weathercraft&quot; and &quot;Congress of the Animals&quot;, as well as other projects, such as new paintings and the construction and demonstration of a working seven-foot dip pen.

Woodring and his wife, Mary, have a son named Maxfield, who has published a graphic novel of his own titled &quot;OAK&quot;, printed with a grant from the Xeric Foundation, a page from which was featured on November 18, 2012 as an entry for Woodring&#x27;s blog.

In October, 2022 woodring released his 400 page comics odyssey entitled &quot;One Beautiful Spring Day&quot;, featuring eccentric woodcut-style panels with clean black outlines and hatched shadows.

==Recurring characters==
=== &quot;Frank&quot; characters ===

The stories involving these characters occur in the surreal world Woodring calls the Unifactor.
;Frank:A bipedal, bucktoothed animal of uncertain species with a short tail, described by Woodring as a &quot;generic anthropomorph&quot; and &quot;naive but not innocent&quot;, &quot;completely naive, capable of sinning by virtue of not knowing what he&#x27;s really about.&quot; The character design is reminiscent of old American animated shorts from the 1920s and 1930s, such as from Fleischer Studios. Usually he appears in black and white, but when he appears in colour his fur is purple.

=== Others ===
;Jim: The artist himself featured prominently in most of his early dream comics.
;Pulque:A perpetually drunken, man-sized, Spanish-speaking frog-creature. Pulque inexplicably hangs around with a group of suburban American children, despite the fact that he and the children cannot understand each other and are drawn in markedly different styles.
;Chip and Monk:Boyhood friends.
;Big Red:A large street cat who hunts and kills with an appropriately cat-like gusto. This is made chilling by Red&#x27;s dialogue with his prey: &quot;I&#x27;ll kill you,&quot; shrieks a terrified possum, &quot;I killed the old owl!&quot; Red mutters an amused response, &quot;That&#x27;s nice,&quot; as he moves in for the kill.

==Themes and motifs==
;Dreams: Woodring keeps a dream journal and has turned several of these dreams into comics, which he &quot;tr[ies] to make it as verbatim as possible.&quot; Most of these were published in &quot;Jim&quot;. Since the mid-1990s he has turned away from stories explicitly based on real dreams, later saying: &quot;I got sick of drawing myself. I don&#x27;t ever want to draw myself again.&quot;. He has since focused primarily on stories based in the Unifactor, the surreal &quot;Frank&quot; universe.

;Frogs : feature prominently in Woodring&#x27;s comics, and their symbolism seems to change from story to story. Often they are spiritually-minded but rather pompous creatures, but they can sometimes be sinister and alien. At other times, they are &quot;average joes&quot;, struggling to protect their homes or their families from predators. A giant cartoon painting of a frog leaning against a wall made up the cover of the first issue of &quot;Jim&quot; in 1986, and frogs framed the cover of &quot;Weathercraft&quot; in 2010.

;Jivas : appear frequently in Woodring&#x27;s autobiographical dream comics and in &quot;Frank,&quot; where they appear as floating, flexible, colorful, occasionally radiant bulbous spindles resembling children&#x27;s tops, and are both cognizant and motile, and neither vaporous nor altogether benevolent. Woodring has occasionally referred to them as &quot;angels&quot; and &quot;conditioned souls&quot;. In some &quot;Jim&quot; stories the Jivas can speak, and in one he accidentally pierces one&#x27;s skin and it deflates like a balloon.

;The Unifactor : The world in which Frank and associated characters appear, &quot;a world where concepts like justice and logic read as alien&quot;, &quot;a picturesque but occasionally sinister world inhabited by alien plantlife and mischievous creatures, dream-logic and unknowable forces&quot;.The Unifactor functions under its own internal logic; death, destruction and mutilation in one story do not necessarily have any bearing on subsequent storiesManhog removes the skin from his own leg in &quot;Manhog Beyond the Face&quot;, which seems to leave no mark on him in other stories; and in a single issue of &quot;Jim&quot;, he has all his limbs, skin, and most of his facial features removed, becoming a mutilated jiva-like figure in one story, only to reappear later on in a separate story, apparently &quot;normal&quot;, only to be killed, stuffed and sewn back up again. On the positive side, however, Manhog, due to a chain of events started by a Jerry-Chicken, becomes civilized, cultured and the owner of a stately manor. This has no effect on his savage bestial nature in following stories.

==Other work==
As a comics historian, Woodring has written about T. S. Sullivant and other classic cartoonists for &quot;The Comics Journal&quot;. He also interviewed cartoonist Jack Davis for the publication.

Woodring illustrated Microsoft&#x27;s Comic Chat program, an IRC client previously packaged with multiple versions of Internet Explorer.

He illustrated the cover of The Grifters&#x27; 1996 album &quot;Ain&#x27;t My Lookout&quot;. He also illustrated the front cover, endpapers and the song &quot;Toy Boy&quot; in singer-songwriter Mika&#x27;s 2009 EP &quot;Songs for Sorrow&quot;.

For years, Woodring ran ads for &quot;Jimland Novelties&quot; in the back of his comics. These toys, books and oddities included a kit to make a frog&#x27;s (severed) legs swim by hooking them up to a little motor, and another kit for leaving Woodring&#x27;s own fingerprints around your home. For a time, Woodring was sending his readers free drawings, his &quot;jiva portraits&quot; of what he imagined their souls looked like. A sample of the &quot;Jimland Novelties&quot; pages can be glimpsed in the back of &quot;The Book of Jim&quot;.

===Collaborations===
In 1991 and 1992, Woodring illustrated the Harvey Pekar stories &quot;Snake&quot;, &quot;Watching the Media Watchers&quot; and &quot;Sheiboneth Beis Hamikdosh&quot; for &quot;American Splendor&quot;. and for &quot;Introducing Dennis Eichhorn&quot;, which appeared in &quot;Real Stuff&quot; #1.

Woodring did the artwork for Dennis Eichhorn&#x27;s &quot;The Meaning of Life&quot; in &quot;Real Stuff&quot; #3, and contributed the cover to issue #8.

Woodring wrote the scripts for the comic-book adaptation of &quot;Freaks&quot;, illustrated by Francisco Solano Lopez and colored by Mary Woodring.

In the 1990s, Woodring wrote a number of stories for Dark Horse Comics that were based on the &quot;Aliens&quot; franchise. The stories were illustrated by Kilian Plunkett, Jason Green and Francisco Solano Lopez, and have been collected as &quot;Aliens: Labyrinth&quot; in 1997 and &quot;Aliens: Kidnapped&quot; in 1999.

Released in November 2013, Woodring created an interpretative story based on artwork from Yo La Tengo&#x27;s album &quot;Fade&quot;. The resultant product is a set of three soft vinyl figurines (sculpted by Tomohiro Yasui) representing the band members; they come with a DVD featuring an animated short (5:20 minutes) called &quot;The Tree&quot;, featuring music by Yo La Tengo (plus a &quot;bonus comic&quot; from Woodring is included with the rest).

===Toys===
Woodring&#x27;s strange toy creations have been sold in vending machines in Japan and are available in American comics shops. In a 2002 interview with &quot;The Comics Journal&quot;, Woodring said that he was gradually leaving comics behind because they simply were not lucrative enough, and he was increasingly concentrating on individual paintings. He made his return to comics at the turn of the decade, however, producing two new graphic novels.

==Style==
===Stories===

Woodring&#x27;s work often has a nightmarish surreal quality. Woodring told &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; that under the right circumstances he is capable of &quot;hallucinating like mad.&quot; The desire to draw something that &quot;wasn&#x27;t there&quot; was always of &quot;paramount importance&quot; to Woodring.

===Artwork===

Woodring&#x27;s drawing style in the black-and-white &quot;Frank&quot; stories has often been mistaken for brushwork due to the greatly varying thickness of the linework typical of brush cartooning, but he has insisted, and indeed demonstrated, that it is done with a Brause #29 Index Finger dip pen. He has said, &quot;pen and ink for me is the &quot;ne plus ultra&quot; of drawing.&quot;

In his &quot;Frank&quot; stories, Woodring employed a style that combined 1920s–30s Fleischer Studios-like character designs with an Eastern architectural and design flavor. He also makes heavy use of a distinctive controlled wavy line that adds contour and texture to the backgrounds, which has become his trademark.

Woodring also works in charcoal and paint (mostly in watercolor). A selection of these works (mostly charcoal) appeared in the collection &quot;Seeing Things&quot; in 2005.

==Beliefs==
Woodring is a follower of Vedanta, and aspects of this philosophy often appear in his stories. He says, &quot;Meditation is the uber-skill. It ought to be taught in elementary school.&quot;

==Artistic influences==
===Cartooning===
Woodring singles out for praise the cartoon work of Mark Martin, Justin Green, Rachel Bell, John Dorman, Mark Newgarden, Roy Thomkins, Peter Bagge, Terry LaBan, Chester Brown, Seth, Joe Matt, Robert Crumb, Charles Burns, Gilbert Hernandez, Jaime Hernandez, Lat, Gil Kane and Jack Kirby (Woodring inked and colored Kirby&#x27;s designs during his time at Ruby-Spears). He considers Kim Deitch to be &quot;the most under-appreciated comic artist working today.&quot;

===Art===
Harry McNaught, Boris Artzybasheff, 17th Century Dutch painting, Ingres, Salvador Dalí

===Literature===
Woodring has read widely in literature. &quot;Under the Volcano&quot; by Malcolm Lowry and &quot;Les Misérables&quot; by Victor Hugo are two works that he has mentioned more than once in interviews.

===Music===
Woodring frequently mentions Captain Beefheart, Bill Frisell as musical favorites, but also &quot;schmaltzy, potent, cheap pop music with strings from the late 50s and early 60s, the Theme from &quot;A Summer Place&quot;, Holiday for Strings, the theme from Midnight Cowboy...that sort of dreck.&quot; He also listens to a lot of classical musichis brother, with whom he&#x27;s close, is a classical musician and has introduced him to much of what he listens to.

==Critical reception==
Reaction amongst critics and fellow artists has generally been quite positive, despite low sales.

===Awards===
In December 2006, he became one of the first group of United States Artists Fellows. His work was featured prominently at the Centre National de la Bande Dessinée et de l’Image in Angoulême, France as part of the international comics festival held there in January 2007. The following year, Woodring received an Inkpot Award at the 2008 San Diego Comic-Con, and he was awarded an Artist Trust/Washington State Arts Commission Fellowship in the fall of 2008. In November 2014 he received the Lynd Ward Prize from the Pennsylvania Center for the Book, for his graphic novel &quot;Fran&quot;.

==Collected works==
Woodring has published a large number of short works in diverse periodicals and anthologies. Below is a list of collections of some of those works, but a large amount has yet to be collected in book form. As of April 2011, many of these works are out of print.

<text>In set theory, one can define a successor operation on cardinal numbers in a similar way to the successor operation on the ordinal numbers. The cardinal successor coincides with the ordinal successor for finite cardinals, but in the infinite case they diverge because every infinite ordinal and its successor have the same cardinality (a bijection can be set up between the two by simply sending the last element of the successor to 0, 0 to 1, etc., and fixing ω and all the elements above; in the style of Hilbert&#x27;s Hotel Infinity). Using the von Neumann cardinal assignment and the axiom of choice (AC), this successor operation is easy to define: for a cardinal number &quot;κ&quot; we have

:formula_1 ,

where ON is the class of ordinals. That is, the successor cardinal is the cardinality of the least ordinal into which a set of the given cardinality can be mapped one-to-one, but which cannot be mapped one-to-one back into that set.

That the set above is nonempty follows from Hartogs&#x27; theorem, which says that for any well-orderable cardinal, a larger such cardinal is constructible. The minimum actually exists because the ordinals are well-ordered. It is therefore immediate that there is no cardinal number in between &quot;κ&quot; and &quot;κ&quot;+. A successor cardinal is a cardinal that is &quot;κ&quot;+ for some cardinal &quot;κ&quot;. In the infinite case, the successor operation skips over many ordinal numbers; in fact, every infinite cardinal is a limit ordinal. Therefore, the successor operation on cardinals gains a lot of power in the infinite case (relative the ordinal successorship operation), and consequently the cardinal numbers are a very &quot;sparse&quot; subclass of the ordinals. We define the sequence of alephs (via the axiom of replacement) via this operation, through all the ordinal numbers as follows:

:formula_2
:formula_3

and for &quot;λ&quot; an infinite limit ordinal,

:formula_4

If &quot;β&quot; is a successor ordinal, then formula_5 is a successor cardinal. Cardinals that are not successor cardinals are called limit cardinals; and by the above definition, if &quot;λ&quot; is a limit ordinal, then formula_6 is a limit cardinal.

The standard definition above is restricted to the case when the cardinal can be well-ordered, i.e. is finite or an aleph. Without the axiom of choice, there are cardinals that cannot be well-ordered. Some mathematicians have defined the successor of such a cardinal as the cardinality of the least ordinal that cannot be mapped one-to-one into a set of the given cardinality. That is:

:formula_7

which is the Hartogs number of &quot;κ&quot;.

<text>A medal or medallion is a small portable artistic object, a thin disc, normally of metal, carrying a design, usually on both sides. They typically have a commemorative purpose of some kind, and many are presented as awards. They may be intended to be worn, suspended from clothing or jewellery in some way, although this has not always been the case. They may be struck like a coin by dies or die-cast in a mould.

A medal may be awarded to a person or organisation as a form of recognition for sporting, military, scientific, cultural, academic, or various other achievements. Military awards and decorations are more precise terms for certain types of state decoration. Medals may also be created for sale to commemorate particular individuals or events, or as works of artistic expression in their own right. In the past, medals commissioned for an individual, typically with their portrait, were often used as a form of diplomatic or personal gift, with no sense of being an award for the conduct of the recipient.

An artist who creates medals or medallions is called a &quot;medalist&quot;. Medals have long been popular collectible items, and in numismatics form a class called either exonumia or militaria. 

In the proper use of the term, medallions are larger, starting at perhaps four inches across, and are, as such, usually too large to be worn very comfortably, though in colloquial use, &quot;medallion&quot; is often used to refer to a medal used as the pendant of a necklace (as in the medallion man fashion style of the 1960s and 1970s), or for other types of medals. Medallions may also be called &quot;table medals&quot; because they are too large to be worn and can only be displayed on a wall, table top, desk, or cabinet.

==Main types==
Numismatists divide medals into at least seven classes:
:* Awards: awarded to a person or organization as a form of recognition for sporting, military, scientific, cultural, academic, or various other achievements. Military awards and decorations are more precise terms for certain types of state decoration. Military decorations are often in shapes such as crosses or stars, but are still loosely called &quot;medals&quot;, as in the star-shaped American Medal of Honor. 
:* Commemoratives: created for sale to commemorate particular individuals or events, or as works of medallic art in their own right.
:* Souvenirs: similar to a commemorative, but more focused on a place or event like state fairs, expositions, museums, historic sites, etc., and frequently found for sale within their respective souvenir shops. 
:* Religious: devotional medals may be worn for religious reasons. 
:* Portraits: produced to immortalize a person with their portrait; European portrait medallions sometimes bear the Latin word &quot;aetatis&quot; (&quot;of his age&quot;) to describe the depicted person&#x27;s age at the time of the portrait.
:* Artistic: made purely as an art object. Plaquettes are often of this type. 
:* Society Medals: made for societies used as a badge or token of membership.

==Etymology==
First attested in English in 1578, the word &quot;medal&quot; is derived from the Middle French &quot;médaille&quot;, itself from Italian &quot;medaglia&quot;, and ultimately from the post-classical Latin &quot;medalia&quot;, meaning a coin worth half a denarius. The word &quot;medallion&quot; (first attested in English in 1658) has the same ultimate derivation, but this time through the Italian &quot;medaglione&quot;, meaning &quot;large medal&quot;. There are two theories as for the etymology of the word &quot;medalia&quot;: the first being that the Latin &quot;medalia&quot; itself is derived from the adjective &quot;medialis&quot; meaning &quot;medial&quot; or &quot;middle&quot;; the second being that &quot;medaglia&quot; comes from the Vulgar Latin &quot;metallea (moneta)&quot;, meaning &quot;metal (coin)&quot; and that from Latin &quot;metallum&quot;, which is the latinisation of the Greek μέταλλον (&quot;metallon&quot;), &quot;a mine&quot;.

==Features==
Traditionally medals are stamped with dies on a durable metal flan or planchet, or cast from a mould. The imagery, which usually includes lettering, is typically in low relief, albeit often higher than on coins: Limited-edition medals may be struck in repeated impacts allowing more metal displacement than in coins produced for mass circulation in a single impact. Circular medals are most common; rectangular medals are often known as plaquettes, and square medals as klippe. The &quot;decoration&quot; types often use other shapes, especially crosses and stars. These in particular usually come with a suspension loop, and a wide coloured ribbon with a clip at the top, for attaching to clothing worn on the chest.

The main or front surface of a medal is termed the obverse, and may contain a portrait, pictorial scene, or other image along with an inscription. The reverse, or back surface of the medal, is not always used and may be left blank or may contain a secondary design. It is not uncommon to find only an artistic rendering on the obverse, while all details and other information for the medal are inscribed on the reverse. The rim is found only occasionally employed to display an inscription such as a motto, privy mark, engraver symbol, assayer&#x27;s marking, or a series number.

Medals that are intended to be hung from a ribbon also include a small suspension piece at the crest with which to loop a suspension ring through. It is through the ring that a ribbon is run or folded so the medal may hang pendent. Medals pinned to the breast use only a small cut of ribbon that is attached to a top bar where the brooch pin is affixed. Top bars may be hidden under the ribbon so they are not visible, be a plain device from which the ribbon attaches, or may even be decorative to complement the design on the medal. Some top bars are elaborate and contain a whole design unto themselves.

Bronze has been the most common material used to create medals, due to its fair price range, durability, ease with which to work when casting, and the ample availability. However, a wide range of other media have also been used. Rarer metals have been employed, such as silver, platinum, and gold, when wishing to add value beyond the mere artistic depiction, as well as base metals and alloys such as copper, brass, iron, aluminum, lead, zinc, nickel, and pewter. Medals that are made with inexpensive material might be gilded, silver-plated, chased, or finished in a variety of other ways to improve their appearance. Medals have also been made of rock, gemstone, ivory, glass, porcelain, terra cotta, coal, wood, paper, enamel, lacquerware, and plastics. Today, a large number of common events use zinc alloys for their medals, due to their low melting point, ease of casting and low price.

==History==
The first known instance of a medal being awarded comes from the historian Josephus who, writing long after the event, accounts that in the second century BCE, the High Priest Jonathan led the Hebrews in aid of Alexander Balas, and that in return for this, Alexander &quot;...sent to Jonathan... honorary awards, as a golden button, which it is custom to give the king&#x27;s kinsmen.&quot; Roman emperors used both military awards of medals, and political gifts of medallions that were like very large coins, usually in gold or silver, and die-struck like coins. Both these and actual golden coins were often set as pieces of jewellery, worn by both sexes.

The bracteate is a type of thin gold medal, usually plain on the reverse, found in Northern Europe from the so-called &quot;Dark Ages&quot; or Migration Period. They often have suspension loops and were clearly intended to be worn on a chain as jewellery. They imitate, at a distance, Roman imperial coins and medallions, but have the heads of gods, animals, or other designs. The Liudhard medalet, produced around AD 600 in Anglo-Saxon England, is an isolated example, known from a single copy, of a Christian medal, featuring an inscription naming Liudhard (or &quot;Saint Letard&quot;), the first priest among the Anglo-Saxons, and most likely presented to converts. The surviving example is mounted for wearing as jewellery.

In Europe, from the late Middle Ages on, it became common for sovereigns, nobles, and later, intellectuals to commission medals to be given simply as gifts to their political allies to either maintain or gain support of an influential person. The medals were made in a range of metals, such as gold, silver-gilt, silver, bronze, and lead, depending on the status of the recipient. They were typically up to about three inches across, and usually featured the head of the donor on the obverse, surrounded by an inscription with their name and title, and their emblem on the reverse, with a learned motto inscribed round the edges. Such medals were not usually intended to be worn, although they might have been set as pendants on a chain. From the 16th century onward, medals were made, both by rulers for presentation and private enterprise for sale, to commemorate specific events, including military battles and victories, and from this grew the practice of awarding military medals specifically to combatants, though initially only a few of the much higher-ranking officers.
The medieval revival seems to have begun around 1400 with the extravagant French prince Jean, Duc de Berry, who commissioned a number of large classicising medals that were probably produced in very small numbers, or a unique cast. Only casts in bronze from the originals in precious metal survive, although it is known that at least some medals were also set with jewels, and these may well have been worn on a chain. At the same period, the first known post-classical medal commemorating a victory was struck for Francesco Carrara (Novello) on the occasion of the capture of Padua in 1390. The Italian artist Pisanello, generally agreed to be the finest medallist of the Renaissance, began in 1438 with a medal, celebrating the unprecedented visit of the Byzantine Emperor John VIII Palaiologos to Italy. This was presumably a commercial venture, but his later medals were mostly commissioned for distribution as gifts by rulers or nobles. Like almost all early Renaissance medals, it was cast rather than die-struck. With each successive cast the medal became slightly smaller, and the numbers that could be produced were probably not large. A lead &quot;proof&quot; was probably often used. The association between medals and the classical revival began to take a rather different form, and the exchange of medals became associated with Renaissance Humanism. Princes would send humanist writers and scholars medals in recognition of their work, and the humanists began to make their own medals, normally in bronze, to send to their patrons and peers. The fashion remained restricted to Italy until near the end of the 15th century, when it spread to other countries. By the 16th century, medals were increasingly produced by rulers or cities for propaganda purposes. In 1550, a die-stamping machine, using steel dies, was introduced in Augsburg, Germany, and soon this process became standard. The artist now cut an intaglio die rather than modelling in relief.

By the 16th century, the wearing of smaller medals on a chain was a persistent fashion for both sexes, and a variety of medals were produced commercially for the purpose, commemorating persons or events, or just with non-specific suitable sentiments. German artists had been producing high-quality medals from the beginning of the century, while the French and British were slower to produce fine work. However, by the late 17th century, most parts of Western Europe could produce fine work. Some medals were also collected, which continues to the present day. Official medals, from which specialized military awards descended, were increasingly produced, but the real growth in military medals did not come until the 19th century.

In the East, a wide variety of medals and decorations have been given by the Ottoman Empire since the 18th century.

Devotional medals became very popular in Catholic countries. Very famous is the Miraculous Medal, whose design was created based on the apparitions of the Blessed Virgin Mary to Saint Catherine Labouré in Paris. In 1832, during an epidemic, the first medals were distributed, to which numerous healings and conversions were attributed, receiving the name of Miraculous Medal and distributed to millions of people around the world.

During the Reformation there had also been a vigorous tradition of Protestant medals, more polemical than devotional, which continued with the Geuzen medals produced in the Dutch Revolt.

==Military medals and decorations==

Military decorations, service awards, and medals are often mistakenly confused with one another. &quot;Decoration&quot; is a term for awards which require specific acts of heroism or achievement (such as the British Victoria Cross or American Silver Star), whereas a &quot;service award&quot; or &quot;campaign medal&quot; is awarded for serving in a particular capacity in a particular geographical area and time frame (such as the Iraq Campaign Medal). In either case, an award or decoration may be presented as a medal.

The Roman Republic adopted an elaborate system of military awards that included medals called phalerae to be issued to soldiers and units for a variety of achievements. The practice was revived in the Early Modern period, and medals began to be worn on the chest as part of standard military uniform. The United States Continental Congress awarded the Fidelity Medallion as early as 1780, to three specified men for a particular incident, as a one-off award, which was characteristic of early military decorations. In 1782, the Badge of Military Merit was established, and mostly awarded to non-officers. The Légion d&#x27;honneur instituted by Napoleon I in 1802 had some of the characteristics of the old military orders, but was intended to be far more inclusive, and was awarded to rank and file soldiers for bravery or exceptional service. Other nations followed with decorations such as the British Army Gold Medal from 1810, though this only went to senior officers, and the Prussian Iron Cross from 1813. Medals were not awarded to all combatants in a war or battle until the 19th century, when the Waterloo Medal was the first British medal given to all present, at the Battle of Waterloo and all associated actions in 1815. By the middle of the 19th century, the number of awards used had greatly expanded in most countries to something near modern levels.
An order tends to be the most elaborate of military decorations, typically awarded for distinguished services to a nation or to the general betterment of humanity. Orders are distinguished from other forms of decoration in that they often imply membership in an organization or association of others that have received the same award. Two of the most well known and commonly awarded orders are the &quot;Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot; of France (military and civil) and the civil Order of the British Empire. The practice of conferring orders originates with the mediaeval fraternities of knighthood, some of which still exist and are still awarded. While most modern orders have no roots in knighthood, they still tend to carry over the terms of their historic counterparts, and terms such as knight, commander, officer, members, and so on are still commonly found as ranks. A military order may use a medal as its insignia, however, most tend to have a unique badge or a type of plaque specifically designed for an emblem.

The Medal of Honor is the highest military decoration awarded by the United States Government, and is an example of a decoration that is modeled as a military order, even though not expressly defining itself as one (The Legion of Merit distinctly serves this purpose, and unlike any other U.S. military decoration, has classes). It is bestowed on a member of the United States Armed Forces who distinguishes himself, &quot;conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while engaged in an action against an enemy of the United States.&quot; Each of the three departments of the American armed forces has a unique picture displayed on a medal, which is in turn displayed upon a star-shaped heraldic badge. The medal of the U.S. Army depicts the head of Minerva, the U.S. Navy medal shows a scene of Minerva doing battle with Discord, and the U.S. Air Force depicts the Statue of Liberty upon its medal.

Military decorations, including medals and orders, are usually presented to the recipient in a formal ceremony. Medals are normally worn on more formal occasions and are suspended from a ribbon of the medal&#x27;s colours on the left breast, while a corresponding ribbon bar is to be worn to common events where medals would be inappropriate or impractical to wear.

==Table medals and other large forms==

Medallion is a vague term, often used for larger, usually circular, medals, which might be worn as pendants round the neck. It is the correct term for such medals from the late Roman Empire, typically distributed by the emperor and bearing his image, but in later periods larger medals are best termed just as medals.
Generally circular, table medals are issued for artistic, commemoration, or souvenir purposes, not for commerce, and are too large to be plausibly worn. Tokens and Table Medals of coin-like appearance are part of the Exonumia subcategory of Numismatics, while Orders, Decorations, and Medals are considered Militaria (military related). 
The Nobel Foundation, the organization awarding the prestigious Nobel Prize, presents each winner, &quot;an assignment for the amount of the prize, a diploma, and a gold medal...&quot; This medal would be displayed framed like a picture, on a table, wall or in a cabinet, rather than be worn by the winner.

The Carnegie Hero Foundation is the issuer of a bravery medal, most commonly issued in the US, Canada, and the UK. This large bronze table medal features Andrew Carnegie&#x27;s likeness on the obverse and the name of the awardee and citation engraved on the reverse. It is usually issued for lifesaving incidents. In the U.S. Military, challenge coins are a type of relatively unofficial medal given to boost morale, and sometimes to act as convenient passes for unit members.

Also related are plaques and plaquettes, which may be commemorative, but especially in the Renaissance and Mannerist periods were often made for purely decorative purposes, with often crowded scenes from religious, historical or mythological sources. While usually metal, table medals have been issued in wood, plastic, fibre, and other compositions. The US Government awards gold medals on important occasions, with bronze copies available for public sale.

==Fraternal jewels==

Amongst the many fraternal organisations which wear ceremonial regalia, the use of medals is commonplace. In many prominent fraternal organisations, fraternal medals are known as &quot;jewels&quot;. Their purpose varies, and may include use as a badge of membership, an indication of rank, a symbol of office within the fraternity, or an indication of support having been given to a designated charitable cause (so-called &quot;charity jewels&quot;). Common secular fraternities using jewels (medals) in the English-speaking world include Freemasonry, the Orange Order, the Royal Antediluvian Order of Buffaloes, and the Oddfellows. There are also religious fraternal organisations attached to certain Christian denominations (for example, the Catenian Association), also using medals as jewels of their Orders. Many of these organisations advertise jewels (medals) for sale on their corporate websites.

Fraternal jewels may be worn as military-style medals, on ribbons, from the left breast, or more prominently on collars or collarettes as part of the organisation&#x27;s regalia. Historic examples of such medals and jewels may be found in many museums, particularly museums dedicated to fraternal organisations.

There is extensive trade in fraternal jewels and medals, with societies and associations existing to promote such trade, and to encourage the sharing of resources, and on-line resources available to support the hobby.

==Different metals==
Traditionally, medals are made of the following metals, in order of decreasing value:
# Platinum
# Gold
# Silver, or silver-gilt, which is in fact used for Olympic &quot;gold medals&quot;
# Bronze
# Pewter
# Copper
# Tin
# Iron

Many medals were and are made in several different metals, either representing awards for different places in a competition, or standards or classes, as with the Olympic medals, or simply different price levels for medals made for sale or donation by the commissioner. Medals have historically been given as prizes in various types of competitive activities, especially athletics. The gold, silver and bronze Olympic medals for first, second and third places were first used at the 1904 Summer Olympics. At the 1896 event, silver was awarded to winners and bronze to runners-up, while at 1900 other prizes were given, not medals. The medals for the London 2012 Summer Olympics are the largest ever, reflecting a trend for increasing size in Olympic medals.

==Medals as art==
The first well-known great artist to create medals was the Italian painter Antonio Pisano, also known as Pisanello, who modelled and cast a number of portrait medals of princes and scholars in the 1440s. Many other artists followed his example, in places such as Italy, the Low Countries, Germany, and France. In the seventeenth century medals were extensively used to commemorate events and glorify rulers. In the eighteenth century prize medals became common. In the 19th century art medals exploded in popularity. In the early part of the aforementioned century, David d&#x27;Angers produced a great series of portrait medals of famous contemporaries and in the latter part of the century, Jules-Clément Chaplain and Louis-Oscar Roty were among many highly regarded medalists. The early twentieth century saw art medals flourish, particularly in France, Italy, and Belgium, while later in the century Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, the US, Canada, and England produced much high quality work.

<text>Terry Zwigoff (born May 18, 1949) is an American film director whose work often deals with misfits, antiheroes, and themes of alienation. He first garnered attention for his work in documentary filmmaking with &quot;Louie Bluie&quot; (1985) and &quot;Crumb&quot; (1995). After &quot;Crumb&quot;, Zwigoff moved on to write and direct fiction feature films, including the Academy Award-nominated &quot;Ghost World&quot; (2001) and &quot;Bad Santa&quot; (2003).

==Life and career==
=== Early life and education ===
Zwigoff was born in Appleton, Wisconsin, to a Jewish family of dairy farmers. He was raised in Chicago.

=== Underground comix scene ===
Zwigoff moved to San Francisco in the 1970s and met cartoonist Robert Crumb, who shared his interest in pre-war American roots music. Zwigoff, who plays cello and mandolin (as well as the saw, and the Stroh violin), joined Crumb&#x27;s string band R. Crumb &amp; His Cheap Suit Serenaders, with whom he recorded several records.

Zwigoff&#x27;s friendship with Crumb led to his involvement in the underground comix scene. He initially edited the one-shot &quot;Funny &quot; #1 (Apex Novelties, 1972), the groundbreaking comic in which Art Spiegelman first introduced the characters and themes that would become &quot;Maus&quot;. In 1972–1973, Zwigoff operated Golden Gate, a small retailer and underground comix publisher (located at 429 Brazil Street in San Francisco). Golden Gate Publishing released three comics during this period, all of which heavily featured Crumb&#x27;s work:
* &quot;The People&#x27;s Comics&quot; (Sept. 1972) – all Crumb; features the story in which Fritz the Cat is killed
* &quot;Turned On Cuties&quot; (1972) – 28 pages of &quot;pin-up&quot; illustrations by Jay Lynch and a host of other San Francisco-based underground comix creators
* &quot;Artistic Comics&quot; (Mar. 1973) – 68 pp. of reproductions from Crumb&#x27;s sketchbooks

Zwigoff later sold Golden Gate&#x27;s publishing rights to Kitchen Sink Press.

From 1981 to 1984, Zwigoff helmed the letter column of &quot;Weirdo&quot;, a comics anthology edited by Crumb. &quot;Weirdo&#x27;s Advice to the Lovelorn&quot; was written by Zwigoff, operating under the nom de plume of &quot;Prof. T. E. Zwigoff&quot;.

=== Filmmaking career ===
Zwigoff began his film career making documentary films, starting with 1985&#x27;s &quot;Louie Bluie&quot;, a one-hour documentary about the blues and string band musician Howard Armstrong. Zwigoff had been inspired to locate and interview him after listening to a 30s recording, &quot;State Street Rag&quot;, on which Armstrong played the mandolin.

Zwigoff worked on a documentary about R. Crumb and his two brothers for nine years, during which Zwigoff said he was &quot;averaging an income of about $200 a month and living with back pain so intense that I spent three years with a loaded gun on the pillow next to my bed, trying to get up the nerve to kill myself&quot;. He completed &quot;Crumb&quot; in 1994; the critically acclaimed film won the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival, the DGA award, the NY Film Critics Circle Award, the LA Film Critics Award, and the National Society of Film Critics Award. Additionally, critic Gene Siskel named &quot;Crumb&quot; the best film of 1995 as did over ten other major film critics. It appeared on over 150 Ten Best Lists of important critics. When &quot;Crumb&quot; failed to receive an Oscar nomination, there was an outcry from the media which forced the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to revamp their documentary nomination process that previously had been dominated by the distributors of documentary films.

Zwigoff&#x27;s first fiction feature film was the comedy-drama &quot;Ghost World&quot;, based on Daniel Clowes&#x27; graphic novel of the same name. For this, Zwigoff and co-writer Clowes were nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay and won the Independent Spirit Award. &quot;Ghost World&quot; was also nominated for two Golden Globe Awards and two AFI awards. &quot;USA Today&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it the best film of the year. &quot;Ghost World&quot; appeared on over 150 Ten Best Lists.

Zwigoff&#x27;s next film was the 2003 black comedy &quot;Bad Santa&quot; whose star, Billy Bob Thornton, was nominated for a Golden Globe award. The film cost $23 million to make and grossed over $76 million worldwide.

His latest feature film was &quot;Art School Confidential&quot;, whose best-known stars are John Malkovich, Jim Broadbent, and Anjelica Huston. &quot;Art School Confidential&quot; was Zwigoff&#x27;s second collaboration with writer Daniel Clowes.

In 2009, Zwigoff signed a petition in support of film director Roman Polanski, calling for his release after Polanski was arrested in Switzerland in relation to his 1977 charge for drugging and raping a then 13-year-old girl.

<doc id="375217" wikidata="Q1781841" url="?curid=375217" title="List of reported UFO sightings">
<text>This is a list of notable reported sightings of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and related claims of close encounters or abductions. UFOs are generally considered to include any perceived aerial phenomenon that cannot be immediately identified or explained. Upon investigation, most UFOs are identified as known objects or atmospheric phenomena, while a small number remain unexplained. UFOs have been referred to using a range of terms including the more specific &quot;flying saucer&quot; and the more general &quot;unidentified anomalous phenomena&quot; (UAP). The term &quot;UAP&quot; is sometimes used to avoid cultural associations with UFO conspiracy theories.

Although often viewed as abnormal, UFO sightings are reported frequently. During the United States&#x27; initial 1947 wave, over 800 sightings were reported in the news. The British Ministry of Defence receives 100s of reports each year. In Brazil, pilots alone report dozens of annual sightings. A small portion of reported sightings have lasting cultural significance, interpreted through the cultural and technological expectations of the time.

<doc id="375219" wikidata="Q22290" url="?curid=375219" title="Olympia Snowe">
<text>Olympia Jean Snowe (; born February 21, 1947) is an American businesswoman and politician who was a United States Senator from Maine from 1995 to 2013. Snowe, a member of the Republican Party, became known for her ability to influence the outcome of close votes, including whether to end filibusters. In 2006, she was named one of America&#x27;s Best Senators by &quot;Time&quot; magazine. Throughout her Senate career, she was considered one of the most moderate members of the chamber.

On February 28, 2012, Snowe announced that she would not seek re-election in November 2012, and retired when her third term ended on January 3, 2013. She cited hyper-partisanship leading to a dysfunctional Congress as the reason for her retirement from the Senate. Her seat went to former governor Angus King, a former Democrat and current independent.

Snowe is a senior fellow for the Bipartisan Policy Center and co-chairs its Commission on Political Reform.

==Early life==

Snowe was born Olympia Jean Bouchles in Augusta, Maine, the daughter of Georgia (&quot;née&quot; Goranites) and George John Bouchles. Her father emigrated to the United States from Sparti, Greece, and her maternal grandparents were also Greek. She is a member of the Greek Orthodox Church.

When she was eight years old, her mother died of breast cancer, and less than a year later, her father died of heart disease. Orphaned, she was moved to Auburn, to be raised by her aunt and uncle, a textile mill worker and a barber, respectively, along with their five children. Her brother John was raised separately by other family members. Within a few years, disease would also claim her uncle&#x27;s life. Snowe attended St. Basil&#x27;s Academy in Garrison, New York, from the third grade to the ninth. Returning to Auburn, she attended Edward Little High School before entering the University of Maine in Orono, from which she earned a degree in political science (1969). Shortly after graduation, Bouchles married her fiancé, Republican state legislator Peter T. Snowe, on December 29, 1969, in New York City.

==Early political career==
Snowe entered politics and rose quickly, winning a seat on the Board of Voter Registration and working for Congressman (later U.S. Senator and U.S. Secretary of Defense) William Cohen. Tragedy struck Snowe again in 1973, when her husband was killed in an automobile accident. At the urging of family, friends, neighbors and local leaders, Snowe ran for her husband&#x27;s Auburn-based seat in the Maine House of Representatives at the age of 26 and won. She was re-elected to the House in 1974, and, in 1976, won election to the Maine Senate, representing Androscoggin County. That same year, she was a delegate to both the state and national Republican conventions.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
Snowe was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1978 and represented Maine&#x27;s 2nd Congressional District from 1979 to 1995. The district included most of the northern two-thirds of the state, including Bangor and her hometown of Auburn. She served as a member of the Budget and International Relations Committees. Snowe voted for the bill establishing Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a federal holiday in August 1983 and the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 in March 1988 (as well as to override President Reagan&#x27;s veto).

Snowe married John R. McKernan, Jr., then Governor of Maine, in February 1989. Snowe and John McKernan served together in the United States House of Representatives from 1983 to 1986, McKernan representing the 1st District. While Snowe was First Lady of Maine from 1989 to 1995, she served as a member of Congress of the United States.

Tragedy struck Snowe once more in 1991 when her stepson Peter McKernan died from a heart ailment at the age of 20.

==U.S. Senate==

===Elections===

In 1994, when Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell declined to run for re-election, Snowe immediately declared her candidacy for the seat. The Democratic nominee was her House colleague, 1st District Congressman Tom Andrews. Snowe defeated Andrews 60–36%, carrying every county in the state. Snowe was part of the Republican election sweep of 1994, when the Republican party captured both the House and Senate for the first time since 1954. Snowe was easily re-elected in 2000 over State Senate President Mark Lawrence, increasing her winning margin to 69%–31%. She cruised past Democratic opponent Jean Hay Bright in 2006, winning by 74% to 20.6%. She won every county in Maine in all three of her elections.

===Tenure===

Snowe was an important voice during the Senate&#x27;s 1999 impeachment trial of then-President Bill Clinton. She and fellow Maine Senator Susan Collins sponsored a motion that would have allowed the Senate to vote separately on the charges and the remedy – a &quot;finding of fact&quot; resolution. When the motion failed, Snowe and Collins voted to acquit, arguing that Clinton&#x27;s perjury did not warrant his removal from office. Her occasional breaks with the Bush administration drew attacks from conservative Republicans; the Club for Growth and Concerned Women for America label her a &quot;Republican In Name Only&quot; (RINO).

In October 2002, Snowe voted in favor of the War in Iraq.

In February 2006, TheWhiteHouseProject.org named Snowe one of its &quot;8 in &#x27;08&quot;, a group of eight female politicians who could possibly run and/or be elected president in 2008.
Snowe voted in favor of the nominations of John Roberts, Samuel Alito, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan to the U.S. Supreme Court.

In April 2006, Snowe was selected by &quot;Time&quot; as one of &quot;America&#x27;s 10 Best Senators&quot;. She was the only woman so recognized. &quot;Time&quot; praised Snowe for her sensitivity to her constituents, also noting that: &quot;Because of her centrist views and eagerness to get beyond partisan point scoring, Maine Republican Olympia Snowe is in the center of every policy debate in Washington.&quot; She received an honorary degree from Bates College in 1998, and another from the University of Delaware in 2008. Snowe did not miss any of the 657 votes on the Senate floor during the 110th Congress from 2007 to 2009. She was one of only eight senators who did not miss any votes during that session.

Snowe is the fourth woman to serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee and the first to chair its seapower subcommittee which oversees the Navy and Marine Corps. In 2001, Snowe became the first Republican woman to secure a full-term seat on the Senate Finance Committee.

Snowe was the youngest female Republican ever elected to the United States House of Representatives; she is also the first woman to have served in both houses of a state legislature and both houses of the U.S. Congress. She never lost an election in her 35 years as an elected official, and in the 2006 midterm senatorial elections, she won with a reported 73.99% of votes. However, on Tuesday, February 27, 2012, citing excessive partisanship and a dispiriting political environment, Snowe announced she would not run for re-election in November 2012. Her unexpected decision delivered a potential blow to Republicans, who needed just a handful of seats to regain control of the Senate; Snowe was considered one of their safer incumbents.

===Gang of 14===

On May 23, 2005, Snowe was one of fourteen senators dubbed the Gang of 14, who defused a confrontation between Senate Democrats (who were filibustering several judicial nominees) and the Senate Republican leadership (who wanted to use the nominations as a flashpoint to eliminate filibusters on nominees through the so-called nuclear option). The Gang-brokered compromise precluded further filibusters and the implementation of the nuclear option for the remainder of the 109th Congress; under its terms, the Democrats retained the power to filibuster a Bush judicial nominee in an &quot;extraordinary circumstance&quot;, and nominees (Janice Rogers Brown, Priscilla Owen and William Pryor) received a simple majority vote by the full Senate. The Gang later played an important role in the confirmation of Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justice Samuel Alito, as they asserted that neither met the &quot;extraordinary circumstances&quot; provision outlined in their agreement. Snowe ultimately voted for both Roberts and Alito.

==Political positions==

Snowe shares a centrist ideology with Susan Collins, her former colleague in the Senate from Maine, who still serves in the chamber. Collins is considered a &quot;half-turn more conservative&quot; than Snowe. Snowe supports abortion rights and gay rights, and though she previously voted to block the repeal of &quot;Don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell&quot;, she was one of eight Republican senators to vote for the act&#x27;s repeal on December 18, 2010, ending the policy. In her 2006 re-election campaign, she was one of two Republican Senate candidates endorsed by the prominent gay rights organization the Human Rights Campaign (the other was Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, who became a Democrat in 2013 and a Libertarian in 2019). According to GovTrack, Snowe was the most liberal Republican senator in 2012–13 being placed by GovTrack&#x27;s analysis to the left of every Republican and several Democrats. In 2012, the non-partisan &quot;National Journal&quot; gave Snowe a composite 57% conservative score and a 43% liberal score.

Snowe supported both President Clinton&#x27;s involvement in Kosovo and President George W. Bush&#x27;s invasions in Afghanistan and Iraq. On fiscal issues, she has voiced support for cutting taxes as economic stimulus, although she joined fellow Republican senators Lincoln Chafee and John McCain in voting against the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003. In 2004, she opposed the accelerated implementation of the Bush tax cuts citing budget concerns and she was joined by Senators Collins, McCain, and Chafee. 

Snowe is a member of the Republican Main Street Partnership and supports stem cell research. She is also a member of Republicans for Environmental Protection, the Republican Majority for Choice, Republicans for Choice and The Wish List (Women In the Senate and House), a group of pro-choice Republican women. Her highest composite conservative score according to the National Journal was a 63% in 2010 and her highest composite liberal score was a 55.5% in 2006. She voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment, an amendment aimed at banning gay marriage, in 2004. She voted against banning gay marriage in 2006 for a second time. In 2005 and 2007, she voted to support embryonic stem-cell research. In 2008, Snowe endorsed Republican candidate John McCain for President of the United States.

In the 111th Congress, Snowe backed the release of additional Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) funds and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. While she opposed President Obama&#x27;s budget resolution, she pledged to work in a bipartisan manner on the issues of health care reform and energy.

In 2007, Olympia Snowe was among the Republicans who voted in favor of the McCain-Kennedy bill to give citizenship to undocumented immigrants. However, she voted against the DREAM Act in 2010. She also voted to continue funding to &#x27;sanctuary cities&#x27;, voted against eliminating the &#x27;Y&#x27; guestworker visa program, but she also voted in favor of building a fence along the southern border and voted to make English the official language of the United States.

&quot;In October 2009, Snowe was the sole Republican in the Senate to vote for the Finance Committee’s health care reform bill.&quot; However, she stated that she might not support the final bill due to strong reservations. Snowe was one of three Republicans to break with their party and vote with Democrats to end a filibuster of a defense spending bill; the filibuster was meant to delay or stop the vote on health care legislation. In December 2009, Snowe voted against cloture for two procedural motions and ultimately against the Senate Health Care Reform Bill. Snowe again voted against health care reform when she voted &quot;no&quot; on the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.

Snowe announced in February 2012 that she would not seek re-election. At the time, it was reported that she and Democrat Ben Nelson (who also did not seek re-election) were the closest to each other, ideologically, of any two members of the U.S. Senate from opposite parties.

In 2012, Snowe endorsed Republican candidate Mitt Romney for President of the United States.

== After the Senate ==
After leaving the Senate, Snowe announced her support for same-sex marriage.

Snowe has been on the board of directors for the investment counsel firm T. Rowe Price since 2013. She opposed Donald Trump as the GOP nominee in 2016. She said that Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton were the least partisan 2016 presidential candidates.

On November 8, 2020, five days after the election, while President Trump and some other members of the Republican Party were claiming he had won the election, Snowe congratulated President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. On January 9, 2021, following the January 6 United States Capitol attack, she called on President Trump to &quot;resign from office now to allow our nation to begin to heal and prepare for the transition to the Biden presidency&quot;.

In addition, the Union also owns the Ravenhill Stadium in Belfast, Thomond Park in Limerick and a number of grounds in provincial areas that have been rented to clubs.

==History==
Initially, there were two unions: the Irish Football Union, which had jurisdiction over clubs in Leinster, Munster and parts of Ulster and was founded in December 1874, and the Northern Football Union of Ireland, which controlled the Belfast area and was founded in January 1875. The IRFU was formed in 1879 as an amalgamation of these two organisations and branches of the new IRFU were formed in Leinster, Munster and Ulster. The Connacht Branch was formed in 1900.

The IRFU was a founding member of the International Rugby Football Board, now known as World Rugby, in 1886 with Scotland and Wales. (England refused to join until 1890.)

Following the partition of Ireland in to what is now the Republic of Ireland (an independent country) and Northern Ireland (a region of the United Kingdom), the then Committee of the Irish Rugby Football Union decided that it would continue to administer its affairs on the basis of the full 32 Irish counties and the traditional four provinces of Ireland: Leinster (12 counties), Ulster (9 counties), Munster (6 counties), and Connacht (5 counties), as they had been whilst all in the United Kingdom.

This led to the unusual, but not unique, situation among international rugby union teams, where the Irish representative teams are drawn from players from two separate political, national territories: Ireland (an independent, sovereign state) and Northern Ireland (a part of the United Kingdom). To maintain the unity of Irish rugby union and the linkages between North and South, the IRFU purchased a new ground in 1923 in the Ravenhill district of Belfast at a cost of £2,300. The last full International at Ravenhill involving Ireland for more than a half-century took place in 1953–54 against Scotland who were victorious by 2 tries (6 points) to nil. Australia played Romania in the 1999 World Cup at the ground. The next full International played at Ravenhill was the Rugby World Cup warm-up match against Italy in August 2007 due to the temporary closure of Lansdowne Road for reconstruction.

The four provincial branches of the IRFU first ran cup competitions during the 1880s. Although these tournaments still take place every year, their significance has been diminished by the advent of an All-Ireland league of 48 Senior Clubs in 1990.

The four provincial teams have played an Interprovincial Championship since the 1920s and continue to be the focal point for players aspiring to the international level. These are Munster, Leinster, Ulster and Connacht. All four provinces play at the senior level as members of the United Rugby Championship.

==Logos and emblems==

The Irish Rugby Football Union represents the island of Ireland and the emblems and symbols it uses have reflected its association with the whole of the island of Ireland since its formation. Some elements have changed since 1874, but what has remained consistent throughout the history of the union is the use of the shamrock in its emblems. Originally the Shamrock was a five-sprig emblem covering most of the lefthand side of the jersey and this was used until the 1898 game against England in when it was replaced with a white shield with a sprig of four similar sized shamrocks.
In 1927 a new crest was introduced, with the shamrock design altered to a sprig of three shamrocks of a similar size within a smaller white shield. This was the official crest until 1974 when the centenary logo was used, and which continued to be used with only a slight modification made in 2010.

Logos used on the official match programmes from the 1920s to 1954, showing a single shamrock surrounded by an oval had no relation to the official jersey emblem. The only time an Irish jersey had a single shamrock was when the Ireland side toured Chile and Argentina in 1952 and Argentina in 1970, and in both series no caps were awarded.

Although the use of the shamrock has been a constant, albeit with modifications to design, other elements of symbology have changed. In the early twenties, when the Irish Free State was established, the union was left in the position of governing a game for one island containing two separate political entities. A controversy ensued as to what flag should be flown at international matches. For a side that played both in Dublin and Belfast (the former being in the Free State, the latter being politically part of the United Kingdom) this posed a significant issue.
In 1925 the union designed their own flag, incorporating the arms of the four provinces. Although it had the same elements as the Flag of the Four Provinces, it was not identical, instead having them separated on a green background with the IRFU logo in the centre. Even so, the call to fly the Irish tricolour at Lansdowne Road continued. In 1932, despite the IRFU insisting that only the IRFU flag was flown at home internationals, pressure continued such that the Minister for External Affairs in the Free State asked to meet with the president of the Union. The result was that on 5 February 1932, the IRFU unanimously voted to fly both the flag of the union and the national flag at Lansdowne Road at all international matches in Dublin. The IRFU flag, as designed in 1925, is that which is still used by the Ireland rugby union side, albeit with the logo updated in the middle.

At the 2011 Rugby World Cup, the Ireland team entered the field of play at the beginning of their matches with the Irish tricolour and the Flag of Ulster.

Similar to the flag and logo compromise, since The Rugby World Cup in 1995, the Irish rugby team has sung both the Irish national anthem &quot;Amhrán na bhFiann&quot; and &quot;Ireland&#x27;s call&quot;.

==Affiliation==
There are currently approximately 95,000 rugby players in total in Ireland. There are 56 clubs affiliated to the Ulster Branch; 71 to the Leinster Branch; 59 to the Munster Branch and 23 to the Connacht Branch. In addition, there are 246 schools playing rugby: Ulster (107), Leinster (75), Munster (41) and Connacht (23).

The IRFU also has an Exiles branch tasked with developing &quot;Ireland-qualified&quot; players (i.e., eligible to play internationally for Ireland as members of the Irish diaspora) living in England, Scotland and Wales. Volunteers provide coaching, administration and development under the supervision of a paid development manager.

<text>Titoism is a socialist political philosophy most closely associated with Josip Broz Tito and refers to the ideology and policies of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia (LCY) during the Cold War. It is characterized by a broad Yugoslav identity, socialist workers&#x27; self-management, a political separation from the Soviet Union, and leadership in the Non-Aligned Movement.

Tito led the communist Yugoslav Partisans during World War II in Yugoslavia. After the war, tensions arose between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union. Although these issues alleviated over time, Yugoslavia still remained largely independent in ideology and policy due to the leadership of Tito, who led Yugoslavia until his death in 1980.

Tito himself claimed he was not a Titoist; &quot;Titoism as a separate ideological line does not exist. [...] Should Titoism become an ideological line, we would become revisionists; we would have renounced Marxism. We are Marxists; I am a Marxist, and therefore I cannot be a Titoist.&quot; Today, the term &quot;Titoism&quot; is sometimes used to refer to Yugo-nostalgia across political spectrum, a longing for reestablishment of Yugoslavia or revival of Yugoslavism by the citizens of Yugoslavia&#x27;s successor states.

== Background ==

Initially a personal favourite of the USSR, Tito led the national liberation war to the Nazi occupation during World War II, where the Yugoslav Partisans liberated Yugoslavia with only limited help from the Red Army. Tito met with the Soviet leadership several times immediately after the war to negotiate the future of Yugoslavia. Initially aligned with Soviet policy, over time, these negotiations became less cordial because Tito had the intention neither of handing over executive power nor of accepting foreign intervention or influence (a position Tito later continued within the Non-Aligned Movement).

The Yugoslav regime first pledged allegiance, from 1945 to 1948, to Stalinism. But according to the Trotskyist (hence anti-Stalinist) historian Jean-Jacques Marie, Stalin had planned to liquidate Tito as early as the end of the 1930s, and again after the Spanish Civil War, during which Tito participated in the recruitment and to the organization of the Dimitrov Battalion, a Balkan unit of the International Brigades, some of whose ex-combatants would be assassinated by the Soviets.

Tito&#x27;s agreement with Bulgarian leader Georgi Dimitrov on Greater Yugoslavia projects, which meant to merge the two Balkan countries into a Balkan Federation, made Stalin anxious. This led to the 1947 cooperation agreement signed in Bled (Dimitrov also pressured Romania to join such a federation, expressing his beliefs during a visit to Bucharest in early 1948). The Bled agreement, also referred to as the &quot;Tito–Dimitrov treaty&quot;, was signed 1 August 1947 in Bled, Slovenia. It foresaw also unification between Vardar Macedonia and Pirin Macedonia and return of Western Outlands to Bulgaria. The integrationist policies resulting from the agreement were terminated after the Tito–Stalin split in June 1948, when Bulgaria was being subordinated to the interests of the Soviet Union and took a stance against Yugoslavia.

The policy of regional blocs had been the norm in Comintern policies, displaying Soviet resentment of the nation states in Eastern Europe and of the consequences of Paris Peace Conference. With the 1943 dissolution of Comintern and the subsequent advent of the Cominform came Stalin&#x27;s dismissal of the previous ideology, and adaptation to the conditions created for Soviet hegemony during the Cold War.

== Tito–Stalin split ==
Moreover, Stalin did not have in Yugoslavia as he did in other countries of the Fourth Moscow Conference on the partition of Europe; the USSR had not obtained preponderance there, as it was agreed in the Percentages agreement that he would retain only 50% influence over Yugoslavia. Tito therefore benefited from a margin of maneuver far greater than that of the other Southeast European leaders.

When the rest of Eastern Europe became satellite states of the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia refused to accept the 1948 &quot;Resolution of the Cominform&quot; which condemned the leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia for allegedly abandoning Marxism-Leninism, and any communists who sympathised with Yugoslavia. The period from 1948 to 1955, known as the Informbiro, was marked by severe repression of opponents and many others accused of pro-Stalin attitudes being sent to the penal camp on Goli Otok in Yugoslavia. Likewise, real and accused Titoists or &#x27;Titoites&#x27; were met with similar treatment in Eastern Bloc countries, which furthermore served to publicize the dangers of challenging subservience to Moscow, as well as to purge &#x27;unwanted&#x27; individuals from their Communist parties.

== Ideology ==

Elements of Titoism are characterized by policies and practices based on the principle that in each country the means of attaining ultimate communist goals must be dictated by the conditions of that particular country, rather than by a pattern set in another country. During Josip Broz Tito&#x27;s era, this specifically meant that the communist goal should be pursued independently of and often in opposition to the policies of the Soviet Union.

In contrast to Joseph Stalin&#x27;s policy of &quot;socialism in one country&quot;, Tito advocated cooperation between developing nations in the world through the Non-Aligned Movement while at the same time pursuing socialism in whatever ways best suited particular nations. During Tito&#x27;s era, his ideas specifically meant that the communist goal should be pursued independently of (and often in opposition to) what he referred to as the Stalinist and imperialist policies of the Soviet Union. Through this split and subsequent policies some commentators have grouped Titoism with Eurocommunism or reformist socialism. It was also meant to demonstrate the viability of a third way between the capitalist United States and the socialist Soviet Union.

In fact, on the economic level, Tito simply took note of the inability of the Stalinist-type centralized bureaucratic economy to meet human needs and expanded the number and power of cooperatives and workers&#x27; councils, several years before Lieberman Reform and Mikhail Gorbachev in the USSR, before Imre Nagy and János Kádár in Hungary, Alexander Dubcek in Czechoslovakia, and Deng Xiaoping in China.

Throughout his time in office, Tito prided himself on Yugoslavia&#x27;s independence from the Soviet Union, with Yugoslavia never accepting full membership in Comecon and Tito&#x27;s open rejection of many aspects of Stalinism as the most obvious manifestations of this. The Soviets and their satellite states often accused Yugoslavia of Trotskyism and social democracy, charges loosely based on Tito&#x27;s socialist self-management, attempts at greater democratization in the workplace, and the theory of associated labor (profit sharing policies and worker-owned industries initiated by him, Milovan Đilas and Edvard Kardelj in 1950). It was in these things that the Soviet leadership accused of harboring the seeds of council communism or even corporatism. Despite Tito&#x27;s numerous disagreements with the USSR, Yugoslavia restored relations with the USSR in 1956 with the Belgrade declaration and it became an associated member of the Comecon in 1964. Therefore, Yugoslavia once again strengthened its economic and political ties with the USSR.

Additionally, Yugoslavia joined the US-sponsored Balkan Pact in July 1953, a military alliance with two NATO member states — Greece and Turkey. The pact had been signed a few days before Stalin died, and the new Soviet government failed to develop any response. However, it was continually met with opposition by Albanian leader Enver Hoxha, who accused Tito and Yugoslavia for being agents of American imperialism. Tito signed this pact to bolster the defense of Yugoslavia against a potential Soviet military invasion. It also made the option of Yugoslavia&#x27;s NATO membership more plausible at its time. Under this pact, any potential Soviet invasion of Yugoslavia could also lead to NATO intervention to help defend Yugoslavia due to the NATO memberships of Greece and Turkey. However, the foreign policy disagreements between the three countries in the pact eventually crippled the alliance itself, thus ending the possibility of Yugoslavia&#x27;s NATO membership.

Some Trotskyists considered Tito to be an &#x27;unconscious Trotskyist&#x27; because of the split with Stalin. However, other Trotskyists claimed that there were no fundamental differences in principles between Stalin and Tito, despite significant evidence suggesting the contrary. Most notably, Trotskyist writer Ted Grant published several articles criticizing both leaders in the British Trotskyist newspaper, of which he was the editor.

The &quot;Titoist&quot; regime adopted a policy of economic &quot;self-management&quot;, generalized from 1950, wishing to put the means of production under social ownership of direct producers, thus excluding the formation of a bureaucracy as was the case in other communist regimes.

The propaganda attacks centered on the caricature of &quot;Tito the Butcher&quot; of the working class, aimed to pinpoint him as a covert agent of Western imperialism, pointing to Tito&#x27;s partial cooperation with western and imperialist nations. Tito and Yugoslavia were seen by Western powers as a strategic ally with the possibility to &quot;[drive] a wedge into the Communist monolith&quot;.

== History ==
From 1949 the central government began to cede power to communal local governments, seeking to decentralise the government and work towards a withering away of the state. In the system of local self-government, higher-level bodies could supervise compliance with the law by lower-level bodies, but could not issue orders to them. Edvard Kardelj declared in the Assembly of Yugoslavia &quot;that no perfect bureaucratic apparatus, however brilliant the people at the top, can build socialism. Socialism can grow only from the initiatives of the masses of the people.&quot; Rankovićism disagreed with this decentralisation, viewing it as a threat to the stability of Yugoslavia. Other socialist states also criticised this move for deviating from Marxism-Leninism with declarations that it &quot;is an outright denial of the teachings of Marxism-Leninism and the universal laws on the construction of socialism.&quot;

The League of Communists of Yugoslavia retained solid power; the legislature did little more than rubber stamp decisions already made by the LCY&#x27;s Politburo. The secret police, the State Security Administration (UDBA), while operating with considerably more restraint than its counterparts in the rest of Eastern Europe, was nonetheless a feared tool of government control. UDBA was particularly notorious for assassinating suspected &quot;enemies of the state&quot; who lived in exile overseas. The media remained under restrictions that were onerous by Western standards, but still had more latitude than their counterparts in other Communist countries. Nationalist groups were a particular target of the authorities, with numerous arrests and prison sentences handed down over the years for separatist activities. Although the Soviets revised their attitudes under Nikita Khrushchev during the process of de-Stalinization and sought to normalize relations with the Yugoslavs while obtaining influence in the Non-Aligned Movement, the answer they got was never enthusiastic and the Soviet Union never gained a proper outlet to the Mediterranean Sea. At the same time, the Non-Aligned states failed to form a third Bloc, especially after the split at the outcome of the 1973 oil crisis.

Industry was nationalized, agriculture forcibly collectivized, and a rigid industrialization program based on the Soviet model was adopted. Yugoslav and Soviet companies signed contracts for numerous joint ventures. According to the American historian Adam Ulam, in no other country in the Eastern Bloc was Sovietization &quot;as rapid and as ruthless as in Yugoslavia&quot;.

Despite the initial thaw between the USSR and the Yugoslavian authorities following the signing of the Belgrade declaration, relations became tense again between the two countries after Yugoslavia sheltered Imre Nagy following the invasion of Hungary. Tito initially approved the Soviet military intervention in his letter to Khrushchev due to fears of Hungarian Revolution provoking a similar anti-communist and nationalist movement in Yugoslavia. Still, Tito later sheltered Nagy to prove Yugoslavia&#x27;s sovereign status and non-aligned foreign policy to gain sympathy from the international community. The abduction and the execution of Nagy by the Hungarian government under János Kádár cooled the bilateral relationship between Yugoslavia and Hungary, despite Tito&#x27;s initial support and recommendations of Kadar as the successor of Mátyás Rákosi and Nagy.

Yugoslavia backed Czechoslovakia&#x27;s leader Alexander Dubček during the 1968 Prague Spring and then cultivated a special (albeit incidental) relation with the maverick Romanian President Nicolae Ceaușescu. Titoism was similar to Dubček&#x27;s socialism with a human face, while Ceaușescu attracted sympathies for his refusal to condone (and take part in) the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, which briefly seemed to constitute a &quot;casus belli&quot; between Romania and the Soviets. However, Ceaușescu was an unlikely member of the alliance since he profited from the events in order to push his authoritarian agenda inside Romania.

After a significant expansion of the private sector in the 1950s and 1960s and a shift towards a more market-oriented economy, the Yugoslavian leadership did put a halt to overt capitalist attempts (such as Stjepan Mesić&#x27;s experiment with privatization in Orahovica) and crushed the dissidence of liberal or democratic socialist thinkers such as the former leader Milovan Đilas, while it also clamped down on centrifugal attempts, promoting Yugoslav patriotism. Although still claimed as official policies, nearly all aspects of Titoism went into rapid decline after Tito&#x27;s death in 1980, being replaced by the rival policies of constituent republics. During the late 1980s, nationalism was again on the rise one decade after the Croatian Spring, and inter-republic ethnic tensions escalated.

== Reception ==

Titoism has been perceived very differently by international figures. During Stalin&#x27;s lifetime, the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries reacted against Titoism with aggressive hostility. Participants in alleged Titoist conspiracies, such as the GDR historian Walter Markov, were subjected to reprisals, and some were put through staged show trials that ended with death sentences, such as the Rajk trial in Budapest in 1949 or the Slánský trial in Prague in 1952. About forty important trials against &quot;Titoists&quot; took place during the Informbiro period, in addition to persecution, arrest and deportation of thousands of less prominent individuals who were presumed to hold pro-Yugoslav sympathies. In France, the Cominform ordered the central committee of the French Communist Party to condemn &quot;Titoism&quot; in 1948 With prominent members such as writing of the need to hunt down &quot;Titoist spies&quot; within the party. After Stalin&#x27;s death, the Soviet conspiracy theories around Titoism subsided but continued. In the mid-1950s, Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union temporarily reconciled. Nevertheless, Titoism was generally condemned as revisionism in the Eastern bloc.

In Marxist circles in the West, Titoism was considered a form of Western socialism alongside Eurocommunism, which was appreciated by left-wing intellectuals who were breaking away from the Soviet line in the 1960s. In the 1960s, political scientists understood Titoist state narrative as a form of socialist patriotism. Historian Adam Ulam was more critical of Titoism and writes that Titoism has always &quot;retained its (albeit mild) totalitarian one-party character&quot;.

Muammar Gaddafi&#x27;s Third International Theory, outlined in his &quot;Green Book&quot; which informed Libyan national policy from its formation in 1975 until Gaddafi&#x27;s downfall in 2011, was heavily inspired by and shared many similarities with Titoism and Yugoslav workers&#x27; self-management.

Titoism gained influence in the communist parties in the 1940s, including Poland (Władysław Gomułka), Hungary (László Rajk, Imre Nagy), Bulgaria (Traicho Kostov), Czechoslovakia (Vladimír Clementis), and Romania (Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu).
=== National communism or proletarian internationalism ===
Titoism has sometimes been referred to as a form of &quot;national communism&quot;, an attempt to reconcile nationalism with communism, traditionally considered incompatible by Marxist social philosophers. Walker Connor posits that Titoism is more akin to &quot;state communism&quot;, and that Tito advocated patriotism rather than nationalism, as the loyalty is to a state comprising multiple nations. Nationalism was, therefore a threat to Titoism. Tito and the Yugoslav leadership firmly rejected existence of &#x27;national communism&#x27;, describing the accusations as &quot;attempts to stigmatise recognition of the diversity of forms in socialist processes&quot; and asserted that Yugoslav communists too are proletarian internationalists, stating that:

Yugoslav interpretation of proletarian internationalism was outlined in &quot;The Programme of the League of Yugoslav Communists&quot;: &quot;Proletarian internationalism demands correct relationships, and support of and solidarity with every socialist country and every socialist movement genuinely fighting for socialism, peace, and active peaceful coexistence between peoples.&quot; This posture was contrasted to Stalin&#x27;s conception of proletarian internationalism &quot;which required unity within the Communist Camp under the leadership of one party which was committed to the interest of one country, the Soviet Union.&quot;

<text>Lansdowne Road Stadium (, ) was a stadium in Dublin owned by the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) that was primarily used for rugby union and association football matches. The stadium was demolished in 2007 to make way for the Aviva Stadium on the same site, which opened in 2010.

The stadium took its name from the adjacent street, Lansdowne Road.

==Location==

The stadium was situated in the neighbourhood of Ballsbridge in the city&#x27;s Dublin 4 area. The stadium had convenient public transport links as the Lansdowne Road station of the Dublin Area Rapid Transit rail system is adjacent to the site and passed directly underneath the West Stand.

The stadium was named after the nearby road, which in turn was named after William Petty-FitzMaurice, 1st Marquess of Lansdowne. The Marquis was also the Earl of Shelburne, and nearby Shelbourne Road is also named after him.

==Uses==
The stadium had a total capacity of 49,250, with 25,000 seats. However, competitive international football matches could not use the entire capacity because the stands at both ends of the ground (North and South) were standing-only terraces. FIFA and UEFA both mandate that international matches be played in all-seated venues. A temporary capacity of 36,000 was the result for competitive soccer. World Rugby, known as the International Rugby Board when the current Aviva Stadium opened, does not impose this restriction on international rugby venues. For non-competitive international football matches (friendly matches), the FIFA/UEFA all-seated mandate does not apply.

At the IRFU ground, Irish rugby and football international matches were played. Leinster also used the ground on a number of occasions when crowd size meant their traditional home of Donnybrook was not large enough. In 1999 and 2003, Lansdowne Road played host to the Heineken Cup final. Since 1990, Lansdowne was also a regular host of the FAI Cup Final.

The stadium had also hosted huge concerts from artists such as Michael Jackson, Robbie Williams, Oasis, U2, The Corrs, Westlife and others.

==History==
The Lansdowne Road Stadium was the brainchild of Henry Dunlop, the organiser of the first All Ireland Athletics Championships. Dunlop, a decorated track walker and engineering graduate of Trinity College, Dublin, founded the Irish Champion Athletic Club in 1871.

After an initial meeting at Trinity College, the Provost of the College banned any further meetings on campus. Dunlop had to find a new home for his sporting endeavours.

Dunlop founded Lansdowne Football Club in 1872 and that club has played rugby union ever since at the grounds, being one of the most prominent and successful rugby clubs in Leinster and Ireland. Wanderers Football Club, founded in 1869, joined Lansdowne at the grounds later. The two clubs were tenants since that time and also use the new Aviva Stadium.

Some 300 cartloads of soil from a trench beneath the railway were used to raise the ground, allowing Dunlop to utilise his engineering expertise to create a pitch envied around Ireland.

Rugby gradually became the main use of the grounds: the first representative rugby match was an interprovincial fixture between Leinster and Ulster in December 1876, and on 11 March 1878, Lansdowne Road hosted its first international rugby fixture, against England, making it the world&#x27;s oldest rugby union Test venue. Dunlop charged the IRFU £5 and half of any profits over £50 after expenses. The first victory Ireland had at the ground took place on 5 February 1887, against England. Around this time, the treasurer of the IRFU, Harry Sheppard, acquired the lease from Dunlop and when Sheppard died in 1906, the union paid his estate £200 for the lease. The IRFU built the first covered stand in 1908, alongside the railway. An uncovered stand was built over the Lansdowne club pavilion at the northwest corner of the ground.

The first international soccer match at the venue took place between Ireland and England on Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day, 17 March 1900, when the Belfast-based Irish Football Association controlled that game throughout the island. England won by 2–0. In 1926, the Irish Free State played an international game against Italy at Lansdowne Road and this was to be the last soccer game at the stadium until Waterford United played Manchester United in a European Cup tie in September 1968.

The day after the United Kingdom declared war in August 1914, 350 rugby players, of middle-class and professional backgrounds with solicitors and barristers and many working in banks and insurance companies, assembled on the ground. They were addressed by FH Browning, the President of the IRFU, and they decided to volunteer to join the 7th Royal Dublin Fusiliers as a &quot;pals&quot; company, D Company. They marched from the grounds through the city on their way to the Curragh Camp. Some were shortly commissioned as officers, others became NCOs and many of the others became specialists in the battalion, such as signallers, machine-gunners and medical orderlies. This unit saw action at Suvla Bay in the Dardanelles on 7 August 1915, when many of them died. A memorial to the IRFU members who died in the Great War was erected on the inside of the external wall of the stadium after the war. It was to be preserved in any rebuilding by condition of the planning permission, and is now located just outside the new Aviva Stadium media centre.

After the First World War, the members of Lansdowne and Wanderers reclaimed land from the nearby River Dodder and created enough ground for two back pitches to be formed, enabling the main pitch to be turned out around to the configuration used ever since.

In 1927, the old East Stand was built and a terrace created under it. Soldiers of the National Army filled the stand to test its strength. Unfortunately, the roof of the stand was not erected in time for the first match against Scotland. The day of the match saw torrential rain, soaking the spectators and the day was long remembered for the appalling conditions.

The Irish poet Louis MacNeice evokes the atmosphere at Lansdowne Park in the late 1930s in Rugby Football Excursion, a poem first published in 1938. MacNeice does not specify the actual occasion, but the details provided in the sixth stanza of the poem - &quot;Eccentric scoring - Nicholson, Marshall and Unwin, / Replies by Bailey and Daly&quot; - suggest that MacNeice was at Lansdowne Park on 12 February 1938 for a match between Ireland and England in the 1938 Home Nations Championship. Pathé News made a newsreel of this match. The newsreel shows the English and Irish teams running onto the pitch, watched by a huge crowd, followed by various shots of the match in progress.

Lansdowne Lawn Tennis Club was a tenant at the grounds and had grass tennis courts where the South Terrace was later located. During international rugby matches, the tennis courts were covered with planks of wood to allow spectators to stand and watch the rugby matches. In 1930, Lansdowne LTC left the ground to move across the Dodder river to Londonbridge Road, taking the turf from the tennis courts with them.

The IRFU, which had its offices within the stadium complex, allowed occasional other uses of the ground, including athletics (a crowd of 40,000 witnessed Olympic gold medalist Ronnie Delany run there in an international athletics meeting in the 1950s).

In 1952 Lansdowne Road hosted the first colours match between University College Dublin and Trinity College, Dublin. UCD took the honours.

In 1954, the arrangement whereby Ireland matches were shared between Ravenhill Stadium and Lansdowne Road ended with the building of the Upper West Stand at Lansdowne creating 8,000 additional seats. In future, all Ireland internationals were to be played at Lansdowne Road.

In September 1968 the first football match was played at IRFU headquarters as Waterford played Manchester United in the 1968–69 European Cup

In 1977, the old West Lower Stand was demolished and the new West Lower Stand opened in 1978. The uncovered stand at the corner of the North Terrace was demolished and terracing extended. Lansdowne FC moved their clubhouse from under that stand to a new clubhouse within the grounds, near Herbert Bridge, beside the Dodder. The mock-Tudor tearooms of Lansdowne FC reverted to the IRFU.

The East Stand replaced the Old East Stand in 1983, being financed by the sale of ten-year tickets. In October 2005, a small fire in the north terrace put the terrace out of commission for all of Ireland&#x27;s Autumn internationals. This meant that people who had travelled from as far away as Australia and New Zealand could not attend the match. The terrace reopened for the first game of the 2006 Six Nations Championship.

On 20 November 1988, Boston College beat Army 38–24 in the Emerald Isle Classic, the first major NCAA American football game ever played in Europe, played before 42,525 fans at the stadium. The Irish Government estimated at the time that the game brought nearly US$30 million in spending to the local economy.

The Football Association of Ireland first leased the ground for international soccer matches in 1971, and from 1990 to 2006, the ground was used for the vast majority of home fixtures by the Republic of Ireland soccer team. The reason for this was that Dalymount Park, the traditional home of Irish soccer was no longer considered an adequate venue for hosting internationals due to its lower capacity and fewer seats. It was primarily to allow midweek international soccer matches to take place in the evening that floodlights were installed in Lansdowne in 1993.

On 15 February 1995, following the 1994 IRA ceasefire, English football hooligans caused the referee to abandon a friendly international after just 27 minutes. Orchestrated by Combat 18, a neo-nazi organisation and members of the hooligan group Chelsea Headhunters. English spectators threw debris (including seats, wood and metal) down at Irish fans in response to a goal being scored by Ireland&#x27;s David Kelly.

In 2004, Shelbourne made it to the final qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League and played La Liga side Deportivo La Coruña at Lansdowne Road in front of 25,000. The match finished 0:0, and following defeat in Spain in the second leg, Shels would host their UEFA Cup first round tie against Lille at Lansdowne as well. That match finished 2:2.

The last international rugby match before demolition was a 61–17 Ireland win over the Pacific Islanders on 26 November 2006. The final football international was a 5–0 win for the Republic of Ireland over San Marino on 15 November 2006. The last football game ever before redevelopment was Derry City&#x27;s FAI Cup Final win against St. Patrick&#x27;s Athletic on 3 December 2006.

The last contest in the old Lansdowne Road Stadium was a rugby match that took place on 31 December 2006. Leinster beat Ulster 20 points to 12 in a Celtic League game that set a record attendance of 48,000 for such a league match. Demolition of the stadium began in May 2007.

==Replacement==


The stadium was replaced by a 50,000 all-seater football and rugby stadium that opened in May 2010. The development of the new stadium was finally announced in January 2004 at a cost of approximately €365 million; of this, €190 million came from the Irish government, with the remainder paid by the IRFU and Football Association of Ireland. The new stadium was designed by Populous, Scott Tallon Walker and Buro Happold, with ME Engineers providing the building services design. The development was originally meant to begin in January 2007. but was delayed. DSM Demolition commenced the works on 17 May 2007.

Football and rugby internationals were mainly played at Croke Park while the Aviva Stadium was being developed, with fixtures in both sports also taking place at Thomond Park, and RDS Arena with Ravenhill Stadium also hosting a rugby international. Croke Park is owned by the Gaelic Athletic Association, whose previous rules did not allow foreign sports to be played on their grounds.

In September 2006, Lars-Christer Olsson, CEO of UEFA, hinted that the new stadium might stage the UEFA Cup Final in 2010. The 2010 final was ultimately awarded to Hamburg, but in January 2009, UEFA named the new ground as the host stadium for the renamed 2011 Europa League Final.

In February 2009, a sponsorship deal, reported to be in the region of €44 million for 10 years, was struck under which the new stadium would be known as Aviva Stadium, which opened on 7 August 2010.

<doc id="375231" wikidata="Q472254" url="?curid=375231" title="Richard Shelby">
<text>Richard Craig Shelby (born May 6, 1934) is an American lawyer and politician who served as a United States senator from Alabama from 1987 to 2023. First elected to the U.S. Senate in 1986 as a Democrat who later switched to the Republican Party in 1994, he chaired the Senate Appropriations Committee from 2018 to 2021. He previously chaired the Senate Intelligence Committee, the Senate Banking Committee, and the Senate Rules Committee. He was the longest-serving U.S. senator from Alabama, surpassing John Sparkman&#x27;s record in March 2019.

Born in Birmingham, Alabama, Shelby earned a law degree from the Birmingham School of Law in 1961. He went on to serve as city prosecutor from 1963 to 1971. During this period he earned an LL.B. from the University of Alabama School of Law (1963), worked as a U.S. magistrate for the Northern District of Alabama (1966–1970) and Special Assistant Attorney General of Alabama (1969–1971). He won a seat in the Alabama Senate in 1970. In 1978, he was elected from the 7th district to the United States House of Representatives, where he was among a group of conservative Democrats known as the boll weevils.

In 1986, Shelby won a tight race as a Democrat for the U.S. Senate. In 1994, the day after the Republican Revolution in which the GOP gained the majority in Congress midway through President Bill Clinton&#x27;s first term, Shelby switched parties and became a Republican. He was reelected by a large margin in 1998, facing no significant electoral opposition thereafter. Apart from his narrow win as a Democrat in 1986, Shelby always won his Senate seat with more than 60% of the vote.

In February 2021, Shelby announced that he would not seek reelection in 2022. Katie Britt, his former chief of staff, won the election to succeed him. At the time of his retirement, he was the dean of Alabama&#x27;s congressional delegation. Due to his party switch, Shelby is the last Democrat to have held or won election to Alabama&#x27;s Class 3 Senate seat.

==Early life and education==
Shelby was born in Birmingham, Alabama, the son of Alice L. (née Skinner) and Ozie Houston Shelby. He graduated in 1953 from Hueytown High School in Hueytown, Alabama, then the University of Alabama, receiving an undergraduate degree in 1957. He was admitted to the Alabama State Bar on August 29, 1961. He received an LL.B. from the University of Alabama School of Law in 1963.

== Early career ==
Shelby is a member of the American Bar Association, the Alabama State Bar, the American Judicature Society, Alabama Law Institute, Delta Chi fraternity, and Phi Alpha Delta legal fraternity.

Shelby was a city prosecutor in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, from 1963 to 1971. From 1966 to 1970, he was a U.S. Magistrate for the Northern District of Alabama; from 1969 to 1971, he was a special assistant state attorney general.

Shelby was elected to the Alabama Senate in 1970 and served until 1978. That year he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from the Tuscaloosa-based 7th district upon Walter Flowers&#x27;s retirement. He was reelected three times. Shelby was one of the more conservative Democrats in Congress, and a member of the boll weevils, a group of moderate to conservative-leaning Democrats who often worked with President Ronald Reagan on defense issues.

==U.S. Senate==
===Elections===
====1986====
In the 1986 U.S. Senate election in Alabama, Shelby won the Democratic nomination for the Senate seat held by Republican Jeremiah Denton, the first Republican elected to the Senate from Alabama since Reconstruction. He won a very close race as the Democrats regained control of the Senate.

====1992====
Shelby was easily reelected even as Bill Clinton lost Alabama&#x27;s electoral votes.

====1998====
On November 9, 1994, Shelby switched his party affiliation to Republican, one day after the Republican Revolution in which Republicans won control of both houses in the midterm elections, giving them a 53–47 majority in the Senate. He won his first full term as a Republican in 1998 by a large margin.

====2004====
He faced no significant opposition in 2004.

A September 2009 poll showed Shelby had a 58% approval rating, with 35% disapproving.

====2010====
He again faced no significant opposition and was reelected to a fifth term.

In 2014, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; criticized Shelby for hoarding campaign and PAC contributions and not sharing them with colleagues.

====2016====
He was reelected to a sixth term.

=== Tenure ===
====1980s====

In 1987, Shelby opposed Reagan&#x27;s nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court, a move attributed to lobbying by Alabama African-American leaders who reminded Shelby that he had relied on support from black voters in narrowly defeating Denton in 1986. In 1991, Shelby supported President George H. W. Bush&#x27;s conservative Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas.

====1990s====
In 1991, Shelby sponsored legislation granting federal recognition to the MOWA Band of Choctaw Indians. Though confident it would pass, Shelby stressed the &quot;need to get more documentation regarding establishment of their tribal identity.&quot; The Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs voted 11 to 2 in favor of the legislation on July 18.

Shelby publicly feuded with President Bill Clinton during the first half of Clinton&#x27;s first term. At a meeting with Vice President Al Gore, he turned to the TV cameras and denounced the Clinton program as &quot;high on taxes, low on [spending] cuts&quot;.

Shelby served on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence from 1995 to 2003, stepping down because of a Senate rule limiting committee terms to eight years. He took an adversarial stance toward the intelligence community during both the Clinton and Bush administrations. He helped sink Anthony Lake&#x27;s nomination as CIA director in 1997 and promised to investigate the use of American-made satellites by the Chinese to gather intelligence. Shelby took a hard line on leaks of classified information. In 2000 he introduced a bill, vetoed by Clinton, &quot;that would have broadened the law that criminalizes release of national defense information.&quot; According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;:

Civil liberties groups and news organizations, which argued that the legislation would chill their ability to get information from officials, lobbied for the veto. ...In 2002, with George W. Bush in the White House, Shelby reintroduced his language, but then-Attorney General John D. Ashcroft said that &quot;rigorous investigation&quot; and enforcement of existing laws—not new legislation—were the best way to fight leaks.

In 1991, Shelby supported the Crime Bill S.1241 sponsored by Senator Joseph Biden that instituted a national waiting period for handgun purchases as well as a federal ban on semi-automatic firearms.

In January 1992, Shelby met with Chair of the Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan, advocating that the basic cost of money be reduced from 3.5% to 3% to stimulate the economy. He confirmed afterward that he intended to vote for Greenspan for another term as Federal Reserve Chair and said that Greenspan was not opposed to his suggestion to cut the discount rate to its lowest in 20 years in addition to agreeing with him on the need for a restoration of investment tax credits and a special tax rate for capital gains along with the providing of incentives to encourage savings.

In 1992, Shelby&#x27;s aide Tom Barnes was murdered in a hold-up robbery. In response, Shelby supported the reinstatement of the death penalty in D.C.

In 1999, Shelby opposed the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act, which repealed parts of the Glass–Steagall Legislation, and was the only Republican senator and one of eight senators overall to vote against it.

On February 12, 1999, Shelby was one of 50 senators to vote to convict and remove Bill Clinton from office.

====2000s====
Shelby was highly critical of CIA Director George Tenet in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. From 2003 until 2007, he chaired the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs. As of 2022, he was a member of the Appropriations Committee and chaired its subcommittee on Commerce, Justice and Science and was formerly a member of the Special Committee on Aging. He lost his chairmanships in 2007 when Democrats regained control of the Senate.

In 2004, a federal investigation concluded that Shelby revealed classified information to the media while a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Specifically, he revealed classified information on June 19, 2002, to Carl Cameron, the chief political correspondent on Fox News. The information consisted of two messages between Al-Qaeda operatives intercepted by the National Security Agency on September 10, 2001, but not translated until the day after the attacks—&quot;the match is about to begin&quot; and &quot;tomorrow is zero hour.&quot; The Department of Justice declined to file criminal charges against Shelby and transferred the case to the Senate Ethics Committee. In 2005 the committee concluded its probe into the leak.

As chair of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, &amp; Urban Affairs, Shelby opposed legislation that would have permitted additional competition in the title insurance industry.

Shelby co-chaired the Congressional Privacy Caucus and Zero Capital Gains Tax Caucus. He was also the Senate co-chair of the National Security Caucus and a member of the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the Senate Centrist Coalition.

In March 2009, as the Obama administration was expected to reverse limits on embryonic stem-cell research imposed by the Bush administration, Shelby said, &quot;My basic tenet here is I don&#x27;t think we should create life to enhance life and to do research and so forth. I know that people argue there are other ways. I think we should continue our biomedical research everywhere we can, but we should have some ethics about it.&quot; Later that month, he was one of 14 senators to vote against a procedural move that essentially guaranteed a major expansion of a national service corps. The Congressional Budget Office estimated the bill&#x27;s cost for the fiscal year 2010 of $418 million and around $5.7 billion for 2010 through 2014.

In February 2010, Shelby placed a hold on more than 70 of Obama&#x27;s nominees to various government posts, in a protest over an Air Force KC-135 Stratotanker contract and the FBI&#x27;s Terrorist Explosive Device Analytical Center. He lifted all but three of the holds three days later, saying, &quot;The purpose of placing numerous holds was to get the White House&#x27;s attention on two issues that are critical to our national security—the Air Force&#x27;s aerial refueling tanker acquisition and the FBI&#x27;s Terrorist Device Analytical Center (TEDAC). With that accomplished, Sen. Shelby has decided to release his holds on all but a few nominees directly related to the Air Force tanker acquisition until the new Request for Proposal is issued.&quot; White House spokesman Robert Gibbs criticized Shelby for &quot;hold[ing] up qualified nominees for positions that are needed because he didn&#x27;t get two earmarks&quot;; Shelby denied the holds were over earmarks.

====2010s====

Shelby&#x27;s high campaign contribution spending has been criticized; from 2008 until 2014 he had reimbursed himself and his wife more than $500,000 from his campaign and leadership PACs. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; called him a &quot;stingy lawmaker&quot;.

In May 2011, Shelby was one of five Republicans to vote against a Republican bill expanding offshore oil and gas drilling in U.S. coastal waters and requiring the Interior Department to complete multiple offshore lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and off the coasts of Virginia and Alaska.

In March 2015, Shelby announced the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee would &quot;review proposals aimed at providing greater clarity in Fed decision-making and at reforming the composition of Federal Reserve System&quot; and that he had asked for input from the original regional reserve bank presidents for the Federal Reserve.

In March 2017, Shelby called Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch &quot;an outstanding nominee” and said that Republicans should abolish the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees if Democrats blocked his appointment, arguing that that party used the &quot;nuclear option&quot; first.

In December 2017, after Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley issued a statement requesting that the nomination of Brett Talley for federal judge in Alabama be withdrawn, a spokesman for Shelby said that Shelby considered Talley &quot;a great young attorney&quot; and had spoken with him the previous week while asking &quot;for his letter of withdrawal in hopes that Mr. Talley can gain more experience.&quot;

In August 2018, after Rand Paul proposed an amendment to tie a spending bill to the funding of Planned Parenthood, Shelby warned that the amendment could attract supporters while becoming a spoiler for a larger government spending bill.

In September 2018, Shelby reported that the House and Senate were close to a deal on a third package of spending bills for 2019. Representative Nita Lowey disputed the claim, saying that she did not believe a deal would be reached until after the House adjourned and a House Republican aide responded that there was no time to complete the package.

In November 2018, Shelby, Senators Mitch McConnell, and John Thune met with President Trump at the White House, Shelby stating after the meeting that he told Trump the Republicans should avoid a partial government shutdown over Trump&#x27;s wishes for a border wall and that he was unsure whether Trump&#x27;s position was affected by his comments.

In February 2019, after Trump delivered the 2019 State of the Union Address, Shelby called it a reiteration of Trump&#x27;s support for the U.S.-Mexico border wall and confirmed an interaction with House Appropriations Committee chair Nita Lowey, a leading Democratic negotiator.

====2020s====

In September 2020, with less than two months left in the presidential election, Shelby supported an immediate Senate vote on Trump&#x27;s nominee to fill the Supreme Court vacancy caused by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg&#x27;s death. Yet in March 2016, Shelby refused to consider Obama&#x27;s Supreme Court nominee, saying the &quot;decision should be made after the upcoming presidential election so that the American people have a voice.&quot;

During the January 6 United States Capitol attack, Shelby called for law and order via Twitter.

Shelby has a lifetime ideology score of 77.43 from the politically conservative American Conservative Union&#x27;s Center for Legislative Accountability. The politically liberal Americans for Democratic Action gave him a score of zero in their 2019 report.

===Abortion===
Shelby opposes abortion and said on his Senate campaign website that &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; is &quot;terribly flawed on both a constitutional and moral basis.&quot; He also opposes taxpayer funding of Planned Parenthood and voted against a short-term funding bill in Congress because it did not defund Planned Parenthood. When &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; was overturned in June 2022, Shelby called it &quot;welcome news&quot; and said, &quot;It is our moral and ethical duty to protect the dignity of human life, particularly when it comes to the unborn.&quot;

===Budget and economy===
Both during the George W. Bush administration, in 2008, and the Obama administration, in 2009, Shelby was vocal in his opposition to bailing out banks and other corporations (such as AIG).

In 2010, Shelby initially opposed the Republican Party&#x27;s moratorium on earmark funding. The same year, he voted to block three amendments to regulate banks, including an amendment #3812 to S. 3217 to cap ATM fees at $0.50 per transaction and to bar banks borrowing taxpayer money through TARP funds to use those funds for their own benefit.

In 2011, Shelby opposed the nomination of Nobel Economics Prize laureate and Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Peter Diamond to the board of the Federal Reserve on the grounds that Diamond &quot;lacked the necessary qualifications&quot;. Since becoming Senate Banking chair, Shelby has made &quot;regulatory relief and financial regulation reform his top priority&quot;. In May 2015, he revealed the so-called Shelby Bill, easing regulatory restrictions on smaller banks and increasing scrutiny of the Federal Reserve.

In May 2015, Shelby introduced legislation that if enacted would increase congressional scrutiny of the Federal Reserve and ease some regulatory burdens on multiple small banks and loosen oversight to banks such as U.S. Bancorp and SunTrust Banks enacted under the Dodd-Frank Act. In a written statement, he called the legislation &quot;a working document intended to initiate a conversation with all members of the committee who are interested in reaching a bipartisan agreement to improve access to credit and to reduce the level of risk in our financial system.&quot;

===Civil rights===
Shelby voted to make English the sole language of the federal government.

He voted for the Federal Marriage Amendment.

During the 115th Congress, Shelby received a 4% rating from the ACLU, as well as a 0% rating for the 116th Congress.

===Bill Clinton===
In 1993, Shelby, who was still a Democrat at the time, was one of six Democratic senators to vote against the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993.

In 1999, Shelby was one of ten Republican senators to vote to acquit President Bill Clinton on the charge of perjury when Clinton was tried in the Senate in 1999, but he voted to convict Clinton of obstruction of justice.

===Foreign policy===
====Iran====
In December 2002, Shelby said, &quot;We don&#x27;t need another nuclear power -- not with Iran sponsoring terrorism that it has in the past. The fact that they are seemingly pursuing an avenue to build nuclear weapons should be disturbing to everybody.&quot;

In March 2015, Shelby was one of 47 Republican senators to sign a letter to Iran warning that a nuclear deal with the U.S. would have to first be approved by Congress. In July, he called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action &quot;a bad deal&quot; and questioned why the U.S. would support the agreement if Russia President Vladimir Putin favored it.

In September 2016, Shelby was one of 34 senators to sign a letter to United States Secretary of State John Kerry advocating that the U.S. use &quot;all available tools to dissuade Russia from continuing its airstrikes in Syria&quot; from an Iranian airbase near Hamadan &quot;that are clearly not in our interest&quot; and stating that the US should enforce the airstrikes&#x27; violation of &quot;a legally binding Security Council Resolution&quot; on Iran.

====Russia====
In December 2010, Shelby was one of 26 senators to vote against the ratification of New Start, a nuclear arms reduction treaty between the U.S. and the Russian Federation obliging both countries to have no more than 1,550 strategic warheads as well as 700 launchers deployed during the next seven years along with providing a continuation of on-site inspections that halted when START I expired the previous year. It was the first arms treaty with Russia in eight years. In January 2021, Shelby voted for Senate measure S.3436, which would impose sanctions on operators of the Nord Stream pipeline. Democrats blocked the measure.

====Saudi Arabia====
In March 2018, Shelby voted to table a resolution spearheaded by Bernie Sanders, Chris Murphy, and Mike Lee that would have required Trump to withdraw American troops either in or influencing Yemen in the next 30 days unless they were combating Al-Qaeda.

===Gun law===

Shelby has an A+ rating from the NRA Political Victory Fund for his support of gun rights. In 2016, he voted against the Feinstein Amendment, which sought to stop the sale of firearms to people known or suspected to be terrorists. Asked by Scott Wapner why he voted against it, Shelby said, &quot;I do believe that we should keep guns out of the hands of terrorists, would-be terrorists, and a lot of other people.&quot;

In January 2019, Shelby was one of 31 Republican senators to cosponsor the Constitutional Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, a bill introduced by John Cornyn and Ted Cruz that would grant individuals with concealed carry privileges in their home state the right to exercise this right in any other state with concealed carry laws while concurrently abiding by that state’s laws.

===Health care===
Shelby opposed Obama&#x27;s health reform legislation, voting against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in December 2009 and against the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.

In August 2009, Shelby opined that the United States had &quot;the best health care system in the world&quot; and cited the need to expand the system without destroying it.

After Senator Ted Cruz&#x27;s 21-hour speech opposing the Affordable Care Act, Shelby joined Cruz and 17 other senators in a failed vote against cloture on a comprehensive government funding bill that would also have continued funding healthcare reform.

In September 2017, after the Senate reached an agreement during a lunch not to vote on a Republican bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act that week, Shelby said, &quot;Why have a vote if you know what the outcome is and it&#x27;s not what you want? I don&#x27;t know what you gain from that. But I do believe that the health care issue is not dead, and that&#x27;s what counts.&quot;

===Immigration===
Shelby voted for a 1994 moratorium on certain forms of immigration.

===Space===
Shelby has supported development of the Space Launch System (SLS), but disagreed with how funds for the program have been spent. In 2011 he favored competition for the strap-on booster design. The SLS earmark has been opposed by fiscal conservative groups, including the Tea Party.

===Taxes===
Shelby supports a flat tax and supported the Bush Administration&#x27;s tax cuts. He cites disagreements with Democrats on tax policy as one of the main reasons he became a Republican; he feels the Democrats are too willing to enact tax increases.

Shelby is a signer of Americans for Tax Reform&#x27;s Taxpayer Protection Pledge.

===Donald Trump===

During the first impeachment trial of Donald Trump, Shelby opposed the introduction of new witnesses and voted to acquit.

During the second impeachment trial of Donald Trump, Shelby voted to acquit based on his belief that impeachment does not apply to former officials.

On May 28, 2021, Shelby abstained from voting on the creation of an independent commission to investigate the 2021 United States Capitol attack.
