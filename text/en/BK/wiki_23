<text>Thomas James Perkins (January 7, 1932 – June 7, 2016) was an American businessman and venture capitalist who was one of the founders of the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins.

==Biography==
Perkins received a B.S. in electrical engineering and computer science from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1953. He earned an MBA from Harvard University in 1957. While attending MIT, Perkins joined the Delta Upsilon fraternity. Perkins was mentored by Georges Doriot.

===Career===
In 1963, he was invited by Bill Hewlett and David Packard to become the administrative head of the research department at Hewlett-Packard. He was the first general manager of HP&#x27;s computer divisions, credited with helping shepherd HP&#x27;s entry into the minicomputer business. During the 1960s, he also started University Laboratories, which was later merged into Spectra-Physics. At University Laboratories he was the co-developer of the first low-cost He-Ne laser, having had the idea of how to directly integrate the laser cavity mirrors inside the plasma tube.

In 1973, with Eugene Kleiner, he founded Kleiner Perkins, one of the first Sand Hill Road venture capital firms. Later, Frank J. Caufield and Brook Byers joined the firm, eventually becoming named partners. Perkins was a director at Applied Materials, Compaq, Corning Glass, Genentech, Hewlett-Packard, and Philips Electronics. He was chairman of Tandem Computers, from its founding in 1974 until its 1997 merger with Compaq. Perkins was also chairman of Genentech from 1976 until 1990, when it merged with Roche Holding Ltd.

During the HP/Compaq merger fight in 2001, Perkins was a member of the Compaq board and an outspoken supporter of the merger. He joined the HP board of directors in the merger, retired, and officially rejoined the HP board days before Carly Fiorina was forced to resign from her posts as chairman and chief executive officer of HP. Perkins led efforts to force Fiorina out.

====Resignation from HP Board====

Perkins resigned from HP&#x27;s board on May 18, 2006, over the actions taken by the board&#x27;s chair, Patricia C. Dunn, to ferret out the board-level source of media leaks using methods Perkins considered unethical and possibly illegal. HP gave no cause in the SEC-required 8-K filing, and according to Perkins refused to amend the filing to indicate his reasons for resigning. In response, Perkins disclosed his reasons publicly, triggering an SEC investigation and significant media interest into HP&#x27;s leak-finding activities.

Perkins&#x27;s residential phone records were obtained through a method known as pretexting. AT&amp;T confirmed that someone pretended to be Perkins, using his phone number and his Social Security Number. HP confirmed that the investigative firm they hired used pretexting to obtain information on the call records of the directors. HP&#x27;s investigation found that Dr. George Keyworth was the source of several leaks. At the May 18, 2006 board meeting, Keyworth admitted to leaking information but refused to resign after the board passed a resolution calling for his resignation. HP&#x27;s board decided on August 31, 2006, to not renominate Keyworth for another term as director.

The Securities and Exchange Commission and the State of California began inquiries into the methods used by HP to investigate its directors.

====News Corp. board====
Perkins sat on the board of directors of Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Corporation along with Viet D. Dinh. Dinh represented Perkins in the HP board affair. In July, 2011, Dinh and fellow News Corp. board member Joel Klein took over the investigation of the News of the World phone hacking affair and related Corporation issues. One business commentator, noting Perkins&#x27; prior experience with phone-hacking in the HP scandal, speculated that Perkins &quot;may be [was the] best hope&quot; as News Corp. sought to work out of its phone-hacking scandal. Perkins did not stand for reelection to the News Corp board for the fiscal year of 2012.

==Personal life==
, Perkins was worth an estimated $8 billion He had two children, with his first wife, the late Gerd Thune-Ellefsen. After she died in 1994, he married romance novelist Danielle Steel in March 1998; her book &quot;The Klone and I&quot; () was about their friendship. They separated in August 1999 and were later amicably divorced.

In 1996, Perkins was convicted in France of involuntary manslaughter arising from a yacht-racing collision and was fined $10,000.

Perkins was the subject of a 2007 &quot;60 Minutes&quot; special titled &quot;Captain of Capitalism&quot;, which focused on his memoir and featured a tour of his yacht. He was also featured in the documentary film &quot;Something Ventured&quot;, which premiered in 2011.

===Criticism for &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; comment===
In January 2014, the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; published a letter from Perkins that compared the &quot;progressive war on the American one percent&quot; of wealthiest Americans and the Occupy movement&#x27;s &quot;demonization of the rich&quot; to the Kristallnacht and anti-semitism in Nazi Germany:

Writing from the epicenter of progressive thought, San Francisco, I would call attention to the parallels of fascist Nazi Germany to its war on the &quot;one percent&quot;, namely its Jews, to the progressive war on the American one percent, namely the &quot;rich.&quot;

The letter was widely criticized and condemned in &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, &quot;The Independent&quot;, among bloggers, Twitter users, and &quot;his own colleagues in Silicon Valley&quot;. Perkins subsequently apologized for making the comparisons with Nazi Germany, but otherwise stood by his letter, saying, &quot;In the Nazi era it was racial demonization, now it&#x27;s class demonization.&quot;

A month after publication of the letter in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, Perkins stated in a Commonwealth Club interview (which can be seen on YouTube) when asked at the ending for his 60-minute &quot;Plan to Save the World&quot; he said that he believed elections should be set up such that the number of votes a person can cast would be proportional to the amount of taxes that the person pays. Both Perkins, the moderator and the audience were laughing. In an interview afterwards, Perkins said &quot;I intended to be outrageous, and it was.&quot;

===Homes and yachts===
Perkins had houses in Belvedere, Marin County, California, and spent about two months a year at Plumpton Place, his Elizabethan mansion in East Sussex, England, which once belonged to Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page. In 2010, he purchased the penthouse atop the Millennium Tower on Mission Street in San Francisco&#x27;s financial district.

In July 2006, he formally launched his sailing yacht named &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;, at the time the world&#x27;s largest privately owned sailing yacht. The yacht was listed for sale in 2006 on Yachtworld.com, the asking price being €99m with engine hours listed at 1,890 hours. Perkins sold the yacht for £60 million in July 2009.

In 2011 Perkins acquired a Japanese fisheries training vessel, and had it converted into an &quot;adventure&quot; yacht named &quot;Dr. No&quot; which is used to carry a &quot;Deep Flight&quot; submarine, manufactured by Hawkes Ocean Technologies, of Richmond California. The boat has a website which carries a link to a video documenting encounters with Humpback whales at depth in Tonga.

===Death===
Perkins died June 7, 2016, after a prolonged illness at his home in Marin County, California, aged 84.

<doc id="378335" wikidata="Q7962149" url="?curid=378335" title="Walkabout (pub chain)">
<text>Walkabout is an Australian themed pub and restaurant chain in the United Kingdom, owned by Stonegate Pubs since December 2016.

== History ==

The first Walkabout bar was opened in 1994. In December 2016, it was reported that the brand had 30 outlets, down from a peak of about 50.

In 2009, Walkabout&#x27;s parent company went into administration. A number of unprofitable sites were closed and the company refinanced itself.

In the 2010s, Walkabout came under pressure by boroughs keen to clean up and gentrify their high streets. Its Covent Garden branch, which was the first to open in the mid &#x27;90s, was closed in March 2013 with the company saying the site was too small. There were 30 Walkabouts left operating at this time. Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Walkabout, one of their best known branches, closed in October 2013, leaving only one branch of Walkabout in London. This closed in 2017.

Commencing in 2013, Walkabout embarked on a refurbishment programme across the estate, with the following sites being refurbished: Derby, Carlisle, Lincoln and Blackpool. Following a hiatus in the refurbishment programme works began in earnest in 2015 starting in March with Walkabout Bristol, followed by Sheffield and Newquay. Also the first new Walkabout for 6 years opened in Brighton (in the former Walkabout site); other new venues popped up in Solihull and Lichfield (following the purchase of two former Apres sites). 2015 finished with the opening of a new Walkabout in Manchester&#x27;s Printworks just before Christmas.

2016 began with the refurbishment of the Walkabout Birmingham on Broad St. Throughout the year, many other existing venues were refurbished, now functioning as new concept Walkabouts. They also have continued to acquire a variety of new sites across the UK and close others.

The most recent opening was in Chelmsford, where the site transitioned from a Wetherspoons to a new Walkabout bar in under three weeks. In contrast, Walkabout&#x27;s Liverpool venue closed on New Year&#x27;s Day 2018 after 20 years.

Walkabout has also evolved through innovation, from collaborations with Pieminister and Kilner, to developments in their food offering and stadium seating being added to the Reading venue for watching sports.

<doc id="378347" wikidata="Q380352" url="?curid=378347" title="Willem de Vlamingh">
<text>Willem Hesselsz de Vlamingh (baptized 28 November 1640 – after 7 August 1702) was a Dutch sea captain who explored the central west coast of New Holland (Australia) in the late 17th century, where he landed in what is now Perth on the Swan River. The purpose of the mission was to look for survivors of the &quot;Ridderschap van Holland&quot;: this effort proved fruitless, but de Vlamingh charted parts of the continent&#x27;s western coast.

== Early life ==
Willem de Vlamingh was born in Oost-Vlieland in the Dutch Republic. He was baptised on 28 November 1640. In 1664, de Vlamingh sailed to Novaya Zemlya and discovered Jelmerland. In 1668, he married; his profession was skipper in whaling, and he still lived on the island Vlieland. In 1687, he and his wife sold their &quot;apartment&quot; in the Jordaan.

De Vlamingh joined the Dutch East India Company (VOC) in 1688, and made his first voyage to Batavia in the same year. Following a second voyage, in 1694, he was asked, on request of Nicolaes Witsen, to mount an expedition to search for the , a VOC capital ship that was lost with 325 passengers and crew on its way to Batavia in 1694. VOC officials believed it might have run aground on the western coast of Australia.

== Rescue mission ==

In 1696, de Vlamingh commanded the rescue mission to Australia&#x27;s west coast to look for survivors of the &quot;Ridderschap van Holland&quot; that had gone missing two years earlier, and had admiral Sir James Couper on board. There were three ships under his command: the frigate &quot;Geelvink&quot;, captained by de Vlamingh himself; the &quot;Nijptang&quot;, under Captain Gerrit Collaert; and the galiot &quot;Weseltje&quot;, under Captain Cornelis de Vlamingh, son of Willem de Vlamingh. The expedition departed Texel &#x27;strictly incognito&#x27; on 3 May 1696 and, because of the Nine Years&#x27; War with France, sailed around the coast of Scotland to Tristan da Cunha. In early September the three ships arrived at Cape of Good Hope, where they stayed for seven weeks because of scurvy among the crew. There, Cornelis de Vlamingh took command after Laurens T. Zeeman died. On 27 October, they left using the Brouwer Route on the Indian Ocean route from the African Cape of Good Hope to the Dutch East Indies. On their way east they checked Île Saint-Paul and Île Amsterdam, but no wreckage or survivors were found. On 5 December they sailed on.

On 29 December 1696, de Vlamingh&#x27;s party landed on Rottnest Island. He saw numerous quokkas (a native marsupial), and thinking they were large rats he named it &quot;″t Eylandt &#x27;t Rottenest&quot; (&quot;Rats&#x27; Nest Island&quot;). He afterwards wrote of it in his journal: &quot;I had great pleasure in admiring this island, which is very attractive, and where it seems to me that nature has denied nothing to make it pleasurable beyond all islands I have ever seen, being very well provided for man&#x27;s well-being, with timber, stone, and lime for building him houses, only lacking ploughmen to fill these fine plains. There is plentiful salt, and the coast is full of fish. Birds make themselves heard with pleasant song in these scented groves. So I believe that of the many people who seek to make themselves happy, there are many who would scorn the fortunes of our country for the choice of this one here, which would seem a paradise on earth&quot;.

On 10 January 1697, he ventured up the Swan River. He and his crew are believed to have been the first Europeans to do so. They are also assumed to be the first Europeans to see black swans, and de Vlamingh named the Swan River (&quot;Zwaanenrivier&quot; in Dutch) after the large number they observed there. The crew split into three parties, hoping to catch an Aboriginal, but about five days later they gave up their quest to catch a &quot;South lander&quot;.

On 22 January, they sailed through the Geelvink Channel. The next days they saw ten naked, black people. On 24 January they passed Red Bluff. Near Wittecarra they went looking for fresh water. On 4 February 1697, he landed at Dirk Hartog Island, Western Australia, and replaced the pewter plate left by Dirk Hartog in 1616 with a new one that bore a record of both of the Dutch sea-captains&#x27; visits. The original plate is preserved in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam.

De Vlamingh, with his son and Collaert, commanded a return fleet from the Indies on 3 or 11 February 1698, which arrived in his hometown, Amsterdam, on 16 August. However, it is not certain that de Vlamingh was still alive at that point, and burial records from Vlieland around this time do not exist. On an earlier retourship, de Vlamingh had sent Witsen a box with seashells, fruits and vegetation from New Holland (Australia), as well as eleven drawings that Victor Victorsz had made on the expedition. De Vlamingh also included some black swans, but they died on the voyage. Witsen offered the drawings to Martin Lister. Witsen, who had invested in the journey, was disappointed the men had been more interested in setting up trade than in exploring. In 1699, William Dampier would explore the coast of Australia and New Guinea.

<text>The Games Machine is a video game magazine that was published from 1987 until 1990 in the United Kingdom by Newsfield, which also published &quot;CRASH&quot;, &quot;Zzap!64&quot;, &quot;Amtix!&quot; and other magazines.

==History==
&quot;The Games Machine&quot; ran head to head with Future&#x27;s recently launched &quot;ACE&quot; and EMAP&#x27;s long running &quot;C&amp;VG&quot; magazines. Unhappy with the profits from the title Newsfield decided to end the title in 1990.

Newsfield however would, more or less, continue with a multi format magazine with &quot;Raze&quot;. This new title would concentrate on the ever rising consoles like the Mega Drive as well as the established NES and Master System.

==&quot;The Games Machine&quot; in Italy==

A magazine with the same name is still being published in Italy. While it started as an Italian translated version of the British magazine, it currently publishes original articles, and is one of the best selling PC games magazines in Italy.

<doc id="378357" wikidata="Q20715023" url="?curid=378357" title="First lieutenant">
<text>First lieutenant is a commissioned officer military rank in many armed forces; in some forces, it is an .

The rank of lieutenant has different meanings in different military formations, but in most forces it is sub-divided into a senior (first lieutenant) and junior (second lieutenant) rank.

In navies, while certain rank insignia may carry the name lieutenant, the term may also be used to relate to a particular post or duty, rather than a rank.

==Indonesia==
In Indonesia, &quot;first lieutenant&quot; is known as &quot;Letnan Satu&quot; (&quot;Lettu&quot;), Indonesian National Armed Forces uses this rank across all three of its services. It is just above the rank of second lieutenant and just below the rank of captain.

==Israel==

In the Israel Defense Forces, the rank above second lieutenant is simply lieutenant (Segen). The rank of (קצין מקצועי אקדמאי (קמ&quot;א (&quot;katsín miktsoí akademai&quot; or &quot;kama&quot;), a professional academic officer (that is, a medical, dental or veterinary officer, a justice officer or a religious officer), is equivalent to a professional officer of the second class in the reserve and equivalent to first lieutenant.

==United Kingdom==

===British Army===

In the British Army and Royal Marines, the rank above second lieutenant is simply lieutenant (pronounced &quot;lef-tenant&quot;), with no ordinal attached.

Before 1871, when the whole British Army switched to using the current rank of &quot;lieutenant&quot;, the Royal Artillery, Royal Engineers and fusilier regiments used &quot;first lieutenant&quot; and &quot;second lieutenant&quot;.

===Royal Navy===
The &quot;first lieutenant&quot; (often abbreviated &quot;1st Lt&quot;) in a Royal Navy ship is a post or appointment, rather than a rank.

Historically the lieutenants in a ship were ranked in accordance with seniority, with the most senior being termed the first lieutenant and acting as the second-in-command, unless the ship was complemented with a commander. Although lieutenants are no longer ranked by seniority, the post of &quot;first lieutenant&quot; remains. In minor war vessels, destroyers, frigates, and submarines, the &quot;first lieutenant&quot; is second in command, executive officer (XO) and head of the executive branch; in larger ships where a commander of the warfare specialization is appointed as the executive officer, a &quot;first lieutenant&quot; is appointed as their deputy. The post of &quot;first lieutenant&quot; in a shore establishment carries a similar responsibility to the &quot;first lieutenant&quot; of a capital ship. Colloquial terms in the Royal Navy for the &quot;first lieutenant&quot; include &quot;number one&quot;, &quot;the jimmy&quot; (or &quot;jimmy the one&quot;) and &quot;James the First&quot; (a back-formation referring to James I of England). The first lieutenant may hold the rank of sub-lieutenant, lieutenant or lieutenant-commander.

==United States==
===U.S. Army, U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Air Force, and U.S. Space Force===

In the U.S. Army, U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Air Force, and U.S. Space Force, a first lieutenant is a junior commissioned officer. It is just above the rank of second lieutenant and just below the rank of captain. It is equivalent to the rank of lieutenant (junior grade) in the other uniformed services.

Promotion to first lieutenant is governed by Department of Defense policies derived from the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act of 1980. DOPMA guidelines suggest all &quot;fully qualified&quot; officers should be promoted to first lieutenant. A second lieutenant (grade O-1) is usually promoted to first lieutenant (grade O-2) after 18 months in the Army or 24 months in the Marine Corps and Air Force. The difference between the two ranks is slight, primarily being experience and a higher pay grade. It is not uncommon to see officers moved to positions requiring more experience after promotion to first lieutenant. For example, in the Army and Marine Corps these positions can include leading a specialty platoon, or assignment as the executive officer for a company-sized unit (70–250 soldiers or marines). In the Air Force, a first lieutenant may be a flight commander or section&#x27;s officer in charge with varied supervisory responsibilities, including supervision of as many as 100+ personnel, although in a flying unit, a first lieutenant is a rated officer (pilot, navigator, or air battle manager) who has just finished training for his career field and has few supervisory responsibilities.

===U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard===
In the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard, &quot;first lieutenant&quot; is the name of a billet and position title, rather than rank. Officers aboard early sailing ships were the captain and a number of lieutenants. The senior among those lieutenants was known as the first lieutenant, and would have assumed command if the captain were absent or incapacitated. As modern ships have become more complex, requiring specialized knowledge of engineering, communications, and weapons, the &quot;first lieutenant&quot; is the officer in command of the deck department responsible for line handling during mooring and underway replenishment. On smaller ships, the officer of the &quot;first lieutenant&quot; billet holds the rank of lieutenant, junior grade or ensign. On larger vessels, the position of &quot;first lieutenant&quot; is held by a lieutenant or, in the case of extremely large warships such as cruisers or aircraft carriers, the position of &quot;first lieutenant&quot; may be held by a lieutenant commander or even commander. However, on submarines and in aircraft squadrons, where the deck department may only have a few junior sailors, the &quot;first lieutenant&quot; billet may be filled by a first-class petty officer or chief petty officer. What is known in the U.S. Navy as the &quot;first lieutenant division&quot; is usually composed of junior sailors (E-3 and below) who are completing their ninety days of temporary assigned duty, or TAD, that all enlisted personnel are required to perform when initially assigned to a command. The primary mission of the division is servicing, cleaning, organizing and inventorying items within a command.

===U.S. Revenue Cutter Service===
The term &quot;first lieutenant&quot; had a dual meaning in the United States Revenue Cutter Service (known until 1894 as the United States Revenue-Marine). The position title of first lieutenant was held by a junior officer who was in charge of deck operations and gunnery. The rank of first lieutenant was the equivalent of lieutenant in the current rank structure of the U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Navy, United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Officer Corps. The next senior officer ranking above first lieutenant was captain and the next two lower officer ranks were second and third lieutenant, respectively. When the Revenue Cutter Service merged with the United States Life-Saving Service to form the U.S. Coast Guard in 1915, the rank of first lieutenant carried over into Coast Guard and remained in use until 1918, when the Coast Guard adopted the rank structure of the U.S. Navy.

<text>A pub chain is a group of pubs or bars operating under a unified brand image. Pubs within a chain are tied houses and can, generally, only sell products which the chain owner sanctions. Pubs in a chain normally display their chain branding prominently and may also feature shared aspects, such as menus and staff uniforms.

Pub chains can exist as a stand-alone operation, often called a &quot;pubco&quot;, or can be a division of a larger company, such as a brewery.

==History==
Pub chains are an evolution of the tied house system. During the latter half of the nineteenth century increased competition between breweries led many of them to buy up local pubs in an attempt to secure markets for their products. Although tied houses had existed in some cities since the seventeenth century, this period has come to be known as the birth of the tied house system. As well as securing markets for their own products, this system provided an efficient supply chain directly from the brewery to the pub; cutting costs for breweries and allowing complete and uninterrupted control over quality.

Most tied houses today are owned by non-brewing pub chains, known as &quot;pubco&#x27;s&quot;. A key difference between this, and the traditional tied house system, is that pubco&#x27;s align themselves with specific brewers in order to obtain big discounts; reducing profits for breweries and restricting their ability to control the quality of the end product.

==Types==
In the United Kingdom, there are two types of pub chain, reflecting the ownership of the pub and the style of operations. Pubs are either tenanted or managed.

Marston&#x27;s Brewery and Stonegate Pub Company are two of the largest pub chains in the UK operating multiple brands of branded pubs.

Pub chains such as Punch Taverns and Ei Group own thousands of tenanted pubs which are not branded to retain uniqueness. They are controlled in the brands of beer, ales and lagers and sometimes other beverages that they may sell.

Pub chains operating managed houses are frequently run as brands, located near a high street but rarely in predominantly residential areas.

Multiple-held pubs do exist in countries other than the United Kingdom, but due to most countries having different accepted systems of ownership and supply, they do not hold anywhere near the level of control over the market as they do in the UK.

<doc id="378359" wikidata="Q3315094" url="?curid=378359" title="Prime Minister of Hungary">
<text>The prime minister of Hungary () is the head of government of Hungary. The prime minister and the Cabinet are collectively accountable for their policies and actions to the Parliament, to their political party and ultimately to the electorate. The current holder of the office is Viktor Orbán, leader of the Fidesz – Hungarian Civic Alliance, who has served since 29 May 2010.

According to the Hungarian Constitution, the prime minister is nominated by the president of Hungary and formally elected by the National Assembly. Constitutionally, the president is required to nominate the leader of the political party who wins a majority of seats in the National Assembly as prime minister. If there is no party with a majority, the president holds an audience with the leaders of all parties represented in the assembly and nominates the person who is most likely to command a majority in the assembly, who is then formally elected by a simple majority of the assembly. In practice, when this situation occurs, the prime minister is the leader of the party winning a plurality of votes in the election, or the leader of the senior partner in the governing coalition.

== Official title ==
The title of Hungary&#x27;s head of government in Hungarian is &quot;miniszterelnök&quot;. Literally translated, this means &quot;minister-president&quot;. However, since &quot;prime minister&quot; or &quot;premier&quot; is the more usual title in a parliamentary system for a head of government in English-speaking nations, the title is translated as &quot;prime minister&quot; by most English sources.

== History of the office ==
=== Palatine of Hungary ===

The palatine (, later &#x27;, , , later: &#x27;, ) was the highest dignitary in the Kingdom of Hungary after the king (a kind of powerful Prime Minister and supreme judge) from the kingdom&#x27;s rise up to 1848/1918.

Initially, he was in fact the representative of the king, later the vice-regent (viceroy). In the early centuries of the kingdom, he was appointed by the king, later elected by the Diet of the Kingdom of Hungary. After the Habsburgs solidified their hold of Hungary, the dignity became an appointed position once again. Finally, it became hereditary in a cadet (junior) branch of the Habsburg dynasty after King Francis appointed his brother Joseph.

=== Creation of the position ===

During the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 the revolutionaries wanted the creation of a Hungarian cabinet which would be independent from the Austrian Empire and the Buda Chancellery (which was office of the imperial governor-general). One of the 12 points said: &quot;2. A responsible government in Buda-Pest.&quot;

Ferdinand V appointed Count Lajos Batthyány for the position of prime minister of Hungary on 17 March 1848. The government was called &quot;ministry&quot;, differently from the current acceptation. The ministries were called &quot;departments&quot;. The position was vacant after the defeat of the freedom fight.

<doc id="378360" wikidata="Q47578" url="?curid=378360" title="Vittorio Veneto">
<text>Vittorio Veneto is a city and &quot;comune&quot; situated in the Province of Treviso, in the region of Veneto, Italy, in the northeast of Italy, between the Piave and the Livenza rivers, borders with the following municipalities:

Alpago (BL), Belluno (BL), Cappella Maggiore, Colle Umberto, Conegliano, Fregona, Limana (BL), Revine Lago, San Pietro di Feletto, Tarzo.

==Name==
The city is an amalgamation of two former &quot;comuni&quot;, Cèneda and Serravalle, which were joined into one municipality in 1866 and named Vittorio after the King of Italy, Vittorio Emanuele II. The battle fought nearby in November 1918 became generally known as the Battle of Vittorio Veneto, and the city&#x27;s name was officially changed to Vittorio Veneto in July 1923.
Starting from the end of the nineteenth century, new neighborhoods were created around the road that connected the two towns, the current Viale della Vittoria, so that the union was also physical, and the town hall itself was placed halfway. However, the city still continues to demonstrate a certain bipolarity, and in fact Ceneda and Serravalle, despite their proximity, have very distinct historical identities.

==Geography==
The Meschio River, whose source is located in the Lapisina Valley, a few miles north of the city, passes down through the town from Serravalle through the district that bears its name. The north of Vittorio Veneto is straddled by mountains including the majestic Col Visentin. To the east is the state park and forest of Cansiglio which summits at Monte Pizzoc; to the west, a hill region including Valdobbiadene, where Prosecco wine is produced; and to the south is the commercial town of Conegliano.

=== Administrative subdivisions ===
According to the communal statute, the commune does not recognize any fraction within itself. 
There are numerous distinct areas and local autonomy is guaranteed to the following seven districts (Followed by the main settlements that are part of it).
* 1 - Val Lapisina: Fadalto, Nove, San Floriano, Savassa, Forcal, Longhere, Maren, Fais.
* 2 - Serravalle: Sant&#x27;Andrea, San Lorenzo, Serravalle
* 3 - Center: Centro, Salsa
* 4 - Costa-Meschio: Costa, Meschio
* 5 - Ceneda: Alta and Ceneda Bassa (Saints Peter and Paul)
* 6 - San Giacomo: San Giacomo di Veglia
* 7 - Val dei Fiori: Carpesica, Cozzuolo, Formeniga

==History==

===Ancient period===
The area was occupied in ancient times by Veneti and perhaps Celts. A pagan sanctuary was in use on Monte Altare by Veneti, Celts, and Romans.
During the 1st century BC Emperor Augustus established a &quot;Castrum Cenetense&quot; at the foot of an important pass northward towards Bellunum in what is now the heart of Serravalle to defend Opitergium and the Venetian plain to the south. To the immediate south of the &quot;castrum&quot; there developed a settlement called a &quot;vicus&quot; in what is now Ceneda and Meschio. While its precise course has not been determined, the Via Claudia Altinate running north from the Via Postumia seems to have passed the Roman &quot;castrum&quot; and &quot;vicus&quot; on its eastern side. Meanwhile, there remains evidence of typical Roman land surveying (&quot;centuratio&quot;) with &quot;cardines&quot; being associated with the present day Via Rizzera and Via Cal Alta (in the commune of Cappella Maggiore) and a &quot;decumanus&quot; identified with the Va Cal de Livera. This implies Ceneta became more than a mere &quot;vicus&quot; during the Roman period.

===Late antiquity===
The ancient Pieve di Sant&#x27;Andrea in Bigonzo in the northeast of the town, on the southern end of Serravalle, attests to the presence of Christianity in the area by the 4th century.

In the early 5th century, Emperor Honorius seems to have named a certain Marcellus count (&quot;comes&quot;) of Ceneta. Ceneta and Serravalle were among the places in Venetia devastated by Attila the Hun, but later refortified under the rule of Theodoric, king of the Ostrogoths.

Byzantine writer, Agathias Scholasticus, as well as the Latin poet, Venantius Fortunatus, from nearby Valdobbiadene, are witnesses to the existence of the town of Ceneta in the 6th century. Agathias recounts how during Justinian&#x27;s Gothic War, Ceneda changed hands between the Ostrogoths, Franks, and Byzantines. In fact, after the Byzantines had seized Venetia from the Ostrogoths, they turned their attention to conquering central and southern Italy. In the spring of 553, while Narses was engaging the Ostrogoths, the Franks led by the brothers Leutari and Buccelin took a large part of Venetia and sought refuge in Ceneta, holding it sometime in the spring of 554.

In 568, the Lombards invaded Italy and Ceneda was irrevocably captured from the Byzantines. Lombard social and military colonies called &quot;fara&quot; seem to have been established at Farra d&#x27;Alpago to the north of Ceneda and at Farra di Soligo to the west. It was perhaps at this time or perhaps still later that Ceneda was made into the seat of one of 36 Lombard duchies. The Lombards constructed a castle, now called &quot;castello di San Martino&quot; near the heart of Ceneda on a strategic mountain which overlooks the town. By 667, the Duchy of Ceneda was certainly in existence and grew in size when, according to Paul the Deacon it acquired some of the territory of Oderzo after that city&#x27;s destruction by the Lombards.

In 685, the Lombard King Grimoald I organized Ceneda into an ecclesiastical diocese, assigning to it a large part of the territory that had been under the care of the suppressed diocese of Oderzo. The diocese of Ceneda was within the metropolitan jurisdiction of the Patriarchate of Aquileia. At the foot of the same height upon which the duke&#x27;s castle had been built, a cathedral was constructed. St. Titian, Bishop of Oderzo, whose relics are contained in the present cathedral, was named as co-patron of the diocese along with St. Augusta, a virgin martyr from Serravalle.

===Carolingian period===
With the defeat of the Lombards in 774, Ceneda entered into the Frankish sphere. It seems the duke of Ceneda remained loyal to Charlemagne even when the Lombard dukes of Cividale, Treviso, and Vicenza rebelled the following year.

===Middle Ages===

In 994, the Holy Roman Emperor Otto III invested the bishop of Ceneda with the title and prerogatives of count and authority as temporal lord of the city. The 12th, 13th, and part of the 14th centuries were turbulent for Ceneda and Serravalle. During this time, the bishop of Ceneda was forced into the role of count, and thus, to take part in the politics of Northern Italy and even joining the Lombard League against the Holy Roman Empire. Ceneda also faced threats from its neighbors and in 1147 was attacked by the commune of Treviso. Only the mediation of the pope led to the restitution of what had been stolen, including the relics of St. Titian. In 1174, Serravalle became a fief of the Da Camino family. Ceneda and Serravalle would subsequently be contested by the da Romano family and the Patriarchs of Aquileia. In 1328, the area fell into the hands of the Scaligeri.

In 1307, Bishop Francesco Ramponi ceded the territory of Portobuffolé to Tolberto da Camino in exchange for county of Tarzo (also called Castelnuovo) which included Corbanese, Arfanta, Colmaor and Fratta. In Fratta, authority was invested in a vice-count of the bishop.

===Venetian period===

On December 19, 1389, Ceneda was peacefully incorporated into the Venetian Republic. Its bishops still retained authority as counts. However, in 1447 and in 1514 bishops Francesco and Oliviero, respectively, ceded to the Republic the right of civil investiture within the territory of Ceneda, reserving for themselves and their successors authority over the commune itself and a few villas. The privileges of Ceneda&#x27;s bishops as counts were definitively revoked by the Republic in 1768.

Under Venetian rule, the urban development of Ceneda remained concentrated around the cathedral while the rest of the commune remained primarily agricultural with homes either scattered far and wide or sometimes organized in tiny clusters. Serravalle, however, which had come under Venetian rule in 1337 rose to its greatest splendor under the &quot;Serenissima&quot;, even eclipsing Ceneda in economic and urban development.

In 1411, a Hungarian army led by Pippo Spano attacked Ceneda and destroyed the episcopal archives. Both Ceneda and Serravalle suffered during the War of Cambrai.

A significant Jewish community grew in Ceneda throughout the Venetian period. Lorenzo Da Ponte, a librettist to Mozart, was a Jewish native of Ceneda, who took the bishop of Ceneda&#x27;s name when he was baptized a Roman Catholic.

===Napoleonic era===
In March 1797, the French army of Massena entered the towns putting an end to Venetian rule. By the Treaty of Campoformio, the area passed to the rule of the Holy Roman Empire. From 1805 until 1814 Ceneda and Serravalle were incorporated into Napoleon&#x27;s Kingdom of Italy.

===Austrian period===
After the Fall of Napoleon, the area was given with the rest of Venetia to the Austrian Empire.

===Italian period===
On November 22, 1866, soon after the Veneto was annexed by the Kingdom of Italy, Ceneda and Serravalle were joined into one municipality named after the King of Italy, Vittorio Emanuele.

During the First World War, Vittorio was occupied by Austro-Hungarian forces. In October 1918, Vittorio was the site of the last battle between Italy and Austria-Hungary during World War I. It led to the victory of Italy over the Austro-Hungarian Empire (Austrian-Italian Armistice of Villa Giusti) effective on 4 November 1918.

The word &quot;Veneto&quot;, was attached to the city&#x27;s name in 1923. Subsequently, many streets in other parts of Italy have been named &quot;Via Vittorio Veneto&quot;.

The Italian victory at the Battle of Vittorio Veneto led to the town lending its name as a military honor. Thus, in the 1930s, a battleship was named Vittorio Veneto. In the 1960s, a flight deck cruiser, the flagship of the Italian Navy, was given the same name. In 1968, a military medal called the &quot;Order of Vittorio Veneto&quot; (&quot;Ordine di Vittorio Veneto&quot;) was awarded to Italian veterans who had participated honorably for at least six months during the First World War.

== Economy ==

The ancient manufacturing, steel and textile factories, which have always characterized it and which for the most part followed the lively course of the Meschio river, have now been replaced by others and more numerous, linked to the different productions required by a global economy. The main activities are located in the industrial area of San Giacomo, one of the major regional industrial centers, not only for the multiplicity of productions, but also for the importance and consolidated quality of companies known nationally and internationally.

The presence of vineyards in the municipal area is remarkable, the Permasteelisa group manufacturing plant and also of the De Negri distillery should be noted.

==Culture==
=== Education ===
There are also numerous high schools in the city, most of which are located in the context of the school campus in the city center. Specifically, the high schools in Vittorio Veneto are:

=== Media ===
Radio Palazzo Carli is a community radio managed by a non-profit organization. The RPC Association is not for profit and is proposed as a religious, social and educational sound broadcasting service through the transmission of various self-produced or acquired programs from third parties. There are two detached studios: in Vittorio Veneto and in Conegliano. The connection with the Vittorio Veneto Cathedral and the one with the inBlu circuit from Rome is also functioning. The reception frequency for the Vittoriese is FM 103.90 MHz.

== Infrastructure and transport ==
=== Railways ===
The city of Vittorio Veneto has two railway stations served by the Ponte nelle Alpi-Conegliano line, fully electrified since February 2021: the Vittorio Veneto station, located in the city center and the Soffratta stop, located in the Ceneda district, serving the center historical district and the southern area of the city.

==Language==

The local Venetian dialect, called &quot;Cenedese,&quot; or since the fusion of Ceneda and Serravalle, &quot;Vittoriese,&quot; pertains more to the northern variant of Venetian, such as the dialect of Belluno, but it also shares features with the central variant of Treviso due to the influence of Venice.

Characteristics of Cenedese distinguishing it from Venetian include the frequent dropping of final &quot;-o&quot;, for example, Venetian &quot;gòto&quot; (&quot;cup&quot;) is gòt in Cenedese. When this occurs leaving a final &quot;-m&quot;, the &quot;-m&quot; is further nasalized to an &quot;-n&quot;. Thus, for example, Venetian &quot;sémo&quot; (&quot;we are&quot;) is &quot;sén&quot; in Cenedese.

Another rustic feature of Cenedese is that the first person singular of indicative verbs usually ends in &quot;-e&quot; rather than in &quot;-o.&quot; Thus, Cenedese &quot;mi magne&quot; is equivalent to Venetian &quot;mi magno&quot; (&quot;I eat&quot;), &quot;mi vede&quot; (&quot;I see&quot;) is &quot;mi vedo,&quot; and &quot;mi dorme&quot; (&quot;I sleep&quot;) is &quot;mi dormo.

A northern feature of Cenedese, shared with Bellunese, is its refusal to attach &quot;ghe&quot; onto the verb &quot;avér&quot; (&quot;to have&quot;) as is done in the dialects of Venice, Padua, and Treviso. Thus, where Venetian says &quot;mi gò&quot; (&quot;I have&quot;) or &quot;ti ti gà&quot; (&quot;you (sing.) have&quot;), Cenedese says &quot;mi ò&quot; and &quot;ti te à,&quot; respectively.

One can often find the past participle of second conjugation verbs ending in &quot;-ést&quot; in Cenedese, rather than &quot;-u&quot; as in modern Venetian, for example, &quot;vegnést&quot; (&quot;came&quot;), &quot;bevést&quot; (&quot;drunken&quot;), &quot;vedést&quot; (&quot;seen&quot;), etc.

Native poet Aldo Toffoli describes a sibilant unique to Ceneda as &quot;un suono derivante dallo schiacciamento di una sibilante dentale (alveolare) sorda (s = italiano &quot;sera&quot;) su una affricata dentale sorda (ts = italiano &quot;zucchero&quot;), con un fortissimo assottigliamento del suono finale.&quot; He uses a simple &quot;z&quot; to indicate the sound, although suggests it is better represented by &quot;sts&quot;. Examples are &quot;mezo&quot; (&quot;half&quot;), &quot;pianze&quot; (&quot;weeps&quot;), &quot;ruzene&quot; (&quot;rust&quot;), &quot;zimitero&quot; (&quot;cemetery&quot;), etc. Notably, in some more northern and rural areas
of the Veneto, this sound is voiced as a theta.

Overall, &quot;Cenedese&quot; remains intelligible to speakers of other dialects of the Venetian language.

<text>J D Wetherspoon (branded variously as Wetherspoon or Wetherspoons, and colloquially known as Spoons) is a pub company operating in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The company was founded in 1979 by Tim Martin and is based in Watford. It operates the sub-brand of Lloyds No.1 bars, and 56 Wetherspoon hotels. Wetherspoon is known for converting unconventional premises, such as former cinemas and banks, into pubs – part of its wider engagement with local history. The company is publicly listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index.
==History==
===Foundation and early years===
Tim Martin opened his first pub in 1979 in Colney Hatch Lane in Muswell Hill, London. Many of the other early Wetherspoon pubs were also in the western part of Haringey. The name of the business originates from JD Hogg, a character in &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot;, and Wetherspoon, the surname of one of Martin&#x27;s teachers in New Zealand, who was known to not be able to control his classroom, similar to Martin&#x27;s first pub, thus the name.

During the 1990s, Wetherspoons began a policy of routinely closing its smaller or less profitable outlets, often replacing them with larger premises close by. In 1998, Wetherspoons introduced the oversized pint glass to promote the &quot;full pint&quot;. This initiative was withdrawn, supposedly because customers were still asking for top-ups, but arguably because other pub chains did not follow its lead.

Wetherspoons pioneered non-smoking areas in pubs before the Smoking, Health and Social Care (Scotland) Act 2005, The Smoking (Northern Ireland) Order 2006 and the Health Act 2006 in England and Wales became law in 2006.

In 2015, Wetherspoons was ordered to pay a total of £24,000 in damages for &quot;direct racial discrimination&quot; to eight individuals who were refused admittance to one of its pubs in north London (The Coronet on Holloway Road, Islington) based on what a judge described as &quot;the stereotypical assumption that Irish travellers and English gypsies cause disorder wherever they go&quot;.

On 16 April 2018, Wetherspoons deleted all of its social media profiles. Chairman Tim Martin cited the &quot;current bad publicity surrounding social media, including the trolling of MPs and others&quot; as a reason for the decision.

The chain, whose founder is a strong supporter of Brexit, replaced champagne with British and Australian sparkling wines on 9 July 2018. The firm stated that the goal was to reduce prices for its two million weekly customers.

===Development since 2020===
In mid-March 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, the government advised the public to avoid areas like pubs, clubs, restaurants, and gyms. As a result, many pub chains closed. However, Wetherspoon chairman Tim Martin rejected the government&#x27;s advice and initially did not close any pubs, saying that his instinct was that &quot;closure won&#x27;t save lives but will cost thousands of jobs&quot;. The government ordered the closure of all pubs from 21 March. 

Martin suggested that if some staff were offered jobs in supermarkets they should consider taking them and promised that he would give first preference to those who wanted to come back to Wetherspoons. A number of newspapers inaccurately reported Martin&#x27;s suggestion, adding that Wetherspoons would withhold staff pay also, but later issued corrections. The majority of staff were placed on the Government furlough scheme after its announcement.

Wetherspoons told its suppliers in March it would not pay them until its 874 pubs were allowed to reopen after the coronavirus lockdown. In October 2020, Wetherspoons reported its first loss in 36 years. For the year ending in July 2020, the company published a pre-tax loss of £34.1 million; the previous year, it reported a pre-tax profit of £102.5 million.

In March 2021, Wetherspoons reaffirmed its expansion plans including 75 projects, comprising 18 new pubs and 57 significant extensions to existing venues. Martin said that the ten-year project would create 2,000 jobs for staff, but that it would be &quot;conditional on the UK opening back up again on a long-term basis, with no further lockdowns or the constant changing of rules&quot;.

==Food and drink==
Wetherspoon&#x27;s low-price food and drink offering is aimed at the mass market. A large standardised menu is available all day in every pub, cultivating a perception of &quot;unpretentious good value&quot;. Wetherspoons claims to be &quot;the only large pub firm which opens all its pubs early in the morning&quot;, serving breakfast and coffee. The food menu has regularly incorporated additional healthier and allergen-friendly options, and displays a calorie rating next to every item.

Wetherspoons hosts ale Festivals every March/April and October during which a larger than usual range of guest ales is available as well as a cider Festival in the summer. The company claims to be the biggest investor in craft beer in the country.

Wetherspoons objected to the value-added tax (VAT) rates on food sales in pubs and restaurants in the United Kingdom, and the fact they are higher than those paid by supermarkets. VAT rates on alcoholic drinks were the same in both pubs and supermarkets. When VAT was temporarily reduced from 20% to 5% during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Wetherspoons was one of several chains to pass some of that saving to customers.

==Properties and operations==

Though some are new-build or late twentieth century properties, many Wetherspoon pubs are conversions of existing historic buildings which have become redundant, including banks, churches, post offices, theatres and a former public swimming pool, with many properties being listed buildings. Pubs are furnished thematically according to the heritage of the building or location, and have routinely won design awards. This has been seen as part of Wetherspoon&#x27;s wider engagement with local history, which includes the prominent display of posters on local history, a dedicated pub history page, and unique carpets.

Wetherspoons has opened outlets in the passenger terminals of some UK airports, including Doncaster Sheffield Airport, Edinburgh Airport, Gatwick Airport, Heathrow Airport, and Stansted Airport, as well as at several major railway stations, including London Waterloo, Leeds, Liverpool Lime Street, London Cannon Street, London Liverpool Street, and London Victoria. The main station buildings at Aberystwyth railway station were converted to a Wetherspoons pub, Yr Hen Orsaf &quot;The Old Station&quot;, and received a National Railway Heritage Award in 2003.

The first Wetherspoons pub in Northern Ireland was The Spinning Mill in Ballymena, County Antrim, which opened in 2000. The first Wetherspoons pub in the Republic of Ireland, The Three Tun Tavern, opened in Blackrock, County Dublin, in 2014. Another opened in Cork in 2015. The Three Tun Tavern closed in January 2022 after it was bought by a consortium of former and current Irish rugby players, including Rob Kearney and Jamie Heaslip.

In 2014, Wetherspoons opened a pub at the Beaconsfield motorway service area on the M40. The move was criticised by road safety charities for potentially encouraging drink-driving.

Wetherspoons also operates a chain of hotels. In 2015, there were 34 hotels in England, Wales and Scotland, and also a pub and hotel in Camden Street, Dublin, Ireland.

Every Wetherspoons in Great Britain was visited by Mags Thomson from 1994 to October 2015. She visited 972, which included 80 that had subsequently closed.

In 2018, the company announced plans to open a National JD Wetherspoon Museum in Wolverhampton in the West Midlands. The existing pub, The Moon Under Water on Lichfield Street, would be expanded to take in the whole former Co-Op Department Store, to include a hotel and gift shop. Plans were approved in April 2020.

In 2022, the company announced it was selling 32 of its sites, including that at the Beaconsfield motorway service area.

===Carpets===
Every Wetherspoons pub has one or more unique carpets, inspired by the pub&#x27;s name, location and building. They are made by Axminster Carpets and, sometimes having more than the usual six colours, have to be partially handmade on old fashioned looms, costing up to £30,000 – twice as much as stock designs. These have been the subject of a book, &quot;Spoons Carpets&quot;, by Kit Caliss and a colouring book, &quot;Colour Your Own Spoons Carpet&quot;.
==Publications==
The company produces a quarterly in-house magazine, &quot;Wetherspoon News&quot;, which contains information on the company&#x27;s activities, its employees, pubs, political views and comments on recent media mentions. The chain also offers a mobile app from which customers can order food and drink to their table to avoid using the bar, even from outside the pub.

<text>Villingen-Schwenningen (; Low Alemannic: &quot;Villinge-Schwenninge&quot;) is a city in the Schwarzwald-Baar district in southern Baden-Württemberg, in south-western Germany. It had 89,743 inhabitants as of September 2024.

==History==

In the Middle Ages, Villingen was a town under Austrian lordship. During the Protestant Reformation it remained Catholic. Villingen came to international attention when it was besieged by Marshal of France Camille d&#x27;Hostun, duc deTallard on 17 July 1704. Colonel Von Wilstorff put up a stout defence of the outdated fortifications, and after six days the siege failed.

Schwenningen remained a village until the 19th century. In 1858, the first watch factory was established, and watchmaking and precision mechanics have been important industries ever since. The town styled itself &quot;the greatest watch city in the world&quot; at one time, and the Kienzle Uhren watchmaking company was founded there in 1822 and remained until moving to Hamburg in 2002. The Museum of Clockmaking celebrates the town&#x27;s clock and watchmaking history.

During World War II, in March 1940, the Stalag V-B prisoner-of-war camp was established, in which Polish, French, British, Serbian, Soviet, Belgian, American and Italian POWs were held. Additionally, in November 1942, the Stalag 315 prisoner-of-war camp was relocated from Przemyśl in German-occupied Poland to Villingen, and was later further relocated to the German-occupied Netherlands in 1943.

As part of the Baden-Württemberg territorial reform of 1972, Villingen and Schwenningen were merged with a number of surrounding villages to form the city of Villingen-Schwenningen. Nevertheless, the two halves of the city are separated by a plateau and remain distinct. Villingen is a former part of Baden, while Schwenningen is a former part of Württemberg.

Villingen is a major center of German carnival celebrations. The traditional Narros represent the old citizens of Villingen: &quot;Alt Villingere&quot;, &quot;Morbili&quot;, &quot;Narro&quot;, &quot;Suribbel&quot;.

==Geography==
Villingen-Schwenningen lies on the eastern edge of the Black Forest about above sea level. The source of the River Neckar is in Schwenningen (Schwenninger Moos) whereas Villingen is traversed by the river Brigach which is the shorter one of the two headstreams of the Danube.

In 2004 the former Bosnian boxer Armin &quot;„Boki“&quot; Ćulum founded the motorcycle-like gang United Tribuns in Villingen-Schwenningen. The gang owned two bordellos and had a great influence on the prostitution scene in Villingen-Schwenningen. The gang called itself a group of bodybuilders, martial art athletes and bouncers. The United Tribuns grew fast and led to rivalry with the Hells Angels and Bandidos. United Tribuns had chapters in München, Augsburg, Nürnberg and Ingolstadt, and from 2014 also in the north in Hannover and later in Osnabrück. In Austria there was a chapter in Linz, Klagenfurt and Vienna. In September 2022 the Federal Minister for the Interior (BMI) prohibited the gang; and their money was confiscated.

<text>The Italian peninsula (Italian: &quot;penisola italica&quot; or &quot;penisola italiana&quot;), also known as the Italic Peninsula, Apennine Peninsula, Italian Boot, or Mainland Italy, is a peninsula, within the Italian geographical region, extending from the southern Alps in the north to the central Mediterranean Sea in the south which comprises much of the country of Italy and the enclaved microstates of San Marino and Vatican City.

==Overview==
It is nicknamed &quot;lo Stivale&quot; (&quot;the Boot&quot;), because the shape of the peninsula resembles a high-heeled boot. Three smaller peninsulas contribute to this characteristic shape, namely Calabria (&quot;the Toe&quot;), Salento (&quot;the Heel&quot;) and Gargano (&quot;the Spur&quot;). The backbone of the Italian peninsula consists of the Apennine Mountains, from which it takes one of its names. The peninsula comprises much of Italy and also includes the enclaved microstates of San Marino and Vatican City.

==Physical geography==
Geographically, the minimum extent of the Italian peninsula consists of the land south of a line extending from the Magra to the Rubicon rivers, north of the Tuscan–Emilian Apennines. It excludes the Po Valley and the southern slopes of the Alps. The Italian peninsula has the only active volcano on continental Europe, Mount Vesuvius.

==Political geography==
In general discourse, &quot;Italy&quot; and the &quot;Italian peninsula&quot; are often used as synonymous terms. However, northern Italy may be excluded from the Italian peninsula. From a political point of view, the Italian peninsula in the strict sense (therefore excluding insular Italy and northern Italy) is divided into various states listed in the following table:

<doc id="378374" wikidata="Q304575" url="?curid=378374" title="Roaring Forties">
<text>The Roaring Forties are strong westerly winds that occur in the Southern Hemisphere, generally between the latitudes of 40° and 50° south. The strong eastward air currents are caused by the combination of warm air being displaced upward from the Equator towards the South Pole, Earth&#x27;s rotation, and the scarcity of landmasses to serve as windbreaks at those latitudes.

The Roaring Forties were a major aid to ships sailing the Brouwer Route from Europe to the East Indies or Australasia during the Age of Sail, and in modern times are favoured by yachtsmen on round-the-world voyages and competitions. The boundaries of the Roaring Forties are not consistent: the wind-stream shifts north or south depending on the season. The strong and continuous winds in the Roaring Forties make this zone advantageous for wind power in places such as New Zealand and Tasmania.

Similar but even stronger conditions that occur at more southerly latitudes are called the Furious Fifties and the Shrieking or Screaming Sixties.

==Dynamics==

Hot air rises at the Equator and is pushed towards the poles by cooler air travelling towards the Equator (an atmospheric circulation feature known as the Hadley Cell). At about 30°S, the outward-travelling air sinks to lower altitudes, and continues toward the poles closer to the ground (the Ferrel Cell), then rises up again from about 60°S as the air joins the Polar vortex. This travel in the 30°–60°S zone combines with the rotation of the earth to move the air currents from west to east, creating westerly winds. 

The large tracts of open ocean south of 40°S are interrupted only by Tasmania, New Zealand, and the southern part of South America. These relatively small obstructions, which are themselves bordered by large tracts of open water along their southern shores, allow high wind speeds to develop – much higher than near 40°N, where the large continents of Eurasia and North America impede the flow of circum-planetary westerly winds. 
The latitude ranges for the &quot;Roaring Forties&quot; and similar winds are not consistent: all shift towards the South Pole in the southern summer, and towards the Equator in the southern winter. Wellington, the capital of New Zealand, is known as &quot;Windy Welly&quot; because it is one of the few cities situated in these gusty latitudes.

==Use for sailing==
During the Age of Sail, ships travelling from Europe to the East Indies or Australasia would sail down the west coast of Africa and round the Cape of Good Hope to use the Roaring Forties to speed their passage across the Indian Ocean, then on the return leg, continue eastwards across the Pacific Ocean and south of Cape Horn before sailing up the east coast of the Americas to home. 

It was first used by Dutch explorer Hendrik Brouwer in his Brouwer Route, discovered in 1611, which effectively halved the duration of the trip from Europe to Java. &quot;To run the easting down&quot; was the phrase used to describe the fast passages achieved in the Roaring Forties. 

Modern round-the-world sailors also take advantage of the Roaring Forties to speed travel times, in particular those involved in record attempts or races. An old sailor&#x27;s expression goes, &quot;below 40 degrees south, there is no law; below 50 degrees, there is no God.&quot;

==Impact of pollution==
The peak band of winds has moved approximately 2.5 degrees south in the late 20th century, from a combination of human-induced ozone depletion and greenhouse gas emissions. This has caused faster warming across much of southern Australia (especially in winter) and less rainfall in Western Australia.

==Popular culture==
The story &quot;Easting Down&quot; by &quot;Shalimar&quot; describes the events that befall a steamship unwisely venturing into the Roaring Forties to achieve a faster passage.

In 1982, French filmmaker Christian de Chalonge directed &quot;The Roaring Forties&quot;, a drama movie inspired by the death of Donald Crowhurst, a British sailor who perished in the 1969 Sunday Times Golden Globe Race.

<doc id="378392" wikidata="Q172899" url="?curid=378392" title="Photographic developer">
<text>In the processing of photographic films, plates or papers, the photographic developer (or just developer) is one or more chemicals that convert the latent image to a visible image. Developing agents achieve this conversion by reducing the silver halides, which are pale-colored, into silver metal, which is black when in the form of fine particles. The conversion occurs within the gelatine matrix. The special feature of photography is that the developer acts more quickly on those particles of silver halide that have been exposed to light. When left in developer, all the silver halides will eventually be reduced and turn black. Generally, the longer a developer is allowed to work, the darker the image.

==Chemical composition of developers==
The developer typically consists of a mixture of chemical compounds prepared as an aqueous solution. For black-and-white photography, three main components of this mixture are::115

*Developing agents. Popular developing agents are metol (monomethyl-p-aminophenol hemisulfate), phenidone (1-phenyl-3-pyrazolidinone), dimezone (4,4-dimethyl-1-phenylpyrazolidin-3-one) and hydroquinone (benzene-1,4-diol). Dimezone is thought to resist oxidation in solution better than Phenidone A, but it is not as available as Phenidone A. Dimezone is also known as Phenidone B. 
*Alkaline agent such as sodium carbonate, borax, or sodium hydroxide to create the appropriately high pH.
*Sodium sulfite to delay oxidation of the developing agents by atmospheric oxygen.

Notable standard formulas include Eastman Kodak D-76 film developer, D-72 print developer, and D-96 motion picture negative developer.

Hydroquinone is superadditive with metol, meaning that it acts to &quot;recharge&quot; the metol after it has been oxidised in the process of reducing silver in the emulsion. Sulfite in a developer not only acts to prevent aerial oxidation of the developing agents in solution, it also facilitates the regeneration of metol by hydroquinone (reducing compensation and adjacency effects) and in high enough concentrations acts as a silver halide solvent. The original lithographic developer contained formaldehyde (often added as paraformaldehyde powder) in a low sulfite/bisulfite solution.

Most developers also contain small amounts of potassium bromide to modify and restrain the action of the developer:218-219 to suppress &quot;chemical fogging&quot;. Developers for high contrast work have higher concentrations of hydroquinone and lower concentrations of metol and tend to use strong alkalis such as sodium hydroxide to push the pH up to around pH 11 to 12.

Metol is difficult to dissolve in solutions of high salt content and instructions for mixing developer formulae therefore almost always list metol first. It is important to dissolve chemicals in the order in which they are listed. Some photographers add a pinch of sodium sulfite before dissolving the metol to prevent oxidation, but large amounts of sulfite in solution will make the metol very slow to dissolve.

Because metol is relatively toxic and can cause skin sensitisation, modern commercial developers often use phenidone or dimezone S (4-hydroxymethyl-4-methyl-1-phenyl-3-pyrazolidone) instead. Dimezone, Dimezone S, is a white crystalline powder that is soluble in water and polar solvents. DD-X, HC-110, TMax developer, and PQ Universal developer are a few common film developers that use Dimezone as a developing agent. Dimezone is acutely toxic and an irritant. Hydroquinone can also be toxic to the human operator as well as environment; some modern developers replace it with ascorbic acid, or vitamin C. This, however, suffers from poor stability. Ascorbate developers may have the advantage of being compensating and sharpness-enhancing, as oxidation by-products formed during development are acidic, meaning they retard development in and adjacent to areas of high activity. This also explains why ascorbate developers have poor keeping properties, as oxidised ascorbate is both ineffective as a developing agent and lowers the pH of the solution, making the remaining developing agents less active. Recently, claims for practical methods to improve the stability of ascorbate developers have been made by several experimenters.

Other developing agents in use are p-aminophenol, glycin (N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)glycine), pyrogallol, and catechol. When used in low sulfite developer composition, the latter two compounds cause gelatin to harden and stain in the vicinity of developing grains. Generally, the optical density of the stain increases in the heavily exposed (and heavily developed) area. This is a property that is highly sought after by some photographers because it increases negative contrast in relation to density, meaning that highlight detail can be captured without &quot;blocking&quot; (reaching high enough density that detail and tonality are severely compromised). Hydroquinone shares this property. However, the staining effect only appears in solutions with very little sulfite, and most hydroquinone developers contain substantial quantities of sulfite.

In the early days of photography, a wide range of developing agents were used, including chlorohydroquinone, ferrous oxalate,:131 hydroxylamine, ferrous lactate, ferrous citrate, Eikonogen, atchecin, antipyrin, acetanilid and Amidol (which unusually required mildly acidic conditions).

Developers also contain a water softening agent to prevent calcium scum formation (e.g., EDTA salts, sodium tripolyphosphate, NTA salts, etc.).

The original lithographic developer was based upon a low sulfite/bisulfite developer with formaldehyde (added as the powder paraformaldehyde). The very low sulfite, high hydroquinone and high alkalinity encouraged &quot;infectious development&quot; (exposed developing silver halide crystals collided with unexposed silver halide crystals, causing them to also reduce) which enhanced the edge effect in line images. These high energy developers had a short tray life, but when used within their tray life provided consistent usable results.

Modern lithographic developers contain hydrazine compounds, tetrazolium compounds and other amine contrast boosters to increase contrast without relying on the classic hydroquinone-only lithographic developer formulation. The modern formulae are very similar to rapid access developers (except for those additives) and therefore they enjoy long tray life. However, classic lithographic developers using hydroquinone alone suffers very poor tray life and inconsistent results.

==Development==

The developer selectively reduces silver halide crystals in the emulsion to metallic silver, but only those having latent image centres created by action of light. The light sensitive layer or emulsion consists of silver halide crystals in a gelatin base. Two photons of light must be absorbed by one silver halide crystal to form a stable two atom silver metal crystal. The developer used generally will only reduce silver halide crystals that have an existing silver crystal. Faster exposure or lower light level films usually have larger grains because those images capture less light. Fine grain films, like Kodachrome, require more light to increase the chance that the halide crystal will absorb at least two quanta of light as they have a smaller cross sectional size. Therefore, silver halide crystal size is proportional to film speed. The metallic silver image has dark (black) appearance. Once the desired level of reduction is achieved the development process is halted by washing in a dilute acid and then the undeveloped silver halide is removed by dissolving it in a thiosulfate solution, a process called &quot;fixing&quot;. Most commercial film developers use a dual solution or &quot;push&quot; (pushes the films speed) development (compensating developer, like Diafine) procedure where the reducing agent e.g. hydroquinone solution soaks into and swells the gelatin then the film is introduced into the alkaline solution which activates (lowers reduction potential) of the developer. The areas with the most light exposure use up the tiny amount of developer in the gelatin and stop making silver crystal before the film at that point is totally opaque. The areas that received the least light continue to develop because they haven&#x27;t used up their developer. There is less contrast, but time is not critical and films from several customers and different exposures will develop satisfactorily.

The time over which development takes place, and the type of developer, affect the relationship between the density of silver in the developed image and the quantity of light. This study is called sensitometry and was pioneered by F Hurter &amp; V C Driffield in the late 19th century.

==Colour development==
In colour and chromogenic black-and-white photography, a similar development process is used except that the reduction of silver simultaneously oxidizes the paraphenylene colour developing agent which then takes part in the production of dye-stuffs in the emulsion by reacting with the appropriate couplers. There are three distinct processes used here. The C-41 process is used for almost all colour negative films and in this process dye couplers in the emulsion react with the oxidized colour developing agent in the developer solution to generate the visible dyes. An almost identical process is then used to produce colour prints from films. The developing agents used are derivates of paraphenylene diamine.

In colour negative films, there are 3 types of dye couplers. There are the normal cyan, magenta and yellow dye forming couplers, but also there is a magenta coloured cyan masking coupler and a yellow coloured magenta masking coupler. These form respectively normal cyan dye, and magenta dye, but form an orange positive mask to correct colour. In addition, there is a third type of coupler called a DIR (Developer Inhibitor Release) coupler. This coupler releases a powerful inhibitor during dye formation, which affects edge effects and causes effects between layers to enhance overall image quality.

==Reversal film development==
In Ektachrome-type (E-6 process) transparencies, the film is first processed in an unusual developer containing phenidone and Hydroquinone-monosulfonate. This black and white developer is used for 6:00 at 100.4°F (38°C), with more time yielding &quot;push&quot; processing to increase the apparent film speed by reducing the Dmax, or maximum density. The first developer is the most critical step in Process E-6. The solution is essentially a black-and-white film developer, because it forms only a negative silver image in each layer of the film; no dye images are yet formed. Then, the film goes directly into the first wash for 2:00 at 100 °F, which acts as a controlled stop bath. Next, the film goes into the reversal bath. This step prepares the film for the colour developer step. In this reversal bath, a chemical reversal agent is absorbed into the emulsion, with no chemical reaction taking place until the film enters the colour developer. The reversal process can also be carried out using 800 footcandle-seconds of light, which is used by process engineers to troubleshoot reversal bath chemistry problems.

Next, the film is developed to completion in the colour developer bath, which contains CD-3 as the colour developing agent. When film enters the colour developer, the reversal agent absorbed by the emulsion in the reversal bath chemically fogs (or &quot;exposes&quot;) the unexposed silver halide (if it has not already been fogged by light in the previous step). The colour developer acts on the chemically exposed silver halide to form a positive silver image. However, the metallic silver image formed in the first developer, which is a negative image, is not a part of the reaction that takes place in this step. What is being reacted in this stage is the &quot;leftover&quot; of the negative image, that is, a positive image.
As the colour development progresses, metallic silver image is formed, but more importantly, the colour developing agent is oxidised. Oxidised colour developer molecules react with the couplers to form colour dyes &quot;in situ.&quot; Thus colour dye is formed at the site of development in each of the three layers of the film. Each layer of the film contains different couplers, which react with the same oxidised developer molecules but form different colour dyes. Next, the film goes into the pre-bleach (formerly conditioner) bath, which has a precursor of formaldehyde (as a dye preservative) and EDTA to &quot;kick off&quot; the bleach. Next, the film goes into a bleach solution. The bleach converts metallic silver into silver bromide, which is converted to soluble silver compounds in the fixer. The C-41 color negative process introduced in 1972 uses ferric EDTA. Reversal processes have used ferric EDTA at least since the introduction of the E-6 process in 1976. For Kodachrome ferric EDTA is used at least in the current K-14 process. During bleaching, ferric EDTA is changed to ferrous EDTA before fixing, and final wash. 
Previously potassium ferricyanide was often used as bleach. The most common processing chemistry for such films is E6, derived from a long line of developers produced for the Ektachrome range of films.

Ektachrome papers are also available.

Standard black and white stock can also be reversal processed to give black and white slides. After &#x27;first development,&#x27; the initial silver image is then removed (e.g. using a potassium bichromate/sulfuric acid bleach, which requires a subsequent &quot;clearing bath&quot; to remove the chromate stain from the film). The unfixed film is then fogged (physically or chemically) and &#x27;second-developed&#x27;. However, the process works best with slow films such as Ilford Pan-F processed to give a high gamma. Kodak&#x27;s chemistry kit for reversing Panatomic-X (&quot;Direct Positive Film Developing Outfit&quot;) used sodium bisulfate in place of sulfuric acid in the bleach, and used a fogging developer that was inherently unstable, and had to be mixed and used within a two-hour period. (If two rolls, the maximum capacity of a single pint of redeveloper, were to be processed in succession, the redeveloper had to be mixed while the first roll was in the first developer.)

==Proprietary methods==
The K-14 process for Kodachrome films involved adding all the dyes to the emulsion during development. Special equipment was needed to process Kodachrome. Since 2010, there has been no commercial entity that processes Kodachrome anywhere in the world.

In colour print development the Ilfochrome, or Cibachrome, process uses a print material with the dye-stuffs present and which are bleached out in appropriate places during developing. The chemistry involved here is wholly different from C41 chemistry; (it uses azo-dyes which are much more resistant to fading in sunlight).

<text>Hendrik Brouwer (; 1581 – 7 August 1643) was a Dutch explorer and governor of the Dutch East Indies.

== East Indies ==
Brouwer is thought to first have sailed to the Dutch East Indies for the Dutch East India Company in 1606. In 1610, he left again to the Indies, now as commander of three ships. On this trip he devised the Brouwer Route, a route from South Africa to Java that reduced voyage duration from a year to about six months by taking advantage of the strong westerly winds in the Roaring Forties – latitudes between 40° and 50° south.

Up to that point, the Dutch had followed a route copied from the Portuguese via the coast of Africa, Mauritius and Ceylon. By 1617, the VOC required all their ships to take the Brouwer route.

After his arrival in 1611 in the East Indies, he was sent to Japan to replace Jacques Specx temporarily as opperhoofd at Dejima from 28 August 1612 to 6 August 1614. During that time he made a visit to the Japanese court at Edo. In 1613, he made a trip to Siam that laid the foundation for the Dutch trade with Siam.

Early in 1632, he was part of a delegation sent to London to solve trade disagreements between the Honourable East India Company and Dutch East India companies. Afterwards he left for the Indies, and on 18 April of that same year he was appointed Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, again following Jacques Specx, a position which he held until 1 January 1636. Anthony van Diemen was his assistant during this entire period, and many of the Dutch explorations into the Pacific carried out under Van Diemen&#x27;s command were suggested in writing by Brouwer before he left.

== Chile ==

In 1642, the VOC joined the Dutch West India Company in organizing an expedition to Chile to establish a base for trading gold at the abandoned ruins of Valdivia. The fleet sailed from Dutch Brazil where John Maurice of Nassau provided them with supplies. While rounding Cape Horn, the expedition established that Isla de los Estados was not part of the unknown southern land.

After making landfall on Chiloé Island, Brouwer made a pact with native Huilliches to aid in establishing a resettlement at Valdivia. However, on 7 August 1643, at the age of 62, Hendrik died in Puerto Inglés before his arrival at Valdivia, and was succeeded by his vice-admiral, Elias Herckmans, who landed at the ruins on 24 August. The embalmed body of Brouwer was buried in Valdivia, by then renamed Brouwershaven, on September 16. Brouwershaven remained occupied by Herckmans and his men until 28 October.

Having been told that the Dutch had plans to return to the location, the Spanish viceroy in Peru sent 1,000 men in 20 ships in 1644, to resettle Valdivia and fortify it. The viceroy also sent 2,000 men by land, who never made it. The Spanish soldiers in the new garrison disinterred and burned Brouwer&#x27;s body.

<text>Sir Peter Richard Caruana, (born 15 October 1956) is a Gibraltarian former politician who served as Chief Minister of Gibraltar from 1996 to 2011 and Leader of the Gibraltar Social Democrats (GSD) from 1991 to 2013. He is the longest serving Chief Minister to date.

Caruana is a barrister by profession. He was appointed a Queen&#x27;s Counsel for Gibraltar in 1998 (which became King&#x27;s Counsel upon the death of Queen Elizabeth II), and elected an Overseas Master of the Bench of Inner Temple in 2011.

==Early and personal life==

Caruana was born in Gibraltar and is of Maltese and Italian descent. He was educated at the Christian Brothers School in Gibraltar, and then Grace Dieu Manor School and the independent Ratcliffe College (both in Leicestershire, England), and finally Queen Mary College, University of London and the Council of Legal Education. Before serving as Chief Minister, he was a partner in the law firm Triay &amp; Triay. He is married to Cristina, daughter of Joseph Triay, a local barrister. He has 7 children: Michael, Georgina, Nicola, Philippa, Patrick, Timothy, and James (who was voted to become his father&#x27;s party&#x27;s executive member in 2018). His leisure interests are golf, and political and current affairs.

==Politics==

Prior to being elected to Government his political career progressed steadily. In 1990, Caruana became a member of the Gibraltar Social Democrats. One year later, he became leader of the party and in May 1991 gained a seat in the House of Assembly by winning Gibraltar&#x27;s first contested by-election. In January 1992, Caruana led his party to the position of official opposition by winning seven seats in the House of Assembly. Finally, in May 1996, he led the party to victory and became Chief Minister of Gibraltar.

The GSD which he led from 1991 to 2012, is robustly against any transfer of sovereignty to Spain, but remains in favour of safe dialogue. As Chief Minister, Caruana consistently refused to attend bi-lateral talks between the United Kingdom and Spain as part of the UK delegation, on the basis that the interests of the Gibraltarians were not protected, and he did not want to give any measure of legitimacy to talks over which Gibraltar had no control.

In 2002, he called a referendum on the subject of the proposed joint sovereignty deal, which led to it being abandoned.

In December 2004, the principle of tripartite talks, with the Government of Gibraltar as an equal party with the UK and Spain, was finally recognised, largely as a result of his involvement. This resulted in the Cordoba Agreement which improved communications between Gibraltar and Spain with direct flights from Madrid which subsequently collapsed due to a lack of demand, and in Spain finally recognising Gibraltar&#x27;s international dialling code, thereby ending a long-standing dispute.

In November 2007, he was returned to office for a fourth term. Under his leadership, the Gibraltar Social Democrats were narrowly beaten in the general election of December 2011 by their rival party, the coalition between the Gibraltar Socialist Labour Party and the Liberal Party of Gibraltar, who won said election by 1.2%. On 9 January 2013, Caruana made it public that he would stand down from the party leadership and as Leader of the Opposition at the end of the month.

==Awards==

Caruana was appointed a Queen&#x27;s Counsel for Gibraltar in 1998. In 2003, he was appointed Knight Grand Cross of Merit of the Sacred Military Constantinian Order of Saint George by Prince Carlo, Duke of Castro. Caruana was also appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in the 2013 Birthday Honours for services to Gibraltar.

<doc id="378400" wikidata="Q502126" url="?curid=378400" title="Vought F-8 Crusader">
<text>The Vought F-8 Crusader (originally F8U) is a single-engine, supersonic, carrier-based air superiority jet aircraft designed and produced by the American aircraft manufacturer Vought. It was the last American fighter that had guns as the primary weapon, earning it the title &quot;The Last of the Gunfighters&quot;.

Development of the F-8 commenced after release of the requirement for a new fighter by the United States Navy in September 1952. Vought&#x27;s design team, led by John Russell Clark, produced the &quot;V-383&quot;, a relatively unorthodox fighter that possessed an innovative high-mounted variable-incidence wing, an area-ruled fuselage, all-moving stabilators, dog-tooth notching at the wing folds for improved yaw stability, and liberal use of titanium throughout the airframe. During June 1953, Vought received an initial order to produce three &quot;XF8U-1&quot; prototypes of its design. On 25 March 1955, the first prototype performed its maiden flight. Flight testing proved the aircraft to be relatively problem-free. On 21 August 1956, U.S. Navy pilot R.W. Windsor attained a top speed of 1,015 mph; in doing so, the F-8 became the first jet fighter in American service to reach 1,000 mph.

During March 1957, the F-8 was introduced into regular operations with the US Navy. In addition to the Navy, the type was also operated by the United States Marine Corps (replacing the Vought F7U Cutlass), the French Navy, and the Philippine Air Force. Early on, the type experienced an above-average mishap rate, being somewhat difficult to pilot. American F-8s saw active combat during the Vietnam War, engaging in multiple dogfights with MiG-17s of the Vietnam People&#x27;s Air Force as well as performing ground attack missions in the theatre. The RF-8 Crusader was a photo-reconnaissance model. It played a crucial role in the Cuban Missile Crisis, providing essential low-level photographs of Soviet medium range ballistic missiles (MRBMs) in Cuba that were impossible to acquire by other means at that time. Several modified F-8s were used by NASA for experimental flights, including the testing of digital fly-by-wire technology and supercritical wing design. The RF-8 operated in U.S. service longer than any of the fighter versions; the United States Navy Reserve withdrew its remaining aircraft during 1987.

==Development==
===Background===
During September 1952, the United States Navy released a requirement calling for a new fighter. Specifics of this requirement included a maximum speed of Mach 1.2 at with a climb rate of , and a landing speed of no more than . Experience gained during the Korean War had demonstrated that .50 caliber (12.7 mm) machine guns were no longer sufficient armament and, as a result, the new fighter was to be armed with 20 mm (0.79 in) cannon. The 20x110mm round had become common in the U.S. Navy prior to the Korean conflict, used on the McDonnell F2H Banshee, F9F, F3D Skyknight, F7U Cutlass, and the F4D, among others.

In response to the requirement, the American aircraft manufacturer Vought opted to produce a new design, internally designated as the &quot;V-383&quot;. Vought&#x27;s design team was led by John Russell Clark. It was relatively unorthodox for a fighter, possessing a high-mounted wing which necessitated the use of a short and lightweight landing gear in the fuselage. A major contributing factor that facilitated the use of such compact main gear, however, was the variable-incidence wing (not to be confused with a variable-sweep wing, another form of variable geometry wing designed for similar purposes) which reduced the amount of pitch up required while in landing configuration at low speeds, an extremely nose high attitude being a common characteristic of the highly swept and low aspect ratio wings used on many fighters of the era. This innovative wing pivoted upwards by 7° in takeoff and landing configuration, and by doing so, increased the angle of attack of the wing without requiring the entire aircraft to pitch up, which allowed for greater forward visibility and a suitably slow landing speed. The variable-incidence wing helped the F-8&#x27;s development team win the Collier Trophy in 1956.

Considerable competition for the requirement also emerged. This included the Grumman F-11 Tiger, the upgraded twin-engine McDonnell F3H Demon (the F3H-H, which would eventually become the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II), and the North American F-100 Super Sabre hastily adapted to carrier use and dubbed the &quot;Super Fury&quot;. In addition to the fighter-orientated V-383 proposal, Vought also presented a tactical reconnaissance version of the aircraft, internally designated as the &quot;V-392&quot;.

===Into flight===
During May 1953, Vought&#x27;s submission was declared to be the winner; one month later, the company received an initial order for three &quot;XF8U-1&quot; prototypes (after adoption of the unified designation system in September 1962, the F8U became the F-8). On 25 March 1955, the first prototype performed its maiden flight with John Konrad at the controls; confidence was such that it was decided to exceed the speed of sound during its maiden flight. The development was relatively trouble-free, to the extent that the second prototype and the first production F8U-1 made their first flights together on the same day, 30 September 1955. On 4 April 1956, the F8U-1 performed its first catapult launch from .

Beginning in late 1956, prototype XF8U-1s were evaluated by VX-3, during which few problems were noted. Weapons development was conducted at Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake and a China Lake F8U-1 set a U.S. National speed record in August 1956. Commander &quot;Duke&quot; Windsor set a new Level Flight Speed Record of on 21 August 1956 beating the previous record of set by a USAF F-100. (It did not break the world speed record of , set by the British Fairey Delta 2, on 10 March 1956.)

An early F8U-1 was modified as a photo-reconnaissance aircraft, becoming the first F8U-1P. Subsequently, the RF-8A was equipped with cameras rather than guns and missiles. On 16 July 1957, Major John H. Glenn Jr, USMC, completed the first supersonic transcontinental flight in a F8U-1P, flying from NAS Los Alamitos, California, to Floyd Bennett Field, New York, in three hours, 23 minutes, and 8.3 seconds.

In parallel with the F8U-1s and -2s, the Crusader design team was also working on a larger aircraft with even greater performance, internally designated as the &quot;V-401&quot; and later officially designated as the Vought XF8U-3 Crusader III. It was externally similar to the Crusader and shared several design elements, as the variable incidence wing, but differed by being considerably larger while also sharing relatively few components and being capable of greater speeds amongst other abilities.

==Design==
The Vought F-8 Crusader was a single-engine, supersonic, carrier-based air superiority fighter. It was typically described as an all-weather fighter, yet initial production aircraft were only fitted with a ranging radar for its guns and thus was entirely reliant on external platforms to be guided towards enemies. From the F-8B onwards, air-intercept radar was fitted to the aircraft; increasingly capable and reliable radar sets were present on later models. Pilot training of the era did not focus much upon use of the radar, thus making it less effective operationally than it otherwise could have been. The addition of more advanced avionics on later models, particularly the F-8J, was often criticized as being responsible for considerable weight increases as well as having questionable effectiveness. Pilots often claimed the later F-8 models did not turn as well as early aircraft and had greater difficulty in aborting a landing attempt; furthermore, that the radar did not work well in tropical environments.

A key feature of the F-8 was its variable-incidence wing, which allowed for a greater angle of attack to be achieved and increased lift without compromising forward visibility by pivoting 7° out of the fuselage during takeoff and landing runs. Simultaneously, the aircraft&#x27;s lift was augmented by leading-edge flaps drooping by 25° and inboard flaps extending to 30°. The F-8 also took advantage of contemporary aerodynamic innovations such as an area-ruled fuselage, all-moving stabilators, dog-tooth notching at the wing folds for improved yaw stability, and liberal use of titanium throughout the airframe. The aircraft was powered by a single Pratt &amp; Whitney J57 turbojet engine, which was equipped with an afterburner. On the initial &quot;F8U-1&quot; production aircraft, this afterburner increased the engine&#x27;s thrust from 10,200 lb to 16,000 lb, but, unlike later engines, lacked any intermediate thrust settings.

The armament of the F-8, which had been specified by the US Navy, consisted primarily of four 20 mm (.79 in) autocannons; the aircraft would become the final U.S. fighter to be designed with guns as its primary weapon. They were supplemented with a retractable tray with 32 unguided Mk 4/Mk 40 Folding-Fin Aerial Rocket (Mighty Mouse FFARs), and cheek pylons for four guided AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. In practice, Sidewinder missiles were the F-8&#x27;s primary weapon; the 20mm guns were considered to be &quot;generally unreliable&quot;; moreover, the F-8 achieved nearly all of its kills using Sidewinders. It has been suggested that, had the US Navy mandated more rigorous and realistic weapons testing, the reliability of the guns could have been improved considerably.

==Operational history==
===US Navy and US Marine Corps===
====Introduction====
VX-3 was one of the first units to receive the F8U-1 in December 1956, and was the first to operate the type in April 1957, from . VX-3 was the first unit to qualify for carrier operations but several aircraft were lost in accidents, several of them fatal to their pilots.

The first fleet squadron to fly the Crusader was VF-32 at NAS Cecil Field, Florida, in 1957, which deployed to the Mediterranean late that year on . VF-32 renamed the squadron the &quot;Swordsmen&quot; in keeping with the Crusader theme. The Pacific Fleet received the first Crusaders at NAS Moffett Field in northern California and the VF-154 &quot;Grandslammers&quot; (named in honor of the new 1,000-mph jets and subsequently renamed the &quot;Black Knights&quot;) began their F-8 operations. Later in 1957, in San Diego VMF-122 accepted the first Marine Corps Crusaders. The first combat action of F-8s was during the 1958 Lebanon crisis. F-8s of VF-32 were assigned to the USS &quot;Saratoga&quot; in support of the landing of US Marines in Lebanon.

In 1962, the Defense Department standardized military aircraft designations generally along Air Force lines. Consequently, the F8U became the F-8, with the original F8U-1 redesignated F-8A.

The Crusader became a &quot;day fighter&quot; operating off the aircraft carriers. At the time, U.S. Navy carrier air wings had gone through a series of day and night fighter aircraft due to rapid advances in engines and avionics. Some squadrons operated aircraft for very short periods before being equipped with a newer higher performance aircraft. The Crusader was the first post-Korean War aircraft to have a relatively long tenure with the fleet.

====Cuban Missile Crisis====
The unarmed RF-8A proved good at getting low-altitude detailed photographs, leading to carrier deployments as detachments from the Navy&#x27;s VFP-62 and VFP-63 squadrons and the Marines&#x27; VMCJ-2. Beginning on 23 October 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis, RF-8As flew extremely hazardous low-level photo reconnaissance missions over Cuba, the F-8&#x27;s first true operational flights. Two-ship flights of RF-8As left Key West twice each day, to fly over Cuba at low level, then return to Jacksonville, where the film was offloaded and developed, to be rushed north to the Pentagon.

These flights confirmed that the Soviet Union was setting up medium range ballistic missiles (MRBMs) in Cuba. The RF-8As also monitored the withdrawal of the Soviet missiles. After each overflight, the aircraft was given a stencil of a dead chicken. The overflights went on for about six weeks and returned a total of 160,000 images. The pilots who flew the missions received Distinguished Flying Crosses, while VFP-62 and VMCJ-2 received the prestigious U.S. Navy Unit Commendation.

====Mishap rate====
The Crusader was not an easy aircraft to fly, and was often unforgiving in carrier landings, where it suffered from poor recovery from high sink rates, and the poorly designed, castering nose undercarriage made it hard to steer on the deck. Safe landings required the carriers to steam at full speed to offset the relatively high landing speed of the Crusader. The stacks of the oil-burning carriers on which the Crusader served belched thick black smoke, sometimes obscuring the flight deck, forcing the Crusader&#x27;s pilot to rely on the landing signal officer&#x27;s radioed instructions. Early on, pilots were encouraged to only keep a minimum level of fuel remaining onboard prior to landing; in the long term, the adoption of the more powerful J57-P420 engine improved the situation. It earned a reputation as an &quot;ensign eliminator&quot; during its early service introduction. The nozzle and air intake were so low when the aircraft was on the ground or the flight deck that the crews called the aircraft &quot;the Gator&quot;. Not surprisingly, the Crusader mishap rate was relatively high compared to its contemporaries, the Douglas A-4 Skyhawk and the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II. However, the aircraft did possess a desirable capability, as proved when several Crusader pilots took off with the wings folded and were able to land the aircraft. One of these episodes took place on 23 August 1960; a Crusader with the wings folded took off from Napoli Capodichino in full afterburner, climbed to and then returned to land successfully. The pilot reported that the control forces were higher than normal. The Crusader was capable of flying in this configuration, though the pilot would be required to reduce aircraft weight by jettisoning stores and dumping fuel before landing. 1,261 Crusaders were built. By the time it was withdrawn from the fleet, 1,106 had been involved in mishaps.

====Vietnam War====

When conflict erupted in the skies over North Vietnam, it was US Navy Crusaders from that first engaged with Vietnam People&#x27;s Air Force (the North Vietnamese Air Force) MiG-17s, on 3 April 1965. The MiGs claimed the downing of an F-8 and Lt Pham Ngoc Lan&#x27;s gun camera revealed that his cannons had set an F-8 ablaze, but Lieutenant Commander Spence Thomas had managed to land his damaged F-8 at Da Nang Air Base, the remaining F-8s returning safely to their carrier. The F-8 repeatedly encountered the relatively nimble North Vietnamese MiGs over the following years, yet the F-8 never made first contact via radar detection in any of these engagements. Instead, F-8 pilots were reliant on ground control intercept controllers to find enemies and be guided towards a favorable firing position. A typical day mission would be performed using a pair of F-8s, one pilot concentrated on radar and navigation functions while the other searched the skies with their eyes; ground controllers would alert and direct them towards any MiGs spotted, which they&#x27;d approach at speed from behind, not relying on their own radar to detect the hostile aircraft. The presence of US surface to air missiles (SAMs) usually compelled MiGs to fly at lower altitudes, where the F-8 was more maneuverable and thus would have an advantage.

The US Navy had evolved its &quot;night fighter&quot; role in the air wing to an all-weather interceptor, the F-4 Phantom II, equipped to engage incoming bombers at long range with missiles such as AIM-7 Sparrow as their sole air-to-air weapons, and maneuverability was not emphasized in their design. Some experts believed that the era of the dogfight was over as air-to-air missiles would knock down adversaries well before they could get close enough to engage in dogfighting. As aerial combat ensued over North Vietnam from 1965 to 1968, it became apparent that the dogfight was not over. In one pitched air-battle between USN F-8s and VPAF MiG-21s on 1 August 1968, ace fighter pilot Nguyen Hong Nhi fired a pair of R-3S AAMs at a pair of F-8s, the second R-3S making a successful hit, claiming one F-8 shot-down. Following a brief dogfight with the other F-8, another pair of F-8s entered into the fray and fired two Sidewinder AAMs at Nguyen Hong Nhi, who was hit and safely ejected from his stricken MiG-21; the downing of ace fighter pilot Nguyen is credited to F-8H pilot Lt. McCoy of VF-51, USS &quot;Bon Homme Richard&quot;.

As the conflict progressed, North Vietnam received MiG-21s, which proved to be a more capable opponent for the F-8, yet it still proved to be effective with good teamwork and exploiting the MiG-21&#x27;s weaknesses. Following the end of Operation Rolling Thunder in November 1968, American aircraft stopped flying in airspace in which MiGs encounters were expected and thus there were less opportunities for aerial engagements to occur. Accordingly, the Crusader became increasing used as a &quot;bomb truck&quot;, with both ship-based U.S. Navy units and land-based US Marine Corps squadrons attacking communist forces in both North and South Vietnam. US Marine Crusaders flew only in the south, where they largely performed close air support and interdiction missions. During December 1972&#x27;s Operation Linebacker II, numerous Navy F-8s were assigned to fly aerial superiority missions, yet these were largely unopposed; actual combat with MiGs had become exceeding rare by this point of the conflict.

Navy Crusaders flew only from the small &quot;Essex&quot;-class carriers.

Despite the &quot;last gunfighter&quot; moniker, the F-8s achieved only four victories with their cannon; the remainder were accomplished with Sidewinder missiles, partly due to the propensity of the 20 mm (.79 in) Colt Mk 12 cannons&#x27; feeding mechanism to jam under G-loading during high-speed dogfighting maneuvers. Between June and July 1966, during 12 engagements over North Vietnam, Crusaders claimed four MiG-17s for two losses. Crusader pilots would claim the best kill ratio of any American type in the Vietnam War, 19:3. Of the 19 aircraft claimed during aerial combat, 16 were MiG-17s and three were MiG-21s. While VPAF pilots claimed 11 F-8s shot down by MiGs, official US sources indicate that only three F-8s were lost in air combat, all of them during 1966, to cannon fire from opponents in MiG-17s. A total of 170 F-8s would be lost to all causes – mostly ground fire and accidents – during the war.

====Withdrawal from frontline operations====
LTV built and delivered the 1,219th (and last) US Navy Crusader to VF-124 at NAS Miramar on 3 September 1964. The last active duty US Navy Crusader fighter variants were retired from VF-191 and VF-194 aboard in 1976 after almost two decades of service, setting a first for a Navy fighter.

The photo reconnaissance variant continued to serve in the active duty Navy for yet another 11 years, with VFP-63 flying RF-8Gs up to 1982, and with the Naval Reserve flying their RF-8Gs in two squadrons (VFP-206 and VFP-306) at Naval Air Facility Washington / Andrews AFB until the disestablishment of VFP-306 in 1984 and VFP-206 on 29 March 1987 when the last operational Crusader was turned over to the National Air and Space Museum.

The Crusader is the only aircraft to have used the AIM-9C, a radar-guided variant of the Sidewinder air-to-air missile. During 1969, the US Navy opted to shelve the AIM-9C due to its restrictive launch envelope, as well as its high maintenance demands and associated logistical difficulties. When the Crusader retired, these missiles were converted to the AGM-122 Sidearm anti-radiation missiles used by United States attack helicopters against enemy radars.

===NASA===
Several modified F-8s were used by NASA in the early 1970s, proving the viability of both digital fly-by-wire technology (using data-processing equipment adapted from the Apollo Guidance Computer), as well as supercritical wing design.

===French Navy===

During the early 1960s, the French Navy&#x27;s air arm, the &quot;Aéronavale&quot;, required a carrier-based fighter to serve aboard the new carriers and , the F-4 Phantom, then entering service with the United States Navy, proved to be too large for the small French ships. Following carrier trials aboard &quot;Clemenceau&quot; on 16 March 1962, by two VF-32 F-8s from the American carrier USS &quot;Saratoga&quot;, the Crusader was chosen and 42 F-8s were ordered; these would be the last Crusaders produced.

The French Crusaders were based on the F-8E, but were modified in order to allow operations from the compact French carriers; accordingly, the maximum angle of incidence of the aircraft&#x27;s wing increased from five to seven degrees and blown flaps fitted. The weapon system was modified to carry two French Matra R.530 radar or infra-red missiles as an alternative to Sidewinders, although the ability to carry the American missile was retained. Deliveries of these aircraft, dubbed the F-8E(FN), started in October 1964 and continued until February 1965, with the &quot;Aéronavale&quot;″s first squadron, &quot;Flotille&quot; 12F reactivated on 1 October 1964. To replace the old Corsairs, &quot;Flotille&quot; 14.F received its Crusaders on 1 March 1965.

During October 1974, (on &quot;Clemenceau&quot;) and June 1977 (on &quot;Foch&quot;), Crusaders from 14.F squadron participated in the Saphir missions over Djibouti. On 7 May 1977, two Crusaders went separately on patrol against supposedly French Air Force (4/11 Jura squadron) F-100 Super Sabres stationed at Djibouti. The leader intercepted two fighters and engaged a dogfight (supposed to be a training exercise) but quickly called his wingman for help as he had actually engaged two Yemeni MiG-21s. The two French fighters switched their master armament to &quot;on&quot; but, ultimately, everyone returned to their bases. This was the only combat interception to be performed by French Crusaders.

The &quot;Aéronavale&quot; Crusaders flew combat missions over Lebanon in 1983 escorting Dassault-Breguet Super Étendard strike aircraft. In October 1984, France sent &quot;Foch&quot; with 12.F squadron to conduct Operation Mirmillon off the coast of Libya, intended to deter Libyan ruler Colonel Gaddafi from escalating. Regional tensions around the Persian Gulf, largely related to the Iran-Iraq conflict, triggered the deployment of a task force headed by &quot;Clemenceau&quot;, which included 12.F squadron in its air way. During 1993, combat missions commenced over the skies of the former Yugoslavia; Crusaders were launched from both French carriers, which were stationed in the Adriatic Sea. These missions ceased in June 1999 with Operation Trident over Kosovo.

The French Crusaders were subject to a series of modifications throughout their life, being fitted with new F-8J-type wings in 1969 and having modified afterburners fitted in 1979. Armament was enhanced by the addition of R550 Magic infra-red guided missiles in 1973, with the improved, all-aspect Magic 2 fitted from 1988. The obsolete R.530 was withdrawn from use in 1989, leaving the Crusaders without a radar-guided missile. In 1989, when it was realized that the Crusader would not be replaced for several years due to delays in the development of the Rafale, it was decided to refurbish the Crusaders to extend their operating life. Each aircraft was rewired and had its hydraulic system refurbished, while the airframe was strengthened to extend fatigue life. Avionics were improved, with a modified navigation suite and a new radar-warning receiver. The 17 refurbished aircraft were redesignated as F-8P (P used for &quot;Prolongé&quot; -extended- and not to be confused with the Philippine F-8P). Although the French Navy participated in combat operations in 1991 during Operation Desert Storm and over Kosovo in 1999, the Crusaders stayed behind and were eventually replaced by the Dassault Rafale M in 2000 as the last of the type in military service.

===Philippine Air Force===

During late 1977, the Philippine government purchased 35 secondhand U.S. Navy F-8Hs that had been stored at Davis-Monthan AFB in Arizona. 25 of them were refurbished by Vought while the remaining ten were used for spare parts. As part of the deal, the U.S. would train Philippine pilots using the TF-8A. The Crusaders were manned by the 7th Tactical Fighter Squadron at Basa Air Base and were mostly used for intercepting Soviet bombers and escorting presidential flights. However, due to a lack of spares and the rapid deterioration of the aircraft, the remaining F-8s were grounded in 1988 and left on an open grass field at Basa Air Base. They were finally withdrawn from service three years later after they were badly damaged by the Mount Pinatubo eruption, and have since been offered for sale as scrap. Some of the inoperational airframes were refurbished for use as props in the 2000 movie &quot;Thirteen Days&quot;, a dramatization of the Cuban Missile Crisis, to depict the real-life RF-8As involved in the low-level photo reconnaissance missions that obtained photos of Soviet ballistic missiles in Cuba.

<doc id="378405" wikidata="Q3054793" url="?curid=378405" title="Secondary education in the United States">
<text>Secondary education is the last six or seven years of statutory formal education in the United States. It culminates with twelfth grade (age 17–18). Whether it begins with sixth grade (age 11–12) or seventh grade (age 12–13) varies by state and sometimes by school district.

Secondary education in the United States occurs in two phases. The first. as classified by the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED), is the lower secondary phase, either called a middle school or junior high school. A middle school is for students sixth grade, seventh grade and eighth grade and a junior high school is only for students in seventh and eighth grade.

The second is the ISCED upper secondary phase, a high school or senior high school for students ninth grade through twelfth grade. There is some debate over the optimum age of transfer, and variation in some states; also, middle school often includes grades that are almost always considered primary school.

==History==
===Academies===
Today &quot;Academy&quot; is a general term referring to post-secondary education, especially the most elite or liberal arts part of it. However, in the 18th and 19th century, an &quot;academy&quot; was what later became known as a high school. In most towns there were no public schools above the primary level. The typical college at first included a preparatory unit, which it dropped by 1900.

In the nineteenth century an academy was what later became known as a high school; in most places in the U.S. there were no public schools above the primary level. Some older high schools, such as Corning Free Academy, retained the term in their names (Corning Free Academy, demoted to a middle school, closed in 2014). In 1753, Benjamin Franklin established the academy and Charitable School of the Province of Pennsylvania. In 1755, it was renamed the college and Academy and Charitable School of Philadelphia. Today, it is known as the University of Pennsylvania. The United States Military Academy was formed in 1802 as a college. It never included a preparatory unit. 

The religious revival known as the Second Great Awakening stimulated Protestant denominations to open academies and colleges. In the small town of Amherst, Massachusetts in 1812, funds were raised for a secondary school, Amherst Academy; it opened December 1814. The academy incorporated in 1816, and eventually counted among its students Emily Dickinson, Sylvester Graham, and Mary Lyon (founder of Mount Holyoke College). By 1821 it added a higher education with Amherst College. Besides religion, the academy movement arose from a public sense that education in the classic disciplines needed to be extended into the western states. 

Thousands of academies were started using local funds and tuition; most closed after a few years and others were established. In 1860 there were 6,415 academies in operation. When the Civil War erupted in 1861 they generally closed down temporarily; most in the South never reopened.

Like Amherst, a number of colleges began as (high school) academies, then became a college by adding post-secondary unit, and then finally dropped the pre-collegiate academy. Several colleges were indirectly influenced by the academy model, including Brown University in Rhode Island and Dartmouth College in New Hampshire.In 1753, Benjamin Franklin established the academy and Charitable School of the Province of Pennsylvania. In 1755, it was renamed the college and Academy and Charitable School of Philadelphia. It evolved into the University of Pennsylvania. 

By 1840 3,204 academies and similar secondary schools were in operation. Most lasted only a few years but others were created and by 1860 6,415 were in operation nationwide. 
The first public secondary schools started around the 1830s and 40s within the wealthier areas of similar income levels and greatly expanded after 1865 into the 1890s.

===Public high schools===
Many high schools in the 19th century contained a &quot;normal school&quot; which trained students as teachers in common schools. Most of those enrolled were young women planning to teach a few years before marriage.

High school enrollment increased when schools at this level became free tuition, and when compulsory education laws required teenagers to attend until a certain age. It was believed that every American student had the opportunity to participate regardless of their ability.

In 1892, in response to many competing academic philosophies being promoted at the time, a working group of educators, known as the &quot;Committee of Ten&quot; was established by the National Education Association. It recommended twelve years of instruction, consisting of eight years of elementary education followed by four years of high school. Rejecting suggestions that high schools should divide students into college-bound and working-trades groups from the start, and in some cases also by race or ethnic background, they unanimously recommended that &quot;every subject which is taught at all in a secondary school should be taught in the same way and to the same extent to every pupil so long as he pursues it, no matter what the probable destination of the pupil may be, or at what point his education is to cease.&quot;

===20th century===

Between 1910 and 1940, the high school movement resulted in rapidly increasing founding of public high schools in many cities and towns and later with further expansions in each locality with the establishment of neighborhood, district, or community high schools in the larger cities which may have had one or two schools since the 19th century. High school enrollment and graduation numbers and rates increased markedly, mainly due to the building of new schools, and a practical curriculum based on gaining skills &quot;for life&quot; rather than &quot;for college&quot;. There was a shift towards local decision making by school districts, and a policy of easy and open enrollment. The shift from theoretical to a more practical approach in curriculum also resulted in an increase of skilled blue-collar workers. The open enrollment nature and relatively relaxed standards, such as ease of repeating a grade, also contributed to the boom in secondary schooling. There was an increase in educational attainment, primarily from the grass-roots movement of building and staffing public high schools.
By mid-century, comprehensive high schools became common, which were designed to give a free education to any student who chose to stay in school for 12 years to get a diploma with a minimal grade point average.

In 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court case, &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, made desegregation of elementary and high schools mandatory, although private Christian schools expanded rapidly following this ruling to accommodate white families attempting to avoid desegregation.

By 1955, the enrollment rates of secondary schools in the United States were around 80%, higher than enrollment rates in most or all European countries. The goal became to minimize the number who exited at the mandatory attendance age, which varies by state between 14 and 18 years of age, and become considered to be dropouts, at risk of economic failure.

In 1965, the far-reaching Elementary and Secondary Education Act (&#x27;ESEA&#x27;), passed as a part of President Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s War on Poverty, provided funds for primary and secondary education known as Title I funding while explicitly forbidding the establishment of a national curriculum. It emphasized equal access to education and established high standards and accountability. The bill also aimed to shorten the achievement gaps between students by providing every child with fair and equal opportunities to achieve an exceptional education.

After 1980, the growth in educational attainment decreased, which caused the growth of the educated workforce to slow down.

Under the education reform movement started in the early 1990s by many state legislatures and the federal government, about two-thirds of the nation&#x27;s public high school students are required to pass a graduation exam, usually at the 10th and higher grade levels, though no new states had adopted a new requirement in 2006. This requirement has been an object of controversy when states have started to withhold diplomas, and the right to attend commencement exercises, if a student does not meet the standards set by the state.

Pressure to allow people and organizations to create new Charter schools developed during the 1980s and were embraced by the American Federation of Teachers in 1988. These would be legally and financially autonomous public school free from many state laws and district regulations, and accountable more for student outcomes rather than for processes or inputs. Minnesota was the first state to pass a charter school law in 1991. 

In 2001, the No Child Left Behind Act required all public schools receiving federal funding to administer a statewide standardized test annually to all students. Schools that receive Title I funding must make Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) in test scores; for instance, each year, fifth graders must do better on standardized tests than the previous year&#x27;s fifth graders. Schools that miss AYP for a second consecutive year are publicly labeled as in need of improvement, and students have the option to transfer to a better school within the school district, if such options exist. 

Standards-based education has been embraced in most states which changed the measurement of success to academic achievement, rather than the completion of 12 years of education. By 2006, two-thirds of students lived in states with effective standards requiring passing tests to ensure that all graduates had achieved these standards.

By 2009, charter schools were operating in 41 of the 50 states and the national capital of Washington, D.C., and 59% of these had waiting lists.

==Curriculum==

Authority to regulate education resides constitutionally with the individual states, with direct authority of the U.S. Congress and the federal U.S. Department of Education being limited to regulation and enforcement of federal constitutional rights. Great indirect authority is, however, exercised through federal funding of national programs and block grants although there is no obligation upon any state to accept these funds. The U.S. government may also propose, but cannot enforce national goals, objectives and standards, which generally lie beyond its jurisdiction.

Many high schools in the United States offer a choice of vocational or college prep curriculum. Schools that offer vocational programs include a very high level of technical specialization, e.g., auto mechanics or carpentry, with a half-day instruction/approved work program in senior year as the purpose of the program is to prepare students for gainful employment without a college degree. The level of specialization allowed varies depending on both the state and district the school is located in.

===Core===
Many states require courses in the &quot;core&quot; areas of English (or Language Arts), Science, Social Studies (or History), and Mathematics every year although others allow more choice after 10th grade.

Three science courses, biology, chemistry, and physics are usually offered. Many schools follow the curriculum set by Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). Other science courses offered at high schools include geology, ecology, astronomy, health, and forensic.

High school math courses typically include Pre-algebra, Algebra I, Geometry, Algebra II with trigonometry classes. Advanced study options can include Precalculus, Calculus, and Statistics.

English and language classes are usually required for four years of high school although many schools count journalism, public speaking/debate, foreign language, literature, drama, and writing (both technical and creative) classes as English/Language classes.

Social studies classes include History, Political Science, Economics and Geography. Political science and Economics classes are sometimes combined as two semesters of a year-long course. Additional study options can include classes in Sociology, and Psychology.

Many states require a health or wellness course in order to graduate. The class typically covers basic anatomy, nutrition, first aid, sexual education, and how to make responsible decisions regarding illegal drugs, tobacco, and alcohol. In some places, contraception is not allowed to be taught for religious reasons. In some places, the health and physical education class are combined into one class or are offered in alternate semesters. In some private schools, such as Catholic schools, theology is required before a student graduates. Two years of physical education (usually referred to as &quot;gym,&quot; &quot;PE&quot; or &quot;phys ed&quot; by students) is commonly required, although some states and school districts require that all students take Physical Education every term.

Most high schools in the country offer Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) courses to be taken instead of the ones created by the school and/or school district. These classes have a standard curriculum, making them easy to study for, but are more rigorous as they are college level. Students may take these for classes they are more proficient in if they want a challenge. If students earn a good score on a test given later in the school year, they are given college credit at participating universities.

===Electives===
Public high schools offer a wide variety of elective courses, which are classes that don&#x27;t fall under any of the &#x27;core&#x27; categories. Students usually choose to take elective classes tailored to their personality, interests, and after school activities. The availability of such courses depends upon each particular school, varying based on what the building can support and if the school can afford to hold them. Electives may be taken over the course of a full year or over the course of an academic term. Students are usually required to take several elective classes over the course of high school to graduate. This can include physical education and foreign language classes, but sometimes these are separate.

Common types of electives include:
*Visual arts (drawing, sculpture, painting, photography, film studies, and art history)
*Performing arts (choir, drama, band, orchestra, dance, guitar)
*Vocational education (woodworking, metalworking, computer-aided drafting, automobile repair, agriculture, cosmetology, FFA)
*Computer science/information technology (word processing, computer programming, robotics, graphic design, computer club, web design and web programming, video game design, music production)
*Journalism/publishing (school newspaper, yearbook, television production)
*Foreign languages (These are usually Spanish, French, and German, but schools have also offered Mandarin Chinese, Japanese, Latin, Greek, Russian, and even American Sign Language, among many others.)
* Business education (Accounting, Data Processing, Entrepreneurship, Finance, Business, Information and Communication Technology, Management, Marketing, and Secretarial)
*Family and consumer science/home economics (nutrition, nursing, culinary, child development)
*Junior Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (In some schools, JROTC may replace a credit of health or P.E.) and gun clubs and shooting teams
*Some American high schools offer drivers&#x27; education. At some schools, a student can take it during school as a regular course for a credit. At some schools, drivers education courses are only available after school.

The Association for Career and Technical Education is the largest U.S. association dedicated to promoting this type of education.

=== Credits, grades, and graduation ===
High schools in the United States decide if students are able to graduate based on how many credits they have earned. How many credits are required to graduate and how many credits students earn from classes vary state by state. As an example, in Oregon, students are required to obtain a total of 24 credits before they graduate. At the end of a semester (halfway through the school year), the student earns 0.5 credits for each class they have a passing grade in (usually above 50%). If the student does not earn a credit, they are able to earn the credit through retaking the class, taking a specific credit recovery class, taking the class at a summer school, or taking the same or an equivalent class online. These options are also available for students who wish to get a better grade.

If a student does not have the total required credits needed to graduate at the end of their senior year of high school, the student will stay for another year or until they meet the required amount of credits. On the contrary, if a student earns enough credits required to graduate before the end of their senior year (usually at the end of 11th grade or the middle of 12th grade) they can graduate early.

Depending on the circumstances, students may receive a diploma different from the standard. Students that take a certain number of honors classes or college credit classes can receive an advanced diploma. The highest-performing student in the grade usually receives the valedictorian title, along with a special diploma. On the contrary, students with extenuating circumstances (for example, the COVID-19 pandemic) that negatively impacted or interrupted their learning may receive a modified diploma.

Usually, to graduate, students need to take and pass four years of English (or Language Arts) classes, four years of Social Studies (or History) classes, three years of Math classes, (but four are recommended), Three years of Science classes, (but four are recommended), two years of Foreign language classes, one year of a Health education class, one year of a Physical education class, and a varying number of elective classes.

Grades in American schools range from A (90% to 100%) to F (59% and below), excluding E. To pass a class and receive a credit for it, students usually need to receive a grade between A to D, or 100% to 60%. F, or 59% and below would be failing and students wouldn&#x27;t receive credit for the class. An A grade is for greatly exceeding the expected standard, a B grade is for exceeding the expected standard, a C is the expected standard, a D is falling behind the expected standard, and an F (or fail) is greatly behind the expected standard. 

Sometimes a letter grade can have a + or a - next to it, related to what percentage was given.

* A+: 97% to 100%
* A: 96% to 94% (or 90% to 100%)
* A-: 93% to 90%
* B+: 89% to 87%
* B: 86% to 84% (or 80% to 89%)
* B-: 83% to 80%
* C+: 79% to 77%
* C: 76% to 74% (or 70% to 79%)
* C-: 73% to 70%
* D+: 69% to 67%
* D: 66% to 64% (or 60% to 69%)
* D-: 63% to 60%
* F(ail): 59% and below

Instructors may choose to have the lowest possible grade be a 50%, and only grade 0% to assignments that have not been turned in.

==Levels of education==
===Middle school / Junior high school===
Middle schools and junior high schools are schools that which straddle elementary and high school education. &quot;Middle&quot; schools commonly serve sixth grade, seventh grade, and eighth grade; but in some districts, middle schools only have grades 7 and 8. &quot;Junior high&quot; schools, on the other hand, usually exclude sixth grade and often include ninth grade instead. Rarely, middle and junior high schools can also include fifth grade.

Upon arrival in middle school or junior high school, students begin to enroll in class schedules in which they will take classes with several teachers in different classrooms on any given day. (This is a sharp transition from the primary or elementary school model in which students remain with a single teacher in a single classroom.) The classes are usually a set of four or five (if foreign language is included in the curriculum) core academic classes (English or &quot;language arts,&quot; science, mathematics, history or &quot;social studies,&quot; and in some schools, foreign language) with two to four other classes, either electives, supplementary, or remedial academic classes.

Some students also start taking a foreign language or advanced math and science classes in middle school. Typically schools will offer Spanish and French; and, often German; and, sometimes Latin; Chinese, Japanese, and/or Greek. In addition to Pre-Algebra and other high school mathematics prep courses, Algebra I and Geometry are both commonly taught. Schools also offer Earth Science, Life Science, or Physical Science classes. Physical education classes (also called &quot;PE&quot;, &quot;phys ed&quot;, Kinesiology, or &quot;gym&quot;) are usually mandatory for various periods. For social studies, some schools offer U.S. History, Geography, and World History classes.

Many also have honors classes for motivated and gifted students, where the quality of education is higher and much more is expected from the enrolled student.

==== Intermediate school ====
Intermediate school is an uncommon term, and can &quot;either&quot; be a synonym for middle school (notably as used by the New York City public schools) or for schools that encompass the latter years of elementary education prior &quot;to&quot; middle school/junior high school, serving grades 3 or 4 through 5 or 6. These can also be called &#x27;upper elementary&#x27; schools.

===High school / Senior high school===
High schools, or senior high schools, are schools that span grades 8, 9, or 10 through 12. Most American high schools are comprehensive high schools and accept all students from their local area, regardless of ability or vocational/college track. Students have significant control of their education, and may choose even their core classes, although the control given to students varies from state to state and school to school. The schools are managed by local school districts rather than by the central government.

Some states and cities offer special high schools with examinations to admit only the highest performing students, such as Boston Latin School, several schools in the New York City Specialized High School system or Alexandria, Virginia&#x27;s Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology. Other high schools cater to the arts. Some schools have been set up for students who do not succeed with normal academic standards; while others, like Harvey Milk High School, have even been created for special social groups such as LGBT students.

Most states operate special residential schools for the blind and deaf, although a substantial number of such students are mainstreamed into standard schools. Several operate residential high schools for highly gifted students in specialized areas such as science, mathematics, or the arts. A smaller number of high schools are operated by the Department of Defense on military bases for children of military personnel.

Most high schools have classes known as &quot;honors&quot; classes for motivated and gifted students, where the quality of education is higher and much more is expected from the enrolled student. Some high schools offer Regular Honors (H) (sometimes called Advanced), Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) courses, which are special forms of honors classes. International schools offering programs of study in line with foreign systems of Education, such as those of Britain and France, are also available. Some schools also offer dual-enrollment programs, in which select classes at a university may be taken for both university and high school credit.

Graduation from high school or senior high school leads to the awarding of the high school diploma. After this, secondary education is considered complete and students may pursue tertiary level study.

==Types of schools==

Secondary education can be provided within a number of different schools and settings.

=== Public schools ===

The United States public education system is structured into three levels: elementary (also known as primary) education, middle and high school (which is secondary together) education, and college or university level (also known as post-secondary) education. Schooling starts at age 5–6 and ends anywhere from 16 to 18 depending on the school system, state policy, and the student&#x27;s progress. Pre-School or Pre-Kindergarten accept as young as age 3 and is not required. From there education models differ as elementary school can last anywhere from to depending on the structure. Some states have middle schools which is part of secondary education and between elementary school and high school encompassing grades from 6 to 9, while others have no middle school and instead combined mixed high schools.

All children are guaranteed the right to a free public elementary and secondary education when living within the jurisdiction of the United States regardless of race, gender, ability, citizen status, religion or economic status. Public education in the United States is mainly the responsibility of State and local level administration levels. As of 2010–2011 around 13,588 school districts exist within which around 98,800 public schools exist in the United States. Only 8% of funding for public schools comes from federal sources, the other 92% comes mostly from state and local funding. Curriculum requirements vary state by state as it is up to these states and local school districts, in addition to national associations if applicable, to come up with and be approved by the federal government in order for them to receive funding. Most schools mark proficiency in a subject through the A-F grading scale accumulating throughout years creating a grade point average or G.P.A. Parent involvement is encouraged in the U.S. with many having parent-teacher associations otherwise known as PTAs.

=== Independent schools ===

Independent schools are schools that are not public and not run by any government, but rather function as an independent institution. Independent schools range from levels of kindergarten to undergraduate, various institution usually accommodating different levels. Most independent schools have a tuition cost of attendance As of 2013–2014 there were 33,619 independent schools in the United States. Most independent schools in the United States are associated with religious orientations making up 68.7% of all private schools as of 2013–2014. This is a number had an increasing trend in the period of 1989–2005 however, it dropped by about 9% in 2006–2007, but seems to be increasing again.

All independent schools must comply with federal laws of non-discrimination and health privacy &amp; financial security laws. These include:

- Age Discrimination in Employment Act (for employees or applicants over the age of 40)

- Americans with Disabilities Act

- Equal Pay Act

- 42 U.S.C. § 1986 (discrimination based on race)

- Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1979

- Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (discrimination based on race, color, sex, religion, and/or national origin)

- Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (employment or reemployment discrimination based on military service)

- Revenue Procedure 75-50 (independent schools can not discriminate on the basis of race in any programs or financial assistance)

More specific legal restrictions apply to private schools on the state level and vary based on the state.

Independent schools can accept money from the federal government otherwise called &quot;Federal financial assistance&quot; which can come as funds in the form of grants or loans, donations, assets and property or interest in property, services by federal employees or contract of intent to receive federal assistance, involvement in federal programs. Schools receiving funding must comply with additional federal regulations included in many of the above acts. However, a policy can also have exceptions to these regulations based on the private school characteristics, such as religious beliefs that the law would be defying or being involved in military development.

===Charter schools===

Charter schools are subject to fewer rules, regulations, and statutes than traditional state schools, receive less public funding than public schools, typically a fixed amount per pupil and are often over-subscribed.

===College-preparatory schools===

College-preparatory schools, commonly referred to as &#x27;prep schools&#x27;, can be either publicly funded, charter schools or private independent secondary schools funded by tuition fees and philanthropic donations, and governed by independent boards of trustees. Fewer than 1% of students enrolled in school in the United States attend an independent private preparatory school, a small fraction compared with the 9% who attend parochial schools and 88% who attend public schools. While these schools are not subject to government oversight or regulation, they are accredited by one of the six regional accreditation agencies for educational institutions.

===Homeschooling===

It is estimated that some 2 million or 2.9% of U.S. children are home educated. Home schooling is lawful in all 50 states, and although the U.S. Supreme Court has never ruled on homeschooling specifically, in &quot;Wisconsin v. Yoder&quot;, 406 U.S. 205 (1972) it supported the rights of Amish parents to keep their children out of public schools for religious reasons.

== Types of scheduling ==

At the secondary level, students transition from the American primary education system of remaining with one class in one classroom with one teacher for the entire school day to taking multiple courses taught by different teachers in different classrooms. This system is also used by American colleges and universities at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. It requires students to develop time management and navigation skills in order to efficiently race from one classroom to the next during each school day, and to develop interpersonal communication skills in order to interact with many more teachers and classmates than before.

=== Traditional scheduling ===
Students take six, seven, eight, or sometimes nine classes per day all year long. Six classes are around 50–60 minutes in length. Seven classes are around 45–52 minutes in length. Eight classes are around 40–48 minutes in length. Nine classes are around 42 minutes or less in length.

=== Block scheduling ===
==== Alternate day block scheduling ====
Also referred to as A/B (day) scheduling, Odd/Even (day) scheduling, or (day) 1/2 block scheduling. Students take three to four courses, around 90–120 minutes in length, per day all year long on alternating days resulting in a full six or eight courses per year. An example table of a possible schedule is provided below.
==== 4x4 Block Scheduling ====
Students take four courses, around 90 minutes in length, every day for the first semester and take four different courses every day for the second semester. This results in a full eight courses taken per year. An example table of a possible schedule is provided below.
==Teacher certification==
Teachers are certified in one of two areas for high school (and in some states, certification can be to teach grades 6–12). These certifications can overlap. In Missouri, for example, middle school certification covers grades 6–8, elementary school certification covers kindergarten to grade 5, and high school certification covers grades 9–12. This reflects the wide range of grade combinations of middle schools, junior high schools, and elementary schools. Alternatively, some states certify teachers in various curricular areas (such as math or history) to teach secondary education.

== Compulsory education ==

Compulsory education laws refer to &quot;legislative mandates that school-aged children [shall] attend public, nonpublic, or homeschools until reaching specified ages.&quot; In most cases, local school attendance officers enforce compulsory education laws, and all jurisdictions hold parents/legal guardians responsible to ensure their child/children attend school.

Compulsory education first became required in Massachusetts upon the passing of the Compulsory Attendance Act of 1852. The law required that all children eight to fourteen to attend school for three months out of the year, and of these twelve weeks, six of them had to be consecutive. The only exceptions to this law was if the child already attended another school for the same amount of time, proof the child had already learned the material, if they lived in poverty, or the child had a physical or mental disability preventing them from learning the material.

Later, in 1873, the law was revised. The age limit was reduced from 14 to 12, but the annual attendance requirement was increased to 20 weeks a year. By 1918, all U.S. states had some sort of mandatory attendance law for school.

<doc id="378410" wikidata="Q7443835" url="?curid=378410" title="Secondary education in Japan">
<text>Secondary education in Japan is split into junior high schools (中学校 &quot;chūgakkō&quot;), which cover the seventh through ninth grade, and senior high schools (高等学校 &quot;kōtōgakkō&quot;, abbreviated to 高校 &quot;kōkō&quot;), which mostly cover grades ten through twelve.

==Junior high school==

Lower-secondary schools cover grades seven, eight, and nine. Ages are 12/13-14/15 with increased focus on academic studies. Although it is possible to leave the formal education system after completing lower secondary school and find employment, fewer than 4% did so by the late 1980s.

Most junior high schools in the 1980s were government-funded public schools; 5% were private schools. At per pupil, private schools had a per-student cost that was four times as high as public schools.

The minimum number of school days in a year is 210 in Japan, compared to 180 in the United States. A significant part of the school calendar is taken up by non-academic events such as sports days and school trips.

Teachers often majored in the subjects they taught. Each class is assigned a homeroom teacher who doubles as counselor. Unlike elementary students, junior high school students have different teachers for different subjects. The subject teachers usually move to a new room for each 50-minute period. Usually, students&#x27; lunch is provided by the school itself.

===Instruction===
Instruction tends to rely on the lecture method.　Teachers also use other media, such as television and radio, and there is some laboratory work. By 1989, about 45% of all public lower-secondary schools had computers, including schools that used them only for administrative purposes. Classroom organization is still based on small work groups, although no longer for reasons of discipline. Students are expected to have mastered daily routines and acceptable behavior.

All course contents are specified in the Course of Study for Lower-Secondary Schools. Some subjects, such as Japanese language and mathematics, are coordinated with the elementary curriculum. The curriculum covers Japanese language, English, social studies, mathematics, science, music, fine arts, industrial arts, homemaking, health, and physical education. Moral education and special activities continue to receive attention.

===Extracurricular activities===

Many students participate in after-school clubs. Sports clubs, such as baseball, are especially popular among boys, while wind bands are one of the most popular clubs for girls. Football (soccer) clubs are gaining popularity. Other popular sports clubs include tennis, basketball, gymnastics, Judo and volleyball. In every sport, many games are held between schools and at the regional level, so students have opportunities to compete.

For cultural clubs, choir and art clubs, brass band, tea ceremony, and flower arrangement clubs are popular.

Some junior high schools encourage students to take academic ability tests such as the STEP Eiken for English or the Kanji kentei for Japanese.

Students in the highest grades of elementary, junior high, and senior high schools also take trips lasting up to several days to culturally important cities such as Kyoto and Nara, ski resorts, or other places such as Tokyo, Osaka, Okinawa and Hokkaido.

==Senior high school==
Even though upper-secondary school is not compulsory in Japan, as of 2005 94% of all junior high school graduates entered high schools and over 95% of students graduated successfully from them.

To enter, students typically take an entrance examination in Japanese, mathematics, science, social studies, and English, whether it is standardized for all public high schools in the prefecture or a test created by a private high school for that school alone.

===Daily life===
High schools typically begin at 8:30, when teachers meet for a five-minute meeting, followed by homeroom. Students assemble in their homerooms of an average of around 40 students each, Homeroom teachers are in charge of morning or afternoon homeroom times, about five minutes each, as well as a weekly long homeroom period.

Many students are assigned to specific task committees in their homeroom class.

There are four classes of 50 minutes each before lunch. Students go to different classrooms for physical education, laboratory classes, or other specialized courses; otherwise, teachers change classrooms instead of the students for the entire day. Students typically attend between ten and fourteen courses a year.

Some schools do not have their own cafeteria, so students generally eat in their homerooms instead. Unlike students in elementary and middle school, high school students do not have government-subsidized lunches. Because of this, many students bring bento from home. After lunch students have two more classes. Typically, by 3:30 PM, students are free to attend extracurricular activities.

Saturday schooling, when offered, ends at 1 PM after four courses.

====Extracurriculars====
In most schools, there are two types of extracurricular clubs, sports clubs and culture clubs. New students usually choose a club after the school year begins and only rarely change for the rest of their high school careers. Clubs meet for two hours after school every day, and often during school vacations. These clubs are an important chance for students to make friends and learn social etiquette and relationships like the senpai/kohai dynamic.

===Curriculum===
Schools have limited autonomy in developing their curriculum or choosing their textbooks. Instead, although the latter are written and produced in the private sector, the Ministry of Education has the final say over any and all content and materials. Typically students take three years each of mathematics, social studies, Japanese, science, and English, with additional courses including physical education, music, art, and moral studies. In particular social studies in Japan is broken down into civics, geography, Japanese history, world history, sociology, and politics/economics. There are a large number of mandatory courses, and a few number of electives.

Upper-secondary teachers are university graduates. Upper-secondary schools are organized into departments, and teachers specialize in their field of study although they teach a variety of courses sharing a more general discipline. Teaching depends largely on the lecture system, with the main goal being to cover the curriculum. Approach and subject coverage tends to be uniform, at least in the public schools.

==Education reforms==

The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) recognizes a need to improve the teaching of all foreign languages, especially English. To improve instruction in spoken English, the government invites many young native speakers of English to Japan to serve as assistants to school boards and prefectures under its Japan Exchange and Teaching Program. By 2005 participants numbered over 6,000. In the last few years, several school boards in Japan have relied on ALTs (Assistant Language Teacher) from private dispatch companies.

As part of the movement to develop an integrated curriculum and the education reform movement of the late 1980s, the entire Course of Study for Lower-Secondary Schools was revised in 1989 and took effect in the 1992–93 school year. A main aim of the reform is to equip students with the basic knowledge needed for citizenship. In some measure, this means increased emphasis on Japanese history and culture, as well as understanding Japan as a nation and its relationships with other nations of the world. The course of study also increased elective hours, recommending that electives be chosen in light of individual student differences and with an eye toward diversification.

A further revision to the Fundamental Law of Education was carried out on 22 December 2006. The revised law leaves the structure of schooling basically the same but includes new emphases on respect for Japanese culture (Article 2.5), school discipline (Article 6.2), and parental responsibility (Article 10).

===Junior high issues===

Two problems of great concern to educators and citizens began to appear at the lower-secondary level in the 1980s: bullying, which remains a major problem, and the school-refusal syndrome (toko kyohi; manifested by excessive absenteeism), which was on the rise. In 2008, there were 42,754 incidents of problematic behavior in junior high schools, according to a government survey.

Experts disagreed over the specific causes of these phenomena, but there is general agreement that the system offers little individualized or specialized assistance, thus contributing to disaffection among those who can not conform to its demands or who are otherwise experiencing difficulties. Another problem concerns Japanese children returning from abroad. These students, particularly if they have been overseas for extended periods, often need help in reading and writing — and in adjusting to rigid classroom demands. Even making the adjustment does not guarantee acceptance. Besides having acquired a foreign language, many of these students have also acquired foreign customs of speech, dress, and behavior that mark them as different.

===Senior high issues===

The upper-secondary curriculum underwent thorough revision in 1989. That year a new Course of Study for Upper-Secondary Schools was announced that was to be phased in beginning with the tenth grade in 1994, followed by the eleventh grade in 1995 and the twelfth grade in 1996. Among noteworthy changes is the requirement that male and female students take a course in home economics. The government is concerned with instilling in all students an awareness of the importance of family life, the roles and responsibilities of family members, the concept of cooperation within the family, and the role of the family in society. The family continues to be an extremely important part of the social infrastructure, and the ministry clearly is interested in maintaining family stability within a changing society. Another change of note was the division of the old social studies course into &quot;history-and-geography&quot; and &quot;civics&quot; courses.

<doc id="378413" wikidata="Q26869819" url="?curid=378413" title="Secondary education in France">
<text>In France, secondary education is in two stages:
* Collèges () cater for the first four years of secondary education from the ages of 11 to 14.
* Lycées () provide a three-year course of further secondary education for students between the ages of 15 and 19. Pupils are prepared for the &quot;baccalauréat&quot; (; baccalaureate, colloquially known as &quot;bac&quot;, previously &quot;bachot&quot;), which can lead to higher education studies or directly to professional life. There are three main types of &quot;baccalauréat&quot;: the &quot;baccalauréat général&quot;, &quot;baccalauréat technologique&quot; and &quot;baccalauréat professionnel&quot;.

==School year==
The school year starts in early September and ends in early July. Metropolitan French school holidays are scheduled by the Ministry of Education by dividing the country into three zones (A, B, and C) to prevent overcrowding by family holidaymakers of tourist destinations, such as the Mediterranean coast and ski resorts. Lyon, for example, is in zone A, Marseille is in zone B and Paris and Bordeaux are in zone C.

In contrast to the practice in most other education systems, the school years in France are numbered on a decreasing scale. Thus, pupils begin their secondary education in the &quot;sixième&quot; (6th class) and transfer to a &quot;lycée&quot; in the &quot;seconde&quot; (2nd class). The final year is the &quot;terminale&quot;.

In French, the word &quot;étudiant(e)&quot; is usually reserved for university-level students, and &quot;collège&quot; and &quot;lycée&quot; students are referred to as &quot;élèves&quot; (&quot;pupils&quot; or &quot;students&quot; in English).

The curriculum (&quot;programme officiel&quot;) is standardized for all French public institutions. Changes to the programme are made every year by the French Ministry of Education and are published in the Ministry&#x27;s &quot;Bulletin officiel de l&#x27;Éducation nationale&quot; (&quot;BO&quot;), the official reference bulletin for educators.

==Collège==

The collège is the first level of secondary education in the French educational system. A pupil attending &quot;collège&quot; is called &quot;collégien&quot; (boy) or &quot;collégienne&quot; (girl). Men and women teachers at the &quot;collège&quot;- and &quot;lycée&quot;-level are called &quot;professeur&quot; (no official feminine professional form exists in France although the feminine form &quot;professeure&quot; has appeared and seems to be gaining some ground in usage). The City of Paris refers to a collège in English as a &quot;high school&quot;.

Entry in &quot;sixième&quot; occurs directly after the last year of primary school, called &quot;Cours moyen deuxième année&quot; (CM2). There is no entrance examination into &quot;collège&quot;, but administrators have established a comprehensive academic examination of students starting in &quot;sixième&quot;. The purpose of the examination is evaluating pupils&#x27; level on being graduated from primary school. 
===Curriculum===

The table at the right details the French curriculum. Along with 3-4 weekly hours of physical education, a typical school week consists of some 26 hours of schooling. French language and literature occupy the most time, 4-5 hours per week, followed by 4 hours per week of mathematics; other subjects occupy 1-3.5 hours per week.

The curriculum is devised by the French Ministry of National Education and applies to all &quot;collèges&quot; in France and also for AEFE-dependent institutions. &quot;Académies&quot; and individual schools have little margin for curriculum customisation. Teachers compose syllabi per precise government educational regulations and choose textbooks accordingly, and every major French publishing house has a textbook branch.

=== Process and purpose ===
Usually a different &quot;professeur&quot; or teacher teaches each subject; most teachers teach several different age groups. &quot;Collège&quot; pupils stay in the same class throughout the school year and in every subject (except for optional courses such as foreign languages, where students from several classes mix), so each year-group is divided into as many classes as necessary. The strong belief in teaching in mixed-ability classes means that streaming occurs only rarely.

Class sizes vary from school to school, but usually range from 20 to 35 pupils. Each class has a &quot;professeur principal&quot; (main teacher or class tutor) who acts as the link between the teaching staff, administration and pupils.

Ultimately, the &quot;collège&quot; has the task of preparing students for the advanced subjects of the &quot;lycée&quot;. At the end of the &quot;troisième&quot; class, students sit for &quot;le diplôme national du brevet&quot;, an end-of-&quot;collège&quot; examination. The &quot;brevet&quot; is not required for entrance to the &quot;lycée&quot;, and passing it does not guarantee that a pupil will progress to the higher-level school.

During the last &quot;conseil de classe&quot; of the year, held in June, teachers and administrators decide whether or not a pupil can progress to the next grade. In deciding, they evaluate the student&#x27;s skills, participation, and behaviour. One of three outcomes is possible:
# The student progresses to the next grade.
# His or her &quot;redoublement&quot; (repeating the year) can be required.
# He or she can, in specific cases, be offered to skip a grade and be promoted two grades.
A student asked to repeat a grade can appeal said decision. The decision of the appeals council is final.
== Lycée ==

The &quot;lycée&quot; () is the second and last stage of secondary education in the French educational system. The City of Paris refers to a lycée in English as a &quot;sixth form college&quot;. A pupil attending a &quot;lycée&quot; is a &quot;lycéen&quot; (masculine) or a &quot;lycéenne&quot; (feminine).

Until 1959, the term &quot;lycée&quot; designated a secondary school with a full curriculum (seven years, the present college + lycée) directly under the supervision of the state, then from 1959 to 1963 any secondary school with a full curriculum. Older &quot;lycées&quot; still include a &quot;collège&quot; section, so a pupil attending a &quot;lycée&quot; may actually be a &quot;collégien&quot;.

At the end of the final year of schooling, most students take the baccalauréat diploma. There are three main types of &quot;baccalauréat&quot;, which are completely different from each other: the &quot;baccalauréat général&quot; (general baccalaureate), the &quot;baccalauréat technologique&quot; (technological baccalaureate), and the &quot;baccalauréat professionnel&quot; (professional baccalaureate).

&quot;Lycées&quot; are divided into (i) the &quot;lycée général&quot;, leading to two or more years of post–baccalauréat studies, (ii) the &quot;lycée technologique&quot;, leading to short-term studies, and (iii) the &quot;lycée professionnel&quot;, a vocational qualification leading directly to a particular career. General and technological education courses are provided in &quot;standard&quot; &quot;lycées&quot;, while vocational courses are provided in separate professional &quot;lycées&quot;.

In practice, competent pupils at a vocational &quot;lycée professionnel&quot; can also apply to take short-term, post–baccalauréat studies leading to the &quot;Brevet de technicien supérieur&quot; (BTS), a vocational qualification. That option is available also to pupils at a &quot;lycée général&quot;.

===Lycée général and lycée technologique===
====General streams (&quot;baccalauréat général&quot;)====
In France, the &quot;lycée général&quot; is the usual stepping stone to university degrees. 

Before 2021, the students of the general baccalaureate chose one of three streams (termed &quot;séries&quot;) in the penultimate &quot;lycée&quot; year (S for Sciences; ES for Economics and Social sciences; and L for Literature). During the &quot;seconde&quot;, students mostly take the same courses, despite having different academic skills and interests, so it is usually thought to be an easier year than either the &quot;première&quot; or the &quot;terminale&quot;.

The &quot;baccalauréat général&quot; examination is different for all three &quot;séries&quot;, and subjects are weighted according to the course taken.
According to the official statistics, for the 2003–2004 school year, 33 percent of all students chose &quot;série S&quot;; 19 percent chose &quot;série ES&quot;; and 11 percent chose &quot;série L&quot;.

All students take philosophy courses in &quot;terminale&quot;, while French language classes end in the &quot;première&quot;, excepting the &quot;série L&quot;, where they become French literature classes, where pupils are to study two books during the year, from French writers, or foreign books translated into French (e.g. &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; during the school year 2007–2008, or &quot;The Leopard&quot; from Italian author Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa).

There also is a required option for further specialisation in all &quot;séries&quot;, although it is restricted to the chosen course. For example, a student in &quot;série S&quot; can choose to specialise in mathematics, physics, &quot;&quot;SVT&quot; (biology and geology) or &quot;engineering sciences&quot; but not in philosophy.

A student in &quot;série L&quot; can choose to specialise in one of his or her foreign languages (English being the most popular), a third foreign language or a dead language such as Latin, or one of the following arts: music, theatre, circus, &quot;plastiques&quot;. Specialisation adds a separate, weekly two-hour class in the chosen discipline; also, it increases the weight of the chosen subject at the &quot;baccalauréat&quot;. The syllabus in the specialisation class is unrelated to the material learned in the common class. Specialisation plays no role in the choice of a post–secondary career or subject at university, except for a few courses aimed for students from a given &quot;série&quot; that can also accept students from other &quot;séries&quot; if they have taken a given specialisation.

Starting from the 2020-21 academic year, the S, ES and L streams of the general baccalaureate are deleted. Students of the general baccalaureate now choose three specialty courses, then keep two in the final year. There are 12 specialties (that vary in their availability depending on the school): arts, ecology, history &amp; geography, humanities, languages, literature, mathematics, computer science, physics &amp; chemistry, economic and social sciences, engineering sciences, biology &amp; geology. These specialties are added to a part common to all: French, philosophy, history &amp; geography, languages, sciences, sport. A large part of the examinations are now done over the school year but the students also have final exams in their 2 specialties as well as in philosophy, added to a general oral examination.

==== Technical streams (&quot;baccalauréat technologique&quot;) ====
After the &quot;seconde&quot;, students can also go on the &quot;lycée technologique&quot; to obtain the &quot;baccalaureat technologique.&quot; It includes eight other streams, called &quot;séries technologiques&quot;:

* &quot;sciences et technologies de la gestion&quot; (Management Sciences and Technologies, &quot;STG&quot;) (replaced &quot;sciences et technologies tertiaires&quot; (Service Sciences and Technologies, &quot;STT&quot;) for the June 2007 Bac Exam)
* &quot;sciences et technologies de l&#x27;industrie et du développement durable&quot; (Industrial Science and Technologies and sustainable development, &quot;STI2D&quot;)
* &quot;sciences et technologies de laboratoire&quot; (Laboratory Science and Technologies, &quot;STL&quot;)
* &quot;sciences médico-sociales&quot; (Health and Social Sciences, &quot;SMS&quot;): The name was changed in 2007 and became: &quot;Sciences et technologies de la santé et du social&quot; (Sciences and Technologies in Health and Social, &quot;ST2S&quot;)
* &quot;sciences et technologies du produit agroalimentaire&quot; (Food Science and Technologies, &quot;STPA&quot;)
* &quot;sciences et technologies de l&#x27;agronomie et de l&#x27;environnement&quot; (Agronomy and Environment Science and Technologies, &quot;STAE&quot;)
* &quot;techniques de la musique et de la danse&quot; (Music and Dance Techniques, &quot;TMD&quot;)
* &quot;hôtellerie&quot; (Hotel and restaurants management)

The STPA and STAE stream are available only in &quot;lycées agricoles&quot;, speciality schools for agricultural sciences.

The teaching of the lessons is based on inductive reasoning and experimentation. It allows you to work or to pursue short and technical studies (laboratory, design and applied arts, hotel and restaurant, management etc.).

===Lycée professionnel===
The &quot;lycée professionnel&quot; leads to the &quot;baccalauréat professionnel&quot;. The courses are designed for students who do not plan to continue into higher education. The vocational training is for craftspeople and involves internships in commercial enterprises. The courses are suitable for students who are more interested in a hands-on educational approach than in academic schooling. There are nearly 100 specialties, including: Leather crafts; Building technician; Maintenance of industrial equipment; Cooking; Road freight transport driver; Butcher, etc and others.

== Carte scolaire ==
French parents are not free to choose the state school that their children will attend; unless the children have special learning needs, they will attend the school allocated to them by the &quot;carte scolaire&quot; (school map). Reasons for attending a state school that is not their nearest include studying an option unavailable in the school to which they were originally assigned (e.g. a rare foreign language).

For many reasons, many parents consider the allocated school standards inadequate, the teaching poor, and particularly if they do not like the idea of their children mixing with some of the other pupils at the school. In any city, there are &quot;better&quot; lycées and collèges, which parents would prefer their children attend. The two main methods used in such circumstances to get children into a school other than their assigned school are :

* paying for private schooling;
* having the child choose an unusual option (e.g. Ancient Greek or Latin) available only in the preferred school.
A similar trick is used if some classes in a school are seen as &quot;better&quot; than others. For organisational reasons, students taking certain options are grouped into special classes, which may be academically attractive. They typically include classes taking German as a first foreign language, or Latin or Ancient Greek as options.

<text>The is the common name of the western portion of the Kansai Main Line. The line is owned and operated by West Japan Railway Company (JR West). It starts at Kamo Station in Kyoto Prefecture and ends at JR Namba Station in Naniwa-ku, Osaka.

==Operations==

=== Yamatoji Rapid Service ===

: trains operate between or Nara Station and Tennoji, via a complete loop on the Osaka Loop Line. Trains divert from the Kansai Line at Shin-Imamiya Station instead of continuing to JR Namba. From Shin-Imamiya, they run on the Osaka Loop Line, making limited stops to Osaka Station, and then making every stop before completing the loop at Tennoji Station. However, some services do not complete the loop, as they terminate in Kyobashi. Trains also stop at every station east of .
:4 services are operated every hour during weekday daytime and weekend nighttime, with 2 of them operating as far as . Some weekend services operate through service to the Wakayama Line towards Takada and Gojō.
:All trains are operated using 221 series EMUs, with every of them being 8 cars.

=== Section Rapid Service ===

=== Rapid Service ===

:&quot; operate between JR Namba and either Takada on the Wakayama Line (daytime), or Nara / Kamo (morning, evening, night), with an interval of 2 trains per hour. Among the through trains towards the Wakayama Line during the evening rush, some of them are coupled with Nara-bound services before decoupling at Ōji. However there are no Namba-bound services where two trains couple at Ōji. Additionally, there are a few Namba-bound through service trains starting from Nara and detours to the Sakurai Line in the morning rush.
:Trains stop at JR Namba, Shin-Imamiya, Tennoji, , and every station after Ōji.
:During daytime, trains are operated using 4-car 221 series EMUs. During rush hours, 6-car 201 series EMUs are also used, but now there is a higher tendency that 221 series trains being used. From the timetable revision on 15 March 2008 until 11 March 2022, 3 Rapid services starting from Kashiwara (where Rapid trains normally skip) to Namba were operated.
:The operation of the &quot;Direct Rapid Service&quot; trains started on March 17, 2008, with the opening of the Osaka Higashi Line and the timetable revision on March 15, 2008. The trains are now operated between and Shin-Osaka, via the Yamatoji Line and the Osaka Higashi Line. On weekdays, 4 Shin-Osaka-bound trains are operated in the mornings, while 4 Nara-bound trains are operated in the evenings. On weekends, 2 round trips are operated both in the mornings and in the evenings. Trains stop at all stations from Nara to , , JR Kawachi-Eiwa, Takaida-Chuo, Hanaten and Shin-Osaka. Trains are operated using 207 series or 321 series EMUs from the Aboshi Depot.
:Before 16 March 2019, when the Osaka Higashi Line still had not been extended to Shin-Osaka, Direct Rapid trains operated between Nara and via the Yamatoji Line, the Osaka Higashi Line, the Katamachi Line (Gakkentoshi Line), and the JR Tōzai Line.
:&quot;Local trains&quot; stop at every station on the Yamatoji Line between Kamo and JR Namba. They are operated between Oji and JR Namba in the non-rush hour. Trains are also operated from JR Namba to Kamo and through from JR Namba to the Nara Line in the early morning.

==History==
The oldest section of the Yamatoji Line is between and , which opened on May 14, 1889. The present route was completed on August 21, 1907 when the new line between and , replacing the original route via , was opened. The name &quot;Yamatoji Line&quot; has been used since March 13, 1988, and the term “Yamatoji“ roughly translates to “Road to Yamato Province”.

Station numbering was introduced in March 2018 with the Yamatoji Line being assigned station numbers between JR-Q17 and JR-Q39 with the exception of JR-Q35 (which will be assigned to a future station between Koriyama and Nara).

<doc id="378422" wikidata="Q2346693" url="?curid=378422" title="Dirk Pitt">
<text>Dirk Pitt is a fictional character created by American novelist Clive Cussler and featured in a series of novels published from 1976 to 2021. Pitt is a larger-than-life hero reminiscent of pulp magazine icon Doc Savage. Pitt is a citizen of the United States, on loan from the United States Air Force with the rank of Major, after serving in the Vietnam War as a pilot. He manages to find adventure with his childhood best friend, Al Giordino, despite ending up with an ostensibly desk-bound role as the head of the National Underwater and Marine Agency. Pitt has a commanding presence, a quick wit, and a considerable collection of classic cars.

==Biography and career==
Dirk Eric Pitt, renowned adventurer, is the son of Senator George Pitt of California. Dirk graduates from the United States Air Force Academy and serves as a pilot in the United States Air Force during the Vietnam War. Dirk is an accomplished pilot who is qualified to fly both fixed-wing and rotary aircraft. He goes on to attain the rank of major. Over the course of his service, Pitt is awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross with two clusters, a Silver Star, a Purple Heart and many other commendations.

Dirk Pitt receives one such commendation for shooting down the plane of Admiral James Sandecker. The plane was carrying the Admiral and his staff to a remote base north of Da Nang. Unknown to them, the base was overrun by the North Vietnamese and their radio was malfunctioning, so they were unable to receive a warning. Pitt was flying nearby returning to his base from a bombing mission and was ordered to intercept and alert the admiral by whatever means available. When efforts to communicate with the Admiral&#x27;s plane were unsuccessful, Pitt expertly shot out both engines on the transport, forcing them to ditch in the sea instead of landing at the captured base. Dirk then flew cover, strafing any boats that left the shore, until everyone was taken aboard a navy patrol vessel. Cussler derived this story as well as some of Pitt&#x27;s awards from the real life World War II veteran Louis Edward Curdes.

Dirk&#x27;s service record is amended in the film versions of &quot;Raise the Titanic&quot; and &quot;Sahara&quot;, where he is said to have graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy. In both versions, Dirk graduates with his childhood best friend, Al Giordino.

After leaving the service, Dirk works as a marine engineer for the National Underwater and Marine Agency (NUMA), an oceanographic research organization headed by Admiral James Sandecker. In his career at NUMA, Dirk makes numerous shipwreck discoveries and thwarts countless plans by villains intent on global catastrophe or world domination.

In recent novels, Dirk becomes the head of NUMA, succeeding Admiral Sandecker when the latter is appointed Vice President of the United States after the sudden death in office of his predecessor. Despite his promotion, Pitt is uncomfortable with a desk job, and still heads numerous projects in the field, becoming entangled in villainous plots just as easily as before his promotion.

Dirk is 6 ft 3 in (190.5 cm) tall with craggy looks, dark wavy hair, and a rangy build. Cussler refers often to Dirk&#x27;s &quot;opaline green eyes&quot;, which can be both alluring or intimidating, as need be. Pitt has a commanding presence which, combined with a quick, sly wit, often infuriates his adversaries and superiors. Comical banter with Al is especially common during stressful situations, leaving the reader with little doubt that both are confident in their abilities.

His weapon of choice is a Colt .45-caliber M1911 semi-automatic pistol that he received from his father. His drink of choice is blue agave Tequila. Dirk believes that quality tequila should be drunk straight with salt and lime, preferring to use cheaper tequila in margaritas. He wears an orange-faced Doxa Sub 300T Professional dive watch.

=== Classic car collection ===
When Dirk Pitt is not traveling, he lives in a remodeled and refurbished hangar on the grounds of Washington National Airport, near Washington, D.C. A cast-iron stairway leads into a cluttered apartment with maps of the sea and models of ships scattered all about. The hangar houses his substantial collection of classic and antique cars, as well as a Messerschmitt Me 262 aircraft, a Ford trimotor aircraft, a Pullman railroad dining car, and a totem pole. The hangar also contains items collected from prior adventures, such as a cast-iron bathtub with an outboard motor fixed to one end, and is protected by a state-of-the-art security system. Pitt occasionally adds classic cars to his collection, purloined from a variety of antagonists over the course of his adventures. The character shares his affinity for cars with his creator, the author Clive Cussler. Relatedly, Pitt is named after Dirk Cussler, Clive&#x27;s son and sometime co-writer of the Dirk Pitt adventure stories.

== Love interests and family ==
Throughout his life, there are three women of significance: 

* Summer Moran (&quot;Pacific Vortex!, Valhalla Rising)&quot;
* Maeve Fletcher (&quot;Shock Wave&quot;)
* Loren Smith (&quot;Vixen 03, Havana Storm&quot;)

=== Summer Moran ===
Dirk first meets Summer at Royal Hawaiian Hotel, when she is trying to seduce him where Dirk feels an instant attraction to her, and later tries to assassinate him. 

She rescues Dirk Pitt from peril by swiftly severing the rope tethering his hands, deftly slipping a knife into his grasp just in time to thwart her father&#x27;s men from orchestrating his demise in his hotel room. 

Summer is the mother of his twin children, Dirk Pitt Jr. and Summer Pitt. She is often described as Pitt&#x27;s first real love. The daughter of deranged scientist Frederick Moran, she is believed dead by Pitt when she is lost during an attempt to rescue her father as his underwater lair collapses. As revealed by 23-year-old Dirk Pitt Jr. when the two meet at the end of the novel &quot;Valhalla Rising&quot;, Summer in fact survives, badly maimed by the incident, and refuses to seek him out because she wants Pitt to remember her as he knew her. She gives birth to the twins shortly thereafter and raises them, naming them after their parents.

=== Maeve Fletcher ===
Dirk meets Maeve Fletcher in &quot;Shock Wave&quot;. Like Summer, she is also the daughter of a deranged, ruthless villain. However, she refuses to have any part in her family&#x27;s dealings or with her father, the villain Arthur Dorsett. Maeve is the single mother of two children, who she raises on her salary as a tour guide aboard a cruise in the Antarctic when she and Pitt first meet. She holds a master&#x27;s degree in zoology. Maeve and Dirk pledge their deepest love for each other, but unfortunately Maeve is already fatally wounded, and she dies in Pitt&#x27;s arms.

=== Loren Smith ===
Pitt has a long-term relationship with Congresswoman Loren Smith, whom he marries before the book &quot;Havana Storm&quot;.

===Novel notes===
Although &quot;Pacific Vortex!&quot; was released in 1983, it is actually the first Dirk Pitt novel chronologically. The events of &quot;Pacific Vortex!&quot; happen before those of &quot;The Mediterranean Caper&quot;. In fact, several events in &quot;Pacific Vortex!&quot; are referred to in &quot;The Mediterranean Caper&quot;. The series does not have to be read in order, since each book stands by itself.

There is also a Dirk Pitt reference book:

* &quot;Dirk Pitt and Clive Cussler Revealed&quot; (1998) - Written with Craig Dirgo, which contains photos and a synopsis of the books, as well as a compendium of cars, characters, villains and women that have appeared in the novels throughout the years. Also, there is a biography and interview with Cussler, and a short story &quot;The Reunion&quot;, written from the perspective of a character who crashes a party at Pitt&#x27;s hangar, meeting all the characters who had been predominant in the novels up to that time. Hints dropped throughout the story indicate that this unnamed character is Cussler himself.

===Film notes===
Pitt has twice appeared on the big screen, in movie adaptations of &quot;Raise the Titanic&quot; in 1980, and &quot;Sahara&quot; in 2005. In the former he was portrayed by Richard Jordan, and in the latter by Matthew McConaughey.

Clive Cussler sued the production company for the film &quot;Sahara&quot;, Crusader, in 2004, claiming the company reneged on a contract that gave him approval rights over the film&#x27;s screenplay, when, in fact, he only had those rights until a director was hired. Crusader, which is owned by billionaire Philip Anschutz, then countersued, accusing Cussler of duping it into adapting his book into a film based on an inflated number of novels sold. Jurors ruled in May 2007 in favor of the production company. On March 10, 2009, Judge John P. Shook ordered Clive Cussler to pay $13.9 million in legal fees to Crusader. In his ruling, Judge Shook agreed with lawyers for Crusader Entertainment that an original contract between the two parties called for an award of legal fees if either side breached. &quot;The issue boils down to whether the fees requested are reasonable and necessary,&quot; Shook said. He concluded that they were. On July 27, 2009, Cussler issued a final check to Crusader, which totals the payback to $20 million to the wronged production company. A March 2010 decision by the California Court of Appeal has since overturned the earlier awardings of both the $5 million in damages and nearly $14 million in legal fees to Crusader.

The tracks from the Kansai Main Line are expected to be extended north from this station by 2031 with the completion of the Naniwasuji Line. The new line is to be routed through central Osaka and will terminate at new underground platforms at Osaka Station.

<text>Kela, abbr. from , (Fpa), (SII), is a Finnish government agency in charge of settling benefits under national social security programs. Kela was founded in 1937 to handle retirement pay. In the 1980s and 1990s, its role was expanded to handle other fields like child benefits, unemployment benefits, sickness benefits, health insurance and student financial aid.

Kela benefits are funded from three national insurance funds administered by national government: the national pension fund, the national health insurance fund, and the general social security fund. The tax authority (Vero) collects contributions to these funds from general taxation on income, charged to both employers and employees. Rates for 2021 are available on the Vero web site. Coverage under the schemes is given to all permanent residents of Finland. &quot;Kansaneläkelaitos/Folkpensionsanstalten&quot; literally means &quot;People&#x27;s Pension Institute&quot;, reflecting its original function as the national provider of retirement benefits.

== History ==
Kela was founded in 1937 during the first SDP-Agrarian coalition under Aimo Kaarlo Cajander as a means to relieve societal inequality and instability by providing a social safety net organisation.
== Directors general ==

== Incidents ==
In May 2008, a Kela e-service apparently disclosed confidential medical insurance information to the wrong client, and subsequently Kela took that service offline.

<text>Unemployment benefits, also called unemployment insurance, unemployment payment, unemployment compensation, or simply unemployment, are payments made by governmental bodies to unemployed people. Depending on the country and the status of the person, those sums may be small, covering only basic needs, or may compensate the lost time proportionally to the previous earned salary.

Unemployment benefits are generally given only to those registering as becoming unemployed through no fault of their own, and often on conditions ensuring that they seek work.

In British English, unemployment benefits are also colloquially referred to as &quot;the dole&quot;, or simply &quot;benefits&quot;; receiving benefits is informally called &quot;being on the dole&quot;. &quot;Dole&quot; here is an archaic expression meaning &quot;one&#x27;s allotted portion&quot;, from the synonymous Old English word &quot;dāl&quot;. 

In Australia and New Zealand, a &quot;dole bludger&quot; is someone on unemployment benefits who makes no effort to find work. In the United Kingdom, the equivalent word used to describe the same thing is &quot;layabout&quot; and in the United States, &quot;slacker&quot; is most commonly used to describe someone who chooses not to work for a living.
==History==

The first modern unemployment benefit scheme was introduced in the United Kingdom with the National Insurance Act 1911, under the Liberal Party government of H. H. Asquith. The popular measures were introduced to stave off poverty inflicted through unemployment, though they also gave the Liberal Party the added benefit of combatting the Labour Party&#x27;s increasing influence among the country&#x27;s working-class population. The Act gave the British working classes a contributory system of insurance against illness and unemployment. It only applied to wage earners, however, and their families and the unwaged had to rely on other sources of support, if any. Key figures in the implementation of the Act included Robert Laurie Morant and William Braithwaite.

By the time of its implementation, the benefits were criticised by Communist parties, who saw such insurance as a means to prevent workers from starting a revolution, while employers and Tories sometimes saw it as a &quot;necessary evil&quot;.

The scheme was based on actuarial principles and was funded by fixed amounts from workers, employers, and taxpayers. It was restricted to particular industries, particularly more volatile ones like shipbuilding, and did not make provision for any dependants. After one week of unemployment, a worker was eligible to receive 7/- per week for up to 15 weeks in a year. By 1913, 2,300,000 were insured under the unemployment benefit programme.

===Expansion and spread===
The Unemployment Insurance Act 1920 created the dole system of payments for unemployed workers in the United Kingdom. The dole system provided 39 weeks of unemployment benefits to over 11,000,000 workers—practically the entire civilian working population except domestic service, farmworkers, railway men, and civil servants.

Unemployment benefits were introduced in Germany in 1927, and in most European countries in the period after the Second World War; with the expansion of the welfare state. Unemployment insurance in the United States originated in Wisconsin in 1932. Through the Social Security Act of 1935, the Federal government of the United States effectively encouraged the individual states to adopt unemployment insurance plans.

==Processes==
Eligibility criteria for unemployment benefits typically factor in the applicant&#x27;s employment history and their reason for being unemployed. Once approved, there is sometimes a waiting period before being able to receive benefits. In the US, there is no waiting period on a temporary basis currently due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but in many states there is a waiting week. In Germany and Belgium, there is no waiting week. The current waiting period in Canada is seven days. Countries implement varied potential benefit durations (PBD), which is how long an individual is eligible to receive benefits. The PBD may be a sliding scale function of the applicant&#x27;s past employment history and age, or it may be a set length for all applicants. In Argentina, for example, six months of work history results in a PBD of two months, while 36 months or more of work history can result in a PBD of a full year, with an extra six months of PBD to applicants over the age of 45.

Most countries calculate the amount of unemployment benefit as a percentage of the applicant&#x27;s former income. A typical replacement percentage is 50–65%. Some countries offer much higher levels of wage replacement, such as the Netherlands (75%), Luxembourg (80%), and Denmark (90%). There are often caps on the maximum benefit level, ranging from 33% of a country&#x27;s average wage (Turkey) to 227% of its average wage (France). The average maximum benefit level is 77% among OECD countries. Most benefit payments are constant over the course of the PBD, though countries such as the Netherlands, Sweden, Hungary, Slovenia, Spain, and Italy have a declining benefit path, in which the wage replacement percentage decreases over time.

Most countries require those receiving unemployment benefits to search for a new job, and can require documentation of job search activities. Benefits may be cut if the applicant does not fulfil the search requirements, or turns down a job offer deemed acceptable by the unemployment benefits agency. Agencies may also provide resources, training, or education for job seekers. Some countries allow beneficiaries to accept part-time jobs without losing benefit eligibility, which can counter the disincentive of unemployment benefits to accepting jobs that do not fully replace the former wages.

Unemployment benefits are typically funded by payroll taxes on employers and employees. This can be supplemented by the government&#x27;s general tax revenue, which can occur periodically or in response to economic downturn. Contribution rates are usually between 1 and 3% of gross earnings, and are usually split between the employer and employee.

==Systems by country==
Across the world, 72 countries offer a form of unemployment benefits. This includes all 37 OECD countries. Among OECD countries for a hypothetical 40-year-old unemployment benefit applicant, the US and Slovakia are the least generous for potential benefit duration lengths, with PBD of six months. More generous OECD countries are Sweden (35 months PBD) and Iceland (36 months PBD); in Belgium, the PBD is indefinite.

=== Armenia ===

Armenia&#x27;s Unemployment Insurance (UI) scheme has been in force since 1991. In 2005, Armenia adopted the law on Employment of the Population and Social Protection in Case of Unemployment, which provided a legal framework to the Unemployment Insurance and active labour policies. Armenia&#x27;s UI is a contributory program, which is obligatory for public and formal private sectors, as well as the self-employed. To be eligible for benefits, the claimant must be unemployed as a result of business reorganization, staff reduction, or the termination of a collective bargaining agreement. To be eligible, applicants must have contributed for at least 12 months prior to unemployment or be actively looking for work after a long period of unemployment. The UI is also available to first-time job seekers. Those who do not qualify for the monthly payment are nonetheless eligible for the UI scheme&#x27;s capacity building programs. Those who qualify for the monthly unemployment benefit will get a payment of 18,000 AMD per month for a minimum of 6 months and a maximum of 12 months.

The UI also includes a scheme to help employers hire people who are unemployed with at least 35 years of UI contributions but have not reached retirement age; unemployed for more than three years; returning from corrective or medical institutions; returning from mandatory military service; disabled; refugees; or are 16 years of age and newly eligible to work. Employers who hire these groups are eligible for a benefit of 50% of the minimum wage to supplement the employee&#x27;s income. The UI also provides financial assistance and capacity-building programs for unemployed or disabled individuals who want to start their own businesses. Armenia also has a Paid Public Works program that provides jobseekers and the disabled with temporary public employment for three months.

===Australia===

In Australia, social security benefits, including unemployment benefits, are funded through the taxation system. There is no compulsory national unemployment insurance fund. Rather, benefits are funded in the annual Federal Budget by the National Treasury and are administrated and distributed throughout the nation by the government agency, Centrelink. Benefit rates are indexed to the Consumer Price Index and are adjusted twice a year according to inflation or deflation.

There are two types of payment available to those experiencing unemployment. The first, called Youth Allowance, is paid to young people aged 16–20 (or 15, if deemed to meet the criteria for being considered &#x27;independent&#x27; by Centrelink). Youth Allowance is also paid to full-time students aged 16–24, and to full-time Australian Apprenticeship workers aged 16–24. People aged below 18 who have not completed their high school education, are usually required to be in full-time education, undertaking an apprenticeship or doing training to be eligible for Youth Allowance. For single people under 18 years of age living with a parent or parents, the basic rate is A$91.60 per week. For over-18- to 20-year-olds living at home this increases to A$110.15 per week. For those aged 18–20 not living at home the rate is A$167.35 per week. There are special rates for those with partners and/or children.

The second kind of payment is called &#x27;JobSeeker Payment&#x27; (called Newstart until 20 June 2020) and is paid to unemployed people over the age of 21 and under the pension eligibility age. To receive a JobSeeker Payment, recipients must be unemployed, be prepared to enter into an Employment Pathway Plan (previously called an Activity Agreement) by which they agree to undertake certain activities to increase their opportunities for employment, be Australian Residents and satisfy the income test (which limits weekly income to A$32 per week before benefits begin to reduce, until one&#x27;s income reaches A$397.42 per week at which point no unemployment benefits are paid) and the assets test (an eligible recipient can have assets of up to A$161,500 if he or she owns a home before the allowance begins to reduce and $278,500 if he or she does do not own a home). The rate of allowance as of 12 January 2010 for single people without children was A$228 per week, paid fortnightly. (This does not include supplemental payments such as Rent Assistance or Energy Supplement.) Different rates apply to people with partners and/or children.

Effectively, people have had to survive on $39 a day since 1994, and there have been calls to raise this by politicians and NGO groups. On 22 February 2021, the Prime Minister of Australia, Scott Morrison, announced that the JobSeeker base rate would be increased by A$50 a fortnight from April 2021. It is also intended to increase the threshold amount recipients can earn before their payment starts to be reduced.

The system in Australia is designed to support recipients no matter how long they have been unemployed. In recent years the former Coalition government under John Howard has increased the requirements of the Activity Agreement, providing for controversial schemes such as Work for the Dole, which requires that people on benefits for six months or longer work voluntarily for a community organisation regardless of whether such work increases their skills or job prospects. Since the Labor government under Kevin Rudd was elected in 2008, the length of unemployment before one is required to fulfill the requirements of the Activity Agreement (renamed the Employment Pathway Plan) has increased from six to 12 months. There are other options available as alternatives to the Work for the Dole scheme, such as undertaking part-time work or study and training, the basic premise of the Employment Pathway Plan being to keep the welfare recipient active and involved in seeking full-time work.

For people renting their accommodation, unemployment benefits are supplemented by Rent Assistance, which, for single people as at 20 September 2021, begins to be paid when fortnightly rent is more than A$124.60. Rent Assistance is paid as a proportion of total rent paid (75 cents per dollar paid over A$124.60 up to the maximum). The maximum amount of rent assistance payable is A$139.60 per fortnight, and is paid when the total weekly rent exceeds A$310.73 per fortnight. Different rates apply to people with partners and/or children, or who are sharing accommodation.

===Canada===
In Canada, the system is known as &quot;Employment Insurance&quot; (EI, ). Formerly called &quot;Unemployment Insurance&quot;, the name was changed in 1996. In 2024, Canadian workers paid premiums of 1.66% of insured earnings in return for benefits if they lose their jobs.

The Employment and Social Insurance Act was passed in 1935 during the Great Depression by the government of R. B. Bennett as an attempted Canadian unemployment insurance program. It was, however, ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of Canada as unemployment was judged to be an insurance matter falling under provincial responsibility. After a constitutional amendment was agreed to by all of the provinces, a reference to &quot;Unemployment Insurance&quot; was added to the matters falling under federal authority under the Constitution Act, 1867, and the first Canadian system was adopted in 1940. Because of these problems Canada was the last major Western country to bring in an employment insurance system. It was extended dramatically by Pierre Trudeau in 1971 making it much easier to get. The system was sometimes called the 10/42, because one had to work for 10 weeks to get benefits for the other 42 weeks of the year. It was also in 1971 that the UI program was first opened up to maternity and sickness benefits, for 15 weeks in each case.

The generosity of the Canadian UI program was progressively reduced after the adoption of the 1971 UI Act. At the same time, the federal government gradually reduced its financial contribution, eliminating it entirely by 1990. The EI system was again cut by the Progressive Conservatives in 1990 and 1993, then by the Liberals in 1994 and 1996. Amendments made it harder to qualify by increasing the time needed to be worked, although seasonal claimants (who work long hours over short periods) turned out to gain from the replacement, in 1996, of weeks by hours to qualify. The ratio of beneficiaries to unemployed, after having stood at around 40% for many years, rose somewhat during the 2009 recession but then fell back again to the low 40s. Some unemployed persons are not covered for benefits (e.g. self-employed workers), while others may have exhausted their benefits, did not work long enough to qualify, or quit or were dismissed from their job. The length of time one could take EI has also been cut repeatedly. The 1994 and 1996 changes contributed to a sharp fall in Liberal support in the Atlantic provinces in the 1997 election.

In 2001, the federal government increased parental leave from 10 to 35 weeks, which was added to preexisting maternity benefits of 15 weeks. In 2004, it allowed workers to take EI for compassionate care leave while caring for a dying relative, although the strict conditions imposed make this a little used benefit. In 2006, the Province of Quebec opted out of the federal EI scheme in respect of maternity, parental and adoption benefits, in order to provide more generous benefits for all workers in that province, including self-employed workers. Total EI spending was $19.677 billion for 2011–2012 (figures in Canadian dollars).

Employers contribute 1.4 times the amount of employee premiums. Since 1990, there is no government contribution to this fund. The amount a person receives and how long they can stay on EI varies with their previous salary, how long they were working, and the unemployment rate in their area. The EI system is managed by Service Canada, a service delivery network reporting to the Minister of Employment and Social Development Canada.

A bit over half of EI benefits are paid in Ontario and the Western provinces but EI is especially important in the Atlantic provinces, which have higher rates of unemployment. Many Atlantic workers are also employed in seasonal work such as fishing, forestry or tourism and go on EI over the winter when there is no work. There are special rules for fishermen making it easier for them to collect EI. EI also pays for maternity and parental leave, compassionate care leave, and illness coverage. The program also pays for retraining programs (EI Part II) through labour market agreements with the Canadian provinces.

A significant part of the federal fiscal surplus of the Jean Chrétien and Paul Martin years came from the EI system. Premiums were reduced much less than falling expenditures – producing, from 1994 onwards, EI surpluses of several billion dollars per year, which were added to general government revenue. The cumulative EI surplus stood at $57 billion at 31 March 2008, nearly four times the amount needed to cover the extra costs paid during a recession. This drew criticism from Opposition parties and from business and labour groups, and has remained a recurring issue of the public debate. The Conservative Party, chose not to recognize those EI surpluses after being elected in 2006. Instead, the Conservative government cancelled the EI surpluses entirely in 2010, and required EI contributors to make up the 2009, 2010 and 2011 annual deficits by increasing EI premiums. On 11 December 2008, the Supreme Court of Canada rejected a court challenge launched against the federal government by two Quebec unions, who argued that EI funds had been misappropriated by the government.

===China===
The level of benefit is set between the minimum wage and the minimum living allowance by individual provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities.

===Denmark===
===European Union===

Each Member State of the European Union has its own system and, in general, a worker should claim unemployment benefits in the country where they last worked. For a person working in a country other than their country of residency (a cross-border worker), they will have to claim benefits in their country of residence.

===Finland===
Two systems run in parallel, combining a Ghent system and a minimum level of support provided by Kela, an agency of the national government. Unionization rates are high (70%), and union membership comes with membership in an unemployment fund. Additionally, there are non-union unemployment funds. Usually, benefits require 26 weeks of 18 hours per week on average, and the unemployment benefit is 60% of the salary and lasts for 500 days. When this is not available, Kela can pay either regular unemployment benefit or labour market subsidy benefits. The former requires a degree and two years of full-time work. The latter requires participation in training, education, or other employment support, which may be mandated on pain of losing the benefit, but may be paid after the regular benefits have been either maxed out or not available. Although the unemployment funds handle the payments, most of the funding is from taxes and compulsory tax-like unemployment insurance charges.

Regardless of whether benefits are paid by Kela or from an unemployment fund, the unemployed person receives assistance from the &quot;Työ- ja elinkeinokeskus&quot; (&quot;TE-keskus&quot;, or the &quot;Work and Livelihood Centre&quot;), a government agency which helps people to find jobs and employers to find workers. In order to be considered unemployed, the seeker must register at the TE-keskus as unemployed. If the jobseeker does not have degree, the agency can require the job seeker to apply to a school.

If the individual does not qualify for any unemployment benefit he may still be eligible for the housing benefit (&quot;asumistuki&quot;) from Kela and municipal social welfare provisions (&quot;toimeentulotuki&quot;). They are not unemployment benefits and depend on household income, but they have in practice become the basic income of many long-term unemployed.

===France===

France uses a quasi Ghent system, under which unemployment benefits are distributed by an independent agency (UNEDIC) in which unions and Employer organisations are equally represented. UNEDIC is responsible for 3 benefits: ARE, ACA and ASR The main ARE scheme requires a minimum of 122 days membership in the preceding 24 months and certain other requirements before any claims can be made. Employers pay a contribution on top of the pre-tax income of their employees, which together with the employee contribution, fund the scheme.

The maximum unemployment benefit is (as of March 2009) 57.4% of €162 per day (Social security contributions ceiling in 2011), or €6900 per month. Claimants receive 57,4% of their average daily salary of the last 12 months preceding unemployment with the average amount being €1,111 per month. In France, tax and other payroll taxes are paid on unemployment benefits. In 2011, claimants received the allowance for an average 291 days.

===Germany===
Germany has a two-tiered system of unemployment benefits.
Their common goal is to eventually cease dependence on unemployment benefits entirely.
Both programs assist their beneficiaries to varying degrees through
* a living allowance,
* help in finding work or training, and
* if necessary, getting state-funded training.

====Type I unemployment benefits====
Type I unemployment benefits (&quot;Arbeitslosengeld I&quot;) is the first-tier program supporting unemployed people.
It is designed like an insurance, involuntary unemployment through no personal fault being the &quot;event of damage&quot;.
It is therefore also known as unemployment insurance ().

In order to qualify, the unemployed person
* must have made contributions for at least 12 months in the past 30-month period,
* be unemployed, and
* be able to work now or at least in the foreseeable future.

All workers with a regular employment contract (), except freelancers and certain civil servants (), contribute to the system.
It is financed by contributions from employees &quot;and&quot; employers.
This is in stark contrast to FUTA in the US and other systems, where only employers make contributions.
Participation (and thus contributions) are generally mandatory for both employees and employers.

Employees pay 1.5% of their gross salary below the social security threshold and employers pay 1.5% contribution on top of the salary paid to the employee.
The contribution level was reduced from 3.25% for employees and employers as part of labour market reforms known as Hartz.
Contributions are paid only on earnings up to the social security ceiling (2012: 5,600 EUR).
Furthermore, the system is supported by funds from the federal budget.

Claimants get 60% of their previous net salary (capped at the social security ceiling), or 67% for claimants with children (as long as beneficiary of child benefit).
The maximum benefit is therefore €2964 (in 2012).
If the benefits fall below the poverty line it is possible to &quot;supplement&quot; type I unemployment benefits with type II benefits if its conditions are met as well.

Type I unemployment benefits are only granted for a &quot;limited&quot; period of time, the minimum being 6 months, with a maximum of 24 months in the case of old and long-term insured people.
This takes account for the difficulty older people face when re-entering the job market in Germany.

In contrast to type II unemployment benefits, there is no means test.
However, it is necessary to remain unemployed while seeking employment.
In this context unemployment is defined as working less than 15 hours a week.

====Type II unemployment benefits====

Type II unemployment benefits (, also referred to as &quot;Hartz IV&quot; or &quot;Bürgergeld&quot; colloquially) are an open-ended welfare program intended to ensure people do not fall into poverty.

* In order to be eligible, a person has to permanently reside in Germany, be in possession of a work permit, and be fit for work, i.e. can principally work at least three hours a day. The goal of the program is to terminate one&#x27;s dependence on it (welfare-to-work). It is not a Universal Basic Income.
* The benefits are subordinated, that means:
** A person may not eligible for other programmes, especially type I unemployment benefits and pension, but also other legal claims – e.g. dependence on parents, or accounts receivable – can not come to fruition.
** The person has to be in need (means test): He can not afford a minimum standard living by all incomes in total, or by expending his own previously accumulated assets, e.g. by selling real estate not required or adequate for a bare minimum lifestyle. In the course of the SARS-CoV‑2 pandemic these harsh standards have temporarily been reduced to a mere sanity check to avoid undue hardship.

Despite its name, unemployment is not a requirement.
Due to wage dumping and other labour market dynamics, a large number of &quot;working&quot; beneficiaries &quot;supplement&quot; their monthly income.
They have the same obligations as non-working beneficiaries.

People receiving benefits are obligated to cease their eligibility at all costs, but at least &quot;minimise&quot; their dependence on welfare until no money would be paid.
That means, they are obliged to seek for jobs nationwide, and accept &quot;every&quot; job offered, otherwise sanctions (retrenchment) may be applied.
There is no recognition of professional qualifications:
An academic has to join the menial workforce, regardless of the fact that their potential might be wasted in that industry.
Neither are one&#x27;s personal religious or ethical concerns relevant:
Prostitution is legal in Germany (although as of 2021 no job centre has urged any beneficiary to engage in prostitution).

In exchange for that, beneficiaries are assisted in that process, e.g. by reimbursing travel expenses to interviews, receiving (free of charge) training in order to increase their chances on the labour market, or subsidising moving expenses once an employment contract has been signed but the place of work requires relocation as it is further than the acceptable daily commute duration (at most 3 hrs a day).
If they do not voluntarily participate in training, they may be obliged by administrative action.
Beneficiaries not complying with orders can be sanctioned by pruning their allowance and eventually revoking the grant altogether, virtually pushing them into poverty, homelessness and bankruptcy, as there are no other precautions installed.

Germany does not have an EBT (electronic benefits transfer) card system in place and, instead, disburses welfare in cash or via direct deposit into the recipient&#x27;s bank account.
As of 2022 a single person without children receives at most €449 per month at free disposal intended to cover living expenses, plus costs for reasonable accommodation (rent and heating).
People granted benefits are automatically insured at reduced rates in the national health and nursing care insurances.
The national pension insurance accounts the time living on benefits, but it does not increase the pension entitlement since in 2011 the federal government stopped paying €205 monthly.

Type II unemployment benefits have been heavily criticized since their introduction.
As Type II benefits are meant to ensure a minimum subsistence level, the mechanism of sanctions has repeatedly been a subject in cases before the Federal Constitutional Court.
The possibility of sanctions cutting someone&#x27;s benefits to zero was declared unconstitutional in 2018.
In July 2022 Germany&#x27;s government implemented a one-year moratorium on sanctions, permitting only a 10% cut for repeatedly missing appointments ().
This measure was taken as a precursor to restructuring type II unemployment benefits into a citizen&#x27;s dividend ().

===Greece===
Unemployment benefits in Greece are administered through OAED (, Manpower Employment Organization) and are available only to laid-off salaried workers with full employment and social security payments during the previous two years. The self-employed do not qualify, and neither do those with other sources of income. The monthly benefit is fixed at the &quot;55% of 25 minimum daily wages&quot;, and is currently €360 per month, with a 10% increase for each under-age child. Recipients are eligible for at most 12 months; the exact duration depends on the collected number of , that is social security payment coupons-stamps collected (i.e. days of work) during the 14 months before being laid off; the minimum number of such coupons, under which there is no eligibility, is 125, collected in the first 12 of the 14 aforementioned months. Eligibility since 1 January 2013, has been further constrained in that one applying for unemployment benefits for a second or more time, must not have received more than the equivalent of 450 days of such benefits during the last four years since the last time one had started receiving such benefits; if one has received unemployment benefits in this period for more than 450 days then there is no eligibility while if one has received less, then one is only eligible for at most the remaining days up until the maximum of 450 days is reached.

In terms of an unemployment allowance, Greece allows for those found in unemployment, who are employed through an independent profession, to receive benefits if their latest paycheck had not exceeded a certain amount, the current rate should not exceed €1,467.35. When receiving benefits an individual cannot be earning money from a self-employed profession. If the income increases the fixed amount, a tax authority must issue a certificate that explains that the individual has &quot;interrupted the exercise of the profession&quot;, which must be done within 15 days. Unemployment benefits are also granted to those who have generated an income that does not exceed €1,467.35 from the final paycheck received from a liberal profession. In order to receive a grant, the individual must not be receiving an income from the previous liberal profession. Seasonal aid is also provided to workers whose jobs cannot be performed through the entire year are also provided benefits by the OAED.

Under the OAED, individuals who are benefiting from long-term unemployment must be within the ages of 20 to 66 years of age and have a family income that does not exceed €10,000 annually. An individual becomes eligible for long-term benefits if the regular unemployment subsidy is exhausted after 12 months. After the expiration of the 12-month period, an application towards long-term unemployment benefits must be submitted in the first 2 months. If an unemployed person seeks long term unemployment and has a child, the allowance is allowed to increase by €586.08 (per child). Long-term unemployment can only be granted if the individual can be found registered under the OAED unemployment registrar.

===Iceland===
To receive unemployment benefits in Iceland, one must submit an application to the Directorate of Labour (&quot;Vinnumálastofnun&quot;) and meet a specific criteria set forth by the department. Icelandic employment rates have traditionally been higher than every other OECD country. In the most recent financial quarter, 85.8% of the Icelandic working-age population were employed, with only 2.8% of the population unemployed. When broken down by age group, Iceland&#x27;s labour force is highly active, with 74.9% of the population between the ages of 15 and 24 years old and 89.4% of people between the ages of 25 and 55 years old active in the labour market. This low rate of unemployment is attributed to the adoption of the Ghent system, which has been adopted by the countries of Denmark, Finland and Sweden, and highly emphasizes trade and labour unions to provide unemployment benefits and protections to workers, which ultimately has led to higher union membership than other capitalist economies. The safety net that these unions provide also leads to more stable job retention and less reliance on part-time employment. Only 11.9% of the working population is dependent on temporary employment.

Unlike purely social-democratic states in Europe, the Nordic model that Iceland adopted borrows aspects of both a social-democratic and liberal-welfare state. Iceland not only sees high government involvement in providing social welfare and amenities as with the social-democratic model, but like the liberal-welfare model, it is also heavily reliant on free trade and markets. The country relies on an open capitalistic market for economic growth, yet also embraces a corporatist system that allows for wage bargaining to occur between the labour force and employers in order to protect workers and ensure provisions like unemployment benefits are ensured. Currently, the legislation that ensures these benefits is The Act on Trade Unions and Industrial Disputes, which was adopted in 1938 and has been amended five times since its inception to adjust to the rise of globalization. In Section 1, Articles 1–13 grant trade unions the right to organize and negotiate with employers over fair wages for its members as well as representation for their members in the event of workplace conflicts. These rights for organized unions set forth by the Ministry of Welfare not only provide the country&#x27;s labour force fair and equal representation within their respective industries, but also allow for these organizations to maintain an active relationship with the Icelandic government to discuss economic issues, promote labour and social equality, and ensure benefits for unemployed labourers, as these unions are highly centralized and not politically affiliated.

Unemployment benefits in Iceland (&quot;atvinnuleysisbætur&quot;) can involve up to 100% reimbursement per month for wage earners for a maximum of 30 months. However, these rates of reimbursement are determined by previous status of employment, such as whether an individual is a wage-earner or is self-employed, as well as meeting certain mandates such as being a current resident of Iceland, be actively searching for employment, and retaining a 25% position for three months within the past 12 months before filing for unemployment. Unemployed workers can be compensated through either basic or income-linked benefits. Basic unemployment benefits can cover both wage-earning and self-employing individuals for the first half-month (10 days) after they lose their job, whereas income-linked benefits can cover wage-earning and self-employing individuals for up to three months based on a set salary index and length of employment. However, those who are unemployed must report to the Directorate of Labour once a month to reaffirm their status of unemployment and that they are actively searching for employment or unemployment benefits could be revoked. Under the Icelandic Labour Law, employees must be given a notice period of termination that can range from 12 days to six months and is determined by the length of previous employment under the same employer.

===Ireland===
People aged 18 and over and who are unemployed in Ireland can apply for either the Jobseeker&#x27;s Allowance (&quot;Liúntas do Lucht Cuardaigh Fostaíochta&quot;) or the Jobseeker&#x27;s Benefit (&quot;Sochar do Lucht Cuardaigh Fostaíochta&quot;). Both are paid by the Department of Social Protection and are nicknamed &quot;the dole&quot;.

Unemployment benefit in Ireland can be claimed indefinitely for as long as the individual remains unemployed. The standard payment is €203 per week for those aged 26 and over. For those aged 18 to 24 the rate is €112.70 per week. For those aged 25 the weekly rate is €157.80. Payments can be increased if the unemployed has dependents. For each adult dependent, another €134.70 is added, €112.70 if the recipient (as opposed to the dependent) is aged 18 to 24, and for each child dependent €34 or €37 is added, depending on the child&#x27;s age.

There are more benefits available to unemployed people, usually on a special or specific basis. Benefits include the &quot;Housing Assistance Payment&quot;, and the &quot;Fuel Allowance&quot;, among others. People on a low income (which includes those on JA/JB) are entitled to a Medical Card (although this must be applied for separately from the Health Service Executive) which provides free health care, optical care, limited dental care, aural care and subsidised prescription drugs carrying a €2.00 per item charge to a maximum monthly contribution of €25 per household (as opposed to subsidised services like non medical-card holders).

To qualify for Jobseekers Allowance, claimants must satisfy the &quot;Habitual Residence Condition&quot;: they must have been legally in the state (or the Common Travel Area) for two years or have another good reason (such as lived abroad and are returning to Ireland after becoming unemployed or deported). This condition does not apply to Jobseekers Benefit (which is based on Social Insurance payments).

More information on each benefit can be found here:

===India===

India follows a social insurance system for unemployment benefits much like its European counterparts. Unemployment allowance is given to workers in India who have contributed to the Employees&#x27; State Insurance for at least three years. The benefit is given for a maximum of one year and is either 50% of the average daily wage or Rs 35,000 a month, whichever is lower.

===Israel===

In Israel, unemployment benefits are paid by Bituah Leumi (National Insurance Institute), to which workers must pay contributions. Eligible workers must immediately register with the Employment Service Bureau upon losing their jobs or jeopardize their eligibility, and the unemployment period is considered to start upon registration with the Employment Service Bureau. To be eligible for unemployment benefits, a person must be at least 20 years old, have been previously employed, and completed a &quot;qualifying period&quot; of work for which unemployment insurance contributions were paid which varies between 300 and 360 days. Employees who were involuntarily terminated from their jobs or who terminated their own employment and can provide evidence of having done so for a justified reason are eligible for immediately receiving unemployment benefits, while those who are deemed to have terminated their employment of their own volition with no justified reason will only begin receiving unemployment benefits 90 days from the start of their unemployment period.

Unemployment benefits are paid daily, with the amount calculated based on the employee&#x27;s previous income over the past six months, but not exceeding the daily average wage for the first 125 days of payment and two-thirds of the daily average wage from the 126th day onwards. During the unemployment period, the Employment Service Bureau assists in helping locate suitable work and job training, and regularly reporting to the Employment Service Bureau is a condition for continuing to receive unemployment benefits. A person who was offered suitable work or training by the Employment Service Bureau but refused will only receive unemployment benefits 90 days after the date of the refusal, and 30 days&#x27; worth of unemployment benefits will be deducted for each subsequent refusal.

Members of kibbutzim and moshavim are typically not covered by the national unemployment system and are covered by the community&#x27;s own social welfare system, unless they are employed outside of their community or directly by the community.

Employees deemed to have been terminated from their jobs without legitimate cause are also legally entitled to severance pay from their employers, equivalent of one month&#x27;s pay for each year that the unemployed individual had worked for his or her previous employer.

Unions are also involved with the unemployment system in Israel. One such union group is the Histadrut which is commonly known as the General Organization of Workers in Israel. One of the Histadrut&#x27;s main objectives is to creates job assistance programs to help unemployed workers back into the workforce. Dr. Roby Nathanson, a doctor in economics at the University of Köl, believes these job replacement programs are successful due to the job unemployment rate in Israel. The unemployment rate in Israel in 2009 had been 9.5% and has since dropped to around 4% in 2018.

In addition, there are unemployment benefits for new immigrants who have not yet been able to find employment or who are receiving below minimum wage pay. The time period that they are qualified to receive unemployment benefits is during the first 12 months following their immigration to Israel. They are entitled to support from Havtachat Hachnasa, which is income support that is allocated from National Insurance.

===Italy===

Unemployment benefits in Italy consist mainly of cash transfers based on contributions (&quot;Assicurazione Sociale per l&#x27;Impiego, ASPI&quot;), up to the 75% of the previous wages for up to sixteen months. Other measures are:
* Redundancy Fund (&quot;Cassa integrazione guadagni&quot;, or CIG): cash benefits provided as shock absorbers to those workers who are suspended or who work only for reduced time due to temporary difficulties of their factories, aiming to help the factories in financial difficulties, by relieving them from the costs of unused workforce
* Solidarity Contracts (&quot;Contratti di solidarietà&quot;): in the same cases granting CIG benefits, companies can sign contracts with reduced work time, to avoid dismissing redundancy workers. The state will grant to those workers the 60% of the lost part of the wage.
* Mobility allowances (&quot;Indennità di mobilità&quot;): if the Redundancy Fund does not allow the company to re-establish a good financial situation, the workers can be entitled to mobility allowances. Other companies are provided incentives for employing them. This measure has been abolished in 2012 and will stop working in 2017.
*Citizens&#x27; income (&quot;reddito di cittadinanza&quot;): it is a social welfare system created in Italy in January 2019. Although its name recalls one of a universal basic income, this provision is actually a form of conditional and non-individual guaranteed minimum income.
In the Italian unemployment insurance system all the measures are income-related, and they have an average decommodification level. The basis for entitlement is always employment, with more specific conditions for each case, and the provider is quite always the state. An interesting feature worthy to be discussed is that the Italian system takes in consideration also the economic situation of the employers, and aims as well at relieving them from the costs of crisis.

===Japan===

Unemployment benefits in Japan are called &quot;unemployment insurance&quot; and are closer to the US or Canadian &quot;user pays&quot; system than the taxpayer funded systems in place in countries such as Britain, New Zealand or Australia. It is paid for by contributions by both the employer and employee.

On leaving a job, employees are supposed to be given a &quot;Rishoku-hyo&quot; document showing their ID number (the same number is supposed to be used by later employers), employment periods, and pay (which contributions are linked to). The reason for leaving is also documented separately. These items affect eligibility, timing, and amount of benefits. The length of time that unemployed workers can receive benefits depends on the age of the employee, and how long they have been employed and paying in.

It is supposed to be compulsory for most full-time employees. If they have been enrolled for at least 6 months and are fired or made redundant, leave the company at the end of their contract, or their contract is non-renewed, the now-unemployed worker will receive unemployment insurance. If a worker quit of their own accord they may have to wait between one and three months before receiving any payment.

===Mexico===
Mexico lacks a national unemployment insurance system, but it does have five programs to assist the unemployed:

* Mexico City Unemployment Benefit Scheme – The only unemployment insurance system based on worker contributions exists in Mexico City. Unemployed residents of Mexico City who are at least 18 years of age, have worked for at least six months, have no income, and are actively seeking work are eligible for unemployment benefits for up to six months, which are composed of payments of 30 days&#x27; worth of minimum wage per month.
* Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) – This institution insures workers in the formal sector, providing pensions and health insurance. Workers insured by the IMSS who are unemployed may withdraw a maximum of 30 days&#x27; worth of pension savings every five years. However, this does not cover the majority of workers, as 58% of the labour force is in the informal sector.
* National Employment Service – This agency, which has 165 offices nationwide, offers financial support in learning new skills to those aged 16 and above who are unemployed or underemployed, and assistance in finding new jobs in the form of information on vacancies and job fairs.
* Temporary Employment Program – This scheme is designed to aid unemployed people who live in rural areas with high unemployment rates, any area undergoing a financial crisis, or an area that has been hit by a natural disaster or some other kind of emergency. The program funds projects to boost employment by hiring local workers aged 16 and above in jobs such as building infrastructure and promoting development, and conserving the environment and cultural heritage sites. They are paid a salary at 99% of the local minimum wage for a maximum of 132 days a year.
* Income Generating Options Program – People living in poverty in an area of up to a maximum of 15,000 inhabitants are eligible for funding for projects to generate income for themselves.

===Netherlands===
Unemployment benefits in the Netherlands were introduced in 1949. Separate schemes exist for mainland Netherlands and for the Caribbean Netherlands.

The scheme in mainland Netherlands entails that, according to the Werkloosheidswet (Unemployment Law, WW), employers are responsible for paying the contributions to the scheme, which are deducted from the salary received by the employees. In 2012 the contribution was 4.55% of gross salary up to a ceiling of €4,172 per month. The first €1,435.75 of an employee&#x27;s gross salaries are not subject to the 4.55% contribution.

Benefits are paid for a maximum period of 24 months and claimants get 75% of last salary for 2 months and 70% thereafter with a maximum benefit of €3128, depending on how long the claimant has been employed previously. Workers older than 50 years who are unemployed for over 2 months are entitled to a special benefit called the IOAW, if they do not receive the regular unemployment benefit (WW).

===New Zealand===

In New Zealand, Jobseeker Support, previously known as the Unemployment Benefit and also known as &quot;the dole&quot; provides income support for people who are looking for work or training for work. It is one of a number of benefits administered by Work and Income, a service of the Ministry of Social Development.

To get this benefit, a person must meet the conditions and obligations specified in section 88A to 123D Social Security Act 1964. These conditions and obligations cover things such as age, residency status, and availability to work.

The amount that is paid depends on things such as the person&#x27;s age, income, marital status and whether they have children. It is adjusted annually on 1 April and in response to changes in legislature. Some examples of the maximum after tax weekly rate at 1 April 2019 are:
* NZ$200.80 For a single person aged 20–24 years without children
* NZ$210.13 for a single person 25 years or over
* NZ$325.98 for a sole parent
* NZ$350.20 for a married, de facto or civil union couple with or without children (NZ$167.83 each).
*Plus winter payments of extra NZ$20 a week

More information about this benefit and the amounts paid are on the Work and Income website.

===Philippines===

In the Philippines, workers in the private sector who involuntarily became unemployed, including housemaids and Overseas Filipino Workers, are entitled to benefits through the Social Security Act of 2018. Unemployment benefits is sourced from the country&#x27;s Social Security System (SSS). Under the 2018 legislation, the benefits are dispensed through a one-time payment to equal to 50 percent of the claimant&#x27;s monthly salary for a maximum of two months. Those who were terminated due to certain reasons such as grave misconduct, gross negligence, and commission of a crime are ineligible to avail unemployment benefits.

For government workers, unemployment benefits are sourced from the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS). Payments are equal to 50 percent of the claimant&#x27;s average monthly compensation and are dispensed monthly for two to six months, depending on the claimant&#x27;s length of service.

===Poland===

In Poland, the system is designed to prevent people from living off unemployment benefits long term, thus forcing them to work or rely on non-state means of support (family, charities). In order to claim any state unemployment support, an adult (18+) claimant has to prove at least one year of continuous, full employment (that is, minimum 40 hours a week/160 hours a month) in the last 18 months prior to registering with the Unemployment Agency. If approved, as of 2019, one is granted 848 zł (equivalent to US$224.25 in April 2019) on a month-to-month basis for the first three months, then the amount is automatically lowered to 666 zł (US$176.20 in April 2019) for the remaining 3–9 months. Therefore, if approved, one can claim unemployment benefits only to the maximum of 12 continuous months. However, during that period, one has to cooperate with the Unemployment Bureau in finding an employment under the strict guidelines of losing the unemployed status, and thus the benefits. In comparison to the unemployment benefits paid by the state, as of January 2019, the minimum monthly pay is 2250,00 zł (US$595.51 in April 2019) .
===Russia===
The least possible Unemployment Allowance is 1500 roubles per month for an unemployed person (appr. US$15,15) and may be paid during 3—6 months. Any person who hasn&#x27;t worked during the last 12 months, may be granted such minimal allowance for a 3-months period yearly.

===Spain===

The Spanish unemployment benefits system is part of the Social security system of Spain. Benefits are managed by the State Public Employment Agency (SEPE). The basis for entitlement is having contributed for a minimum period during the time preceding unemployment, with further conditions that may be applicable. The system comprises contributory benefits and non-contributory benefits.

Contributory benefits are payable to those unemployed persons with a minimum of 12 months&#x27; contributions over a period of six years preceding unemployment. The benefit is payable for 1/3 of the contribution period. The benefit amount is 70% of the legal reference salary plus additional amounts for persons with dependants. The benefit reduces to 60% of the reference salary after six months. The minimum benefit is €497 per month and the maximum is €1087.20 per month for a single person. The non-contributory allowance is available to those persons who are no longer entitled to the contributory pension and who do not have income above 75% of the national minimum wage.

===Sweden===

Sweden uses the Ghent system, under which a significant proportion of unemployment benefits are distributed by union unemployment funds. Unemployment benefits are divided into a voluntary scheme with income related compensation up to a certain level and a comprehensive scheme that provides a lower level of basic support. The voluntary scheme requires a minimum of 12 months membership and 6 months employment during that time before any claims can be made. Employers pay a fee on top of the pre-tax income of their employees, which together with membership fees, fund the scheme (see Unemployment funds in Sweden).

The maximum unemployment benefit is (as of July 2016) SEK 980 per day. During the first 200 days, the unemployed will receive 80% of his or her normal income during the last 12 months. From day 201–300 this goes down to 70% and from day 301–450 the insurance covers 65% of the normal income (only available for parents to children under the age of 18). In Sweden tax is paid on unemployment benefits, so the unemployed will get a maximum of about SEK 10,000 per month during the first 100 days (depending on the municipality tax rate). In other currencies, as of June 2017, this means a maximum of approximately £900, US$1,150, or €1,000, each month after tax. Private insurance is also available, mainly through professional organisations, to provide income-related compensation that otherwise exceeds the ceiling of the scheme. The comprehensive scheme is funded by tax.

===Saudi Arabia===
Saudi Arabia is an economic welfare state with free medical care and unemployment benefits. However, the country relies not on taxation but mainly oil revenues to maintain the social and economic services to its populace.

Payment:
2000 SAR (US$534) for 12 months for an unemployed person aged 18–35.

===Turkey===
By law, legally employed workers, regardless of their citizenship are eligible for unemployment benefits given that they are at least 18 years old, the employees contribute 1% to unemployment funds while the employers contribute 2%, and the workers are eligible to receive benefits after 600 days of contributions within the preceding 3 years of employment. the benefit payment is 50% for the average daily earnings based on the last 4 months and cannot be higher than the minimum wage (per industry). Benefits may be paid for a max of 1,080 days depending on the number of contributions. Some are skeptical of how well the system is functioning in Turkey

===United Kingdom===
Unemployment benefit is paid in the United Kingdom either as Jobseeker&#x27;s Allowance or (for most people) as an element of Universal Credit.

====Jobseeker&#x27;s Allowance rates====
Jobseeker&#x27;s Allowance (JSA) is changed annually; for the 2020/2021 tax year (commencing 6 April 2020) the maximum payable is £74.35 per week for a single person aged over 25 or £58.90 per week for a single person aged 18–24. The rules for couples where both are unemployed are more complex, but a maximum of £116.80 per week is payable, dependent on age and other factors. For those who are still getting Income-based JSA or are getting Universal Credit, and having savings of over £6,000, there is a reduction of £1 per week per £250 of savings up to £16,000. People with savings of over £16,000 are not able to get Income-based JSA or Universal Credit at all. The system previously provided rent payments as part of a separate scheme called Housing Benefit, but for most new claimants this benefit is now instead paid as an element of the comprehensive Universal Credit scheme.

===United States===
In the United States, there are 50 state unemployment insurance programs plus one each in the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and United States Virgin Islands. Though policies vary by state, unemployment benefits generally pay eligible workers as high as US$1,015 in Massachusetts to a low as US$235 per week maximum in Mississippi. Eligibility requirements for unemployment insurance vary by state, but generally speaking, employees not fired for misconduct (&quot;terminated for cause&quot;) are eligible for unemployment benefits, while those who quit or who are fired for misconduct (this sometimes can include misconduct committed outside the workplace, such as a problematic social media post or committing a crime) are not. Though the participation rate varies by state from below 10% to above 60%, nationwide only 29% of unemployed Americans (those seeking work) received unemployment benefits.

==Economic rationale and issues==
The economic argument for unemployment insurance comes from the principle of adverse selection. One common criticism of unemployment insurance is that it induces moral hazard, the fact that unemployment insurance lowers on-the-job effort and reduces job-search effort.

===Macroeconomic function===
To Keynesians, unemployment insurance acts as an automatic stabilizer. Benefits automatically increase when unemployment is high and fall when unemployment is low, smoothing the business cycle; however, others claim that the taxation necessary to support this system serves to decrease employment.

===Adverse selection===

Adverse selection refers to the fact that &quot;workers who have the highest probability of becoming unemployed have the highest demand for unemployment insurance.&quot; Adverse selection causes profit maximizing private insurance agencies to set high premiums for the insurance because there is a high likelihood they will have to make payments to the policyholder. High premiums work to exclude many individuals who otherwise might purchase the insurance. &quot;A compulsory government program avoids the adverse selection problem. Hence, government provision of UI has the potential to increase efficiency. However, government provision does not eliminate moral hazard.&quot;

====Moral hazard====
&quot;At the same time, those workers who managed to obtain insurance might experience more unemployment otherwise would have been the case.&quot; The private insurance company would have to determine whether the employee is unemployed through no fault of their own, which is difficult to determine. Incorrect determinations could result in the payout of significant amounts for fraudulent claims or alternately failure to pay legitimate claims. This leads to the rationale that if government could solve either problem that government intervention would increase efficiency. The moral hazard argument against unemployment insurance is based on the idea that such insurance would increase the risk, or &#x27;hazard,&#x27; that the insured worker would engage in activity that is undesirable, or &#x27;immoral,&#x27; from the insurer&#x27;s point of view. That is, unemployment insurance could create longer or more frequent episodes of unemployment than would otherwise occur. This could occur if workers partially cushioned against periods of unemployment are more likely to accept jobs that have a higher risk of unemployment, or spend more time searching for a new job after becoming unemployed.

====Unemployment insurance effect on unemployment====
In the Great Recession, the &quot;moral hazard&quot; issue of whether unemployment insurance—and specifically extending benefits past the maximum 99 weeks—significantly encourages unemployment by discouraging workers from finding and taking jobs was expressed by Republican legislators. Conservative economist Robert Barro found that benefits raised the unemployment rate 2%. Disagreeing with Barro&#x27;s study were Berkeley economist Jesse Rothstein, who found the &quot;vast majority&quot; of unemployment was due to &quot;demand shocks&quot; not &quot;[unemployment insurance]-induced supply reductions.&quot; A study by Rothstein of extensions of unemployment insurance to 99 weeks during the Great Recession to test the hypothesis that unemployment insurance discourages people from seeking jobs found the overall effect of UI on unemployment was to raise it by no more than one-tenth of 1%.

A November 2011 report by the Congressional Budget Office found that even if unemployment benefits convince some unemployed to ignore job openings, these openings were quickly filled by new entrants into the labour market. A survey of studies on unemployment insurance&#x27;s effect on employment by the Political Economy Research Institute found that unemployed who collected benefits did not find themselves out of work longer than those who &quot;did not&quot; have unemployment benefits; and that unemployed workers did not search for work more or reduce their wage expectations once their benefits ran out.

One concern over unemployment insurance increasing unemployment is based on experience rating benefit uses which can sometimes be imperfect. That is, the cost to the employer in increased taxes is less than the benefits that would be paid to the employee upon layoff. The firm in this instance believes that it is more cost effective to lay off the employee, causing more unemployment than under perfect experience rating.

====Unemployment insurance effect on employment====
An alternative rationale for unemployment insurance is that it may allow for improving the quality of matches between workers and firms. Marimon and Zilibotti argued that although a more generous unemployment benefit system may indeed increase the unemployment rate, it may also help improve the average match quality. A similar point is made by Mazur who analyzed the welfare and inequality effects of a policy reform giving entitlement for unemployment insurance to quitters. Arash Nekoei and Andrea Weber present empirical evidence from Austria that extending unemployment benefit duration raises wages by improving reemployment firm quality. Similarly, Tatsiramos studied data from European countries and found that although unemployment insurance does increase unemployment duration, the duration of subsequent employment tends to be longer (suggesting better match quality).

====Effect on state budgets====
Another issue with unemployment insurance relates to its effects on state budgets. During recessionary time periods, the number of unemployed rises and they begin to draw benefits from the program. The longer the recession lasts, depending on the state&#x27;s starting UI program balance, the quicker the state begins to run out of funds. The recession that began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009 significantly impacted state budgets. According to The Council of State Governments, by 18 March 2011, 32 states plus the Virgin Islands had borrowed nearly $45.7 billion. The Labour Department estimates by the fourth quarter of 2013, as many as 40 states may need to borrow more than $90 billion to fund their unemployment programs and it will take a decade or more to pay off the debt.

====Insurance funds====
Possible policy options for states to shore up the unemployment insurance funds include lowering benefits for recipients and/or raising taxes on businesses. Kentucky took the approach of raising taxes and lowering benefits to attempt to balance its unemployment insurance program. Starting in 2010, a claimant&#x27;s weekly benefits will decrease from 68% to 62% and the taxable wage base will increase from US$8,000 to US$12,000, over a ten-year period. These moves are estimated to save the state over US$450 million.

====Job sharing / short-time working====
Job sharing or work sharing and short time or short-time working refer to situations or systems in which employees agree to or are forced to accept a reduction in working time and pay. These can be based on individual agreements or on government programs in many countries that try to prevent unemployment. In these, employers have the option of reducing work hours to part-time for many employees instead of laying off some of them and retaining only full-time workers. For example, employees in 27 states of the United States can then receive unemployment payments for the hours they are no longer working.

====Self-employment and employment rates====
Unemployment insurance has varying effects on employment and self-employment rates. As self-employment is generally not covered, an increase in UI generosity creates greater disincentives for self-employment, which leads to a positive correlation between UI generosity and the transition from self-employment to paid-employment. Conversely, individuals already in paid-employment experience the opposite trend. This reallocation from self-employment to paid-employment may have a positive effect on the employment rate in the economy but may have a strong negative effect on self-employment rates. It has also been shown that allowing self-employed individuals to access unemployment insurance might lead to a boost in self-employment activity.

==International Labour Convention==
International Labour Organization has adopted the Employment Promotion and Protection against Unemployment Convention, 1988 for promotion of employment against unemployment and social security including unemployment benefit.

<text>Child benefit or children&#x27;s allowance is a social security payment which is distributed to the parents or guardians of children, teenagers and in some cases, young adults. Countries operate different versions of the benefit. In most child benefit is means-tested and the amount paid is usually dependent on the number of children.

==Conditions for payment==
A number of conditional cash transfer programs in Latin America and Africa link payment to the receivers&#x27; actions, such as enrolling children into schools, and health check-ups and vaccinations. In the UK, in 2011 CentreForum proposed an additional child benefit dependent on parenting activities.

==Australia==
In Australia, the system of child benefit payments, once termed child endowment and currently called Family Tax Benefit, is income tested and linked to the Australian Income tax system. It can be claimed as fortnightly payments or as an annual lump sum. It may be payable for dependant children from birth up to the age of 24. Children 16 years or older may alternatively be eligible for Youth Allowance. Parents of dependant children under the age of 16 may also be eligible for Income Support Payments including Parenting Payment and Newstart Allowance for Primary Carers of Children.

On 1 July 2000 the Australian government introduced major changes to the tax system including the introduction of a broad-based Goods and Service Tax (a VAT), substantial income tax cuts, as well as major changes to assistance for families.

These changes to family assistance simplified payments, by amalgamating a number of different forms of assistance, and also provided higher levels of assistance, with reductions in income test withdrawal rates. The new structure combined twelve of the pre-existing types of assistance into three new programs of assistance. The two most important of these are Family Tax Benefit Part A, which assists with the general costs of raising children, and Family Tax Benefit Part B, which is directed to single income and sole parent families. The third programme is Child Care Benefit.

The Family Tax Benefit Part A is paid for dependent children up to 20 years of age, and for dependent full-time students up to the age of 24 (who are not getting Youth Allowance or similar payments such as ABSTUDY and Veterans&#x27; Children Education Supplement). It is essentially a two-tier but integrated payment directed to most families with children, with a higher rate for lower income families, including both those in work and receiving income support.

The maximum rate is paid up to a family income of $28,200, and is then reduced by 30 cents for every extra dollar of income, until the minimum rate is reached. Part-payment at the minimum rate is available up to a family income of $73,000 (plus an additional $3,000 for each dependent child after the first). Payments are then reduced by 30 cents in every dollar over that amount until the payment reaches nil.

To receive some Family Tax Benefit Part A, the maximum income levels are $76,256 a year for a family with one dependent child under 18 and $77,355 a year for a family with one dependent 18- to 24-year-old. These thresholds are lifted by $6,257 for each additional dependent child under 18 and $7,356 for each additional dependent 18- to 24-year-old.

Families receiving Family Tax Benefit Part A may also be eligible for extra payments, such as Rent Assistance if renting privately, the Large Family Supplement for four or more children, and Multiple Birth Allowance for three or more children born during the same birth.

Family Tax Benefit Part B provides extra assistance to single income families including sole parents - particularly families with children under 5 years of age. In a couple, if the secondary earner&#x27;s income is above $1,616 a year, payments are reduced by 30 cents for every extra dollar of income. Parents receive therefore some Family Tax Benefit Part B if the secondary earner&#x27;s income is below $10,416 a year if the youngest child is under 5 years of age, or $7,786 a year if the youngest child is between 5 and 18 years of age. There is no income test on the primary earner&#x27;s income, so in the case of sole parents the payment is universal.

The previous entry referred to Youth allowance and Parenting Payment. These are income support payments for young people and for parents who are not employed and looking after children respectively.

==Canada==
The Canada child benefit (CCB) is a tax-free monthly payment made to eligible families to help them with the cost of raising children under 18 years of age. Basic benefit for July 2019 to June 2020 is calculated as:
* 6,639 CAD per year (553.25 CAD per month) for each eligible child under the age of 6.
* 5,602 CAD per year (466.83 CAD per month) for each eligible child aged 6 to 17.

This amount is reduced for families with adjusted family net income (AFNI) over $31,120, based on AFNI and the number of children.

==Finland==
From the 1920s there was a child benefit allowance that covered state workers with children. Near universal child benefit was introduced to Finland in 1948 by law, following the example of other Nordic countries. Benefit is paid for children until they are 17, and only for children who live in Finland. There is also a supplement for single parents. Benefit is paid through national Finnish Social Insurance institution (KELA). Åland has a different scheme.

==Hungary==
In Hungary there are several forms of family support. Every person who has a work permit and lives permanently in Hungary is eligible for almost all of them.

===Family allowance===
One of them is called &quot;family allowance&quot; (&quot;&quot;) which is corresponding to the social program in other countries under the name &quot;child benefit&quot;. Its amount depends on the number of children. For families with one child it is 12,200 HUF, for families with two children 13,300 HUF and for families with three or more children it is 16,000 HUF per child per month. For single parents (parents who are raising their children alone) the amount of &quot;family allowance&quot; is 1,500 HUF more in the first and second categories and 1,000 HUF more in the third category. &quot;Family allowance&quot; is paid until the age of 18 or to the completion of secondary education. For children with disability the amount is 23,300 HUF and for disabled children of single parents it is 25,900 HUF.

If the child misses more than 50 school hours without permission, the &quot;family allowance&quot; will be suspended until the child re-fulfills his/her school attendance obligation properly. In the case of pre-school age children, &quot;family allowance&quot; will be suspended in case of an unjustified absence exceeding 20 days of education.

The government has no plans to raise child benefit, but the amount of the tax benefit will be doubled by 2026.

===Family tax benefit===

The other one is called &quot;family tax benefit&quot; (&quot;&quot;) which is a tax reduction for families according to the number of children living in the household. Its amount can be maximal 10,000 HUF for parents with one child, 15,000 HUF for parents with two children and 33,000 HUF for parents with three or more children per month. There are no differences between single and double households or between families with one or two parents employed.

People get &quot;family allowance&quot; and &quot;family tax benefit&quot; at the same time, so it is also common to count them together as a kind of &quot;child benefit&quot;.

==Ireland==
Child Benefit (&quot;Sochar Leanaí&quot;) is payable to parents of children under 16 years of age, or under 18 years of age if they are in full-time education, Youthreach training or has a disability. The payment is paid by the Department of Social Protection. The monthly payments are as follows:
Multiple births are a special case. In the event of twins, 150% of the monthly payment is paid for each child. Triplets, or more, are paid the double (200%) rate each; provided that all of them remain qualified (i.e. stay in further education until 19). In addition, a special &#x27;once-off&#x27; grant of €635 is paid on all multiple births. Further &#x27;once-off&#x27; grants of €635 are paid when the children are 4 and 12 years old respectively.

Fraudulent claims of Child Benefit are treated very seriously, and can result in large fines or prison for up to 3 years.

==Japan==
== Luxembourg ==
=== Family allowance ===
The government, through the &quot;Caisse pour l&#x27;avenir des enfants&quot; (Children&#x27;s Future Fund), pays €299.86 per month per child. The allowance is universal and is not means-tested.

When a child is 6 years old, the amount increases to €322.53 per month.

When a child is 12 years old, the amount increases to €356.43 per month.

The family allowance is paid until the child is 18, unless they continue in education, in which case it is paid until the adult child ceases being enrolled at an educational institution or is 25 years old, whichever happens first.

==== Supplement for disabled children ====
The family allowance amount is increased by €200 per month for children who have a permanent disability causing them to lose at least 50% of their physical or mental capacity in comparison to a child of the same age with no disabilities.

=== Back-to-school allowance ===
In addition to the family allowance, a lump-sum back-to-school allowance is paid once a year in August for every child aged 6 or over enrolled at a primary or secondary school or college.

The allowance is €115 every August per child over 6 years old and under 12 years old.

The allowance is €235 every August per child over 12 years old until their schooling comes to an end.

==Netherlands==
The Netherlands has one of the lowest child benefits (Dutch: kinderbijslag) in Western Europe. 

In 2021, the amount per child per month is: 74.46 euros for children aged 0 to 5 years; 80.41 euros for children aged 6 to 11 years; 106.37 euros per month for children from 12 to 17 years.

In comparison to Netherlands, its neighbour Germany pays 3 times more per month with lower income tax.

Kindgebonden budget

In addition to these general child benefits, there&#x27;s a benefit depending on household income. For a household income up to 70.000 (single) or 99.000 (two parents), the &quot;kindgebonden budget&quot; is (2021) up to:

Inkomensafhankelijke combinatiekorting

If a household has a child less than 12 years of age and the parent with the lowest income has an income of more than 5.154 euro per year (2021), he or she receives a tax deduction of up to 2.815 euro per year (234,58 per month, 2021).

==New Zealand==
New Zealand has a tax rebate system known as &#x27;Working For Families&#x27;, which are allocated to families based on income and the number of children. A report in 2012 by the children&#x27;s commissioner Dr Russell Wills recommended New Zealand adopt a universal child benefit, which the-then National government rejected.

In 2018, the Sixth Labour Government introduced a new universal BestStart Payment of $60 per week for parents with newborn dependents.

==Poland==
There are two forms of parents financial support.
The first one is tax cut. It was introduced in early 2000s. One of parents can deduct it from their annual personal tax settlement.
Currently it is PLN 92,67 (€19) monthly for first and second child, PLN 166,67 (€35) for the third and PLN 225 (€47) for each next child.
There is no possibility to use it when parents are not subject for personal income tax in basic form (e.g. that excludes some alternative forms of taxation in small business). There is also an income limitation if there is only a single child. The limit is PLN 56,000 (€11,700) per year per each parent. The tax cut is possible for parents of children up to 25 years provided that the child learns at school and child’s annual income does not exceed a small limit (close to PLN 16,000, €3340 monthly).

Another form is direct payment for parents. The programme, named &quot;Family 500+&quot; has been introduced in 2016 was created by the PiS government. Initially it was only for parents of more than one child, and the payment was 500 PLN (€116) monthly per child. The benefit base was a number of children minus one. Later on in 2019 it&#x27;s been simplified and made more common: the benefit is paid for each child. From the very beginning the rate is constant and is PLN 800 (€187) monthly per child. The payment is not a subject of any income tax (e.g. cannot increase your income to excess the limit mentioned in above paragraph) and is paid unconditionally for children up to 18 years.

There is no research that proves any birth rate increase due to any of these forms of support.

==Spain==
Between 2007 and 2010, Spain provided unconditional cash transfers to new mothers. The policy substantially increased the birth rate in Spain.

==South Korea==
As of May 2021, any Korean family with a child aged between 0-7 receives 100,000 won per month in cash transferred to the parent&#x27;s bank account from the Korean government, regardless of income or wealth. Finally, a debit card prepaid with 600,000 won is issued by the government to anyone pregnant or with a child in the country, which can be used for medical checks and initial upbringing costs. From January 2022, this debit card will be prepaid with an increased amount of 1 million won by the government.

From January 2022, 2 million won will be immediately paid to anyone giving their first birth in South Korea and the cash can be used for any purpose on top of receiving all of the various aforementioned benefits. 3 million won will be given for the second and further child. In addition, the additional bonus cash given to newborn babies aged 0-11 months will be raised to 1,000,000 won per month, and babies aged 12-23 months will receive 500,000 per month. Each parent will receive a paid holiday of up to 3 million won per month each for 3 consecutive months. Low income families who have a third child will have their children&#x27;s university education fully paid for free by the Korean government.

==United Kingdom==
The minimum wage was introduced in Great Britain in 1909, by Winston Churchill, for certain low-wage industries and expanded to numerous industries, including farm labour, by 1920. However, by the 1920s, family allowance targeted at low-income families was an alternative method, suggested by reformers, to relieve poverty without distorting the labour market. The trade unions and the Labour Party adopted this view. In 1945, family allowances were introduced; minimum wages faded from view. Talk resumed in the 1970s, but in the 1980s the Thatcher ministry made it clear it would not accept a national minimum wage. Eventually with the return of Labour to power, the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 set a minimum wage of £3.60 per hour, with lower rates for younger workers. It largely affected workers in high-turnover service industries such as fast-food restaurants, and people from ethnic minority backgrounds.

The system was first implemented in August 1946 as &quot;family allowances&quot; under the Family Allowances Act 1945, at a rate of 5&quot;s&quot; (= £0.25) per week per child in a family, except for the eldest. This was raised from September 1952, by the Family Allowances and National Insurance Act 1952, to 8&quot;s&quot; (= £0.40), and from October 1956, by the Family Allowances Act and National Insurance Act 1956, to 8&quot;s&quot; for the second child with 10&quot;s&quot; (= £0.50) for the third and subsequent children.

By 1955, some 5,000,000 allowances were being paid, to about 3,250,000 families.

It was modified in 1977, with the payments being termed &quot;child benefit&quot; and given for the eldest child as well as the younger ones; by 1979 it was worth £4 per child per week. In 1991, the system was further altered, with a higher payment now given for the first child than for their younger siblings. In October 2010, the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government announced that Child Benefit would be withdrawn from households containing a higher-rate taxpayer from January 2013. After some controversy, this was amended so that any household with at least one person with prescribed income over £50,000 would lose Child Benefit by a taper which removed it altogether when the income reached £60,000. This came into force on 7 January 2013.

Today, child benefit is administered by His Majesty&#x27;s Revenue and Customs (HMRC). As of April 2023, this is £24 per week for the first child (including the eldest of a multiple birth) and £15.90 per week for each additional child.

<text>Lyle Preslar is an American musician best known for being the guitar player and songwriter for the hardcore punk band Minor Threat. 

Before that, he was the vocalist for The Extorts, who later became State of Alert after he quit. Despite not performing on any State of Alert recordings, Preslar received co-writing credit for the songs &quot;Draw Blank&quot; from the &quot;No Policy&quot; EP and &quot;I Hate the Kids&quot; from the Dischord Records compilation &quot;Flex Your Head&quot;.

Preslar was a member of Minor Threat during their entire 1980-83 lifespan. His guitar playing was praised by Minor Threat bandmate Ian Mackaye, who stated &quot;Lyle Preslar, the guitar player, I mean he&#x27;s one of the most unsung guitar players. He&#x27;s playing full, six-string-position barre chords at that speed—that&#x27;s just insane. His accuracy and his rhythms are so incredible.&quot;

After Minor Threat dissolved, he played guitar in the first incarnation of Samhain circa 1983, and with The Meatmen 1983-88. Preslar was briefly involved with an early version of Big Black in 1981, but soon departed due to personality clashes with Steve Albini.

After retiring from performing, he ran Caroline Records, signing Ben Folds, the Chemical Brothers, and Fatboy Slim; he was later a marketing executive for Elektra Records and Sire Records. In 2007, he graduated from Rutgers School of Law–Newark. He is admitted to practice law in the state of New York.

He is married to Sandy Alouete, an executive at VH1, and they have a child named Romy.

Preslar also won the Grammy Law Initiative Writing Prize in 2007 with an article about the RIAA vs. XM Satellite Radio.

<doc id="378436" wikidata="Q1351369" url="?curid=378436" title="Maundy (foot washing)">
<text>Maundy (from Old French &quot;mandé&quot;, from Latin &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;command&quot;), or Washing of the Saints&#x27; Feet, Washing of the Feet, or Pedelavium or Pedilavium, is a religious rite observed by various Christian denominations. The word &quot;mandatum&quot; is the first word of the Latin Biblical quotation sung at the ceremony of the washing of the feet: &quot;Mandatum novum do vobis ut diligatis invicem sicut dilexi vos&quot;, from the text of John 13:34 in the Vulgate (&quot;I give you a new commandment, That ye love one another as I have loved you&quot;, ). The ceremony commemorates the commandment of Christ that hisdisciples should emulate his loving humility in the washing of the feet (). The medieval Latin term &quot;mandatum&quot; (&quot;mandé&quot;, maundy), came to apply to the rite of foot-washing on the Thursday preceding Easter Sunday, known in English as &quot;Maundy Thursday&quot; since at least 1530.

John 13:2–17 recounts Jesus&#x27; performance of this action. In verses 13:14–17, Christ instructs His disciples:

The Early Church practiced footwashing prior to the receiving of the Eucharist, and the rite was recorded early in the third century by the Christian apologist Tertullian, who discussed it involving a basin of &quot;water for the saints&#x27; feet&quot;, along with a &quot;linen towel&quot;.

Some Christian denominations throughout Church history have practiced foot washing as a church ordinance, including Adventists, Anabaptists (such as Conservative Mennonites and the Dunkard Brethren), Free Will Baptists, Missionary Methodists, and Pentecostals. Of these, certain denominations, such as the Dunkard Brethren Church, regularly practice feetwashing as part of the lovefeast, which includes the holy kiss, feetwashing, communion, and a communal meal. Many Christian denominations (including Catholics, Lutherans, Anglicans, as well as certain Presbyterians and Methodists, among others) observe the liturgical washing of the feet on Maundy Thursday of Holy Week.

== Background ==
The root of this practice is to be found in the hospitality customs of ancient civilizations, especially where sandals were the chief footwear. A host would provide water for guests to wash their feet, provide a servant to wash the feet of the guests or even serve the guests by washing their feet. This is mentioned in several places in the Old Testament of the Bible (e.g. Genesis ; ; ; ; 1 Samuel ; et al.), as well as other religious and historical documents. A typical Eastern host might bow, greet, and kiss his guest, then offer water to allow the guest to wash his feet or have servants do it. Though the wearing of sandals might necessitate washing the feet, the water was also offered as a courtesy even when shoes were worn.

1 Samuel is the first biblical passage where an honored person offers to wash feet as a sign of humility. In John 12, Mary of Bethany anointed Jesus&#x27; feet presumably in gratitude for raising her brother Lazarus from the dead, and in preparation for his death and burial. The Bible records washing of the saint&#x27;s feet being practised by the early church in I Timothy perhaps in reference to piety, submission and/or humility. There are several names for this practice: &quot;maundy&quot;, &quot;foot washing&quot;, &quot;washing the saints&#x27; feet&quot;, &quot;pedilavium&quot;, and &quot;mandatum&quot;.

The foot washing, described in the thirteenth chapter of the Gospel of John, is concerned with the Latin title of &quot;Servus servorum dei&quot; (&quot;Servant of the Servants of God&quot;), which was historically reserved to the Bishops and to the Pope, also called the Bishop of Rome. Jesus Christ, the Son of God, commissioned the Twelve to be Servant of the Servant of God, and this calling to the Imitation of Christ has been firstly extended to all the bishops of the Church as the direct successors of the Apostles. The Apostles received the Holy Spirit from Jesus in the gospel of John chapter 20.22 and in fullness upon the day of the Pentecost in chapter 2 of the Book of Acts, for the evangelization and salvation of all the human race. This belief is common to Catholics, to some denominations of the Western Christianity, and is consistent and in keeping with Eastern Christian beliefs.

It is also recalled in the Latin text of the &quot;Magnificat&quot;, for which God &quot;regarded the lowliness&quot; of Mary, Mother of Jesus, and, by effect of that, &quot;magnified&quot; her (&quot;He hath put down the mighty from their seat: and hath exalted the humble and meek.&quot;). God also did the same to all the other creatures, both before and after the Incarnation, for: 
* Jesus Christ God: as affirmed in ;
* all the angels: the Satan&#x27;s mighty pride to be like God made him the fallen angel before the creation of man, and also it was punished with the promised mission of a woman (Mary), a Servant of God, which would have bruise his head (). On the opposite side, the lowliness of St Michael the Archangel made him the head of the hierarchy of angels; 
* all the human creatures: according to the promise of Jesus in .

== Biblical reference ==
Christian denominations that observe foot washing do so on the basis of the authoritative example and command of Jesus as found in (KJV):

Jesus demonstrates the custom of the time when he comments on the lack of hospitality in one Pharisee&#x27;s home by not providing water to wash his feet in Luke 7:44:

== History ==
The rite of foot washing finds its roots in scripture, where Jesus tells his followers &quot;to wash one another&#x27;s feet&quot; (cf. ). After the death of the apostles or the end of the Apostolic Age, the practice was continued.

Footwashing was practiced in the early centuries of post-apostolic Christianity, with Tertullian (145–220) mentioning the practice as being a part of Christian worship in his &quot;De Corona&quot;. Footwashing was done with a basin &quot;of water for the saints&#x27; feet&quot; and a &quot;linen towel&quot;, prior to the reception of the Eucharist. Additionally, in the 1st century, Christian women went to locations in which marginalized people resided (such as prisons) and washed their feet. The early Church Father Clement of Alexandria linked the new sandals given to the Prodigal Son with feetwashing, describing &quot;non-perishable shoes that are only fit to be worn by those who have had their feet washed by Jesus, the Teacher and Lord.&quot; The early Church thus saw footwashing to be connected to repentance, involving a spiritual cleansing by Jesus. 

Around 256 AD, Cyprian, the bishop of Carthage, wrote about footwashing teaching &quot;the hands how to act in service&quot;.

It was practiced by the Church at Milan (c. 380) and is mentioned by the &quot;Council of Elvira&quot; (300). The Church Fathers Origen, as well as John Chrysostom and Augustine (c. 400) encouraged the practice as an imitation of Christ.

Observance of foot washing at the time of baptism was maintained in Africa, Gaul, Germany, Milan, northern Italy, and Ireland.

According to the &quot;Mennonite Encyclopedia&quot; &quot;St. Benedict&#x27;s &quot;Rule&quot; (529) for the Benedictine Order prescribed hospitality feetwashing in addition to a communal feetwashing for humility&quot;; a statement confirmed by the Catholic Encyclopedia. It apparently was established in the Roman church, though not in connection with baptism, by the 8th century.

The Greek Orthodox Church counted footwashing among the sacraments, though it was not practiced that often.

The Synod of Toledo (694) &quot;declared that footwashing should be observed on Maundy Thursday&quot; and Roman Catholic churches thus came to observe footwashing on that day.

The Albigenses and the Waldenses&#x27; practiced footwashing as a rite.

There is some evidence that it was observed by the early Hussites; and the practice was a meaningful part of the 16th century radical reformation, which resulted in Anabaptist denominations regularly practicing footwashing as an ordinance.

==Denominations practicing ritual foot-washing==
The ritual washing of feet is currently practiced in many religious denominations including those listed below.

===Roman Catholic===
In Catholic Church, the ritual washing of feet is now associated with the Mass of the Lord&#x27;s Supper, which celebrates in a special way the Last Supper of Jesus, before which he washed the feet of his twelve apostles.

Evidence for the practice on this day goes back at least to the latter half of the 12th century, when &quot;the pope washed the feet of twelve sub-deacons after his Mass and of thirteen poor men after his dinner.&quot; From 1570 to 1955, the Roman Missal printed, after the text of the Holy Thursday Mass, a rite of washing of feet unconnected with the Mass. For many years Pius IX performed the foot washing in the sala over the portico of Saint Peter&#x27;s, Rome.
In 1955 Pope Pius XII revised the ritual and inserted it into the Mass. Since then, the rite is celebrated after the homily that follows the reading of the gospel account of how Jesus washed the feet of his twelve apostles (). Some persons who have been selected – usually twelve, but the Roman Missal does not specify the number – are led to chairs prepared in a suitable place. The priest goes to each and, with the help of the ministers, pours water over each one&#x27;s feet and dries them. There are some advocates of restricting this ritual to clergy or at least men.

In a notable break from the 1955 norms, Pope Francis washed the feet of two women and Muslims at a juvenile detention center in Rome in 2013. In 2016 it was announced that the Roman Missal had been revised to permit women to have their feet washed on Maundy Thursday; previously it permitted only males to do so. In 2016 Catholic priests around the world washed both women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s feet on Holy Thursday and &quot;their gesture of humility represented to many the progress of inclusion in the Catholic church.&quot;

At one time, most of the European monarchs also performed feet washing in their royal courts on Maundy Thursday, a practice continued by the Austro-Hungarian Emperor and the King of Spain up to the beginning of the 20th century (see Royal Maundy). In 1181 Roger de Moulins, Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller issued a statute declaring, &quot;In Lent every Saturday, they are accustomed to celebrate maundy for thirteen poor persons, and to wash their feet, and to give to each a shirt and new breeches and new shoes, and to three chaplains, or to three clerics out of the thirteen, three deniers and to each of the others, two deniers&quot;.

===Lutheran and Anglican===

Foot washing rites are practiced by the Lutheran and Anglican churches, whereby foot washing is most often experienced in connection with Maundy Thursday services and, sometimes, at ordination services where the Bishop may wash the feet of those who are to be ordained. 
Though history shows that foot washing has at times been practiced in connection with baptism, and at times as a separate occasion, by far its most common practice has been in connection with the Lord&#x27;s supper service. .

===Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic===
The Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Churches practice the ritual of the Washing of Feet on Holy and Great Thursday (Maundy Thursday) according to their ancient rites. The service may be performed either by a bishop, washing the feet of twelve priests; or by an Hegumen (Abbot) washing the feet of twelve members of the brotherhood of his monastery. The ceremony takes place at the end of the Divine Liturgy.

After Holy Communion, and before the dismissal, the brethren all go in procession to the place where the Washing of Feet is to take place (it may be in the center of the nave, in the narthex, or a location outside). After a psalm and some troparia (hymns) an ektenia (litany) is recited, and the bishop or abbot reads a prayer. Then the deacon reads the account in the Gospel of John, while the clergy perform the roles of Christ and his apostles as each action is chanted by the deacon. The deacon stops when the dialogue between Jesus and Peter begins. The senior-ranking clergyman among those whose feet are being washed speaks the words of Peter, and the bishop or abbot speaks the words of Jesus. Then the bishop or abbot himself concludes the reading of the Gospel, after which he says another prayer and sprinkles all of those present with the water that was used for the foot washing. The procession then returns to the church and the final dismissal is given as normal.

===Oriental Orthodox===

Foot washing rites are also observed in the Oriental Orthodox churches on Maundy Thursday.

In the Coptic Orthodox Church the service is performed by the parish priest. He blesses the water for the foot washing with the cross, just as he would for blessing holy water and he washes the feet of the entire congregation.

In the Syriac Orthodox Church, this service is performed by a bishop or priest. There will be some 12 selected men, both priests and the lay people, and the bishop or priest will wash and kiss the feet of those 12 men. It is not merely a dramatization of the past event. Further it is a prayer where the whole congregation prays to wash and cleanse them of their sins.

===Anabaptist===
Groups descending from the 1708 Schwarzenau Brethren, such as the Grace Brethren, Church of the Brethren, Brethren Church, Brethren in Christ, Old German Baptist Brethren, and the Dunkard Brethren regularly practice foot washing (generally called &quot;feetwashing&quot;) as one of three ordinances that compose their Lovefeast, the others being the holy kiss, the Eucharist and a fellowship meal. Historically related groups such as the Amish and most Mennonites also wash feet, tracing the practice to the 1632 Dordrecht Confession of Faith. For members, this practice promotes humility towards and care for others, resulting in a higher egalitarianism among members.

===Moravian===
The Moravian Church has historically practiced footwashing (pedelavium). This reflected the emphasis Moravians place on practicing customs of the early Church, such as the Lovefeast. In 1818, the practice was made no longer compulsory, though it continues in the present-day. Traditionally, Moravian Christians practiced footwashing before partaking in the Lord&#x27;s Supper, although in most Moravian congregations, these rites are observed chiefly on Maundy Thursday.

===Methodist===
In certain Methodist connexions, such as the Missionary Methodist Church and the New Congregational Methodist Church, feetwashning is practiced at the time that the Lord&#x27;s Supper is celebrated. In other Methodist denominations, such as the Free Methodist Church and Methodist Protestant Church, feetwashing is practiced on Maundy Thursday, and may be done at other times, such as when General Conference is held. The tradition of the Church of the United Brethren in Christ, one of the ancestors of the United Methodist Church and descendant Global Methodist Church, practices feetwashing when communion is observed; as such, some United Methodist and Global Methodist churches continue this tradition, especially those congregations of Evangelical United Brethren patrimony.

===Baptist===
Many Baptists observe the literal washing of feet as a third ordinance. The communion and foot washing service is practiced regularly by members of the Separate Baptists in Christ, General Association of Baptists, Free Will Baptists, Primitive Baptists, Union Baptists, Old Regular Baptist, Christian Baptist Church of God. Feet washing is also practiced as a third ordinance by many Southern Baptists, General Baptists, and Independent Baptists.

===Pentecostal===
Various Pentecostal denominations practice the ordinance or ritual of footwashing, in connection with the sacrament of the Lord&#x27;s Supper or Communion, in the past. Often, foot washing is held as an optional service separate from communion on a different date. When celebrated in conjunction with the Sacrament of the Lord&#x27;s Supper, or communion, the Pastor, or designated minister, will read the scriptural text, out of the Gospel of St. John, then instruct the men to assemble in one location of the church, and the women to assemble in another location of the church - where basins with water and towels have already been suitably prepared in front of a pew, or row of chairs. Each member takes turns sitting in a chair or pew while another kneels before him or her and washes their feet. Customs may vary. Sometimes the foot washer places both of the other persons feet into the water, scooping water over them with his/her hand, simply holding them, sometimes the feet are held over the basin while water is poured over them, and in some congregations, only one foot is made bare and has water poured over it/washed. Often, the person whose feet are being washed lays a hand/or hands upon the shoulder of the person washing their feet and he or she will pray for the person washing their feet. The foot washer also prays for humility and for the person they are washing. When all have participated in washing the feet of others and having their feet washed, a benediction and dismissal of the service is conducted. Members are often instructed to continue their service to others in the church and to the world at large. After the dismissal, participates usually participate in helping clean up the area, basins, etc.

===Latter-day Saint Movement===
In the mid-1830s, Joseph Smith introduced the original temple rites of the Latter Day Saint movement in Kirtland, Ohio, which primarily involved foot washing, followed by speaking in tongues and visions. This foot washing took place exclusively among men, and was based upon the Old and New Testament. After Joseph Smith was initiated into the first three degrees of Freemasonry, this was adapted into the whole body Endowment ritual more similar to contemporary Mormon practice, which shares some similarities to Masonic temple rites, and does not specifically involve the feet.
In 1843, Smith included a foot washing element in the faith&#x27;s second anointing ceremony in which elite married couples are anointed as heavenly monarchs and priests.

The observance of &quot;washing the saints&#x27; feet&quot; is quite varied, but a typical service follows the partaking of unleavened bread and wine. Deacons (in many cases) place pans of water in front of pews that have been arranged for the service. The men and women participate in separate groups, men washing men&#x27;s feet and women washing women&#x27;s feet. Each member of the congregation takes a turn washing the feet of another member. Each foot is placed one at a time into the basin of water, is washed by cupping the hand and pouring water over the foot, and is dried with a long towel girded around the waist of the member performing the washing. Most of these services appear to be quite moving to the participants.

===Restorationist===
The True Jesus Church includes footwashing as a scriptural sacrament based on . Like the other two sacraments, namely Baptism and the Lord&#x27;s Supper, members of the church believe that footwashing imparts salvific grace to the recipient—in this case, to have a part with Christ ().

Most Church of God denominations also include footwashing in their Passover ceremony based on John 13:1–11.

===Seventh-day Adventist===
Most Seventh-day Adventist congregations schedule an opportunity for foot washing preceding each quarterly (four times a year) Communion service. As with their &quot;open&quot; Communion, all believers in attendance, not just members or pastors, are invited to share in the washing of feet with another: men with men, women with women, and frequently, spouse with spouse. This service is alternatively called the Ordinance of Foot-Washing or the Ordinance of Humility. Its primary purpose is to renew the cleansing that only comes from Christ, but secondarily to seek and celebrate reconciliation with another member before Communion/the Lord&#x27;s Supper.

===Progressive Judaism===
A number of Jewish rabbis who disagree with the initiation custom of &quot;brit milah&quot;, or circumcision of a male baby, instead have offered &quot;brit shalom&quot;, or a multi-part naming ceremony which eschews circumcision. One portion of the ritual, &quot;Brit rechitzah&quot;, involves the washing of the baby&#x27;s feet.

<text>The Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety (, BEA) is an agency of the French government, responsible for investigating aviation accidents and incidents and making safety recommendations based on what is learned from those investigations.

Its headquarters are at Paris–Le Bourget Airport in Le Bourget, near Paris. The BEA has 96 employees in 2019, including 30 investigators and 12 investigative assistants. It is under the authority of the Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development, Transport and Housing.

The BEA was created in 1946. It operates under, amongst other texts, the French civil aviation and transports codes.

Following international rules, French authorities are responsible for investigating all aircraft accidents occurring in French territory or airspace, as well as accidents involving French aircraft occurring in international airspace or in other countries if the local authorities do not open a technical enquiry. They may also assist foreign investigation authorities at their request. They are also the investigating party for all Airbus aircraft.

Since 1 January 2014, the head of the BEA has been Rémi Jouty, engineer general of the Bridges, Waters and Forests, succeeding Jean-Paul Troadec.

==Facilities==

It is headquartered in Building 153 on the grounds of Paris–Le Bourget Airport in Le Bourget, near Paris. The BEA building is located in front of the French Air and Space Museum and houses offices and laboratories. The BEA building at Le Bourget has over of space; it had been expanded to that amount in 2002, and to by 1999. Previously the building had of space.

In addition the BEA has facilities at Melun Aerodrome. They include hangars and protected areas with a combined total of of space. The BEA also has hangars and protected areas in Bonneuil-sur-Marne. The BEA has satellite offices in Aix-en-Provence, Bordeaux, Rennes, and Toulouse.

At one time the head office of the &quot;Bureau d&#x27;Enquêtes-Accidents&quot; (as it was known before 2001, and is still frequently if loosely referred to) was in the 15th arrondissement of Paris.

<doc id="378438" wikidata="Q15817131" url="?curid=378438" title="Sand eel">
<text>Sand eel or sandeel is the common name used for a considerable number of species of fish. While they are not true eels, they are eel-like in their appearance and can grow up to in length. Many species are found off the western coasts of Europe from Spain to Scotland, and in the Mediterranean and Baltic Seas.

Sand eels are an important food source for seabirds, including puffins and kittiwakes. They are a commercially important for the production of fish meal and made up 4% of fish globally caught for fish-meal production (behind anchovy, capelin, and blue whiting) between 1997 and 2001.

==Habitat==
The preferential habitat for sand eels is a seabed floor, with a relatively smooth bottom of gravelly sand; an example of this prime habitat is the floor of the Sea of the Hebrides.

==Sand eel species==
Most sand eels are sea fish of the genera &quot;Hyperoplus&quot; (greater sand eels), &quot;Gymnammodytes&quot; or &quot;Ammodytes&quot;. The three genera listed above all fall within the family Ammodytidae, the sand lances. Members of these genera found in other oceans are not usually called sand eels, and species from other parts of the world that are known as sand eels are usually less closely related.

==Commercial fishing==
Traditionally, they have been little exploited for human food, but are a major target of industrial fishing for animal feed and fertilizer. Increasing fishing for them is thought to be causing problems for some of their natural predators, especially the auks, which take them in deeper water. 

An instance of this was the RSPB report linking a population crash of seabirds in the North Sea to fishing for sand eels. This led to political pressure for the closure of this fishery; the seabird populations subsequently improved.

They are also used as artificial lures to catch fish.

<doc id="378439" wikidata="Q703011" url="?curid=378439" title="Arrowsmith (film)">
<text>Arrowsmith is a 1931 American pre-Code drama film directed by John Ford and starring Ronald Colman, Helen Hayes, Richard Bennett, and Myrna Loy. It was adapted from Sinclair Lewis&#x27;s 1925 novel &quot;Arrowsmith&quot; by Sidney Howard, departing substantially from the book regarding Arrowsmith&#x27;s womanizing and other key plot elements. The pre-Code film received four Oscar nominations, including the Academy Award for Best Picture, Best Writing, Adaptation (Howard), Best Cinematography (Ray June), and Best Art Direction (Richard Day).

==Plot==
An idealistic young medical student, Martin Arrowsmith, introduces himself assertively to Dr. Max Gottlieb, a noted bacteriologist. Though Gottlieb deems Arrowsmith not yet ready to study with him, he is impressed by the young man&#x27;s determination and honest self-appraisal, and encourages him to take the standard course of study first. When Arrowsmith graduates, Gottlieb offers him a position as his research assistant, but the young man reluctantly turns him down, having fallen in love with a nurse, Leora. He would be unable to support her on a research assistant&#x27;s meager salary. He marries, and the couple sets off for Leora&#x27;s rural home town in South Dakota.

Unhappy with the vicissitudes of his medical practice there, he is drawn by a former client across the boundary into veterinary medicine when the man&#x27;s cows are dying - even faster when given injections by the local state health official. Determined to find a cure of his own, he carries out scientific research in his kitchen, eventually developing a successful serum. Reinvigorated, he decides to abandon his practice and join Gottlieb as a research scientist at the renowned and extremely well-funded McGurk Institute in New York. Meanwhile, Leora miscarries and cannot have any more children, so she devotes herself to her husband&#x27;s career.

After two fallow years at McGurk, Arrowsmith stumbles onto an antibiotic serum that he does not understand (and is unsure how he produced), yet has demonstrated the ability to kill at least one type of germ. He shortly is able to replicate it, and in order to study its efficacy on other microbes is sent to the West Indies, where a virulent outbreak of bubonic plague has arisen. He is coincidentally teamed with a popular Swedish lecturer on &quot;Heroes of Health&quot; he once met while still in South Dakota, Dr. Gustav Sondelius, who is extremely enthusiastic over both the team and the serum&#x27;s prospects to help cure the disease. Leora accompanies her husband, despite his fear for her safety. 

Arrowsmith has strict instructions from Gottlieb to employ the scientific method in his efforts, conducting a blind study by administering the serum to one-half his patients and a placebo injection to the other. Upon learning of this, the West Indies governor, Sir Robert Fairland, refuses to allow him to proceed. Seeking to break the impasse, black Dr. Oliver Marchand suggests Arrowsmith conduct his experiment in a backwater community on a neighboring island where the infection is rampant. Arrowsmith agrees, insisting Leora stay behind for her own protection. The study begins. Among those seeking an inoculation of Arrowsmith&#x27;s serum is Mrs. Joyce Lanyon, a New York socialite stranded on the island. They are attracted to each other, though their subsequent affair is only hinted at obliquely.

Sondelius contracts the disease. In his death throes, he pleads with Arrowsmith to abandon scientific protocol and save as many lives as possible. Concerned about his wife&#x27;s welfare, Arrowsmith asks Marchand to check on her upon his return to the main island, only to have his colleague die while on the phone before he can give his report. Arrowsmith races home, but Leora is dead. In a drunken delirium, he gives the serum to all, saving the Indies from the plague. Upon his return to New York, he is hailed by the press and feted by McGurk Institute head Dr. Tubbs, who seeks to take advantage of Arrowsmith&#x27;s glory. Arrowsmith instead rushes directly to Gottlieb.

Desperate to explain his abandonment of research principles and his mentor&#x27;s specific mandate to advance science rather than practice medicine, Arrowsmith discovers that Gottlieb has had a stroke, is insensible, and near death. Disgusted with all that is transpiring, friend and colleague Terry Wickett, a prominent chemist at the Institute, announces abruptly that he is quitting to set up his own &quot;shoestring&quot; laboratory to pursue science. Turning his back on public adulation, a promotion, and a big raise, Arrowsmith resigns to join forces with Wickett. Joyce Lanyon appears, seeking to rekindle their relationship, but he spurns her, committing himself to his career.

==Cast==
*Ronald Colman as Dr Martin Arrowsmith
*Helen Hayes as Leora Arrowsmith
*Richard Bennett as Gustav Sondelius
*A.E. Anson as Professor Max Gottlieb
*Clarence Brooks as Oliver Marchand
*Alec B. Francis as Twyford
*Claude King as Dr. Tubbs 
*Bert Roach as Bert Tozer
*Myrna Loy as Mrs Joyce Lanyon
*Russell Hopton as Terry Wickett
*David Landau as State Veterinarian
*Lumsden Hare as Sir Robert Fairland – Governor
*Ward Bond as Cop (uncredited)
*John Qualen as Henry Novak (uncredited)

==Production==
The film is only somewhat faithful to the novel, among other significant changes omitting Arrowsmith&#x27;s serial womanizing, and completely skipping all mention of Arrowsmith&#x27;s wealthy, self-centered second wife. Myrna Loy has only a few scenes with Colman, and their relationship is undeveloped to the point of being indecipherable. According to Robert Osborne, host of Turner Classic Movies, Helen Hayes claimed that as filming went on various scenes were dropped from the script without explanation. It is claimed that Samuel Goldwyn had hired director John Ford on condition that he not drink during the production.

==Reception==
The film was a financial and critical success. It was nominated for four Academy Awards, including for Best Picture, Best Writing, Adaptation (Howard), Best Art Direction (Richard Day) and Best Cinematography (Ray June).

<text>Brian Baker (born February 25, 1965) is an American punk rock musician. He is best known as one of the founding members of the hardcore punk band Minor Threat, and as a guitarist in Bad Religion since 1994. In Minor Threat, he originally played bass guitar before switching to guitar in 1982 when Steve Hansgen joined the band, and then moved back to bass after Hansgen&#x27;s departure. He also founded Dag Nasty in 1985, was part of the original line-up of Samhain, and has had stints in Doggy Style, The Meatmen (with fellow Minor Threat member Lyle Preslar), Government Issue, and Junkyard (a hard rock band).

In 1994 Baker was offered a spot as a touring musician with R.E.M. but declined, opting instead to accept a position in Bad Religion as Brett Gurewitz&#x27;s replacement. He also experimented with a more pop direction influenced by U2, with a band called 400. Baker briefly toured with Me First and the Gimme Gimmes in 2005 and appeared on Canadian punk band Penelope&#x27;s second album (&quot;Face au silence du monde&quot;). He has been a frequent guest guitarist on many songs and albums by artists as varied as Blood Bats, Tesco Vee, Ric Ocasek, Teenage Time Killers, Mind Over Four, Dangerous Toys, Pollen Art, Unwritten Law, Travis Cut, Lickity Split, Hot Water Music, Down By Law, Bash &amp; Pop, Middle Aged Brigade, Careless, and many others.

The supergroup Foxhall Stacks, composed of Baker, Bill Barbot (Jawbox), Peter Moffett (Burning Airlines, Government Issue), and Jim Spellman (High Back Chairs, Velocity Girl) released their debut album, &quot;The Coming Collapse&quot;, in 2019. Another supergroup, Fake Names, formed with vocalist Dennis Lyxzén (Refused, The (International) Noise Conspiracy, INVSN), guitarist Michael Hampton (S.O.A., Embrace, One Last Wish), bassist Johnny Temple (Girls Against Boys, Soulside), and drummer Matt Schulz (Enon, Lab Partners, Holy Fuck), began touring in 2018 and released a self-titled debut album in 2020.

<text>Airline timetables are printed pamphlets or folders that many airlines have traditionally used to inform passengers of several different things, such as schedules, fleet, security, in-flight entertainment, food menus, baggage weight restrictions, and contact information.

Airline timetables used to be printed, multi-page pamphlets available at airport counters, or upon request by phone or mail. On January 16, 1928, Pan Am published one of their first timetables. It read &quot;The air-way to Havana, Pan American Airways, Pershing Square Building, New York&quot;. 

Many airline timetables had colorful covers. The timetables of very small airlines, such as Scenic Airways, consisted of one sheet of paper, with their hub&#x27;s flight time information on the front, and the return times on the back. 
In recent years, most airlines have stopped production of printed timetables, in order to cut costs and reduce the delay between a change of schedule and a new timetable being in the hands of the public. As a consequence, most airlines now post their timetables only online (the larger airlines often offering a stand-alone application, while others provide just a downloadable document such as a PDF), and the value of many printed airline timetable has risen among collectors.

<doc id="378446" wikidata="Q747112" url="?curid=378446" title="Dag Nasty">
<text>Dag Nasty is an American hardcore punk band from Washington D.C., formed in 1985 by guitarist Brian Baker of Minor Threat, drummer Colin Sears and bassist Roger Marbury, both of Bloody Mannequin Orchestra, and vocalist Shawn Brown (later of Swiz and Jesuseater). Their style of less aggressive, melodic hardcore was influential to post-hardcore. Their influences include U2, particularly their debut album &quot;Boy&quot; (1980) the Damned, Descendents, Buzzcocks, and the Clash.

== History ==
Shawn Brown was the first vocalist with whom the band recorded unreleased versions of most of the material that later made up their first release &quot;Can I Say&quot;, which featured former roadie and new singer Dave Smalley of DYS. Dave left the band to attend grad school at New York University before a summer tour with The Descendents. A new singer, Peter Cortner, was found after the band placed an ad in a local paper and the tour was kept. After touring half the US opening for The Descendents, the band went home and recorded new material that wasn&#x27;t released until years later. After a few more local shows, the band broke up in the fall of 1986. Brian went to L.A. to start a new band with Doug Carrion and half of Doggy Style called Doggie Rock. After releasing one album under the Doggie Style name, Doggie Rock broke up and Brian reformed Dag Nasty in early 1987 with Peter, Colin and Doug replacing Roger Marbury, who declined to rejoin. Months later, the band recorded and released &quot;Wig Out at Denko&#x27;s&quot;, including rerecorded versions of the late 1986 tape and new material.

In 1988, the band released their album &quot;Field Day&quot; on Giant Records, which was distributed by Dutch East India Trading. It was an ambitious album, often generating sharply polarised appraisals from fans: many hated it and many loved it. &quot;Field Day&quot; attempted to blend pop melodies with hardcore and metal riffs even further than previously attempted on &quot;Wig Out&quot;. The result was, at times, uneven but helped to usher in a new style of hardcore with more controlled playing, guitar effects, acoustic elements and slower tempos. The band split up shortly after touring for &quot;Field Day&quot; ended.

In 1992, Dag Nasty reformed with Smalley on vocals and released the album &quot;Four on the Floor&quot;. In 1991, Selfless Records had released &quot;85-86&quot;, a collection of early, pre-&quot;Can I Say&quot; recordings.

In 2002, the band got back together, again with Smalley on the mic, returning the band to a hardcore sound. The result of this reunion was the album &quot;Minority of One&quot;. To this day they still release records, though Dag Nasty remains more of a side project for its members than a full-time active band. Cortner, who has not been involved with the band directly for years, completed his education as a lawyer, practiced law and recently became a schoolteacher. While strictly as a personal hobby now, Cortner has continued to make music under the names GPFA and, more recently, in a collaboration with Philadelphia area musicians entitled The Gerunds. He and Doug Carrion also have a project called Field Day where they perform songs from Cortner&#x27;s era of Dag Nasty records. Sears went on to play in The Marshes and later after moving to Portland, Oregon for Handgun Bravado and The Valley Floor. He also works as a city planner for the Portland Development Commission. The other members of the band have remained involved in music.

Baker joined Bad Religion after Brett Gurewitz left to focus on his own record label (Epitaph Records) and continued to play in the band when Gurewitz rejoined.

In 2009, Brian Baker said he wanted to make a new Dag Nasty record with Peter Cortner.
&quot;We want to do another record with Peter singing at some point and that will be the next one we do. I&#x27;ve spoken with Colin and Roger and they want to do it with Peter next time. Maybe a year from now, who knows? Whenever people are available. The one thing about Peter is that he&#x27;s a really good lyricist. That&#x27;s always been his strong point&quot;

In October 2012, Dag Nasty announced a reunion show in Washington DC with their original singer, Shawn Brown. On December 28, 2012, the original Dag Nasty line up played the Black Cat in support of the upcoming documentary &quot;Salad Days: The DC Punk Revolution&quot;. The bill also featured Government Issue, another Washington DC punk reunion.

The group was reformed again in 2015. It was announced that year on May 30, 2016, Dag Nasty will tour Europe in the spring of 2016 and play the Punk Rock Bowling Music Festival in Las Vegas, and on June 11 in Asbury Park, New Jersey. A new 7 inch single will be released on Dischord Records in May 2016.

<text>Arrowsmith is a novel by American author Sinclair Lewis, first published in 1925. It won the 1926 Pulitzer Prize (which Lewis declined). Lewis was greatly assisted in its preparation by science writer Paul de Kruif, who received 25% of the royalties on sales, although Lewis was listed as the sole author. 

&quot;Arrowsmith&quot; is an early major novel dealing with the culture of science. It was written in the period after the reforms of medical education flowing from the Flexner Report on &quot;Medical Education in the United States and Canada: A Report to the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching&quot;, 1910, which had called on medical schools in the United States to adhere to mainstream science in their teaching and research.

The book was adapted by Hollywood as &quot;Arrowsmith&quot; in 1931, starring Ronald Colman and Helen Hayes.

==Plot==
&quot;Arrowsmith&quot; tells the story of bright and scientifically minded Martin Arrowsmith of Elk Mills, Winnemac (the same fictional state in which several of Lewis&#x27;s other novels are set), as he makes his way from a small town in the Midwest to the upper echelons of the scientific community at a prestigious foundation in New York City. Along the way he begins medical school. He becomes engaged to one woman, cheats on her with another woman, becomes engaged to the second woman and then finally invites both women to a lunch to settle the issue. He eventually insults his mentor, Max Gottlieb, and is suspended from school. He takes up life as an ordinary worker, then marries Leora with her family supporting him based on the promise that he will take up private practice as the only doctor in tiny Wheatsylvania, North Dakota. Frustrated with the work, he moves on to a job at the state Department of Public Health branch in Nautilus, Iowa, then becomes romantically involved with the young daughter of its local director. After a series of political disputes, he resigns and joins the staff of an exclusive private hospital in Chicago. Finally, Arrowsmith is recognized by his former mentor, Gottlieb, for a scientific paper he has written, and is invited to take a post with a wealthy and elite research institute in New York City. The book&#x27;s climax deals with Arrowsmith&#x27;s discovery of a phage that destroys bacteria and his experiences as he faces an outbreak of bubonic plague on a fictional Caribbean island.

His scientific principles demand that he avoid its mass use on the Island until thoroughly tested, even at the expense of lives that might be saved. Only after his wife, Leora, and all the other people who came with him from the institute to the island die of plague, does he reluctantly abandon rigorous science and begins to treat everyone on the island with the phage. While there he becomes romantically involved with a wealthy socialite, whom he later marries. In spite of his life-saving, he regards his actions on the island as a complete betrayal of science and his principles.

Upon his return to New York he is heralded as a public hero for his actions on the island. He is first promoted within the laboratory and then offered the directorship of the entire institute. He turns down the promotion, then abandons his new wife and infant son to work in the backwoods of Vermont as an entirely independent scientist. When his wife finally offers to move to Vermont to be close to him, he tells her that he wants nothing to do with her and she should just go away.

==Themes==
The book contains considerable social commentary on the state and prospects of medicine in the United States in the 1920s. Arrowsmith is a progressive, even something of a rebel, and often challenges the existing state of affairs when he finds it wanting.

This novel has been inspirational for several generations of pre-medical and medical students. There is much agonizing along the way concerning career and life decisions. While detailing Arrowsmith&#x27;s pursuit of the noble ideals of medical research for the benefit of mankind and of selfless devotion to the care of patients, Lewis throws many less noble temptations and self-deceptions in Arrowsmith&#x27;s path. The attractions of financial security, recognition, even wealth and power, lure Arrowsmith away from following the footsteps of his first mentor, the brilliant but abrasive bacteriologist Max Gottlieb.

In the course of the novel Lewis describes many aspects of medical training, medical practice, scientific research, scientific fraud, medical ethics, public health, and personal/professional conflicts that are still relevant today. Professional jealousy, institutional pressures, greed, stupidity, and negligence are all satirically depicted, and Arrowsmith himself is exasperatingly self-involved. But there is also tireless dedication, and respect for the scientific method and intellectual honesty.

Martin Arrowsmith shares some biographical elements with Félix d&#x27;Herelle, who is identified in the novel as a co-discoverer of the bacteriophage and represented as having beaten Arrowsmith into publication with his results. 

Because of its detailed and gripping portrayal of experimental laboratory research as a practice, a profession, an ideology, a worldview, and a “prominent strand in modern culture, a way of life”, &quot;Arrowsmith&quot; is generally acknowledged as a classic &#x27;science novel&#x27;, focusing on moral dilemmas bio-medical researchers may encounter. Educator and school founder Lisa VanDamme describes using the ethical challenges and world outlook presented in Arrowsmith: “…I might give one class about the idealistic characters and in what way they are doomed to suffering in the world, another about those who abandon their ideals and achieve practical ‘success,’ another about the basic moral-practical dichotomy this implies, and another contrasting this view with that of…[other novelists].”

&quot;Arrowsmith&quot; has been compared with &quot;The Citadel&quot;, published in 1937 by A. J. Cronin, which also deals with the experiences of a young idealistic doctor who tries to challenge and improve the existing system of medical practice.

Sinclair’s scientific collaborator Paul de Kruif drew inspiration for locations and characters in &quot;Arrowsmith&quot; from specific sources. The laboratory work and experimental process of Max Gottlieb was based on the careers of Frederick George Novy and Jacques Loeb. Loeb and De Kruif both worked at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in New York, and Novy was De Kruif&#x27;s longtime mentor.

A writer in Public Health Reports commented in 2001 that the novel predicted many of the successes and problems affecting today&#x27;s medical profession, such as the competing needs and goals of clinicians and medical scientists; commercial interests of pharmaceutical companies developing new medications and vaccines versus the need to seek for scientific truth; political and social difficulties in developing programs for protecting a community&#x27;s public health; and the doctor&#x27;s evolving role in American society.

Scholars have found eerie parallels to the COVID-19 crisis in the 1925 novel, and the many ethical dilemmas and challenges it presents.

==Pulitzer Prize==
Arrowsmith was awarded the 1926 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, but Lewis declined the award. In a letter to the committee, he wrote:

&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that, according to observers, the real reason was that Lewis was still upset that &quot;Main Street&quot; did not win the prize in 1921.

==Film, radio and television adaptations==
The book&#x27;s only theatrically released adaptation was the film &quot;Arrowsmith&quot; in 1931, featuring Ronald Colman and Helen Hayes as Arrowsmith and Leora, and Myrna Loy as socialite Mrs. Joyce Lanyon. It was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Adapted Screenplay.

&quot;Lux Radio Theater&quot; presented a one-hour radio adaptation on October 25, 1937, starring Spencer Tracy and Fay Wray.

Helen Hayes reprised her role as Leora in an hour-long adaptation on &quot;The Campbell Playhouse&quot; radio program along with Orson Welles as Arrowsmith. The program aired on February 3, 1939.

&quot;Cavalcade of America&quot; presented a version on February 23, 1942, with Tyrone Power in the title role.

In the 1950s and &#x27;60s, the book was adapted several times for television, and condensed versions of the story were produced for such television shows as &quot;Kraft Television Theater&quot; and &quot;DuPont Show of the Month&quot;.

A Czech mini-series was produced in 1999, with Jan Stastny in the title role and Tereza Brodská as &quot;Leora Tozerova&quot;.

It is a popular myth that the rock band Aerosmith took its name from this book. Although the members were required to read this book in school, they have repeatedly and adamantly denied any connection. In fact, the name was initially rejected because they thought drummer Joey Kramer got the name from the Lewis novel. When he explained the different spelling and that the name came to him while listening to Harry Nilsson&#x27;s album &quot;Aerial Ballet&quot;, the name was accepted by the other members.

<text>Osaka Bay (大阪湾 &quot;Ōsaka-wan&quot; ) is a bay in western Japan. As an eastern part of the Seto Inland Sea, it is separated from the Pacific Ocean by the Kii Channel and from the neighbor western part of the Inland Sea by the Akashi Strait. Its western shore is formed by Awaji Island, and its northern and eastern shores are part of the Kansai metropolitan area.

Major ports on Osaka Bay include Osaka, Kobe, Nishinomiya, Sakai, Amagasaki, and Hannan.

A number of artificial islands have been created in Osaka Bay in past decades, including Kansai International Airport, Kobe Airport, Port Island, and Rokkō Island. In antiquity, Osaka Bay stretched almost to Kyoto, Naniwa, Osaka&#x27;s oldest settlement, itself a peninsula in the bay.

Several islands at the south end of Osaka Bay are part of the Seto Inland Sea National Park.

Industries locate around Osaka Bay because there is a skilled and plentiful workforce, many port facilities, efficient linkages (from small to medium to large firms). There are good transport links (including the Shinkansen), room for expansion (land reclaimed from the sea), and a large local market (9 million).

In a recent economic change in Osaka Bay, older &#x27;heavy&#x27; industries such as Nippon Steel have declined, and &#x27;new tech&#x27; companies such as ICT have expanded. There has been a growth in the quaternary industries — research, development, and information. There has also been a development in the science parks and the building of new motorways; this has meant the loss of the countryside.

The Tempozan Ferris Wheel and Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan are both located in the Tempozan Harbor Village area of Osaka.

<doc id="378452" wikidata="Q520189" url="?curid=378452" title="Louis de Freycinet">
<text>Louis Claude de Saulces de Freycinet (7 August 1779 – 18 August 1841) was a French Navy officer. He circumnavigated the Earth, and in 1811 published the first map to show a full outline of the coastline of Australia.

==Biography==
He was born at Montélimar, Drôme. Louis-Claude de Saulces de Freycinet was his full name (many calling him Louis de Freycinet). His mother was Élisabeth-Antoinette-Catherine Armand. He had three brothers, Louis-Henri de Saulces de Freycinet, André-Charles de Saulces de Freycinet and the youngest, Frédéric-Casimir de Saulces de Freycinet (father of Charles de Freycinet). Louis-Claude was the second oldest.

In 1793 he joined the French Navy as a midshipman, and took in several engagements against the British. In 1800, Freycinet was appointed to an exploration expedition to Southern and South-Western coasts of Australia under Nicolas Baudin, on &quot;Naturaliste&quot; and &quot;Géographe&quot;. Freycinet&#x27;s brother, Louis-Henri de Freycinet, was also part of the expedition.

Between September 1802 and August 1803, Freycinet captained the schooner &quot;Casuarina&quot;, surveying the Australian coastline. He then transferred to &quot;Naturaliste&quot;, and returned to France in 1804. Matthew Flinders was being held captive by the French on Mauritius, thus many of his discoveries were revisited and unintendedly claimed by François Péron, and new names were given by this expedition. In 1824, it was remedied in the second edition of &quot;Voyage découvertes aux terres australes&quot;. In the end, Baudin and Freycinet managed to have their map of the Australian coastline published in 1811, three years before Flinders published his. An inlet on the coast of Western Australia is called Freycinet Estuary. Cape Freycinet between Cape Leeuwin and Cape Naturaliste and the Freycinet Peninsula with Freycinet National Park in Tasmania also bear the explorer&#x27;s name.
In 1805, he returned to Paris, and was entrusted by the government with the work of preparing the maps and plans of the expedition. He also completed the narrative, and the whole work appeared under the title of &quot;Voyage de découvertes aux terres australes&quot; (Paris, 1807–1816).

The plant genus &quot;Freycinetia&quot; (Pandanaceae) was named in his honor, as was the Hawaiian native tree/shrub &quot;Santalum freycinetianum&quot;.

===Circumnavigation on &quot;Uranie&quot;===

In 1817, he was given command of the French corvette &quot;Uranie&quot; (1811), especially reconfigured to a new exploration voyage. &quot;Uranie&quot; carried several members of the Navy scientific staff, notably marine hydrologist Louis Isidore Duperrey, artist Jacques Arago, and his junior draughtsman Adrien Taunay the Younger.

&quot;Uranie&quot; sailed to Rio de Janeiro by December 1817, taking a series of pendulum measurements gather information in the fields of geography, ethnology, astronomy, terrestrial magnetism, meteorology, and for collecting specimens in natural history. Freycinet also managed to sneak his wife Rose de Freycinet aboard.

For three years, Freycinet cruised about the Pacific, visiting Australia twice (1818 and 1819), New Guinea (1818-1819), the Mariana Islands (early 1819), Hawaiian Islands (August 1819) other Pacific islands, South America, and other places. Notwithstanding the loss of &quot;Uranie&quot; on the Falkland Islands during the return voyage, Freycinet returned to France with fine collections in all departments of natural history, and with voluminous notes and drawings of the countries visited.

The results of this voyage were published under Freycinet&#x27;s supervision, with the title of &quot;Voyage autour du monde fait par ordre du Roi sur les corvettes de S. M. l&#x27;Uranie et la Physicienne, pendant les années 1817, 1818, 1819 et 1820&quot;, in 13 quarto volumes and 4 folio volumes of plates and maps.

Freycinet was admitted into the French Academy of Sciences in 1825, and was one of the founders of the Paris Geographical Society. He died at the family&#x27;s château de Freycinet near Saulce-sur-Rhône, Drôme.

<doc id="378453" wikidata="Q1660782" url="?curid=378453" title="In the Aeroplane Over the Sea">
<text>In the Aeroplane Over the Sea is the second and final studio album by the American band Neutral Milk Hotel, released on February 10, 1998, by Merge Records. The album is predominantly indie rock and psychedelic folk and is characterized by an intentionally low-quality sound. Traditional indie rock instruments like the guitar and drums are paired with less conventional instruments like the singing saw and uilleann pipes. The lyrics are surrealistic and opaque, exploring themes that range from nostalgia to love. An important influence for the album was &quot;The Diary of a Young Girl&quot;, a book of writings from the diary of Anne Frank.

&quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot; was recorded at Pet Sounds Studio from July to September1997. Producer Robert Schneider worked with bandleader Jeff Mangum to improve upon the low-quality sound of Neutral Milk Hotel&#x27;s debut album, &quot;On Avery Island&quot;. Instead of using standard studio equipment like guitar pedals or effects units to induce distortion, Schneider developed a recording technique that involved heavy compression. To promote the album, Neutral Milk Hotel undertook a tour of North America and Europe, and developed a reputation for chaotic and physically demanding performances.

Contemporary reviews were moderately positive; over time, however, the album developed a cult following. The band became more well known and started touring more, which negatively affected Mangum, whose mental health began to deteriorate. He eventually withdrew from touring, and Neutral Milk Hotel went on hiatus shortly after. In the years since its release, &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot; has been described by music journalists as both a landmark album for indie rock and as one of the best albums of the 1990s and its critical standing has risen considerably.

== Background ==

Neutral Milk Hotel originated in Ruston, Louisiana, in the late 1980s, as a home-recording project of high school student Jeff Mangum. Initially called &quot;Milk&quot;, Mangum shared the recordings he created with his friends and fellow musicians Robert Schneider, Bill Doss, and Will Cullen Hart, and the four began producing music together. The group started branding their respective homemade cassette tapes with &quot;The Elephant 6 Recording Co.&quot;, a then-imaginary record label which later grew into a loose musical collective. After graduating from high school, Mangum released the single &quot;Everything Is&quot; on Cher Doll Records under the alias &quot;Neutral Milk Hotel&quot;. The single&#x27;s exposure convinced Mangum to record more music under this name. He moved to Denver and worked with Schneider to record the 1996 album &quot;On Avery Island&quot;. Although Schneider was interested in what he described as &quot;high-art Beatlesque production,&quot; he aligned with Mangum&#x27;s preference for a low-quality sound called lo-fi, admitting that &quot;at first it was frustrating, but I came to enjoy it. That&#x27;s how I learned to produce, doing that record, because I totally had to let go of what I thought it should be like.&quot;

After the release of &quot;On Avery Island&quot;, Mangum recruited three musicians to tour with: Julian Koster, Jeremy Barnes, and Scott Spillane. The North American tour in support of &quot;On Avery Island&quot; generated enough money to enable the quartet to move to Athens, Georgia, which was considered a hub for alternative rock and new wave musicians. By mid-1997, Mangum had written and demoed nearly every song for &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot;. He shared the demos with his bandmates before they moved back to Denver, where Schneider&#x27;s studio was located, to record the album.

== Recording ==
&quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot; was produced by Schneider, and was recorded from July to September1997. It was recorded at Pet Sounds Studio in Denver, the home of Schneider&#x27;s friend Jim McIntyre. Schneider paid half the rent for access to every room in the house except McIntyre&#x27;s bedroom. The recording sessions for &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot; coincided with several other sessions. Schneider was already producing the Minders&#x27; album &quot;Hooray for Tuesday&quot; when Neutral Milk Hotel members began to arrive, and decided to halt production until &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot; was finished. McIntyre was recording the Von Hemmling song &quot;My Country &#x27;Tis of Thee&quot; in his bedroom while the band members played, and whenever Koster was not needed, he would work on songs for his experimental pop music and performance art project the Music Tapes, such as &quot;Television Tells Us&quot; and &quot;Aliens&quot;.

Schneider separated the band members into different rooms, but always kept Mangum close to the control room in case he wanted to plug Mangum&#x27;s acoustic guitar into a four-track cartridge. Schneider occasionally tried using an electric guitar, however he wiped these recordings as he felt that they did not have Mangum&#x27;s distinctive sound. As the sessions progressed, Schneider wanted to find a way to record the acoustic sound into a microphone instead of into the cartridge. He decided to record the sound through Neumann U 87 microphones. According to Scheider: &quot;[Mangum] liked an acoustic plugged in because he kinda found it fuzzy and raw, like an electric guitar, but it had a strummy quality to it, too ... I had developed an acoustic guitar sound on my own that he was really happy with by the second record, and I think it&#x27;s really good.&quot;

Neutral Milk Hotel biographer Kim Cooper believes &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot; is one of the most heavily distorted albums ever made, but also notes the lack of equipment such as Big Muffs or distortion pedals. Mangum liked having a layer of distortion over the music, but Schneider decided to not use standard effects equipment. Instead, Schneider used heavy compression and placed a Bellari RP-220 tube preamplifier close to his guitar. Schneider then ran the sound through a mixing console and maximised the sound on a cassette tape. This process was done for nearly every instrument used on &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot;. Schneider claimed that the nonlinearities of microphone distortion gave the album its unique &quot;warm&quot; quality.

The horn arrangements were primarily written by Schneider. He wrote these parts on a piano or organ, then conferred with trombonist Rick Benjamin to ensure the musical notation was correct. Spillane was the last band member to arrive, so Schneider showed him the arrangements he had already written. The trumpets were written in treble clef, but as Spillane could only read bass clef, he had to rewrite these arrangements before he could learn them. As he did while learning the songs for &quot;On Avery Island&quot;, Spillane spent hours every day practicing and writing more arrangements in the basement. Toward the end of the recording sessions, Schneider and Spillane worked together to combine their differing arrangements. Schneider&#x27;s parts were more melancholic while Spillane wrote chaotic and boisterous parts.

== Composition ==
=== Music ===

&quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot; is difficult to categorize into a specific genre. Critics generally describe it as indie rock and psychedelic folk with a lo-fi sound, but also note the wide range of influences, including Eastern European choral music, Canterbury Sound, circus music, musique concrète, drone music, free jazz, and Tropicália. Jason Ankeny of AllMusic compared the album to a &quot;marching band on an acid trip&quot;, while Kim Cooper wrote: &quot;the music is like nothing else in the 90s underground&quot;. Part of the musical variance comes from the instruments used on the album. Traditional indie rock instruments like the guitar and drums are paired with less conventional instruments like the shortwave radio, singing saw, and uilleann pipes.

Jeff Mangum&#x27;s guitars are a key component for much of the album. Mangum often plays simple chord progressions, which Erik Himmelsbach of &quot;Spin&quot; compared to the &#x27;50s progression. Other important aspects to the music include the heavy amount of distortion, as well as the multitrack recording method Schneider used for the majority of the instruments. Ankeny described &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot; as having a greater emphasis on structure and texture; he further noted that, like &quot;On Avery Island&quot;, &quot;the songs run continuously together&quot;. The overall sound of the album sometimes abruptly shifts from track to track. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; noted the range of musical styles present, such as slow funeral marches and fast-paced punk rock. Critic Chris DeVille wrote: &quot;On the musical axis, Neutral Milk Hotel veered from piercingly intimate psychedelic campfire sing-alongs to full-band segments that barreled ahead with haphazard grace.&quot;

=== Lyrics ===
Mangum wrote the lyrics for every track on &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot;. The lyrics are surreal and often reference seemingly unrelated subject matter. Cooper cites the opening track &quot;King of Carrot Flowers, Pt. One&quot; as an example of this style of songwriting. While the lyrics are about childhood fantasies, there are references to sexual awakenings, domestic violence, religious fanaticism, and tarot card readings. Fans and journalists have long argued over the exact meaning of the album. Some listeners believe there is a central message found throughout the lyrics, while other listeners believe the album is too abstract to derive meaning from. DeVille said: &quot;[&quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot;] collides the familiar and the disorienting in a way that renders meaning elusive even as it provokes intense emotional reckoning.&quot;

Common lyrical themes include childhood and nostalgia. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; Mark Richardson wrote that the lyrics are written with childlike wonder, in which mundane interactions are illustrated as fantastical moments, stating, &quot;It&#x27;s like a children&#x27;s book or a fairy tale, &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot; on wax.&quot; Mangum&#x27;s lyrics have also been seen as a depiction of adolescence, and the need to develop one&#x27;s own identity. Some critics have compared the album to a coming-of-age story. Mangum&#x27;s descriptions of these experiences evoke a sense of nostalgia. According to Richardson: &quot;it&#x27;s an album of memories and associations, how skin feels against the grass and what passes through your mind the first time you realize your own powerlessness. It puts ultimate faith in raw feelings, the kind that consume you without logic or sense.&quot;

Love is another prominent lyrical theme, although this concept takes on different forms. P. J. Sauerteig of &quot;PopMatters&quot; believes &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot; central message is Mangum&#x27;s longing desire to be loved by the people he idolizes, whether that be a love interest or his peers. The lyrics sometimes seem to describe how Mangum wants to physically merge with the things he loves, which symbolizes a need for interconnectedness with loved ones. Sauerteig cites the track &quot;Two-Headed Boy&quot; as an example of this concept, and states the lyrics are a metaphor for two people who unsuccessfully merged into one body and, as a result, feel like they are trapped in an interdependent relationship.

Although there is little concrete information as to the genesis of some of the lyrics, Mangum has stated a major influence was Anne Frank, a teenage girl who died in a Nazi concentration camp. Before recording &quot;On Avery Island&quot;, Mangum read &quot;The Diary of a Young Girl&quot;, a book of writings from Frank&#x27;s diary that she kept while in hiding during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands. He was deeply affected by the book and spent, in his own words, &quot;about three days crying&quot;, having dreams of traveling back in time and saving her. Tracks such as &quot;Holland,1945&quot; and &quot;Ghost&quot; incorporate elements of Anne Frank&#x27;s life into the lyrics. As a result, some listeners have labeled &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot; as a concept album. However, Frank&#x27;s importance to the lyrics is a subject of debate. Some critics argue she is merely an inspiration for some of the tracks, as opposed to an important character within a narrative arc. Writing about the Anne Frank connection, Anwen Crawford of &quot;The Monthly&quot; said: &quot;It would be overly literal ... to describe &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot; as an album about the Holocaust, for Frank is only one of many phantasms to populate a set of looping, interlinked narratives that proceed with the closed logic of a dream or a religious vision.&quot;

== Artwork ==

The front cover contains a drawing of four bathers out at sea in what is presumed to be the early 1900s. Three are swimming in the water while one, who is wearing a red dress and has a drumhead instead of a face, sits atop a dock. The back cover shows a drawing of marching band members wearing stilts, led by a short bandmaster. Both illustrations were created by Chris Bilheimer, who at the time was designing artwork for the band R.E.M. Mangum met Bilheimer while living in Athens, and asked him to create the artwork for Neutral Milk Hotel&#x27;s upcoming album. Mangum was interested in imagery associated with early 20th-century penny arcades, and would often buy postcards from thrift shops that featured this style. One postcard in particular featured bathers at sea, which Bilheimer cropped and slightly altered to form the album cover.

In addition to Bilheimer&#x27;s drawings, New York multimedia artist Brian Dewan created the interior artwork found within physical copies of &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot;. Dewan&#x27;s best-known piece for the album is a black-and-white sketch of a flying phonograph over an industrial plant. Dewan had previously been commissioned by Koster to make the artwork for the Music Tapes demos. When Mangum asked Dewan for artwork, he was provided with two sketches: a magic radio, and a flying phonograph, the latter of which was chosen. To give the disparate drawings a cohesive look, Bilheimer scanned the back of the postcard and overlaid the images over it, which made the drawings look the same age, with an effect of slow decay. Bilheimer then splashed dirt on the album cover just above the female character&#x27;s outstretched arm.

== Release and tour ==
&quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot; was released in the United States on February 10, 1998, by Merge Records, and in the United Kingdom in May1998 by The Blue Rose Record Company. Merge pressed 5,500 CD and 1,600 vinyl copies, and expected sales to be similar to &quot;On Avery Island&quot;, which had sold around 5,000 copies. These initial projections were correct, as the album sold moderately well for the first few months. The song &quot;Holland,1945&quot; was released as a 7&quot; single on October 13, 1998.

To promote the album, Neutral Milk Hotel embarked on a tour of North America and Europe. Musicians John Fernandes and Will Westbrook were brought on as touring members, and were taught how to play the horn parts with Spillane. For the tour, Mangum wanted the band to learn how to play the Charlie Haden track &quot;Song for Che&quot;, a difficult improvisational jazz piece. Although Mangum was expecting a lot out of the newly expanded band, many outsiders noted how caring and nurturing he was toward everyone involved. Filmmaker Lance Bangs said: &quot;He wasn&#x27;t any kind of a taskmaster—never turning and glaring at anybody—it was never like that. Clearly, there was a love of his circle of friends that made it important for him to build this community and bring them along with him.&quot;

While on tour, Neutral Milk Hotel gained a reputation for chaotic and physically demanding concerts. Great Lakes member Ben Crum recalled: &quot;It was definitely dangerous. There often seemed to be a very real chance that someone, probably Julian, would get hurt. Jeff was always doing things like picking him up and throwing him into the drums.&quot; The audio technicians for most venues were confused and did not know what to expect. As a result, Laura Carter took on the unusual role of &quot;mix-board translator&quot;. According to Carter: &quot;It was more like talking them through what was about to happen, because so much was happening onstage that without someone helping, it was a wail or squeal and the soundman would look at twenty instruments onstage and not know what to dive for.&quot;

== Initial reception ==

Initial critical responses to &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot; were moderately positive. In &quot;Spin&quot;, Erik Himmelsbach wrote that Neutral Milk Hotel&#x27;s psychedelic, folk-infused music had set them apart from the indie-pop sound of fellow Elephant 6 bands the Olivia Tremor Control and the Apples in Stereo. Rob Brunner of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; praised the &quot;oddball&quot; instrumentation and &quot;bouncy pop melodies&quot;, but described some of the acoustic songs as &quot;lifeless acoustic warblers&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; M. Christian McDermott also commended the music, which he called a blend of &quot;&quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; with early 90s lo-fi&quot; that he found &quot;as catchy as it is frightening&quot;. Ben Ratliff of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; was more critical of the music. He felt the rhythms and chord changes were boring, while the heavy layer of distortion masked the absence of decent melodies. Ratliff ultimately summarized his review by writing: &quot;&quot;Aeroplane&quot; is thin-blooded, woolgathering stuff.&quot;

The lyrics drew critical attention. Dele Fadele of &quot;NME&quot; described the lyrics as &quot;evocative&quot; and &quot;compelling&quot;. Both Himmelsbach and Ratliff noted the semireligious undertones. Himmelsbach described the lyrics as &quot;darkly comedic and wonderfully wide-eyed&quot;, and commended the stream of consciousness style of songwriting. McDermott also discussed the dark lyrics, and wrote: &quot;[Mangum] inherits a world of cannibalism, elastic sexuality and freaks of nature. We can only assume he likes it there.&quot;

&quot;CMJ New Music Monthly&quot; ranked &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot; as the number one album of 1998, and it placed 15th in the &quot;Village Voice&quot; annual Pazz &amp; Jop poll of American music critics. Despite the album&#x27;s generally positive reception, it was dismissed by critics shortly after its release. In a year-end column accompanying the Pazz &amp; Jop, Robert Christgau dismissed the album as &quot;a funereal jape that &quot;. In a 2016 article, journalist Luke Winkie said the initial reception was &quot;the standard response to a confusing second album from a band without a preexisting pedigree: distant praise, hedged bets, avoiding the heart at all cost&quot;.

== Aftermath ==
=== Breakup and Mangum&#x27;s reclusion ===
After the album&#x27;s release, Neutral Milk Hotel&#x27;s heightened profile had a negative effect on Mangum. In a 2002 interview, Mangum said that &quot;a lot of the basic assumptions [he] held about reality started crumbling&quot;. He would sometimes shut himself inside his home for days on end, and hoarded rice in preparation for the possible Y2K problem. Some journalists have speculated he became tired of touring and constantly explaining his lyrics to fans; Elephant6 biographer Adam Clair believes he may have been overwhelmed by the way fans viewed his music, and the high expectations placed upon any subsequent recordings. Regardless of the reason, Mangum decided that he could not continue performing, and preferred to disappear from the public eye. He did not inform the band, finding it impossible to justify a breakup immediately after their first genuine success, especially since some of them had quit their jobs to join Neutral Milk Hotel. Instead, he avoided the topic of new music altogether and increasingly isolated himself. The situation resulted in the unspoken, unannounced breakup of Neutral Milk Hotel shortly after the tour. The band members remained friends but moved on to other projects. Mangum occasionally worked on music over the next few years—he released &quot;Orange Twin Field Works: Volume I&quot; and played as a touring member of Circulatory System in 2001, and briefly hosted a program for the freeform radio station WFMU in 2002—but kept to himself and released no new songs for Neutral Milk Hotel.

=== Cult following ===
There was no public explanation for the band&#x27;s sudden breakup. &quot;Slate&quot; alleged that some fans were angry or accused Mangum of being selfish, and others wrote hoax blog posts giving fake details of upcoming tours and other false information. The large response helped the album gain a cult following, and converted Mangum into a larger-than-life figure. In 2003, &quot;Creative Loafing&quot; writer Kevin Griffis dedicated a cover story to trying to track down Mangum for personal closure. The search ended when Mangum sent him an email that read: &quot;I&#x27;m not an idea. I am a person, who obviously wants to be left alone.&quot; Journalist Mark Richardson attempted to explain the album&#x27;s rise in popularity: &quot;Because [Mangum] was inaccessible, there was no outlet for connection other than the record itself and other fans who shared a passion. By doing nothing, Neutral Milk Hotel developed a cult.&quot;

Some journalists have noted the release of &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot; coincided with the rise of the Internet. The album, and by extension Neutral Milk Hotel, became common fixtures on online message boards, and early music websites like &quot;Pitchfork&quot; gave the band an increased level of promotion. Winkie wrote: &quot;Would &quot;Aeroplane&quot; occupy the same untouchable place in American indie-rock culture if it was released in 1992? Or 1987? It&#x27;s hard to say. The internet has a one-of-a-kind relationship with Neutral Milk Hotel.&quot; Memes about &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot; proliferated on websites like 4chan, reflecting a wave of &quot;hipster&quot; listeners who first discovered the album online, long after the band had broken up.

=== Critical reevaluation and sales ===
&quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot; critical standing rose in the years after its release. Mark Richardson of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; awarded the 2005 reissue a perfect 10/10 score. Richardson said that although he initially found Mangum&#x27;s infatuation with Anne Frank embarrassing, he grew an appreciation for the lyrics, and called them the album&#x27;s defining characteristic. He highlighted the surrealistic imagery, and wrote: &quot;It&#x27;s a record of images, associations, and threads; no single word describes it so well as the beautiful and overused kaleidoscope.&quot; In the 2004 edition of &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, critic Roni Sarig described the album as &quot;timeless transcendentalist pop steeped in a century of American music, from funeral marches to punk rock...&quot;Aeroplane&quot; is a fragile, creaky, dignified, and ballsy record&quot;. Ankeny wrote that: &quot;Neutral Milk Hotel&#x27;s second album is another quixotic sonic parade; lo-fi yet lush, impenetrable yet wholly accessible&quot;. Ankeny also said the lyrics were too abstract to discern meaning. Marvin Lin of &quot;Tiny Mix Tapes&quot; found it challenging to concisely explain why the album is so great, and ultimately summarized his review with the statement: &quot;As beautiful as it is disturbing, &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot; is a stunning piece of art that draws you deeper with each listen. Most great art takes time to appreciate, and this album is no exception.&quot;

Despite the generally positive critical reevaluation, the album had its detractors. According to Richardson, listeners who dislike the album have often found its lyrics to be awkward, infantile, or disconcerting, and he said Mangum could be perceived as a &quot;privileged dude sharing naive stoner wisdom&quot;. &quot;Grantland&quot; writer Steven Hyden, once an admirer of the album, felt his appreciation diminish over time, which he ascribed in part to the gradual loss of its original mystique. Just as the album itself became a meme, the tendency to lavish it with hyperbolic praise also became an online in-joke, exemplified by a 2015 headline from the satirical website &quot;ClickHole&quot;: &quot;Disgusting: ISIS Just Released a 2-Star Review of &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot;&quot;.

Despite modest sales projections and never charting on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot; had sold over 393,000 copies by 2013, with reported sales of 25,000 copies a year as noted by &quot;Slate&quot; in 2008. &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot; was the sixth-best-selling vinyl record of 2008, and its sales helped contribute to a revitalization of vinyl in the late 2000s. The &quot;33⅓&quot; book about &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot; by author Kim Cooper similarly shares large sales numbers, as it is the second-best-selling entry in the series.

Several websites and magazines have ranked &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot; as one of the greatest indie rock albums of all time, including &quot;Blender&quot; and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;. Some outlets have also ranked it as one of the best albums of the 1990s. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; initially ranked it at number eighty-five on its list of the best albums of the 1990s, but moved the album to number four in its 2003 revised list. &quot;Paste&quot; similarly ranked it highly, placing it at number two, behind Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;OK Computer&quot;. Other websites that placed &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot; in their list of the best albums of the 1990s include Cleveland.com (number twenty) and &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; (number forty-three). &quot;Spin&quot; in 2005 and &quot;Q&quot; in 2010 placed &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot; on their lists of the best albums of the previous twenty-five and thirty years respectively, while &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;NME&quot; ranked it at 376 and 98 on their lists of the 500 greatest albums of all time respectively.

&quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot; has been highly influential. According to &quot;Pitchfork&quot; contributor Mike McGonigal, &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot; disparate genres laid the groundwork for a musical template followed by bands such as Bright Eyes and Six Organs of Admittance. Mangum&#x27;s vocals influenced singers such as Colin Meloy of the Decemberists and Zach Condon of Beirut. Arcade Fire frontman Win Butler said &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot; was a contributing factor to their signing with Merge Records. On the album&#x27;s tenth anniversary, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; published an article in which indie musicians such as Dan Snaith, Tim Kasher, and fellow Elephant6 member Kevin Barnes discussed its importance. Snaith said:

<doc id="378455" wikidata="Q919948" url="?curid=378455" title="Music of Greenland">
<text>The music of Greenland is a mixture of two primary strands, Inuit and Danish, mixed with influences from the United States and United Kingdom.

Greenland&#x27;s musical character has been described as &quot;definitely a rock country, both musically and literally&quot; according to Greenlandic drummer Hans Rosenberg. The Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs describes all Greenlandic music except the drum dances as influenced by external styles.

== Folk music ==
The Inuit and the Danish peoples of Greenland have both maintained their distinct styles of folk music. Country-wide folk traditions included storytelling, which declined greatly after the introduction of the South Greenland Printing Press in 1857.

Traditional music which has best survived European contact can be found in the east and northeast of the island. It includes sacred drum dances played on an oval drum made of a wooden frame with a bear-bladder on top. Drum dances are the &quot;only truly indigenous music&quot; in Greenland, and are part of a roots revival in modern times. Shamans used drums as part of their religious affairs and sometimes organized singing duels between rivals in which the performer who got the most laughs from the audience won. Inuit drum dances were a declining tradition and in modern Greenland are being replaced by amateur theater groups like Silamiut, who used elements of indigenous music with masks, face painting and other techniques.
Piseq are a form of personal song that comment on daily life; these are often handed down from generation to generation. Greenlandic Inuit folk songs are performed to tell stories, play games and tease or charm others.

=== Inuit music ===
The Inuit of Greenland share a musical tradition with related peoples across the Canadian territories of the Yukon, Nunavut and the Northwest Territories, as well as the US state of Alaska and part of eastern Russia. Greenlandic Inuit are part of the Eastern Arctic group; the Eastern Arctic Inuit of Canada and Alaska are part of the same music area as the Central Arctic Inuit, as opposed to the distinct styles of the Western Inuit.

Greenlandic Inuit music is largely based around singing and drums, the latter being generally reserved for large celebrations and other gatherings. Though there is much folk vocal music, there is no Inuit purely instrumental tradition with no accompaniment by singing or dancing. Greenlandic drums are mostly frame drums made of animal skin stretched over a wooden frame and decorated with decorative and symbolic motifs by the drummer. Aside from drums, whistles, bull-roarers and buzzers are also widespread, and the jaw harp and fiddle are both found, most likely recent imports.

Historical recordings of this music are done since 1905. This traditional Greenlandic music is performed also today.

==== Drum dances ====
Greenlandic drum dances are, like the relatives found in Eastern and Central Canada, based around a single dancer who composes songs sung by his family while he dances, usually in a , a snow-house built just for community events such as the drum dance. The men&#x27;s drum dancing skills are evaluated by his endurance in his lengthy performance and the nature of his compositions. Drum dances are an important element of Greenlandic Inuit cultural cohesion, and function as personal expression, pure entertainment and social sanction.

Many drum dances are competitive in nature, featuring two &quot;song cousins&quot; who humorously sing and dance, while pointing out the flaws in the other. This is generally a light-hearted, convivial event, but is also sometimes used to settle serious duels between warring families or individuals; the jokes are prepared ahead of time and the person who evokes the most laughter from the audience is considered the victor.

==== Other Inuit folk song traditions ====
Many Inuit folk games revolve around song as well, including string games, hide-and-seek, juggling and rhymes and riddles. The katajjaq tradition is also well-known; it is a vocal contest between two women, standing facing each other. They sing songs, using throat-singing and imitating animal cries or other sounds. Katajjaq is a game, but is often stopped because both women begin laughing.

In addition to the drum dance and game songs, Greenlandic Inuit have a tradition of (, &quot;personal song&quot;) songs. These are expressive, spiritual, superstitious or narrative and may be composed for drum dances. and other vocal traditions aside from song games include a number of styles and tones, which vary depending on the social context of the performance. For example, a soft vocal tone is used both for character illustration in a narrative song and for personal songs in private settings. Many songs use only a few real words, interspersed among numerous vocables, or non-lexical syllables like . Inuit songs are strophic and mostly use six different pitches; textual and melodic motifs are common. A song&#x27;s word length and accentuation determines the rhythm, giving the songs a recitative-like style.

=== European music ===
With the arrival of Danes, new instruments and forms of European-derived music became popular like the fiddle, accordion and Christian hymns, while Moravian missionaries introduced violins, brass instruments and a tradition of purely instrumental music. The most influential Moravian importation, however, was the polyphonic choir, which has produced popular modern vocal groups like Mik. At some point, pipe organs were introduced to some churches in Greenland, and a number of these instruments can be found scattered around the country, though all are small in comparison to many of the organs found in major churches in Europe and elsewhere. () is a long-standing form of Inuit polka, which produced popular songs and virtuosos like accordion player Louis Andreasen. There is also a modern style called vaigat, which is similar to country music.

== Classical music ==
Some composers of European classical music have Greenlandic themes in their music, including Poul Rovsing Olsen and Adrian Vernon Fish whose output includes over fifty works inspired by Greenland, its terrain, icescapes and music. Among his oeuvre are the four Greenland symphonies (numbers 3, 4, 10 and 13). The modern composer Mads Lumholdt (also member of the orchestra Northern Voices, singer in the orchestra Nowhereland and in No Offence, a vocal band) has become well-known, and his work &quot;Shaman&quot;, which debuted at the 2004-5 Etoiles Polaires Arctic Culture Festival was nominated for the Nordic Council Music Prize for its fusion of traditional Greenlandic music with modern styles and technology. The Nordic describes his work as &quot;seeking to allow the traditional Greenlandic culture to be communicated through contemporary cultural language in such a way that respect for the original culture is preserved on the one hand yet passed on to a broader, contemporary audience on the other hand&quot;.

Greenland&#x27;s national anthem is &quot;Nunarput utoqqarsuanngoravit&quot;, which translates as &quot;Our Country, Who&#x27;s Become So Old&quot;. It has been official since 1916, and was composed by Jonathan Petersen with words by Henrik Lund, both Greenlanders.

== Popular music ==

Greenland was isolated from modern North American and European popular music until well into the mid-20th century. Early popular groups included the pioneering local Nuuk Orleans Jazz Band.

=== Hip hop ===

Since 1984, American hip hop has had a major influence, and a hip hop crew, Nuuk Posse, has been one of the most successful groups of recent years.

=== Rock ===
The Greenlandic rock and pop began in earnest in 1973, when ULO released the band Sume&#x27;s &quot;Sumut&quot;; it was purchased by an estimated twenty percent of Greenland&#x27;s total population, and singlehandedly kickstarted the local rock scene by uniquely singing in the Greenlandic language and using elements of traditional drum dances in the music. The singer Rasmus Lyberth did the most to change Greenlandic music by performing for simple entertainment rather than functionality; indeed, he took part in the Danish preselection for the 1979 Eurovision Song Contest, performing in Greenlandic. Other local performers of note include G-60 and Ole Kristiansen. The 1980s saw Greenland become home to a number of bands inspired by Jamaican reggae and African American funk, like Aalut and Zikaza. Modern Greenland is home to the annual Nipiaa rock festival, held in Aasiaat, and performers like Chilly Friday, throat-singer Sylvia Watt-Cloutier and Karina Moller.

Famous modern rock bands include Kalaat, Siissisoq, Angu Motzfeldt, Pukuut, X-it, Fiassuit, Nanook, Small Time Giants and UltimaCorsa. 

=== Metal ===
A growing metal scene has emerged in Greenland, with black and death metal groups such as The Perfect Mass, Moonlight Drowns, Failed to Failure and Silence.cold.alone. beginning to release music through the 2010s. One early pioneer of Greenlandic Metal is Arctic Spirits, who sing exclusively in the Inuit language.

== Music industry ==
The largest record label in Greenland is ULO, from the town of Sisimiut; it was created by Malik Hoegh and Karsten Sommer. ULO releases both Greenlandic rock bands like Sume, pop singers like Rasmus Lyberth, and hip hop music crews like Nuuk Posse as well as Inuit folk music. Elements of modern Greenlandic music have also been used in the music of Kristian Blak, a Danish-Faroese jazz musician.

Summertime festivals called have become an important part of modern Greenlandic culture, and are based on an older custom that was revived in the 20th century along with drum dances and other elements.

Kalaallit Nunaata Radioa (&quot;Radio Greenland&quot;) is the most important media institution in the country. It is an independent body administered by the Government of Greenland.

<text>The traitorous eight was a group of eight employees who left Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory in 1957 to found Fairchild Semiconductor. William Shockley had in 1956 recruited a group of young Ph.D. graduates with the goal to develop and produce new semiconductor devices. While Shockley had received a Nobel Prize in Physics and was an experienced researcher and teacher, his management of the group was authoritarian and unpopular. This was accentuated by Shockley&#x27;s research focus not proving fruitful. After the demand for Shockley to be replaced was rebuffed, the eight left to form their own company. 

Shockley described their leaving as a &quot;betrayal&quot;. The eight who left Shockley Semiconductor were Julius Blank, Victor Grinich, Jean Hoerni, Eugene Kleiner, Jay Last, Gordon Moore, Robert Noyce, and Sheldon Roberts. In August 1957, they reached an agreement with Sherman Fairchild, and on September 18, 1957, they formed Fairchild Semiconductor. The newly founded Fairchild Semiconductor soon grew into a leader in the semiconductor industry. In 1960, it became an incubator of Silicon Valley and was directly or indirectly involved in the creation of dozens of corporations, including Intel and AMD. These many spin-off companies came to be known as &quot;Fairchildren&quot;.

==Initiation==
In the winter of 1954–1955, William Shockley, an inventor of the transistor and a visiting professor at Stanford University, decided to establish his own mass production of advanced transistors and Shockley diodes. He found a sponsor in Raytheon, but Raytheon discontinued the project after a month. In August 1955, Shockley turned for advice to the financier Arnold Beckman, the owner of Beckman Instruments. Shockley needed one million dollars (equivalent to $ million in ). Beckman knew that Shockley had no chance in the business, but believed that Shockley&#x27;s new inventions would be beneficial for his own company and did not want to give them to his competitors. Accordingly, Beckman agreed to create and fund a laboratory under the condition that its discoveries should be brought to mass production within two years.

The new department of Beckman Instruments took the name Shockley Semi-Conductor Laboratories (the hyphen was conventional in those years). During 1955, Beckman and Shockley signed the deal, bought licenses on all necessary patents for $25,000, and selected the location in Mountain View, near Palo Alto, California. Though Shockley did recruit four PhD physicists, William W. Happ (from Raytheon Corporation) George Smoot Horsley and Leopoldo B. Valdes (both from Bell Labs), and Richard Victor Jones (a fresh Berkeley graduate), the location provided limited enticement for new employees. The vast majority of semiconductor-related companies and professionals were based on the East Coast, so Shockley posted ads in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;. Early respondents included Sheldon Roberts of Dow Chemical, Robert Noyce of Philco, and Jay Last, a former intern of Beckman Instruments. The newspaper campaign brought some three hundred responses, and fifteen people, including Gordon Moore and David Allison, Shockley himself recruited at a meeting of the American Physical Society.

Selection continued throughout 1956. Shockley was a proponent of social technologies (which later led him to eugenics) and asked each candidate to pass a psychological test, followed by an interview.

Blank, Last, Moore, Noyce, and Roberts started working in April–May, and Kleiner, Grinich, and Hoerni came during the summer. By September 1956, the lab had 32 employees, including Shockley. Each successful candidate had to negotiate his salary with Shockley. Kleiner, Noyce, and Roberts settled for $1,000 per month; the less-experienced Last got $675. Hoerni did not bother about his payment. Shockley set his own salary at $2,500 and made all salaries accessible to all employees. 

The members of the future traitorous eight were aged between 26 (Last) and 33 (Kleiner), and six of them held PhDs. Hoerni was an experienced scientist and gifted manager, and, according to Bo Lojek, matched Shockley in intellect. Only Noyce was involved in semiconductor research, and only Grinich had experience in electronics.

==Research strategy==
Throughout 1956, most members of the lab were assembling and tuning the equipment, and &quot;pure scientists&quot; Hoerni and Noyce carried out individual applied research. Shockley refused to hire technical staff, believing that his scientists should be able to handle all technological processes. After resettlement, he focused on fine-tuning Shockley diodes for mass production, and five employees, led by Noyce, continued the work on a field effect transistor for Beckman Instruments. Shockley refused to work on bipolar transistors, which later was proven a strategic mistake because the work on Shockley diodes took so much effort the produced devices were commercial failures.

According to Noyce and Moore, as well as David Brock and Joel Shurkin, the shift from bipolar transistors to Shockley diodes was unexpected. Shockley initially planned to work on the mass production of diffusion bipolar transistors, but then set up a &quot;secret project&quot; on Shockley diodes, and in 1957 stopped all works on bipolar transistors. The reasons for this turn are unknown. According to Beckman&#x27;s biographer, Shockley regarded his diode as an interesting scientific problem and chose it neglecting Beckman&#x27;s commercial interests.

Bo Lojek, based on the archives of Shockley, believes that Shockley Labs never worked on bipolar transistors; that Shockley diodes were Shockley and Beckman&#x27;s original target, for which Beckman Instruments received military R&amp;D contracts; and that Shockley diodes could have found widespread use in telephony if Shockley had improved their reliability.

==Frictions==

Historians and colleagues generally agree that Shockley was a poor manager and businessman. From early childhood he was prone to outbursts of unprovoked aggression, which were suppressed only due to the internal discipline of his past working environment. He also tended to see rivals, even in his own subordinates.

On November 1, 1956, it was announced that the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics would be awarded to Shockley, Bardeen, and Brattain. The related public events of November–December overtired Shockley and took him away from the lab at a time when it had several management problems. Despite the festivities, the atmosphere in the lab was unhealthy.

Although Shockley was never diagnosed by psychiatrists, historians characterized Shockley&#x27;s state of mind in 1956–1957 as paranoia or autism. All phone calls were recorded, and the staff was not allowed to share their results with each other, which was not feasible since they all worked in a small building. Shockley, not trusting his employees, was sending their reports to Bell Labs for double-checking. At some point, he sent the entire lab for a lie detector test, though everyone refused.

The team started losing its members, starting with Jones, a technologist, who left in January 1957 due to a conflict with Grinich and Hoerni. Noyce and Moore then stood on different sides: Moore led the dissidents, whereas Noyce stood behind Shockley and tried to resolve conflicts. Shockley appreciated that and considered Noyce as his sole support in the group.

==Resignation==
In March 1957, Kleiner, who was beyond Shockley&#x27;s suspicions, asked permission ostensibly to visit an exhibition in Los Angeles. Instead, he flew to New York to seek investors for a new company, and his parents, New York residents, assisted him. Kleiner was supported by Blank, Grinich, Last, Roberts, Hoerni and Moore. Arthur Rock and Alfred Coyle from Hayden, Stone &amp; Co. became interested in the offer, believing that trainees of a Nobel laureate were destined to succeed.

As a last resort, on May 29, 1957, a group led by Moore presented Arnold Beckman with an ultimatum: solve the &quot;Shockley problem&quot; or they would leave. Moore suggested finding a professor position for Shockley and replacing him in the lab with a professional manager. Beckman refused, believing that Shockley could still improve the situation, later regretting this decision.
In June 1957, Beckman finally put a manager between Shockley and the team, but by then seven key employees had already made their decision. At the last minute they were joined by Noyce. Roberts persuaded him to attend the meeting of the &quot;California group&quot;, as they called themselves in the agreement with Fairchild. The meeting was held at the Clift Hotel in San Francisco and was attended by Rock and Coyle. These ten people became the core of a new company.

Finding investors proved to be difficult. The US electronics industry was concentrated in the east, and the California group preferred to stay near Palo Alto. In August 1957, Rock and Coyle met with the inventor and businessman Sherman Fairchild, founder of Fairchild Aircraft and Fairchild Camera. Fairchild sent Rock to his deputy, Richard Hodgson. Hodgson, risking his reputation, accepted the offer and within a few weeks completed all paperwork. The capital of the new company, Fairchild Semiconductor, was divided into 1,325 shares. Each member of the traitorous eight received 100 shares, 225 shares went to Hayden, Stone &amp; Co and 300 shares remained in reserve. Fairchild provided a loan of $1.38 million. To secure the loan, the traitorous eight gave Fairchild the voting rights on their shares, with the right to buy their shares at a fixed total price of $3 million.

On September 18, 1957, Blank, Grinich, Kleiner, Last, Moore, Noyce, Roberts, and Hoerni resigned from Shockley Labs. They became known as the &quot;traitorous eight&quot;, though it is not known who coined the term. Shockley could never understand the reasons for this defection. After that time, he never talked to Noyce again, but continued to follow the work of &quot;The Eight&quot;. He also combed through all records left by The Eight, basing patents, held as Shockley Labs&#x27; intellectual property, on any important ideas. (Technically, in accordance with U.S. law, those patents were issued to the respective inventing employees.)

In 1960, with the help of a new team, Shockley brought his own diode to serial production, but time had been lost, and competitors had already come close to the development of integrated circuits. Beckman sold the unprofitable Shockley Labs to investors from Cleveland. On July 23, 1961, Shockley was seriously injured in a car crash, and after recovery left the company and returned to teaching at Stanford. In 1969, IT&amp;T, the new owners of Shockley Labs, moved the company to Florida. When the staff refused to move, the lab ceased to exist.

==Split==


In November 1957, The Eight moved out of Grinich&#x27;s garage into a new, empty building on the border of Palo Alto and Mountain View. Their starting salaries ranged from $13,800 to $15,600 per year. Hodgson, who headed the board of directors, suggested Noyce as the operational manager of the company, but Noyce refused. Fairchild, knowing Noyce&#x27;s personality, also opposed his leadership. Regardless of the will of Fairchild, Noyce and Moore, who were responsible for the research and production, respectively, became the &quot;leaders among equals&quot;.

The group immediately set a clear goal to produce an array of silicon diffusion mesa transistors for digital devices, utilizing the research results of Bell Labs and Shockley Labs. Moore, Hoerni, and Last led three teams working on three alternative technologies. The technology of Moore resulted in a higher yield of operational n-p-n transistors, and in July–September 1958, they went into mass production. The release of p-n-p transistors of Hoerni was delayed until early 1959. This created the Moore-Hoerni conflict at Fairchild: Moore ignored the contribution of Hoerni, and Hoerni believed that his work was unfairly treated. However, the Moore transistors formed the prestige of Fairchild Semiconductor – for several years, they beat all the competitors.

In 1958, Fairchild mesa transistors were considered for the D-17B Minuteman I guidance computer, but they did not meet military standards of reliability. Fairchild already had a solution in the planar technology of Hoerni proposed on December 1, 1957. In the spring of 1958, Hoerni and Last were spending nights on experiments with the first planar transistors. The planar technology later became the second most important event in the history of microelectronics, after the invention of the transistor, but in 1959 it went unnoticed. Fairchild announced the transition from mesa to planar technology in October 1960. However, Moore refused to credit this achievement to Hoerni, and in 1996 even attributing it to unnamed Fairchild engineers.

In 1959, Sherman Fairchild exercised his right to purchase shares of the members of the traitorous eight. Jay Last recalled (in 2007) that this event happened too early and turned former partners into ordinary employees, destroying the team spirit. In November 1960, Tom Bay, the Vice President of Marketing at Fairchild, accused Last of squandering money and demanded termination of Last&#x27;s project of developing integrated circuits. Moore refused to help Last, and Noyce declined to discuss the matter. This conflict was the last straw: on January 31, 1961, Last and Hoerni left Fairchild and to head Amelco, the microelectronics branch of Teledyne. Kleiner and Roberts joined them after a few weeks. Blank, Grinich, Moore, and Noyce stayed with Fairchild. The traitorous eight split into two groups of four.

==Heritage==


From 1960–1965, Fairchild was the undisputed leader of the semiconductor market, both technologically and in terms of sales. Early 1965 brought the first signs of management problems. In November 1965, the creators of integrated operational amplifiers Bob Widlar and David Talbert left for National Semiconductor. In February 1967, they were followed by five top managers who disagreed with Noyce. Noyce started litigation with shareholders and effectively removed himself from the operational management. In July 1967, the company became unprofitable and lost their leading position in the market to Texas Instruments.

In March 1968, Moore and Noyce decided to leave Fairchild and again, as nine years prior, turned to Arthur Rock. In the summer of 1968, they founded NM Electronics. Blank, Grinich, Kleiner, Last, Hoerni, and Roberts set aside the past disagreements and financially supported the company of Moore and Noyce. A year later, NM Electronics bought the trade name rights from the hotel chain Intelco and took the name of Intel. Moore held senior positions at Intel until 1997 when he was named Chairman Emeritus of Intel Corporation. Noyce left Intel in 1987 to lead the non-profit consortium Sematech. He died suddenly in 1990, the first of The Eight.

Grinich left Fairchild in 1968 for a short sabbatical and then taught at UC Berkeley and Stanford, where he published the first comprehensive textbook on integrated circuits. He later co-founded and ran several companies developing industrial radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags.

Blank was the last of The Eight to leave Fairchild in 1969. He founded the financial firm Xicor specializing in innovative start-ups, and in 2004 sold it for $529 million.

Hoerni headed Amelco until the summer of 1963 and, after the conflict with the Teledyne owners, for three years headed Union Carbide Electronics. In July 1967, supported by the watch company Société Suisse pour l&#x27;Industrie Horlogère (the predecessor of Swatch Group) founded Intersil, the company that created the market for custom CMOS circuits. The circuits developed by Intersil for Seiko in 1969–1970 contributed to the rise of Japanese electronic watches. Intersil and Intel weren&#x27;t competitors as Intel released a limited set of templated circuits for computers and sold them initially only in the U.S. market, whereas Intersil focused on custom CMOS circuits with low power consumption and sold them worldwide.

Last remained with Amelco and for twelve years served as Vice President of Technology at Teledyne. In 1982, he founded Hillcrest Press specializing in art books. After leaving Amelco, Roberts led his own business, and in 1973–1987 served as a trustee of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Amelco, after numerous mergers, acquisitions, and renaming, became a subsidiary of Microchip Technology.

In 1972, Kleiner and Tom Perkins from Hewlett-Packard founded the venture capital fund Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, which has been involved in the creation and/or funding of Amazon.com, Compaq, Genentech, Intuit, Lotus, Macromedia, Netscape, Sun Microsystems, Symantec and dozens of other companies. Kleiner later wrote that his goal was to geographically spread the venture financing.

==Honors==
In May 2011, the California Historical Society gave the &quot;Legends of California Award&quot; to The Eight. Blank, Last, Moore, and Roberts&#x27; son Dave attended the event in San Francisco.

==Fairchildren==

In research, reporting, and popular lore related to Silicon Valley, the term &quot;Fairchildren&quot; has been used to refer to:

*The corporate spin-offs created by former employees of Fairchild Semiconductor. This usage was propagated by historian Leslie Berlin through her 2001 review article, PhD thesis, and biography of Robert Noyce.
* The founders of such firms. This is the earliest usage, e.g., in the 1978 BBC &quot;Horizon&quot; documentary &quot;Now the Chips are Down&quot;, Tom Wolfe&#x27;s 1983 profile of Noyce or a 5,000-word profile of Silicon Valley in 1999.
* Former Fairchild Semiconductor employees, as in a 1988 &quot;New York Times&quot; article.
* The original founders of Fairchild Semiconductor, more commonly known as the traitorous eight. This has been used by the PBS website and a book by Blasi &quot;et al&quot;.

One of the first articles to identify Fairchild as the parent of so many spin-offs appeared in &quot;Innovation Magazine&quot; in 1969. The spin-off companies, such as AMD, Intel, Intersil and restructured National Semiconductor, were different from those of the east coast and California&#x27;s electronic companies established in the 1940s and 1950s. &quot;Old Californians&quot; like Beckman and Varian Associates did not trust Wall Street and kept control of their companies for decades, whereas the new companies of the 1960s were created for a quick (within 3–5 years) public sale of shares. Their founders built a business strategy based on the expectations of the investment banks. Another characteristic of Silicon Valley was the mobility of managers and professionals among companies. Partly because of Noyce, Silicon Valley developed a culture of openly denying the hierarchical culture of traditional corporations. People remained faithful to each other, but not to the employer or the industry. Fairchild &quot;alumni&quot; can be found not only in electronics-related but also financial and public relations companies.

<doc id="378461" wikidata="Q504373" url="?curid=378461" title="Awaji Island">
<text>is an island in Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan, in the eastern part of the Seto Inland Sea between the islands of Honshū and Shikoku. The island has an area of . It is the largest island of the Seto Inland Sea.

As a transit between those two larger islands, &quot;Awaji&quot; originally means &quot;the road to Awa&quot;, the historic province bordering the Shikoku side of the Naruto Strait, now part of Tokushima Prefecture.

==Geography==

The island is separated from Honshū by the Akashi Strait and from Shikoku by the Naruto Strait. Since April 5, 1998, it has been connected to Kobe on Honshū by the Akashi Kaikyo Bridge, the second longest suspension bridge in the world. Since its completion, the Kobe-Awaji-Naruto Expressway across the island has been the main eastern land link between Honshū and Shikoku. The Naruto whirlpools form in the strait between Naruto, Tokushima and Awaji.

The Nojima Fault, responsible for the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake, cuts across the island. A section of the fault was protected and turned into the Nojima Fault Preservation Museum in the to show how the movement in the ground cuts across roads, hedges and other installations. Outside of this protected area, the fault zone is less visible. 
The and the are located near Fukura.

==History==
According to the creation myth in Shinto, Awaji was the first of the &quot;ōyashima&quot; islands born from the &quot;kami&quot; Izanagi and Izanami. Awaji constituted a province between the 7th and the 19th century, Awaji Province, and was a part of Nankaidō. Today the island consists of three municipalities: Awaji, Sumoto and Minamiawaji.

The Awaji Ningyō-Jōruri, a more-than-500-year-old form of traditional puppet theater, or &quot;ningyō-jōruri&quot;, daily performs several shows in the in Minamiawaji, Hyōgo in the southern part of the island and is designated an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Japan. The Awaji puppets perform popular traditional dramas but have their origins in religious rituals.

Starting in the 1830s, the local potter Minpei started producing what would be then known as Awaji ware, also known as Minpei ware.

Tadao Ando designed several structures on the island, among them, the and the Awaji Yumebutai, both located in Awaji, Hyōgo.

In 1995, this island was the epicenter of the Kobe earthquake, which killed over 5,502 people. The earthquake caused enormous damage around the northern part of the island, which experienced a severe earthquake with a seismic intensity 7. The earthquake has a seismic fault called Nojima Fault. This fault is one of the closest faults to the epicenter and was designated as a national natural monument in 1998. 

==Municipalities==
There are 3 municipalities in Awaji island: Awaji, Sumoto and Minamiawaji. They are part of Hyōgo Prefecture.

<text>Mega Millions (originally known as The Big Game in 1996 and renamed, temporarily, to The Big Game Mega Millions six years later) is an American multijurisdictional lottery game. The first drawing took place on September 6, 1996, with six participating states, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Massachusetts, and Virginia. After growth of the game in 1997, a Tuesday Drawing was added in February 1998. As of June 30, 2023, it is offered in 45 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The first (The Big Game) Mega Millions drawing was in 2002. The logo for all versions of the game following the retirement of The Big Game name featured a gold-colored ball with six stars to represent the game&#x27;s initial membership, although some lotteries insert their respective logos in the ball.

Mega Millions is drawn at 11:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday and Friday evenings, including holidays. Mega Millions is administered by a consortium of its 12 original lotteries, the drawings are held at the studios of WSB-TV in Atlanta, Georgia, supervised by the Georgia Lottery. The hosts are John Crow, Carol Blackmon, and Adria Wofford.

Under the current version&#x27;s regulations (which began October 28, 2017, with the first drawing October 31) for Mega Millions, the minimum Mega Millions advertised jackpot is $20 million, paid in 30 graduated yearly installments, increasing 5% each year (unless the cash option is chosen). The jackpot increases when no top-prize winner results.

Reflecting common practice among American lotteries, the jackpot is advertised as a nominal value of annual installments. A cash-value option (the usual choice), when chosen by a jackpot winner, pays the approximate present value of the installments. Mega Millions&#x27; previous format began on October 19, 2013, its first drawing was three days later. In the current version of Mega Millions, five white balls are drawn from a pool of 70, and one gold-colored &quot;MegaBall&quot; is drawn from a separate pool of 25, a player must match all six numbers to win the jackpot.

Each game costs $2, but will cost $5 starting in April 2025. Of the 47 Mega Millions jurisdictions, all but California offer an option, called &quot;Megaplier&quot; (plays with the Megaplier are $3 each) where non-jackpot prizes are multiplied by 2, 3, 4, or 5. The Megaplier was made available to all Mega Millions jurisdictions in January 2011, it began as an option available only in Texas. Several of the game&#x27;s members offer an only-the-jackpot option, in which two plays cost $3. None of the lower-tier prizes are in play on such a wager.

The largest winning jackpot in Mega Millions history was $1.602 billion, for the August 8, 2023 drawing, in which a single winning jackpot ticket was sold in Florida.

==The 2010 expansion of Mega Millions and Powerball==

On October 13, 2009, the Mega Millions consortium and Multi-State Lottery Association (MUSL) reached an agreement in principle to cross-sell Mega Millions and Powerball in American lottery jurisdictions, with the two groups referred to as the &quot;Mega Power Lottery&quot; by many users. The expansion occurred on January 31, 2010, as 23 Powerball members began selling Mega Millions tickets for their first drawing on February 2, 2010, likewise, 10 Mega Millions members began selling Powerball tickets for their first drawing the next day. Montana (joining Mega Millions on March 1, 2010) was the first jurisdiction to add either game after the cross-sell expansion. Nebraska (March 20, 2010), Oregon (March 28, 2010), Arizona (April 18, 2010), Maine (May 9, 2010), Colorado and South Dakota (the latter two on May 16, 2010) also have joined Mega Millions since the expansion.

As of January 2020, 47 lotteries were offering Mega Millions &quot;and&quot; Powerball, Florida joined Mega Millions in May 2013. (Puerto Rico, whose lottery began in the 1930s, currently does not offer Mega Millions.) Mississippi began selling lottery tickets in 2019, it joined Mega Millions on January 30, 2020.

Before the agreement, the only stores that sold Mega Millions &quot;and&quot; Powerball tickets were retailers whose businesses were on a border between jurisdictions and sold competing games.

The current Mega Millions format began in October 2017. Plays are $2 per game. For an additional $1 per play, the Megaplier, if activated, multiplies nonjackpot prizes. Multipliers are 2, 3, 4, and 5 (a second-prize Megaplier play can win $5 million cash). The Megaplier is not available in California, or on Just the Jackpot wagers (where offered).

==Current Mega Millions members==
===Mega Millions and Powerball===
Alabama, Alaska, Hawaii, Nevada, and Utah do not sell lottery tickets. In 2013, Wyoming became the 44th state to establish a lottery, the next year, it began, initially offering both Mega Millions and Powerball. In August 2018, a bill establishing a lottery in Mississippi was passed, and sent to its governor for his signature, its lottery began November 25, 2019, with Mississippi joining Mega Millions on January 30, 2020.

In most cases, a lottery joining Mega Millions on or after January 31, 2010, offered Powerball before the MUSL cross-sell expansion.

==History==

===The Big Game===

Tickets for The Big Game began to be sold in Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, and Virginia on August 31, 1996. The Big Game was created and designed by Michigan Lottery Commissioner Bill Martin and Illinois Lottery Director Desiree Rogers after having discussions regarding a multistate game with lottery directors Rebecca Paul of the Georgia Lottery and Penelope W. Kyle of the Virginia Lottery. The Big Game initially was drawn weekly, on Friday.

The Georgia Lottery was a member of MUSL at the time and wanted to sell both games for the remainder of 1996, but within a few days, Georgia was forcibly removed from MUSL, returning with the 2010 cross-selling expansion.

Beginning in January 1999, jackpot winners were given the option to receive their prize in cash. In May 1999, New Jersey joined The Big Game, the only jurisdiction to enter as a participant before The Big Game became Mega Millions in 2002.

===The Big Game Mega Millions===
 Ohio and New York joined &quot;The Big Game&quot; consortium on May 15, 2002, when the game was renamed &quot;The Big Game Mega Millions&quot;, temporarily retaining the old name and the original &quot;gold ball&quot; logo. The &quot;Big Money Ball&quot; became the &quot;Mega Ball&quot;. While the game&#x27;s name was altered, the yellow ball in the new Mega Millions logo continued to read &quot;The Big Game&quot; until February 2003, after which it was replaced with six stars representing the original members of the consortium. The first (The Big Game) Mega Millions drawing was held two days later, on May 17. The Mega Millions trademark is owned by the Illinois Lottery. The first three lotteries to join Mega Millions were Washington (in September 2002), Texas (in 2003), and California (in 2005), California was the last addition to Mega Millions before the cross-sell expansion of 2010. Montana joined Mega Millions on March 1, 2010, the first addition to Mega Millions after the cross-sell expansion.

When Texas joined Mega Millions in 2003, it began offering an option, initially available only to Texas Lottery players, known as the Megaplier, which was similar to Powerball&#x27;s Power Play. The 11 Mega Millions lotteries without Megaplier on the January 31, 2010, cross-selling date gradually added the multiplier option, by January 2011, all Mega Millions lotteries, except for California, offered the Megaplier. The Texas Lottery owns the trademark to Megaplier.

On June 24, 2005, to commemorate California joining Mega Millions, that night&#x27;s drawing was held in Hollywood, with Carrie Underwood assisting host Glenn Burns for the draw.

For the November 15, 2005, drawing, a group called &quot;The Lucky 7&quot; held the only jackpot-winning ticket, purchased in Anaheim, California, winning $315 million. They chose the cash option, splitting $175 million before tax was withheld.

On March 6, 2007, the Mega Millions jackpot reached $390 million, which was then the third-largest jackpot in U.S. history. The jackpot was shared by two tickets, both matching the numbers of 16–22–29–39–42 and Mega Ball 20. Both winners chose the cash option, with each share $116,557,083 before tax was withheld. 

===2010 cross-sell expansion===
The New Jersey Lottery, among others, in early 2009 announced it would seek permission to sell Powerball tickets alongside Mega Millions. In October 2009, an agreement between Mega Millions and MUSL allowed all U.S. lotteries, including New Jersey&#x27;s, to offer both games. On January 31, 2010, Mega Millions expanded to include the 23 MUSL members, as of that date, 35 jurisdictions were participating in Mega Millions. On the same day, 10 existing Mega Millions-participating lotteries began selling Powerball tickets. Ohio joined Powerball on April 16, 2010. On March 1, 2010, Montana became the first MUSL member to add Mega Millions &quot;after&quot; the cross-sell expansion. Nebraska became the 37th Mega Millions participating member on March 20, 2010, followed by Oregon as the 38th member on March 28, Arizona as the 39th member on April 18, and Maine as 40th Mega Millions participant on May 9, 2010. Colorado and South Dakota added Mega Millions on May 16, 2010, bringing the total to 42 jurisdictions.

Recent additions to Mega Millions included the U.S. Virgin Islands, in October 2010, and Louisiana in November 2011. Florida joined Mega Millions on May 15, 2013, the first drawing to include Florida-bought tickets was two days later.

Presumably due to their experience with the Power Play option for Powerball, all 23 lotteries joining Mega Millions on January 31, 2010, immediately offered Megaplier to their players. The Megaplier continues to be drawn by Texas Lottery computers, as California does not offer the multiplier. Montana, offering Powerball before the expansion date, became the 24th lottery to offer the Megaplier, followed by Nebraska (the 25th), Oregon (the 26th), Arizona (as the 27th) and Maine (as the 28th lottery to offer the option). After Colorado and South Dakota joined Mega Millions, the number of lotteries offering the Megaplier rose to 37.

Mega Millions tickets bought with the Megaplier option, beginning September 12, 2010, automatically won $1 million (instead of $250,000) if the five white balls – but excluding the Mega Ball – are matched.

On March 13, 2010, New Jersey became the first Mega Millions participant (just before the cross-sell expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning ticket for Powerball after joining that game. The ticket was worth over $211 million annuity (the cash option was chosen). On May 28, 2010, North Carolina became the first Powerball member (just before the cross-selling expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning Mega Millions ticket after joining Mega Millions, with an annuity jackpot of $12 million.

In January 2012, Mega Millions&#x27; rival Powerball was altered, among the changes were a price increase of $1 for each play, as a result, a base game costs $2, or $3 with the &quot;Power Play&quot; option. The price of a Mega Millions play stayed the same until 2017. The price increase for playing Powerball was a major factor in Louisiana deciding to pursue joining Mega Millions, as that state&#x27;s lottery joined Mega Millions on November 16, 2011.

===October 2013 format change===
The final 5/56 + 1/46 Mega Millions drawing was held on October 18, 2013, that night&#x27;s jackpot of $37 million was not won. The first drawing under the revised 5/75 + 1/15 format—which saw the jackpot estimate &quot;leap&quot; to $55 million due to the change in the annuity structure—occurred on October 22, 2013. The minimum jackpot was then $15 million, with rollovers of at least $5 million. Second prize (5+0) became $1 million cash. In the revised format, players chose 5 of 75 white ball numbers, and the &quot;Gold Ball&quot; number out of 15.

The Megaplier option remained, the 5 multiplier was added.

Lower prize tiers (through October 18, 2013) based on a $1 play:
*Match 5+0: $250,000
*Match 4+MB: $10,000
*Match 4+0: $150
*Match 3+MB: $150
*Match 3+0: $7
*Match 2+MB: $10
*Match 1+MB: $3
*Match 0+MB: $2

Payouts in California remained parimutuel.

The odds of winning or sharing a Mega Millions jackpot (October 19, 2013 – October 27, 2017): one in about 258.9 million. The overall odds of winning a prize were one in 14.71, including the base $1 prize for a &quot;Mega Ball&quot;-only match.

Prizes and odds (2013–2017 version) based on a $1 play:
*5 numbers plus the Mega Ball (5+1): Jackpot; 1 in 258,890,850
*5 numbers but not the Mega Ball (5+0): $1,000,000; 1 in 17,259,390
*4+1: $5,000; 1 in 739,688 
*4+0: $500; 1 in 52,835
*3+1: $50; 1 in 10,720
*3+0: $5; 1 in 766
*2+1: $5; 1 in 473
*1+1: $2; 1 in 56
*Mega Ball &quot;only&quot;: $1; 1 in 21

The odds for winning the $1 prize, 1 in 21, reflected the possibility of matching &quot;none&quot; of the white balls, but matching the Mega Ball.

The annuity—which was 20 annual payments (no cash option was available) when &quot;The Big Game&quot; began—changed from 26 equal yearly installments to 30 graduated annual payments (increasing 5 percent yearly) with the format change on October 19, 2013.

===October 2017 format/price point change===
On October 28, 2017, the price of a Mega Millions play doubled, to $2, the first drawing under the current price point was October 31, 2017. The Mega Millions double matrix changed, from 5/75 + 1/15 to the current 5/70 + 1/25. The starting jackpot became $40 million, with minimum rollovers of $5 million. The &quot;Megaplier&quot; option (which again is not offered in California) was retained, with an adjustment to its multipliers. (The final jackpot for the $1 version was $30 million, which was not won, the initial jackpot for the new version would still be $40 million with a jackpot hit.)

Mega Millions&#x27; non-California prize tiers effective October 28, 2017 (old prizes in parentheses, changed amounts in boldface) for a $2 base play:

* 5+MB: Jackpot; starting jackpot raised to $40 million (annuity value)
* 5+0: $1,000,000 ($1,000,000)
* 4+MB: $10,000 ($5,000)
* 4+0: $500 ($500)
* 3+MB: $200 ($50)
* 3+0: $10 ($5)
* 2+MB: $10 ($5)
* 1+MB: $4 ($2)
* 0+MB: $2 ($1)

The new prize structure allocates roughly 75 percent of the prize pool for the jackpot, this is, in part, to facilitate the new &quot;Just the Jackpot&quot; option. The 2013–2017 version allocated about 68 percent towards the jackpot.

===&quot;Just the Jackpot&quot; option===

In preparation for the October 28, 2017, format change the then-46 Mega Millions members were given the choice of offering a $3, two-game play (called &quot;Just the Jackpot&quot;). A player choosing this option is not eligible for any of the eight lower-tier prizes, therefore, the Megaplier option is not available for &quot;Just the Jackpot&quot; wagers.

These lotteries offered the &quot;Just the Jackpot&quot; option upon the format change: Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, South Dakota, Texas, Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. Kentucky has since added &quot;Just the Jackpot&quot;, with other lotteries potentially adding it. Not known is whether a second series of playslips would be printed for lotteries offering &quot;Just the Jackpot&quot; beginning after the October 28, 2017, format change.

&quot;Just the Jackpot&quot; wagers and regular Mega Millions plays are printed on separate tickets. Most &quot;Just the Jackpot&quot; wagers are terminal-generated, however, &quot;JtJ&quot; wagers in Kansas and Texas allow the player to choose their numbers, while Wisconsin players must ask for a terminal-generated ticket.

As of January 2020, there has yet to be a jackpot winner from a &quot;Just the Jackpot&quot; wager, there also is no known count of &quot;JtJ&quot; wagers that would have won second prize (5+0) with a traditional Mega Millions play.

===2020 adjustments to jackpot starting point and rollover due to COVID-19===
On April 7, 2020, the Mega Millions starting jackpot amount was temporarily reset from $40 million to $20 million with the annuity option, with at least a $2 million rollover for each drawing without a jackpot winner, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. This was done to enforce social distancing and discourage crowding of selling venues for large jackpots, and to account for lower interest rates.

===2025 changes===
On October 7, 2024, Mega Millions announced a new format to take effect in April 2025. Plays will now cost $5 a game, with the Megaplier included in that cost and built into each play. The Megaplier will also have a 10 times multiplier, which means the maximum second-prize win will be $10 million.

==Record jackpots==
Over time, the size of jackpots has increased because of the higher ticket price, the larger number of states participating, and the reduced odds of winning.

Mega Millions&#x27; largest jackpot of $1.602 billion was won on August 8, 2023 in Neptune Beach, Florida.

The second largest Mega Millions jackpot, $1.537 billion, was won on October 23, 2018, by one ticket, sold in South Carolina. The jackpot was claimed on March 5, 2019, with the winner choosing to remain anonymous under South Carolina law.

The third-largest Mega Millions jackpot worth $1.35 billion was won following the January 13, 2023 drawing, in which one winning ticket was sold in Maine.

The fourth-largest Mega Millions jackpot worth $1.34 billion was won following the July 29, 2022, drawing, in which one winning ticket was sold in Illinois.

The fifth-largest Mega Millions jackpot worth $1.22 billion was won following the December 27, 2024 drawing. The winning ticket was sold in Cottonwood, California. A total of five others won the secondary prize. Two tickers were sold in California, one in Arizona, one in Texas, and one in Missouri.

The sixth-largest Mega Millions jackpot worth $1.13 billion was won following the March 26, 2024, drawing, in which one winning ticket was sold in New Jersey.

The seventh-largest Mega Millions jackpot advertised as $640 million at the time of the drawing (annuitized) or $462 million (cash value), was drawn on March 30, 2012. The initial estimate for that drawing (following the March 27 drawing, which was $363 million annuity) was $476 million (later increased to $500 million and again to $540 million), brisk ticket sales pushed the jackpot values, both annuitized (to $656 million) and the cash option ($474 million) higher. The amount spent on Mega Millions for drawings following its previous jackpot win, on January 24, 2012, was at least $1.5 billion. three jackpot-winning tickets had been confirmed (Illinois, Kansas, and Maryland).

Mega Millions&#x27; eighth-largest jackpot, $648 million (second-largest won), was for the December 17, 2013, drawing. Two winning tickets, one each from California and Georgia, were sold. The holder of the Georgia ticket claimed the next morning, they selected the cash option, which amounted to $173,819,742.50 before withholdings. The holder of the California ticket claimed on January 3, 2014. (The California ticket holder received an equal share, but potentially a larger cash-option amount, as California lottery winnings are exempt from state income tax.)
The July 24, 2018, drawing produced the ninth-largest jackpot (pending the larger one on offer the following October). The annuity value was $543 million, but the holders of the winning ticket, 11 co-workers at a Wells Fargo branch in San Jose, chose to split the $320 million cash lump sum.

Mega Millions&#x27; tenth-largest jackpot, $540 million, was for the July 8, 2016, drawing. One ticket from Indiana won the jackpot, the winner chose the cash option.

Mega Millions&#x27; eleventh-largest jackpot, $533 million, was for the March 30, 2018, drawing. One ticket from New Jersey won the jackpot, Riverdale Lukoil South Gas Station sold the winning ticket.

==Versions of (The Big Game) Mega Millions==
Versions of The Big Game and Mega Millions have used different matrices:

===Megaplier===
Mega Millions players have the option to activate a multiplier, called &quot;Megaplier&quot;, in 46 of its 47 jurisdictions; it is functionally similar to Powerball&#x27;s &quot;Power Play&quot;, except the latter limits the second-prize multiplier to 2x. (Neither &quot;Megaplier&quot; nor &quot;Power Play&quot; are offered in California because the parimutuel prize structure required by California law is not compatible with the multiplier.) By adding $1 to a basic Mega Millions game, to $3, a player has an opportunity to multiply any non-jackpot prize by 2, 3, 4, or 5. The &quot;Megaplier&quot; is drawn by the Texas Lottery (before the cross-sell expansion on January 31, 2010, it was the only lottery to offer &quot;Megaplier&quot;); it is drawn by a random number generator (RNG). The odds for each &quot;Megaplier&quot; possibility are not uniform.

&quot;Megaplier&quot; wagers made for drawings from September 12, 2010, through October 18, 2013, that won second prize (then $250,000) were automatically elevated to 4x, winning $1 million. This &quot;guarantee&quot; did not carry over to the following version of Mega Millions, although the $1 million second prize becomes $5 million if the &quot;Megaplier&quot; is 5x.

===Winning and probability===

Former Mega Millions odds (October 19, 2013 – October 27, 2017):

The probability and odds can be taken into a mathematical perspective: The probability of winning the jackpot (through October 27, 2017) was 1:(75C5) x (15), that is: 75 ways for the first white ball times 74 ways for the second times 73 for the third times 72 for the fourth times 71 for the last white ball divided by 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1, or 5!, and this number is then multiplied by 15 (15 possible numbers for the &quot;Megaball&quot;). Therefore, (75 x 74 x 73 x 72 x 71)/(5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1) x 15 = 258,890,850, which means any combination of five white balls plus the Megaball has a 1:258,890,850 chance of winning the jackpot. Similarly, the odds for second prize were 1:(75C5) x (15/14) = 1: 18,492,204 chance of winning. The overall probability of winning any prize was 1 in 14.7. If there are no jackpot winners for a specific drawing, the jackpot will keep increasing, however, the odds will still remain the same.

Payouts through October 18, 2013:
Overall probabilities: 1 in 755 of winning any of the top six prizes, 1 in 40 of winning any prize.

In California, prize levels are paid on a parimutuel basis, rather than the fixed lower-tier amounts for winners in other Mega Millions jurisdictions. California&#x27;s eight lower-tier Mega Millions prize pools are separate from those shared by the other 45 lotteries. California&#x27;s second prize is a &quot;secondary jackpot,&quot; its payout sometimes exceeds $1 million cash, even though California does not offer the &quot;Megaplier&quot;.

===Payment options and claiming prizes===
In New Jersey and Texas lotteries, players must choose, in advance, whether they wish to collect a jackpot prize in cash or annuity. New Jersey winners can change an annuity ticket to cash should they be eligible to claim a jackpot, but the choice is binding in Texas.
The other Mega Millions members allow the cash/annuity choice to be made after winning (usually 60 days after claiming the ticket), although in Florida, the 60-day &quot;clock&quot; starts with the drawing in which the jackpot prize was won.

If a jackpot prize is not claimed within the respective jurisdiction&#x27;s time limit, each of the 46 Mega Millions members gets back the money they contributed to that jackpot. Each of the 46 lotteries has rules in regards to unclaimed prizes, most Mega Millions members set aside unclaimed winnings for educational purposes.

In 2007, a $31 million prize went unclaimed in New York. Many prizes of $250,000 each have been unclaimed, including several in Michigan for 2007 drawings.

Mega Millions winners have either 180 days (California nonjackpot prizes only) or one year to claim prizes, including the jackpot (although some Mega Millions winners lose the right to collect a jackpot in cash if they wait more than 60 days after the drawing).

The minimum age to purchase a Mega Millions ticket is 18, except in Arizona, Iowa, Louisiana, and Mississippi, where the minimum age is 21, in Nebraska, it is 19. Generally (an exception is Virginia), minors can win on tickets received as gifts, the rules according to each Mega Millions member vary for minors receiving prizes.

Rules vary according to the applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdiction where the ticket is sold, and the winner&#x27;s residence (e.g., if New Jerseyans win on a ticket bought near their workplace in Manhattan). Mega Millions winnings are exempt from state income tax in California, while Florida, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming do not have an income tax. Some residents of New York City and Yonkers, New York, pay &quot;three&quot; levels of income tax, as these cities levy income taxes.

==Drawings==
Drawings are usually held at the studios of WSB-TV in Atlanta, Georgia. The original host was WSB&#x27;s chief meteorologist, Glenn Burns. Since 2008, the drawings have been emceed by the hosts of the Georgia Lottery drawings John Crow, Atlanta radio host Carol Blackmon and Adria Wofford. Crow usually begins each drawing with “Let&#x27;s see if I can make you a millionaire tonight.” or “Let&#x27;s see you can win some money!” and signs off with &quot;Play on, America!&quot; Blackmon usually speaks quickly and begins each drawing with “Get out your tickets.” Wofford also uses the &quot;Get out your tickets.&quot; spiel as well. Sabrina Cupit originally served as the secondary host if neither Crow or Blackmon are available. In 2022, Cupit was replaced by Wofford. In 2023, Wofford was promoted to co-host serving alongside Crow while Blackmon was demoted to back-up host if neither primary host is available. Drawings are supervised by Lottery Security and certified by Preston, CPA.

Before the January 31, 2010, cross-sell expansion, Mega Millions was the only multi-jurisdictional lottery whose drawings were carried nationally, instead of airing only on stations in participating jurisdictions. Chicago-based cable superstation WGN-TV simulcast Mega Millions drawings on its national WGN America feed immediately following WGN&#x27;s 9:00 p.m. Central Time newscast. Following the cross-sell expansion, WGN also began airing Powerball drawings nationally. WGN served as a default carrier of both major games where no local television station carried either multi-jurisdictional lottery&#x27;s drawings. Both drawings were removed from WGN America in late 2014 when it ceased carrying WGN&#x27;s newscasts.

Two machines are used in each Mega Millions drawing. The model used for Mega Millions is the Criterion II, manufactured by Smartplay International of Edgewater Park, New Jersey. The balls are moved around by means of counter-rotating arms which randomly mix the balls. Individually, the five white balls, several seconds apart, drop through a hole in the bottom of the mixing drum.

== Record jackpots (listed by annuity value) ==


==Revenue==
Approximately 50% of Mega Millions sales is returned to players as prizes, the remainder is split (each lottery has different rules regarding these funds) among retailers, marketing, and operations, as well as the 47 jurisdictions offering the game, different lotteries use the proceeds in different ways.

==Miscellany==

In the aftermath of the attack on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, the legislature in Albany, fearing a monumental loss of revenue, passed legislation the following month, which was signed by Governor George Pataki, which included joining a multi-jurisdictional lottery game. Around the same time, for entirely different reasons, Ohio&#x27;s governor also gave the green light to joining a multi-jurisdictional game. Both lotteries opted to join &quot;The Big Game&quot;, which, at the time, was offered in seven states. The added populations of the two new jurisdictions, in turn, led to a larger double matrix. The first machine continued to hold white 52 balls, while 16 gold balls were added in the second, meaning there were 52 numbers to pick from in both parts of each $1 game. On May 15, 2002, the game was renamed &quot;The Big Game Mega Millions&quot;, shortly after, it became just &quot;Mega Millions&quot;. Except for the 2010 cross-selling expansion, this was the only time &quot;The Big Game&quot; or Mega Millions simultaneously added more than one member.

In 2005, Mega Millions was the target of a mailing scam. A letter bearing the Mega Millions logo was used in a string of lottery scams designed to trick people into providing personal financial information by cashing bogus checks. The letter, which had been sent to people in several states via standard mail, included a check for what the scammers said was an unclaimed Mega Millions prize. If the check was cashed, it bounced, but not before the bank stamped it with a routing number and personal account information and sent it back to the fraudulent organization, providing them with the recipients&#x27; financial information.

A budget impasse due to the 2006 New Jersey Government shutdown led to the temporary closing of its non-essential agencies on July 1, 2006. Among the casualties were the Atlantic City casinos and the New Jersey Lottery. Not only were New Jersey&#x27;s in-house games (such as Pick-6) not drawn for about a week, but all New Jersey lottery terminals were shut down, meaning Mega Millions could not be played in New Jersey, even though Mega Millions was drawn as usual. A similar shutdown happened in Minnesota on July 1, 2011.

Elecia Battle made national headlines in January 2004 when she claimed that she had lost the winning ticket in the December 30, 2003, Mega Millions drawing. She then filed a lawsuit against the woman who had come forward with the ticket, Rebecca Jemison. Several days later, when confronted with contradictory evidence, she admitted that she had lied. Battle was charged with filing a false police report the following day. As a result of this false report, she was fined $1,000, ordered to perform 50 hours of community service, and required to compensate the police and courts for various costs incurred.

The January 4, 2011 Mega Millions drawing drew attention for its similarity to &quot;The Numbers,&quot; a sequence of six numbers that served as a plot device of the ABC drama series &quot;Lost&quot;. One such usage involved character Hugo &quot;Hurley&quot; Reyes playing the sequence in a similar &quot;Mega Lotto&quot; game, winning a nine-figure jackpot and subsequently experiencing numerous misfortunes in his personal life. The first three numbers (4, 8, 15) and mega ball (42) in the Mega Millions drawing matched the first three numbers and the final number (which Hurley also used as the &quot;mega ball&quot; number) in the &quot;Lost&quot; sequence. The last two numbers in the Mega Millions drawing did not match the last two numbers that were used in the scene. Those who played &quot;The Numbers,&quot; including from quick-picks, won $150 ($118 in California) in a non-&quot;Megaplier&quot; game, $600 with the multiplier.

The 12 original (before the 2010 cross-sell expansion) Mega Millions members have each produced at least one Mega Millions jackpot winner.

On May 11, 2022, Crow incorrectly called the mega ball number as a &quot;6&quot; instead of the actual &quot;9,&quot; the numbers printed on the ball have an underline to denote their correct orientation. The New York Lottery paid $5,538 to customers before discovering the error.

<text>Azrael (; , &#x27;God has helped&#x27;; ) is the canonical angel of death in Islam and appears in the apocryphal text Apocalypse of Peter.

Relative to similar concepts of such beings, Azrael holds a benevolent role as God&#x27;s angel of death; he acts as a psychopomp, responsible for transporting the souls of the deceased after their death. In Islam, he is said to hold a scroll concerning the fate of mortals, recording and erasing their names at their birth and death, similar to the role of the &quot;malakh ha-mavet&quot; (Angel of Death) in Judaism.

Depending on the perspective and precepts of the various religions in which he is a figure, he may also be portrayed as a resident of the Third Heaven, a division of heaven in Judaism and Islam. In Islam, he is one of the four archangels, and is identified with the Quranic &quot;Malʾak al-Mawt&quot; (), which corresponds with the Hebrew term &quot;Malʾakh ha-Maweth&quot; () in Rabbinic literature. In Hebrew, Azrael translates to &quot;Angel of God&quot; or &quot;Help from God&quot;.

==Etymology and place in Judaism==
The Hebrew Bible does not mention an angel by the name Azrael, nor does it appear in the rabbinic literature of the Talmud or Midrashim. No such angel is treated as canonical in traditional Rabbinic Judaism. However, an angel by a similar name, &quot;Azriel&quot; (), is mentioned in Kabbalistic literature such as the &quot;Zohar&quot;.

Despite the absence of such a figure in Judaism, the name &quot;Azrael&quot; is suggestive of a Hebrew theophoric , meaning &quot;the one whom God helps&quot;. Archeological evidence uncovered in Jewish settlements in Mesopotamia confirms that it was indeed at one time used on an incantation bowl from the 7th century. However, as the text thereon only lists names, an association of this angelic name with death cannot be identified in Judaism.

After the emergence of Islam, the name Azrael became popular among both Christian and Islamic literature and folklore. The name spelled as &quot;Ezrā’ël&quot; appears in the Classical Ethiopic version of Apocalypse of Peter (dating to the 16th century) as an angel of hell who avenges those who had been wronged during life.

== Islam ==

Before the creation of man, only Azrael succeeded in taking dust from Earth in order to bring God the materials needed to make man. For this success he was made the angel of death and given a register of all mankind.
Along with Gabriel, Michael, and Israfil, Azrael is one of the four major archangels in Islam. He is responsible for taking the souls of the deceased away from the body. Azrael does not act independently, but is only informed by God when the time is up to take a soul.

=== In Quran and its exegesis ===
Surah 32:11 mentions the angel of death identified with Azrael. Surah 6:61 mentions a multitude of angels of death interpreted as assistants of Azrael. When the unbelievers in hell cry out for help, an angel, also identified with Azrael, will appear on the horizon and tell them that they have to remain.

The eighth Umayyad Caliph Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz once reported the commentary regarding Azrael in Quran chapter As-Sajdah verse 11 , that taking many lives are very easy for the angel, that in caliph&#x27;s words &quot;it is as if the entire mankind of earth were only like a dish on a plate from the perspective of &quot;Malak al-Mawt&quot; (angel of death)&quot;.

=== In Hadiths ===
According to one Muslim tradition, 40 days before the death of a person approaches, God drops a leaf from a tree below the heavenly throne, on which Azrael reads the name of the person he must take with him. Al-Qurtubi narrated commentary from classical scholar, Ibn Zhafar al-Wa&#x27;izh, that Azrael, has a shape resembling a blue colored ram, has numerous eyes in numerous places, and according to , a tabiʾ scholar, the size of Azrael were so huge that &quot;if the Earth were put on his shoulder, it would be like a bean in an open field&quot;. He also had 4,000 wings which consisted of two types, wings of grace and wings of punishment. The wings of punishment are made from iron rods, hooks, and scissors. Muqatil ibn Sulayman has recorded his commentary in his commentary work, &quot;al-Suluk&quot;, the angel possessed 70,000 limbs of foot.

Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz, an Umayyad caliph, reported a narration that the angel of death is armed with a flaming whip. Caliph Umar also reported a narration that the angel of death was so huge that he dwarfed Bearers of the Throne, group of angels which are known as the biggest among angels.

The &quot;Islamic Book of Dead&quot; describes him with 4 faces, and his whole body consists of eyes and tongues whose number corresponds to the number of humans inhabiting the Earth.

The angel of death features in a famous extra-Quranic creation story regarding the creation of Adam, recorded by various Muslim scholars, including Tabari, Mas&#x27;udi, Maqdisi, Kisa&#x27;i, Tha&#x27;labi, Ibn Kathir in his work &quot;Qiṣaṣ al-Anbiyā&quot; (Stories of the Prophets), and Muqatil. Accordingly, God ordered the archangels to collect dust from earth from which Adam is supposed to be created. Only Azrael succeeded, whereupon he was destined to become the angel concerning life and death, a reference to show the close connection between these two.

=== Relationship between Azrael and Death ===
Islam elaborated further narratives concerning the relation between Azrael and Death. Christian Lange mentioned that according to some scholars Azrael and Death were one entity; other exegesis scholars opined Azrael and Death were different entities, with Death as some kind of tool used by Azrael to take life.

One account explains death and its relation to Azrael, representing &quot;Death&quot; and Azrael as former two separate entities, but when God created Death, God ordered the angels to look upon it and they swoon for a thousand years. After the angels regained consciousness, Death recognized that it must submit to Azrael. This opinion were shared among scholars of Islam such as Sultan ibn ‘Abdirrahman Al-‘Umairi, in his book &quot;Al-‘Uquud Adz-Dzahabiyyah ‘alaa Maqaasid Al-‘Aqiidah Al-Waasithiyyah&quot; where he adds commentary the Hadith about Death will be materialized after the judgment day in form of a Ram, which said as different entity than Angel Azrael. According to one narration, Azrael is rewarded to become the angel of death for successfully carrying the dirt of the earth from which Adam would be created.

The identification of &quot;Death&quot; and angel Azrael as one entity were explained in a Hadith about the fate of &quot;Death&quot; entity itself after the judgment day, where classical Hanafite scholar Badr al-Din al-Ayni has interpreted in that Hadith which compiled in Sahih Bukhari collection, that Death would take on the form of a ram, then placed between paradise and hell, and finally slaughtered by God himself, causing Death cease to exist, which followed by God to declare to both people of paradise and hell that eternity has begun, and their state will never end. Lange mentioned that according to some scholars, the ram in that Hadith narration is no other than the angel of death himself, while others assert, this to be death&#x27;s own form in the hereafter. In other account sourced from Muqatil ibn Sulayman, Azrael and death were said as one entity as he reported the angel has number of faces and hands equal to the number of living creatures on his body, where each of those faces and hands are connected with the life of each souls in the living world. Whenever a face within Azrael body vanished, then the soul which connected with it will experience death.

=== Saints and prophets ===
A common belief holds that the lesser angels of death are for the common people, while saints and prophets meet the archangel of death himself. Great prophets, such as Moses and Muhammad are invited politely by him, but saints are also said to meet Azrael in beautiful forms.

It is said that, when Rumi was about to die, he laid in his bed and met Azrael in human shape. The belief that Azrael appears to saints before they actually die to prepare themselves for death, is also attested by the testament of Nasir Khusraw, in which he claims to have met Azrael during his sleep, informing him about his upcoming death. According to the Sufi teacher Al-Jili, Azrael appears to the soul in a form provided by its most powerful metaphors.

It is believed to resist the pulling of the soul by the angel of death by accusing him of acting arbitrarily. In that case, the angel of death returns to heaven to bring proof for following heavenly instructions.

==Western reception==

The Islamic notion of Azrael, including some narratives such as the tale of Solomon, a &quot;hadith&quot; reaching back to Shahr Ibn Hawshab, was already known in the United States in the 18th century as attested by Gregory Sharpe and James Harris.

Some Western adaptions extended the physical description of Azrael, hence the poet Leigh Hunt depicts Azrael as wearing a black-hooded cloak. Although lacking the eminent scythe, his portrayal nevertheless resembles the Grim Reaper. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow mentions Azrael in &quot;&quot; as an angel of death, but he is not equated with Samael, the angel of death in Jewish lore who appears as a fallen and malevolent angel, instead. Azrael also appears in G. K. Chesterton&#x27;s poem &quot;Lepanto&quot; as one of the Islamic spirits commanded by &quot;Mahound&quot; (Muhammad) to resist Don John of Austria&#x27;s crusade. In &quot;The Smurfs&quot;, the cat of the evil wizard Gargamel is called Azrael.

In Joy Williams&#x27;s 2024 novel &quot;Concerning the Future of Souls&quot;, Azrael is a core character, although his responsibilities extend beyond serving as a psychopomp for humanity alone—he also collects the souls of other sentient beings on Earth, such as whales and apes. Williams&#x27; book describes ninety nine story accounts of his duties and interactions with multiple souls, God, Satan and countless others.

<doc id="378465" wikidata="Q2140526" url="?curid=378465" title="Swaption">
<text>A swaption is an option granting its owner the right but not the obligation to enter into an underlying swap. Although options can be traded on a variety of swaps, the term &quot;swaption&quot; typically refers to options on interest rate swaps.

==Types== 
There are two types of swaption contracts (analogous to put and call options):
*A payer swaption gives the owner of the swaption the right to enter into a swap where they pay the fixed leg and receive the floating leg.
*A receiver swaption gives the owner of the swaption the right to enter into a swap in which they will receive the fixed leg, and pay the floating leg.
In addition, a &quot;straddle&quot; refers to a combination of a receiver and a payer option on the same underlying swap.

The buyer and seller of the swaption agree on:
*The premium (price) of the swaption
*Length of the option period (which usually ends two business days prior to the start date of the underlying swap),
*The terms of the underlying swap, including:
**Notional amount (with amortization amounts, if any)
**The fixed rate (which equals the strike of the swaption) and payment frequency for the fixed leg
**The frequency of observation for the floating leg of the swap (for example, 3 month Libor paid quarterly)

There are two possible settlement conventions. Swaptions can be settled physically (i.e., at expiry the swap is entered between the two parties) or cash-settled, where the value of the swap at expiry is paid according to a market-standard formula.

==Swaption market==
The participants in the swaption market are predominantly large corporations, banks, financial institutions and hedge funds. End users such as corporations and banks typically use swaptions to manage interest rate risk arising from their core business or from their financing arrangements. For example, a corporation wanting protection from rising interest rates might buy a payer swaption. A bank that holds a mortgage portfolio might buy a receiver swaption to protect against lower interest rates that might lead to early prepayment of the mortgages. A hedge fund believing that interest rates will not rise by more than a certain amount might sell a payer swaption aiming to make money by collecting the premium. Investment banks make markets in swaptions in the major currencies, and these banks trade amongst themselves in the swaption interbank market. The market-making banks typically manage large portfolios of swaptions that they have written with various counterparties. A significant investment in technology and human capital is required to properly monitor and risk-manage the resulting exposure. Swaption markets exist in most of the major currencies in the world, the largest markets being in U.S. dollars, euro, sterling and Japanese yen.

The swaption market is primarily over-the-counter (OTC), i.e., not cleared or traded on an exchange. Legally, a swaption is a contract granting a party the right to enter an agreement with another counterparty to exchange the required payments. The owner (&quot;buyer&quot;) of the swaption is exposed to a failure by the &quot;seller&quot; to enter the swap upon expiry (or to pay the agreed payoff in the case of a cash-settled swaption). Often this exposure is mitigated through the use of collateral agreements whereby variation margin is posted to cover the anticipated future exposure.

==Swaption exercise styles==
There are three main styles that define the exercise of the swaption:
*European swaption, in which the owner is allowed to enter the swap only at the start of the swap. These are the standard in the marketplace.
*Bermudan swaption, in which the owner is allowed to enter the swap on multiple specified dates, typically coupon dates during the life of the underlying swap.
*American swaption, in which the owner is allowed to enter the swap on any day that falls within a range of two dates.

Exotic desks may be willing to create customised types of swaptions, analogous to exotic options. These can involve bespoke exercise rules, or a non-constant swap notional.

==Valuation==

The valuation of swaptions is complicated in that the at-the-money level is the forward swap rate, being the forward rate that would apply between the maturity of the option—time m—and the tenor of the underlying swap such that the swap, at time m, would have an &quot;NPV&quot; of zero; see swap valuation. Moneyness, therefore, is determined based on whether the strike rate is higher, lower, or at the same level as the forward swap rate.

Addressing this, quantitative analysts value swaptions by constructing complex lattice-based term structure and short-rate models that describe the movement of interest rates over time. However, a standard practice, particularly amongst traders, to whom &quot;speed&quot; of calculation is more important, is to value European swaptions using the Black model. For American- and Bermudan- styled options, where exercise is permitted prior to maturity, only the lattice based approach is applicable.

*In valuing European swaptions using the Black model, the underlier is treated as a forward contract on a swap. Here, as mentioned, the forward price is the forward swap rate. The volatility is typically &quot;read-off&quot; a two dimensional grid (&quot;cube&quot;) of at-the-money volatilities as observed from prices in the Interbank swaption market. On this grid, one axis is the time to expiration and the other is the length of the underlying swap. Adjustments may then be made for moneyness; see .
*To use the lattice based approach, the analyst constructs a &quot;tree&quot; of short rates—a zeroeth step—consistent with today&#x27;s yield curve and short rate (caplet) volatility, and where the final time step of the tree corresponds to the date of the underlying swap&#x27;s maturity. Models commonly used here are Ho–Lee, Black-Derman-Toy and Hull-White. Using this tree, (1) the swap is valued at each node by &quot;stepping backwards&quot; through the tree, where at each node, its value is the discounted expected value of the up- and down-nodes in the later time step, added to which is the discounted value of payments made during the time step in question, and noting that floating payments are based on the short rate at each tree-node. Then (2), the option is valued similar to the approach for equity options: at nodes in the time-step corresponding to option maturity, value is based on moneyness; at earlier nodes, it is the discounted expected value of the option at the up- and down-nodes in the later time step, and, depending on option style, of the swap value at the node. For both steps, the discounting is at the short rate at the tree-node in question. (Note that the Hull-White Model returns a Trinomial Tree: the same logic is applied, although there are then three nodes in question at each point.) See .

<doc id="378466" wikidata="Q215351" url="?curid=378466" title="Fidel V. Ramos">
<text>Fidel Valdez Ramos (; March 18, 1928 – July 31, 2022), popularly known as FVR, was a Filipino general and politician who served as the 12th President of the Philippines from 1992 to 1998. He was the only career military officer, who reached the rank of five-star general/admiral &quot;de jure&quot;. Rising from second lieutenant to commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Ramos is credited for revitalizing and renewing international confidence in the Philippine economy during his six years in office.

Ramos rose through the ranks in the Philippine military early in his career and became Chief of the Philippine Constabulary and Vice Chief-of-Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines during the term of President Ferdinand Marcos. During the 1986 EDSA People Power Revolution, Ramos was hailed as a hero by many Filipinos for his decision to break away from the administration of Marcos, and pledge allegiance and loyalty to the newly established government of President Corazon C. Aquino. Prior to his election as president, Ramos served in the cabinet of President Aquino, first as chief-of-staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), and later as Secretary of National Defense from 1986 to 1991. He was credited with the creation of the Philippine Army&#x27;s Special Forces and the Philippine National Police Special Action Force. After his retirement, he remained active in politics, serving as adviser to his successors.

Ramos died of COVID-19 Omicron variant at the Makati Medical Center in Makati on July 31, 2022, at the age of 94.

==Early life and education==
Fidel Valdez Ramos was born on March 18, 1928, in Lingayen, Pangasinan and grew up in Asingan town during his childhood. His father, Narciso Ramos (1900–1986), was a lawyer, journalist and five-term legislator of the House of Representatives, who eventually rose to the position of Secretary of Foreign Affairs. As such, Narciso Ramos was the Philippine signatory to the ASEAN declaration forged in Bangkok in 1967, and was a founding member of the Liberal Party. According to Fidel Ramos&#x27;s biography for his presidential inauguration in 1992, Narciso Ramos also served as one of the leaders of the anti-Japanese guerrilla group Maharlika, which was founded by Ferdinand Marcos. His mother, Angela Valdez (1905–1978), was an educator, woman suffragette, and member of the Valdez clan of Batac, Ilocos Norte, making him a second degree cousin of former President Ferdinand E. Marcos.

He received elementary education in a Lingayen public school. Ramos began secondary education at the University of the Philippines (UP) High School (now the UP Integrated School), in Manila, and continued in the High School Department of Mapúa Institute of Technology. He graduated high school from Centro Escolar University Integrated School in 1945. Afterwards, he went to the United States as he received an appointment to the United States Military Academy, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Military Engineering degree. He also earned his master&#x27;s degree in civil engineering at the University of Illinois and later took Civil Engineering Board Exam in 1953, where he placed 8th overall. He also held a master&#x27;s degree in National Security Administration from the National Defense College of the Philippines and a master&#x27;s degree in Business Administration from Ateneo de Manila University. In addition, he received a total of 29 honorary doctorate degrees.

===Marriage===
Ramos married Amelita Martinez on October 21, 1954, at the Central Church (now known as Central United Methodist Church) in Ermita, Manila. They started as friends while they were classmates at the UP High School and neighbors at Padre Faura Street in Manila. Together, they had five daughters: Angelita Ramos-Jones, Josephine Ramos-Samartino, Carolina Ramos-Sembrano, Cristina Ramos-Jalasco, and Gloria Ramos. They also have five grandsons and three granddaughters.

== Military career ==

=== Early career ===
Ramos went to the United States Military Academy at West Point where he graduated in 1950.

During his stint at the Philippine Army, Ramos founded the Philippine Army Special Forces. Later, he was named as the commander of the Army&#x27;s 3rd Division based in Cebu City, Cebu.

Ramos received several military awards including the Philippine Legion of Honor (March 18, 1988, and July 19, 1991), the Distinguished Conduct Star (1991), the Distinguished Service Star (May 20, 1966, December 20, 1967, and August 3, 1981), Philippine Military Merit Medal (May 23, 1952), the U.S. Military Academy Distinguished Graduate Award and Legion of Merit (August 1, 1990), and the French Legion of Honor.

=== Korean War service ===
Ramos was a member of the Philippines&#x27; 20th Battalion Combat Team of the Philippine Expeditionary Forces to Korea (PEFTOK) that fought in the Korean War. He was an Infantry Reconnaissance Platoon Leader. Ramos was one of the heroes of the Battle of Hill Eerie, where he led his platoon to sabotage the enemy in Hill Eerie.

=== Vietnam War service ===
Ramos was also in the Vietnam War as a non-combat civil military engineer and Chief of Staff of the Philippine Civic Action Group (PHILCAG). It was during this assignment where he forged his lifelong friendship with his junior officer Maj. Jose T. Almonte, who went on to become his National Security Advisor during his administration from 1992 to 1998.

=== Martial Law under Ferdinand Marcos ===

==== Implementation of Martial Law ====
In January 1972, Ramos was appointed head of the Philippine Constabulary, then a major service branch of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, which functioned as the country&#x27;s national police. He served at this post at the time Ferdinand Marcos imposed Martial Law on September 21, 1972.

In 1975, all civic and municipal police forces in the country were integrated by decree, and it became known as the Integrated National Police (INP), which was under the control and supervision of the Philippine Constabulary. As head of the PC, Ramos was &quot;ex officio&quot; the INP&#x27;s first concurrent Director-General.

==== Last years of the Marcos administration ====
Martial Law was formally lifted nine years later on January 17, 1981, but Marcos retained absolute powers. Due to his accomplishments, Ramos was one of the candidates for the position of Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines in 1981, as replacement to the retiring General Romeo Espino who was the nation&#x27;s longest serving chief of staff. Ramos lost to General Fabian Ver a graduate of the University of the Philippines, whom Marcos appointed to the top military post. Instead Ramos, a cousin of Marcos was named AFP Vice-Chief of staff in 1982, and promoted to the rank of lieutenant general, while remaining as PC-INP Chief.

On May 12, 1983, a new unit in the former Philippine Constabulary was organized to deal with so-called &quot;terrorist-related&quot; crimes, and named as the Philippine Constabulary Special Action Force as a requirement of General Order 323 of Philippine Constabulary Headquarters. Fidel Ramos and Gen. Renato de Villa were the founders of the unit. De Villa tasked Rosendo Ferrer and Sonny Razon to organize a Special Action Force. Subsequently, a training program called the SAF Ranger Course, was used to train the 1st generation of SAF troopers, which numbered 149. Of that number, 26 were commissioned officers while the rest were enlisted personnel recruited from a wide range of PC units such as the defunct PC Brigade, the Long Range Patrol Battalion (LRP), the K-9 Support Company, PC Special Organized Group, the Light Reaction Unit (LRU) of PC METROCOM, the Constabulary Off-shore Action Command (COSAC), and other PC Units. Later on, they changed the name of the course to the SAF Commando Course.

On August 8, 1983, during a speech in Camp Crame to commemorate Philippine Constabulary Day, Marcos announced his removal of Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile from the chain of command, and the creation of a new arrangement with himself as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces replacing AFP Chief of Staff Gen. Fabian Ver. Marcos also removed the operational control of the Integrated National Police from the Philippine Constabulary under Gen. Ramos and transferred it under the direct control of Gen. Ver; the Constabulary then had only administrative supervision over the INP.

=== Role in the EDSA Revolution ===

On February 22, 1986, Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile protested alleged fraud committed by Marcos in the 1986 snap elections, withdrawing support and triggering the non-violent People Power Revolution. General Ramos later also defected and followed Enrile into Camp Crame, and the duo shifted their fealty to Corazón Aquino, the widow of Senator Benigno Aquino and Marcos&#x27; main election rival. On February 25, the &quot;EDSA Revolution&quot; reached its peak when Marcos, along with his family and some supporters, fled into exile in Hawaii with the assistance of the United States government, ending his 20-year rule, leaving Corazon Aquino to accede as the country&#x27;s first female President. Later in life, Ramos would say he considered his role in the revolution as his &quot;atonement&quot; for his role in the implementation of Martial Law.

===Combat record===
When belittled by the press regarding his combat record, Ramos responded with trademark sarcasm (July 31, 1987):

===Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces and Secretary of National Defense===
After Corazon Aquino assumed the Presidency, she appointed Ramos as Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (1986–1988), and later Secretary of National Defense as well as Chairman of the National Disaster Coordinating Council (1988–1991), handling the government&#x27;s response to disasters such as the 1990 Luzon earthquake and the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo.

During this time, Ramos personally handled the military operations that crushed nine coup attempts against the Aquino government.

==1992 presidential election==

In December 1991, Ramos declared his candidacy for president. However, he lost the nomination of the then-dominant party Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino (LDP) to House Speaker Ramon Mitra Jr. Days later, he bolted from the LDP and founded his own party, the Partido Lakas Tao (People Power Party), inviting Cebu Governor Emilio Mario Osmeña to be his running mate. The party formed a coalition with the National Union of Christian Democrats (NUCD) of Senator &amp; DFA Secretary Raul Manglapus and the United Muslim Democrats of the Philippines (UMDP) of Ambassador Sanchez Ali. Ramos and Osmeña, together with Congressman (later House Speaker) Jose de Venecia, campaigned for economic reforms and improved national security and unity.

He won the seven-way race on May 11, 1992, narrowly defeating popular Agrarian Reform Secretary Miriam Defensor Santiago. His running mate, Governor Osmeña, lost to Senator Joseph Estrada as vice president. Despite winning, he garnered only 23.58% of the vote, the lowest plurality in the country&#x27;s history. The election results were marred by allegations of fraud as Santiago was leading the race for the first five days of counting but became second after a nationwide energy black-out, putting Ramos in first place. International media were already calling Santiago as the president-elect but withdrew their declarations because of the sudden change in positions in the vote tally. Santiago filed an electoral protest, but it was eventually junked by the Supreme Court. The quote, &quot;Miriam won in the elections, but lost in the counting&quot; became popular nationwide.

De los Santos alleged that Libyan leader Muammar al-Qaddafi had channeled $200,000 (5 million pesos) to Ramos&#x27; 1992 election campaign. Philippine election laws prohibit accepting contribution from foreigners. Ramos dismissed the claim as &quot;hearsay by itself, and is further based on a string of successive hearsay conversations&quot; and challenged anyone who believed the claim to produce evidence.

==Presidency (1992–1998)==


At the time of his accession in 1992, he was the first and only Protestant to date to be elected President of the Philippines with a Roman Catholic majority and the only Filipino officer in history to have held every rank in the Philippine military from Second Lieutenant to Commander-in-Chief.

The first three years of his administration were characterized by an economic boom, technological development, political stability, and efficient delivery of basic needs to the people. He advocated party platforms as an outline and agenda for governance. He was the first Christian Democrat to be elected in the country, being the founder of Lakas-CMD (Christian-Muslim Democrats Party). He was one of the most influential leaders and the unofficial spokesman of liberal democracy in Asia.

===Domestic policies===
==== Philippines 2000 ====

Ramos&#x27; policies were organized around a socio-economic program dubbed &quot;Philippines 2000&quot;, which envisioned the Philippines achieving a newly industrialized country status by the year 2000 and beyond.

The five points of the program were:
*Peace and Stability
*Economic Growth and Sustainable Development
*Energy and Power Generation
*Environmental Protection
*Streamlined Bureaucracy

====Peace with armed groups====

Contrary to expectations as a former military general, Ramos made peace with the country&#x27;s various armed rebel groups, kickstarting the process by creating a National Unification Commission (NUC) and appointing Haydee Yorac to be its chair.

Upon the recommendation of the NUC, Ramos eventually decided to grant amnesty to the rebel military officers of the Reform the Armed Forces Movement (RAM) led by Col. Gregorio &quot;Gringo&quot; Honasan and Capt. Proceso Maligalig.

Ramos was instrumental in the signing of the final peace agreement between the government and the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) led by Nur Misuari in 1996.

Although he battled Communist rebels as a young lieutenant in the 1950s, Ramos signed into law the Republic Act No. 7636, which repealed the Anti-Subversion Law. With its repeal, membership in the once-outlawed Communist Party of the Philippines became legal. It was also during his presidency that the Comprehensive Agreement on Respect for Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law (CARHRIHL), which provided a mechanism to monitor human rights abuses in the course of operations was signed between the government and the CPP on 16 March 1998.

====Economic reforms====

During his administration, Ramos began implementing economic reforms intended to open up the once-closed national economy, encourage private enterprise, invite more foreign and domestic investment, and reduce corruption. Ramos ended the government’s monopoly over the skies and opened aviation to new players. Ramos was also known as the most-traveled Philippine President compared to his predecessors with numerous foreign trips abroad, generating about worth of foreign investments to the Philippines. To ensure a positive financial outlook on the Philippines, Ramos led the 4th Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders&#x27; Summit in the Philippines in November 1996.

Under his administration, the Philippines enjoyed economic growth and stability. The Philippine Stock Exchange in the mid-1990s was one of the best in the world and his visions of &#x27;Philippines 2000&#x27; that led the country into a newly industrialized country in the world and the &quot;Tiger Cub Economy in Asia&quot;.

====Power crisis====
At the start of Ramos&#x27; tenure, the Philippines was experiencing widespread blackouts due to huge demand for electricity, the antiquity of power plants, the abolishment of the Department of Energy, and the discontinuation of the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant during the Corazon Aquino administration. During his State of the Nation address on July 27, 1992, he requested that the Congress enact a law that would create an Energy Department that would plan and manage the Philippines&#x27; energy demands. Congress not only created the Department but gave him special emergency powers to resolve the power crisis. Using the powers given to him, Ramos issued licenses to independent power producers (IPP) to construct power plants within 24 months. Ramos issued supply contracts that guaranteed the government would buy whatever power the IPPs produced under the contract in U.S. dollars to entice investments in power plants. This became a problem during the East Asian Financial Crisis when the demand for electricity contracted and the Philippine peso lost half of its value.

Ramos personally pushed for the speedy approval of some of the most expensive power deals, and justified signing more contracts despite warnings from within the government and the World Bank that an impending oversupply of electricity could push up prices, a situation that persists in the Philippines up to the present. Individuals linked to Ramos lobbied for the approval of some of the contracts for independent power producers (IPPs), which came with numerous other deals, including lucrative legal, technical, and financial consultancies that were given to individuals and companies close to him. Among the deals tied to IPP projects were insurance contracts in which companies made millions of dollars in commissions alone. All the IPP contracts came with attractive incentives and guarantees. Every contract was designed to give IPP creditors some degree of comfort in financing ventures that would usually involve huge capital and risks. Most IPPs were funded by foreign loans secured with a form of government guarantee or performance undertaking, which meant that the Philippine government would pay for the loans if the IPPs defaulted. The Ramos government continued signing IPP contracts even after the end of 1993 when the power crisis was considered solved. The World Bank came up with a report in 1994 warning that power rates would rise if the government continued to enter into more IPP contracts that would mean excess power. The World Bank questioned the ambitious projections of the government on economic growth and power demand from 1994 to 1998. It also warned that the power generated by private utilities&#x27; IPPs could duplicate those of the National Power Corporation and create an overcapacity. The World Bank said that the factors created considerable uncertainty in power demand, like substantial overcapacity, particularly under take-or-pay conditions and would require considerable tariff increases that would be unpopular with the public.

====Death penalty====

While campaigning for the presidency, Ramos declared his support for reinstating the death penalty. Capital punishment was abolished for all crimes in 1987, making the Philippines the first Asian country to do so. In 1996, Ramos signed a bill that returned capital punishment with the electric chair (method used from 1923 to 1976, making Philippines the only country to do so outside U.S.) &quot;until the gas chamber could be installed&quot;. However, no one was electrocuted or gassed, because the previously used chair was destroyed earlier in a fire and the Philippines adopted the method of lethal injection. After his presidency, some people were put to death by this means, until the death penalty was abolished again in 2006.

===Foreign policies===
====Spratly Islands====
In early 1995, the Philippines discovered a primitive PRC military structure on Mischief Reef in the Spratly Islands, off the coast of Palawan. The Philippine government issued a formal protest over the PRC&#x27;s occupation of the reef and the Philippine Navy arrested sixty-two Chinese fishermen at Half Moon Shoal, eighty kilometers from Palawan. A week later, following confirmation from surveillance pictures that the structures were of military design, President Fidel Ramos had the military forces in the region strengthened. He ordered the Philippine Air Force to dispatch five F-5 fighters backed by four jet trainers and two helicopters, while the navy sent two additional ships. The People&#x27;s Republic of China had claimed that the structures were shelters for fishermen but these small incidents could have triggered a war in the South China Sea.

====Migrant workers protection====
A perceived weakness of his administration was the situation in handling migrant workers&#x27; protection, a very major issue in the Philippines, as there are millions of Filipinos abroad throughout the world serving as workers in foreign countries, and their remittances to relatives at home are very important to the Filipino economy. On the eve of his 67th birthday on March 17, 1995, Ramos was on a foreign trip when Flor Contemplación was hanged in Singapore. His last-minute effort to negotiate with Singapore President Ong Teng Cheong and Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong failed and Ramos&#x27; return was marred with protests after his arrival in Manila. The protests also caused the resignation of Foreign Affairs Secretary Roberto Romulo and Labor Secretary Nieves Confesor from the cabinet. He immediately recalled Philippine ambassador to Singapore Alicia Ramos and suspended diplomatic relations with Singapore and created a special commission to look into the case, which was in part an effort to try to rescue his sagging popularity. The commission was led by retired Supreme Court Justice Emilio Gancayco.

As recommended by the Gancayco Commission, Ramos facilitated the enactment of Republic Act No. 8042, better known as the &quot;Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act of 1995&quot;, which was signed into law on June 7, 1995. Learning from the lessons of the Contemplación case, Ramos immediately ordered Philippines Ambassador to the UAE Roy Señeres to facilitate negotiations after learning of the death penalty verdict of Sarah Balabagan in September 1995. Balabagan&#x27;s sentence was reduced and she was released in August 1996. After tensions cooled off, Ramos restored diplomatic relations with Singapore after meeting Goh Chok Tong on the sidelines during the 50th anniversary of the United Nations in New York City.

====Asian Financial Crisis of 1997====

The 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, which started in Thailand, was a major blow to the end of the Ramos administration, with him stepping down with a negative GDP growth. The economy was hit by currency devaluation with the Philippine Peso dropped to ₱45.42/$1 in January 1998 from ₱26.40/$1 in July 1997. The same was true for the Thai baht, Malaysian ringgit, and Indonesian rupiah. Growth fell to about −0.6% in 1998 from 5.2% in 1997, but recovered to 3.4% by 1999. It also resulted in the shutdown of some businesses, a decline in importation, a rising unemployment rate, and an unstable financial sector.

====Clark Centennial Expo Scandal====
Supposedly, one of his notable contributions to the Philippines was the revival of nationalistic spirit by embarking on a massive promotion campaign for the centennial of Philippine Independence celebrated on June 12, 1998. However, charges of alleged massive corruption or misuse of funds blemished the resulting programs and various projects, one of which was the Centennial Expo and Amphitheater at the former Clark Air Base in Angeles City, supposedly Ramos&#x27;s pet project. The commemorative projects, particularly those undertaken at Clark, were hounded by illegal electioneering and corruption controversies even years after the Centennial celebrations. Clark Air Base at that point was already completely free of American interference and therefore conceived as a suitable venue for Independence Day. In 1992, all American military bases were transferred to Philippine control after the Senate rejected the military bases agreement with the United States.

Later on it was revealed through a special report by the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism (PCIJ) that the projects relating to the Expo site not only revealed the extravagance and inefficiency of the administration, but also served as a convenient vehicle to affect election fund-raising for the LAKAS political party of Ramos, which came at the expense of tax-payers and was in direct violation of the Election Code. The &quot;Centennial Expo Pilipino&quot; project, intended to be the centerpiece for celebrating the 100th anniversary of the country&#x27;s independence from Spain, also earned extensive criticism for being an expensive white elephant project that disadvantaged the government at the cost of or 1.7 percent of the country&#x27;s 1998 national budget. Six ranking Ramos cabinet members and officials, headed by Salvador Laurel (former vice-president), chairman of the Centennial Commission, were cleared by the Ombudsman and the Sandiganbayan. Ramos appeared before a Congressional Committee in October 1998 to help exonerate said officials of any wrongdoing.

====Charter change====
During his final years in office, Ramos tried to amend the country&#x27;s 1987 constitution through a process popularly known to many Filipinos as charter change or &quot;cha-cha&quot;. Widespread protests led by Corazon Aquino and the Roman Catholic Church stopped him from pushing through with the plan. Political analysts were divided as to whether Ramos really wanted to use charter change to extend his presidency or only to imbalance his opponents as the next presidential election neared. He also intended to extend the term limits of the presidency to remain in power but his political rival Miriam Defensor Santiago went to the Supreme Court and negated extending the term limit of the president, which preserved democracy at the time.

===Activities===

====EDSA II====
In January 2001, Ramos was instrumental in the success of the so-called Second EDSA Revolution that deposed Philippine president Joseph Estrada and installed then-Vice President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo as president.

Ramos was Chairman Emeritus of the Lakas CMD (Christian-Muslim Democrats) Party, formerly known as Lakas NUCD-UMDP or the Partido Lakas Tao-National Union of Christian Democrats-Union of Muslim Democrats of the Philippines.

At the height of the election-rigging scandal in July 2005, Ramos publicly convinced President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo not to resign from office. Ramos, who was also hounded by charges of electoral fraud during the 1992 elections which were never proven in the Supreme Court, repeatedly stated that the scandal is nowhere as grave as that of People Power Revolutions of 1986 and 2001, citing factors such as the stagnant Philippine economy in the final years of the Marcos regime as well as the allegedly massive corruption of the Estrada administration. According to Arroyo, he also showed full support to her during the failed coups in the latter part of her presidency.

===Advocacies===

Ramos also unveiled his proposals for constitutional change of the country. Citing the need to be more economically competitive in the midst of globalization and the need to improve governance for all Filipinos, Ramos suggested that government should start the process of Charter Change with a set deadline in 2007 (by which time the new charter and new government would take effect). Ramos supported the transformation of the country&#x27;s political system from the Philippine presidential-bicameral-system into a unicameral parliament in transition to a federal form.

Ramos represented the Philippines in the ASEAN Eminent Persons Group, tasked to draft the Charter of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN). He was also a member of numerous international groups and fora, and was the chairman of the board of directors of the Boao Forum for Asia (also one of the co-founders of BFA) and co-chairman of the Global Meeting of the Emerging Markets Forum (EMF). Ramos was heavily recommended for the position of the United Nations envoy to Myanmar (formerly known as Burma) in June 2006.

He served as the Carlyle Group Asia Advisor Board Member until the board was disbanded in February 2004. More recently, as a private citizen, Ramos was engaged in various private sector advocacies where he played prominent roles. These included; chairman, Ramos Peace and Development Foundation; chairman, Boao Forum for Asia; Trustee, International Crisis Group (ICG); Member, Advisory Group, UN University for Peace; Honorary Director, General Douglas MacArthur Foundation; Founding Member, Policy Advisory Commission, World Intellectual Property Organization (PAC-WIPO); Honorary Member, World Commission on Water for the 21st century; Member, International Advisory Council, Asia House; Patron, Opportunity International (Philippines); Global Advisor, University of Winnipeg; Honorary Chairman, Yuchengco Center, De La Salle University; Member, Advisory Board, Metrobank; Honorary President, Human Development Network (HDN) Philippines; Lifetime Honorary President, Christian Democrats International (CDI); and Chairman Emeritus, Lakas-Christian Muslim Democrats (CMD) Party.

Ramos was also a firm backer of the proposed Philippine Reproductive Health bill. During a meet-up with fellow RH bill supporters in May 2011, he urged President Benigno Aquino III to certify the RH bill as urgent, saying it is the &quot;right thing&quot; to do. During his administration, the Department of Health under Juan Flavier launched an intense drive to promote family planning. &quot;Asiaweek&quot; reported in August 1994 that under Ramos, &quot;family planning funding has quintupled.&quot; They also noted that President Ramos &quot;has gone the farthest of any administration in opposing the Church&#x27;s positions on contraception and abortion.&quot; As of 2024, Ramos was listed by the Forum for Family Planning and Development as one of its Eminent Persons.

Ramos was a member of the Global Leadership Foundation, an organization which works to support democratic leadership, prevent and resolve conflict through mediation and promote good governance in the form of democratic institutions, open markets, human rights and the rule of law. It does so by making available, discreetly and in confidence, the experience of former leaders to today&#x27;s national leaders. It is a not-for-profit organization composed of former heads of government, senior governmental and international organization officials who work closely with Heads of Government on governance-related issues of concern to them.

=== Ramos Peace and Development Foundation ===
After his presidency, Ramos founded the Ramos Foundation for Peace and Development (RPDEV) with offices located in the Urban Bank Building (now ExportBank Plaza) in Makati. The foundation is a non-partisan, nonprofit, non-stock organization dedicated to promoting peace and development in the Philippines and the larger Asia-Pacific region. RPDEV supports Philippine national interests and people empowerment.
Operating as a network of individuals and institutions inside and outside the country, it is meant to serve as a catalyst for constructive change, a medium for fostering unity, stability, and progress, and a force for mutual understanding.

=== Philippine Envoy to China ===
President-elect Rodrigo Duterte revealed in June 2016 that Ramos was the one who pushed him to run for office so that &quot;Mindanao will finally have a Filipino president.&quot; 

On July 23, 2016, Ramos was appointed by President Duterte as the Philippine Envoy to China to strengthen bilateral ties again after a much-heated diplomatic war over the South China Sea. On 8 August 2016, the Philippines him to Hong Kong to mitigate tensions. Ramos met with Fu Ying (chair of China&#x27;s Foreign Affairs Committee for the National People&#x27;s Congress) and Wu Shicun (president of the National Institute for South China Sea Studies). Ramos conveyed the Philippines&#x27; willingness to engage in formal discussions with China. The three issued a statement in their personal capacities emphasizing cooperation and dialogue between the two countries.

On November 1, 2016, Ramos sent his resignation after President Duterte returned from his state visit to China &quot;because the officials have taken over.&quot; Duterte accepted his resignation from the post on the same day. He was replaced by veteran journalist Jose Santiago &quot;Chito&quot; Sta. Romana.

After stepping down, while he continued to show support to President Rodrigo Duterte, he had been vocal in raising concerns and criticisms to his administration. In February 2017, Ramos raised his concern about impunity and unilateralism amidst the drug war. In May 2017, Ramos criticized government officials who went with Duterte to Russia, claiming they turned the President&#x27;s official visit into a &quot;junket&quot;, which the Palace later denied. In September 2017, Ramos said the Philippines continued to &quot;lose badly&quot; under the Duterte administration. Despite his criticisms, Duterte still saw him as his &quot;number one supporter&quot; and at the same time his &quot;number one critic&quot;, and even called him his &quot;everything.&quot;

=== COVID-19 pandemic ===

During the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines, he stayed under strict home quarantine and kept himself updated of the latest news including the pandemic. On June 25, 2021, he completed his COVID-19 vaccination by receiving his second dose in Ayala Alabang, Muntinlupa.

On March 18, 2022, on Ramos&#x27; 94th birthday, the Fidel V. Ramos Presidential Library was launched online. It became the first and so far, the only online presidential library in the Philippines. It was later revealed that Ramos was already ill at this time and was unable to take on visitors.

===2022 elections===
During the 2022 elections Ramos did not make his endorsement public but pledged support for the presidential bid of Leni Robredo, whom he had also successfully endorsed for vice president in 2016. This was despite the fact that his party Lakas–CMD had earlier adopted her rival Bongbong Marcos, who was the running mate of Lakas chairperson Sara Duterte, as its presidential candidate.

==Death and funeral==
On July 31, 2022, Ramos died from the complications of COVID-19 Omicron variant at the Makati Medical Center in Makati, at the age of 94. According to the radio station DZRH and his family statement, he has been fully or triple vaccinated, but he compromised his immune system; he also had suffered from a heart condition. At the time of his death, he was the second longest living president in Philippine history, only behind Emilio Aguinaldo by 186 days. He was previously the oldest living president, a distinction he held from Diosdado Macapagal&#x27;s death in 1997.
From July 31 to August 9, President Bongbong Marcos declared as nine-day period of &quot;national mourning day&quot;, whereas all national flags are &quot;flown at half-mast from sunrise to sunset&quot; as a sign of mourning. As a per prevailing policies about COVID-19 Omicron-related deaths in the country (during the Omicron time in the first 18-month period), Ramos&#x27; remains were cremated, making him the second Philippine president to have been cremated before initial burial after former President Benigno Aquino III in June 2021. His wake was held on from August 4 to 8 at The Chapels at Heritage Park in Taguig. On August 9, he was accorded a state funeral, which was the first for former Philippine president since Diosdado Macapagal in 1997, and his remains were inurned at the Libingan ng mga Bayani between former presidents Elpidio Quirino and Ferdinand Marcos, Sr.

<text>A spongocoel (), also called paragaster (or paragastric cavity), is the large, central cavity of sponges. Water enters the spongocoel through hundreds of tiny pores (ostia) and exits through the larger opening (osculum). Depending on the body plan of the sponge (which can be asconoid, syconoid, or leuconoid), the spongocoel could be a simple interior space of the sponge or a complexly branched inner structure. Regardless of body plan or class, the spongocoel is lined with choanocytes, which have flagella that push water through the spongocoel, creating a current.

The spongocoel is lined by a variety of cell types, each having a unique function:
* porocytes – line the pores of the sponge and are the structure through which water is taken into the organism
* choanocytes – exhibit flagella that create inward currents of water for the sponge&#x27;s stationary filter feeding mechanism
* amoebocytes – motile cells that perform various digestive functions within the sponge by transporting and/or storing food and excreting waste.

<doc id="378478" wikidata="Q7598717" url="?curid=378478" title="Stanford Axe">
<text>The Stanford Axe is a trophy awarded to the winner of the annual Big Game, a college football match-up between the University of California, Berkeley Golden Bears and the Stanford Cardinal. The trophy consists of an axe-head mounted on a large wooden plaque, along with the scores of past Big Games. Cal currently holds the Axe after defeating Stanford 24–21 in the 2024 game.

==History==
===Origins===
The Axe was originally a standard 12-inch lumberman&#x27;s axe. It made its first appearance on April 13, 1899, during a Stanford rally when yell leaders used it to decapitate a straw man dressed in blue and gold ribbons while chanting the Axe yell, which was based on &quot;The Frogs&quot; by Aristophanes (Brekekekèx-koàx-koáx):

===Theft by University of California===

The Axe made its second appearance two days later on April 15, 1899, at a Cal–Stanford baseball game played at 16th Street and Folsom in San Francisco. Led by Billy Erb, the Stanford yell leaders paraded the Axe and used it to chop up blue and gold ribbon after every good play by the Stanford team, while shouting the Axe yell. However, Stanford lost the game and the series, and the yell leaders debated if the Axe was a jinx and whether to dispose of it.

As Stanford students discussed the Axe&#x27;s fate, a group of Cal students seized it and ran off with the Axe. It in turn was passed from student to student, and a chase ensued through the streets of San Francisco, first followed by Stanford students and fans and second followed by the San Francisco police. During the chase, the Axe&#x27;s handle was broken off.

Cal student Clint Miller, who was wearing an overcoat so he could easily conceal the axe head, was the last to handle the Axe. As he reached the Ferry Building, he noticed the police inspecting the pockets of every boarding male passenger. Miller described what happened next in a letter he wrote in 1912:

Recent research indicates it is possible Miller may have used the historic Southern Pacific steam ferryboat Berkeley (Maritime Museum of San Diego) as the getaway boat. From there Miller took the Axe back to Berkeley where it was first stored in a fraternity (Chi Phi), and later in a bank vault. Two days later, Cal held its first Axe Rally.

===Recapture by Stanford University===

For the next 31 years, the Axe stayed in Berkeley as a prize of conquest. In 1930, 21 Stanford students plotted to take back the Axe from Cal. This group became known in Stanford lore as the Immortal 21 (including Gerald Bettman and Ed Soares); Cal partisans call them the Immoral 21.

Cal&#x27;s protection of the Axe at the time was intense—it was kept in a Berkeley bank vault and brought out, in an armored car, only for spring baseball and Big Game rallies. The Stanford group decided that their best chance would be right after the spring Axe rally, held that year on April 3 at Cal&#x27;s Greek Theatre 

After the rally, four Stanford students posing as photographers temporarily blinded Norm Horner, the Grand Custodian of the Axe, with camera flashes. In the subsequent scuffle, the Stanford students grabbed the Axe while several others disguised as Cal students tossed a tear gas (or smoke, depending on account) bomb at the Cal students who guarded it. The Axe was taken to one of three cars which sped off in different directions. Several other Stanford students (disguised as Cal students) further delayed attempts to recover the Axe by organizing a search party away from the direction of the getaway cars. Although several of the raiders were caught, the Axe made it back to Stanford where it was paraded around the campus.

===Use as a trophy===

For three years after the raid on Berkeley the Stanford Axe lay in a Palo Alto bank vault while both universities decided what to do with it. In 1933, both sides agreed to designate the Axe as the annual trophy to be awarded to the Big Game&#x27;s winner; in the event of a tie, it would be kept by the side already possessing the Axe.

However, the agreement did not stop students from both schools from stealing (or attempting to steal) the Axe. Since 1933, Cal students have stolen the Axe three times and Stanford students four times; the most recent incident occurred in 1973. On January 28, 1978, a group of Cal students paraded a carefully constructed replica of the Axe across the court of Stanford&#x27;s Maples Pavilion during the Cal-Stanford basketball game. This &quot;Fake Axe&quot; stunt led to erroneous reports in the following day&#x27;s papers that the Axe had been stolen, therefore some sources report 1978 as the most recent theft.

==Traditions==
Depending on which school holds the Axe, the trophy&#x27;s recorded score for the 1982 Big Game is changed.

This is part of the continuing dispute surrounding The Play, the last play in the final seconds of the 1982 game, which ended with a kickoff return marked by five laterals. During the play, the Stanford Band, believing the game was over and that Stanford had won, ran onto the field; the touchdown run through the band featured the last Cal returner, Kevin Moen, running through a Stanford trombone player, Gary Tyrell, in the end zone.

Referees declared the touchdown as legal, and California won the game. However, Stanford contends that one of the five laterals on that play was an illegal forward pass, and that a Cal player was tackled before he lateraled the ball. As a result, whenever Stanford wins the Axe, the 1982 score is changed on the trophy from &quot;California 25-20&quot; to read &quot;Stanford 20-19.&quot; Despite this practice, the official score (California 25-20) must be on the Axe prior to the start of each Big Game, no matter who has it at the time.

When Stanford has the Axe, it is guarded by the Stanford Axe Committee and kept in a secret location, when not on display in the lobby of the Arrillaga Sports Center. When California is in possession of the Axe, the Chairman of the UC Rally Committee acts as its custodian. It is generally displayed in the lobby of the Martin Luther King Junior Student Union Building.

During the Big Game, the Axe is displayed by the school that won the Big Game the previous year. The Axe is transferred at the Big Game during what is known as &quot;The Stare Down.&quot; With two minutes remaining in the game, the Axe is brought to the 50 yard line, where members of the UC Rally Committee and the Stanford Axe Committee wait until the end of the game to determine who will take the Axe. Once the game ends, the winner of the Big Game takes possession of the Axe until the next Big Game is played.

Currently, California has possession after winning the 127th Big Game on November 23, 2024 by the score of 24–21, continuing their four-year hold on the Axe.

Although Stanford leads the all-time series before and after the use of the Axe as a trophy, California still has held the Axe for a longer amount of time due to their 31 year possession before the recapture of the Axe by Stanford. During the time the Axe has been used as a trophy, Stanford has held it 48 times to California&#x27;s 38.

<text>The osculum (: oscula) is an excretory structure in the living sponge, a large opening to the outside through which the current of water exits after passing through the spongocoel. Wastes diffuse into the water and the water is pumped through the osculum carrying away with it the sponge&#x27;s wastes. Sponges pump large volumes of water: typically a volume of water equal to the sponge&#x27;s body size is pumped every five seconds.
The size of the osculum is regulated by contractile myocytes. Its size, in turn, is one of the factors which determines the amount of water flowing through the sponge. It can be closed completely in response to excess silt in the water.

<text>Milton Silva Campos do Nascimento (; born October 26, 1942), also known as Bituca, is a Brazilian singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist.

Nascimento has recorded 32 studio albums and has won five Grammy Awards, including Best World Music Album for his album &quot;Nascimento&quot; in 1998. He has collaborated with various artists including Björk, Pat Metheny, Caetano Veloso, and Elis Regina.

==Biography==
Milton Nascimento was born in the boarding house Dona Augusta in the neighborhood of Tijuca, Rio de Janeiro, where his mother, Maria do Carmo do Nascimento, was a maid. Maria raised her son on her own, until dying of tuberculosis when he was two, thereafter he was taken care of by his maternal grandmother. Nascimento was then adopted as a young child by the relatives of the grandmother&#x27;s former employers; Josino Brito Campos, a bank employee, mathematics teacher and electronic technician and Lília Silva Campos, a music teacher and choir singer. He moved with his adoptive parents to the city of Três Pontas, in the state of Minas Gerais. When Nascimento was a child, he was nicknamed &quot;Bituca&quot; because he pouted when he was upset, which made him look like a native &quot;botocudo&quot;. 

Nascimento took an interest in music as a child thanks to his mother, who studied under Villa Lobos. At four years old, he was given an accordion and began to sing. At 13 years old, he became a crooner in the group Continental de Duilio Tiso Cougo. Nascimento was also an occasional DJ on a radio station that his father once ran. He lived in the neighborhoods of Laranjeiras and Tijuca in Rio de Janeiro.

In 1968, Nascimento was married to a student named Lurdeca in Tijuca. The couple lived in Copabacana, though the marriage only lasted a month, later being annulled. After this, he chose to dedicate his time to music instead of marrying or having kids, however, he would later adopt a son, Augusto Kesrouani do Nascimento, in 2016 after ten years of knowing him.

=== Clube da Esquina ===
In the early stages of his career, Nascimento played in two samba groups, Evolussamba and Sambacana. He would also play in the group W&#x27;s Boys alongside Wagner Tiso in Três Pontas. In 1962, he recorded his first song &quot;Barulho de Trem.&quot; A year later, in 1963, he moved to Belo Horizonte, where his friendship with Lô Borges led to the Clube da Esquina (&quot;street corner club&quot;) movement. Members included Beto Guedes, Toninho Horta, Wagner Tiso, and Flávio Venturini, with whom he shared compositions and melodies. One composition was &quot;Canção do Sal&quot;, which was first covered by singer Elis Regina in 1966, and led to a television appearance with Nascimento. The collective, as well as some others, released &quot;Clube da Esquina&quot; in 1972. Several hit singles were also released.

In 1967, he entered the Festival Internacional da Canção after Agostinho dos Santos had sent in three of his tracks to the search committee. He placed second with &quot;Travessia&quot; (&quot;Bridges&quot;) and was able to score a three-album contract with Creed Taylor who had been in attendance. He moved to the United States to record with Taylor, beginning with the album &quot;Courage&quot; in 1969.
Nascimento&#x27;s compositions include songs such as &quot;Nada Será Como Antes&quot; (&quot;Nothing Will Be As It Was&quot;), &quot;Maria, Maria&quot;, &quot;Canção da América&quot; (&quot;Song from America&quot;/&quot;Unencounter&quot;), &quot;Bailes da Vida&quot;, and &quot;Coração de Estudante&quot; (&quot;Student&#x27;s Heart&quot;), a song about the funeral of Edson Luís, who was killed by police officers in 1968. The song became the hymn for the Diretas Já social-political campaign in 1984, was played at the funeral of President-elect Tancredo Neves the next year, and was also played at Ayrton Senna&#x27;s funeral.

=== Diversification ===
While his reputation within Brazil was firmly established with his Clube da Esquina works, Nascimento&#x27;s international breakthrough came with his appearance on jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter&#x27;s 1974 album &quot;Native Dancer&quot;. This led to widespread acclaim, and collaborations with Paul Simon, Sarah Vaughan, Mercedes Sosa, Carlos Santana, Pablo Milanés, Cat Stevens, George Duke, Quincy Jones and Earth, Wind And Fire. &quot;Angelus&quot; (1994) features appearances by Pat Metheny, Ron Carter, Herbie Hancock, Jack DeJohnette, Nana Vasconcelos, Jon Anderson, James Taylor, and Peter Gabriel, among many others. Through his friendship with guitarist Warren Cuccurullo, Nascimento came to work with the pop rock band Duran Duran in 1993. Nascimento co-wrote and performed the song &quot;Breath After Breath&quot;, featured on the band&#x27;s 1993 album &quot;Duran Duran&quot;. He also performed with the band in concert when they toured in Brazil in support of that album.

In 1996, Nascimento contributed the song &quot;Dancing&quot; to the AIDS benefit album &quot;Red Hot + Rio&quot;, produced by the Red Hot Organization.

=== &quot;Ser Minas Tão Gerais&quot; ===

Nascimento starred in the 2002 musical theater piece &quot;Ser Minas Tão Gerais&quot; by the group Ponto de Partida. The piece paid homage to the poetry of Nascimento and Carlos Drummond de Andrade, two &quot;iconic&quot; poets from Minas Gerais.

In 2004, he worked with the Brazilian heavy metal band Angra, on the song &quot;Late Redemption&quot; from their album &quot;Temple of Shadows&quot;.

In 2016, Nascimento was awarded an honorary Doctor of Music degree from Berklee College of Music.

In 2018, Nascimento released the EPs &quot;A Festa&quot; and &quot;Nada Será Como Antes&quot;, consisting of acoustic reinterpretations of some of his past hits.

=== Collaborations and farewell tour ===
In 2020, Nascimento released &quot;Existe Amor&quot;, a four-track collaborative EP with São Paulo rapper Criolo. The EP was part of the &quot;Existe Amor&quot; project, a campaign for a solidarity fund for Brazilians in socially vulnerable conditions during the coronavirus pandemic. The campaign&#x27;s launch took place via projections on buildings in São Paulo to encourage donations to organizations such as É de Lei, SP Invisível and Arsenal da Esperança, among others.

On October 26, 2021, on his 79th birthday, Nascimento announced his 2022 farewell tour &quot;A Última Sessão de Música&quot; (The Last Music Session) on social media, although he would later state that he was not quitting music. The title of the tour is a reference to the track of the same name on his 1973 album &quot;Milagre dos Peixes&quot;. He played his last show on November 13, 2022, at the Mineirão stadium in Belo Horizonte.

On November 15, 2023, Nascimento released &quot;Outros Cantos&quot;, a collaborative album with sertanejo duo Chitãozinho &amp; Xororó.

On May 15, 2024, Nascimento announced a new album with American musician and songwriter Esperanza Spalding titled &quot;Milton + Esperanza&quot;. Recorded in Brazil in 2023, it was released on August 9, 2024, via Concord Records and received critical acclaim from music critics. The album was nominated for Best Jazz Vocal Album at the 67th Annual Grammy Awards. On October 29, 2024, Nascimento released the collaborative EP &quot;Moon Over Minas&quot; with American musician and producer Jonathan Wilson. The EP was recorded while Wilson was on tour in Brazil. Although Milton stated that he would be retiring from live concerts and tours, a NPR Tiny Desk (Home) Concert was published on August 7, 2024, featuring him, Esperanza Spalding, Guinga, Maria Gadú, among other artists performing five songs from the album. As NPR Music states in the description of the performance on YouTube, &quot;it’s likely to be the only video performance of this music&quot;.

<text>The German Federal Bureau of Aircraft Accident Investigation (, BFU) is the German federal agency responsible for air accident and incident investigation. 

The purpose of BFU is to find out the causes of air accidents and incidents and how they can be prevented. The BFU facility is located in Braunschweig, Lower Saxony. The agency is subordinate to the Federal Ministry of Transport.

West Germany joined the Convention on International Civil Aviation including the standards and recommended practices on aircraft accident and incident investigation (Annex 13) in 1956. Initially subordinate to the neighbouring Luftfahrt-Bundesamt (Federal Aviation Office), the Bureau of Aviation Accident Investigation according to a recommendation by the International Civil Aviation Organization in 1980 was put under the direct authority of the Federal Ministry of Transport. The BFU was formally established as an upper-level federal agency in 1998.
