The following is a list with the most notable dances. Names of many Greek dances may be found spelt either ending with -o or with -os. This is due to the fact that the word for &quot;dance&quot; in Greek is a masculine noun, while the dance itself can also be referred to by a neuter adjective used substantively. Thus one may find both &quot;hasapiko&quot; (&quot;the butcher thing&quot;) and &quot;hasapikos (horos)&quot; - &quot;the butcher (dance).&quot;

<text>Sir Clive Ronald Woodward (born 6 January 1956) is an English former rugby union player and coach. He was coach of the team from 1997 to 2004, managing them to victory in the 2003 Rugby World Cup. He also coached the 2005 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to New Zealand, losing the test series 3–0. He is currently a pundit for ITV Sport, working on their coverage of the Six Nations and Rugby World Cup.

==Early life==
Woodward was born in Ely, Cambridgeshire, the son of an RAF pilot. He started school at Corstorphine in Edinburgh and was later sent to the school ship HMS &quot;Conway&quot;, as his father disapproved of his ambition to play professional football. At &quot;Conway&quot;, he played rugby union at centre alongside fly-half Iain Duncan Smith, who would later become leader of the Conservative Party. According to Woodward, he was not selected to play for the Welsh Schoolboys side because he was English, but he was good enough to play rugby union for a Welsh school.

According to his autobiography, he applied to do a law degree at Durham University, but was turned down even though he was good enough and instead, he found a job at a London bank (NatWest).
== Playing career ==
His first club was Harlequins but he left to go to Loughborough University where he gained a Bachelor of Science degree in sports science followed by a Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE). He then played as a centre for Leicester from 1979 to 1985. He made his England debut against on 19 January 1980, as a replacement. England won the Grand Slam in that season, winning all their games. He went on to gain 21 caps for his country, playing his last game on 17 March 1984 against Wales. He was a player on the British Lions&#x27; 1980 tour to South Africa and 1983 tour to New Zealand. He was most noted for his centre partnership with fellow Tiger Paul Dodge. Playing for the Barbarians, he also won the Hong Kong Sevens in 1981.

== Rugby coaching career ==

He returned to the UK in 1990 to start his own IT leasing company and he became coach of the then obscure Henley Hawks, who were promoted to the national leagues. After a short but successful spell of coaching at London Irish. He became assistant coach at Leicester&#x27;s arch rivals Bath under Andy Robinson.

When Jack Rowell retired as coach of the England team in 1997, Woodward acquired the job.
He had the job of transforming the England side from the amateur era into the professional one. Having been quoted as requesting that the press judge him on England&#x27;s performance at the 1999 Rugby World Cup, when they were beaten by South Africa, his job was questioned. Thereafter England steadily improved under Woodward. England were Six Nations champions in 2000 and 2001, and completed the Grand Slam in 2003 with an emphatic 42–6 victory over Ireland in Dublin. England followed up by defeating the All Blacks in New Zealand for the first time since 1973, holding out for a 15–13 win despite being reduced to 13 men in the second half with two forwards in the sin bin. A week later reigning world champions Australia were beaten 25–14 in Melbourne, England&#x27;s first ever win on Australian soil.

England entered the 2003 Rugby World Cup as betting favourites and the number one ranked team in the world. Victories over , , , , and took England to the final, where they faced the hosts and reigning champions . England won 20–17 thanks to a Jonny Wilkinson drop goal in the final seconds of extra time. Woodward was knighted in the 2004 New Year&#x27;s honours. From 2000 to 2003, Woodward&#x27;s England compiled a record of 41 wins from 46 matches, which included a perfect record of 20 wins and no losses at Twickenham and 12 successive wins against the Tri Nations. England remain the only team from the Northern Hemisphere to have won the World Cup.

The England squad had to be re-built after the World Cup success, as a number of senior players retired, including captain Martin Johnson. Meanwhile, talismanic fly-half Jonny Wilkinson was sidelined with long-term injuries which would prevent him playing for England again for almost 4 years. England came third in the 2004 Six Nations, losing to Grand Slam winners France and Triple Crown winners Ireland. His last tour as England coach came shortly afterwards, with an ill-fated tour of New Zealand and Australia. England were beaten by New Zealand in two tests, without scoring a single try, going down 36–3 in the first and 36–12 in the second. The team then went to Australia, where they were beaten 51–15.

In February 2004 he was appointed head coach for the 2005 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to New Zealand. The Lions lost the test series 3–0. Woodward&#x27;s management was criticised by many commentators and players for his initial squad selection, his coaching methods, his handling of the players and the media, his selections on tour – particularly for keeping faith with the England players he knew well – and for not allowing the test team any time to play together before the test series began. He returned from New Zealand with his reputation within rugby severely tarnished.

On 24 October 2011, Woodward was inducted into the IRB Hall of Fame, alongside all other Rugby World Cup-winning head coaches and captains from the tournament&#x27;s inception in 1987 through 2007 (minus the previously inducted John Eales).

== Resignation and football coaching ==
Woodward&#x27;s contract with England was due to run until 2007. Following the retirement of key players like Lawrence Dallaglio and Martin Johnson, and finishing third in the Six Nations after the World Cup success, he found the politics of English rugby difficult to deal with, particularly the Premiership clubs&#x27; relations with the England management. Woodward was linked with a switch to football and, although he had denied these rumours, on 1 September 2004, Woodward announced that he would be quitting as England coach.

Initially, a move to Southampton Football Club seemed likely, as Woodward was a friend of chairman Rupert Lowe. Lowe discussed this possibility with the club&#x27;s board on 2 September 2004. However, in his resignation press conference, Woodward said that his intention was to take the Football Association&#x27;s Grade Two coaching badges after the 2005 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to New Zealand:

:&quot;I&#x27;m interested in, I intend to do the awards but I may end up coaching Maidenhead under-nines. You have to start at the bottom and I intend to do that.&quot;

However, Woodward continued his move into the Football League in 2005 by becoming Performance Director at Southampton Football Club, without undertaking any coaching at non-league clubs. With no experience of professional football, he again had problems with the politics of the situation, and was widely believed to have had a difficult relationship with the club&#x27;s then-manager Harry Redknapp. For example, his appointee as head of sports science, Simon Clifford, left the club in November 2005, after only two months, amid resentment from the club&#x27;s existing staff.

Following the departure of Redknapp in December 2005, Woodward was suggested as a possible candidate for the manager&#x27;s position at the Championship club, despite his lack of experience in the game. He was subsequently appointed Director of Football to work alongside newly appointed Head Coach, George Burley. On 31 August 2006 it was confirmed by Southampton that he was no longer working at the club.

== British Olympic Association ==

On 6 September 2006 it was announced that Woodward would be returning to sport as the new director of elite performance for the British Olympic Association. This is a role similar to that for which he was believed to be a candidate at his former employers the Rugby Football Union (Rob Andrew was eventually appointed to the position).

In 2007, he was appointed to the board of directors of Leicester Tigers as a non-executive director.

On 6 March 2008, he had the privilege to run with the Olympic torch while going through Russell Square, London.

At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing he acted as Deputy Chef de Mission and undertook a review of practices at the games in preparation for 2012 Summer Olympics in London.

It was announced on 4 October 2012 that Woodward would leave his post as director of sport at the British Olympic Association after six years.

==Books==

Woodward released his autobiography, &quot;Winning!&quot;, in 2004. He writes of the triumph of England in the 2003 Rugby World Cup, the preparations and celebrations, and of his personal life, his playing and coaching career. In &quot;Winning!&quot;, Woodward refers to Yehuda Shinar as one of the people who helped to turn the team around and who helped them win the World Cup. A biography of him, &quot;Clive Woodward: the biography&quot;, written by Alison Kervin, was published six months later.

==Charity==

Woodward is an Honorary President of the Wooden Spoon Society, a children&#x27;s charity that harnesses the support of the rugby world. Woodward played in the annual Gary Player Invitational charity golf tournament to assist golf icon Gary Player raise funds for various children&#x27;s causes.

==Personal life==
Clive Woodward is married to Jayne Williams; the couple formerly ran a computer leasing business together. They live near Maidenhead. Woodward was made an Honorary Doctor of Technology (Hon DTech) by his alma mater, Loughborough University in 2004.

<doc id="376538" wikidata="Q679488" url="?curid=376538" title="Truncated dodecahedron">
<text>In geometry, the truncated dodecahedron is an Archimedean solid. It has 12 regular decagonal faces, 20 regular triangular faces, 60 vertices and 90 edges.

== Construction ==
The truncated dodecahedron is constructed from a regular dodecahedron by cutting all of its vertices off, a process known as truncation. Alternatively, the truncated dodecahedron can be constructed by expansion: pushing away the edges of a regular dodecahedron, forming the pentagonal faces into decagonal faces, as well as the vertices into triangles. Therefore, it has 32 faces, 90 edges, and 60 vertices.

The truncated dodecahedron may also be constructed by using Cartesian coordinates. With an edge length formula_1 centered at the origin, they are all even permutations of
formula_2
where formula_3 is the golden ratio.

== Properties ==
The surface area formula_4 and the volume formula_5 of a truncated dodecahedron of edge length formula_6 are:
formula_7

The dihedral angle of a truncated dodecahedron between two regular dodecahedral faces is 116.57°, and that between triangle-to-dodecahedron is 142.62°.
The truncated dodecahedron is an Archimedean solid, meaning it is a highly symmetric and semi-regular polyhedron, and two or more different regular polygonal faces meet in a vertex. It has the same symmetry as the regular icosahedron, the icosahedral symmetry. The polygonal faces that meet for every vertex are one equilateral triangle and two regular decagon, and the vertex figure of a truncated dodecahedron is formula_8. The dual of a truncated dodecahedron is triakis icosahedron, a Catalan solid, which shares the same symmetry as the truncated dodecahedron.

The truncated dodecahedron is non-chiral, meaning it is congruent to its mirror image.

== Truncated dodecahedral graph ==

In the mathematical field of graph theory, a &quot;truncated dodecahedral graph&quot; is the graph of vertices and edges of the &quot;truncated dodecahedron&quot;, one of the Archimedean solids. It has 60 vertices and 90 edges, and is a cubic Archimedean graph.

== Related polyhedron ==
The truncated dodecahedron can be applied in the polyhedron&#x27;s construction known as the augmentation. Examples of polyhedrons are the Johnson solids, whose constructions are involved by attaching pentagonal cupolas onto the truncated dodecahedron: augmented truncated dodecahedron, parabiaugmented truncated dodecahedron, metabiaugmented truncated dodecahedron, and triaugmented truncated dodecahedron.

<doc id="376540" wikidata="Q929085" url="?curid=376540" title="Manuel Contreras">
<text>Juan Manuel &quot;Mamo&quot; Guillermo Contreras Sepúlveda (4 May 1929 – 7 August 2015) was a Chilean Army officer and the former head of the National Intelligence Directorate (DINA), Chile&#x27;s secret police during the dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet. In 1995, he was convicted of the murder of Chilean diplomat Orlando Letelier in Washington, DC, and sentenced to seven years in prison, which he served until 2001. At the time of his death, Contreras was serving 59 unappealable sentences totaling 529 years in prison for kidnapping, forced disappearance, and assassination.

== Early life ==
Contreras was the son of Manuel Contreras Morales and Aída Sepúlveda Cubillos. His parents died when he was six or seven years old. He completed his primary studies at the English Institute of Macul in Santiago. Afterward, his father relocated to Osorno, where he enrolled in the Lyceum of that city.

== Career ==
Contreras enrolled in the Military School in 1944 and graduated with top honors on 23 December 1947. In 1952, after achieving the rank of lieutenant, Contreras returned to the Military School, this time joining the Company of Engineers as a sapper instructor.

In 1953, Contreras married María Teresa Valdebenito Stevenson. During the same year, he became part of the newly-established San Antonio School of Engineers.

In 1960, Contreras enrolled in the War Academy to undertake the General Staff Officer course. It was there that he met Captain Augusto Pinochet, who served as the deputy director of the academy and taught strategy classes. Pinochet&#x27;s lectures were often centered around his concerns about the success of the Cuban Revolution.

Contreras successfully completed the General Staff Officer course at the War Academy in 1962, ranking first in his class. He was also appointed as a professor at the academy, teaching intelligence and logistics. In 1966, he returned to the academy, this time as a professor of intelligence.

== Under Allende&#x27;s government ==
In 1967, Contreras completed a Postgraduate Course as a General Staff Officer at the School of the Americas in Fort Gulick, located in the Panama Canal Zone. During his time there, Contreras became familiar with the repressive tactics employed against opposition groups.

Upon returning to Chile in 1969 with a major&#x27;s degree, Contreras assumed the role of an intelligence instructor at the Tejas Verdes School of Engineers. In 1970, he was appointed Secretary of the Army General Staff, and in 1971, he became the director of the Engineer Regiment No. 4 Arauco in the city of Osorno. It was during this period that he, along with a group of colonels and captains, began gathering information and devising an intelligence apparatus capable of infiltrating and dismantling leftist organizations.

Contreras established a network of informants in Chile, which included individuals affiliated with right-wing parties and groups like the Nationalist Front Fatherland and Liberty (Frente Nacionalista Patria y Libertad, FNPL). Simultaneously, he maintained contacts with agents from the CIA and the Naval Intelligence Office in Valparaíso and San Antonio, who were active in Chile at the time. These contacts provided him with manuals utilized by the secret police of various countries, such as the KCIA of South Korea, the SAVAK of Iran, and the National Information Service of Brazil.

A significant portion of Contreras&#x27;s focus revolved around formulating strategies to neutralize or undermine the industrial unions in which the Movement of the Revolutionary Left (MIR), the Socialist Party, and to a lesser extent, the MAPU, wielded considerable political influence.

By the end of 1972, Contreras was not only overseeing the Tejas Verdes School of Engineers but also instructing at the War Academy.

== Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional (DINA) atrocities ==

In part of his legal confessions, American-born Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional (DINA) operative Michael Townley described Contreras as the &quot;intellectual author&quot; behind the atrocities committed by DINA. In his March 13, 1978 &quot;confession,&quot; Townley detailed how his many missions for DINA, which even included Operation Condor operations in Europe and the assassinations of Orlando Letelier and Ronnie Moffitt, were carried out &quot;following orders from Gen. Contreras.” In a letter which Townley wrote to Contreras on March 1, 1978 under the alias J. Andres Wilson, he referred to him as &quot;Don Manuel&quot; and even indicated his belief that Contreras had not “let his Excellency [Pinochet] know the truth about this case” when he discussed the Letelier-Moffitt assassination.

== Operation Condor ==
From 1973 to 1977, Contreras led the agency in an international pursuit to locate and eliminate political opponents of the Junta, specifically targeting members of the Communist and Socialist Parties, as well as the former guerrilla group and political party MIR. On November 25, 1975, during Pinochet&#x27;s 60th birthday, leaders of the military intelligence services of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay convened with Contreras in Santiago de Chile to establish the Plan Condor officially. The report &quot;CIA activities in Chile,&quot; released on September 19, 2000, reveals that despite Contreras&#x27;s involvement in human rights abuses, the US government policy community authorized the CIA&#x27;s engagement with him from 1974 to 1977 to fulfill their mission in Chile. By 1975, American intelligence reports had identified Contreras as the main obstacle to implementing a rational human rights policy within the Pinochet government. However, the CIA received instructions to maintain its association with Contreras and even provided him with a one-time payment in 1975. The CIA became troubled by Contreras&#x27;s alleged role in the assassination of Orlando Letelier, a former Allende cabinet member and ambassador to Washington, as well as his American assistant, Ronni Karpen Moffit, in Washington, DC, on September 21, 1976. Although the CIA reportedly obtained specific and detailed intelligence suggesting Contreras&#x27;s involvement in ordering the Letelier assassination, this material remains classified and has been withheld at the request of the US Department of Justice (CIA, 2000). The CIA continued its contacts with Contreras until 1977.

After the assassination of Orlando Letelier, tensions between Contreras and Pinochet escalated during Contreras&#x27; tenure. As a result, the Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional (DINA) was shut down in 1977, and a new organization called the National Informations Center (CNI) took its place.

In 1976, Contreras, along with Gerhard Mertins, Sergio Arredondo, and an unidentified Brazilian general, traveled to Tehran. Their purpose was to propose a collaboration with the Shah regime to eliminate Carlos the Jackal. The exact details of the meetings and their outcomes remain unknown.

In 1978, Michael Townley agreed to an extradition to the United States in large part to seek protection from Contreras and Pedro Espinoza..

By 1979, Contreras had retired from the army, holding the rank of general until his death.

== Prison sentences and court investigations ==

On 13 November 1993, a Chilean court sentenced Contreras to seven years of prison for the Letelier assassination. He was freed on bail following the conviction, but the Supreme Court of Chile confirmed the sentence on 30 March 1995. Contreras rebelled against the sentence by fleeing to Southern Chile, and then to a military regiment and later a military hospital. After two months, seeing his support from the army vanish, he resigned and was sent to a military prison, where he completed his sentence on 24 January 2001 and was freed.

In May 2002, Contreras was convicted as the mastermind of the 1974 abduction and forced disappearance of the Socialist Party leader Victor Olea Alegria. He received 15 years in prison on 15 April 2003 for the disappearance of the tailor and MIR member Miguel Ángel Sandoval in 1975, but the sentence was reduced on appeal to 12 years. Also in 2003, he was sentenced to 15 years of prison for the 1974 disappearance of journalist Diana Frida Aron Svigilsky. He was amnestied in 2005, but the Supreme Court overturned that decision and confirmed the judgment against Contreras on 30 May 2006. He received another 15-year prison sentence on 18 April 2008 for the disappearance of the political dissident Marcelo Salinas Eytel.

Contreras was also convicted by an Argentine court in connection with the assassination of the former Chilean army chief Carlos Prats and his wife, Sofía Cuthbert in Buenos Aires, in 1974. An extradition request by Argentina was denied by Chile, but on 30 June 2008, a Chilean court gave Contreras two life sentences for the assassination of Prats and his wife, along with a 20-year sentence for conspiracy.

Contreras was sentenced on 23 September 2008 to seven years of prison in connection with the disappearance of the Spanish priest Antonio Llidó Mengual. He was ordered to pay 50 million pesos to compensate for the 1974 abduction of Felix Vargas Fernandez and received another 15 years of prison at a March 2009 sentencing. On 6 July 2012, he received an additional 10 years in prison over the detention and disappearance of the ex-militants José Hipólito Jara Castro and Alfonso Domingo Diaz Briones in 1974. In total, his sentences over the years totaled more than 500 years in prison.

In September 2013, under the orders of President Sebastián Piñera, the luxurious &quot;Penal Cordillera&quot;, in eastern Santiago, was closed, and Contreras was transferred back to &quot;Punta Peuco&quot; in Tiltil, north of the capital.

===Accusing Pinochet===
On 13 May 2005, Contreras submitted to Chile&#x27;s Supreme Court a 32-page document that claimed to list the whereabouts of about 580 people who disappeared during Pinochet&#x27;s rule. Human rights groups immediately questioned the information and its source and cited Contreras&#x27;s years of deception and denials of responsibility for human rights abuses. Many of the details he provided were previously known, and some contradicted the findings of commissions that have investigated the disappearances. In the document, he wrote that Pinochet had personally ordered the repressive measures. During the same May 2005 hearing to the Supreme Court, Contreras directly accused the CIA and the Cuban terrorist Luis Posada Carriles in the 1976 assassination of Orlando Letelier.

Contreras accused Pinochet of having given the order to assassinate Orlando Letelier and Carlos Prats. He also declared to Chilean justice in 2005 that the CNI, the successor of DINA, handed out monthly payments between 1978 and 1990 to the persons who had worked with DINA agent Michael Townley in Chile, all members of &quot;Patria y Libertad&quot;, the far-right movement that had been involved in the &quot;Tanquetazo&quot; : Mariana Callejas (Townley&#x27;s wife), Francisco Oyarzún, Gustavo Etchepare and Eugenio Berríos. Assassinated in 1992, Berríos, who worked as a chemist for the DINA in Colonia Dignidad, also worked with drug traffickers and DEA agents.

Pinochet died at the age of 91 on 10 December 2006, before any court could convict the former dictator of crimes related to his military rule.

==Illness and death==

During his final years, Contreras underwent thrice-weekly dialysis sessions at Santiago&#x27;s Military Hospital. On August 25, 2014, he was admitted to the hospital due to kidney problems and remained hospitalized. As his condition deteriorated, he was eventually transferred to the intensive care unit. On August 7, 2015, Contreras passed away at the hospital. The precise cause of his death was not disclosed by the hospital authorities. Following the announcement of his demise, a demonstration of several dozen individuals took place in front of the hospital, where they vociferously chanted &quot;Murderer!&quot; and raised toasts to his death with champagne. Additionally, hundreds of people gathered at Plaza Italia, a central square in Downtown Santiago, to celebrate the news.

<text>Kitt Peak () is a mountain in the U.S. state of Arizona, and at is the highest point in the Quinlan Mountains. It is the location of the Kitt Peak National Observatory. The radio telescope at the observatory is one of ten dishes comprising the Very Long Baseline Array radio telescope.

The peak was named in English by county surveyor George J. Roskruge for his sister, Phillippa, who was the wife of William F. Kitt. On his 1893 Pima County Survey map, Roskruge spelled the name &#x27;Kits&#x27;. At the request of the wife of George F. Kitt, the spelling was changed by decision in 1930.

Kitt Peak is the second-highest peak on the Tohono O&#x27;odham Indian Reservation, and as such is the second-most sacred after Baboquivari Peak. Near the summit is I&#x27;itoi&#x27;s Garden, which the nation&#x27;s lore holds summer residence of its elder brother deity. The name Ioligam means &quot;red stick&quot; in reference to the abundance of manzanita bushes on and around the mountain.

<text>The Cathedral of Christ the Saviour () is a Russian Orthodox cathedral in Moscow, Russia, on the northern bank of the Moskva River, a few hundred metres southwest of the Kremlin. With an overall height of , it is the third tallest Orthodox Christian church building in the world, after the People&#x27;s Salvation Cathedral in Bucharest, Romania, and Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral in Saint Petersburg, Russia.

The current church is the second to stand on this site. The original church, built in the 19th century, took more than 40 years to build, and was the site of the 1882 world premiere of the &quot;1812 Overture&quot; composed by Tchaikovsky. It was destroyed in 1931 on the order of the Soviet Politburo. The demolition was supposed to make way for a colossal Palace of the Soviets to house the country&#x27;s legislature, the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. Construction started in 1937 but was halted in 1941 when Germany invaded the Soviet Union during World War II. Its steel frame was disassembled the following year, and the palace was never built. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the current cathedral was constructed on the site between 1995 and 2000.

== Original cathedral ==

===Construction===

When Napoleon Bonaparte retreated from Moscow, Tsar Alexander I signed a manifesto on 25 December 1812 declaring his intention to build a cathedral in honor of Christ the Saviour &quot;to signify Our gratitude to Divine Providence for saving Russia from the doom that overshadowed Her&quot; and as a memorial to the sacrifices of the Russian people. It took some time for work on the projected cathedral to get started. The first finished architectural project, by Aleksandr Lavrentyevich Vitberg, was endorsed by the Tsar in 1817. It was a flamboyant Neoclassical design full of Masonic symbolism. 
Construction work was begun on the Sparrow Hills, the highest point in Moscow, but the site proved unstable. In the meantime Alexander I was succeeded by his brother Nicholas I. Profoundly Orthodox and patriotic, the new Tsar disliked the Neoclassicism and Freemasonry of the design selected by his predecessor. He commissioned his favorite architect Konstantin Thon to create a new design, taking as his model Hagia Sophia in the Byzantine capital Constantinople (present day Istanbul, Turkey). Thon&#x27;s Russian Revival design was approved in 1832. A new site closer to the Moscow Kremlin was chosen by the Tsar in 1837. A convent and church on the site had to be relocated, so the cornerstone of the new church was not laid until 1839.

The cathedral took many years to build; the scaffolding was not taken down until 1860. Its painting was overseen by Evgraf Sorokin, and thereafter some of the best Russian painters (Ivan Kramskoi, Vasily Surikov, V. P. Vereshchagin) continued to embellish the interior for another twenty years. The giant dome of the cathedral was gilded using the new technique of gold electroplating, replacing the older and insecure technique of mercury gilding. Although Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;1812 Overture&quot; was written with the building&#x27;s completion in mind, it had its world premiere in a tent outside the unfinished church in August 1882. The cathedral was consecrated on 26 May 1883, the day before Alexander III was crowned.

The inner sanctum of the church (naos) was ringed by a two-floor gallery, its walls inlaid with rare sorts of marble, granite, and other stones. The ground floor of the gallery was a memorial dedicated to the Russian victory over Napoleon. The walls displayed more than of Carrara bianca marble plaques listing major commanders, regiments, and battles of the Patriotic War of 1812 (with the lists of awards and casualties appended). The second floor of the gallery was occupied by church choirs.

===Demolition===
Following the 1917 Russian Revolution, the USSR&#x27;s official state atheism resulted in the 1921–1928 anti-religious campaign, during which many &quot;church institution[s] at [the] local, diocesan or national level were systematically destroyed.&quot; Following the death of Vladimir Lenin in 1924, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin chose the prominent site of the cathedral as the proposed site for a monument to socialism known as the Palace of the Soviets. It was to have modernistic, buttressed tiers to support a gigantic statue of Lenin perched on top of a dome with his arm raised in the air.

The government plans for economic development in Russia during the 1930s required more funds than were available at the time. In searching for additional sources of revenue and funding, government agencies saw monetary value in religious and historical monuments that had not yet been destroyed or otherwise repurposed for government use. On 24 February 1930, the economic department of the OGPU sent a letter to the Chairman of the Central Executive Committee asking to remove the golden domes of the Christ the Saviour Cathedral. The letter noted that the dome of the church contained over 20 tons of gold of &quot;excellent quality&quot;, and that the cathedral represented an &quot;unnecessary luxury for the Soviet Union, and the withdrawal of the gold would make a great contribution to the industrialization of the country.&quot; The People&#x27;s Commissariat of Finance did not object to this proposal.

On 13 July 1931, a meeting of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union was held under the chairmanship of Mikhail Kalinin. The meeting decided to build the palace on the territory of the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour: &quot;The place for the construction of the Palace of Soviets to choose the area of the Cathedral of Christ in the mountains. Moscow with the demolition of the church itself and the necessary expansion of the area.&quot; This decision was prepared at a meeting of the Politburo of the All-Union Communist Party (b) on 5 June 1931. 11 days later, the resolution of the Committee for Cult Affairs under the Presidium of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee was adopted:

In view of the allotment of the site on which the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour is located, for the construction of the Palace of Soviets, the said temple should be liquidated and demolished. Instruct the Presidium of the Moscow Oblast Executive Committee to liquidate (close) the church within ten days ... The petition of the OGPU economic department for gold washing and the petition for the construction of the Palace of Soviets for the transfer of building material to be submitted to the secretariat of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee. 

For several months, urgent work was carried out to dismantle the temple building, the remains of which it was eventually decided would be blown up. On 5 December 1931, the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour was dynamited and reduced to rubble. It took more than a year to clear the debris from the site. The construction of the Palace of Soviets was ultimately halted due to a lack of funds, problems with flooding from the nearby Moskva River, and the outbreak of World War II. Some of the marble from the walls and benches of the cathedral was used in nearby Moscow Metro stations. The original marble high reliefs were preserved and are now on display at the Donskoy Monastery. For many decades, these reliefs were the only reminders of one of the largest Orthodox churches ever built. The flooded foundation hole remained on the site, but in 1958 under Nikita Khrushchev, it was transformed into the world&#x27;s largest open air swimming pool, named Moskva Pool.

The huge area of evaporation generated by the huge water surface of the pool was the cause of corrosion of neighboring buildings. In particular, employees of the Pushkin Museum complained that the location of the outdoor pool negatively affected the safety of the exhibits.

==Restored cathedral==
The construction of the pool on a site of the destroyed cultural heritage caused a negative reaction of the Moscow public. The history of the site&#x27;s Cathedral, the unbuilt Palace of the Soviets, and the Moskva Pool was commonly summarized with the ironic expression &quot;First there was a church, then rubbish, and now shame&quot; ().

In February 1990, the Russian Orthodox Church received permission from the Soviet government to restore the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour. A temporary cornerstone was laid by the end of the year. The architect Aleksey Denisov was called upon to design a replica, but was soon fired from the project because of disagreements with the mayor&#x27;s office. When construction was well under way, he was replaced by Zurab Tsereteli.

A construction fund was initiated in 1992 and funds began to pour in from citizens in the autumn of 1994, and about one million Muscovites donated money for the project. In this year the Moskva Pool was dismantled and the cathedral reconstruction commenced. The lower church was consecrated to the Saviour&#x27;s Transfiguration in 1997, and the completed Cathedral of Christ the Saviour was consecrated on the Transfiguration Day, 19 August 2000.

Below the new church is a large hall for church assemblies. The cathedral square is graced by several chapels, designed in the same style as the cathedral. A footbridge across the river from Bersenevskaya embankment was constructed between 21 June 2003 and 3 September 2004 (photo). On the slope of the hill to the right of the cathedral the monument to Alexander II is located.

=== Significant events ===
In 2000, the cathedral was the venue for the canonization of the Romanovs when the last Tsar Nicholas II and his family, who were murdered by the Bolsheviks in 1918, were canonized as saints. On 17 May 2007, the Act of Canonical Communion between the Moscow Patriarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church and the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia was signed there. The ROCOR had been separate since the 1920s. The full restoration of communion with the Moscow Patriarchate was celebrated by a Divine Liturgy at which the Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia, Alexius II, and the First Hierarch of ROCOR, Metropolitan Laurus, concelebrated the Divine Liturgy for the first time in history.

The first Russian president Boris Yeltsin, who died of heart failure on 23 April 2007, lay in state in the cathedral prior to his burial in Novodevichy Cemetery.
In 2009 the cathedral was visited by Metropolitan Jonah (Paffhausen), former primate of the Orthodox Church in America, who celebrated the Liturgy with Patriarch Kirill I. Metropolitan Jonah later described the event, saying that even with a congregation of approximately 2,500, the vast church was only half full. About 16 bishops attended the ordination of a new bishop that day.

On February 21, 2012, Russian feminist punk rock group Pussy Riot staged a guerrilla performance in the cathedral in protest against Vladimir Putin, singing &quot;Mother of God, please banish Putin!&quot; Five members of the band participated in the said performance. Three members were identified, while the other two fled Russia. Those three members, Yekaterina Samutsevich, Maria Alyokhina and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, were jailed for hooliganism.

<text>Mary Russell Mitford (16 December 1787 – 10 January 1855) was an English essayist, novelist, poet and dramatist. She was born at Alresford in Hampshire, England. She is best known for &quot;Our Village&quot;, a series of sketches of village scenes and vividly drawn characters based upon her life in Three Mile Cross near Reading in Berkshire.

==Childhood==
She was the only daughter of George Mitford (or Midford), who apparently trained as a medical doctor, and Mary Russell, a descendant of the aristocratic Russell family. She grew up near Jane Austen and was an acquaintance of hers when young. In 1797, ten-year-old Mary won her father a lottery ticket worth £20,000, but by the 1810s the small family suffered financial difficulties. In the 1800s and 1810s they lived in large properties in Reading and then Grazeley (in Sulhamstead Abbots parish), but, when the money was all gone after 1819, they lived on a small remnant of the doctor&#x27;s lost fortune and the proceeds of his daughter&#x27;s literary career. He is thought to have inspired Mary with the keen delight in incongruities, the lively sympathy, self-willed vigorous individuality, and tolerance which inspire so many of her sketches of character. She cared for her mother and father until their deaths and supported them and herself by proceeds from her writing.

From age 10 to 15 she attended a school in Hans Place, Knightsbridge, London, the successor to Reading Abbey Girls&#x27; School, which Austen had attended a few years earlier. Her father engaged Frances Arabella Rowden, formerly governess to the family of Frederick Ponsonby, 3rd Earl of Bessborough, to give her extra tuition. Rowden was not only a published poet, but according to Mitford, &quot;she had a knack of making poetesses of her pupils&quot;. Rowden took Mitford to Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, especially to plays featuring John Kemble, and entranced her with the life of the theatre.

==Works==
Mitford&#x27;s youthful ambition had been to be the greatest English poetess, and her first publications were poems in the manner of Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Walter Scott (&quot;Miscellaneous Verses&quot;, 1810, reviewed by Scott in the &quot;Quarterly&quot;; &quot;Christina, the Maid of the South Seas&quot;, a metrical tale based on the first news of discovery of the last surviving mutineer of the H. M. S. Bounty and a generation of British-Tahitian children on Pitcairn Island in 1811; and &quot;Blanche&quot;, part of a projected series of &quot;Narrative Poems on the Female Character&quot;, in 1813). Her play &quot;Julian&quot; was produced at Covent Garden, with William Charles Macready in the title role, in 1823; &quot;Foscari&quot; at Covent Garden, with Charles Kemble as the hero, in 1826; while &quot;Rienzi&quot;, 1828, the best of her plays, ran for 34 performances, and Mitford&#x27;s friend, Thomas Noon Talfourd, supposed that its popularity detracted from the success of his own play, &quot;Ion&quot;. &quot;Charles the First&quot; was refused a licence by the Lord Chamberlain, but was played at the Surrey Theatre in 1834.

The prose, to which she was driven by the need to earn a living, was the most successful and financially rewarding of her literary productions. The first series of &quot;Our Village&quot; sketches appeared in book form in 1824 (having first appeared in &quot;The Lady&#x27;s Magazine&quot; five years previously), a second in 1826, a third in 1828, a fourth in 1830, a fifth in 1832. They were reprinted several times. &quot;Belford Regis&quot;, another series of literary sketches in which the neighbourhood and society of Reading were idealised, was published in 1835. Her description of village cricket in &quot;Our Village&quot; has been called &quot;the first major prose on the game&quot;.

Her &quot;Recollections of a Literary Life&quot; (1852) is a series of causeries about her favourite books. Her talk was said by her friends, Elizabeth Barrett Browning and Hengist Horne, to have been even more amusing than her books, and five volumes of her &quot;Life and Letters&quot;, published in 1870 and 1872, show her to have been a delightful letter-writer. The many collections available of her letters provide especially useful commentary and criticism of her Romantic and Victorian literary contemporaries.

== Reception ==
Mitford was a prolific and successful writer, though the quality of her prose has elicited mixed opinions. In his introduction to a 1997 reprint of selections from &quot;Our Village&quot;, Ronald Blythe stated that &quot;it is hard to know what to praise most, her style or her spirit. Both rise to heights rarely found either in the women&#x27;s journalism of her day or in a woman who by every law of the time should have been crushed by adversity.&quot; On the other hand, Tom Fort, writing in 2017, took the view that &quot;for a reader of today she is rather hard going ... She is, I&#x27;m sorry to say, trite, sentimental, long-winded, short-sighted, arch, chatty and twee.&quot;

Esther Meynell&#x27;s 1939 novel &quot;English Spinster: a portrait&quot; is a fictional treatment of the life of Mary Russell Mitford.

==Later life and death==
Mitford met Elizabeth Barrett Browning in 1836 and their acquaintance ripened into a warm friendship.

The strain of poverty told on Mitford&#x27;s work, for although her books sold at high prices, her income did not keep pace with her father&#x27;s extravagances. In 1837, however, she received a civil list pension, and five years later, on 11 December 1842, her father died. A subscription was raised to pay his debts, and the surplus increased Mary&#x27;s income.

In 1851 she moved from Three Mile Cross to a cottage in Swallowfield, three miles away, where she remained for the rest of her life. She died there on 10 January 1855, after being injured in a carriage accident the previous December. She was buried there in the churchyard.
==Legacy==
Her life was dramatised in the 1940 Australian radio play &quot;Three Mile Cross&quot; by Catherine Shepherd.

<doc id="376553" wikidata="Q5055862" url="?curid=376553" title="Cecchetti method">
<text>The Cecchetti method is variously defined as a style of ballet and as a ballet training method devised by the Italian ballet master Enrico Cecchetti (1850–1928). The training method seeks to develop essential skills in dancers as well as strength and elasticity. Cecchetti-trained dancers are commonly found in ballet and other dance companies throughout the world.

== History ==
The greatest influence on the development of the Cecchetti method was Carlo Blasis, a ballet master of the early 19th century. A student and exponent of the traditional French school of ballet, Blasis is credited as one of the most prominent ballet theoreticians and the first to publish a codified technique, the &quot;Traité élémentaire, théorique, et pratique de l&#x27;art de la danse&quot; (&quot;Elementary, Theoretical, and Practical Treatise on the Art of the Dance&quot;). Reputedly a very rigorous teacher, Blasis insisted on his students conforming to strict technical principles when learning to dance, a philosophy which Cecchetti learnt from his own teachers, who were all students of Blasis (Giovanni Lepri, Cesare Carnesecchi Coppini and Filippo Taglioni). Consequently, the key characteristic of the Cecchetti method is the adherence to a rigid training regime, designed to develop a virtuoso technique, with the dancer having a complete understanding of the theory behind the movement.

The other key influences on the Cecchetti method came from his own professional career as a dancer, which exposed him to many different techniques and styles of ballet. When he began to gain a reputation as a teacher, he experimented with these various styles, fusing the best elements of each to create his own ballet technique and training system, the eponymous Cechetti method. Such was the success of Cecchetti&#x27;s teaching, he is recognised as one of the key contributors to modern classical ballet, his method credited with significantly improving the teaching of classical ballet throughout Europe. Where previously ballet teaching had been haphazard and reliant on the preferences and style of the individual teacher, the Cecchetti method established the model of standardised teaching which is the basis of all professional ballet teaching today.

Initially, Cecchetti passed on his method by teaching it to his pupils and professional dancers, including well known dancers of the early 20th century, such as Anna Pavlova, Alicia Markova, George Balanchine and Serge Lifar. Many of his students later taught the Cecchetti method, including Ninette de Valois, Marie Rambert, Laura Wilson, Margaret Craske and Olga Preobrajenska. A number of professional ballet schools have historically used the Cecchetti method, including the Royal Ballet School, Rambert Ballet School, National Ballet School of Canada, and the Australian Ballet School.

In 1922, British writer and dance historian Cyril W. Beaumont collaborated with Cecchetti and Stanislas Idzikowsky to document the method in print, producing the &quot;Manual of the Theory and Practice of Classical Theatrical Dancing&quot;. This continues to be the standard resource for the Cecchetti method throughout the world and it has been replicated in numerous forms, including Benesh and Laban notation. The method was further documented by Grazioso Cecchetti, one of Enrico&#x27;s sons, in his treatise, &quot;Classical Dance&quot;.

The Cecchetti Society was established by Cyril Beaumont in London in 1922, with Maestro Enrico Cecchetti as its first president, and remained independent until it joined the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing, against the wishes of Enrico Cecchetti, in 1924. Today, the Cecchetti training system is used internationally to teach classical ballet.

=== Australia ===
The Cecchetti Society was established in Australia in 1934 by Madam Lucie Saronova. The Society grew over the next 51 years while being administered by the Council of Management in Victoria, under the auspices of The Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing in London. In 1987 &quot;The Cecchetti Society of Australia Inc.&quot; was formed as an autonomous Australian society under the administration of an elected National Council, composed of members from its state branches. The corporation&#x27;s head office is located in Melbourne.

In 1997 an international organization, &quot;Cecchetti International Classical Ballet&quot;, was formed by founding members from Australia, Canada, Italy, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the USA. This organization, which became a non-profit Canadian corporation in 2004,
is committed to keeping alive and raising the profile of the Cecchetti method of classical ballet and its training system throughout the world.

Today, the Cecchetti method is used at The Australian Ballet School, Victorian College for the Arts, and Queensland School of Excellence, and Xcel Dance Studios in Adelaide, South Australia.

=== United Kingdom ===
The Cecchetti teaching method was vital in the development of Classical Ballet in the United Kingdom and contributed heavily to modern-day British teaching methods. Enrico Cecchetti and his wife opened a ballet school in London in 1918, and his pupils included some of the most influential names in British ballet, many also influencing ballet throughout the world.

Dame Marie Rambert was a former pupil and colleague of Cecchetti, who also established a professional ballet school teaching his methods. This led to the formation of the UK&#x27;s first ballet company, which survives today as the country&#x27;s oldest established dance company, although it is now known as Rambert Dance Company and specialises in contemporary dance. The school also remains and is known as the &quot;Rambert School of Ballet and Contemporary Dance&quot;. Dame Ninette de Valois was a colleague of Cecchetti during her professional career with the Ballets Russes. She established The Royal Ballet in London, with many of the companies early dancers being pupils of Cecchetti. The Cecchetti method was also favoured by de Valois when she formed the Royal Ballet School. Phyllis Bedells, another Cecchetti pupil, would also play an important role in the teaching of ballet in Britain, as a founder member of the Royal Academy of Dance, which today is a classical ballet teaching examination board.

The British writer and dance historian Cyril W. Beaumont was a close friend of Cecchetti and, in 1922 he collaborated with Cecchetti to codify the training technique into a printed syllabus, &quot;The Cecchetti Method of Classical Ballet&quot;, which has become the foremost reference for Cecchetti method teachers worldwide. Cecchetti also gave Beaumont permission to establish the Cecchetti Society to maintain the method and ensure that it would be passed on to future ballet teachers in its original form. Branches of the Cecchetti Society were subsequently established around the world, most notably in Australia, South Africa, Canada and the US. The original Cecchetti Society still exists in Britain, although against the wishes of Enrico Cecchetti it was absorbed into the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing, which continues to maintain the Cecchetti method as a separate entity from its own &quot;Imperial Classical Ballet&quot; syllabus.

Today, the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing promotes the Cecchetti method as a syllabus-based series of dance examinations, which are taught by registered teachers around the world in both pre-vocational and vocational dance schools. The syllabus is a progressive series of graded and vocational graded examinations, which are accredited by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, the government-appointed regulator of qualifications in England and Wales. Successful exam passes in the Cecchetti method can therefore be submitted for credit towards other nationally recognised qualifications, however this only applies in England and Wales. These qualifications are in reality usually taken by the amateur rather than the professional dancer.

There are a few ballet teachers, such as Gavin Roebuck, who can trace their knowledge of the Cecchetti method in a direct line from pupils of Enrico Cecchetti, including generations of dancers trained at the Royal Ballet School, the Rambert School and Canada&#x27;s National Ballet School.

== Examinations ==
=== United Kingdom ===
In 2002, the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing, became an accredited dance awarding body. As a result of this change, its system of exams and qualifications were revised, including those of the Cecchetti faculty. The ISTD now operates a three tier system of qualifications, which are recognised by the national qualifications regulators of England, Wales and Northern Ireland:

* Graded examinations
* Vocational graded examinations
* Teaching qualifications

The system of teaching qualifications has been revised to include three levels of qualification. The first level, the DDE is compulsory for any person wishing to teach the ISTD syllabus and enter candidates for examinations. The Licentiate and Fellowship levels are optional, higher level qualifications that existed before 2002 and retain their previous status.

* Diploma in Dance Education
* Licentiate
* Fellowship

=== United States ===
Students are tested on their ability to properly execute a number of specifically choreographed routines that emphasize a particular ballet movement. They are also graded on their knowledge of the theory and terms.

Grades five through seven correspond to his original levels.

In the American version, there are a few different marks for passing a level. From lowest to highest they are:
*Pass on condition (bad and fairs) 
*Pass (fairs and goods)
*Pass plus (mostly good with a few excellents)
*Pass Commended (mostly excellent, a few good)
*Pass Highly Commended (perfect exam, no corrections, all excellent)

All exams have different sections that the student is graded on. These sections include theory, barre, port de bras, adage, allegro, petit allegro, tours, pointe work, musicality, quality, and style among other things. These are all part of the total grade. Dancers taking their grade four exam will be asked to choreograph a one-minute dance, with teacher supervision, and perform it to the examiners. Students taking their grade 7 will be asked to perform a variation to the examiners.

A dancer who achieves a pass condition must wait two years before attempting the next exam level.

Student level examinations: designed to be more technically demanding and to provide a solid technical base so that when the dancer reaches higher levels, they can focus more on artistry. Examiners will correct some things, such as pirouette and retire positions, without marking any of the students down unless they fail to correct. Levels: grade one to grade four.

Pre-professional examinations: career oriented, with a high level of ballet technique and artistry expected. Examiners will no longer teach in these levels and any correction will result in being marked down. Levels: grade 5 to grade 8/diploma.

Teacher Qualifying Examinations: Successful completion of these examinations leads to qualification with the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing. Levels:
A.I.S.T.D. - Associate (provisional registration)
A.I.S.T.D. - Associate Diploma (full registration)
L.I.S.T.D. - Licentiate
F.I.S.T.D. - Fellow (highest teaching qualifications and held by all examiners)

<text>Charles Kemble (25 November 1775 – 12 November 1854) was a British actor from the prominent Kemble family.

==Life==

Charles Kemble was one of 13 siblings and the youngest son of English Roman Catholic theatre manager/actor Roger Kemble, and Irish-born actress Sarah Ward. He was the younger brother of, among others, John Philip Kemble, Stephen Kemble and Sarah Siddons. He was born at Brecon in South Wales. Like his brothers, he was raised in his father&#x27;s Catholic faith, while his sisters were raised in their mother&#x27;s Protestant faith. He and John Philip were educated at Douai School.

After returning to England in 1792, he obtained a job in the post office, but soon resigned to go on the stage, making his first recorded appearance at Sheffield as Orlando in &quot;As You Like It&quot; in that year. During the early part of his career as an actor, he slowly gained popularity. For a considerable time he played with his brother and sister, chiefly in secondary parts, and received little attention.

His first London appearance was on 21 April 1794, as Malcolm to his brother&#x27;s Macbeth. Ultimately he won independent fame, especially in such characters as Archer in George Farquhar&#x27;s &quot;The Beaux&#x27; Stratagem&quot;, Dorincourt in Hannah Cowley&#x27;s &quot;The Belle&#x27;s Stratagem&quot;, Charles Surface and Ranger in Benjamin Hoadley&#x27;s &quot;The Suspicious Husband&quot;. His Laërtes and Macduff were as accomplished as his brother&#x27;s Hamlet and Macbeth. His production of &quot;Cymbeline&quot; in 1827 inaugurated the trend to historical accuracy in stagings of that play that reached a peak with Henry Irving at the turn of the century.

In comedy, he was ably supported by his wife, Marie Therese De Camp, whom he married on 2 July 1806. His visit, with his daughter Fanny, to America during 1832 and 1834, aroused much enthusiasm. The later part of his career was beset by money troubles in connection with his joint proprietorship of Covent Garden theatre.

He formally retired from the stage in December 1836, but his final appearance was on 10 April 1840. From 1836 to 1840 he held the office of Examiner of Plays. In 1844-45 he gave readings from Shakespeare at Willis&#x27;s Rooms. Macready regarded his Cassio as incomparable, and summed him up as &quot;a first-rate actor of second-rate parts.&quot;

<text>Flora Caroline Twort (24 June 1893 – 1985) was an English painter who specialised in watercolours and pastels of the scenes and people of Petersfield, Hampshire.

Flora was born at Yeovil, Somerset, the daughter of Albert Samuel Twort and his wife Jane (nee Rapley. Her father was a Surveyor of Taxes with the Inland Revenue, an employment that required constant relocation. By March 1898, he and his family had moved to Truro in Cornwall, where they remained for several years, before moving to Lambeth, and then Hampstead.

Twort began painting at the age of four, and was educated at the South Hampstead High School, London School of Art, the Regent Street Polytechnic and the Slade School of Art. At the end of World War I she moved to Petersfield, where she ran a secondhand bookshop at Numbers 1 and 2 The Square, in partnership with two other young women. The shop also sold handmade jewellery, pottery and textiles and gained a reputation as one of the finest book shops in the South of England. In 1934 she joined the Society of Women Artists.

Her studio was above this shop until 1948, when the three partners decided to give up the shop and Twort moved to a studio in the nearby Church Path. Her work was exhibited in the Royal Academy and other London galleries, and she continued to paint until she was 81.

Her pictures, usually watercolours, typically contain local scenes of Petersfield which are filled with people and animals, with such subjects as The Square on Market Day, or the fair on Petersfield Heath. She also produced drawings in pencil, crayon, charcoal and pastel, including some fine portraits.

Twort was a friend of Nevil Shute, who in 1925 proposed marriage to her, unsuccessfully, though they remained lifelong friends and she became godmother to his daughter Shirley Anne. For a short period in 1939, Shute and his family lived at The Old Mill at Langstone, which she owned.

On her death she bequeathed her studio cottage and pictures to Hampshire County Council. A selection of her pictures is now displayed in her old studios, which have become the 
Flora Twort Gallery; the selection is changed twice per year. Hampshire County Council has also put 600 of her pictures online.

<text>Gage Roads is an outer harbour area of Fremantle Harbour. It is situated in the Indian Ocean offshore from Fremantle, Western Australia, and incorporates a deep water sea channel. Gage Roads serves both as a shipping lane and as an anchorage for sea traffic heading towards the seaport of Fremantle. 

With Rottnest Island lying to the west of Gage Roads and Owen Anchorage and Cockburn Sound to the south, Gage Roads was the location of the 1987 America&#x27;s Cup.

==Coastal geology==
The area is the most northern of one of four coastal basins formed from the flooding of a depression between Pleistocene aeolianite ridges running north-south, and the subsequent deposition of east-west Holocene banks. The seabed of Gage Roads is covered by seagrass.

==Naming==
Gage Roads was named after Rear-Admiral Sir William Hall Gage who was the Royal Navy Commander-in-Chief, East Indies, when James Stirling was surveying the Swan River in 1826. In turn, the local brewery Gage Roads Brew is named after the area.

==Shipping reports==
Gage Roads is identified in shipping reports listing ships at anchor prior to entering the port of Fremantle.

==Anchorage==
At certain times, over 10 ships can be seen anchored in Gage Roads waiting to enter the port of Fremantle. In addition to these waiting ships, oversized ships that are unable to enter the inner harbour due to size or draft are required to anchor in Gage Roads.

==Cruising==
In the early 1900s, the local boat SS &quot;Zephyr&quot; regularly took cruises in Gage Roads. In the 2000s, the has used Gage Roads for short sailing cruises.

==Wartime==
During the World War II era, the Leighton Guns (also known as Leighton Battery) on Buckland Hill were part of the main anti-aircraft defence of the Gage Roads area.

The guns were still operable into the Gage Roads area in the 1950s.

==Swimming==
Swimmers in the Rottnest Channel Swim (an annual swimming event) start at Cottesloe beach, cross Gage Roads and finish at Rottnest Island.

<text>George Stephen Kemble (21 April 1758 – 5 June 1822) was a successful English theatre manager, actor, and writer, and a member of the famous Kemble family. He was described as &quot;the best Sir John Falstaff which the British stage ever saw&quot; though he also played title roles in &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;King Lear&quot; among others. He published plays, poetry and non-fiction.

Kemble wed prominent actress Elizabeth Satchell (1783). His niece was the actress and abolitionist Fanny Kemble.

== Early life and family ==
He was born in Kington, Herefordshire, one of 13 siblings and the second son of Roger Kemble and Sarah &quot;Sally&quot; Ward. His siblings included Charles Kemble, John Philip Kemble and Sarah Siddons. He and his brothers were raised in their father&#x27;s Catholic faith; his sisters were raised in their mother&#x27;s Protestant faith.

His daughter Frances Kemble was a music composer who was a favourite of Sir Walter Scott. She married Capt. Robert Arkwright., son of Richard Arkwright Jr. Kemble&#x27;s son Henry was also an actor.

==Manager==
Similar to his father, Stephen Kemble became a very successful theatre manager of the Eighteenth-Century English stage. He managed the original Theatre Royal, Newcastle for fifteen years (1791–1806). He brought members of his famous acting family and many other actors out of London to Newcastle. Stephen&#x27;s sister, Sarah Siddons, was the first London actor of repute to break through the prejudice which regarded summer &quot; strolling&quot;, or starring in the provincial theatres, as a degradation.

Stephen Kemble guided the Theatre through many celebrated seasons. The Newcastle audience quickly came to regard itself, that is, as &quot;in a position of great theatrical privilege.&quot; The original Theatre Royal was opened on 21 January 1788 and was located on Mosley Street, next to Drury Lane. While in Newcastle upon Tyne Kemble lived in a large house opposite the White Cross in Newgate Street.

Stephen Kemble took a temporary 12-month lease on the Theatre Royal, Edinburgh in 1792/3 but initially failed to take a long-term lease. He ran a temporary theatre nearby at the head of Leith Walk 1793/4 under the title of &quot;circus&quot; before securing long-term lease in 1794 and he held this until 1800 although with an interval created by Harriet Pye Esten. He also managed other theatres; The Theatre Royal, Glasgow (eventually replaced by Tivoli Theatre (Aberdeen)) (1795); Chester; Lancaster; Sheffield (1792); Berwick-upon-Tweed (1794); theatres in Northumberland; Alnwick (where he built a theatre, 1796) and rural areas on the theatre circuit. From Newcastle, Kemble ran the Durham circuit (1799), which included North Shields, Sunderland, South Shields, Stockton and Scarborough and the opening for the Stockton Races at Stockton Racecourse. He also managed theatres at Northallerton and Morpeth. In Broadway, he performed in the Assembly Room of the Lygon Arms (formerly known as the White Hart Inn). He also managed Whitehaven and Paisley (1814), Northampton Theatre, the theatre at Birmingham and Theatre Royal, Dumfries, Portsmouth. For a short time in 1792, actor Charles Lee Lewes assisted Stephen Kemble in the management of the Dundee Repertory Theatre

He supported the careers of many leading actors of the time such as Master Betty, his wife Elizabeth Satchell, his sister Elizabeth Whitlock, George Frederick Cooke, Charlotte Wattell, Harriet Pye Esten, John Edwin, Joseph Munden, Grist, Elizabeth Inchbald, Pauline Hall, Wilson, Charles Incledon, Egan. His nephew Henry Siddons (Sarah Siddons&#x27; son) made his first appearance on stage in Sheffield (October 1792), his younger brother Charles Kemble, Thomas Apthorpe Cooper, John Liston, John Emery, Daniel Egerton, William Macready.

Stephen presented London stars such as Edmund Kean, Alexander and Elizabeth Pope (née Elizabeth Younge), Mrs. Dorothea Jordan, his brother John Philip Kemble, Wright Bowden, his sister Sarah Siddons, Elizabeth Billington, Michael Kelly (tenor), Anna Maria Crouch, and Charles Lee Lewes.

== Actor ==

He was also famous for playing Falstaff. In 1783, Stephen made his debut with his brother John in London. Contemporary critics acclaimed that in this role Kemble achieved the &quot;optimum balance between comedy and gravity.&quot; After his performance in London at Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in 1802, the &quot;Morning Chronicle&quot; wrote that &quot;It is to be regretted that his associations in the country prevent him from accepting a permanent engagement in London.&quot; Kemble would return to play Falstaff in London at Covent Garden (1806) and the Drury Lane (1816), for which he received great acclaim. After Kemble&#x27;s death, &quot;The Edinburgh Literary Journal&quot; wrote, &quot;[Stephen] Kemble was perhaps the best Sir John Falstaff which the British stage ever saw.&quot;

Kemble also played the title roles in &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;King Lear&quot;, &quot;Othello&quot;, Shylock in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; and many other roles.

For &quot;The London Magazine&quot; John Taylor wrote, &quot;Mr. Stephen Kemble was an actor of considerable merit.&quot; Taylor writes about Kemble&#x27;s commitment to address injustice through theatre: &quot;All characters of an open, blunt nature, and requiring a vehement expression of justice and integrity, particularly those exemplifying an honest indignation against vice, he delivered in so forcible a manner, as to show. obviously that he was developing his own feelings and character. This manner was very successfully displayed in his representation of the Governor, Sir Christopher Curry, in the opera of &quot;Inkle and Yarico&quot;.&quot;

Taylor writes of Kemble&#x27;s reputation in the provincial theatre circuit: &quot;Stephen Kemble, who was an accurate observer of human life, and an able delineater of character and manners, was so intelligent and humorous a companion, that he was received with respect into the best company in the several provincial towns, which he occasionally visited in the exercise of his profession.&quot;

== Writer ==
He also published a dramatic play &quot;The Northern Inn&quot; (1791). The play was also known as &quot;The northern lass, or, Days of good Queen Bess, The good times of Queen Bess&quot;. The play was first produced on 16 August 1791, as &quot;The northern inn, or, The good times of Queen Bess&quot;, at the Haymarket Theatre (i.e. Little Theatre or Theatre Royal, Haymarket).

Kemble also published a collection of his writings &quot;Odes, Lyrical Ballads and Poems on various occasions&quot; (1809). About Kemble&#x27;s poetry, John Wilson (Scottish writer) stated, &quot;Stephen Kemble was a man of excellent talents, and taste too; and we have a volume of his poems... in which there is considerable powers of language, and no deficiency either of feeling or of fancy. He had humour if not wit, and was a pleasant companion and worthy man.&quot; Of particular interest is Kemble&#x27;s writing is his reflections on contemporaneous events such as the Battle of Trafalgar, the death of Lord Nelson, the death of Robert Burns, his conversion to the abolitionist movement and support of the Slave Trade Act 1807, the death of his brother-in-law William Siddons.

Stephen published a play with his son Henry Kemble (1789–1836) entitled &quot;Flodden Field&quot; (1819) based on the Battle of Flodden (1513), which was performed by Thomas S. Hamblin. The text is based on Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s Marmion: a tale of Flodden field. In six cantos. The play was first performed at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, on Thursday evening, 31 December 1818. &quot;The European Magazine, and London Review&quot; reported that at its debut &quot;the whole [play] went off without opposition, and its repetition, was received with applause.&quot;

An essay of his entitled &quot;In the Character of Touchstone, Riding on an Ass&quot; was published by William Oxberry in his book &quot;The Actor&#x27;s Budget&quot; (1820).

== Retirement ==

Kemble moved from Newcastle to Durham, and lived in retirement after 1806. In later life, Kemble took on less responsibilities in management and made only occasional appearances on the stage.

He was a close friend of another famous Durham resident, the 3 ft 3 inch tall Polish dwarf, Józef Boruwłaski. When these two friends - one little and one large - strolled along the wooded paths of the city, they were reported to be an interesting sight for the people of Durham.

Kemble&#x27;s last performance at Durham was in May 1822, a fortnight before his death at the age of 64. He was fondly remembered by the natives of Durham, and was honoured with a burial in the Chapel of the Nine Altars in the Durham Cathedral. His close friend Józef Boruwłaski is buried at the west end of the cathedral&#x27;s nave, beneath the north-west tower. The grave is marked with his initials J.B on a flagstone. The heyday of Durham theatre came to an end with Kemble&#x27;s death.

In 2013, lines from his ode to a Guinea were inscribed on the rim of a £2 coin issued to commemorate the 350th anniversary of the Guinea coin. &quot;What is a Guinea? &#x27;Tis a splendid thing&quot;.&quot;

<doc id="376560" wikidata="Q7623615" url="?curid=376560" title="Strict constructionism">
<text>In the United States, strict constructionism is a particular legal philosophy of judicial interpretation that limits or restricts the powers of the federal government only to those &quot;expressly&quot;, i.e., explicitly and clearly, granted to the government by the United States Constitution. While commonly confused with textualism or originalism, they are not the same, and in fact frequently contradict, as textualists like Antonin Scalia have noted.

==Different uses==
===Strict meaning===
Strict construction requires a judge to apply the text only as it is &quot;expressly&quot; written, i.e., read perfectly literally. This can contradict the commonly-understood meaning of a law. For example, consider a law that specifies &quot;the use of a knife when committing a crime should be punished by ten years in prison.&quot; This would commonly be understood as prohibiting the use of a knife to threaten or injure another person. However, read purely literally, the law would also mandate ten years in prison for dining and dashing if the diner were to use a knife to cut their food.

As a result of this distinction, nearly all textualists reject strict constructionism in this sense. Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia, a major proponent of textualism, said that &quot;no one ought to be&quot; a strict constructionist, because the most &quot;literal&quot; interpretation meaning of a text can conflict with the &quot;commonly-understood&quot; or original meaning. Similarly, many of the original framers of the Constitution were not strict constructionists; Washington, Hamilton, and Adams all took broad interpretations of the powers afforded to the federal government. An early attempt at limiting the federal government&#x27;s powers to only those &quot;expressly&quot; granted by the constitution was rejected at the constitutional convention, as many of the Founding Fathers did not originally intend for the constitution to be read in this manner. However, some fathers not present at the convention, such as Thomas Jefferson, would later argue for a strict interpretation of federal powers. James Madison (the Constitution&#x27;s primary author) tended to take a more moderate view, somewhere between the interpretations promoted by Jefferson and Adams.

===Common use===
&quot;Strict constructionism&quot; is also used in American political discourse as an umbrella term for conservative legal philosophies, which tend to be more willing to strike down federal laws and regulations for exceeding the authorities given to them by the constitution. One example of this is the major questions doctrine. The major questions doctrine limits the ability of the executive branch to enact broad or sweeping changes without express authorization from Congress, under the principle that few people would understand a vague statute to imply the existence of broad, sweeping powers 

Constitutional scholar John Hart Ely believed that &quot;strict constructionism&quot; is not really a philosophy of law or a theory of interpretation, but a coded label for judicial decisions popular with a particular political party. 

The term is frequently used even more loosely to describe any conservative judge or legal analyst. This usage is pervasive, but in tension with the legal meaning of the term. For example, on the campaign trail in 2000, when speaking on his choices for new Supreme Court Justices, George W. Bush promised to appoint &quot;strict constructionists in the mold of Justices Rehnquist, Scalia, and Thomas&quot;, though Thomas considers himself an originalist, and Scalia outright rejected strict construction, calling it &quot;a degraded form of textualism.&quot;

==History==
The use of the term &quot;strict construction&quot; in American politics is not new. The term was used regularly by members of the Democratic-Republican Party and by Democrats during the antebellum period when they argued that powers of the federal government listed in Article I should be strictly construed. They embraced this approach in the hope that it would ensure that the bulk of governmental power would remain with the states and not be usurped by the federal government via novel interpretations of its powers. Perhaps the best known example of this approach is Jefferson&#x27;s opinion arguing against the constitutionality of a national bank. Because the vagueness of Article I inevitably lent itself to broad interpretations as well as narrow ones, strict constructionists turned to the somewhat restrained descriptions of the powers of Congress that were offered by advocates of the Constitution during ratification. Thus, politicians who identified themselves as strict constructionists embraced an approach to constitutional interpretation that resembles what we today call originalism.

The term began to be used by conservative politicians such as beginning with Richard Nixon in 1968 when he was running for election. His pledge was to appoint justices that interpret the law and reinstate &quot;law and order&quot; to the judiciary. President Nixon appointed four justices that seemed (at the time) to be of that philosophy. One of them, Harry Blackmun, however, shifted leftward, while another, Lewis F. Powell, became a moderate. The other two, Warren Burger and William Rehnquist, were in the mold of what most think of in terms of strict constructionists. Gerald Ford, when running to serve a full term of his own, distanced himself from this issue. Ronald Reagan, however, also promised strict constructionists. All three of his US Supreme Court nominees loosely fell into this category. Still, Antonin Scalia was more of an originalist, while Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor and Anthony Kennedy were fairly conservative. Since Reagan, Republican presidents George W. Bush and Donald Trump, along with Republican nominee John McCain, have all promised to nominate strict constructionist judges to the courts.

==Criticism==
The term has been criticized as being a misleading or meaningless term. Few judges self-identify as strict constructionists, due to the narrow meaning of the term. Antonin Scalia, the justice most identified with the term, once wrote: &quot;I am not a strict constructionist, and no one ought to be,&quot; calling the philosophy &quot;a degraded form of textualism that brings the whole philosophy into disrepute.&quot; Scalia summarized his textualist approach as follows: &quot;A text should not be construed strictly, and it should not be construed leniently; it should be construed reasonably, to contain all that it fairly means.&quot; He continued with one real case to differentiate them:

The difference between textualism and strict constructionism can be seen in a statutory case my Court decided last term. The statute at issue provided for an increased jail term if, &quot;during and in relation to ... [a] drug trafficking crime,&quot; the defendant &quot;uses ... a firearm.&quot; The defendant in this case had sought to purchase a quantity of cocaine; and what he had offered to give in exchange for the cocaine was an unloaded firearm, which he showed to the drug-seller. The Court held, I regret to say, that the defendant was subject to the increased penalty, because he had &quot;used a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime.&quot; The case was not even close (6–3). I dissented. Now I cannot say whether my colleagues in the majority voted the way they did because they are strict-construction textualists, or because they are not textualists at all. But a proper textualist, which is to say my kind of textualist, would surely have voted with me. The phrase &quot;uses a gun&quot; fairly connoted use of a gun for what guns are normally used for, that is, as a weapon.

When you ask someone &quot;Do you use a cane?&quot; you are not inquiring whether he has hung his grandfather&#x27;s antique cane as a decoration in the hallway.

===Doctrine of absurdity===
In law, strictly literal interpretations of statutes can lead one to logically deduce absurdities, and the doctrine of absurdity is that common sense interpretations should be used in such cases, rather than literal reading of a law or of original intent. The absurdity doctrine is a doctrine in legal theory, also known as &quot;scrivener&#x27;s error exception&quot;; in which American courts have interpreted statutes contrary to their plain meaning in order to avoid absurd legal conclusions. It has been described as follows:

<doc id="376561" wikidata="Q7016166" url="?curid=376561" title="1999 New Zealand general election">
<text>The 1999 New Zealand general election was held on 27 November 1999 to determine the composition of the 46th New Zealand Parliament. The governing National Party, led by Prime Minister Jenny Shipley, was defeated, being replaced by a coalition of Helen Clark&#x27;s Labour Party and the smaller Alliance. This marked an end to nine years of the Fourth National Government, and the beginning of the Fifth Labour Government which would govern for nine years in turn, until its loss to the National Party in the 2008 general election. It was the first New Zealand election where both major parties had female leaders.

==Background==
Before the election, the National Party had an unstable hold on power. After the 1996 election National had formed a coalition with the populist New Zealand First party and its controversial leader, Winston Peters. The coalition was unpopular, as New Zealand First was seen as opposed to the National government, and had made many statements in the 1996 election campaign to that effect, such as saying that only through New Zealand First could National Party be toppled, and Peters said that he would not accept Jim Bolger as prime minister, Bill Birch as Finance Minister or Jenny Shipley in a social welfare portfolio. NZ First&#x27;s support crashed, though this was also partly caused by scandals and by mid-1997, NZ First was polling at as low as 2%. National also polled badly, and Jim Bolger was replaced as prime minister with Jenny Shipley.

Gradually, however, the relationship between the two parties deteriorated, and Peters took his party out of the coalition, after Shipley sacked him from her cabinet. A number of New Zealand First MPs deserted Peters, establishing themselves as independents or as members of newly established parties. By forming agreements with these MPs, National was able to keep itself in office, but its control was often unsteady. The polls were still initially close, but without NZ First support, National&#x27;s chances of forming a government were slim. Eventually, Labour Party gained a solid lead over National.

The Labour Party, which had been in Opposition since losing the 1990 election, presented a strong challenge, particularly due to its agreement with the smaller Alliance party. The two had not previously enjoyed good relations, primarily due to the presence of the NewLabour Party as one of the Alliance&#x27;s key members. NewLabour had been established by Jim Anderton, a former Labour MP who quit the party in protest over the economic reforms of Roger Douglas, which were often blamed for Labour&#x27;s election loss in 1990. Gradually, as the Labour Party withdrew from Rogernomics, the Alliance (led by Anderton) reduced its hostility towards Labour, but it was not until shortly before the 1999 election that a formal understanding was reached regarding a possible left-wing coalition. This agreement was deemed a necessary step towards building a credible alternative to the National Party.

This election was the first one in New Zealand&#x27;s history where both main parties were led by women, being repeated again in the 2020 election.

===MPs retiring in 1999 ===
Fifteen MPs intended to retire at the end of the 45th Parliament.

==The election==
The election took place on 27 November. Less than 84.1% of the 2,509,365 people registered to vote turned out for the election. This was the lowest turnout for some time, although it would drop further in the 2002 election. A total of 679 candidates stood for electorate seats, representing 36 parties. Party lists comprised 760 candidates from 22 parties. The new government was sworn in on 10 December.

In the election 965 candidates stood, and there were 22 registered parties with party lists. Of the candidates, 482 were electorate and list, 197 were electorate only, and 286 were list only. 67% of candidates (647) were male and 33% (318) female.

==Opinion polling==
==Summary of results==
Labour Party won 49 seats in parliament. When combined with the ten seats won by the Alliance, the coalition was two seats short of an absolute majority. It was able to form a new government with support from the Green Party, which entered parliament for the first time as an independent party (having previously been a part of the Alliance). The Green Party&#x27;s entry to parliament was by a narrow margin, however – in order to gain seats, it needed to either win 5% of the party vote or win an electorate seat, neither of which the party appeared likely to do. Helen Clark openly encouraged Labour supporters in the Coromandel to give their constituency vote to Green Party co-leader Jeanette Fitzsimons and their party vote to Labour. However, when all special votes (that is, votes cast by people who were not able to attend a polling place in their electorate on the day of the election) were counted, the Greens had narrowly reached not one but both targets – Jeanette Fitzsimons won the electorate of Coromandel by 250 votes, and the party gained 5.16% of the vote.

The National Party, while not performing exceptionally poorly, failed to gain enough support to keep it in power. It won 39 seats, ten fewer than the Labour Party. ACT New Zealand, a potential coalition partner for National, gained nine seats. While this was an increase on ACT&#x27;s previous election results, it was not sufficient to enable the National Party to form a government. National&#x27;s former coalition partner, New Zealand First, performed poorly, with voters punishing it for the problems in the last government. The party received less than 5% of the vote, and so would have been removed from parliament had Winston Peters not retained his electorate of Tauranga, something he did by only 63 votes. None of the MPs who deserted New Zealand First were returned to parliament.

In addition to the registered parties listed above, some groups participated in the election without submitting party lists. Many of these were unregistered parties, lacking the necessary membership numbers for submitting a party list. There were, however, three registered ones that did not, for whatever reason, submit a party list. In total, 14 parties nominated electorate candidates only. By number of votes received, the most significant parties to do this were Te Tawharau (registered), Mana Wahine Te Ira Tangata (registered), the Equal Rights Party (unregistered), the Piri Wiri Tua Movement (unregistered), and the Asia Pacific United Party (registered). None of these parties were successful. There were also 36 independent candidates, also unsuccessful. The Mauri Pacific Party, established by a group of defectors from New Zealand First, failed to place even second in the electorates they held. Te Tawharau, which held a seat in parliament thanks to another New Zealand First defector, failed to retain its seat.

===Votes summary===


===Electorate results===
Of the 67 electorates in the 1999 election, a majority (41) were won by the opposition Labour Party. Included in Labour&#x27;s total are the Maori seats, which it managed to regain after losing them to New Zealand First in the previous election. The governing National Party won 22 electorate seats, slightly less than a third of the total.

Four minor parties managed to win electorate seats. This proved important for some – neither New Zealand First nor United would have entered parliament if not for Winston Peters and Peter Dunne retaining their seats. Jim Anderton also retained his seat. The Greens won their first electorate seat when Jeanette Fitzsimons took Coromandel, although since the Greens crossed the 5% threshold, this was of less importance than originally thought. The Greens were not to repeat an electorate win until the 2020 election, with Chloë Swarbrick&#x27;s plurality in Auckland Central.

===Summary of seat changes===
* Electoral redistributions:
** A minor reconfiguration of electorates and their boundaries occurred between the 1996 and 1999 elections. Six seats were abolished and eight were created, giving a net gain of two electorates.
** The seats of &quot;Mahia&quot;, &quot;New Lynn&quot;, &quot;Owairaka&quot;, &quot;Waipareira&quot;, &quot;Te Tai Rawhiti (Maori)&quot; and &quot;Te Puku O Te Whenua (Maori)&quot; ceased to exist.
** The seats of &quot;East Coast&quot;, &quot;Mt Albert&quot;, &quot;Mt Roskill&quot;, &quot;Te Atatu&quot;, &quot;Titirangi&quot;, &quot;Hauraki (Maori)&quot;, &quot;Ikaroa-Rawhiti (Maori)&quot; and &quot;Waiariki (Maori)&quot; came into being.
* Seats captured:
** By Labour: &quot;Banks Peninsula&quot;, &quot;Hamilton West&quot;, &quot;Maungakiekie&quot;, &quot;Northcote&quot;, &quot;Rotorua&quot; and &quot;Wairarapa&quot; were captured from National. &quot;Te Tai Hauauru&quot; and &quot;Te Tai Tokerau&quot; were captured from Mauri Pacific. &quot;Wellington Central&quot; was captured from ACT. &quot;Te Tai Tonga&quot; was captured from New Zealand First.
** By the Greens: &quot;Coromandel&quot; was captured from National.
* Seats transferred from departing MPs to new MPs:

==Post-election events==
The result in the Tauranga electorate was an extremely close three way race. New Zealand First leader Winston Peters beat National candidate Katherine O&#x27;Regan in a close race with Labour&#x27;s Margaret Wilson in third. Labour sought a judicial recount; since New Zealand First won less than five percent of the party vote they would have been ejected from Parliament if Peters lost his electorate (allowing Labour to govern solely with the Alliance and not needing the Greens). Peters criticised the recount as a waste of money. The recount resulted in Peters&#x27; majority increasing by one vote from 62 to 63.

A by-election to the Wellington City Council was caused after Eastern Ward councillor Sue Kedgley resigned her seat after she was elected a List MP for the Green Party, necessitating a by-election to fill the council vacancy. The by-election was won by Ray Ahipene-Mercer.

<doc id="376563" wikidata="Q4757761" url="?curid=376563" title="Andrew Li">
<text>Andrew Li Kwok-nang (; born December 1948) is a retired Hong Kong judge, and a former Chief Justice of Hong Kong, who was the first to preside over the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal, established on 1 July 1997. Li was succeeded by Geoffrey Ma on 1 September 2010.

Li was born in Hong Kong and educated locally and in England. A graduate of the University of Cambridge, Li practised as a barrister in Hong Kong until his appointment as Chief Justice. During his 13 years as Chief Justice, Li handled a variety of important appellate cases and was known for his moderate jurisprudence and visionary leadership. He has remained active in public service since his retirement.

==Early life and education==
Born in Hong Kong, Andrew Li received his early education at St. Paul&#x27;s Co-educational College, and then at Repton School in Derbyshire, England. He earned an MA and LLM from Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge.

==Legal career==
Li was called to the Middle Temple in 1970, and the Hong Kong Bar in 1973. He served pupillage under Peter Millett, later Lord Millett.

His first ever pupil was Audrey Eu, who commenced her pupillage in 1978. Her brother and senior counsel was also Li&#x27;s pupil. Former Secretary for Justice Wong Yan Lung was Li&#x27;s last pupil. In 1988, he was appointed Queen&#x27;s Counsel.

He was appointed a Deputy Judge of the District Court of Hong Kong in 1982 and a Deputy High Court Judge in 1991. In 1997, Li was appointed the Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal by Tung Chee-Hwa, the first Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region after the handover. As Chief Justice, he presided in the Court of Final Appeal and was Head of the Judiciary charged with its administration. He served for 13 years until his retirement in 2010.

Li has been lauded for visionary leadership as Chief Justice. He has left &quot;an indelible mark in the annals of the history of the HKSAR.&quot; He was &quot;the main impetus&quot; in the development of the Court of Final Appeal, where he developed a moderate jurisprudence and was a consensus builder. Lord Millett, who served alongside Li as a non-permanent judge of the CFA, described Li as &quot;[certainly] the wisest&quot; member of the court.

In 1999, he gave the leading judgment in &quot;Ng Ka Ling and Others v. Director of Immigration&quot;, which was at the centre of the right of abode controversy.

In 2000, Li set up a working party, consisting of judges, lawyers and academics, to introduce reforms on minimising the complexity of High Court civil litigation procedures, widening judges&#x27; discretionary powers to manage the progress of cases and requiring lawyers to justify their charges. An interim report was released in 2001, containing 80 recommendations, some of which mirror those in the Woolf Reforms in England. Known as the Civil Justice Reform, the final report was released on 3 March 2004, setting out 150 recommendations. It has come into effect on 2 April 2009.

Li announced his decision to resign early from his position as Chief Justice on 25 August 2009, ceasing service on 31 August 2010 and commencing pre-retirement leave on 1 September 2010, three years before retirement age. He would leave public life upon retirement. Li&#x27;s announcement that he intended to take early retirement came as a surprise, prompting widespread speculation that there had been pressure from Beijing, according to the &quot;South China Morning Post&quot;. Li, however, stressed his retirement was in the best interests of the judiciary and would be conducive to orderly succession planning of the judiciary as three other permanent judges on the Court of Final Appeal were to reach retirement age between 2012 and 2014. He also said the judiciary had been under his leadership for 13 years, which was a long time, and that retirement was consistent with his personal wishes. He dismissed speculation that he resigned due to political pressure.

On 18 February 2010, Li achieved the highest score ever recorded (68.1) by the University of Hong Kong Public Opinion Programme.

On 8 April 2010, it was announced that Chief Executive Donald Tsang had accepted the recommendation of the Judicial Officers Recommendation Commission to appoint Geoffrey Ma as Li&#x27;s successor. On 9 June 2010, Ma was formally endorsed unanimously by Hong Kong legislators. But pro-democracy members remained concerned at the implications of Li&#x27;s resignation. Margaret Ng said: &quot;The public is deeply worried that [Li&#x27;s resignation] signals an era in which judicial independence will gradually yield to the influence and intervention of Beijing ... but I believe the challenges have always been there, openly at times, but unceasingly as an undercurrent.&quot; Emily Lau said many people were unnerved by Li&#x27;s decision to resign, and that &quot;Hong Kong cannot afford another surprise resignation.&quot;

On 17 July 2010, a farewell ceremony was held for Li. The courtroom was packed by judges and lawyers, including representatives of the Law Society of Hong Kong and the Bar Association.

==Extra-judicial life==
Li has a long record of public service. He was appointed Justice of the Peace in 1985. In 1992, he was appointed member at-large of the Executive Council of Chris Patten (later Lord Patten of Barnes), the last British Governor of Hong Kong, and was appointed Commander of the Order of British Empire the same year.

Li had served as Chairman of the Land Development Corporation, Deputy Chairman of the Inland Revenue Board of Review, member of the Securities Commission, the Law Reform Commission, the Standing Committee on Company Law Reform, the Banking Advisory Committee, and the Judicial Services Commission, and Honorary Secretary of the Hong Kong Bar Association. He had also served as steward of the Hong Kong Jockey Club.

On the education front, Li had served as vice-chairman of the Council of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and chairman of the university and Polytechnics Grants Committee. He had also served as a trustee of the Friends of Tsinghua University Law School Charitable Trust and as the vice-chairman of the School Council of St. Paul&#x27;s Co-educational College of Hong Kong.

Li has received numerous awards, including Honorary Degrees awarded by Hong Kong University of Science &amp; Technology (1993); Baptist University (1994); Open University of Hong Kong (1997); University of Hong Kong (2001); Griffith University (2001), University of New South Wales (2002), University of Technology, Sydney (2005), Chinese University of Hong Kong (2006), Shue Yan University (2009), Lingnan University (2010), City University of Hong Kong (2010), Tsinghua University (2013) and University of Oxford (2013). He was made an Honorary Bencher of the Middle Temple in 1997, an Honorary Fellow of Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge in 1999, and an Honorary Fellow of St Hugh&#x27;s College, Oxford in 2016.

Li was awarded the Grand Bauhinia Medal by the Hong Kong Government in 2008. He received the Woodrow Wilson Award for Public Service and the Sing Tao Leader of the Year Award in 2010. In the following year, he was made an Honorary Life Member respectively of the Hong Kong Bar Association and of the Law Society of Hong Kong. He is also a Patron of the Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law.

Since his retirement from the post of Chief Justice, Li has devoted himself to education. He is Honorary Professor of Law at the University of Hong Kong, Chinese University of Hong Kong and the City University of Hong Kong, as well as a visiting professor of Tsinghua University.

In an interview published in early June 2020, Li said about the Hong Kong national security law, whose enactment would follow at the end of the month, that it was understandable for the National People&#x27;s Congress to enact this legislation, but that &quot;investigatory powers must be governed by Hong Kong law&quot;, and that a requirement on national security judges to not have dual or foreign citizenship would be detrimental to judicial independence.

Li is married with two daughters. His wife, Li Woo Mo Ying Judy, is a graduate of the University of Hong Kong (Social Sciences, 1970).

<doc id="376564" wikidata="Q433397" url="?curid=376564" title="Fanny Kemble">
<text>Frances Anne Kemble (later Butler; 27 November 180915 January 1893) was a British actress from a theatre family in the early and mid-nineteenth century. She was a well-known and popular writer and abolitionist whose published works included plays, poetry, eleven volumes of memoirs, travel writing, and works about the theatre. She lived for many years in the United States, primarily in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Lenox, Massachusetts.

Kemble&#x27;s &quot;lasting historical importance...derives from the private journal she kept during her time in the Sea Islands&quot; on her husband&#x27;s plantations, where she wrote a journal documenting the conditions of the slaves on the plantation and her growing abolitionist feelings. She was also an early adopter of spoken word performances combined with music.

==Early life and education==
A member of the famous Kemble theatrical family, Fanny was the eldest daughter of the actor Charles Kemble and his Viennese-born wife, the former Marie Therese De Camp. She was a niece of the noted tragedienne Sarah Siddons and of the famous actor John Philip Kemble. Her younger sister was the opera singer Adelaide Kemble. Fanny was born in London and educated chiefly in France. In 1821, Fanny Kemble departed to boarding school in Paris to study art and music as befitted the child of the most celebrated artistic family in England at that time. In addition to literature and society, at Mrs. Lamb&#x27;s Academy in the Rue d&#x27;Angoulême, Champs Elysées, Fanny received her first real personal exposure to the stage performing staged readings for students&#x27; parents during her time at school. As an adolescent, Kemble spent time studying literature and poetry, in particular the work of Lord Byron.

One of her teachers was Frances Arabella Rowden (1774 – c. 1840), who had been associated with the Reading Abbey Girls&#x27; School since she was 16. Rowden was an engaging teacher with a particular enthusiasm for the theatre. She was not only a poet but according to Mary Russell Mitford, &quot;she had a knack of making poetesses of her pupils&quot;

In 1827, Kemble wrote her first five-act play, &quot;Francis the First&quot;. It was met with critical acclaim from multiple quarters. Nineteenth-century critics wrote that the script &quot;displays so much spirit and originality, so much of the true qualities which are required in dramatic composition, that it may fairly stand upon its own intrinsic worth, and that the author may fearlessly challenge a comparison with any other modern dramatist.&quot;

==Acting career==

On 26 October 1829, at the age of 19, Kemble first appeared on the stage as Juliet in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; at Covent Garden Theatre, after only three weeks of rehearsals. Her attractive personality immediately made her a great favourite, and her popularity enabled her father to recoup his losses as a manager. She played all the principal women&#x27;s roles of the time, notably Shakespeare&#x27;s Portia and Beatrice (&quot;Much Ado about Nothing&quot;), and Lady Teazle in Richard Brinsley Sheridan&#x27;s &quot;The School for Scandal&quot;. Kemble disliked the artificiality of stardom in general but appreciated the salary which she accepted to help her family in their frequent financial troubles.

In 1832, Kemble accompanied her father on a theatrical tour of the United States. While in Boston in 1833, she journeyed to Quincy to witness the revolutionary technology of the first commercial railroad in the United States. She had previously accompanied George Stephenson on a test of the Liverpool and Manchester before its opening in England and described this in a letter written in early 1830. The Granite Railway was among many sights she recorded in her journal.

Kemble retired from her acting career upon her marriage in 1834, but after her separation, she returned to acting as a solo platform performer, beginning her first American tour in 1849. During her readings, she rose to focus on presenting edited works of Shakespeare, though, unlike others, she insisted on representing his entire canon, ultimately building her repertoire to 25 of his plays. She performed in Britain and the United States, concluding her career as a platform performer in 1868.

==Marriage==

On 7 June 1834, Kemble retired from the stage to marry a wealthy Philadelphian, Pierce Mease Butler, grandson of U.S. Senator Pierce Butler, whom she had met on an American acting tour with her father in 1832. Although they met and lived in Philadelphia, Pierce&#x27;s mother was a daughter of Pierce Butler, a Founding Father who represented South Carolina at the Constitutional Convention. By agreeing to change his last name from Mease to Butler - as his grandfather&#x27;s will had demanded, Butler became heir to the cotton, tobacco, and rice plantations of his grandfather on Butler Island, just south of Darien, Georgia, and to the hundreds of slaves who worked them. By the time the couple&#x27;s daughters, Sarah and Frances, were born, Butler had inherited three of his grandfather&#x27;s plantations on Butler Island, just south of Darien, Georgia, and the hundreds of people who were enslaved on them.

He made trips to the plantations during the early years of their marriage but never took Kemble or their children with him. At Kemble&#x27;s insistence, they finally spent the winter of 1838–1839 at the plantations at Butler and St. Simons islands, in conditions primitive compared to their house in Philadelphia, and Kemble kept a diary of her observations, later published as &quot;Journal of a Residence on a Georgian Plantation in 1838–1839,&quot; flavored strongly by abolitionist sentiment. Kemble was shocked by the living and working conditions of the slaves and their treatment by the overseers and managers. She tried to improve matters, complaining to her husband about slavery and about the mixed-race slave children attributed to the overseer, Roswell King Jr. Butler disapproved of Kemble&#x27;s outspokenness, forbidding her to publish.

Marital tensions had emerged when the family returned to Philadelphia in the spring of 1839. Apart from their disagreements over slave treatment on Butler&#x27;s plantations, Kemble was &quot;embittered and embarrassed&quot; by Butler&#x27;s marital infidelities. Butler threatened to deny Kemble access to their daughters if she published any of her observations about the plantations.

By 1845–1847, the marriage had failed irretrievably, and Kemble returned to England.

===Separation and divorce===

Butler filed for a divorce in 1847, after they had been separated for some time, citing abandonment and misdeed by Kemble. The couple endured a bitter and protracted divorce in 1849, with Butler retaining custody of their two daughters. Other than brief visits, Kemble was not reunited with her daughters until each came of age at 21.

Her ex-husband squandered a fortune estimated at $700,000 but was saved from bankruptcy by a sale on 2–3 March 1859 of 436 people he held in slavery. The Great Slave Auction, at Ten Broeck racetrack outside Savannah, Georgia, was the largest single slave auction in United States history. As such, it was covered by national reporters.

After the American Civil War, Butler tried to run his plantations with free labour but failed to make a profit. He died of malaria in Georgia in 1867. Neither Butler nor Kemble remarried.

==Later stage career==

In England, she began to act on the stage again - at first in plays and then as a &quot;reader&quot; of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays in lecture rooms and concert halls. She returned to the theatre and toured major US cities, giving successful readings of Shakespeare plays. Following her father&#x27;s example, she succeeded as a Shakespearean reader rather than acting in plays. She toured the United States.

Kemble&#x27;s success as a Shakespearean reader enabled her to buy a home in Lenox, Massachusetts.

In 1877, she returned to London to join her younger daughter Frances, who had moved there with her British husband and child. Using her maiden name, Kemble lived there until her death. During this period, she was a prominent and popular figure in London society and became a great friend of the American writer Henry James during her later years. His novel, &quot;Washington Square&quot; (1880), was based on a story Kemble told him about one of her relatives.

==Literary career==
Kemble wrote two plays, &quot;Francis the First&quot; (1832) and &quot;The Star of Seville&quot; (1837). She also published a volume of poems (1844). She published the first volume of her memoirs, &quot;Journal&quot;, in 1835, shortly after her marriage.

She waited until 1863, during the American Civil War, to publish her anti-slavery &quot;Journal of a Residence on a Georgian Plantation in 1838–1839&quot;. It became her best-known work in the United States: she published several other volumes of journals. It included her observations of slavery and life on her husband&#x27;s Southern plantation in the winter of 1838–1839. It contains the earliest-known written use of the word &quot;vegetarian&quot;: &quot;The sight and smell of raw meat are especially odious to me, and I have often thought that if I had had to be my own cook, I should inevitably become a vegetarian, probably, indeed, return entirely to my green and salad days.&quot;

During her time in Philadelphia, Kemble acquired a pair of leather gloves which Shakespeare had reportedly owned and which the British actor David Garrick (1717-1779) had obtained from the descendants of Shakespeare. Kemble gave these, in turn, to the Shakespearean scholar and abolitionist Horace Howard Furness (1833-1912) who donated them to the University of Pennsylvania library which holds an important Shakespeareana collection. After separating from Butler in the 1840s, Kemble travelled in Italy and wrote a two-volume book on this time, &quot;A Year of Consolation&quot; (1847).

In 1863, Kemble also published a volume of plays, including translations from Alexandre Dumas, père and Friedrich Schiller. Other memoirs followed these: &quot;Records of a Girlhood&quot; (1878); &quot;Records of Later Life&quot; (1882); &quot;Far Away and Long Ago&quot; (1889); and &quot;Further Records&quot; (1891). Her various reminiscences contain much valuable material about the social and theatrical history of the period. She also published &quot;Notes on Some of Shakespeare&#x27;s Plays&quot; (1882), based on her long experience in acting and reading his works.

In 2000, Harvard University Press published an edited compilation from her journals. These included &quot;Record of a Girlhood&quot; (1878) and &quot;Records of Later Life (1882).

==Descendants==
Kemble&#x27;s older daughter, Sarah Butler, married Owen Jones Wister, an American doctor. Their one child, Owen Wister, grew up to become a popular American novelist, writing in 1902 a popular western, &quot;The Virginian&quot;.

Fanny&#x27;s other daughter Frances met James Leigh in Georgia. He was a minister born in England. The couple married in 1871, and their one child, Alice Leigh, was born in 1874. An attempt was made to run Frances&#x27;s father&#x27;s plantations there with free labour, but no profit could be made. Leaving Georgia in 1877, they moved permanently to England. Frances Butler Leigh defended her father in the continuing post-war dispute over slavery as an institution. Based on her experience, Leigh published &quot;Ten Years on a Georgian Plantation since the War&quot; (1883), a rebuttal to her mother&#x27;s account.

==Death==
Her granddaughter Alice Leigh was present when Fanny Kemble died in London in 1893.

== Legacy ==
One of the most recognised depictions of Queen Victoria in her coronation year is a portrait by Thomas Sully, a renowned American artist, who modelled this painting on portraits he had made of Kemble. Both in England and the USA, this portrait quickly became the most widely circulated image of the Queen. It was Sully&#x27;s daughter, Blanch Sully, who first suggested to him that Kemble resembled the Queen. The popular perception of Queen Victoria in her early years as monarch is significantly influenced by her portrayal in art, particularly through depictions that were stylistically influenced by paintings of Kemble.

Professor of English, Dr. Laura Engel, has documented how Fanny Kemble, along with Sarah Siddons, Mary Robinson, and Mary Wells have an enduring legacy by helping create &quot;the emergence of modern celebrity,&quot; casting &quot;fame [as] the celebration of the individual.&quot;

==Controversy==
According to Encyclopedia.com, Kemble&#x27;s &quot;lasting historical importance...derives from the private journal she kept during her time in the Sea Islands&quot;, documenting the conditions of the slaves on the plantation and her growing abolitionist feelings.

While Kemble&#x27;s account of the plantations has been criticised, it is seen as notable for voicing the slaves, especially enslaved black women, and has been drawn on by many historians. As noted earlier, her daughter published a rebuttal account. Margaret Davis Cate published a strong critique in the &quot;Georgia Historical Quarterly&quot; in 1960. In the early 21st century, historians Catherine Clinton and Deirdre David studied Kemble&#x27;s &quot;Journal&quot; and raised questions about her portrayal of Roswell King, father, and son, who successively managed Pierce Butler&#x27;s plantations, and about Kemble&#x27;s racial sentiments. On Kemble&#x27;s racial views, David notes she described slaves as stupid, lazy, filthy, and ugly. Such views were then common and compatible with opposing slavery and outrage at its cruelties.

Clinton noted that in 1930, Julia King, granddaughter of Roswell King Jr., stated that Kemble had falsified her account of him after he spurned her affections. There is little evidence in Kemble&#x27;s &quot;Journal&quot; that she encountered Roswell King Jr. on more than a few occasions, and none that she knew his wife, the former Julia Rebecca Maxwell. But she criticized Maxwell as &quot;a female fiend&quot; because a slave named Sophy told her that Mrs. King had ordered the flogging of Judy and Scylla, &quot;of whose children Mr. K[ing] was the father.&quot; Roswell King Jr. was no longer employed by her husband when Pierce Butler and Kemble began their short residency in Georgia. King had resigned due to &quot;growing uneasiness... born of a dispute between the Kings and the Butlers over fees the elder King thought were owed him as co-administrator of Major Butler&#x27;s estate.&quot;

Before arriving in Georgia, Kemble had written, &quot;It is notorious that almost every Southern planter has a family more or less numerous of illegitimate coloured children.&quot; Her statements about Roswell King Sr. and Roswell King Jr. and their alleged status as white fathers of enslaved mulatto children are based on what other slaves told her. Individuals sometimes relied on hearsay accounts of their paternity, although European ancestry was visible. The mulatto Renty, for example, was &quot;ashamed&quot; to ask his mother about the identity of his father. He believed he was the son of Roswell King Jr. because &quot;Mr. C[ouper]&#x27;s children told me so, and I &#x27;spect they know it.&quot; John Couper, the Scottish-born owner of a rival plantation adjacent to Pierce Butler&#x27;s Hampton Point on St. Simon&#x27;s Island, had marked disagreements with the Roswell Kings. Clinton suggests that Kemble favored Couper&#x27;s accounts.

==Biographies==
Numerous books have appeared on Fanny Kemble and her family, including Deirdre David&#x27;s &quot;A Performed Life&quot; (2007) and Vanessa Dickerson&#x27;s passage on Kemble in &quot;Dark Victorians&quot; (2008). Earlier works were &quot;Fanny Kemble&quot; (1933) by Leota Stultz Driver, &quot;Fanny Kemble: A Passionate Victorian&quot; (1939) by Margaret Armstrong, &quot;Fanny Kemble: Actress, Author, Abolitionist&quot; (1967) by Winifred Wise, and &quot;Fanny Kemble: Leading Lady of the Nineteenth-century Stage : A Biography&quot; (1982) by J.C. Furnas.

Some recent biographies that focus on Kemble&#x27;s role as an abolitionist include Catherine Clinton&#x27;s &quot;Fanny Kemble&#x27;s Civil Wars: The Story of America&#x27;s Most Unlikely Abolitionist&quot; (2000). Others have studied the theatrical careers of Kemble and her family. One of these, Henry Gibbs&#x27; &quot;Affectionately Yours, Fanny: Fanny Kemble and the Theatre&quot;, appeared in eight editions between 1945 and 1947.

<text>The Chiffons were an American girl group originating from the Bronx, a borough of New York City, in 1960.

==History==
===Origins===
The group was originally a trio of schoolmates - lead singer Judy Craig, backed by Patricia Bennett and Barbara Lee - enrolled at James Monroe High School in the Bronx in 1960. In 1962, at the suggestion of songwriter Ronnie Mack, the group added Sylvia Peterson, who had sung with Little Jimmy &amp; the Tops at age 14, sharing lead vocals with Jimmy on &quot;Say You Love Me&quot;, the B-side of the Tops&#x27; 1959 local hit &quot;Puppy Love&quot;.

===Recordings===
The group chose the name The Chiffons while recording and releasing their first single, &quot;He&#x27;s So Fine&quot;, written by Ronnie Mack, produced by The Tokens of &quot;The Lion Sleeps Tonight&quot; fame, and released on the Laurie Records label. &quot;He&#x27;s So Fine&quot; hit No. 1 in the United States, selling over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. (This sales figure would have qualified the record for platinum status under the current [as of 2011] RIAA certification standards, effective since 1975, that lowered the &quot;gold&quot; certification threshold to 500,000 copies and set the &quot;platinum&quot; threshold at 1 million.)

The Chiffons immediately released their first LP &quot;He&#x27;s So Fine&quot; (which charted at No. 97) and began touring the East Coast and Midwest states primarily. Within a few months, the group released their second LP, &quot;One Fine Day&quot;.

The group also released two singles in 1963 as &quot;the Four Pennies&quot; (with Sylvia on lead) on the Laurie Records subsidiary Rust, but they abandoned the Four Pennies name as the success of &quot;He&#x27;s So Fine&quot; became clear. This first hit was followed by other notable tunes such as Gerry Goffin and Carole King&#x27;s &quot;One Fine Day&quot;, &quot;Sweet Talkin&#x27; Guy&quot; and &quot;I Have A Boyfriend&quot;. As the 1960s progressed, Peterson assumed a more prominent role in the group, singing lead on the Chiffons&#x27; &quot;Why Am I So Shy&quot;; &quot;Strange, Strange Feeling&quot;; &quot;The Real Thing&quot;; &quot;Up On The Bridge&quot;; and &quot;My Block&quot; (written by Jimmy Radcliffe, Carl Spencer and Bert Berns).

Shortly after the first round of hits, the Chiffons had business problems but still continued to tour the US throughout 1964 (including Murray the K Shows and as part of a package tour headlined by Gene Pitney). In mid-1965, they signed directly to the Laurie label, and had a hit with &quot;Nobody Knows What&#x27;s Going On In My Mind But Me&quot;. To promote the record, Sylvia and Barbara flew to the West Coast to premiere the disc on a July 1965 &quot;Shindig&quot; episode, with two substitute members as Judy and Pat were on maternity leave.

The next Top 10 hit for the Chiffons was &quot;Sweet-Talking Guy&quot; in mid 1966.The success of the song resulted in the Chiffons releasing their third LP, Sweet Talking Guy which peaked at #149 on the Billboard Top 200 LP chart. The Chiffons did their first overseas tour of England and Germany in June 1967; on one of their London club dates (the Chiffons were one of the opening acts for Jimi Hendrix), members of the Beatles and Stones were in the audience. 

Laurie released several minor US chart hits on the Chiffons (including “Up On The Bridge”, “My Boyfriend’s Back)” until the end of the 60s. One track “Just For Tonight” was a big Canadian hit in 1968.

===Personnel changes===
Tiring of the constant touring and lack of hits, Judy Craig left the group in 1972, and she took a bank job in Manhattan. The remaining trio continued to do live shows with Sylvia now as permanent lead singer. Eventually, Sylvia, Pat, and Barbara took on regular 9-5 jobs, but continued to do live shows on weekends. Sylvia eventually left, and her spot was taken by alternating friends of the group.

In 1970, George Harrison released the song &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot;, whose musical similarities to &quot;He&#x27;s So Fine&quot; prompted the estate of Ronnie Mack to file a copyright infringement claim. The Chiffons went on to record &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; in 1975. A judge later found that Harrison had unintentionally plagiarized the earlier song.

Sylvia returned to the Chiffons during the 1980s. On May 15, 1992, Barbara Lee died from a heart attack, and Craig returned to the group. Peterson retired shortly thereafter and was replaced by Connie Harvey. Harvey has since left to pursue a solo career and Bennett has retired from the group.

As of 2023, Judy Craig occasionally performs with her eldest daughter and a niece. Pat Bennett lives in Georgia. Sylvia Peterson retired from her career in healthcare, and died on July 28, 2023, at the age of 77.

<doc id="376566" wikidata="Q713184" url="?curid=376566" title="Betel nut beauty">
<text>In Taiwan, a betel nut beauty or binlang girl () is a young woman selling betel nuts and cigarettes from a brightly lit glass enclosure while wearing revealing clothing. The term in Chinese comes from Xi Shi, the legendary beauty of imperial China&#x27;s Spring and Autumn period. Though betel nuts are chewed in many regions in Southeast Asia, the betel nut beauty phenomenon is distinctly Taiwanese.

The original betel nut beauties were the &quot;Shuangdong Girls&quot; who, in the 1960s, brought glamour to the opening of the Shuangdong Betel Nut Stand in Guoxing, Nantou. The success of the marketing strategy led competitors to follow suit, and by the end of the century, betel nut stands topped with neon signs became a common feature of Taiwan. The stands appear in urban, suburban and rural settings alike.

As icons of Taiwanese culture, betel nut beauties appear frequently in art and film, notably the 2001 movie &quot;Betelnut Beauty&quot; and the 2007 art film &quot;Help Me, Eros&quot;. In 2016, director Tony Xue released &quot;Betelnut Girls&quot;, with lead actors Peggy Tseng and Paul Hsu.

==Definition and distribution==
In a general sense, a betel nut beauty is any female betel nut saleswoman wearing seductive clothing.

Flamboyant betel nut stands decorated with flashing neon signs are a common sight on many major roads in Taiwan. Their primary target consumers are mostly truckers and other working-class people. Some shop owners started to hire girls dressed in sexy outfits to grab customers&#x27; attention, and rivals followed suit.

Apart from being scantily clothed, some betel nut beauties also offered &quot;drive-through&quot; sex services for their customers. For an extra charge, a betel nut beauty would enter a customer&#x27;s car and perform oral sex on them.

Aside from the fear that these practices would generate crime, the presence of betel nut beauties is said to also distract drivers and cause more car accidents.

==Taiwanese betel nut culture==
Betel nut refers to the seed of &quot;Areca catechu&quot;, or betel palm, which, like &quot;Cocos nucifera&quot; (coconut palm), belongs to family Arecaceae. It is an evergreen tree whose trunk can grow as tall as twenty meters. The word &quot;binlan&quot; originated from Indonesian. Betel nut was initially used as a herbal plant, although in modern times it is mostly taken for its stimulating properties.

Betel nut chewing is a widespread practice in Taiwan, first introduced to the majority Han population by the native Taiwanese indigenous peoples. It is estimated that over a hundred billion New Taiwan dollars are spent annually on this product which has the colloquial name of &quot;Taiwanese chewing gum&quot;. Frequent users are often called the &quot;red-lip clan&quot;, since the residue often stains the lips and gums. According to the government&#x27;s Council of Agriculture, as many as seventy farms have joined this lucrative pursuit by planting betel nut trees, which makes betel nut the most important economic crop in Taiwan since the 1990s. However, the upsurge of betel nut planting causes problems with soil and water conservation on the hillside land. It was also found that the Taiwanese way of consuming betel nut significantly enhances its potential to cause cancer.

==Controversy==
Controversy surrounding betel nut beauties generally centers on two questions:
# the propriety of their revealing dress in public places
# whether their dress marks them as victims of exploitation

Betel nut beauties often come from agricultural and working-class sectors of Taiwanese society. This has led some critics to regard their revealing dress as a sign of exploitation. Other observers, such as Josephine Ho, coordinator of the Center for the Study of Sexuality at National Central University, see betel nut beauties as self-empowering: young women with few resources who better their economic situation by employing a marketing technique that requires confidence.

==Suppression==
In 2002, local governments in Taiwan started to impose laws or regulations covering the dress code of betel nut beauties, prohibiting the wearing of over-revealing clothes. Taipei was the first to initiate the change.

On 17 September 2002, Taoyuan County (now Taoyuan City) implemented a &quot;three nos&quot; policy which prevented betel nut beauties from wearing outfits which exposed their bellies, breasts, and buttocks. The policy sparked backlash from those operating in the industry and resulted in groups protesting in front of the Taoyuan County Hall.

Regulations were also imposed in Taichung, Tainan, and Kaohsiung.

Some betel nut beauties are high school dropouts and their jobs represent the principal source of income for their families. Most have difficulty finding a job in a convenience store because they lack an educational qualification or because of age restrictions; some choose to enter this profession for its higher pay.

<doc id="376571" wikidata="Q687908" url="?curid=376571" title="Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales">
<text>The Lord or Lady Chief Justice of England and Wales is the head of the judiciary of England and Wales and the president of the courts of England and Wales.

Until 2005 the lord chief justice was the second-most senior judge of the English and Welsh courts, surpassed by the lord chancellor, who normally sat in the highest court. The Constitutional Reform Act 2005 changed the roles of judges, creating the position of President of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom and altering the duties of the lord chief justice and the lord chancellor. The lord chief justice ordinarily serves as president of the Criminal Division of the Court of Appeal and head of criminal justice, meaning its technical processes within the legal domain, but under the 2005 Act can appoint another judge to these positions. The lord chancellor became a purely executive office, with no judicial role.

The equivalent in Scotland is the Lord President of the Court of Session, who also holds the post of Lord Justice-General in the High Court of Justiciary. The equivalent in Northern Ireland is the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland, local successor to the Lord Chief Justice of Ireland of the pre-Partition era.

Sue Carr, Baroness Carr of Walton-on-the-Hill, has been Lady Chief Justice since October 2023. She is the first female holder of the office.

==History==
Originally, each of the three high common law courts, the King&#x27;s Bench, the Court of Common Pleas, and the Court of the Exchequer, had its own chief justice: the Lord Chief Justice, the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, and the Chief Baron of the Exchequer. The Court of the King&#x27;s (or Queen&#x27;s) Bench had existed since 1234. In 1268 the first chief justice of the King&#x27;s Bench was appointed. From the time of Edward Coke in the early 17th century, the chief justice became known informally as &quot;lord chief justice&quot;. It was only in 1875 that it became the statutory title.

The three courts became divisions of the High Court in 1875 (though the head of each court continued in post). Following the deaths of Lord Chief Justice Sir Alexander Cockburn and Chief Baron Sir Fitzroy Kelly in 1880, the three divisions were merged into a single division, with Lord Coleridge, the last Chief Justice of Common Pleas, as &quot;Lord Chief Justice of England&quot;.

The suffix &quot;and Wales&quot;, now found in statutes and elsewhere, was of a holder&#x27;s own motion and to reflect centuries-old reality, appended during the tenure of Lord Bingham of Cornhill. He held this office between 1996 and 2000.

===Constitutional Reform Act 2005===
The Constitutional Reform Act 2005 (CRA) made the Lord Chief Justice the president of the Courts of England and Wales, vesting the office with many of the powers formerly held by the Lord Chancellor. While the Lord Chief Justice retains the role of President of the Criminal Division of the Court of Appeal, the CRA separated the role of President of the King&#x27;s Bench Division; the changed chief justice role was first held by Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers. The CRA provides that the chief justice is chosen by a specially appointed committee convened by the Judicial Appointments Commission.

=== Modification of title from Lord to Lady ===
Upon the announcement of the appointment on 15 June 2023 of Dame Sue Carr, it was highly anticipated that the title would be modified from Lord to Lady, in line with Dame Siobhan Keegan&#x27;s title change of Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland to Lady Chief Justice. This speculation was further confirmed in news closer to Carr&#x27;s appointment, on 27 September 2023 that Carr had chosen the title of Lady Chief Justice. When Carr took office she was sworn as Lady Chief Justice, for the first time in the role&#x27;s history since its inception.

==Roles and responsibilities==
The lord chief justice has 400 individual statutory responsibilities specified in the Constitutional Reform Act 2005. While they sit as a judge on important criminal, civil and family cases, including appeal cases, they also have a wide range of administrative responsibilities. As president of the Courts of England and Wales, they are responsible for representing the opinions of the judiciary to government, overseeing their welfare and training and allocating work amongst them. With the Lord Chancellor, they are responsible for the handling of complaints against judges through the Judicial Conduct Investigations Office. They are also president of the Sentencing Council, and Magistrates&#x27; Association and chairs the Judicial Executive Board, and Judges&#x27; Council.

<text>John Philip Kemble (1 February 1757 – 26 February 1823) was a British actor. He was born into a theatrical family as the eldest son of Roger Kemble, actor-manager of a touring troupe. His elder sister Sarah Siddons achieved fame with him on the stage of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. His other siblings, Charles Kemble, Stephen Kemble, Ann Hatton, and Elizabeth Whitlock, also enjoyed success on the stage.

==Early life==
The second child of Roger Kemble – the manager of the travelling theatre company the Warwickshire Company of Comedians – he was born at Prescot, Lancashire. His mother being a Roman Catholic, he was educated at Sedgley Park Catholic seminary (now Park Hall Hotel), near Wolverhampton, and the English college at Douai, France, with the intent to become a priest. At the end of the four years&#x27; course, he still felt no vocation for the priesthood, and returning to England he joined the theatrical company of Crump &amp; Chamberlain, his first appearance being as Theodosius in Nathaniel Lee&#x27;s tragedy of that name at Wolverhampton on 8 January 1776.

In 1778, Kemble joined the York company of Tate Wilkinson, appearing at Wakefield as Captain Plume in George Farquhar&#x27;s &quot;The Recruiting Officer&quot;; in Hull for the first time as Macbeth on 30 October, and in York as Orestes in Ambrose Philips&#x27;s &quot;Distresset Mother&quot;. In 1781 he obtained a &quot;star&quot; engagement at Dublin making his first appearance there on 2 November as Hamlet. He also achieved great success as Raymond in &quot;The Count of Narbonne&quot;, a play taken from Horace Walpole&#x27;s &quot;The Castle of Otranto&quot;.

==Drury Lane==
Gradually he won for himself a high reputation as a careful and finished actor, and this, combined with the greater fame of his sister, Sarah, led to an engagement at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, where he made his first appearance on 30 September 1783 as Hamlet. In this role he awakened interest and discussion among the critics such as Harriet Evans Martin rather than the enthusiastic approval of the public. As Macbeth on 31 March 1785 he shared in the enthusiasm aroused by Sarah Siddons, and established a reputation among living actors second only to hers. Brother and sister had first appeared together at Drury Lane on 22 November 1783, as Beverley and Mrs Beverley in Edward Moore&#x27;s &quot;The Gamester&quot;, and as King John and Constance in Shakespeare&#x27;s tragedy.

In the following year they played Montgomerie and Matilda in Richard Cumberland&#x27;s &quot;The Carmelite&quot;, and in 1785 Adorni and Camiola in Kemble&#x27;s adaptation of Philip Massinger&#x27;s &quot;A Maid of Honor&quot;, and Othello and Desdemona. Between 1785 and 1787 Kemble appeared in a variety of roles, his Mentevole in Robert Jephson&#x27;s &quot;Julia&quot; producing an overwhelming impression.

In December 1787 he married Priscilla Hopkins Brereton, the widow of an actor and herself an actress. Kemble&#x27;s appointment as manager of the Drury Lane theatre in 1788 gave him full opportunity to dress the characters less according to tradition than in harmony with his own conception of what was suitable. He was also able to experiment with whatever parts might strike his fancy, and of this privilege he took advantage with greater courage than discretion.

He played a huge number of parts, including a large number of Shakespearean characters and also a great many in plays now forgotten, in his own version of &quot;Coriolanus&quot;, which was revived during his first season, the character of the &quot;noble Roman&quot; was so exactly suited to his powers that he not only played it with a perfection that has never been approached, but, it is said, unconsciously allowed its influence to colour his private manner and modes of speech. His tall and imposing person, noble countenance, and solemn and grave demeanour were uniquely adapted for the Roman characters in Shakespeare&#x27;s plays; and, when in addition had to depict the gradual growth and development of one absorbing passion, his representation gathered a momentum and majestic force that were irresistible.

In 1785 the well-known actor, John Henderson, asked his friend, the critic Richard &quot;Conversation&quot; Sharp, to go and see the newcomer, Kemble, and to report back to him. Sharp later wrote to Henderson with the following insightful description of what he had found,

In 1795, Kemble was engaged to perform in the stage play &quot;Vortigern and Rowena&quot;, said to have been a newly discovered work of William Shakespeare, but which in fact turned out to be a forgery by a teen named William Henry Ireland, who had enlisted Richard Brinsley Sheridan to produce it. Kemble later claimed that upon reading it, he really doubted the play was genuine, arguing for it to premiere on April Fool&#x27;s Day, but Ireland&#x27;s father Samuel was opposed to this, so the performance was scheduled for the day after. There were even debates in the media of the time about this play being authentic. In its performance on 2 April, the first three acts went without incident, the spectators paying heed. Late in the play, Kemble used an opportunity to offer his own appraisal when he &quot;repeated&quot; Vortigern&#x27;s saying &quot;and when this solemn mockery is o&#x27;er.&quot;, causing some in the audience to react with catcalls.

His defect was in flexibility, variety, rapidity; the characteristic of his style was method, regularity, precision, elaboration even of the minutest details, founded on a thorough psychological study of the special personality he had to represent. His elocutionary art, his fine sense of rhythm and emphasis, enabled him to excel in declamation, but physically he was incapable of giving expression to impetuous vehemence and searching pathos. In &quot;Coriolanus&quot; and Cato he was beyond praise, and possibly he may have been superior to both Garrick and Kean in Macbeth, although in it part of his inspiration must have been caught from Sarah Siddons.

In all the other great Shakespearean characters he was, according to the best critics, inferior to them, least so in Lear (though he never played Shakespeare&#x27;s tragic Lear, preferring the happy ending &quot;History of King Lear&quot; as adapted by Nahum Tate), Hamlet and Wolsey, and most so in Shylock and Richard III. His production of &quot;Cymbeline&quot; was staged regularly from 1801 on. On account of the eccentricities of Sheridan, the proprietor of Drury Lane, Kemble withdrew from the management, and, although he resumed his duties at the beginning of the season 1800–1801, he at the close of 1802 finally resigned connection with it.

==Covent Garden==
In 1803 he became manager of the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, in which he had acquired a sixth share for £23,000. The theatre was burned down on 20 September 1808, and the raising of the prices after the opening of the new theatre, in 1809, led to the Old Price Riots, which practically suspended the performances for three months. England&#x27;s former heavyweight champion Daniel Mendoza and some associates were hired by the Kemble in an attempt to suppress the Riots; the resulting poor publicity probably cost Mendoza much of his popular support, as he was seen to be fighting on the side of the privileged. Kemble had been nearly ruined by the fire, and was only saved by a generous loan, afterwards converted into a gift, of £10,000 from the Duke of Northumberland. Kemble took his final leave of the stage in the part of Coriolanus on 23 June 1817.

==Death and legacy==
His retirement was probably hastened by the rising popularity of Edmund Kean. The remaining years of his life were spent chiefly abroad, and he died at Lausanne on 26 February 1823.

Although Kemble was interred at Lausanne, a life-size marble statue of him stands in the chapel of St Andrew in Westminster Abbey, close to that of his sister, Sarah Siddons. The latter is often attributed to John Flaxman but was executed after Flaxman&#x27;s death by his assistant Thomas Denman.

He is also commemorated in the name of a street in his place of birth, Prescot.

==Tributes==
A bust of Kemble dated 1814 by John Gibson is held in the National Portrait Gallery, London.

A bust of Kemble by Charles Molloy Westmacott was exhibited at the Royal Academy, London in 1822.

Letitia Elizabeth Landon published a poetical tribute to Kemble in Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1834, based on a portrait in costume by Thomas Lawrence.

<text>Mikkeli (; ; ; ) is a city in, and the regional capital of, South Savo, Finland, located in the Finnish Lakeland. The population is approximately , while the Mikkeli sub-region of Southern Savonia has a population of approximately . Mikkeli is the most-populous municipality of Finland and the 19th most-populous urban area in the country.

Mikkeli is located on the shores of Lake Saimaa, the largest lake in the country, and Europe&#x27;s fourth largest. Prior to being located within South Savonia, the city was in Mikkeli Province (until 1997), before becoming part of Eastern Finland Province (1997-2009). The city covers an area of , of which is water. Mikkeli is one of the largest towns in the South Savo region, and one of the main hubs in the region&#x27;s hospital districts, along with Savonlinna.

During World War II, Mikkeli served as the headquarters for the Finnish Defence Forces, thus the town&#x27;s coat of arms features a pair of crossed Marshal Mannerheim batons in honour of the armed forces. The town was awarded the Cross of Liberty, Class, which is displayed alongside the coat of arms.

== History ==
The earliest signs of human life in Mikkeli are the Astuvansalmi rock paintings in Ristiina, dating back to 4100-2000 BCE. The Astuvansalmi is the largest rock painting site in the Nordic countries.

The peace treaty of Nöteborg in 1323, with which the pogost (church parish) of Savilahti was transferred from the control of Novgorod to Sweden, is the oldest written record of the settlement in the present region of Mikkeli. The locality received its present name Mikkeli after Archangel Michael by the early 16th century at the latest.

On January 23, 1597, more than 200 peasant rebels were killed in the parsonage of Kenkävero in part of the larger Cudgel War. In the war waged by King Gustav III of Sweden against Russia, the Battle of Porrassalmi took place a few miles south of Mikkeli on June 13, 1789. In the battle the Swedes (Finns) victoriously defended their positions against superior numbers of Russians.

Mikkeli was granted town rights in 1838. The provincial government of the province of Mikkeli that had been established in 1831, moved from Heinola to Mikkeli in 1843.

In 1918, during the Civil War, the headquarters of the White Army were established in Mikkeli. Mikkeli was located in a conservative farming area and it was a White stronghold, but elements of the Russian Army garrison in the area supported the Reds. A major engagement was fought around the railway station at Mäntyharju, about to the south of Mikkeli, when the Whites blocked a Red thrust coming north out of Kouvola. During the Winter War and Continuation War, the headquarters of the Finnish Army was located in Mikkeli. The Army staff made their base in a local secondary school. At the site of that school is the small containing photographs and memorabilia of the era. As a result of serving as the headquarters of the army that was based there, Mikkeli was bombed heavily, but since there was almost no high-rise development at the time the damage was quickly repaired. Architecturally, most of pre-war Mikkeli doesn&#x27;t exist anymore.

Wartime Mikkeli is identified with Marshal C. G. E. Mannerheim, the supreme commander of the Finnish Defence Forces and later President of Finland. His personal railway carriage, which he used as a command post during the war, is parked in a siding at Mikkeli Station. It is possible to look inside the carriage through its windows at any time, but public entry to the carriage is permitted only once a year, on Mannerheim&#x27;s birthday (June 4). The carriage was the venue of Mannerheim&#x27;s famous 1942 meeting with Hitler near Immola, during which their private conversation was secretly recorded; photographs of this meeting are on display in the carriage. Mannerheim was a regular diner at the Mikkelin Klubi, where his favourite drink was schnapps.

One of the main museums in the town is the , located in one of the former army barracks, close to the University of Applied Sciences. It contains exhibits from the four wars in Finland&#x27;s modern history – the Civil, Winter, Continuation and Lapland Wars. The museum also contains an exhibit dedicated to Finnish war hero Lauri Törni.

In 1986, there was a hostage crisis in Mikkeli when a bank robber drove from Helsinki with three hostages and parked there. When the police shot at the hostage taker&#x27;s car he detonated explosives contained inside, killing himself and one hostage.

In 1997, there was a province reform, which made Mikkeli the capital of the new province of Eastern Finland. In a separate reform, the rural municipality of Mikkeli which had surrounded the town and the municipality of Anttola were consolidated into Mikkeli in early 2001. The municipality of Haukivuori was consolidated with Mikkeli on January 1, 2007, and likewise with Ristiina and Suomenniemi in 2013.

In 2024, there were plans to establish a sub-staff of ground forces working under the military alliance in Mikkeli following Finland&#x27;s admission into NATO.

<text>Robert Jephson (1736 – 31 May 1803) was an Irish dramatist and politician.

==Life==
He was born in Ireland, a younger son of John Jephson, Archdeacon of Cloyne. He entered Trinity College, Dublin in 1751, but left without a degree. He then joined the British Army, with a commission in the 73rd Regiment of Foot (1758), and served in the Caribbean. He left, for health reasons.

Jephson then lived in England, at Hampton Court, with William Gerard Hamilton. There he was the friend of David Garrick, Joshua Reynolds, Oliver Goldsmith, Samuel Johnson, Edmund Burke, Charles Burney and Charles Townshend. His appointment as master of the horse to the lord-lieutenant of Ireland took him back to Dublin.

He published, in the &quot;Mercury&quot; newspaper, a series of articles in defence of the lord-lieutenant&#x27;s administration which were afterwards collected and issued in book form under the title of &quot;The Bachelor, or Speculations of Jeoffry Wagstaffe&quot;. A pension of £300, later doubled, was granted him, and he held his appointment under twelve succeeding viceroys.

Jephson entered the Irish House of Commons in 1773 and sat for St Johnstown (County Longford) until 1776. Between 1777 and 1783, he served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Old Leighlin and subsequently represented Granard from 1783 to 1790. He died at Blackrock, near Dublin.

==Works==
From 1775 Jephson took up writing plays. Among others, his tragedy &quot;Braganza&quot; was successfully performed at Drury Lane in 1775, &quot;The Conspiracy&quot; in 1796, &quot;Julia&quot; in 1797, &quot;The Law of Lombardy&quot; in 1779, and &quot;The Count of Narbonne&quot; at Covent Garden in 1781, adapted from Horace Walpole&#x27;s &quot;The Castle of Otranto&quot; and &quot;The Campaign&quot; at the Smock Alley Theatre in 1784. In 1794 he published an heroic poem &quot;Roman Portraits&quot;, and &quot;The Confessions of Jacques Baptiste Couteau&quot;, a satire on the excesses of the French Revolution.

<doc id="376577" wikidata="Q6635652" url="?curid=376577" title="List of public art in Western Australia">
<text>There are numerous artworks on permanent public display in Western Australia.

This list include only works of public art accessible in an outdoor public space; it does not include artwork on display inside a museum. Most of the works mentioned are sculptures, although several notable memorials are listed also. Public art may include statues, sculptures, monuments, memorials, murals and mosaics.

In 1989 the Western Australian state government established a &quot;Percent for Art&quot; policy. The scheme which enacts the policy is administered by the Department of Culture and the Arts and requires that up to one percent of the construction budget for new public works over $2,000,000, be expended on public artwork. The Town of Vincent was the first Local government authority to have a similar scheme. It requires that &quot;commercial, non-residential, and/or mixed residential/commercial developments over $1,000,000 are to set aside a minimum of one per cent of the estimated total project cost for the development to be used for public artworks.&quot; Over 700 works have been installed under the state government scheme since 1989.

<text>Edward Moore (22 March 17121 March 1757), English dramatist and miscellaneous writer, the son of a dissenting minister, was born at Abingdon, Berkshire.

He was the author of &quot;Fables for the Female Sex&quot; (1744), &quot;The Trial of Selim the Persian&quot; (1748), &quot;The Foundling&quot; (1748) and &quot;Gil Blas&quot; (1751). He wrote the domestic tragedy of &quot;The Gamester&quot;, originally produced in 1753 with David Garrick in the leading character of Beverley the gambler. It is upon &quot;The Gamester&quot; that Moore&#x27;s literary reputation rests; the play was much-produced in England and the United States in the century after Moore&#x27;s death. The oft-quoted phrase &quot;rich beyond the dreams of avarice&quot; is spoken by Mrs. Beverley in the play&#x27;s second act.

As a poet he produced clever imitations of John Gay and Thomas Gray, and with the assistance of Lord Lyttelton, Lord Chesterfield and Horace Walpole, conducted &quot;The World&quot; (1753–1757), a weekly periodical on the model of the &quot;Rambler&quot;. He collected his poems under the title of &quot;Poems, Fables and Plays&quot; in 1756.

Moore died in Lambeth on 1 March 1757. His &quot;Dramatic Works&quot; were published in 1788.

<doc id="376581" wikidata="Q907112" url="?curid=376581" title="Transnistria">
<text>Transnistria, officially known as the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic and locally as Pridnestrovie, is a landlocked breakaway state internationally recognized as part of Moldova. It controls most of the narrow strip of land between the Dniester river and the Moldova–Ukraine border, as well as some land on the other side of the river&#x27;s bank. Its capital and largest city is Tiraspol. Transnistria is officially designated by the Republic of Moldova as the Administrative-Territorial Units of the Left Bank of the Dniester () or as (&quot;Left (Bank) of the Dniester&quot;).

The region&#x27;s origins can be traced to the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, which was formed in 1924 within the Ukrainian SSR. During World War II, the Soviet Union took parts of the Moldavian ASSR, which was dissolved, and of the Kingdom of Romania&#x27;s Bessarabia to form the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic in 1940. The present history of the region dates to 1990, during the dissolution of the Soviet Union, when the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic was established in hopes that it would remain within the Soviet Union should Moldova seek unification with Romania or independence, the latter occurring in August 1991. Shortly afterwards, a military conflict between the two parties started in March 1992 and concluded with a ceasefire in July that year.

As a part of the ceasefire agreement, a three-party (Moldova, Russia, and Transnistria) Joint Control Commission and a trilateral peacekeeping force subordinated to the commission were created to deal with ceasefire violations. Although the ceasefire has held, the territory&#x27;s political status remains unresolved: Transnistria is an unrecognized but &quot;de facto&quot; independent semi-presidential republic with its own government, parliament, military, police, postal system, currency, and vehicle registration. Its authorities have adopted a constitution, flag, national anthem, and coat of arms. After a 2005 agreement between Moldova and Ukraine, all Transnistrian companies seeking to export goods through the Ukrainian border must be registered with the Moldovan authorities. This agreement was implemented after the European Union Border Assistance Mission to Moldova and Ukraine (EUBAM) took force in 2005. In addition to the unrecognized Transnistrian citizenship, most Transnistrians have Moldovan citizenship, but many also have Russian, Romanian, or Ukrainian citizenship. The main ethnic groups are Russians, Moldovans/Romanians, and Ukrainians.

Transnistria, along with Abkhazia and South Ossetia, is a post-Soviet &quot;frozen conflict&quot; zone. These three partially recognised or unrecognised states maintain friendly relations with each other and form the Community for Democracy and Rights of Nations.

In March 2022, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe adopted a resolution that defines the territory as under military occupation by Russia.

==Toponymy==
The region can also be referred to in English as &quot;Dniesteria&quot;, &quot;Trans-Dniester&quot;, &quot;Transdniester&quot; or &quot;Transdniestria&quot;. These names are adaptations of the Romanian colloquial name of the region, &quot;Transnistria&quot;, meaning &quot;beyond the Dniester&quot;. The term &quot;Transnistria&quot; was used in relation to eastern Moldova for the first time in the year 1989, in the election slogan of Leonida Lari, the deputy and member of the Popular Front of Moldova formed during the reforms of the last Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, when she stated.
The documents of the government of Moldova refer to the region as , meaning &quot;Left (Bank) of the Dniester&quot;, or in full, (&quot;Administrative-territorial unit(s) of the Left Bank of the Dniester&quot;). 

According to the Transnistrian authorities, the name of the state is the &quot;Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic&quot; (; , ; ). The short form is &quot;Pridnestrovie&quot; (, ; , , ; , ), meaning &quot;[land] by the Dniester&quot;.

The Supreme Council passed a law on 4 September 2024 which banned the use of the term &quot;Transnistria&quot; within the region, imposing a fine of 360 rubles or up to 15 days imprisonment for using the name in public.

==History==
===Soviet and Romanian administration===
In 1924, the Moldavian ASSR was proclaimed within the Ukrainian SSR. The ASSR included today&#x27;s Transnistria () and an area () to the northeast around the city of Balta, but nothing from Bessarabia, which at the time formed part of the Kingdom of Romania. One of the reasons for the creation of the Moldavian ASSR was the desire of the Soviet Union at the time to eventually incorporate Bessarabia. On 28 June 1940, the USSR annexed Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina from Romania under the terms of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, and on 2 August 1940 the Supreme Soviet of the USSR created the Moldavian SSR by combining part of the annexed territory with part of the former Moldavian ASSR roughly equivalent to present-day Transnistria.

In 1941, after Axis forces invaded the Soviet Union in the Second World War, they defeated the Soviet troops in the region and occupied it. Romania controlled the entire region between Dniester and Southern Bug rivers, including the city of Odesa as local capital. The Romanian-administered territory, known as the Transnistria Governorate, with an area of and a population of 2.3 million inhabitants, was divided into 13 counties: Ananiev, Balta, Berzovca, Dubasari, Golta, Jugastru, Movilau, Oceacov, Odessa, Ovidiopol, Rîbnița, Tiraspol, and Tulcin. This expanded Transnistria was home to nearly 200,000 Romanian-speaking residents. The Romanian administration of Transnistria attempted to stabilise the situation in the area under Romanian control, implementing a process of Romanianization. During the Romanian occupation of 1941–44, between 150,000 and 250,000 Ukrainian and Romanian Jews were deported to Transnistria; the majority were murdered or died from other causes in the ghettos and concentration camps of the Governorate.

After the Red Army advanced into the area in 1944, Soviet authorities executed, exiled or imprisoned hundreds of inhabitants of the Moldavian SSR in the following months on charges of collaboration with the Romanian occupiers. A later campaign directed against rich peasant families deported them to the Kazakh SSR and Siberia. Over the course of two days, 6–7 July 1949, a plan named &quot;Operation South&quot; saw the deportation of over 11,342 families by order of the Moldavian Minister of State Security, Iosif Mordovets.

===Secession===

In the 1980s, Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s policies of perestroika and glasnost in the Soviet Union allowed political liberalisation at a regional level. This led to the creation of various informal movements all over the country, and to a rise of nationalism within most Soviet republics. In the Moldavian SSR in particular, there was a significant resurgence of pro-Romanian nationalism among Moldovans. The most prominent of these movements was the Popular Front of Moldova (PFM). In early 1988, the PFM demanded that the Soviet authorities declare Moldovan the only state language, return to the use of the Latin alphabet, and recognise the shared ethnic identity of Moldovans and Romanians. The more radical factions of the PFM espoused extreme anti-minority, ethnocentric and chauvinist positions, calling for minority populations, particularly the Slavs (mainly Russians and Ukrainians) and Gagauz, to leave or be expelled from Moldova.

On 31 August 1989, the Supreme Soviet of the Moldavian SSR adopted Moldovan as the official language with Russian retained only for secondary purposes, returned Moldovan to the Latin alphabet, and declared a shared Moldovan-Romanian linguistic identity. As plans for major cultural changes in Moldova were made public, tensions rose further. Ethnic minorities felt threatened by the prospects of removing Russian as the official language, which served as the medium of interethnic communication, and by the possible future reunification of Moldova and Romania, as well as the ethnocentric rhetoric of the PFM. The Yedinstvo (Unity) Movement, established by the Slavic population of Moldova, pressed for equal status for both the Russian and Moldovan languages. Transnistria&#x27;s ethnic and linguistic composition differed significantly from most of the rest of Moldova. The proportion of ethnic Russians and Ukrainians was especially high and an overall majority of the population, some of them Moldovans, spoke Russian as their mother tongue.

The nationalist PFM won the first free parliamentary elections in the Moldavian SSR in early 1990, and its agenda started slowly to be implemented. On 2 September 1990, the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic (PMSSR) was proclaimed as a Soviet republic by an &quot;ad hoc&quot; assembly, the Second Congress of the Peoples&#x27; Representatives of Transnistria, following a successful referendum. Violence escalated when in October 1990 the PFM called for volunteers to form armed militias to stop an autonomy referendum in Gagauzia, which had an even higher proportion of ethnic minorities. In response, volunteer militias were formed in Transnistria. In April 1990, nationalist mobs attacked ethnic Russian members of parliament, while the Moldovan police refused to intervene or restore order.

In the interest of preserving a unified Moldavian SSR within the USSR and preventing the situation escalating further, then Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, while citing the restriction of civil rights of ethnic minorities by Moldova as the cause of the dispute, declared the Transnistria proclamation to be devoid of a legal basis and annulled it by presidential decree on 22 December 1990. Nevertheless, no significant action was taken against Transnistria and the new authorities were slowly able to establish control of the region.

Following the 1991 Soviet coup d&#x27;état attempt, the Pridnestrovian Moldavian SSR declared its independence from the Soviet Union. On 5 November 1991 Transnistria abandoned its socialist ideology and was renamed &quot;Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic&quot;.

===Transnistria War===

The Transnistria War followed armed clashes on a limited scale that broke out between Transnistrian separatists and Moldova as early as November 1990 at Dubăsari. Volunteers, including Cossacks, came from Russia to help the separatist side. In mid-April 1992, under the agreements on the split of the military equipment of the former Soviet Union negotiated between the former 15 republics in the previous months, Moldova created its own Defence Ministry. According to the decree of its creation, most of the 14th Guards Army&#x27;s military equipment was to be retained by Moldova. Starting from 2 March 1992, there was concerted military action between Moldova and Transnistria. The fighting intensified throughout early 1992. The former Soviet 14th Guards Army entered the conflict in its final stage, opening fire against Moldovan forces; approximately 700 people were killed. Moldova has since then exercised no effective control or influence on Transnistrian authorities. A ceasefire agreement, signed on 21 July 1992, has held to the present day.

===Post-war period===
The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) is trying to facilitate a negotiated settlement. Under OSCE auspices, on 8 May 1997, Moldovan President Petru Lucinschi and Transnistrian President Igor Smirnov, signed the &quot;Memorandum on the principles of normalization of relations between the Republic of Moldova and Transnistria&quot;, also known as the &quot;Primakov Memorandum&quot;, sustaining the establishment of legal and state relations, although the memorandum&#x27;s provisions were interpreted differently by the two governments.

In November 2003, Dmitry Kozak, a counselor of Russian president Vladimir Putin, proposed a memorandum on the creation of an asymmetric federal Moldovan state, with Moldova holding a majority and Transnistria being a minority part of the federation. Known as &quot;the Kozak memorandum&quot;, it did not coincide with the Transnistrian position, which sought equal status between Transnistria and Moldova, but gave Transnistria veto powers over future constitutional changes, thus encouraging Transnistria to sign it. Moldovan President Vladimir Voronin was initially supportive of the plan, but refused to sign it after internal opposition and international pressure from the OSCE and US, and after Russia had endorsed the Transnistrian demand to maintain a Russian military presence for the next 20 years as a guarantee for the intended federation.

The 5+2 format (or 5+2 talks, comprising Transnistria, Moldova, Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, plus the United States and the EU as external observers) for negotiation was started in 2005 to deal with the problems, but without results for many years as it was suspended. In February 2011, talks were resumed in Vienna, continuing through to 2018 with some minor agreements being reached. Moldova had, by 2023, dropped the term 5+2 in diplomatic discussions. 

After the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation in March 2014, the head of the Transnistrian parliament asked to join Russia. 

After the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Ukraine sealed its border with Transnistria, which had been the primary route for goods to enter the region. As such, Transnistria is wholly reliant on Moldova to allow imports through its own border. Transnistrian politicians have grown increasingly anxious about the situation, and in 2024 the Supreme Council was convened for the first time since 2006, with the council requesting economic assistance from Russia, and stating that Moldova was actively committing a genocide in the region.

The harsh language towards Moldova, coupled with the Russian-backed Șor protests, and an alleged attempted coup plotted by the Wagner Group has shifted Moldova further towards the European Union, and thus less likely to enter negotiations for economic relief from Transnistria. Transnistria&#x27;s request for &quot;protection&quot; from Russia alongside some calls for a referendum has led to suggestions that Russia may attempt to &quot;annex&quot; the region, as they did with occupied Ukraine in 2022.

On 1 January 2025 an agreement under which Russian gas was delivered via Ukraine ended, halting the flow of Russian gas to Transnistria, and creating a severe energy crisis. Transnistrian authorities have refused to purchase gas at market rates from Moldova, while Russia has not resumed delivery through an alternative route.

==Geography==


Transnistria is landlocked and borders Bessarabia (the region the Republic of Moldova is based on, for ) to the west, and Ukraine (for ) to the east. It is a narrow valley stretching north–south along the bank of the Dniester river, which forms a natural boundary along most of the &quot;de facto&quot; border with Moldova.

The territory controlled by the PMR is mostly, but not completely, conterminous with the left (eastern) bank of Dniester. It includes ten cities and towns, and 69 communes, with a total of 147 localities (including here those unincorporated). Six communes on the left bank (Cocieri, Molovata Nouă, Corjova, Pîrîta, Coșnița, and Doroțcaia) remained under the control of the Moldovan government after the Transnistria War of 1992, as part of the Dubăsari District. They are situated north and south of the city of Dubăsari, which itself is under PMR control. The village of Roghi of Molovata Nouă Commune is also controlled by the PMR (Moldova controls the other nine of the 10 villages of the six communes).

On the west bank, in Bessarabia, the city of Bender (Tighina) and four communes (containing six villages) to its east, south-east, and south, on the opposite bank of the river Dniester from the city of Tiraspol (Proteagailovca, Gîsca, Chițcani, and Cremenciug) are controlled by the PMR.

The localities controlled by Moldova on the eastern bank, the village of Roghi, and the city of Dubăsari (situated on the eastern bank and controlled by the PMR) form a security zone along with the six villages and one city controlled by the PMR on the western bank, as well as two (Varnița and Copanca) on the same west bank under Moldovan control. The security situation inside it is subject to the Joint Control Commission rulings.

The main transportation route in Transnistria is the M4 road from Tiraspol to Rîbnița through Dubăsari. The highway is controlled in its entirety by the PMR. North and south of Dubăsari it passes through land corridors controlled by Moldova in the villages of Doroțcaia, Cocieri, Roghi, and Vasilievca, the latter being located entirely to the east of the road. The road is the de facto border between Moldova and Transnistria in the area. Conflict erupted on several occasions when the PMR prevented the villagers from reaching their farmland east of the road.

Transnistrians are able to travel (normally without difficulty) in and out of the territory under PMR control to neighbouring Moldovan-controlled territory and to Ukraine. International air travellers rely on the airport in the Moldovan capital Chișinău, or the airport in Odesa, in Ukraine.

The climate is humid continental with subtropical characteristics. Transnistria has warm summers and cool to cold winters. Precipitation is unvarying all year round, although with a slight increase in the summer months.
==Administrative divisions==

Transnistria is subdivided into five districts (&quot;raions&quot;) and one municipality, the city of Tiraspol (which is entirely surrounded by but administratively distinct from Slobozia District), listed below from north to south (Russian names and transliterations are appended in parentheses). In addition, another municipality, the City of Bender, situated on the western bank of the Dniester, in Bessarabia, and geographically outside Transnistria, is not part of the territorial unit of Transnistria as defined by the Moldovan central authorities, but it is controlled by the PMR authorities, which consider it part of PMR&#x27;s administrative organisation:

Each of the districts is further divided into cities and communes.
==Political status==


All UN member states consider Transnistria a legal part of the Republic of Moldova. Only the partially recognised or unrecognised states of South Ossetia and Abkhazia have recognised Transnistria as a sovereign entity after it declared independence from Moldova in 1990 with Tiraspol as its declared capital.

Between 1929 and 1940, Tiraspol functioned as the capital of the Moldavian ASSR, an autonomous republic that existed from 1924 to 1940 within the Ukrainian SSR.

Although exercising no direct control over the territory of Transnistria, the Moldovan government passed the &quot;Law on Basic Provisions of the Special Legal Status of Localities from the Left Bank of the Dniester&quot; on 22 July 2005, which established part of Transnistria (territory of Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic without Bender and without territories, which are under control of Moldova) as the Administrative-Territorial Units of the Left Bank of the Dniester within the Republic of Moldova.

According to the 2004 census, the population of Transnistria comprised 555,347 people, while at the 2015 census the population decreased to 475,373. In 2004, 90% of the population of Transnistria were citizens of Transnistria. Transnistrians may have dual, triple or even quadruple citizenship of internationally recognised countries, including:
* Citizens of Moldova: around 300,000 people (including dual citizens of Moldova and Russia, around 20,000) or of Moldova and the EU states (around 80%) of Romania, Bulgaria, or the Czech Republic
* Citizens of Romania: unknown number
* Citizens of Russia: around 150,000 people (including around 15,000 dual citizens of Belarus, Israel, Turkey); excluding those holding dual citizenship of Russia and of Moldova (around 20,000)
* Citizens of Ukraine: around 100,000 people There are around 20,000–30,000 people with dual citizenship (Moldova and Ukraine, or Russia and Ukraine) or triple citizenship (Moldova, Russia and Ukraine). They are included in the number of Ukrainian citizens.
* Persons without citizenship: around 20,000–30,000 people

Fifteen villages from the 11 communes of Dubăsari District, including Cocieri and Doroțcaia that geographically are located on the east bank of the Dniester (in Transnistria region), have been under the control of the central government of Moldova after the involvement of local inhabitants on the side of Moldovan forces during the War of Transnistria. These villages, along with Varnița and Copanca, near Bender and Tiraspol, are claimed by the PMR. One city (Bender) and six villages located on the west bank (in Bessarabia region) are controlled by the PMR, but are considered by Moldova as a separate municipality (Bender and village of Proteagailovca) or part of the Căușeni District (five villages in three communes).

Tense situations have periodically surfaced due to these territorial disputes, such as in 2005, when Transnistrian forces entered Vasilievca, in 2006 around Varnița, and in 2007 in the Dubăsari-Cocieri area, when a confrontation between Moldovan and Transnistrian forces occurred, though without any casualties.

June 2010 surveys indicated that 13% of Transnistria&#x27;s population desired the area&#x27;s reintegration into Moldova in the condition of territorial autonomy, while 46% wanted Transnistria to be part of the Russian Federation.

===International relations===

Transnistria is a non-UN member state recognised as independent only by Abkhazia and South Ossetia, both being non-UN member states with limited recognition.

Nina Shtanski served as Transnistria&#x27;s Minister of Foreign Affairs from 2012 to 2015; succeeded her as minister. In 2024 Vitaly Ignatiev was declared wanted by the Security Service of Ukraine due to suspicion of collaboration and encroachment on the territorial integrity of Ukraine.

==Government and politics==
Transnistria is a semi-presidential republic with a powerful presidency. The president is directly elected for a maximum of two consecutive five-year terms. The current President is Vadim Krasnoselsky.

The Supreme Council is a unicameral legislature. It has 43 members who are elected for 5-year terms. Elections take place within a multi-party system. The majority in the supreme council belongs to the Renewal movement that defeated the Republic party affiliated with Igor Smirnov in 2005 and performed even better in the 2010 and 2015 elections. Elections in Transnistria are not recognised by international bodies such as the European Union, as well as numerous individual countries, who called them a source of increased tensions.

There is disagreement over whether elections in Transnistria are free and fair. The political regime has been described as one of &quot;super-presidentialism&quot; before the 2011 constitutional reform. During the 2006 presidential election, the registration of opposition candidate Andrey Safonov was delayed until a few days before the vote, so that he had little time to conduct an election campaign. Some sources consider election results suspect. In 2001, in one region it was reported that Igor Smirnov collected 103.6% of the votes. The PMR government said &quot;the government of Moldova launched a campaign aimed at convincing international observers not to attend&quot; an election held on 11 December 2005but monitors from the Russian-led Commonwealth of Independent States election monitors ignored that and declared the ballot democratic.
The opposition Narodovlastie party and Power to the People movement were outlawed at the beginning of 2000 and eventually dissolved.

A list published by the European Union had banned travel to the EU for some members of the Transnistrian leadership. Lifted by 2012.

In 2007, the registration of a Social Democratic Party was allowed. This party, led by a former separatist leader and member of the PMR government Andrey Safonov, allegedly favours a union with Moldova.

In September 2007, the leader of the Transnistrian Communist Party, Oleg Khorzhan, was sentenced to a suspended sentence of 1½ years&#x27; imprisonment for organising unsanctioned actions of protest.

According to the 2006 referendum, carried out by the PMR government, 97.2% of the population voted in favour of &quot;independence from Moldova and free association with Russia&quot;. EU and several other countries refused to recognise the referendum results.

Residents will have the opportunity to vote in Moldova&#x27;s referendum on joining the EU, planned for autumn 2024. There will be no voting stations within Transnistria; however, residents will be free to travel into other areas of Moldova to vote, should they wish to.

===Transnistria border customs dispute===

On 3 March 2006, Ukraine introduced new customs regulations on its border with Transnistria. Ukraine declared that it would import goods from Transnistria only with documents processed by Moldovan customs offices as part of the implementation of the joint customs protocol agreed between Ukraine and Moldova on 30 December 2005. Transnistria and Russia termed the act an &quot;economic blockade&quot;.

The United States, the European Union, and the OSCE approved the Ukrainian move, while Russia saw it as a means of political pressure. On 4 March, Transnistria responded by blocking the Moldovan and Ukrainian transport at the borders of Transnistria. The Transnistrian block was lifted after two weeks. However, the Moldovan/Ukrainian block remains in place and holds up progress in status settlement negotiations between the sides. In the months after the regulations, exports from Transnistria declined drastically. Transnistria declared a &quot;humanitarian catastrophe&quot; in the region, while Moldova called the declaration &quot;deliberate misinformation&quot;. Cargoes of humanitarian aid were sent from Russia in response.

===Russian military presence in Transnistria===

The 1992 cease-fire agreement between Moldova and Transnistria established a Russian &quot;peacekeeper&quot; presence in Transnistria and a 1,200-member Russian military contingent is present in Transnistria. Russian troops stationed in parts of Moldova except Transnistria since the time of the USSR were fully withdrawn to Russia by January 1993.

In April 1995, the Soviet 14th Guards Army became the Operational Group of Russian Forces, which by the 2010s had shrunk to two battalions and no more than 1,500 troops.

On 21 October 1994, Russia and Moldova signed an agreement that committed Russia to the withdrawal of the troops within three years of the agreement&#x27;s effective date; this did not come into effect, however, because the Russian Duma did not ratify it. The Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) included a paragraph about the removal of Russian troops from Moldova&#x27;s territory and was introduced into the text of the OSCE Summit Declaration of Istanbul (1999) in which Russia had committed itself to pulling out its troops from Transnistria by the end of 2002. However, even after 2002, the Russian parliament did not ratify the Istanbul accords. On 19 July 2004, after it finally passed through parliament President Vladimir Putin signed the Law on the ratification of the CFE Treaty in Europe, which committed Russia to remove the heavy armaments limited by this Treaty. During 2000–2001, although the CFE Treaty was not fully ratified, to comply with it, Moscow withdrew 125 pieces of Treaty Limited Equipment (TLE) and 60 railway wagons containing ammunition from the Transnistrian region of Moldova. In 2002, Russia withdrew three trainloads (118 railway wagons) of military equipment and two (43 wagons) of ammunition from the Transnistrian region of Moldova, and in 2003, 11 rail convoys transporting military equipment and 31 transporting ammunition. According to the OSCE Mission to Moldova, of a total of 42,000 tons of ammunition stored in Transnistria, 1,153 tons (3%) was transported back to Russia in 2001, 2,405 tons (6%) in 2002 and 16,573 tons (39%) in 2003.

Andrei Stratan, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Moldova, stated in his speech during the 12th OSCE Ministerial Council Meeting in Sofia on 6–7 December 2004 that &quot;The presence of Russian troops on the territory of the Republic of Moldova is against the political will of Moldovan constitutional authorities and defies the unanimously recognized international norms and principles, being qualified by Moldovan authorities as a foreign military occupation illegally deployed on the territory of the state&quot;. however, Russia insists that it has already fulfilled those obligations. It states the remaining troops are serving as peacekeepers authorised under the 1992 ceasefire, are not in violation of the Istanbul accords and will remain until the conflict is fully resolved. On the other hand, Moldova believes that fewer than 500 soldiers are authorised pursuant to the ceasefire and, in 2015, began to arrest and deport Russian soldiers who are part of the excess forces and attempt to use Moldovan airports.
In a NATO resolution on 18 November 2008, Russia was urged to withdraw its military presence from the &quot;Transdnestrian region of Moldova&quot;.

In 2011, US Senator John McCain claimed in a visit to Moldova that Moscow is violating the territorial integrity of Moldova and Georgia and one of the &quot;fundamental norms&quot; of &quot;international behavior&quot;. On 21 May 2015, the Ukrainian parliament passed a law terminating five co-operation agreements with Russia. This law effectively terminates the &quot;Agreement on transit of Russian military units temporarily located on the territory of the Republic of Moldova through the territory of Ukraine&quot; dated 4 December 1998.

One point of access for Russian soldiers travelling to Transnistria remains Chișinău International Airport and the short overland journey from there to Tiraspol. Over the years, Moldova has largely permitted Russian officers and soldiers to transit the airport on their way to Transnistria, though occasionally it blocked those that were not clearly identified as international peacekeepers or who failed to give sufficient advance notice. Chișinău Airport would likely only ever agree to the possibility of moving employees, officers, and soldiers of the stationed forces. The passage of soldiers of the 14th Guards Army would be illegal.

On 27 June 2016, a new law entered in force in Transnistria, punishing actions or public statements, including through the usage of mass media, networks of information and telecommunications or the Internet, criticising the military mission of the Russian Army stationed in Transnistria, or presenting interpretations perceived to be &quot;false&quot; by the Transnistrian government of the Russian Army&#x27;s military mission. The punishment is up to three years of jail for ordinary people or up to seven years of jail if the crime was committed by a person of responsibility or a group of persons by prior agreement.

====Russian invasion of Ukraine====
After the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Transnistria declared it would maintain its neutrality in the situation and denied claims that it would assist in the attack on Ukraine.

During the prelude to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Ukrainian military intelligence stated on 14 January 2022 that they had evidence that the Russian government was covertly planning false flag &quot;provocations&quot; against Russian soldiers stationed in Transnistria, which would be used to justify a Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Russian government denied the claims. In that prelude, similar unattributed clashes happened in Donbas in February 2022: Ukraine denied being involved in those incidents and called them a false flag operation as well.

On 15 March 2022, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe recognised Transnistria as a Moldovan territory occupied by Russia.

On 14 April 2022, one of Ukraine&#x27;s deputy defence ministers, Hanna Maliar, stated that Russia was massing its troops along the borders with Transnistria but the Transnistrian authorities denied it. According to the Transnistrian authorities, on April 25 there was an attack on the premises of the Ministry for State Security and on the next day two transmitting antennas broadcasting Russian radio programs at Grigoriopol transmitter near the Ukrainian border were blown up. The Moldovan authorities called these events a provocation aimed at destabilising the situation in the region. The Russian army has a military base, a large ammunition dump and about 1,500 soldiers stationed in Transnistria, stating that they are there as &quot;peacekeepers&quot;.

Since the invasion of Ukraine, Transnistria has lost its economic connections with Ukraine and has had to rely and become more dependent on Moldova and trade links to the EU, resulting in an intensification of dialogue and collaboration, such as the help provided to Ukrainian refugees.

==Law==
The legislation of Transnistria is classified into several areas:
* The Constitution, a codex containing 28 consolidated legislative acts.
This area of legislation concerns the establishment of the Supreme Court, Arbitration Court, the Constitutional Court and the judicial and governmental system of the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic. It also concerns the establishment of the statuses of some government officials, such as Judges, Deputies of the Supreme Council and the Prosecutors&#x27; Office. It also establishes a commissioner for human rights, special legal regimes, citizenship law, This category also contains amendments to the constitutional order, and its procedure to make alterations to the constitution.
* Laws relating to the foundational law and constitutional system, a codex containing 81 legislative acts.
* Laws relating to the budget, finance, economic and taxation, a codex containing 55 legislative acts.
* Laws relating to the judicial system and its procedures, a codex containing 13 legislative acts.
* Laws relating to criminal, customs and administrative law, a codex containing 12 legislative acts.
* Laws relating to the military and defence sector, a codex containing 16 legislative acts.
* Laws relating to the civil, housing and family Law, a codex containing 28 legislative acts.
* Laws relating to healthcare and social protection, a codex containing 49 legislative acts.
* Laws relating to the field of agriculture and ecology, A codex containing 28 legislative acts.
* Laws relating to industry, trade, privatisation, construction, transport, energy and communications, a codex containing 42 legislative acts.
* Laws relating to education, culture, sports, youth policy, media, and implementation of political rights and freedoms of citizens, a codex containing 43 legislative acts.
* Laws relating to government programs and government targeted programs, a codex containing 20 legislative acts.

==Military==
, the armed forces and the paramilitary of Transnistria were composed of around 4,500–7,500 soldiers, divided into four motorised infantry brigades in Tiraspol, Bender, Rîbnița, and Dubăsari. They have 18 tanks, 107 armoured personnel carriers, 73 field guns, 46 anti-aircraft installations, and 173 tank destroyer units. The airforce is composed of 1 Mi-8T and 1 Mi-24 helicopter. Previous aircraft operated were Antonov An-26, Antonov An-2, and Yakovlev Yak-52 fixed wing and Mil Mi-2 and other Mi-8T and Mi-24 helicopters.

==Demographics==

===2015 census===

In October 2015, Transnistrian authorities organised another separate census from the 2014 Moldovan census. According to the 2015 census, the population of the region was 475,373, a 14.5% decrease from the figure recorded in the 2004 census. The urbanisation rate was 69.9%. By ethnic composition, the population of Transnistria was distributed as follows: Russians – 29.1%, Moldovans – 28.6%, Ukrainians – 22.9%, Bulgarians – 2.4%, Gagauzians – 1.1%, Belarusians – 0.5%, Transnistrian – 0.2%, other nationalities – 1.4%. About 14% of the population did not declare their nationality. Also, for the first time, the population had the option to identify as &quot;Transnistrian&quot;.

According to another source, the largest ethnic groups in 2015 were 161,300 Russians (34%), 156,600 Moldovans (33%), and 126,700 Ukrainians (26.7%). Bulgarians comprised 13,300 (2.8%), Gagauz 5,700 (1.2%) and Belarusians 2,800 (0.6%). Germans accounted for 1,400 or 0.3% and Poles for 1,000 or 0.2%. All other ethnic groups combined accounted for 5,700 people or 1.2%.

===2004 census===

In 2004, Transnistrian authorities organised a separate census from the 2004 Moldovan Census. As per 2004 census, in the areas controlled by the PMR government, there were 555,347 people, including 177,785 Moldovans (32.1%) 168,678 Russians (30.4%) 160,069 Ukrainians (28.8%) 13,858 Bulgarians (2.5%) 4,096 Gagauzians (0.7%), 1,791 Poles (0.3%), 1,259 Jews (0.2%), 507 Roma (0.1%) and 27,454 others (4.9%).

Of these, 439,243 lived in Transnistria itself, and 116,104 lived in localities controlled by the PMR government, but formally belonging to other districts of Moldova: the city of Bender (Tighina), the communes of Proteagailovca, Gîsca, Chițcani, Cremenciug, and the village of &quot;Roghi&quot; of commune Molovata Nouă.

Moldovans were the largest ethnic group, representing an overall majority in the two districts in the central Transnistria (Dubăsari District, 50.2%, and Grigoriopol District, 64.8%) a 47.8% relative majority in the northern Camenca District, and a 41.5% relative majority in the southern (Slobozia District). In Rîbnița District they were a 29.9% minority, and in the city of Tiraspol, they constituted a 15.2% minority of the population.

As per last census, Russians were the second largest ethnic group, representing a 41.6% relative majority in the city of Tiraspol, a 24.1% minority in Slobozia, a 19.0% minority in Dubăsari, a 17.2% minority in Râbnița, a 15.3% minority in Grigoriopol, and a 6.9% minority in Camenca.

Ukrainians were the third largest ethnic group, representing a 45.41% relative majority in the northern Rîbnița District, a 42.6% minority in Camenca, a 33.0% minority in Tiraspol, a 28.3% minority in Dubăsari, a 23.4% minority in Slobozia, and a 17.4% minority in Grigoriopol. A substantial number of Poles clustered in northern Transnistria were Ukrainianised during Soviet rule.

Bulgarians were the fourth largest ethnic group in Transnistria, albeit much less numerous than the three larger ethnicities. Most Bulgarians in Transnistria are Bessarabian Bulgarians, descendants of expatriates who settled in Bessarabia in the 18th–19th century. The major centre of Bulgarians in Transnistria is the large village of Parcani (situated between the cities of Tiraspol and Bender), which had an absolute Bulgarian majority and a total population of around 10,000.

In Bender (Tighina) and the other non-Transnistria localities under PMR control, ethnic Russians represented a 43.4% relative majority, followed by Moldovans at 26.2%, Ukrainians at 17.1%, Bulgarians at 2.9%, Gagauzians at 1.0%, Jews at 0.3%, Poles at 0.2%, Roma at 0.1%, and others at 7.8%.

===1989 census===

At the census of 1989, the population was 679,000 (including all the localities in the security zone, even those under Moldovan control). The ethnic composition of the region has been unstable in recent history, with the most notable change being the decreasing share of Moldovan and Jewish population segments and increase of the Russian. For example, the percentage of Russians grew from 13.7% in 1926 to 25.5% in 1989 and further to 30.4% in 2004, while the Moldovan population decreased from 44.1% in 1926 to 39.9% in 1989 and 31.9% in 2004. Only the proportion of Ukrainians remained reasonably stable27.2% in 1926, 28.3% in 1989 and 28.8% in 2004.

==Religion==
PMR official statistics show that 92% of the Transnistrian population adhere to Eastern Orthodox Christianity, with 4% adhering to Roman Catholicism. Roman Catholics are mainly located in northern Transnistria, where a notable Polish minority lives.

Transnistria&#x27;s government has supported the restoration and construction of new Orthodox churches. It affirms that the republic has freedom of religion and states that 114 religious beliefs and congregations are officially registered. However, as recently as 2005, registration hurdles were met with by some religious groups, notably the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses. In 2007, the US-based Christian Broadcasting Network denounced the persecution of Protestants in Transnistria.

==Economy==
Transnistria has a mixed economy. Following a large scale privatisation process in the late 1990s, most of the companies in Transnistria are now privately owned. The economy is based on a mix of heavy industry (steel production), electricity production, and manufacturing (textile production), which together account for about 80% of the total industrial output.
Transnistria has its own central bank, the Transnistrian Republican Bank, which issues its national currency, the Transnistrian ruble. It is convertible at a freely floating exchange rate but only in Transnistria.

Transnistria&#x27;s economy is frequently described as dependent on contraband and gunrunning. Some commentators, including Zbigniew Brzezinski, have even labelled it a mafia state. These allegations are denied by the Transnistrian government, and sometimes downplayed by the officials of Russia and Ukraine.

===Economic history===
After World War II, Transnistria was heavily industrialised, to the point that, in 1990, it was responsible for 40% of Moldova&#x27;s GDP and 90% of its electricity, although it accounted for only 17% of Moldova&#x27;s population. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Transnistria wanted to return to a &quot;Brezhnev-style planned economy&quot;. However, several years later, it decided to head toward a market economy.

===Macroeconomics===
According to the government of Transnistria, the 2007 GDP was 6789 mln ruble (appx US$799 million) and the GDP per capita was about US$1,500. The GDP increased by 11.1% and inflation rate was 19.3% with the GDP per capita being $2,140, higher than the contemporaneous Moldovan GDP per capita of $2,040. Transnistria&#x27;s government budget for 2007 was US$246 million, with an estimated deficit of about US$100 million that the government planned to cover with income from privatisations. The budget for 2008 is US$331 million, with an estimated deficit of about US$80 million.

In 2004, Transnistria had debts of US$1.2 billion (two-thirds are with Russia) that was per capita about six times higher than in Moldova (without Transnistria). In March 2007 the debt to Gazprom for the acquisition of natural gas increased to US$1.3 billion. On 22 March 2007 Gazprom sold Transnistria&#x27;s gas debt to the Russian businessman Alisher Usmanov, who controls Moldova Steel Works, the largest enterprise in Transnistria. Transnistria&#x27;s president Igor Smirnov announced that Transnistria will not pay its gas debt because &quot;Transnistria has no legal debt to Gazprom&quot;. In November 2007, the total debt of Transnistria&#x27;s public sector was up to US$1.64 billion.

In the first half of 2023 the economic situation worsened with imports increasing 12% to $1.32 billion and exports falling by 10% to just $346m, the trade deficit of $970m, almost equal to the GDP of Transnistria in the whole of 2021, being financed by the non-payment of natural gas supplies from Russia.

===External trade===
In 2020, the Transnistrian Customs reported exports of US$633.1 million and imports of US$1,052.7 million. In the early 2000s over 50% of the export went to the CIS, mainly to Russia, but also to Belarus, Ukraine, and Moldova (which Transnistrian authorities consider foreign). Main non-CIS markets for the Transnistrian goods were Italy, Egypt, Greece, Romania, and Germany. The CIS accounted for over 60% of the imports, while the share of the EU was about 23%. The main imports were non-precious metals, food products, and electricity.

After Moldova signed the Association Agreement with the EU in 2014, Transnistriabeing claimed as part of Moldovaenjoyed the tariff-free exports to the EU. As a result, in 2015, 27% of Transnistria&#x27;s US$189 million exports went to the EU, while exports to Russia went down to 7.7%. This shift towards the EU market continued to grow in 2016.

From March 2022, with the Ukrainian border closed to Transnistria, all trade goods to and from Transnistria have needed to flow through Moldova, Transnistria now has to comply with Moldovan and EU standards when exporting products. Transnistria reported on trade in the first half of 2023. 48% of exports were to the rest of Moldova, over 33% went to the EU and 9% to Russia. 68% of imports came from Russia, 14% from the EU and 7% from Moldova.

In 2024 as a result of the free trade agreement between Moldova and the European Union, from which Transnistria also benefits, Moldova decided that imports/exports to/from Transnistria should be treated the same as imports/exports to/from Moldova, accordingly Transnistria importers wishing to import from/through Moldova must register and may, depending on the goods, be subject to taxes on imported goods, payable to Moldova.

On the 30th of December 2024, Tirasteploenegro released a set of instructions - anticipating the expiration of Gazprom&#x27;s deal with Ukraine, saying to only drain the pipes and batteries in emergencies, to close every tap that has been running (if the water supply dissapears) to avoid flooding when it turns back on, to &quot;dress warmly&quot;, to avoid fires during Winter and Autumn, to not use gas or electric stoves for heating rooms as it may lead to tragedy, and to instead use factory-made electric heaters &quot;only&quot;; not home-made ones.

On the New Year of 2025, Gazprom&#x27;s deal with Ukraine to transport gas through it had expired, as Ukraine had refused to extend the deal, calling it a &quot;historic moment&quot;. This caused a severe gas shortage, and so only critical infrastructure was allowed to be heated, and houses were dropped from it to save on gas. The Cuciurgan power station, which is both Transnistria&#x27;s and Moldova&#x27;s main plant, is now also being fueled with coal, however the supply is only enough for 50 days.

===Economic sectors===
The leading industry is steel, due to the Moldova Steel Works (part of the Russian Metalloinvest holding) in Rîbnița, which accounts for about 60% of the budget revenue of Transnistria. The largest company in the textile industry is Tirotex, which claims to be the second largest textile company in Europe. The energy sector is dominated by Russian companies. The largest power company Moldavskaya GRES (Cuciurgan power station) is in Dnestrovsc and owned by Inter RAO UES, and the gas transmission and distribution company Tiraspoltransgaz is probably controlled by Gazprom, although Gazprom has not confirmed the ownership officially. The banking sector of Transnistria consists of 8 commercial banks, including Gazprombank. The oldest alcohol producer KVINT, located in Tiraspol, produces and exports brandy, wines and vodka.

==Education==
Transnistria has kept to the Russian educational standards, mainly using the Russian curriculum.

Higher education diplomas issued by Transnistrian authorities are not recognised by most countries, resulting in graduates being unable to obtain well-paid jobs in Moldova or Western countries, leaving Russia as the default location for students and graduates.

==Human rights==
The human rights record of the Transnistrian authorities has been criticised by several governments and international organisations. The 2007 &quot;Freedom in the World&quot; report, published by the U.S.-based Freedom House, described it as a &quot;non-free&quot; territory, having an equally bad situation in both political rights and civil liberties.

According to a 2006 U.S. Department of State report:

===LGBTQ rights===

Transnistria does not recognize same-sex unions. The Code of Marriage and Family that came into force in 2002 states that marriage is a voluntary marital union between a man and a woman. The code does not recognize other types of partnership for both opposite-sex and same-sex couples other than marriage.

===Media===

There is a regular mix of modern news media in Transnistria with a number of television stations, newspapers, and radio stations.

According to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) the media climate in Transnistria is restrictive and the authorities continue a long-standing campaign to silence independent opposition voices and groups.

According to a US Department of State report for 2006, &quot;Both of the region&#x27;s major newspapers were controlled by the authorities. There was one independent weekly newspaper in Bender and another in the northern city of Rîbnița... Separatist authorities harassed independent newspapers for critical reporting of the Transnistrian regime... Most television and radio stations and print publication were controlled by Transnistrian authorities, which largely dictated their editorial policies and finance operations. Some broadcast networks, such as the TSV television station and the INTER-FM radio station, were owned by Transnistria&#x27;s largest monopoly, Sheriff, which also holds a majority in the region&#x27;s legislature... In July 2005 the Transnistrian Supreme Council amended the election code to prohibit media controlled by the Transnistrian authorities from publishing results of polls and forecasts related to elections.&quot;

===Romanian-language schools===

Public education in the Romanian language (officially called Moldovan language in Transnistria) is done using the Soviet-originated Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet. The usage of the Latin script was restricted to only six schools. Four of these schools were forcibly closed by the authorities, for alleged refusal of the schools to apply for official accreditation. These schools were later registered as private schools and reopened, a development which may have been accelerated by pressure from the European Union.

The OSCE mission to Moldova has urged local authorities in the Transnistrian city of Rîbnița to return a confiscated building to the Moldovan Latin script school in the city. The unfinished building was nearing completion in 2004 when Transnistria took control of it during that year&#x27;s school crisis.

In November 2005 Ion Iovcev, the principal of a Romanian-language school in Transnistria and active advocate for human rights as well as a critic of the Transnistrian leadership, received threatening calls that he attributed to his criticism of the separatist regime.

In August 2021, the Transnistrian government refused to register the Lucian Blaga High School at Tiraspol and forced it to suspend its activities for three months, which will affect the school year of the students of the school and constitutes a violation of several articles of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

==Arms control and disarmament==
Following the collapse of the former Soviet Union, the Russian 14th Army left 40,000 tons of weaponry and ammunition in Transnistria. In later years there were concerns that the Transnistrian authorities would try to sell these stocks internationally, and intense pressure was applied to have these removed by Russia.

In 2000 and 2001, Russia withdrew by rail 141 self-propelled artillery pieces and other armoured vehicles and locally destroyed 108 T-64 tanks and 139 other pieces of military equipment limited by the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE). During 2002 and 2003 Russian military officials destroyed a further 51 armoured vehicles, all of which were types not limited by the CFE Treaty. The OSCE also observed and verified the withdrawal of 48 trains with military equipment and ammunition in 2003. However, no further withdrawal activities have taken place since March 2004 and a further 20,000 tons of ammunition, as well as some remaining military equipment, are still to be removed.

In the autumn of 2006, the Transnistrian leadership agreed to let an OSCE inspectorate examine the munitions and further access was agreed moving forward.

Recent weapons inspections were permitted by Transnistria and conducted by the OSCE.
The onus of responsibility rests on Russia to remove the rest of the supplies.

Transnistrian authorities declared that they are not involved in the manufacture or export of weapons. OSCE and European Union officials stated in 2005 that there is no evidence that Transnistria &quot;has ever trafficked arms or nuclear material&quot; and much of the alarm is due to the Moldovan government&#x27;s attempts to pressure Transnistria.

In 2007, foreign experts working on behalf of the United Nations said that the historically low levels of transparency and continued denial of full investigations to international monitors have reinforced negative perceptions of the Transnistrian government, although recent co-operation by Transnistrian authorities may have reflected a shift in the attitude of Transnistria. Their report stated that the evidence for the illicit production and trafficking of weapons into and from Transnistria, has in the past been exaggerated, although the trafficking of light weapons is likely to have occurred before 2001 (the last year when export data showed US$900,000 worth of &#x27;weapons, munitions, their parts and accessories&#x27; exported from Transnistria). The report also states that the same holds true for the production of such weapons, which is likely to have been carried out in the 1990s, primarily to equip Transnistrian forces.

The OSCE mission spokesman Claus Neukirch spoke about this situation: &quot;There is often talk about sale of armaments from Transnistria, but there is no convincing evidence&quot;.

In 2010, Viktor Kryzhanivsky, Ukraine&#x27;s special envoy on Transnistria, stated that there was no ongoing arms or drug trafficking through the Transnistrian section of the Ukrainian-Moldovan border at the time.

==Sport==
Transnistria is notable for being home to the Sheriff Tiraspol football club, which in 2021 became the first team representing Moldova to qualify for the UEFA Champions League group stage. In 2022, UEFA blocked Sheriff from playing home games in Transnistria.

<doc id="376587" wikidata="Q505632" url="?curid=376587" title="Padania">
<text>Padania ( , , ) is an alternative name and proposed independent state encompassing Northern Italy, derived from the name of the Po River (Latin &quot;Padus&quot;), whose basin includes much of the region, centered on the Po Valley (), the major plain of Northern Italy.

Coined in 1903 as a geographical term roughly corresponding to the historically Celtic land of Cisalpine Gaul, the term was popularized beginning in the early 1990s, when Lega Nord, a federalist and, at times, separatist political party in Italy, proposed it as a possible name for an independent state. Since then it has been strongly associated with &quot;Padanian nationalism&quot; and North Italian separatism.
Padania as defined in Lega Nord&#x27;s 1996 &quot;Declaration of Independence and Sovereignty of Padania&quot; goes beyond Northern Italy and includes much of Central Italy, for a greater &quot;Padania&quot; that includes more than half of the Republic of Italy (161,000 of 301,000 km2 in area, 34 million out of 60 million in population).

Some Padanians consider themselves to have Celtic ancestry and/or heritage.

==Etymology==
The adjective &quot;padano&quot; is derived from &quot;Padus&quot;, the Latin name of the Po River.
The French client republics in the Po Valley during the Napoleonic era included the Cispadane Republic and the Transpadane Republic, according to the custom (emerged with the French Revolution) of naming territories on the basis of watercourses. 
The ancient &quot;Regio XI&quot; (the region of the Roman Empire on the current territory of the Aosta Valley, Piedmont and Lombardy) has been referred to as &quot;Regio XI Transpadana&quot; only in modern historiography.

The terms &quot;Pianura Padana&quot; or &quot;Val Padana&quot; are the standard denominations in geography textbooks and atlases, but the derivation &quot;Padania&quot; was coined back in 1903 and popularized by a Hoepli geographical encyclopedia in 1910.

Journalist Gianni Brera from the 1960s used the term Padania to indicate the area that at the time of Cato the Elder corresponded to Cisalpine Gaul. 
In the same years and later, the term Padania was considered a geographic synonym of Po Valley and as such was included in the &quot;Enciclopedia Universo&quot; in 1965 and in the &quot;Devoto–Oli&quot; dictionary of the Italian language in 1971. 
The term was also used in Italian dialectology, in relation to Gallo-Italic languages, and sometimes even extended to all regional languages distinguishing Northern from Central Italy along the La Spezia–Rimini Line.

==Macroregion==
The first use of &quot;Padania&quot; in socio-economic terms dates from 1975, when Guido Fanti, the Communist President of Emilia-Romagna, proposed a union composed of Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, Lombardy, Piedmont and Liguria. 
The term was seldom used in these terms until the Giovanni Agnelli Foundation re-launched it in 1992 through the volume &quot;La Padania, una regione italiana in Europa&quot; (English: &quot;Padania, an Italian region in Europe&quot;), written by various academics.

In 1990 Gianfranco Miglio, a political scientist who would be elected senator for Lega Nord in 1992 and 1994, wrote a book in which he described a draft constitutional reform. According to Miglio, &quot;Padania&quot; (consisting of five regions: Veneto, Lombardy, Piedmont, Liguria and Emilia-Romagna with the addition of the provinces of Massa-Carrara and Pesaro and Urbino in the Tuscany and Marche regions, respectively) would become one of the three hypothetical macroregions of a future Italy, along with &quot;Etruria&quot; (Central Italy, without the two aforementioned provinces) and &quot;Mediterranea&quot; (Southern Italy), while the autonomous regions (Aosta Valley, Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Sicily and Sardinia) would be left with their current autonomy.

==In political science==

Gilberto Oneto, a student of Miglio without any academic credentials, in the 1990s researched northern traditions and culture to find evidence of the existence of a common Padanian heritage. Historian and linguist Sergio Salvi (2014) has also defended the concept of Padania.

In 1993 Robert D. Putnam, a political scientist at Harvard University, wrote a book titled &quot;Making Democracy Work: Civic Traditions in Modern Italy&quot;, in which he spoke of a &quot;civic North&quot;, defined according to the inhabitants&#x27; civic traditions and attitudes, and explained its social peculiarities to the historical emergence of the free medieval communes since the 10th century.

Lega Nord&#x27;s definition of Padania&#x27;s boundaries is similar to Putnam&#x27;s &quot;civic North&quot;, which also includes the central Italian regions of Tuscany, Marche and Umbria. Stefano Galli, a political scientist close to the party and columnist for &quot;Il Giornale&quot; and &quot;La Padania&quot;, has called Putnam&#x27;s theory a source for defining Padania. According to Galli, these regions share similar patterns of civil society, citizenship, and government with the North.

The existence of a &quot;Padanian nation&quot; has been however criticised by a number of organisations and individuals in Italy, from the Italian Geographical Society to historian Paolo Bernardini, who is a supporter of Venetian nationalism instead. Angelo Panebianco, a political scientist, once explained that, even though a &quot;Padanian nation&quot; does not exist yet, it might well emerge as all nations are ultimately human inventions.

==Padanian nationalism==
Lega Nord, a political party created in 1991 by the union of several northern regional parties (including Lega Lombarda and Liga Veneta), used the term for a larger geographical range than the Po Valley proper, or the macroregion 
proposed by Fanti in the 1970s.

Since 1991, Lega Nord has promoted either secession or larger autonomy for Padania, and has created a flag and a national anthem to this effect. In 1996, the &quot;Federal Republic of Padania&quot; was proclaimed. Subsequently, in 1997, Lega Nord created an unofficial Padanian parliament in Mantua and organised elections for it. Lega Nord also chose a national anthem: the &quot;Va, pensiero&quot; chorus from Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Nabucco&quot;, in which the exiled Hebrew slaves lament their lost homeland.

The term Padania has been also used in politics by other nationalist/separatist parties and groups, including Lega Padana, Lega Padana Lombardia, the Padanian Union, the Alpine Padanian Union, Veneto Padanian Federal Republic and the Padanian Independentist Movement.

===Lega Nord&#x27;s Padania===

According to Lega Nord&#x27;s &quot;Declaration of Independence and Sovereignty of Padania&quot;, Padania is composed of 14 &quot;nations&quot; (Lombardy, Veneto, Piedmont, Tuscany, Emilia, Liguria, Marche, Romagna, Umbria, Friuli, Trentino, South Tyrol, Venezia Giulia, Aosta Valley), encompassing both Northern and Central Italy and slightly differing from Gianfranco Miglio&#x27;s project. The current 11 regions of Italy forming Padania, according to the party, are listed below:

===Flag of Padania===

The &quot;Sun of the Alps&quot; is the unofficial flag of Padania and the symbol of the Padanian nationalism. The flag has a green stylized sun on a white background. It resembles ancient ornaments which are found in the art and culture of the area, like one example of Etruscan art from the 7th century BC found at Civitella Paganico. The flag was created in the 1990s and was adopted by Lega Nord upon their declaration of Padanian independence.

In its previous version, the flag included a red St George&#x27;s Cross and a smaller Sun of the Alps in the upper part.

===Opinion polling===
While support for a federal system, as opposed to a centrally administered state, receives widespread consensus within Padania, support for independence is less favoured. One poll in 1996 estimated that 52.4% of interviewees from Northern Italy considered secession advantageous (&quot;vantaggiosa&quot;) and 23.2% both advantageous and desirable (&quot;auspicabile&quot;). Another poll in 2000 estimated that about 20% of &quot;Padanians&quot; (18.3% in North-West Italy and 27.4% in North-East Italy) supported secession in case Italy was not reformed into a federal state.

According to a poll conducted in February 2010 by GPG, 45% of Northerners support the independence of Padania. A poll conducted by SWG in June 2010 puts that figure at 61% of Northerners (with 80% of them supporting at least federal reform), while noting that 55% of Italians consider Padania as only a political invention, against 42% believing in its real existence (45% of the sample being composed of Northerners, 19% of Central Italians and 36% of Southerners). As for federal reform, according to the poll, 58% of Italians support it. A more recent poll by SWG puts the support for fiscal federalism and secession respectively at 68% and 37% in Piedmont and Liguria, 77% and 46% in Lombardy, 81% and 55% in Triveneto (comprising Veneto), 63% and 31% in Emilia-Romagna, 51% and 19% in Central Italy (not including Lazio).

<doc id="376588" wikidata="Q6625466" url="?curid=376588" title="List of linguistic example sentences">
<text>The following is a partial list of linguistic example sentences illustrating various linguistic phenomena.

== Ambiguity ==
Different types of ambiguity which are possible in language.

=== Lexical ambiguity ===
Demonstrations of words which have multiple meanings dependent on context.
* Will, will Will will Will Will&#x27;s will? – Will (a person), will (future tense auxiliary verb) Will (a second person) will (bequeath) Will (a third person) Will&#x27;s (the second person) will (a document)? (Someone asked Will 1 directly if Will 2 plans to bequeath his own will, the document, to Will 3.)
* Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo. – Bison (the plural of &quot;buffalos&quot; or &quot;buffalo&quot; is also accepted) from Buffalo, New York, whom bison from Buffalo bully, bully bison from Buffalo.
* Police police Police police police police Police police. – Police officers from Police, Poland, whom police officers from Police patrol, patrol police officers from Police.
* Rose rose to put rose roes on her rows of roses. (Robert J. Baran) – Rose [a person] rose [stood] to put rose [pink-colored] roes [fish eggs as fertilizer] on her rows of roses [flower].
* James while John had had had had had had had had had had had a better effect on the teacher – With punctuation: &quot;James, while John had had &#x27;had&#x27;, had had &#x27;had had&#x27;. &#x27;Had had&#x27; had had a better effect on the teacher&quot;, or &quot;James, while John had had &#x27;had had&#x27;, had had &#x27;had&#x27;. &#x27;Had had&#x27; had had a better effect on the teacher&quot;
* That that is is that that is not is not is that it it is. – Grammatically corrected as: &quot;That that is, is. That that is not, is not. Is that it? It is&quot;.
* Can can can can can can can can can can. – &quot;Examples of the can-can dance that other examples of the same dance are able to outshine, or figuratively to put into the trashcan, are themselves able to outshine examples of the same dance&quot;. It could alternatively be interpreted as a question, &quot;Is it possible for examples of the dance that have been outshone to outshine others?&quot; or several other ways.
* Martin Gardner offered the example: &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t the sentence &#x27;I want to put a hyphen between the words Fish and And and And and Chips in my Fish-And-Chips sign&#x27; have been clearer if quotation marks had been placed before Fish, and between Fish and and, and and and And, and And and and, and and and And, and And and and, and and and Chips, as well as after Chips?&quot;
* The bears bear hard hard yarn yarns. (Lemony Snicket) – The bears endure tiring and unpleasant long stories about hard yarn.
* Fish fish fish fish fish. – With nesting clarified: Fish (that fish (fish that fish)) fish.

=== Syntactic ambiguity ===

Demonstrations of ambiguity between alternative syntactic structures underlying a sentence.
* I made her duck.
* One morning I shot an elephant in my pajamas. How he got in my pajamas, I don&#x27;t know.
* Time flies like an arrow; fruit flies like a banana.
* Eats shoots and leaves

=== Syntactic ambiguity, incrementality, and local coherence ===
Demonstrations of how &quot;incremental&quot; and (at least partially) &quot;local&quot; syntactic parsing leads to infelicitous constructions and interpretations.
* Reduced relative clauses
** The horse raced past the barn fell.
** The coach smiled at the player tossed the frisbee (by the opposing team).
** While the man was hunting the deer ran through the forest. 
** The weasel that a boy that startles the cat thinks loves smiles eats.

=== Scope ambiguity and anaphora resolution ===
* Every farmer who owns a donkey beats it.

=== Embedding ===

* The rat the cat the dog bit chased escaped.
* The editor authors the newspaper hired liked laughed.
* The man who the boy who the students recognized pointed out is a friend of mine.

=== Punctuation ===
Punctuation can be used to introduce ambiguity or misunderstandings where none needed to exist. One well known example, for comedic effect, is from &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; by William Shakespeare (ignoring the punctuation provides the alternate reading).

:Enter QUINCE for the Prologue
:Prologue
::If we offend, it is with our good will.
::That you should think, we come not to offend,
::But with good will. To show our simple skill,
::That is the true beginning of our end.
::Consider then we come but in despite.
::We do not come as minding to content you,
::Our true intent is. All for your delight
::We are not here. That you should here repent you,
::The actors are at hand and by their show
::You shall know all that you are like to know.
::—&quot;ACT V, Scene i&quot;

== Word order ==

=== Ending sentence with preposition ===
Some prescriptive grammar prohibits &quot;preposition stranding&quot;: ending sentences with prepositions.

==== Avoidance ====
* This is the sort of English up with which I will not put. (Attributed by Gowers to Winston Churchill. There is no convincing evidence that Churchill said this, and good reason to believe that he did not.) The sentence &quot;does not demonstrate the absurdity of using fronting instead of stranding; it merely illustrates the ungrammaticality resulting from fronting something that is not a constituent&quot;.

==== Compound use ====
* &quot;A father of a little boy goes upstairs after supper to read to his son, but he brings the wrong book. The boy says, &#x27;What did you bring that book that I don&#x27;t want to be read to out of up for?

== Neurolinguistics ==
Sentences with unexpected endings.
* She spread the bread with socks.
Comparative illusion:
* More people have been to Russia than I have.

== Combinatorial complexity ==
Demonstrations of sentences which are unlikely to have ever been said, although the combinatorial complexity of the linguistic system makes them possible.
* Colorless green ideas sleep furiously (Noam Chomsky): example that is grammatically correct but based on semantic combinations that are contradictory and therefore would not normally occur.
* Hold the news reader&#x27;s nose squarely, waiter, or friendly milk will countermand my trousers.

== Semantics and context ==
Demonstrations of sentences where the semantic interpretation is bound to context or knowledge of the world.
* The large ball crashed right through the table because it was made of Styrofoam: ambiguous use of a pronoun: The word &quot;it&quot; refers to the table being made of Styrofoam; but &quot;it&quot; would immediately refer to the large ball if we replaced &quot;Styrofoam&quot; with &quot;steel&quot; without any other change in its syntactic parse.
* The bee landed on the flower because it had nectar: The pronoun &quot;it&quot; refers to the &quot;flower&quot; but changes to the &quot;bee&quot; if we replace &quot;had&quot; with &quot;wanted&quot;.
* We bought the boys apples because they were so hungry: &quot;they&quot; refers to the boys, but if &quot;hungry&quot; is replaced with &quot;cheap&quot;, with no grammatical change, it refers to the apples.

=== Relevance conditionals ===
Conditionals where the prejacent (&quot;if&quot; clause) is not strictly required for the consequent to be true.
* There are biscuits on the table if you want some (&quot;biscuit conditional&quot;).
* If I may be honest, you&#x27;re not looking good.

== Non-English examples ==
=== Ojibwe ===

* &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;We should fetch Ana, shouldn&#x27;t we?&quot;.

=== Latin ===

* John, Archbishop of Esztergom (Kingdom of Hungary) was pressed to make a statement on the assassination of Gertrude of Merania, and on the first hand the assassination would have been beneficial for the Church but on the other hand taking part in an assassination might have caused him to lose his position and possibly life; so he wrote in 1213: &quot;&#x27;&quot;. The sentence can be read as &quot;&#x27;&quot; (&quot;don&#x27;t kill the Queen, it is good to be afraid, even if all agree I do not. I object.&quot;), or the opposite meaning &quot;&quot; (&quot;Do not be afraid to kill the Queen, it is good, if all agree then I do not object.&quot;). It has been quoted by Boncompagno da Signa is his work &quot;Rhetorica novissima&quot; in 1235 and from there it has been part of the rhetorical education.
** King Edward II of England was killed, reportedly after Adam of Orleton, one of his gaolers, received a message, probably from Mortimer, reading &quot;&#x27;&quot;. This can be read either as &quot;&#x27;&quot; (&quot;Do not kill Edward; it is good to be afraid &quot;) or as &quot;&quot; (&quot;Do not be afraid to kill Edward; is good&quot;). This ambiguous sentence has been much discussed by various writers, including John Harington.

=== Mandarin Chinese ===

* Various sentences using the syllables , , , , and are often used to illustrate the importance of tones to foreign learners. One example: .
* Lion-Eating Poet in the Stone Den: poem of 92 characters, all with the sound &quot;shi&quot; (in four different tones) when read in Modern Standard Mandarin

=== Japanese ===

* Although at first glance the single character sentence does not seem to make sense, when this sentence is read using the right readings of the kanji (in the example it only borrows the pronunciation but not the meaning of the logograms, like man&#x27;yōgana), it means &quot;the young of cat, kitten, and the young of lion, cub&quot;. This would be &quot;猫之子、子猫、獅子之子、子獅子&quot; if it were to be written semantically, with the genitive construction being inferred in the original. It is told in the work Ujishūi Monogatari that the Japanese poet Ono no Takamura used this reading to escape death.

=== Czech ===

* &quot;&quot;, meaning either &quot;they ate elderberries on a mountain using a stick&quot; or &quot;they ate on a mountain without any sticks&quot; or &quot;they ate elderberry using a stick to eat their sorrow away&quot;; depending on the phrasing or a correct placement or punctuation, at least 7 meanings can be obtained. By replacing &quot;na hoře&quot; by &quot;nahoře&quot;, one obtains 5 more meanings. If separating words using spaces is also permitted, the total number of known possible meanings rises to 58.
* Czech has the syllabic consonants and , which can stand in for vowels. A well-known example of a sentence that does not contain a vowel is , meaning &quot;stick your finger through the neck.&quot;

=== Korean ===

* In Gyeongsang dialect, the repetition of the syllable (&quot;ga&quot;) with the right intonation can form meaningful phrases. For example:
** &quot;&quot; which means &quot;Are they the one we talked about?&quot;
** &quot;&quot; which means &quot;Since they took it away&quot;
** &quot;&quot; which means &quot;Are they the one with the surname Ga?&quot;

=== German ===

*A famous example for lexical ambiguity is the following sentence: &quot;&#x27;&quot;, meaning &quot;When flies fly behind flies, then flies fly in pursuit of flies.&quot; It takes advantage of some German nouns and corresponding verbs being homonymous. While not noticeable in spoken language, in written language the difference shows: &quot;Fliegen&quot; (&quot;flies&quot;), being a noun, is written with a capital &quot;F&quot;, whereas &quot;fliegen&quot; (&quot;to fly&quot;), being a verb, is not. The comma can be left out without changing the meaning. There are several variations of this sentence pattern, although they do not work as smoothly as the original. Dutch language shares this same example, with the noticeable difference of not capitalising the initials of nouns, making it &quot;&#x27;&quot;

=== Dutch ===

* Kees Torn expanded on the example given in the German section (&quot;&#x27;&quot;), from which he created: &quot;&#x27;&quot; which uses the fact that zeven has multiple roles: it is a number (seven), a verb (to sieve), a plural noun (sieves) and the name of a German town (Zeven). As such the translation is: &quot;If, in the town where the easy to sieve sieves seven sieves sieve seven sieves, Zeven, seven sieves sieve seven sieves, seven sieves sieve seven sieves&quot;.

=== Persian ===
A famous example for lexical ambiguity in Persian is the following sentence:

It can be read either as:
which means &quot;Forgiveness! no need to execute him/her&quot;

Or as:
which means &quot;Forgiveness not needed! execute her/him&quot;

=== Russian ===
* The same phrase as in Persian: &quot; can be interpreted as &quot; or as &quot;&quot;, which means respectively &quot;Executing is impossible/disallowed, [you should] pardon&quot; and &quot;Execute her/him, pardon is impossible/disallowed&quot;.
* — &quot;Very very drunk cockeyed hare named Kosoy with askew braid mowed with bent scythe on bevel foreland&quot;.

<doc id="376591" wikidata="Q7491159" url="?curid=376591" title="Shaw Festival">
<text>The Shaw Festival is a Charitable theatre festival in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, Canada. It is the second largest repertory theatre company in North America, second only to Canada&#x27;s Stratford Festival. The Shaw Festival was founded in 1962. Originally, it only featured productions written by George Bernard Shaw, but changes were later implemented by Christopher Newton and Jackie Maxwell that widened the theatre&#x27;s scope. As of 2019, the theatre company was considered to be one of the largest 20 employers in the Niagara Region.

==History==
The Festival&#x27;s roots can be traced to 1962 when Brian Doherty and Calvin Rand staged a summertime &quot;Salute to Shaw&quot; at the Court House Theatre. For eight weekends, Doherty and his crew produced Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Don Juan in Hell&quot; and &quot;Candida&quot;.

Paxton Whitehead took over management of the company in 1967. During his tenure, he established the Festival Theatre. Queen Elizabeth II, Indira Gandhi, and Pierre Elliot Trudeau were among those who attended performances at the Shaw Festival Theatre during its inaugural season in 1973. Tony Van Bridge was the interim artistic director for the 1974–75 season. Christopher Newton had declined previous offers to serve as artistic director for the Shaw Festival before accepting the position in 1979. In a 2011 interview with the Globe and Mail, Newton stated that he &quot;hadn&#x27;t really liked Bernard Shaw very much&quot; and that he &quot;made no secret of that fact.&quot; Under Newton, the theatre produced plays that were written during the lifetime of Shaw (1856–1950). His decision to move the Shaw Festival away from the direction of museum theatre was controversial, which resulted in some members of the board directors to propose firing him, but they were not successful. The theatre stopped running at a financial deficit during Newton&#x27;s tenure. His successor, Jackie Maxwell, was appointed in 2003 and expanded the theatre&#x27;s scope further to include works that were set in the same time period as Shaw. By doing so, she was able to allow &quot;strategic integration of female, Canadian and nonwhite voices into the festival&#x27;s programming and casting&quot;. In 2003, a production of &quot;The Coronation Voyage&quot; was the first time a show that was written by a living playwright was featured at the Shaw Festival.

In the summer of 2015, it was announced that Tim Carroll would take over as artistic director and Tim Jennings as executive director. They announced Carroll&#x27;s inaugural 2017 season in August 2016. In 2020, most of the productions scheduled for that season were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario. The theatre company reduced financial losses through production cancelletions, donations, government subsidies, and insurance.

==Artistic Directors==
* Andrew Allan (1963–1965)
* Barry Morse (1966)
* Paxton Whitehead (1967–1977)
* Tony Van Bridge (1974 – 1975)
* Leslie Yeo (1979)
* Christopher Newton (1980–2002)
* Jackie Maxwell (2003–2016)
* Tim Carroll (2017–)

==Theatres==

On June 12, 1973, the Shaw Festival opened its first permanent theatre, on the Queen&#x27;s Parade.

Dates listed are when the theatre&#x27;s association with the Shaw Festival began; The Court House and Royal George theatres predate the festival.
* Festival Theatre (1973, 856 seats)
* Royal George Theatre (1980, 305 seats)
* Jackie Maxwell Studio Theatre (2004, 267 seats)

Former venue: Court House Theatre (1962–2017, 327 seats)&quot;

The Royal George Theatre is slated to close at the end of the 2025 Festival season. The building is too costly to maintain and there is not enough space to update the property to meet current accessibility accommodations. With that in mind the Festival board has purchased the two adjacent properties on either side and hopes to build a new theatre in its place, pending funding.

<text>Nathaniel Lee (c. 1653 – 6 May 1692) was an English dramatist. He was the son of Dr Richard Lee, a Presbyterian clergyman who was rector of Hatfield and held many preferments under the Commonwealth; Dr Lee was chaplain to George Monck, afterwards Duke of Albemarle, but after the Restoration he conformed to the Church of England, and withdrew his approval for Charles I&#x27;s execution.

Lee was educated at Westminster School (though some sources say Charterhouse School), and at Trinity College, Cambridge, taking his B.A. degree in 1668. Coming to London, perhaps under the patronage of George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham, he tried to earn his living as an actor, but acute stage fright made this impossible. His earliest play, &quot;Nero, Emperor of Rome&quot;, was acted in 1675 at Drury Lane. Two tragedies written in rhymed heroic couplets, in imitation of John Dryden, followed in 1676: &quot;Sophonisba, or Hannibal&#x27;s Overthrow&quot; and &quot;Gloriana, or the Court of Augustus Caesar&quot;. Both are extravagant in design and treatment.
Lee&#x27;s reputation was made in 1677 with a blank verse tragedy, &quot;The Rival Queens, or the Death of Alexander the Great&quot;. The play, which deals with the jealousy of Alexander&#x27;s first wife, Roxana, for his second wife, Statira, was a favourite on the English stage right up to the days of Edmund Kean. Lee followed this with &quot;Mithridates, King of Pontus&quot; (acted 1678); &quot;Theodosius, or the Force of Love&quot; (acted 1680); and &quot;Caesar Borgia&quot; (acted 1680), an imitation of the worst blood and thunder Elizabethan tragedies. Lee was also named as a collaborator with Dryden in an adaptation of &quot;Oedipus&quot; (1679). &quot;The Princess of Cleve&quot; (1681) is an adaptation of Madame de La Fayette&#x27;s 1678 novel of the same name. &quot;The Massacre of Paris&quot; was written about this time but not published until 1690.

&quot;Lucius Junius Brutus&quot; (acted 1681) gave offence at court. The play was suppressed after its third representation for some lines on Tarquin&#x27;s character that were taken to be a reflection on King Charles II. He therefore joined Dryden in &quot;The Duke of Guise&quot; (1683), a play which directly advocated the Tory point of view. In it part of the Massacre of Paris was incorporated. Lee was now thirty, and had already achieved a considerable reputation. &quot;Constantine the Great&quot; (acted 1683) followed.

He had lived in the dissipated society of John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester, and his associates, and imitated their excesses. As he grew more disreputable, his patrons neglected him, and by 1684 his mind was allegedly completely unhinged. He spent five years in the notorious Bedlam Hospital. He lamented his situation with the following missive: &quot;They called me mad, and I called them mad, and damn them, they outvoted me&quot;. He recovered and was released.

Lee died in a drunken fit in 1692. He was buried on 6 May in St. Clement Danes, Strand.

Lee&#x27;s &quot;Dramatic Works&quot; were published in 1734. In spite of their extravagance, they contain many passages of great beauty. Copies of Lee&#x27;s books remain sought after in bibliographic circles.

<doc id="376595" wikidata="Q2460356" url="?curid=376595" title="Delusional misidentification syndrome">
<text>Delusional misidentification syndrome is an umbrella term, introduced by Christodoulou (in his book &quot;The Delusional Misidentification Syndromes&quot;, Karger, Basel, 1986) for a group of four delusional disorders that occur in the context of mental and neurological illness. They are grouped together as they often occur simultaneously or interchange, and they display the common concept of the double (sosie). They all involve a belief that the identity of a person, object, or place has somehow changed or has been altered. Christodoulu further categorized these disorders into those including hypo (or under)-identification of a well-known person (Capgras delusion), and hyper (or over)-identification of an unknown person (the remaining three). As these delusions typically only concern one particular topic, they also fall under the category called monothematic delusions.

== Variants ==
This psychopathological syndrome is usually considered to include four main variants:
* The Capgras delusion is the belief that (usually) a close relative or spouse has been replaced by an identical-looking impostor.
* The Fregoli delusion is the belief that various people the believer meets are actually the same person in disguise.
* Intermetamorphosis is the belief that an individual has the ability to take the form of another person in both external appearance and internal personality.
* Subjective doubles, described by Christodoulou in 1978 (&quot;American Journal of Psychiatry&quot; 135, 249, 1978), is the belief that there is a doppelgänger or double of themselves carrying out independent actions.

However, similar delusional beliefs, often singularly or more rarely reported, are sometimes also considered to be part of the delusional misidentification syndrome. For example:
* Mirrored-self misidentification is the belief that one&#x27;s reflection in a mirror is some other person.
* Reduplicative paramnesia is the belief that a familiar person, place, object, or body part has been duplicated. For example, a person may believe that they are in fact not in the hospital to which they were admitted, but an identical-looking hospital in a different part of the country.
*Cotard&#x27;s syndrome is a rare disorder in which people hold a delusional belief that they are dead (either figuratively or literally), do not exist, are putrefying, or have lost their blood or internal organs. In rare instances, it can include delusions of immortality.
* Syndrome of delusional companions is the belief that objects (such as soft toys) are sentient beings.
* Clonal pluralization of the self, where a person believes there are multiple copies of themselves, identical both physically and psychologically, but physically separate and distinct.
* Clinical lycanthropy is the belief that one is turning or has turned into an animal. It is considered a delusional misidentification of the self.

There is considerable evidence that disorders such as the Capgras or Fregoli syndromes are associated with disorders of face perception and recognition. However, it has been suggested that all misidentification problems exist on a continuum of anomalies of familiarity, from déjà vu at one end to the formation of delusional beliefs at the other.

<text>Osteoglossomorpha is a group of bony fish in the Teleostei.

==Notable members==
A notable member is the arapaima (&quot;Arapaima gigas&quot;), the largest freshwater fish in South America and one of the largest bony fishes alive. Other notable members include the bizarre freshwater elephantfishes of family Mormyridae.

==Systematics==
Most osteoglossomorph lineages are extinct today. Only the somewhat diverse &quot;bone-tongues&quot; (Osteoglossiformes) and two species of mooneyes (Hiodontiformes) remain.

The ichthyodectiform fishes from the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods were once classified as osteoglossomorphs, but are now generally recognized as stem teleosts.

<text>Lodovico Antonio Muratori (21 October 1672 – 23 January 1750), commonly referred to in Latin as Muratorius, was an Italian Catholic priest, notable as historian and a leading scholar of his age, and for his discovery of the Muratorian fragment, the earliest known list of New Testament books.

==Biography==
Born to a poor family in Vignola, near Modena, he was first instructed by the Jesuits, studied law, philosophy, and theology at the University of Modena, and was ordained a priest in 1694. The following year, he was called to the college of &quot;Dottori&quot; at the Ambrosian Library in Milan, where he immediately started collecting unedited ancient writings of various kinds. His first publication was the &quot;Anecdota Latina ex Ambrosianæ Bibliothecæ codicibus&quot; (2 vols., Milan, 1697–98), followed by two other volumes (Padua, 1713).

Duke Rinaldo I (1700) appointed him archivist and librarian in Modena&#x27;s Ducal library, which position he held until his death in that city. In 1716 Muratori became, in addition, provost of Santa Maria della Pomposa, and conducted this parish until 1733. He continued publishing unedited writings, first among which was a volume, &quot;Anecdota græca&quot; (Padua, 1709). At the same time he cultivated literature, as is shown by his works, &quot;Della perfetta poesia italiana&quot; (Modena, 1706) and &quot;Riflessioni sopra il buon gusto nelle scienze e nelle arti&quot; (Venice, 1708). He even intended to establish something like a general society of Italian literature, and as early as 1703 published for this purpose, under the pseudonym &quot;Lamindo Pritanio&quot;, a plan &quot;Primi disegni della republica letteraria d&#x27;Italia&quot;.
In 1708 a quarrel broke out between the Holy See (aided by the emperor) and the Dukes of Este, over the possession of Comacchio, which involved the sovereignty of the district of Ferrara. Muratori supported the claims of his sovereign and of the house of Este against the pope by means of numerous historical researches, which he later on used in the preparation of a historical work, &quot;Antichità Estensi ed Italiane&quot; (2 vols., Modena: 1st vol., 1717; 2nd vol., 1740). He continued studying the sources for a history of Italy, and as a fruit of his untiring researches there appeared the large work, &quot;Rerum italicarum Scriptores ab anno æræ christianæ 500 ad annum 1500&quot; (Writers on Italy, 500–1500). It was published in twenty-eight folio volumes with the assistance of the &quot;Società Palatina&quot; of Milan (Milan, 1723–51) and the combined efforts of Filippo Argelati and Count Carlo Archinto. An edition was published in the early 20th century in &quot;Città di Castello&quot;.
At the same time Muratori edited a collection of seventy-five essays on different historical themes, entitled &quot;Antiquitates italicæ medii ævi&quot; (6 vols. fols., Milan, 1738–42), as an elucidation and supplement to his work on the sources. In the third volume of this collection there is found the Muratorian Canon which is significant to the history of the New Testament canon. To render these researches accessible to greater masses of his countrymen, he himself published a new edition in Italian, &quot;Dissertazioni sopra le Antichità italiane&quot; (3 vols., Milan, 1751). Other publications of sources are his collections of ancient inscriptions (&quot;Novus thesaurus veterum inscriptionum&quot;, 4 vols., Milan, 1739–42), the fourth volume containing also the ancient Christian inscriptions; and the edition of the Roman Sacramentaries (&quot;Liturgia romana vetus&quot;, 2 vols., Venice, 1748), of value to this day. He wrote a chronological representation of Italian history (&quot;Annali d&#x27;Italia&quot;, 12 vols., quarto, Milan, 1744–49), based upon the numerous sources which he published or which otherwise were known. After his death this work was re-edited and continued (Milan, 1753–56 in 17 vols., new edition in 18 vols., 1818–21).

He also published a work, which attracted considerable attention, on the question as to how far freedom of thinking might go in religious matters, &quot;De ingeniorum moderatione in religionis negotio&quot; (Paris, 1714). Many of his views and opinions were openly challenged; for instance those concerning the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary and the manner of worshipping the saints. Another work, which touches upon religious questions, &quot;Della regolata divozione de&#x27; Cristiani&quot; (Venice, 1747), also came under attack. He defended himself in his work, &quot;De superstitione vitanda&quot; (Milan, 1742). In the quarrel about the ideas of George Hermes, his book, &quot;De ingeniorum moderatione&quot;, was translated into German by Biunde and Braun (Coblenz, 1837) in the interest of the followers of the Hermesian doctrines. In his &quot;Della carità cristiana&quot; (Modena, 1723), he discusses Christian charity.
He still continued his literary studies, as is shown by his works on Petrarch (&quot;Vita e rime di F. Petrarca&quot;, Modena, 1711) and Lodovico Castelvetro (&quot;Vita ed opere di L. Castelvetro&quot;, Milan, 1727). On philosophy he wrote &quot;Filosofia morale esposta&quot; (Venice, 1735), &quot;Delle forze dell&#x27; intendimento umano&quot; (Venice, 1735), and &quot;Delle forze della fantasia&quot; (Venice, 1745). Law and politics are treated in &quot;Governo della Peste politico, medico ed ecclesiastico&quot; (Modena, 1714; frequently reprinted), &quot;Defetti della Giurisprudenza&quot; (1741), &quot;Della pubblica felicità&quot; (1749). He corresponded with a large circle of acquaintances, and a collection of his letters by Antonio Selmi appeared in Modena (1883); another by Ceruti in Modena (1885). In spite of many attacks which he suffered for his religious views, and notwithstanding many of his opinions regarding ecclesiastical politics were not approved of in Rome, he was highly esteemed in high circles of the Catholic Church, as is shown in letters sent to him by Benedict XIV and Cardinal Ganganelli, who later became Clement XIV.

He was also member of the first learned society in lands ruled by the Austrian Habsburgs, the Societas eruditorum incognitorum in terris Austriacis and was publishing in the society&#x27;s journal. His nephew, Giovanni Francesco Soli Muratori (1701-1769) became his uncle Ludovico&#x27;s successor and librarian of the Ducal collections.

In 1950, Italy issued a postage stamp honouring him on the 200th anniversary of his death.

<text>The components of the pixels (primary colors red, green and blue) in an image sensor or display can be ordered in different patterns, called pixel geometry.

The geometric arrangement of the primary colors within a pixel varies depending on usage (see figure 1). In monitors, such as LCDs or CRTs, that typically display edges or rectangles, the components are arranged in vertical stripes.

Knowledge of the pixel geometry used by a display may be used to create raster images of higher apparent resolution using subpixel rendering.

<doc id="376619" wikidata="Q39259" url="?curid=376619" title="Recep Tayyip Erdoğan">
<text>Recep Tayyip Erdoğan (born 26 February 1954) is a Turkish politician who is the 12th and current president of Turkey since 2014. He previously served as the 25th prime minister from 2003 to 2014 as part of the Justice and Development Party (AKP), which he co-founded in 2001. He also served as mayor of Istanbul from 1994 to 1998.

Erdoğan was born in Beyoğlu, Istanbul, and studied at the Aksaray Academy of Economic and Commercial Sciences, before working as a consultant and senior manager in the private sector. Becoming active in local politics, he was elected Welfare Party&#x27;s Beyoğlu district chair in 1984 and Istanbul chair in 1985. Following the 1994 local elections, Erdoğan was elected mayor of Istanbul. In 1998 he was convicted for inciting religious hatred and banned from politics after reciting a poem by Ziya Gökalp that compared mosques to barracks and the faithful to an army. Erdoğan was released from prison in 1999 and formed the AKP, abandoning openly Islamist policies.

Erdoğan led the AKP to a landslide victory in the election for the Grand National Assembly in 2002, and became prime minister after winning a by-election in Siirt in 2003. Erdoğan led the AKP to two more election victories in 2007 and 2011. His tenure consisted of economic recovery from the economic crisis of 2001, the start of EU membership negotiations, and the reduction of military influence on politics. In late 2012, his government began peace negotiations with the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) to end the Kurdish–Turkish conflict, negotiations which ended three years later.

In 2014, Erdoğan became the country&#x27;s first directly elected president. Erdoğan&#x27;s presidency has been marked by democratic backsliding and a shift towards a more authoritarian style of government. His economic policies have led to high inflation rates and the depreciation of the value of the Turkish lira. He has intervened in the ongoing conflicts in Syria and Libya, launched operations against the Islamic State, Syrian Democratic Forces and Assad&#x27;s forces leading to the fall of the Assad regime, and has made threats against Greece. He oversaw the transformation of Turkey&#x27;s parliamentary system into a presidential system, introducing term limits and expanding executive powers, and Turkey&#x27;s migrant crisis. Erdoğan responded to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine by closing the Bosphorus to Russian naval reinforcements, brokering a deal between Russia and Ukraine regarding the export of grain, and mediating a prisoner exchange.

==Early life and education==
Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was born on 26 February 1954 in a poor conservative Muslim family. Erdoğan&#x27;s family is originally from Adjara, a region in Georgia. Although Erdoğan was reported to have said in 2003 that he was of Georgian origin and that his origins were in Batumi, he later denied this. His parents were Ahmet Erdoğan (1905–1988) and Tenzile Erdoğan (née Mutlu; 1924–2011).

While Erdoğan attended school in Istanbul, his summer holidays were mostly spent in Güneysu, Rize, where his family originates from. Throughout his life he often returned to this spiritual home, and in 2015 he opened a vast mosque on a mountaintop near this village. The family returned to Istanbul when Erdoğan was 13 years old.

As a teenager, Erdoğan&#x27;s father provided him with a weekly allowance of 2.5 Turkish lira, less than a dollar. With it, Erdoğan bought postcards and resold them on the street. He sold bottles of water to drivers stuck in traffic. Erdoğan also worked as a street vendor selling simit (sesame bread rings), wearing a white gown and selling the simit from a red three-wheel cart with the rolls stacked behind glass. In his youth, Erdoğan played semi-professional football in Camialtıspor FC, a local club. Fenerbahçe wanted him to transfer to the club but his father prevented it. The stadium of the local football club in the district where he grew up, Kasımpaşa S.K. is named after him.

Erdoğan is a member of the Community of İskenderpaşa, a Turkish Sufistic community of Naqshbandi tariqah.

===Education===
Erdoğan graduated from Kasımpaşa Piyale Primary School in 1965, and the Istanbul İmam Hatip High School, a religious vocational high school, in 1973. The same educational path was followed by other co-founders of the AK Party. One quarter of the curriculum of İmam Hatip schools involves study of the Quran, the life of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, and the Arabic language. Erdoğan studied the Quran at the İmam Hatip, where his classmates began calling him &quot;hoca&quot; (&quot;teacher&quot; or &quot;religious official&quot;).

Erdoğan attended a meeting of the nationalist student group National Turkish Student Union (&quot;Milli Türk Talebe Birliği&quot;), who sought to raise a conservative cohort of young people to counter the rising movement of leftists in Turkey. Within the group, Erdoğan was distinguished by his oratorical skills, developing a penchant for public speaking and excelling in front of an audience. He won first place in a poetry-reading competition organized by the Community of Turkish Technical Painters, and began preparing for speeches through reading and research. Erdoğan would later comment on these competitions as &quot;enhancing our courage to speak in front of the masses&quot;.

Erdoğan wanted to pursue advanced studies at the Ankara University Faculty of Political Science, commonly known as Mülkiye, but only students with regular high school diplomas were eligible to apply, thereby excluding Imam Hatip graduates. Mülkiye was known for its political science department, which trained many statesmen and politicians in Turkey. Erdoğan was then admitted to Eyüp High School, a regular state school. That he eventually received a high school diploma from this school is a subject of debate.

According to his official biography, Erdoğan subsequently studied business administration at the Aksaray School of Economics and Commercial Sciences (), now known as Marmara University&#x27;s Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences. Both the authenticity and status of his degree have been the subject of disputes and controversy over whether the diploma is legitimate and ought to be considered sufficient to make him eligible as a candidate for the presidency.

==Early political career==

In 1976, Erdoğan engaged in politics by joining the National Turkish Student Union, an anti-communist action group. In the same year, he became head of the Beyoğlu youth branch of the Islamist National Salvation Party (MSP), and was later promoted to chair of the Istanbul youth branch. He held this position until the 1980 military coup which dissolved all major political parties. He went on to be a consultant and senior executive in the private sector in the aftermath of the coup.

Three years later, in 1983, Erdoğan followed most of Necmettin Erbakan&#x27;s followers into the newly founded Welfare Party (RP). The new party, like its predecessors subscribed to Erbakan&#x27;s strain of Islamism, the National view. He became the party&#x27;s Beyoğlu district chair in 1984, and head of its Istanbul branch in 1985. Erdoğan entered the parliamentary by-elections of 1986 as a candidate in Istanbul&#x27;s 6th electoral district, but failed to get elected. Three years later, Erdoğan ran for the district mayoralty of Beyoğlu, finishing in second place with 22.8% of the vote.

In the 1991 general election, the Welfare Party more than doubled its share of the vote in Istanbul compared to four years prior, reaching 16.7%. At first, Erdoğan, who led his party&#x27;s district list, was thought to have been elected to parliament. However, as a product of the open-list proportional representation system adopted during the previous term, after all votes expressing a candidate preference were tabulated, it was instead Mustafa Baş who earned the seat allocated to the Welfare Party. A difference of about 4,000 preferential votes separated the two, with Baş&#x27;s ~13,000 to Erdoğan&#x27;s ~9,000.

===Mayor of Istanbul (1994–1998)===
In the local elections of 1994, Erdoğan ran as a candidate for Mayor of Istanbul. He was a young, dark horse candidate in a crowded field. Over the course of the campaign, he was mocked by the mainstream media and treated as a country bumpkin by his opponents. In an upset, he won with 25.19% of the popular vote, making it the first time a mayor of Istanbul got elected from his political party. His win coincided with a wave of Welfare Party victories nationwide, as they won 28 provincial mayoralties - most out of any party - and numerous metropolitan seats, including the capital, Ankara. He said at the time: &quot;Democracy is like a train: when we reach our destination, we get off&quot;. 

Erdoğan governed pragmatically, focusing on bread-and-butter issues. He aimed to tackle the chronic problems plaguing the metropolis, such as water shortage, pollution – waste collection issues in particular – and severely congested traffic. He undertook an infrastructure overhaul: expanding and modernizing the water grid with hundreds of kilometers of new water pipes being laid, and constructing more than fifty bridges, viaducts, and stretches of highway to mitigate traffic. State-of-the-art recycling facilities were built and air pollution was reduced through a plan to switch to natural gas. He changed the public buses to environmentally friendly ones. He took precautions to prevent corruption, using measures to ensure that municipal funds were used prudently. He paid back a major portion of Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality&#x27;s two-billion-dollar debt and invested four billion dollars in the city. He also opened up City Hall to the people, gave out his e-mail address and established municipal hot lines.

Erdoğan initiated the first roundtable of mayors during the Istanbul conference, which led to a global, organized movement of mayors. A seven-member international jury from the United Nations unanimously awarded Erdoğan the UN-Habitat award.

=== Imprisonment ===
In December 1997 in Siirt, Erdoğan recited a modified version of the &quot;Soldier&#x27;s prayer&quot; poem written by Ziya Gökalp, a pan-Turkish activist of the early 20th century. This version included an additional stanza in the beginning, its first two verses reading &quot;The mosques are our barracks, the domes our helmets / The minarets our bayonets and the faithful our soldiers...&quot; Under article 312/2 of the Turkish penal code his recitation was regarded by the judge as an incitement to violence and religious or racial hatred. In his defense, Erdoğan said that the poem was published in state-approved books. How this version of the poem ended up in a book published by the Turkish Standards Institution remained a topic of discussion.

Erdoğan was given a ten-month prison sentence. He was forced to give up his mayoral position due to his conviction. The conviction also stipulated a political ban, which prevented him from participating in elections. He had appealed for the sentence to be converted to a monetary fine, but it was reduced to four months instead (24 March 1999 to 27 July 1999).

He was transferred to Pınarhisar prison in Kırklareli. The day Erdoğan went to prison, he released an album called &quot;This Song Doesn&#x27;t End Here&quot;. The album features a tracklist of seven poems and became the best-selling album of Turkey in 1999, selling over one million copies. In 2013, Erdoğan visited the Pınarhisar prison again for the first time in fourteen years. After the visit, he said &quot;For me, Pınarhisar is a symbol of rebirth, where we prepared the establishment of the Justice and Development Party&quot;.

=== Justice and Development Party ===
Erdoğan was member of political parties that kept getting banned by the army or judges. Within his Virtue Party, there was a dispute about the appropriate discourse of the party between traditional politicians and pro-reform politicians. The latter envisioned a party that could operate within the limits of the system, and thus not getting banned as its predecessors like National Order Party, National Salvation Party and Welfare Party. They wanted to give the group the character of an ordinary conservative party with its members being Muslim Democrats following the example of the Europe&#x27;s Christian Democrats.

When the Virtue Party was also banned in 2001, a definitive split took place: the followers of Necmettin Erbakan founded the Felicity Party (SP) and the reformers founded the Justice and Development Party (AKP) under the leadership of Abdullah Gül and Erdoğan. The pro-reform politicians realized that a strictly Islamic party would never be accepted as a governing party by the state apparatus and they believed that an Islamic party did not appeal to more than about 20 percent of the Turkish electorate. The AK party emphatically placed itself as a broad democratic conservative party with new politicians from the political center (like Ali Babacan and Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu), while respecting Islamic norms and values, but without an explicit religious program. This turned out to be successful as the new party won 34% of the vote in the general elections of 2002. Erdoğan became prime minister in March 2003 after the Gül government ended his political ban.

==Premiership==

=== General elections ===
The elections of 2002 were the first elections in which Erdoğan participated as a party leader. All parties previously elected to parliament failed to win enough votes to re-enter the parliament. The AKP won 34.3% of the national vote and formed the new government. Turkish stocks rose more than 7% on Monday morning. Politicians of the previous generation, such as Ecevit, Bahceli, Yılmaz and Çiller, resigned. The second largest party, the CHP, received 19.4% of the votes. The AKP won a landslide victory in the parliament, taking nearly two-thirds of the seats. Erdoğan could not become Prime Minister as he was still banned from politics by the judiciary for his speech in Siirt. Gül became the Prime Minister instead. In December 2002, the Supreme Election Board canceled the general election results from Siirt due to voting irregularities and scheduled a new election for 9 February 2003. By this time, party leader Erdoğan was able to run for parliament due to a legal change made possible by the opposition Republican People&#x27;s Party. The AKP duly listed Erdoğan as a candidate for the rescheduled election, which he won, becoming Prime Minister after Gül handed over the post.

On 14 April 2007, an estimated 300,000 people marched in Ankara to protest against the possible candidacy of Erdoğan in the 2007 presidential election, afraid that if elected as president, he would alter the secular nature of the Turkish state. Erdoğan announced on 24 April 2007 that the party had nominated Abdullah Gül as the AKP candidate in the presidential election. The protests continued over the next several weeks, with over one million people reported to have turned out at a 29 April rally in Istanbul, tens of thousands at separate protests on 4 May in Manisa and Çanakkale, and one million in İzmir on 13 May.

The stage of the elections of 2007 was set for a fight for legitimacy in the eyes of voters between his government and the CHP. Erdoğan used the event that took place during the ill-fated Presidential elections a few months earlier as a part of the general election campaign of his party. On 22 July 2007, the AKP won an important victory over the opposition, garnering 46.7% of the popular vote. 22 July elections marked only the second time in the Republic of Turkey&#x27;s history whereby an incumbent governing party won an election by increasing its share of popular support. On 14 March 2008, Turkey&#x27;s Chief Prosecutor asked the country&#x27;s Constitutional Court to ban Erdoğan&#x27;s governing party. The party escaped a ban on 30 July 2008, a year after winning 46.7% of the vote in national elections, although judges did cut the party&#x27;s public funding by 50%.

In the June 2011 elections, Erdoğan&#x27;s governing party won 327 seats (49.83% of the popular vote) making Erdoğan the only prime minister in Turkey&#x27;s history to win three consecutive general elections, each time receiving more votes than the previous election. The second party, the Republican People&#x27;s Party (CHP), received 135 seats (25.94%), the nationalist MHP received 53 seats (13.01%), and the Independents received 35 seats (6.58%).

A US$100 billion corruption scandal in 2013 led to the arrests of Erdoğan&#x27;s close allies, and incriminated Erdoğan.

=== Referendums ===
After the opposition parties deadlocked the 2007 presidential election by boycotting the parliament, the ruling AKP proposed a constitutional reform package. The reform package was first vetoed by President Ahmet Necdet Sezer. Then he applied to the Turkish constitutional court about the reform package, because the president is unable to veto amendments for the second time. The Turkish constitutional court did not find any problems in the packet and 68.95% of the voters supported the constitutional changes. The reforms consisted of electing the president by popular vote instead of by parliament; reducing the presidential term from seven years to five; allowing the president to stand for re-election for a second term; holding general elections every four years instead of five; and reducing from 367 to 184 the quorum of lawmakers needed for parliamentary decisions.

Reforming the Constitution was one of the main pledges of the AKP during the 2007 election campaign. The main opposition party CHP was not interested in altering the Constitution on a big scale, making it impossible to form a Constitutional Commission (&quot;Anayasa Uzlaşma Komisyonu&quot;). The amendments lacked the two-thirds majority needed to become law instantly, but secured 336 votes in the 550-seat parliament – enough to put the proposals to a referendum. The reform package included a number of issues such as the right of individuals to appeal to the highest court, the creation of the ombudsman&#x27;s office; the possibility to negotiate a nationwide labour contract; gender equality; the ability of civilian courts to convict members of the military; the right of civil servants to go on strike; a privacy law; and the structure of the Constitutional Court. The referendum was agreed by a majority of 58%.

=== Domestic policy ===
==== Kurdish issue ====

In 2009, Prime Minister Erdoğan&#x27;s government announced a plan to help end the quarter-century-long Turkey–Kurdistan Workers&#x27; Party conflict that had cost more than 40,000 lives. The government&#x27;s plan, supported by the European Union, intended to allow the Kurdish language to be used in all broadcast media and political campaigns, and restored Kurdish names to cities and towns that had been given Turkish ones. Erdoğan said, &quot;We took a courageous step to resolve chronic issues that constitute an obstacle along Turkey&#x27;s development, progression and empowerment.&quot; Erdoğan passed a partial amnesty to reduce penalties faced by many members of the Kurdish guerrilla movement PKK who had surrendered to the government. On 23 November 2011, during a televised meeting of his party in Ankara, he apologized on behalf of the state for the Dersim massacre, where many Alevis and Zazas were killed. In 2013 the government of Erdoğan began a peace process between the Kurdistan Workers&#x27; Party (PKK) and the Turkish Government, mediated by parliamentarians of the Peoples&#x27; Democratic party (HDP).

In 2015, following AKP electoral defeat, the rise of a social democrat, pro-Kurdish rights opposition party, and the minor Ceylanpınar incident, he decided that the peace process was over and supported the revocation of the parliamentary immunity of the HDP parliamentarians. Violent confrontation resumed in 2015–2017, mainly in the South East of Turkey, resulting in higher death tolls and several external operations on the part of the Turkish military. Representatives and elected HDP have been systematically arrested, removed, and replaced in their offices, this tendency being confirmed after the 2016 Turkish coup attempt and the following purges. Six thousand additional deaths occurred in Turkey alone for 2015–2022. Yet, as of 2022 the intensity of the PKK-Turkey conflict did decrease in recent years. In the previous decade, Erdoğan and the AKP government used anti-PKK, martial rhetoric and external operations to raise Turkish nationalist votes before elections.

==== Armenian genocide ====
Erdoğan has said multiple times that Turkey would acknowledge the mass killings of Armenians during World War I as genocide only after a thorough investigation by a joint Turkish-Armenian commission consisting of historians, archaeologists, political scientists and other experts. In 2005, Erdoğan and the main opposition party leader Deniz Baykal wrote a letter to President of Armenia Robert Kocharyan, proposing the creation of a joint Turkish-Armenian commission. Armenian Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian rejected the offer because he asserted that the proposal itself was &quot;insincere and not serious&quot;. He added: &quot;This issue cannot be considered at historical level with Turks, who themselves politicized the problem.&quot;

In December 2008, Erdoğan criticized the I Apologize campaign by Turkish intellectuals to recognize the Armenian genocide, saying, &quot;I neither accept nor support this campaign. We did not commit a crime, therefore we do not need to apologise ... It will not have any benefit other than stirring up trouble, disturbing our peace and undoing the steps which have been taken.&quot;
In 2011, Erdoğan ordered the tearing-down of the &quot;Monument to Humanity&quot;, a Turkish–Armenian friendship monument in Kars, which was commissioned in 2006 and represented a metaphor of the rapprochement of the two countries after many years of dispute over the events of 1915. Erdoğan justified the removal by stating that the monument was offensively close to the tomb of an 11th-century Islamic scholar, and that its shadow ruined the view of that site, while Kars municipality officials said it was illegally erected in a protected area. However, the former mayor of Kars who approved the original construction of the monument said the municipality was destroying not just a &quot;monument to humanity&quot; but &quot;humanity itself&quot;. The demolition was not unopposed; among its detractors were several Turkish artists. Two of them, the painter Bedri Baykam and his associate, Pyramid Art Gallery general coordinator Tugba Kurtulmus, were stabbed after a meeting with other artists at the Istanbul Akatlar cultural center.

On 23 April 2014, Erdoğan&#x27;s office issued a statement in nine languages (including two dialects of Armenian), offering condolences for the mass killings of Armenians and stating that the events of 1915 had inhumane consequences. The statement described the mass killings as the two nations&#x27; shared pain and said: &quot;Having experienced events which had inhumane consequences – such as relocation – during the First World War, (it) should not prevent Turks and Armenians from establishing compassion and mutually humane attitudes among one another.&quot;

Pope Francis in April 2015, at a special mass in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica marking the centenary of the events, described atrocities against Armenian civilians in 1915–1922 as &quot;the first genocide of the 20th century&quot;. In protest, Erdoğan recalled the Turkish ambassador from the Vatican, and summoned the Vatican&#x27;s ambassador, to express &quot;disappointment&quot; at what he called a discriminatory message. He later stated &quot;we don&#x27;t carry a stain or a shadow like genocide&quot;. US President Barack Obama called for a &quot;full, frank and just acknowledgement of the facts&quot;, but again stopped short of labelling it &quot;genocide&quot;, despite his campaign promise to do so.

==== Human rights ====
During Erdoğan&#x27;s time as Prime Minister, the far-reaching powers of the 1991 Anti-Terror Law were reduced. In 2004, the death penalty was abolished for all circumstances. The Democratic initiative process was initiated, with the goal to improve democratic standards in general and the rights of ethnic and religious minorities in particular. In 2012, the Human Rights and Equality Institution of Turkey and the Ombudsman Institution were established. The UN Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture was ratified. Children are no longer prosecuted under terrorism legislation. The Jewish community were allowed to celebrate Hanukkah publicly for the first time in modern Turkish history in 2015. The Turkish government approved a law in 2008 to return properties confiscated in the past by the state to non-Muslim foundations. It also paved the way for the free allocation of worship places such as synagogues and churches to non-Muslim foundations. However, European officials noted a return to more authoritarian ways after the stalling of Turkey&#x27;s bid to join the European Union notably on freedom of speech, freedom of the press and Kurdish minority rights. Demands by activists for the recognition of LGBT rights were publicly rejected by government members.

Reporters Without Borders reported a continuous decrease in Freedom of the Press during Erdoğan&#x27;s later terms, with a rank of around 100 on its Press Freedom Index during his first term and a rank of 153 out of a total of 179 countries in 2021. Freedom House reported a slight recovery in later years and awarded Turkey a Press Freedom Score of 55/100 in 2012 after a low point of 48/100 in 2006.

In 2011, Erdoğan&#x27;s government made legal reforms to return properties of Christian and Jewish minorities which were seized by the Turkish government in the 1930s. The total value of the properties returned reached $2 billion (USD).

Under Erdoğan, the Turkish government tightened the laws on the sale and consumption of alcohol, banning all advertising and increasing the tax on alcoholic beverages.

==== Economy ====

In 2002, Erdoğan inherited a Turkish economy that was beginning to recover from a recession as a result of reforms implemented by Kemal Derviş. Erdoğan supported Finance Minister Ali Babacan in enforcing macro-economic policies. Erdoğan tried to attract more foreign investors to Turkey and lifted many government regulations. The cash-flow into the Turkish economy between 2002 and 2012 caused a growth of 64% in real GDP and a 43% increase in GDP per capita; considerably higher numbers were commonly advertised but these did not account for the inflation of the US dollar between 2002 and 2012. The average annual growth in GDP per capita was 3.6%. The growth in real GDP between 2002 and 2012 was higher than the values from developed countries, but was close to average when developing countries are also taken into account. The ranking of the Turkish economy in terms of GDP moved slightly from 17 to 16 during this decade. A major consequence of the policies between 2002 and 2012 was the widening of the current account deficit from US$600 million to US$58 billion (2013 est.)

Since 1961, Turkey has signed 19 IMF loan accords. Erdoğan&#x27;s government satisfied the budgetary and market requirements of the two during his administration and received every loan installment, the only time any Turkish government has done so. Erdoğan inherited a debt of $23.5 billion to the IMF, which was reduced to $0.9 billion in 2012. He decided not to sign a new deal. Turkey&#x27;s debt to the IMF was thus declared to be completely paid and he announced that the IMF could borrow from Turkey. In 2010, five-year credit default swaps for Turkey&#x27;s sovereign debt were trading at a record low of 1.17%, below those of nine EU member countries and Russia. In 2002, the Turkish Central Bank had $26.5 billion in reserves. This amount reached $92.2 billion in 2011. During Erdoğan&#x27;s leadership, inflation fell from 32% to 9.0% in 2004. Since then, Turkish inflation has continued to fluctuate around 9% and is still one of the highest inflation rates in the world. The Turkish public debt as a percentage of annual GDP declined from 74% in 2002 to 39% in 2009. In 2012, Turkey had a lower ratio of public debt to GDP than 21 of 27 members of the European Union and a lower budget deficit to GDP ratio than 23 of them.

In 2003, Erdoğan&#x27;s government pushed through the Labor Act, a comprehensive reform of Turkey&#x27;s labor laws. The law greatly expanded the rights of employees, establishing a 45-hour workweek and limiting overtime work to 270 hours a year, provided legal protection against discrimination due to sex, religion, or political affiliation, prohibited discrimination between permanent and temporary workers, entitled employees terminated without &quot;valid cause&quot; to compensation, and mandated written contracts for employment arrangements lasting a year or more.

==== Education ====
Erdoğan increased the budget of the Ministry of Education from 7.5 billion lira in 2002 to 34 billion lira in 2011, the highest share of the national budget given to one ministry. Before his prime ministership the military received the highest share of the national budget. Compulsory education was increased from eight years to twelve. In 2003, the Turkish government, together with UNICEF, initiated a campaign called &quot;Come on girls, [let&#x27;s go] to school!&quot; (). The goal of this campaign was to close the gender gap in primary school enrollment through the provision of a quality basic education for all girls, especially in southeast Turkey.

In 2005, the parliament granted amnesty to students expelled from universities before 2003. The amnesty applied to students dismissed on academic or disciplinary grounds. In 2004, textbooks became free of charge and since 2008 every province in Turkey has its own university. During Erdoğan&#x27;s Premiership, the number of universities in Turkey nearly doubled, from 98 in 2002 to 186 in October 2012.

The Prime Minister kept his campaign promises by starting the Fatih project in which all state schools, from preschool to high school level, received a total of 620,000 smart boards, while tablet computers were distributed to 17 million students and approximately one million teachers and administrators.

In June 2017 a draft proposal by the ministry of education was approved by Erdoğan, in which the curriculum for schools excluded the teaching of the theory of evolution of Charles Darwin by 2019. From then on the teaching will be postponed and start at undergraduate level.

==== Infrastructure ====
Under Erdoğan&#x27;s government, the number of airports in Turkey increased from 26 to 50 in the period of 10 years. Between the founding of the Republic of Turkey in 1923 and 2002, there had been 6,000 km of dual carriageway roads created. Between 2002 and 2011, another 13,500 km of expressway were built. Due to these measures, the number of motor accidents fell by 50 percent. For the first time in Turkish history, high speed railway lines were constructed, and the country&#x27;s high-speed train service began in 2009. In 8 years, 1,076 km of railway were built and 5,449 km of railway renewed. The construction of Marmaray, an undersea rail tunnel under the Bosphorus strait, started in 2004. It was inaugurated on the 90th anniversary of the Turkish Republic 29 October 2013. The inauguration of the Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge, the third bridge over the Bosphorus, was on 26 August 2016.

==== Justice ====
In March 2006, the Supreme Board of Judges and Prosecutors (HSYK) held a press conference to publicly protest the obstruction of the appointment of judges to the high courts for over 10 months. The HSYK said Erdoğan wanted to fill the vacant posts with his own appointees. Erdoğan was accused of creating a rift with Turkey&#x27;s highest court of appeal, the &quot;Yargıtay&quot;, and high administrative court, the &quot;Danıştay&quot;. Erdoğan stated that the constitution gave the power to assign these posts to his elected party.

In May 2007, the head of Turkey&#x27;s High Court asked prosecutors to consider whether Erdoğan should be charged over critical comments regarding the election of Abdullah Gül as president. Erdoğan said the ruling was &quot;a disgrace to the justice system&quot;, and criticized the Constitutional Court which had invalidated a presidential vote because a boycott by other parties meant there was no quorum. Prosecutors investigated his earlier comments, including saying it had fired a &quot;bullet at democracy&quot;. Tülay Tuğcu, head of the Constitutional Court, condemned Erdoğan for &quot;threats, insults and hostility&quot; towards the justice system.

==== Civil–military relations ====

The Turkish military has had a record of intervening in politics, having removed elected governments four times in the past. During the Erdoğan government, civil–military relationship moved towards normalization in which the influence of the military in politics was significantly reduced. The ruling Justice and Development Party has often faced off against the military, gaining political power by challenging a pillar of the country&#x27;s laicistic establishment.

The most significant issue that caused deep fissures between the army and the government was the midnight e-memorandum posted on the military&#x27;s website objecting to the selection of Foreign Minister Abdullah Gül as the ruling party&#x27;s candidate for the Presidency in 2007. The military argued that the election of Gül, whose wife wears an Islamic headscarf, could undermine the laicistic order of the country. Contrary to expectations, the government responded harshly to former Chief of General Staff Gen. Yaşar Büyükanıt&#x27;s e-memorandum, stating the military had nothing to do with the selection of the presidential candidate.

==== Health care ====
After assuming power in 2003, Erdoğan&#x27;s government embarked on a sweeping reform program of the Turkish healthcare system, called the Health Transformation Program (HTP), to greatly increase the quality of healthcare and protect all citizens from financial risks. Its introduction coincided with the period of sustained economic growth, allowing the Turkish government to put greater investments into the healthcare system. As part of the reforms, the &quot;Green Card&quot; program, which provides health benefits to the poor, was expanded in 2004. The reform program aimed at increasing the ratio of private to state-run healthcare, which, along with long queues in state-run hospitals, resulted in the rise of private medical care in Turkey, forcing state-run hospitals to compete by increasing quality.

In April 2006, Erdoğan unveiled a social security reform package demanded by the International Monetary Fund under a loan deal. The move, which Erdoğan called one of the most radical reforms ever, was passed with fierce opposition. Turkey&#x27;s three social security bodies were united under one roof, bringing equal health services and retirement benefits for members of all three bodies. The previous system had been criticized for reserving the best healthcare for civil servants and relegating others to wait in long queues. Under the second bill, everyone under the age of 18 years was entitled to free health services, irrespective of whether they pay premiums to any social security organization. The bill also envisages a gradual increase in the retirement age: starting from 2036, the retirement age will increase to 65 by 2048 for both women and men.

In January 2008, the Turkish Parliament adopted a law to prohibit smoking in most public places. Erdoğan is outspokenly anti-smoking.

=== Foreign policy ===

Turkish foreign policy during Erdoğan&#x27;s tenure as prime minister has been associated with the name of Ahmet Davutoğlu. Davutoğlu was the chief foreign policy advisor of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan before he was appointed foreign minister in 2009. The basis of Erdoğan&#x27;s foreign policy is based on the principle of &quot;don&#x27;t make enemies, make friends&quot; and the pursuit of &quot;zero problems&quot; with neighboring countries.

Erdoğan is co-founder of United Nations Alliance of Civilizations (AOC). The initiative seeks to galvanize international action against extremism through the forging of international, intercultural and inter-religious dialogue and cooperation.

==== European Union ====
When Erdoğan came to power, he continued Turkey&#x27;s long ambition of joining the European Union. Turkey, under Erdoğan, made many strides in its laws that would qualify for EU membership. On 3 October 2005 negotiations began for Turkey&#x27;s accession to the European Union. Erdoğan was named &quot;The European of the Year 2004&quot; by the newspaper European Voice for the reforms in his country in order to accomplish the accession of Turkey to the European Union. He said in a comment that &quot;Turkey&#x27;s accession shows that Europe is a continent where civilisations reconcile and not clash.&quot; On 3 October 2005, the negotiations for Turkey&#x27;s accession to the EU formally started during Erdoğan&#x27;s tenure as Prime Minister.

The European Commission generally supports Erdoğan&#x27;s reforms, but it remains critical of his policies. Negotiations about a possible EU membership came to a standstill in 2009 and 2010, when Turkish ports were closed to Cypriot ships. The Turkish government continues its refusal to recognize EU member state Cyprus.

==== Greece and Cyprus dispute ====

Relations between Greece and Turkey were normalized during Erdoğan&#x27;s tenure as prime minister. In May 2004, Erdoğan became the first Turkish Prime Minister to visit Greece since 1988, and the first to visit the Turkish minority of Thrace since 1952. In 2007, Erdoğan and Greek Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis inaugurated the Greek-Turkish natural gas pipeline giving Caspian gas its first direct Western outlet.
Turkey and Greece signed an agreement to create a Combined Joint Operational Unit within the framework of NATO to participate in Peace Support Operations.
Erdoğan and his party strongly supported the EU-backed referendum to reunify Cyprus in 2004. Negotiations about a possible EU membership came to a standstill in 2009 and 2010, when Turkish ports were closed to Cypriot ships as a consequence of the economic isolation of the internationally unrecognized Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and the failure of the EU to end the isolation, as it had promised in 2004. The Turkish government continues its refusal to recognize the Republic of Cyprus.

==== Armenia ====

Armenia is Turkey&#x27;s only neighbor which Erdoğan has not visited during his premiership. The Turkish-Armenian border has been closed since 1993 because of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict with Turkey&#x27;s close ally Azerbaijan.

Diplomatic efforts resulted in the signing of protocols between Turkish and Armenian Foreign Ministers in Switzerland to improve relations between the two countries. One of the points of the agreement was the creation of a joint commission on the issue. The Armenian Constitutional Court decided that the commission contradicts the Armenian constitution. Turkey responded saying that Armenian court&#x27;s ruling on the protocols is not acceptable, resulting in a suspension of the rectification process by the Turkish side.

Erdoğan has said that Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan should apologize for calling on school children to re-occupy eastern Turkey. When asked by a student at a literature contest ceremony if Armenians will be able to get back their &quot;western territories&quot; along with Mt. Ararat, Sarksyan said, &quot;This is the task of your generation&quot;.

==== Russia ====

In December 2004, President Putin visited Turkey, making it the first presidential visit in the history of Turkish-Russian relations besides that of the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, Nikolai Podgorny in 1972. In November 2005, Putin attended the inauguration of a jointly constructed Blue Stream natural gas pipeline in Turkey. This sequence of top-level visits has brought several important bilateral issues to the forefront. The two countries consider it their strategic goal to achieve &quot;multidimensional co-operation&quot;, especially in the fields of energy, transport and the military. Specifically, Russia aims to invest in Turkey&#x27;s fuel and energy industries, and it also expects to participate in tenders for the modernization of Turkey&#x27;s military. The relations during this time are described by President Medvedev as &quot;Turkey is one of our most important partners with respect to regional and international issues. We can confidently say that Russian-Turkish relations have advanced to the level of a multidimensional strategic partnership&quot;.

In May 2010, Turkey and Russia signed 17 agreements to enhance cooperation in energy and other fields, including pacts to build Turkey&#x27;s first nuclear power plant and further plans for an oil pipeline from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean Sea. The leaders of both countries also signed an agreement on visa-free travel, enabling tourists to get into the other country for free and stay there for up to 30 days.

==== United States ====

When Barack Obama became President of United States, he made his first overseas bilateral meeting to Turkey in April 2009.

At a joint news conference in Turkey, Obama said: &quot;I&#x27;m trying to make a statement about the importance of Turkey, not just to the United States but to the world. I think that where there&#x27;s the most promise of building stronger U.S.-Turkish relations is in the recognition that Turkey and the United States can build a model partnership in which a predominantly Christian nation, a predominantly Muslim nation – a Western nation and a nation that straddles two continents,&quot; he continued, &quot;that we can create a modern international community that is respectful, that is secure, that is prosperous, that there are not tensions – inevitable tensions between cultures – which I think is extraordinarily important.&quot;

==== Iraq ====

Turkey under Erdoğan was named by the Bush Administration as a part of the &quot;coalition of the willing&quot; that was central to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. On 1 March 2003, a motion allowing Turkish military to participate in the U.S.-led coalition&#x27;s invasion of Iraq, along with the permission for foreign troops to be stationed in Turkey for this purpose, was overruled by the Turkish Parliament.

After the fall of Saddam Hussein, Iraq and Turkey signed 48 trade agreements on issues including security, energy, and water. The Turkish government attempted to mend relations with Iraqi Kurdistan by opening a Turkish university in Erbil, and a Turkish consulate in Mosul. Erdoğan&#x27;s government fostered economic and political relations with Irbil, and Turkey began to consider the Kurdistan Regional Government in northern Iraq as an ally against Maliki&#x27;s government.

==== Israel ====

Erdoğan visited Israel on 1 May 2005, a gesture unusual for a leader of a Muslim majority country. During his trip, Erdoğan visited the Yad Vashem, Israel&#x27;s official memorial to the victims of the Holocaust. The President of Israel Shimon Peres addressed the Turkish parliament during a visit in 2007, the first time an Israeli leader had addressed the legislature of a predominantly Muslim nation.

Their relationship worsened at the 2009 World Economic Forum conference over Israel&#x27;s actions during the Gaza War. Erdoğan was interrupted by the moderator while he was responding to Peres. Erdoğan stated: &quot;Mister Peres, you are older than I am. Maybe you are feeling guilty and that is why you are raising your voice. When it comes to killing you know it too well. I remember how you killed the children on beaches...&quot; Upon the moderator&#x27;s reminder that they needed to adjourn for dinner, Erdoğan left the panel, accusing the moderator of giving Peres more time than all the other panelists combined.

Tensions increased further following the Gaza flotilla raid in May 2010. Erdoğan strongly condemned the raid, describing it as &quot;state terrorism&quot;, and demanded an Israeli apology. In February 2013, Erdoğan called Zionism a &quot;crime against humanity&quot;, comparing it to Islamophobia, antisemitism, and fascism. He later retracted the statement, saying he had been misinterpreted. He said &quot;everyone should know&quot; that his comments were directed at &quot;Israeli policies&quot;, especially as regards to &quot;Gaza and the settlements&quot;. Erdoğan&#x27;s statements were criticized by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, among others. In August 2013, the &quot;Hürriyet&quot; reported that Erdoğan had claimed to have evidence of Israel&#x27;s responsibility for the removal of Morsi from office in Egypt. The Israeli and Egyptian governments dismissed the suggestion.

In response to the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict, Erdoğan accused Israel of conducting &quot;state terrorism&quot; and a &quot;genocide attempt&quot; against the Palestinians. He also stated that &quot;If Israel continues with this attitude, it will definitely be tried at international courts.&quot;

==== Syria ====


During Erdoğan&#x27;s term of office, diplomatic relations between Turkey and Syria significantly deteriorated. In 2004, President Bashar al-Assad arrived in Turkey for the first official visit by a Syrian President in 57 years. In late 2004, Erdoğan signed a free trade agreement with Syria. Visa restrictions between the two countries were lifted in 2009, which caused an economic boom in the regions near the Syrian border. However, in 2011 the relationship between the two countries was strained following the outbreak of conflict in Syria. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said he was trying to &quot;cultivate a favorable relationship with whatever government would take the place of Assad&quot;. However, he began to support the opposition in Syria, after demonstrations turned violent, creating a serious Syrian refugee problem in Turkey. Erdoğan&#x27;s policy of providing military training for anti-Damascus fighters has also created conflict with Syria&#x27;s ally and a neighbour of Turkey, Iran.

==== Saudi Arabia ====
In August 2006, King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz as-Saud made a visit to Turkey. This was the first visit by a Saudi monarch to Turkey in the last four decades. The monarch made a second visit, on 9 November 2007. Turk-Saudi trade volume has exceeded 3.2 billion in 2006, almost double the figure achieved in 2003. In 2009, this amount reached 5.5 billion and the goal for the year 2010 was 10 billion.

Erdoğan condemned the Saudi-led intervention in Bahrain and characterized the Saudi movement as &quot;a new Karbala&quot;. He demanded withdrawal of Saudi forces from Bahrain.

==== Egypt ====

Erdoğan had made his first official visit to Egypt on 12 September 2011, accompanied by six ministers and 200 businessmen. This visit was made very soon after Turkey had ejected Israeli ambassadors, cutting off all diplomatic relations with Israel because Israel refused to apologize for the Gaza flotilla raid which killed eight Turkish and one Turco-American.

Erdoğan&#x27;s visit to Egypt was met with much enthusiasm by Egyptians. CNN reported some Egyptians saying &quot;We consider him as the Islamic leader in the Middle East&quot;, while others were appreciative of his role in supporting Gaza. Erdoğan was later honoured in Tahrir Square by members of the Egyptian Revolution Youth Union, and members of the Turkish embassy were presented with a coat of arms in acknowledgment of the Prime Minister&#x27;s support of the Egyptian Revolution.

Erdoğan stated in a 2011 interview that he supported secularism for Egypt, which generated an angry reaction among Islamic movements, especially the Freedom and Justice Party, which was the political wing of the Muslim Brotherhood. However, commentators suggest that by forming an alliance with the military junta during Egypt&#x27;s transition to democracy, Erdoğan may have tipped the balance in favor of an authoritarian government.

Erdoğan condemned the sit-in dispersals conducted by Egyptian police on 14 August 2013 at the Rabaa al-Adawiya and al-Nahda squares, where violent clashes between police officers and pro-Morsi Islamist protesters led to hundreds of deaths, mostly protesters. In July 2014, one year after the removal of Mohamed Morsi from office, Erdoğan described Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi as an &quot;illegitimate tyrant&quot;.

==== Somalia ====

Erdoğan&#x27;s administration maintains strong ties with the Somali government. During the drought of 2011, Erdoğan&#x27;s government contributed over $201 million to humanitarian relief efforts in the impacted parts of Somalia. Following a greatly improved security situation in Mogadishu in mid-2011, the Turkish government also re-opened its foreign embassy with the intention of more effectively assisting in the post-conflict development process. It was among the first foreign governments to resume formal diplomatic relations with Somalia after the civil war.

In May 2010, the Turkish and Somali governments signed a military training agreement, in keeping with the provisions outlined in the Djibouti Peace Process. Turkish Airlines became the first long-distance international commercial airline in two decades to resume flights to and from Mogadishu&#x27;s Aden Adde International Airport. Turkey also launched various development and infrastructure projects in Somalia including building several hospitals and helping renovate the National Assembly building.

=== Protests ===

The 2013 Gezi Park protests were held against the perceived authoritarianism of Erdoğan and his policies, starting from a small sit-in in Istanbul in defense of a city park. After the police&#x27;s intense reaction with tear gas, the protests grew each day. Faced by the largest mass protest in a decade, Erdoğan made this controversial remark in a televised speech: &quot;The police were there yesterday, they are there today, and they will be there tomorrow&quot;. After weeks of clashes in the streets of Istanbul, his government at first apologized to the protestors and called for a plebiscite, but then ordered a crackdown on the protesters.

==Presidency==

Erdoğan took the oath of office on 28 August 2014 and became the 12th president of Turkey. He administered the new Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu&#x27;s oath on 29 August. When asked about his lower-than-expected 51.79% share of the vote, he allegedly responded, &quot;there were even those who did not like the Prophet. I, however, won 52%&quot;. Assuming the role of President, Erdoğan was criticized for openly stating that he would not maintain the tradition of presidential neutrality. Erdoğan has also stated his intention to pursue a more active role as president, such as utilizing the President&#x27;s rarely used cabinet-calling powers. The political opposition has argued that Erdoğan will continue to pursue his own political agenda, controlling the government, while his new Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu would be docile and submissive. Furthermore, the domination of loyal Erdoğan supporters in Davutoğlu&#x27;s cabinet fuelled speculation that Erdoğan intended to exercise substantial control over the government.

=== Presidential elections ===

On 1 July 2014, Erdoğan was named the AKP&#x27;s presidential candidate in the Turkish presidential election. His candidacy was announced by the Deputy President of the AKP, Mehmet Ali Şahin.

Erdoğan made a speech after the announcement and used the &#x27;Erdoğan logo&#x27; for the first time. The logo was criticized because it was very similar to the logo that U.S. President Barack Obama used in the 2008 presidential election.

Erdoğan was elected as the President of Turkey in the first round of the election with 51.79% of the vote, obviating the need for a run-off by winning over 50%. The joint candidate of the CHP, MHP and 13 other opposition parties, former Organisation of Islamic Co-operation general secretary Ekmeleddin İhsanoğlu won 38.44% of the vote. The pro-Kurdish HDP candidate Selahattin Demirtaş won 9.76%.

The 2018 Turkish presidential election took place as part of the 2018 general election, alongside parliamentary elections on the same day. Following the approval of constitutional changes in a referendum held in 2017, the elected President will be both the head of state and head of government of Turkey, taking over the latter role from the to-be-abolished office of the Prime Minister.

Incumbent president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan declared his candidacy for the People&#x27;s Alliance (Turkish: &quot;Cumhur İttifakı&quot;) on 27 April 2018, being supported by the MHP. Erdoğan&#x27;s main opposition, the Republican People&#x27;s Party, nominated Muharrem İnce, a member of the parliament known for his combative opposition and spirited speeches against Erdoğan. Besides these candidates, Meral Akşener, the founder and leader of Good Party, Temel Karamollaoğlu, the leader of the Felicity Party and Doğu Perinçek, the leader of the Patriotic Party, have announced their candidacies and collected the 100,000 signatures required for nomination. The alliance which Erdoğan was candidate for won 52.59% of the popular vote.

For the presidential election 2023 his candidacy is in dispute as he has launched his campaign in June 2022, but the opposition contends a third presidential term would violate the constitution. During the first round of ballots in the 2023 Presidential Election, Erdoğan failed to cross the 50% threshold, resulting in a second runoff election against Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu. On 28 May 2023 Erdoğan won the second round with 52.14% of the vote, with over 99% of the total vote counted.

On 8 March 2024, he declared that he would retire once his presidential term ended in 2028.

=== Referendum ===

In April 2017, a constitutional referendum was held, where the voters in Turkey (and Turkish citizens abroad) approved a set of 18 proposed amendments to the Constitution of Turkey. The amendments included the replacement of the existing parliamentary system with a presidential system. The post of Prime Minister would be abolished, and the presidency would become an executive post vested with broad executive powers. The parliament seats would be increased from 550 to 600 and the age of candidacy to the parliament was lowered from 25 to 18. The referendum also called for changes to the Supreme Board of Judges and Prosecutors.

==== Local elections ====
In the 2019 local elections, the ruling party AKP lost control of Istanbul and Ankara for the first time in 25 years, as well as 5 of Turkey&#x27;s 6 largest cities. The loss has been widely attributed to Erdoğan&#x27;s mismanagement of the Turkish economic crisis, rising authoritarianism as well as the alleged government inaction on the Syrian refugee crisis. Soon after the elections, Supreme Electoral Council of Turkey ordered a re-election in Istanbul, cancelling Ekrem İmamoğlu&#x27;s mayoral certificate. The decision led to a significant decrease of Erdoğan&#x27;s and AKP&#x27;s popularity and his party lost the elections again in June with a greater margin. The result was seen as a huge blow to Erdoğan, who had once said that if his party &#x27;lost Istanbul, we would lose Turkey. The opposition&#x27;s victory was characterised as &#x27;the beginning of the end&#x27; for Erdoğan&#x27;, with international commentators calling the re-run a huge government miscalculation that led to a potential İmamoğlu candidacy in the next scheduled presidential election. It is suspected that the scale of the government&#x27;s defeat could provoke a cabinet reshuffle and early general elections, currently scheduled for June 2023.

The New Zealand and Australian governments and opposition CHP party have criticized Erdoğan after he repeatedly showed video taken by the Christchurch mosque shooter to his supporters at campaign rallies for 31 March local elections and said Australians and New Zealanders who came to Turkey with anti-Muslim sentiments &quot;would be sent back in coffins like their grandfathers&quot; at Gallipoli.

=== Domestic policy ===
==== Presidential palace ====
Erdoğan has also received criticism for the construction of a new official residence called the Presidential Complex, which takes up approximately 50 acres of Atatürk Forest Farm (AOÇ) in Ankara. Since the AOÇ is protected land, several court orders were issued to halt the construction of the new palace, though building work went on nonetheless. The opposition described the move as a clear disregard for the rule of law. The project was subject to heavy criticism and allegations were made; of corruption during the construction process, wildlife destruction and the complete obliteration of the zoo in the AOÇ in order to make way for the new compound. The fact that the palace is technically illegal has led to it being branded as the &#x27;Kaç-Ak Saray&#x27;, the word &quot;kaçak&quot; in Turkish meaning &#x27;illegal&#x27;.

Ak Saray was originally designed as a new office for the Prime Minister. However, upon assuming the presidency, Erdoğan announced that the palace would become the new Presidential Palace, while the Çankaya Mansion will be used by the Prime Minister instead. The move was seen as a historic change since the Çankaya Mansion had been used as the iconic office of the presidency ever since its inception. The Presidential Complex has almost 1,000 rooms and cost $350 million (€270 million), leading to strong criticism at a time when mining accidents and workers&#x27; rights had been dominating the agenda.

On 29 October 2014, Erdoğan was due to hold a Republic Day reception in the new palace to commemorate the 91st anniversary of the Republic of Turkey and to officially inaugurate the Presidential Palace. However, after most invited participants announced that they would boycott the event and a mining accident occurred in the district of Ermenek in Karaman, the reception was cancelled.

==== The media ====

President Erdoğan and his government continue to press for court action against the remaining free press in Turkey. The latest newspaper that has been seized is &quot;Zaman&quot;, in March 2016. After the seizure Morton Abramowitz and Eric Edelman, former U.S. ambassadors to Turkey, condemned President Erdoğan&#x27;s actions in an opinion piece published by &quot;The Washington Post&quot;: &quot;Clearly, democracy cannot flourish under Erdoğan now&quot;. &quot;The overall pace of reforms in Turkey has not only slowed down but in some key areas, such as freedom of expression and the independence of the judiciary, there has been a regression, which is particularly worrying&quot;, rapporteur Kati Piri said in April 2016 after the European Parliament passed its annual progress report on Turkey.

On 22 June 2016, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said that he considered himself successful in &quot;destroying&quot; Turkish civil groups &quot;working against the state&quot;, a conclusion that had been confirmed some days earlier by Sedat Laçiner, Professor of International Relations and rector of the Çanakkale Onsekiz Mart University: &quot;Outlawing unarmed and peaceful opposition, sentencing people to unfair punishment under erroneous terror accusations, will feed genuine terrorism in Erdoğan&#x27;s Turkey. Guns and violence will become the sole alternative for legally expressing free thought&quot;.

After the coup attempt, over 200 journalists were arrested and over 120 media outlets were closed. &quot;Cumhuriyet&quot; journalists were detained in November 2016 after a long-standing crackdown on the newspaper. Subsequently, Reporters Without Borders called Erdoğan an &quot;enemy of press freedom&quot; and said that he &quot;hides his aggressive dictatorship under a veneer of democracy&quot;.

In 2014, Turkey temporarily blocked access to Twitter. In April 2017, Turkey blocked all access to Wikipedia over a content dispute. The Turkish government lifted a two-and-a-half-year ban on Wikipedia on 15 January 2020, restoring access to the online encyclopedia a month after Turkey&#x27;s top court ruled that blocking Wikipedia was unconstitutional.

On 1 July 2020, in a statement made to his party members, Erdoğan announced that the government would introduce new measures and regulations to control or shut down social media platforms such as YouTube, Twitter and Netflix. Through these new measures, each company would be required to appoint an official representative in the country to respond to legal concerns. The decision came after a number of Twitter users insulted his daughter Esra after she gave birth to her fourth child.

==== State of emergency and purges ====
On 20 July 2016, President Erdoğan declared the state of emergency, citing the coup d&#x27;état attempt as justification. It was first scheduled to last three months. The Turkish parliament approved this measure. The state of emergency was later continuously extended until 2018 amidst the ongoing 2016 Turkish purges including comprehensive purges of independent media and detention of tens of thousands of Turkish citizens politically opposed to Erdoğan. More than 50,000 people have been arrested and over 160,000 fired from their jobs by March 2018.
In August 2016, Erdoğan began rounding up journalists who had been publishing, or who were about to publish articles questioning corruption within the Erdoğan administration, and incarcerating them. The number of Turkish journalists jailed by Turkey is higher than any other country, including all of those journalists currently jailed in North Korea, Cuba, Russia, and China combined.
In the wake of the coup attempt of July 2016 the Erdoğan administration began rounding up tens of thousands of individuals, both from within the government, and from the public sector, and incarcerating them on charges of alleged &quot;terrorism&quot;. As a result of these arrests, many in the international community complained about the lack of proper judicial process in the incarceration of Erdoğan&#x27;s opposition. 

In April 2017 Erdoğan successfully sponsored legislation effectively making it illegal for the Turkish legislative branch to investigate his executive branch of government. Without the checks and balances of freedom of speech, and the freedom of the Turkish legislature to hold him accountable for his actions, many have likened Turkey&#x27;s current form of government to a dictatorship with only nominal forms of democracy in practice. At the time of Erdoğan&#x27;s successful passing of the most recent legislation silencing his opposition, United States President Donald Trump called Erdoğan to congratulate him for his &quot;recent referendum victory&quot;.

On 29 April 2017 Erdoğan&#x27;s administration began an internal Internet block of all of the Wikipedia online encyclopedia site via Turkey&#x27;s domestic Internet filtering system. This blocking action took place after the government had first made a request for Wikipedia to remove what it referred to as &quot;offensive content&quot;. In response, Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales replied via a post on Twitter stating, &quot;Access to information is a fundamental human right. Turkish people, I will always stand with you and fight for this right.&quot;

In January 2016, more than a thousand academics signed a petition criticizing Turkey&#x27;s military crackdown on ethnic Kurdish towns and neighborhoods in the east of the country, such as Sur (a district of Diyarbakır), Silvan, Nusaybin, Cizre and Silopi, and asking an end to violence. Erdoğan accused those who signed the petition of &quot;terrorist propaganda&quot;, calling them &quot;the darkest of people&quot;. He called for action by institutions and universities, stating, &quot;Everyone who benefits from this state but is now an enemy of the state must be punished without further delay&quot;. Within days, over 30 of the signatories were arrested, many in dawn-time raids on their homes. Although all were quickly released, nearly half were fired from their jobs, eliciting a denunciation from Turkey&#x27;s Science Academy for such &quot;wrong and disturbing&quot; treatment. Erdoğan vowed that the academics would pay the price for &quot;falling into a pit of treachery&quot;.

On 8 July 2018, Erdoğan sacked 18,000 officials for alleged ties to US based cleric Fethullah Gülen, shortly before renewing his term as an executive president. Of those removed, 9000 were police officers with 5000 from the armed forces with the addition of hundreds of academics.

==== Economic policy ====
Under his presidency, Erdoğan has decreased the independence of the Central Bank and pushed it to pursue a highly unorthodox monetary policy, decreasing interest rates even with high inflation. He has pushed the theory that inflation is caused by high interest rates, an idea universally rejected by economists. This, along with other factors such as excessive current account deficit and foreign-currency debt, in combination with Erdoğan&#x27;s increasing authoritarianism, caused an economic crisis starting from 2018, leading to large depreciation of the Turkish lira and very high inflation. Economist Paul Krugman described the unfolding crisis as &quot;a classic currency-and-debt crisis, of a kind we&#x27;ve seen many times&quot;, adding: &quot;At such a time, the quality of leadership suddenly matters a great deal. You need officials who understand what&#x27;s happening, can devise a response and have enough credibility that markets give them the benefit of the doubt. Some emerging markets have those things, and they are riding out the turmoil fairly well. The Erdoğan regime has none of that&quot;.

=== Foreign policy ===
==== Europe ====

In February 2016, Erdoğan threatened to send the millions of refugees in Turkey to EU member states, saying: &quot;We can open the doors to Greece and Bulgaria anytime and we can put the refugees on buses ... So how will you deal with refugees if you don&#x27;t get a deal?&quot;

In an interview to the news magazine , German minister of defence Ursula von der Leyen said on 11 March 2016 that the refugee crisis had made good cooperation between EU and Turkey an &quot;existentially important&quot; issue. &quot;Therefore it is right to advance now negotiations on Turkey&#x27;s EU accession&quot;.
In its resolution &quot;The functioning of democratic institutions in Turkey&quot; from 22 June 2016, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe warned that &quot;recent developments in Turkey pertaining to freedom of the media and of expression, erosion of the rule of law and the human rights violations in relation to anti-terrorism security operations in south-east Turkey have ... raised serious questions about the functioning of its democratic institutions&quot;.

In January 2017, Erdoğan said that the withdrawal of Turkish troops from Northern Cyprus is &quot;out of the question&quot; and Turkey will be in Cyprus &quot;forever&quot;.

In September 2020, Erdoğan declared his government&#x27;s support for Azerbaijan following a major conflict between Armenian and Azeri forces over a disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh. He dismissed demands for a ceasefire. In 2022, Erdoğan and Russian President Vladimir Putin planned for Turkey to become an energy hub for all of Europe through the TurkStream and Blue Stream gas pipelines. In October 2023 Erdoğan canceled attendance at the third European Political Community (EPC) meeting.
===== Finnish and Swedish NATO accession =====
In May 2022, Erdoğan voiced his opposition to Finland and Sweden joining NATO, accusing the two countries of tolerating groups which Turkey classifies as terrorist organizations, including the Kurdish militant groups PKK, PYD and YPG and the supporters of Fethullah Gülen. Following a protest in Sweden where a Quran was burned, Erdogan re-iterated that he would not support Sweden&#x27;s bid to join NATO. President of Finland Sauli Niinistö visited Erdogan in Istanbul and Ankara in March 2023. During the visit, Erdogan confirmed that he supported Finnish NATO membership and declared that the Turkish parliament would confirm Finnish membership before the Turkish Presidential elections in May 2023. On 23 March 2023, the Turkish parliament&#x27;s foreign relations committee confirmed the Finnish NATO membership application and sent the process to the Turkish Parliament&#x27;s plenary session. On 1 April 2023, Erdoğan confirmed and signed the Turkish Grand National Assembly&#x27;s ratification of Finnish NATO membership. This decision sealed Finland&#x27;s entry to NATO. In June 2023, Erdoğan again voiced his opposition to Sweden joining NATO. 
Just prior to the NATO summit in Vilnius in July 2023, Erdoğan linked Sweden&#x27;s accession to NATO membership to Turkey&#x27;s application for EU membership. Turkey had applied for EU membership in 1999, but talks made little progress since 2016. In September 2023, Erdoğan announced that the European Union was well into a rupture in its relations with Turkey and that they would part ways during Turkey&#x27;s European Union membership process. However, on 23 October 2023, Erdoğan approved Sweden&#x27;s pending NATO membership bid and sent the accession protocol to the Turkish Parliament for ratification. Two days later, Turkey&#x27;s parliamentary speaker, Numan Kurtulmuş, sent a bill approving Sweden&#x27;s NATO membership bid to parliament&#x27;s foreign affairs committee. The committee discussed the ratification on 16 November 2023, but a decision was deferred, with a request for Sweden to produce a written roadmap to implement its anti-terrorism commitments. On 26 December 2023, the Turkish parliament&#x27;s foreign relations committee confirmed the Swedish NATO membership application and sent the process to the Turkish Parliament&#x27;s plenary session. On 25 January 2024, Erdoğan formally signed and approved the Turkish parliament&#x27;s decision to ratify Swedish NATO membership.
==== Greece ====

There is a long-standing dispute between Turkey and Greece in the Aegean Sea. Erdoğan warned that Greece will pay a &quot;heavy price&quot; if Turkey&#x27;s gas exploration vessel – in what Turkey said are disputed waters – is attacked. He deemed the readmission of Greece into the military alliance NATO a mistake, claiming they were collaborating with terrorists.

===== Diaspora =====

In March 2017, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan stated to the Turks in Europe, &quot;Make not three, but five children. Because you are the future of Europe. That will be the best response to the injustices against you.&quot; This has been interpreted as an imperialist call for demographic warfare.

According to &quot;The Economist&quot;, Erdoğan is the first Turkish leader to take the Turkish diaspora seriously, which has created friction within these diaspora communities and between the Turkish government and several of its European counterparts.

==== The Balkans ====

In February 2018, President Erdoğan expressed Turkish support of the Republic of Macedonia&#x27;s position during negotiations over the Macedonia naming dispute saying that Greece&#x27;s position is wrong.

In March 2018, President Erdoğan criticized the Kosovan Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj for dismissing his Interior Minister and Intelligence Chief for failing to inform him of an unauthorized and illegal secret operation conducted by the National Intelligence Organization of Turkey on Kosovo&#x27;s territory that led to the arrest of six people allegedly associated with the Gülen movement.

On 26 November 2019, an earthquake struck the Durrës region of Albania. President Erdoğan expressed his condolences. and citing close Albanian-Turkish relations, he committed Turkey to reconstructing 500 earthquake destroyed homes and other civic structures in Laç, Albania. In Istanbul, Erdoğan organised and attended a donors conference (8 December) to assist Albania that included Turkish businessmen, investors and Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama.

==== Azerbaijan ====

In September 2023, Azerbaijan launched a large-scale military offensive to recapture the Armenian-populated Nagorno-Karabakh. Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Erdoğan stated &quot;As everyone now acknowledges, Karabakh is Azerbaijani territory. Imposition of another status [to the region] will never be accepted,&quot; and that &quot;[Turkey] support[s] the steps taken by Azerbaijan—with whom we act together with the motto of one nation, two states—to defend its territorial integrity.&quot; Erdoğan also met with Azerbaijan&#x27;s President Ilham Aliyev in the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic.

==== United Kingdom ====

In May 2018, British Prime Minister Theresa May welcomed Erdoğan to the United Kingdom for a three-day state visit. Erdoğan declared that the United Kingdom is &quot;an ally and a strategic partner, but also a real friend. The cooperation we have is well beyond any mechanism that we have established with other partners.&quot;

==== Israel ====
Relations between Turkey and Israel began to normalize after Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu officially apologized for the death of the nine Turkish activists during the Gaza flotilla raid. However, in response to the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict, Erdoğan accused Israel of being &quot;more barbaric than Hitler&quot;, and conducting &quot;state terrorism&quot; and a &quot;genocide attempt&quot; against the Palestinians.

In December 2017, President Erdoğan issued a warning to Donald Trump, after the U.S. President acknowledged Jerusalem as Israel&#x27;s capital. Erdoğan stated, &quot;Jerusalem is a red line for Muslims&quot;, indicating that naming Jerusalem as Israel&#x27;s capital would alienate Palestinians and other Muslims from the city, undermining hopes at a future capital of a Palestinian State. Erdoğan called Israel a &quot;terrorist state&quot;. Naftali Bennett dismissed the threats, claiming &quot;Erdoğan does not miss an opportunity to attack Israel&quot;.

In April 2019, Erdoğan said the West Bank belongs to Palestinians, after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would annex Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories if he is re-elected.

Erdoğan condemned the Israel–UAE peace agreement, stating that Turkey was considering suspending or cutting off diplomatic relations with the United Arab Emirates in retaliation.

The relations shifted back to normality since 2021, when the two countries started improving relations. In March 2022, Israeli president Isaac Herzog visited Turkey, meeting Erdoğan. The two countries agreed to restore diplomatic relations in August 2022.

Erdoğan condemned the Israeli attacks in the Gaza strip during 2023 Israel–Hamas war, saying they are a violation of human rights, which led to accusations of hypocrisy as Turkey itself severely bombed Kurdish areas at the same time, including many civilian targets. Erdoğan said that Israel&#x27;s bombing and blockade of the Gaza Strip in retaliation for Hamas’ attack was a disproportionate response amounting to a &quot;massacre.&quot; On 25 October 2023, Erdoğan said that Hamas was not a terrorist organisation but a liberation group fighting to protect Palestinian lands and people. On 15 November 2023, he condemned Israel as a &quot;terrorist state&quot; and accused it of committing genocide against the Palestinians.

==== Syrian Civil War ====

Diplomatic relations between Turkey and Syria significantly deteriorated due to the Syrian civil war. Initially, while tens of thousand of Syrian refugees already crossed the border to Turkey, Turkish officials tried to convince Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to make significant reforms to alleviate the conflict and calm down the protests. The last of such meetings happened on 9 August 2011, during a seven-hour meeting between Assad and Turkey&#x27;s Ahmet Davutoğlu, giving the latter the title of &#x27;the last European leader who visited Assad&#x27;.

Turkey got involved in a violent conflict with Islamic State (IS) as part of the spillover of the Syrian Civil War. IS executed a series of attacks against Turkish soldiers and civilians. In an ISIS-video, where two Turkish soldiers were burned alive, Turkish President Erdoğan was verbally attacked by ISIS and threatened with the destruction of Turkey. Turkey joined the international military intervention against the Islamic State in 2015. The Turkish Armed Forces&#x27; Operation Euphrates Shield was aimed at IS, and areas around Jarabulus and al-Bab were conquered from IS.

In January 2018, the Turkish military and its allies Syrian National Army and Sham Legion began Operation Olive Branch in Afrin in Northern Syria, against the Kurdish armed group YPG. In October 2019, the United States gave the go-ahead to the 2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria, despite recently agreeing to a Northern Syria Buffer Zone. U.S. troops in northern Syria were withdrawn from the border to avoid interference with the Turkish operation. After the U.S. pullout, Turkey proceeded to attack the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria. Rejecting criticism of the invasion, Erdoğan claimed that NATO and European Union countries &quot;sided with terrorists, and all of them attacked us&quot;. Erdoğan then filed a criminal complaint against French magazine &quot;Le Point&quot; after it accused him of conducting ethnic cleansing in the area. With Erdogan&#x27;s control of the media fanning local nationalism, a poll by Metropoll Research found that 79% of Turkish respondents expressed support for the operation.

==== China ====
Bilateral trade between Turkey and China increased from $1 billion a year in 2002 to $27 billion annually in 2017. Erdoğan has stated that Turkey might consider joining the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation instead of the European Union.

In 2009, Erdoğan accused China of &quot;genocide&quot; against the Uyghurs in Xinjiang. In 2019, the Turkish Foreign Ministry issued a statement condemning what it described as China&#x27;s &quot;reintroduction of concentration camps in the 21st century&quot; and &quot;a great cause of shame for humanity&quot;. Later that year, while visiting China, Erdoğan said that there were those who &quot;exploited&quot; the Uyghur issue to strain relations between China and Turkey. Since then the Turkish government has largely toned down its criticisms of China&#x27;s treatment of Uyghurs, and cracked down on Uyghur activists at China&#x27;s behest, and has expanded deportations of Uyghurs to China.

==== Japan ====

==== Qatar blockade ====
In June 2017 during a speech, Erdoğan called the isolation of Qatar as &quot;inhumane and against Islamic values&quot; and that &quot;victimising Qatar through smear campaigns serves no purpose&quot;.

==== Myanmar ====

In September 2017, Erdoğan condemned the persecution of Muslims in Myanmar and accused Myanmar of &quot;genocide&quot; against the Muslim minority.

==== United States ====

Over time, Turkey began to look for ways to buy its own missile defense system and also to use that procurement to build up its own capacity to manufacture and sell an air and missile defense system. Turkey got serious about acquiring a missile defense system early in the first Obama administration when it opened a competition between the Raytheon Patriot PAC 2 system and systems from Europe, Russia, and even China.

Taking advantage of the new low in U.S.-Turkish relations, Putin saw his chance to use an S-400 sale to Turkey, so in July 2017, he offered the air defense system to Turkey. In the months that followed, the United States warned Turkey that a S-400 purchase jeopardized Turkey&#x27;s F-35 purchase. Integration of the Russian system into the NATO air defense net was also out of the question. Administration officials, including Mark Esper, warned that Turkey had to choose between the S-400 and the F-35, that they could not have both.

The S-400 deliveries to Turkey began on 12 July. On 16 July, Trump mentioned to reporters that withholding the F-35 from Turkey was unfair. Said the president, &quot;So what happens is we have a situation where Turkey is very good with us, very good, and we are now telling Turkey that because you have really been forced to buy another missile system, we&#x27;re not going to sell you the F-35 fighter jets&quot;.

The U.S. Congress made clear on a bipartisan basis that it expected the president to sanction Turkey for buying Russian equipment. Out of the F-35, Turkey considered buying Russian fifth-generation jet fighter Su-57.

On 1 August 2018, the U.S. Department of Treasury sanctioned two senior Turkish government ministers who were involved in the detention of American pastor Andrew Brunson. Erdoğan said that U.S. behavior would force Turkey to look for new friends and allies. The U.S.–Turkey tensions appeared to be the most serious diplomatic crisis between the NATO allies in years.

Trump&#x27;s former national security adviser John Bolton claimed that President Donald Trump told Erdoğan he would &#x27;take care&#x27; of the investigation against Turkey&#x27;s state-owned bank Halkbank, accused of bank fraud charges and laundering up to $20 billion on behalf of Iranian entities. Turkey criticized Bolton&#x27;s book, saying it included misleading accounts of conversations between Trump and Erdoğan.

In August 2020, the former vice president and presidential candidate Joe Biden called for a new U.S. approach to the &quot;autocrat&quot; President Erdoğan and support for Turkish opposition parties. In September 2020, Biden demanded that Erdoğan &quot;stay out&quot; of the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War between Azerbaijan and Armenia, in which Turkey supported the Azeris.

Meanwhile, Erdoğan wants to realize the Zangezur corridor land route in the southern Caucasus, a geopolitical corridor from Europe through Central Asia, all the way to China.

==== Venezuela ====
Relations with Venezuela were strengthened with recent developments and high level mutual visits. The first official visit between the two countries at presidential level was in October 2017 when Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro visited Turkey. In December 2018, Erdoğan visited Venezuela for the first time and expressed his will to build strong relations with Venezuela and expressed hope that high-level visits &quot;will increasingly continue&quot;.

Reuters reported that in 2018 23 tons of mined gold were taken from Venezuela to Istanbul. In the first nine months of 2018, Venezuela&#x27;s gold exports to Turkey rose from zero in the previous year to US$900 million.

During the Venezuelan presidential crisis, Erdoğan voiced solidarity with Venezuela&#x27;s President Nicolás Maduro and criticized U.S. sanctions against Venezuela, saying that &quot;political problems cannot be resolved by punishing an entire nation.&quot;

Following the 2019 Venezuelan uprising attempt, Erdoğan condemned the actions of lawmaker Juan Guaidó, tweeting &quot;Those who are in an effort to appoint a postmodern colonial governor to Venezuela, where the President was appointed by elections and where the people rule, should know that only democratic elections can determine how a country is governed&quot;.

==== Ukraine and Russian invasion of Ukraine ====
In 2016, Erdoğan told his Ukrainian counterpart Petro Poroshenko that Turkey would not recognize the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea; calling it &quot;Crimea&#x27;s occupation&quot;.

During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Erdoğan functioned as a mediator and peace broker. On 10 March 2022, Turkey hosted a trilateral meeting with Ukraine and Russia on the margins of Antalya Diplomacy Forum, making it the first high-level talks since the invasion. Following the peace talks in Istanbul on 29 March 2022, Russia decided to leave areas around Kyiv and Chernihiv. On 22 July 2022, together with United Nations, Turkey brokered a deal between Russia and Ukraine about clearing the way for the export of grain from Ukrainian ports, following the 2022 food crises. On 21 September 2022, a record-high of 215 Ukrainian soldiers, including fighters who led the defence of the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol, had been released in a prisoner exchange with Russia after mediation by Turkish President Erdoğan. As part of the agreement, the freed captives stay in Turkey until the war is over.

While Turkey has closed the Bosphorus to Russian naval reinforcements, enforced United Nations sanctions and supplied Ukraine with military equipment such as Bayraktar TB2 drones and BMC Kirpi vehicles, it didn&#x27;t participate in certain sanctions like closing the Turkish airspace for Russian civilians and continued the dialogue with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Erdoğan reiterated his stance on Crimea in 2022 saying that international law requires that Russia must return Crimea to Ukraine.

On 18 February 2025, Erdoğan stated that Turkey would be the &quot;ideal host for possible talks between Russia, Ukraine and the USA,&quot; arguing that Turkey is seen as a &quot;reliable mediator&quot; by both Russia and Ukraine. 

=== Events ===

==== Coup d&#x27;état attempt ====

On 15 July 2016, a coup d&#x27;état was attempted by the military, with aims to remove Erdoğan from government. By the next day, Erdoğan&#x27;s government managed to reassert effective control in the country. Reportedly, no government official was arrested or harmed, which, among other factors, raised the suspicion of a false flag event staged by the government itself.
Erdoğan, as well as other government officials, has blamed an exiled cleric, and a former ally of Erdoğan, Fethullah Gülen, for staging the coup attempt. Süleyman Soylu, Minister of Labor in Erdoğan&#x27;s government, accused the US of planning a coup to oust Erdoğan.

Erdoğan, as well as other high-ranking Turkish government officials, has issued repeated demands to the US to extradite Gülen.

Following the coup attempt, there has been a significant deterioration in Turkey-US relations. European and other world leaders have expressed their concerns over the situation in Turkey, with many of them warning Erdoğan not to use the coup attempt as an excuse to crack down on his opponents.

The rise of ISIS and the collapse of the Kurdish peace process had led to a sharp rise in terror incidents in Turkey until 2016. Erdoğan was accused by his critics of having a &#x27;soft corner&#x27; for ISIS. However, after the attempted coup, Erdoğan ordered the Turkish military into Syria to combat ISIS and Kurdish militant groups. Erdoğan&#x27;s critics have decried purges in the education system and judiciary as undermining the rule of law however Erdoğan supporters argue this is a necessary measure as Gulen-linked schools cheated on entrance exams, requiring a purge in the education system and of the Gulen followers who then entered the judiciary.

Erdoğan&#x27;s plan is &quot;to reconstitute Turkey as a presidential system. The plan would create a centralized system that would enable him to better tackle Turkey&#x27;s internal and external threats. One of the main hurdles allegedly standing in his way is Fethullah Gulen&#x27;s movement ...&quot; In the aftermath of the 2016 Turkish coup d&#x27;état attempt, a groundswell of national unity and consensus emerged for cracking down on the coup plotters with a National Unity rally held in Turkey that included Islamists, secularists, liberals and nationalists. Erdoğan has used this consensus to remove Gulen&#x27;s followers from the bureaucracy, curtail their role in NGOs, Turkey&#x27;s Ministry of Religious Affairs and the Turkish military, with 149 Generals discharged. In a foreign policy shift Erdoğan ordered the Turkish Armed Forces into battle in Syria and has liberated towns from IS control. As relations with Europe soured over in the aftermath of the attempted coup, Erdoğan developed alternative relationships with Russia, Saudi Arabia and a &quot;strategic partnership&quot; with Pakistan, with plans to cultivate relations through free trade agreements and deepening military relations for mutual co-operation with Turkey&#x27;s regional allies.

==== 2023 earthquake ====

On 6 February 2023, a catastrophic earthquake occurred during his administration in southeastern Turkey and northwestern Syria, killing more than 50,000 people.

== Ideology and public image ==
Early during his premiership, Erdoğan was praised as a role model for emerging Middle Eastern nations due to several reform packages initiated by his government which expanded religious freedoms and minority rights as part of accession negotiations with the European Union. However, his government underwent several crises including the Sledgehammer coup and the Ergenekon trials, corruption scandals, accusations of media intimidation, as well as the pursuit of an increasingly polarizing political agenda; the opposition accused the government of inciting political hatred throughout the country. He has also been described as having &quot;long championed Islamist causes&quot;.

=== Ziya Gökalp ===
In 2019, Erdoğan once again publicly recited Ziya Gökalp&#x27;s &quot;Soldier&#x27;s Prayer&quot; poem, as he had done in 1997. According to Hans-Lukas Kieser, these recitations betray Erdoğan&#x27;s desire to create Gökalp&#x27;s pre-1923 ideal, that is, &quot;a modern, leader-led Islamic-Turkish state extending beyond the boundaries of the Treaty of Lausanne&quot;.

=== Ottomanism ===
As President, Erdoğan has overseen a revival of Ottoman tradition, greeting Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas with an Ottoman-style ceremony in the new presidential palace, with guards dressed in costumes representing founders of 16 Great Turkish Empires in history. While Prime Minister of Turkey, Erdoğan&#x27;s AKP made references to the Ottoman era during election campaigns, such as calling their supporters &#x27;grandsons of Ottomans&#x27; &quot;(Osmanlı torunu).&quot; This proved controversial, since it was perceived to be an open attack against the republican nature of modern Turkey founded by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. In 2015, Erdoğan made a statement in which he endorsed the old Ottoman term &quot;külliye&quot; to refer to university campuses rather than the standard Turkish word &quot;kampüs&quot;. Many critics have thus accused Erdoğan of wanting to become an Ottoman sultan and abandon the secular and democratic credentials of the Republic. 

When pressed on this issue in January 2015, Erdoğan denied these claims and said that he would aim to be more like Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom rather than like an Ottoman sultan.

In July 2020, after the Council of State annulled the Cabinet&#x27;s 1934 decision to establish the Hagia Sophia as museum and revoking the monument&#x27;s status, Erdoğan ordered its reclassification as a mosque. The 1934 decree was ruled to be unlawful under both Ottoman and Turkish law as Hagia Sophia&#x27;s &quot;waqf&quot;, endowed by Sultan Mehmed II, had designated the site a mosque; proponents of the decision argued the Hagia Sophia was the personal property of the sultan. This redesignation is controversial, invoking condemnation from the Turkish opposition, UNESCO, the World Council of Churches, the Holy See, and many other international leaders. In August 2020, he also signed the order that transferred the administration of the Chora Church to the Directorate of Religious Affairs to open it for worship as a mosque. Initially converted to a mosque by the Ottomans, the building had then been designated as a museum by the government since 1934.

In August 2020, Erdoğan gave a speech saying that &quot;in our civilization, conquest is not occupation or looting. It is establishing the dominance of the justice that Allah commanded in the region. First of all, our nation removed the oppression from the areas that it conquered. It established justice. This is why our civilization is one of conquest. Turkey will take what is its right in the Mediterranean Sea, in the Aegean Sea, and in the Black Sea.&quot; In October 2020, he made a statement before the Grand National Assembly that &quot;Jerusalem is ours&quot;, referring to the period of Ottoman rule over the city and the rebuilding of its Old City by Suleiman the Magnificent.

In October 2023 the first church built with government backing in Turkey&#x27;s 100-year history as a post-Ottoman state was inaugurated.

=== Authoritarianism ===
Erdoğan has been the de facto leader of Turkey since 2002. In the more recent years of Erdoğan&#x27;s rule, Turkey has experienced increasing authoritarianism, democratic backsliding, and corruption, as well as expansionism, censorship, and banning of parties or dissent. In response to criticism, Erdoğan made a speech in May 2014 denouncing allegations of dictatorship, saying that the leader of the opposition, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, who was there at the speech, would not be able to &quot;roam the streets&quot; freely if he were a dictator. Kılıçdaroğlu responded that political tensions would cease to exist if Erdoğan stopped making his polarizing speeches for three days. One observer said it was a measure of the state of Turkish democracy that Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu could openly threaten, on 20 December 2015, that, if his party did not win the election, Turkish Kurds would endure a repeat of the era of the &quot;white Toros&quot;.

In April 2014, the President of the Constitutional Court, Haşim Kılıç, accused Erdoğan of damaging the credibility of the judiciary, labelling Erdoğan&#x27;s attempts to increase political control over the courts as &#x27;desperate&#x27;. During the chaotic 2007 presidential election, the military issued an E-memorandum warning the government to keep within the boundaries of secularism when choosing a candidate. Regardless, Erdoğan&#x27;s close relations with Fethullah Gülen and his Cemaat Movement allowed his government to maintain a degree of influence within the judiciary through Gülen&#x27;s supporters in high judicial and bureaucratic offices. Shortly after, an alleged coup plot codenamed Sledgehammer became public and resulted in the imprisonment of 300 military officers including İbrahim Fırtına, Çetin Doğan and Engin Alan. Several opposition politicians, journalists and military officers also went on trial for allegedly being part of an ultra-nationalist organization called Ergenekon.
Both cases were marred by irregularities and were condemned as a joint attempt by Erdoğan and Gülen to curb opposition to the AKP. The original Sledgehammer document containing the coup plans, allegedly written in 2003, was found to have been written using Microsoft Word 2007. Despite both domestic and international calls for these irregularities to be addressed in order to guarantee a fair trial, Erdoğan instead praised his government for bringing the coup plots to light. When Gülen publicly withdrew support and openly attacked Erdoğan in late 2013, several imprisoned military officers and journalists were released, with the government admitting that the judicial proceedings were unfair.

When Gülen withdrew support from the AKP government in late 2013, a government corruption scandal broke out, leading to the arrest of several family members of cabinet ministers. Erdoğan accused Gülen of co-ordinating a &quot;parallel state&quot; within the judiciary in an attempt to topple him from power. He then removed or reassigned several judicial officials in an attempt to remove Gülen&#x27;s supporters from office. Erdoğan&#x27;s &#x27;purge&#x27; was widely questioned and criticized by the European Union. In early 2014, a new law was passed by parliament giving the government greater control over the judiciary, which sparked public protest throughout the country. International organizations perceived the law to be a danger to the separation of powers.

Several judicial officials removed from their posts said that they had been removed due to their secularist credentials. The political opposition accused Erdoğan of not only attempting to remove Gülen supporters, but supporters of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk&#x27;s principles as well, in order to pave the way for increased politicization of the judiciary. Several family members of Erdoğan&#x27;s ministers who had been arrested as a result of the 2013 corruption scandal were released, and a judicial order to question Erdoğan&#x27;s son Bilal Erdoğan was annulled. Controversy erupted when it emerged that many of the newly appointed judicial officials were actually AKP supporters. İslam Çiçek, a judge who ejected the cases of five ministers&#x27; relatives accused of corruption, was accused of being an AKP supporter and an official investigation was launched into his political affiliations. On 1 September 2014, the courts dissolved the cases of 96 suspects, which included Bilal Erdoğan.

==== Suppression of dissent ====

Erdoğan has been criticized for his politicization of the media, especially after the 2013 protests. The opposition Republican People&#x27;s Party (CHP) alleged that over 1,863 journalists lost their jobs due to their anti-government views in 12 years of AKP rule. Opposition politicians have also alleged that intimidation in the media is due to the government&#x27;s attempt to restructure the ownership of private media corporations. Journalists from the Cihan News Agency and the Gülenist &quot;Zaman&quot; newspaper were repeatedly barred from attending government press conferences or asking questions. Several opposition journalists such as Soner Yalçın were controversially arrested as part of the Ergenekon trials and Sledgehammer coup investigation. Veli Ağbaba, a CHP politician, has called the AKP the &#x27;biggest media boss in Turkey.&#x27;

In 2015, 74 US senators sent a letter to US Secretary of State, John Kerry, to state their concern over what they saw as deviations from the basic principles of democracy in Turkey and oppressions of Erdoğan over media.

Notable cases of media censorship occurred during the 2013 anti-government protests, when the mainstream media did not broadcast any news regarding the demonstrations for three days after they began. The lack of media coverage was symbolised by CNN International covering the protests while CNN Türk broadcast a documentary about penguins at the same time. The Radio and Television Supreme Council (RTÜK) controversially issued a fine to pro-opposition news channels including Halk TV and Ulusal Kanal for their coverage of the protests, accusing them of broadcasting footage that could be morally, physically and mentally destabilizing to children. Erdoğan was criticized for not responding to the accusations of media intimidation, and caused international outrage after telling a female journalist (Amberin Zaman of &quot;The Economist&quot;) to know her place and calling her a &#x27;shameless militant&#x27; during his 2014 presidential election campaign. While the 2014 presidential election was not subject to substantial electoral fraud, Erdoğan was again criticized for receiving disproportionate media attention in comparison to his rivals. The British newspaper &quot;The Times&quot; commented that between 2 and 4 July, the state-owned media channel TRT gave 204 minutes of coverage to Erdoğan&#x27;s campaign and less than a total of 3 minutes to both his rivals.
Erdoğan also tightened controls over the Internet, signing into law a bill which allows the government to block websites without prior court order on 12 September 2014. His government blocked Twitter and YouTube in late March 2014 following the release of a recording of a conversation between him and his son Bilal, where Erdoğan allegedly warned his family to &#x27;nullify&#x27; all cash reserves at their home amid the 2013 corruption scandal. Erdoğan has undertaken a media campaign that attempts to portray the presidential family as frugal and simple-living; their palace electricity-bill is estimated at $500,000 per month.

In November 2016, the Turkish government blocked access to social media in all of Turkey as well as sought to completely block Internet access for the citizens in the southeast of the country. Since the 2016 coup attempt, authorities arrested or imprisoned more than 90,000 Turkish citizens.

===== Insulting the President lawsuits =====
In February 2015, a 13-year-old was charged by a prosecutor after allegedly insulting Erdoğan on Facebook. In 2016, a waiter was arrested for insulting Erdoğan by allegedly saying &quot;If Erdoğan comes here, I will not even serve tea to him.&quot;. Between 2016 and 2023 there were trials for insulting the president for having compared Erdogan to Gollum, a fictional character of J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;. In May 2016, former Miss Turkey model Merve Büyüksaraç was sentenced to more than a year in prison for allegedly insulting the president. Between 2014 and 2019, 128,872 investigations were launched for insulting the president and prosecutors opened 27,717 criminal cases.

===== Mehmet Aksoy lawsuit =====
In 2009, Turkish sculptor Mehmet Aksoy created the &quot;Statue of Humanity&quot; in Kars to promote reconciliation between Turkey and Armenia. When visiting the city in 2011, Erdoğan deemed the statue a &quot;freak&quot;, and months later it was demolished. Aksoy sued Erdoğan for &quot;moral indemnities&quot;, although his lawyer said that his statement was a critique rather than an insult. In March 2015, a judge ordered Erdoğan to pay 10,000 liras.

=== Erdoğanism ===
The term Erdoğanism first emerged shortly after Erdoğan&#x27;s 2011 general election victory, where it was predominantly described as the AKP&#x27;s liberal economic and conservative democratic ideals fused with Erdoğan&#x27;s demagoguery and cult of personality.

=== Views on minorities ===

==== LGBT ====
In 2002, Erdoğan said that &quot;homosexuals must be legally protected within the framework of their rights and freedoms. From time to time, we do not find the treatment they get on some television screens humane&quot;, he said. However, in 2017 Erdoğan has said that empowering LGBT people in Turkey was &quot;against the values of our nation&quot;.

In 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Turkey&#x27;s top Muslim scholar and President of Religious Affairs, Ali Erbaş, said in a Friday Ramadan announcement that the country condemns homosexuality because it &quot;brings illness&quot;, insinuating that same sex relations were responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan backed Erbaş, saying that what Erbaş &quot;said was totally right.&quot; Starting from 2023, Erdoğan began openly speaking against LGBT people, openly saying that his Coalition &quot;are against the LGBT&quot;, and accusing the Turkish opposition of being LGBT.

In 2023, Erdogan blamed LGBTQ+ people for &quot;undermining family values&quot; in Turkey and called his political opponents &quot;gays&quot; in a derogatory manner. Third-party sources criticized this; seeing it as a bid to distract the public from the ruling party&#x27;s failings—particularly on the country&#x27;s economy; according to these sources, by targeting Turkey&#x27;s minority groups, he rallied his base amid the country&#x27;s ongoing economic troubles to raise the prospects of winning the 2023 general elections in his country, which were seen as critical for his nearly 20-year rule.

==== Jews ====
While Erdoğan has declared several times that he is against antisemitism, he has been accused of invoking antisemitic stereotypes in public statements.

==Personal life==
Erdoğan married Emine Erdoğan (née Gülbaran; b. 1955, Siirt) on 4 July 1978. They have two sons, Ahmet Burak (b. 1979) and Necmettin Bilal (b. 1981), and two daughters, Esra (b. 1983) and Sümeyye (b. 1985). His father, Ahmet Erdoğan, died in 1988 and his mother, Tenzile Erdoğan, died in 2011 at the age of 87.

Erdoğan has a brother, Mustafa (b. 1958), and a sister, Vesile (b. 1965). From his father&#x27;s first marriage to Havuli Erdoğan (d. 1980), he had two half-brothers: Mehmet (1926–1988) and Hasan (1929–2006).

== Electoral history ==

== Honors, awards and recognitions ==

Erdoğan has received numerous national and international awards and honors throughout his political career. These awards and honors reflect his contributions to international relations, cultural dialogue and humanitarian efforts. Internationally, he has been recognized with prestigious awards such as the Medal &quot;In Commemoration of the 1000th Anniversary of Kazan&quot; from Russia, the Nishan-e-Pakistan from Pakistan, and the Order of the Republic from Moldova. He has also been honored with the Grand Cordon of the Order of Leopold from Belgium, the Grand Cordon of the National Order of the Ivory Coast from Ivory Coast, and the Grand Cross of the National Order of Merit from Guinea. Domestically, Erdoğan has received accolades including the Outstanding Service award from the Turkish Red Crescent and the Dialogue Between Cultures Award from the President of Tatarstan. Additionally, he has been awarded the King Faisal International Prize for &quot;service to Islam&quot; and the United Nations–HABITAT award in memorial of Rafik Hariri.

<text>Laurell Kaye Hamilton (born February 19, 1963) is an American fantasy and romance writer. She is best known as the author of two series of stories.

Her &quot;New York Times&quot;-bestselling &quot;Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter&quot; series centers on Anita Blake, a professional zombie raiser, vampire executioner and supernatural consultant for the police, which includes novels, short story collections, and comic books. Six million copies of &quot;Anita Blake&quot; novels are in print. Her Merry Gentry series centers on Meredith Gentry, Princess of the Unseelie court of Faerie, a private detective facing repeated assassination attempts. Both of these fantasy series follow their protagonists as they gain in power and deal with the dangers of worlds in which creatures of legend live.

Several media outlets, including &quot;USA Today&quot;, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, and &quot;Time&quot; have identified her works as significant contributions to the development of the urban-fantasy genre.

== Personal life ==
Laurell Kaye Hamilton was born Laurell Kaye Klein in Heber Springs, Arkansas but grew up in Sims, Indiana with her grandmother Laura Gentry. Her education includes degrees in English and biology from Marion College (now called Indiana Wesleyan University), a private Evangelical Christian liberal arts college in Marion, Indiana that is affiliated with the Wesleyan Church denomination. She met Gary Hamilton, whom she married, there. They have one daughter together, Trinity.

Hamilton is involved with a number of animal charities, particularly supporting dog rescue efforts and wolf preservation.

Hamilton lives in St. Louis County, Missouri, with her daughter Trinity, and husband Jonathon Green whom she married in 2001.

==Works==
Laurell K. Hamilton is the author of two major book series, spin-off comic books, various anthologies, and other stand-alone titles:
* &quot;Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter&quot; is an animator and necromancer who raises the dead for a living. She is also a vampire executioner and in later books a U.S. Marshal. Blake lives in a fictional St. Louis where vampires and were-animals exist and recently gained some rights as citizens. As of November 2013, Hamilton has published 22 novels and 5 novellas in the Anita Blake series. As of 2009 more than 6 million copies of Anita Blake novels have been printed and several have become &quot;New York Times&quot; bestsellers.
* &quot;Anita Blake&quot; comics are the comic-book renditions of the Anita Blake series. As of May 2012, the comic-book series has included her first three books, &quot;Guilty Pleasures, Laughing Corpse&quot; and &quot;Circus of the Damned&quot;. There was also a special prologue comic issued named, &quot;The First Death&quot;.
* &quot;Merry Gentry&quot; is a Princess of Faerie and a private investigator. She is constantly dodging assassination attempts while juggling life in the &quot;real world&quot; where everyone knows faeries exist. As of 2014, there have been a total of nine novels in the Merry Gentry series.

==Reception==
&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; and &quot;USA Today&quot; have identified Hamilton as having a significant impact on urban fantasy. In 2008, &quot;Time&quot; declared that the popularity of the genre &quot;owes everything to Laurell K. Hamilton&quot;. Authors Courtney Allison Moulton and Kelly Gay have noted Hamilton as an inspiration.

===Anita Blake===
Reader reaction to the series&#x27;s shift in tone from crime noir thriller to focus more predominantly on the sexual themes in the series has been mixed, starting with &quot;Narcissus in Chains&quot; when the main character of Anita Blake becomes infected with the &quot;ardeur&quot;. The &quot;ardeur&quot; is a supernatural power inadvertently given to Anita by her vampire Master Jean-Claude that gives her massive amounts of power but also demands that she have sexual intercourse with several different people through the course of a day, sometimes in large groups. Reception to these dynamics and to the usage of sexual abuse in later books has been mixed, with some reviewers commenting that the character of Anita spent too much time &quot;obsessing about whether or not she’s a slut&quot; while others remarked that the erotic themes enhanced the series. In response to these comments, Hamilton issued a blog entitled &quot;Dear Negative Reader&quot; where she addressed a growing number of readers on the Internet that were expressing disappointment in the series&#x27;s changes. In the blog Hamilton told the readers that &quot;life is too short to read books you don’t like&quot; and that if they found that the current subject matter pushed &quot;you past that comfortable envelope of the mundane&quot; then &quot;stop reading&quot; and speculated that some of the readers were either &quot;closet readers&quot; or comment based on others&#x27; opinions. The blog entry was negatively received by some readers.

Critical reviewers have also commented on the amount of sex in later books, as in a 2006 review in &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; of &quot;Micah&quot;. The review was largely negative, stating &quot;we were not impressed. Hamilton no doubt appeals to romance and erotica lovers, but it does not take long for the clichés and the constant droning about sex to become tiresome.&quot; Other reviewers for &quot;The Kansas City Star&quot; and &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; also commented on the rise in sexual themes in the series. The reviewer for the &quot;Kansas City Star&quot; stated that &quot;After 13 erotically charged books, boredom has reared its ugly head for the 14th novel in Laurell K. Hamilton&#x27;s Anita Blake series, as eroticism becomes mere description...&quot; and &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; commented that &quot;Blood Noir&quot; had a &quot;growing air of ennui, which longtime readers can&#x27;t help sharing as sex increasingly takes the place of plot and character development&quot;.

In contrast, a &quot;Denver Post&quot; review of &quot;Danse Macabre&quot; took a more positive view of the eroticism in Hamilton&#x27;s work. Although it noted that &quot;[t]hose looking for mystery and mayhem on this Anita adventure are out of luck&quot; it also stated that &quot;the main attraction of the Anita Blake novels in the past five years has been their erotic novelty&quot;, and &quot;[f]ew, if any, mainstream novels delve so deeply into pure, unadulterated erotica&quot;.

<doc id="376625" wikidata="Q1065268" url="?curid=376625" title="Sakigake">
<text>, known before launch as MS-T5, was Japan&#x27;s first interplanetary spacecraft and the first deep space probe to be launched by any country other than the US or the Soviet Union. It aimed to demonstrate the performance of the new launch vehicle, test its ability to escape from Earth gravity, and observe the interplanetary medium and magnetic field. &quot;Sakigake&quot; was also supposed to act as a frame of reference for data received from probes that flew closer to Halley&#x27;s Comet. Early measurements would be used to improve the mission of the Suisei probe launched several months later.

&quot;Sakigake&quot; was developed by the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science for the National Space Development Agency (both of which are now part of the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency, or JAXA). It became a part of the Halley Armada together with Suisei, the Soviet Vega probes, the ESA Giotto and the NASA International Cometary Explorer, to explore Halley&#x27;s Comet during its 1986 sojourn through the inner Solar System.

==Design==
Unlike its twin &quot;Suisei&quot;, it carried no imaging instruments in its instrument payload.

<text>Championship Manager is a series of football management simulation video games, the first of which was released in 1992. The &quot;Championship Manager&quot; brand and game was conceived by brothers Paul and Oliver Collyer. In a scenario typical of many self-made game programming teams in the early days of the industry, the original &quot;Championship Manager&quot; game was written from their bedroom in Shropshire, England. The brothers subsequently founded a development company to take the game further, Sports Interactive, and moved to Islington, North London. &quot;Championship Manager&quot; became the most popular football management sim of the later 1990s and early 2000s, regularly setting sales records.

In 2003, Sports Interactive split with Eidos, the publishers of &quot;Championship Manager&quot;. Sports Interactive retained the game&#x27;s database and match engine, producing a new game based on these titled &quot;Football Manager&quot;. Eidos retained the name and interface, with Beautiful Game Studios taking over the development of &quot;Championship Manager&quot;. Although the two series initially ran alongside one another, the sales of &quot;Championship Manager&quot; began to fall below those of &quot;Football Manager&quot;. The most recent full version of Championship Manager was &quot;Championship Manager 2010&quot;, with an iOS mobile game in 2011 the latest game to date released by Eidos. Square Enix Europe, owners of the brand after purchasing Eidos, revived &quot;Championship Manager&quot; under the title of &quot;Champ Man&quot; in 2013. They have released five games for iOS and Android handheld systems and mobile phones since then.

== Beautiful Game Studios ==
Beautiful Game Studios was founded in 2003, and announced in January 2004 as an internal development team of Eidos Interactive (later renamed Square Enix Europe) that would focus on the development of &quot;Championship Manager&quot;, after the original developer of the series, Sports Interactive, departed from Eidos Interactive in 2003. In May 2008, Eidos hired Roy Meredith as general manager.

In November 2009, after Eidos Interactive had been acquired by Square Enix and renamed Square Enix Europe, Square Enix announced that Beautiful Game Studios would undergo restructuring to &quot;build a successful commercial future&quot; for the &quot;Championship Manager&quot; brand. Around 80% of jobs, including the majority of the internal studio&#x27;s programming department, were either cut or relocated to Eidos Shanghai, while incumbent general manager Roy Meredith retained his position. Despite the significant cuts, it remained operational as a developer.

In September 2010, Beautiful Game Studios announced that they had entered into a strategic partnership with Chinese publisher Shanda Games, which granted Shanda Games the Chinese distribution rights of future &quot;Championship Manager&quot; games. The partnership grew largely from the then-enlarged Eidos Shanghai&#x27;s previous work with Shanda Games, as well as long-term communications between Beautiful Game Studios, Eidos Shanghai, and Shanda Games. The games resulting from this partnership, &quot;Championship Manager: World of Football&quot;, was announced in July 2011.

==&quot;Championship Manager&quot;==

The release of the first version of the game was not an outstanding success, and sales were steady rather than spectacular. Reviews ranged from the encouraging to the dismissive; the original game was written in BASIC, a programming language not well suited to programming high-performance video games. Other limitations included the fact that generated names were used for each team, whereas its key competitors of the time, such as &quot;Premier Manager&quot; and &quot;The Manager&quot;, included real players in the game.

===&quot;Championship Manager &#x27;93&quot;===

The release of &quot;Championship Manager &#x27;93&quot; one year later built on the original game, ported to the C programming language, adding a real life player database and other features. By now &quot;Championship Manager&quot; had built a large following in the UK. This was reviewed many times around July 1993 from its release in around May 1993.

===&quot;Championship Manager Italia&quot;===
The &quot;Championship Manager &#x27;93&quot;/&quot;″94&quot; engine was the basis for &quot;Championship Manager Italia&quot;. This was a version that simulated the top two divisions of Italian football (Serie A and Serie B). There was also a 1995 seasonal update released for this game.

===&quot;Championship Manager &#x27;93&quot; data update disks===
The success of &quot;Championship Manager &#x27;93&quot; spurred the release of two update disks, the first &quot;contains every transfer, promotion, relegation and manager changes&quot; for the beginning of the &#x27;93/&#x27;94 season which is known as &quot;The 1993/94 Season Data Up-Date Disk&quot;. The update required the original &quot;Championship Manager &#x27;93&quot; disks, three blank disks and the Championship Manager &#x27;93/&#x27;94 Season Data Up-Date Disk disk. This was released around September 1993. The second of the two update disks is known as &quot;End of 1994 Season Data Up-Date Disk&quot;, which includes all the latest player transfers, all the play-off results, and the end of season player statistics for the season 1993/1994. This was released around the end of season 1993/1994.

==&quot;Championship Manager 2&quot;==

The success of the franchise lead to the release of &quot;Championship Manager 2&quot; in September 1995. The game again included up-to-date squads for each team, added photos of each ground to build an atmosphere of the teams managed or visited, and included an in-match commentary with the voice of Clive Tyldesley. Two seasonal updates followed over the next two years.

===&quot;Championship Manager 96/97&quot;===

&quot;Championship Manager 96/97&quot; was released in 1996 and was the first game to feature a non-British league as playable in the standard game, in this case the Italian leagues. It also included several rule changes to reflect the many changes going on in the real life world of football at that time, such as the Bosman ruling.

===&quot;Championship Manager 97/98&quot;===

Released in 1997, this version of the game included nine leagues from around the world, three of which could be run simultaneously, new competition formats to follow those implemented in reality, and many more tactical options. The game remains popular amongst fans of the series, mainly for its simplicity compared to the huge, processor-intensive games that the series has since developed into. A fan-made &quot;remake&quot; of the game was released on 1 November 2022. The changes include a fully reworked database for the 1997/98 season, backgrounds, graphical overhaul, 5 leagues, colored attributes and many small tweaks to the match engine and executable. One can also play infinitely, whereas the official version retired the manager after 30 seasons. Two further patches have been released.

==&quot;Championship Manager 3&quot;==

This was the first of the seasonal updates to &quot;Championship Manager 3&quot;. It also included more media involvement, board interaction and improved scouting functions.

===&quot;Championship Manager: Season 99/00&quot;===

This update saw the American Major League Soccer added to the list of playable leagues. It also added the World Club Championship to the equation. &quot;Championship Manager: Season 99/00&quot; received a &quot;Gold&quot; sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 200,000 copies in the United Kingdom.

===&quot;Championship Manager: Season 00/01&quot;===

Ten more playable leagues were introduced for this version, including Australia, Greece, Northern Ireland, Russia and Wales. It was also the first version of the game to come with a data editor - something which has been continued for all subsequent versions.

===&quot;Championship Manager: Season 01/02&quot;===

No new playable leagues were added to this version of &quot;Championship Manager&quot; (until a patch was later released that added South Korea&#x27;s K-League to the game) allowing the developers to fine-tune the game&#x27;s mechanics. &quot;Championship Manager 01/02&quot; also contained the fictional players. The game was released as freeware in December 2008. In April 2002, Sports Interactive took the decision to move away from the PC platform for the first time since &quot;Championship Manager 2&quot;, producing a version of &quot;Championship Manager 01/02&quot; for the Xbox. The success of the game saw a follow-up, &quot;Championship Manager 02/03&quot; released seven months later.

==&quot;Championship Manager 4&quot;==

&quot;Championship Manager 4&quot; was released on 28 March 2003, and broke all records on its release becoming, at that time, the fastest-selling PC game on its first day of release. &quot;Championship Manager 4&quot; included thirty-nine playable leagues, plus four more in its update, &quot;Championship Manager: Season 03/04&quot;. On the gameplay side, a top-down view of the match engine was included for the first time a significant shift from the imagination philosophy championed by Sports Interactive previously.

Despite its high sales, &quot;Championship Manager 4&quot; was generally not well received by hardcore fans for several reasons. The game ran quite slowly on computers which had previously had no difficulty in running &quot;Championship Manager&quot; games. The original release contained some functional bugs which in some cases rendered the game farcical—the score in matches could randomly change, and lower division clubs were able to sign superstars with ease. One bug had non-league club Northwich Victoria moving to a stadium with a capacity of 850,000. Sports Interactive used the euphemistic term &quot;Enhancement Packs&quot; to describe patches to fix the bugs in the original release; this term was dropped for future releases.

===&quot;Championship Manager: Season 03/04&quot;===

This was the final &quot;Championship Manager&quot; game to be developed by Sports Interactive before they were forced to start a new franchise under the name &quot;Football Manager&quot;. &quot;Championship Manager 03/04&quot; ironed out many of the problems seen in &quot;Championship Manager 4&quot; and added new features and more new playable leagues to the game.

==&quot;Championship Manager 5&quot;==

This was the first version in the series to be developed in-house by Eidos. Both &quot;Football Manager 2005&quot; and &quot;Championship Manager 5&quot; were to be released in October or November 2004. However, the release date of &quot;Championship Manager 5&quot; was put back by Eidos to March 2005, due to the extent of work required to code the game from scratch. This allowed &quot;Football Manager 2005&quot; a clear run to establish itself ahead of the release of &quot;Championship Manager 5&quot;.

===&quot;Championship Manager&quot; PSP===
&quot;Championship Manager&quot; was released for the PlayStation Portable in December 2005. It was developed by Gusto Games and was the first game in the series to be released on a handheld system.

===&quot;Championship Manager Online&quot;===

This is the first online version of either &quot;Championship Manager&quot; or &quot;Football Manager&quot;, and was launched in UK on 22 February 2005.

==&quot;Championship Manager 2006&quot;==

The follow-up to &quot;Championship Manager 5&quot; was released on PC on 31 March 2006 under the name &quot;Championship Manager 2006&quot;. This version did little to reverse the growing gap in quality between &quot;Championship Manager&quot; and &quot;Football Manager&quot;. Basic features that had been a staple of the latter from over a decade, such as international management, were missing from the boxed version of &quot;Championship Manager 2006&quot;. 10 November 2006 saw the arrival of &quot;Championship Manager 2006&quot; (with &quot;Championship Manager 5&quot; not being ported) on Macintosh. &quot;Championship Manager 2007&quot; was planned for release on the Mac OS X platform in 2007.

==&quot;Championship Manager 2007&quot;==

&quot;Championship Manager 2007&quot; was released on 13 October 2006. Sales continued to be lower than for &quot;Football Manager&quot;.

==&quot;Championship Manager 2008&quot;==

&quot;Championship Manager 2008&quot; was released on 2 November 2008, with users able to play in a multiplayer mode, with more than one person on an account. Also, users can manage nations and can apply &quot;Club Benefactor&quot;, which lets the user have more money, although these additions were added in the previous &quot;Championship Manager&quot;. Another feature is the addition of more leagues – for example, the Australian League – player tendencies and team talks.

== &quot;Championship Manager 2009 Express&quot; ==

==&quot;Championship Manager 2010&quot;==

&quot;Championship Manager 2010&quot; was originally planned for release on 24 April 2009. Eidos Interactive released the game on 11 September 2009. A fully 3D match engine (using motion-captured movements to provide more than 500 animations per player) was implemented for the first time, and it was announced on February 6 that new English Leagues, the Isthmian, Southern and Northern Premier Leagues would be included in the game, as well as Croatian, Romanian, Irish and Northern Irish Leagues. The German league system was also restructured for this edition, including the 3. Liga and 3 Regionalliga. The game was released on 11 September with a demo version being available on the website from 14 August. On 18 August, a &quot;pay what you want for &quot;Championship Manager 2010&quot;&quot; promotion was announced whereby between 18 August and 10 September a digital copy of the game could be pre-ordered from the &quot;Championship Manager&quot; store and was available for download on the day of launch, 10 September. Each customer set the price they were willing to pay in addition to a transaction fee.

==&quot;Championship Manager 2011&quot;==

A version of &quot;Championship Manager 2011&quot; was released for iOS. No later version had been released . It was followed by a period of three years with no &quot;Championship Manager&quot; games, although a new game, &quot;Championship Manager: World of Football&quot; (a collaboration between Beautiful Game Studios and Shanda Games), was announced by Square Enix in July 2011.

==&quot;Champ Man&quot;==
The series was revived as &quot;Champ Man&quot; from 2013 until 2018, developed by Distinctive Developments. &quot;Championship Manager 13/14&quot;, branded as &quot;Champ Man&quot;, was released on 15 October 2013 for mobile phones.&lt;ref name=&quot;Champ Man 13/14&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A follow up to this game, &quot;Champ Man 15&quot;, was released on 18 August 2014 for iOS and Android, &quot;Champ Man 16&quot; was released in September 2015. In 2016, &quot;Championship Manager 17&quot; was released. As of 31 May 2018, Square Enix has ceased all game services for all &quot;Championship Manager&quot; mobile games and removed them from the iOS and Android app stores.

<doc id="376629" wikidata="Q3126838" url="?curid=376629" title="Hannah Cowley (writer)">
<text>Hannah Cowley (14 March 1743 – 11 March 1809) was an English playwright and poet. Although Cowley&#x27;s plays and poetry did not enjoy wide popularity after the 19th century, critic Melinda Finberg rates her as &quot;one of the foremost playwrights of the late eighteenth century&quot; whose &quot;skill in writing fluid, sparkling dialogue and creating sprightly, memorable comic characters compares favourably with her better-known contemporaries, Goldsmith and Sheridan.&quot; Cowley&#x27;s plays were produced frequently in her lifetime. The major themes of her plays – including her first, &quot;The Runaway&quot; (1776), and her major success, which is being revived, &quot;The Belle&#x27;s Stratagem&quot; (1780) – revolve around marriage and how women strive to overcome the injustices imposed by family life and social custom.

==Early success==
Born Hannah Parkhouse, she was the daughter of Hannah (née Richards) and Philip Parkhouse, a bookseller in Tiverton, Devon. Sources disagree about some details of her married life, citing her marriage date as either 1768 or 1772 and claiming she had either three or four children. Shortly after her marriage to Thomas Cowley, the couple moved to London, where Thomas worked as an official in the Stamp Office and as a part-time journalist.

The introduction to her 1813 collected works gives an account of how Cowley was struck by a sudden desire to write while attending a play with her husband. &quot;So delighted with this?&quot; she boasted to him. &quot;Why I could write as well myself!&quot; Thomas teased her, but by the middle of the next day Cowley showed him the first act of her comedy &quot;The Runaway&quot;. If the substance of the story is true, this visit to the theatre could have occurred no later than 1775, for the rest of &quot;The Runaway&quot; was written, sent to the actor-manager David Garrick and produced at Drury Lane theatre by 15 February 1776.

&quot;The Runaway&quot; enjoyed 17 performances in its first season at Drury Lane and 39 in London by 1800, a success that encouraged Cowley to write more, though her mentor Garrick retired after the 1776 season. She wrote her next two plays, the farce &quot;Who&#x27;s the Dupe?&quot; and the tragedy &quot;Albina&quot;, before the year was out.

==Controversy with Hannah More==
&quot;Who&#x27;s the Dupe?&quot; and &quot;Albina&quot; encountered difficulties in production. The new manager of Drury Lane, Richard Brinsley Sheridan, shelved &quot;The Runaway&quot; for most of the 1777 season. Miffed, Cowley sent &quot;Albina&quot; to Drury Lane&#x27;s rival theatre in London, Covent Garden, but it met with no better reception there and the script alternated between the theatres for the next two years. Meanwhile, Sheridan agreed to produce &quot;Who&#x27;s the Dupe?&quot;, but delayed its 1779 première until late spring, an unprofitable time for a new play to open.

The production of &quot;Albina&quot; generated public controversy for Cowley. While this play was bouncing between Drury Lane and Covent Garden, writer Hannah More&#x27;s plays &quot;Percy&quot; (1777) and &quot;The Fatal Falsehood&quot; (1779) opened at Covent Garden. Watching &quot;Percy&quot; aroused Cowley&#x27;s suspicions: &quot;Fatal Falsehood&quot; confirmed Cowley&#x27;s belief that More had plagiarised from &quot;Albina&quot;.

As Cowley later wrote in her preface to the printed edition of &quot;Albina&quot;, hers and More&#x27;s plays do indeed have &quot;wonderful resemblances&quot;. &quot;Fatal Falsehood&quot;&#x27;s opening on 6 May 1779, was followed by press charges (perhaps written by Thomas Cowley) that More stole her ideas from Cowley. On 10 August, More wrote to the &quot;St. James Chronicle&quot; to protest that she &quot;never saw, heard, or read, a single line of Mrs. Cowley&#x27;s Tragedy.&quot; In her preface to &quot;Albina&quot;, Cowley allows that the theatre managers, who in those days doubled as script editors, may have inadvertently given More her ideas: &quot;Amidst the croud of Plots, and Stage Contrivances, in which a Manager is involv&#x27;d, &quot;recollection&quot; is too frequently mistaken for the suggestions of &quot;imagination&quot;&quot; [emphasis in original].

Although she continued to enjoy a brilliant literary career, More wrote no more for the stage after her paper war with Cowley. &quot;Albina&quot; finally opened on 31 July 1779 at the Haymarket, a summer theatre more practised in staging comedies. It was neither a financial nor a critical success.

==Later career==
With the Hannah More controversy behind her, Cowley wrote her most popular and enduring comedy, &quot;The Belle&#x27;s Stratagem&quot;, which was produced at Covent Garden in 1780. It was performed 28 nights in its first season and 118 times in London before 1800, a respectable success that consolidated her family&#x27;s financial position.

Her next play, &quot;The World as it Goes; or, a Party at Montpelier&quot; (later entitled &quot;Second Thoughts Are Best&quot;) was a flop, but she continued to write until 1794, seeing seven more plays into production: &quot;Which is the Man?&quot;, &quot;A Bold Stroke for a Husband&quot;, &quot;More Ways Than One&quot;, &quot;A School for Greybeards, or, The Mourning Bride&quot;, &quot;The Fate of Sparta, or, The Rival Kings&quot;, &quot;A Day in Turkey, or, The Russian Slaves&quot;, and &quot;The Town Before You&quot;. None of these matched the success of her earlier plays.

In 1783, Thomas Cowley accepted a job with the British East India Company. He moved to India and left Hannah in London to raise their children; Thomas died there in 1797, never having returned to England.

==Cowley&#x27;s poetry==
Hannah Cowley had a less distinguished career as a poet, writing &quot;The Scottish Village, or Pitcairne Green&quot; in 1786, and &quot;The Siege of Acre: an Epic Poem&quot; in 1801. In the summer of 1787, under the pseudonym &quot;Anna Matilda,&quot; she and the poet Robert Merry (writing as Della Crusca) began a poetic correspondence in the pages of the journal &quot;The World&quot;. Their poems were sentimental and flirtatious. At first each did not even know the other&#x27;s identity; later they met and became part of a poetic movement called the Della Cruscans. Literary history has not been kind to Della Cruscan poetry, which was criticised as sloppy and emotional. Merry was the subject of a satirical poem, &quot;The Baviad&quot;, written by a contemporary, William Gifford. Cowley&#x27;s poetry was published as &quot;The Poetry of Anna Matilda [pseud.] Containing A Tale for Jealousy, The Funeral, Her Correspondence with Della Crusca [pseud.] and Several Other Poetical Pieces. To Which Are Added Recollections, Printed from an Original Manuscript, Written by General Sir William Waller&quot; (London: J. Bell, 1788).

Cowley&#x27;s last play, &quot;The Town Before You&quot;, was produced in 1795. In 1801, Cowley retired to Tiverton, Devon, where she spent her remaining years away from the public spotlight, quietly revising her plays. She died of liver failure in 1809.

==Major plays==
===&quot;The Runaway&quot; (1776)===
George Hargrave, who is home from college, is overjoyed to learn that Emily, the mysterious runaway whom his godfather, Mr. Drummond, has taken in, is the same young lady he fell in love with at a recent masquerade. Meanwhile, George&#x27;s spirited cousin, Bella, helps George&#x27;s sister, Harriet, and George&#x27;s friend Sir Charles fall in love. George&#x27;s designs are threatened when he learns that his father wants George to marry Lady Dinah, a pretentious older lady who is also very rich. When Emily&#x27;s father arrives to take Emily back to London, George gives chase and snatches Emily back. Mr. Drummond saves the day by offering the young lovers some of his land so that they can have a fortune of their own.

===&quot;Who&#x27;s the Dupe?&quot; (1779)===
Granger, a captain, arrives in town to see his lover, Elizabeth. Her uneducated father, Abraham Doiley, has promised her hand to the most educated man he can find, an unappealing but intelligent scholar named Gradus. Elizabeth&#x27;s friend Charlotte, who fancies Gradus for herself, persuades Gradus to act more fashionable and less bookish so that he can win Elizabeth&#x27;s heart. Doiley is not impressed by the new Gradus; meanwhile, Granger presents himself to Doiley as a scholar so that he can win Elizabeth&#x27;s hand. Granger and Gradus square off against each other to see who is the more educated, and Granger wins by using phony Greek that nonetheless impresses Doiley. Gradus is consoled by winning Charlotte.

===&quot;Albina&quot; (1779)===
The powerful Duke of Westmorland learns that the gallant young soldier Edward is in love with his daughter, Albina, who is a young widow to Count Raimond. Despite her love for Edward, Albina&#x27;s virtue impedes her from agreeing to marry him. Westmorland and Edward persuade her to remarry because Edward is soon destined to go off to war; she agrees. Editha, who is jealous of Albina, seeks help from Lord Gondibert, Raimond&#x27;s brother, who secretly loves Albina. On the eve of the wedding, Gondibert tells Edward that Albina has been unfaithful, and to prove it he disguises himself and allows Edward to spy on him sneaking into Albina&#x27;s chamber at night. Edward then calls off the wedding, and the furious Westmorland challenges him to a duel to protect Albina&#x27;s honour. Before the duel begins, Gondibert&#x27;s elderly servant, Egbert, exposes his master&#x27;s lie, and the king banishes Gondibert. Before he leaves, Gondibert vows to kill Albina and then commit suicide. He sneaks into Albina&#x27;s chamber and stabs a woman he thinks is Albina, and then he stabs himself. But the woman turns out to be a disguised Editha, who had also stolen into the room. Edward is relieved when the real Albina rushes into the room, and the dying Gondibert asks for and receives her pardon.

===&quot;The Belle&#x27;s Stratagem&quot; (1780)===
Having returned from his trip to Europe, the handsome Doricourt meets his betrothed, Letitia. He finds her acceptable but by no means as elegant as European women. Determined that she will not marry without love, Letitia enlists the help of her father, Mr. Hardy, and Mrs. Racket, a widow, to turn Doricourt off the wedding by pretending that she, Letitia, is an unmannerly hoyden. Meanwhile, Doricourt&#x27;s friend Sir George is being overprotective of his new wife, Lady Frances, who rebels and agrees to accompany Mrs. Racket for a day in the town and a masquerade ball that night. While out at an auction, Lady Frances meets the rake, Courtall, who brags to his friend Saville that he will seduce her. Meanwhile, Letitia&#x27;s brazen acting succeeds in dissuading Doricourt from wanting to marry her. All characters converge at that night&#x27;s masquerade. The disguised Letitia shows off her charms, bewitches Doricourt and then leaves before he can find out who she is. Courtall, disguised the same way as Sir George, lures the lady he thinks is Lady Frances back to his house. However, Saville has replaced the real Lady Frances with a prostitute who wears the same disguise as Lady Frances. Shamed, Courtall leaves town. The next day, Doricourt, who has been told that Mr. Hardy is on his deathbed, visits him and reluctantly agrees to marry Letitia after all. Then the disguised Letitia enters and reveals her true identity to the overjoyed Doricourt, who also learns that Hardy was not ill after all.

===&quot;A Bold Stroke for a Husband&quot; (1783)===
Set in Madrid, the play tells of Don Carlo, who has fled his wife, Victoria, for the courtesan Laura. Laura breaks off with Don Carlo, but she holds on to the documents that entitle her to his land, a gift he foolishly gave her. We learn that Laura is in love with Florio, who is really Victoria disguised as a young man. Meanwhile, Victoria&#x27;s friend Olivia is resisting efforts by her father, Don Caesar, to marry her off to a series of suitors. In desperation, Don Caesar pretends that he will marry and young girl and then send Olivia off to a convent unless she marries right away. Victoria persuades Olivia&#x27;s servant to disguise himself as her rich uncle, the original owner of the land that Laura now holds. He convinces Laura that the titles are worthless, so in a rage she rips them up. Victoria reveals herself to Don Carlos, who repents and pledges himself to her again. Meanwhile, Olivia marries Julio, the man she wanted all along.

<text>Sports Interactive Limited is a British video game developer based in London, best known for the &quot;Football Manager&quot; series. Founded by brothers Oliver and Paul Collyer in July 1994, the studio was acquired in 2006 by Sega, a Japanese video game publisher, and became part of Sega Europe. In addition to its work on &quot;Football Manager&quot;, the studio has also created a number of other sports-management simulations, including &quot;NHL Eastside Hockey Manager&quot; and &quot;Championship Manager Quiz&quot;, and is the former developer of &quot;Championship Manager&quot;.

==History==
Founded by Paul Collyer and Oliver Collyer, the company is commonly abbreviated to SI amongst fans of their games. In 2003, Sports Interactive split with former publisher Eidos Interactive and signed a deal with Sega to continue their flagship sports franchise under the new name &quot;Football Manager&quot;. After the split, both parties kept their intellectual property. Sports Interactive kept the base code, the game database and programming of the game, whilst Eidos kept the rights to the &quot;Championship Manager&quot; franchise.

On 28 June 2012, Miles Jacobson and Ian Livingstone revealed why they split from Eidos Interactive and joined Sega. In a chat with GameHorizon, Jacobson thought that Beautiful Game Studios was brought in to take over &quot;Championship Manager&quot;, whilst Livingstone thought that Eidos Interactive brought Beautiful Game Studios to protect the firm in case Sports Interactive jumped ship. Jacobson commented, saying, &quot;I&#x27;m sure there are two sides to this story, at the time we felt there was a lack of respect that we did for our work from Eidos. There seemed to be an attitude at the time in the industry that anyone could make games.&quot; He continued by saying, &quot;Eidos wanted more control. We wanted more control. We were asking for high royalties. Eidos set up Beautiful Game Studios nine months before &quot;Championship Manager 4&quot; was due to come out. They told me that BGS were making a platform game. I thought our number was up.&quot; He then further elaborated by saying, &quot;I went for a curry with the CEO of Sega in Japan and Europe, and he made me an offer on a napkin, I kept telling them we were not for sale. I told them they would have to double the offer for me to even discuss it with Paul and Oliver Collyer.&quot; On 4 April 2006, it was announced that Sega Holdings Europe Ltd, holding company for Sports Interactive&#x27;s publisher&#x27;s Sega, had acquired Sports Interactive. When Sega acquired the company, it had 34 employees.

In 2018, Sports Interactive relocated from Old Street in Islington to the Here East development in Stratford. Now occupying half of the first floor in the Press Centre, the studio has 285 permanent employees in addition to more than 1,400 researchers worldwide for its &quot;Football Manager&quot; games. The studio is closely linked with War Child and has donated a percentage of each game sale directly to the charity since 2006, an initiative that has raised a total of more than £1.5 million. The studio has begun developing partnerships with leading football clubs and other organisations in recent years. These include Manchester City F.C., Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C., Brentford F.C., Burnley F.C., Venezia FC, and Stormzy&#x27;s project Merky FC. On 29 May 2024, the studio launched a rebrand. Done in conjunction with design practice Monday Nights, the most significant element was the studio updating its logo for the first time since 2004.

<text>The Dniester ( ) is a transboundary river in Eastern Europe. It runs first through Ukraine and then through Moldova (from which it more or less separates the breakaway territory of Transnistria), finally discharging into the Black Sea on Ukrainian territory again.

== Names ==
The name &quot;Dniester&quot; derives from Sarmatian &quot;dānu nazdya&quot; &quot;the close river&quot;. (The Dnieper, also of Sarmatian origin, derives from the opposite meaning, &quot;the river on the far side&quot;.) Alternatively, according to Vasily Abaev &quot;Dniester&quot; would be a blend of Scythian &quot;dānu&quot; &quot;river&quot; and Thracian &quot;Ister&quot;, the previous name of the river, literally Dān-Ister (River Ister). The Ancient Greek name of Dniester, &quot;Tyras&quot; (Τύρας), is from Scythian &quot;tūra&quot;, meaning &quot;rapid&quot;.

The names of the Don and Danube are also from the same Iranian word &quot;*dānu&quot; &quot;river&quot;. Classical authors have also referred to it as &quot;Danaster.&quot; These early forms, without -&quot;i&quot;- but with -&quot;a&quot;-, contradict Abaev&#x27;s hypothesis. Edward Gibbon refers to the river both as the Niester and Dniester in his &quot;History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;.

In Ukrainian, it is known as (translit. &quot;Dnister&quot;), in Romanian as , in Russian as (translit. &quot;Dnestr&quot;), in Polish as &quot;Dniestr&quot;, in Yiddish as &quot;Nester&quot; נעסטער; in Turkish as &quot;Turla&quot; (), and in Lithuanian as &quot;Dniestras&quot;.

== Geography ==

The Dniester rises in Ukraine, near the city of Turka, close to the border with Poland, and flows toward the Black Sea. Its course marks part of the border of Ukraine and Moldova, after which it flows through Moldova for , separating the main territory of Moldova from its breakaway region Transnistria. It later forms an additional part of the Moldova-Ukraine border, then flows through Ukraine to the Black Sea, where its estuary forms the Dniester Liman.

Along the lower half of the Dniester, the western bank is high and hilly while the eastern one is low and flat. The river represents the &quot;de facto&quot; end of the Eurasian Steppe. Its most important tributaries are Răut and Bîc.

== History ==
During the Neolithic, the Dniester River was the centre of one of the most advanced civilizations on earth at the time. The Cucuteni–Trypillian culture flourished in this area from roughly 5300 to 2600 BC, leaving behind thousands of archeological sites. Their settlements had up to 15,000 inhabitants, making them among the first large farming communities in the world.
In antiquity, the river was considered one of the principal rivers of European Sarmatia, and it was mentioned by many Classical geographers and historians. According to Herodotus (iv.51) it rose in a large lake, whilst Ptolemy (iii.5.17, 8.1 &amp;c.) places its sources in Mount Carpates (the modern Carpathian Mountains), and Strabo (ii) says that they are unknown. It ran in an easterly direction parallel with the Ister (lower Danube), and formed part of the boundary between Dacia and Sarmatia. It fell into the Pontus Euxinus to the northeast of the mouth of the Ister, the distance between them being 900 stadia – approximately  – according to Strabo (vii.), while (from the &quot;Pseudostoma&quot;) according to Pliny (iv. 12. s. 26). Scymnus (Fr. 51) describes it as of easy navigation, and abounding in fish. Ovid (&quot;ex Pont.&quot; iv.10.50) speaks of its rapid course.

Greek authors referred to the river as &quot;Tyras&quot; (). At a later period it obtained the name of &quot;Danastris&quot; or &quot;Danastus&quot;, whence its modern name of Dniester (Niester), though the Turks still called it &quot;Turla&quot; during the 19th century. The form is sometimes found.

According to Constantine VII, the Varangians used boats on their trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks, along Dniester and Dnieper and along the Black Sea shore. The navigation near the western shore of Black Sea contained stops at Aspron (at the mouth of Dniester), then Conopa, Constantia (localities today in Romania) and Messembria (today in Bulgaria).

From the 14th century to 1812, part of the Dniester formed the eastern boundary of the Principality of Moldavia.

Between the World Wars, the Dniester formed part of the boundary between Romania and the Soviet Union. In 1919, on Easter Sunday, the bridge was blown up by the French Army to protect Bender from the Bolsheviks. During World War II, German and Romanian forces battled Soviet troops on the western bank of the river.

After the Republic of Moldova declared its independence in 1991, the small area to the east of the Dniester that had been part of the Moldavian SSR refused to participate and declared itself the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic, or Transnistria, with its capital at Tiraspol on the river.

In Moldova, the Dniester Day () is celebrated every year in the last Sunday of May.

== Tributaries ==

From source to mouth, right tributaries, i.e. on the southwest side, are the Stryi (), (), (), Bystrytsia (101 km), Răut (), (), Bîc (), and Botna ().

Left tributaries, on the northeast side, are the Strwiąż (), Zubra, Hnyla Lypa (), Zolota Lypa (), Koropets (), Strypa (), Seret (), Zbruch (), Smotrych (), (), (), (), Murafa (), (), (), and Kuchurhan ().

<text>Seth Boyden (November 17, 1788 – March 31, 1870) was an American inventor. Boyden perfected the process for making patent leather, created malleable iron, invented a nail-making machine, and built his own steamboat. He is also credited with having invented a cut off switch for steam engines and a method for producing zinc from ore. At the time of his death, he told friends that he had, even at that time, enough experiments on hand to last two whole lifetimes.

==Early life==
He was born in Foxboro, Massachusetts, on November 17, 1788, the son of Seth Boyden and Susannah Atherton. His father was a farmer and blacksmith. His younger brother was Uriah A. Boyden. His maternal ancestors had resided in Lancaster, Massachusetts, having been pioneer settlers to the area. He is a direct descendant of James Atherton, who arrived in Dorchester, Massachusetts, in the 1630s. The Atherton family ancestry originated from Lancashire, England.

==Career==
He worked as a watchmaker and moved to Newark, New Jersey.

In 1818, Boyden received a piece of German manufactured high-gloss leather (said to be a German military cap front) from a local carriage manufacturer and used that to investigate the possibility of creating a version of leather in the United States that was treated in such a way that the material would be decidedly more dressy than work boots and similar leather goods, but retained its desirable qualities of protection and durability. To reverse engineer the European leather, Boyden set up a shed at the Malleable Cast Iron Foundry of Condit &amp; Bowles at 25 Orange Street in Newark, New Jersey and ultimately discovered a way to produce his own patent leather. Using a formula that was based on a series of treatments using layers of linseed oil-based coats, the new shiny leather began commercial production on September 20, 1819. Boyden&#x27;s efforts resulted in the production of glossy leather that quickly caught on as a complement for formal dress. Despite its name, Boyden never patented his process.

Boyden began his work with malleable iron in 1820, when he was 32 years old. From observing the behavior of iron that stuck to the walls of his grandfather&#x27;s forge, he had developed a theory about the heat treatment of iron. He completed his research in 1826, and won an award (&quot;Premium No. 4&quot;) from the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia two years later, who noted that Boyden&#x27;s annealed cast iron specimen No. 363, containing an assortment of buckles, bits, and other castings, were &quot;remarkable for their smoothness and malleability&quot; and &quot;the first attempt in this country to anneal cast iron for general purposes.&quot; This invention, now called &quot;blackheart iron&quot;, is one of the most important contributions to metallurgy by an American.

Several sources state that Boyden &quot;made the first American daguerreotype&quot; and this statement appears on a plaque at the base of a Boyden statue in Newark&#x27;s Washington Park. While it has long been accepted that D.W. Seager of New York City produced the first daguerreotype in America, it is unclear which other Americans may have been experimenting with the process prior to a public display of Seager&#x27;s daguerreotypes in the Summer of 1839. A daguerrean camera built by Boyden still exists in the collection of the Newark Museum.

Boyden rarely patented his inventions, preferring instead to take individual contracts and to build and sell off businesses. He did make large sums from this, but not enough to support his research and to provide for his old age. During the last 15 years of his life, Boyden lived in near-poverty in Hilton, New Jersey (now Maplewood, New Jersey) and developed a hybrid strawberry known as the Hilton strawberry.

==Honors==
Seth Boyden&#x27;s name is found on an elementary school in Maplewood, New Jersey, and a complex of public housing projects in Newark, New Jersey. (See Seth Boyden housing projects).

Additionally, a statue of Boyden stands in Newark&#x27;s Washington Park. This statue is the first one raised in the United States which honored an engineer.

<doc id="376635" wikidata="Q2426332" url="?curid=376635" title="Thomas Talfourd">
<text>Sir Thomas Noon Talfourd SL (26 May 179513 March 1854) was an English judge, Radical politician and author.

==Early life==
Talfourd was born at Reading, Berkshire, son of Edward Talfourd, a wealthy brewer, and Ann, daughter of Rev. Thomas Noon, a dissenting religious minister in Reading. His father and grandfather were deeply religious; Talfourd himself became a practising Anglican as an adult. He received his education at Hendon and Reading School. At the age of 18, he was sent to London to study law under Joseph Chitty, a special pleader. Early in 1821, he joined the Oxford circuit, having been Called to the Bar at Middle Temple earlier in the year. Fourteen years later, he was created a serjeant-at-law and led the court with William Fry Channell until 1846, when serjeants lost their monopoly of audience. In 1849 he succeeded Thomas Coltman as judge of the Court of Common Pleas.

==In politics==

At the general election in 1835 he was elected MP for the Parliamentary Borough of Reading as a Radical, a result repeated in the general election of 1837. He chose not to stand in the general election of 1841, but stood again in the general election of 1847 and was elected. In the House of Commons, Talfourd introduced a copyright bill in 1837, but the dissolution of Parliament in 1837 following the death of William IV meant that it had to be reintroduced in the new Parliament in 1838. By that time, the bill was met with strong opposition. Talfourd re-introduced it again in 1839, 1840 and 1841. It finally became law in 1842, albeit in modified form, and at a time when Talfourd was not in Parliament. Charles Dickens dedicated &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot; to Talfourd.

== Literary work ==
In his early years in London, Talfourd was dependent in great measure on his literary contributions. He was then on the staff of &quot;The London Magazine&quot;, and was an occasional contributor to the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; and &quot;Quarterly Review&quot;, &quot;The New Monthly Magazine&quot;, and other periodicals; on joining the Oxford circuit, he acted as law reporter to &quot;The Times&quot;. His legal writings on literary matters are excellent expositions, animated by a lucid and telling, if not highly polished, style. Among the best of these are his article &quot;On the Principle of Advocacy in the Practice of the Bar&quot; (in the &quot;Law Magazine&quot;, January 1846); his &quot;Proposed New Law of Copyright of the Highest Importance to Authors&quot; (1838); &quot;Three Speeches delivered in the House of Commons in Favour of an Extension of Copyright&quot; (1840); and &quot;Speech for the Defendant in the Prosecution, the Queen v. Moxon, for the Publication of Shelley&#x27;s Poetical Works&quot; (1841), a celebrated defence of Edward Moxon.

Talfourd&#x27;s tragedy &quot;Ion&quot; was privately printed in 1835 and produced the following year at Covent Garden theatre. It was also well received in America, and was revived at Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre in December 1861. His dramatic poem turns on the voluntary sacrifice of Ion, king of Argos, in response to the Delphic oracle, which had declared that only with the extinction of the reigning family could the prevailing pestilence incurred by the deeds of that family be removed.

Two years later, at the Haymarket Theatre, &quot;The Athenian Captive&quot; was acted with moderate success. In 1839 &quot;Glencoe&quot;, was privately printed, and in 1840 it was produced at the Haymarket. &quot;The Castilian&quot; (1853) did not excite much interest.

Talfourd also wrote:

*&quot;History of Greek Literature&quot;, in the &quot;Encyclopædia Metropolitana&quot;
*&quot;The Letters of Charles Lamb, with a Sketch of his Life&quot; (1837)
*&quot;Recollections of a First Visit to the Alps&quot; (1841)
*&quot;Vacation Rambles and Thoughts, comprising recollections of three Continental tours in the vacations of 1841, 1842, and 1843&quot; (2 vols., 1844)
*&quot;Final Memorials of Charles Lamb&quot; (1849–50)

==Family==
Talfourd married Rachel, daughter of the English political activist and social reformer John Towill Rutt. The barrister and dramatist Francis (&quot;Frank&quot;) Talfourd was their eldest son.

== Death ==
Talfourd died in 1854 in Stafford, after an apoplectic seizure in court while addressing the jury from his judge&#x27;s seat at the town&#x27;s Shire Hall, where he is commemorated by a bust, sculpted by John Graham Lough.

Dickens was amongst the mourners at Talfourd&#x27;s funeral at West Norwood Cemetery. Talfourd Avenue, a residential street in Reading, is named after him.

<doc id="376640" wikidata="Q1874639" url="?curid=376640" title="3rd Carpathian Rifle Division (Poland)">
<text>The 3rd Carpathian Rifle Division (, sometimes translated as &quot;3rd Carpathian Infantry Division&quot;), also commonly known as &quot;Christmas Tree Division&quot; due to the characteristic emblem of a cedar of Lebanon superimposed upon the Polish flag, was an infantry division of the Polish Armed Forces in the West that fought during World War II on the Italian Front. It was formed in 1942 of the Polish Independent Carpathian Brigade and of forces of Lieutenant General Władysław Anders&#x27; Polish 2nd Corps evacuated from the Soviet Union. 

The division participated in the North African and the Italian Campaigns (1941–1945) as part of the British Eighth Army. The division fought in some of the most difficult battles during the Italian campaigns of 1943-1944 and distinguished itself in numerous actions most notably the Battle of Monte Cassino, the dash for Ancona and Bologna.

== The Immediate Post War Period ==
After the cessation of hostilities in May 1945, the men and women of the Polish Armed forces were stationed across Europe. The 3rd Carpathian Division ended the war in Northern Italy and remained there for the next few months while their future was discussed in Moscow, London and Washington. The Divisional officers and troops naturally expected and hoped to return home to Poland however an ominous sign came in July 1945 when the British government withdrew formal recognition of The Polish Government in Exile - based in London as they had been since 1939. This was a portent of things to come and, soon after, the British government recognised the Russian backed government recently installed in Poland and the fate of the Polish nation was sealed. To add insult to injury and, after significant pressure from Stalin, Polish forces were refused permission to participate in the Victory Parade in London held on June 8, 1946 - an insult never forgotten by the men, women and families of the Polish forces. Yalta had already seen considerable swathes of Polish lands ceded to Russia by Churchill, but the British government also had to untangle the problem of what to do with the thousands of Poles already in Great Britain and also the fully armed Divisions in the now West Germany and Italy. In total over 220,000 Poles remained under British command. Should they be forcibly repatriated, it was clear that Stalin and his NKVD would execute many and send even more to Siberia in order to prevent the reformation of opposition to Communist rule in Poland. Members of the 3rd Carpathian Division hoped that a Third World War would result in which case they would return to Poland to fight the Russian occupiers.

According to the Polish Exiles of World War Two website and recent research, the 3rd Carpathian Division is listed as having 27,135 on roll in 1946 and of these 3,386 are also listed as having returned home to Poland after the war with the remaining men and women deciding to start new lives outside their homeland.

== The Polish Resettlement Corps (PRC) ==
Once it became clear that Poland had lost its independence, members of the Polish armed forces began to either return to Communist Poland or stay with their units. The formation of the Polish Resettlement Corps was announced by the Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin in May 1946 and was a strategy to allow those Poles, who had made the heart rending decision not to return to their families, to transfer to Great Britain to start a new life. 110,000 joined the new Corps - mostly members of Polish II Corps - and, having been disarmed, a mass transportation from Italy to Great Britain began using dozens of troop transport ships. The remaining officers, men and women of the 3rd Carpathian Division were divided up into the 160 resettlement camps opened across the United Kingdom. The Corps was commanded by Polish General Stanislaw Kopanski - the former commander of the 3rd Carpathian Division in 1943. 

== The Polish Resettlement Act &amp; The Resettlement of the Division ==
The new Labour government went on to pass the 1947 Polish Resettlement Act which established in law the right of serving members of all Polish forces to stay and become British citizens. The Polish Resettlement Camps become 160 mini Polish nations. Polish schools were established to teach English to adults and children alike, Sports were arranged, Polish cultural life celebrated, gardens were planted and facilities repaired. The advance parties arrived in the autumn of 1946 and during early 1947 the main elements of the division arrived at Brandon Station, Brandon, Suffolk for transportation to their camps. The 3rd Carpathian Division was distributed between numerous camps such as Riddlesworth in Norfolk which became home to 3rd Heavy Machine Gun Bn (3rd Karp. CKM), Hodgemoor Camp in Berkshire (Kw.Gl 3rd DSK), Woodlands Park Camp, Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire which became the new home of a sapper battalion from the 3rd Carpathian Division and London Road Camp in Brandon which was also home to another engineer battalion from the division. On arrival, the camps were a mixture of well maintained and almost derelict having been used for British and American troops during the war and even German prisoner of war camps. 

In recent years a great deal of archival research has been completed and a book published by Zosia Bigus on the entire list of Polish Resettlement Camps.

== Memorials to the Division ==
In Italy and close to Monte Cassino, 1,300 meters north east of the Polish Cemetery, is the 3rd Carpathian Division memorial. Situated on Hill 593, this high obelisk is made of Travertine and is dedicated to the 1,115 men of the 3rd DSK who were killed in the Italian campaign. It has recently been fully restored. 
In the UK, local groups or the families of Polish troops once based there have now erected memorials recording the people who arrived there after World War Two, their sacrifice and dedication to their homeland and to the country that gave them a new home. Examples can be found at Hodgemoor in Buckinghamshire and Brandon and Riddlesworth Camps in Norfolk. The challenges for this first generation of Polish people of adjusting to post war life in a new country and a new language were considerable but many of the Polish families or families with roots to a Polish name can trace their origins back to these events and to this division in 1946 and 1947.

<text>Patent leather is a type of coated leather that has a high-gloss finish.

In general, patent leather is fine grain leather that is treated to give it a glossy appearance. Characterized by a glass-like finish that catches the light, patent leather comes in all colors just like regular leather. In addition to the mirror-like finish, patent leather is also virtually waterproof, while still retaining a very flexible texture. The visual aspects of patent leather have made it a sought-after material for formal accessories.

Patent leather and poromerics are used in applications where an eye-catching glossy appearance is the most important consideration. Examples include fashion items such as wallets and handbags, dance and uniform shoes, thigh-high boots and professional wrestling boots, belts and trench coats. In recent years patent leather has become a popular material for limited-edition sneakers.

Originally a lacquer coating that was based on linseed oil was used, the process was then widely substituted with plastics such as Parkesine. Modern patent leather is typically made with a plastic or synthetic coating. This has also allowed for more colors and patterns available.

Patent leather is sometimes confused with artificial leathers such as DuPont&#x27;s Corfam and Kuraray&#x27;s Clarino, which are artificial materials with a similar glossy appearance.

==History==
An early reference to patent leather is in the 1793 British periodical &quot;The Bee, or Literary Weekly Intelligencer&quot;, which notes, in an article entitled &quot;Hand&#x27;s patent leather&quot;, that &quot;a gentleman of the name of Hand&quot; in Birmingham, England, obtained a patent for preparing flexible leather having a glaze and polish that renders it impervious to water and need only be wiped with a sponge to restore it to its original luster. In November 1799, inventor Edmund Prior, of Holborn, London, England, received a patent for a method of painting and colouring all kinds of leather; and, in January 1805, inventor Charles Mollersten, of Hackney Wick, received a patent for applying a chemical composition in the preparation of hides, skins, and leather to give &quot;a beautiful gloss&quot;. However, patent leather primarily owes its popularity to Seth Boyden.

The coating process was introduced to the United States and improved by inventor Seth Boyden, of Newark, New Jersey, in 1818, with commercial manufacture beginning September 20, 1819. Boyden&#x27;s process, which he did not patent, used a lacquer coating that was based on linseed oil. In 1818, Boyden received a piece of German-made patent leather, said to be a German military cap front, from a local carriage manufacturer and used that to investigate the possibility of creating a version of leather in the United States that was treated in such a way that the material would be decidedly more dressy than work boots and similar leather goods, but retain its desirable qualities of protection and durability. Reverse engineering the European patent leather, he discovered a way to produce his patent leather. Using a series of coating treatments based on linseed oil, the new shiny leather began commercial production on September 20, 1819. Boyden&#x27;s efforts resulted in the production of glossy leather that quickly caught on as a complement to formal dress. Boyden never patented his inventive process.

A subsequent European method of manufacture was described in 1906 as follows:

Later, the substitution of plastics such as Parkesine in lieu of treatments with linseed oil allowed patent leather to be produced more cheaply. Eventually, synthetic resins further simplified the process and cut production costs even further, making mass production of patent leather possible.

In the British fashion trends of the 1960s, shoes, boots, and handbags were often made of patent leather or vinyl. Patent shoes were available in black, yellow, green, orange, hot pink, white, blue and red.

==Product care==

Patent leather and poromerics are cleaned in a similar way. Dirt adhering to the coating can be removed with a damp cloth, using a mild soap if needed. Minor scratches and scuff marks in the coating can be removed using one of several special-purpose patent leather and poromeric cleaners on the market. With wear and tear, patent leather will eventually lose its glossy finish, but will still be smoother than most other types of leather, looking almost rubbery.

Lighter color patent leather is prone to color migration. When a patent item is stored next to a colored item, the dye from the colored item can migrate into the patent leather. Storing patent leather items in a white dust bag will help prevent this.

<text>Sir Joseph William Chitty (28 May 1828 – 15 February 1899) was an English cricketer, rower, judge and Liberal politician.

==Early life==

Chitty was born in London, the second son of Thomas Chitty (himself son and brother of well-known lawyers), a celebrated special pleader and writer of legal textbooks, under whose teaching many distinguished lawyers began their legal education. Joseph Chitty was educated at Eton College and Balliol College, Oxford, gaining a first-class in Literae Humaniores in 1851, and being afterwards elected to a fellowship at Exeter College.

==Sporting distinctions==
Chitty was an all round sportsman with distinctions during his school and college career in athletics. He was a cricket wicket-keeper and played in the Eton v Harrow match in four years, captaining Eton in 1847. He also kept wicket for Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in 1846 and 1847. He played for Oxford University in 1848 and 1849, partaking in the Varsity match each year. Oxford won in 1848, but lost in 1849. In cricket, he played 12 innings in 7 first-class matches with an average of 15.66 and a top score of 20. He took 6 catches and stumped three times.

Chitty rowed in the Oxford University crew in both the Boat Races that were run in 1849, the March race and the December race, each university winning once. He rowed in the Oxford University eight that won the Grand Challenge Cup at Henley Royal Regatta in 1850 when there was no Boat Race on the Tideway. He also rowed in the Oxford coxed four that won the Stewards&#x27; Challenge Cup at Henley and in the same year he won the Silver Goblets, the first year the coxless pair event was run under that name. His partner was James John Hornby and they beat Thomas Howard Fellows and C L Vaughan in the final.

He repeated his success in the Grand Challenge Cup, and in the Silver Goblets in 1851 partnering James Aitken in the latter to beat John Erskine Clarke and C L Vaughan in the final. In 1852, he stroked the winning Oxford crew in the 1852 Boat Race. In 1853 he was in the Oxford four that won Stewards again and was playing cricket for I Zingari. For many years Chitty umpired the Boat Race.

In 1873 Chitty responded to Dr J Morgan, who was investigating the health effects of rowing.

&quot;In answer to your questions, I may state that during my residence at Oxford I rowed in the University Eight against Cambridge three times at Putney, and once at Henley. I also rowed in the University Four, and in Pair-Oar Races at Oxford, Henley and the Thames Regatta. My own personal experience extends over a period of about five years, during a great part of which I was rowing in races. I am not aware that I have in any way suffered in health, either from the training or the rowing; on the contrary, my belief is that I derived from them great benefit physically.&quot;

==Legal and political career==
Chitty entered Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1851, was called to the bar in 1856, and made a Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1874, electing to practise as such in the court of Sir George Jessel, Master of the Rolls.

In 1880, he entered the House of Commons as member for the city of Oxford. His parliamentary career was short, for in 1881 the Judicature Act required that the Master of the Rolls should cease to sit regularly as a judge of first instance, and Chitty was selected to fill the vacancy thus created in the Chancery Division.

Sir Joseph Chitty was for sixteen years a popular judge, in the best meaning of the phrase, being noted for his courtesy, geniality, patience and scrupulous fairness, as well as for his legal attainments, and being much respected and liked by those practising before him, in spite of a habit of interrupting counsel, possibly acquired through the example of Sir George Jessel.

In 1897, upon the retirement of Sir Edward Kay, L.J., he was promoted to the Court of Appeal. There he added to his reputation as a lawyer and a judge, proving that he possessed considerable knowledge of the common law as well as of equity.

== Personal life ==
In 1858, he married Clara Jessie, daughter of Chief Baron Pollock, leaving children who could claim descent from two of the best-known English legal families of the 19th century.

Grandchildren included Letitia Chitty (1897 – 1982) a structural analytical engineer who became the first female fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society.

<text>Marie Huber (4 March 1695 – 13 June 1753) was a Genevan writer on theology and related subjects, as well as a translator and editor, at a time when it was rare for a female writer to write about theology. 

Huber was a proponent of universalism, and was considered by some a deist. Her &quot;Letters Concerning the Religion Essential to Man&quot; (1761) are known to have been read, in translation, by Robert Burns.

She was one of 15 children, and was the great-aunt of François Huber, the naturalist.

It is the oldest surviving manuscript in Ireland, and the second oldest Latin psalter in the world. Its cumdach (a type of ornamented metal reliquary box or carrying case for holy books) dates to the late 11th century, and was refurbished in the 14th and 16th centuries. The shrine belonged to the Chiefs of Clan Ó Domhnaill, the Lords of Tír Chonaill, as a rallying cry and protector in battle.

The Cathach was taken to the continent in 1691 following the Treaty of Limerick, and did not return to Ireland until 1813. That year the cumdach was reopened, leading to the rediscovery of the manuscript. It was by then in very poor condition, but underwent a major restoration in 1982 when the extant pages were rebound and remounted on vellum leaves. However the Cathach remains badly damaged, with just 58 vellum leaves surviving from an original 110.

Today the manuscript (RIA MS 12 R 33) is in the Royal Irish Academy in Dublin and the cumdach is in the archaeology branch of the National Museum of Ireland.

==History==

 was used as a rallying cry and protector in battle. It was said to protect and guarantee victory in war to the Donegal leaders. Before a battle it was customary for a chosen monk or holy man (usually attached to the Clan McGroarty, and someone who was in a state of grace) to wear the Cathach and the cumdach, or book shrine, around his neck and then walk three times sunwise around the warriors of Clan O&#x27;Donnell.

As de facto Chief of the Name of Clan O&#x27;Donnell, the manuscript was inherited by Brigadier-General Daniel O&#x27;Donnell (1666–1735), and was regarded by him, in accordance with its traditional history, as a talisman of victory if carried into battle by any of the Cinel Conaill. He first served King James II during the Williamite War in Ireland and then, following the Treaty of Limerick, General O&#x27;Donnell went into exile in France and served King Louis XIV as an officer in the Irish Brigade. He placed the Cathach in a silver case and deposited it for safety in a Belgian monastery, leaving instructions in his will that it was to be given up to whoever could prove himself Chief of Clan O&#x27;Donnell. Through an Irish abbot it was restored to Sir Neale O&#x27;Donnell, 2nd Baronet, of Newport House, County Mayo, in 1802. His son, Sir Richard Annesley, entrusted the relic to the Royal Irish Academy in 1842. The leaves were stuck together until separated at the British Museum in 1920; the manuscript was further restored in 1980–81.

==Description==
===Manuscript===

The manuscript consists of a Gallican version of the Vulgate version of Psalm 30:13 to 105:13, and is traditionally assumed to have been written by St. Columba (Colum Cille, d. 597). It is dated to 560–600, measures 27 cm x 19, and at present consists of 58 folios; the complete manuscript would have contained around 110 folios.

Decoration is limited to the initial letter of each Psalm. Each initial is created from a thick black line that is larger than the main text and decorated with trumpet, spiral and guilloche patterns. They are often outlined with orange dots, and have areas of the lettering coloured white, madder, pink and orange tinges. The art historian Françoise Henry described the initial as &quot;an essential landmark in the history of insular illumination&quot;, and speculated that the now lost front page &quot;would have been invaluable for our knowledge of Irish illumination&quot;.

The initials are followed by a series of letters that gradually diminish in size before merging with the main text.

Irish manuscripts were typically written in localized scripts. The Cathach written for the most part by a single scribe who used a book hand of round lettering and strong Latin or wedge-serifs on the upright strokes. According to the historian and calligraphier Timothy O&#x27;Neill, the scribe employed an edged rather than pointed quill, which he held at a flat angle &quot;to produce thick downstrokes and thin horizontals&quot;.

===Cumdach (book shrine)===
The specially made cumdach (book shrine) comprises an oblong, hinged wooden box covered with decorative bronze and gilt-silver plates, with mounts holding glass and crystal settings. Prior to this the manuscript would likely have been kept in a type of protective leather satchel known as a &quot;tiag&quot;, similar that made for the 9th century Breac Maodhóg.

The shrine underwent three main phases of construction. The initial work was completed between 1062 and 1098 at Kells, County Meath while the manuscript was in the possession of the O&#x27;Donnells and was their chief relic. A new main face in gilt repoussé was added between 1350 and 1375 with a large seated Christ in Majesty flanked on the right by a Crucifixion scene, and by a saint (likely Columba) on the left. Further embellishments and repair works were carried out in the 16th century, and again in 1723 while it under the care of Daniel O&#x27;Donel while he was in Paris.

The cumdach has been in continuous use since its earliest construction, including by its hereditary keepers, the Magroarty family, of Ballymagrorty, County Donegal, one of whom was killed in 1497 when the shrine was captured. It is today in the collection of the National Museum of Ireland.

====Side panels====
The long and short side panels contain inserts and mounts of different phases. The long sides mostly consist of contain traditional animal ornaments and abstract designs. The dominant mounts on the short sides contain more sophisticated patterns influenced by the Ringerike style of Viking art.

====Inscriptions====
The shrine contains a number of inscriptions, although the lettering is badly damaged in places, the wording contains misspellings and contractions, and they were modified or added to at later dates. Written in Irish and placed clockwise along the borders of the reverse of back of the shrine (beginning at top-left), they are signed by its goldsmith, Sitric Mc Meic Aeda (Sitric, son of Meic Aeda), who records that he built the shrine under the instruction of Domnall Mac Robartaigh (an abbot at Kells who had retired before his death in 1094, but is described in the inscription as &quot;successor of Kells”), who in turn was under the commission and payment of Cathbarr Ua Domnaill.

The full inscription has been translates as:
:&quot;A prayer for Cathbarr Ua Domnaill who had this shrine made
:and for Sitric son of Mac Aeda who made [it] 
:and for Domnall Mac Robartaig, coarb of Kells, by whom it was made&quot;.

Nothing is known of Sitric outside of a record that his father worked as a craftsman at Kells. Given the number of misspellings and lack of consistency in the script, it has been suggested that Sitric was illiterate and was simply transcribed a script given to him.

<text>Dexbrompheniramine/pseudoephedrine (trade name Drixoral) is a combination medication that contains the antihistamine dexbrompheniramine maleate and the decongestant pseudoephedrine sulfate. It was used to treat symptoms associated with allergies and colds such as itchy and watery eyes, runny nose, nasal and sinus congestion, and sneezing. Because it contains pseudoephedrine, its purchase in the United States was severely restricted by the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005 over fears that any product containing pseudoephedrine can be used to make methamphetamine. 

==Availability==
As of 2008, Drixoral was removed from the US market by manufacturer Merck. The company&#x27;s updated website attributes &quot;changing [their] manufacturing location&quot; for the supply disruption and currently states &quot;it is unlikely product will be available in 2010&quot;. However, the trade name Drixoral is now used in Canada for an oxymetazoline hydrochloride nasal spray.

==Commercials==
Drixoral was a very popular cold relief medicine advertised on U.S. television in the 1980s. Many of their commercials were narrated by Burgess Meredith.

<text>Lismore (, possibly meaning &quot;great enclosure&quot; or &quot;garden&quot;) is an island of around in the Inner Hebrides of Scotland. The climate is damp and mild, with over of rain recorded annually. This fertile, low-lying island was once a major centre of Celtic Christianity, with a 6th-century monastery associated with Saint Moluag, and later became the seat of the medieval Bishop of Argyll. There are numerous ruined structures, including a broch and two 13th-century castles.

During the 19th century, various new industries were introduced, including lime quarrying. During the early decades of the 20th century, the population exceeded 1,000, but this was followed by a lengthy decline. Although resident numbers are now less than 200, there was a small increase from 2001 to 2011. About a third of the population were recorded as Gaelic-speaking at the former date. The modern economy is largely based on farming, fishing and tourism, and the largest settlement is Achnacroish. Various shipwrecks have been recorded in the vicinity.

==Etymology==
In the Gaelic name, &quot;lios&quot; means &quot;garden&quot; or &quot;enclosure&quot;, and &quot;mòr&quot; is simply &quot;big&quot; or &quot;great&quot;, reflecting either the fertility of the island amidst mountainous surroundings, or the presence of a defined area surrounding the early monastery. One of the earliest English language references is to &quot;Lismoir&quot;, recorded in the 16th century.

Achnacroish is from &quot;Achadh na Croise&quot; and means &quot;the field of the cross&quot;. The other small settlements are Clachan (village with a church) and Port Ramsay, opposite Eilean Ramsay (Ramsay&#x27;s isle). Most of the surrounding islets have descriptive names, such as Eilean Dubh (black island), Eilean nan Gamhna (isle of the stirks) and Pladda (flat island, from Old Norse).

== Geology ==
Lismore is formed almost wholly from rocks of the Neoproterozoic age Lismore Limestone Formation, which is ascribed to the Blair Atholl Subgroup of the Appin Group within the Dalradian sequence. There are also some minor graphitic pelites (sometimes described as &#x27;interbedded black slate&#x27;, within the formation. The limestone country rock is intruded by a handful of NE-SW aligned lamprophyre dykes of Silurian to early Devonian age associated with the Strontian Granite Complex and by large numbers of NW-SE aligned dykes of dolerite and basalt of Palaeogene age along with a rather fewer number assigned to the ‘Loch Scridain Suite.

Quaternary deposits include glacial till and peat alongside some small patches of alluvium (clay, silt, sand and gravel) which occupy lower ground. Around the margins of Lismore are modern beach deposits and raised marine deposits of clay, silt and sand, the latter being a product of varying relative sea-levels during the Holocene epoch. The whole of Scotland was subjected to glaciation during the Pleistocene epoch. A sign of this on Lismore is the presence of rock-cut platforms close to the seashore that indicate the changing sea-levels; in some areas of the northern coast, they also betray the presence of ice by the striation marks on the rocks.

==Geography==

The island of Lismore lies in Loch Linnhe, north east of Mull, in the Argyll and Bute council area. It is long and about wide and oriented from SW to NE, roughly parallel to the Great Glen Fault. To the east is an arm of Loch Linnhe known as the Lynn of Lorn. Composed almost entirely of limestone, Lismore has fertile soil and an abundance of trees and shrubs, including ash and sycamore. The topography consists of sheltered furrows of land between raised areas that run longitudinally up the island&#x27;s spine.

The area of the island is and the highest elevation is Barr Mòr in the south above Kilcheran, which reaches only . (Haswell-Smith ranks Lismore as the 50th offshore Scottish island by height).

There are several small lochs on the island, the largest of which are Loch Fiart in the southwest, Kilcheran Loch further northeast, and Loch Baile a&#x27; Ghobhainn another northeast, north of Achnacroish. These three water bodies form the Lismore Lochs Special Area of Conservation, a status which is accorded as they are amongst the best examples in Scotland of lochs on a limestone substrate. The alkaline waters are very clear and low in nutrients and support the rare &quot;Chara&quot; stoneworts &quot;C. rudis&quot; and &quot;C. curtis&quot;. &quot;C. pedunculata&quot; has also been recorded. The lochs lie longitudinally down the island and are of roughly similar size. The total surface area of all three combined is about , and they are inhabited by trout.

Lismore is part of the ancient district of Lorne and is said to lie &quot;in the cockpit&quot; of this territory. In the modern day, it is at the heart of the &quot;Lynn of Lorn National Scenic Area&quot;, one of forty such areas in Scotland, which have been defined so as to identify areas of exceptional scenery and to ensure its protection from inappropriate development. 
The national scenic areas cover 15,726 ha, of which 10,088 ha are marine seascape, and includes the whole of Lismore, along with neighbouring areas on the mainland such as Benderloch and Port Appin, and the Shuna Island.

The views from Barr Mòr, the island&#x27;s highest point, are superlative. Although Barr Mòr is only of modest height, from there &quot;the skyscape is vast and made so not by its emptiness, but by the throng of high and pointed hills lifting out of the glittering seas and islands. Nowhere else on the Highland coast can you enjoy a view of the mountainous mainland to equal this one.&quot;

The offshore islets of Eilean na Cloich and Eilean Dubh in the Lynn of Lorn and Bernera and Dubh Sgeir in the Lynn of Morvern to the west and Eilean Gainimh to the NE are extensively used by common seals and form the &quot;Eileanan agus Sgeirean Lios mòr&quot; Special Area of Conservation. The whole island of Bernera is also an SSSI, its limestone maritime cliffs being a key feature along with the presence of the nationally scarce rock whitebeam. Creag Island and Pladda are other islets in the Lynn of Lorn. Eilean nan Caorach, Inn Island, Eilean Droineach and Eilean Ramsay are amongst another cluster of small islands off the north coast, and Eilean Loch Oscair is to the NW. Lismore Lighthouse, built by Robert Stevenson, lies on the small island of Eilean Musdile to the south west, with Lady&#x27;s Rock a kilometre further away in the same direction.

==Climate==
Lismore has a maritime climate with cool summers and mild winters. The nearest official Met Office weather station for which online records are available is Dunstaffnage on the mainland north of Oban.

==Prehistory==

There are various Bronze Age cairns on the island. Tirefour Castle is an Iron Age broch of an uncertain date that is a prominent landmark on Lismore&#x27;s east coast. The walls have an average thickness of , enclosing a circular court about in diameter. The wall still stands high and reaches in the south east. There is a second possible broch site at An Dùn, SW of Loch Fiart, and these are amongst the most southerly examples of these enigmatic fortifications. There are also various duns on the island that may date to the 1st or 2nd centuries AD.

==History==
===Early Christianity and Scandinavian influence===
Lismore was an important centre of Celtic Christianity from an early date. The &quot;Iona Chronicle&quot; records the death of Mo-Luóc (also known as Moluag), who was probably abbot of the Lismore monastery in 594, and of his successors Neman in 613 and Eochaid in 637. There is, however, no reason to suppose that this was a daughter house of Columba&#x27;s abbey on Iona itself. Lismore probably maintained its status as the principal religious house of the Cenél Loairn during the remainder of the 7th century and the deaths of abbots Iarnlaigh c. 700, Colmán in 704 and Crónán ua Eoain in 718 are recorded in the &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot;. Five further such obituaries are recorded in the latter half of the 8th century.

Lismore was part of the kingdom of Dalriada in the 6th century and probably thereafter until the arrival of the Vikings in the late 8th century, after which it is likely the island was absorbed into the Norse-Gael Kingdom of the Isles. Magnus Barelegs had established direct Norwegian overlordship over this sprawling sea kingdom by 1098. In that year, Edgar of Scotland signed a treaty with Magnus which settled much of the boundary between the Scots and Norwegian claims in these islands. Edgar formally acknowledged the existing situation by giving up his claims to the Hebrides but there were a few exceptions including Luing and Lismore, which were retained by the Scots.

===Medieval period===

Lismore later became the seat of the medieval Bishopric of Argyll. Before the late 12th century the Bishopric of Dunkeld included all of Argyll, but sometime between 1183 and 1193 they were separated, as apparently the then Bishop John Scotus was unable to speak Gaelic. Lismore became the seat of the new bishop, and he and his successors were known as &quot;Episcopi Lismorenses&quot; but a papal mandate in 1249 proposed that the seat be transferred to &quot;some more secure and accessible place&quot;. At least by 1268, Laurence de Ergadia became Bishop of Argyll and served in that position until his death in 1299.

In the event St Moluag&#x27;s cathedral at Clachan maintained its position until 1507, when the diocese&#x27;s centre was moved to Saddell in Kintyre. It was burned down during the Reformation and only the choir survives in greatly altered form, the nave and western tower having been reduced to their foundations. There is also evidence of an enclosure, probably medieval.

The ruins of Coeffin Castle stand on the summit of a rocky promontory on the coast west of Clachan. There is the outline of an oblong hall-house, which may be 13th century, and an irregularly shaped bailey, likely of a later date. A tidal fish trap, of unknown age, is located in the small bay to the south-east of the castle. To the north-east of the castle are the remains of a stone-walled fort.
The remains of Achanduin Castle west of Achnacroish is also thought to date back to the 13th century. Built by the MacDougalls around 1290, who held it throughout the 14th century, the castle is then thought to have been held by the Bishops of Argyll until the mid 16th century. The castle overlooks the island of Bernera.

In the 16th century Donald Monro provided a brief description of the island in Scots: (&quot;Lismore, an isle where lead ore is, opposite Duart. This isle is four miles long, with a parish church on it&quot;.) Monro&#x27;s &quot;Description of the Western Isles of Scotland&quot; also mentions Eilean Droineach and Eilean Ramsay. He stated that both were &quot;good for corn and store&quot; and had many &quot;Elders and thorns&quot; and that Eilean Droineach was the &quot;habitation of Bishops and Nobles in auld times&quot;. However, the view of Munro (1961) is that this last comment more properly applies to the larger &quot;Ramsay Isle&quot;.

Lismore is the home of the Clan MacLea, who claim kinship with the Livingstone family, and who were recognised by the Lord Lyon in 2002. The &quot;Plod nam Baran&quot;, which is adjacent to the site of Saint Moluag&#x27;s church, may be the burial ground of its clan chiefs, or &quot;barons&quot;. The current chief, Niall Livingstone of Bachuil, is the &quot;Coarb of Saint Moluag&quot; and since the 16th century or earlier, the chiefs have been hereditary keepers of the saint&#x27;s crozier or pastoral staff known as the &quot;Bachuil Mòr&quot;.

===18th to 20th centuries===

In 1707, the Acts of Union merged England and Scotland, and Lismore became part of the Kingdom of Great Britain. Thereafter taxes on whisky distillation rose dramatically, and much of Scotland&#x27;s distillation was either shut down or forced underground until the 1823 Excise Act provided a legal framework for the industry. The remains of at least two illicit stills from this period have been found on Lismore.

In 1749 the ruins of the old cathedral were trimmed down from their remaining height, given a roof and turned into a parish church with a bell tower.
In the 19th century lime was quarried, particularly on the west coast. The ruined remains of the quarriers&#x27; cottages can still be seen on Eilean nan Caorach and Inn Island, and old lime kilns can be seen at Sailean, Port na Moralachd and Port Ramsay; the last lime was produced in 1934. The remains of another two kilns can be seen at Kilcheran near Lismore Seminary, a Roman Catholic divinity school that was in operation from 1803 to 1828 at a time when the other inhabitants of the island were staunchly Presbyterian.

John Stuart McCaig, the architect of McCaig&#x27;s Tower in Oban, was born on Lismore in the 19th century as was the folklorist Alexander Carmichael. Overlooking Lismore Bay is a Celtic Cross, a memorial to Waverley Arthur Cameron, the son of Duncan Cameron, inventor of the &quot;Waverley&quot; nib pen and the owner of &quot;The Oban Times&quot; newspaper. Waverley was drowned in 1891 when his yacht foundered off the coast nearby.

There have been various other shipwrecks in the vicinity. In 1889 the paddle steamer &quot;Mountaineer&quot; lived up to its name by clambering onto Lady&#x27;s Rock, the damage to which was still visible in 1995. In 1905 the MacBrayne steamship &quot;Clydesdale&quot; hit the same obstruction in a Force 6 wind. The harbour patrol craft &quot;Appletree&quot; was sunk in a collision with an RAF pinnace east of the Lismore light in October 1940 with, according to one report, the loss of two lives. The trawler MFV &quot;Solway Firth&quot; foundered south of this position in 1977.

Lismore, like other Hebridean islands, has suffered from depopulation since the 19th century, in large part due to the Clearances. In 1798 there were 900 people living on the island and 1399 by 1841. Over the next 40 years the population more than halved to 621. By 1961 there were only 155 residents, and by the time of the 1991 census there were just 140. There are various examples of abandoned townships, such as Coille nam Bard. In the 2001 census, the population had risen slightly to 146, over 45% of whom were over 60 years old, making it the Scottish island with the oldest population.

==Present day==
The island&#x27;s population was recorded as 192 at the 2011 census, an increase of over 30% since 2001. During the same period Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4% to 103,702. The majority of the resident working population are engaged in farming or fishing, and sheep raised on the island have a reputation for quality. Majority of the land is owner occupied.

Prior to 2007 there was no mains supply of drinking water on the island, water being supplied instead from wells and springs. In that year the then Scottish Executive announced plans for a mains supply to be provided at a cost of £1 million: a pipe was laid under Loch Linnhe and work was to begin on laying about of pipes across Lismore. However, Scottish Water later decided to supply water from boreholes instead.

The island is linked to the mainland by two ferries: a Caledonian MacBrayne vehicle ferry making the crossing to Oban and a council passenger ferry making the shorter crossing from Point, at the north-eastern tip of the island, to Port Appin. The B8045 is the main road on the island, which it traverses from beyond Kilcheran in the SW, to Point in the NE.

Facilities on Lismore include a shop which is also a post office, and a café. Bicycles may be hired at Point. Explore Lismore provide Land Rover Tours and the island&#x27;s only taxi service. There is no petrol filling station. In 2001 29% of the population of the island spoke Gaelic and maintaining this heritage is one of the aims of the &quot;Comann Eachdraidh Lios Mòr&quot;, the Lismore Gaelic Heritage Centre.

Lismore is part of the multi-member ward of Oban, Lorn and the Isles in the Argyll and Bute council area. The island is represented by Jenni Minto of the SNP at the Holyrood Parliament in Edinburgh who was elected for the Argyll and Bute constituency in 2011, and by Brendan O&#x27;Hara of the SNP at the Westminster parliament in London.

In 2023, the sole shop on the island, which is also the post office, was threatened with closure because the person running it had decided to return to school teaching. The Lismore Community Trust, a local charitable organisation, organised a campaign to keep it open, and with the help of residents, holiday home owners and tourists raised more than their target of £70,000 to do so.

==Myths and culture==
&quot;The Piper&#x27;s Cave&quot; is a local story about a piper and his dog. According to Alexander Carmichael, the piper entered the Uamh-Chraidh (the &quot;cave of pain&quot;) and intended to exit through the Uamh-an-duine (the &quot;cave of the man&quot;). The sounds of his bagpipes could be heard throughout the island. When the piping ceased the dog emerged sightless and hairless but the piper was presumed to have drowned in one of the cave&#x27;s impassable pools and was never seen again. His lament is recorded as:

:&quot;Mis air airin baidh &#x27;us burrail&quot;            I was drowning and howling
:&quot;Measg nan glumag eagalaich&quot;             Amongst the horrid pools

Another story has St Moluag and St Mulhac conducting a boat race across the Lynn of Lorn with the first to land on Lismore having the right to found a monastery there. Realising that he was going to lose, Moluag cut off his finger and threw it ashore north of the broch of Tirefour, enabling him to claim victory.

The &quot;Book of the Dean of Lismore&quot; was compiled by the titular dean, James MacGregor, in the 15th century. Held in the National Library of Scotland, it is &quot;one of the greatest treasures&quot; of early Gaelic writing. However it was written in Fortingall, Perthshire and its connection with Lismore itself, if any, is uncertain.

<doc id="376674" wikidata="Q165923" url="?curid=376674" title="Pallid swift">
<text>The pallid swift (Apus pallidus) is a swift (order Apodiformes). Swifts have very short legs which they use only for clinging to vertical surfaces. The genus name &quot;Apus&quot; is Latin for a swift, thought by the ancients to be a type of swallow with no feet (from Ancient Greek α, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;without&quot;, and πούς, &quot;pous&quot;, &quot;foot&quot;), and &quot;pallidus&quot; is Latin for &quot;pale&quot;. They never settle voluntarily on the ground. Swifts spend most of their lives in the air, living on the insects they catch in their beaks. They drink on the wing.

==Taxonomy==
The pallid swift was first described by English naturalist George Ernest Shelley in 1870.

==Description==
This long species is very similar to the common swift, and separation is only possible with good views. Like its relative, it has a short forked tail and very long swept-back wings that resemble a crescent or a boomerang.

It is entirely dark except for a large white throat patch which is frequently visible from a distance. It is chunkier and browner than common swift, and the slightly paler flight feathers, underparts and rump give more contrast than that species. It also has a scalier looking belly and subtly different flight action. The call is a loud dry scream similar to that of its relative, though possibly more disyllabic.

==Distribution and habitat==
Pallid swifts breed on cliffs and eaves around the Mediterranean and on the Canary Islands and Madeira, laying two eggs.

They are rare north of their breeding areas, although they are likely to be under-recorded due to identification problems. Because of its more southerly range, pallid swift arrives earlier and leaves later than the closely related common swift, so particularly early or late swifts north of the normal range should be carefully observed.

===Migration===
Like swallows, they are migratory, wintering in southern Africa or southeast Asia.

Pallid swifts that breed in Gibraltar have been tracked using GPS technology, and has shown them to have multiple African wintering grounds south of the Sahara at specific times of the year. One bird, tracked over two consecutive winters, showed remarkable fidelity to the areas visited in Africa between years. The study also supports previous findings of an airborne existence in swifts outside the breeding season, with two pallid swifts giving no indication of coming to land.

<doc id="376675" wikidata="Q2600750" url="?curid=376675" title="Charles Townshend">
<text>Charles Townshend (27 August 1725 – 4 September 1767) was a British politician who held various titles in the Parliament of Great Britain. His establishment of the controversial Townshend Acts is considered one of the key causes of the American Revolution.

Townshend was born at Raynham Hall in Norfolk, England, as the second son of Charles Townshend, 3rd Viscount Townshend, and Audrey Harrison. A sickly child, he later graduated from Leiden University and served in various political roles, including as a member of the Board of Trade, Lord of the Admiralty, Paymaster of the Forces, and Chancellor of the Exchequer. He played a significant role in the taxation and control of American colonies, proposing the Townshend Acts, which imposed taxes on various exports to America. These acts were met with resistance and eventually led to the American Revolution. Townshend died in September 1767. He was married to Caroline Campbell, who later became the Baroness Greenwich, and his brother, George Townshend, became the Lord-lieutenant of Ireland.

==Early life==
He was born at his family&#x27;s seat of Raynham Hall in Norfolk, England, the second son of Charles Townshend, 3rd Viscount Townshend, and Audrey (died 1788), daughter and heiress of Edward Harrison of Ball&#x27;s Park, near Hertford. He was a sickly child, had epilepsy, and had a strained relationship with his parents. Townshend was a brash young man, whose &quot;wonderful endowments [were] dashed with follies and indiscretions.&quot; Charles graduated from the Dutch Leiden University on 27 October 1745; while there he had associated with a small group of other English youth, who later became well known in various circles, including Dowdeswell, Wilkes, and Alexander Carlyle. The latter would chronicle their exploits in his &quot;Autobiography&quot;.

Following his return in 1746, he represented Great Yarmouth in Parliament until 1756, when he found a seat for the admiralty borough of Saltash, subsequently transferring in 1761 to Harwich, another borough where the seat was in the government&#x27;s gift. Public attention was first drawn to his abilities in 1753, when he delivered a lively attack against Lord Hardwicke&#x27;s marriage bill, although this measure passed into law.

==Politics==
From 1749 – April 1754, Townshend was a member of the Board of Trade. It was during this time that he first showed an interest in increasing British powers of taxation and control over the American colonies. In 1754 and 1755, he served as Lord of the Admiralty, but at the close of 1755, his passionate attack against the policy of the ministry caused his resignation. In the administration which was formed in November 1756, and which was ruled by William Pitt the Elder, the lucrative office of treasurer of the chamber was given to Townshend, but he retired the following Spring and George Grenville took over. The higher post of First Lord of the Admiralty then fell to Townshend&#x27;s lot and his refusal to accept the nomination led to his exclusion from the new administration.

In the dying days of Grenville&#x27;s cabinet, to retain the administration of Lord Rockingham, Townshend accepted the position of Paymaster of The Forces, though he questioned the stability of the administration, calling it a &quot;mere Lute-string administration&quot; and stating that it was &quot;pretty &#x27;summer wear&#x27;, but it will never stand the winter.&quot;

== Chancellor of the Exchequer ==
Under the ministry of William Pitt the Elder, Townshend accepted the role of Chancellor of the Exchequer in August 1766. A few weeks later his urgent appeals to the Prime Minister for increased power were favorably answered, and he was admitted to the inner circle of the cabinet. The new chancellor proposed the continuance of the land tax at four shillings in the pound, while he held out hopes that it might be reduced next year to three shillings, whereupon his predecessor, William Dowdeswell, by the aid of the landed gentlemen, carried a motion that the reduction should take effect at once. Townshend pledged to find revenue in America with which to meet the deficiency caused by the reduction. 

Early in 1767, shortly after The Stamp Act was repealed owing to colonial protests and boycotts of British goods, Townshend proposed that the Parliament could procure revenue from the Americans without causing them offense via &quot;external&quot; import taxes instead of internal taxes. These were known as the Townshend Acts. The Acts passed resolutions for taxing several exports to America, such as glass, paint, paper and tea. The Townshend Acts established a Board of Commissioners in Boston to enforce them, which was seen as a threat to the American colonial tradition of self-government. He estimated these export taxes would produce a sum of £40,000 for the English treasury. He had the support of his cousin Thomas Townshend who was also a minister in the government. The Townshend Acts would be Townshend&#x27;s last official act before his death.

Soon after that he died somewhat suddenly of a fever on September 4, 1767.

==Private life==
In August 1755 he had married Caroline Campbell (d. 1794), the eldest daughter of John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll and the widow of Francis Scott, Earl of Dalkeith, the eldest son of Francis Scott, 2nd Duke of Buccleuch. According to Burke&#x27;s Peerage, he had two sons (who died young) and a daughter; one of the sons was called Charles, who was born circa 1755, was a talented (amateur) actor under 14 years of age but died unamarried.

Townshend&#x27;s wife was created (August 1767) baroness Greenwich, and his elder brother George Townshend, 1st Marquess Townshend, was made Lord-lieutenant of Ireland.

Townshend conceived a great and dangerous passion for his step-daughter Frances Douglas, Lady Douglas, and her memorialist, Lady Louisa Stuart, wrote after his death of his character:
The American towns of Townsend, Massachusetts and Townshend, Vermont were founded and named after Charles Townshend in 1732 and 1753, respectively. Raynham, Massachusetts was also named after him.
