<text>Education in Germany is primarily the responsibility of individual German states (), with the federal government only playing a minor role.

While kindergarten (nursery school) is optional, formal education is compulsory for all children from the age of 6-7. Details vary from state to state. For example, in Bavaria, children need to attend school for a total of 12 years (of which 3 may be for an apprenticeship); while in Brandenburg, school must be attended until the end of the school year in which the pupil turns 18. Students can complete three types of school leaving qualifications, ranging from the more vocational Hauptschulabschluss and Mittlere Reife over to the more academic Abitur. The latter permits students to apply to study at university level. A bachelor&#x27;s degree is commonly followed up with a master&#x27;s degree, with 45% of all undergraduates proceeding to postgraduate studies within 1.5 years of graduating. While rules vary (see → ) from Land (state) to Land, German public universities generally don&#x27;t charge tuition fees.

Germany is well-known internationally for its vocational training model, the &quot;Ausbildung&quot; (apprenticeship), with about 50 per cent of all school leavers entering vocational training.

== Secondary school forms ==
Germany&#x27;s secondary education is separated into two parts, lower and upper. Germany&#x27;s Lower-secondary education provides individuals with &quot;basic general education&quot;, and gets them ready to enter upper-secondary education, which in turn usually allows vocational training. It&#x27;s common to find mistranslations that say that this education is professional, while it is more accurately described as vocational. The German secondary education is then partitioned into five subtypes of schools: Gymnasium, Realschule, Hauptschule, Gesamtschule and Sonderschule.

One, the , is designed to prepare pupils for higher education and finishes with the final examination, , after grade 12 or 13. From 2005 to 2018 a school reform known as G8 provided the in 8 school years. The reform failed due to high demands on learning levels for the children and were turned to G9 in 2019. Only a few stay with the G8 model. Children usually attend from 10 to 18 years.

The has a range of emphasis for intermediate pupils and finishes with the final examination , after grade 10; the prepares pupils for vocational education and finishes with the final examination , after grade 9 and the after grade 10. There are two types of grade 10: one is the higher level called type 10b and the lower level is called type 10a; only the higher-level type 10b can lead to the and this finishes with the final examination after grade 10b. This new path of achieving the at a vocationally oriented secondary school was changed by the statutory school regulations in 1981—with a one-year qualifying period. During the one-year qualifying period of the change to the new regulations, pupils could continue with class 10 to fulfil the statutory period of education. After 1982, the new path was compulsory, as explained above.

A less common secondary school alternative is the so-called , i.e. comprehensive school. There are two main types of &quot;Gesamtschule&quot;, namely &quot;integriert&quot; (≈integrated) or &quot;kooperativ&quot; (≈collaborative ).

There are also , schools for students with special educational needs. One in 21 pupils attends a . Nevertheless, the or can also lead, in special circumstances, to a of both type 10a or type 10b, the latter of which is the .
The amount of extracurricular activity is determined individually by each school and varies greatly. With the 2015 school reform the German government has tried to push more of those pupils into other schools, which is known as . A special system of apprenticeship called (the dual education system) allows pupils in vocational courses to do in-service training in a company as well as at a state school.

Students in Germany scored above the OECD average in reading (498 score points), mathematics (500) and science (503) in PISA 2018. Average reading performance in 2018 returned to levels that were last observed in 2009, reversing most gains up to 2012. In science, mean performance was below 2006 levels; while in mathematics PISA 2018 results lay significantly below those of the 2012 study. The Human Rights Measurement Initiative finds that Germany is achieving 75.4% of what should be possible for the right to education, at their level of income.

== History ==
===Prussian===

Historically, Lutheranism had a strong influence on German culture, including its education. Martin Luther advocated compulsory schooling so that all people would independently be able to read and interpret the Bible. This concept became a model for schools throughout Germany. German public schools generally have religious education provided by the churches in cooperation with the state ever since.

During the 18th century, the Kingdom of Prussia was among the first countries in the world to introduce free and generally compulsory primary education, consisting of an eight-year course of basic education. It provided not only the skills needed in an early industrialized world (reading, writing, and arithmetic) but also a strict education in ethics, duty, discipline and obedience. Children of affluent parents often went on to attend preparatory private schools for an additional four years, but the general population had virtually no access to secondary education and universities.

In 1810, during the Napoleonic Wars, Prussia introduced state certification requirements for teachers, which significantly raised the standard of teaching. The final examination, , was introduced in 1788, implemented in all Prussian secondary schools by 1812 and extended to all of Germany in 1871. The state also established teacher training colleges for prospective teachers in the common or elementary grades.

=== German Empire ===
When the German Empire was formed in 1871, the school system became more centralized. In 1872, Prussia recognized the first separate secondary schools for females. As learned professions demanded well-educated young people, more secondary schools were established, and the state claimed the sole right to set standards and to supervise the newly established schools.

Four different types of secondary schools developed:
* A nine-year classical (including study of Latin and Classical Greek or Hebrew, plus one modern language);
* A nine-year (focusing on Latin, modern languages, science and mathematics);
* A nine-year (focusing on modern languages, science and mathematics).
* A six-year (without university entrance qualification, but with the option of becoming a trainee in one of the modern industrial, office or technical jobs); and

By the turn of the 20th century, the four types of schools had achieved equal rank and privilege, although they did not have equal prestige.

=== Weimar Republic ===
After 1919, the Weimar Republic established a free, universal four-year elementary school (). Most pupils continued at these schools for another four-year course. Those who were able to pay a small fee went on to a that provided a more challenging curriculum for an additional one or two years. Upon passing a rigorous entrance exam after year four, pupils could also enter one of the four types of secondary school.

=== Nazi Germany ===
During the Nazi era (1933–1945), though the curriculum was reshaped to teach the beliefs of the regime, the basic structure of the education system remained unchanged.

=== East Germany ===

The German Democratic Republic (East Germany) started its own standardized education system in the 1960s. The East German equivalent of both primary and secondary schools was the Polytechnic Secondary School (), which all students attended for 10 years, from the ages of 6 to 16. At the end of the 10th year, an exit examination was set. Depending upon the results, a pupil could choose to come out of education or undertake an apprenticeship for an additional two years, followed by an . Those who performed very well and displayed loyalty to the ruling party could change to the (extended high school), where they could take their examinations after 12 school years. Although this system was abolished in the early 1990s after reunification, it continues to influence school life in the eastern German states.

===West Germany===

After World War II, the Allied powers (Soviet Union, France, United Kingdom, and the U.S.) ensured that Nazi ideology was eliminated from the curriculum. They installed educational systems in their respective occupation zones that reflected their own ideas. When West Germany gained partial independence in 1949, its new constitution (Grundgesetz) granted educational autonomy to the state () governments. This led to widely varying school systems, often making it difficult for children to continue schooling whilst moving between states.

Multi-state agreements ensure that basic requirements are universally met by all state school systems. Thus, all children are required to attend one type of school (five or six days a week) from the age of 6 to the age of 16. A pupil may change schools in the case of exceptionally good (or exceptionally poor) ability. Graduation certificates from one state are recognized by all the other states. Qualified teachers are able to apply for posts in any of the states.

===Federal Republic of Germany===

Since the 1990s, a few changes have been taking place in many schools:
* Introduction of bilingual education in some subjects
* Experimentation with different styles of teaching
* Equipping all schools with computers and Internet access
* Creation of local school philosophy and teaching goals (), to be evaluated regularly
* Reduction of school years ( after grade 12) and introduction of afternoon periods as in many other western countries (turned down in 2019)

In 2000 after much public debate about Germany&#x27;s perceived low international ranking in Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), there has been a trend towards a less ideological discussion on how to develop schools. These are some of the new trends:
* Establishing federal standards on quality of teaching
* More practical orientation in teacher training
* Transfer of some responsibility from the Ministry of Education to local school

Further outcomes:
* Bilingual education now requires mandatory English lessons in 
* The &quot;educational act&quot; () in 2019 is designed to increase the use of the internet and computers in schools.

== Overview ==
In Germany, education is the responsibility of the states () and part of their constitutional sovereignty (). Teachers are employed by the Ministry of Education for the state and usually have a job for life after a certain period (verbeamtet) (which, however, is not comparable in timeframe nor competitiveness to the typical tenure track, e.g. at universities in the US). This practice depends on the state and is currently changing. A parents&#x27; council is elected to voice the parents&#x27; views to the school&#x27;s administration. Each class elects one or two (class presidents; if two are elected usually one is male and the other female), who meet several times a year as the (students&#x27; council).

A team of school presidents is also elected by the pupils each year, whose main purpose is organizing school parties, sports tournaments and the like for their fellow students. The local town is responsible for the school building and employs the janitorial and secretarial staff. For an average school of 600 – 800 students, there may be two janitors and one secretary. School administration is the responsibility of the teachers, who receive a reduction in their teaching hours if they participate.

Church and state are separated in Germany. Compulsory school prayers and compulsory attendance at religious services at state schools are against the constitution. (It is expected, though, to stand politely for the school prayer even if one does not pray along.)

===Literacy===
Over 99% of Germans aged 15 and above are estimated to be able to read and write.

==Preschool==

German preschool is known as a &quot;Kindergarten&quot; (plural ) or , short for (meaning &quot;children&#x27;s daycare center&quot;). Children between the ages of 2 and 6 attend , which are not part of the school system. They are often run by city or town administrations, churches, or registered societies, many of which follow a certain educational approach as represented, e.g., by Montessori or Reggio Emilia or . Forest kindergartens are well established. Attending a is neither mandatory nor free of charge, but can be partly or wholly funded, depending on the local authority and the income of the parents. All caretakers in or must have a three-year qualified education, or be under special supervision during training.

 can be open from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. or longer and may also house a , meaning crèche, for children between the ages of eight weeks and three years, and possibly an afternoon (often associated with a primary school) for school-age children aged 6 to 10 who spend the time after their lessons there. Alongside nurseries, there are day-care nurses (called , plural —the formal, gender-neutral form is ) working independently from any pre-school institution in individual homes and looking after only three to five children typically up to three years of age. These nurses are supported and supervised by local authorities.

The term , meaning &#x27;pre-school&#x27;, is used both for educational efforts in and for a mandatory class that is usually connected to a primary school. Both systems are handled differently in each German state. The is a type of Vorschule.

During the German Empire, children were able to pass directly into secondary education after attending a privately run, fee-based which then was another sort of primary school. The Weimar Constitution banned these, feeling them to be an unjustified privilege, and the Basic Law still contains the constitutional rule (Art. 7 Sect. VI) that: &quot;Pre-schools shall remain abolished.&quot;

===Homeschooling===

Homeschooling is – between (compulsory schooling) beginning with elementary school to 18 years – illegal in Germany. The illegality has to do with the prioritization of children&#x27;s rights over the rights of parents: children have the right to the company of other children and adults who are not their parents. For similar reasons, parents cannot opt their children out of sexual education classes because the state considers a child&#x27;s right to information to be more important than a parent&#x27;s desire to withhold it.

==Primary education==

Parents looking for a suitable school for their child have a wide choice of elementary schools:

* State school. State schools do not charge tuition fees. The majority of pupils attend state schools in their neighbourhood. Schools in affluent areas tend to be better than those in deprived areas. Once children reach school age, many middle-class and working-class families move away from deprived areas.
* or, alternatively
** Waldorf school (2,006 schools in 2007) (covers grades from 1–13)
** Montessori method school (272)
** (free alternative school) (85)
** Protestant (63) or Catholic (114) parochial schools
The entry year can vary between 5 and 7, while stepping back or skipping a grade is also possible.

==Secondary education==
After children complete their primary education (at 10 years of age/grade 4, 12 year of age in Berlin and Brandenburg), there are four options for secondary schooling:
#Gymnasium (Germany) until grade 12 or 13 (with as exit exam, qualifying for university).
#Realschule until grade 10 or 11 (with (or ) as exit exam); students can then attend &quot;Berufsfachschule&quot; (full-time vocational schools) or &quot;Fachoberschule&quot; for 2–3 years, which combines vocational school and an apprenticeship. In some regions there is &quot;Regionalschule&quot;, which is a combination of &quot;Realschule&quot; and &quot;Hauptschule.&quot; Pupils study for either 9 years, to obtain a qualification similar to the &quot;Hauptschulabschluss&quot;, or 10 years, to get the .
#&quot;Hauptschule&quot; until grade 9, with an exam called the &quot;Hauptschulabschluss&quot;, to conclude. Afterwards, students can attend vocational schools.
#, which is a combination of the above, for 5–8 years, with a different qualification for different durations: 5 years for the Hauptschulabschluss; if a student opts for the longer 8 year program, they can take the &quot;gymnasium abitur&quot; exam, qualifying for university.


After passing through any of the above schools, pupils can start a career with an apprenticeship in a ( vocational school). And the passing system id different from other countries. German secondary schools follow points system (punkte). is normally attended twice a week during a two, three, or three-and-a-half-year apprenticeship; the other days are spent working at a company. This is intended to provide a knowledge of theory and practice. The company is obliged to accept the apprentice on its apprenticeship scheme. After this, the apprentice is registered on a list at the (&quot;IHK&quot;) (chamber of industry and commerce). During the apprenticeship, the apprentice is a part-time salaried employee of the company. After passing the and the exit exams of the IHK, a certificate is awarded and the young person is ready for a career up to a low management level. In some areas, the schemes teach certain skills that are a legal requirement (special positions in a bank, legal assistants).

Some special areas provide different paths. After attending any of the above schools and gaining a leaving certificate like , (or , from a ) or from a or a , school leavers can start a career with an apprenticeship at a ( vocational school). Here the student is registered with certain bodies, e.g. associations such as the German Bar Association (, GBA) (board of directors). During the apprenticeship, the young person is a part-time salaried employee of the institution, bank, physician or attorney&#x27;s office. After leaving the and passing the exit examinations set by the German Bar Association or other relevant associations, the apprentice receives a certificate and is ready for a career at all levels except in positions which require a specific higher degree, such as a doctorate. In some areas, the apprenticeship scheme teaches skills that are required by law, including certain positions in a bank or those as legal assistants. The 16 states have exclusive responsibility in the field of education and professional education. The federal parliament and the federal government can influence the educational system only by financial aid to the states. There are many different school systems, but in each state the starting point is always the (elementary school) for a period of four years; or six years in the case of Berlin and Brandenburg.

Grades 5 and 6 form an orientation or testing phase ( or ) during which students, their parents and teachers decide which of the above-mentioned paths the students should follow. In all states except Berlin and Brandenburg, this orientation phase is embedded into the program of the secondary schools. The decision for a secondary school influences the student&#x27;s future, but during this phase changes can be made more easily. In practice this rarely comes to bear because teachers are afraid of sending pupils to more academic schools whereas parents are afraid of sending their children to less academic schools. In Berlin and Brandenburg, the orientation is embedded into that of the elementary schools. Teachers give a so-called educational (path) recommendation () based on scholastic achievements in the main subjects (mathematics, German, natural sciences, foreign language) and classroom behavior with details and legal implications differing from state to state: in some German states, those wishing to apply to a or require such a recommendation stating that the student is likely to make a successful transition to that type of school; in other cases anyone may apply.
In Berlin 30% – 35% of places are allocated by lottery. A student&#x27;s performance at primary school is immaterial.
While the entry year is depending on the last year in the stepping back or skipping a grade is possible between 7th and 10th grade and only stepping back between 5th and 6th grade (so called , meaning testing grade) and 11th and 12th grade.

The eastern states Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia combine and into and respectively. All German states have as one possibility for the more able children, and all states—except Saxony—have some , but in different forms. The states of Berlin and Hamburg have only two types of schools: comprehensive schools and Gymnasium.

Learning a foreign language is compulsory throughout Germany in secondary schools and English is one of the more popular choices. Students at certain are required to learn Latin as their first foreign language and choose a second foreign language. The list of available foreign languages as well as the hours of compulsory foreign language lessons differ from state to state, but the more common choices besides Latin are English, French, Spanish, and ancient Greek. Many schools also offer voluntary study groups for the purpose of learning other languages. At which stage students begin learning a foreign language differs from state to state and is tailored to the cultural and socio-economical dynamics of each state. In some states, foreign language education starts in (primary school). For example, in North Rhine-Westphalia and Lower Saxony, English starts in the third year of elementary school. Baden-Württemberg starts with English or French in the first year. The Saarland, which borders France, begins with French in the third year of primary school and French is taught in high school as the main foreign language.

It may cause problems in terms of education for families that plan to move from one German state to another as there are partially completely different curricula for nearly every subject.

 students gain the chance to take their at a with a good degree in the . Stepping up is always provided by the school system.
Adults who did not achieve a or , or reached its equivalent, have the option of attending evening classes at an or .

=== School organization ===
A few organizational central points are listed below. It should however be noted that due to the decentralized nature of the education system there are many more additional differences across the 16 states of Germany.

* Every state has its own school system.
* Each age group of students (born roughly in the same year) forms one or more grades or classes () per school which remain the same for elementary school (years 1 to 4 or 6), orientation school (if there are orientation schools in the state), orientation phase (at years 5 to 6), and secondary school (years 5 or 7 to 10 in and ; years 5 or 7 to 10 (differences between states) in ) respectively. Changes are possible, though, when there is a choice of subjects, e.g. additional languages; Then classes will be split (and newly merged) either temporarily or permanently for this particular subject.
* Students usually sit at tables, not desks (usually two at one table), sometimes arranged in a semicircle or another geometric or functional shape. During exams in classrooms, the tables are sometimes arranged in columns with one pupil per table (if permitted by the room&#x27;s capacities) to prevent cheating; at many schools, this is only the case for some exams in the two final years of school, i.e. some of the exams counting for the final grade on the high school diploma.
* There is usually no school uniform or dress code. Many private schools have a simplified dress code, for instance, such as &quot;no shorts, no sandals, no clothes with holes&quot;. Some schools are testing school uniforms, but those are not as formal as seen in the UK. They mostly consist of a normal sweater/shirt and jeans of a certain color, sometimes with the school&#x27;s symbol on it. It is however a common custom to design graduation class shirts in , and .
* School usually starts between 7.30 a.m. and 8:15 a.m. and can finish as early as 12; instruction in lower classes almost always ends before lunch. In higher grades, however, afternoon lessons are very common and periods may have longer gaps without teacher supervision between them. Usually, afternoon classes are not offered every day and/or continuously until early evening, leaving students with large parts of their afternoons free of school; some all-day schools (), however, offer classes or mainly-supervised activities throughout the afternoons to offer supervision for the students rather than increasing teaching hours. Afternoon lessons can continue until 6 o&#x27;clock.
* Depending on school, there are breaks of 5 to 20 minutes after each period. There is no lunch break as school usually finishes before 1:30 for junior school. However, at schools with (afternoon classes) ending after 1:30, there may be a lunch break of 45 to 90 minutes, though many schools lack any special break in general. Some schools have regular breaks of 5 minutes between every lesson and have additional 10 or 15-minute breaks after the second and fourth lesson.
* In German state schools lessons have a length of exactly 45 minutes. Each subject is usually taught for two to three periods every week (main subjects like mathematics, German or foreign languages are taught for four to six periods) and usually no more than two periods consecutively. The beginning of every period and, usually, break is announced with an audible signal such as a bell.
* Exams (which are always supervised) are usually essay-based, rather than multiple choice. As of 11th grade, exams usually consist of no more than three separate exercises. While most exams in the first grades of secondary schools usually span no more than 90 minutes, exams in 10th to 12th grade may span four periods or more (without breaks).
* At every type of school, pupils study one foreign language (in most cases English) for at least five years. The study of languages is, however, far more rigorous and literature-oriented in . In , students can choose from a wider range of languages (mostly English, French, Russian—mostly in east German —or Latin) as the first language in 5th grade, and a second mandatory language in 7th grade. Some types of also require an additional third language (such as Spanish, Italian, Russian, Latin or Ancient Greek) or an alternative subject (usually based on one or two other subjects, e.g. British politics (English and politics), dietetics (biology) or media studies (arts and German) in 9th or 11th grade. Gymnasiums normally offer further subjects starting at 11th grade, with some schools offering a fourth foreign language.
* A number of schools once had a (smokers&#x27; corner), a small area of the schoolyard where students over the age of eighteen are permitted to smoke on their breaks. Those special areas were banned in the states of Berlin, Hessen, and Hamburg, Brandenburg at the beginning of the 2005–06 school year. (Bavaria, Schleswig-Holstein, Lower Saxony 2006–07)). Schools in these states prohibit smoking for students and teachers and offences at school will be punished. All other states in Germany introduced similar laws in the aftermath of EU regulations on smoking.
* As state schools are public, smoking is universally prohibited inside the buildings. Smoking teachers are generally asked not to smoke while at or near school.
* Students over 14 years are permitted to leave the school compound during breaks at some schools. Teachers or school personnel tend to prevent younger students from leaving early and strangers from entering the compound without permission.
* Tidying up the classroom and schoolyard is often the task of the students themselves. Unless a group of volunteering students, individuals are being picked sequentially.
* Many schools have &quot;AGs&quot; or (clubs) for afternoon activities such as sports, music or acting, but participation is not necessarily common. Some schools also have student volunteer mediators trained to resolve conflicts between their classmates or younger students.
* Few schools have actual sports teams that compete with other schools. Even if the school has a sports team, students are not necessarily very aware of it.
* While student newspapers used to be very common until the late 20th century, with new issues often produced every couple of months, many of them are now very short-lived, usually vanishing when the class graduates. Student newspapers are often financed mostly by advertisements.
* Schools don&#x27;t often have their own radio stations or TV channels; larger universities often have a local student-run radio station.
* Although most German schools and state universities do not have classrooms equipped with a computer for each student, schools usually have at least one or two computer rooms and most universities offer a limited number of rooms with computers on every desk. State school computers are usually maintained by the same exclusive contractor in the entire city and updated slowly. Internet access is often provided by phone companies free of charge.
* At the end of their schooling, students usually undergo a cumulative written and oral examination ( in or in and ). Students leaving after 9th grade have the leaving examination and after 10th grade they have the (leaving examination of the , also called ).
* After 10th grade students may leave school for at least one year of job education if they do not wish to continue. and students who have passed their may decide to continue schooling at a , but are sometimes required to take additional courses to catch up.
* Corporal punishment was banned in 1949 in East Germany and in 1973 in West Germany.
* Fourth grade (or sixth, depending on the state) is often quite stressful for students of lower performance and their families. Many feel tremendous pressure when trying to achieve placement in , or at least when attempting to avoid placement in . Germany is unique compared to other western countries in its early segregation of students based on academic achievement.

=== School year ===
The school year starts after the summer break (different from state to state, usually end/mid of August) and is divided into two terms. There are typically 12 weeks of holidays in addition to public holidays. Exact dates differ between states, but there are generally six weeks of summer and two weeks of Christmas holiday. The other holiday periods occur in spring (during the period around Easter Sunday) and autumn (during the former harvest, where farmers used to need their children for field work). In some states schools can also schedule two or three special days off per term.

=== Timetables ===

Students have about 30–40 periods of 45 minutes each per week (depending on year and state), but secondary schools in particular have switched to 90-minute lessons () which count as two &#x27;traditional&#x27; lessons. To manage classes that are taught three or five lessons per week there are two common ways. At some schools with 90-minute periods there is still one 45-minute lesson each day, mostly between the first two blocks; at other schools those subjects are taught in weekly or term rotations. There are about 12 compulsory subjects: up to three foreign languages (the first is often begun in primary school, the second one in 6th or 7th grade, and the third somewhere between 7th and 11th grade), physics, biology, chemistry, civics/social/political studies, history, geography (starting between 5th and 7th grade), mathematics, music, visual arts, German, physical education, and religious education/ethics (to be taken from primary school on). The range of offered afternoon activities is different from school to school; however, most German schools offer choirs or orchestras, and sometimes sports, theater or languages. Many of these are offered as semi-scholastic (—literally &quot;working groups&quot;), which are noted in students&#x27; reports but not officially graded. Other common extracurricular activities are organized as private clubs, which are very popular in Germany.
There are three blocks of lessons, with each lesson taking 45 minutes. After each block, there is a break of 15–20 minutes, including after the sixth lesson (the number of lessons changes from year to year, so it is possible that one could be in school until 16.00). (minor fields of study) are taught twice a week; (major subjects) are taught three times.

In grades 11–13, 11–12, or 12–13 (depending on the school system), each student majors in two or three subjects (), in which there are usually five lessons per week. The other subjects () are usually taught three periods per week.

+ is a compulsory class in which each student is prepared to turn in his/her own research paper at the end of the semester. The class is aimed at training students&#x27; scientific research skills that will later be necessary in university.

There are significant differences between the 16 states&#x27; alternatives to this basic template, such as or other private schools. Adults can also go back to evening school and take the exam.

=== Public and private schools ===
In 2006, six percent of German children attended private schools.

In Germany, Article 7, Paragraph 4 of the Grundgesetz, the constitution of Germany, guarantees the right to establish private schools. This article belongs to the first part of the German basic law, which defines civil and human rights. A right which is guaranteed in this part of the can only be suspended in a state of emergency if the respective article specifically states this possibility. That is not the case with this article. It is also not possible to abolish these rights. This unusual protection of private schools was implemented to protect them from a second or similar event in the future.

 are ordinary primary or secondary schools which are run by private individuals, private organizations or religious groups. These schools offer the same types of diplomas as in public schools. However, , like their state-run counterparts, are subjected to basic government standards, such as minimum required qualifications for teachers and pay grades. An must have at least the same academic standards as those of a state school and Article 7, Paragraph 4 of the forbids the segregation of pupils based on socioeconomic status (the so-called ). Therefore, most have very low tuition fees compared to those in most other Western European countries; scholarships are also often available. However, it is not possible to finance these schools with such low tuition fees: accordingly all German are subsidised with public funds.

Some students attend private schools through welfare subsidies. This is often the case if a student is considered to be a child at risk, such as students who have learning disabilities, special needs or come from dysfunctional home environments.

After factoring in parents&#x27; socioeconomic status, children who attend private schools are not as able as those at state schools. At the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) for example, after considering socioeconomic class, students at private schools underperformed those at state schools. One has, however, to be careful interpreting that data: it may be that such students do not underperform because they attend a private school, but that they attend a private school because they underperform. Some private and have lower entry requirements than public and .

=== Special schools ===
Most German children with disabilities attend a school called or (special school) that serves only such children. There are several types of special schools in Germany such as:
*—a special school serving children who have learning difficulties
*—a special school serving children who have very severe learning difficulties
*—a special school serving children who have special emotional needs
Only one in 21 German children attends such a special school.
Teachers at those schools are qualified professionals who have specialized in special-needs education while at university. Special schools often have a very favourable student-teacher ratio and facilities compared with other schools.
Special schools have been criticized. It is argued that special education separates and discriminates against those who are disabled or different.
Some special-needs children do not attend special schools, but are mainstreamed into a or (comprehensive school) and/or, in rare cases, into a or even a .

=== Elite schools ===
There are very few specialist schools for gifted children. As German schools do not IQ-test children, most intellectually gifted children remain unaware that they fall into this category. The German psychologist, Detlef H. Rost, carried out a pioneer long-term study on gifted children called the . In 1987/1988 he tested 7000 third graders on a test based on the German version of the Cattell Culture Fair III test. Those who scored at least two standard deviations above the mean were categorised as gifted. A total of 151 gifted subjects participated in the study alongside 136 controls. All participants in the study were tested blind with the result that they did not discover whether they were gifted or not. The study revealed that the gifted children did very well in school. The vast majority later attended a and achieved good grades. However, 15 percent, were classified as underachievers because they attended a (two cases) or a (one case), had repeated a grade (four cases) or had grades that put them in the lower half of their class (the rest of cases). The report also concluded that most gifted persons had high self-esteem and good psychological health. Rost said that he was not in favour of special schools for the gifted. Gifted children seemed to be served well by Germany&#x27;s existing school system.

=== International schools ===
As of January 2015 the International Schools Consultancy (ISC) listed Germany as having 164 international schools. ISC defines an &#x27;international school&#x27; in the following terms: &quot;ISC includes an international school if the school delivers a curriculum to any combination of pre-school, primary or secondary students, wholly or partly in English outside an English-speaking country, or if a school in a country where English is one of the official languages, offers an English-medium curriculum other than the country&#x27;s national curriculum and is international in its orientation.&quot; This definition is used by publications including The Economist. In 1971 the first International Baccalaureate World School was authorized in Germany. Today 70 schools offer one or more of the IB programmes including two who offer the new IB Career-related Programme.

=== International comparisons ===

The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), coordinated by the OECD, assesses the skills of 15-year-olds in OECD countries and a number of partner countries. The assessment in the year 2000 demonstrated serious weaknesses in German pupils&#x27; performance. In the test of 41 countries, Germany ranked 21st in reading and 20th in both mathematics and the natural sciences, prompting calls for reform. Major newspapers ran special sections on the PISA results, which were also discussed extensively on radio and television. In response, Germany&#x27;s states formulated a number of specific initiatives addressing the perceived problems behind Germany&#x27;s poor performance.

By 2006, German schoolchildren had improved their position compared to previous years, being ranked (statistically) significantly above average (rank 13) in science skills and statistically not significantly above or below average in mathematical skills (rank 20) and reading skills (rank 18). In 2012, Germany achieved above average results in all three areas of reading, mathematics, and natural sciences. This declined in the 2018 report.

The PISA Examination also found big differences in achievement between students attending different types of German schools. The socio-economic gradient was very high in Germany, the students&#x27; performance there being more dependent on socio-economic factors than in most other countries.


Some German teachers&#x27; representatives and a number of scientists disputed the PISA findings. They claimed, amongst other things, that the questions had been ill-translated, that the samples drawn in some countries were not representative, that German students (most of whom had never done a multiple choice tests in their lives before) were disadvantaged by the multiple choice questions, that the PISA questions had no curricular validity and that PISA was &quot;in fact an IQ-test&quot;, which according to them showed that dysgenic fertility was taking place in Germany. Additionally, the OECD was criticized for following its own agenda of a strictly economically utilitarian education policy—as opposed to humanist education policy following the German ideal of —and for trying to establish an educational testing industry without democratic legitimation.

== Apprenticeship ==

Germany has high standards for the education of craftspeople. Historically very few people attended college. In the 1950s for example, 80 percent had only (&quot;primary school&quot;) education of 6 or 7 years. Only 5 percent of youths entered college at this time and still fewer graduated. In the 1960s, six percent of youths entered college. In 1961 there were still 8,000 cities in which no children received secondary education. However, this does not mean that Germany was a country of uneducated people. In fact, many of those who did not receive secondary education were highly skilled craftspeople and members of the upper middle class. Even though more people attend college today, a craftsperson is still highly valued in German society.

Historically (prior to the 20th century) the relationship between a master craftsman and his apprentice was paternalistic. Apprentices were often very young when entrusted to a master craftsman by their parents. It was seen as the master&#x27;s responsibility not only to teach the craft, but also to instill the virtues of a good craftsman. He was supposed to teach honour, loyalty, fair-mindedness, courtesy and compassion for the poor. He was also supposed to offer spiritual guidance, to ensure his apprentices fulfilled their religious duties and to teach them to &quot;honour the Lord&quot; (Jesus Christ) with their lives. The master craftsman who failed to do this would lose his reputation and would accordingly be dishonoured – a very bad fate in those days. The apprenticeship ended with the so-called (exculpation). The master announced in front of the trade heading that the apprentice had been virtuous and God-loving. The young person now had the right to call himself a (journeyman). He had two options: either to work for a master or to become a master himself. Working for another master had several disadvantages. One was that, in many cases, the journeyman who was not a master was not allowed to marry and found a family. Because the church disapproved of sex outside of marriage, he was obliged to become a master if he did not want to spend his life celibate. Accordingly, many of the so-called decided to go on a journey in order to become a master. This was called or Journeyman years.

In those days, the crafts were called the &quot;virtuous crafts&quot; and the virtuousness of the craftspersons was greatly respected. For example, according to one source, a person should be greeted from &quot;the bricklayer craftspersons in the town, who live in respectability, die in respectability, who strive for respectability and who apply respectability to their actions.&quot; In those days, the concept of the &quot;virtuous crafts&quot; stood in contrast to the concept of &quot;academic freedom&quot; as Brüdermann and Jost noticed.

Nowadays, the education of craftspersons has changed – in particular self-esteem and the concept of respectability. Yet even today, a craftsperson does sometimes refer to the &quot;craftsperson&#x27;s codex of virtues&quot; and the crafts sometimes may be referred to as the &quot;virtuous crafts&quot; and a craftsperson who gives a blessing at a roofing ceremony may, in many cases, remind of the &quot;virtues of the crafts I am part of&quot;. Certain virtues are also ascribed to certain crafts. For example, a person might be called &quot;always on time like a bricklayer&quot; to describe punctuality. On the other hand, &quot;virtue&quot; and &quot;respectability&quot;, which in the past had been the center of the life of any craftsperson became less and less important for such education. Today, a young person who wants to start an apprenticeship must first find an : this may be a master craftsperson, a master in the industrial sector () or someone else with proof of suitable qualifications in the training of apprentices. The must also provide proof of no criminal record and proof of respectability. The has to be at least 24 years of age. The has several duties, such as teaching the craft and the techniques, and instilling character and social skills. In some cases, the must also provide board and lodging. Agreement is reached on these points before the apprenticeship begins. The apprentice will also receive payment for his work. According to §17 , a first year apprentice will be paid less than someone who has been an apprentice for longer. An who provides board and lodging may set this off against the payment made. In the past, many of those who applied for an apprenticeship had only primary school education. Nowadays, only those with secondary school education apply for apprenticeships because secondary school attendance has become compulsory. In some trades, it has even become difficult for those holding the to find an apprenticeship because more and more pupils leave school with the or . The apprenticeship takes three years. During that time, the apprentice is trained by the and also attends a vocational school. This is called the German model or dual education system ().

==Tertiary education==
Germany&#x27;s universities are recognised internationally; in the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) for 2008, six of the top 100 universities in the world are in Germany, and 18 of the top 200. Germany ranks third in the QS World University Rankings 2011.

Most German universities are public institutions, charging fees of only around €60–500 per semester for each student, usually to cover expenses associated with the university cafeterias and (usually mandatory) public transport tickets. Thus, academic education is open to most citizens and studying is very common in Germany. The dual education system combines both practical and theoretical education but does not lead to academic degrees. It is more popular in Germany than anywhere else in the world and is a role model for other countries.

The oldest universities of Germany are also among the oldest and best regarded in the world, with Heidelberg University being the oldest (established in 1386 and in continuous operation since then). It is followed by Cologne University (1388), Leipzig University (1409), Rostock University (1419), Greifswald University (1456), Freiburg University (1457), LMU Munich (1472) and the University of Tübingen (1477).

While German universities have a strong focus on research, a large part of it is also done outside of universities in independent institutes that are embedded in academic clusters, such as within the Max Planck, Fraunhofer, Leibniz and Helmholtz institutes. This German peculiarity of &quot;outsourcing&quot; research leads to a competition for funds between universities and research institutes and may negatively affect academic rankings. 

Figures for Germany are roughly:
* 1,000,000 new students at all schools put together for one year
* 400,000 graduations
* 30,000 doctoral dissertations per year
* 1000 habilitations per year (the traditional way to qualify as a professor, but typically postdoc or junior professorship is the preferred career path nowadays, which are not accounted for in this number)

=== Types of universities ===
The German tertiary education system distinguishes between two types of institutions: The term (university) is reserved for institutions which have the right to confer doctorates. Other degree-awarding higher education institutions may use the more generic term .

In addition, non-university institutions of tertiary level exist in the German education system. The admission requirement is usually a previous education including work experience. As an example, for technological subjects can be cited, which are completed with a state examination (EQF level 6).
Only have the right to confer doctorates and habilitations. Some universities use the term &quot;research university&quot; in international usage to emphasize their strength in research activity in addition to teaching, particularly to differentiate themselves from . A university covering the full range of scientific disciplines in contrast to more specialized universities might refer to itself as . Specialized universities which have the formal status of include , (Universities of Education), (Universities of Arts) and (Universities of Music). The excellence initiative has awarded eleven universities with the title University of Excellence. Professors at regular universities were traditionally required to have a doctorate as well as a habilitation. Since 2002, the junior professorship was introduced to offer a more direct path to employment as a professor for outstanding doctoral degree.

==== &quot;Fachhochschulen&quot; (Universities of Applied Sciences) ====

There is another type of university in Germany: the (Universities of Applied Sciences), which offer mostly the same degrees as , but often concentrate on applied science (as the English name suggests) and usually have no power to award PhD-level degrees, at least not in their own right. have a more practical profile with a focus on employability. In research, they are rather geared to applied research instead of fundamental research. At a traditional university, it is important to study &quot;why&quot; a method is scientifically right; however, this is less important at Universities of Applied Sciences. Here the emphasis is placed on what systems and methods exist, where they come from, what their advantages and disadvantages are, how to use them in practice, when they should be used, and when not.

For professors at a , at least three years of work experience are required for appointment while a habilitation is not expected. This is unlike their counterparts at traditional universities, where an academic career with research experience is necessary.

Prior to the Bologna Process, graduates received a &quot;Diplom&quot;. To differentiate it from the which was conferred by , the title is indicated starting with &quot;Dipl.&quot; () and ending with &quot;(FH)&quot;, e.g., &quot;Max Mustermann&quot; for a graduate engineer from a . The FH Diploma is roughly equivalent to a bachelor&#x27;s degree. An FH Diploma does not qualify the holder for a doctoral program directly, but in practice universities admit the best FH graduates on an individual basis after an additional entrance exam or participation in theoretical classes.

=== Admission ===

==== University entrance qualification ====
Students wishing to attend a German &quot;Universität&quot; must, as a rule, hold the &quot;Abitur&quot; or a subject-restricted qualification for university entrance (&quot;Fachgebundene Hochschulreife&quot;). For &quot;Fachhochschulen&quot;, the &quot;Abitur&quot;, the &quot;Fachgebundene Hochschulreife&quot; certification or the &quot;Fachhochschulreife&quot; certification (general or subject-restricted) is required.

Lacking these school leaving certifications, in some states potential students can qualify for university entrance if they present additional formal proof that they will be able to keep up with their fellow students. This may take the form of a test of cognitive functioning or passing the &quot;Begabtenprüfung&quot; (&quot;aptitude test&quot;, consisting of a written and oral exam). In some cases, students who do not hold the Abitur may enter university even if they do not pass the aptitude or cognitive functioning tests if they 1) have received previous vocational training, and 2) have worked at least three years and passed the &quot;Eingangsprüfung&quot; (entrance exam). Such is the case, for example, in Hamburg.

While there are numerous ways to achieve entrance qualification to German universities, the most traditional route has always been graduation from a Gymnasium with the Abitur; however this has become less common over time. As of 2008, less than half of university freshmen in some German states had graduated from a Gymnasium. Even in Bavaria (a state with a policy of strengthening the Gymnasium) only 56 percent of freshmen had graduated from a Gymnasium. The rest were awarded the Abitur from another type of school or did not hold the Abitur certification at all.

High school diplomas received from countries outside of Germany are, in many cases, not considered equivalent to the Abitur, but rather to a Realschulabschluss and therefore do not qualify the bearer for admission to a German university. However, it is still possible for such applicants to be admitted to a German university if they fulfill additional formal criteria, such as a particular grade point average or points on a standardized admissions test. These criteria depend on the school leaving certificate of the potential student and are agreed upon by the Standing Conference of the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs. For example, holders of the US high school diploma with a combined math and verbal score of 1300 on the SAT or 29 on the ACT may qualify for university admission.

Foreign students lacking the entrance qualification can acquire a degree at a &quot;Studienkolleg&quot;, which is often recognized as an equivalent to the &quot;Abitur&quot;. The one-year course covers similar topics as the &quot;Abitur&quot; and ensures sufficient language skills to take up studies at a German university.

==== Admissions procedure ====

The process of application depends on the degree program applied for, the applicant&#x27;s origin and the university entrance qualification. Generally, all programs of study follow one of three admissions procedures.
* Free admissions: Every applicant who fulfills the university entrance qualification will be admitted. This is usually practiced in subjects in which many students quit their studies, e.g., mathematics, physics or engineering. Sometimes, the number of students who fail a course can be as high as 94 percent in these programs.
* Local admission restrictions: For degree programs where only a limited number of places are available (&quot;numerus clausus&quot;, often abbreviated NC), criteria by which applications will be evaluated differ from university to university and from program to program. Commonly used criteria include the final grade of the university entrance qualification (which takes into account the grades of the final exams as well as course grades), a weighted grade point average which increases the weight of relevant school subjects, interviews, motivational letters, letters of recommendation by previous professors, essays, relevant practical experience, and subject-specific entrance exams. Such restrictions are increasingly common at German universities.
* Nationwide admission restrictions: In the subjects medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, and pharmacy, a nationwide &quot;numerus clausus&quot; is in place. In these subjects, applications of Germans and foreigners who are legally treated like Germans (e.g., EU citizens) are handled centrally for all universities by a public trust (&quot;Stiftung für Hochschulzulassung&quot;). The following quotas are applied in this procedure:
** 20 percent of available admission slots are admitted by the final grade of the university entrance qualification
** 20 percent of slots are granted to students who have the highest number of so-called waiting semesters in which they were not enrolled at university
** 60 percent of slots are awarded by criteria at the university&#x27;s discretion. Criteria universities commonly apply are: 1) final grade of the university entrance qualification (used most often), 2) interviews, 3) essays or motivational letters, and 4) entrance exams.
** some additional slots are reserved for special cases and do not count into the previous three quotas: For example, up to 2 percent of slots can be so called hardship cases (&quot;Härtefälle&quot;), which are granted preferential admission. An applicant may be counted as a hardship case only if there are exceptional circumstances making it impossible for the applicant to wait even a single semester for a place at university, e.g., because of a progressing disease.
According to German law, universities are not permitted to discriminate against or grant preferential treatment to persons on basis of race, ethnic group, gender, social class, religion or political opinion.

=== Tuition fees ===
Public universities in Germany are funded by the federal states and do not charge tuition fees. However, all enrolled students do have to pay a semester fee (&quot;Semesterbeitrag&quot;). This fee consists of an administrative fee for the university (only in some of the states), a fee for &quot;Studentenwerk&quot;, which is a statutory student affairs organization, a fee for the university&#x27;s AStA (&quot;Allgemeiner Studentenausschuss&quot;, students&#x27; government) and &quot;Studentenschaft&quot; (students&#x27; union), at many universities a fee for public transportation, and possibly more fees as decided by the university&#x27;s students&#x27; parliament (e.g., for a cooperation with a local theater granting free entry for students). Summed up, the semester fee usually ranges between €150 and €350.

In 2005, the German Federal Constitutional Court ruled that a federal law prohibiting tuition fees was unconstitutional, on the grounds that education is the sole responsibility of the states. Following this ruling, seven federal states introduced tuition fees of €500 per semester in 2006 and 2007. Due to massive student protests and a citizens&#x27; initiative which collected 70,000 signatures against tuition fees, the government of Hesse was the first to reverse course before the state election in 2008; other state governments soon followed. Several parties which spoke out for tuition fees lost state elections. Bavaria in 2013 and Lower Saxony in 2014 were the last states to abolish tuition fees.

Since 1998, all German states had introduced tuition fees for long-time students (&quot;Langzeitstudiengebühren&quot;) of €500 up to €900 per semester. These fees are required for students who study substantially longer than the standard period of study (&quot;Regelstudienzeit&quot;), which is a defined number of semesters for each degree program. Even after the abolition of general tuition fees, tuition fees for long-time students remain in six states. Additionally, universities may charge tuition fees for so called non-consecutive master&#x27;s degree programs, which do not build directly on a bachelor&#x27;s degree, such as a Master of Business Administration.

With much controversy, the state of Baden-Württemberg has reintroduced tuition fees at public universities starting in 2017. From autumn 2017, students who are not citizens of an EU/EEA member state are expected to pay €1,500 per semester. Students who enroll for their second degree in Germany are expected to pay €650 per semester regardless of their country of origin. Although heavily criticised in Germany, the amount is considered below average in comparison with other European countries.

There are university-sponsored scholarships in Germany and a number of private and public institutions award scholarships—usually to cover living costs and books. There is a state-funded study loan programme, called &quot;BAföG&quot; (&quot;Bundesausbildungsförderungsgesetz&quot;, &quot;Federal Education Aid Act&quot;). It ensures that less wealthy students can receive up to €735 per month for the standard period of study if they or their parents cannot afford all of the costs involved with studying. Furthermore, students need to have a prospect of remaining in Germany to be eligible; this includes German and EU citizens, but often also long-term residents of other countries. Part (typically half) of this money is an interest-free loan that is later repaid, with the other half considered a free grant, and the amount to be repaid is capped at €10,000. Currently, around a quarter of all students in Germany receive financial support via &quot;BAföG&quot;.

For international students there are different approaches to get a full scholarship or a funding of their studies. To be able to get a scholarship a successful application is mandatory. It can be submitted upon arrival in Germany as well as after arrival. But due to the fact that many scholarships are only available to students who are already studying, the chances of an acceptance are limited for applicants from abroad. Therefore, many foreign students have to work to finance their studies.

=== Students ===

Since the end of World War II, the number of young people entering a university has more than tripled in Germany, but university attendance is still lower than that of many other European nations. This can be explained with the dual education system with its strong emphasis on apprenticeships and vocational schools. Many jobs which do require an academic degree in other countries (such as nursing) require completed vocational training instead in Germany.

The rate of university graduates varies by federal state. The number is the highest in Berlin and the lowest in Schleswig-Holstein. Similarly, the ratio of school graduates with university entrance qualification varies by state between 38% and 64%.

The organizational structure of German universities goes back to the university model introduced by Wilhelm von Humboldt in the early 19th century, which identifies the unity of teaching and research as well as academic freedom as ideals. Colleges elsewhere had previously dedicated themselves to religion and classic literature, and Germany&#x27;s shift to a research-based model was an institutional innovation. This model lead to the foundation of Humboldt University of Berlin and influenced the higher education systems of numerous countries. Some critics argue that nowadays German universities have a rather unbalanced focus, more on education and less on research.

At German universities, students enroll for a specific program of study (&quot;Studiengang&quot;). During their studies, students can usually choose freely from all courses offered at the university. However, all bachelor&#x27;s degree programs require a number of particular compulsory courses and all degree programs require a minimum number of credits that must be earned in the core field of the program of study. It is not uncommon to spend longer than the regular period of study (&quot;Regelstudienzeit&quot;) at university. There are no fixed classes of students who study and graduate together. Students can change universities according to their interests and the strengths of each university. Sometimes students attend multiple different universities over the course of their studies. This mobility means that at German universities there is a freedom and individuality unknown in the US, the UK, or France. Professors also choose their subjects for research and teaching freely. This academic freedom is laid down in the German constitution.

Since German universities do not offer accommodation or meals, students are expected to organize and pay for board and lodging themselves. Inexpensive places in dormitories are available from &quot;Studentenwerk&quot;, a statutory non-profit organization for student affairs. However, there are only enough places for a fraction of students. &quot;Studentenwerk&quot; also runs canteens and cafés on campus, which are similarly affordable. Other common housing options include renting a private room or apartment as well as living together with one or more roommates to form a &quot;Wohngemeinschaft&quot; (often abbreviated WG). Furthermore, many university students continue to live with their parents. One third to one half of the students works to make a little extra money, often resulting in a longer stay at university.

===Degrees===

Recently, the implementation of the Bologna Declaration introduced bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees as well as ECTS credits to the German higher education system. Previously, universities conferred Diplom and Magister degrees depending on the field of study, which usually took 4–6 years. These were the only degrees below the doctorate. In the majority of subjects, students can only study for bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees, as Diplom or Magister courses do not accept new enrollments. However, a few Diplom courses still prevail. The standard period of study is usually three years (six semesters, with 180 ECTS points) for bachelor&#x27;s degrees and two years (four semesters, 120 ECTS) for master&#x27;s degrees. The following Bologna degrees are common in Germany:
* Bachelor of Arts (B.A.); Master of Arts (M.A.)
* Bachelor of Science (BSc); Master of Science (MSc)
* Bachelor of Engineering (BEng); Master of Engineering (MEng)
* Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A.); Master of Fine Arts (M.F.A.)
* Bachelor of Music (B.Mus.); Master of Music (M.Mus.)
In addition, there are courses leading to the &quot;Staatsexamen&quot; (state examination). These did usually not transition to bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees. For future doctors, dentists, veterinarians, pharmacists, and lawyers, the &quot;Staatsexamen&quot; is required to be allowed to work in their profession. For teachers, judges, and public prosecutors, it is the required degree for working in civil service. Students usually study at university for 4–8 years before they take the &quot;First Staatsexamen&quot;. Afterwards, they go on to work in their future jobs for one or two years (depending on subject and state), before they are able to take the &quot;Second Staatsexamen&quot;, which tests their practical abilities. While it is not an academic degree formally, the &quot;First Staatsexamen&quot; is equivalent to a master&#x27;s degree and qualifies for doctoral studies. On request, some universities bestow an additional academic degree (e.g., Diplom-Jurist or Magister iuris) on students who have passed &quot;First Staatsexamen&quot;.

The highest German academic degree is the doctorate. Each doctoral degree has a particular designation in Latin (except for engineering, where the designation is in German), which signifies in which field the doctorate is conferred in. The doctorate is indicated before the name in abbreviated form, e.g., &quot;Dr. rer. nat. Max Mustermann&quot; (for a doctor in natural sciences). The prefix &quot;Dr.&quot; is used for addressing, for example in formal letters. Outside of the academic context, however, the designation is usually dropped.

While it is not an academic degree formally, the &quot;Habilitation&quot; is a higher, post-doctoral academic qualification for teaching independently at universities. It is indicated by appending &quot;habil.&quot; after the designation of the doctorate, e.g., &quot;Dr. rer. nat. habil. Max Mustermann&quot;. The holder of a Habilitation may work as &quot;Privatdozent&quot;.

== Research ==
Scientific research in Germany is conducted by universities and research institutes. The raw output of scientific research from Germany consistently ranks among the world&#x27;s best. The national academy of Germany is the Leopoldina Academy of Sciences. Additionally, the Union of the German Academies of Sciences and Humanities acts as an umbrella organization for eight local academies and acatech is the Academy of Science and Engineering.

=== Prizes ===
Every year, &quot;Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft&quot; awards ten outstanding scientists working at German research institutions with the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize, Germany&#x27;s most important research prize. With a maximum of €2.5 million per award it is one of the highest endowed research prizes in the world. Additionally, numerous foundations and non-profit organizations award further prizes, medals and scholarships.

== Determinants of academic attainment ==
50 years ago the person least likely to attend a Gymnasium was a &quot;Catholic working-class girl from the rural parts of Germany&quot;. Nowadays however the person least likely to attend a Gymnasium is a &quot;minority youngster from the ghetto&quot;, who is &quot;the son of immigrants&quot;

The influence of social class on educational achievement is much greater in western Germany than it is in eastern Germany (former GDR). An analysis of PISA data on Gymnasium pupils for the year 2000 showed that, while in western Germany the child of an academic was 7.26 times as likely as that of a skilled worker to attend, in eastern Germany a child from an academic family was only 2.78 times as likely as a working-class child to attend. The reasons for this were unclear. Some people believed that immigrants were responsible, because more uneducated immigrant families lived in western than in eastern Germany. This assumption however could not be confirmed. The difference between east and west was even stronger when only ethnic German children were studied.

Social class differences in educational achievement are much more marked in Germany&#x27;s big cities than they are in the rural parts of Germany. In cities with more than 300,000 inhabitants, children of academics are 14.36 times as likely as children of skilled workers to attend Gymnasium.

=== Gender ===

Educational achievement varies more in German males than it does in German females: boys are more likely to attend special education schools but also more likely to be postgraduate students; 63% of pupils attending special education programs for the academically challenged are male. Males are less likely to meet the statewide performance targets, more likely to drop out of school and more likely to be classified emotionally disturbed. 86% of the pupils receiving special training because of emotional disturbance are male.
Research shows a class-effect: native middle-class males perform as well as middle-class females in terms of educational achievement but lower-class males and immigrant males lag behind lower-class females and immigrant females. A lack of male role models contributes to a low academic achievement in the case of lower-class males .
On the other hand, 58% of all postgraduate students and 84% of all German college professors were male in 2010.

=== Socioeconomic factors ===
Children from poor immigrant or working-class families are less likely to succeed in school than children from middle- or upper-class backgrounds. This disadvantage for the financially challenged of Germany is greater than in any other industrialized nation. However, the true reasons stretch beyond economic ones. The poor also tend to be less educated. After allowing for parental education, money does not play a major role in children&#x27;s academic outcomes.

Immigrant children and youths, mostly of lower-class background, are the fastest-growing segment of the German population. So their prospects bear heavily on the well-being of the country. More than 30% of Germans aged 15 years and younger have at least one parent born abroad. In the big cities, 60% of children aged 5 years and younger have at least one parent born abroad. Immigrant children academically underperform their peers. Immigrants have tended to be less educated than native Germans.

Immigrants from Pakistan, India, China and Vietnam perform exceptionally well. In eastern Germany, Vietnamese and Chinese of lower-class backgrounds outperform students from European backgrounds despite the fact that in most cases their parents are poorer and less educated than the parents of their European-born peers. Teachers in eastern Germany have also been shown to be more motivated than teachers in western Germany. That might be another reason for this Asian achievement.

The ELEMENT study dealt with determinants of academic achievement in Berlin. It was carried out in Berlin, where some of the pupils started at a Gymnasium after the 4th grade, while others stayed in primary school until 6th grade and started at different schools after the 6th grade. Factors correlated with academic achievement tend to be intercorrelated (that means that they are also correlated with other factors that determine academic achievement). The number of books owned by a pupil&#x27;s parents, for example, is correlated with the parents&#x27; education. Because of this Multiple Regression Analysis was used. Multiple Regression allows us to understand the influence of one variable when the other variables are held fixed.

It was revealed by the study that the most important variable determining mathematical performance in the 6th grade was mathematical performance in the 4th grade. Children who have a head start in the 4th grade keep it until the 6th grade. It was also revealed by the study that some variables were immaterial. If a language other than German is spoken in the home that was correlated with poor mathematical performance in other studies. However correlation does not imply causation and the ELEMENT-study revealed that if other factors were taken into account for the language spoken at home, this had no effect on mathematical performance.

;ELEMENT-long term study of the development of mathematical ability

The aim of another ELEMENT-study was to monitor the development of general mathematical ability. One finding is that those admitted to a Gymnasium after the fourth grade had showed better mathematical ability than those who stayed in primary school, ab initio. That was true for all social classes. Another finding was that children of all social classes did better in the sixth grade when they were at a Gymnasium. By the end of the sixth grade, those attending a Gymnasium were two years ahead of those attending a primary school.

Did the Gymnasium boost students ability? There are different opinions about this. Some argue that this is the cases and even after testing performance in grade four, those who were admitted to a Gymnasium outperformed their peers who were not at grade six. That was also the interpretation of Prof. Dr. Dr. Lehman, who did the study. He stated: &quot;The findings indicate that the Gymnasium help students of all social classes reach their full mathematical potential&quot;. Others however, who have reanalyzed the data, claimed that those attending a Gymnasium were different ab initio and could not properly be compared to those attending a primary school. The data is of high political relevance as those who are in favour of the tripartite system and those who are in favour of comprehensive schools both use it to prove their point. Those, who are in favour of comprehensive schools, claim that the data shows that the primary schools which resembles a comprehensive schools boost children&#x27;s ability, while those in favour of the tripartite system argue that the data shows the Gymnasium boost students ability.

=== Children ===

Children whose families receive welfare, children whose parents dropped out of school, children of teenage parents, children raised by a lone parent, children raised in crime-ridden inner-city neighbourhoods, children who have multiple young siblings, and children who live in overcrowded substandard apartments are at risk of poor educational achievement in Germany. Often these factors go together, making it very hard for children to overcome the odds. A number of measures have been assessed to help those children reach their full potential.

Kindergarten has been shown to improve school readiness in children at risk. Children attending a kindergarten were less likely to have impaired speech or impaired motor development. Only 50% of children whose parents did not graduate from school are ready for school at age six. If such children were enrolled in a high-quality three-year Kindergarten programme, 87% were ready for school at age six. Thus Kindergarten helps to overcome unequal opportunities.

Families whose children are at risk for low academic achievement may be visited by trained professionals. They offer a wide variety of services that relate to each child&#x27;s and each family&#x27;s background and needs. Such professionals may visit pregnant low-income women and talk with them about positive health-related behaviors, such as following a healthy diet or refraining from the use of alcohol or tobacco while pregnant. Positive health-related behavior may have a major impact on children&#x27;s school performance.

Home visitors may provide information on childcare and social services, help parents in crisis and model problem-solving skills. They may help implement the preschool/school curriculum at home or provide a curriculum of educational games designed to improve language, development and cognitive skills. In most cases, such support is offered to families on a voluntary basis. Families who are eligible for the program may decide for themselves whether or not they want to participate. There are no penalties if they decide against it or against continuing with the program.

=== Working class pupils ===

In Germany most children are streamed by ability into different schools after fourth grade. The Progress in International Reading Literacy Study revealed that working class children needed better reading abilities than middle-class children to be nominated for the Gymnasium. After allowing for reading abilities, odds to be nominated to Gymnasium for upper-middle-class children were still 2.63 times better than for working-class children.

Germany&#x27;s &quot;Left Party&quot; brought up the discussion about affirmative action. According to Stefan Zillich, quotas should be &quot;a possibility&quot; to help working class children who did not do well in school gain access to a Gymnasium. Headmasters of Gymnasien have objected, saying that this type of policy would &quot;be a disservice&quot; to poor children, that they would not be able to academically keep up with their classmates and that they would not feel welcome at a Gymnasium. Wolfgang Harnischfeger, headmaster of a well known Berlin Gymnasium, stated: &quot;It can be noticed in children as young as kindergarten-age, that children take after their parents. They emulate their language, their way of dressing, their way of spending their freetime. Children from Neukölln (a poor neighbourhood) would not feel good about themselves if they had to attend that type of school that mainly serves pupils from social classes different from their own. They will not be able to integrate. Every field-day, every school party will show that very soon.&quot; He also said that &quot;this kind of policy would weaken the Gymnasium&quot; and that this would be dangerous, because &quot;German society could not afford to do without the truly educated adults the Gymnasium produces&quot;. Stefan Zillich has answered to this, saying that &quot;German society can not afford having only so few adults who were truly educated&quot;. While affirmative action laws were not passed (status: January 2010) sought after schools have been guaranteed the right to employ their own quotas since the 1970s.

===Contemporary issues===

There is a constant public debate about tracking students by ability into several types of secondary school (i.e. Gymnasium, Realschule and Hauptschule). Opponents of streaming by ability claim that streaming is unfair, that parents from higher socio-economic groups are more effective in sending children of similar aptitude to higher-level schools (Gymnasium). Proponents of streaming claim that it limits income segregation between rich and poor areas, as wealthier parents in poor neighborhoods may still send their gifted children to a fairly good public school due to streaming, giving them less motivation to move to a wealthier area. They also say that potential access to a Selective school would allow gifted children of lower-class parents living in poor neighborhoods better educational opportunities than if they were confined to schools with the average pupil population of their neighborhoods.

Opponents of streaming have pointed out that countries that performed very well in PISA, such as Finland, do not stream by ability. Proponents have pointed out that German comprehensive schools ranked below other German schools on PISA and that children from the lower socio-economic groups attending comprehensive schools fare worse in PISA than middle-class students attending the same schools.

There is also a concern about the poor standard of school buildings and the lack of digital technology in classrooms.

===International students in Germany===
According to official data, international students make up nearly 15 percent of Germany&#x27;s student population, with 325,000 international students studying in Germany during the winter semester 2020/2021.

==Notes==
: It&#x27;s a common pitfall to translate the German &quot;kooperativ&quot; into &quot;cooperative&quot; in English. However, this is a so-called false friend. The English word &quot;cooperative&quot; describes either a business/organisation that is fully owned by the people that work for it (i.e. &quot;Genossenschaft&quot; in German), or it describes someone&#x27;s &quot;willingness&quot; to act or work together, as opposed to their resistance/refusal to acting/working together (=&quot;sich kooperativ zeigen&quot; in German).

<text>The Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) is a supranational central bank that serves Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, Montserrat, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, all members of the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) that use the ECCB-issued Eastern Caribbean Dollar as their currency. (Three other OECS members, the British Virgin Islands, Guadeloupe and Martinique use other currencies.) The ECCB was established in 1983, succeeding the British Caribbean Currency Board (1950–1965) and the Eastern Caribbean Currency Authority (1965–1983). It is also in charge of bank supervision within its geographical remit.
Two of its core mandates are to maintain price and financial sector stability, by acting as a stabilizer and safe-guard of the banking system in the Eastern Caribbean Economic and Currency Union (OECS/ECCU). The bank is headquartered in Basseterre, St. Kitts.

==Background==
In 1946, a West Indian Currency Conference saw Barbados, British Guiana, the Leeward Islands, Trinidad and Tobago and the Windward Islands agree to establish a unified decimal currency system based on a West Indian dollar to replace the earlier arrangement of having three different Boards of Commissioners of Currency for Barbados (which also served the Leeward and Windward Islands), British Guiana, and Trinidad &amp; Tobago. in 1950, the British Caribbean Currency Board (BCCB) was set up in Trinidad, with the sole right to issue notes and coins of the new unified currency and given the mandate of keeping full foreign exchange cover to ensure convertibility at .80 per pound sterling.

In 1951, the British Virgin Islands joined the arrangement, but this led to discontent because that territory was more naturally drawn to the currency of the neighbouring U.S. Virgin Islands. In 1961, the British Virgin Islands withdrew from the arrangement and adopted the U.S. dollar as its currency. In 1964, Trinidad and Tobago withdrew from the currency union (adopting the Trinidad and Tobago dollar) forcing the movement of the headquarters of the BCCB to Barbados.

Under the Eastern Caribbean Currency Agreement 1965, the British West Indies dollar was replaced at par by the Eastern Caribbean dollar and the BCCB was replaced by the Eastern Caribbean Currency Authority (ECCA). British Guiana withdrew from the currency union in 1966. Grenada, which had used the Trinidad and Tobago dollar from 1964, rejoined the common currency arrangement in 1968. Barbados withdrew from the currency union in 1972, following which the ECCA headquarters were moved to Basseterre in St. Kitts.

== History ==
The Eastern Caribbean Central Bank Agreement, signed at Port of Spain on 5 July 1983, established the ECCB as the successor entity of the ECCA, tasked with maintaining the stability and integrity of the subregion&#x27;s currency and banking system in order to facilitate the balanced growth and development of its member states.

Unlike the ECCA, the ECCB&#x27;s competencies include banking supervision jointly with the member states&#x27; finance ministries, making it the first-ever supranational banking supervisor ahead of the Central Bank of West African States and Bank of Central African States (which both became banking supervisors in 1990) and European Central Bank (in 2014). The specific role of the ECCB in the supervision of offshore banks, however, varies across OECS countries, leading the International Monetary Fund to observe in 2013 the persistence of &quot;gaps in the regulatory framework&quot; applicable to offshore banks.

In early 2015, the bank announced plans to phase out the production of the 1 and 2 cent pieces. The date was finalised as July 1, 2015. When a motive was sought, it was stated that it takes about six cents to make one cent pieces and about eight cents to make a 2 cent piece.

<text>Dänholm (literally &quot;Danes&#x27; Isle&quot;) is a small island on the German coast of the Baltic Sea. It is situated in the Strelasund just east of Stralsund. Both bridges linking Rügen with the mainland, Rügendamm and Rügenbrücke, run across it. The island was the scene of an incident between the Swedish and French armies in 1807, when it belonged to Swedish Pomerania during the Napoleonic Wars.

<text>The Strelasund or Strela Sound is a sound or lagoon of the Baltic Sea which separates Rügen from the German mainland. It is crossed by a bridge called the Strelasund Crossing from Stralsund. It runs northwest to southeast from a small shallow bay just north of Stralsund called the Kubitzer Bodden through to another such bay, the Greifswalder Bodden in the southeast. The sound is nowhere much more than 3 km wide, reaching its greatest width towards its southeast end. It is roughly 25 km long.

The only island of any size in the Strelasund is Dänholm just off Stralsund, which carries part of the Rügendamm across the sound.

On the Rügen side, the shore is in many places steep, although this is punctuated by lower shorelines with reed beds in some places. On the mainland side, however, the shores are overridingly flat.

The Strelasund has been the site of two battles. The first in 1362 and the second in 1369 both pitted Danish king Valdemar IV against the Hanseatic fleet. Differences between the two parties were settled by the Treaty of Stralsund in 1370.

<text>The Battle of Germantown was a major engagement in the Philadelphia campaign of the American Revolutionary War. It was fought on October 4, 1777, at Germantown, Pennsylvania, between the British Army led by Sir William Howe, and the American Continental Army under George Washington.

After defeating the Continental Army at the Battle of Brandywine on September 11, and the Battle of Paoli on September 20, Howe outmaneuvered Washington, seizing Philadelphia, the capital of the United States, on September 26. Howe left a garrison of some 3,000 troops in Philadelphia, while moving the bulk of his force to Germantown, then an outlying community to the city. Learning of the division, Washington determined to engage the British. His plan called for four separate columns to converge on the British position at Germantown. The two flanking columns were composed of 3,000 militia, while the center-left, under Nathanael Greene, the center-right under John Sullivan, and the reserve under Lord Stirling were made up of regular troops. The ambition behind the plan was to surprise and destroy the British force, much in the same way as Washington had surprised and decisively defeated the Hessians at Trenton. In Germantown, Howe had his light infantry and the 40th Foot spread across his front as pickets. In the main camp, Wilhelm von Knyphausen commanded the British left, while Howe himself personally led the British right.

A heavy fog caused a great deal of confusion among the approaching Americans. After a sharp contest, Sullivan&#x27;s column routed the British pickets. Unseen in the fog, around 120 men of the British 40th Foot barricaded the Chew House. When the American reserve moved forward, Washington made the decision to launch repeated assaults on the position, all of which failed with heavy casualties. Penetrating several hundred yards beyond the mansion, Sullivan&#x27;s wing became dispirited, running low on ammunition and hearing cannon fire behind them. As they withdrew, Anthony Wayne&#x27;s division collided with part of Greene&#x27;s late-arriving wing in the fog. Mistaking each other for the enemy, they opened fire, and both units retreated. Meanwhile, Greene&#x27;s left-center column threw back the British right. With Sullivan&#x27;s column repulsed, the British left outflanked Greene&#x27;s column. The two militia columns had only succeeded in diverting the attention of the British, and had made no progress before they withdrew.

Despite the defeat, France, already impressed by the American success at Saratoga, decided to lend greater aid to the Americans. Howe did not vigorously pursue the defeated Americans, instead turning his attention to clearing the Delaware River of obstacles at Red Bank and Fort Mifflin. After unsuccessfully attempting to draw Washington into combat at White Marsh, Howe withdrew to Philadelphia. Washington, his army intact, withdrew to Valley Forge, where he wintered and re-trained his forces.

==Background==

The Philadelphia campaign had begun badly for the Americans. Washington&#x27;s Continental Army suffered a string of defeats at Cooch&#x27;s Bridge, Brandywine, and Paoli. After inflicting a stinging defeat on Anthony Wayne&#x27;s division at Paoli on September 20, the British army marched north to Valley Forge then west to the French Creek bridge. At this point, Howe&#x27;s right wing faced Fatland Ford on the Schuylkill River near Valley Forge while the left wing was opposite Gordon&#x27;s Ford at French Creek and the left center faced Richardson&#x27;s Ford. The American army defended all these Schuylkill crossings, plus one farther downstream at Swede&#x27;s Ford near Norristown. On September 22, a small British force under Sir William Erskine feinted north and another force mounted a demonstration at Gordon&#x27;s Ford. Howe&#x27;s moves convinced Washington that the British commander was trying to seize his supply base at Reading and turn his right flank. Washington moved north, but in the night of September 22–23, the British army reversed direction. They crossed the Schuylkill at Fatland and Richardson&#x27;s Fords without opposition, and after a brief rest, headed downstream toward Swede&#x27;s Ford where the American militia abandoned three cannons.

Charles Cornwallis subsequently seized Philadelphia for the British on September 26, dealing a blow to the revolutionary cause. Howe left a garrison of 3,462 men to defend the city, moving the bulk of his force north, some 9,728 men, to the outlying community of Germantown. With the campaigning season drawing to a close, Howe determined to locate and destroy the main American army. Howe established his headquarters at the Stenton Mansion, the former country home of James Logan.

Despite having suffered successive defeats, Washington saw an opportunity to entrap and decisively defeat the divided British army. He resolved to attack the Germantown garrison, as the last effort of the year before entering winter quarters. His plan called for a complex, ambitious assault; four columns of troops were to assail the British garrison from different directions, at night, with the goal of creating a double-envelopment. Washington&#x27;s hope was that the British would be surprised and overwhelmed much how the Hessians were at Trenton.

===British positions===

Germantown was a hamlet of stone houses, spreading from what is now known as Mount Airy on the north, to what is now Market Square in the south. Extending southwest from Market Square was Schoolhouse Lane, running to the point where Wissahickon Creek emptied from a steep gorge, into the Schuylkill River. Howe had established his main camp along the high ground of Schoolhouse and Church lanes. The western wing of the camp, under the command of Hessian general Wilhelm von Knyphausen, had a picket of two Jäger battalions, positioned on the high ground above the mouth of the Wissahickon to the far left. A brigade of Hessians, and two brigades of British regulars camped along Market Square. East of the Square, two British brigades under the command of General James Grant had encamped, with two squadrons of dragoons, and the 1st battalion of Light Infantry. The Queen&#x27;s Rangers, a unit of loyalist Americans recruited from New York, covered the right flank.

===American advance===

After dusk on October 3, the American force began the march southward toward Germantown in complete darkness. To differentiate friend from foe in the darkness, the troops were instructed to put a piece of white paper in their hats to mark them out. The Americans remained undetected by the Jäger pickets, and the main British camp was, subsequently, unaware of the American advance. For the Americans, it seemed their attempt to repeat their victory at Trenton was on the road to success. However, the darkness made communications between the American columns extremely difficult, and progress was far slower than expected. At dawn, most of the American forces had fallen too short of their intended positions, losing the element of surprise they otherwise enjoyed.

The Pennsylvania Militia, led by Brigadier General John Armstrong Sr., advanced down the Manatawny Road (Ridge Avenue) to the confluence of the Wissahickon Creek and Schuylkill River. There on the cliffs opposite General Knyphausen&#x27;s Hessian encampment, the militia set up their artillery and began a desultory fire until withdrawing back up the Manatawny road. Armstrong&#x27;s Brigade played no further part in the battle. The three remaining American columns continued their advance. One column, under the command of General John Sullivan moved down Germantown Road. A column of New Jersey militia under Brigadier General William Smallwood moved down Skippack Road to Whitemarsh Church Road, and from there to Old York Road to attack the British right. General Nathanael Greene&#x27;s column, consisting of Greene&#x27;s, General Adam Stephen&#x27;s divisions and General Alexander McDougall&#x27;s brigade, moved down Limekiln Road.

==Battle==


A thick fog clouded the battlefield throughout the day, greatly hampering coordination. The vanguard of Sullivan&#x27;s column, upon Germantown Road, opened fire upon the British pickets on Mount Airy, just after sunrise at 05:00. The British pickets fired their cannon in alarm, and resisted the American advance. Howe rode forward, thinking they were being attacked by foraging or skirmishing parties, and ordered his men to hold their ground. It took a substantial part of Sullivan&#x27;s division to finally overwhelm the British pickets, and drive them back into Germantown.

Howe, still believing his men were facing only light opposition, called out; &quot;For shame, Light Infantry! I never saw you retreat before! Form! Form! It is only a scouting party!&quot; Just then, three American guns came into action, opening fire with grapeshot. Howe and his staff quickly withdrew out of range. Several British officers were shocked to see their own soldiers rapidly falling back before the enemy attack. One British officer later described the number of attacking Americans as &quot;overwhelming&quot;.

Cut off from the main force, Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Musgrave, of the British 40th Regiment of Foot, ordered his six companies of troops, around 120 men, to barricade and fortify the stone house of Pennsylvania Chief Justice Benjamin Chew, called Cliveden. The American troops launched a determined assault against Cliveden; however, the outnumbered defenders repulsed their attempts, inflicting heavy casualties. Washington called a council of war to decide how to deal with the fortification. Some of his subordinates favoured bypassing Clivden entirely, leaving a regiment behind to besiege it. However, Washington&#x27;s artillery commander, Brigadier General Henry Knox, advised it was unwise to allow a fortified garrison to remain under enemy control in the rear of a forward advance. Washington concurred.

General William Maxwell&#x27;s brigade, which had been held in reserve, was brought forward to storm Cliveden, partially led by a volunteer aide from General Washington&#x27;s own staff, Lieutenant Colonel John Laurens, who had been shot through his right and therefore dominant shoulder earlier in the battle; he had continued to fight with his aide riband wrapped around his arm and his sword in his left and non-dominant hand. Knox positioned four 3-pound cannon out of musket range to bombard the mansion. However, the thick walls of Cliveden withstood the bombardment from the light field guns. The Americans launched a second wave of infantry assaults, all of which were repulsed with heavy losses. The few Americans who managed to get inside the mansion were shot or bayoneted. It was becoming clear to the Americans that Cliveden was not going to be taken easily. Among this assault was Lieutenant John Marshall of the Virginia Line, the future Chief Justice of the United States, who was wounded during the attack.

Before completely disregarding the notion of taking Cliveden, Laurens was offered the idea of burning or smoking the British out of the house. He took the idea and, according Gregory Massey&#x27;s biography, he sent men to gather firewood to pile at the door. Once enough had gathered, Laurens and Marshall began to command the attack of charging to the front steps, dropping the firewood, and in groups, rushing to set fire to the wood. Laurens himself was sent forward with a torch with his companion, Major John White. The fire did not catch. While on the front steps of Cliveden, however, Laurens was under a barrage of gunfire and supposedly wounded a second time by a bayonet in his left side. Major White was shot and later pronounced dead. Both men were forced from the door and the Chevalier de Mauduit convinced Laurens to cease his fighting before he later was moved to have a surgeon see to his wounds. 
Prior to Maxwell&#x27;s futile attack against Cliveden, Sullivan&#x27;s division advanced beyond in the fog. Sullivan deployed Brigadier General Thomas Conway&#x27;s brigade to the right, and Brigadier General Anthony Wayne&#x27;s brigade to the left before advancing on the British center-left. The 1st and 2nd Maryland Brigades of Sullivan&#x27;s column paused frequently to fire volleys into the fog. While the tactic was effective in suppressing enemy opposition, his troops rapidly ran low on ammunition. Wayne&#x27;s brigade to the left of the road moved ahead, and became precariously separated from Sullivan&#x27;s main line. As the Americans launched their attack on Cliveden, Wayne&#x27;s brigade heard the disquieting racket from Knox&#x27;s artillery pieces to their rear. To their right, the firing from Sullivan&#x27;s men died down as the Marylanders ran low on ammunition. Wayne&#x27;s men began to panic in their apparent isolation, and so he ordered them to fall back. Sullivan was subsequently forced back, although the regiments fought a stubborn rear-guard action. Since the British units pursuing them were redirected to fight Greene&#x27;s column, Sullivan&#x27;s men fell back in good order.

Meanwhile, Nathanael Greene&#x27;s column on Limekiln Road had finally caught up with the bulk of the Americans at Germantown. Greene&#x27;s vanguard engaged the British pickets at Luken&#x27;s Mill, driving them back after a savage skirmish. The fog that clung to the field was compounded by palls of smoke from the cannon and musket fire, throwing Greene&#x27;s column into disarray and confusion. One of Greene&#x27;s brigades, under Brigadier General Adam Stephen, veered off-course and began following Meetinghouse Road, instead of rendezvousing at Market Square with the rest of Greene&#x27;s troops. The wayward brigade collided with Wayne&#x27;s brigade, and mistook them for redcoats. The two American brigades opened fire on each other in the fog, causing both to flee. The withdrawal of Wayne&#x27;s New Jersey Brigade, having suffered heavy losses attacking Cliveden, left Conway&#x27;s right flank exposed.

To the north, an American column led by McDougall came under attack by the Loyalist troops of the Queen&#x27;s Rangers, and the Guards of the British reserve. After a brutal contest, McDougall&#x27;s brigade was forced to retreat, having suffered heavy losses. Despite the reversal in fortune, the Continentals were still convinced of a possible victory. The 9th Virginia Regiment of Greene&#x27;s column launched a determined attack on the British lines as planned, managing to break through and capturing a number of prisoners. However, they were soon surrounded by two arriving British brigades under Cornwallis. Cornwallis then launched a counter-charge, cutting off the Virginians completely, forcing them to surrender. Greene, upon learning of the main army&#x27;s defeat and withdrawal, realized he stood alone against Howe&#x27;s entire army, and so withdrew.

The primary attacks on the British and Hessian camp had all been repulsed with heavy casualties. Washington ordered Armstrong and Smallwood&#x27;s men to withdraw. Maxwell&#x27;s brigade, still having failed to capture Cliveden, was forced to fall back. Howe ordered a pursuit, harrying the retreating Americans for some , though he did not follow up on his victory. The pursuing British forces were finally forced to retire in the face of resistance from Greene&#x27;s infantry, Wayne&#x27;s artillery, and a detachment of dragoons, as well as the coming of the night.

On October 6, there was a brief cease-fire. A little terrier that was identified from its collar as belonging to General Howe was formally transferred from Washington&#x27;s camp to Howe&#x27;s under a flag of truce. The little terrier that had been found wandering on the battlefield was brought to Washington, who had the dog fed, cleaned and brushed before being returned to Howe.

==Casualties==

Of the 11,000 men Washington led into battle, 30 officers and 122 men were killed, and 117 officers and 404 men were wounded. According to a Hessian staff officer, some 438 had been taken prisoner by the British, including Colonel George Mathews and the entire 9th Virginia Regiment. Brigadier General Francis Nash, whose North Carolina brigade covered the American retreat, had his left leg taken off by a cannonball, and died on October 8 at the home of Adam Gotwals. His body was interred with military honors on October 9 at the Mennonite Meetinghouse in Towamencin. Major John White, who was shot at Cliveden, died on October 10. Lieutenant-Colonel William Smith, who was wounded carrying the flag of truce to Cliveden, also died from his wounds. In total, 57 Americans, over one-third of all those killed in the battle, died in the attack on Cliveden.

British casualties in the battle were 71 killed, 448 wounded and 14 missing; only 24 of whom were Hessians. British officers killed in action include Brigadier General James Agnew and Lieutenant-Colonel John Bird. Lieutenant-Colonel William Walcott of the 5th Regiment of Foot was mortally wounded, and later died.

Wyck House served as a hospital during the battle.

==Analysis==

Washington&#x27;s ambitious plan failed for several factors:
* Washington mistakenly believed his troops were sufficiently trained and experienced to launch such a complicated, coordinated assault.
* Success of the plan required constant communication between the many columns of his army and precise timing. Communication was lackluster because of the night march, and it was further handicapped by the fog.
* When the British 40th Foot put up stubborn resistance, Stephen disobeyed orders and attempted to assail the Chew House. All attempts were repulsed. Stephen was later court-martialed and cashiered from military service after evidence surfaced that he was intoxicated during the battle.

Washington had intended for his attack to be a second Trenton. Had everything gone according to plan, Washington may have trapped and destroyed a second major British force. Coupled with Burgoyne&#x27;s defeat at Saratoga, the defeat of Howe at Germantown could have compelled Lord North and the British government to sue for peace.

==Aftermath==

 The battle was a victory for the British, but the long-term strategic consequences favored the Americans. Howe had, once again, failed to follow up on his success and allowed Washington to escape with his army, leading to their encampment at Valley Forge.

The battle in particular made a strong impression upon the French court that the Americans would prove worthy allies. Sir George Otto Trevelyan, in Volume IV of his &quot;History of the American Revolution&quot;, concluded that although the battle had unquestionably been a defeat for the Americans, it was of &quot;great and enduring service to the American cause&quot;. In particular, the engagement persuaded the Comte de Vergennes to vouch for the United States against Britain. He continues:

John Fiske, in &quot;The American Revolution&quot; (1891), wrote:

Eight Army National Guard units (103rd Eng Bn, A/1-104th Cav, 109th FA, 111th Inf, 113th Inf, 116th Inf, 175th Inf and 198th Sig Bn) and one active Regular Army Field Artillery battalion (1-5th FA) are derived from American units that participated in the Battle of Germantown. There are only thirty currently existing units in the U.S. Army with lineages that go back to the colonial era.

<text>The Canadian Museum of History () is a national museum on anthropology, Canadian history, cultural studies, and ethnology in Gatineau, Quebec, Canada. The purpose of the museum is to promote the heritage of Canada, as well as support related research. The museum is based in a designed by Douglas Cardinal.

The museum originated from a museum established by the Geological Survey of Canada in 1856, which later expanded to include an anthropology division in 1910. In 1927, the institution was renamed the National Museum of Canada. The national museum was later split into several separate institutions in 1968, with the anthropology and human history departments forming the National Museum of Man. The museum relocated to its present location in Gatineau in 1989 and adopted the name Canadian Museum of Civilization () the following year. In 2013, the museum adopted its current name, the Canadian Museum of History, and modified its mandate to emphasize Canadian identity and history.

The museum&#x27;s collection contains over three million artifacts and documents, with some on display in the museum&#x27;s permanent exhibitions. The museum also hosts and organizes a number of temporary, travelling, and online exhibitions, like the Virtual Museum of New France.

==History==
===Early museum (1856–1968)===
The Canadian Museum of History originates from the collecting efforts of the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC), an organization established in 1842 in Montreal. In 1856 the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada passed an act that enabled the GSC to establish a museum to exhibit items found from its geological and archaeological field trips; with the museum initially established in Montreal on Great St. James Street (now Saint Jacques Street). The museum held its first ethnological exhibit from 1862 to 1863, showcasing stone implements and fragments of pottery by First Nations. In 1877, the museum mandate was formally expanded to include the study of modern fauna and flora, in addition to human history, languages, and traditions.

In 1881, the museum relocated from Montreal to downtown Ottawa to what is now referred to as Former Geological Survey of Canada Building; although space in the new facility soon proved to be inadequate, with the Royal Society of Canada petitioning the federal government to build a new building for the museum by 1896. Preliminary plans for a new building were drawn up by 1899, although work on the building did not begin until 1906. In the following year, management of the museum was handed over from the GSC to the Department of Mines, with the mandate formally expanded to include anthropological studies. The new museum building, the Victoria Memorial Museum Building, was also completed in 1910, although it was not opened to the public until 1911. 

Under the Department of Mines, the museum formally established an anthropology division under the direction of Edward Sapir in 1910. Another anthropologist, Marius Barbeau, was also hired by the museum in the following year to assist Sapir. The anthropology division was charged with the preservation of the cultural heritage of people in Canada and assembling objects related to these cultures. Under Sapir&#x27;s direction, the institution&#x27;s research initially focused on Aboriginal communities across Canada they believed were imperilled by rapid acculturation. The museum&#x27;s first anthropological exhibits were organized by Sapir and his protege, Franz Boas. Since this period, the museum had become a centre for Canadian anthropology, having attracted notable anthropologists including Diamond Jenness after the Second World War.

In 1927, the museum division of the Department of Mines was renamed the &quot;National Museum of Canada&quot;. Management of the National Museum is transferred from the Department of Mines to the Department of Resources and Development in 1950. In 1965, the museum was split into two branches, one focused on natural history and another on human history. The mandate of the museum further expanded in the following decades, with the museum assuming the management of the Canadian War Museum in 1958, and its human history branch establishing a history division in 1964.

===Museum of anthropology and history (1968–present)===
On 1 April 1968, the branches of the National Museum of Canada were formally split into separate museums. The Canadian Museum of History originated from the human history branch of the museum, initially incorporated as the &quot;National Museum of Man&quot;. The natural history branch of the former National Museum of Canada became the National Museum of Natural Sciences (later renamed the Canadian Museum of Nature), while the science and technology branch became the National Museum of Science and Technology (later renamed the Canada Science and Technology Museum). The National Museums of Canada Corporation was formed by the federal government in order to manage these national museums, in addition to the National Gallery of Canada. Although the institutions were split, the National Museum of Man and the National Museum of Natural History continued to share the Victoria Memorial building; with the National Museum of Man occupying the western half of the building.

In April 1972, the National Museum of Man established a Communications Division in order to provide media communications regarding the museum&#x27;s education and information programs. During the 1970s, the staff of the institution adopted a philosophy that stressed public access to its heritage collection. Because the Victoria Memorial Museum building had insufficient space to exhibit the museum&#x27;s growing collection, the museum&#x27;s collection and staff were scattered across 17 buildings, with these buildings acting as decentralized units of the museum.

In 1980, management of the National Museums of Canada Corporation is transferred to the Department of Communications. The following year in June 1981, the cabinet of Canada approved several plans concerning several national museums of Canada, including moving the National Museum of Man into a new structure. The plan was formally announced to the public in February 1982. After a study of potential locations saw four sites in Ottawa and one in Gatineau. A site acquired by the National Capital Commission (NCC) from the E.B Eddy Company in Gatineau was chosen as the site for the new museum; due to it already being public land, being linked to Confederation Boulevard, and because it was prominently visible from the Ottawa River. The site was also selected because the NCC had desired to develop Hull, and incorporate it into the design of the capital region; while officials in Gatineau had similar desires to develop the area into an urban park. On 10 February 1983, the site for the new museum was announced to the public; and Douglas Cardinal Architect Limited was named as the project&#x27;s design architect, in association with Montreal-based architectural firm Tétreault, Parent, Languedoc et Associés. The design created by Cardinal was approved in 1983 by the Cabinet of Canada.

In an effort to avoid stereotypes in languages, the name of the museum was changed to the &quot;Canadian Museum of Civilization&quot; in 1986. In 1988, the institution absorbed the museum operated by the department of the Minister responsible for Canada Post Corporation, although its philatelic collection was transferred to the National Archives of Canada. The museum opened its new building in Gatineau in 1989. However, the building opened with only two permanent exhibitions, Canada Hall and the exhibitions on the Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast, as budgetary shortfalls prevented the museum from opening the exhibitions it had originally planned for the museum.

In 1990, the &quot;Museum Act&quot; was passed by the federal government, replacing the defunct National Museums of Canada Corporation and forming several new entities to manage the national museums of Canada; with the Canadian Museum of Civilization corporation formed on 1 July 1990 to manage the Canadian Museum of Civilization, and the Canadian War Museum.

====21st century====
In 2007, the museum organized a temporary exhibition, &quot;Treasures from China&quot;, in partnership with the National Museum of China. The partnership saw artifacts leave China to be exhibited only at the Canadian Museum of Civilization. As a part of the agreement, the Canadian Museum of Civilization prepared Indigenous Canadian artifacts for its own exhibition, &quot;First Peoples of Canada: Masterworks from the Canadian Museum of Civilization&quot;, at the Palace Museum in Beijing.

In October 2012, James Moore, the minister of Canadian Heritage announced the ministry would provide $25 million to overhaul the museum and renovate Canada Hall. The government later announced plans to update and reopen the gallery in 2017, coinciding with the 150th anniversary of Canada. Approximately 24,000 people from across nine Canadian cities were surveyed about the updates to the exhibition. The museum consulted a women&#x27;s history committee, an indigenous history committee, and three historic time-period committees. 

In December 2013, the &quot;Canadian Museum of History Act&quot; received Royal Assent, which shifted the museum&#x27;s mandate from developing a collection with a &quot;special but not exclusive reference to Canada,&quot; to one that enhanced the knowledge of Canadian history and identity; and expanding the museum&#x27;s focus to include social and political history. The Act also changed the institution&#x27;s name from the &quot;Canadian Museum of Civilization&quot; to the &quot;Canadian Museum of History&quot;. The Canadian Postal Museum, a department of the Canadian Museum of Civilization corporation that operated from within the institution was shut down in 2012 as a result of the museum&#x27;s transition into the Canadian Museum of History.

Some have criticized the new mandate and updating of Canada Hall as a part of a wider plan by the incumbent Conservative government to redirect public historical understanding to emphasize aspects of Canadian military history and monarchism; as well as elide problematic elements of Canadian history in favour of achievements. However, the museum contended that new exhibits planned for the museum will include a range of themes and topics, and will also explore the country&#x27;s &quot;dark episodes&quot;. The updated gallery was completed at approximately $30 million and was opened on Canada Day in 2017 by Charles, Prince of Wales and Mélanie Joly, the minister of Canadian Heritage. Partisan concerns were alleviated after Canadian History Hall was unveiled to the public.

==Site==

The museum is situated on a 9.6-hectare (23.7-acre) plot of land, formerly known as &quot;Parc Laurier&quot;. The museum site is the first Canadian national museum to be located on the Gatineau side of the National Capital Region, and the first to be located adjacent to the Ottawa River. 

The site is bounded by the western access point for the Alexandra Bridge, the Ottawa River to the east, a paper production plant to the south, and Laurier Street to the west. The median of the property extends from Laurier Street to the river. From Laurier Street, the property descends towards the Ottawa River at a 5.5 per cent grade; with the portion of the property closest to Laurier Street at an elevation of , while the riverfront is at an elevation of . Because of the property&#x27;s low elevation, the construction of the museum building was limited to the portion of the property closer to Laurier Street.
The site includes a museum building with two wings. The two wings wrap around and are connected by a large hemispherical entrance plaza which contains its food services, lounge, library, and underground parking. The parkland and open space between the two wings are intended to represent the &quot;plains over which mankind migrated&quot; over millennia. A large staircase east of the entrance plaza descends to the museum&#x27;s lower plaza and gardens adjacent to the riverside park.

A pedestrian and cycling pathway is situated on the riverfront portion of the property, with the pathways continuing north into Jacques-Cartier Park, a municipal park north of the property.

===Building===
The structure was designed by Douglas Cardinal. The building&#x27;s infrastructure includes approximately of concrete, and 7,300 tonnes of steel. Cardinal sought to create form a &quot;sculptural icon&quot; for the country, encouraged by then-prime minister, Pierre Trudeau, to develop a symbol that &quot;enshrined our cultures&quot;. As a result, the building was the first structure in the National Capital Region that incorporates Indigenous architectural designs. Cardinal&#x27;s design for the building was largely influenced by his understanding of how geography helped shaped Canada&#x27;s history and culture.

The museum building has over of exhibition space, more than any other museum in Canada. In addition to exhibition space, the building also contains three restaurants, a boutique store, and two live performance theatres, including a 500-seat theatre for live performances. The building also has a 295-seat 3D theatre that uses a Barco digital projector. Before the installation of the Barco projector in 2016, the 3D theatre used a IMAX projector and was branded as an IMAX theatre.

Water is drawn from the Ottawa River to heat and cool the building. The building&#x27;s energy needs are met by two substations in Gatineau, with two additional backup generators also available if both substations fail.

====Exterior====

The building&#x27;s exterior is clad with of Tyndall stone; with the material being selected because of its durability and its relationship with glaciers.

Cardinal sought to build a structure that appeared to be &quot;flowing with the contours of the land,&quot; and simple lines and forms could be used to display the idea of movement. The building&#x27;s design draws upon Art Nouveau styles to illustrate Canada&#x27;s geography at the end of the Last Glacial Period when the landscape was largely uniform; with certain elements of the building evoking igloos earth lodges, and longhouses.

The building includes a cantilevered northern/curatorial wing and a southern wing that houses most of the museum&#x27;s public facilities, including its galleries, and theatres. The curatorial wing was designed to evoke outcroppings of the Canadian Shield, while the southern public wing with its glass-fronted Grand Hall, was intended to evoke an image of a melting glacier. The southern wing&#x27;s copper roof represents vegetation&#x27;s recolonization of the lands once covered by glacial till. The copper roof is nearly and weighs approximately 90 tonnes. Both wings are curvaceous on their river sides to blend into their landscapes, although their street-side façade is more angular. 

The NCC placed several restrictions on the building design, that the building does not obstruct the view of the Ottawa River, and that the building does not obstruct delineated &quot;viewing cones&quot; of Parliament Hill from the Gatineau side of the river. Because of these restrictions, the buildings were designed with a low-profile, to avoid obscuring the view for buildings across the street. From certain angles, the building appears as two separate pavilions, with an opening between these two sections providing an unobstructed view of Parliament Hill from Laurier Street. Considerations also needed to be taken to protect artifacts displayed in the building. Windows were triple-glazed and coated with a film that helps contain radiant heat and reduce solar ultraviolet rays, and the southern wing&#x27;s Grand Hall was intentionally designed to face direct sunlight only in the morning.

The building was designed to create an &quot;ever-changing pattern&quot; of shadows across the structure&#x27;s surface, with most of the building&#x27;s exterior lighting kept below 30 lux to allow viewers to see deeper shadows at night.

==Exhibitions==
The museum hosts several permanent and temporary exhibitions on anthropology, ethnology, and history. Artifacts from the museum&#x27;s collection are exhibited in these exhibitions. In addition, travelling exhibitions are occasionally held at the museum. The museum has also created several online exhibitions, like the Virtual Museum of New France. 

Permanent exhibitions include First Peoples Hall, Canadian History Hall, the Canadian Children&#x27;s Museum, the Canadian Stamp Collection, and two exhibitions on the Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast in the building&#x27;s Grand Hall. First Peoples Hall is situated on the first floor of the building, whereas the Canada Hall is situated on the third level of the building. First Peoples Hall is situated next to the Grand Hall, with its exhibitions located on the ground floor.

Many of the exhibits that were designed in the 1980s for the new building were influenced by the director of the museum, George F. MacDonald, his personal admiration for Pacific Northwest Coast art and culture, and the communication theories of his mentor, Marshall McLuhan. Merging exhibits detailing the Indigenous peoples of Canada with other Canadian historical exhibits were considered by the exhibition design team when plans were being made to move the museum in the 1980s. However, it was later decided to depict both topics as separate exhibitions, resulting in both exhibitions being planned by different teams with separate budgets. This decision was later reversed in 2017 when the museum reopened the Canadian History Hall exhibition with Indigenous exhibits incorporated throughout its exhibit.

===First Peoples Hall===

First Peoples Hall is an exhibition opened in 2003, that explores Canada&#x27;s First Nations, Inuit, and Métis peoples. The exhibition occupies of space on the ground floor of the building. The hall contains more than 2,000 objects on display. Most of the exhibition space is devoted to changing exhibits, to keep up with contemporary views on traditional cultures and current issues. However, First Peoples Hall does have some space devoted to long-term exhibits. These long-term exhibits explore topics that are less subject to changing interpretations; like ancient history, Indigenous languages, and the history of the relationship between Indigenous and European cultures. The exhibition is organized into several sections, such as the &quot;Ways of Knowing&quot;, &quot;An Ancient Bond with the Land&quot;, and &quot;The Arrival of Strangers&quot;.

The exhibition was designed to &quot;deconstruct and supersede&quot; histories that visitors are familiar with. Exhibits were designed to address issues of stereotyping Indigenous identity, and the diversity and cultural distinctiveness between Indigenous nations; with many of the exhibits linking identity to Indigenous land claims in Canada. Additionally, exhibits were designed to portray Indigenous peoples as living peoples in the modern world. Archaeological exhibits in First Peoples Hall are themed to reinforce the fact that the Indigenous peoples of Canada have occupied the land since time immemorial, and that Canadian history has a long and complex history preceding European colonization. Additionally, many of these archaeological exhibits are designed to confront the notion of Eurasian technological supremacy at the time of first contact with the Americas. The exhibition concludes with contemporary issue exhibits, which explore recent clashes between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples in Canada over land and resources.

The curatorial model used to develop the exhibition conformed to the suggestions provided in the 1992 recommendations from the federal Task Force on Museums and First Peoples. The content and messaging of First Peoples Hall were determined in consultation with indigenous communities across Canada. Acting upon the task force&#x27;s recommendation to establish partnerships with First Nation representatives whose cultures were being exhibited, an advisory committee of 15 Indigenous members was formed to help define the exhibition&#x27;s thematic structure and messaging. As a result, exhibits in First Peoples Hall take a &quot;multivocal&quot; approach, where different perspectives can be distinguished within the exhibition; and explanatory fields like archaeology, ethnology and traditional Indigenous knowledge are juxtaposed, and contestatory with one another in some cases.

===Canadian History Hall===

Canadian History Hall is an exhibition that explores Canadian history. Canadian History Hall is approximately , and includes over 14 projectors and 58 screens used in the exhibition. The exhibition includes three galleries and a long curved walkway that serves as the entrance to the three galleries. The entrance walkway is decorated with 101 silhouettes of Canadian cultural symbols and activities, as well as national landmarks. Canadian History Hall&#x27;s galleries centre around a hub that was designed by Douglas Cardinal to resemble Chaudière Falls. The hub features a large image of Canada on the floor. The image of Canada is made up of 121 satellite photos taken by the Canadian Space Agency, that were stitched together to form a single image.

The exhibition summarizes over 15,000 years of history and is divided into three era-centric galleries, Early Canada: From Earliest Times to 1763, Colonial Canada: 1763 to 1914, and Modern Canada: 1914 to the Present Day. The first two galleries are located on the same floor, while the third gallery occupies the mezzanine above the two galleries. The galleries are designed to showcase events and &quot;turning points&quot; in each respective era through the multimedia presentations and the artifacts on display. Each gallery is further organized into six separate &quot;vignettes&quot; that are thematically different, but interconnected with one another. The vignettes are primarily organized temporally, although some are specifically focused on a specific aspect of Canadian history. The exhibition takes a largely didactic approach with its subject and is particularly focused on the country&#x27;s political and economic history, as well as the experience of Indigenous peoples. According to the exhibit team&#x27;s head, David Morrison, Indigenous peoples and their relationship with newcomers will serve as an important overarching theme of Canadian History Hall.

Early Canada explores provides a summary of Indigenous history prior to the arrival of the Europeans as well as early Canadian colonies like New France. The gallery includes Indigenous artifacts, narrative recounts of Indigenous interactions between Norse, English and French explorers, and detailed accounts on the North American fur trade, the spread of disease within Indigenous populations, and the Beaver Wars. Colonial Canada explores Canada under British rule since the conquest of New France, as well as post-Confederation Canada to 1914. Modern Canada explores Canada&#x27;s recent history, up to the arrival of Syrian refugees in the 2010s. The latter two galleries provide detailed histories on the Seven Years&#x27; War, treaties signed between various Indigenous groups and the Crown, the push for responsible government, Canadian Confederation, the world wars, the Canadian Indian residential school system, Quebec nationalism, and multiculturalism in Canada.

There are over 1,500 artifacts on display in Canadian History Hall. Historic artifacts include a 3,600 to 3,900 years old ivory carving believed to be the oldest representation of a human face found in Canada; James Wolfe coat; and handcuffs worn by Louis Riel prior to his execution; Maurice Richard&#x27;s hockey jersey; Terry Fox&#x27;s T-shirt; Tommy Douglas&#x27;s hat; the table on which the proclamation of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot; was signed by Queen Elizabeth II in 1982; Randy Bachman&#x27;s guitar, and the sewing machine which Joan O&#x27;Malley sewed the first Maple Leaf flag. There are 40 linear films shown at the exhibition, including &quot;Origin Stories&quot;, a film that illustrates how the Anishinaabe believed the earth was formed. &quot;Origin Stories&quot; is displayed along the curved wall of the Canadian History Hall&#x27;s entrance.

The modular structure of the exhibits enables the museum to swap segments easier. The number of exhibits in the galleries may also expand, with the museum having reserved enough space to allow for the addition of new exhibits in the three galleries.

====Pre-2017 exhibition====

Canadian History Hall&#x27;s predecessor, Canada Hall, opened as an inaugural exhibit at the museum in 1989. The original exhibition was divided into 23 modules that were arranged chronologically, beginning with the Norse colonization of North America. The gallery aimed to promote Canadian multiculturalism, having portrayed a social history that depicted a &quot;march of immigrants&quot; from east to west, and the success of different groups in Canada. However, these modules provided little in-depth consideration for pre-colonial Indigenous cultures, which were only explored in the museum&#x27;s other exhibitions prior to Canada Hall&#x27;s updates in the 2010s. The original design of Canada Hall recreated historical settings with period rooms and full-scale historical buildings incorporated into the exhibition; reflecting McLuhan&#x27;s theories, and innovations adopted by entertainment pavilions like Disney&#x27;s Epcot. 

Canada Hall was closed to the public in September 2014 to enable renovations and significant updates to the exhibition. The exhibition reopened in 2017 significantly changed from its original design. Nearly all of the life-sized dioramas were dismantled as a part of the exhibition&#x27;s update. St. Onuphrius Church, an original early-20th-century Ukrainian church from the Canadian Prairies that was later relocated to the museum, is the only remaining life-sized diorama in the exhibition.

===Canadian Children&#x27;s Museum===
The Canadian Children&#x27;s Museum is Canada&#x27;s largest exhibition centre designed specifically for children with over of space. The museum uses more than 15,000 artifacts, props, and hands-on items for use in its exhibitions and programs. These items include art, clothing, games, photographs, and toys. The museum includes an International Village, as well as Canadian-themed attractions that were added into the exhibition in 2007.

In 2018, the museum announced it would undertake a renewal project in January 2020. The museum announced the revamp would reflect how children play and learn, and will remove more dated exhibits from the exhibition, like the post office and telephone booth. It reopened in May 2022.

===Canadian Stamp Collection===
The Canadian Stamp Collection is a stamp collection of more than 3,000 stamps and includes every Canadian stamp issued since 1851. The stamp collection was housed at the Canadian Postal Museum until 2012 when the postal museum closed and its stamp collection relocated to the Canadian Museum of History. The Canadian Museum of History opened a permanent exhibition for the collection in 2014 in partnership with Canada Post. Stamps that are exhibited in the exhibition are showcased with artifacts that either inspired its creation or were used to make the stamp.

===Grand Hall exhibitions===

Grand Hall features two permanent exhibitions on the Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast, &quot;First Peoples of the Northwest Coast&quot; and &quot;From Time Immemorial — Tsimshian Prehistory&quot;. The exhibits include totem poles and other artifacts. The exhibitions were developed as a collaboration between the museum&#x27;s curators and Indigenous cultural specialists in the 1980s.

In 1993, a large mural titled &quot;Morning Star&quot; was added to the domed ceiling of the Grand Hall. The mural was created by Alex Janvier and is symbolic of Indigenous life and history. In addition to the two permanent exhibitions, the Grand Hall is also used to host other major events. In addition to its permanent exhibitions, the Grand Hall has also been used to host temporary exhibitions.

==Collections==

As of June 2021, the Canadian Museum of History&#x27;s permanent collection includes more than three million artifacts, documents, works of art, and other specimens. This includes over one million photographs, 72,000 sound recordings and 18,000 films and videotapes. The collection takes up approximately of shelf space. Approximately 218,000 artifacts have been digitized and made accessible online by the museum. 

The museum&#x27;s permanent collection dates back to the collection established by the Geological Survey of Canada in the 1860s. The museum&#x27;s collection of artifacts has expanded through the institution&#x27;s research programs. The first collection representing Indigenous peoples was established by the Geological Survey of Canada, with other parts of the collection having been acquired by government officials and missionaries working outside Ottawa. The collection continued to expand after the anthropology department was established in 1910, and the museum began a systematic program of documenting Indigenous cultures and lineages.

The museum&#x27;s collection of Indigenous items is the largest in Canada and is the only major collection with a national scope in the country. The museum also possesses the world&#x27;s largest collection of totem poles. The Sacred Materials Project was created by the museum to help maintain Indigenous sacred items, and facilitate the repatriation of select items to their respective communities. The project provides funds for Indigenous representatives to view the museum&#x27;s collections and discuss the repatriation of identified sacred items, as well as identify other objects in the collection that require ritualistic care.

The museum&#x27;s permanent collection contains several smaller collections, like the Windfield Farm Collection. The Windfield Farm Collection was acquired by the museum in 2013 and contains documents, photographs, memorabilia and trophies, including the Kentucky Derby trophy won by Northern Dancer. The museum&#x27;s collection of flags is also the largest in the country. 

Other notable items in the museum&#x27;s permanent collection includes a Contempra phone, the first telephone to be designed and manufactured in Canada; cough syrup from the 1918 influenza pandemic; the original plaster for Bill Reid&#x27;s &quot;Spirit of Haida Gwaii&quot;; ten large heraldic sculptures known as The Queen&#x27;s Beasts; and royal gown worn by Elizabeth II during her royal tours of Canada. The museum also contains a number of ice hockey artifacts, including game-used National Hockey League sticks, hockey cards, and the world&#x27;s oldest existing ice hockey stick. The ice hockey stick dates back to the mid-1830s and was acquired by the museum in 2015 for $300,000.

In addition to its permanent collection, the Canadian Museum of History also co-manages collections with other institutions. In July 1999, the museum entered an agreement with the Canadian Nursing Association (CNA), the Canadian War Museum, and the National Archives of Canada to create the Canadian Nursing History Collection. This collection includes over 9,000 photographs, 1,600 audiovisual materials, and over of textual records from the CNA, the Nursing Sisters Association of Canada, and the Helen Mussallem Collection. Approximately 950 documented artifacts from this collection are deposited at the Canadian Museum of History. Items from the collection at the Canadian Museum of History include 167 nurses&#x27; caps, dating from 1895 to 1983. In June 2005, the museum opened a temporary exhibition that focused on this collection. In 2021, the Canadian Museum of History entered into an agreement to house and maintain artifacts from Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame.

===Library and archives===
The museum&#x27;s resource centre operates a library and archives. As of 2015, the museum&#x27;s library has more than 60,000 books, over 2,000 journals and magazines, and over 1,000 DVDs, CDs, and video tapes. The museum&#x27;s rare and old books collection includes Paul-Émile Borduas&#x27;s &quot;Refus Global&quot; (1948) and Pierre François Xavier de Charlevoix&#x27;s &quot;Histoire et description générale de la Nouvelle-France&quot; (1744).

===Research===
The museum&#x27;s collection is used to support research in anthropology, archaeology, Indigenous people in Canada, linguistics, material culture, multicultural communities, social and political history and museology in Canada. The museum also publishes its own academic journal, the &quot;Mercury Series&quot;; on history, archaeology, and anthropology. The journal has been published in partnership with the University of Ottawa Press since 2012. The museum has also published the academic journal &quot;Material Culture Review&quot; in partnership with the Canada Science and Technology Museum since the 1970s. The journal provides a forum for research on historical artifacts collected by Canadian museums.

==Management==
The Canadian Museum of History is managed by a federal Crown corporation of the same name under the Department of Canadian Heritage&#x27;s portfolio. The museum is one of two national museums managed by the corporation, the other being the Canadian War Museum. The corporation also administers the Virtual Museum of New France, a virtual museum and online exhibition of the Canadian Museum of History; and the Virtual Museum of Canada, an administrative program that supports the development of online projects for museums and heritage organizations across Canada. The Virtual Museum of Canada was an online portal for virtual exhibits in Canada until 2020, when the Virtual Museum of Canada&#x27;s website was decommissioned, and the project was reoriented into a support program.

Management of the corporation is conducted through an 11-member board of trustees. Trustees are appointed by the Minister of Canadian Heritage, with approval from the Governor-in-Council. In turn, the board appoints the corporation&#x27;s president and chief executive officer. The corporation reports to the Parliament of Canada through the Minister of Canadian Heritage. The corporation&#x27;s mandate is defined under the &quot;Museums Act&quot;.

The corporation was established as the Canadian Museum of Civilization in June 1990 through the &quot;Museums Act&quot;; an Act that was later amended in 2014. The corporation adopted its current name in 2013. The Crown corporation was one of several that succeeded the defunct National Museums of Canada Corporation, a Crown corporation that managed most of the country&#x27;s national museums until its dissolution in 1988.

<text>In music, montage (literally &quot;putting together&quot;) or sound collage (&quot;gluing together&quot;) is a technique where newly branded sound objects or compositions, including songs, are created from collage, also known as Musique concrète. This is often done through the use of sampling, while some sound collages are produced by gluing together sectors of different vinyl records. Like its visual cousin, sound collage works may have a completely different effect than that of the component parts, even if the original parts are recognizable or from a single source. Audio collage was a feature of the audio art of John Cage, Fluxus, postmodern hip-hop and postconceptual digital art.

==History==
The origin of sound collage can be traced back to the works of Biber&#x27;s programmatic sonata &quot;Battalia&quot; (1673) and Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; (1789), and certain passages in Mahler symphonies as collage, but the first fully developed collages occur in a few works by Charles Ives, whose piece &quot;Central Park in the Dark&quot; (1906) creates the feeling of a walk in the city by layering several distinct melodies and quotations on top of each other.

Earlier traditional forms and procedures such as the quodlibet, medley, potpourri, and centonization differ from collage in that the various elements in them are made to fit smoothly together, whereas in a collage clashes of key, timbre, texture, meter, tempo, or other discrepancies are important in helping to preserve the individuality of the constituent elements and to convey the impression of a heterogeneous assemblage. What made their technique true collage, however, was the juxtaposition of quotations and unrelated melodies, either by layering them or by moving between them in quick succession.

A first documented instance of sound collage created as electronic music is &quot;Wochenende&quot; (in English, &quot;Weekend&quot;), a collage of words, music and sounds created by film-maker and media artist Walter Ruttmann in 1928. Later, in 1948, Pierre Schaeffer used the techniques of sound collage to create the first piece of musique concrète, &quot;Étude aux chemins de fer&quot;, which was assembled from recordings of trains. Schaeffer created this piece by recording sounds of trains onto several vinyl records, some of which had lock grooves allowing them to play in a continuous loop. He then set up multiple turntables in his studio, allowing him to trigger and mix together the various train sounds as needed.

According to music theorist Cristina Losada, the third movement of Luciano Berio&#x27;s &quot;Sinfonia&quot; is often considered &quot;the prototype of a musical collage.&quot; In an essay written in 1937, John Cage expressed an interest in using extra-musical sound materials and came to distinguish between found sounds, which he called noise, and musical sounds, examples of which included: rain, static between radio channels, and &quot;a truck at fifty miles per hour&quot;. Cage began in 1939 to create a series of found sounds works that explored his stated aims, the first being &quot;Imaginary Landscape #1&quot; for instruments including two variable speed turntables with frequency recordings.

Important modern sound collage pieces were created by Pierre Schaeffer and the Groupe de Recherches Musicales. In 1950s and early-1960s Schaeffer, Pierre Henry, Olivier Messiaen, Pierre Boulez, Jean Barraqué, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Edgard Varèse, Iannis Xenakis, Michel Philippot, and Arthur Honegger all worked with sound collage. Examples are &quot;Étude I&quot; (1951) and &quot;Étude II&quot; (1951) by Boulez, &quot;Timbres-durées&quot; (1952) by Messiaen, &quot;Étude aux mille collants&quot; (1952) by Stockhausen, &quot;Le microphone bien tempéré&quot; (1952) and &quot;La voile d&#x27;Orphée&quot; (1953) by Henry, &quot;Étude I&quot; (1953) by Philippot, &quot;Étude&quot; (1953) by Barraqué, the mixed pieces &quot;Toute la lyre&quot; (1951) and &quot;Orphée 53&quot; (1953) by Schaeffer/Henry, and the film music &quot;Masquerage&quot; (1952) by Schaeffer and &quot;Astrologie&quot; (1953) by Henry. In 1954 Varèse and Honegger created &quot;Déserts&quot; and &quot;La rivière endormie&quot;&quot;. John Cage created his influential collage piece &quot;Williams Mix&quot; in 1952. More recently, George Rochberg used collage in &quot;Contra Mortem et Tempus&quot; and &quot;Symphony No. 3&quot;. In the 1980s Minóy made many palimpsest-like multi-tracked soundscape compositions that use sound collage.

==Micromontage==
Micromontage is the use of montage on the time scale of microsounds. Its primary proponent is composer Horacio Vaggione in works such as &quot;Octuor&quot; (1982), &quot;Thema&quot; (1985, Wergo 2026-2), and &quot;Schall&quot; (1995, Mnémosyne Musique Média LDC 278–1102). The technique may include the extraction and arrangement of sound particles from a sample or the creation and exact placement of each particle to create complex sound patterns or singular particles (transients). It may be accomplished through graphic editing, a script, or automated through a computer program. Granular synthesis incorporates many of the techniques of micromontage, though granular synthesis is inevitably automated while micromontage may be realized directly, point by point. &quot;It therefore demands unusual patience&quot; and may be compared to the pointillistic paintings of Georges Seurat.

== Popular music ==
&quot;Freak Out!&quot;, the 1966 debut album by the Mothers of Invention, made use of avant-garde sound collage, particularly the closing track &quot;The Return of the Son of Monster Magnet&quot;. The Beatles incorporated sound collage on their 1968 self-titled double album (also known as the &quot;White Album&quot;) with the track &quot;Revolution 9&quot;. &quot;Uncut&quot; wrote that &quot;Requia&quot; by John Fahey made use of meditative guitar soli with tape collage experimentation on &quot;Requiem for Molly&quot;.

<doc id="375713" wikidata="Q1619360" url="?curid=375713" title="La Catedral">
<text>La Catedral was a personal prison overlooking the city of Medellín, in Colombia. The prison was built to specifications ordered by Medellín Cartel leader Pablo Escobar, under a 1991 agreement with the Colombian government in which Escobar would surrender to authorities and serve a maximum term of five full years and the Colombian government would not extradite him to the United States. The prison now is administered as a monastery by Catholic monks of the Benedictine Order.

==Construction and occupation by Escobar==
In addition to the facility being built to Escobar&#x27;s specifications, Escobar was also given the right to choose who would guard him and it was believed he chose guards loyal only to him. Moreover, the prison was believed to have been designed more to keep out Escobar&#x27;s enemies and protect him from assassination attempts, than to keep Escobar inside.

The finished prison was often called &quot;Hotel Escobar&quot; or &quot;Club Medellín&quot; because of its amenities. La Catedral featured a football pitch, giant doll house, bar, jacuzzi and waterfall. Escobar also had a telescope installed that allowed him to look down onto the city of Medellín to his family&#x27;s residence while talking on the phone with them.

PBS reports that although the government was willing to turn a blind eye to Escobar continuing his drug smuggling, the arrangement fell apart when it was reported Escobar had four of his lieutenants tortured and murdered within La Catedral. The Colombian government decided it had to move Escobar to a standard prison, an order Escobar refused. July 1992, after serving one year and one month, Escobar again went on the run. With the Colombian National Army surrounding La Catedral&#x27;s facility, Escobar fled through an escape route that he had built into the facility during its construction. A section of the wall had been mortared with weak concrete that could be easily kicked open, allowing Escobar to walk out. The ensuing manhunt employed a 600-man unit force, specially trained by the United States Delta Force, named Search Bloc and led by Colonel Hugo Martínez.
== Location advantage ==
Fog comes over after six o&#x27;clock in the evening and returns at dawn, making air assault difficult. The location&#x27;s steep topography also prevented the military or rival cartels from attacking La Catedral easily. In addition, Pablo Escobar had a large magazine stocked with arms that ensured his safety in the prison.

== Present day ==
La Catedral remained deserted for several years. In 2007, a group of Benedictine monks from the Benedictina Fraternidad Monastica Santa Gertrudis arrived at the site and transformed it. They built a chapel, a library, a cafeteria, a guest-house for religious pilgrimages, workshops and a memorial to victims of the cartel in the prison. In addition, the monks hired laid-off people to help with the daily running of La Catedral. Considering their efforts of reconstructing the prison, the city Envigado then ceded the entire prison to these monks.

<doc id="375732" wikidata="Q732745" url="?curid=375732" title="Warminster">
<text>Warminster () is a historic market town and civil parish in south-west Wiltshire, England, on the western edge of Salisbury Plain. The parish had a population of 18,173 in 2021.

The name &quot;Warminster&quot; occurs first in the early 10th century and the Minster Church of St Denys was begun in the 11th century. The High Street and Market Place have many fine buildings including the Athenaeum Centre, the Town Hall, St Lawrence Chapel, The Old Bell and a variety of independent shops. Several Army establishments, known collectively as the Warminster Garrison, are on the edges of the town.

==Etymology==

The origin of the root &quot;Wor&quot; is &quot;wara&quot;, the genitive plural of the Old English noun &quot;waru&quot; meaning &quot;those that care for, watch, guard, protect, or defend.&quot; It was used as an endonym by both Goths and Jutes. Their specific ethnonym is unknown, though it likely was related to the native name of the oppidum at Battlesbury Camp during Sub-Roman times.

The town&#x27;s name has evolved over time; it was known as &quot;Worgemynstre&quot; in the early tenth century and was recorded as &quot;Guerminstre&quot; in the Domesday Book. The noun &quot;minster&quot; derives from Old English &quot;mynster&quot; meaning monastery, nunnery, mother church or cathedral, and was given to the town by Saxon settlers in the seventh century.

==History==

===Early history===

The main settlement at Warminster dates back to the Anglo-Saxon period, although there is evidence of pre-historic settlements in the area, especially at the nearby Iron Age hill forts: Battlesbury Camp, Scratchbury Camp and Cley Hill. Two Roman villas have been discovered in the area, as have caches of Roman coins.

By the 10th century, Warminster included a royal manor and an Anglo-Saxon minster, with the residents largely associated with the estate. The royal manor was passed to new lords in the 12th century, during which time the township started to grow. In the 13th century a market was set up at Warminster, and by 1377 the town had 304 poll-tax payers, the tenth largest in Wiltshire.

===Civil war===
During the Civil War, between 1642 and 1645, the town was the site of a few incidents. A major for the &quot;Roundheads&quot;, Henry Wansey, was besieged in Warminster, while a force under Edmund Ludlow entered a skirmish on Warminster Common when trying to relieve him. By 1646, the town had suffered £500 () worth of damages by supporting the Roundheads.

===Post-medieval prosperity===
The market at Warminster was the focus of the town&#x27;s prosperity, with significant wool, clothing and malting trades established by the 16th century and continuing to be the economic backbone of the town until the 19th century. The market also included a significant corn trade throughout the period and was regarded as the second largest corn market in the west of England in 1830. Unlike many markets of the time where farmers would take only samples to market, Warminster&#x27;s corn market required a sack from each load of corn to be available to customers; each purchase was to be agreed between 11am and 1pm and paid for by the end of the day.

The town had a large amount of accommodation for visitors to the market, and in 1686 it was ranked fourth for number of places to stay in Wiltshire, with 116 beds. By 1710 there were approximately fifty inns and alehouses in the town. The town was an early adopter of the Turnpikes Act to improve the roads around the town. Unlike many roads improved at the time which would link to towns, Warminster chose to improve seven roads around the town, all under long.

By the late 18th century some 200 dwellings had been built under squatter&#x27;s rights near Warminster Common, many of them substandard and overcrowded. William Daniell, a 19th-century Methodist minister, reported the reminiscences of a woman born there in the 1770s: unplastered hovels with earth floors, and piles of filth which poisoned the Cannimore Brook, bringing typhus and smallpox. The people were considered rude and drunk criminals. Daniell and members of the clergy were keen to help the residents, and by 1833 the area was considered clean and respectable.

===19th and 20th centuries===
The town centre was redesigned after 1807 when George Wansey, from a family of clothiers in Warminster, left £1,000 () to improve the town, provided his money could be matched by local fundraising. The amount raised was spent on demolishing houses to widen roads. In 1851, a railway line from Westbury was opened, and then in 1856 the line was continued to Salisbury. The railway had a devastating effect on the town&#x27;s market, which fell away almost to nothing; the shops and inns lost most of their business, and the local industries declined.
In 1907, a committee was put together to advertise the town, creating a town guide and advertising in national publications. The committee could not come to an agreement with Lord Bath over the location of a new hotel.

The headquarters and factory of luxury glovemakers Dents moved to the town in 1937, where it has remained since.

Between 1937 and 1965, a significant military presence formed at Warminster, with the addition of camps, a permanent barracks at Battlesbury, married quarters, a School of Infantry, and workshops for vehicle repairs.

==Religious sites==

=== Church of England ===
 St Denys&#x27;s Church is the town&#x27;s oldest, and is claimed to have had minster status, as there was a church here in the 10th century. Rebuilding was carried out in the 14th century, and in 1889 the church was mostly rebuilt, with a longer nave.

As the town&#x27;s population grew in the 19th century, two more churches were built: Christ Church in 1831 to serve the south of the town, and St John&#x27;s in 1865 in the southeast. All three churches are listed, St Denys&#x27; and St John&#x27;s churches are Grade II* and Christ Church is Grade II.

==== Town chapel ====
The chapel of St Lawrence, on the High Street near the market place, has been a chapel-of-ease to St Denys since at least 1290. Its tower is from the late 13th or early 14th century, but the rest was rebuilt in 1855–7. The people of the town bought the chapel in 1574, giving it the status of a non-royal peculiar outside the jurisdiction of the Church of England. Since then has been administered by feoffees (trustees) on behalf of the town, and they invite the vicar of St Denys&#x27; to hold services.

=== Others ===
Methodists built a chapel on George Street, west of the town centre, in 1804; it was rebuilt in 1861. The congregation amalgamated with the United Reformed Church in 1983 to form the United Church. A predecessor of the URC opened a chapel at Common Close in 1720, which by 1829 had a congregation of 900, leading to the chapel being rebuilt for a second time in 1839; notable ministers included Daniel Fisher (1752 to 1771) and Geoffrey Nuttall (1938 to 1943). Numbers fell in the 20th century, and after the 1983 amalgamation the chapel was demolished in 1987.

The Baptist chapel in North Row, off the High Street, was built in 1810 using red brick with stone dressings; by 1829 there were 250 in the congregation. Its interior was remodelled c.1850.

St Giles&#x27; Garrison Church, Imber Road, was built in 1968.

St George&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church, Boreham Road, in the Diocese of Clifton, was built in 1922 to designs of Bristol architect Sir Frank William Wills.

=== College and convent ===
James Erasmus Philipps, vicar of St Denys from 1859 to 1897, raised funds in 1860 to found a college for young men in a house on Church Street. It evolved into a missionary college called St Boniface Missionary College, and its building was greatly enlarged in 1901 and 1927. From 1948 until closure in 1969, as Warminster Theological College, it was a post-graduate facility of King&#x27;s College London. Today its buildings are part of Warminster School.

Philipps also led the foundation of an order of nuns, the Community of St Denys, in 1879. The nuns ran St Monica&#x27;s School for Girls, which merged with Lord Weymouth&#x27;s Grammar School in 1973 to form Warminster School. Since the retirement of the last nun in the early 21st century, the order operates as a grant-making charity.

== Notable buildings and structures ==

Warminster has one Grade I listed building: Portway House, to the north of the town centre, built for a wealthy clothier in 1722. The Bath stone house has a seven-bay front flanked by later extensions, and is set back from the road behind ornamental ironwork dated 1760.

Other Bath stone houses include 38–40 Market Place, late 18th century or early 19th, now shops at street level; and The Chantry, 34 High Street. Both are Grade II* listed.

Further Grade II* listed buildings include the churches of St Denys and St John; Byne House, Church Street, 1755; and Warminster School, 1708, endowed by Lord Weymouth, two storeys with attic, seven-bay front. Wren House, Vicarage Street, of 1720 or 1730, is described by Historic England as &quot;a fine example of an early Georgian 5-bay house&quot;. The Pound Street maltings, at what was the western edge of the town, are a rebuilding of 1879 in rubble stone with some ashlar. The Athenaeum Centre, designed by William Jervis Stent and built in 1857, is Wiltshire&#x27;s oldest working theatre and has been showing films since 1897.

At the triangular junction of Vicarage Street and Silver Street stands a tall stone obelisk, crowned with a reeded urn and pineapple, which was erected in 1873 on the site of an earlier high cross to commemorate the inclosure of the parish.

Warminster Town Hall, at the junction of the High Street and Weymouth Street, was designed c. 1837 by Edward Blore at the expense of the 5th Marquess of Bath; the two-storey front elevation is a replica of Longleat, with the addition of a central bellcote, clock and coat of arms. The building was sold by the district council in 1979.

==Governance==
Warminster falls within the parliamentary constituency of South West Wiltshire, which has been represented since 2001 by Andrew Murrison for the Conservatives.

There are two levels of local government: Wiltshire Council – the unitary authority for the county – and Warminster Town Council, which has 13 elected councillors.

Until 2009, when it was abolished, West Wiltshire District Council acted as the second tier of local government.

==Geography==
Warminster is in south-west Wiltshire, near to the Somerset border. The town is surrounded by six hills, providing shelter and security for early settlers. Warminster is also close to the former Selwood Forest.

A minor river known as The Were flows through the town to join the River Wylye on the south-east outskirts.

The former hamlets of Bugley (west of the town on the Frome road) and Boreham (east towards Bishopstrow) are now part of Warminster&#x27;s suburbs.

== Population ==
The Domesday survey of 1086 recorded 104 households, largely craftsmen for the royal demesne, but the population had grown by 1377 to 304 poll-tax payers, making Warminster the tenth largest village in Wiltshire. In 1665, the population had increased to 354 households, approximately 1,800 people. The area contained by the turnpike gates included 2,605 people in 1781.

==Economy==
As Warminster is in an area of fertile land, much of its early economy was through farming, especially cereals. William Daniell commented in 1879 that Warminster lay &#x27;in the midst of a fine corn-country&#x27;, and Warminster&#x27;s market provided the backbone of the economy through the 16th to 19th centuries. Alongside cereals, wool and clothing were traded and there were a number of maltings in the town.

Warminster&#x27;s clothing trade suffered greatly in the early 19th century, as there was no suitable river to power machinery during a period of industrialisation. At the same time its malting trade declined but remained important. In 1855, William Morgan commissioned the Pound Street Maltings, which Pevsner found to be derelict in 1974; today, malt is again produced there under new management.

The coming of the railway line from Westbury in 1851, continued to Salisbury in 1856, had a devastating effect on the town&#x27;s market, which fell away almost to nothing, and the shops and inns lost most of their business. In 1860, Warminster was described as &quot;a clean-swept, semi-aristocratic, decidedly poor place... in a lukewarm, stagnant, bankrupt state.&quot; However, by that year the town had begun to adopt new trades in brewing and iron-founding, which eventually grew enough to mitigate the loss of other business. One example was the Woodcock Ironworks, set up by John Wallis Titt in the town in the mid-1870s to make agricultural machines.

During the 20th century, Warminster&#x27;s economy became more dependent on the British Army and its associated service industries, but other new businesses also came into the area, such as intensive poultry farming, banana ripening, and shoe manufacture. During the late 20th century and early 21st century, the leisure industry has grown in the area, with Longleat and Center Parcs Longleat Forest becoming significant employers.

==Amenities==

Warminster has a library, museum, theatre, sports centre with pool, and a selection of independent shops and restaurants, as well as a thriving community, including a choral society called &#x27;The Athenaeum Singers&#x27;. Annual events in the area include an illuminated carnival, a vintage bus run and heritage open days.

The Athenaeum is an 1858 Grade II listed building and Wiltshire&#x27;s oldest working theatre venue. Originally a literary institution, with lectures, plays and concerts, and later a cinema and arts centre, it is now a theatre and centre for the community. Facilities at the Lakeside Pleasure Grounds (run by Warminster Town Council) include children&#x27;s play activities, tennis courts, a skate park, children&#x27;s splash pool and a boating lake leading to the Henford&#x27;s Marsh nature reserve; the park was opened by Thomas Thynne, 5th Marquess of Bath, in 1924 on the site of the town&#x27;s former rubbish tip. A children&#x27;s play area was added in 1938 with a grant from the national King George V memorial foundation.

About to the west is Longleat, the country house of the Marquess of Bath, and its estate which has included Longleat Safari Park since 1966; the first drive-through safari park outside Africa, it is home to over 500 animals, including giraffes, monkeys, rhinos, lions, tigers and wolves. The nearby Longleat Forest is also home to a Center Parcs holiday village.

== Media ==
The &quot;Warminster Journal&quot; is the local paid-for weekly newspaper. Published since 1881, it covers the surrounding villages as well as the town. The town is also within the area of the &quot;Wiltshire Times&quot;, another weekly newspaper.

Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC West and ITV West Country. Television signals are received from the Mendip and local relay transmitters.

BBC Radio Wiltshire is the BBC Local Radio public service station for the county. Warminster Community Radio (WCR) is the local community station broadcasting from the Civic Centre on 105.5 FM and online. Warminster is the centre of a small commercial radio licensing area, available on 107.5 FM. The licence was first held from 2001 by 3TR FM (Three Towns Radio; referring to Warminster, Westbury and Frome) but from 2008 went through several changes of ownership and station name. Since 2019 the station has been owned by Bauer Radio, and in September 2020 it was rebranded to Greatest Hits Radio which broadcasts national and regional music programmes.

==Military presence==
The British Army&#x27;s Waterloo Lines, formerly the Land Warfare Centre, is home to a number of Army specialist training schools and a sizeable portion of the Headquarters Field Army (not to be confused with Army HQ in Andover). The site is also home to Headquarters Small Arms School Corps and Headquarters Infantry, which was formed in 1996 and is responsible for the recruiting, manning and training policies of the Infantry. Harman Lines is a smaller installation nearby; in 2013, elements of the Royal Tank Regiment were here.

Battlesbury Barracks (near the ancient Battlesbury Camp) is the home of the Royal Dragoon Guards, an armoured cavalry regiment. Between 2005 and 2020, forces of the Yorkshire Regiment (latterly the 1st Battalion) were based here; the regiment&#x27;s 3rd Battalion was awarded the freedom of the town in 2012.

==Transport==
Warminster is at the junction of two primary routes, the A36 and the A350, which both now bypass the town to the south and east. There is a service area where the two roads meet. The A303 is about south of the town, and junctions 17 and 18 of the M4 are to the north.

Warminster railway station, which opened in 1851, is a stop on the Wessex Main Line. It is served by two train operating companies:
* Great Western Railway operates regular services to , , Southampton and ; London Paddington can be reached by changing at Westbury. GWR also manages the station.
* South Western Railway operates services between London Waterloo and , via Salisbury.

Warminster&#x27;s bus services are operated by First Bristol, Beeline Coaches and FromeBus. Routes connect the town with Bath, Frome and Salisbury. Berrys Coaches operates the &quot;Superfast 3&quot; route between Taunton and London.

==Sport==
Warminster has a long history of sporting activities, with many clubs established in the 19th century. Warminster Cricket Club was created in 1838. Its facilities at Sambourne Road have been shared with the local hockey team and the Warminster Table Tennis Club. The West Wilts Hockey Club has origins dating back to 1899 and as of 2016 has 13 adult teams. The architect John Henry Taylor designed the town&#x27;s Elm Hill golf course in 1891.

Warminster Town Football Club began around 1878 and the site at Weymouth Street was renovated and expanded in the 1990s; they play in Division One of the Western League. The town has a competitive swimming club, which began as part of Wiltshire County Amateur Swimming Association in 1907 and was re-established as Warminster and District Amateur Swimming Club in 1973. The Marquess of Bath is the President of Warminster Rugby Club which began in 1977 and in 1997 established its base at the West Wilts District Council owned Folly Lane multi-sports site.

More recent additions have been the Warminster Sports Centre run by Wiltshire Council, the Warminster Running Club, the Warminster Adventure Sports Club, and the Wessex Blades Fencing Club.

==Education==
Warminster has several primary schools and two secondary schools: Warminster School, an independent public school which was founded in 1707, and Kingdown School which became an academy in 2011. Nearby Bishopstrow College prepares international students for boarding school.

==Public services==
===Utilities===
Wessex Water supplies the town&#x27;s water and sewage services, with water hardness in the town centre reported as 250 mg/L. The distribution network operator for both electricity and gas is SSE plc.

===Healthcare===
The town has one GP partnership, the Avenue Surgery. The small Warminster Community Hospital has been run since 2016 by Wiltshire Health and Care LLP, who provide community services here and at five other small Wiltshire hospitals. The hospital has an inpatient ward. The nearest minor injuries unit is at Frome, and the nearest general hospitals with Accident and Emergency departments are Salisbury District Hospital and the Royal United Hospital in Bath. Ambulances are provided by the South Western Ambulance Service.

===Policing===
The town is within the area of Wiltshire Police, who have a station at The Avenue, in the centre of the town near the fire station. Until 2021 the police station was at Station Road, but the Police and Crime Commissioner described that building as &quot;not fit for purpose&quot;.
 As of June 2020, the Community Policing Team consists of:

*Neighbourhood Inspector (for Warminster, Westbury, Mere and Tisbury)
*Neighbourhood Sergeant (for the same area)
*One Police Constable (PC)
*One Special Constable (SC)
*Three Police Community Support Officers (PCSO)

The Ministry of Defence Police and Royal Military Police are occasionally to be seen passing through the town, as Warminster Garrison and the Salisbury Plain training area are policed jointly by all three police organisations.

===Fire Service===
Warminster has a fire station (The Portway, Warminster, BA12 8QE) and its retained firefighters are provided by Dorset &amp; Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service. They respond to emergencies when alerted by their pagers.

==Twin towns==
Warminster is twinned with:

* Warminster, Pennsylvania, United States

==UFO sightings==
Warminster was the location for a number of UFO sightings during the 1960s and 1970s. The first sighting was recorded on 25 December 1964 by Arthur Shuttlewood, who compiled a dossier of further sightings over the following year which he gave to the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; to publish. The newspaper story gained the town some notoriety for UFO sightings, leading to a BBC documentary in 1966, several books on the sightings, a 2009 conference on UFOs, and a 2010 conference with UFO expert Nick Pope.

<text>Vimy House was a warehouse in the Centretown West neighbourhood of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada that was used to store the collections of the Canadian War Museum from 1983 to 2004. The building, originally known as Champagne Garage was built to house the streetcars of the Ottawa Electric Railway. After the railway&#x27;s closure in 1959, the Ottawa Transportation Commission (and later the Ottawa-Carleton Regional Transit Commission) used the warehouse for storing their buses up until 1979. The building was later acquired by the Canadian War Museum to be used as a storage facility for its collections when its Sussex Drive facility ran out of space. The building, later renamed Vimy House, became filled with a vast array of aged military paraphernalia including the world&#x27;s largest collection of Canadian war art. While items from the Vimy House collection would occasionally be put on display at the museum itself, the public could also visit Vimy House on special open house days and tour its collection. The last open house was held on September 6, 2003.

In 2004, the collections at Vimy House were moved into the new Canadian War Museum building at LeBreton Flats. The building was sold and renovated and is now a self storage facility.

<doc id="375734" wikidata="Q1148495" url="?curid=375734" title="Ice climbing">
<text>Ice climbing is a climbing discipline that involves ascending routes consisting entirely of frozen water. To ascend, the ice climber uses specialist equipment, particularly double ice axes (or the more modern ice tools) and rigid crampons. To protect the route, the ice climber uses steel ice screws that require skill to employ safely and rely on the ice holding firm in any fall. Ice climbing routes can vary significantly by type, and include seasonally frozen waterfalls, high permanently frozen alpine couloirs, and large hanging icicles.

From the 1970s, ice climbing developed as a standalone skill from alpine climbing (where ice climbing skills are used on ice and snow). Ice climbing grades peak at WI6 to WI7 as ice tends to hang vertically at its most severe. WI7 is very rare and usually attributed to overhanging ice with serious risk issues (i.e. unstable ice, little protection, and a risk of death). Mixed climbing has pushed the technical difficulty of ice climbing routes by crossing bare rock overhangs and roofs (using ice tools on bare rock is called dry-tooling).

Since 2002, the UIAA have regulated competition ice climbing, which is offered in a lead climbing format on an artificial bolted wall that employs dry-tooling techniques (e.g. stein pulls and figure-four moves), and in a speed climbing format that uses a standardized wall of real ice. Since 2010, ice climbers at Helmcken Falls in Canada have been able to use the unique characteristics of the waterfall to create new severely overhanging bolted ice climbing routes, that are graded up to WI13, and are the hardest technical ice climbs in the world.

== Description==

Ice climbing involves using specific pieces of specialized equipment, namely ice tools and crampons, to ascend routes consisting of frozen water ice, and/or frozen snow fields.

As with rock climbing, ice climbing can be done as free climbing, and performed in pairs where the lead climber inserts climbing protection into the route as they ascend. The second climber (or belayer), removes this temporary climbing protection as they climb the route after the lead climber has reached the top. In contrast to free rock climbing, the climbing protection used when leading ice climbing routes is based on the use of specialized steel ice screws. Ice screws require considerable experience to use properly and safely, and given that the underlying condition of the ice can change materially over time (including constantly breaking off), the seriousness of leading an ice climbing route is considered to be greater than that of a traditional rock climbing route. For example, while an intermediate ice climber could top rope a WI4-graded ice climbing route, leading WI4-graded route is a far more serious undertaking. In contrast to rock climbing, &quot;the leader must not fall&quot; ethos is a core part of ice climbing.

Ice climbing can also be done as free solo climbing, which is an even riskier undertaking, or done as top roping which is a much safer form of ice climbing and the format used for novices being introduced to the sport.

Ice climbing was developed as part of the broader climbing discipline of alpine climbing, where it is still a key component of the alpinist&#x27;s skill set. Where the ice climbing route does not fully consist of ice and has elements of bare rock, it is known as mixed climbing. Where the route has no ice whatsoever, but the climber still uses the ice tools and crampons, it is known as dry-tooling. Because mixed climbing and dry-tooling routes can be fully bolted like sport climbing routes are in rock climbing (i.e because there is bare rock into which bolts can be drilled), they have become popular as safer alternatives to traditional ice climbing routes.

===Types of routes===

Ice climbing can take on a broad range of climbing routes. A common type of ice route is a frozen waterfall, particularly one that cascades down a mountain face or a down-mountain gully. Ice climbing routes can also take the form of high alpine snow-covered couloirs that are permanently frozen year-round. Giant icicles (also known as ice-daggers) have also been climbed as ice routes, and also as part of mixed routes; although such icicles can often dangerously break off and have been a source of several ice climber fatalities.

Ice climbing routes normally don&#x27;t move beyond the sheer vertical for sustained distances due to the nature of ice (i.e. ice rarely stays in an overhanging fashion for any length of time). This means that standard ice-climbing grades broadly peak at WI6-7 (i.e. WI7 being completely sheer vertical ice and with additional risk issues). In contrast, extreme mixed-climbing routes have been developed beyond the equivalent M7-grade as they can incorporate routes that cross overhanging bare rock roofs to get to the vertical hanging icicle such as Jeff Lowe&#x27;s groundbreaking &quot;Octopussy&quot; WI6 M8 in Vail, Colorado.

In Helmcken Falls in Canada, an unusual situation arises where a perennially active waterfall keeps severely overhanging rock faces covered in thick ice, thus creating overhanging ice routes. Ice climbers have established bolted routes (there is enough rock for the bolts) that are graded above WI7 (currently at WI13, as at 2023) in Helmcken.

==History==
For decades, ice and mixed climbing were part of the alpine climbing skill set. During the 1960s, ambitious early ice climbers began to use pitons to climb harder ice routes but this was dangerous and very unstable. The breakthrough came in the 1960s when Yvon Chouinard designed a new wooden-handled ice axe with a curved serrated pick called the &quot;Climax&quot;. This was followed in 1970, when Hamish MacInnes designed the all-metal aluminum alloy ice axe that had a radically dropped pick called the &quot;Terrordactyl&quot; (or Terror). These two ice axes revolutionized ice climbing and eventually became merged into the modern all-metal ice axe (later the ice tool) with its dropped pick but curved and serrated tip (the now familiar &quot;banana shape&quot;).

Chouinard and McInnes&#x27; ice axes would lead to an explosion of interest in climbing on frozen waterfalls in the North American Rockies and in the European Alps. Ice climber and climbing author Raphael Slawinski wrote in the &quot;American Alpine Journal&quot;: &quot;By the early 1980s ice climbing, from being merely one of the techniques in the alpinist&#x27;s arsenal, had evolved into a full-blown technical art. The skills gained on waterfalls also gave rise to a whole new generation of alpine climbs. &quot;Slipstream&quot; (WI4+, 1979) in the Canadian Rockies blurred the distinction between waterfall ice and alpine climbing; the &quot;Moonflower Buttress&quot; (WI6 M7 A2, 1983) in the Alaska Range applied the highest levels of ice climbing skill to a major alpine first ascent; and the list goes on. Waterfall ice climbing, though initially pursued for its own sake, ended up revolutionizing alpine climbing&quot;.

By the end of the 1980s, ice climbers had effectively reached the limits of what could be climbed at grade WI6-7; ultimately, the inherent tendency of the medium to hang in a vertical fashion limited the possibilities for development. It was mixed climbing that began to drive development in ice climbing as pioneers like Jeff Lowe dry-tooled bare rock overhangs and roofs to get to more radical ice features, such as hanging icicles; the culmination of which was Lowe&#x27;s historic ascent of &quot;Octopussy&quot; (WI6, M8) in Vail in 1994, which lead to the birth of modern mixed climbing.

It would not be until 2010 when Tim Emmett and Will Gadd began to put up ice routes at Helmcken Falls in Canada that ice climbing development would take a leap forward in technical development. Helmcken Fall&#x27;s unique characteristics provided severely overhanging iced-routes, and in the next decade, grades were proposed up to WI13 with &quot;Mission to Mars&quot; in 2020. Emmett and Gadd consider Helmcken to be a potential Yosemite of ice climbing.

== Competition ice climbing ==

The International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation (UIAA) has organized and regulated the sport of competition ice climbing since 2002 when the very first &quot;Ice World Cup&quot; (IWC) competition took place under the new UIAA rules and codes.

Amongst others, the UIAA runs two main competition ice climbing events, the annual Ice Climbing World Cup (which is run as a series of events in the year) and the bi-annual Ice Climbing World Championships (a single, once-off, competition).

Most of the IWC lead climbing routes are held on bolted dry artificial surfaces and thus employ dry-tooling techniques (e.g. stein pulls and figure-four moves). In contrast, the IWC speed-climbing routes are on a standardized wall of ice that takes seconds for top roped ice climbers to complete (as per speed rock climbing).

Over the years, the UIAA has increased the regulation and use around competition ice climbing equipment, including the prohibition of leashes on ice tools (so they cannot be used as aid), and increased controls on the use of &quot;heel spurs&quot; while climbing (to counter their use for resting).

== Equipment==
Ice climbing uses items of equipment that are common in rock climbing such as ropes, harnesses and helmets, as well as mechanical devices such as belay devices. However, the nature of the medium means that ice climbers also use equipment that is specific to their type of climbing.

===For climbing===
*Ice axes or the more modern ice tools: Modern ice climbing requires double ice axes (or ergo ice tools); a key decision is whether it uses a leash or not. Competition ice climbing has prohibited leashes (as they can be used for aid), and most extreme mixed climbing tends not to use leashes. However, the lack of a leash means that the shock of any sudden &quot;blowout&quot; of the feet, can lead to an immediate fall.
*Crampons: Ice climbers often use mono-point crampons instead of the more typical dual-point crampons used by alpine climbers, to maintain greater control and cutting accuracy. Some favor the front points to be &quot;vertical&quot; (i.e. like a mini-ice tool), which increases cutting power but is less stable and can &quot;blowout&quot; without warning; others use the traditional &quot;horizontal&quot; (i.e. flat like an adze) front points.
*Ice boots. Ice climbers can use the &quot;shell&quot; or &quot;plastic&quot; rigid mountaineering boots used by alpine climbers, to which crampons are attached. Advanced mixed climbers, and competition ice climbers, use &quot;fruit boots&quot;, which are light boots with crampons integrated into the sole. In addition, fruit boots can add &quot;heel spurs&quot;, which are used in mixed climbing for overhangs.

===For protection===

Where ice climbing is done as lead climbing (i.e. not top roping), the key tool for protection is the ice screw, a hollow metal threaded steel tube with cutting teeth on its base and a hanger eye on the opposite end. It is screwed into the ice and its stability is dependent both on the angle and quality of its placement and the soundness of the ice. Some ice climbs, such as in Helmcken Falls (see below), and mixed and dry-tooling routes, have enough rock to enable them to be bolted like sport climbs, avoiding the need for screws.

As well as ice screws, the ice itself can be used for protection, with the most common technique being the Abalakov thread (or V-thread/A-thread). This consists of two intersecting tunnels bored into the ice using ice screws that form a V-shaped tunnel. A sling is threaded through this tunnel and tied into a loop. The climbing rope is passed through this sling, which remains left behind after use. Because of the difficulty in construction, the common use of V-threads is as anchor points for abseiling or belaying, and not for lead climbing.

==Technique==
The core techniques that are used in ice climbing are considered to be straightforward for even a novice to understand, however, it takes experience and skill to apply them efficiently and safely. This is particularly relevant on very steep ice (i.e. at or above the grade of WI4) where inefficient technique will quickly drain the climber&#x27;s energy, resulting in a potential break of the &quot;golden rule of ice climbing&quot;, which is &quot;don&#x27;t fall&quot;.

===Front-pointing===

Modern ice climbing is built around the technique of front pointing, which means kicking the front spike(s) of the climber&#x27;s crampon into the ice to enable the climber to ascend the face. A critical part of front-pointing is ensuring that the heels are neither elevated — as often required in rock climbing — or held too low; both scenarios which can result in the front teeth of the crampon shearing off from the ice and the climber losing their foothold(s).

===Squat-stand-swing===

In moving upwards, ice climbers start from a balanced position with both feet exactly level, shoulder-width apart, and front-pointed into the ice, with the knees slightly bent forward and touching the ice.

The ice axes (or ice tools) are rarely held at the same level — which can result in a very inefficient and energy-sapping &quot;chicken wing&quot; action — and thus there will usually be a higher axe placed at close to maximum extension above the climber and a second one placed below it (see photo opposite).

Once the higher axe has been secured into the ice, the climber — resting their weight on the higher axe — will bring their feet up into a &quot;squat position&quot; until they are again level. Once the feet are secured and front-pointed into the ice, the climber will stand up straight and will start to swing with the other axe to reach the next position of maximum extension above their body. The technique has been described as &quot;squat-stand-swing&quot;.

== Grading ==

===WI-grades===
Ice climbing uses a WI (for &quot;water ice&quot;) grading system. WI-grades broadly equate to the mixed climbing M-grades from WI1 up to WI6, but after M6, mixed climbs become overhanging, which ice does not. WI-grades try to take some account of the difficulty of placing protection on the route but, as with M-grades, are more focused on the technical and physical challenge of the route, and are thus more akin to the French and US sport climbing grades, although as with the US system, the &quot;R/X&quot; suffix is used for danger.

The WI-grade is for &quot;hard ice&quot;; steep snow slopes, which are encountered frequently on alpine climbing routes, are not explicitly graded but instead, their steepest angle (approximate figure or a range) is quoted (e.g. 60–70 degree slope). WI-grade is for &quot;seasonal&quot; hard ice; an AI prefix is used instead for &quot;alpine ice&quot;, which is year-round and usually firmer, more stable, making AI-grade routes slightly easier than WI routes.

In Canada, the WI prefix is sometimes dropped from the grade, and for longer multi-pitch ice routes, a &quot;commitment grade&quot; (a Roman numeral from I to VII) is also added to reflect the seriousness of the overall undertaking (e.g. the grade of a Canadian ice route can appear as III-5)

The following WI-grades and descriptions are provided by the American Alpine Club (republished in 2013) who note: &quot;Ice climbing ratings are highly variable by region and are still evolving. ... The following descriptions approximate the average systems:&quot;: Additional comment is from Will Gadd.

*WI1: &quot;Low angle, no ice tools are required&quot;. Like scrambling with 10-point crampons up a frozen river, does not require double ice axes or front-pointing skills.
*WI2: &quot;Consistent 60º ice with possible bulges; good protection&quot;. Beginner routes can, if needed, be climbed with one ice axe; Will Gadd notes that WI2 has &quot;more accidents than any other grade&quot;.
*WI3: &quot;Sustained 70º with possible long bulges of 80º–90º; reasonable rests and good stances for placing screws&quot;. Will Gadd calls it &quot;proper technical ice climbing needing a rope and double ice axes&quot;.
*WI4: &quot;Continuous 80º ice fairly long sections of 90º ice broken up by occasional rests&quot;. According to Gadd, &quot;Strong novices can top rope WI4, but leading WI4 is serious&quot;.
*WI5: &quot;Long and strenuous, with a rope length of 85º–90º ice offering few good rests; or a shorter pitch of thin or bad ice with protection that’s difficult to place&quot;.
*WI6: &quot;A full rope length of near-90º ice with no rests, or a shorter pitch more tenuous than WI5. Highly technical&quot;. According to Gadd, &quot;the best climbers will find an occasional reason to retreat at WI6&quot;.
*WI7: &quot;As per [WI6] above, but on thin poorly bonded ice or long, overhanging poorly adhered columns. Protection is impossible or very difficult to place and of dubious quality&quot;. Gadd calls WI7, &quot;Semi-mythical&quot;, and &quot;with a high publicity co-efficient, that often becomes a WI6 on repeat&quot;. In 2023, &quot;Climbing&quot; magazine wrote that leading Canadian ice climbers such as Quentin Roberts and Marc-André Leclerc had publicly stated that pure WI7 grades could not exist in nature.
*WI8: &quot;Under discussion&quot;. According to Gadd, &quot;only claimed a few times&quot;, and &quot;either bad gear and bad ice&quot;, or &quot;an overhanging glacial serac that is like an M8 in physicality&quot;.

===Helmcken routes===

In 2010, ice climbers Tim Emmett and Will Gadd began to put up ice routes at Helmcken Falls in Canada that had unique characteristics. Unlike WI7 ice routes that rarely overhang, these routes were significantly overhanging like extreme M-graded routes. This was due to the intense spray from the active waterfall, which covered the overhanging routes in ice so that there was little dry-tooling, with all the movements on hard ice.

As the routes were bolted like M-grade climbs (a metal detector is used to find the bolts), Emmett and Gadd re-established the link with M-grades as a guide on the WI-grade. The result was a series of new routes that laid claim to being the new &quot;world&#x27;s technically hardest ice climbing routes&quot;, starting with &quot;Spray On&quot; at WI10 in 2010, &quot;Wolverine&quot; at WI11 in 2011, &quot;Interstellar Spice&quot; at WI12 in 2016, and &quot;Mission to Mars&quot; at WI13 in 2020.

There has been debate in the ice climbing world around whether Helmcken-WI routes are M-grade climbs. In 2023, British ice climber Neil Gresham said that Helmcken routes are &quot;definitely harder&quot; than WI7 routes and that a confident M-climber will take time to adjust to the Helmcken WI-equivalent.

Emmett has described Helmcken as the ice climbing equivalent of Yosemite, and it has attracted some of the world&#x27;s best ice climbers.

===M-grades===
When ice climbing is done as mixed climbing (i.e. there are both ice and bare rock sections), a separate M-grading grading system is used, which goes from M1, M2, M3, ... , M13, M14, etc.

===D-grades===

When ice climbing is done as dry-tooling, which is ice climbing on bare rock, the M-grade is replaced by a &quot;D&quot; prefix to denote a pure &#x27;dry-tooling&#x27; route, however, the systems are otherwise identical.

==Evolution of grade milestones==
The following ice climbs are particularly notable in the evolution of ice climbing grade milestones and ice climbing standards from being a skill used by alpine climbing to a standalone sport in its own right:

* 1979. &quot;Slipstream&quot; WI4+ Canadian Rockies. First ascent was in 1979 by Jim Elzinga and John Lauchlan; considered an important early example of the blurring between alpine climbing and pure ice climbing and the first major alpine, serac waterfall route in the Rockies.
* 1983. &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot; WI6 Canadian Rockies. First ascent was in 1983 by Kevin Doyle and Tim Friesen; considered an early WI7 contender in ice climbing, and the hardest ice route at the time; grade since softened to WI6.
* 1987. &quot;Riptide&quot; WI6-7 Canadian Rockies. First ascent was in 1987 by Larry Ostrander and Jeff Marshall; considered an early WI7 contender in ice climbing, and the hardest ice route at the time; grade since softened to WI6+.
* 1988. &quot;Reality Bath&quot; WI7 X Canadian Rockies. First ascent was in 1988 by Mark Twight and Randy Rackliff; never been repeated and described by Albi Sole in the &quot;Canadian Rockies&quot; guide book as &quot;so dangerous as to be of little value except to those suicidally inclined&quot;; possibly first-ever WI7.
* 1989. &quot;Repentance Super&quot; WI5-6 Val di Cogne, Italy. First ascent was in 1989 by a non-local team of , , and Fulvio Conta; considered the hardest ice climb in Europe at the time and a breakthrough in standards; mostly bolted now and grade softened.
* 2002. &quot;Rites of Passage&quot; WI7+ Mount Kitchener, Canadian Rockies. First ascent was in 2002 by Eric Dumerac and Philippe Pellet; initially graded WI8, but considered one of the few routes that are truly above WI7 (pre-Helmcken Falls), and the hardest route in the world at the time.
* 2010. &quot;Centrecourt&quot; WI7+ Gasteinertal, Austria. First ascent was in 2010 by Albert Leichtfried and Benedikt Purner; considered one of the hardest routes in the world at the time and another of the few ice climbing routes at WI7+.

The grade milestones at Helmcken Falls are as follows:

*2010. &quot;Spray On&quot; WI10. First ascent by Tim Emmett and Will Gadd at Helmcken Falls; first-ever WI10 in ice climbing; bolted.

*2011. &quot;Wolverine&quot; WI11. First ascent by Tim Emmett and Klemen Premrl at Helmcken Falls; first-ever WI11 in ice climbing; bolted.
*2016. &quot;Interstellar Spice&quot; WI12. First ascent by Tim Emmett and Klemen Premrl at Helmcken Falls; first-ever WI12 in ice climbing; bolted.
*2020. &quot;Mission to Mars&quot; WI13. First ascent by Tim Emmett and Klemen Premrl at Helmcken Falls; first-ever WI13 in ice climbing; bolted.

===Free solo===

A number of ice climbers have set new grade milestones in a free solo climbing style (i.e. no protection such as ice screws):

* 1997. &quot;Sea of Vapours&quot; WI6+ Canadian Rockies. Free solo in 1997 by . &quot;Sea of Vapours&quot; was considered WI7+ at the time.
* 2017. &quot;Beta Block Super&quot; WI7 Breitwangfluh, Switzerland. Free solo in 2017 by Dani Arnold.

==In film==
A number of notable climbing films have been made that feature ice climbing, including:
* &quot;The Alpinist&quot;, a 2021 documentary film about the late Canadian alpinist Marc-André Leclerc, featuring his free solo ascent of several ice routes
* &quot;Touching the Void&quot;, a 2003 docudrama about a famous alpine climbing rescue in the Peruvian Andes

<text>Cannock () is a town in the Cannock Chase district in the county of Staffordshire, England. It had a population of 29,018. Cannock is not far from the towns of Walsall, Burntwood, Stafford and Telford. The cities of Lichfield and Wolverhampton are also nearby.

Cannock lies to the north of the West Midlands conurbation on the M6, A34 and A5 roads and to the south of Hednesford and the Cannock Chase Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Cannock is served by a railway station on the Chase Line. The town comprises four district council electoral wards and the Cannock South ward includes the civil parish of Bridgtown, but the rest of Cannock is unparished.

==History==
Cannock was in the Domesday Book of 1086. It was called Chnoc c.1130, Cnot in 1156, Canot in 1157, and Canoc in 1198. Cannock is probably Old English cnocc meaning &#x27;hillock&#x27;, modified by Norman pronunciation by the insertion of a vowel to Canoc. The name may refer to Shoal Hill, north-west of the town.

Cannock was a small rural community until mining increased heavily during the mid-to-late 19th century. The area then continued to grow rapidly with many industries coming to the area because of its proximity to the Black Country and its coal reserves. Cannock&#x27;s population continued to increase steadily in the 20th century and its slight fall since the 1981 census has been more than compensated for by house-building in the adjoining village of Heath Hayes. The last colliery to close in the town was Mid Cannock in 1967, and the last remaining colliery to close in the Cannock Chase area was Littleton (in Huntington) in 1993.

The total population of the built-up area defined in 2011 was 86,121, making it the second largest in Staffordshire if Swadlincote in Derbyshire is excluded from the Burton upon Trent Built-up Area (BUA). There is some green belt, particularly between the Cannock BUA and the much larger West Midlands BUA to the south. As well as the Lichfield, Stafford, East Staffordshire, and South Staffordshire Districts.

A house known as The Green, which dated from the 1730s and which was the home of Sir Robert Fisher, 4th Baronet, became the headquarters of Cannock Urban District Council in 1927. It was converted into offices in the 1980s, initially for Cannock Chase Technical College but, in 2016, it was refurbished for private use.

Cannock Chase German war cemetery is located nearby containing 4,885 German military dead from the First and Second World Wars. It is managed by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.

==Geography==
Cannock is on a south-west facing slope, falling from the highest point on Cannock Chase (244 m) at Castle Ring, to about 148 m in the town centre and 111 m near Wedges Mills. The soil is light with a gravel and clay subsoil, and there are extensive coal measures.

===Climate===
Cannock has a moderate, temperate climate. See Penkridge weather station for details of average temperature and rainfall figures taken between 1981 and 2010 at the Met Office weather station in Penkridge (around 5 miles (8 km) north-west of Cannock).

Cannock railway station closed in 1965 as part of the Beeching cuts but reopened in 1989. It is part of the Rugeley – Cannock – Walsall – Birmingham line operated by West Midlands Trains. Over the years, usage of this station, and the line overall, have increased to unprecedented levels. Services initially were hourly services between Birmingham New Street and Stafford (cut back to Rugeley Trent Valley in 2008). By 2013, usage had become significant enough to warrant electrification of the railway line, which was completed in 2019.

The Rugeley - Hednesford - Cannock - Walsall - Birmingham line operated by West Midlands Trains serves the three railway stations in the conurbation. These are at Hednesford, Cannock, and Landywood. There was also a service to Stafford on the Chase Line but this was cut back to Rugeley due to congestion on the West Coast Main Line.

In May 2019, West Midlands Trains began operating electric trains from this station. The vast majority of services are to Rugeley Trent Valley in the north, southbound trains operate to Birmingham International and London Euston. The journey time to Birmingham is around 36 minutes. On Sundays, trains operate as far south as Coventry.

===Bus===
D&amp;G Bus operate the majority of bus services around Cannock from a depot at Delta Way under the Chaserider brand.

Arriva Midlands were previously the main operator around Cannock but their operations based at their Cannock depot were sold to D&amp;G Bus during 2020.

Select Bus Services also operate a small number of services while National Express West Midlands service X51 links Cannock with Birmingham via Walsall and Great Wyrley.

No Chaserider buses operate on Sunday or bank holiday, however National Express service X51 does with funding from the McArthurGlen Designer outlet which the bus serves.

Cannock Bus Station also has links to Hednesford, Rugeley, Stafford, Lichfield, Wolverhampton, Walsall, Brownhills in addition to smaller towns and villages like Great Wyrley, Chadsmoor and Norton Canes.

<text>Environmental protection, or environment protection, refers to the taking of measures to protecting the natural environment, prevent pollution and maintain ecological balance. Action may be taken by individuals, advocacy groups and governments. Objectives include the conservation of the existing natural environment and natural resources and, when possible, repair of damage and reversal of harmful trends.

Due to the pressures of overconsumption, population growth and technology, the biophysical environment is being degraded, sometimes permanently. This has been recognized, and governments have begun placing restraints on activities that cause environmental degradation. Since the 1960s, environmental movements have created more awareness of the multiple environmental problems. There is disagreement on the extent of the environmental impact of human activity, so protection measures are occasionally debated.

== Approaches ==

===Voluntary agreements===
In industrial countries, voluntary environmental agreements often provide a platform for companies to be recognized for moving beyond the minimum regulatory standards and thus support the development of the best environmental practice. For instance, in India, Environment Improvement Trust (EIT) has been working for environmental and forest protection since 1998. In developing countries, such as Latin America, these agreements are more commonly used to remedy significant levels of non-compliance with mandatory regulation.

===Ecosystems approach===
An ecosystems approach to resource management and environmental protection aims to consider the complex interrelationships of an entire ecosystem in decision-making rather than simply responding to specific issues and challenges. Ideally, the decision-making processes under such an approach would be a collaborative approach to planning and decision-making that involves a broad range of stakeholders across all relevant governmental departments, as well as industry representatives, environmental groups, and community. This approach ideally supports a better exchange of information, development of conflict-resolution strategies and improved regional conservation. Religions also play an important role in the conservation of the environment: for example, the Catholic Church&#x27;s &quot;Compendium&quot; on its social teaching states that &quot;environmental protection cannot be assured solely on the basis of financial calculations of costs and benefits. The environment is one of those goods that cannot be adequately safeguarded or promoted by market forces.&quot;

Underrepresented Environmental Justice Movements：

Expand on environmental justice claims outside North America and Europe. 

Environmental justice movements and environmental preservation initiatives frequently collide, especially in areas where underprivileged groups suffer disproportionate environmental harm. Grassroots movements have arisen in the Global South to protest widespread pollution, land dispossession, and resource extraction. Stricter environmental laws and increased involvement in decision-making have been demanded by indigenous groups. 

Expanding the Global Perspective：

The Environmental Protection page focuses largely on policies in developed countries. You could add information on environmental protections in the Global South, including legal battles over land rights and pollution in countries like India, the Philippines, or Brazil.

Global environmental justice movements are still motivated by his legacy. These incidents demonstrate the crucial role that frontline communities play in protecting the environment, frequently at considerable personal danger. Even though there are legislative frameworks to address environmental inequalities, enforcement is still lacking, particularly in cases when governmental and corporate interests coincide. Stronger environmental regulations and the rights of impacted communities are now largely dependent on increased global awareness and solidarity.

===International agreements===

Many of the earth&#x27;s resources are especially vulnerable because they are influenced by human impacts across different countries. As a result of this, many attempts are made by countries to develop agreements that are signed by multiple governments to prevent damage or manage the impacts of human activity on natural resources. This can include agreements that impact factors such as climate, oceans, rivers and air pollution. These international environmental agreements are sometimes legally binding documents that have legal implications when they are not followed and, at other times, are more agreements in principle or are for use as codes of conduct. These agreements have a long history with some multinational agreements being in place from as early as 1910 in Europe, America and Africa.

Many of the international technical agencies formed after 1945 addressed environmental themes. By the late 1960s, a growing environmental movement called for coordinated and institutionalized international cooperation. The landmark United Nations Conference on the Human Environment was held in Stockholm in 1972, establishing the concept of a right to a healthy environment. It was followed by the creation of the United Nations Environment Programme later that year. Some of the most well-known international agreements include the Kyoto Protocol of 1997 and the Paris Agreement of 2015.

On 8 October 2021, the UN Human Rights Council passed a resolution recognizing access to a healthy and sustainable environment as a universal right. In the resolution 48/13, the Council called on States around the world to work together, and with other partners, to implement the newly recognized right.

On 28 July 2022, the United Nations General Assembly voted to declare the ability to live in &quot;a clean, healthy and sustainable environment&quot; a universal human right.

==Government==

Discussion concerning environmental protection often focuses on the role of government, legislation, and law enforcement. However, in its broadest sense, environmental protection may be seen to be the responsibility of all the people and not simply that of government. Decisions that impact the environment will ideally involve a broad range of stakeholders including industry, indigenous groups, environmental group and community representatives. Gradually, environmental decision-making processes are evolving to reflect this broad base of stakeholders and are becoming more collaborative in many countries.

===Africa===
====Tanzania====
Many constitutions acknowledge Tanzania as having some of the greatest biodiversity of any African country. Almost 40% of the land has been established into a network of protected areas, including several national parks. The concerns for the natural environment include damage to ecosystems and loss of habitat resulting from population growth, expansion of subsistence agriculture, pollution, timber extraction and significant use of timber as fuel.

Environmental protection in Tanzania began during the German occupation of East Africa (1884–1919)—colonial conservation laws for the protection of game and forests were enacted, whereby restrictions were placed upon traditional indigenous activities such as hunting, firewood collecting, and cattle grazing. In 1948, Serengeti has officially established the first national park for wild cats in East Africa. Since 1983, there has been a more broad-reaching effort to manage environmental issues at a national level, through the establishment of the National Environment Management Council (NEMC) and the development of an environmental act.

Division of the biosphere is the main government body that oversees protection. It does this through the formulation of policy, coordinating and monitoring environmental issues, environmental planning and policy-oriented environmental research. The National Environment Management Council (NEMC) is an institution that was initiated when the National Environment Management Act was first introduced in year 1983. This council has the role to advise governments and the international community on a range of environmental issues. The NEMC the following purposes: provide technical advice; coordinate technical activities; develop enforcement guidelines and procedures; assess, monitor and evaluate activities that impact the environment; promote and assist environmental information and communication; and seek advancement of scientific knowledge.

The National Environment Policy of 1997 acts as a framework for environmental decision making in Tanzania. The policy objectives are to achieve the following:
* Ensure sustainable and equitable use of resources without degrading the environment or risking health or safety.
* Prevent and control degradation of land, water, vegetation and air.
* Conserve and enhance natural and man-made heritage, including biological diversity of unique ecosystems.
* Improve condition and productivity of degraded areas.
* Raise awareness and understanding of the link between environment and development.
* Promote individual and community participation.
* Promote international cooperation.
* Use ecofriendly resources.

Tanzania is a signatory to a significant number of international conventions including the Rio Declaration on Development and Environment 1992 and the Convention on Biological Diversity 1996. The Environmental Management Act, 2004, is the first comprehensive legal and institutional framework to guide environmental-management decisions. The policy tools that are parts of the act include the use of environmental-impact assessments, strategics environmental assessments, and taxation on pollution for specific industries and products. The effectiveness of shifting of this act will only become clear over time as concerns regarding its implementation become apparent based on the fact that, historically, there has been a lack of capacity to enforce environmental laws and a lack of working tools to bring environmental-protection objectives into practice.

===Asia===
====China====

Formal environmental protection in China House was first stimulated by the 1972 United Nations Conference on the Human Environment held in Stockholm, Sweden. Following this, they began establishing environmental protection agencies and putting controls on some of its industrial waste. China was one of the first developing countries to implement a sustainable development strategy. In 1983 the State Council announced that environmental protection would be one of China&#x27;s basic national policies and in 1984 the National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA) was established. Following severe flooding of the Yangtze River basin in 1998, NEPA was upgraded to the State Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) meaning that environmental protection was now being implemented at a ministerial level. In 2008, SEPA became known by its current name of Ministry of Environmental Protection of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (MEP).

Environmental pollution and ecological degradation has resulted in economic losses for China. In 2005, economic losses (mainly from air pollution) were calculated at 7.7% of China&#x27;s GDP. This grew to 10.3% by 2002 and the economic loss from water pollution (6.1%) began to exceed that caused by air pollution. China has been one of the top performing countries in terms of GDP growth (9.64% in the past ten years). However, the high economic growth has put immense pressure on its environment and the environmental challenges that China faces are greater than most countries. In 2021 it was noted that China was the world&#x27;s largest greenhouse gas emitter, while also facing additional environmental challenges which included illegal logging, wildlife trafficking, plastic waste, ocean pollution, environmental-related mismanagement, unregulated fishing, and the consequences associated with being the world&#x27;s largest mercury polluter. All these factors contribute to climate change and habitat loss. In 2022 China was ranked 160th out of 180 countries on the Environmental Performance Index due to poor air quality and high GHG emissions.

Ecological and environmental degradation in China have health related impacts; for example, if current pollution levels continue, Chinese citizens will lose 3.6 billion total life years. Another issue is that non-transmittable diseases among Chinese, which cause at least 80% of 10.3 million annual deaths, are worsened by air pollution.

China has taken initiatives to increase its protection of the environment and combat environmental degradation:
* China&#x27;s investment in renewable energy grew 18% in 2007 to $15.6 billion, accounting for ~10% of the global investment in this area;
* In 2008, spending on the environment was 1.49% of GDP, up 3.4 times from 2000;
* The discharge of CO (carbon monoxide) and SO2 (sulfur dioxide) decreased by 6.61% and 8.95% in 2008 compared with that in 2005;
* China&#x27;s protected nature reserves have increased substantially. In 1978 there were only 34 compared with 2,538 in 2010. The protected nature reserve system now occupies 15.5% of the country; this is higher than the world average.

Rapid growth in GDP has been China&#x27;s main goal during the past three decades with a dominant development model of inefficient resource use and high pollution to achieve high GDP. For China to develop sustainably, environmental protection should be treated as an integral part of its economic policies.

Quote from Shengxian Zhou, head of MEP (2009): &quot;Good economic policy is good environmental policy and the nature of environmental problem is the economic structure, production form and develop model.&quot;

Since around 2010 China appears to be placing a greater emphasis on environmental and ecological protection. For example, former General Secretary Hu Jintao&#x27;s report at the 2012 Party Congress added a section focusing on party policy on ecological issues.

Xi Jinping&#x27;s report at the 19th CPC National Congress in 2017 noted recent progress in ecological and environmental conservation and restoration, the importance of ecologically sustainable development and global ecological security, and the need to provide ecological goods to meet people&#x27;s growing demands. Most importantly, Xi Jinping has suggested clearly identifiable methods to meet the ecological demands of the country. Some of the solutions he notes are the need for the development and facilitation of: ecological corridors, biodiversity protection networks, redlines for protecting ecosystems, market-based mechanisms for ecological compensation in addition to afforestation, greater crop rotation, recycling, waste reduction, stricter pollution standards, and greener production and technology. The report at the 19th CPC National Congress isn&#x27;t simply the personal thoughts from Xi Jinping, it&#x27;s a product of a long process of compromise and negotiation among competing party officials and leaders.

Additionally, the Third Plenum of the CCP in 2013 included a manifesto that placed extreme emphasis on reforming management of the environment, promising to create greater transparency of those polluting, and placing environmental criteria above GDP growth for local official evaluations.

Reform has not come cheap for China. In 2016, it was noted that in response to pollution and oversupply, China laid off around six million workers in state-owned enterprises and spent $23 billion to cover layoffs specifically for coal and steel companies between 2016 and 2019. While expensive, other benefits of environmental protection have been noticed beyond impacting citizens&#x27; health. For example, in the long run, environmental protection has been found to generally improve job quality of migrant workers by reducing their work intensity, while increasing social security and job quality.

Different local governments in China implement different approaches to solving the issue of ecological protection, sometimes with negative consequences for the citizens. For example, a prefecture in the Shanxi province imposed bans, and potential legal detentions or steep fines for violations, on coal-burning by villagers. Although the government provided free gas-heaters often the villagers were unable to afford to run them. In Wuhan, automated surveillance technology and video is used to catch illegal fishing, and in some cities not recycling results in negative social credit points. It is unclear in some of these instances if citizens have any potential routes for recourse.

News in 2023 has found that the Chinese Communist Party&#x27;s recent war on pollution has already brought substantial and measurable impacts, including China&#x27;s particulate pollution levels dropping 42% from 2013 levels and increasing the average lifespan expectancy of citizens by an estimated 2.2 years.

====India====
The Constitution of India has a number of provisions demarcating the responsibility of the Central and State governments towards Environmental Protection. The state&#x27;s responsibility with regard to environmental protection has been laid down under article 48-A of the constitution which stated that &quot;The states shall endeavor to protect and improve the environment and to safeguard the forest and wildlife of the country&quot;.

Environmental protection has been made a fundamental duty of every citizen of India under Article 51-A (g) of the constitution which says &quot;It shall be the duty of every citizen of India to protect and improve the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers, and wildlife and to have compassion for living creatures&quot;.

Article 21 of the constitution is a fundamental right, which states that &quot;No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to the procedure established by law&quot;.

====Middle East====
The Middle Eastern countries become part of the joint Islamic environmental action, which was initiated in 2002 in Jeddah. Under the Islamic Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the member states join the Islamic Environment Ministers Conference in every two years, focusing on the importance of environment protection and sustainable development. The Arab countries are also awarded the title of best environment management in the Islamic world.

In August 2019, the Sultanate of Oman won the award for 2018–19 in Saudi Arabia, citing its project &quot;Verifying the Age and Growth of Spotted Small Spots in the Northwest Coast of the Sea of Oman&quot;.

====Russia====
In Russia, environmental protection is considered an integral part of national safety. The Federal Ministry of Natural Resources and Ecology is the authorized state body tasked with managing environmental protection. However, there are a lot of environmental issues in Russia.

===Europe===
====European Union====
Environmental protection has become an important task for the institutions of the European Community after the Maastricht Treaty for the European Union ratification by all of its member states. The EU is active in the field of environmental policy, issuing directives such as those on environmental impact assessment and on access to environmental information for citizens in the member states.

====Ireland====
The Environmental Protection Agency, Ireland (EPA) has a wide range of functions to protect the environment, with its primary responsibilities including:
* Environmental licensing
* Enforcement of environmental law
* Environmental planning, education, and guidance
* Monitoring, analyzing and reporting on the environment
* Regulating Ireland&#x27;s greenhouse gas emissions
* Environmental research development
* Strategic environmental assessment
* Waste management
* Radiological protection

====Switzerland====

The environmental protection in Switzerland is mainly based on the measures to be taken against global warming. The pollution in Switzerland is mainly the pollution caused by vehicles and the litteration by tourists.

===Latin America===
The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has identified 17 megadiverse countries. The list includes six Latin American countries: Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela. Mexico and Brazil stand out among the rest because they have the largest area, population and number of species. These countries represent a major concern for environmental protection because they have high rates of deforestation, ecosystems loss, pollution, and population growth.

====Brazil====

Brazil has the largest amount of the world&#x27;s tropical forests, 4,105,401 km2 (48.1% of Brazil), concentrated in the Amazon region. Brazil is home to vast biological diversity, first among the megadiverse countries of the world, having between 15% and 20% of the 1.5 million globally described species.

The organization in charge of environment protection is the Brazilian Ministry of the Environment (in Portuguese: Ministério do Meio Ambiente, MMA). It was first created in the year 1973 with the name Special Secretariat for the Environment (Secretaria Especial de Meio Ambiente), changing names several times, and adopting the final name in the year 1999. The Ministry is responsible for addressing the following issues:
* A national policy for the environment and for water resources;
* A policy for the preservation, conservation and sustainable use of ecosystems, biodiversity, and forests;
* Proposing strategies, mechanisms, economic and social instruments for improving environmental quality, and sustainable use of natural resources;
* Policies for integrating production and the environment;
* Environmental policies and programs for the Legal Amazon;
* Ecological and economic territorial zoning.

In 2011, protected areas of the Amazon covered 2,197,485 km2 (an area larger than Greenland), with conservation units, like national parks, accounting for just over half (50.6%) and indigenous territories representing the remaining 49.4%.

====Mexico====

With over 200,000 different species, Mexico is home to 10–12% of the world&#x27;s biodiversity, ranking first in reptile biodiversity and second in mammals—one estimate indicates that over 50% of all animal and plant species live in Mexico.

The history of environmental policy in Mexico started in the 1940s with the enactment of the Law of Conservation of Soil and Water (in Spanish: Ley de Conservación de Suelo y Agua). Three decades later, at the beginning of the 1970s, the Law to Prevent and Control Environmental Pollution was created (Ley para Prevenir y Controlar la Contaminación Ambiental).

In the year 1972 was the first direct response from the federal government to address eminent health effects from environmental issues. It established the administrative organization of the Secretariat for the Improvement of the Environment (Subsecretaría para el Mejoramiento del Ambiente) in the Department of Health and Welfare.

The Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources (Secretaría del Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales, SEMARNAT) is Mexico&#x27;s environment ministry. The Ministry is responsible for addressing the following issues:
* Promote the protection, restoration, and conservation of ecosystems, natural resources, goods, and environmental services and facilitate their use and sustainable development.
* Develop and implement a national policy on natural resources
* Promote environmental management within the national territory, in coordination with all levels of government and the private sector.
* Evaluate and provide determination to the environmental impact statements for development projects and prevention of ecological damage
* Implement national policies on climate change and protection of the ozone layer.
* Direct work and studies on national meteorological, climatological, hydrological, and geohydrological systems, and participate in international conventions on these subjects.
* Regulate and monitor the conservation of waterways

In November 2000 there were 127 protected areas; currently there are 174, covering an area of 25,384,818 hectares, increasing federally protected areas from 8.6% to 12.85% of its land area.

===Oceania===
====Australia====

In 2008, there was 98,487,116 ha of terrestrial protected area, covering 12.8% of the land area of Australia. The 2002 figures of 10.1% of terrestrial area and 64,615,554 ha of protected marine area were found to poorly represent about half of Australia&#x27;s 85 bioregions.

Environmental protection in Australia could be seen as starting with the formation of the first national park, Royal National Park, in 1879. More progressive environmental protection had it start in the 1960s and 1970s with major international programs such as the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in 1972, the Environment Committee of the OECD in 1970, and the United Nations Environment Programme of 1972. These events laid the foundations by increasing public awareness and support for regulation. State environmental legislation was irregular and deficient until the Australian Environment Council (AEC) and Council of Nature Conservation Ministers (CONCOM) were established in 1972 and 1974, creating a forum to assist in coordinating environmental and conservation policies between states and neighbouring countries. These councils have since been replaced by the Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council (ANZECC) in 1991 and finally the Environment Protection and Heritage Council (EPHC) in 2001.

At a national level, the &quot;Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999&quot; is the primary environmental protection legislation for the Commonwealth of Australia. It concerns matters of national and international environmental significance regarding flora, fauna, ecological communities and cultural heritage. It also has jurisdiction over any activity conducted by the Commonwealth, or affecting it, that has significant environmental impact.
The act covers eight main areas:
* National Heritage Sites
* World Heritage Sites
* Ramsar wetlands
* Nationally endangered or threatened species and ecological communities
* Nuclear activities and actions
* Great Barrier Reef Marine Park
* Migratory species
* Commonwealth marine areas

There are several Commonwealth protected lands due to partnerships with traditional native owners, such as Kakadu National Park, extraordinary biodiversity such as Christmas Island National Park, or managed cooperatively due to cross-state location, such as the Australian Alps National Parks and Reserves.

At a state level, the bulk of environmental protection issues are left to the responsibility of the state or territory. Each state in Australia has its own environmental protection legislation and corresponding agencies. Their jurisdiction is similar and covers point source pollution, such as from industry or commercial activities, land/water use, and waste management. Most protected lands are managed by states and territories with state legislative acts creating different degrees and definitions of protected areas such as wilderness, national land and marine parks, state forests, and conservation areas. States also create regulation to limit and provide general protection from air, water, and sound pollution.

At a local level, each city or regional council has responsibility over issues not covered by state or national legislation. This includes non-point source, or diffuse pollution, such as sediment pollution from construction sites.

Australia ranks second place on the UN 2010 Human Development Index and one of the lowest debt to GDP ratios of the developed economies. This could be seen as coming at the cost of the environment, with Australia being the world leader in coal exportation and species extinctions. Some have been motivated to proclaim it is Australia&#x27;s responsibility to set the example of environmental reform for the rest of the world to follow.

====New Zealand====
At a national level, the Ministry for the Environment is responsible for environmental policy and the Department of Conservation addresses conservation issues. At a regional level the regional councils administer the legislation and address regional environmental issues.

===United States===

Since 1970, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has been working to protect the environment and human health.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is an independent executive agency of the United States federal government tasked with environmental protection matters.

All US states have their own state-level departments of environmental protection, which may issue regulations more stringent than the federal ones.

In January 2010, EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson published via the official EPA blog her &quot;Seven Priorities for EPA&#x27;s Future&quot;, which were (in the order originally listed):
* Taking action on climate change
* Improving air quality
* Assuring the safety of chemicals
* Cleaning up [US] communities
* Protecting America&#x27;s waters
* Expanding the conversation on environmentalism and working for environmental justice
* Building strong state and tribal partnerships
 it is unclear whether these still represent the agency&#x27;s active priorities, as Jackson departed in February 2013, and the page has not been updated in the interim.

==In literature==
There are numerous works of literature that contain the themes of environmental protection but some have been fundamental to its evolution. Several pieces such as &quot;A Sand County Almanac&quot; by Aldo Leopold, &quot;Tragedy of the commons&quot; by Garrett Hardin, and &quot;Silent Spring&quot; by Rachel Carson have become classics due to their far reaching influences. The conservationist and Nobel laureate Wangari Muta Maathai devoted her 2010 book Replenishing the Earth to the Green Belt Movement and the vital importance of trees in protecting the environment.

The subject of environmental protection is present in fiction as well as non-fictional literature. Books such as &quot;Antarctica&quot; and &quot;Blockade&quot; have environmental protection as subjects whereas &quot;The Lorax&quot; has become a popular metaphor for environmental protection. &quot;The Limits of Trooghaft&quot; by Desmond Stewart is a short story that provides insight into human attitudes towards animals. Another book called &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; by Ray Bradbury investigates issues such as bombs, wars, government control, and what effects these can have on the environment.

<text>Amaliada (, Katharevousa: Ἀμαλιάς, &quot;Amaliás&quot;) is a town and a former municipality in northwestern Elis, West Greece, Greece. Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Ilida, of which it is the seat and a municipal unit. The municipal unit has an area of 251.945 km2. It is near the archaeological site of Elis, the city-state whose territory was the site of the ancient Olympic Games. It is situated in the plains of Elis, 6 km from the Ionian Sea. It is 10 km southeast of Gastouni, 16 km northwest of Pyrgos and 60 km southwest of Patras.

Amaliada was named after Queen Amalia of Greece in the 1830s, and formed by merging two communes, Kalitsa and Dervitselepi. It features a city square with pine trees and a fountain. Most of the streets are in grid order running almost due north, south, east, and west. On the east side, Amaliada has a public sports stadium (mainly used for soccer). The hospital and the monastery of Frangavilla are in the southeast. Amaliada has a train station on the line from Patras to Pyrgos. A street in Amaliada&#x27;s west side is named Hiroshima in memory of the victims of the nuclear destruction of Hiroshima at the end of World War II. Kourouta and Palouki are the beaches of Amaliada, about 6 km southwest of the town centre.

<text>The Worshipful Company of Tobacco Pipe Makers and Tobacco Blenders is one of the Livery Companies of the City of London. The Company ranks 82nd in the order of precedence of the Companies. It does not have its own livery hall but is peripatetic, meeting instead at halls of various other Livery Companies.

The company&#x27;s motto is &quot;Producat Terra&quot;, Latin for &quot;Out of the Earth&quot;. Its church is St. Lawrence Jewry next Guildhall, the official Church of the Corporation of London, located on Gresham Street.

==History==
The company was first incorporated in 1619 by Royal Charter granted by King James I, with responsibility for regulating the manufacture of clay tobacco pipes in the City of London. In 1643, following the outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642, the Company forfeited its Charter through non-payment of its annual rent to King Charles I. The company was restored by King Charles II in 1663 but was declared bankrupt in 1868 after its powers of regulation over tobacco pipe makers were abolished and its income from its members had declined significantly. The company was reincorporated as the Worshipful Company of Tobacco Pipe Makers and Tobacco Blenders in 1954 by members of the Briar Pipe and Tobacco Trades, and in 1960 became a Livery Company once more, ranked 82nd in the order of precedence. 

The Company elected its first female Master, Fiona J Adler, in 2011. Fiona was the first woman to became a Freeman (by patrimony) and in 1997 she had become the first female Liveryman as well as a Trustee of the Benevolent Fund and subsequently Master of the Company. Her grandfather was the first Master of the Third Company in 1954 and was again elected Master in 1965. Her father was Master of the Company in 1982. Fiona was elected Non-Aldermanic Sheriff of the City of London for 2014–15.

==Modern activities and Officers==
In common with most of the other City Livery Companies, the company is no longer a trade association and is concerned only with philanthropy, benevolence and fellowship. Its freemen and liverymen enjoy a range of social events and activities. They donate and raise funds that are invested to enable dividends to be distributed to a range of charities and educational institutions through the company&#x27;s Benevolent Fund, as well as to members of the tobacco trade and their families who may need support.

The Master of the company for 2024-25 is Henry Tuck. Sandra Stocker is the Clerk.

<text>The Worshipful Company of Furniture Makers referred to as The Furniture Makers&#x27; Company, is one of the Livery Companies of the City of London. The organisation was formed in 1952, and was granted Livery status by the City in 1963 being the 83rd in order of precedence. Its church is St Mary-le-Bow

The Furniture Makers&#x27; Company is the British furnishing industry&#x27;s central organisation, charity and patron.

== History ==
The Furniture Makers&#x27; Company was formed originally as a guild in 1952 before being established as the 83rd livery company of the City of London in 1963. Their charity however was established over 100 years ago as the Furnishing Trades Benevolent Association (FTBA), later known as the Furnishing Industry Trust (FIT), dedicated to helping people in the furnishing industry in times of hardship. The Furniture Makers’ Company merged with FIT in 2013.

In 2007 the company acquired the freehold of 12 Austin Friars - Furniture Makers&#x27; Hall. Austin Friar has subsequently become the name of their main publication. The Furniture Makers&#x27; Hall was built in 1882 and still has many of the original Victorian features from when it was built, as well as bespoke wood furniture and fittings, including an ornate oak staircase running through the centre of the building. The Hall was purchased outright in 2007 and has been refurbished to create a venue for membership events.

==The Role of the Company==

Members of the Company, liverymen and freemen, come from many disciplines and professions, but all have a common link by being currently or previously engaged in or with the furniture and furnishings industry. This gives the Company “closed” status and ensures its activities are relevant to, and supportive of, the industry.

The Company is active in three main areas - education, excellence and welfare.

In education the Company works with schools, colleges, universities and commercial training providers to offer a range of training to potential and current industry participants.

The Company’s various award schemes recognize excellence in design, innovation, and sustainable production in the industry.

The Company’s welfare initiatives support current and past employees in the furniture and furnishings industry, offering both financial aid and pastoral care.

Additionally the Company works closely with the wider Livery movement in support of the Lord Mayor and the City of London and provides a range of charitable and social events to its members.

<text>The M21 sniper weapon system (SWS) in the US Army is a national match grade M14 rifle, selected for accuracy, and renamed the M21 rifle. The M21 uses a commercially procured 3–9× variable power telescopic sight, modified for use with the sniper rifle. It is chambered for the 7.62×51mm NATO cartridge.

==Overview==
The use of &quot;sharpshooters&quot; (or snipers) can be traced in U.S. military history from the time of the Revolutionary War of 1775–1781. Every U.S. military action since that time has required the special talent of such men. From 1955 to 1956, the United States Army Marksmanship Training Unit undertook a program to &quot;reiterate the lessons learned&quot; from past wars. However, this program was short-lived. The prevailing military attitude then envisioned any future conflict as nuclear with defeat or victory decided in hours.

With the adoption of the M14 service rifle, no provision was made for an M14 sniper rifle, [and] the designation of a sniper in the rifle squad was discontinued. The conflict in Vietnam revived the need for snipers. Snipers became &quot;optional&quot; and no table of organization and equipment (TOE) authorized sniper organizations [&quot;units&quot;].&quot; However, &quot;units&quot; could train and deploy snipers on a limited basis depending upon...requirements. As a result, U.S. Army snipers were trained in country in South Vietnam at Division. During the Vietnam War, U.S. Marines snipers were issued bolt-action hunting rifles, U.S. Army snipers were issued XM21 rifles. The Rock Island Arsenal converted 1,435 National Match (target grade) M14s by adding a 3-9x Redfield Adjustable Ranging Telescope (ART) and provided National Match grade (7.62 Lake City Long Range XM-118) ammunition. The ART scope, designed by 2nd Lieutenant James Leatherwood (U.S. Army), combined rangefinding and bullet drop compensation. The innovation came just in time as the U.S. military found itself losing servicemen to Viet Cong snipers who had the home field advantage in terrain that was, to say the least, difficult.

This version, designated as the XM21, had a specially selected walnut stock and was first fielded in the second half of 1969. An improved version with a fiberglass stock was designated the M21 in 1972. The M21 remained the Army&#x27;s primary sniper rifle until 1988, when it was replaced by the M24 sniper weapon system; some M21s were later re-issued and used in the Iraq War.

In standard military use, the M21 uses a 20-round box magazine as the other members of the M14 family and weighs 11 pounds (5.27 kg) without the scope. The U.S. military never officially authorized or purchased magazines in any other capacity, although 5- and 10-round magazines are available.

The M21 was criticized by an internal Fort Benning publication in 1989 warning that &quot;The M21...cannot be maintained under field conditions, and its inflexible design makes it highly susceptible to malfunctions&quot; due to the scope not being easily removable if needed and the glass bedded action that made disassembly in the field problematic.

==Service==
The XM21 sniper weapon system was issued to U.S. Army snipers during the Vietnam War, along with a commercially available sniper scope for day use, and a PVS-2 starlight scope for night operations. These men were trained at Army Division Base Camps; if a unit in country was a Brigade, Battalion, or smaller, and that unit requested snipers for their units, the requesting unit could send their sniper applicant to the next closest Division, such as Camp Eagle, 101st (Airmobile) Airborne Division, if that requesting unit was located in I Corps (Military Region 1), Republic of South Vietnam. The newly designated M21 saw limited actions during military operations after the Vietnam War ended in 1975. It was used by the U.S. Army Rangers during the Invasion of Grenada in 1983. There are limited numbers in some Army National Guard units and in a few specialized active units such as the OPFOR units of the Joint Readiness Training Center.

The XM21 served from 1969 to 1975, and the M21 officially served as the main Army sniper rifle from 1975 to 1988 until the introduction of the M24, which had supplanted the M21 in Ranger Battalions by 1990. However, many M14 and M21 variants came back into favor in the Iraq and Afghan wars in the 2000s.

<text>The long rifle, also known as the Kentucky rifle, Pennsylvania rifle, or American long rifle, is a muzzle-loading firearm used for hunting and warfare. It was one of the first commonly-used rifles. The American rifle was characterized by a very long barrel of relatively small caliber, uncommon in European rifles of the period.

The long rifle is an early example of a firearm using rifling (spiral grooves in the bore), which caused the projectile, commonly a round lead ball in the early firearm, to spin around the axis of its motion. This increased the stability of its trajectory and dramatically improved accuracy over contemporary smooth-bore muskets, which were cheaper and more common. Rifled firearms were first used in major combat in the American colonies in the eighteenth century during the French and Indian War, and later the American Revolution, with increasing use in the War of 1812, Texan Revolution, and American Civil War.

The main disadvantages of muzzle-loading rifles compared to muskets were higher cost, a slower reload time due to the use of a tighter-fitting lead ball, and greater susceptibility to fouling of the bore after prolonged use, which would ultimately prevent loading and make the weapon useless until cleaned. The invention of the Minié ball in 1847 resolved the technical disadvantages and allowed the rifle to replace the musket.

The long rifle was made popular by German gunsmiths who immigrated to America, bringing with them the technology of rifling from where it originated. The accuracy achieved by the long rifle made it an ideal tool for hunting wildlife for food.

==Origins==

The long rifle was developed on the American frontier in southeastern Pennsylvania, in the early 1700s. It continued to be developed technically and artistically until it passed out of fashion in the 19th century. The long rifle was the product of German gunsmiths who immigrated to new settlements in southeastern Pennsylvania in the early 1700s, and later in Virginia and other territories, reproducing early Jäger rifles (meaning &quot;hunter&quot; and sometimes anglicized &quot;Jaeger&quot;), which were used for hunting in Germany in the 17th and early 18th century. Tax records from these locales indicate the dates these gunsmiths were in business. Strong pockets of long rifle use and manufacture continued in the Appalachian Mountains of Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio and North Carolina well into the 20th century as a practical and efficient firearm for those rural segments of the nation. Long rifles could be made entirely by hand and hand-operated tooling, in a frontier setting.

Initially, the long firearm of choice on the frontier was the smoothbore musket, or trade gun, built in factories in England and France and shipped to the colonies for purchase. Gradually, long rifles became more popular due to their longer effective range. While the smooth bore musket had an effective range of less than 100 yards, a rifleman could hit a man-sized target at a range of 200 yards or more. The price for this accuracy was that the long rifle took significantly longer to reload than the approximately 20 seconds of the musket.

In Pennsylvania, the earliest gunsmiths that can be documented are Robert Baker and the Martin Meylins, father and son. Robert Baker formed a partnership with his son Caleb, and on August 15, 1719, erected a gun boring mill on Pequea Creek. In the tax records of Berks County, Pennsylvania, there were several gunsmiths plying their trade along the banks of the Wyomissing Creek.

Martin Meylin&#x27;s Gunshop was built in 1719, and it is here that the Mennonite gunsmiths of Swiss-German heritage crafted some of the earliest, and possibly the first, Pennsylvania Rifles. No rifle signed by Martin Meylin has been found; although two have been attributed to him, one in the Lancaster Historical Society has been found to be a European musket of a later date, and one with a date of 1705 is a forgery, as the Meylins arrived in America in 1710. The Martin Meylin Gunshop still stands today in Willow Street, Pennsylvania, on Long Rifle Road. An archaeological dig performed in 2005 by Millersville University around the so-called Meylin gunshop found thousands of artifacts, but only for blacksmithing, with no evidence of gun-making. The Lancaster County Historical Society has an original Pennsylvania Long Rifle thought to have been smithed by Meylin that was passed down within the family for seven generations, then donated to the society in the middle of the twentieth century. It was analyzed and the barrel removed during the Lancaster Long Rifle Exhibit at Landis Valley Farm Museum, Lancaster, Pennsylvania in 2005. The barrel was found to be European, and the stock dated from later than 1710-1750. The initials on the barrel, &quot;MM&quot;, were found to have been added later than any other part of the gun, so it could not have been made by either Martin Meylin.

Some historians have written that the role of Martin Meylin as one of the earliest gunsmiths in Lancaster is not clear. The argument is that the will of Martin Meylin Sr. makes no mention of gunsmith items, while the will of Martin Meylin Jr. is replete with them, so that the reference to Meylin as a gunsmith is more properly placed on the son. In any case, no rifle has been found to be positively attributed to any Meylin.

There is documentation stating that the first high-quality long rifles were from a gunsmith named Jacob Dickert, who moved with his family from Germany to Berks County, Pennsylvania in 1740. The name &#x27;Dickert Rifle&#x27; was considered a &#x27;brand name&#x27; and the name &#x27;Kentucky rifle&#x27; was not coined until much later in history (circa 1820s) and became the &quot;nickname&quot; of this rifle. This is primarily because Dickert made rifles for the Continental Army, and later had a contract dated 1792 to furnish rifles to the United States Army. The rifle is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Deckard / Deckhard&quot; rifle, as descendants of Jacob Dickert used these variations, as shown by census documents, marriage, and death certificates. Nearly all descendants of Jacob Dickert go by the surname &quot;Deckard&quot;, and mostly live in Indiana and Missouri. 

Among documented working rifle makers are Adam Haymaker, who had a thriving trade in the northern Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, the Moravian gunshops at Christian&#x27;s Spring in Pennsylvania, John Frederick Klette of Stevensburg, Virginia, and in the Salem area of North Carolina. All three areas were busy and productive centers of rifle making by the 1750s. Another prominent rifle maker was Isaac Haines of the Lancaster school, known for the elaborate Rococo woodcarving decorations on his rifles, who was taxed as a gunsmith in Lampeter Twp., Lancaster Co., from 1772 to 1792. The Great Wagon Road was a bustling frontier thoroughfare, and rifle shops traced this same route, from eastern Pennsylvania, down the Shenandoah Valley,and spilling into both the Cumberland Gap into Kentucky and the Yadkin River (Salem) area of North Carolina.

The settlers of western Virginia (Kentucky), Tennessee, and North Carolina soon gained a reputation for hardy independence and rifle marksmanship as a way of life, further reinforced by the performance of riflemen in the American Revolution, especially Morgan&#x27;s Riflemen, who were pivotal in the Battles of Saratoga and Cowpens, as well as the War of 1812. In that war, the long rifle gained its nickname &quot;Kentucky Rifle&quot;, after a popular song &quot;The Hunters of Kentucky&quot;, about Andrew Jackson and his victory at the Battle of New Orleans. The long rifle also was used by the Texans in their War for Independence from Mexico.

The reason for the long rifle&#x27;s characteristic long barrel is a matter of adaptation to the new world by the German immigrant gunsmiths. The German gunsmiths working in America were very familiar with German rifles, which seldom had barrels longer than 30 in., and were large-caliber rifles using large amounts of lead. Hunters in the vast and sparsely populated new world forests had to carry more of their supplies with them. The smaller caliber required less heavy lead per shot, reducing the weight they had to carry; the longer barrel gave the black powder more time to burn, increasing the muzzle velocity and accuracy. A rule of thumb used by some gunsmiths was to make the rifle no longer than the height of a customer&#x27;s chin because of the necessity of seeing the muzzle while loading. The longer barrel also allowed finer sighting. By the 1750s it was common to see frontiersmen carrying the new and distinctive style of rifle.

===Evolution===
In 1792 the US Army began to modify the long rifle, shortening the barrel length to 42 inches in their 1792 contract rifle. The Lewis and Clark expedition carried an even shorter 33-36 inch barrelled rifle, similar to the Harpers Ferry Model 1803 which began production six months after Lewis visited the arsenal. The Model 1803 resembles what became the &#x27;plains rifle&#x27;.

The &quot;plains rifle&quot; or &quot;Hawken rifle&quot; was a shorter rifle more suitable for carrying on horseback. It was popular among mountain men and North American fur trappers in the 19th century. The Hawken brothers (Samuel and Jacob) were one of a number of famous gunsmiths active in St. Louis in the 1830s-1860s. Many renowned gunsmiths such as Horace (H.E.) Dimick and J. P. Gemmer produced powerful and portable &quot;short&quot; rifles for the Rocky Mountain fur trade, overland exploration, and the transcontinental immigrant trains. The plains rifle combined accuracy with portability in a more compact package than the extreme long guns from which it had evolved. The Hawken rifle evolved from the long rifle for use against larger, more dangerous game encountered in the American West. For firing heavier and larger diameter bullets with heavier powder loads, the barrel wall thickness was necessarily increased for strength, and the barrel of the Hawken was shortened to keep the weight manageable, making the rifle heavier and less slim than the long rifle. However, many plains rifles were bored around the smaller .40 calibre range for medium-game hunting.

==Characteristics==

Artistically, the long rifle is known for its graceful stock, often made of curly maple, and its ornate decoration, decorative inlays, and an integral, well-made patch box that was built into the stock. The decorative arts of furniture making, painting, silver smithing, gunsmithing, etc. all took their style cues from the prevailing trends of the day, and as in most things the fashion was set in Paris. Baroque and later rococo motifs found their way into all the decorative arts, and can be seen in the acanthus leaf scroll work so common on 18th century furniture and silver.

Originally rather plain, by the 1770s every surface of the rifle could have applied artwork. An accomplished gunsmith had to be a skilled blacksmith, whitesmith, wood carver, brass and silver founder, engraver, and wood finisher. European shops at the time had significant specialization of the trades, leading to separate tradesmen building different parts of each rifle. The American frontier had no such luxury, and quite often a single gunmaker would make the entire rifle, a process almost unheard of in 18th-century trade practice. The flintlock action, with its spring mechanism, and single-action trigger, though, was often purchased in bulk from England by gunsmiths, and then fabricated with skill into an elaborate rifle. Early locks were imported, but domestic manufacturing of locks increased in America among the more skilled gunsmiths in later years.

To conserve lead on the frontier, smaller calibers were often preferred, ranging often from about .32 to .45 cal. As a rifle&#x27;s bore increased with use due to wear and corrosion from firing black powder, it was not uncommon to see rifles re-bored and re-rifled to larger calibers to maintain accuracy. Many copies of historical long rifles are seen with a bore of around .50 caliber.

The long rifle is said by modern experts to have a range of 80 to 100 yards for the average user. An expert shooter can extend the median range of the long rifle to 200-300 yards.

Although less commonly owned or seen on the frontier, the long rifle style was also used on flintlock pistols during the same era. These pistols were often matched in caliber to a long rifle owned by the same user, to enable firing a common-sized and common-patched round lead ball. With the same graceful stock lines and barrel style, and craftsmanship, they were noticeably slimmer and had a longer rifled barrel with better sights than had been seen on the earlier Colonial style flintlock pistols. Dueling pistol sets in the long rifle style were also made, sometimes in a cased set, for wealthy gentlemen.

==Decline and rebirth==

By the 20th century, there was little traditional long rifle making left except in isolated pockets in the Appalachian mountains. Popular interest in shooting as a sport as well as the sesquicentennial of the United States&#x27; independence from Britain in 1925-33 spurred interest in the origins of the long rifle. This renewed interest was described in the 1924 book by Capt. John G.W. Dillin &quot;The Kentucky Rifle&quot;. Early 20th century pioneers of long rifle culture were Walter Cline, Horace Kephart, Ned Roberts, Red Farris, Hacker Martin, Bill Large, Jack Weichold, Ben Hawkins, D.C. Addicks, L.M. Wolf, Dave Taylor, Win Woods, and Alvin Wagner.

Many men throughout the remainder of the 20th century worked to expand the knowledge of the long rifle and how to recreate it in the 18th and 19th century manner. In 1965, Wallace Gusler, as the first master of the Gunsmith shop in Colonial Williamsburg, was the first to recreate a long rifle in modern times using 18th-century tools and techniques. The 1968 film &quot;Gunsmith of Williamsburg&quot; documented the production of his second, all handmade, long rifle. By 2003, makers trained at the Gunsmith Shop in Colonial Williamsburg and others produced an all-handmade rifles. In addition to his influence in his popular series of articles for Rifle Magazine and his involvement with the Museum of Early Southern Decorative Arts (MESDA), John Bivins trained the recognized gunmakers Jim Chambers and Mark Silver.

In 1996, the Contemporary Longrifle Association (CLA) was founded for people hand-making recreations of long rifles and associated arms and crafts of pre-1840 America. Later, internet forums about building traditional muzzleloading arms grew to over 3,000 members by 2010.

<text>A semi-automatic firearm, also called a self-loading or autoloading firearm (fully automatic and selective fire firearms are also variations on self-loading firearms), is a repeating firearm whose action mechanism automatically loads a following round of cartridge into the chamber and prepares it for subsequent firing, but requires the shooter to manually actuate the trigger in order to discharge each shot. Typically, this involves the weapon&#x27;s action utilizing the excess energy released during the preceding shot (in the form of recoil or high-pressure gas expanding within the bore) to unlock and move the bolt, extracting and ejecting the spent cartridge case from the chamber, re-cocking the firing mechanism, and loading a new cartridge into the firing chamber, all without input from the user. To fire again, however, the user must actively release the trigger, and allow it to &quot;reset&quot;, before pulling the trigger again to fire off the next round. As a result, each trigger pull only discharges a single round from a semi-automatic weapon, as opposed to a fully automatic weapon, which will shoot continuously as long as the ammunition is replete and the trigger is kept depressed.

Ferdinand Ritter von Mannlicher produced the first successful design for a semi-automatic rifle in 1885, and by the early 20th century, many manufacturers had introduced semi-automatic shotguns, rifles and pistols.

In military use, the semi-automatic M1911 handgun was adopted by the United States Army in 1911, and subsequently by many other nations. Semi-automatic rifles did not see widespread military adoption until just prior to World War II, the M1 Garand being a notable example. Modern service rifles such as the M4 carbine are often selective-fire, capable of semi-automatic and automatic or burst-fire operation. Civilian variants such as the AR-15 are generally semi-automatic only.

==Early history (1885–1945)==
The first successful design for a semi-automatic rifle is attributed to Austria-born gunsmith Ferdinand Ritter von Mannlicher, who unveiled the design in 1885. The Model 85 was followed by the equally innovative Mannlicher Models 91, 93 and 95 semi-automatic rifles. Although Mannlicher earned his reputation with his bolt-action rifle designs, he also produced a few semi-automatic pistols, including the Steyr Mannlicher M1894, which employed an unusual blow-forward action and held five rounds of 6.5mm ammunition that were fed into the M1894 by a stripper clip.

===Semi-automatic shotgun===

In 1902, American gunsmith John Moses Browning developed the first successful semi-automatic shotgun, the Browning Auto-5, which was first manufactured by Fabrique Nationale de Herstal and sold in America under the Browning name. The Auto-5 relied on long recoil operation; this design remained the dominant form in semi-automatic shotguns for approximately 50 years. Production of the Auto-5 ended in 1998.

===Blowback semi-automatic===

In 1903 and 1905, the Winchester Repeating Arms Company introduced the first semi-automatic rimfire and centerfire rifles designed especially for the civilian market. The Winchester Model 1903 and Winchester Model 1905 operated on the principle of blowback in order to function semi-automatically. Designed entirely by T. C. Johnson, the Model 1903 achieved commercial success and continued to be manufactured until 1932 when the Winchester Model 63 replaced it.

By the early 20th century, several manufacturers had introduced semi-automatic .22 sporting rifles, including Winchester, Remington, Fabrique Nationale and Savage Arms, all using the direct blow-back system of operation. Winchester introduced a medium caliber semi-automatic sporting rifle, the Model 1907 as an upgrade to the Model 1905, utilizing a blowback system of operation, in calibers such as .351 Winchester. Both the Models of 1905 and 1907 saw limited military and police use.

===Notable early semi-automatic rifles===

In 1906, Remington Arms introduced the Remington Auto-loading Repeating Rifle. Remington advertised this rifle, renamed the &quot;Model 8&quot; in 1911, as a sporting rifle. This is a locked-breech, long recoil action designed by John Browning. The rifle was offered in .25, .30, .32, and .35 caliber models, and gained popularity among civilians as well as some law enforcement officials who appreciated the combination of a semi-automatic action and relatively powerful rifle cartridges. The Model 81 superseded the Model 8 in 1936 and was offered in .300 Savage as well as the original Remington calibers.

The first semi-automatic rifle adopted and widely issued by a major military power (France) was the Fusil Automatique Modele 1917. This is a locked-breech, gas-operated action that is very similar in its mechanical principles to the future M1 Garand in the United States. The M1917 was fielded during the latter stages of World War I but it did not receive a favorable reception. However, its shortened and improved version, the Model 1918, was much more favourably received during the Moroccan Rif War from 1920 to 1926. The Lebel bolt-action rifle remained the standard French infantry rifle until replaced in 1936 by the MAS-36 despite the various semi-automatic rifles designed between 1918 and 1935.

Other nations experimented with self-loading rifles between the two World Wars, including the United Kingdom, which had intended to replace the bolt-action Lee–Enfield with a self-loader, possibly chambered for sub-caliber ammunition, but discarded that plan as the imminence of the Second World War and the emphasis shifted from replacing every rifle with a new design to speeding-up re-armament with existing weapons. The Soviet Union and Nazi Germany would both issue successful self-loading and selective-fire rifles on a large scale during the course of the war, but not in sufficient numbers to replace their standard bolt-action rifles.

===Notable gas-operated rifles===

In 1937, the American M1 Garand was the first semi-automatic rifle to replace its nation&#x27;s bolt-action rifle as the standard-issue infantry weapon. The gas-operated M1 Garand was developed by Canadian-born John Garand for the U.S. government at the Springfield Armory in Springfield, Massachusetts. After years of research and testing, the first production model of the M1 Garand was unveiled in 1937. During World War II, the M1 Garand gave American infantrymen an advantage over their opponents, most of whom were issued slower firing bolt-action rifles.

The Soviet AVS-36, SVT-38 and SVT-40 (originally intended to replace the Mosin-Nagant as their standard service rifle), as well as the German Gewehr 43, were semi-automatic gas-operated rifles issued during World War II. In practice, they did not replace the bolt-action rifle as a standard infantry weapon.

Another gas-operated semi-automatic rifle developed toward the end of World War II was the SKS. Designed by Sergei Gavrilovich Simonov in 1945, it came equipped with a bayonet and could be loaded with ten rounds, using a stripper clip. However, the SKS was quickly replaced by the AK-47, produced at around the same time, but with a 30-round magazine, and select fire capability. The SKS was the first widely issued weapon to use the 7.62×39mm cartridge.

== Types ==

There are semi-automatic pistols, rifles, and shotguns designed and made as semi-automatic only. Selective-fire firearms are capable of both full automatic and semi-automatic modes.

Semi-automatic refers to a firearm that uses the force of recoil or gas to eject the empty case and load a fresh cartridge into the firing chamber for the next shot and which allows repeat shots solely through the action of pulling the trigger. A double-action revolver also requires only a trigger pull for each round that is fired but is not considered semi-automatic since the manual action of pulling the trigger is what advances the cylinder, not the energy of the preceding shot.

==Fully automatic compared to semi-automatic==


The usage of the term &quot;automatic&quot; may vary according to context. Gun specialists point out that the word &quot;automatic&quot; is sometimes misunderstood to mean fully automatic fire when used to refer to a self-loading, semi-automatic firearm not capable of fully automatic fire. In this case, &quot;automatic&quot; refers to the loading mechanism, not the firing capability. To avoid confusion, it is common to refer to such firearms as an &quot;autoloader&quot; in reference to their loading mechanism.

The term &quot;automatic pistol&quot; almost exclusively refers to a semi-automatic (i.e. not fully automatic) pistol (fully automatic pistols are usually referred to as machine pistols). With handguns, the term &quot;automatic&quot; is commonly used to distinguish semi-automatic pistols from revolvers. The term &quot;auto-loader&quot; may also be used to describe a semi-automatic handgun. However, to avoid confusion, the term &quot;automatic rifle&quot; is generally, conventionally, and best restricted to a rifle capable of fully automatic fire. Both uses of the term &quot;automatic&quot; can be found; the exact meaning must be determined from context.

==Auto-loading==

The mechanism of semi-automatic (or autoloading) firearms is usually what is known as a closed-bolt firing system. In a closed-bolt system, a round must first be chambered manually before the weapon can fire. When the trigger is pulled, only the hammer and firing pin move, striking and firing the cartridge. The bolt then recoils far enough rearward to extract and load a new cartridge from the magazine into the firearm&#x27;s chamber, ready to fire again once the trigger is pulled.

An open-bolt mechanism is a common characteristic of fully automatic firearms. With this system, pulling the trigger releases the bolt from a cocked, rearward position, pushing a cartridge from the magazine into the chamber, firing the gun. The bolt retracts to the rearward position, ready to strip the next cartridge from the magazine. The open-bolt system is often used in submachine guns and other weapons with a high rate of fire. It is rarely used in semi-automatic-only firearms, which can fire only one shot with each pull of the trigger. The closed-bolt system is generally more accurate, as the centre of gravity changes relatively little at the moment the trigger is pulled.

With fully automatic weapons, the open-bolt operation allows air to circulate, cooling the barrel. With semi-automatic firearms, the closed-bolt operation is preferred, as overheating is not as critical, and accuracy is preferred. Some select-fire military weapons use an open bolt in fully automatic mode and a closed bolt when semi-automatic is selected.

==Legal status==

Many jurisdictions regulate some or all semi-automatic firearms differently than other types.

Various types of semi-automatic weapons were restricted for civilian use in New Zealand after the 2019 Christchurch mosque shootings, in Australia after the 1996 Port Arthur massacre, in Norway after the 2011 Utøya shooting. In the United States, the 1994–2004 Federal Assault Weapons Ban prohibited semi-automatic weapons with certain additional characteristics. As of 2023, several U.S. states still restrict similar types of semi-automatic weapons.

<doc id="375769" wikidata="Q9099" url="?curid=375769" title="Tabaré Vázquez">
<text>Tabaré Ramón Vázquez Rosas (; 17 January 1940 – 6 December 2020) was a Uruguayan politician and oncologist who served as the 39th and 41st president of Uruguay from 2005 to 2010 and from 2015 to 2020. During his political career, Vázquez was a member of the Broad Front coalition. Before his first presidential term, Vázquez was president of the Club Progreso team and made two unsuccessful presidential bids in 1994 and 1999. He served as Intendant of Montevideo between 1990 and 1994 shortly before his first presidential campaign.

Vázquez was first elected president on 31 October 2004 and took office on 1 March 2005. He was the first socialist president of the country. His first presidency was remembered for his diplomatic relationships with Brazil and Argentina while being criticized by his party over his anti-abortion views. After leaving the presidency in 2010, Vázquez successfully ran for a second term in 2014. After leaving office for a second time in March 2020, he later died of lung cancer in December of that year at the age of 80.

==Early life==
Vázquez was born in the neighbourhood of La Teja, Montevideo on 17 January 1940, the fourth child of Héctor Vázquez, a worker of ANCAP, and Elena Rosas. He had Galician ancestry; his grandparents were originally from Ourense and Santiago de Compostela. He studied medicine at the Universidad de la República Medical School, graduating as an oncologist in 1972. In 1976, he received a grant from the French government, allowing him to obtain additional training at the Gustave Roussy Institute in Paris.

==Early career and Intendant of Montevideo==
Vázquez, an avid football fan, was president of the Club Progreso team from 1979 to 1989.

From 1990 to 1995, Vázquez was the Frente Amplio coalition&#x27;s first Intendant of Montevideo. In that post, he carried out the functions of both the mayor of the city and governor of the department.

In 1994, he made an unsuccessful run for president as the &quot;Frente Amplio&quot; candidate. He actually finished with the most votes of the candidates in the field, more than 120,000 votes ahead of the next-highest vote-getter, former president Julio Maria Sanguinetti of the Colorado Party. However, under the multi-candidate Ley de Lemas system then in effect, Sanguinetti won the election, since he was the highest-finishing candidate of the party winning the most votes. Still, Vázquez turned in the best showing of a third-party candidate since the restoration of the presidential system in 1967; he only had 12,100 fewer votes than the combined vote of the second-place National Party.

In 1996, he was elected leader of the Frente Amplio, replacing the historic leader of the left-wing coalition, Líber Seregni. He ran again unsuccessfully for president in 1999. In the first election held after Uruguay scrapped the Ley de Lemas system, he led the field in the first round, with 40.1 percent of the vote. He lost to Colorado candidate Jorge Batlle, taking 45.9 percent of the vote.

==First presidency of Uruguay (2005–2010)==

In the 2004 elections, he won 50.45% of the valid votes, enough to win the presidency in a single round. He became the country&#x27;s first president from a left-wing party, and thus the first one since the 1830s who was not a member of the National (Blanco) or Colorado parties. He also had the support of the President of Brazil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, likewise a centre-left democratic socialist.

Among the most complex issues that dominated his administration was an ongoing conflict with Argentina over potential contamination from pulp mills being built on the Uruguayan side of the Uruguay River. He even asked Bush for help in the event of an armed conflict with Argentina.

Vázquez was the first President of Uruguay to visit New Zealand and South Korea, and he established contacts with other countries in Southeast Asia. While he maintained cordial relations with the United States, hosting U.S. President George W. Bush, Vázquez did not sign Bush&#x27;s failed Free Trade Area of the Americas.

This visit attracted a measure of censure from the opposition, from Pedro Bordaberry and others, who were critical of Vázquez for having chosen to be in Cuba during a commemoration – which Vázquez himself initiated – for the victims of the 1973–1985 dictatorship; Bordaberry&#x27;s father, Juan María Bordaberry, established the dictatorship with a 1973 decree dissolving Congress.

In 2007 the loading of Iranian arms onto a Uruguayan Navy vessel visiting Venezuela, in contravention of a UN-sponsored arms embargo, provoked international comment. The domestic controversy regarding this event was centred on protests against Vázquez&#x27;s Government by the opposition National Party.

In June 2008 President Vázquez visited Cuba. While in Cuba, Vázquez and the Presidential party engaged in a number of high-profile events, including a summit with President Raúl Castro.

In June 2009 President Vázquez, who had been courting diplomatically the Bolivian President Evo Morales, announced his support for the delisting of coca leaves from the category of a &quot;dangerous drug&quot;.

In February 2010 the Vázquez Government was cooperating with an investigation to explain how two Northrop F-5E jet engines valued at many millions of U.S. dollars had surfaced in Uruguay.

Tabaré Vázquez and his government have pursued a centre-left economic policy. Between 2005 and 2008, the minimum wage rose from 1,350 pesos to 4,150 pesos ($70 to $200), while poverty fell from 30.9 per cent to 12.7 per cent of the population and unemployment from 11.3 per cent to 7 per cent.

==Popularity==
According to an Equipos/MORI opinion poll his approval had fallen to 44% by April 2007, a level below the electoral support he received in the 2004 elections. His approval later recovered, however, reaching 80% by his last term in office.

In October 2006, President Vázquez was still personally more popular than his government with a 62% approval rating. However, a considerable drop in the government&#x27;s popularity was registered by an Equipos/MORI poll in late April 2007, showing that 44% of Uruguayans approved of his administration. A new poll by Factum showed a 57% approval by June 2008, however, indicating a significant recovery from a year earlier.

==2009 presidential election==
The Constitution of Uruguay does not allow presidents to run for immediate reelection. With this in mind, in January 2008, members of the ruling coalition made proposals to amend the document in order to allow Vázquez to run again in 2009, however Vázquez ruled out a 2009 run. José Mujica was elected in November 2009 as president and Vázquez was offered to resume the presidency of the Frente Amplio but he declined. Vázquez went on to be the Frente Amplio candidate for presidency in 2014.

On 4 December 2008, Vázquez resigned his leadership posts at the Socialist Party due to controversy over his opposition to abortion rights.

==Second presidency of Uruguay (2015–2020)==

In February 2010, a poll showed that he would finish the term ended on 1 March 2010 with an historic 61% of the approval. Vázquez finally left office with an 80% approval rating. He formally accepted his candidacy for the 2014 election in February 2013.

Renominated by the Broad Front for the presidency with running mate Raúl Fernando Sendic on 1 June, he came up just a few thousand votes short of winning the presidency outright in 26 October election. He was returned to office in the 30 November runoff, defeating right-wing candidate Luis Lacalle Pou of the National Party by 53% to 41% in the second round. Vázquez took office on 1 March 2015, succeeding José Mujica.

After assuming the position, he also became the President pro tempore of UNASUR until 23 April 2016, as he succeeded at the same time José Mujica who was holding the presidency of this international organization.

On 9 September 2017, his running mate and Vice President Raúl Fernando Sendic resigned after he was accused allegedly of misusing public funds while heading state oil company Ancap. Sendic&#x27;s bad image began with a scandal over his non-existent degree in Human Genetics in 2016, and deeply damaged the image of Vázquez and his government which already suffered from historically low approval.

== Personal life and death ==

Vázquez married María Auxiliadora Delgado on 23 October 1964 in the Montevideo parish of Los Vascos. She died of a heart attack on 31 July 2019. They had three biological children together and an adopted son.

On 20 August 2019, President Vázquez revealed that he suffered from a lung nodule with malignant appearance. Nevertheless, he announced his intention of finishing his presidential term on 1 March 2020 as planned. At mid-November, it was confirmed by authorities of the Public Health Ministry that his lung cancer was cured. On 27 November 2020, the rumor spread of his worsening state of health and a &quot;Republica&quot; journalist announced that his cancer had metastasized to the pancreas. That day, his son reported that his father was in home hospitalization after suffering an acute thrombosis in his left leg, but was recovering.

He died of his lung cancer in Montevideo on 6 December 2020, at age 80. President Luis Lacalle Pou declared three days of national mourning following his death and said that Uruguay &quot;lost a prominent scientist and a citizen defender of human rights&quot;. His funeral was held in &quot;intimacy&quot; due to the COVID-19 pandemic and he was buried at Cementerio de La Teja in Montevideo alongside his wife. During the funeral procession, thousands of people took to the streets to see him off to applause and cheers. The night before a national applause was called from the balconies.

==Honours and awards==

===WHO recognition===
Vázquez was awarded the World Health Organization Director-General&#x27;s Award in 2006 in recognition of his leadership on tobacco control in Uruguay, which has implemented some of the most stringent tobacco control measures in the world.

<text>The Seventh Fleet is a numbered fleet of the United States Navy. It is headquartered at U.S. Fleet Activities Yokosuka, in Yokosuka, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. It is part of the United States Pacific Fleet. At present, it is the largest of the forward-deployed U.S. fleets, with 50 to 70 ships, 150 aircraft and 27,000 sailors and marines. Its principal responsibilities are to provide joint command in natural disaster or military operations and operational command of all U.S. naval forces in the region.

==History==
===World War II===
The Seventh Fleet was formed on 15 March 1943 in Brisbane, Australia, during World War II, under the command of Admiral Arthur S. &quot;Chips&quot; Carpender. It served in the South West Pacific Area (SWPA) under General Douglas MacArthur. The Seventh Fleet commander also served as commander of Allied naval forces in the SWPA.

Most of the ships of the Royal Australian Navy were also part of the fleet from 1943 to 1945 as part of Task Force 74 (formerly the Anzac Squadron). The Seventh Fleet—under Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid—formed a large part of the Allied forces at the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the largest naval battle in history, in October 1944. The Seventh Fleet fought in two of the Battle of Leyte Gulf&#x27;s main actions, the Battle of Surigao Strait and the Battle off Samar.
===1945–1950===
After the end of the war, the 7th Fleet moved its headquarters to Qingdao, China. As laid out in Operation Plan 13–45 of 26 August 1945, Kinkaid established five major task forces to manage operations in the Western Pacific: Task Force 71, the North China Force with 75 ships; Task Force 72, the Fast Carrier Force, directed to provide air cover to the Marines going ashore and discourage with dramatic aerial flyovers any Communist forces that might oppose the operation; Task Force 73, the Yangtze Patrol Force with another 75 combatants; Task Force 74, the South China Force, ordered to protect the transportation of Japanese and Chinese Nationalist troops from that region; and Task Force 78, the Amphibious Force, charged with the movement of the III Marine Amphibious Corps to China.

After the war, on 1 January 1947, the Fleet&#x27;s name was changed to Naval Forces Western Pacific. In late 1948, the Fleet moved its principal base of operations from Qingdao to the Philippines, where the Navy, following the war, had developed new facilities at Subic Bay and an airfield at Sangley Point. Peacetime operations of the Seventh Fleet were under the control of Commander in Chief Pacific Fleet, Admiral Arthur W. Radford, but standing orders provided that, when operating in Japanese waters or in the event of an emergency, control would pass to Commander, Naval Forces Far East, a component of General Douglas MacArthur&#x27;s occupation force.

On 19 August 1949 the force was designated as United States Seventh Task Fleet. On 11 February 1950, just prior to the outbreak of the Korean War, the force assumed the name United States Seventh Fleet, which it holds today.

=== Korean War ===

Seventh Fleet units participated in all major operations of the Korean and Vietnamese Wars. The first Navy jet aircraft used in combat was launched from a Task Force 77 (TF 77) aircraft carrier on 3 July 1950. The landings at Inchon, Korea were conducted by Seventh Fleet amphibious ships. The battleships , , and all served as flagships for Commander, U.S. Seventh Fleet during the Korean War. During the Korean War, the Seventh Fleet consisted of Task Force 70, a maritime patrol force provided by Fleet Air Wing One and Fleet Air Wing Six, Task Force 72, the Formosa Patrol, Task Force 77, and Task Force 79, a service support squadron.

Over the next decade the Seventh Fleet responded to numerous crisis situations including contingency operations conducted in Laos in 1959 and Thailand in 1962. During September 1959, in the autumn of 1960, and again in January 1961, the Seventh Fleet deployed multiship carrier task forces into the South China Sea. Although the Pathet Lao and North Vietnamese supporting forces withdrew in each crisis, in the spring of 1961 their offensive appeared on the verge of overwhelming the pro-American Royal Lao Army.

Once again the fleet moved into Southeast Asian waters. By the end of April 1961, most of the Seventh Fleet was deployed off the Indochinese Peninsula preparing to initiate operations into Laos. The force consisted of the and carrier battle groups, antisubmarine support carrier , one helicopter carrier, three groups of amphibious ships, two submarines, and three Marine battalion landing teams. At the same time, shorebased air patrol squadrons and another three Marine battalion landing teams stood ready in Okinawa and the Philippines to support the afloat force. Although the administration of President John F. Kennedy already had decided against American intervention to rescue the Laotian government, Communist forces halted their advance and agreed to negotiations. The contending Laotian factions concluded a cease-fire on 8 May 1961, but it lasted only a year.

In June 1963 the Seventh Fleet held &#x27;Flagpole &#x27;63,&#x27; a joint naval exercise with the Republic of Korea.
Seventh Fleet represented the first official entrance of the United States into the Vietnam War, with the Gulf of Tonkin incident. Between 1950 and 1970, the U.S. Seventh Fleet was known by the tongue-in-cheek nickname &quot;Tonkin Gulf Yacht Club&quot; since most of the fleet&#x27;s operations were conducted from the Tonkin Gulf at the time.

On 12 February 1965, became the first U.S. Navy ship to conduct operations inside Vietnam coastal waters. &quot;Salisbury Sound&quot; set up a seadrome in Da Nang Bay and conducted seaplane patrols in support of Operation Flaming Dart, the bombing of North Vietnamese army camps.

Operating primarily from Yankee Station off the north coast of Vietnam and the aptly-named Dixie Station off the south coast of Vietnam in the South China Sea, Seventh Fleet was organized into a series of task forces, often known by the acronym CTF (Commander Task Force):
* Task Force 73 included the fleet&#x27;s logistics support vessels operating as an underway replenishment group (URG) containing an oiler, an ammunition ship, and other supply tenders.
* Task Force 75, Surface Combatant Force, contained the fleet&#x27;s surface combatants and naval gunfire support. These units formed the to bombard enemy forces during Operation Sea Dragon, Operation Custom Tailor, and Operation Lion&#x27;s Den. The Royal Australian Navy contributed a series of guided missile destroyers to the gun line, including , , , and . The naval gun line concept was made possible with deep waters for larger vessels well away from both the shoals and enemy coastal artillery. Task Group 70.8, a cruiser-destroyer subset of the task force, began shelling Vietnam on 27 May 1965. The cruisers and destroyers mostly used 5-inch and 8-inch guns while opened fire with her 16-inch guns.
* Task Force 76 was the Amphibious Force, Seventh Fleet. Marines went ashore at Da Nang in March 1965 and patrolled throughout the I Corps area of responsibility during operations Starlite, Dagger Thrust, Double Eagle, and Jackstay.
* Task Force 77 was the Carrier Battle Force, Seventh Fleet. It would participate in striking North Vietnamese targets, providing air support to US forces in South Vietnam, and mining Haiphong Harbor.
* Task Force 78 was the fleet&#x27;s minesweeper support. After the 1973 cease-fire, it was responsible for Operation End Sweep, removing naval mines dropped in Haiphong harbor only months earlier.
* Task Forces 116 and 117 were brown-water riverine forces involved in the interdiction efforts Operation Market Time, Operation Game Warden, and Operation Sealords.

In 1975, ships and aircraft of the Fleet evacuated thousands of U.S. citizens and refugees from South Vietnam and Cambodia as those countries fell to opposing forces.

Since the end of the Vietnam War, the Seventh Fleet has participated in a joint/combined exercise called Team Spirit, conducted with the Republic of Korea armed forces. With capability to respond to any contingency, Fleet operations are credited with maintaining security during the Asian Games of 1986 and the Seoul Olympics of 1988. During 1989, Seventh Fleet units participated in a variety of exercises called PACEX, the largest peacetime exercises since World War II.

=== 1971 War ===

A carrier task force of the Seventh Fleet, Task Force 74 (TF 74), entered the Bay of Bengal at the height of the war in December 1971. 

The U.S. government stated at the time that the goal of the task force was to help evacuate Pakistani forces from East Pakistan following a ceasefire.

The task force comprised the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier ; the amphibious assault carrier ; the destroyers , , and ; the guided-missile escorts , , and ; the nuclear-powered attack submarine ; and supply ship . On 15 December, a day before the surrender of Pakistan to the joint force of India and Bangladesh (then East Pakistan), the task force entered the Bay of Bengal, at a distance of some from Dhaka.
At the same time, the Royal Navy also had forces in the Arabian Sea.

The Soviet Union also dispatched the 10th Operative Battle Group of its Pacific Fleet under Admiral Vladimir Kruglyakov from Vladivostok to the area.

=== Gulf War and 1990s ===

In response to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on 2 August 1990, General Norman Schwarzkopf (CINCCENT) discussed naval command arrangements in his area of responsibility with Commander-in-Chief, Pacific, Admiral Huntington Hardisty. The result was that Commander, U.S. Seventh Fleet was ordered to assume additional responsibilities as Commander, U.S. Naval Forces Central Command. The Fleet Commander departed Yokosuka, Japan immediately, heading for the Persian Gulf, and joined the remainder of his staff aboard the flagship on 1 September 1990. During Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm, Naval Forces Central Command exercised command and control of the largest U.S. Navy armada since the Second World War. At the peak of combat operations, over 130 U.S. ships joined more than 50 allied ships to conduct maritime intercept operations, minesweeping and combat strike operations against enemy forces in Iraq and Kuwait.

Naval Forces Central Command included six aircraft carrier battle groups, two battleships (&quot;Missouri&quot; and &quot;Wisconsin&quot;), two hospital ships, 31 amphibious assault ships, four minesweeping vessels and numerous combatants in support of allied air and ground forces. After a decisive allied victory in the Gulf War, Commander U.S. Seventh Fleet relinquished control of Naval Forces Central Command to Commander, Middle East Force on 24 April 1991 and returned to Yokosuka, Japan to resume his Asia-Pacific duties.

Following months of tension as well as the death of North Korean leader Kim Il-Sung, in July 1994, the &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; battle group was diverted from a Southern Watch deployment to the Persian Gulf and remained in the Western Pacific (the Seventh Fleet&#x27;s operation area) for the entire deployment. The &quot;Independence&quot; also conducted operations near the Peninsula during the crisis.

In 1996, two aircraft carrier battle groups were sent to the Taiwan Straits under Seventh Fleet control to demonstrate U.S. support for Taiwan during the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis. The &quot;Nimitz&quot; battle group (CCDG 7) made a high-speed transit from the Persian Gulf, while Carrier Group Five, led by &quot;Independence&quot;, sortied from its Japanese homeports.

===USS &quot;John S. McCain&quot; and &quot;Alnic MC&quot; collision ===

On 21 August 2017, while on a routine visit to Singapore, destroyer was involved in a collision with merchant vessel &quot;Alnic MC&quot; off the coast of Singapore, east of the Strait of Malacca. The incident left 10 Navy sailors missing and five injured. The US Navy announced that Commander of the Seventh Fleet Vice Adm. Joseph Aucoin had been dismissed and replaced by Vice Adm. Phillip G. Sawyer, who had already been nominated and confirmed to replace the retiring Aucoin.
==Operations==

Of the 50–60 ships typically assigned to Seventh Fleet, 18 operate from U.S. facilities in Japan and Guam. These forward-deployed units represent the heart of Seventh Fleet, and the centerpieces of American forward presence in Asia. They are seventeen steaming days closer to locations in Asia than their counterparts based in the continental United States. It would take three to five times the number of rotationally-based ships in the U.S. to equal the same presence and crisis response capability as these 18 forward deployed ships. On any given day, about 50% of Seventh Fleet forces are deployed at sea throughout the area of responsibility.

Following the end of the Cold War, the two major military scenarios in which the Seventh Fleet would be used would be in case of conflict in Korea or a conflict between People&#x27;s Republic of China and Taiwan (Republic of China) in the Taiwan Strait.

It was reported on 10 May 2012 that would be dispatched to Singapore in the northern spring of 2013 for a roughly 10-month deployment. On 2 June 2012 the U.S. and Singaporean Defense Ministers announced that Singapore has agreed &#x27;in principle&#x27; to the US request &#x27;to forward deploy up to four littoral combat ships to Singapore on a rotational basis.&#x27; Officials stressed however that vessels will not be permanently based there and their crews will live aboard during ship visits.

==Fleet organization==
The Seventh Fleet is organized into specialized task forces.
Task Force 70 – TF 70 is the Battle Force of 7th Fleet and is made up of two distinct components: Surface Combatant Force 7th Fleet, composed of cruisers and destroyers, and Carrier Strike Force 7th Fleet, made up of at least one aircraft carrier and its embarked air wing. The Battle Force is currently centered around Carrier Strike Group Five, the carrier responsible for unit-level training, integrated training, and material readiness for the group&#x27;s ships and aviation squadrons. As the only continuously forward deployed carrier strike group, the CSG 5 staff does not stand down when the strike group is in Yokosuka, but instead continues to command deploying Carrier Strike Groups and independently deployed cruisers, destroyers, and frigates that operate in the Seventh Fleet operating area - Task Force 70 duties. The composition of the strike group in immediate proximity of &quot;George Washington&quot; varies throughout the year.

The CSG 5 Commander also serves as Battle Force Seventh Fleet and Commander, Task Force (CTF 70) for 7th Fleet. In these responsibilities, CSG 5 serves as the Commander of all surface forces (carrier strike groups, independently deploying cruisers, destroyers and frigates) in the 7th Fleet area of responsibility. CTF 70 also serves as the Theater Surface Warfare Commander (TSUWC) and Theater Integrated Air Missile Defense Commander (TIAMDC) for Seventh Fleet.

During the Korean War, Captain Charles L. Melson was the commanding officer of the flagship of the Seventh Fleet, the battleship from 20 October 1952. He also served during that time as Commander, Task Group 70.1.

Task Force 71 – TF 71 includes all Naval Special Warfare (NSW) units and Explosive Ordnance Disposal Mobile Units (EODMU) assigned to 7th Fleet. It is based in Guam.

Task Force 72 – TF 72 is the Patrol and Reconnaissance Force, Seventh Fleet. It is located at Naval Air Facility Misawa (Misawa Air Base), Japan. It is mainly composed of anti-submarine warfare (ASW) aircraft and maritime airborne surveillance platforms such as P-3 Orion and Lockheed EP-3 reconnaissance planes operating on land bases. Toward the end of the Korean War, Commander Task Force 72 transferred his flag to on 7 March and detachments of VP-42 also left USS &quot;Salisbury Sound&quot; for that seaplane tender. That same day Task Force Seventy-Two was established as the Formosa Patrol Force under Rear Admiral Williamson in Pine Island.

Task Force 73/Commander, Logistics Group Western Pacific – 7th Fleet&#x27;s Logistics Force composed of supply ships and other fleet support vessels. Headquartered in Singapore.

Task Force 74 – TF 74 was the designation used for the &quot;Enterprise&quot; battle group in 1971. Today, it is the Fleet Submarine Force responsible for planning and coordinating submarine operations within 7th Fleet&#x27;s area of operations.

Task Force 75 – Navy Expeditionary Forces Command Pacific is 7th Fleet&#x27;s primary Expeditionary task force. Located in Camp Covington, Guam, CTF 75 is responsible for the planning and execution of coastal riverine operations, explosive ordnance disposal, diving, engineering and construction, and underwater construction throughout the 7th Fleet area of responsibility.

Task Force 76 – Amphibious assault task force currently headquartered at U.S. Fleet Activities Sasebo, mainly responsible for supporting Marine landing operations. It is composed of units capable of delivering ship-to-shore assault troops, such as and amphibious assault ships, and landing craft.

Task Force 77 – 7th Fleet Mine Warfare Force composed of mine countermeasure, mine hunter, and mine control ships as well as mine countermeasure helicopters (MH-53). This task force is only activated during specific combat operations and was filled by the Commander of Mine Warfare Command. Mine Warfare Command has now been disestablished and replaced by Navy Mine and Antisubmarine Warfare Command, Naval Base Point Loma, Calif.

Task Force 78 – In 1973, Task Force 78 served as the mine clearance force that cleared Haiphong Harbour in Operation End Sweep. Major elements of the U.S. Navy mine warfare force, including Mobile Mine Command (MOMCOM), Mine Warfare Support Group (MWFSG), and HM-12 were airlifted by C-5A to NAS Cubi Point in the Philippines. These specialists formed the nucleus of Task Force 78, under the command of Rear Admiral Brian McCauley, for Operation End Sweep. Commander, Mine Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet had reported to Vice Admiral James L. Holloway III, Commander, Seventh Fleet, in September 1972 as Commander Task Force 78. TF 78 was officially activated in November 1972. However, it became clear more helicopters were needed. Responding to a Navy request for assistance, Commanding General, Fleet Marine Force Pacific (CG FMFPAC) directed that HMH-463 deploy from MCAS Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii, to NAS Cubi Point, to join Task Force 78. On 27 November 1972, with the efficient support of Col. Bill Crocker&#x27;s MAG-24, HM-463 embarked at Pearl Harbor aboard , which was en route from Norfolk to augment Seventh Fleet Amphibious Forces and to participate in End Sweep.

The ceasefire was signed on 23 January 1973, and the day afterwards, major components of TF 78 deployed from Subic Bay to Haiphong. These included four ocean minesweepers (MSO), USS &quot;Inchon&quot;, and four amphibious ships, including two with docking capabilities to handle the minesweeping sleds towed by the CH-53Ms. During the six months of Operation End Sweep, ten ocean minesweepers, nine amphibious ships, six fleet tugs, three salvage ships, and nineteen destroyers operated in Task Force 78 in the vicinity of Haiphong.&#x27;

As of 2010, Commander Naval Forces Korea, an administrative liaison unit between USFK, the ROK Navy, and Seventh Fleet, has been assigned the TF 78 designation. Naval Forces Korea is headquartered at Busan and has a base at Chinhae, Commander Fleet Activities Chinhae.

Task Force 79 – The Marine expeditionary unit or Landing Force assigned to the fleet, consisting of at least a reinforced Marine battalion and its equipment. This unit is separate from the Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) normally embarked in USS &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot; Amphibious Readiness Group (ARG). Marine units serving in 7th Fleet are normally drawn from III Marine Expeditionary Force based in Okinawa, Japan.

<text>Robert Wentworth John Holness (12 November 1928 – 6 January 2012) was a British-South African radio and television presenter and occasional actor. He presented the British version of &quot;Blockbusters&quot;.

==Early life==
Holness was born in Vryheid, Natal, South Africa. His grandfather had been a mining engineer and prospector; Holness&#x27;s father succeeded him in these mining interests, &quot;and regularly drove across Natal, paying out the wages at the mines, and returning with lumps of gold that had been discovered&quot;. When he was seven, his family moved to England, initially to Herne Bay, Kent, where his grandfather Nathaniel had been brought up, then later to Ashford, Kent. After attending Ashford Grammar School and briefly Eastbourne College Holness went on to Maidstone College of Art (now the University for the Creative Arts). He then returned to South Africa and worked for a printing company.

==Career==
After moving back to South Africa in the 1950s, Holness joined a repertory theatre in Durban, South Africa.

=== Radio career ===
In 1955, Holness received his first job as a radio presenter and, a year later, became the second actor to portray James Bond (after Barry Nelson in the 1954 TV special &quot;Casino Royale&quot;) in a radio production of &quot;Moonraker&quot; for the SABC&#x27;s Springbok Radio.

Holness joined the BBC as a presenter on &quot;Late Night Extra&quot;, initially on the BBC Light Programme and later on Radio 1 and Radio 2, presenting alongside Terry Wogan, Michael Parkinson and Keith Fordyce. From 1971, the show was broadcast solely on Radio 2. He moved to independent radio and co-presented the award-winning breakfast-time &quot;AM Programme&quot; alongside Douglas Cameron on London&#x27;s LBC radio station between 1975 and 1985. Holness originally joined the station as an airborne traffic reporter, later progressing to reading networked news bulletins for IRN. He won the Variety Club Award for &#x27;Joint Independent Radio Personality of the Year&#x27; in both 1979 and 1984.

From 1985 to 1997, Holness returned to Radio 2, presenting many shows including &quot;Bob Holness Requests the Pleasure&quot; and &quot;Bob Holness and Friends&quot;, as well as covering various weekday shows for holidaying presenters. From the late 1960s until 1998, he presented the request programme &quot;Anything Goes&quot; on the BBC World Service.

=== Television career ===
In 1962, Holness became the host of UK game show &quot;Take a Letter&quot;, and relief host of Thames Television&#x27;s magazine programme &quot;Today&quot; in 1968. From 1983 until 1994 he presented the British version of &quot;Blockbusters&quot;, for which he is probably best known. Holness starred in a celebrity special of &quot;Catchphrase&quot; in 1988, and later appeared again with his daughter, Carol, in a Christmas version of &quot;Family Catchphrase&quot;, he was also on the 1988 Christmas edition of Bullseye partnered with Eric Bristow. In 1990 he was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;.

Holness hosted Yorkshire Television&#x27;s big-budget game show flop &quot;Raise the Roof&quot;, in 1995, before becoming the chairman of a revived &quot;Call My Bluff&quot; for the BBC. Holness appeared on one episode of &quot;Ant and Dec&#x27;s Saturday Night Takeaway&quot; in 2004, when he presented the last round of Ant and Dec&#x27;s &quot;Blockbusters&quot;, with Ant as a contestant.

Aside from presenting, Holness had an occasional acting career in television shows including &quot;Thriller&quot;, &quot;Rex the Runt&quot; and &quot;The Impressionable Jon Culshaw&quot;.

==&quot;Baker Street&quot;==
Holness was the subject of an urban myth, claimed to have been initiated in the 1980s by broadcaster Stuart Maconie who, writing for the &quot;New Musical Express&quot; in a section called &#x27;Believe It or Not&#x27;, said that Holness had played the saxophone riff on Gerry Rafferty&#x27;s 1978 song &quot;Baker Street&quot;. The actual performer was Raphael Ravenscroft. Tommy Boyd has disputed Maconie&#x27;s claim to authorship of the rumour, however, saying he was the first to make the claim, while a DJ on London&#x27;s LBC, looking for false stories for a quiz.

==Personal life and death==
Holness met his wife, former actress Mary Rose Clifford, in repertory theatre in South Africa. The couple married in 1955 before they returned to England in 1961, originally living with Mary&#x27;s family in London, before moving to Manchester. Three years later, the family relocated to north-west London, settling in Pinner. The pair had three children: a son, Jonathan, and two daughters, Carol Ann (aka Nancy Nova) and Ros, singers and members of the band Toto Coelo.

Holness gave his support to many charities, including the children&#x27;s charities Teenage Cancer Trust, Young People&#x27;s Trust for the Environment and National Children&#x27;s Home (now Action for Children), of which he was vice-president from 1994.

On 24 November 2002, Holness suffered a major stroke, following which a brain scan revealed he had previously suffered a number of transient ischaemic attacks over several years. He also suffered from hearing loss. Holness was diagnosed with coeliac disease in 2005. In the last few years of his life he suffered from vascular dementia and was cared for by his family at their home in Pinner until the last two weeks of his life when he entered Denville Hall nursing home. On 6 January 2012, Holness&#x27; family announced that he had died earlier that day, in his sleep, at the age of 83. His wife died on 26 June 2020 in Pinner, London. He had seven grandchildren.

<doc id="375788" wikidata="Q1273232" url="?curid=375788" title="Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl">
<text>Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl is a 1982 concert comedy film directed by Terry Hughes (with the film segments by Ian MacNaughton) and starring the Monty Python comedy troupe (Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, and Michael Palin) as they perform many of their sketches at the Hollywood Bowl. The film also features Carol Cleveland in numerous supporting roles and Neil Innes performing songs. Also present for the shows and participating as an &#x27;extra&#x27; was Python superfan Kim &quot;Howard&quot; Johnson.

The show also included filmed inserts which were mostly taken from two Monty Python specials, &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Fliegender Zirkus&quot;, which had been broadcast on German television in 1972. The performance was recorded on videotape during the show&#x27;s four-day run starting September 26, 1980 and transferred to film. In the wake of &quot;Life of Brian&quot;″s worldwide success, the Pythons originally planned to release a film consisting of the two German shows redubbed and re-edited, but this proved impractical, and so &quot;Hollywood Bowl&quot; was released instead.

Although it mostly contains sketches from the television series, the scripts and performers are not identical to those seen on television. The line-up also includes some sketches that predated &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;, including the &quot;Four Yorkshiremen sketch&quot;, which dated from 1967&#x27;s &quot;At Last the 1948 Show&quot;.

==Sketches and songs==
* &quot;Sit on My Face&quot; – A ribald parody of Gracie Fields&#x27; &quot;Sing as We Go&quot; from &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Contractual Obligation Album&quot;, performed by Cleese, Chapman, Gilliam and Jones in waiter outfits, sans trousers or underwear.
* &quot;Colin &#x27;Bomber&#x27; Harris&quot; – After an introduction by Palin, Chapman is his own opponent in the wrestling ring as Cleese delivers play-by-play. This is a mime piece that dates back to Chapman&#x27;s college days.
* &quot;Never Be Rude to an Arab&quot; – Jones performs an ostensible anti-racism song filled with demeaning epithets and is subsequently blown up. This sketch has two parts at different points in the show. In the first part, he&#x27;s blown up and dragged offstage by Kim Johnson dressed as a large frog. In the second, he&#x27;s blown up and dragged off by Johnson dressed as a Christmas tree. Also from &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Contractual Obligation Album&quot;.
* &quot;The Last Supper&quot; – Michelangelo (Idle) defends his creative first draft of The Last Supper painting against the objections of the Pope (Cleese). This sketch was originally written and performed by John Cleese for the first Amnesty benefit show &quot;A Poke in the Eye (With a Sharp Stick)&quot; in 1976, with Jonathan Lynn as Michelangelo. It is based on a historical incident involving the Renaissance painter Paolo Veronese.
* &quot;Silly Olympics&quot; – In a filmed section, athletes compete in absurd sporting events of the &quot;Silly Olympiad,&quot; an event traditionally held every 3.7 years. The events include
**The 100m for Runners with No Sense of Direction. On the starting gun, the runners run off in every single direction.
** The 1,500m for the Deaf. They don&#x27;t move because they can&#x27;t hear the starting gun.
** The 200m Freestyle for Non-Swimmers. At the starting whistle, they all jump into the water and immediately sink without surfacing, to which the commentator remarks that they&#x27;ll return to the swimming when they start &quot;fishing the corpses out&quot;.
** The Marathon for Incontinents (people with extremely weak bladders). In this, runners fall away from the group every couple of meters to relieve themselves, giving others the lead. This also shows them all running into the men&#x27;s room on the starting gun and running past a water table without any of them getting a drink.
** The 3000m Steeplechase for People Who Think They&#x27;re Chickens. In this, the runners are all doing chicken movements all over the course, and seem to be trying desperately to lay eggs on the hurdles.
** The High Jump briefly features, with one of the Pythons, perhaps Cleese, dressed as a woman. He takes a run-up, then jumps ridiculously high over a wall and onto a high balcony.
The &quot;Silly Olympics&quot; sketch is from the first &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Fliegender Zirkus&quot; episode, dubbed into English. The original version also featured the events &quot;1500m for people and their mothers&quot; and &quot;Hammer throw to America&quot;, whereas the latter acted as a link to the next sketch.
* &quot;Bruces&#x27; Philosophers Song&quot; – The University of Woolloomooloo&#x27;s Philosophy Department throws cans of Foster&#x27;s Lager at the audience and perform &quot;The Philosophers&#x27; Song&quot;, accompanied by large Gilliam cutouts, detailing the drinking habits of history&#x27;s great thinkers and project lyrics for the audience and viewers to sing along to. Eric Idle, Michael Palin, and Neil Innes play three Bruces. Originally from the second season of the TV series.
* &quot;The Ministry of Silly Walks&quot; – Palin has difficulty gaining funding for his (only slightly) silly walk. This also contains colour footage of the archival &#x27;silly walks&#x27; film seen in the first episode of the second Python television series.
* &quot;Camp Judges&quot; – British judges (Idle and Palin) behave unconventionally outside the courtroom. From &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;, series 2.
* &quot;World Forum/Communist Quiz&quot; – Historical socialist leaders Karl Marx (Jones), Lenin (Cleese), Che Guevara (Palin) and Mao Tse-tung (Gilliam) are asked British football trivia questions in a quiz show game hosted by Idle. From &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;, series 2.
* &quot;I&#x27;m the Urban Spaceman&quot; – Neil Innes performs the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band number as Carol Cleveland tap dances and constantly loses timing of the song. The song dates to 1968 and was performed in &quot;Do Not Adjust Your Set&quot;; this staging of it as a comedy dance routine previously appeared in &quot;Rutland Weekend Television&quot; with Lyn Ashley as the dancer.
* &quot;Crunchy Frog&quot; – Candymaker Jones answers to the police (Chapman and Gilliam, who vomits into his helmet - Gilliam filled his mouth with cold beef stew when he ran off stage during the scene) for his disgusting varieties of chocolates. From series 1.
* &quot;Albatross&quot; – Cleese, dressed as a waitress, attempts to vend a wandering albatross to audience member Jones. The sketch is stopped by the colonel (Chapman) for being too silly, who then orders Jones to report on stage for the next sketch. Originally performed during Season 1, although the film version uses adult language.
* &quot;Nudge Nudge&quot; – Idle pesters Jones with perplexing innuendo. Originally performed in the third episode of &quot;Monty Python&quot;.
* &quot;International Philosophy&quot; – In a filmed sequence, German philosophers take on Greek philosophers on a football field. This piece is from the second &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Fliegender Zirkus&quot; episode. It is shown in two parts, with &quot;Four Yorkshiremen&quot; in between each.
* &quot;Four Yorkshiremen sketch&quot; – Well-to-do Yorkshiremen (Palin, Idle, Chapman, and Jones) try to top one another&#x27;s tales of their austere beginnings, each story getting more exaggerated and absurd. Originally written for &quot;At Last the 1948 Show&quot;.
* The Argument Sketch – Palin pays Cleese to disagree with him. Sketch interrupted by Gilliam suspended from wires performing &quot;I&#x27;ve Got Two Legs.&quot; Cleese ends Gilliam&#x27;s singing by shooting him with a shotgun. The sketch originates from the TV series, though Gilliam&#x27;s song was not part of the TV sketch.
* &quot;How Sweet to Be an Idiot&quot; – Neil Innes sings an ode to lunacy. Also heard on the &quot;Monty Python Live at Drury Lane&quot; album.
* &quot;Travel Agency&quot; – Palin attempts to sell a package tour to Mr. Smoketoomuch (Idle), who has a speech impediment where he can’t pronounce the letter ‘c’. He then goes on a very long rant about travel difficulties and will not stop, even as he is chased by an asylum orderly (Cleese) all about the stadium. He even interrupts the next sketch.
* &quot;Comedy Lecture&quot; – Chapman explains slapstick comedy fundamentals in an extremely highbrow manner as Palin, Gilliam, and Jones demonstrate, with Jones invariably becoming the jokes&#x27; victim. Originally from the Experimental Theatre Club&#x27;s revue called &quot;Loitering with Intent&quot;. (This skit was actually done close to the intermission to give time for Jones to clean himself up, plus it includes Gilliam being forced to shove an entire banana into his mouth.)
* &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot; – In a filmed sequence, Cleese as Little Red Riding Hood endures a fractured retelling of the classic fairy tale. This piece is from the first &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Fliegender Zirkus&quot; episode, dubbed into English. (Some VHS versions of Hollywood Bowl omit this piece.)
* &quot;Dead Bishop on the Landing&quot; (aka &quot;Salvation Fuzz&quot;) – A dead bishop on the landing disrupts a family&#x27;s mealtime.
** During the performance of this sketch, technical difficulties (a microphone starts feeding back) make Terry Jones lose his place (he temporarily looks up with a smirk on his face). Corpsing is rampant in this sketch; Eric Idle has trouble keeping a straight face while delivering his lines with an extraordinarily overwrought Yorkshire accent, which also causes Terry Jones to openly burst out laughing. At one point, Jones loses his &#x27;Pepperpots&#x27; wig, which goes flying across the stage. Graham Chapman and Michael Palin slide across the stage to hide Jones as he replaces the wig, after which they all have trouble keeping a straight face (particularly Palin). This was always a difficult sketch to perform live—on other occasions, the &#x27;Hand of God&#x27; (a large Gilliam-designed cut-out) fingered the wrong character. Idle describes the sketch as &quot;shambolic&quot; as he segues into:
* &quot;The Lumberjack Song&quot; – A rugged, masculine outdoorsman (Idle, as opposed to Palin in the original BBC series; Palin had also performed it in &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Fliegender Zirkus&quot;) unsettles the chorus by revealing his fondness for wearing women&#x27;s clothes.
* The following sketches from the Hollywood Bowl live show were cut from the film release: The Llama (opening sketch), Gumby Flower Arranging (second sketch); Mrs. Thing and Mrs. Entity (Pepperpots sketch) and, most surprisingly, the Dead Parrot sketch.

==Box office==
A film version of the Hollywood Bowl performances, with direction credited to Terry Hughes, was given a limited theatrical release in North America beginning on 25 June 1982. It grossed a total of US$327,958 during its theatrical run.

== Technical and release history ==
The show was originally recorded on a specially-made analogue high-definition video system called &#x27;Image Vision&#x27; (an early HDTV system), provided by Image Transform from Universal City, California which output a 655 line, 24fps video signal. The show was edited on videotape and a 35mm negative was produced from the tape for the striking of theatrical prints.

In Europe, a 1.85:1 widescreen version was released on DVD in 2007. In North America, the film is available only as an older lesser-quality full-frame version, as part of a two-disc set titled &quot;Monty Python Live&quot;, which includes the 1998 retrospective &quot;Monty Python Live at Aspen&quot; and the first (German) episode of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Fliegender Zirkus&quot;. The movie was also released as part of &quot;The Complete Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus 16-Ton Megaset&quot; and as part of &quot;Almost Everything Ever in One Gloriously Fabulous Ludicrously Definitive Outrageously Luxurious Monty Python Boxset&quot;.

<text>The Worshipful Company of Scientific Instrument Makers is one of the 111 livery companies of the City of London. It ranks 84th in the order of precedence for the livery companies.

== History ==
The Company was originally formed in 1956 when science and manufacturing were key to the UK economy and the memory of war time defence requirements were still fresh and the UK was a large-scale manufacturer of specialist electronic and mechanical scientific instruments. It is one of the Modern Livery Companies formed since 1926 having been granted its livery status by the City in 1963. In 2021, it was granted a Royal Charter.

As with the original Livery Companies it supports the profession and the craft of scientific instrument making, this is achieved through the exchange of ideas and information between members and guests, and also by its charitable donations supporting those in or retired from the profession.

The Company shares Glazier&#x27;s Hall with two other Companies. The Hall was originally a tea warehouse and is built into the structure of London Bridge. Although the Livery Hall appears to be outside the boundary of the City of London, it is actually in the Ward of Bridge and Bridge Without and so linked to the Bridge Ward Club.

The Livery has a long-standing connection with the Institute of Measurement and Control, the Scientific Instrument Society and a number of other bodies related to measurement such as UKAS, NPL and BSi.

The history of the Company has been documented in two publications created by Past Masters and these can be downloaded here.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms includes two key figures from the area of scientific instrument making, Sir Isaac Newton and Michael Faraday. The crest is Minerva the Roman Goddess of wisdom and strategic warfare. It is featured in a stained glass window in the Company church St Margaret Lothbury.

== Membership and Governance ==

Members, although from diverse areas such as nanotechnology, mechanical engineering, genetics and astronomy, industry and academia, must be connected to instrumentation or measurement in some way to join.

The Company has four levels of membership. Younger members (from 16 years old) who are still studying or in training can be Apprentices. This enables them to receive financial and/or mentoring support. The next is Freeman, usually someone who is early in their career; then up to Liveryman who are established in their profession and eligible to serve on the Court and progress to Master. Occasionally, Honorary Freemen are admitted as a result of serving the Company or profession in some significant way.

<doc id="375807" wikidata="Q373620" url="?curid=375807" title="Adrian Mole">
<text>Adrian Albert Mole is the fictional protagonist in a series of books by English author Sue Townsend. The character first appeared (as &quot;Nigel&quot;) as part of a comic diary featured in a short-lived arts magazine (called simply &quot;magazine&quot;) published in Leicester in 1980, and shortly afterward in a BBC Radio 4 play in 1982. The books are written in the form of a diary, with some additional content such as correspondence. The first two books appealed to many readers as a realistic and humorous treatment of the inner life of an adolescent boy, and capturing the &quot;zeitgeist&quot; of the UK during the Thatcher period.

==Themes==

The first books concentrate on Adrian&#x27;s desires and ambitions in life (to marry his teenage sweetheart, publish his poetry and novels, obtain financial security) and his complete failure to achieve them. The series satirises human pretensions, and especially, in the first couple of volumes, teenage pretensions.

The second theme is depiction of the social and political situation in Britain, with particular reference to left-wing politics in the 1980s in the first three books. For example, Mr and Mrs Mole&#x27;s divorce reflects rising divorce rates in the 1980s, and living together unmarried was becoming a norm. Adrian&#x27;s mother becomes a staunch feminist and briefly joins the Greenham Common campaigners. Pandora, Adrian&#x27;s love interest, and her parents are part of an intellectualised and left-wing middle class that attempted to embrace the working class.

Humour arises from the outworking of larger social forces within a very ordinary household in a very ordinary part of Middle England.

The last three books move in slightly new directions, showing Adrian as an adult in different environments. They have a stronger element of political satire, mainly examining New Labour, and in &quot;Weapons of Mass Destruction&quot;, the Iraq War. The intervening book, &quot;Adrian Mole: The Wilderness Years&quot;, mixes these themes, with events such as the Gulf War seen from Adrian&#x27;s naive and frustrated point of view, as well as depictions of his experiences of unemployment and public spending cutbacks, both major political issues at the time. In dealing with political events, a constant plot device is that Adrian makes confident predictions and statements that are known to be wrong by the reader, ranging from belief in the Hitler Diaries to an Iraqi victory in the Gulf War and the existence of their weapons of mass destruction.

==Biography==
Adrian Albert Mole is born 2 April, with the first book establishing the year as 1967. He grows up with his parents in the city of Leicester; before moving to Ashby-de-la-Zouch in England&#x27;s East Midlands. Adrian&#x27;s family are largely unskilled working class/lower middle class. He is an only child until the age of 15, when his half-brother Brett and half-sister Rosie are born. Adrian is not gifted academically but does tolerably well at school, though he does sometimes suffer the ire of headmaster &quot;Pop-Eye&quot; Scruton. Though not especially popular he has a small circle of friends and even a girlfriend Pandora Braithwaite (whose parents Ivan and Tania are affluent Trotskyites). At one point he falls into bad company with Barry Kent and his gang, who had bullied him in earlier years, but generally he keeps out of trouble. Throughout all this Adrian sees himself as an &quot;intellectual&quot; and a thwarted &quot;Great Writer&quot;.

Ironically Adrian actually &quot;is&quot; a good writer, as the quality of his diaries attests, but he feels he must adopt a &quot;high&quot; or avant-garde literary style to be taken seriously. His novel &quot;Lo! The Flat Hills of My Homeland&quot; is unsurprisingly never published: the few passages included in the diaries are painful to read (though Adrian himself regards them as &quot;magnificent&quot;), and the first few drafts were even written without vowels. Over several books he develops a script for a white van serial killer comedy programme which the BBC is reluctant to produce. Another of his works, &quot;The Restless Tadpole: An Opus&quot;, is described by one potential agent as &quot;effete crap&quot;.

As a young man he moves to London and takes a job in a Soho restaurant catering to media types. London is going through a foodie renaissance and offal is all the rage. Adrian is persuaded to feature as a celebrity chef in a television cookery programme called &quot;Offally Good!&quot;; although he is told the programme is a comedy, he typically fails to realise he is being set up as the stooge, the comic . He is contracted to write a book to accompany the show, but is suffering from writer&#x27;s block, so his mother eventually writes it for him, without his knowledge, with a dedication reading &quot;To my beloved mother, Pauline Mole, who has nurtured me and inspired me throughout my life. Without this magnificent woman&#x27;s wisdom and erudition I could not have written this book.&quot;

Adrian befriends an old pensioner called Archie Tait whilst he is living back at home with his mother. When Archie dies, Adrian goes to live in his old house, since Archie had no real ties. He finds out that Glenn Bott is his son and cannot pay Sharon all the money, so he cares for Glenn full-time. Glenn&#x27;s remedial teacher, Eleanor Flood, a convicted arsonist, burns Archie&#x27;s old house down.

Adrian ends up working in an antiquarian bookshop. Having lived in relative poverty for much of his life, and for some time in London in actual squalor, he overextends himself financially, lured by the banks&#x27; promises of easy credit, and buys a converted loft apartment, at Rat Wharf. He is terrorized by swans, buys a talking fridge, and enjoys his newfound freedom as his children are &quot;off his hands&quot;. Glenn is now in the British Army while William is living with his mother and Mole&#x27;s ex-wife, Jojo, in Nigeria.

Adrian gets caught up in a relationship with Marigold Flowers, a strange woman with a passion for dollhouses. He is attracted to her at first, but he likes her less each day and she costs him a lot of money. He tries and fails to end the relationship. Adrian&#x27;s debt accumulates to such an extent that he owes £200,000 at one point.

Eventually Adrian moves into his parents&#x27; converted pigsties, along with Marigold&#x27;s sister Daisy, whom he marries. The couple settle down and have a daughter Gracie, but Adrian&#x27;s problems are far from over. He suffers the double tragedy of losing his new wife to the local squire while discovering that he himself has cancer. His loyal friend and co-worker Bernard Hopkins comes to the rescue, moving in with him and promising to remain until his cancer is in remission. Fortunately Adrian&#x27;s cancer treatment is successful and Bernard leaves to pursue romance with a local widow, giving Adrian a pig as a farewell present. The final book ends with Adrian finding out he will be a grandfather and Pandora arriving outside the house.

===Family===
The Mole family is dysfunctional. Adrian&#x27;s parents Pauline and George Mole are working-class characters with limited social mobility who drink and smoke heavily. Both are often unemployed; they have separated, divorced and remarried several times, often in the wake of extramarital affairs. In a reversal of a typical teenager-mother relationship, Pauline berates Adrian for keeping his room &quot;like a bloody shrine&quot;. They move from Leicester to Ashby-de-la-Zouch with their dog (only ever referred to as &quot;the dog&quot;, who is eventually replaced by &quot;the new dog&quot;). Adrian&#x27;s paternal grandmother Edna May Mole is also prominent in the early diaries until her death in &quot;The Wilderness Years&quot;.

Pauline first leaves George for their neighbour, Mr. Lucas, an insurance man. George fathers a second son, Brett, by a lover, Doreen Slater, whom Adrian privately refers to as &quot;Stick Insect&quot;. Brett makes a reappearance in the later books as a successful yet unpleasant businessman who loses his fortune during the 2007–2008 financial crisis. Doreen is killed off in &quot;Prostrate Years&quot;. Pauline temporarily marries her younger lodger Martin Muffet, who eventually leaves her for Adrian&#x27;s girlfriend Bianca Dartington, giving Adrian and his mother a shared heartbreak. Later, George and Pauline effect a partner swap with Ivan and Tania Braithwaite (parents of Pandora), only to reunite after Ivan&#x27;s untimely death.

Adrian&#x27;s half-sister, Rosie Germaine Mole (after feminist Germaine Greer), grows up to be rebellious and street-smart, in contrast to Adrian. Despite opposing personalities, the siblings enjoy a close relationship, and Adrian often feels that she is the only family member who understands him. She also relies on him on occasion; when she becomes pregnant as a teenager, Adrian supports her decision to have an abortion.

Although the identity of Rosie&#x27;s father is originally uncertain, in &quot;The Prostrate Years&quot; Mr Lucas, now wealthy, gets back in touch with Rosie and demands a DNA test on &quot;The Jeremy Kyle Show&quot;. Adrian tries to talk his mother and Rosie out of informing George or appearing on the show, but they do so; the test proves that Mr Lucas is Rosie&#x27;s father. As Rosie&#x27;s relationship with her parents breaks down, she moves in with Mr Lucas and starts calling him &quot;Dad&quot; and herself &quot;Rosie Lucas&quot;. Pauline also raises the possibility of Adrian&#x27;s real father being a poetry-writing maggot farmer she dated before she married George, but Adrian decides not to investigate. He thanks his father after learning that he raised him single-handedly during the first year of his life when Pauline was suffering from postpartum depression.

It is mentioned that Adrian&#x27;s middle name, Albert, is after his paternal grandfather. However, in &quot;The Growing Pains of Adrian Mole&quot;, it is stated that his name was Arnold, and as Arthur in &quot;Weapons of Mass Destruction&quot;. However, he is simply called Grandad Mole. Adrian&#x27;s maternal grandparents, the Sugdens, have never had their names revealed, although Pauline has two brothers, Dennis and Pete. Dennis married a woman called Marcia, and they had a son called Maurice, and Pete married a woman called Yvonne, who had died. Grandma Sugden had died twenty years previously, as of &quot;The Lost Diaries&quot;. Adrian&#x27;s aunt, Susan Mole, appears in most – if not all – of the books. Susan is a lesbian and prison officer at Holloway Prison. In earlier books, she is dating a woman called Gloria, but later is married to another woman called Amanda.

===Adrian&#x27;s three children===
*Glenn Bott-Mole, son of Sharon Bott, whom Adrian knew at school and had an affair with as a young man. Sharon represents the underclass of British society. Glenn moves in with his father and it is revealed the boy has a lot of respect for him when Adrian sees the cover of his diary. He eventually joins the army and at the end of the last book is expecting a baby with his fiancée, Finley-Rose.
*William Mole, the son of his first wife JoJo, a Nigerian princess. She divorces Adrian and moves back home. Eventually William joins her, changing his forename to Wole to make it sound more African.
*Grace Pauline &quot;Gracie&quot; Mole, the daughter of his second wife Daisy (née Flowers), a smart, successful PR career woman who resembles Nigella Lawson. Eventually she leaves him during his cancer episode for a thick aristocrat.

===Friends===
==Final volumes==
Production of sequels was interrupted by Townsend&#x27;s declining health. At the time &quot;Adrian Mole – The Weapons of Mass Destruction&quot; was published in 2004, Townsend stated it would be the last Adrian Mole volume. However, in an interview on Leicester hospital station Radio Fox on 5 June 2008, Townsend said that she was in fact writing a new Mole book entitled &quot;The Prostrate Years&quot;, which was released in 2009. In October 2009 the &quot;Leicester Mercury&quot; featured an interview with Townsend where she discussed the new Mole book and her plans for future works.

In 2011, Townsend published a short Adrian Mole piece that tied into the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton. A very brief piece in which Adrian gave advice to writers followed in 2012. These are the last Adrian Mole works published in Townsend&#x27;s lifetime, and the last original Mole stories to date.

In a 2013 interview, Townsend discussed her intention to wrap up the series in two further volumes, but acknowledged her declining health might make this plan impossible.

Townsend died on 10 April 2014. Her British publisher said the writer had been working on a new Adrian Mole story at the time of her death. The book, which had the working title &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot;, was due for publication later in 2014. A spokesman for Michael Joseph said: &quot;We can confirm that Sue was in the middle of writing the book. Her editor had seen what she describes as &#x27;a few wonderful pages&#x27;. It was supposed to be out this autumn and we are very sad that we won&#x27;t be able to show it to the world.&quot;

===Timeline===
==Other media==
*The books had three television adaptations. The first, &quot;The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13¾&quot;, was made by Thames Television for the ITV network and broadcast between 16 September and 21 October 1985. The series featured a theme song &quot;Profoundly in Love With Pandora&quot; by Ian Dury and the Blockheads and starred Gian Sammarco as Adrian Mole with Julie Walters playing his mother and Lindsey Stagg as Pandora Braithwaite. The sequel, &quot;The Growing Pains of Adrian Mole&quot; was broadcast between 5 January and 9 February 1987 with Lulu replacing Julie Walters as Adrian&#x27;s mother. &quot;Adrian Mole: The Cappuccino Years&quot; was broadcast on BBC One between 2 February and 9 March 2001, starring Stephen Mangan as Adrian Mole, Alison Steadman as Pauline Mole and Helen Baxendale as Pandora Braithwaite.
*The character also featured in several radio series, such as &quot;Pirate Radio Four&quot; in 1985.
*A stage adaptation was written by Sue Townsend in 1984 of the first book – &quot;The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13¾: The Play&quot; with music and lyrics by Ken Howard and Alan Blaikley. It starred Simon Schatzberger as Adrian Mole and Sheila Steafel as Pauline Mole. It was first performed at Phoenix Arts, Leicester and went to Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre, London in December 1984.
*The first two books were adapted into computer adventure games by Level 9 Computing in the 1980s.
*A theatrical adaptation has been performed in many parts of the world, e.g. by the Roo Theatre in Australia
*A less well-known chapter of Adrian&#x27;s life was chronicled in a weekly column called &quot;Diary of a Provincial Man&quot;, which ran in &quot;The Guardian&quot; from December 1999 to November 2001. This material was published as &quot;The Lost Diaries of Adrian Mole, 1999-2001&quot;. Set contemporaneously, as all the diaries are, it fills in two of the gap years between &quot;Adrian Mole: The Cappuccino Years&quot; and &quot;Adrian Mole and the Weapons of Mass Destruction&quot;. Adrian spends this period living on a crime-ridden council estate with his sons, has an on-off romance with a woman named Pamela Pigg, and temporarily works in a lay-by trailer cafe. He befriends yet another pensioner who subsequently dies, and has a brief infatuation with his male therapist (which he insists is wholly spiritual, not homosexual). The series includes comment on the petrol crisis of 2000, the 9/11 attacks and the War on Terrorism. Adrian&#x27;s illegitimate half-brother Brett Mole, born on 5 August 1982, is reintroduced as a 19-year-old; he is an athletic, popular, confident, promiscuous, super-intelligent Oxford undergraduate, already a published poet and TV documentarian – in short, the person Adrian always wanted to be. Brett&#x27;s mediocre older sibling soon comes to regard him with envious loathing. In what was apparently supposed to be a retrospectively-written preface to the re-published Diaries, Mole notes their re-publication in novel-form and suggests that Townsend is impersonating him and profiting from his writings. He also claims that his life is still not as happy as he would like, but &#x27;that is another story&#x27; – suggesting that there is another diary to come. This series of diaries is not normally considered as canonical.
*To mark the royal wedding between Prince William and Catherine Middleton, Sue Townsend wrote an exclusive Adrian Mole story for the Observer in 2011.
*An obscure chapter of Adrian&#x27;s life appeared in the Christmas 1994 edition of the &quot;Radio Times&quot;. Titled &quot;Mole Cooks his Goose&quot; it covered a stay by Adrian and Jojo at his mother&#x27;s house over Christmas. It has never been republished.
*A new stage musical adaptation by Jake Brunger and Pippa Cleary opened at Leicester&#x27;s Curve in March 2015. Townsend had been working with the writers on the project at the time of her death.

==Parodies==
&quot;Private Eye&quot; parodied the books with their &quot;The Secret Diary of John Major, age 47¾&quot;, in which Major was portrayed as naïve and childish, keeping lists of his enemies in a Rymans Notebook called his &quot;Bastards Book&quot;, and featuring &quot;my wife Norman&quot; and &quot;Mr Dr Mawhinney&quot; as recurring characters. In addition, Adrian Plass&#x27;s novel &quot;The Sacred Diary of Adrian Aged 37¾&quot; and his autobiography &quot;The Growing Up Pains of Adrian Plass&quot; parody the titles of two of the Mole books.

<text>Marilyn Hacker (born November 27, 1942) is an American poet, translator and critic. She is Professor of English emerita at the City College of New York.

Her books of poetry include &quot;Presentation Piece&quot; (1974), which won the National Book Award, &quot;Love, Death, and the Changing of the Seasons&quot; (1986), and &quot;Going Back to the River&quot; (1990). In 2003, Hacker won the Willis Barnstone Translation Prize. In 2009, she subsequently won the PEN Award for Poetry in Translation for &quot;King of a Hundred Horsemen&quot; by Marie Étienne, which also garnered the first Robert Fagles Translation Prize from the National Poetry Series. In 2010, she received the PEN/Voelcker Award for Poetry. She was shortlisted for the 2013 PEN Award for Poetry in Translation for her translation of &quot;Tales of a Severed Head&quot; by Rachida Madani.

== Early life and education ==
Hacker was born and raised in Bronx, New York, the only child of Jewish immigrant parents. Her father was a management consultant and her mother a teacher. Hacker attended the Bronx High School of Science, where she met her future husband Samuel R. Delany, who would become a well-known science-fiction writer. She enrolled at New York University at the age of fifteen (B.A., 1964). Three years later, Hacker and Delany traveled from New York to Detroit, Michigan and were married. In &quot;The Motion of Light in Water&quot;, Delany said they married in Detroit because of age-of-consent laws and because he was African-American and she was Caucasian: &quot;there were only two states in the union where we could legally wed. The closest one was Michigan.&quot; They settled in New York&#x27;s East Village. Their daughter, Iva Hacker-Delany, was born in 1974. Hacker and Delany, after being separated for many years, were divorced in 1980, but remain friends. Hacker identifies as lesbian, and Delany has identified as a gay man since adolescence.

In the 1960s and 1970s, Hacker worked mostly in commercial editing. She graduated with a bachelor of arts degree in Romance Languages in 1964.

== Career ==

Hacker&#x27;s first publication was in Cornell University&#x27;s &quot;Epoch&quot;. After moving to London in 1970, she found an audience through the pages of &quot;The London Magazine&quot; and &quot;Ambit&quot;. She and her husband edited the magazine &quot;Quark: A Quarterly of Speculative Fiction&quot; (4 issues; 1970–71). Early recognition came for her when Richard Howard, then editor of the &quot;New American Review&quot;, accepted three of Hacker&#x27;s poems for publication.

In 1974, when she was thirty-one, &quot;Presentation Piece&quot; was published by The Viking Press. The book was a Lamont Poetry Selection of the Academy of American Poets and won the annual National Book Award for Poetry. &quot;Winter Numbers&quot;, which details the loss of many of her friends to AIDS and her own struggle with breast cancer, garnered a Lambda Literary Award and &quot;The Nation&quot;&#x27;s Lenore Marshall Poetry Prize. Her &quot;Selected Poems 1965-1990&quot; received the 1996 Poets&#x27; Prize, and &quot;Squares and Courtyards&quot; won the 2001 Audre Lorde Award. She received an Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 2004.

Hacker often employs strict poetic forms in her poetry: for example, in &quot;Love, Death, and the Changing of the Seasons&quot;, which is a verse novel in sonnets. She is also recognized as a master of &quot;French forms&quot; such as the rondeau and villanelle.

In 1990 she became the first full-time editor of the Kenyon Review, a position she held until 1994. She was noted for &quot;broaden[ing] the quarterly&#x27;s scope to include more minority and marginalized viewpoints.&quot; In a 2005 essay discussing the theme of food and drink in Hacker&#x27;s poetry, scholar Mary Biggs describes her work as frequently referring to three &quot;interlinked, paradoxical themes: (1) love and sex; (2) travel, exile, diaspora-counterpoised with family, community, home; and (3) the eternal and, for her, eternally positive association of women with nurturance and with homemaking in the broadest sense.&quot;

Hacker served as a Chancellor of the Academy of American Poets from 2008 to 2014.

Hacker lives in New York and Paris and has retired from teaching at the City College of New York and the CUNY Graduate Center.

Though not a character, a poem of Hacker&#x27;s is reprinted in &quot;Heavenly Breakfast,&quot; Delany&#x27;s memoir of a Greenwich Village commune in 1967; in Delany&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;The Motion of Light in Water&quot;; and her prose and incidents about her appear in his journals, &quot;The Journals of Samuel R. Delany: In Search of Silence&quot;, Volume 1, 1957–1969, edited by Kenneth R. James (Wesleyan University Press, 2017).

Hacker was a judge for the 2012 Hippocrates Prize for Poetry and Medicine. In 2013, she was inducted into the New York Writers Hall of Fame. In 2014, she published a collaboration with a Palestinian-American poet, Deema Shehabi, written in the style of a Japanese renga, a form of alternating call and answer. The book, &quot;Diaspo/renga: a collaboration in alternating renga&quot; explores the emotional journey of living in exile.&lt;ref name=&quot;Diaspo/Renga&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of the 2015 collection &quot;A Stranger&#x27;s Mirror&quot;, Carol Muske-Dukes comments that Hacker has not received her &quot;due as one of the most extraordinary innovative poets writing today.&quot; In a laudatory review of Hacker&#x27;s 2019 collection &quot;Blazons&quot;, A. M. Juster states that &quot;there is no poet writing in English with a better claim for the Nobel Prize in Literature than Marilyn Hacker.&quot;

<doc id="375826" wikidata="Q194259" url="?curid=375826" title="Mohorovičić discontinuity">
<text>The Mohorovičić discontinuity ( ; )usually called the Moho discontinuity, Moho boundary, or just Mohois the boundary between the crust and the mantle of Earth. It is defined by the distinct change in velocity of seismic waves as they pass through changing densities of rock.

The Moho lies almost entirely within the lithosphere (the hard outer layer of the Earth, including the crust). Only beneath mid-ocean ridges does it define the lithosphere–asthenosphere boundary (the depth at which the mantle becomes significantly ductile). The Mohorovičić discontinuity is below the ocean floor, and beneath typical continental crusts, with an average of .

Named after the pioneering Croatian seismologist Andrija Mohorovičić, the Moho separates both the oceanic crust and continental crust from the underlying mantle. The Mohorovičić discontinuity was first identified in 1909 by Mohorovičić, when he observed that seismograms from shallow-focus earthquakes had two sets of P-waves and S-waves, one set that followed a direct path near the Earth&#x27;s surface and the other refracted by a high-velocity medium.

==Nature and seismology==
The Moho marks the transition in composition between the Earth&#x27;s crust and the lithospheric mantle. Immediately above the Moho, the velocities of primary seismic waves (P-waves) are consistent with those through basalt (6.7–7.2 km/s), and below they are similar to those through peridotite or dunite (7.6–8.6 km/s). This increase of approximately 1 km/s corresponds to a distinct change in material as the waves pass through the Earth, and is commonly accepted as the lower limit of the Earth&#x27;s crust. The Moho is characterized by a transition zone of up to 500 meters. Ancient Moho zones are exposed above-ground in numerous ophiolites around the world.
Beginning in the 1980s, geologists became aware that the Moho does not always coincide with the crust-mantle boundary defined by composition. Xenoliths (lower crust and upper mantle rock brought to the surface by volcanic eruptions) and seismic-reflection data showed that, away from continental cratons, the transition between crust and mantle is marked by basaltic intrusions and may be up to 20 km thick. The Moho may lie well below the crust-mantle boundary and care must be used in interpreting the structure of the crust from seismic data alone.

Serpentinization of mantle rock below slowly spreading mid-ocean ridges can also increase the depth to the Moho, since serpentinization lowers seismic wave velocities.

==History==
Croatian seismologist Andrija Mohorovičić is credited with discovering and defining the Moho. In 1909, he was examining data from a local earthquake in Zagreb when he observed two distinct sets of P-waves and S-waves propagating out from the focus of the earthquake. Mohorovičić knew that waves caused by earthquakes travel at velocities proportional to the density of the material carrying them. As a result of this information, he theorized that the second set of waves could only be caused by a sharp transition in density in the Earth&#x27;s crust, which could account for such a dramatic change in wave velocity. Using velocity data from the earthquake, he was able to calculate the depth of the Moho to be approximately 54 km, which was supported by subsequent seismological studies.

The Moho has played a large role in the fields of geology and earth science for well over a century. By observing the Moho&#x27;s refractive nature and how it affects the speed of P-waves, scientists were able to theorize about the earth&#x27;s composition. These early studies gave rise to modern seismology.

In the early 1960s, Project Mohole was an attempt to drill to the Moho from deep-ocean regions. After initial success in establishing deep-ocean drilling, the project suffered from political and scientific opposition, mismanagement, and cost overruns, and it was cancelled in 1966.

== Exploration ==
Reaching the discontinuity by drilling remains an important scientific objective. Soviet scientists at the Kola Superdeep Borehole pursued the goal from 1970 until 1992. They reached a depth of , the world&#x27;s deepest hole, before abandoning the project. One proposal considers a rock-melting radionuclide-powered capsule with a heavy tungsten needle that can propel itself down to the Moho discontinuity and explore Earth&#x27;s interior near it and in the upper mantle. The Japanese project Chikyu Hakken (&quot;Earth Discovery&quot;) also aims to explore in this general area with the drilling ship, &quot;Chikyū&quot;, built for the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP).

Plans called for the drill-ship &quot;JOIDES Resolution&quot; to sail from Colombo in Sri Lanka in late 2015 and to head for the Atlantis Bank, a promising location in the southwestern Indian Ocean on the Southwest Indian Ridge, to attempt to drill an initial bore hole to a depth of approximately 1.5 kilometres.
The attempt did not even reach 1.3 km, but researchers hope to further their investigations at a later date.

<doc id="375828" wikidata="Q6834335" url="?curid=375828" title="Michael Shea (American author)">
<text>Michael Shea (July 3, 1946 – February 16, 2014) was an American fantasy, horror, and science fiction author. His novel &quot;Nifft the Lean&quot; won the World Fantasy Award, as did his novella &quot;Growlimb&quot;.

==Life and work==

Shea was born to Irish parents in Los Angeles in 1946. There he frequented Venice Beach and the Baldwin Hills for their wildlife. He attended UCLA and Berkeley and hitch-hiked twice across the US and Canada. At a hotel in Juneau, Alaska, Shea chanced on a battered book from the lobby shelves, &quot;The Eyes of the Overworld&quot; by Jack Vance (1966). Four years later, after a brief first marriage and one year hitch-hiking through France and Spain, he wrote a novel in homage to Vance, who graciously declined to share the advance offered by DAW Books. It was Shea&#x27;s first publication, &quot;A Quest for Simbilis&quot; (1974), and an authorized sequel to Vance&#x27;s two Dying Earth books then extant. ISFDB notes that it &quot;became non-canonic&quot; in 1983 when Vance &quot;continued ... &quot;The Eyes&quot; ... in a different direction.&quot;

Subsequently, Shea ranged all over the L.A. Basin, painting houses and teaching English as a second language to adults by night. In 1978 he met his second wife, artist and author Lynn Cesar. They had two children: Adele and Jacob. Shea moved to the Bay Area where (prior to 1987) he held a variety of occupations, including instructor of languages, construction laborer, and night clerk in a Mission District flophouse.

In 1979 Shea published the story &quot;The Angel of Death&quot; (&quot;Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot;, Aug 1979). This was followed in 1980 by &quot;The Autopsy&quot; (&quot;Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot;, Dec 1980), a story nominated for both the Hugo Award and Nebula Award.

His next published work was the novella &quot;Polyphemus&quot; (&quot;Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot;, Aug 1981). His story &quot;The Frog&quot; appeared in &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot; (Apr 1982). Shea was quiet for a few years but re-emerged with his second book, a collection of four linked novellas called &quot;Nifft the Lean&quot; (1982). &quot;Nifft&quot; showed that Shea had developed the exotic style of Vance and Clark Ashton Smith, plus the ingenuity of Fritz Leiber&#x27;s Gray Mouser stories, to produce an extravagant quest novel. It won the 1983 World Fantasy Award as year&#x27;s best novel.

Shea followed up with &quot;The Color out of Time&quot; (1984), a work influenced by the Cthulhu Mythos, and &quot;In Yana, the Touch of Undying&quot; (1985), about a vain opportunist&#x27;s search for immortality in a land of fable. &quot;Polyphemus&quot; (1987) is a collection of deft science fiction and horror stories published by Arkham House.

Shea continued the adventures of Nifft in &quot;The Mines of Behemoth&quot; (Baen, 1997), serialised one year earlier in the Algis Budrys magazine &quot;Tomorrow Speculative Fiction&quot;, and in a novel &quot;The A&#x27;rak&quot; (2000). The Nifft stories are &quot;sword-and-sorcery&quot; modeled on Jack Vance, notable for their imaginative depiction of the world of demons and their blend of horror, flowery diction, and occasionally crude humor.

Shea&#x27;s work overlaps the science fiction and fantasy genres, e.g., thematic use of demons and aliens that act as endoparasites. Shea&#x27;s interest in Lovecraft&#x27;s Cthulhu Mythos continued throughout his career. &quot;Copping Squid and Other Mythos Tales&quot; (2010) is a collection of such tales.

Shea died unexpectedly on February 16, 2014.

In an overview of Shea&#x27;s work, Chris Gilmore praised Shea&#x27;s fiction, stating &quot;Shea has a racy line in grue and writes with energy, imagination and precision&quot;, and expressed particular admiration for the stories in &quot;Polyphemus&quot;. However, Gilmore also took issue with Shea&#x27;s use of gigantic monsters in books such as &quot;A Quest for Simbilis&quot; and &quot;Nifft the Lean&quot;, arguing that the use of such creatures vitiated Shea&#x27;s ability to describe scenes in detail. Gilmore also criticised Shea&#x27;s story &quot;The Pearls of the Vampire Queen&quot; as being excessively violent, arguing that its protagonists kill one person and seriously injure another when the story did not require them to perform such actions.

Reviewing &quot;The Incomplete Nifft&quot;, Elizabeth Hand declared that &quot;not even Bosch could capture the sheer, obsessive teemingness of Shea&#x27;s world. . . . In their picaresque and unrelenting strangeness, Shea&#x27;s tales evoke Jack Vance and Lord Dunsany, Clark Ashton Smith&#x27;s &quot;Zothique&quot; tales, as well as &quot;The Worm Ouroboros&quot;; but what his work most reminds me of is David Lindsay&#x27;s &quot;A Voyage to Arcturus&quot;, a book which had always struck me as being sui generis. Having read and delighted in &quot;The Incompleat Nifft&quot;, I must create a new category for this beautiful, terrifying work, part sword-and-sorcery, part season in hell. Call it Shea generis.&quot;

On his list of &quot;The 13 Most Terrifying Horror Stories&quot;, T. E. D. Klein placed Shea&#x27;s story &quot;The Autopsy&quot; at number eleven.

==Adaptations==
On 26th October 2022, a dramatization of “The Autopsy” streamed on Netflix as the third episode of “Guillermo do Toro’s Cabinet of Curiosities.”

<doc id="375832" wikidata="Q8037010" url="?curid=375832" title="Worshipful Company of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales">
<text>The Worshipful Company of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales is one of the livery companies of the City of London. They were one of the earliest of the modern livery companies promoted by the Court of Aldermen from the 1970s, receiving a Grant of Letters Patent (i.e. converting from an unincorporated Guild to a livery company) in 1977 and receiving a Royal Charter in 2012. The Company is complementary to, and supported by, the Institute of Chartered Accountants (ICAEW). It promotes &quot;honourable practice&quot; of accounting and awards prizes to students in the field. It also supports general charities. The company ranks eighty-sixth in the order of precedence for livery companies. Its motto is &quot;True and Fair&quot;.

== Founding and History ==
Formal letters patent for the creation of the livery company were presented on 25 July 1977 by the lord mayor of London. Its first master was James M. Keith, member of the city&#x27;s Court of Common Council and chief commoner for 1976–1977.

It was one of several companies formed in the 1970s, when concerns were raised that existing livery companies had few connections to the modern financial services industry in London.

The Royal Charter was granted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2012. The Court had written to the Privy Council as far back as 1978 on the subject of a charter, but were advised against &quot;too hasty an approach to the question.&quot; The application process was re-started in 2008 and, after a number of changes to the Company&#x27;s Ordinances (including adding the ability to acquire land, clarifying that membership of the ICAEW was only required at the time of joining, and the abolition of Freedom by Apprenticeship), it was finally approved by the Court of Aldermen in 2011. The Charter was formally presented by the Lord Mayor, Alderman David Wootton, to the Master, Sir John Stuttard, at a banquet in the Great Hall of the Guildhall on 10 September 2012.

== Membership ==
Membership is open to ICAEW Chartered Accountants, who initially join as Freemen. The Company’s Royal Charter sets a maximum of 350 Liverymen and unlimited Freeman.

As of December 1992, the company had 100 members. At the time, former master Richard Wilkes told the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, &quot;We do not have a large endowment. Instead of money, we&#x27;ve got talent.&quot; 

== Charitable activities ==
The charitable arm of the Company supports education in literacy and numeracy for the disadvantaged, causes associated with the accountancy profession or the City, and more generally causes which members are personally involved in where a grant would make a material difference.

The charity made 44 grants to deserving causes in 2022-23, totalling £175,000. These include:

* Beyond Food, who provide kitchen-based training for people whose lives have unravelled, especially prisoners.
* Mansion House scholarships, funding mostly overseas students to study a UK Master&#x27;s Degree in a Financial or related subject.
* City Harvest London, helping fund the Livery Food Initiative truck which redistributes potentially waste food to vulnerable Londoners.
* The Youth Ventures Programme by the Queen&#x27;s Commonwealth Trust, which supports young leaders and their social impact organisations.
* The GASP Motor Project, which provides motor mechanic training to disadvantaged young people in Surrey.
* The Financial Smarties Programme by The Community Hub in Hackney, which gives financial literacy training to young women.

In 1992, the Worshipful Company of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales launched &quot;Chartered Accountants in the Community&quot;, a programme which placed senior accountants onto the management committees of charities. The scheme aimed to place 20 to 30 attachments a year, with a focus on providing advice and professional expertise to charities, rather than day-to-day bookkeeping. The livery company had previously focused on making donations to support overseas training and rewarding student achievement.

== Fellowship and Dinners ==
In July 2021, &quot;The Telegraph&quot; reported that up to a dozen business leaders were boycotting a dinner banquet at Mansion House hosted by the Worshipful Company of Chartered Accountants, because guests were being required to wear face masks and use NHS Test and Trace QR codes to enter the event.

== Armed Forces Affiliations ==
In common with all Livery Companies, there are links with the UK Armed forces, specifically:

* The Special Boat Service
* 47 Squadron, RAF
* Britannia Royal Naval College, Dartmouth
* Harrow and Wembley Sea Cadets
* Honourable Artillery Company

In general senior officers of these units will attend Livery events and members of the Court will visit the units each year. The Company provides financial support for the welfare of personnel and families plus the provision of non-military equipment. The Sea Cadets are supported with funding and prizes, and in turn provide a carpet guard for the annual banquet and join the Company&#x27;s float in the Lord Mayor&#x27;s Show. Pikemen and Musketeers from the HAC form an honour guard at high profile Company events.

== Financial Services Group of Livery Companies ==
The company is a member of the Financial Services Group of Livery Companies, the other 11 members of which are the Worshipful Companies of Actuaries, Arbitrators, International Bankers, Chartered Secretaries and Administrators, Insurers, Information Technologists, City of London Solicitors, Management Consultants, Marketors, Tax Advisers, and World Traders. Representatives meet quarterly to co-ordinate the efforts of members in promoting the City of London financial and business services sector, supporting the Lord Mayor, the Court of Aldermen, and the City of London Corporation.

<text>The Court of King&#x27;s Bench (or Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench during the reign of a Queen) was one of the senior courts of common law in Ireland. It was a mirror of the Court of King&#x27;s Bench in England. The Lord Chief Justice was the most senior judge in the court, and the second most senior Irish judge under English rule and later when Ireland became part of the United Kingdom. Additionally, for a brief period between 1922 and 1924, the Lord Chief Justice of Ireland was the most senior judge in the Irish Free State.

==History of the position==

The office was created during the Lordship of Ireland (1171–1536) and continued in existence under the Kingdom of Ireland (1536–1800) and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Prior to the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Ireland) 1877, the Lord Chief Justice presided over the Court of King&#x27;s/Queen&#x27;s Bench, and as such ranked foremost amongst the judges sitting at common law. After 1877, the Lord Chief Justice assumed the presidency of the Queen&#x27;s Bench Division of the new High Court of Justice, which sat permanently in the Four Courts in Dublin.

Thomas Lefroy, later Lord Chief Justice of Ireland (LCJ 1852–1866), was used by Jane Austen as the model for her &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; character &quot;Mr. Darcy&quot;. Lefroy and Austen had had a romance in their youths. Other prominent Lord Chief Justices of Ireland include Lord Whiteside (LCJ 1866–1876), who as a Queen&#x27;s Counsel had defended Irish nationalist leader Daniel O&#x27;Connell in court, Gerald FitzGerald, 3rd Earl of Desmond, Hugh de Lacy, &quot;Risteárd de Tiúit&quot;, John Doherty, Thomas Marlay, James Ley, Peter O&#x27;Brien, and James Henry Mussen Campbell, 1st Baron Glenavy (LCJ 1916–1918, later Chairman of Seanad Éireann and grandfather of the satirist Patrick Campbell). One Lord Chief Justice, Lord Kilwarden, was killed by a crowd during Robert Emmet&#x27;s 1803 rebellion.

==Abolition of the position==

The abolition of the position of &quot;Lord Chief Justice of Ireland&quot; was originally envisaged in a draft of the Government of Ireland Bill 1920. The Bill originally proposed that the &quot;Lord Chief Justice of Ireland&quot; would become the &quot;Lord Chief Justice of Southern Ireland&quot;. However, the then incumbent, The Rt. Hon. Sir Thomas Molony, 1st Bt., vigorously lobbied for the right to continue to hold the title even after the Bill was passed. Ultimately, his arguments were at least in part accepted: The Act, in its transitional provisions, provided that while he would in effect be the first Lord Chief Justice of Southern Ireland, his title remained that of &quot;Lord Chief Justice of Ireland&quot;, although this was a transitional provision and was not a right to be enjoyed by his successors.

Subsequently, the highest-ranking judicial posting in Ireland, that of Lord Chancellor of Ireland, was abolished in December 1922. This left the office of the Lord Chief Justice of Ireland as the most senior judge in the Irish Free State but not for very long. The Constitution of the Irish Free State adopted in December 1922 clearly envisaged the early establishment of new courts for the nascent state and the abolition of the position of the Lord Chief Justice of Ireland. However, this only took place when the Courts of Justice Act 1924 was finally adopted. Under that Act, the position of the Chief Justice of the Irish Free State superseded the position of Lord Chief Justice of Ireland as the highest judicial office in the Irish Free State.

In what became Northern Ireland, the position was superseded by the position of Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland.

<doc id="375839" wikidata="Q197044" url="?curid=375839" title="Zeuxis (painter)">
<text>Zeuxis (; ) (of Heraclea) was a late 5th-century- early 4th-century BCE Greek artist famed for his ability to create images that appeared highly realistic. None of his works survive, but anecdotes about Zeuxis&#x27; art and life have been referenced often in the history and literature of art and in art theory.

Much of the information about Zeuxis comes from Pliny the Elder&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot;, but his work is also discussed by Xenophon and Aristotle. One of the most famous stories about Zeuxis centers on an artistic competition with the artist Parrhasius to prove which artist could create a greater illusion of nature. Zeuxis, Timanthes and Parrhasius were painters who belonged to the Ionian School of painting. The Ionian School flourished during the 4th-century BCE.

==Life and work==
Zeuxis was born in Heraclea in 464 BCE, probably Heraclea Lucania, in the present-day region of Basilicata in the southeastern &quot;boot&quot; of Italy. He may have studied with Demophilus of Himera (Sicily), or with Neseus of Thasos (an island in the northern Aegean Sea), and/or with the Greek painter Appollodorus.

He was active across the ancient Greek world from Magna Graecia to Ephesus, to Macedonia, Samos and to Athens where his greatest number of works were made. The “Eros” of the temple of Aphrodite and the “Penelope” were some of his first works. Records cite his notable works as &quot;Helen&quot;, &quot;Zeus Enthroned&quot; and &quot;The Infant Hercules Strangling the Serpents&quot;. He also painted an assembly of gods, Eros crowned with roses, Alcmene, Menelaus, an athlete, Pan, Marsyas chained, and an old woman. King Archelaus I of Macedon employed Zeuxis to decorate the palace of his new capital Pella with a picture of Pan. Most of his works went to Rome and to Byzantium, but disappeared during the time of Pausanias.
Zeuxis was an innovative Greek painter. Although his paintings have not survived, historical records state they were known for their realism, small scale, novel subject matter, and independent format. His technique created volumetric illusion through manipulating light and shadow, a change from the usual method of filling in shapes with flat colors. Preferring small-scale panels to murals, Zeuxis also introduced genre subjects (such as still life) into painting. He contributed to the composite method of composition and may have originated an approach to, and thus influenced the concept of the ideal form of the nude, as described by art historian Kenneth Clark. As the story goes, according to Cicero, Zeuxis could not find a woman beautiful enough to pose as Helen of Troy, the most beautiful woman in the world, so he selected the finest features of five different models of the city of Croton to create a composite image of ideal beauty. 

==Painting contest==
According to the &quot;Naturalis Historia&quot; by Pliny the Elder, Zeuxis and his contemporary Parrhasius (of Ephesus and later Athens) staged a contest to determine the greater artist. When Zeuxis unveiled his painting of grapes, they appeared so real that birds flew down to peck at them. But when Parrhasius, whose painting was concealed behind a curtain, asked Zeuxis to pull aside that curtain, the curtain itself turned out to be a painted illusion. Parrhasius won, and Zeuxis said, &quot;I have deceived the birds, but Parrhasius has deceived Zeuxis.&quot; This story was commonly referred to in the 18th and 19th century art theory to promote spatial illusion in painting. A similar anecdote says that Zeuxis once drew a boy holding grapes, and when birds, once again, tried to peck them, he was extremely displeased, stating that he must have painted the boy with less skill, since the birds would have feared to approach otherwise.

==Death==

According to the Roman grammarian Festus, Zeuxis died laughing at a picture of an old woman he had just painted.

The legend is mentioned in Karel van Mander&#x27;s &quot;Schilder-boeck&quot; (1604) and is known by later artists who alluded to the story in their self portraits, such as Rembrandt&#x27;s &quot;Self-Portrait as Zeuxis Laughing&quot; (c. 1662), Aert de Gelder&#x27;s &quot;Self-Portrait as Zeuxis&quot; (1685), and possibly Jean-Étienne Liotard&#x27;s &quot;Self-Portrait Laughing&quot; (c. 1770).

==Literary References==

Zeuxis is briefly mentioned in the preface of Don Quixote by Cervantes:
Of all this there will be nothing in my book, for I have nothing to quote in the margin or to note at the end, and still less do I know what authors I follow in it, to place them at the beginning, as all do, under the letters A, B, C, beginning with Aristotle and ending with Xenophon, or Zoilus, or Zeuxis, though one was a slanderer and the other a painter.
and is mentioned by Mark Twain in The Innocents Abroad:
As we turned and moved again through the temple, I wished that the illustrious men who had sat in it in the remote ages could visit it again and reveal themselves to our curious eyes—Plato, Aristotle, Demosthenes, Socrates, Phocion, Pythagoras, Euclid, Pindar, Xenophon, Herodotus, Praxiteles and Phidias, Zeuxis the painter.

<doc id="375856" wikidata="Q1362267" url="?curid=375856" title="First Sea Lord">
<text>The First Sea Lord, officially known as the First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff (1SL/CNS) is a statutory position in the British Armed Forces, usually held by an admiral. As the highest-ranking officer to serve in the Royal Navy, the chief is the principal military advisor on matters pertaining to the navy and a deputy to the Secretary of State for Defence. In a separate capacity, the CNS is a member of the Chiefs of Staff Committee and, thereby, a military advisor to the National Security Council, the prime minister and the monarch. The First Sea Lord is typically the highest-ranking officer on active duty of the Royal Navy unless the Chief of the Defence Staff is a naval officer. Admiral Ben Key was appointed First Sea Lord in November 2021.

Originally titled the &quot;Senior Naval Lord to the Board of Admiralty&quot; when the post was created in 1689, the office was re-styled First Naval Lord in 1771. The concept of a professional &quot;First Naval Lord&quot; was introduced in 1805, and the title of the office was changed to First Sea Lord on the appointment of Sir John &quot;Jackie&quot; Fisher in 1904. Since 1923, the First Sea Lord has been a member of the Chiefs of Staff Committee; he now sits on the Defence Council and the Admiralty Board.

== Responsibilities ==
The First Sea Lord is the professional head of the Royal Navy and a member of the Defence Council. He is responsible to Secretary of State for the fighting effectiveness, efficiency and morale of the Naval Service. As a member of the Defence Council, the First Sea Lord supports the Secretary of State in the management and direction of the Armed Forces through prerogative and statutory powers. As a member of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, he advises CDS on maritime strategy and policy. He has a collective responsibility for providing strategic direction to the department, managing performance and ensuring that defence delivers the required outputs.

==History==
Lords Admiral were appointed from the 15th century; they were later styled &quot;Lords High Admiral&quot; until the 18th century, and Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty from the 17th century, as the governors of the English and later British Royal Navy. From 1683 to 1684, there were seven paid Commissioners, and one unpaid supernumerary Commissioner. The number varied between five and seven Commissioners through the 18th century. The standing of all the Commissioners was in theory the same, although the First Commissioner or First Lord exercised an ascendancy over his colleagues from an early date.

The generally recognized office of Senior Naval Lord to the Board of Admiralty was established on 8 March 1689, with the first incumbent being Admiral Arthur Herbert; he was also First Lord of the Admiralty. On 20 January 1690 Admiral Herbert was succeeded by Admiral Sir John Chicheley under First Lord of Admiralty Thomas Herbert, 8th Earl of Pembroke.

On 22 May 1702 the Board of Admiralty ceased control of naval affairs and was replaced by the Lord Admiral&#x27;s Council. The previous office of Senior Naval Lord was replaced by a Senior Member to the Lords Admiral Council; he was usually a serving naval officer of admiral rank and was the &quot;Chief Naval Adviser&quot; to the Lord Admiral. This lasted until 8 November 1709, when the Board of Admiralty resumed control of Naval Affairs and the post of Senior Naval Lord was resumed.

On 2 February 1771 the office of Senior Naval Lord was renamed to First Naval Lord. The first post holder was Vice-Admiral Augustus Hervey; he first served under First Lord of the Admiralty John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich. In 1805, for the first time, specific functions were assigned to each of the &#x27;Naval&#x27; Lords, who were described as &#x27;Professional&#x27; Lords, leaving to the &#x27;Civil&#x27; Lords the routine business of signing documents. On 2 May 1827 the Board of Admiralty once again ceased control of Naval Affairs and was replaced, until 1828, by a Lord High Admirals Council.

The title of the First Naval Lord was changed to First Sea Lord on the appointment of Sir Jackie Fisher in 1904. In 1917 the First Sea Lord was re-styled First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff. From 1923 onward, the First Sea Lord was a member of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, and from 1923 to 1959, in rotation with the representatives of the other services (the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and Chief of the Air Staff), he served as the chairman of that committee and head of all British armed forces. The title was retained when the Board of Admiralty was abolished in 1964 and the Board&#x27;s functions were integrated into the Ministry of Defence.

Under the current organisation, the First Sea Lord sits on the Defence Council, the Admiralty Board and the Navy Board.

Since 2012, the flagship of the First Sea Lord has nominally been the ship of the line HMS &quot;Victory&quot;, which used to be Lord Nelson&#x27;s flagship.

==Appointees==
The following table lists all those who have held the post of First Sea Lord or its preceding positions. Ranks and honours are as at the completion of their tenure:

==In fiction==
In John Buchan&#x27;s novel &quot;The Thirty-Nine Steps&quot; (1915), the First Sea Lord is named as Lord Alloa, an impostor whom Richard Hannay recognizes at a meeting as a spy and recent pursuer of his. Hannay describes Lord Alloa as recognizable from news pictures for his &quot;beard cut like a spade, the firm fighting mouth, the blunt square nose, and the keen blue eyes...the man, they say, that made the New British Navy&quot;. The real First Sea Lord at the time the story is set (early summer 1914) was Prince Louis of Battenberg, coincidentally also bearded.

<doc id="375859" wikidata="Q8037064" url="?curid=375859" title="Worshipful Company of Marketors">
<text>The Worshipful Company of Marketors is one of the 111 livery companies of the City of London. The company was founded in 1975.

The Marketors&#x27; Company ranks ninetieth in the order of precedence for livery companies. Its church is St Bride&#x27;s Church.

Marketing as a recognised professional skill standing in its own right is relatively new, and the idea for a city guild for senior marketing professionals first came about in 1969. A working party was set up in 1973 and several senior fellows of the Institute of Marketing subsequently helped gain the support of the Court of Aldermen in the City of London for establishment of a guild. Reginald Bowden, chairman of the working party, became Founder Master, serving from 1975 to 1978. On 14 April 1978 letters patent were presented to the Guild of Marketors and it became a livery company. Reginald Bowden was followed as Master by several other members of the initial working party.

The company is governed by a Court of Assistants. Each year the court elects from its ranks a Master together with a Senior, Middle and Junior Warden. The court is responsible for policy, strategy and overall management of the company, and appoints a clerk to manage its day-to-day affairs. The company&#x27;s membership is drawn from senior marketing practitioners and marketing services experts, together with recognised marketing academics.

The company is a member of the Financial Services Group of Livery Companies, the other 11 members of which are the Worshipful Companies of Chartered Accountants, Actuaries, Arbitrators, International Bankers, Chartered Secretaries and Administrators, Insurers, Information Technologists, City of London Solicitors, Management Consultants, Tax Advisers, and World Traders.

== Aims and objectives ==

The mission of the Worshipful Company of Marketors is to be the City livery company for leaders in marketing. The Marketors promote marketing as a force for economic and public benefit, encouraging marketing education and marketing in practice. The company&#x27;s presence in the City of London focuses on the need for marketing principles being at the heart of corporate decision-making within the Square Mile and beyond. Like all livery companies following a tradition that is centuries old, Marketors support the City of London and the mayoralty.

The company aims to promote the benefits of marketing and encourage excellence in marketing practice.

== Charitable work ==

One of the most important roles of all livery companies is their charitable work, and the support and recognition given to education and the achievement of excellence in their profession or craft. More than £40 million is given annually to charities by livery companies. Members of the Marketors are expected to make a modest annual contribution to increase the capital of the Marketors&#x27; Trust from which awards and bursaries can be funded. 

The Marketors’ Charity Marketing Grants Programme, is funded by The Marketors’ Trust, and its aim is to help smaller charities that may have great ideas about marketing campaigns they would like to run but lack the funds to do so.

The trust also makes donations each year to the lord mayor&#x27;s chosen charities and through advice from its Almoners, also provide assistance to members and their dependants who are in need.

As well as contributing financially to good causes, members who have skills and expertise are also encouraged to engage in voluntary outreach work giving practical marketing help and professional advice. 

== Events and activities ==
The Marketors provides a rich and varied programme of formal and social events which are wide-ranging and stimulating, as well as offering a better understanding of many aspects of marketing. 

=== The Great Events ===

Formal occasions which are held in City livery halls or the Mansion House include several annual dinners or luncheons, and a banquet in honour of the lord mayor.
=== Professional and social events ===

There are many professional and social occasions throughout the year, most held in interesting and unusual venues many of which are exclusive to the Marketors.

The company holds a number of marketing focused events, such as lectures and seminars, with the theme of marketing in practice.

== 151 Regiment, St Dunstan&#x27;s College CCF and HMS &quot;St Albans&quot; ==
Following a livery tradition, many companies maintain close supportive links with units of the armed forces and the Marketors adopted 151 (London) Transport Regiment, Royal Logistic Corps. This link with the regiment provides a further interchange of social activities and also opportunities to work with the regiment on exercises. The Marketors have also established an affiliation to St Dunstan&#x27;s College Combined Cadet Force, and to the Royal Navy by way of the Type 23 frigate .
== Thought leadership ==

The Thought Leadership Group (TLG) provides research leadership and promotes discussion and debate between the company, its members, other livery companies, business leaders (especially board members and those operating in the city) and the wider marketing profession. The TLG gives fresh insight into significant issues, especially those likely to have an impact at the board level, whether commercial or not. As a secondary agenda, the TLG takes opportunities to promulgate the basics of good practice to external audiences which lack such knowledge, working with other company committees.

An example of the work the group does is as part of The Tri Livery Digital Media Group alongside the Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers and the Worshipful Company of Information Technologists to produce a yearly seminar with notable speakers and with a specifically digital focus – an area of interest to all three companies. The group is also responsible for the production of reports into matters of topical concern.

<text>Samuel Laman Blanchard (15 May 1804 – 15 February 1845) was a British author and journalist.

==Life==
The son of a painter and glazier, he was born at Great Yarmouth. He was educated at St Olave&#x27;s school, Southwark, and then became clerk to a proctor in Doctors&#x27; Commons. At an early age he developed an interest in literature, contributing dramatic sketches to a paper called &quot;Drama&quot;. For a short time he belonged to a travelling theatre company, but then became a proof-reader in London, and wrote for the &quot;Monthly Magazine&quot;. In 1827 he was made secretary of the Zoological Society, a post he held for three years.

Over-work broke down his strength and, after his wife died in December 1844 of a painful illness, Blanchard entered a depression from which he never recovered. He committed suicide with a razor, and was buried at West Norwood Cemetery.

==Works==
In 1828 he published &quot;Lyric Offerings&quot;, dedicated to Charles Lamb. He had a very varied journalistic experience, editing in succession the &quot;Monthly Magazine&quot;, the &quot;True Sun&quot;, the &quot;Constitutional&quot;, the &quot;Court Journal&quot;, the &quot;Courier&quot;, and &quot;George Cruikshank&#x27;s Omnibus&quot;; and from 1841 until his death he was connected with the &quot;Examiner&quot;.

In 1846 Edward Bulwer-Lytton collected some of his prose-essays under the title &quot;Sketches of Life&quot;, to which a memoir of the author was prefixed. His verse was collected in 1876 by William Blanchard Jerrold.

==Family==
His eldest son was Sidney Laman Blanchard, the author of &quot;Yesterday and To-day in India&quot;.

<text>The Worshipful Company of Actuaries is one of the livery companies of the City of London. The company was founded and became a livery company in 1979, on the same day as the Insurers&#x27; Company. The company supports the actuarial profession by awarding scholarships in the field.

The Actuaries&#x27; Company ranks ninety-first in the order of precedence for livery companies. Its motto is &quot;Experience Foretells&quot; and its church is St Lawrence Jewry.

Like the medieval liveries of the City of London, the company plays a full role in the governance of the city, including the election and support of the lord mayor and sheriffs.

Most importantly, through its Charitable Trust, it gives help and support to those who are less fortunate, with an emphasis on making a difference in improving education, particularly in the area of mathematics.

The company is a member of the Financial Services Group of livery companies, the other 11 members of which are the Worshipful Companies of Chartered Accountants, Arbitrators, International Bankers, Chartered Secretaries and Administrators, Insurers, Information Technologists, City of London Solicitors, Management Consultants, Marketors, Tax Advisers, and World Traders.

<text>William Blanchard Jerrold (London 23 December 1826 – 10 March 1884), was an English journalist and author.

==Biography==
He was born in London, the eldest son of the dramatist, Douglas William Jerrold. Due to his disagreements with the practices at the elite Mao (&quot;Martin&#x27;s Academy at Old Slaughter&#x27;s&quot;) school, where he was educated for two and a half years, he left school and began working on newspapers at an early age.

He was appointed the Crystal Palace commissioner to Sweden in 1853, and wrote &quot;A Brage-Beaker with the Swedes&quot; (1854) on his return. In 1855 he was sent to the World&#x27;s Fair in Paris, the &quot;Exposition Universelle&quot;, as correspondent for several London papers, and from that time he lived much in Paris. In 1857 he succeeded his father as editor of &quot;Lloyd&#x27;s Weekly Newspaper&quot;, a post which he held for twenty-six years.

During the American Civil War he strongly supported the North, and several of his leading articles were reprinted and placarded in New York City by the federal government. He was the founder and president of the English branch of the international literary association for the assimilation of copyright laws.

He is buried with his father at West Norwood Cemetery.

==Bibliography==
Four of his plays were successfully produced on the London stage, the popular farce, &quot;Cool as a Cucumber&quot; (Lyceum 1851), being the best known. His French experiences resulted in a number of books, most important of which is his &quot;Life of Napoleon III&quot; (1874). On his death, he was occupied in writing the biography of Gustave Doré, who had illustrated several of his books.

Among his books are:
*&quot;A Story of Social Distinction&quot; (1848)
*&quot;Life and Remains of Douglas Jerrold&quot; (1859)
*&quot;Up and Down in the World&quot; (1863)
*&quot;The Children of Lutetia&quot; (1864)
*&quot;Cent per Cent&quot; (1871)
*&quot;At Home in Paris&quot; (1871)
*&quot;The Best of all Good Company&quot; (1871–73)
*&quot;&quot; (1872) illustrated by Gustave Doré
*&quot;The Life of George Cruikshank&quot; (1882)

<doc id="375900" wikidata="Q907271" url="?curid=375900" title="Isentropic process">
<text>An isentropic process is an idealized thermodynamic process that is both adiabatic and reversible. The work transfers of the system are frictionless, and there is no net transfer of heat or matter. Such an idealized process is useful in engineering as a model of and basis of comparison for real processes. This process is idealized because reversible processes do not occur in reality; thinking of a process as both adiabatic and reversible would show that the initial and final entropies are the same, thus, the reason it is called isentropic (entropy does not change). Thermodynamic processes are named based on the effect they would have on the system (ex. isovolumetric: constant volume, isenthalpic: constant enthalpy). Even though in reality it is not necessarily possible to carry out an isentropic process, some may be approximated as such.

The word &quot;isentropic&quot; derives from the process being one in which the entropy of the system remains unchanged. In addition to a process which is both adiabatic and reversible.

== Background ==

The second law of thermodynamics states that
:formula_1

where formula_2 is the amount of energy the system gains by heating, formula_3 is the temperature of the surroundings, and formula_4 is the change in entropy. The equal sign refers to a reversible process, which is an imagined idealized theoretical limit, never actually occurring in physical reality, with essentially equal temperatures of system and surroundings. For an isentropic process, if also reversible, there is no transfer of energy as heat because the process is adiabatic; &quot;δQ&quot; = 0. In contrast, if the process is irreversible, entropy is produced within the system; consequently, in order to maintain constant entropy within the system, energy must be simultaneously removed from the system as heat.

For reversible processes, an isentropic transformation is carried out by thermally &quot;insulating&quot; the system from its surroundings. Temperature is the thermodynamic conjugate variable to entropy, thus the conjugate process would be an isothermal process, in which the system is thermally &quot;connected&quot; to a constant-temperature heat bath.

== Isentropic processes in thermodynamic systems ==

The entropy of a given mass does not change during a process that is internally reversible and adiabatic. A process during which the entropy remains constant is called an isentropic process, written formula_5 or formula_6. Some examples of theoretically isentropic thermodynamic devices are pumps, gas compressors, turbines, nozzles, and diffusers.

===Isentropic efficiencies of steady-flow devices in thermodynamic systems===
Most steady-flow devices operate under adiabatic conditions, and the ideal process for these devices is the isentropic process. The parameter that describes how efficiently a device approximates a corresponding isentropic device is called isentropic or adiabatic efficiency.

Isentropic efficiency of turbines:
: formula_7

Isentropic efficiency of compressors:
: formula_8

Isentropic efficiency of nozzles:
: formula_9

For all the above equations:
: formula_10 is the specific enthalpy at the entrance state,
: formula_11 is the specific enthalpy at the exit state for the actual process,
: formula_12 is the specific enthalpy at the exit state for the isentropic process.

=== Isentropic devices in thermodynamic cycles===

Note: The isentropic assumptions are only applicable with ideal cycles. Real cycles have inherent losses due to compressor and turbine inefficiencies and the second law of thermodynamics. Real systems are not truly isentropic, but isentropic behavior is an adequate approximation for many calculation purposes.

== Isentropic flow ==

In fluid dynamics, an isentropic flow is a fluid flow that is both adiabatic and reversible. That is, no heat is added to the flow, and no energy transformations occur due to friction or dissipative effects. For an isentropic flow of a perfect gas, several relations can be derived to define the pressure, density and temperature along a streamline.

Note that energy &quot;can&quot; be exchanged with the flow in an isentropic transformation, as long as it doesn&#x27;t happen as heat exchange. An example of such an exchange would be an isentropic expansion or compression that entails work done on or by the flow.

For an isentropic flow, entropy density can vary between different streamlines. If the entropy density is the same everywhere, then the flow is said to be homentropic.

=== Derivation of the isentropic relations ===

For a closed system, the total change in energy of a system is the sum of the work done and the heat added:
: formula_13
The reversible work done on a system by changing the volume is
:formula_14
where formula_15 is the pressure, and formula_16 is the volume. The change in enthalpy (formula_17) is given by
:formula_18

Then for a process that is both reversible and adiabatic (i.e. no heat transfer occurs), formula_19, and so formula_20 All reversible adiabatic processes are isentropic. This leads to two important observations:
: formula_21
:formula_22

Next, a great deal can be computed for isentropic processes of an ideal gas. For any transformation of an ideal gas, it is always true that
:formula_23, and formula_24

Using the general results derived above for formula_25 and formula_26, then
: formula_27
: formula_28

So for an ideal gas, the heat capacity ratio can be written as
:formula_29

For a calorically perfect gas formula_30 is constant. Hence on integrating the above equation, assuming a calorically perfect gas, we get
: formula_31
that is,
: formula_32

Using the equation of state for an ideal gas, formula_33,
: formula_34 
(Proof: formula_35 But &quot;nR&quot; = constant itself, so formula_36.)

: formula_37

also, for constant formula_38 (per mole),
: formula_39 and formula_40

: formula_41

: formula_42

Thus for isentropic processes with an ideal gas,
: formula_43 or formula_44

=== Table of isentropic relations for an ideal gas ===

Derived from
: formula_45
: formula_46
: formula_47
where:
: formula_48 = pressure,
: formula_16 = volume,
: formula_30 = ratio of specific heats = formula_51,
: formula_52 = temperature,
: formula_53 = mass,
: formula_54 = gas constant for the specific gas = formula_55,
: formula_56 = universal gas constant,
: formula_57 = molecular weight of the specific gas,
: formula_58 = density,
: formula_59 = molar specific heat at constant pressure,
: formula_60 = molar specific heat at constant volume.

<text>The Worshipful Company of Arbitrators is 93rd in the order of precedence of the livery companies of the City of London. The organisation formally became a livery company on 17 March 1981. The company supports education in the field of arbitration. It also functions as a charitable institution. Its motto (as displayed beneath its coat of arms) is &quot;Law and Custom&quot;, and its church is St Mary-le-Bow.

As with other livery companies, there are two main categories of membership: &quot;liverymen&quot; and &quot;freemen&quot;. Its limit of 300 liverymen was decreed by the Court of Aldermen, all of whom must be freemen of the City of London. Being admitted as a liveryman acknowledges a dedication to good government and order. Only liverymen may be part of the leadership of the company; the master, the senior warden, the junior warden and the Court of Assistants; likewise only liverymen may nominate others for membership.

Company freemen must be of good character and have an interest in and relevant experience of private dispute resolution (while many of the older companies&#x27; links with their original trades have expired, most of the newer livery companies maintain close ties with their vocations).

The Arbitrators&#x27; Company (as it is alternatively styled) arranges a programme of activities to promote arbitration and interest in arbitration in London. In such matters, it is held to be at the leading edge of ideas and development, in ways that cross boundaries between different dispute resolution specialisations in all fields, including commerce and all business and domestic activities.

The company has established charitable trusts through which it expects to continue building substantial funds, with the aim of supporting education in the field of arbitration.

It provides members with the opportunity of hearing from distinguished experts in its field and to exchange ideas and views in convivial surroundings. It is also dedicated to the promotion of the City of London as the centre of excellence for International Dispute Resolution.

The company is a member of the Financial Services Group of Livery Companies, the other 11 members of which are the Worshipful Companies of Chartered Accountants, Actuaries, International Bankers, Chartered Secretaries and Administrators, Insurers, Information Technologists, City of London Solicitors, Management Consultants, Marketors, Tax Advisers, and World Traders.

<doc id="375904" wikidata="Q1149762" url="?curid=375904" title="Mahan Air">
<text>Mahan Airlines, operating under the name Mahan Air (), is a privately owned Iranian airline based in Tehran, Iran. It operates scheduled domestic services and international flights to the Far East, Middle East, Central Asia and Europe. Its main home bases are Tehran Imam Khomeini International Airport and Mehrabad International Airport. Mahan air is affiliated with the Quds Force of Iran&#x27;s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. 

Mahan Airlines was banned between 2019-2020 from Germany, France, Italy and Spain due to its involvement with the Maduro government in Venezuela and the Assad regime in Syria. In 2024 the airline was sanctioned by the European Union for transporting weaponry to Russia during the Russo-Ukrainian War. It was also suspected of transferring money to Iranian proxy, Hezbollah, in Lebanon. The airline is also sanctioned by the United States.

==History==
===Early developments===
Mahan Air was established in 1991 as a Full-Service Carrier (FSC) and began operations in June 1992 as Iran&#x27;s first private airline. The name of Mahan is taken from the city of Mahan in Kerman Province. The airline is wholly owned by the Mol-Al-Movahedin Charity Institute.

Three Airbus A300B4 passenger aircraft were acquired in 1999, and in 2002 A310s and A320s joined the fleet. According to the British High Court, three 747-400s were unlawfully taken by Mahan Air from their real owner, Blue Sky Airlines, in 2008, using forged bills of sale. When ordered to bring the aircraft back to Europe, Mahan claimed it could not do so because it was being investigated by the Iranian authorities for fraud, and the aircraft had to be kept in Iran. 

Since 2006 Boeing 747-400s, Airbus A300-600s, Avro RJ-100s, and Airbus A340-600s were gradually acquired.

The airline carried 5.4 million passengers in 2015 with an average load factor of 77%. In mid-2015, it had a fleet of 60 aircraft. It operates scheduled passenger services to international destinations in Europe, the Far East, and the Middle East. Mahan Air has a domestic route network too. 

The airline is affiliated with the Iranian Qods Force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard according to the US department of industry and security. Mahran air was sanctioned by the United States Department of the Treasury.

===Developments since 2011===
On 12 December 2011, the U.S. Department of Treasury announced the designation of Mahan Air as a material and transportation supporter of terrorism, &quot;for providing financial, material and technological support to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force (IRGC-QF). Based in Tehran, Mahan Air provides transportation, funds transfers, and personnel travel services to the IRGC-QF.&quot;

On 6 April 2016, Mahan Air was banned from flying over Saudi Arabian airspace.

In 2016, besides Germany and Denmark, Mahan Air started service to Milan and Athens, and to Barcelona the following year. It operated up to 15 weekly flights to China until late 2018.

During the Venezuelan presidential crisis, Mahan Air launched their direct Caracas-Tehran route in April 2019. In January 2019, the German government banned Mahan Air from landing in Germany, where it had formerly served Munich Airport and Düsseldorf Airport, citing Mahan&#x27;s involvement in Syria and security concerns. France imposed the same ban on 25 March 2019, and Mahan Air was forced to cancel its 4-weekly service to Paris. On 1 November 2019, the Italian government also announced that it would ban Mahan Air flights to the country from 15 December 2019. The move came after United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo&#x27;s visit to Rome, during which he urged Italian officials to stop allowing Iranian airlines to use Italy&#x27;s airspace. The remaining destinations within the European Union had been Barcelona and seasonally also Athens and Varna since then. However, in April 2020, the airline lost its traffic rights to Spain as well.

According to the BBC, after Iran officially suspended all flights to and from China in 2020, Mahan Air continued flying to China and elsewhere in February and March of that year. The data show that although six flights were used for aid, four others were used to evacuate Iranian citizens from China, and there were a total of 157 additional flights with China from 6 February 2020 to 31 March 2020. Mahan Air was widely blamed for spreading the Covid-19 virus in Iran.

In October 2024, The European Union imposed sanctions on Mahan Air for supplying missiles and drones to Russia for the war in Ukraine.

During the Israel-Hamas war, Iran is suspected to have used Mahran air to transfer money to Iranian proxy, Hezbollah in Lebanon.

==Corporate affairs==
Mahan Air is headquartered in Tehran. Its current slogan is &quot;The Spirit of Excellence.&quot; Mahan Air loyalty program, called the Mahan Club &quot;Mahan &amp; Miles&quot;, includes access to special lounges and dedicated &quot;fast&quot; queues.

==Destinations==
As of October 2023, Mahan Air operated flights to domestic destinations and international destinations in countries across Asia and Europe. Mahan Air served 45 destinations in 10 countries.

===Historical fleet===
Mahan Air has operated the following aircraft types:

==Incidents==
* On 23 February 2006, a Mahan Air Airbus A310 operating a flight from Tehran, Iran, was involved in a serious incident while on approach to Birmingham International Airport. The aircraft descended to the published minimum descent altitude of 740 ft despite still being 11 nm from the runway threshold. At a point 6 nm from the runway, the aircraft had descended to an altitude of 660 ft, which was 164 ft above ground level. Having noticed the descent profile, Birmingham air traffic control issued an immediate climb instruction to the aircraft, however, the crew had already commenced a missed approach, having received a GPWS alert. The aircraft was radar-vectored for a second approach, during which the flight crew again initiated an early descent. On this occasion, the radar controller instructed the crew to maintain their altitude, and the crew completed the approach to a safe landing. The accident investigation determined that the primary cause was the use of the incorrect DME for the approach, combined with a substantial breakdown in Crew Resource Management. Three safety recommendations were made. 
*On 23 September 2013, a Boeing 747-300 registered EP-MNE operating as Flight 5070 from Kerman to Medina aborted takeoff after V1 and excursed from the runway. All 443 people survived, and only 13 were injured. The aircraft was repaired and returned to service but would be involved in another accident two years later.
*On 13 June 2014, an Airbus A310 registered EP-MNX was struck by a passenger bus while parked at Tehran-Imam Khomeini International Airport. The aircraft was unoccupied at the time of the incident and was repaired.
*On 15 October 2015, the same aircraft involved in the Flight 5070 incident operating as Flight 1095 from Tehran to Bandar Abbas, experienced an engine failure after taking off from Tehran. The aircraft returned to Tehran and made an emergency landing with no injuries to the 441 people on board reported. The aircraft was almost damaged beyond repair. However, in April 2021, after being in a C-Check and being repaired for over six years, the plane was re-activated.
*On 24 December 2015, Mahan Air Flight 112, an Airbus A310 registered EP-MNP, rolled off the apron at Istanbul while taxiing at Istanbul Atatürk Airport. All 166 people survived, and the aircraft was repaired.
*On 19 June 2016, a British Aerospace BAe-146-300 registered EP-MOF operating as Flight 4525 from Ahvaz to Khark overran the runway after landing at Khark Airport and was substantially damaged. All 89 people on board survived with no injuries, but the aircraft was declared a hull loss.
*On 23 July 2020, it was reported that a Mahan Air Airbus A310-300 registered EP-MNF operating as Flight 1152 from Tehran to Beirut, was escorted by American fighter jets over Syrian airspace. The airplane landed in Beirut with three injuries reported.
*On 3 October 2022, a bomb threat on Mahan Air Flight 81, an Airbus A340, travelling from Tehran to Guangzhou caused the Indian Air Force to scramble fighter jets as the aircraft passed through Indian airspace. The threat was received at Delhi air traffic control from Lahore air traffic control when the aircraft was about 200 km west of Delhi. The flight made three circles as it waited to land in Delhi, but was denied. The flight then offered to land at other Indian airports, but the requests were not taken up. The bomb threat was later called a hoax on receiving information from Tehran and only then was the flight able to reach its destination.
* On 26 December 2022, Mahan Air (W5) Flight 63 from Tehran (IKA) to Dubai International Airport (DXB) made an abrupt diversion to Kish International Airport (KIH), as it was approaching Dubai over the Persian Gulf. The Airbus A340 was reportedly ordered to land by Iranian authorities to prevent the wife and daughter of Ali Daei, Iran&#x27;s most famous footballer, from leaving the country.

<doc id="375905" wikidata="Q153128" url="?curid=375905" title="Independent State of Croatia">
<text>The Independent State of Croatia (, NDH) was a World War II–era puppet state of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. It was established in parts of occupied Yugoslavia on 10 April 1941, after the invasion by the Axis powers. Its territory consisted mostly of modern-day Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as some parts of modern-day Serbia and Slovenia, but also excluded many Croat-populated areas in Dalmatia (until late 1943), Istria, and Međimurje regions (which today are part of Croatia).

During its entire existence, the NDH was governed as a one-party state by the fascist Ustaše organization. The Ustaše was led by the &quot;Poglavnik&quot; The regime targeted Serbs, Jews and Roma as part of a large-scale campaign of genocide, as well as anti-fascist or dissident Croats and Bosnian Muslims. According to Stanley G. Payne, &quot;crimes in the NDH were proportionately surpassed only by Nazi Germany, the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia and several of the extremely genocidal African regimes.&quot; In the territory controlled by the Independent State of Croatia, between 1941 and 1945, there existed 22 concentration camps. The largest camp was Jasenovac. Two camps, Jastrebarsko and Sisak, held only children.

The state was officially a monarchy after the signing of the &quot;Laws of the Crown of Zvonimir&quot; on 15 May 1941. Prince Aimone, Duke of Aosta, who had been appointed by King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy, initially refused to assume the crown in opposition to the Italian annexation of the Croat-majority populated region of Dalmatia, annexed as part of the Italian irredentist agenda of creating a &quot;Mare Nostrum&quot; (&quot;Our Sea&quot;). The Duke later briefly accepted the throne due to pressure from Victor Emmanuel III and was titled Tomislav II of Croatia, but never moved from Italy to reside in Croatia.

From the signing of the Treaties of Rome on 18 May 1941 until the Italian capitulation on 8 September 1943, the state was a territorial condominium of Germany and Italy. &quot;Thus on 15 April 1941, Pavelić came to power, albeit a very limited power, in the new Ustasha state under the umbrella of German and Italian forces. On the same day German &quot;Führer&quot; Adolf Hitler and Italian &quot;Duce&quot; Benito Mussolini granted recognition to the Croatian state and declared that their governments would be glad to participate with the Croatian government in determining its frontiers.&quot; In its judgement in the Hostages Trial, the Nuremberg Military Tribunal concluded that NDH was not a sovereign state. According to the Tribunal, &quot;Croatia was at all times here involved an occupied country&quot;.

In 1942, Germany suggested Italy take military control of all of Croatia out of a desire to redirect German troops from Croatia to the Eastern Front. Italy, however, rejected the offer as it did not believe that it could on its own handle the unstable situation in the Balkans. After the ousting of Mussolini and the Kingdom of Italy&#x27;s armistice with the Allies, Tomislav II abdicated from his Croatian throne: the NDH on 10 September 1943 declared that the Treaties of Rome were null and void and annexed the portion of Dalmatia that had been ceded to Italy. The NDH attempted to annex Zara (modern-day Zadar, Croatia), which had been a recognized territory of Italy since 1920 and long an object of Croatian irredentism, but Germany did not allow it.

==Geography==
Geographically, the NDH encompassed most of modern-day Croatia, all of Bosnia and Herzegovina, part of modern-day Serbia, and a small portion of modern-day Slovenia in the Municipality of Brežice. It bordered Nazi Germany to the north-west, the Kingdom of Hungary to the north-east, the Serbian administration (a joint German-Serb government) to the east, Montenegro (an Italian protectorate) to the south-east and Fascist Italy along its coastal area.

===Establishment of borders===
The exact borders of the Independent State of Croatia were unclear when it was established. Approximately one month after its formation, significant areas of Croat-populated territory were ceded to its Axis partners, including the Kingdoms of Hungary and Italy.
*On 13 May 1941, the NDH government signed an agreement with Nazi Germany which demarcated their borders.
*On 18 May the Treaties of Rome were signed by diplomats of the NDH and Italy. Large parts of Croatian lands were occupied (annexed) by Italy, including most of Dalmatia (including Split and Šibenik), nearly all the Adriatic islands (including Rab, Krk, Vis, Korčula, Mljet), and some smaller areas such as the Bay of Kotor, parts of the Croatian Littoral and Gorski kotar areas.
*On 7 June the NDH government issued a decree that demarcated its eastern border with Serbia.
*On 27 October the NDH and Italy reached an agreement on the Independent State of Croatia&#x27;s border with Montenegro.
*On 8 September 1943, Italy capitulated and the NDH officially considered the Treaties of Rome to be void, along with the Treaty of Rapallo of 1920 which had given Italy Istria, Fiume (now Rijeka) and Zara (Zadar).

German foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop approved the NDH acquisition of the Dalmatian territories gained by Italy at the time of the Treaties of Rome. By now, most such territory was actually controlled by the Yugoslav Partisans, since the ceding of those areas had made them strongly anti-NDH (more than one third of the total population of Split is documented to have joined the Partisans). By 11 September 1943, NDH foreign minister Mladen Lorković received word from German consul Siegfried Kasche that the NDH should wait before moving on Istria. Germany&#x27;s central government had already annexed Istria and Fiume (Rijeka) into the Operational Zone Adriatic Coast a day earlier. Međimurje and southern Baranja were annexed (occupied) by the Kingdom of Hungary. NDH disputed this and continued to lay claim to both, naming the administrative province centred in Osijek as &quot;Great Parish Baranja&quot;. This border was never legislated, although Hungary may have considered the Pacta conventa to be in effect, which delineated the two nation&#x27;s borders along the Drava river.

When compared to the republic borders established in the SFR Yugoslavia after the war, the NDH encompassed the whole of Bosnia and Herzegovina, with its non-Croat (Serb and Bosniak) majority, as well as some 20 km2 of Slovenia (the villages of Slovenska Vas, Nova Vas pri Mokricah, Jesenice, Obrežje, and Čedem) and the whole of Syrmia (part of which was previously in the Danube Banovina).

===Administrative divisions===

The Independent State of Croatia had four levels of administrative divisions: great parishes (velike župe), districts (kotari), cities (gradovi) and municipalities (opcine). At the time of its foundation, the state had 22 great parishes, 142 districts, 31 cities and 1006 municipalities.

The highest level of administration were the great parishes (Velike župe), each of which was headed by a Grand Župan. After the capitulation of Italy, NDH were permitted by the Germans to annex parts of the areas of Yugoslavia previously occupied by Italy. To accommodate this, parish boundaries were changed and the new parish of Sidraga-Ravni Kotari was created. In addition, on 29 October 1943, the Kommissariat of Sušak-Krk (Croatian: Građanska Sušak-Rijeka) was created separately by the Germans to act as a buffer zone between the NDH and RSI in the Fiume area to &quot;perceive the special interests of the local population against the [I]talians&quot;


==History==

===Influences on the rise of the Ustaše===

In 1915 a group of political emigres from Austria-Hungary, predominantly Croats but including some Serbs and a Slovene, formed themselves into a Yugoslav Committee, with a view to creating a South Slav state in the aftermath of World War I. They saw this as a way to prevent Dalmatia being ceded to Italy under the Treaty of London (1915). In 1918, the National Council of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs sent a delegation to the Serbian monarch to offer unification of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs with the Kingdom of Serbia. The leader of the Croatian Peasant Party, Stjepan Radić, warned on their departure for Belgrade that the council had no democratic legitimacy. But a new state, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, was duly proclaimed on 1 December 1918, with no heed taken of legal protocols such as the signing of a new &quot;Pacta conventa&quot; in recognition of historic Croatian state rights.

Croats were at the outset politically disadvantaged with the centralized political structure of the kingdom, which was seen as favouring the Serb majority. The political situation of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes was fractious and violent. In 1927, the Independent Democratic Party, which represented the Serbs of Croatia, turned its back on the centralist policy of King Alexander and entered into a coalition with the Croatian Peasant Party.

On 20 June 1928, Stjepan Radić and four other Croat deputies were shot while in the Belgrade parliament by a member of the Serbian People&#x27;s Radical Party. Three of the deputies, including Radić, died. The outrage that resulted from the assassination of Stjepan Radić threatened to destabilise the kingdom. In January 1929, King Alexander responded by proclaiming a royal dictatorship, under which all dissenting political activity was banned and the state was renamed the &quot;Kingdom of Yugoslavia&quot;. The Ustaša was created in principle in 1929.

One consequence of Alexander&#x27;s 1929 proclamation and the repression and persecution of Croatian nationalists was a rise of support for the Croatian extreme nationalist, Ante Pavelić, who had been a Zagreb deputy in the Yugoslav parliament, He was later implicated in Alexander&#x27;s assassination in 1934, went into exile in Italy and gained support for his vision of liberating Croatia from Serb control and racially &quot;purifying&quot; Croatia. While residing in Italy, Pavelić and other Croatian exiles planned the Ustaša insurgency.

===Establishment of the NDH===

Following the attack of the Axis powers on the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1941, and the quick defeat of the Royal Yugoslav Army (&quot;Jugoslavenska Vojska&quot;), the country was occupied by Axis forces. The Axis powers offered Vladko Maček the opportunity to form a government, since Maček and his party, the Croatian Peasant Party () had the greatest electoral support among Yugoslavia&#x27;s Croats – but Maček refused that offer.

On 10 April 1941 the German army took control in Zagreb. With their support, retired lieutenant-colonel Slavko Kvaternik, deputy leader of the Ustaše, declared the creation of the Independent State of Croatia (Nezavisna Država Hrvatska – NDH) &quot;in the name of Croats and the header (poglavnik) Ante Pavelić&quot;. A few days later on 15 April 1941, Ante Pavelić returned to Zagreb from exile in Italy, and on 16 April 1941 he took power as the State Leader, or the &quot;Leader&quot; (Poglavnik), holding the office of prime minister.

Acceding to the demands of Benito Mussolini and the Fascist regime in the Kingdom of Italy, Pavelić reluctantly accepted Aimone the 4th Duke of Aosta as a figurehead King of the NDH under his new royal name, Tomislav II. Aosta was not interested in being the figurehead King of Croatia:
Upon learning he had been named King of Croatia, he told close colleagues that he thought his nomination was a bad joke by his cousin King Victor Emmanuel III though he accepted the crown out of a sense of duty. He never visited the NDH and had no influence over the government, which was dominated by Pavelić.

From a strategic perspective, the establishment of the NDH was an attempt by Mussolini and Hitler to pacify the Croats, while reducing the use of Axis resources, which were more urgently needed for Operation Barbarossa. Meanwhile, Mussolini used his long-established support for Croatian independence as leverage to coerce Pavelić into signing an agreement on 18 May 1941 at 12:30, under which central Dalmatia and parts of Hrvatsko primorje and Gorski kotar were ceded to Italy.

Under the same agreement, the NDH was restricted to a minimal navy and Italian forces were granted military control of the entire Croatian coastline. After Pavelić signed the agreement, other Croatian politicians rebuked him. Pavelić publicly defended the decision and thanked Germany and Italy for supporting Croatian independence. After refusing leadership of the NDH, Maček called on all to obey and cooperate with the new government. The Roman Catholic Church was also openly supportive of the government. According to Maček, the new state was greeted with a &quot;wave of enthusiasm&quot; in Zagreb, often by people &quot;blinded and intoxicated&quot; by the fact that the Nazi Germany had &quot;gift-wrapped their occupation under the euphemistic title of &quot;Independent State of Croatia&quot;&quot;. But in the villages, Maček wrote, the peasantry believed that &quot;their struggle over the past 30 years to become masters of their homes and their country had suffered a tremendous setback&quot;.

On 16 August 1941, the Ustaše Surveillance Service was established, consisting of four departments, the &quot;Ustasha Police&quot;, the &quot;Ustasha Intelligence Service&quot;, &quot;Ustasha Defense&quot;, and &quot;Personnel&quot;, for the suppression of activities against the Ustasha, the Independent State of Croatia, and the Croatian people. The Service was eliminated as a separate agency in January 1943 and functions were transferred to the Ministry of Interior under the &quot;Directorate of Public Order&quot;. Dissatisfied with the Pavelić regime in its early months, the Axis Powers in September 1941 asked Maček to take over, but Maček again refused. Perceiving Maček as a potential rival, Pavelić subsequently had him arrested and interned in the Jasenovac concentration camp. The Ustaše initially did not have an army or administration capable of controlling all the territory of the NDH. The Ustaše movement had fewer than 12,000 members when the war started. While the Ustaše&#x27;s own estimates put the number of their sympathizers even in the early phase at around 40,000.
To act against Serbs and Jews with genocidal measures, the Ustase introduced widespread measures that Croats themselves were victim to. Jozo Tomasevich in his book, &quot;War and Revolution in Yugoslavia: 1941–1945&quot;, states, &quot;never before in history had Croats been exposed to such legalized administrative, police and judicial brutality and abuse as during the Ustasha regime.&quot; Decrees enacted by the regime allowed it to get rid of all &#x27;unwanted&#x27; employees in state and local government and in state enterprises. The &#x27;unwanted&#x27; (being all Jews, Serbs, and Yugoslav-oriented Croats) were all thrown out except for some deemed specifically needed by the government. This left a multitude of jobs to be filled by Ustashas and pro-Ustasha adherents and led to government jobs being filled by people with no professional qualifications.

===Italian influence===

Mussolini and Ante Pavelić had close relations prior to the war. Mussolini and Pavelić both despised the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Italy had been promised, in the Treaty of London (1915), that it would receive Dalmatia from Austria-Hungary at the end of World War I. The peace negotiations in 1919, however, influenced by the Fourteen Points proclaimed by US President Woodrow Wilson (1856–1924), called for national self-determination and determined that the Yugoslavs rightfully deserved the territory in question. Italian nationalists were enraged. Italian nationalist Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio raided Fiume (which held a mixed population of Croats and Italians) and proclaimed it part of the Italian Regency of Carnaro. D&#x27;Annunzio declared himself &quot;Duce&quot; of Carnaro and his blackshirted revolutionaries held control over the town. D&#x27;Annunzio was known for engaging in passionate speeches aimed to draw Croatian nationalists to support his actions and to oppose Yugoslavia.

Croatian nationalists, such as Pavelić, opposed the border changes that occurred after World War I. Not only was D&#x27;Annunzio&#x27;s symbolism copied by Mussolini but also D&#x27;Annunzio&#x27;s appeal to Croatian support for the dismantling of Yugoslavia, as a foreign policy approach to Yugoslavia by Mussolini. Pavelić had been in negotiations with Italy since 1927 that included advocating a territory-for-sovereignty swap in which he would tolerate Italy annexing its claimed territory in Dalmatia in exchange for Italy supporting the sovereignty of an independent Croatia.

In the 1930s, upon Pavelić and the Ustaše being forced into exile by the Yugoslav government, they were offered sanctuary in Italy by Mussolini, who allowed them to use training grounds to prepare for war against Yugoslavia. In exchange for this support, Mussolini demanded that Pavelić agree that Dalmatia would become part of Italy if Italy and the Ustaše successfully waged war on Yugoslavia. Although Dalmatia was a largely Croat-populated territory, it had been part of various Italian states, such as the Roman Empire and the Republic of Venice in prior centuries and was part of Italian nationalism&#x27;s irredentist claims.

In exchange for this concession, Mussolini offered Pavelić the right for Croatia to annex all of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which had only a minority Croat population. Pavelić agreed. After the invasion and occupation of Yugoslavia, Italy annexed numerous Adriatic islands and a portion of Dalmatia, which all combined to become the Italian Governorship of Dalmatia including territory from the provinces of Split, Zadar, and Kotor.

Although Italy had initially larger territorial aims that extended from the Velebit mountains to the Albanian Alps, Mussolini decided against annexing further territories due to a number of factors, including that Italy held the economically valuable portion of that territory within its possession while the northern Adriatic coast had no important railways or roads and because a larger annexation would have included hundreds of thousands of Slavs who were hostile to Italy, within its national borders.

Italy intended to keep the NDH within its sphere of influence by forbidding it to build any significant navy. Italy only permitted small patrol boats to be used by NDH forces. This policy forbidding the creation of NDH warships was part of the Italian Fascists&#x27; policy of &quot;Mare Nostrum&quot; (Latin for &quot;Our Sea&quot;) in which Italy was to dominate the Mediterranean Sea as the Roman Empire had done centuries earlier. Italian armed forces assisted the Ustaše government in persecuting Serbs. In 1941, Italian forces captured and interned the Serbian Orthodox Bishop Irinej (Đorđević) of Dalmatia.

===Influence of Nazi Germany===

At the time of the invasion of Yugoslavia by Nazi Germany, Adolf Hitler was uneasy with Mussolini&#x27;s agenda of creating a puppet Croatian state, and preferred that areas outside of Italian territorial aims become part of Hungary as an autonomous territory. This would appease Nazi Germany&#x27;s ally Hungary and its nationalist territorial claims. Germany&#x27;s position on Croatia changed after its invasion of Yugoslavia in 1941. The invasion was spearheaded by a strong German invasion force which was largely responsible for the capture of Yugoslavia. Military forces from other Axis powers, including Italy, Hungary, and Bulgaria made few gains during the invasion.
The invasion was precipitated by the need for German forces to reach Greece to save Italian forces, which were failing on the battlefield against the Greek armed forces. Upon rescuing Italian forces in Greece and having conquered Yugoslavia and Greece almost single-handedly, Hitler became frustrated with Mussolini and Italy&#x27;s military incompetence. Germany improved relations with the Ustaše and supported the NDH claims to annex the Adriatic Coast in order reduce Italy&#x27;s planned territorial gains. Nevertheless, Italy annexed a significant central portion of Dalmatia and various Adriatic Islands. This was not what had been agreed with Pavelić prior to the invasion; Italy had expected to annex all of Dalmatia as part of its irredentist claims.

Hitler sparred with his army commanders over what policy should be undertaken in Croatia regarding the Serbs. German military officials thought that Serbs could be rallied to fight against the Partisans. Hitler disagreed with his commanders, but pointed out to Pavelić that the NDH could create a completely Croat state only if it followed a constant policy of persecution of the non-Croat population for at least fifty years. The NDH was never fully sovereign, but it was a puppet state that enjoyed greater autonomy than any other regime in German-occupied Europe.

As early as 10 July 1941, Wehrmacht General Edmund Glaise von Horstenau reported the following to the German High Command, the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW):
The Gestapo report to Reichsführer SS Heinrich Himmler, dated 17 February 1942, states: 

According to reports by General Glaise-Horstenau, Hitler was angry with Pavelić, whose policy inflamed the rebellion in Croatia, thwarting any prospect of deploying NDH forces on the Eastern Front. Moreover, Hitler was forced to engage large forces of his own to keep the rebellion in check. For that reason, Hitler summoned Pavelić to his war headquarters in Vinnytsia (Ukraine) on 23 September 1942. Consequently, Pavelić replaced his minister of the Armed Forces, Slavko Kvaternik, with the less zealous Jure Francetić. Kvaternik was sent into exile in Slovakia – along with his son Eugen, who was blamed for the persecution of the Serbs in Croatia. Before meeting Hitler, to appease the public, Pavelić published an &quot;Important Government Announcement&quot; (»Važna obavijest Vlade«), in which he threatened those who were spreading the news &quot;about non-existent threats of disarmament of the Ustashe units by representatives of one foreign power, about the Croatian Army replacement by a foreign army, about the possibility that a foreign power would seize the power in Croatia [...] &quot;

General Glaise-Horstenau reported: &quot;The Ustaše movement is, due to the mistakes and atrocities they have committed and the corruption, so compromised that the government executive branch (the home guard and the police) shall be separated from the government – even for the price of breaking any possible connection with the government.&quot;

Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler is quoted characterizing the Independent State of Croatia as &quot;ridiculous&quot;: &quot;our beloved German settlements will be secured. I hope that the area south of Srem will be liberated by [...] the Bosnian division [...] so that we can at least restore partial order in this ridiculous (Croatian) state.&quot; The Ustaše gained German support for plans to eliminate the Serb population in Croatia. One plan involved an exchange in 1941 between Germany and the NDH, in which 20,000 Catholic Slovenes would be deported from German-held Slovenia and sent to the NDH where they would be assimilated as Croats. In exchange, 20,000 Serbs would be deported from the NDH and sent to the German-occupied territory of Serbia. On the meeting with Hitler on 6 June 1941 in Salzburg, Pavelić agreed to receive 175,000 deported Slovenes. The agreement provided that the number of Serbs deported from NDH to Serbia could exceed the number of Slovenes received by 30,000. During the talks, Hitler stressed the necessity and desirability of deportations of Slovenes and Serbs, and advised Pavelic that NDH, in order to become stable, should carry on ethnically intolerant policy for the next 50 years. The German occupation forces allowed the expulsion of Serbs to Serbia, but instead of sending the Slovenes to Croatia, they were also deported to Serbia. In total, about 300,000 Serbs had been deported or fled from the NDH to Serbia by the end of World War II.

The atrocities committed by the Ustaše stunned observers; Brigadier Sir Fitzroy Maclean, Chief of the British military mission to the Partisans, commented &quot;Some Ustaše collected the eyes of Serbs they had killed, sending them, when they had enough, to the Poglavnik &quot;[&#x27;head-man&#x27;]&quot; for his inspection or proudly displaying them and other human organs in the cafés of Zagreb.&quot;

The Nazi regime demanded that the Ustaše adopt antisemitic racial policies, persecute Jews and set up several concentration camps. Pavelic and the Ustaše accepted Nazi demands, but their racial policy focused primarily on eliminating the Serb population. When the Ustaše needed more recruits to help exterminate the Serbs, the state broke away from Nazi antisemitic policy by promising honorary Aryan citizenship, and, thus, freedom from persecution, to Jews who were willing to fight for the NDH. As this was the only legal means allowing Jews to escape persecution, a number of Jews joined the NDH&#x27;s armed forces. This aggravated the German SS, which claimed that the NDH let 5,000 Jews survive via service in the NDH&#x27;s armed forces. German anti-Semitic objectives for Croatia were further undermined by Italy&#x27;s reluctance to adhere to a strict antisemitic policy, which resulted in Jews in Italian-held parts of Croatia avoiding the same persecution facing Jews in German-held eastern Croatia. After Italy abandoned the war in 1943, German forces occupied western Croatia and the NDH annexed the territory ceded to Italy in 1941.

Within just a few days of the creation of the NDH, Croatian workers were requisitioned by the Reich for cheap forced labour and slave labour. From 1942 onward, German and Croat authorities cooperated more closely in deporting &quot;unwanted&quot; Croats and Serbs to concentration camps in the Reich and Norway for forced labour, such people were to be rounded up and deported by the General Plenipotentiary for Labour Deployment to the Reich (Arbeitseinsatz).

Between 1941 and 1945, some 200,000 Croatian citizens of the NDH (including ethnic Croats as well as ethnic Serbs with Croatian nationality and Slovenes) were sent to Germany to work as slave and forced labourers, mostly working in mining, agriculture and forestry. It is estimated that 153,000 of these labourers were said to have been &quot;voluntarily&quot; recruited, however in many instances this was not the case, as the workers that may have initially volunteered were forced to work longer hours and were paid less than their contracts had stipulated, they were also not allowed to return home after their yearly contract had ended, at which point their labour was no longer voluntary, but forced. Forced and slave labour were also conducted in Nazi concentration camps, such as in Buchenwald and Mittelbau-Dora. From 1941 to 1945, 3.8% of the population of Croatia had been sent to the Reich to work, which was higher than the European average.

===Partisan resistance===

On 22 June 1941, the Sisak Partisan Detachment was formed in Brezovica forest near Sisak; this was to be celebrated as the first armed resistance unit formed in occupied Yugoslavia during World War II. Croats, Serbs, Bosniaks, and citizens of all nationalities and backgrounds began joining the pan-Yugoslav Partisans led by Josip Broz Tito. The Partisan movement was soon able to control a large percentage of the NDH (and Yugoslavia) and before long the cities of occupied Bosnia and Dalmatia in particular were surrounded by these Partisan-controlled areas, with their garrisons living in a &quot;de facto&quot; state of siege and constantly trying to maintain control of the rail-links.

In 1944, the third year of the war in Yugoslavia, Croats formed 61% of the Partisan operational units originating from the Federal State of Croatia.

The Federal State of Croatia also had the highest number of detachments and brigades among the federal units, and together with the forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Partisan resistance in the NDH made up the majority of the movement&#x27;s military strength.

===Relations with the Chetniks===
After the 1941 split between the Partisans and the Chetniks in Serbia, the Chetnik groups in central, eastern and northwestern Bosnia found themselves caught between the German and Ustaše (NDH) forces on one side and the Partisans on the other. In early 1942 Chetnik Major Jezdimir Dangić approached the Germans in an attempt to arrive at an understanding, but was unsuccessful, and the local Chetnik leaders were forced to look for another solution. Although the Ustaše and Chetniks were rival nationalists (Croatian and Serbian), they found a common enemy in the Partisans, and thwarting Partisan advances became the overriding reason for the collaboration which ensued between the Ustaše authorities of the Independent State of Croatia and Chetnik detachments in Bosnia.

The first formal agreement between Bosnian Chetniks and the Ustaše was concluded on 28 May 1942, in which Chetnik leaders expressed their loyalty as &quot;citizens of the Independent State of Croatia&quot; both to the state and its Poglavnik (Ante Pavelić). During the next three weeks, three additional agreements were signed, covering a large part of the area of Bosnia (along with the Chetnik detachments within it). By the provision of these agreements, the Chetniks were to cease hostilities against the Ustaše state, and the Ustaše would establish regular administration in these areas. The main provision, Article 5 of the agreement, states as follows:As long as there is danger from the Partisan armed bands, the Chetnik formations will cooperate voluntarily with the Croatian military in fighting and destroying the Partisans and in those operations they will be under the overall command of the Croatian armed forces. [...] Chetnik formations may engage in operations against the Partisans on their own, but this they will have to report, on time, to the Croatian military commanders.

The necessary ammunition and provisions were supplied to the Chetniks by the Ustaše military. Chetniks who were wounded in such operations would be cared for in NDH hospitals, while the orphans and widows of Chetniks killed in action would be supported by the Ustaše state. Persons specifically recommended by Chetnik commanders would be returned home from the Ustaše concentration camps. These agreements covered the majority of Chetnik forces in Bosnia east of the German-Italian demarcation line, and lasted throughout most of the war. Since Croatian forces were immediately subordinate to the German military occupation, collaboration with Croatian forces was, in fact, indirect collaboration with the Germans.

===End of the war===
In August 1944, there was an attempt by the NDH Foreign Minister Mladen Lorković and Minister of War Ante Vokić to execute a coup d&#x27;état against Ante Pavelić so as to separate from the Axis and align with the Allies. The Lorković-Vokić coup failed and its conspirators were executed. By early 1945, the NDH army withdrew towards Zagreb with German and Cossack troops. They were overpowered and the advance of Tito&#x27;s Partisan forces, joined by the Soviet Red Army, caused a mass retreat of the Ustaše towards Austria and effectively an end to the Independent State of Croatia. Pavelić himself, too, fled, even though he had vowed to fight in Zagreb till the bitter end.

In May 1945, a large column composed of NDH Home Guard troops, Ustaša, Cossacks, Serbian State Guard, some Chetniks and the Slovene Home Guard, as well as numerous civilians, retreated from the Partisan forces heading northwest towards Italy and Austria. The German Instrument of Surrender was signed on 8 May, but the Germans put Pavelić in sole command of NDH forces, and he ordered to continue fighting as the columns tried to reach the British forces to negotiate passage into Allied-occupied Austria. The British Army, however, refused them entry and turned them over to the Partisan forces. The Bleiburg repatriations from Austria resulted in mass executions. On 25 May 1945, the final battle of the Second World War in Europe, the Battle of Odžak, ended with the fall of the Independent State of Croatia, whose territory became part of the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia, and the demise of the Independent State of Croatia.

Meanwhile, Pavelić had detached from the group and fled to Austria, Italy, Argentina and finally Spain, where he would die in 1959. Several other members of the NDH government were captured in May and June 1945, and sentenced to death or long-term imprisonment in the trial of Mile Budak. The end of the war resulted in the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Yugoslavia, which later became the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, with the Constitution of 1946 officially making the People&#x27;s Republic of Croatia and the People&#x27;s Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina two of the six constituent republics of the new state.

===Aftermath===
Although far right movements in Croatia inspired by the former NDH reemerged during the Croatian War of Independence, the current Constitution of Croatia does not officially recognize the Independent State of Croatia as the historical or legitimate predecessor state of the current Croatian republic. Despite this, upon declaring independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, the Republic of Croatia rehabilitated the Croatian Home Guard, whose veterans have since received state pensions. German soldiers who died on Croatian territory were not commemorated until Germany and Croatia reached an agreement on marking their grave sites in 1996. The German War Graves Commission maintains two large cemeteries, in Zagreb and Split.

==Government==

The absolute leader of the NDH was Ante Pavelić, who was known by his Ustaše title, &quot;Poglavnik&quot;, throughout the war, regardless of his official government post. From 1941 to 1943, while the country was a &quot;de jure&quot; monarchy, Pavelić was its powerful Prime Minister (or &quot;President of the Government&quot;). After the capitulation of Italy, Pavelić became the head of state in the place of Aimone, Duke of Aosta (also known as Tomislav II) and retained the position of Prime Minister until September 1943, when he appointed Nikola Mandić to replace him.

===Monarchy===
Upon the formation of the NDH, Pavelić conceded to the accession of Aimone, the 4th Duke of Aosta, as a figurehead King of Croatia under his new royal name, Tomislav II. Tomislav II was not interested in being the figurehead King of Croatia, never actually visited the country and had no influence over the government. In the summer of 1941, Tomislav II declared that he would accept his position as King, only if certain demands were met:
#that he should be informed about all Italian activities on NDH territory;
#that his reign should be confirmed by the NDH Croatian State Parliament; and
#that politics should play no part in the Croatian armed forces.
The demands for German and Italian military departures were obviously impossible to be met by the Italian and German governments, and Tomislav II thus avoided taking up his position in Croatia. Aimone initially refused to assume the crown in opposition to the Italian annexation of the Croat-majority populated region of Dalmatia, however he later accepted the throne upon being pressured to do so by Victor Emmanuel III; however he never moved from Italy to reside in Croatia.
 Following the dismissal of Mussolini on 25 July 1943, Tomislav II abdicated on 31 July on the orders of Victor Emmanuel III. Shortly after the armistice with Italy in September 1943, Ante Pavelić declared that Tomislav II was no longer King of Croatia. Tomislav II formally renounced his title, &quot;King of Croatia, Prince of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Voivode of Dalmatia, Tuzla and Knin, Duke of Aosta (from 1942), Prince of Cisterna and of Belriguardo, Marquess of Voghera, and Count of Ponderano&quot;, in October 1943 after the birth of his son, Amedeo, to whom he gave, amongst his middle names, the name &#x27;Zvonimir&#x27;.

===Parliament===
The NDH Parliament was established by the &quot;Legal Decree on the Croatian State Parliament&quot; on 24 January 1942. The parliamentarians were not elected and meetings were convened just over a dozen times after the initial session in 1942. Its president was Marko Došen. This decree established five categories of individuals who would receive an invitation to be a member of parliament from the Ustaše-appointed government: (1) living Croatian representatives from the Croatian Parliament of 1918, (2) living Croatian representatives elected in the 1938 Yugoslavian election, (3) members of the Party of Rights prior to 1919, (4) certain officials of the Supreme Ustaše Headquarters and (5) two members of the German national assembly. The responsibility for assembling all eligible members of parliament was given to the head of the Supreme Court, Nikola Vukelić, who found 204 people to be eligible. In accordance with the decree, Vukelić ruled that those who had received the position of senator in 1939, had been part of Dušan Simović&#x27;s government, or had been part of the Yugoslav government-in-exile forfeited their eligibility. Two hundred and four people were declared eligible for the parliament, with 141 actually attending parliamentary meetings. Of the 204 eligible parliament members, 93 were members of the Croatian Peasant Party, 56 of whom attended meetings.

The Parliament was only a deliberatory body and was not empowered to enact legislation. However, during the eighth session of the parliament in February 1942, the Ustaše regime was put on the defensive when a joint Croatian Peasant Party-Croatian Party of Rights motion, supported by 39 members of parliament, questioned about the whereabouts of the Peasant Party&#x27;s leader Vladko Maček. The following session, Ante Pavelić responded that Maček was being kept in isolation to prevent him from coming into contact with Yugoslav government officials. In less than a month, Maček was moved from the Jasenovac concentration camp and put on house arrest at his property in Kupinec. Maček was later called upon by foreigners to take a stand and counteract the Pavelić government, but he refused. Maček fled the country in 1945, with the help of Ustaše General Ante Moškov. After its February 1942 session, the Parliament met only a few more times, and the decree was not renewed in 1943.

===Court system===
The NDH retained the court system of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, but restored the courts&#x27; names to their original forms. The state had 172 local courts (&quot;kotar&quot;), 19 district courts (&quot;judicial tables&quot;), an administrative court and an appellate court (&quot;Ban&#x27;s Table&quot;) in both Zagreb and Sarajevo, as well as a supreme court (Table of Seven) in Zagreb and a supreme court in Sarajevo. The state maintained men&#x27;s penitentiaries in Lepoglava, Hrvatska Mitrovica, Stara Gradiška and Zenica, and a women&#x27;s penitentiary in Zagreb.

===Military===

The NDH founded the Army of the Independent State of Croatia () and Navy of the Independent State of Croatia in April 1941 with the consent of the German armed forces (&quot;Wehrmacht&quot;). The task of the armed forces was to defend the state against both foreign and domestic enemies. The Army included an air force. The NDH also created the &quot;Ustaška Vojnica&quot; (Ustaše Militia) which was conceived as a party militia, and a gendarmerie. The Army was originally limited to 16 infantry battalions and 2 cavalry squadrons – 16,000 men in total. The original 16 battalions were soon enlarged to 15 infantry regiments of two battalions each between May and June 1941, organised into five divisional commands, some 55,000 men. Support units included 35 light tanks supplied by Italy, 10 artillery battalions (equipped with captured Royal Yugoslav Army weapons of Czech origin), a cavalry regiment in Zagreb and an independent cavalry battalion at Sarajevo. Two independent motorised infantry battalions were based at Zagreb and Sarajevo respectively. Under the terms of the Treaties of Rome (1941) with Italy, the NDH navy was restricted to a few coastal and patrol craft, which mostly patrolled inland waterways.

When established in 1941, the Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia () (ZNDH), consisted of captured Royal Yugoslav aircraft (seven operational fighters, 20 bombers and about 180 auxiliary and training aircraft) as well as paratroop, training and anti-aircraft artillery commands. During the course of World War II in Yugoslavia, it was supplemented with several hundred new or overhauled German, Italian and French fighters and bombers, until receiving the final deliveries of new aircraft from Germany in April 1945. The Croatian Air Force Legion (), or HZL, was a military unit of the Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia which fought alongside the Luftwaffe on the Eastern Front from 1941 to 1943 and then back on Croatian soil. The unit was sent to Germany for training on 15 July 1941 before heading to the Eastern Front. Many of the pilots and crews had previously served in the Royal Yugoslav Air Force during the Invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941. Some of them also had experience in the two main types that they would operate, the Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Dornier Do 17, with two fighter pilots having actually shot down Luftwaffe aircraft.

During operations over the Eastern Front, the unit&#x27;s fighters scored a total of 283 kills while its bombers participated in some 1,500 combat missions. Upon return to Croatia from December 1942, the unit&#x27;s aircraft proved a strong addition to the strike power of the Axis forces fighting the Partisans right up to the end of 1944. Because of low morale among army conscripts and their increasing disaffection with the Ustaša regime as the war progressed, the Partisans came to regard them as a key element in their supply line. According to William Deakin, who led one of the British missions to the Partisan commander-in-chief Josip Broz Tito, in some areas, Partisans would release army soldiers after disarming them, so they could come back into the field with replacement weapons, which would again be seized. Other army soldiers either defected or actively channelled supplies to the Partisansparticularly after the NDH ceded Dalmatia to Italy. Army troop numbers dwindled from 130,000 in early 1943 to 70,000 by late 1944, at which point the NDH government amalgamated the army with the Ustaše army and was organised into eighteen divisions, including artillery and armoured units. Despite these difficulties, the army, along with the German-commanded XV SS Cossack Cavalry Corps, was able to assist the Wehrmacht to hold its lines in Syrmia, Slavonia and Bosnia against the combined Soviet, Bulgarian and Partisan offensives from late 1944 to shortly before the NDH collapse in May 1945.

The Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia provided some level of air support (attack, fighter and transport) right up until May 1945, encountering and sometimes defeating opposing aircraft from the British Royal Air Force, United States Air Force and the Soviet Air Force. The final deliveries of up-to-date German Messerschmitt Bf 109G and K fighter aircraft were still taking place in April 1945. By the end of March 1945, it was obvious to the Croatian Army Command that, although the front remained intact, they would eventually be defeated by sheer lack of ammunition. For this reason, the decision was made to retreat into Austria, in order to surrender to the British forces advancing north from Italy. The German Army was in the process of disintegration and the supply system lay in ruins. However, the British, not having resources to accommodate non-German POWs, forced them to surrender to the Yugoslav Partisans. About 120,000 NDH troops surrendered that way, and about half of these were killed shortly afterward (see Bleiburg repatriations).

===Currency===
The NDH currency was the Independent State of Croatia kuna. The Croatian State Bank was the central bank, responsible for issuing currency. The kuna adhered to the gold standard at approximately 17.91 milligrams of fine gold per kuna. The State Bank authorized the exchange of defunct Yugoslav Dinar banknotes at par to kuna banknotes. Only Croat nationals could have held bank accounts in the NDH. On 10 December 1941, postal bank accounts belonging to Serbs, Jews and Gypsies were confiscated. From April 1941 to May 1945, there was a thirty-two-fold increase in the currency circulation across the NDH. Up until 1942, 7.55 billion Yugoslav dinars were replaced by the NDH kuna at an exchange rate of 1 dinar for 1 kuna. Afterwards, the government kept printing money and its amount in circulation increased rapidly, resulting in high inflation rates. By the end of 1943 there were 43.6 billion kunas in circulation and in August 1944, 76.8 billion kuna. Constant printing of money was a way of financing huge government spending, especially on the upkeep of German and Italian troops in the NDH, which could not be covered by increased taxation and long-term borrowing. The NDH inherited 42% or 32.5 million reichsmarks of the total debt which Yugoslavia owed to Germany. According to official data, the total debt of NDH on clearing accounts at the end of 1944 amounted to 969.8 million kunas.

On 6 May 1945, days prior to the dissolution of the NDH government, the Ustaše regime cleared out the vaults of the National Bank of Croatia, including the NDH gold reserve. In total, approximately 200 kilograms of gold bars, 12 thousand Napoléon gold coins, Turkish lira gold coins, two thousand gold plates, foreign banknotes worth several million kunas and diamonds of various sizes was taken.

===Railways===
The NDH formed the Croatian State Railways after the Yugoslav Railways was dissolved, and Serbian State Railways in Serbia was devolved. In May 1943, German authorities began deporting Croatian Jews from the NDH by cattle car to Auschwitz, where nearly all victims were gassed upon arrival.

== Zones of influence==
From 1941 to 1943, territory of the Independent State of Croatia was divided into German and Italian zones, sometimes described as zones of influence and sometimes as occupation zones:
*The German zone, which included the northeastern part of NDH, bordering Hungary in the north, German-occupied Serbia in the east, the Italian zone in the south, and Nazi Germany in the north-west. There, the German armed forces (&quot;Wehrmacht&quot;) exercised &quot;de facto&quot; control. 
*The Italian zone, which included the southwestern part of the NDH, bordering the German zone in the north-east, Italian-occupied Montenegro in the east, and Yugoslav territories annexed by Italy in the south-west.

After the capitulation of Italy in 1943, the Italian zone of influence was abolished and the German zone of influence was expanded to the whole Independent State of Croatia. At the same time, the NDH acquired control of northern Dalmatia (Split and Šibenik).

==Politics==
Under the Independent State of Croatia all parties but the Ustaše party were banned.

===Foreign relations===
The NDH was granted full recognition by the Axis Powers and by countries under Axis occupation, it was also recognized by Spain. The state maintained diplomatic missions in several countries, all in Europe. The countries that maintained embassies in Zagreb were Nazi Germany, Italy, Tiso&#x27;s Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Finland, Spain, and Japan. There were also consulates of Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, Denmark, Portugal, Argentina and Vichy France. Despite fears by the Yugoslav government-in-exile that the Soviet Union would establish diplomatic relations with the NDH after it broke diplomatic ties with Yugoslavia, full recognition by the Soviet Union never came to fruition.

In 1941, the country was admitted to the Universal Postal Union. On 10 August 1942 an agreement was signed at Brijuni which re-established the Society of Railways Danube-Sava-Adriatic between the Independent State of Croatia, Germany, Hungary and Italy. After the 11 December 1941 German declaration of war against the United States, the Independent State of Croatia declared war on the United States and the United Kingdom on 14 December. The Croatian Red Cross was established in 1941, with Kurt Hühn serving as its president. The NDH signed the Geneva Conventions on 20 January 1943, after which the International Committee of the Red Cross named Julius Schmidlin as its representative to the country.

==Genocide policies==
Historian Irina Ognyanova stated that the similarities between the NDH and the Third Reich included the assumption that terror and genocide were necessary for the preservation of the state. Michael Phayer explained that the genocide in Croatia began before the Nazis decided to kill Europe&#x27;s Jews, while Jonathan Steinberg stated that the crimes against Serbs in the NDH were the &quot;earliest total genocide to be attempted during the World War II&quot;. On the first day of his arrival in Zagreb, Ante Pavelić proclaimed a law that remained in effect during the entire period of the Independent State of Croatia. The law, which was enacted on 17 April 1941, declared that all people who offended, or tried to offend, the Croatian nation were guilty of treasona crime punishable by death. One day later, on 18 April, the first Croatian antisemitic racial law was published. This law did not create panic among the Jewish population, because they believed it was merely a continuation of the antisemitic laws of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, which were proclaimed in 1939. However, the situation quickly changed on 30 April, with the publication of the Aryan race laws. A notable part of the racial legislation was the religious conversion laws, the implications of which were not understood by the majority of the population when they were published on 3 May 1941. The implications became clear following the July speech of the minister of education, Mile Budak, in which he declared: &quot;We will kill one third of all Serbs. We will deport another third, and the rest of them will be forced to convert to Catholicism&quot;. Racial laws were enforced until 3 May 1945.

The NDH government cooperated with Nazi Germany in the Holocaust and exercised their own version of the genocide against ethnic Serbs living within their borders. State policy regarding Serbs was first declared in the words of Milovan Žanić, the minister of the NDH Legislative council on 2 May 1941: &quot;This country can only be a Croatian country, and there is no method we would hesitate to use in order to make it truly Croatian and cleanse it of Serbs, who have for centuries endangered us and who will endanger us again if they are given the opportunity.&quot; An estimated 320,000–340,000 Serbs, 30,000 Croatian Jews and 30,000 Roma were killed during the NDH, including between 77,000 and 99,000 Serbs, Bosniaks, Croats, Jews and Roma killed in the Jasenovac concentration camp while approximately 300,000 Serbs were forced out of the NDH.

Although the Ustase&#x27;s main target for persecution were Serbs, it also participated in the destruction of the Jewish and Roma populations. The NDH deviated from Nazi anti-Semitic policy by promising honorary Aryan citizenship to some Jews, if they were willing to enlist and fight for the NDH. Croatian historian Ivo Goldstein estimates that 135,000 Croats were also killed in the NDH, 70,000 as actual or suspected collaborators (killed by the Partisans) with 19,000 perishing in prisons or camps, as opponents of the Ustashe regime, and 46,000 killed as Partisans.

According to the 1931 and 1948 census, the Serb population declined in Croatia and increased in Bosnia:

Serbs in the NDH suffered among the highest casualty rates in Europe during the World War II. The political scientist Rudolph Rummel placed the NDH as one of the most lethal regimes in the 20th century in his book on &quot;democide&quot;. However, the historian Tomislav Dulić, in a critical analysis of Rummel&#x27;s estimates for Yugoslavia, said that they are in contrast with Yugoslav demographic research and are too high. Historian Stanley G. Payne claimed that direct and indirect executions by NDH regime were an &quot;extraordinary mass crime&quot;, which in proportionate terms exceeded any other European regime beside Hitler&#x27;s Third Reich. He added the crimes in the NDH were proportionately surpassed only by the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia and several of the extremely genocidal African regimes.

==Economy==

The economy of the Independent State of Croatia was largely subordinated to the economic interests of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, and had to meet significant obligations to them. The dominant power was Nazi Germany, which demanded supplies of raw materials from the NDH in order to support the German economy and its war effort. The Croatian workforce was also seen as a potential replacement for some of the German workers who had been recruited into the military and were sent off to war. An economic agreement signed in May 1941 provided Germany with unrestricted access to industrial raw materials in the NDH, and obligated the NDH to bear the costs of German military units stationed on its territory; this was a very large burden given the small size of the Croatian economy. Similar agreements were also concluded with Italy on a more short-term basis (they had to be renewed every three months), which obligated the NDH to support and resupply Italian army units within its borders, to make monthly payments to Italy, and to allow the Italian military to freely cut down trees for lumber.

The German and Italian authorities did not coordinate their respective policies towards Croatia, resulting in overlapping and conflicting demands which further burdened the Croatian economy. In particular, both Germany and Italy demanded large quantities of bauxite, iron ore, wood and grain. Edmund Glaise-Horstenau, the German Plenipotentiary General, blamed Italy for demanding too much from the NDH, while Galeazzo Ciano wrote in his diary that the Germans had such control over the NDH that the Croatian economy had become an Italian-German problem. Officially, the economy of the NDH was supposed to be reorganized into a new economic order inspired by the German model, which was to be a managed economy with strong involvement of the state in economic life. However, the new economic order remained only a theoretical goal, unrealized in practice.

Upon coming to power, the Ustaša had promised significant social and economic changes, in line with their ideology which held that the Croatian nation had been oppressed by Jews and Serbs, economically as well as politically. In 1942, economist Ante Frlić published a report on property ownership in the NDH, which argued that the country found itself in a difficult economic situation because most of the businesses were &quot;in the hands of the Jews, and many were in Serb hands too,&quot; while Croats only had small businesses. The &quot;foreign businesses&quot; – those owned by Jews or Serbs – were placed under the authority of state-appointed commissars, while Frlić called for a &quot;new morally based economic system&quot; that would meet the needs of the Croatian people and the army. The new economic system promised by the Ustaša was heavily inspired by Italian Fascist corporatism and went by several different names; Ustaše theoretician Aleksandar Seitz called it &quot;Croatian socialism&quot;. This idea was opposed to both communism and capitalism and &quot;attempted to create a psychic unity among the peasant in the village, the worker in the town, intellectuals in garrets, white-collar workers in offices, and warriors on the battlefield&quot;. Seitz declared that the aim was to bring together all classes and estates to work for the national community; this national community was held to be a concept opposed to both Marxists and capitalists, because &quot;the former knew only of classes, while the latter recognized only free markets.&quot; The desire to build a Croatian national community was seen as a part of a broader European national revolution that was opposed to the ideologies of the United States and the Soviet Union, two forces accused of seeking the &quot;levelling of all human cultures&quot;.

At the beginning of 1942 the government introduced compulsory work service for all citizens between the age of 18 and 25. Economic branches of which NDH had most revenue (collected through direct and indirect taxes) included industry, trade and crafts. Around 20% of state&#x27;s industrial enterprises accounted for wood industry. However, as the war progressed, industrial production in the territory of NDH was constantly decreasing, while inflation continued growing.

In 1942, 80% of NDH exports went to Germany (including Austria, Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia and the Polish General Government) and 12% to Italy. Germany covered 70% of imports, while Italy covered 25%. Other trade partners included Hungary, Romania, Finland, Serbia and Switzerland. Exports from NDH mainly consisted of lumber and wood products, agricultural products (including tobacco), livestock, ore, and strategically important bauxite. NDH mostly imported machinery, tools and other metal products, textiles and fuel.

===Role of Nazi Germany===
In the Independent State of Croatia, which Nazi Germany formally treated as a sovereign state, most, if not all, industrial and economic activity was either monopolized, or given a high priority for exploitation, by Germany. Agreements between the two governments in mid-1941 regulated foreign trade and payments and the export of Croatian labour to Germany. Germany already controlled a large number of industrial and mining enterprises in Croatia that were owned in part or in full by German citizens or citizens of German-occupied countries. Many other enterprises in Croatia, especially in the bauxite mining and timber industries, were leased to the Germans for the duration of the war. The Germans also held large interests in Croatian commercial banks, exercised either directly by banks in Berlin and Vienna, or indirectly, by German banks that had large interests in Prague and Budapest banks.

From the beginning, the Germans showed great interest in the high-quality iron ore mines of Ljubija in northwest Bosnia, in the industrial complex (steel, coal and heavy chemicals) in the Sarajevo–Tuzla–Zenica triangle in northeast Bosnia, and in bauxite. As the war advanced and German military involvement in Croatia expanded, more and more Croatian industry was put to work for the Germans. The bauxite mines in Hercegovina, Dalmatia and western Bosnia, were in the Italian zone of occupation, but their total production was earmarked for German needs for the duration of the war under the German-Italian agreement of 1941. Other Croatian industrial assets utilized by the Germans included the production of brown coal and lignite, cement (major plants in Zagreb and Split), oil and salt. Crude oil production, from fields to the east of Zagreb developed by the American Vacuum Oil Company, only started in November 1941 and never reached a high level, averaging a month in mid-1944. The most important commodities manufactured in Croatia for German use were prefabricated barracks (utilizing the large Croatian timber industry), clothing, dry-cell batteries, bridge construction parts and ammunition (grenades). The Vareš iron ore mine supplied the steel mill at Zenica, which had a capacity of 120,000 tons of steel annually. The Zenica mill, in turn, supplied the state arsenal in Sarajevo and the machinery and railroad car factory in Slavonski Brod, both of which produced various items for the Wehrmacht during the war, including grenades and shell casings. Some Vareš iron ore was also exported to Italy, Hungary and Romania.

===Italian role===
The region of the NDH controlled by Italy had few natural resources and little industry. There were some important timber stands, several cement plants, an aluminium plant at Lozovac, a carbide and chemical fertilizer plant at Dugi Rat, and a ferromanganese and cast iron plant near Šibenik, ship building operations in Split, a few brown coal mines supplying fuel to railways, shipping and industry, and rich bauxite fields.

==Demographics==
===Population===
According to data calculated by the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs during the creation of the state, the population was approximately 6,285,000 of which 3,300,000 (52.5%) were Croats, 1,925,000 (30.6%) were Serbs, 700,000 (11.1%) were Muslims, 150,000 (2.3%) Germans, 65,000 (1.0%) Czechs and Slovaks, 40,000 (0.6%) Jews, and 30,000 (0.4%) Slovenes. Croats comprised slightly over half of the population of the Independent State of Croatia. With Muslims treated as Croats, the Croat share of the total population was still less than two-thirds.

===Displacement of people===
A large number of people were displaced due to the internal fighting within Yugoslavia. The NDH had to accept more than 200,000 Slovenian refugees who were forcefully evicted from their homes as part of the German plan of annexing parts of the Slovenian territories. As part of this deal, the Ustaše were to deport 200,000 Serbs from Croatia military regions; however, only 182,000 had been deported when German high commander Bader stopped this mass transport of people because of the uprising of Chetniks and partisans in Serbia. An estimated 120,000 Serbs were deported from NDH to German-occupied Serbia, and 300,000 fled by 1943.

Internal colonization to the region of Slavonia was encouraged during this period from Dalmatia, Lika, Hrvatsko Zagorje and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The state maintained an Office of Colonization in Mostar, Osijek, Petrinja, Sarajevo, Sremska Mitrovica, and Zagreb.

==Culture==
Soon after the establishment of the NDH, the Yugoslav Academy of Science and Arts in Zagreb was renamed the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts. The country had four state theatres: in Zagreb, Osijek, Dubrovnik and Sarajevo. The Croatian State Theatre in Zagreb played host to the Berlin Philharmonic and the Teatro dell&#x27;Opera di Roma in the 1941–42 season. Volumes two to five of Mate Ujević&#x27;s &quot;Croatian Encyclopedia&quot; were published during this period. The Velebit Publishing House (&quot;Nakladna knjižara &quot;Velebit&quot;&quot;), named for the Velebit uprising, published pro-Axis works, including &quot;Japanac o Japanu&quot; [&quot;A Japanese on Japan&quot;] by the Japanese &quot;chargé d&#x27;affaires&quot;, Kazuichi Miura. The NDH was represented at the 1942 Venice Biennale, where the works of Joza Kljaković, Ivan Meštrović, Ante Motika, Ivo Režek, Bruno Bulić, Josip Crnobori, Antun Medić, Slavko Kopač and Slavko Šohaj were presented by Vladimir Kirin.

The existing University of Zagreb was renamed the Croatian University (), and was the only university in the NDH. The university established a pharmaceutical faculty in 1942, and a medical faculty in Sarajevo in 1944. It also opened the University Hospital Zagreb, which later became one of the largest hospitals in Croatia.

The state had two secular holidays; the anniversary of its establishment was commemorated on 10 April and the assassination of Stjepan Radić was commemorated on 20 June. In addition, the state granted holidays to several religious communities:

*The Catholic community celebrated New Year&#x27;s Day, Epiphany, the feast of the Presentation of the Lord, the feast of Saint Joseph, Easter, the feast of the Ascension of Jesus, Pentecost, the feast of Corpus Christi, the Assumption of Mary, the feast of All Saints, the feast of the Immaculate Conception, and Christmas.
*The Eastern Orthodox community celebrated New Year&#x27;s Day, the Epiphany, the feast of the Annunciation, Easter, the feast of the Ascension of Jesus, Pentecost, the Assumption of Mary, and Christmas, all according to the Roman calendar.
*The Evangelical community celebrated New Year&#x27;s Day, Holy Friday, Easter, the feast of the Ascension of Jesus, Pentecost, Reformation Day, Christmas Eve, and Christmas.
*The Muslim community celebrated Islamic New Year, Mevlud (Mawlid), Ramadan, and Kurban-Bajram (Eid al-Adha).

The state film institute, &quot;Hrvatski slikopis&quot;, produced many films, including &quot;Straža na Drini&quot; and &quot;Lisinski&quot;. The Croatian cinema pioneer Oktavijan Miletić, was active during this period. In 1943, Zagreb hosted the I. International Congress for Narrow Film.

On 29 April 1941 the &quot;Decree on building Croatian workers&#x27; family homes&quot; was issued which resulted in the development of so-called &quot;Pavelić neighbourhoods&quot; in the state&#x27;s larger northern cities: Karlovac, Osijek, Sisak, Varaždin, and Zagreb. The neighbourhoods were largely based on similar workers housing in Germany. They are characterized by their wide avenues and lots, and for largely being made up of semi-detached homes.

===Media===
The official publication of the government was the &quot;Narodne novine&quot; (Official Gazette). Dailies included Zagreb&#x27;s &quot;Hrvatski narod&quot; (Croatian Nation), Osijek&#x27;s &quot;Hrvatski list&quot; (Croatian Paper) and Sarajevo&#x27;s &quot;Novi list&quot; (New Paper). The state&#x27;s news agency was called the Croatian News Office &quot;Croatia&quot; (Hrvatski dojavni ured &quot;Croatia&quot;), which took on the role formerly performed by the Avala news agency in Yugoslavia. After the war&#x27;s end, out of 330 registered journalists in the state, 38 were executed, 131 emigrated, and 100 were banned from working as journalists in the Federal People&#x27;s Republic of Yugoslavia.

The state&#x27;s main radio station was Hrvatski Krugoval, known before the war as Radio Zagreb. The NDH increased the transmitter&#x27;s power to 10 kW. The radio station was based in Zagreb, but had branches in Banja Luka, Dubrovnik, Osijek and Sarajevo. It maintained cooperation with the International Broadcasting Union.

===Sport===
The most popular sport in the NDH was football, which had its own league system, with the highest level known as the Zvonimir Group, with eight teams in 1942–1943 and 1943–1944. Top clubs included Građanski Zagreb, Concordia Zagreb and HAŠK. The Croatian Football Federation was accepted into FIFA on 17 July 1941.

The NDH national football team played 14 friendly matches against other Axis nations and puppet states between June 1941 and April 1944, winning five.

The NDH had other national teams. The Croatian Handball Federation organized a national handball league, and a national team. Its boxing team was led by African-American Jimmy Lyggett.

The Croatian Table-Tennis Association organized a national competition as well as a national team which participated in a few international matches. The Croatian Olympic Committee was recognized as a special member of the International Olympic Committee, with Franjo Bučar acting as its representative.

The Croatian Skiing Association organized a national championship, held on Zagreb&#x27;s Sljeme mountain. A national bowling competition was held in 1942 in Zagreb, which was won by Dušan Balatinac.

<text>The Worshipful Company of Fuellers is one of the livery companies of the City of London. It is now associated with the whole energy sector, but has its roots in coal: the fuellers, or coal traders, were originally members of the Woodmongers&#x27; Company, which became defunct in the eighteenth century. The company was incorporated separately in 1981, and was granted livery status in 1984, and a royal charter in 2009. It is a charitable institution and many of the members (though not all) are drawn from the energy industry. As such, membership is not limited to energy sector employees, but also to those whose interests can make a contribution on energy matters.

The company&#x27;s activities include a social programme (livery dinners, &quot;etc&quot;), as well as regular industrial visits and talks.

The Fuellers&#x27; Company ranks ninety-fifth in the order of precedence of livery companies. It has made submissions to the government&#x27;s energy policy review, details of which can be found on its website.

<text>These are terms used in the Chinese martial art, Wing Chun. They are originally colloquial Cantonese (or Foshan spoken dialect). Thus, their meanings might be difficult to trace. Some of those terms are used in Jeet Kune Do, sometimes with a different meaning.

==Forms==
*Siu Nim Tau () A small form holding the main ideas of the system. It emphasizes proper structure, occupying the centerline, and deflecting away from the centerline. It is purely handwork with no footwork. Other than basic training, at the advanced level it is often used as a qigong form to develop &quot;nim ging&quot; or idea power. 
*Chum Kiu (). This form fleshes out the static Siu Nim Tau form and makes it alive and realistic by adding turns, elbows, stepping, and kicks. 
*Biu Ji (). A form that emphasizes emergency hands, techniques that are used to regain the centerline when one is put in a bad position. Reminiscent of the Chinese compass, aka the &#x27;south pointing needle&#x27; 指南針. This form has no kicks.
*Muk Yan Jong (). A form more like traditional Chinese martial arts. It combines elements of Siu Nim Tao hand play with side stepping and kicks to facilitate throws and sweeps, as well as attacking from the side gate. 
*Butterfly swords: Bat Cham Do (). The butterfly swords are the natural extension arms and of the Wing Chun system as a whole, using most of the same hand play and structures as the empty hand forms. The extra danger of handling dual blades is overcome by the long practice of the hand techniques. One could say everything in the Wing Chun system leads up to their usage. 
*Staff: Luk Dim Bun Gwan (). A simple staff form for handling a long pole or spear. Due to the nature of the long weapon, the 6.5 Point Staff form is very different from typical Wing Chun body structures thus far, expanding the system into more traditionally Chinese deeply squatted structures and using the side body stance.

<doc id="375941" wikidata="Q1122267" url="?curid=375941" title="Computer Graphics Metafile">
<text>Computer Graphics Metafile (CGM) is a free and open international standard file format for 2D vector graphics, raster graphics, and text, and is defined by [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 8632.

==Overview==
All graphical elements can be specified in a textual source file that can be compiled into a binary file or one of two text representations. CGM provides a means of graphics data interchange for computer representation of 2D graphical information independent from any particular application, system, platform, or device.

As a metafile, i.e., a file containing information that describes or specifies another file, the CGM format has numerous elements to provide functions and to represent entities, so that a wide range of graphical information and geometric primitives can be accommodated. Rather than establish an explicit graphics file format, CGM contains the instructions and data for reconstructing graphical components to render an image using an object-oriented approach.

Although CGM is not widely supported for web pages and has been supplanted by other formats in the graphic arts, it is still prevalent in engineering, aviation, and other technical applications.

The initial CGM implementation was effectively a streamed representation of a sequence of Graphical Kernel System (GKS) primitive operations. It has been adopted to some extent in the areas of technical illustration and professional design, but has largely been superseded by formats such as SVG and DXF.

The World Wide Web Consortium has developed WebCGM, a profile of CGM intended for the use of CGM on the Web.

<text>DHL (originally named after Dalsey, Hillblom and Lynn) is a multinational logistics brand, founded in the United States and headquartered in Bonn, Germany. It provides courier, package delivery, and express mail service, delivering over 1.7 billion parcels per year. A subsidiary and the namesake of DHL Group, its express mail service DHL Express is one of the market leaders for parcel services in Europe. DHL also operates a separate parcel service targeting the German consumer market in conjunction with Deutsche Post.

The company DHL itself was founded in San Francisco, United States in 1969 and expanded its service throughout the world by the late 1970s. DHL is an initialism of the surnames of the original company&#x27;s founders.

The company was primarily interested in offshore and intercontinental deliveries, but the success of FedEx prompted DHL&#x27;s own domestic (intra-US) expansion starting in 1983. In 1998, Deutsche Post began to acquire shares in DHL. It reached controlling interest in 2001, and acquired all outstanding shares by December 2002. The company then absorbed DHL into its Express division, while expanding the use of the DHL brand to other Deutsche Post divisions, business units, and subsidiaries. Today, DHL Express shares its DHL brand with business units such as DHL Global Forwarding and DHL Supply Chain. It gained a foothold in the United States when it acquired Airborne Express in 2003.

==History==



===Origins===
While Larry Hillblom was studying law at University of California, Berkeley&#x27;s Boalt Hall School of Law in the late 1960s, he accepted a job as a courier for the insurance company Michael&#x27;s, Poe &amp; Associates (MPA). He started running courier duty between Oakland International Airport and Los Angeles International Airport, picking up packages for the last flight of the day, and returning on the first flight the next morning, up to five times a week.

After he graduated, Hillblom met with MPA salesman Adrian Dalsey and they planned to expand MPA&#x27;s concept of fast delivery to other business enterprises. They flew between Honolulu and San Francisco, transporting bills of lading for their first client, Seatrain Lines.

====Name origins====
Hillblom put up a portion of his student loans to start the company, bringing in his two friends Adrian Dalsey and Robert Lynn as partners, with the combined initials of their surnames as the company name (DHL). They shared a Plymouth Duster that they drove around San Francisco to pick up the documents in suitcases, then rushed to the airport to book flights using another relatively new invention, the corporate credit card. As the business took off, they started hiring new couriers to join the company. Their first hires were Max and Blanche Kroll, whose apartment in Hawaii often became a makeshift flophouse for their couriers.

===Domestic expansion===
In the 1970s, DHL became an international delivery company, similar to Loomis and Purolator who were the only other international courier companies at the time. In 1979, under the name of &quot;DHL Air Cargo&quot;, the company entered the Hawaiian Islands with an inter-island cargo service using two Douglas DC-3 and four DC-6 aircraft. Adrian Dalsey and Larry Hillblom personally oversaw the daily operations until its eventual bankruptcy closed the doors in 1983. At its peak, &quot;DHL Air Cargo&quot; employed just over 100 workers, management and pilots.

The only major competitor in the overnight market was Federal Express (FedEx), which did not open its first international service until 1981, expanding to Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Nevertheless, the domestic market was extremely profitable, and DHL was the third largest courier behind FedEx and UPS.

===Deutsche Post purchase===
Deutsche Post began to acquire shares in DHL in 1998, acquiring a controlling interest in 2001. By the end of 2002, Deutsche Post had acquired all of DHL&#x27;s remaining stock, and absorbed the operation into its Express division. The DHL brand was expanded to other Deutsche Post divisions, business units and subsidiaries. Today, DHL Express shares its DHL brand with other Deutsche Post business units, such as DHL Global Forwarding, DHL Freight, DHL Supply Chain, and DHL Global Mail. In 1999, Deutsche Post World Net (DPWN) purchased the Belgian shipping company Van Gend &amp; Loos as well as Swiss freight forwarder Danzas. In 2001, Deutsche Post acquired a majority (51%) of DHL&#x27;s shares, and the remaining 49% in 2002. The new DHL was launched by merging the old DHL, Danzas, and Securicor Omega Euro Express. The Packstation, an automated delivery booth, was introduced as a pilot project in Dortmund and Mainz.

=== 2000–2010 ===

DHL Airways, Inc., which handled all US domestic flights, was renamed ASTAR Air Cargo in 2003, following a management buyout. DHL&#x27;s airline had over 550 pilots in service in October 2008. In August 2003, Deutsche Post acquired Airborne Express and began its integration into DHL.

A planned expansion by DHL at Brussels Airport created a political crisis in Belgium in 2004. On 21 October 2004, DHL Express announced that it planned to move its European hub from Brussels to Leipzig, Germany (Vatry, France, was also considered but rejected). DHL&#x27;s unions called a strike in response and paralyzed work for a day.

On 8 November 2004, DHL Express invested €120 million in an Indian domestic courier, Blue Dart, becoming the majority shareholder in the company.

In 2005, Deutsche Post made an offer to buy the contract logistics company Exel plc, which had just acquired Tibbett &amp; Britten Group. On 14 December 2005, Deutsche Post announced the completion of the acquisition of Exel. DHL integrated Exel into its logistics division, rebranding the division&#x27;s services as DHL Exel Supply Chain. Following that acquisition, DHL had a global workforce of 285,000 people (500,000 people including DPWN and other sister companies) and roughly $65 billion in annual sales.

In 2006, DHL won a ten-year contract worth £1.6 billion to run the NHS Supply Chain, part of the United Kingdom&#x27;s National Health Service. Under the contract, DHL was responsible for providing logistics services for over 500,000 products to support 600 hospitals and other health providers in the UK.

In a 50/50 joint venture with Lufthansa Cargo, DHL Express co-founded a new cargo airline, AeroLogic, in 2007, based at Leipzig/Halle Airport. The carrier operated up to 11 Boeing 777F planes by 2012. In December 2007, DHL became the first carrier to transport cargo via wind-powered ships, flying MS Beluga Skysails kites.

As part of the NHS contract, DHL opened a new distribution centre in 2008 to act as a stock-holding hub for food and other products, with another distribution centre planned for opening in 2012. The two new distribution centres created about 1,000 new jobs.

In May 2008, DHL Aviation moved its European hub from Brussels Airport to Leipzig/Halle, leading to a significant increase in cargo traffic at the airport. In the same month, DHL Express announced restructuring plans for its United States network, including termination of its business relationship with ABX Air and a new contract with competitor UPS for air freight operations. Its cargo hub was also shifted from Wilmington to Louisville. The Air Line Pilots Association, International protested, but on 10 November 2008, DHL announced that it was cutting 9,500 jobs as it discontinued domestic air and ground operations within the United States due to economic uncertainty. However, it retained international services and was still in talks with UPS to transport DHL packages between U.S. airports.

In October 2008, two DHL Express Middle East senior executives, David Giles and Jason Bresler, were assassinated in Kabul by one of their own Afghan employees; they received military honors from the U.S. military, the first of such kind in Afghanistan.

DHL ended domestic pickup and delivery service in the United States in 2009, effectively leaving UPS and FedEx as the two major express parcel delivery companies in the US. Limited domestic service was still available from DHL, with the packages tendered to USPS for local delivery. In April 2009, UPS announced that DHL and UPS had terminated negotiations without an agreement for UPS to provide airlift for DHL packages between airports in North America. DHL said in a statement, &quot;We have not been able to come to a conclusive agreement that is acceptable to both parties.&quot; DHL continued to use its current air cargo providers, ASTAR Air Cargo and ABX Air.

===2011–present===
The company sold its UK B2B and B2C domestic parcel operations in 2010 to British delivery company Home Delivery Network, since renamed Yodel.

In 2013, the company opened a newly expanded and upgraded global hub at the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport in Hebron, Kentucky. On 1 November 2013, it sold its UK domestic same-day operations to British courier Rico Logistics but continued to offer time and day definite domestic services as well as international services in the UK.

In late 2020, DHL entered agreements to deliver the COVID-19 vaccine manufactured by BioNTech and Pfizer.

In March 2021, DHL Aviation announced the relocation of hub operations from Bergamo to Milan Malpensa Airport where DHL opened new logistics facilities.

In October 2021, DHL said that it would raise its rates for customers in the United States by an average of 5.9 percent, starting on January 1, 2022.

==Services==
DHL Express&#x27;s global headquarters are part of the Deutsche Post headquarters in Bonn. Headquarters for North America are located in Guadalajara, Mexico, and Plantation, Florida, while its Asia–Pacific and emerging markets headquarters are located in Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, and mainland China. The European hub is in Leipzig, Germany. Most of DHL Express&#x27;s business is incorporated as DHL International GmbH.

Major competitors include FedEx, UPS, and national post carriers such as United States Postal Service (USPS) and Royal Mail. However, DHL has a minor partnership with the USPS, which allows DHL to deliver small packages to the recipient through the USPS network known as DHL Global Mail, now known as DHL eCommerce. It is also the sole provider for transferring USPS mail in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan.

DHL offers worldwide services, including deliveries to countries such as Iraq, Afghanistan and Myanmar (formerly Burma). As it is German-owned, DHL is not affected by U.S. embargoes or sanctions and will ship to Cuba and North Korea. However, there are strict codes for delivering to North Korea, as the country has shaky relations with the West.

==Environmental record==
As of 2007, DHL took measures to control their environmental footprint by the use of alternative fuel vehicles. DHL changed vehicles in certain delivery fleets in order to use alternative fuels. Certain new vehicles used compressed natural gas.

=== Use of electric vehicles ===

In December 2014, Deutsche Post DHL purchased the StreetScooter company, a small manufacturer of electric vehicles as part of its long-term goal to reach zero emissions in its delivery operations. By year end 2016, some 2,000 vehicles had been produced.

In 2016, BYD supplied DHL with electric distribution fleet of commercial BYD T3, which provided daily logistics in the Central Business District (CBD) of Shenzhen and surrounding areas.

As of 2016, electric vans with a much greater range were to be required to achieve the long-term goal of replacing the entire Deutsche Post and DHL Express fleet of approximately 70,000 vehicles with StreetScooter models.

In 2022, DHL equipped 67 trucks in the US with TRAILAR solar mats, which power lift gates and other equipment for fuel savings.

As of 2017 the Deutsche Post/DHL GoGreen program planned to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and local air pollutants; The long-term goal, summarized by Frank Appel, chief executive officer, was more aggressive. &quot;From now until 2050, our mission will be to drive our business toward zero [logistics related] emissions. We are setting the standard for the future of the transport sector and doing our part to help the world community reach its goal of limiting global warming to less than two degrees Celsius.&quot;

==Animal rights activist protest==
On 16 September 2005, DHL won a High Court injunction establishing an exclusion zone around each of its 288 buildings in the UK as well as the homes of its 18,000 UK employees. The firm has been the subject of a campaign of intimidation because of their business with Huntingdon Life Sciences. The judge banned protesters from coming within of any DHL premises or the homes of their employees as well as any organized demonstration within unless the police had been given four hours&#x27; notice. The injunction also protects anyone doing business with DHL from intimidation.

<text>The True Whig Party (TWP), also known as the Liberian Whig Party (LWP), is the oldest political party in Liberia and Africa as a whole. Founded in 1869 by primarily darker-skinned Americo-Liberians in rural areas, its historic rival was the Republican Party. Following the decline of the latter, it dominated Liberian politics from 1878 until 1980. The nation was virtually governed as a one-party state under the TWP, although opposition parties were never outlawed.

Initially, its ideology was strongly influenced by that of the United States Whig Party (from which it took its name). The elephant mascot was taken from the Republican Party, the successor of the Whigs. Much of the TWP&#x27;s support came from the Americo-Liberian community who held an influential position over Liberian politics and society. The TWP&#x27;s long term leader and President William Tubman was widely regarded as the father of modern Liberia.

The TWP fell out of power following the 1980 Liberian coup d&#x27;état in which many of its leading members died or fled, ending its dominant position. The TWP ceased to be officially recognized following the coup, although it was never disbanded and continued as a rump party. The party went on to participate in the unsuccessful Coalition for the Transformation of Liberia (COTOL) ahead of the 2005 general election before de-coalition and winning fewer votes at the 2017 elections. In 2020 it became part of the Rainbow Alliance (RA).

==History==
The True Whig Party was founded in the township of Clay-Ashland in 1869 as a reorganised version of the Opposition Party. It presided over a society in which black American settlers and their descendants, known as Americo-Liberians, though a small minority of the population, constituted nearly 100% of the citizens able to vote. It primarily represented them, often working in tandem with the Masonic Order of Liberia.

The True Whig Party was initially formed as an alliance of &quot;mostly dark-skinned upriver planters and the dark-skinned faction among
the coastal merchants&quot;, opposed to the lighter-skinned mulatto elite represented by the Republican Party. The party first came to power after Edward James Roye won the 1869 Liberian general election and was sworn in as president the following year. The Republican Party had tended to be supported by Americo-Liberians of mixed African and European ancestry while darker skinned Americo-Liberians initially rallied around the TWP, however as the Republican Party began to decline in influence most Americo-Liberians transferred their support to the TWP.

After Anthony W. Gardiner was elected president in 1878, the TWP went on to govern Liberia for over a century. While opposition parties were never made illegal and Liberia was not classed as a dictatorship, the TWP more or less ran the country as a one party state and held a monopoly on Liberian politics.

The party was accused of endorsing systems of forced labor. In 1930 they sent &quot;contract migrant laborers&quot;, under conditions tantamount to slavery, to Spanish colonists on Fernando Pó in Spanish Guinea (now Bioko in Equatorial Guinea). This led to an investigation by the League of Nations, a five-year U.S. and British boycott of Liberia followed by the resignation of President Charles D. B. King. Despite this dispute, the West generally considered the True Whig Party as a stabilizing, unthreatening force in the period after. The US and Britain later invested extensively in the nation under William Tubman&#x27;s long period of rule (1944–1971).

Under the leadership and Presidency of William Tubman, the TWP took a pro-American stance in international policy, encouraged foreign investment, promoted industrialization and embarked on a mass modernization program of Liberia&#x27;s domestic infrastructure. This led to a period of economic prosperity during the 1960s, was credited with putting Liberia on the map and establishing the country as a modern power in Africa. Although opponents of Tubman&#x27;s government accused it of being authoritarian, Liberia was widely regarded internationally as being a stable and successful nation in the region whilst other African states were undergoing civil wars and political strife.

Following Tubman&#x27;s death in 1971, the TWP leadership and Presidency was taken over by William Tolbert. Tolbert diverted from the TWP&#x27;s traditional policies by seeking to stress Liberian sovereignty and political independence, as opposed to a nation reliant on international businesses and governments. He initiated some socially liberal reforms, pledged stricter regulation of foreign businesses operating in Liberia, granted official recognition status to opposition parties and tried to re-balance economic disparities between Americo-Liberians and native ethnic tribes. He also pursued open diplomatic and economic relationships with the Soviet Union and shifted Liberia&#x27;s focus to other African nations as opposed to the West. However, some of these reforms were reversed following the &quot;Maryland County ritual killings&quot; and the Rice Riots in which Tolbert called for the arrest of opposition leaders. Opposition parties also accused Tolbert of using corruption and political nepotism to retain power while traditionalist members of the TWP and some of Tolbert&#x27;s cabinet were angered by his initiative of appointing native Liberians into government positions which they saw as usurping their position.

The party lost power after Tolbert was killed in a military coup on 12 April 1980 by a group of AFL soldiers led by Samuel Doe, who formed the People&#x27;s Redemption Council (PRC). They had opposed Tolbert&#x27;s clampdown on the political opposition and what they saw as his tolerance of corruption. Many high-ranking officials of the TWP such as E. Reginald Townsend, Frank E. Tolbert (William&#x27;s brother) and Cecil Dennis were executed, depleting much of its executive leadership whilst others fled the country. The new government subsequently restricted activities of the TWP and it lost its official status; the vast majority of its members and supporters left the party, but other TWP members vowed to continue and it struggled on as a minor rump party without official recognition. Members of indigenous groups began to exert more political power following the coup, in keeping with their dominance in number of the national population, further diminishing the TWP&#x27;s support which had come from the formerly more influential but demographically smaller Americo-Liberian population. Doe&#x27;s government also realigned Liberia&#x27;s foreign policy back to a pro-US position, making it harder to gain international recognition as an opposition group with fears over communist expansionism and the rise of Soviet backed client regimes in Africa during the Cold War. In 1985, all political opposition (including the TWP) were banned following a coup attempt against Doe.

==Legacy==
In 1991, the party faced a challenge from a new group, which identified as the &quot;National True Whig Party of Liberia.&quot; TWP chairman Momo Fahnbulleh Jones threatened legal action to induce the newly founded party to change its name.

The TWP was officially reconstituted in 2005 under the leadership of Peter Vuku.

The TWP participated in the 2005 general election as part of the Coalition for the Transformation of Liberia (COTOL). The COTOL coalition won eight seats but was dissolved the next year after some of its members left to join the ruling Unity Party. The TWP registered to compete as an individual party for the House of Representatives in the 2011 general election, while endorsing President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf&#x27;s bid for a second term at Presidential level. However, the party had strife over its leadership five months before the election, and it failed to nominate any candidate for any legislative seat and did not compete as a result.

In 2013, members of the TWP became embroiled in a dispute over Edward J. Roye Building in Monrovia which had been constructed as the party headquarters. The building had been appropriated by the Liberian General Services Agency which provoked anger among TWP members who stated they are still the rightful owners and that Chairman of the Council of State David D. Kpormakpor had decreed that it should be returned to the TWP&#x27;s possession.

In 2015, the TWP appointed former government information minister Reginald Goodridge as its new chairman and was successfully registered to stand as an individual party for the 2017 election but ended up gaining 0.96% of the vote.

On August 31, 2020, a political alliance containing seven constituent parties, including the TWP, known as the Rainbow Alliance (RA) was certified by the National Elections Commission (NEC). Goodridge served as the interim chairman of the alliance. The RA unsuccessfully contested the 2020 Senate elections with 10 candidates. The RA held its first national convention on October 29, 2022, in Paynesville. Interim Chairman Goodridge was elected standard bearer. The RA did not run a candidate in the 2023 presidential election. The RA unsuccessfully ran candidates in various 2023 legislative elections.

==Ideology==
The True Whig Party initially sought to emulate the policies of the American Whig Party (from which it took its name) and the philosophy of Whiggism. The TWP was also described as promoting conservatism and black conservatism in the twentieth century during Tubman&#x27;s rule. 

Although the party favored protectionism in its early years, it later pursued deregulation, free-market and economically liberal policies known as the &quot;&quot; (&quot;open door&quot;) under Tubman to attract investment and stimulate growth. 

In terms of foreign policy, the TWP took a pro-Western and particularly pro-American stance owing to the fact much of the TWP&#x27;s support and membership came from the Americo-Liberian population. Although Liberia did not declare war on Germany and Japan until 1944, the party supported the Allies against the Axis powers during the Second World War. 

Under Tubman, the party was also anti-communist during the height of the Cold War. It later supported America&#x27;s foreign policy during the Vietnam War and maintained friendly relations with the state of Israel. In November 1947, Liberia had been among African governments which voted &quot;Yes&quot; for the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, a vote which implied acceptance of the Zionist Movement&#x27;s aspiration to create an independent sovereign nation (the State of Israel) as a Jewish-dominant state. 

Under the leadership of William Tolbert (who sought to stress Liberia&#x27;s political independence), the ruling TWP shifted away from a pro-Western stance to a neutral posture by fostering partnerships with other African states and opening up relationships with the Soviet Union, China and Eastern Bloc nations, pursuing liberal domestic policies and attempting to bring more native Liberians into governing circles.

These ideological changes caused consternation among both TWP supporters and politicians in Tolbert&#x27;s administration.

<text>The Fundamental Methodist Conference, is a Methodist denomination of Christianity. It organized in 1942.

It holds its annual conference at the Fundamental Methodist Conference Grounds near Ash Grove in Lawrence County, Missouri, where it hosts an active youth camp ministry. This body is a member of the American Council of Christian Churches.

The denomination publishes &quot;The Evangelical Methodist&quot; in conjunction with the likeminded Evangelical Methodist Church of America.

==Background==

The Fundamental Methodist Conference was instituted at Ash Grove, Missouri, in 1942 under the name Independent Fundamental Methodist Church. The title was changed to Fundamental Methodist Church, Inc., when the first annual conference was held in 1944.

The Fundamental Methodist Conference traces its origins through the Methodist Protestant Church to the Anglican reformation and evangelical awakening of the Wesley brothers, John and Charles. The three major Methodist conferences in the United States – the Methodist Episcopal Church, Methodist Episcopal Church, South, and the Methodist Protestant churches – united under the name The Methodist Church in 1939. The union was attended with dissatisfaction among certain people in all three groups. The John&#x27;s Chapel Church (formerly part of the Methodist Protestant Church) of Lawrence County, Missouri, withdrew from The Methodist Church on August 27, 1942, and elected a committee to draw up a constitution and by-laws for fundamental Methodists. On August 23, 1944, the first annual conference was held in Greene County, Missouri, with three churches representing. The denomination was chartered on February 27, 1948.

Unlike most other Methodists, the churches of the Fundamental Methodist Conference do not baptize infants, though the dedication of children is retained. They only observe the mode of immersion for baptism. Since they do not regard baptism as initiation to the universal church, they will receive members from other churches who have been baptized by sprinkling or pouring. Government is more congregational and less connectional than generally practiced by other Methodists (though some other Methodist denominations, such as the Congregational Methodist Church, have a congregational polity). Each congregation owns its property and calls its pastors. The church has no bishops; the Annual Conference elects a District Superintendent and a Secretary-Treasurer.
