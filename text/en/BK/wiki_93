<text>Shiing-Shen Chern (; , ; October 28, 1911 – December 3, 2004) was a Chinese American mathematician and poet. He made fundamental contributions to differential geometry and topology. He has been called the &quot;father of modern differential geometry&quot; and is widely regarded as a leader in geometry and one of the greatest mathematicians of the twentieth century, winning numerous awards and recognition including the Wolf Prize and the inaugural Shaw Prize. In memory of Shiing-Shen Chern, the International Mathematical Union established the Chern Medal in 2010 to recognize &quot;an individual whose accomplishments warrant the highest level of recognition for outstanding achievements in the field of mathematics.&quot;

Chern worked at the Institute for Advanced Study (1943–45), spent about a decade at the University of Chicago (1949-1960), and then moved to University of California, Berkeley, where he cofounded the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute in 1982 and was the institute&#x27;s founding director. Renowned coauthors with Chern include Jim Simons, an American mathematician and billionaire hedge fund manager. Chern&#x27;s work, most notably the Chern-Gauss-Bonnet Theorem, Chern–Simons theory, and Chern classes, are still highly influential in current research in mathematics, including geometry, topology, and knot theory, as well as many branches of physics, including string theory, condensed matter physics, general relativity, and quantum field theory.

==Name spelling==
Chern&#x27;s surname (陳/陈, pinyin: Chén) is a common Chinese surname which is now usually romanized as Chen. The spelling &quot;Chern&quot; is from the Gwoyeu Romatzyh (GR) romanization system. In English, Chern pronounced his own name as &quot;Churn&quot; ().

== Biography ==
=== Early years in China ===
Chern was born in Xiushui, Jiaxing, China in 1911. He graduated from Xiushui Middle School () and subsequently moved to Tianjin in 1922 to accompany his father. In 1926, after spending four years in Tianjin, Chern graduated from .

At age 15, Chern entered the Faculty of Sciences of the Nankai University in Tianjin and was interested in physics, but not so much the laboratory, so he studied mathematics instead. Chern graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1930. At Nankai, Chern&#x27;s mentor was mathematician Jiang Lifu, and Chern was also heavily influenced by Chinese physicist Rao Yutai, considered to be one of the founding fathers of modern Chinese informatics.

Chern went to Beijing to work at the Tsinghua University Department of Mathematics as a teaching assistant. At the same time he also registered at Tsinghua Graduate School as a student. He studied projective differential geometry under Sun Guangyuan, a University of Chicago-trained geometer and logician who was also from Zhejiang. Sun is another mentor of Chern who is considered a founder of modern Chinese mathematics. In 1932, Chern published his first research article in the Tsinghua University Journal. In the summer of 1934, Chern graduated from Tsinghua with a master&#x27;s degree, the first ever master&#x27;s degree in mathematics issued in China.

Yang Chen-Ning&#x27;s father, , another Chicago-trained professor at Tsinghua, but specializing in algebra, also taught Chern. At the same time, Chern was Chen-Ning Yang&#x27;s teacher of undergraduate maths at Tsinghua. At Tsinghua, Hua Luogeng, also a mathematician, was Chern&#x27;s colleague and roommate.

In 1932, Wilhelm Blaschke from the University of Hamburg visited Tsinghua and was impressed by Chern and his research.

=== 1934–1937 in Europe ===
In 1934, Chern received a scholarship to study in the United States at Princeton and Harvard, but at the time he wanted to study geometry and Europe was the center for the maths and sciences.

He studied with the well-known Austrian geometer Wilhelm Blaschke. Co-funded by Tsinghua and the Chinese Foundation of Culture and Education, Chern went to continue his study in mathematics in Germany with a scholarship.

Chern studied at the University of Hamburg and worked under Blaschke&#x27;s guidance first on the geometry of webs then on the Cartan-Kähler theory and invariant theory. He would often eat lunch and chat in German with fellow colleague Erich Kähler.

He had a three-year scholarship but finished his degree very quickly in two years. He obtained his &quot;Dr. rer.nat.&quot; (&quot;Doctor of Science&quot;, which is equivalent to PhD) degree in February, 1936. He wrote his thesis in German, and it was titled &quot;Eine Invariantentheorie der Dreigewebe aus formula_1-dimensionalen Mannigfaltigkeiten im formula_2&quot; (English: &quot;An invariant theory of 3-webs of formula_1-dimensional manifolds in formula_2&quot;).

For his third year, Blaschke recommended Chern to study at the University of Paris.

It was at this time that he had to choose between the career of algebra in Germany under Emil Artin and the career of geometry in France under Élie-Joseph Cartan. Chern was tempted by what he called the &quot;organizational beauty&quot; of Artin&#x27;s algebra, but in the end, he decided to go to France in September 1936.

He spent one year at the Sorbonne in Paris. There he met Cartan once a fortnight. Chern said:Usually the day after [meeting with Cartan] I would get a letter from him. He would say, “After you left, I thought more about your questions...”—he had some results, and some more questions, and so on. He knew all these papers on simple Lie groups, Lie algebras, all by heart. When you saw him on the street, when a certain issue would come up, he would pull out some old envelope and write something and give you the answer. And sometimes it took me hours or even days to get the same answer... I had to work very hard.In August 1936, Chern watched the Summer Olympics in Berlin together with Chinese mathematician Hua Luogeng who paid Chern a brief visit. During that time, Hua was studying at the University of Cambridge in Britain.

=== 1937-1943 WW2 ===
In the summer of 1937, Chern accepted the invitation of Tsinghua University and returned to China. He was promoted to professor of mathematics at Tsinghua.

In late 1937, however, the start of World War 2 forced Tsinghua and other academic institutions to move away from Beijing to west China. Three universities including Peking University, Tsinghua, and Nankai formed the temporary National Southwestern Associated University (NSAU), and relocated to Kunming, Yunnan province. Chern never reached Beijing.

In 1939, Chern married Shih-Ning Cheng, and the couple had two children, Paul and May.

The war prevented Chern from having regular contacts with the outside mathematical community. He wrote to Cartan about his situation, to which Cartan sent him a box of his reprints. Chern spent a considerable amount of time pondering over Cartan&#x27;s papers and published despite relative isolation. In 1943, his papers gained international recognition, and Oswald Veblen invited him to the IAS. Because of the war, it took him a week to reach Princeton via US military aircraft.

=== 1943-1945 visit to the IAS, the Chern theorem ===
In July 1943, Chern went to the United States, and worked at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) in Princeton on characteristic classes in differential geometry. There he worked with André Weil on the Chern–Weil homomorphism and theory of characteristic classes, later to be foundational to the Atiyah–Singer index theorem. Shortly afterwards, he was invited by Solomon Lefschetz to be an editor of &quot;Annals of Mathematics&quot;.

Between 1943-1964 he was invited back to the IAS on several occasions. On Chern, Weil wrote:... we seemed to share a common attitude towards such subjects, or towards mathematics in general; we were both striving to strike at the root of each question while freeing our minds from preconceived notions about what others might have regarded as the right or the wrong way of dealing with it.It was at the IAS that his work culminated in his publication of the generalization of the famous Gauss–Bonnet theorem to higher dimensional manifolds, now known today as the Chern theorem. It is widely considered to be his &quot;magnum opus&quot;. This period at the IAS was a turning point in career, having a major impact on mathematics, while fundamentally altering the course of differential geometry and algebraic geometry. In a letter to the then director Frank Aydelotte, Chern wrote:“The years 1943–45 will undoubtedly be decisive in my career, and I have profited not only in the mathematical side. I am inclined to think that among the people who have stayed at the Institute, I was one who has profited the most, but the other people may think the same way.”

=== 1945-48 first return to China ===
Chern returned to Shanghai in 1945 to help found the Institute of Mathematics of the Academia Sinica. Chern was the acting president of the institute. Wu Wenjun was Chern&#x27;s graduate student at the institute.

In 1948, Chern was elected one of the first academicians of the Academia Sinica. He was the youngest academician elected (at age 37).

In 1948, he accepted an invitation by Weyl and Veblen to return to Princeton as a professor.

=== 1948-60 Back in the USA, University of Chicago ===
By the end of 1948, Chern returned to the United States and IAS. He brought his family with him. In 1949, he was invited by Weil to become professor of mathematics at the University of Chicago and accepted the position as chair of geometry. Coincidentally, Ernest Preston Lane, former Chair at UChicago Department of Mathematics, was the doctoral advisor of Chern&#x27;s undergraduate mentor at Tsinghua—Sun Guangyuan.

In 1950 he was invited by the International Congress of Mathematicians in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He delivered his address on the &quot;Differential Geometry of Fiber Bundles.&quot; According to Hans Samelson, in the lecture Chern introduced the notion of a connection on a principal fiber bundle, a generalization of the Levi-Civita connection.

=== Berkeley and MSRI ===
In 1960 Chern moved to the University of California, Berkeley. He worked and stayed there until he became an emeritus professor in 1979. In 1961, Chern became a naturalized citizen of the United States. In the same year, he was elected member of the United States National Academy of Sciences. &quot;My election to the US National Academy of Sciences was a prime factor for my US citizenship. In&quot; 1960 &quot;I was tipped about the possibility of an academy membership. Realizing that a citizenship was necessary, I applied for it. The process was slowed because of my association to Oppenheimer. As a consequence I became a US citizen about a month before my election to academy membership.&quot;In 1964, Chern was a vice president of American Mathematical Society (AMS).

Chern retired from UC Berkeley in 1979. In 1981, together with colleagues Calvin C. Moore and Isadore Singer, he founded the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI) at Berkeley, serving as the director until 1984. Afterward he became the honorary director of the institute. MSRI now is one of the largest and most prominent mathematical institutes in the world. Shing-Tung Yau was one of his PhD students during this period, and he later won the Fields Medal in 1982.

During WW2, the US did not have much of a scene in geometry (which is why he chose to study in Germany). Chern was largely responsible in making the US a leading research hub in the field, but he remained modest about his achievements, preferring to say that he is a man of &#x27;small problems&#x27; rather than &#x27;big views.&#x27;

=== Visits to China and bridging East and West ===
The Shanghai Communiqué was issued by the United States and the People&#x27;s Republic of China on February 27, 1972. The relationship between these two nations started to normalize, and American citizens were allowed to visit China. In September 1972, Chern visited Beijing with his wife. During this period of time, Chern visited China 25 times, of which 14 were to his home province Zhejiang.

He was admired and respected by Chinese leaders Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, and Jiang Zemin. Because of foreign prestigious scientific support, Chern was able to revive mathematical research in China, producing a generation of influential Chinese mathematicians.

Chern founded the Nankai Institute for Mathematics (NKIM) at his alma mater Nankai in Tianjin. The institute was formally established in 1984 and fully opened on October 17, 1985. NKIM was renamed the Chern Institute of Mathematics in 2004 after Chern&#x27;s death. He was treated as a rock star and cultural icon in China. Regarding his influence in China and help raising a generation of new mathematicians, ZALA films says:Several world-renowned figures, such as Gang Tian and Shing-Tung Yau, consider Chern the mentor who helped them study in western countries following the bleak years of the Cultural Revolution, when Chinese universities were closed and academic pursuits suppressed. By the time Chern started returning to China regularly during the 1980s, he had become a celebrity; every school child knew his name, and TV cameras documented his every move whenever he ventured forth from the institute he established at Nankai University.He has said that back then the main obstruent to the growth of math in China is the low pay, which is important considering that after the cultural revolution many families were impoverished. But he has said that given China&#x27;s size, it naturally has a large talent pool of budding mathematicians.

Nobel Prize winner and former student CN Yang has saidChern and I and many others felt that we have the responsibility to try to create more understanding between the American people and the Chinese people, and... all of us shared the desire to promote more exchanges.

=== Final years and death ===
In 1999, Chern moved from Berkeley back to Tianjin, China permanently until his death.

Based on Chern&#x27;s advice, a mathematical research center was established in Taipei, Taiwan, whose co-operational partners are National Taiwan University, National Tsing Hua University and the Academia Sinica Institute of Mathematics.

In 2002, he convinced the Chinese government (the PRC) for the first time to host the International Congress of Mathematicians in Beijing. In the speech at the opening ceremony he said:The great Confucius guided China spiritually for over 2,000 years. The main doctrine is “仁” pronounced “ren”, meaning two people, i.e., human relationship. Modern science has been highly competitive. I think an injection of the human element will make our subject more healthy and enjoyable. Let us wish that this congress will open a new era in the future development of math.

Chern was also a director and advisor of the Center of Mathematical Sciences at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, Zhejiang.

Chern died of heart failure at Tianjin Medical University General Hospital in 2004 at age 93.

In 2010 George Csicsery featured him in the documentary short &quot;Taking the Long View: The Life of Shiing-shen Chern&quot;.

His former residence, Ningyuan (), is still in campus of Nankai University, kept in the way when he was living there. Every year on December 3, Ningyuan is open for visitors for memorial of him.

==Research==
Physics Nobel Prize winner (and former student) C. N. Yang has said that Chern is on par with Euclid, Gauss, Riemann, Cartan. Two of Chern&#x27;s most important contributions that have reshaped the fields of geometry and topology include

* Chern-Gauss-Bonnet Theorem, the generalization of the famous Gauss–Bonnet theorem (100 years earlier) to higher dimensional manifolds. Chern considers this his greatest work. Chern proved it by developing his geometric theory of fiber bundles.
*Chern classes, the complexification of Pontryagin classes, which have found wide-reaching applications in modern physics, especially string theory, quantum field theory, condensed matter physics, in things like the magnetic monopole. His main idea was that one should do geometry and topology in the complex case.

In 2007, Chern&#x27;s disciple and IAS director Phillip Griffiths edited &quot;Inspired by S. S. Chern: A Memorial Volume in Honor of A Great Mathematician&quot; (World Scientific Press). Griffiths wrote:“More than any other mathematician, Shiing-Shen Chern defined the subject of global differential geometry, a central area in contemporary mathematics. In work that spanned almost seven decades, he helped to shape large areas of modern mathematics... I think that he, more than anyone, was the founder of one of the central areas of modern mathematics.”His work extended over all the classic fields of differential geometry as well as more modern ones including general relativity, invariant theory, characteristic classes, cohomology theory, Morse theory, Fiber bundles, Sheaf theory, Cartan&#x27;s theory of differential forms, etc. His work included areas currently-fashionable, perennial, foundational, and nascent:

* Chern–Simons theory arising from a 1974 paper written jointly with Jim Simons; and also gauge theory, Chern–Simons form, Chern-Simons field theory. CS theory now has great importance in knot theory and modern string theory and condensed matter physics research, including Topological phases of matter and Topological quantum field theory.
* Chern–Weil theory linking curvature invariants to characteristic classes from 1944
* class theory for Hermitian manifolds
* Chern-Bott theory, including the Chern-Bott theorem, a famous result on complex geometrizations of complex value distribution functions
* value distribution theory of holomorphic functions
* Chern-Lashof theory on tight immersions, compiled in a monograph over 30 years with Richard Lashof at Chicago
* Chern-Lashof theorem: a proof was announced in 1989 by Sharpe
* projective differential geometry
* webs
* integral geometry, including the &#x27;moving theorem&#x27; (), in collaboration with Yan Zhida
*minimal surfaces, minimal submanifolds and harmonic mappings
*Exterior Differential Systems and Partial Differential Equations

He was a follower of Élie Cartan, working on the &#x27;theory of equivalence&#x27; in his time in China from 1937 to 1943, in relative isolation. In 1954 he published his own treatment of the pseudogroup problem that is in effect the touchstone of Cartan&#x27;s geometric theory. He used the moving frame method with success only matched by its inventor; he preferred in complex manifold theory to stay with the geometry, rather than follow the potential theory. Indeed, one of his books is entitled &quot;Complex Manifolds without Potential Theory&quot;.

=== Differential forms ===
Along with Cartan, Chern is one of the mathematicians known for popularizing the use of differential forms in math and physics. In his biography, Richard Palais and Chuu-Lian Terng have written &quot;... we would like to point out a unifying theme that runs through all of it: his absolute mastery of the techniques of differential forms and his artful application of these techniques in solving geometric problems. This was a magic mantle, handed down to him by his great teacher, Élie Cartan. It permitted him to explore in depth new mathematical territory where others could not enter. What makes differential forms such an ideal tool for studying local and global geometric properties&quot; (&quot;and for relating them to each other&quot;) &quot;is their two complementary aspects. They admit, on the one hand, the local operation of exterior differentiation, and on the other the global operation of integration over cochains, and these are related via Stokes&#x27;s Theorem.&quot; While at the IAS, there were two competing methods of geometry: the tensor calculus and the newer differential forms. Chern wrote: I usually like to say that vector fields is like a man, and differential forms is like a woman. Society must have two sexes. If you only have one, it’s not enough.In the last years of his life, he advocated the study of Finsler geometry, writing several books and articles on the subject. His research on Finsler geometry is continued through Tian Gang, Paul C. Yang, and Sun-Yung Alice Chang of Princeton University.

He was known for unifying geometric and topological methods to prove stunning new results.

==Namesake and persona==
* The asteroid 29552 Chern is named after him;
* The Chern Medal, of the International Mathematical Union (IMU);
* The Shiing-Shen Chern Prize (), of the Association of Chinese Mathematicians;
* The Chern Institute of Mathematics at Nankai University, Tianjin, renamed in 2005 in honor of Chern;
* The Chern Lectures, and the&quot; Shiing-Shen Chern Chair in Mathematics&quot;, both at the Department of Mathematics, UC Berkeley.

Chern liked to play contract bridge, Go (game), read Wuxia-literature of Jin Yong and had an interest in Chinese philosophy and history.

In 1975, Chen Ning Yang and Chern found out that their research in non-abelian gauge theory and Fiber bundle describe the same theoretical structure, which showed a surprising connection between physics and mathematics. Therefore, Chern asked Fan Zeng to finish a chinese painting named Shiing-Shen Chern and Chen Ning Yang for that. The Painting was later donated to the Nankai University.

A polyglot, he spoke German, French, English, Wu and Mandarin Chinese.“Whenever we had to go to the chancellor to make some special request, we always took Chern along, and it always worked,” says Berkeley mathematician Rob Kirby. “Somehow he had a presence, a gravitas. There was something about him that people just listened to him, and usually did things his way.”

=== The Chern Song ===
In 1979 a Chern Symposium offered him a honorary song in tribute:&quot;Hail to Chern! Mathematics Greatest!&quot;

&quot;He made Gauss-Bonnet a household word,&quot;

&quot;Intrinsic proofs he found,&quot;

&quot;Throughout the World his truths abound,&quot;

&quot;Chern classes he gave us,&quot;

&quot;and Secondary Invariants,&quot;

&quot;Fibre Bundles and Sheaves,&quot;

&quot;Distributions and Foliated Leaves!&quot;

&quot;All Hail All Hail to CHERN.&quot;It&#x27;s called the Chern song.

=== Chern professorships ===
Allyn Jackson writesS. S. Chern is the recipient of many international honors, including six honorary doctorates, the U.S. National Medal of Science, Israel’s Wolf Prize, and membership in learned academies around the world. He has also received a more homegrown honor, the dream-turned-reality of an appreciative student of 30 years ago, who grew up in the Bay Area.

When Robert Uomini would buy his 10 tickets for the California State Lottery, he had an unusual “what if I win?” fantasy: He wanted to endow a professorship to honor S. S. Chern. While an undergraduate at U.C. Berkeley in the 1960s, Uomini was greatly inspired by a differential geometry course he took from Chern. With Chern’s support and encouragement, Uomini entered graduate school at Berkeley and received his Ph.D. in mathematics in 1976. Twenty years later, while working as a consultant to Sun Microsystems in Palo Alto, Uomini won $22 million in the state lottery. He could then realize his dream of expressing his gratitude in a concrete way.

Uomini and his wife set up the Robert G. Uomini and Louise B. Bidwell Foundation to support an extended visit of an outstanding mathematician to the U.C. Berkeley campus. There have been three Chern Visiting Professors so far: Sir Michael Atiyah of the University of Cambridge (1996), Richard Stanley of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1997), and Friedrich Hirzebruch of the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn (1998). Jean-Pierre Serre of the Collège de France was the Chern Visiting Professor for 1999. [sic]

The foundation also helps to support the Chern Symposium, a yearly one-day event held in Berkeley during the period when the Chern Visiting Professor is in residence. The March 1998 Symposium was co-sponsored by the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute and was expanded to run for three days, featuring a dozen speakers. The MSRI also set up a Chern Professorship, funded by Chern&#x27;s children May and Paul as well as James Simons.

=== Biographies on Chern and other memorabilia ===
Abraham Pais wrote about Chern in his book &quot;Subtle is the Lord.&quot; To paraphrase one passage: the outstanding mathematician Chern has two things to say, 1) I feel very mysterious that in the fields I&#x27;m working on (general relativity and differential geometry) there is so much more that can be explored; and 2) when talking with Albert Einstein (his colleague at the IAS) about his problem of a Grand Unified Theory, I realized the difference between mathematics and physics is at the heart of the journey towards a theory of everything.

Manfredo Do Carmo dedicated his book on &quot;Riemannian Geometry&quot; to Chern, his PhD advisor.

In Yau&#x27;s autobiography, he talks a lot about his advisor Chern. In 1982, while on sabbatical at the New York University Courant Institute, he visited Stony Brook to see his friends and former students CN Yang and Simons.

In 2011 ZALA films published a documentary titled &quot;Taking the Long View: the Life of Shiing-shen Chern&quot; ()&quot;.&quot; In 2013 it was broadcast on US public television. It was compiled with the help of his friends including Alan Weinstein, Chuu-Lian Terng, Calvin C. Moore, Marty Shen, Robert Bryant, Robert Uomini, Robert Osserman, Hung-Hsi Wu, Rob Kirby, CN Yang, Paul Chu, Udo Simon, Phillip Griffiths, etc.

Dozens of other biographies have been written on Chern. See the citations for more info.

=== Poetry ===
Chern was an expressive poet as well. On his 60th birthday he wrote a love letter re-affirming his gratitude towards his wife and celebrating their &#x27;beautiful, long, happy, marriage&#x27;:Thirty-six years together

Through times of happiness

And times of worry too.

Time’s passage has no mercy.

We fly the Skies and cross the Oceans

To fulfill my destiny;

Raising the children fell

Entirely on your shoulders.

How fortunate I am

To have my works to look back upon,

I feel regrets you still have chores.

Growing old together in El Cerrito is a blessing.

Time passes by,

And we hardly notice.

== Students ==
Chern has 43 students, including Fields medalist Shing-Tung Yau, Nobel Prize winner Chen-Ning Yang; and over 1000 descendants.

His student James Harris Simons at Stony Brook (co-author of the Chern–Simons theory) later founded the hedge fund Renaissance Technologies and became a billionaire. Simons talks about Chern in his TED talk.

Two of his students Manfredo do Carmo and Katsumi Nomizu have written influential textbooks in geometry.

Former director of the IAS Phillip Griffiths wrote[Chern] took great pleasure in getting to know and working with and helping to guide young mathematicians. I was one of them.

==Family==
His wife, Shih-ning Cheng (), whom he married in 1939, died in 2000. He also had a daughter, May Chu (), wife of the physicist Chu Ching-wu, and a son named Paul (). On his wife he writes (also see &quot;Selected Papers)&quot;:&quot;I would not conclude this account without mentioning my wife&#x27;s role in my life and work. Through war and peace and through bad and good times we have shared a life for forty years, which is both simple and rich. If there is credit for my mathematical works, it will be hers as well as mine.&quot;May Chu described her father as an easygoing parent. Paul added that he often saw what was best for you before you realized it.

<text>The Chern–Simons theory is a 3-dimensional topological quantum field theory of Schwarz type developed by Edward Witten. It was discovered first by mathematical physicist Albert Schwarz. It is named after mathematicians Shiing-Shen Chern and James Harris Simons, who introduced the Chern–Simons 3-form. In the Chern–Simons theory, the action is proportional to the integral of the Chern–Simons 3-form.

In condensed-matter physics, Chern–Simons theory describes the topological order in fractional quantum Hall effect states. In mathematics, it has been used to calculate knot invariants and three-manifold invariants such as the Jones polynomial.

Particularly, Chern–Simons theory is specified by a choice of simple Lie group G known as the gauge group of the theory and also a number referred to as the &quot;level&quot; of the theory, which is a constant that multiplies the action. The action is gauge dependent, however the partition function of the quantum theory is well-defined when the level is an integer and the gauge field strength vanishes on all boundaries of the 3-dimensional spacetime.

It is also the central mathematical object in theoretical models for topological quantum computers (TQC). Specifically, an SU(2) Chern–Simons theory describes the simplest non-abelian anyonic model of a TQC, the Yang–Lee–Fibonacci model.

The dynamics of Chern–Simons theory on the 2-dimensional boundary of a 3-manifold is closely related to fusion rules and conformal blocks in conformal field theory, and in particular WZW theory.

==The classical theory==

===Mathematical origin===

In the 1940s S. S. Chern and A. Weil studied the global curvature properties of smooth manifolds &quot;M&quot; as de Rham cohomology (Chern–Weil theory), which is an important step in the theory of characteristic classes in differential geometry. Given a flat &quot;G&quot;-principal bundle &quot;P&quot; on &quot;M&quot; there exists a unique homomorphism, called the Chern–Weil homomorphism, from the algebra of &quot;G&quot;-adjoint invariant polynomials on &quot;g&quot; (Lie algebra of &quot;G&quot;) to the cohomology formula_1. If the invariant polynomial is homogeneous one can write down concretely any &quot;k&quot;-form of the closed connection &quot;ω&quot; as some 2&quot;k&quot;-form of the associated curvature form Ω of &quot;ω&quot;.

In 1974 S. S. Chern and J. H. Simons had concretely constructed a (2&quot;k&quot; − 1)-form &quot;df&quot;(&quot;ω&quot;) such that
:formula_2
where &quot;T&quot; is the Chern–Weil homomorphism. This form is called Chern–Simons form. If &quot;df&quot;(&quot;ω&quot;) is closed one can integrate the above formula
:formula_3
where &quot;C&quot; is a (2&quot;k&quot; − 1)-dimensional cycle on &quot;M&quot;. This invariant is called Chern–Simons invariant. As pointed out in the introduction of the Chern–Simons paper, the Chern–Simons invariant CS(&quot;M&quot;) is the boundary term that cannot be determined by any pure combinatorial formulation. It also can be defined as
:formula_4
where formula_5 is the first Pontryagin number and &quot;s&quot;(&quot;M&quot;) is the section of the normal orthogonal bundle &quot;P&quot;. Moreover, the Chern–Simons term is described as the eta invariant defined by Atiyah, Patodi and Singer.

The gauge invariance and the metric invariance can be viewed as the invariance under the adjoint Lie group action in the Chern–Weil theory. The action integral (path integral) of the field theory in physics is viewed as the Lagrangian integral of the Chern–Simons form and Wilson loop, holonomy of vector bundle on &quot;M&quot;. These explain why the Chern–Simons theory is closely related to topological field theory.

===Configurations===

Chern–Simons theories can be defined on any topological 3-manifold &quot;M&quot;, with or without boundary. As these theories are Schwarz-type topological theories, no metric needs to be introduced on &quot;M&quot;.

Chern–Simons theory is a gauge theory, which means that a classical configuration in the Chern–Simons theory on &quot;M&quot; with gauge group &quot;G&quot; is described by a principal &quot;G&quot;-bundle on &quot;M&quot;. The connection of this bundle is characterized by a connection one-form &quot;A&quot; which is valued in the Lie algebra g of the Lie group &quot;G&quot;. In general the connection &quot;A&quot; is only defined on individual coordinate patches, and the values of &quot;A&quot; on different patches are related by maps known as gauge transformations. These are characterized by the assertion that the covariant derivative, which is the sum of the exterior derivative operator &quot;d&quot; and the connection &quot;A&quot;, transforms in the adjoint representation of the gauge group &quot;G&quot;. The square of the covariant derivative with itself can be interpreted as a g-valued 2-form &quot;F&quot; called the curvature form or field strength. It also transforms in the adjoint representation.

===Dynamics===
The action &quot;S&quot; of Chern–Simons theory is proportional to the integral of the Chern–Simons 3-form

:formula_6

The constant &quot;k&quot; is called the &quot;level&quot; of the theory. The classical physics of Chern–Simons theory is independent of the choice of level &quot;k&quot;.

Classically the system is characterized by its equations of motion which are the extrema of the action with respect to variations of the field &quot;A&quot;. In terms of the field curvature

:formula_7

the field equation is explicitly

:formula_8

The classical equations of motion are therefore satisfied if and only if the curvature vanishes everywhere, in which case the connection is said to be &quot;flat&quot;. Thus the classical solutions to &quot;G&quot; Chern–Simons theory are the flat connections of principal &quot;G&quot;-bundles on &quot;M&quot;. Flat connections are determined entirely by holonomies around noncontractible cycles on the base &quot;M&quot;. More precisely, they are in one-to-one correspondence with equivalence classes of homomorphisms from the fundamental group of &quot;M&quot; to the gauge group &quot;G&quot; up to conjugation.

If &quot;M&quot; has a boundary &quot;N&quot; then there is additional data which describes a choice of trivialization of the principal &quot;G&quot;-bundle on &quot;N&quot;. Such a choice characterizes a map from &quot;N&quot; to &quot;G&quot;. The dynamics of this map is described by the Wess–Zumino–Witten (WZW) model on &quot;N&quot; at level &quot;k&quot;.

==Quantization==

To canonically quantize Chern–Simons theory one defines a state on each 2-dimensional surface Σ in M. As in any quantum field theory, the states correspond to rays in a Hilbert space. There is no preferred notion of time in a Schwarz-type topological field theory and so one can require that Σ be a Cauchy surface, in fact, a state can be defined on any surface.

Σ is of codimension one, and so one may cut M along Σ. After such a cutting M will be a manifold with boundary and in particular classically the dynamics of Σ will be described by a WZW model. Witten has shown that this correspondence holds even quantum mechanically. More precisely, he demonstrated that the Hilbert space of states is always finite-dimensional and can be canonically identified with the space of conformal blocks of the G WZW model at level k.

For example, when Σ is a 2-sphere, this Hilbert space is one-dimensional and so there is only one state. When Σ is a 2-torus the states correspond to the integrable representations of the affine Lie algebra corresponding to g at level k. Characterizations of the conformal blocks at higher genera are not necessary for Witten&#x27;s solution of Chern–Simons theory.

==Observables==

===Wilson loops===

The observables of Chern–Simons theory are the &quot;n&quot;-point correlation functions of gauge-invariant operators. The most often studied class of gauge invariant operators are Wilson loops. A Wilson loop is the holonomy around a loop in &quot;M&quot;, traced in a given representation &quot;R&quot; of &quot;G&quot;. As we will be interested in products of Wilson loops, without loss of generality we may restrict our attention to irreducible representations &quot;R&quot;.

More concretely, given an irreducible representation &quot;R&quot; and a loop &quot;K&quot; in &quot;M&quot;, one may define the Wilson loop formula_9 by

:formula_10

where &quot;A&quot; is the connection 1-form and we take the Cauchy principal value of the contour integral and formula_11 is the path-ordered exponential.

===HOMFLY and Jones polynomials===

Consider a link &quot;L&quot; in &quot;M&quot;, which is a collection of &quot;ℓ&quot; disjoint loops. A particularly interesting observable is the &quot;ℓ&quot;-point correlation function formed from the product of the Wilson loops around each disjoint loop, each traced in the fundamental representation of &quot;G&quot;. One may form a normalized correlation function by dividing this observable by the partition function &quot;Z&quot;(&quot;M&quot;), which is just the 0-point correlation function.

In the special case in which M is the 3-sphere, Witten has shown that these normalized correlation functions are proportional to known knot polynomials. For example, in &quot;G&quot; = &quot;U&quot;(&quot;N&quot;) Chern–Simons theory at level &quot;k&quot; the normalized correlation function is, up to a phase, equal to

:formula_12

times the HOMFLY polynomial. In particular when &quot;N&quot; = 2 the HOMFLY polynomial reduces to the Jones polynomial. In the SO(&quot;N&quot;) case, one finds a similar expression with the Kauffman polynomial.

The phase ambiguity reflects the fact that, as Witten has shown, the quantum correlation functions are not fully defined by the classical data. The linking number of a loop with itself enters into the calculation of the partition function, but this number is not invariant under small deformations and in particular, is not a topological invariant. This number can be rendered well defined if one chooses a framing for each loop, which is a choice of preferred nonzero normal vector at each point along which one deforms the loop to calculate its self-linking number. This procedure is an example of the point-splitting regularization procedure introduced by Paul Dirac and Rudolf Peierls to define apparently divergent quantities in quantum field theory in 1934.

Sir Michael Atiyah has shown that there exists a canonical choice of 2-framing, which is generally used in the literature today and leads to a well-defined linking number. With the canonical framing the above phase is the exponential of 2π&quot;i&quot;/(&quot;k&quot; + &quot;N&quot;) times the linking number of &quot;L&quot; with itself.

;Problem (Extension of Jones polynomial to general 3-manifolds)　
&quot;The original Jones polynomial was defined for 1-links in the 3-sphere (the 3-ball, the 3-space R3). Can you define the Jones polynomial for 1-links in any 3-manifold?&quot;

See section 1.1 of this paper for the background and the history of this problem. Kauffman submitted a solution in the case of the product manifold of closed oriented surface and the closed interval, by introducing virtual 1-knots. It is open in the other cases. Witten&#x27;s path integral for Jones polynomial is written for links in any compact 3-manifold formally, but the calculus is not done even in physics level in any case other than the 3-sphere (the 3-ball, the 3-space R3). This problem is also open in physics level. In the case of Alexander polynomial, this problem is solved.

==Relationships with other theories==

===Topological string theories===
In the context of string theory, a &quot;U&quot;(&quot;N&quot;) Chern–Simons theory on an oriented Lagrangian 3-submanifold M of a 6-manifold &quot;X&quot; arises as the string field theory of open strings ending on a D-brane wrapping &quot;X&quot; in the A-model topological string theory on &quot;X&quot;. The B-model topological open string field theory on the spacefilling worldvolume of a stack of D5-branes is a 6-dimensional variant of Chern–Simons theory known as holomorphic Chern–Simons theory.

===WZW and matrix models===

Chern–Simons theories are related to many other field theories. For example, if one considers a Chern–Simons theory with gauge group G on a manifold with boundary then all of the 3-dimensional propagating degrees of freedom may be gauged away, leaving a two-dimensional conformal field theory known as a G Wess–Zumino–Witten model on the boundary. In addition the &quot;U&quot;(&quot;N&quot;) and SO(&quot;N&quot;) Chern–Simons theories at large &quot;N&quot; are well approximated by matrix models.

===Chern–Simons gravity theory===

In 1982, S. Deser, R. Jackiw and S. Templeton proposed the Chern–Simons gravity theory in three dimensions, in which the Einstein–Hilbert action in gravity theory is modified by adding the Chern–Simons term. ()

In 2003, R. Jackiw and S. Y. Pi extended this theory to four dimensions () and Chern–Simons gravity theory has some considerable effects not only to fundamental physics but also condensed matter theory and astronomy.

The four-dimensional case is very analogous to the three-dimensional case. In three dimensions, the gravitational Chern–Simons term is
:formula_13
This variation gives the Cotton tensor
:formula_14

Then, Chern–Simons modification of three-dimensional gravity is made by adding the above Cotton tensor to the field equation, which can be obtained as the vacuum solution by varying the Einstein–Hilbert action.

===Chern–Simons matter theories===
In 2013 Kenneth A. Intriligator and Nathan Seiberg solved these 3d Chern–Simons gauge theories and their phases using monopoles carrying extra degrees of freedom. The Witten index of the many vacua discovered was computed by compactifying the space by turning on mass parameters and then computing the index. In some vacua, supersymmetry was computed to be broken. These monopoles were related to condensed matter vortices. ()

The &quot;N&quot; = 6 Chern–Simons matter theory is the holographic dual of M-theory on formula_15.

===Four-dimensional Chern–Simons theory===

In 2013 Kevin Costello defined a closely related theory defined on a four-dimensional manifold consisting of the product of a two-dimensional &#x27;topological plane&#x27; and a two-dimensional (or one complex dimensional) complex curve. He later studied the theory in more detail together with Witten and Masahito Yamazaki, demonstrating how the gauge theory could be related to many notions in integrable systems theory, including exactly solvable lattice models (like the six-vertex model or the XXZ spin chain), integrable quantum field theories (such as the Gross–Neveu model, principal chiral model and symmetric space coset sigma models), the Yang–Baxter equation and quantum groups such as the Yangian which describe symmetries underpinning the integrability of the aforementioned systems.

The action on the 4-manifold formula_16 where formula_17 is a two-dimensional manifold and formula_18 is a complex curve is
formula_19
where formula_20 is a meromorphic one-form on formula_18.

==Chern–Simons terms in other theories==

The Chern–Simons term can also be added to models which aren&#x27;t topological quantum field theories. In 3D, this gives rise to a massive photon if this term is added to the action of Maxwell&#x27;s theory of electrodynamics. This term can be induced by integrating over a massive charged Dirac field. It also appears for example in the quantum Hall effect. The addition of the Chern–Simons term to various theories gives rise to vortex- or soliton-type solutions Ten- and eleven-dimensional generalizations of Chern–Simons terms appear in the actions of all ten- and eleven-dimensional supergravity theories.

===One-loop renormalization of the level===

If one adds matter to a Chern–Simons gauge theory then, in general it is no longer topological. However, if one adds n Majorana fermions then, due to the parity anomaly, when integrated out they lead to a pure Chern–Simons theory with a one-loop renormalization of the Chern–Simons level by −&quot;n&quot;/2, in other words the level k theory with n fermions is equivalent to the level &quot;k&quot; − &quot;n&quot;/2 theory without fermions.

<text>71 (seventy-one) is the natural number following 70 and preceding 72.

==In mathematics==
71 is the 20th prime number. Because both rearrangements of its digits (17 and 71) are prime numbers, 71 is an emirp and more generally a permutable prime.

71 is a centered heptagonal number.

It is a Pillai prime, since formula_1 is divisible by 71, but 71 is not one more than a multiple of 9.
It is part of the last known pair (71, 7) of Brown numbers, since formula_2.

71 is the smallest of thirty-one discriminants of imaginary quadratic fields with class number of 7, negated (see also, Heegner numbers).

71 is the largest number which occurs as a prime factor of an order of a sporadic simple group, the largest (15th) supersingular prime.

<text>73 (seventy-three) is the natural number following 72 and preceding 74. In English, it is the smallest natural number with twelve letters in its spelled out name.

It is the 21st prime number and the fourth star number. It is also the eighth twin prime, with 71.

== In mathematics ==
73 is the 21st prime number, and emirp with 37, the 12th prime number. It is also the eighth twin prime, with 71. It is the largest minimal primitive root in the first 100,000 primes; in other words, if is one of the first one hundred thousand primes, then at least one of the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ..., 73 is a primitive root modulo . 73 is also the smallest factor of the first composite generalized Fermat number in decimal: formula_1, and the smallest prime congruent to 1 modulo 24, as well as the only prime repunit in octal (1118). It is the fourth star number.

=== Sheldon prime ===
Where 73 and 37 are part of the sequence of permutable primes and emirps in base-ten, the number 73 is more specifically the unique &quot;Sheldon prime&quot;, named as an homage to TV character Sheldon Cooper and defined as satisfying &quot;mirror&quot; and &quot;product&quot; properties, where:

* 73 has 37 as the mirroring of its decimal digits. 73 is the 21st prime number, and 37 the 12th. The &quot;mirror property&quot; is fulfilled when 73 has a mirrored permutation of its digits (37) that remains prime. Similarly, their respective prime indices (21 and 12) in the list of prime numbers are also permutations of the same digits (1, and 2). 
* 73 is the 21st prime number. It satisfies the &quot;product property&quot; since the product of its decimal digits is precisely in equivalence with its index in the sequence of prime numbers. i.e., 21 = 7 × 3. On the other hand, 37 does not fulfill the product property, since, naturally, its digits also multiply to 21; therefore, the only number to fulfill this property between these two numbers is 73, and as such it is the only &quot;Sheldon prime&quot;.

=== Other connections between 37 and 73 ===

73 and 37 are also consecutive star numbers, equivalently consecutive centered dodecagonal (12-gonal) numbers (respectively the 4th and the 3rd). They are successive lucky primes and sexy primes, both twice over, and successive Pierpont primes, respectively the 9th and 8th. 73 and 37 are consecutive values of formula_2 such that every positive integer can be written as the sum of 73 or fewer sixth powers, or 37 or fewer fifth powers (and 19 or fewer fourth powers; see Waring&#x27;s problem).

73 and 37 are consecutive primes in the seven-integer covering set of the first known Sierpiński number 78,557 of the form formula_3 that is composite for all natural numbers formula_4, where 73 is the largest member: formula_5 More specifically, formula_6 modulo 36 will be divisible by at least one of the integers in this set.

Consider the following sequence formula_7:
:Let formula_8 be a Sierpiński number or Riesel number divisible by formula_9, and let formula_10 be the largest number in a set of primes which cover every number of the form formula_11 or of the form formula_12, with formula_13;
:formula_7 equals formula_10 if and only if there exists no number formula_8 that has a covering set with largest prime greater than formula_10.
Known such index values formula_4 where formula_10 is equal to 73 as the largest member of such covering sets are: formula_20, with 37 present alongside 73. In particular, formula_7 ≥ 73 for any formula_4.
In addition, 73 is the largest member in the covering set formula_23 of the smallest proven generalized Sierpiński number of the form formula_24 in nonary formula_25, while it is also the largest member of the covering set formula_26 that belongs to the smallest such provable number in decimal formula_27 — both in congruencies formula_28.

=== Other properties ===
73 is one of the fifteen left-truncatable and right-truncatable primes in decimal, meaning it remains prime when the last &quot;right&quot; digit is successively removed and it remains prime when the last &quot;left&quot; digit is successively removed; and because it is a twin prime (with 71), it is the only two-digit twin prime that is both a left-truncatable and right-truncatable prime.

The row sum of Lah numbers of the form formula_29 with formula_30 and formula_31 is equal to formula_32. These numbers represent coefficients expressing rising factorials in terms of falling factorials, and vice-versa; equivalently in this case to the number of partitions of formula_33. All primes greater than or equal to 73 are non-supersingular, while 37, on the other hand, is the smallest prime number that is not supersingular. formula_34 contains a total of 194 conjugacy classes that involve 73 distinct orders (without including multiplicities over which letters run).

73 is the largest member of a 17-integer matrix definite quadratic that represents all prime numbers: {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 67, 73}, with consecutive primes between 2 through 47.

73 is the ninth member of the sequence of &quot;Hogben&#x27;s central polygonal numbers&quot;, which enumerates the maximal number of interior regions formed by nine intersecting circles.

== In other fields ==
73 is also:
*Amateur radio operators and other morse code users commonly use the number 73 as a &quot;92 Code&quot; abbreviation for &quot;best regards&quot;, typically when ending a QSO (a conversation with another operator). These codes also facilitate communication between operators who may not be native English speakers. In Morse code, 73 is an easily recognized palindrome: ( - - · · ·   · · · - - ).
*On a CB radio, 10-73 means &quot;speed trap at...&quot;

==Popular culture==
===&quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;===
73 is Sheldon Cooper&#x27;s favorite number in &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;. He first expresses his love for it in &quot;The Alien Parasite Hypothesis&quot;, the 73rd episode of &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;. Jim Parsons, who plays Cooper in the series, was born in 1973. His character often wears a t-shirt with the number 73 on it.

<text>75 (seventy-five) is the natural number following 74 and preceding 76.

==In mathematics==
75 is a self number because there is no integer that added up to its own digits adds up to 75. It is the sum of the first five pentagonal numbers, and therefore a pentagonal pyramidal number, as well as a nonagonal number.

It is also the fourth ordered Bell number, and a Keith number, because it recurs in a Fibonacci-like sequence started from its base 10 digits: 7, 5, 12, 17, 29, 46, 75...

75 is the count of the number of weak orderings on a set of four items.

Excluding the infinite sets, there are 75 uniform polyhedra in the third dimension, which incorporate star polyhedra as well. Inclusive of 7 families of prisms and antiprisms, there are also 75 uniform compound polyhedra.

<text>Streamline Pictures was an American media company. Founded by screenwriter Carl Macek and animation historian Jerry Beck, it was one of the earliest distributors of English-dubbed Japanese animation.

==History==
===Founding===
Founded in Los Angeles, California, in late 1988, Streamline Pictures was one of the first North American companies that was created primarily with the intention of distributing translated anime uncut and faithful to the original content. The founders of Streamline were television writer and producer Carl Macek, who had worked for Harmony Gold USA on the series &quot;Robotech&quot;, and film distributor Jerry Beck. At one point or another, Gregory Snegoff, Steve Kramer, Ardwight Chamberlain, Tom Wyner, and Mike Reynolds, all of whom served as series staff writers (and voice actors) on &quot;Robotech&quot;, worked as independent writers and voice actors for Streamline.

===High-profile releases===

The first high-profile release by Streamline was the film &quot;Laputa: Castle in the Sky&quot; from director Hayao Miyazaki, premiering at the Roxy Screening Room in Philadelphia on March 24, 1989. The company was also known for its theatrical release of the film &quot;Akira&quot; at The Biograph in Georgetown, Washington, D.C. on December 25, 1989, as well as its 1992 video dubbing of &quot;The Castle of Cagliostro&quot; (earlier screened with subtitles at the Film Forum in New York City in April 1991). Streamline also dubbed &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot;, and &quot;Kiki&#x27;s Delivery Service&quot;, both adapted and directed by Gregory Snegoff, in 1988 for Tokuma Shoten, although these were only used as in-flight films by Japan Airlines at the time. As a fan of Miyazaki&#x27;s films, Macek did not think &quot;Laputa&quot; (of which Streamline was the distributor) had received the quality of dubbing that a Miyazaki film deserved. He thought that it could have been done better, so Tokuma Shoten gave him the opportunity to prove his words. For his first project, he asked to dub &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot;, one of his favorite Miyazaki works. The Streamline dub of &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; was released theatrically in the U.S. by Troma Films in 1993; but its dub of &quot;Kiki&#x27;s Delivery Service&quot; appeared only on the 1990s Japanese laserdisc release of that title. (Since then, however, all three afore-mentioned films by Miyazaki at Studio Ghibli have been redubbed by Disney.)

Tokuma Shoten was pleased with the quality of the initial work, and it immediately hired Streamline to produce the English language version of &quot;Kiki&#x27;s Delivery Service&quot;. Soon after its release, the film was bought by Japan Airlines, who showed it during their flights between Japan and the U.S. Streamline also licensed and dubbed other popular anime series and movies, such as &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot;, &quot;Wicked City&quot;, &quot;Lensman&quot;, &quot;Vampire Hunter D&quot; and &quot;The Professional: Golgo 13&quot;.

===Home video market===
Streamline, in being the first company dedicated to making anime accessible to the English-speaking world, was notable for releasing a wide variety of anime that fit in a wide variety of genres, many of which do not fit completely in any genre such as &quot;Twilight of the Cockroaches&quot;. During the 1990s VHS era, before the common availability of hybrid DVDs, anime distributors released anime via subtitled or dubbed tapes with the subtitled editions being noticeably more expensive than the dubs which were expected to sell better. Streamline is also notable in being the only such company to eschew this practice and release only dubs of its anime. The only exceptions were the later &quot;Akira&quot; subtitled release and their &quot;Robotech Collection&quot;, which included episodes of the original &quot;Macross&quot;, &quot;Southern Cross&quot; and &quot;Mospeada&quot; episodes on the same tape along with their &quot;Robotech&quot; counterparts. (Since then, these three titles were re-released by ADV Films through Harmony Gold.)

=== Criticism ===
Because of Macek&#x27;s notoriety with a certain branch of fandom, Streamline became one of the early catalysts of the sub vs. dub debate. Macek&#x27;s philosophy towards anime dubbing, as stated in several interviews, most notably published &quot;Protoculture Addicts&quot; and &quot;Animag&quot;, has become largely synonymous with the negative connotation concerning &quot;Americanized dubs&quot;.

=== Later years ===
Streamline Pictures stopped producing new anime releases in 1997, but continued to distribute its complete library in North America. In 1996, the company began to release foreign films under its &quot;Independent Filmworks&quot; label until 2000 when the company closed. The company&#x27;s Modelworks division was sold in 1998 and the &quot;Streamline Pictures Modelworks&quot; division became a separate company operating under the name, &quot;Avatar Creations.&quot;

Today, rights to much of the Streamline film and television library (such as &quot;Akira&quot; and &quot;The Castle of Cagliostro&quot;) have either reverted to the Japanese rights holder and licensed to other companies; while others have never been re-released due to licensing issues and lack of demand.

<text>The Lusatian Neisse (; ; ; Upper Sorbian: &quot;Łužiska Nysa&quot;; Lower Sorbian: &quot;Łužyska Nysa&quot;), or Western Neisse, is a river in northern Central Europe. It rises in the Jizera Mountains, near Nová Ves nad Nisou, at the Czech border becoming the Polish–German border for its remaining , to flow into the similarly northward-flowing Oder from the left.

Its drainage basin covers , of which is in Poland, the rest is mainly in Germany. The river reaches the tripoint of the three nations by Zittau, a German town/city, after , leaving the Czech Republic. It is a left-bank tributary of the Oder, into which it flows between Neißemünde-Ratzdorf and Kosarzyn – north of the towns of Guben and Gubin. The river was a motivations to found Gubin as a craftmanship and trading port in the 13th Century.

Since the 1945 Potsdam Agreement in the aftermath of World War II, the river has partially demarcated the German-Polish border (along the Oder–Neisse line). The German population east of the river was expelled from Poland to Germany. 

It is the longest and most watered of the three rivers of its non-adjectival name in both the main languages (the two other rivers being the Eastern Neisse (; ) and Raging Neisse (Polish: &quot;Nysa Szalona&quot;; German: &quot;Wütende Neiße&quot; or &quot;Jauersche Neiße&quot;)). It is usually simply referred to as the Neisse.

==Name==
Since the river runs through the historic region of Lusatia, the adjective &quot;Lusatian&quot; or &quot;Western&quot; before the name of the river Neisse is used whenever differentiating this border river from the Eastern Neisse (Polish: &quot;Nysa Kłodzka&quot;, German: &quot;Glatzer Neisse&quot;) and the smaller Raging Neisse (Polish: &quot;Nysa Szalona&quot;; German: &quot;Wütende Neisse&quot; or &quot;Jauersche Neisse&quot;), both in Poland.

==Towns and villages==
At Bad Muskau the Neisse flows through Muskau Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Cities and towns on the river from source to mouth include:
* Jablonec nad Nisou, Czech Republic
* Vratislavice, Czech Republic
* Liberec, Czech Republic
* Chrastava, Czech Republic
* Hrádek nad Nisou, Czech Republic
* Zittau, Germany

<text>32 (thirty-two) is the natural number following 31 and preceding 33.

== Mathematics ==
32 is the fifth power of two (formula_1), making it the first non-unitary fifth-power of the form formula_2 where formula_3 is prime. 32 is the totient summatory function formula_4 over the first 10 integers, and the smallest number formula_5 with exactly 7 solutions for formula_6. 

The aliquot sum of a power of two is always one less than the number itself, therefore the aliquot sum of 32 is 31.

formula_7

The product between &quot;neighbor&quot; numbers of 23, the dual permutation of the digits of 32 in decimal, is equal to the sum of the first 32 integers: formula_8.

32 is also a Leyland number expressible in the form formula_9, where:
formula_10

The eleventh Mersenne number is the first to have a prime exponent (11) that does not yield a Mersenne prime, equal to:
formula_11

The product of the five known Fermat primes is equal to the number of sides of the largest regular constructible polygon with a straightedge and compass that has an odd number of sides, with a total of sides numbering 
formula_12

The first 32 rows of Pascal&#x27;s triangle read as single binary numbers represent the 32 divisors that belong to this number, which is also the number of sides of all odd-sided constructible polygons with simple tools alone (if the monogon is also included).

There are also a total of 32 uniform colorings to the 11 regular and semiregular tilings.

There are 32 three-dimensional crystallographic point groups and 32 five-dimensional crystal families, and the maximum determinant in a 7 by 7 matrix of only zeroes and ones is 32. In sixteen dimensions, the sedenions generate a non-commutative loop formula_13 of order 32, and in thirty-two dimensions, there are at least 1,160,000,000 even unimodular lattices (of determinants 1 or −1); which is a marked increase from the twenty-four such Niemeier lattices that exists in twenty-four dimensions, or the single formula_14 lattice in eight dimensions (these lattices only exist for dimensions formula_15). Furthermore, the 32nd dimension is the first dimension that holds &quot;non-critical&quot; even unimodular lattices that do not interact with a Gaussian potential function of the form formula_16 of root formula_17 and formula_18.

32 is the furthest point in the set of natural numbers formula_19 where the ratio of primes (2, 3, 5, ..., 31) to non-primes (0, 1, 4, ..., 32) is formula_20

The trigintaduonions form a 32-dimensional hypercomplex number system.

<text>34 (thirty-four) is the natural number following 33 and preceding 35.

==In mathematics==
34 is the twelfth semiprime, with four divisors including 1 and itself. Specifically, 34 is the ninth distinct semiprime, it being the sixth of the form formula_1. Its neighbors 33 and 35 are also distinct semiprimes with four divisors each, where 34 is the smallest number to be surrounded by numbers with the same number of divisors it has. This is the first distinct semiprime treble cluster, the next being (85, 86, 87).

34 is the sum of the first two perfect numbers 6 + 28, whose difference is its composite index (22).

Its reduced totient and Euler totient values are both 16 (or 42 = 24). The sum of all its divisors aside from one equals 53, which is the sixteenth prime number.

There is no solution to the equation φ(&quot;x&quot;) = 34, making 34 a nontotient. Nor is there a solution to the equation &quot;x&quot; − φ(&quot;x&quot;) = 34, making 34 a noncototient.

It is the third Erdős–Woods number, following 22 and 16.

It is the ninth Fibonacci number and a companion Pell number. 
Since it is an odd-indexed Fibonacci number, 34 is a Markov number. 

34 is also the fourth heptagonal number, and the first non-trivial centered hendecagonal (11-gonal) number.

This number is also the magic constant of formula_2Queens Problem for formula_3.

There are 34 topologically distinct convex heptahedra, excluding mirror images.

34 is the magic constant of a formula_4 normal magic square, and magic octagram (see accompanying images); it is the only formula_5 for which magic constants of these formula_6 magic figures coincide.

<text>The Air Mobility Command (AMC) is a Major Command (MAJCOM) of the U.S. Air Force. It is headquartered at Scott Air Force Base, Illinois, east of St. Louis, Missouri, near Mascoutah, Illinois.

Air Mobility Command was established on 1 June 1992 and was formed from elements of the inactivated Military Airlift Command (MAC) and Strategic Air Command (SAC). AMC melded MAC&#x27;s worldwide airlift system of primarily C-5 Galaxy, C-141 Starlifter (later replaced by C-17 Globemaster III beginning in 1995), and C-130 Hercules airlift aircraft with SAC&#x27;s tanker force of KC-135 Stratotanker and KC-10 Extender aerial refueling aircraft, the latter air refueling aircraft having been freed from their strategic nuclear strike commitment to SAC&#x27;s B-52 Stratofortress and B-1 Lancer bomber fleet by the end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union. In 2016, the Air Force Historical Research Agency consolidated the histories of AMC and MAC, extending AMC&#x27;s lineage back to 1941.

==Overview==
Air Mobility Command&#x27;s mission is to provide global air mobility. The command also plays a crucial role in providing humanitarian support at home and around the world. AMC Airmen – active duty, Air National Guard, and Air Force Reserve, augmented by the civilian airliners and flight crews of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) – provide airlift and aerial refueling for all of the United States armed forces. Many special duty and operational support aircraft (OSA) and stateside aeromedical evacuation missions are also assigned to AMC.

U.S. forces must provide a rapid, tailored response that can intervene against a well-equipped foe, hit hard, and terminate quickly. Rapid global mobility lies at the heart of U.S. strategy in this environment. Without the capability to project forces, there is no conventional deterrent. As the number of U.S. forces stationed overseas continues to decline, global interests remain, making the capabilities AMC can provide even more in demand.

Air Mobility Command also has the mission of establishing bare air bases in contingencies. To accomplish this mission, AMC established two Contingency Response Wings, and operates the Eagle Flag exercise.

In addition to its status as a MAJCOM of the Air Force, AMC is also the Air Force component command of the United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM). It provides airlift, special missions, aerial refueling, and aeromedical evacuation for the United States armed forces. It also provides alert aerial refueling aircraft to the United States Strategic Command, and is a provider of theater airlift, aerial refueling, and aeromedical evacuation forces to the regional Unified Combatant Commands. AMC also operates VIP flights such as Air Force One, Air Force Two, and other Special Assignment Airlift Missions (SAAM). Finally, AMC acts as the single manager, on behalf of United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM), for Military Space Available Travel.

Principal aircraft assets of the command include: C-17 Globemaster III, C-5 Galaxy, C-130 Hercules, KC-135 Stratotanker, C-40 Clipper, C-37 Gulfstream V, and the C-21 Learjet. As of 2022, the command continues to integrate the KC-46 Pegasus within air refueling wings and air mobility wings in both the Active Component and the Air Reserve Component (ARC, i.e., the Air Force Reserve Command and the Air National Guard). In 2024, AMC retired the final KC-10 Extender from its inventory.

AMC also operates and maintains additional aircraft in support of high-profile VIP airlift include: VC-25, C-32, C-20G, C-20H, C-37 and the C-38, with the majority of that mission conducted by AMC&#x27;s 89th Airlift Wing.

Additional long-range airlift aircraft are available during national emergencies through the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF), a fleet of civilian commercial aircraft committed to support the transportation of military forces and material in times of crisis.

==Operations==

AMC has undergone considerable change since its establishment.

Focusing on the core mission of strategic air mobility, the command divested itself of infrastructure and forces not directly related to Global Reach. Divestments included the former Air Rescue Service, the Air Force Rescue Coordination Center (AFRCC), intratheater aeromedical airlift forces based overseas, and much of the operational support airlift fleet. Most of these activities were transferred to other commands, such as Air Combat Command (ACC). ACC would later inactivate the Air Rescue Service while continuing to maintain the AFRCC under 1st Air Force.

However, all KC-10 Extender and most KC-135 Stratotanker air refueling aircraft initially assigned to Air Combat Command following the disestablishment of Strategic Air Command (SAC) were transferred to AMC, along with Grand Forks AFB, McConnell AFB and Fairchild AFB.

As a result of the Global War on Terrorism, on 1 October 2003, AMC underwent a major restructuring, bringing a war fighting role to its numbered air force. AMC reactivated Eighteenth Air Force (18 AF) and established it as its main war fighting force. As subordinate components of 18 AF, AMC redesignated its two former numbered air forces as Expeditionary Mobility Task Forces (EMTF). Fifteenth Air Force was redesignated as the Fifteenth Air Force (15 EMTF), headquartered at Travis AFB, and Twenty-First Air Force was redesignated as the Twenty-First Air Force (21 EMTF), headquartered at McGuire AFB.

AMC&#x27;s ability to provide global reach is tested daily. From providing fuel, supplies and aeromedical support to troops on the frontline of the Global War on Terrorism, to providing humanitarian supplies to hurricane, flood, and earthquake victims both at home and abroad, AMC has been engaged in almost nonstop operations since its inception. Command tankers and airlifters have supported peacekeeping and humanitarian efforts in Afghanistan, Bosnia, Iraq, Cambodia, Somalia, Rwanda and Haiti, and continue to play a vital role in the ongoing Global War on Terrorism. The USAF believes that air mobility is a national asset of growing importance for responding to emergencies and protecting national interests around the globe.

AMC coordinates wildlife management on overseas runways between several agencies, including deployments in southwest Asia. Where necessary AMC cooperates outside the DOD such as with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). This includes obtaining USDA bird netting solutions to fill the military&#x27;s need for bird strike defense.

==Aircraft==
AMC accepted its first C-17 Globemaster III at Charleston AFB, South Carolina, on 14 June 1993, and declared initial operational capability on 17 January 1995. AMC&#x27;s second C-17 wing was established at McChord AFB, Washington, in July 1999. The versatile C-17, America&#x27;s core military airlift platform, is a key player in the Air Force&#x27;s post-Cold War strategy of &quot;global reach, global power.&quot;

The C-17 replaced the C-141 Starlifter fleet inherited from Military Airlift Command (MAC). C-141s were retired as C-17s were accepted into the inventory. First seeing operational service in 1965 under the Military Air Transport Service (MATS), the last Starlifters were retired in the early 2000s. By 2004, the C-141 left AMC service with active duty USAF units, being confined to Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard units for the remainder of its operational service life. In 2004, 2005, and 2006, the C-141s assigned to the 445 AW participated in missions to Iraq and Afghanistan, mostly for the medical evacuation of wounded service members. The last eight C-141s were officially retired in 2006.

The C-5 Galaxy airlifter, also inherited from MAC, is being modernized and upgraded into the C-5M Super Galaxy model. It is planned to modernize all C-5Bs and C-5Cs and many of the C-5As to the C-5M standard. The first C-5M conversion was completed on 16 May 2006 and performed its first flight on 19 June 2006. AMC received its final C-5M conversation on 1 August 2018. It is estimated that the modifications will extend the service life of the C-5 to about 2040.

AMC fields the C-130J Super Hercules as its tactical airlift platform. Most legacy models of the C-130 Hercules (e.g., C-130E, C-130H, C-130H2) in AFRC and ANG units have been or will eventually be replaced by the C-130J Super Hercules. The C-130 family has the longest continuous production run of any military aircraft in history and has served in every branch of the U.S. armed forces except the U.S. Army and U.S. Space Force. During more than 50 years of service, the C-130 has participated in military, civilian, and humanitarian aid operations. It is likely that future improvements to the C-130 will mean the design will be in service into the foreseeable future.

The upgrades of the inherited Strategic Air Command KC-135 Stratotanker to E, R, RT, and T models have extended their airframe and powerplant lifetimes to 36,000 (E) and 39,000 flying hours (R, RT and T), respectively. The last KC-135E was retired in 2009 and all remaining operational USAF KC-135 aircraft are of the KC-135R, KC-135RT, or KC-135T series. Acquired by SAC in the late 1950s, according to the Air Force, only a few KC-135s would reach these lifetime limits before 2040; but at that time, some of the aircraft would be about 80 years old. The Air Force estimates that their current fleet of KC-135s have between 12,000 and 14,000 flying hours on them, only 33 percent of the lifetime flying hour limit and none will meet the limit until 2040. Therefore, the USAF has decided to replace the KC-135 fleet. However, since there were originally over 500 KC-135s with the since-retired KC-135E included, these aircraft will be replaced gradually, with the first batch of about 100 aircraft to be replaced in the current buy. The effort to replace the KC-135 has been marked by intense controversy.

The 59 KC-10 Extender tankers, originally acquired in the 1980s by SAC, operated largely in the refueling of large numbers of fighter aircraft on ferry flights, the refueling of heavy bomber or other transport aircraft, or as supplemental airlift aircraft for palletized cargo, augmenting the C-5 and C-17 fleet. AMC retired the KC-10 fleet in 2024. Conversely, the KC-135 fleet has operated largely in the in-theater role. In an attempt to modernize the platform, the USAF has awarded Boeing a US$216 million contract to upgrade its fleet of 59 aircraft with new communication, navigation, and surveillance and air traffic management system to operate into the 2020s.

==History==
The direct successor to the USAF Military Airlift Command, the emblem of Air Mobility Command retained the historic emblem of not only the Military Airlift Command, but also the Military Air Transport Service (MATS), established in 1948 as the first Department of Defense Unified Command. The heritage of Air Mobility Command also includes the air refueling heritage inherited from the historic Strategic Air Command.

<text>Airman basic (AB) is the lowest enlisted rank in the United States Air Force immediately below airman. The male form of rank designation also applies to women. The pay grade for airman basic is E-1.

As opposed to all other USAF enlisted and officer ranks, airman basic has no rank insignia affiliated. The lack of uniform insignia for airman basic is the reason for the nickname &quot;slick-sleeve&quot;; all other enlisted Air Force ranks wear stripes and chevrons on their uniform sleeves.

In accordance with Air Force Instruction (AFI) 36-2618, &quot;The Enlisted Force Structure&quot;, the term of address for an airman basic is &quot;Airman Basic&quot; or &quot;Airman&quot;.

==History==
When the U.S. Air Force was split from the U.S. Army on July 26, 1947, it inherited the U.S. Army&#x27;s enlisted ranks; the lowest U.S. Air Force enlisted rank became &quot;private&quot; (falling immediately below private, E-2), which wore no rank insignia.

In March 1952, the Air Council and United States Air Force Chief of Staff General Hoyt Vandenberg adopted a number of changes to the U.S. Air Force enlisted rank structure that had been recommended by studies made in 1950 and 1951. On April 24, 1952, Air Force Regulation 39-36 was published, changing the name of the lowest enlisted U.S. Air Force rank to &quot;basic airman&quot;—whose holders still bore no insignia—immediately below the new &quot;airman third class&quot;.

On February 5, 1959, the new Air Force regulation governing the titles of enlisted ranks was released; the only change being direction that the title for E-1 was changed from &quot;basic airman&quot; to &quot;airman basic&quot;.

==Promotion from airman basic==
Under normal circumstances, airmen basic are eligible for promotion to airman (E-2) after six months&#x27; time in grade (TIG). However, individuals enlisting for six years are promoted from AB to airman first class (A1C) upon completion of either technical training (or 20 weeks thereof) or the indoctrination course for combat control or pararescue.

==Demotion to airman basic==
If an airman of E-2 or higher rank is court-martialed and convicted of an offense or crime, s/he may be demoted to airman basic, with or without being discharged (dishonorably or otherwise) from the service.

In accordance with AFI 36-2502, &quot;Airman Promotion Program&quot;, all promotions from AB require that an airman&#x27;s immediate commanding officer approve the promotion in writing before he or she may assume it.

<text>RNIB (formally, the Royal National Institute of Blind People and previously the Royal National Institute for the Blind) is a British charity, founded in 1868, that serves people living with visual impairments. It is regarded as a leader in the field in supporting people in the UK who have vision loss. The organisation seeks to increase awareness of the lived experiences of people who are blind or partially sighted. Additionally, it campaigns to make services such as healthcare, education and public transport safer and more accessible to people with visual impairments.

The Charity Commission for England and Wales investigated the charity from 2018 to 2020, finding multiple failings described by the Commission&#x27;s chief executive as &quot;one of the worst examples we have uncovered of poor governance and oversight having a direct impact on vulnerable people.&quot; The RNIB began selling all its eighteen schools, homes and other institutions.

==History==
RNIB was first established on 16 October 1868 as the British and Foreign Society for Improving the Embossed Literature of the Blind. The first meeting, which was held at 33 Cambridge Square, Hyde Park, London, involved founder Thomas Rhodes Armitage (a physician who was partially sighted) and Daniel Conolly, W W Fenn and Dr James Gale (all three of whom were blind). Later, the organisation became the British and Foreign Blind Association for Improving the Embossed Literature of the Blind and Promoting the Employment of the Blind – generally shortened to the British and Foreign Blind Association.

In 1914, the organisation relocated to larger premises in Great Portland Street. From 2000 until 2023, RNIB operated from premises on Judd Street, in Bloomsbury, London, which it shared with Guide Dogs. In 2023, The Duchess of Edinburgh opened the organisation&#x27;s new headquarters in the Grimaldi Building on Pentonville Road, London, which has been adapted to cater for the needs of people who are blind, partially sighted or neurodivergent.

RNIB&#x27;s remit has always included reading and writing (e.g. Braille), education and employment. From the 20th century, welfare/social support has been important. However, it was not till the late 1980s that eye health became a major focus. Previously, eye health was seen as the sole prerogative of ophthalmologists and optometrists.

In 1914, the organisation changed its name to The National Institute for the Blind, or NIB, to reflect its status as a national body involved in all aspects of the welfare of blind people. The organisation was officially renamed the Royal National Institute for the Blind in 1953, having been granted a Royal Charter in 1949. In 2002, the organisation was renamed the Royal National Institute of the Blind (&quot;of&quot; rather than &quot;for&quot; blind people) when it became a membership organisation. To coincide with the launch of the UK Vision Strategy in 2008, it was renamed the Royal National Institute of Blind People. In October 2008, RNIB and Action for Blind People agreed in principle to combine some services across England. The new arrangement began in April 2009, resulting in Action for Blind People becoming an associate charity of RNIB. It merged with RNIB on 1 April 2017.

Anna Tylor, who is partially sighted, has been RNIB&#x27;s Chair since 2020. Matt Stringer was appointed Chief Executive in 2019. King Charles III is the charity&#x27;s Patron. His mother, Queen Elizabeth II, was RNIB&#x27;s Patron throughout her reign (1952–2022).

==Programmes and services==
RNIB&#x27;s helpline gives access to sight loss experts for questions and guidance. 

RNIB&#x27;s extensive range of reading services includes RNIB Bookshare – a free library of over one million items, which supports students and others in education with a vast collection of accessible textbooks and materials – and Talking Books, a service first established in 1935, which offers thousands of audio books, both fiction and non-fiction.

RNIB’s ECLO (Eye Care Liaison Officers) service aims to help patients understand the impact of a sight loss diagnosis and to direct them to appropriate sources of support.

Since the 1950s, the children&#x27;s puppet character Sooty is an exclusive feature on the charity&#x27;s collection boxes.

==Campaigning==
RNIB campaigns to change behaviours and perceptions around sight loss. It has been involved with several large-scale campaigns including calls for action to create a safer and more inclusive public transport system. In 2023, the charity played a key role in a national campaign to scrap plans to close ticket offices in train stations. In 2022, the charity launched its largest-ever advertising campaign, &quot;See the person, not the sight loss&quot;, to raise awareness of sight loss and the support that people who have visual impairments might need. Along with other leading health charities, RNIB lobbied throughout 2023 for better disability support across the National Health Service (NHS).

The charity has campaigned for mandatory secret ballots for people with visual impairments. After the 2024 general election RNIB delivered an open letter to 10 Downing Street highlighting that according to its research roughly 87% of the UK&#x27;s citizens with visual impairments were denied their right to vote in secret. The campaign follows a 2019 court judgement that declared the UK&#x27;s current voting arrangements for people with blindness or visual impairments to be unlawful. RNIB pointed out that in spite of the judgement, the majority of the UK&#x27;s visually impaired voters do so using technology that requires them to be accompanied into the voting booth and have their choices read aloud by an assistant. only one person living with blindness in the UK has voted in secret, using a device known as the McGonagle Reader. This comprises an audio player with headphones and a plastic template to locate the boxes on the paper.

==Schools, homes and other institutions==
RNIB used to run a number of schools, homes, and other institutions. In 2018, an Ofsted report was highly critical of the RNIB Pears Centre for Specialist Learning, near Coventry, which comprised a school and a children&#x27;s home, founded in 1957 as Rushton Hall School. Ofsted described it as inadequate in three categories and requiring improvement in the other two. It highlighted failures in safeguarding the vulnerable children and in training staff to support them. Later that year, RNIB announced that it had been unable to make sufficient improvements and was closing the Centre; RNIB&#x27;s chief executive resigned.

Also in 2018, the Charity Commission for England and Wales launched its own inquiry into RNIB following serious allegations of systemic failings within the organisation. In 2020, the Commission ruled that there had been significant management, oversight, and staffing shortcomings which had led to repeated incidents where young people in the charity&#x27;s care were put at risk or harmed. The Charity Commission&#x27;s chief executive described this investigation as &quot;one of the worst examples we have uncovered of poor governance and oversight having a direct impact on vulnerable people.&quot; The Commission stated that RNIB&#x27;s corporate stewardship of services for children with complex needs fell far short of expectations and that the charity&#x27;s board had been focused on narrow regulatory compliance and dismissive of criticism from the regulatory organisations it was accountable to – the Care Quality Commission and Ofsted. It found failures in training, safeguarding, record-keeping, reporting, responding to complaints, and the administration of medication, as well as instances of harm.

It was then reported that RNIB was selling all eighteen of its care homes and schools. The Charity Commission gave RNIB an official warning and required it to overhaul its governance, management and culture. In light of RNIB&#x27;s progress in fulfilling the action plan, the Charity Commission withdrew its adverse decision in June 2022.

<doc id="391930" wikidata="Q4704500" url="?curid=391930" title="Al Murray">
<text>Alastair James Hay Murray (born 10 May 1968) is an English comedian, actor, musician and writer.

After graduating from the University of Oxford, Murray&#x27;s comedy career began by working with Harry Hill for BBC Radio 4. He regularly performed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, before launching his &quot;Pub Landlord&quot; persona. This led to the Sky One sitcom &quot;Time Gentlemen Please&quot; and the chat show &quot;Al Murray&#x27;s Happy Hour&quot; for ITV.

In 2003, Murray was listed in &quot;The Observer&quot; as one of the 50 funniest acts in British comedy, and in 2007 he was voted the 16th greatest stand-up comic on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Stand-Ups.&quot; He continues to perform as a stand-up and is a regular on British TV and radio.

==Early life and family background==
Murray was born in Stewkley, Buckinghamshire. His father was a lieutenant colonel in 131 (Parachute) Regiment, Royal Engineers and worked for British Rail. A descendant of the novelist William Makepeace Thackeray, Murray&#x27;s grandfather was the former British ambassador Sir Ralph Murray, from the Scottish aristocracy and married into the Kuenberg family, Counts of the Holy Roman Empire. His maternal grandfather was killed in action at the Battle of Dunkirk.

Murray was educated at Bedford School. He played percussion in the Bedfordshire County Youth Orchestra, which was based in Bedford; the orchestra played concerts with the Bedfordshire county choirs. He also performed in the Bedfordshire second youth orchestra, in Dunstable. With the orchestra he performed in Spain, France and Scotland.

Murray later said of his time at school: &quot;When I was nine I was sent to boarding school, which I despised. The first five years were hideous because I wanted to be at home. I guess I resented my parents a little and it put tons of distance between us. One of the things I took from boarding school is that it made me emotionally self-sufficient.&quot;

Murray read Modern History at St Edmund Hall, Oxford. He performed in the comedy group the Oxford Revue, in a show directed by Stewart Lee.

==Career==
Having started out by touring with comedians such as Harry Hill and Frank Skinner, Murray won the Perrier Award at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 1999, after being nominated in 1996, 1997 and 1998. He started out with an act that involved sound-effect impressions, including guns, animals and a car boot. He made his first TV appearance on Channel 4&#x27;s The Word in November 1991. With this act, he supported Jim Tavaré in Leeds in winter 1992.

In 1994–95, Murray was the drummer in the band Evangelista, the house band at Stewart Lee and Simon Munnery&#x27;s experimental Cluub Zarathustra in London. Film maker Martin Pickles made a short film about the band in 2002. At this time the lead singer Reid said of Murray: &quot;He&#x27;s still not a household name, but anyone who&#x27;s into comedy knows who Al Murray is&quot;.

===The Pub Landlord===
Murray&#x27;s principal character in performance is an English publican with conservative values and an animosity towards Germans and the French; he challenges audience members to name any country before producing some plausible instance of Britain bettering it. The character has a great love of the British 1970s rock band Queen, often getting musician(s) on his show to perform one of Queen&#x27;s tunes in their own style. He has described his persona as a &quot;know-all know-nothing blowhard who knows the answer to every question even though he hasn&#x27;t been asked any of them&quot;.

The character first appeared in 1994 during the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, in the show &quot;Pub Internationale&quot;, with Harry Hill and Matthew Bradstock-Smith (who played &quot;Little Alan&quot; as well as the keyboards in Hill&#x27;s Edinburgh, radio and TV shows). The show featured the &quot;Pub Band&quot;, with Murray playing the drums and compering. After trying out a character deemed not to have worked, at the opening show Murray suggested saying that the compere had not made it to the show and that the barman in the venue, the Pleasance Cabaret Bar, had offered to fill in. At the Edinburgh Festival, Murray came up with &quot;The Pub Landlord&quot;.

Murray made his first television appearances on &quot;Harry Hill&quot; in 1997 playing Harry&#x27;s big brother Alan (&quot;If it&#x27;s too hard, I can&#x27;t understand it!&quot;), and subsequently featured in a short film, &quot;Pub Fiction.&quot; He made a brief appearance as the Pub Landlord in Series 2, Episode 6 of Lee and Herring&#x27;s &quot;This Morning with Richard Not Judy&quot;. Murray&#x27;s Pub Landlord theatre show, &quot;My Gaff, My Rules&quot; was short-listed for an Olivier Award in 2002.

The Pub Landlord is the central character in the television series &quot;Time Gentlemen Please&quot;. He has made many other television appearances, including the &quot;An Audience with...&quot; strand. He hosted three series of &quot;Al Murray&#x27;s Happy Hour&quot; in a peak Saturday evening time slot for ITV in 2007–08.

Theatre tours have included &quot;...And a Glass of White Wine for the Lady&quot; (another catchphrase) and &quot;Giving it Both Barrels&quot;.

The Pub Landlord has hosted television programmes including &quot;Fact Hunt&quot;, named after the fictional quiz machine of the same name from &quot;Time Gentlemen Please&quot;. In addition, the character has ghost written four books: &quot;The Pub Landlord&#x27;s Book of British Common Sense, The Pub Landlord&#x27;s Think Yourself British, The Pub Landlord&#x27;s Great British Quiz Book&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Re-Great Britain&quot;.

In 2024 The Pub Landlord returned on the road touring the UK and Ireland with a new show &quot;Guv Island&quot;..

===Other work===
Murray has an interest in music and is a semi-professional drummer. As a teenager, he played in the big band at Bedford School, and also played percussion in the Bedfordshire County Youth Orchestra. He plays drums for the rock covers band &quot;T-34&quot; and appeared at the Download Festival in 2010, returning once again in 2011. Murray is a fan of the progressive rock bands Genesis, King Crimson and Yes. He appeared in the documentary &quot;&quot;, and was announced as the host of the 2019 Progressive Music Awards for &quot;Prog&quot; magazine.

Murray played in the Hampshire located Folk Rock band: Bemis &quot;Folk Rock That Breathes New life into The Spirit of Woodstock&quot;

In 2013, Murray guest-starred in series 5 of children&#x27;s show &quot;Horrible Histories&quot;.

Murray presented &quot;Al Murray&#x27;s Road to Berlin&quot; on the Discovery Channel. This was a series about the last phase of the Second World War, taking him from the beaches of Normandy, through Arnhem and up the Rhine, ending in Berlin. He drove around in a restored Willys jeep, and interviewed survivors from both sides of the war. In the episode about Operation Market Garden he parachuted, together with veterans, from an aircraft, to commemorate the battle.

Murray starred in &quot;Al Murray&#x27;s Multiple Personality Disorder&quot;, a sketch show, which aired in early 2009. In late 2010, Murray made a documentary on German culture for BBC Four &quot;Al Murray&#x27;s German Adventure&quot; in which he presented a different side of the German nation from the one portrayed by &quot;The Pub Landlord&quot; character.

Murray invented his own potato crisps – branded &quot;Steak and Al Pie&quot; – as entered in a &quot;crisp competition&quot; hosted by Gary Lineker, used to raise money for Comic Relief. The other flavours were &quot;Jimmy Con Carne&quot; (Jimmy Carr), &quot;Stephen Fry-Up&quot; (Stephen Fry) and &quot;Frank Roast Dinner&quot; (Frank Skinner). The winner was Stephen Fry-up at 27%, with Al&#x27;s in 2nd with 25%. The other two got 24% each.

In April 2016, Murray played Nick Bottom in &quot;Shakespeare Live&quot;, a celebration of 400 years of Shakespeare, opposite Judi Dench as Titania. In 2018 he starred in pantomime at the New Wimbledon Theatre, as Jack&#x27;s brother Al, in &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot;, winning &#x27;Best Newcomer&#x27; for this role, at the Great British Pantomime Awards in April 2018. In 2016, Murray appeared in &quot;Taskmaster&quot; series 3. He finished third overall.

In October 2018, Murray fronted the History channel TV series &quot;Al Murray: Why Does Everyone Hate The English&quot;, appearing both as Al Murray and his alter-ego The Pub Landlord. The series looks at the historical rivalries between England and its closest neighbours and features comedians Antoine de Caunes, Elis James, Andrew Maxwell, Fred MacAulay and Henning Wehn representing their respective nations.

In 2019, Murray starred as his own ancestor William Makepeace Thackeray in a three-part BBC Radio 4 adaptation of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; by Jim Poyser, with additional material by himself.

In April 2019, Murray started a podcast with historian James Holland called &#x27;We Have Ways of Making You Talk&#x27;, where they discuss battles and campaigns of World War II. Over 700 episodes have been released, including interviews with veterans and other historians, as well as Murray&#x27;s narration of the book, &#x27;The Cauldron&#x27; by Zeno.

In October 2021, Murray presented the Sky History programme &quot;Why Do the Brits Win Every War?&quot; In each episode, Murray was joined by a different guest in examining conflicts against the Romans, Vikings, Scottish, French, Americans, and Germans. The programme features Bruno Tonioli, John Thomson, Sanjeev Kohli, Reginald D. Hunter, and Henning Wehn.

In 2023, Murray co-wrote with Matt Forde and Sean Foley and is a voiceover artist &quot;Idiots Assemble: Spitting Image The Musical&quot; based on the TV series &quot;Spitting Image&quot;, which premiered at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre in February, before transferring to London&#x27;s West End at the Phoenix Theatre in May for 13 weeks.

Murray played the part of King Charles II in &quot;The Crown Jewels&quot;, a humorous play written by screenwriter Simon Nye and performed at the Garrick Theatre in London in 2023, about Colonel Blood&#x27;s theft of the Crown Jewels in 1671. The part of Blood was played by Aidan McArdle, and the cast also included Neil Morrissey and Mel Giedroyc.

He published the book &quot;Arnhem: Black Tuesday&quot; in September 2024.

==Parliamentary candidacy==
On 14 January 2015, Murray announced his formation of the &quot;Free United Kingdom Party&quot; (FUKP) and declared his candidacy, deploying his Pub Landlord persona, for the seat of South Thanet running against UKIP leader Nigel Farage, as parliamentary candidate in the 2015 general election. Murray&#x27;s agent, Dan Lloyd, told the BBC: &quot;it&#x27;s definitely happening&quot;. The party&#x27;s logo is an upside-down pound sign, not dissimilar to UKIP&#x27;s purple and gold pound sign. Murray said: &quot;it seems to me that the UK is ready for a bloke waving a pint around, offering common sense solutions&quot;, adding: &quot;let it be known that like many of the parliamentary hopefuls in the forthcoming election, I have no idea where South Thanet is – but did that stop Margaret Thatcher from saving the Falkland Islands? No!”

Farage appeared to welcome his new opponent on Twitter, saying &quot;the more, the merrier&quot;, and a spokesperson for the UKIP MEP said: &quot;at last, serious competition in the constituency&quot;. The Conservative candidate, Craig Mackinlay, said he enjoyed Murray&#x27;s video and his proclamations but was not worried that the comedian would split the anti-UKIP vote. Finally, the Labour candidate, Will Scobie, insisted it was &quot;always good to have people putting their names forward to stand&quot; and that Murray would &quot;certainly make things interesting&quot;. When nominations for South Thanet were released on 9 April 2015, it was confirmed that Murray would appear on the ballot paper with no description, rather than his FUKP name and emblem.

The results of the election were announced on 8 May, revealing that Murray received 318 votes. When it was announced that Farage had failed to get elected, coming second in the poll to the Conservative candidate Craig Mackinlay, Murray&#x27;s reaction – feigning shock and clapping on stage – garnered widespread media attention. Speaking to the media during the vote count, Murray invited Farage to a drink in his pub to drown his sorrow at losing.

==Political views and activism==
Murray, together with Stephen Fry, supported Paul Chambers&#x27;s High Court appeals after Chambers had been arrested for contravening the Communications Act 2003 when a joke tweet was regarded by police as &quot;menacing&quot; and a terrorist threat. An appeal against Chambers&#x27;s conviction was successful.

In August 2014, Murray was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

==Personal life==
Murray married Amber Hargreaves in 2002. The couple, who have two daughters, separated in 2008. He now resides in Chiswick. He subsequently had a third daughter, Daisy with his partner, Eleanor Relf in 2018. 

Murray is a keen cricket fan, and was invited to attend a farewell lunch for the England cricket team before their departure for the 2013–14 Ashes series. 

Murray was awarded an honorary degree (Hon MA) by the University of Bedfordshire in 2014, and an honorary doctorate of Social Science (Hon SScD) by the University of Wolverhampton in 2017.

<text>Jan &quot;Stefan&quot; Edberg (; born 19 January 1966) is a Swedish former professional tennis player. He was ranked as the world No. 1 in both men&#x27;s singles and men&#x27;s doubles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), one of two players in the Open Era to hold both positions (alongside John McEnroe). Edberg won 41 career singles titles and 18 doubles titles, including nine majors: six in singles and three in men&#x27;s doubles. A major practitioner of the serve-and-volley style of tennis, Edberg also won the 1989 year-end championships, led Sweden to four Davis Cup titles, and won four Masters Series titles and four Championship Series titles. After retirement, Edberg coached Roger Federer from January 2014 to December 2015.

==Career==
Edberg first came to the tennis world&#x27;s attention as a junior player. In the early 1980s, he won the European Junior Championships in the Under 14 and Under 16 categories, beating Jonas Svensson in both finals. He then won all four Grand Slam junior titles in 1983 to become the first (and only) player to achieve the &quot;Junior Grand Slam&quot; in the open era. Later that year as a professional, Edberg won his first career doubles title in Basel.

In 1984, Edberg won his first top-level singles title in Milan. Edberg also won the tennis tournament at the 1984 Summer Olympics when the sport was an exhibition event and partnered with fellow Swede Anders Järryd to reach the final of the US Open. Edberg also reached the French Open doubles final with Järryd in 1986 and consequently was world No. 1 in doubles in that year.

U.S. fans first took notice of Edberg&#x27;s professional career when he won the U.S. Indoor in Memphis in February 1985, defeating Yannick Noah in the final. Edberg&#x27;s first two Grand Slam singles titles came at the Australian Open. In December 1985, he defeated No. 1 Ivan Lendl in a five-set epic in the Australian Open semifinals stopped multiple times by rain and played over two days. He then defeated Mats Wilander in straight sets to claim his first major title. In January 1987, he defended his title by defeating local favourite Pat Cash in five sets to win the last Australian Open held on grass courts. Edberg also won the Australian Open and US Open men&#x27;s doubles titles in 1987 (partnering fellow Swede Anders Järryd).

In 1988, Edberg reached the first of three consecutive finals at Wimbledon, but lost his ranking as Sweden&#x27;s number-one-player when Mats Wilander had his best year by winning the Australian, French and US Opens, becoming the world&#x27;s number-one-ranked player. In all three of his consecutive Wimbledon finals, Edberg played German Boris Becker in what became one of Wimbledon&#x27;s greatest rivalries. Edberg won their first encounter in a four-set match spread over two days because of rain delays. A year later, Becker won in straight sets. The closest of their matches came in the 1990 final, when Edberg won in five sets after being down a break in the fifth set.

Edberg reached the French Open final in 1989 but lost in five sets to 17-year-old Michael Chang, who became the youngest-ever male winner of a Grand Slam singles title. This was the only Grand Slam singles title that Edberg never won, denying him the completion of a career Grand Slam at the senior level, to match his junior Grand Slam.

In 1990, an abdominal muscle injury forced Edberg to retire from the Australian Open final while trailing Ivan Lendl 5–2 (including two breaks of serve) in the third set. Edberg nevertheless took the world No. 1 ranking from Lendl on 13 August 1990 by winning the Super 9 tournament in Cincinnati. He held it for the rest of that year and for much of 1991 and 1992. Edberg spent a total of 72 weeks as World No. 1. In 1991, Edberg again reached the semifinals of Wimbledon but lost to Michael Stich in a close match: 6–4, 6–7, 6–7, 6–7.

Edberg&#x27;s final two Grand Slam singles triumphs came at the US Open, with wins over Jim Courier in the 1991 final and Pete Sampras (who was just months away from attaining the world No. 1 ranking) in the 1992 final. At the 1992 US Open, Edberg defeated Lendl in a five-set thriller spread over 2 days in the quarterfinals. He then beat Michael Chang in the longest US Open match in history, in the semifinals, at 5 hours and 26 minutes.

Edberg reached the finals of the Australian Open again in 1992 and 1993, losing both times to Jim Courier in four sets. He was one of the few players who reached the finals of the Australian Open five times. The 1993 Australian Open final was Edberg&#x27;s last Grand Slam singles final appearance.

In 1996, Edberg reached the finals of Queens Club but lost the match to Boris Becker. He won his third and final Grand Slam doubles title at the Australian Open with Petr Korda. He reached the quarterfinals of his last US Open after defeating Richard Krajicek and Tim Henman, but lost in the quarterfinals to Goran Ivanišević.

Edberg was most comfortable playing tennis on fast-playing surfaces. Of his six Grand Slam singles titles, four were won on grass courts at the Australian Open (1985 and 1987) and Wimbledon (1988 and 1990) and two were won on hardcourts at the US Open (1991 and 1992).

In December 2013, Edberg began coaching Roger Federer. His coaching stint ended in December 2015 after which Federer hired Ivan Ljubičić as coach.

==Style of play==
Edberg is noted as one of the finest serve-and-volley players of his era. Edberg did not possess a powerful dominating serve like Pete Sampras or Boris Becker, but his serve was still largely effective. Edberg often chose to use a less powerful serve, such as a kick or slice serve. The extra time from using a slower serve gave Edberg more time to get to the net, where he used his quick feet and athleticism to gain control of the point. Edberg&#x27;s volleying skills were among the very best and he could easily redirect powerfully struck balls to the open court. He had sufficient groundstrokes, and his one-handed backhand was one of his marquee shots. Edberg&#x27;s backhand was extremely effective and considered amongst the best of his era.

==Equipment==
Throughout his career, Edberg used Wilson racquets and Adidas clothing and shoes.

==Post-career competitive racquet sports==
Edberg began playing competitive squash after his retirement from professional tennis and soon became an elite player in Sweden. When racketlon emerged as a growing sport in Scandinavia, Edberg&#x27;s pro-level tennis ability and emerging squash prowess made him highly competitive, despite his relative inexperience in badminton and table tennis.

In September 2008, Stefan Edberg officially joined the &quot;Black Rock Tour of Champions&quot;, a tour for professional tennis players who have retired from the ATP Tour. Edberg won his first tournament in Paris held on clay, winning matches against clay court specialists Thomas Muster in the opening round and Sergi Bruguera in the finals.

In January 2012, Edberg played a one-set exhibition against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in Doha, Qatar, and lost 5–7.

==Coaching==
Edberg signed a contract to become Roger Federer&#x27;s coach at the end of 2013. Their collaboration officially started at the 2014 Australian Open. Federer described Edberg&#x27;s role as &quot;more of a mentor than a coach&quot;; nonetheless, his influence has been widely regarded as pivotal in the Swiss champion&#x27;s eventual resurgence, especially in bringing effective and more frequent serve-and-volley and net charging to his game. Their collaboration ended in December 2015.

==Distinctions and honors==
* Edberg played on four Swedish Davis Cup winning teams in 1984, 1985, 1987 and 1994. He appeared in seven Davis Cup finals – a record for a Swedish player.
* Until 2016, the Australian Open logo was a silhouette of Stefan Edberg&#x27;s unique service action. It was then changed to the current logo to make it more friendly for the digital medium.
* Since the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) computer rankings began, Edberg and John McEnroe are the only men to be ranked world No. 1 in both singles and doubles. Edberg is also the only player to achieve the &quot;Junior Grand Slam&quot; in the history of the game.
* Edberg and McEnroe are also the only players to earn both Player of the Year and Doubles Team of the Year. Edberg won Player of the Year in 1990 and 1991 and Doubles Team of the Year (with fellow Swede Anders Järryd) in 1986.
* Edberg and Boris Becker are the only male tennis players ever to receive the United Press International Athlete of the Year Award (with Edberg having received the award in 1990).
* Edberg was also a member of the Swedish teams that won the World Team Cup in 1988, 1991, and 1995.
* At the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, where tennis was a demonstration sport, Edberg won the men&#x27;s singles gold medal. Four years later, at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, tennis became a full medal sport and Edberg won bronze medals in both the men&#x27;s singles and the men&#x27;s doubles.
* During his career, Edberg won a total of 41 top-level singles titles (6 majors) and 18 doubles titles (3 majors) and appeared in a then record 54 consecutive Grand Slam tournaments (since then broken by Wayne Ferreira).
* He was ranked the world no. 1 in singles for a total of 72 weeks.
* Edberg was a then-record five time recipient of the ATP Sportsmanship Award (1988–90, 1992, and 1995). In recognition of this achievement, the ATP renamed the award the Stefan Edberg Sportsmanship Award in 1996.
* In 1996, Edberg won the Philippe Chatrier Award for his contribution to tennis both on and off the court.
* Edberg won the International Club&#x27;s prestigious Jean Borotra Sportsmanship Award in 1998. 
* In 2004, Edberg was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island, United States.
* Edberg won singles titles in 12 countries: Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Qatar, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
* In 2008, Edberg was considered by &quot;Tennis Magazine&quot; to be the 14th greatest player, counting both male and female tennis players, of the &quot;Tennis Era&quot;. Counting men only, Edberg ranked eighth.
* Edberg was awarded the Svenska Dagbladet Gold Medal in 1990.
* Edberg is one of the few players who reached the final of all four Grand Slam tournaments, winning three of them. In the 1989 French Open final, Edberg led the match by two sets to one over Michael Chang and broke Chang&#x27;s serve in the opening game of the fourth set, only for Chang to break right back. From 1–1 to 4–4 in the fourth set, every Chang service game was a struggle where Chang had to save 11 break points while Edberg held comfortably in his service games. At 5–4 to Chang in the fourth set, Chang broke Edberg&#x27;s serve completely against the run of play to win the set. Edberg was also a break up early in the fifth set, but Chang won the fifth set 6–2 to take the title at the age of 17.
* Edberg won several Grand Slam matches after being down a break of serve in the fifth and deciding set. Notable examples include the 1985 Australian Open semi final against Ivan Lendl, the 1988 Wimbledon semi final against Miloslav Mečíř, the 1989 French Open semi final against Boris Becker, and the 1990 Wimbledon final against Becker. In the 1992 US Open, Edberg won from a break down in the fifth set in three consecutive matches, against Richard Krajicek in the fourth round, Ivan Lendl in the quarter-final, and Michael Chang in the semi-final. In all of these tournaments, with the exception of the 1989 French Open, Edberg went on to win the tournament.

==Personal life==
Edberg was born in Västervik, Sweden. He is married to Annette Hjort Olsen, whom he married in April 1992. They have two children, Emilie and Christopher. Olsen was previously in a relationship with Edberg&#x27;s tennis rival Mats Wilander before her relationship with Edberg began in 1985.

Edberg is a supporter of English football team Leeds United and the Swedish ice hockey team Växjö Lakers.

<doc id="391933" wikidata="Q5302765" url="?curid=391933" title="Down-low (sexual slang)">
<text>Down-low, sometimes shortened to DL, is an African-American slang term generally used within the African-American community that typically refers to a sexual subculture of black men who usually identify as heterosexual but actively seek sexual encounters and relations with other men, practice gay cruising, and frequently don a specific hip-hop attire during these activities. They generally avoid disclosing their same-sex sexual activities, even if they have female sexual partner(s), they are married to a woman, or they are single. The term is also used to refer to a related sexual identity. &quot;Down-low&quot; has been viewed as &quot;a type of impression management that some of the informants use to present themselves in a manner that is consistent with perceived norms about masculine attribute, attitudes, and behavior&quot;.

==Origins==
The term &quot;down-low&quot; originated within the African-American community, and was originally used to describe &quot;any kind of slick, secretive behavior, including infidelity in heterosexual relationships&quot;. In medical research, the term is used to identify sexual identity-behaviour discordance among men who have sex with men (MSM).

According to a study published in the &quot;Journal of Bisexuality&quot;, &quot;[t]he Down Low is a lifestyle predominately practiced by young, urban Black men who have sex with other men and women, yet do not identify as gay or bisexual&quot;.

In this context, &quot;being on the &quot;down-low&quot;&quot; is more than just men having sex with men in secret, or a variant of closeted homosexuality or bisexuality—it is a sexual identity that is, at least partly, defined by its &quot;cult of masculinity&quot; and its rejection of what is perceived as White American culture (including what is perceived as White American LGBT culture) and terms. A 2003 cover story in &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; on the &quot;down-low&quot; phenomenon explains that the American Black community sees &quot;homosexuality as a white man&#x27;s perversion.&quot; It then goes on to describe the &quot;down-low&quot; subculture as follows:

===Social context and American sexual subcultures===

In his book &quot;Beyond the Down Low: Sex, Lies and Denial in Black America&quot;, Keith Boykin states that secret homosexual relations are not unique to African-American men, and in fact occur in many societies and among all races.

In &quot;Power Plays, Power Works&quot; John Fiske suggests that closeted homosexuality may be more common in American communities suffering from widespread poverty, in which members reportedly depend heavily on traditional family networks (and often religious institutions) for financial and emotional support.

The term quickly became conflated with an eroticization of homosexual activities among Black and Latino men. Throughout the gay pornographic industry and internet networks, &quot;down-low&quot; quickly became a marketing term used to publicize pornographic movies, models, sex-clubs, and social gatherings that included Black and Latino men.

==Media interest==
The first known person to use the term &quot;down-low&quot; in a homosexual context was George Hanna, who used the term in the 1930 song &quot;Boy in the Boat&quot; about lesbian women. The term was popularized in the late 1990s and after by a series of mainstream media reports emphasizing the danger of Black men transmitting HIV/AIDS to their unsuspecting female partners.

The first mainstream media account of the &quot;down-low&quot; as a subculture of closeted homosexuality or bisexuality was reported in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; on February 7, 2001. By the end of the year, numerous major media outlets had reported on the down-low. They included &quot;The New York Times&quot; (11 February), &quot;USA Today&quot; (March 15), &quot;Columbus Dispatch&quot; (March 19), &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; (April 1), &quot;The New York Times&quot; (April 3), &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; (April 22), &quot;Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; (June 3), &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; (June 4), &quot;Village Voice&quot; (June 6), &quot;VIBE&quot; magazine (July), &quot;Jet&quot; magazine (September 8), &quot;Essence&quot; magazine (October), &quot;San Diego Union-Tribune&quot; (December 2), and &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; (December 7). Nearly all these stories connected the &quot;down-low&quot; phenomenon to the HIV/AIDS epidemic within the African-American community.

In the summer of 2003, &quot;Village Voice&quot; contributing writer and NYU professor Jason King published &quot;Remixing the Closet: The Down Low Way of Knowledge&quot;, in the newspaper&#x27;s June 2003 &quot;Queer Issue,&quot; a controversial op-ed piece that questioned the relationship between HIV/AIDS and men &quot;on the down low&quot;. The article was the first mainstream piece to openly criticize negative mainstream media depictions of &quot;down-low&quot; Black men and evaluated the &quot;down-low&quot; phenomenon from a different perspective.

King argued that the use of the term &quot;down-low&quot; was a way for many African-American men to admit to having sex with other men without necessarily identifying as &quot;gay&quot; in the traditional sense. On the heels of that article, &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; contributing writer Frank Leon Roberts published &quot;Stereotypes and Sexual Orientation: The &#x27;down-low&#x27; – Coming out your own way in [B]lack clubs&quot; in the newspaper&#x27;s July 23, 2003 issue.

Then in August 2003 &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; ran a cover story called &quot;Double Lives on the Down Low&quot;, written by Benoit Denizet-Lewis. Several episodes of &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; were also dedicated to the subject including an episode aired 16 April 2004 and titled &quot;A Secret Sex World: Living on the &#x27;Down Low&#x27; &quot;; the show featured J. L. King discussing his book &quot;On the Down Low: A Journey Into the Lives of Straight Black Men Who Sleep with Men&quot;. The &quot;down-low&quot; subculture was also part of story lines on episodes of the television shows &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, &quot;Homicide Hunter&quot;, &quot;The Starter Wife&quot;, &quot;ER&quot;, and &quot;Oz&quot;.

In 2003 Jeffrey Q. McCune Jr. wrote a full-length play entitled &quot;Dancin the Down Low&quot; that he directed and produced at Northwestern University in April 2004. In addition, McCune has dedicated a dissertation on this topic. His study examines discourses on the &quot;down-low&quot; subculture closely, while also exploring how &quot;down-low&quot; Black men face the issues of masculinity and sexuality.

In 2008, writer Terrance Dean published his memoir, &quot;Hiding in Hip-Hop: On the Down Low in the Entertainment Industry—from Music to Hollywood&quot;, where he discusses his own experience being down-low in the industry as well as others in the industry who are also down-low. He distinguishes the difference between being down-low and being down-low-gay. Someone who is down-low is on the receiving end of homosexual sexual pleasure and for that reason does not view themselves as gay, while down-low-gay is someone who is a closeted gay man.

Using a content analysis of more than 170 articles written between 2001 and 2006, sociologist Richard N. Pitt Jr. concluded that the media pathologized Black bisexual men&#x27;s behavior while either ignoring or sympathizing with White bisexual men&#x27;s similar actions. He argued that the &quot;down-low&quot; Black bisexual is often described negatively as a &quot;duplicitous heterosexual&quot; man whose behaviors threaten the Black community. Alternatively, the &quot;Brokeback&quot; White bisexual (when seen as bisexual at all) is often described in pitying language as a &quot;victimized homosexual&quot; man who is forced into the closet by the heterosexist society around him.

==HIV/AIDS epidemic==

Men who have sex with both men and women are a &quot;significant bridge for HIV to women&quot;, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study suggested. The CDC&#x27;s Young Men&#x27;s Survey shows that about one in 10 men reporting sex with men also have sex with women. And more than one in four of these bisexual men have unsafe sex with both kinds of partners. &quot;Men who also have sex with women have similar levels of HIV and STDs [as exclusively homosexual men] and higher levels of many risky behaviors.&quot;

A study by Glenn and Spieldenner uses the CDC as a source to report the following:
&quot;This issue continues to be stigmatized and connected to HIV/AIDS research, particularly how it connects to risky sexual practices influencing its transmission to partners, controversies regarding social awareness and acceptance of Black male sexuality, as well as disclosure or nondisclosure of those practices and behaviors.&quot;

The CDC report that analyzes the above-mentioned survey states that &quot;many men who have sex with men (MSM), especially young and minority MSM, do not disclose their sexual orientation&quot; in order to avoid &quot;social isolation, discrimination, or verbal or physical abuse.&quot; The report connects non-disclosure to an increased risk of HIV by stating: &quot;Young MSM who do not disclose their sexual orientation (nondisclosers) are thought to be at particularly high risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection because of low self-esteem, depression, or lack of peer support and prevention services that are available to MSM who are more open about their sexuality (disclosers).&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;HIV/STD Risks&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The CDC added a note to their report stating, in part:
&quot;The findings in this report are consistent with previous research suggesting that among MSM, nondisclosure of sexual orientation is associated with being a member of a racial/ethnic minority group, identifying as bisexual or heterosexual, having greater perceived community and internalized homophobia, and being less integrated socially within homosexual communities (1—3,6). Although this study did not find that nondisclosing MSM were at higher risk for HIV infection than MSM who are more open about their sexuality (1—3), the data suggests that a substantial proportion of nondisclosers are infected with HIV and other STDs and are at high risk for transmitting these infections to their male and female sex partners.

The finding that more than one in three nondisclosers reported having recent female sex partners suggests that nondisclosing MSM might have an important role in HIV/STD transmission to women. This might be particularly true for Black nondisclosing MSM, of whom approximately one in five was infected with HBV and one in seven was infected with HIV.&quot;
The CDC cited three findings that relate to African-American men who operate on the down-low (engage in MSM activity but don&#x27;t disclose to others):
* African American men who have sex with men (MSM), but who do not disclose their sexual orientation (nondisclosers), have a high prevalence of HIV infection (14%); nearly three times higher than nondisclosing MSMs of all other races/ethnicities combined (5%).
* Confirming previous research, the study of 5,589 MSM, aged 15–29 years, in six U.S. cities found that African American MSM were more likely not to disclose their sexual orientation compared with white MSM (18% vs. 8%).
* HIV-infected nondisclosers were less likely to know their HIV status (98% were unaware of their infection compared with 75% of HIV-positive disclosers), and more likely to have had recent female sex partners.

In &quot;Beyond the Down Low&quot;, Keith Boykin denied this connection, attributing the media claim to sexism, racism, homophobia and classism. Boykin stated that despite the numerous media accounts linking the down-low to the occurrence of AIDS in the African-American community, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has never cited men on the down-low as a factor. Boykin claimed that no extensive research has ever been published about men on the down-low, in part because of the difficulty of identifying the targeted population. In his book, &quot;Beyond The Down Low: Sex, Lies and Denial in Black America&quot;, he wrote that men on the &#x27;down-low&#x27; are not the cause of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Black America. Boykin argued that the down-low debate demonizes Black men, stigmatizes Black women, and encourages an unhealthy &quot;battle of the sexes&quot; that distracts the community&#x27;s attention from the issues of HIV prevention, personal responsibility and condom use.

The authors of a study of the down-low on Craigslist.org also argue that the discourse about the down-low is about pathologizing Black sexualities. These authors found that white men also claim to be on the down-low as much as Black men; however, society and the media still only attributes the down-low to Black people and their sexual behaviors. The authors maintain that by only focusing on Black people&#x27;s sexual behaviors, larger structural issues such as poverty and drug use are ignored in the discussion about rising HIV rates in certain Black communities.

A cross-study analysis that reviewed 24 articles (and published in the Journal of the National Medical Association) found that &quot;Black MSM are more likely than MSM of other racial or ethnic groups to be bisexually active or identified; and, compared with white MSM, are less likely to disclose their bisexual or homosexual activities to others.&quot; The authors concluded that:

&quot;The high prevalence of HIV in the Black community and the greater likelihood of bisexuality among Black men place heterosexual Black women at risk for HIV infection. However, the contribution of high-risk heterosexual Black men to the rising HIV caseload among Black women has been largely ignored. Future research must evaluate the relative contributions of bisexual men and exclusively heterosexual Black men to HIV cases among Black women.&quot;

Additionally, a qualitative study, published in the Medical Anthropological Quarterly, concluded that:

 &quot;... covert and unprotected sex among bisexually active Black men was commonplace for reasons that included prostitution, habituation to same-sex relations during incarceration, and the desire to maintain a facade of heterosexuality in homophobic communities. It was concluded that bisexual activity is highly correlated with secrecy and unprotected sex. The risks of bisexuality among Black men are exacerbated by incarceration, homophobia, drug use, and the prison and public health focus on surveillance rather than prevention.&quot;

== Black people in the glass closet ==

In &quot;Nobody Is Supposed to Know: Black Sexuality on the Down Low&quot; (2014), scholar C. Riley Snorton contends that Black sexuality operates within the glass closet, a space &quot;marked by hypervisibility and confinement, spectacle, and speculation.&quot; Down-low men have been subjected to demonization and criminalization by the media, health officials, as well as the general public, especially during the early to mid-2000s. This type of hypervisibility reinforces the confining space of the glass closet, and continues to position Black men as subjects of regulation and surveillance. Therefore, Black masculinity is perceived as &quot;dangerous, prone to trickery, promiscuous, and contaminated while also framing white masculinity and sexuality as less susceptible to such problems.&quot; The glass closet represents the immobility of Black people and sexuality. Down-low men are racialized, sexualized, gendered, and classed.

Snorton describes:

The (meta)physics of the glass closet are like the physical properties of glass, sometimes liquid and sometimes solid, located in the slippages of categorization. If we understand the closet as a racialized metaphor, then we must fully consider what it means when Black bodies enter the illuminating space of the closet. It resembles the phenomenon of peering into a lit window at night—the contents inside captured by the glass frame.

Despite the hypervisibility of the glass closet, there is still potential for the performative tactic which Snorton calls &quot;ignorance&quot;. This ignorance &quot;relies on the subversion of knowledge and a deft manipulation of spectacle.&quot; Thus, the glass closet can also function as a space of willful invisibility for down-low Black men.

<doc id="391934" wikidata="Q3273735" url="?curid=391934" title="Hackney carriage">
<text>A hackney or hackney carriage (also called a cab, black cab, hack or taxi) is a carriage or car for hire. A hackney of a more expensive or high class was called a remise. A symbol of London and Britain, the black taxi is a common sight on the streets of London. The hackney carriages carry a roof sign TAXI that can be illuminated to indicate their availability for passengers.

In the UK, the name &quot;hackney carriage&quot; today refers to a taxicab licensed by the Public Carriage Office, local authority (non-metropolitan district councils, unitary authorities) or the Department of the Environment depending on region of the country. Some hackney carriages have also been exported for use in other countries.

==Etymology==

The origins of the word hackney in connection with horses and carriages are uncertain. The origin is often attributed to the London borough of Hackney, whose name likely originated in Old English meaning &#x27;Haka&#x27;s Island&#x27;. There is some doubt whether the word &quot;hack&quot; for a horse was derived from this place-name, as the area was historically marshy and not well-suited for keeping horses. The American Hackney Horse Society favours an alternative etymology stemming from the French word &quot;haquenée&quot;—a horse of medium size recommended for lady riders—which was brought to England with the Norman Conquest and became fully assimilated into the English language by the start of the 14th century. The word became associated with an ambling horse, usually for hire.

The place-name, through its famous association with horses and horse-drawn carriages, is also the root of the Spanish word &quot;jaca&quot;, a term used for a small breed of horse and the Sardinian achetta horse. The first documented hackney coach—the name later extended to the newer and smaller carriages—operated in London in 1621.

The New York City colloquial terms &quot;hack&quot; (taxi or taxi-driver), hackstand (taxi stand), and hack license (taxi licence) are probably derived from hackney carriage. Such cabs are now regulated by the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission.

==History== 






The widespread use of private coaches by the English aristocracy began to be seen in the 1580s; within fifty years hackney coaches were regularly to be seen on the streets of London. In the 1620s there was a proliferation of coaches for hire in the metropolis, so much so that they were seen as a danger to pedestrians in the narrow streets of the city, and in 1635 an Order in Council was issued limiting the number allowed. Two years later a system for licensing hackney coachmen was established (overseen by the Master of the Horse).

&quot;An Ordinance for the Regulation of Hackney-Coachmen in London and the places adjacent&quot; was approved by Parliament in 1654, to remedy what it described as the &quot;many Inconveniences [that] do daily arise by reason of the late increase and great irregularity of Hackney Coaches and Hackney Coachmen in London, Westminster and the places thereabouts&quot;. The first hackney-carriage licences date from a 1662 act of Parliament, the London and Westminster Streets Act 1662 (14 Cha. 2. c. 2) establishing the Commissioners of Scotland Yard to regulate them. Licences applied literally to horse-drawn carriages, later modernised as hansom cabs (1834), that operated as vehicles for hire. The 1662 act limited the licences to 400; when it expired in 1679, extra licences were created until the (5 &amp; 6 Will. &amp; Mar. c. 22) imposed a limit of 700. The limit was increased to 800 in 1715, 1,000 in 1770 and 1,100 in 1802, before being abolished in 1832. The 1694 act established the Hackney Coach Commissioners to oversee the regulation of fares, licences and other matters; in 1831 their work was taken over by the Stamp Office and in 1869 responsibility for licensing was passed on to the Metropolitan Police. In the 18th and 19th centuries, private carriages were commonly sold off for use as hackney carriages, often displaying painted-over traces of the previous owner&#x27;s coat of arms on the doors.

There was a distinction between a general hackney carriage and a hackney coach, which was specifically a hireable vehicle with four wheels, two horses and six seats: four on the inside for the passengers and two on the outside (one for a servant and the other for the driver, who was popularly termed the &quot;Jarvey&quot; (also spelled &quot;jarvie&quot;)). For many years only coaches, to this specification, could be licensed for hire; but in 1814 the licensing of up to 200 hackney chariots was permitted, which carried a maximum of three passengers inside and one servant outside (such was the popularity of these new faster carriages that the number of licences was doubled the following year).

Shortly afterwards even lighter carriages began to be licensed: the two-wheel, single-horse cabriolets or &#x27;cabs&#x27;, which were licensed to carry no more than two passengers. Then, in 1834, the hansom cab was patented by Joseph Hansom: a jaunty single-horse, two-wheel carriage with a distinctive appearance, designed to carry passengers safely in an urban environment. The hansom cab quickly established itself as the standard two-wheel hackney carriage and remained in use into the 20th century.

In 1836 the Clarence was introduced to London&#x27;s streets: a type of small four-wheel enclosed carriage drawn by one or two horses. These became known as &#x27;growlers&#x27; because of the sound they made on the cobbled streets. Much slower than a hansom cab, they nevertheless had room for up to four passengers (plus one servant) and space on the roof for luggage. As such they remained in use as the standard form of four-wheeled hackney carriage until replaced by motorised taxi cabs in the early 20th century.

A small, usually two-wheeled, one-horse hackney vehicle called a &quot;noddy&quot; once plied the roads in Ireland and Scotland. The French had a small hackney coach called a &quot;fiacre&quot;.

===Motorisation===

Electric hackney carriages appeared before the introduction of the internal combustion engine to vehicles for hire in 1897. In fact there was even London Electrical Cab Company: the cabs were informally called Berseys after the manager who designed them, Walter Bersey. Another nickname was Hummingbirds from the sound that they made. In August 1897, 25 were introduced, and by 1898, there were 50 more. During the early 20th century, cars generally replaced horse-drawn models. In 1910, the number of motor cabs on London streets outnumbered horse-drawn growlers and hansoms for the first time. At the time of the outbreak of World War I, the ratio was seven to one in favour of motorized cabs. The last horse-drawn hackney carriage ceased service in London in 1947.

UK regulations define a hackney carriage as a taxicab allowed to ply the streets looking for passengers to pick up, as opposed to private hire vehicles (sometimes called &quot;minicabs&quot;), which may pick up only passengers who have previously booked or who visit the taxi operator&#x27;s office. In 1999, the first of a series of fuel cell powered taxis were tried out in London. The &quot;Millennium Cab&quot; built by ZeTek gained television coverage and great interest when driven in the Sheraton Hotel ballroom in New York by Judd Hirsch, the star of the television series &quot;Taxi&quot;. ZeTek built three cabs but ceased activities in 2001.

===Continuing horse-drawn cab services===

Horse-drawn hackney services continue to operate in parts of the UK, for example in Cockington, Torquay. The town of Windsor, Berkshire, is the last remaining UK town with a continuous lineage of horse-drawn hackney carriages, operated run by Windsor Carriages, the licence having been passed down from driver to driver since the 1830&#x27;s. The original hackney licence is in place, allowing for passenger travel under the same law that was originally passed in 1662. The city of Bath has an occasional horse-drawn Hackney, principally for tourists, but still carrying hackney plates.

==Black cabs==

Though there has never been law requiring London&#x27;s taxis to be black, they were, since the end of the Second World War, sold in a standard colour of black. This, in the 1970s gave rise within the minicab trade to the nickname &#x27;black cab&#x27; and it has become common currency. However, before the Second World War, London&#x27;s cabs were seen in a variety of colours. They are produced in a variety of colours, sometimes in advertising brand liveries (see below). Fifty golden cabs were produced for the Queen&#x27;s Golden Jubilee celebrations in 2002.

===Vehicle design===

In Edwardian times, Renault and Unic, but also smaller players like Charron and Darracq were to be found. Fiat was also a presence, with their importer d&#x27;Arcy Baker running a fleet of 400 cars of the brand. In the 1920s, Beardmore cabs were introduced and became for a while the most popular. They were nicknamed &#x27;the Rolls-Royce of cabs&#x27; for their comfort and robustness. Maxwell Monson introduced Citroën cabs, which were cheaper, but crude in comparison to the Beardmore. In 1930 dealers Mann and Overton struck a deal with the Austin to bring a modified version of the Austin 12/4 car to the London taxi market. This established Austin as dominant until the end of the 1970s and Mann and Overton until 2012. The Austin FX4, launched in 1958, which stayed in production until 1997 under successive manufacturers is perhaps the most iconic and recognised of all hackney carriages and set the basic styling parameters of its successors.

Morrises cabs were also seen, in small numbers, but after the Second World War, produced the Oxford, made by Wolseleys.
Outside of London, the regulations governing the hackney cab trade are different. Four-door saloon cars have been highly popular as hackney carriages, but with disability regulations growing in strength and some councils offering free licensing for disabled-friendly vehicles, many operators are now opting for wheelchair-adapted taxis such as the LEVC TX of London Electric Vehicle Company (LEVC). London taxis have broad rear doors that open very wide (or slide), and an electrically controlled ramp that is extended for access. 

Other models of specialist taxis include the Peugeot E7 and rivals from Fiat, Ford, Volkswagen, and Mercedes-Benz. These vehicles normally allow six or seven passengers, although some models can accommodate eight. Some of these minibus taxis include a front passenger seat next to the driver, while others reserve this space solely for luggage.
London taxis must have a turning circle not greater than . One reason for this is the configuration of the famed Savoy Hotel: the hotel entrance&#x27;s small roundabout meant that vehicles needed the small turning circle to navigate it. That requirement became the legally required turning circles for all London cabs, while the custom of a passenger&#x27;s sitting on the right, behind the driver, provided a reason for the right-hand traffic in Savoy Court, allowing hotel patrons to board and alight from the driver&#x27;s side.
The design standards for London taxis are set out in the &quot;Conditions of Fitness&quot;, which are now published by Transport for London. The first edition was published in May 1906, by the Public Carriage Office, which was then part of the Metropolitan Police. These regulations set out the conditions under which a taxi may operate and have been updated over the years to keep pace with motor car development and legislation. Changes include regulating the taximeter (made compulsory in 1907), advertisements and the turning circle of . Until the beginning of the 1980s, London Taxis were not allowed to carry any advertisements. 

The London Taxis fleet has been fully accessible since 1 January 2000, following the introduction of the first accessible taxi in 1987. On 14 December 2010, Mayor of London Boris Johnson released an air quality strategy paper encouraging phasing out of the oldest of the LT cabs, and proposing a £1m fund to encourage taxi owners to upgrade to low-emission vehicles. Since 2018, all newly registered taxis in London must be zero emission, and more than half of the 14,700 fleet is zero emission capable.

As part of the Transported by Design programme of activities, on 15 October 2015, after two months of public voting, the black cab was elected by Londoners as their favourite transport design icon.

In 2017, the LEVC TX was introduced – a purpose built hackney carriage, built as a plug-in hybrid range-extender electric vehicle. By April 2022, over 5,000 TX&#x27;s had been sold in London, around a third of London&#x27;s taxi fleet. In October 2019 the first fully electric cab since the Bersey in 1897, the Dynamo Taxi, was launched with a 187-mile range and with the bodywork based on Nissan&#x27;s NV200 platform.

===Driver qualification===
In London, hackney-carriage drivers have to pass a test called The Knowledge to demonstrate that they have an intimate knowledge of the geography of London streets, important buildings, etc. Learning The Knowledge allows the driver to become a member of the Worshipful Company of Hackney Carriage Drivers. There are two types of badge, a yellow one for the suburban areas and a green one for all of London. The latter is considered far more difficult. Drivers who own their cabs as opposed to renting from a garage are known as &quot;mushers&quot; and those who have just passed the &quot;knowledge&quot; are known as &quot;butter boys&quot;. There are currently around 21,000 black cabs in London, licensed by the Public Carriage Office.

Elsewhere, councils have their own regulations. Some merely require a driver to pass a DBS disclosure and have a reasonably clean driving licence, while others use their own local versions of London&#x27;s The Knowledge test.

===Notable drivers===
*Alfred Collins, who retired in 2007 at the age of 92, was the oldest cab driver and had been driving for 70 years. 
*Fred Housego is a former London taxi driver who became a television and radio personality and presenter after winning the BBC television quiz &quot;Mastermind&quot; in 1980. 
*Clive Efford, Labour MP for the London constituency of Eltham, was a cab driver for 10 years before entering parliament in 1997.

===Private users===
Oil millionaire Nubar Gulbenkian owned an Austin FX3 Brougham Sedanca taxi, with custom coachwork by FLM Panelcraft Ltd as he was quoted &quot;because it turns on a sixpence whatever that is.&quot; Gulbenkian had two such taxis built, the second of which was built on an FX4 chassis and was sold at auction by Bonhams for $39,600 in 2015. Other celebrities are known to have used hackney carriages both for their anonymity and their ruggedness and manoeuvrability in London traffic. Users included Prince Philip, whose cab was converted to run on liquefied petroleum gas, author and actor Stephen Fry, and the Sheriffs of the City of London. A black cab was used in the band Oasis&#x27;s video for the song &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back in Anger.&quot; Black cabs were used as recording studios for indie band performances and other performances in the Black Cab Sessions internet project.

&quot;Ghosthunting With...&quot; featured a black cab owned by host of the show, Yvette Fielding. Bez of the Happy Mondays owns one, shown on the UK edition of &quot;Pimp My Ride&quot;. Noel Edmonds used a black cab to commute from his home to the &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot; studios in Bristol. He placed a dressed mannequin in the back so that he could use special bus/taxi lanes, and so that people would not attempt to hail his cab.

The official car of the Governor of the Falkland Islands between 1976 and 2010 was a London taxi.

===In other countries===
Between 2003 and 1 August 2009 the London taxi model TXII could be purchased in the United States. Today there are approximately 250 TXIIs in the US, operating as taxis in San Francisco, Dallas, Long Beach, Houston, New Orleans, Las Vegas, Newport, Rhode Island, Wilmington, North Carolina and Portland, Oregon. There are also a few operating in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. The largest London taxi rental fleet in North America is in Wilmington, owned by The British Taxi Company. There are London cabs in Saudi Arabia, Romania, South Africa, Lebanon, Egypt, Bahrain and Cyprus, and in Israel, where a Chinese-made version of LTI&#x27;s model TX4 built by Geely Automobile is available. In February 2010, a number of TX4s started operating in Pristina, Kosovo, and are known as London Taxi.

In the United States, the police department of the city of Boston has a Hackney Carriage Unit, analogous to taxicab regulators in other cities, that issues &quot;Hackney Carriage&quot; medallions to its taxi operators.
Singapore has used London-style cabs since 1992; starting with the &quot;Fairway&quot;. The flag-down fares for the London Taxis are the same as for other taxis. SMRT Corporation, the sole operator, had by March 2013 replaced its fleet of 15 ageing multi-coloured (gold, pink, etc.) taxis with new white ones. They are the only wheelchair-accessible taxis in Singapore, and were brought back following an outcry after the removal of the service.

By 2011 a thousand of a Chinese-made version of LTI&#x27;s latest model, TX4, had been ordered by Baku Taxi Company. The plan is part of a program originally announced by Azerbaijan&#x27;s Ministry of Transportation to introduce London cabs to the capital, Baku. The move was part of a £16 million agreement between the London Taxi Company and Baku Taxi Company.
Although the LEVC TX is more expensive and exceeds the Japanese size classifications to gain the tax advantages Japanese livery drivers enjoy with the similarly designed but smaller Toyota JPN Taxi, Geely has attempted to break into the Japanese market. Alternatively, while the Toyota JPN Taxi doesn&#x27;t meet the passenger capacity or turning radius Conditions of Fitness required by Transport for London, it does meet the emissions and accessibility requirements that may make it an ideal option for cities outside of London without the seating requirements or as a private hire vehicle while still evoking the familiar black cab profile.
During the 2008 Olympic Games, there were about 100 Hackney carriages were operating in Beijing.

===Use in advertising===
In October 2011 the company Eyetease Ltd. introduced digital screens on the roofs of London taxis for dynamically changing location-specific advertising.

==Digital hailing==
2011 saw the launch of many digital hailing applications for hackney carriages that operate through smartphones, including GetTaxi and Hailo. Many of these applications also facilitate payment and tracking of the taxicabs.

== United Kingdom law ==
Laws about the definition, licensing and operation of hackney carriages have a long history. The most significant pieces of legislation by region are:

* In England and Wales: the Town Police Clauses Act 1847, and the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1976. In Wales, responsibility for licensing is now devolved to the Senedd. In September 2017, a consultation started about the future of such licensing.
* In London: the Metropolitan Public Carriage Act 1869 and the London Cab Order 1934.
* In Scotland: the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982.
* In Northern Ireland: the Taxis Act (Northern Ireland) 2008

<text>Tiergarten (, literally &quot;Animal Garden&quot;, historically meaning &quot;deer park&quot; or hunting &quot;game park&quot;) is a locality within the borough of Mitte, in central Berlin (Germany). Notable for the great and homonymous urban park, before German reunification, it was a part of West Berlin. Until Berlin&#x27;s 2001 administrative reform, Tiergarten was also the name of a borough (Bezirk), consisting of the current locality (&quot;Ortsteil&quot;) of Tiergarten (formerly called &quot;Tiergarten-Süd&quot;) plus Hansaviertel and Moabit. A new system of road and rail tunnels runs under the park towards Berlin&#x27;s main station in nearby Moabit.

==History==

===Historical notes===

Once a hunting ground of the Electors of Brandenburg the &quot;Großer Tiergarten&quot; park of today was designed in the 1830s by landscape architect Peter Joseph Lenné. In the course of industrialization in the 19th century, a network of streets was laid out in the Hobrecht-Plan in an area that came to be known architecturally as the Wilhelmine Ring. In 1894 the Reichstag building by architect Paul Wallot opened as the seat of the German parliament. The lawn between the contemporary &quot;Haus der Kulturen der Welt&quot; (House of World Cultures) and the Reichstag building was the site of the Krolloper opera house, built in 1844, which served as parliament house after the Reichstag fire on 27 February 1933 and was demolished by air raids in 1943.

On 15 January 1919 the socialist Karl Liebknecht was shot by Freikorps soldiers within the park near the lake &quot;Neuer See&quot;. The corpse of Rosa Luxemburg, murdered on the same day, was found in the nearby Landwehrkanal on 1 June 1919.

The first &quot;Institut für Sexualwissenschaft&quot; (Institute for Sex Research) of Magnus Hirschfeld was situated at the former &quot;In den Zelten&quot; street, near the contemporary &quot;Haus der Kulturen der Welt&quot;, from 1919 until it was closed by the Nazis in 1933.

A site next to the Tiergarten park is the former location of a villa at Tiergartenstrasse 4 where more than 60 Nazi bureaucrats and doctors worked in secret under the &quot;T4&quot; program to organize the mass murder of sanatorium and psychiatric hospital patients deemed unworthy to live. The German national memorial to the people with disabilities systematically murdered by the Nazis was dedicated in 2014 in Berlin at that site. Although the villa was destroyed, a set in the pavement on Tiergartenstraße marks its location and historic significance.

After 1944, the park was largely deforested because it served as a source of firewood for the devastated city. In 1945, the Soviet Union built a war memorial along the Straße des 17. Juni, the Tiergarten&#x27;s main east–west artery, near the Brandenburg Gate. The Tiergarten itself became part of the British sector.

===Tiergarten today===

The locality houses many parliamentary and governmental institutions, among others the Bundestag in the Reichstag building and the new German Chancellery. The residence of the German President, Schloss Bellevue and the Carillon are also located in the Tiergarten park. It contains several notable sculptures including the four-tiered Victory Column (&quot;Siegessäule&quot;), the Bismarck Memorial and several other memorials to prominent Prussian generals, all of which were located in the ceremonial park facing the Reichstag before they were moved to their present location by the Nazis. In addition, the tree-lined pedestrian avenues emanating from the Victory Column contain several ceremonial sculptures of Prussian aristocrats enacting an 18th-century hunt.

The Brandenburg Gate and the Potsdamer Platz are situated on the eastern rim of the locality, which itself was the former frontier between East and West Berlin. Nearby is the &quot;Kulturforum&quot; stretching from the , a 1963 concert hall by architect Hans Scharoun and home of the Berlin Philharmonic orchestra to the Neue Nationalgalerie built by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe in 1968. In between are the neoclassical Saint Matthew Church, built in 1845 by Friedrich August Stüler, the as well as the new branch of the Berlin State Library (&quot;Staatsbibliothek&quot;).

The adjacent area between the park and the Landwehrkanal is home to Emil Fahrenkamp&#x27;s 1932 Shell-Haus, numerous embassies and the Bendlerblock, where in 1944 Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg and the conspirators of the 20 July plot were shot by a firing squad. Today the building serves as second office of Germany&#x27;s Federal Ministry of Defense; the headquarters of the Christian Democratic Party, the Konrad Adenauer Foundation and Friedrich Ebert Foundation academies as well as the Bauhaus Archive and the high schools Französisches Gymnasium and Canisius-Kolleg are located nearby. The adjacent western area at the border to Charlottenburg houses the Berlin Zoo.

The 1985 album &quot;Le Parc&quot; by Tangerine Dream contains a track titled &quot;Tiergarten&quot;. Rufus Wainwright also released a track titled Tiergarten as part of his 2007 album, Release the Stars. 

Since 1987, the annual Berlin Marathon starts at Tiergarten near the Brandenburg Gate.

Between 1996 and 2003 and then in 2006, the Love Parade music festival took place at the Victory Column and Straße des 17. Juni. On 2 July 2005, the Live 8 concert, Berlin took place at the Victory Column.

On 24 July 2008, then-US presidential candidate Barack Obama spoke at the Victory Column in front of a crowd of over 200,000 people.

For a more complete list, which adds these &quot;hidden&quot; baronies as well as extinct, dormant, abeyant, and forfeit ones, see List of Baronies.

This page includes all life barons, including the Law Lords created under the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876. However hereditary peers with the rank of viscount or higher holding also a life peerage are not included.

==Order of precedence==

The general order of precedence among barons is:
# Barons of England
# Lords of Parliament of Scotland
# Barons of Great Britain
# Barons of Ireland
# Barons of the United Kingdom
However barons of Ireland created after the Union of 1801 yield precedence to earlier created barons of the United Kingdom. They are listed in italics, in their place in the order of precedence. Life peers take precedence with other barons of the United Kingdom; they are listed separately because the only hereditary baronies created since 1965 have been subsidiary titles: Prince Andrew, Duke of York, who holds the subsidiary title of Baron Killyleagh, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, who holds the subsidiary title of Baron Carrickfergus, and Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, who holds the subsidiary title of Baron Kilkeel.

==Barons of England==

==Lords of Parliament of Scotland==

==Barons of Great Britain==

===Hereditary barons===
:&quot;Irish baronies created after 1801 yield precedence to older baronies of the United Kingdom.&quot;
===Life barons===
&quot;All baronies created since 1965 have either been life peerages or subsidiary baronies for peerages of higher rank, which do not appear in this list.&quot;

They were a relatively late introduction to the British peerage, and on the evening of the Coronation of Queen Victoria in 1838, the Prime Minister Lord Melbourne explained to her why (from her journals): 
&quot;I spoke to Ld M. about the numbers of Peers present at the Coronation, &amp; he said it was quite unprecedented. I observed that there were very few Viscounts, to which he replied &quot;There are very few Viscounts,&quot; that they were an odd sort of title &amp; not really English; that they came from Vice-Comites; that Dukes &amp; Barons were the only real English titles; — that Marquises were likewise not English, &amp; that people were mere made Marquises, when it was not wished that they should be made Dukes&quot;.

<doc id="391945" wikidata="Q4504702" url="?curid=391945" title="List of dukes in the peerages of Britain and Ireland">
<text>This is a list of the 30 present dukes in the peerages of the Kingdom of England, Kingdom of Scotland, Kingdom of Great Britain, Kingdom of Ireland, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland 1927 and after. For a more complete historical listing, including extinct, dormant, abeyant, forfeit dukedoms in addition to these extant ones, see List of dukedoms in the peerages of Britain and Ireland.
==History==

In the Peerage of England, the title of duke was created 74 times (using 40 different titles: the rest were recreations). Three times a woman was created a duchess in her own right; Barbara Palmer, 1st Duchess of Cleveland, chief mistress of Charles II of England, Anne Scott, 1st Duchess of Buccleuch, wife of Charles II&#x27;s eldest illegitimate son, the Duke of Monmouth, and Cecilia Underwood, Duchess of Inverness, wife of Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex, whose marriage was in contravention of the Royal Marriages Act 1772 and therefore she was not allowed to share her husband&#x27;s rank. In addition, the Dukedom of Marlborough was once inherited by a woman, the 2nd Duchess of Marlborough, through a special remainder, as happened to the Dukedom of Hamilton when it was inherited by Anne Hamilton, 3rd Duchess of Hamilton and also the royal Dukedom of Fife, which was created for the Earl Fife by Queen Victoria, on the occasion of his marriage to Louise, Princess Royal, eldest daughter of the future King Edward VII. A second dukedom of Fife was created in 1900 that could pass through the female line, which was eventually inherited by Princess Alexandra, 2nd Duchess of Fife. Out of the 74 times, 37 titles are now extinct (including the two women&#x27;s), 16 titles were forfeit or surrendered, 10 were merged with the Crown, and 11 are extant (see list below). The first, Cornwall, is a title that automatically goes to the heir apparent (if and only if he is also the eldest living son of the Sovereign). One of the duchies that was merged into the Crown, Lancaster, still provides income to the sovereign. All but three of the non-royal ducal titles which became extinct did so before the 20th century (the Duke of Leeds became extinct in 1964, the Duke of Newcastle in 1988, and the Duke of Portland in 1990). The last English dukedom to be forfeit became so in 1715. The last British dukedom to become extinct was the title of Duke of Portland in 1990.

The oldest six titles – created between 1337 and 1386 – were Duke of Cornwall (1337), Duke of Lancaster (1351), Duke of Clarence (1362), Duke of York (1385), Duke of Gloucester (1385), and Duke of Ireland (1386). The &quot;Duke of Ireland&quot; was a title used for only two years and is somewhat confusing since only a small portion of Ireland was really under the control of England in 1386; it is not to be confused with the dukedoms of the Peerage of Ireland. Clarence has not been used since 1478, when George (the brother of Edward IV) was executed for treason. (However Clarence has since been used as half of a double title, most recently until 1892 when Victoria&#x27;s grandson (and son of the Prince of Wales), the Duke of Clarence and Avondale, died at the age of 28). The titles of Duke of York and the Duke of Gloucester have both become extinct more than once and been re-created as titles within the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Both titles are reserved for princes (and their descendants). The Duke of Lancaster has merged with the Crown and so is held by the monarch.
Besides the dukedoms of Cornwall and Lancaster, the oldest extant title is that of Duke of Norfolk, dating from 1483 (the title was first created in 1397). The Duke of Norfolk is considered the premier duke of England. The premier duke of Scotland is the Duke of Hamilton and Brandon. The premier duke of Ireland is the Duke of Leinster.

==Order of precedence==

The general order of precedence among dukes is:
#Dukes in the Peerage of England, in order of creation
#Dukes in the Peerage of Scotland, in order of creation
#Dukes in the Peerage of Great Britain, in order of creation
#Dukes in the Peerage of Ireland created before 1801, in order of creation
#Dukes in the Peerage of the United Kingdom and dukes in the Peerage of Ireland created after 1801, in order of creation

Whilst the general order of precedence is set according to the age of the peerage, the sovereign&#x27;s Grace may accord any peer higher precedence than his date of creation would warrant. The royal dukes are dukes of the United Kingdom, but rank higher in the order of precedence than the age of their titles warrants, due to their close relationship to the monarch. The Duke of Cornwall holds precedence above all dukes, royal and non-royal, and is the Duke of Rothesay, and of Cambridge.

The purpose of the theory is to provide quantitative measures of the number of times a function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) assumes a value &quot;a&quot;, as &quot;z&quot; grows in size, refining the Picard theorem on behaviour close to an essential singularity. The theory exists for analytic functions (and meromorphic functions) of one complex variable &quot;z&quot;, or of several complex variables.

In the case of one variable, the term Nevanlinna theory, after Rolf Nevanlinna, is also common. The now-classical theory received renewed interest when Paul Vojta suggested some analogies to the problem of integral solutions to Diophantine equations. These turned out to involve some close parallels and to lead to fresh points of view on the Mordell conjecture and related questions.</text><links>

<text>John Sewell (born December 8, 1940) is a Canadian politician and lawyer who served as the 58th mayor of Toronto from 1978 to 1980.

==Background==
Born and raised in the Beach neighbourhood, in Toronto, Sewell attended Malvern Collegiate Institute and the University of Toronto, graduating with an English Literature degree in 1961. He earned a law degree from the University of Toronto Law School in 1964 and was called to the bar in 1966.

==Early political career==
Sewell became active in city politics in 1966 when he joined the residents of the Trefann Court Urban Renewal Area in the fight against the expropriation and levelling of the working-class and poor neighbourhood. Sewell was also involved in opposing the building of the Spadina Expressway in the late 1960s and early 1970s. He was first elected to Toronto City Council in 1969 as alderman for Ward 7, a predominantly working-class area including St. Jamestown, Regent Park, Don Vale, and Cabbagetown. He also initiated the founding of a community-owned newspaper, &quot;Seven News&quot;, seen as an alternative to Toronto&#x27;s corporate-owned daily papers.

Sewell became the leader of city council&#x27;s reform wing, and was elected Mayor of Toronto in 1978.

==Mayor of Toronto==

=== Election ===
In the 1978 election, the right-wing vote was split between two mayoral candidates, David Paul Smith and Tony O&#x27;Donohue. Sewell won the election with less than 50 percent of the vote: Sewell won 71,305 votes, to O&#x27;Donohue&#x27;s 62,173 and Smith&#x27;s 45,071.

=== Tenure ===
Sewell was portrayed as a radical in the media, and was dubbed &quot;Mayor Blue Jeans&quot; by the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; because denim, which Sewell wore to city council meetings as an alderman, was still considered an identifier of the counterculture. As an environmentalist famous for riding his bicycle to council, he opposed the development of banking and convention centres in the central business district that would become the hallmark of the mayors who followed. Sewell also established himself as a leading critic of the Toronto Police by demanding greater accountability to the public. He was a leading defender of gay rights and endorsed the activist George Hislop&#x27;s 1980 candidacy for city council while it was rare for public figures to express support for gay rights.

In the 1980 election, after two years of controversy, pro-development Conservatives and Liberals encouraged and united behind the candidacy of Art Eggleton who was presented as the establishment candidate. Although Sewell maintained the support of many Red Tories, reform Liberals, and New Democrats and won more votes and a larger share of the vote than in 1978, he lost the mayor&#x27;s office to Eggleton.

==Later life==
Sewell subsequently returned to city council as an alderman in a by-election, to replace Ward 6 alderman Dan Heap who had been elected to parliament, and won re-election in 1982. He retired from municipal politics in 1984 to accept a job as a columnist at &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;. He subsequently moved to &quot;Now Magazine&quot; and then wrote a regular column in Toronto&#x27;s &quot;eye weekly&quot; from 1999 to 2005. He has written a number of books and articles on Toronto urban issues.

Sewell served as chair of the Toronto public housing authority from 1986 to 1988 and is an acknowledged urban affairs expert. He has served as chair of the Royal Commission on Planning and Development Reform in Ontario from 1991 to 1993. Sewell was an advisor to the city council of East London, South Africa from 1994 to 1999 and as advisor on the re-establishment of local government in Malawi in 2000. Sewell also taught law, politics, and social science at York University from 1989 to 1991.

In the late 1990s, Sewell founded the group Citizens for Local Democracy to fight the plans of the provincial Mike Harris government to abolish Metropolitan Toronto and amalgamate its constituent parts into a new City of Toronto &quot;megacity.&quot;

In the 1999 Ontario provincial election, Sewell ran as an independent candidate in the riding of Toronto Centre—Rosedale, challenging Progressive Conservative cabinet minister Al Leach to protest the megacity. His entry into the race was controversial, with many activists accusing him of splitting the left-wing vote with the New Democratic Party (NDP). Sewell was also criticized for remaining in the race after Leach, whom he had personally targeted as the minister responsible for amalgamation, had withdrawn from the contest. The riding was ultimately won by the Liberal George Smitherman. Sewell finished third, behind the Conservative Durhane Wong-Rieger.

In 2005, Sewell was made a member of the Order of Canada.

On June 26, 2006, Sewell announced that he would seek election in Ward 21 and run against Joe Mihevc in Toronto&#x27;s 2006 municipal election. Sewell said that he was motivated to run because of the construction of a streetcar right-of-way along St. Clair Avenue, which was supported by Mihevc. He also stated that he was disappointed at the record of Mayor David Miller. Sewell said, &quot;Living in a megacity demands more citizen participation and community consultation, not less.&quot; His candidacy received much publicity in the local media, but he was defeated by Mihevc, who received 8096 votes, compared to Sewell&#x27;s 3326.

Sewell, a former resident of Riverdale, resides in Ward 21 and has his law office on Beverley Street. He is active in the Toronto Police Accountability Coalition. In November 2008, Sewell was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. He received chemotherapy, and as of November 2009, the cancer is in remission.

<doc id="391958" wikidata="Q2280396" url="?curid=391958" title="Shut the box">
<text>Shut the box (also called ACKPOT, batten down the hatches or trick-track) is a game of dice for one or more players, commonly played in a group of two to four for stakes. Traditionally, a counting box is used with tiles numbered 1 to 9 where each can be covered with a hinged or sliding mechanism, though the game can be played with only a pair of dice, pen, and paper. Variations exist where the box has 10 or 12 tiles.

== History ==

Unconfirmed histories of the game suggest a variety of origins, including 12th century Normandy (northern France) as well as the mid 20th century Channel Islands (Jersey and Guernsey), which one source credits to a man known as &#x27;Chalky&#x27; Towbridge. A 1967 edition of &quot;Brewing Review&quot; describes the game as being native to the Channel Islands, and records it being played in Manchester pubs in the mid-1960s.

Taylor in &quot;Pub Games&quot; from 1976 mentions a claim that the game dates back to at least Napoleonic times. He reports a revival in the United Kingdom in &quot;the last fifteen years or so&quot;, that is from the 1960s. Canada Dry distributed them to many pubs as a publicity novelty &quot;some years&quot; prior to 1976.

Shut the box is the basis of the American television quiz show &quot;High Rollers&quot;, which ran from 1974 to 1976 and 1978 to 1980 on NBC with Alex Trebek as the host. The show resurfaced from 1987 to 1988, this time hosted by Wink Martindale.

Versions of the game have also been played in Barotseland (Zambia, central Africa).

== Rules ==

At the start of the game all levers or tiles are &quot;open&quot; (cleared, up), showing the numerals 1 to 9.

During the game, each player plays in turn. A player begins their turn by throwing or rolling the die or dice into the box. If the player does not have 7, 8, or 9 still available, they may choose to either roll one die or the standard two. Otherwise, the player must roll both dice.
After throwing, the player adds up (or subtracts) the pips (dots) on the dice and then &quot;shuts&quot; (closes, covers) one of any combination of open numbers that sums to the total number of dots showing on the dice. For example, if the total number of dots is 8, the player may choose any of the following sets of numbers (as long as all of the numbers in the set are available to be covered): 
* 8
* 7, 1
* 6, 2
* 5, 3
* 5, 2, 1
* 4, 3, 1

The player then rolls the dice again, aiming to shut more numbers. The player continues throwing the dice and shutting numbers until reaching a point at which, given the results produced by the dice, the player cannot shut any more numbers. At that point, the player scores the sum of the numbers that are still uncovered. For example, if the numbers 2, 3, and 5 are still open when the player throws a one, the player&#x27;s score is 10 (2 + 3 + 5 = 10). Play then passes to the next player.

After every player has taken a turn, the player with the lowest score wins.

If a player succeeds in closing all of the numbers, that player is said to have &quot;Shut the Box&quot;the player wins immediately and the game is over.

== Traditional pub play==

In English pubs, &quot;shut the box&quot; is traditionally played as a gambling game. Each player deposits an agreed amount of money into a pool at the beginning of the game, and the winner of the game collects the money in pool at the end of the game and in some cases the box as well.

== Variants ==
&quot;Shut the box&quot; is a traditional game, and there are many local and traditional variations in the rules. In addition, due to the game&#x27;s growing popularity, many variations of the game have developed in recent years.

Popular variants are:
* Golf – A player&#x27;s score is the sum of the numbers remaining uncovered at the end of their turn. The player with the lowest score wins.
* Missionary – A player&#x27;s score is how many of the tiles remain uncovered at the end of the player&#x27;s turn. For example, a player scores 3 if, at the end of their turn, 3 tiles remain open. The player with the lowest score wins.
* Canoga – A gambling variant produced by the Pacific Game Company; the company also produced a 12-tile variant, Canoga XII. (Canoga can also be played using a regular game set using chips.)
*# Chips are divided evenly among all players.
*# Players decide on an ante to place in the kitty (a half-round pocket on the playing field).
*# Players roll to see who goes first; play then rotates clockwise.
*# Players play a traditional round, scoring as described in &quot;Golf&quot; above, resulting in a winner and loser(s).
*# Each loser pays their difference in score to the winner. For example, if the lowest (winning) score is 11, and a losing score is 15, the loser pays 4 to the winner. The winner is paid by each loser.
*# Bonus payout: if the winner &quot;clears the board&quot; (scores 0 or &quot;shuts the box&quot;), the payout is as above but doubled, and the winner takes the kitty.
*# If there are tied winners, total payout is either split between or among the winners or multiplied for each winner, depending on how the players agree to do this before starting the game.

The following are examples of known variations in play, setup, and scoring:

* 2 to go – Standard game, the numbers 1 to 9 start up. On the first roll, the number 2 must be one of the ones dropped. Any player who rolls a 4 on their first roll loses immediately.
* 3 to go – The same as &quot;2 to go&quot; but the number 3 must be dropped instead.
* 3 down extreme – Numbers 1–3 are pre-dropped, leaving numbers 4–9 up.
* Lucky number 7 – The only number up is 7, and the first person to roll a 7 wins.
* Unlucky number 7 – A standard game, when a 7 is rolled, the game stops.
* Against all odds – All odd numbers are up and evens down.
* Even Stevens – All even numbers are up and odds down.
* Full house – 12 numbers are up.
* The 300 – 2 boxes and 4 dice are used, with the second box representing numbers 13–24 (24 + 23 + 22 + ... + 2 + 1 = 300); in the absence of a second box, cards or dominoes can be used to represent tiles 13–24. A Double 12 Dominoes set can also be used with four dice for this variant and other domino sets can be used by themselves to, in the case of the Double 18 set, provide for the use of six dice by themselves without the counting box. 
* Thai style (Jackpot) – Always roll two dice, but only cover one tile matching one of the dice or their sum. For example, if the dice show a 2 and a 3 you may cover one of 2, 3, or 5. The best strategy is to use the combined score for a high tile (7,8,9), if possible, otherwise choose the lowest tile. The success rate for this strategy is 7.9855%.
* Digital – A player&#x27;s score at the end of the turn is the number obtained by reading the up digits as a decimal number from left to right. For example, if 1, 2, and 5 are left up the score is 125. This is also known as &quot;Say what you see&quot;, a reference to Roy Walker&#x27;s catch phrase from the TV game show &quot;Catchphrase&quot;.
* 2012 – All 12 are up, but use a 20-sided die rather than the pair of 6 dice: 20-sided die playing 12 numbers.
It is also possible to play extended versions in which each game is a &quot;round&quot; of a longer game. Examples of such versions include:
* Tournament – Rounds are played with the Golf scoring method until a player reaches or exceeds a grand total of 100 points, at which time the player with the lowest point total is declared to be the winner. At the end of each round, each player&#x27;s score for the round is added to the player&#x27;s total score. When a player&#x27;s score reaches 45, the player must drop out of the game. The last player remaining wins the game.
* Simplified variant for younger players – Needs at least a 2 player box. During the game, each player plays in turn. After rolling both dice, the player adds up the dots on the dice and then shuts the tile for either the total number of dots, or one or both of the numbers on the dice. For example, if the player rolled a 6 and a 2, they may close either the 8 tile, or both the 6 tile and the 2 tile, or just the 6 tile, or just the 2 tile (as long as the numbers are available to be covered). The player then rolls the dice again, aiming to shut more numbers. The player continues throwing the dice and shutting numbers. The first player to shut all the tiles wins.

Dominoes can also be used for the tilesthis also provides the option of using up to six dice if a Double 18 domino set is used. A deck of cards can also be used as tiles, and if so desired a complete conventional Western deck with the jokers (54 cards) can provide for the use of up to nine dice.

===Played without dice===

* Domino Non-Dice Variants – A non-dice variant of the game can be played with the dominoes from either Western or Chinese sets ranging from 1 and 1 to 6 and 6 pips being used and most effectively put into a small bag for drawing, and the double blank being included along with blank and 1, with the former being either a free turn of sorts as it adds to zero or ending the turn, and the latter effectively ending the turn if the 1 tile has already been used.
* Card Non-Dice Variants – Another variant using cards dealt from one or more decks using the A, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (sometimes along with the 7, 8, 9, and 10), and two face cards agreed upon for the equivalent of dice rolls adding up to 11 and 12 pips

<doc id="391959" wikidata="Q248018" url="?curid=391959" title="Isaccea">
<text>Isaccea () is a small town in Tulcea County, in Northern Dobruja, Romania, on the right bank of the Danube, 35 km north-west of Tulcea. According to the 2021 census, it has a population of 4,408.

The town has been inhabited for thousands of years, as it is one of the few places in all the Lower Danube that can be easily forded and thus be an easy link between the Balkans and the steppes of Southern Ukraine and Russia, north of the Black Sea. The Danube was for a long time the border between the Romans, later Byzantines and the &quot;barbarian&quot; migrating tribes in the north, making Isaccea a border town, conquered and held by dozens of different peoples.

==Geography==
The town has under its administration 103.97 km2, of which 3.69 km2 are inside the residential areas.

The town is divided into three settlements: Isaccea proper (4,789 inhabitants) and two villages, Revărsarea (563 inhabitants) and Tichilești (10 inhabitants).

The Tulcea – Brăila roadway (DN22/E87) crosses the town.

The town is located in near to the Măcin Mountains and Dobruja Plateau (in the south) and the Danube (in the north). Many lakes could once be found in the town, but some of them were desiccated by the Communist authorities in order to use the terrain for agriculture. This initiative lacked success, since the soil of the area proved to be not very fertile. Some larger lakes still remain: Saun, Telincea, Rotund, Ghiolul Pietrei, Racova. In April 2006, the dyke which protected this terrain failed and the Danube flooded again the areas which used to be wetlands.

Along the Danube there is a floodplain, which gets inundated every spring, bringing fresh water to the lakes and the marshlands. The largest lake in Isaccea is &quot;Lacul Rotund&quot; (literally, Round Lake), having an area of 2.19 km2 and a volume of 2.0 million m3.

===Tichilești===

Tichilești was founded as a monastery of Tichilești, with time becoming a leper colony. A legend says the monastery was founded by one of the Cantacuzino princesses who was affected by leprosy. Another theory of the history the settlement is that a group of Russian refugees (see Lipovans) settled there and founded the monastery, but soon became outlaws who were eventually caught. In 1918, a part of the lepers moved to Bessarabian town of Izmail. Following a 1926 newspaper article, a hospital was built in 1928 at the monastery. In 1998, there were 39 people in the settlement, and according to the 2002 census, there were 22 people, most of them having an age of more than 60 years. By 2019, there were only 9 people.

===Revărsarea===
Revărsarea was founded after the 1877 War of Independence, being settled by war veterans and colonists, the village being built in the place of a forest which has been cleared. It had several other names since: &quot;Piatra Calcată&quot;, &quot;Principele Nicolae&quot; (named after Prince Nicholas of Romania) and &quot;Ștefan Gheorghiu&quot; (named after Ștefan Gheorghiu, a trade unionist).

==Name==
Possibly the earliest mentioning is in De Administrando Imperio (around 950) of Constantine Porphyrogenitus. It talks about six deserted cities between the Dniester and Bulgaria, among them being Saka-katai, &quot;katai&quot; being most likely a transcription of a Pecheneg word for &quot;city&quot;. The name &quot;Saka&quot; could in turn be derived from Romanian &quot;sacă/seacă&quot;, meaning &quot;barren&quot;, however both the identification of the city with Isaccea and the etymology are mere speculations.

The first clear reference to this name was in the 11th century, when there was a local ruler from &quot;Vicina&quot; named Σακτζας (&quot;Saktzas&quot;, probably &quot;Saccea / Sakça&quot;), for the first time used by Byzantine Anna Comnena in her &quot;Alexiad&quot;. Nicolae Iorga presumed that the ruler was Romanian, however &quot;-ça&quot; (-cea) could also indicate a Turkic suffix.

The 14th-century Arab geographer Abu&#x27;l-Fida mentions the town under the name &quot;Saecdji&quot;, which was a territory of the &quot;Al-Ualak&quot; (Wallachs).

The initial &quot;i&quot; in the name was added during the Ottoman domination, due to the same feature of the Turkish language that transformed &quot;Stanbul&quot; to &quot;Istanbul&quot;. Some local legends claim that the town was named after a certain Isac Baba, however the other explanation is more likely to be true, as the name of the town initially lacked the &quot;i&quot;.

Other historical names include:
* Noviodunum (Latin); Νοβιόδοῦνος, Noviodounos (Greek) - ancient name of Celtic origin, meaning &quot;New Fort&quot; (&quot;&quot; means &quot;new&quot;, while &quot;dun&quot; is Celtic for &quot;hillfort&quot; or &quot;fortified settlement&quot;).
* Genucla - Dacian name of a possibly nearby settlement, derived from , knee.
* Oblucița (Romanian); Облучица, Obluchitsa (Bulgarian); Obluczyca (Polish) - Slavic name derived from the word &quot;oblutak&quot;, that means a rock that was shaped by water into a rounder form.
* Vicina - Genoese name of a port built by Genoese traders as an outpost of the Byzantine Empire. Its location is still unknown, but one of the theories is that it was around Isaccea.

==History==

===Ancient history===

The land where the town is now has been inhabited since prehistoric times: the remains of a neolithic settlement, belonging to the Boian-Giulești culture (4100–3700 BC) were found in the northwestern part of the town, in a place known as &quot;Suhat&quot;.

The neolithic culture was succeeded by the Getae culture with Hellenistic influences. The Celts expanded their territory from Central Europe, reaching Isaccea in the 3rd century BC (see Gallic invasion of the Balkans) and giving the ancient name of town, &quot;Noviodunum&quot;, as well as of other names in this region, such as Aliobrix, on the other side of the Danube and Durostorum further south in Dobruja.

In 514 BC, Darius I of Persia fought here a decisive battle against the Scythians. A trade post was also built in this town by the Greeks. Greek authors such as Ptolemy and Hierocles name it a &quot;polis&quot;.

The town was taken by the Romans in 46 AD and became part of the Moesia province. It was fortified and became the most important military and commercial city in the area, becoming a municipium. Its ruins are located 2 km to the east of modern Isaccea on a hill known as &quot;Eski-Kale&quot; (Turkish for &quot;Old Fortress&quot;). 

Noviodunum fort was the main base of the lower Danube Roman fleet named &quot;Classis Flavia Moesica&quot;, then temporarily the headquarters of the Roman Legio V &quot;Macedonica&quot; (106-167), Legio I &quot;Italica&quot; (167-) and Legio I &quot;Iovia&quot;.

Around 170 AD, the Roman settlements in Dobruja were attacked by the Dacian tribe of the Costoboci, who lived in what is now Moldavia, their attack being visible in the archeological remains of Noviodunum. Further attacks continued in the 3rd century, this time by the combined forces of the Dacian tribe of the Carpi and of the Goths, the decisive battle being probably in 247.

The violent invasions of the Carpi, who plundered the cities and enslaved their inhabitants, left behind many archaeological traces, including buried coin hoards and signs of destruction. The fortress of Noviodunum was probably destroyed during the raids of the Goths and Heruli, during the rule of Gallienus (267), buried hoards being found near it, including a larger treasure containing 1071 Roman coins. The raids left Noviodunum, like other urban centres in the area, depopulated, only returning to its original state toward the end of the 3rd century.

During the rule of Constantine I (306-337), the Noviodunum fortress was rebuilt as part of a bigger project of restoring the Empire&#x27;s borders along the Lower Danube.

By the 4th century, the town also became a Christian centre. The tomb of four Roman Christian martyrs, discovered in September 1971 in nearby Niculiţel, bears the names Zotikos, Attalos, Kamasis and Philippos. They were probably killed in Noviodunum during campaigns of persecutions of early Christians by Diocletian (303-304) and Licinius (319-324), being taken out of the city and buried as martyrs by the local Christians.

In 369 an important battle was fought between the Romans, led by emperor Flavius Valens and the Thervingi led by Athanaric. Valens&#x27; army crossed the river at Noviodunum (Isaccea) using a boat bridge and met the Gothic army in Bessarabia. Although Valens obtained a victory for the Romans, they retreated (possibly because of the lateness of the season) and the Goths asked for a peace treaty, which was signed in the middle of the Danube, the Goths taking an oath to never set foot on Roman soil.

After the division of the Roman Empire, it became part of the Byzantine Empire and it was the most important Byzantine naval base on the Danube. Valips, a chieftain of Germanic Rugians (who were allies of the Huns), took Noviodunum sometimes between 434 and 441 and it was included in the Hunnish Empire, the area becoming a fiefdom of the Hunnish leader Hernac after Attila&#x27;s death.

The Slavs began to settle in early 6th century and possibly the earliest reference to their settlement in the town is Jordanes&#x27; book (written in 551) The Origin and Deeds of the Goths, which mentioned Noviodunum as an extremity of the region were the &quot;Sclaveni&quot; lived. The town continued to be under Byzantine rule, but it suffered the raids from other nomadic peoples, such as the Kutrigurs (559) and Avars (561-562). In the mid-6th century, Justinian I built new fortifications and made it an episcopal see.

During the rule of Phocas (602-610), a massive number of Avars and Slavs crossed the Byzantine border and although their presence protected the empire from other nomads, their control became just formal, until in 681, the Byzantines recognised the First Bulgarian Empire and gave up their claims for the Scythia Minor province. For more than 300 years, Isaccea faded from history and there is no historical or archaeological evidence that the place was even inhabited.

===Mediaeval history===
Around 950, Constantine Porphyrogenitus talks of six desert cities in the area, one being named Saka-katai, which could be the earliest mentioning of the town after it was lost to the migrating people during the Dark Age.

In 971, Isaccea was once again included in the Byzantine Empire and the walls of kastron were reinforced. In 1036, the Pechenegs being driven southward by the Cumans, settled in Scythia Minor, including in this city, fact backed by archeological evidence, such as leaf-shaped pendants, characteristic to them. The Pechenegs traded with the Byzantines, which led to a growth in the economic life of the region, as shown by the number of coins found in Isaccea, reaching 700 coins for the period of 1025–1055. However, the Pechenegs were eventually assimilated and faded from history.

The Byzantines regained control of Isaccea toward the end of the 10th century: a seal of Leo Nicerites, the governor of Paristrion, was found at Isaccea. Around 1100, a double-curtain wall was built in Isaccea.

In the mid-12th century, Isaccea was devastated by Cuman attacks and it was completely rebuilt. In the second half of the 12th century it became the most important Byzantine military base in the region, suggested by the number of imperial seals found there: a seal of Isaac II Angelos (1185–1195) and one of John Vatatzes, the head of the Imperial Guard under Manuel I Komnenos (1143–1180).

According to Arab chronicles, the Nogai Tatars settled in the town in the late 13th century. Between 1280 and 1299, the town was Nogai Khan&#x27;s base of operation in his campaigns against the Bulgarian city of Tarnovo. At the time, the city was a local Muslim centre and the residence of the famous Turkish dervish Sarı Saltuk, who has been associated with Nogai Khan&#x27;s conversion to Islam.

Arab geographer Abulfeda mentioned the town, placing it in the territory of the &quot;Al-Ualak&quot; (Wallachs), having a population mostly Turkic and being ruled by the Byzantines. A Byzantine despotate existed in Northern Dobruja with Isaccea as its centre, which sometimes between 1332 and 1337 became a vassal of the Golden Horde of Nogais under the name &quot;Saqčï&quot;.

The Tatars held an important mint in Isaccea, which minted coins marked with Greek and Arabic letters between the years 1286 and 1351. Various types of silver and copper coins were minted, including coins bearing the mark of the Golden Horde with the names of the khans as well as the names of Nogai Khan and his son Čeke (minted between 1296 and 1301).

In the late 14th century it was ruled by Mircea cel Bătrân of Wallachia, being held until one year before his death. In 1417, the town was conquered, together with other fortresses on the Danube, by the Ottomans, who built a fort defended by a garrison as part of the Danubian frontier established by Mehmed I.

The town was regained by Vlad Țepeș in 1462 during his campaigns against the Ottoman Empire, massacring the local Muslim Bulgarian, Tatar and Turkish population (who were expected to side with the Turks), killing 1350 people in Isaccea and Novoselo, out of more than 23,000 people in all Bulgaria. In a letter to Matthias Corvinus, dated February 11, 1462, he stated:

In 1484, it was taken again by the Ottomans under Mehmed II, being included in the Silistra (Özi) Province, which comprised Dobruja, much of present-day Bulgaria, and later also Budjak and Yedisan.

Țepeș&#x27;s massacre and destruction completely changed the ethnic composition and the appearance of Isaccea, which remaining throughout the 16th century a small, largely Christian, village. Bayazid II&#x27;s conquest of Kilia and Akkerman removed the danger from the north, as did Mehmed II&#x27;s victories against Wallachia remove the threat from the west, and as such, the Sultan saw no reason to rebuild the fortress of Isaccea, nor the settlement of a garrison.

In 1574, Voivode Ioan Vodă cel Cumplit of Moldavia sent Pârcălab Ieremia Golia with an army to Oblucița (Isaccea) to prevent the Ottoman army from fording the river. However, Golia betrayed Ioan for a sum of 30 gold bags, thus leading to the defeat of the Moldavian army and the execution of Ioan.

By the beginning of the 16th century, a new danger arose for the Ottoman border on the Lower Danube: the Cossacks from Ukraine, who, in 1603 crossed the Ottoman border, reached Oblucița and set the town on fire. Sultan Osman II began a series of campaigns against the Cossacks and, as part of his fortification of the border, in 1620, a new fort was built in Isaccea, but in a different place.

On 6 October 1598, Mihai Viteazul defeated the Ottoman army at Oblucița, recapturing the town. The following year, in March 1599, the Ottoman army took back the town and started conducting incursions into Wallachia, with Mihai&#x27;s response being to go beyond the Danube and attack the town of Oblucița. After Mihai&#x27;s death in 1601, the town was regained by the Ottomans.

In December 1673, at the Ottoman Army camp in Isaccea, Dumitrașcu Cantacuzino was chosen Prince of Moldavia.

===Modern history===
During the wars between the Russian Empire and the Ottoman Empire of the 18th and 19th centuries, Isaccea was occupied by each side for several times, being several times set on fire and almost completely destroyed and left abandoned by both sides.

During the Prut River Campaign (1711), the Russians tried to block the Ottomans crossing of the Danube at Isaccea, but failing to do so, the two armies clashed at Stănilești, on the Prut River.

Isaccea was besieged three times in the 1770s: in 1770, 1771 and 1779: in 1771, it was conquered by the Russians in the wake of the Battle of Kagul, the Russians destroying the fortifications and the mosques. Unlike many other settlements in the region, it was not razed, but after ten years of devastating war, only 150 houses were still standing.

Near Isaccea, the Russian flotilla commanded by José de Ribas clashed with and captured the Ottoman flotilla during the Russo-Turkish War (1787–1792). The Ottoman defenders of Isaccea fled, destroying the fortifications left behind. After a while, the Ottomans regained it, being recaptured by Lieutenant-General Galitzine in March 1791.

During the Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829), the Russian Army crossed the Danube at Isaccea, but the Ottoman garrison of the Isaccea fortress surrendered without resistance. A local legend explains the existence of a mound near the old bridge this way: during the Russo-Turkish wars an Ottoman general accused of treason was buried alive (horse included), each of his soldiers being forced to bring a fez full of dirt and throw it over the general.

In 1853, during the Crimean War, it was besieged again by the Russians, before the war theatre moved to Crimea. In December of that year, &quot;The Times&quot; of London noted that &quot;Isaktchi&quot; had a fortified castle and a garrison of 1500 men, but that it was simply a &quot;port of observation&quot; on the river.

After the war, a European Danube Commission was established, which decided to clear the silt at the mouths of the Danube, between Isaccea and the Black Sea; however, the increased trade on the Danube affected Isaccea but little.

At the beginning of the Russo-Turkish War, 1877–1878, the Russians were able to take advantage of Romania&#x27;s railways and mass a great number of troops in Galați. 4000 Russian troops crossed the Danube 14 km south of Măcin and were victorious on June 22, 1877, against the Ottoman garrison. The Russian victories intimidated the Ottoman commander of the Isaccea garrison and the Ottoman troops withdrew from the town, leaving the whole northern part of Dobruja to the Russian armies. Many of the Muslims in the towns of this area fled from the early days of the conflict as the Russian-Romanian army advanced. The city was captured without battle on June 26, 1877, by the 14th Army under the leadership of Major-General Yanov.

Following the Russian-Romanian victory in the war against the Ottoman Empire, Russia took back from Romania the Southern Bessarabia region and as compensation, the newly independent state of Romania received the region of Dobruja, including the town of Isaccea.

In 1915, Nicolae Iorga described Isaccea as &quot;a gathering of small and humble houses spread over a hill slope&quot;.

During World War I, Dobruja was in the areas of operation of a force formed by the Russian and Romanian armies. The first Russian unit crossed the Danube at Isaccea on the day when war was declared (August 27, 1916) and began their deployment toward Bulgaria, an ally of the Central Powers.

Following the failure of the Flămânda Offensive, the Russians began retreating, soon as north as Isaccea. The town was defended by the Romanian and Russian troops against the German offensive, but it was lost on December 24, 1916. Following its defeat, Romania signed the Treaty of Bucharest, by the term of which, Romania ceded the southern part of Dobruja to Bulgaria, while the rest (including Isaccea), was ceded to the Central Powers. The Treaty was voided by the terms of the Armistice of November 11, 1918 and Isaccea was thus returned to Romania.

In February 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, thousands of Ukrainians crossed by ferry into Romania at Isaccea in search of refuge.

==Demographics==
The majority of the population is formed by Orthodox Christian Romanians, but there is also a 4% minority of Muslim Turks. In 1516, it was a purely Christian village, with 163 households; in 1518, there were 256 Christian houses. By the end of the 16th century, the town grew to 332 Christian households and 25 Muslim households, of which half were new converts.

===Ethnic structure===
In 1828, there were 363 Romanians, 183 Turks, 163 Cossacks, 29 Greeks, 20 Jews and 3 Armenians.

According to the 2011 Romanian census, the ethnic structure of the population of Isaccea was the following:
===Religion===

==Government==
The city government is headed by a mayor (&quot;primar&quot;), while the decisions are approved and discussed by the local council (&quot;consiliu local&quot;) made up of 15 elected councillors. From 1996 to 2012, the mayor of Isaccea was Ilie Petre, from the Democratic Liberal Party, who was re-elected for a fourth term in the 2008 local elections, winning in the second round by earning 61.46% of votes against Anastase Moraru, a candidate of the Social Democratic Party. At the 2012 local elections, Moraru defeated Ilie. Moraru was re-elected in 2016 and 2020.

Since September 2020, the local council members belong to the following parties:

*Social Democratic Party: 5
*PRO Romania: 4
*National Liberal Party: 4
*USR PLUS: 2

==Economy==

The town has long been a station in the trade between the eastern Mediterranean and the continental eastern Europe. The Greeks built their first trade post around 2700 years ago and trade continued after the Roman and later Byzantine and Ottoman takeovers. In the 16th century, the town was located on the Moldavian-Ottoman border and its bazaar was one of the four most important trading posts in the Dobruja, with tradesmen coming from distant places, such as Chios or Ragusa. The main traded goods were cattle, sheep, wine, cloth and wood. The town lost its influence in the 19th century, as the sea and river transport was mostly replaced by train and later road transport and as the Danube traffic navigates on the Danube-Black Sea Canal.

Much of the local economy is based on agriculture, especially animal husbandry and fishing. The town&#x27;s farms have a number of 2595 sheep, 728 cows, 510 pigs, 240 horses and 16,000 birds. Industry is based on extraction of rock from a nearby quarry and woodworking, a tobacco processing factory and a winery.

Since 2004, the town is also home for a beluga reproduction research station, financed by the Romanian state. The world&#x27;s first in vitro fertilisation research station for the beluga, it is fish farm, but also raises beluga to be freed into the Danube, freeing around 3000 belugas.

The town is also a port on the Danube, having two mooring places for ships. It is mostly used for loading cereals and stone onto cargo ship.

Isaccea is the entry point in Romania of the Isaccea-Negru Vodă gas pipeline (built between 2000 and 2002 to replace a smaller pipeline built in the 1980s) linking Ukraine and Bulgaria, bringing natural gas from Russia to Bulgaria, Greece and Turkey. It has a diameter of 1200 mm and a capacity of 28 billion m3/year. The town is also the entry point of the 400 kV Isaccea-Vulcăneşti electrical transmission line, through which Romania imports electricity from the Russian-owned Cuciurgan powerplant in the Transnistria region of Moldova.

A sewage treatment plant is going to be built in Isaccea by 2012, funded 80.2% from the Cohesion Funds from the European Union.

<text>The Edinburgh Festival Fringe (also referred to as the Edinburgh Fringe, the Fringe or the Edinburgh Fringe Festival) is the world&#x27;s largest performance arts festival, which in 2024 spanned 25 days, sold more than 2.6 million tickets and featured more than 51,446 scheduled performances of 3,746 different shows across 262 venues from 60 different countries. Of those shows, the largest section was comedy, representing almost 40% of shows, followed by theatre, which was 26.6% of shows. 

Established in 1947 as an unofficial offshoot to (and on the &quot;fringe&quot; of) the Edinburgh International Festival, it takes place in Edinburgh every August. The combination of Edinburgh Festival Fringe and Edinburgh International Festival has become a world-leading celebration of arts and culture, surpassed only by the Olympics and the World Cup in terms of global ticketed events.

It is an open-access (or &quot;unjuried&quot;) performing arts festival, meaning that there is no selection committee, and anyone may participate, with any type of performance. The official Fringe Programme categorises shows into sections for theatre, comedy, dance, physical theatre, circus, cabaret, children&#x27;s shows, musicals, opera, music, spoken word, exhibitions, and events. Comedy is the largest section, making up over one-third of the programme, and the one that in modern times has the highest public profile, due in part to the Edinburgh Comedy Awards.

The Festival is supported by the Edinburgh Festival Fringe Society, which publishes the programme, sells tickets to all events from a central physical box office and website, and offers year-round advice and support to performers. The Society&#x27;s permanent location is at the Fringe Shop on the Royal Mile, and in August they also manage Fringe Central, a separate collection of spaces dedicated to providing support for Fringe participants during their time at the festival.

The Fringe board of directors is drawn from members of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe Society, many of whom are Fringe participants themselves – performers or venue operators. Elections are held once a year, in August, and board members serve a term of four years. The Board appoints the Fringe Society&#x27;s Chief Executive (formerly known as the Fringe Administrator or Director). The Chief Executive operates under the chair.

Phoebe Waller-Bridge, whose show &quot;Fleabag&quot; was performed at the Fringe in 2013 before it was adapted for television, was named the first-ever President of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe Society in 2021.

The planned 2020 Fringe Festival was suspended along with all of the city&#x27;s other major summer festivals. This came as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak in the early months of the year, with concerns of spreading the virus any further.

The 2021 festival took place during 6–30 August 2021, though it was much reduced in size, with 528 shows in person and 414 online. The 2022 festival took place from 5–29 August 2022 and marked a return to pre-pandemic levels, with 3,334 shows. Fifty were livestreamed, by NextUp Comedy, for the first time ever since the founding of The Fringe, in an effort to stay true to The Fringe Society&#x27;s 2022 vision of equality and inclusiveness. The 2025 festival is scheduled from August 1 to 25.

==History and origins==

===Early years===
The Fringe started life when eight theatre companies turned up uninvited to the inaugural Edinburgh International Festival in 1947. With the International Festival using the city&#x27;s major venues, these companies took over smaller, alternative venues for their productions. Seven performed in Edinburgh, and one undertook a version of the medieval morality play &quot;Everyman&quot; in Dunfermline Abbey, about 20 miles north, across the River Forth in Fife. These groups aimed to take advantage of the large assembled theatre crowds to showcase their own alternative theatre. Although at the time it was not recognised as such, this was the first Edinburgh Festival Fringe.

This meant that two defining features of the future Fringe were established at the very beginning – the lack of official invitations to perform and the use of unconventional venues. Originally, these groups referred to themselves as the &quot;Festival Adjuncts&quot; and were also referred to as the &quot;semi-official&quot; festival. It was not until the following year, 1948, that Robert Kemp, a Scottish playwright and journalist, is credited with coining the title &quot;Fringe&quot; when he wrote during the second Edinburgh International Festival:
Round the fringe of official Festival drama, there seems to be more private enterprise than before ... I am afraid some of us are not going to be at home during the evenings!
The word &quot;fringe&quot; had in fact been used in a review of &quot;Everyman&quot; in 1947, when a critic remarked it was a shame the show was so far out &quot;on the fringe of the Festival&quot;. In 1950, it was still being referred to in similar terms, with a small &#x27;f&#x27;:
On the fringe of the official Festival there are many praiseworthy &quot;extras,&quot; including presentations by the Scottish Community Drama Association and Edinburgh University Dramatic Society – &quot;Dundee Courier&quot;, 24 August 1950
Since it was not yet fully developed, much of the early years of the Fringe has gone unrecorded, except through anecdote. It did not benefit from any official organisation until 1951, when students of the University of Edinburgh set up a drop-in centre in the YMCA, where cheap food and a bed for the night were made available to participating groups.

Late-night revues, which would become a feature of Fringes, began to appear in the early 1950s. The first one was the New Drama Group&#x27;s &quot;After The Show&quot;, a series of sketches taking place after Donald Pleasence&#x27;s &quot;Ebb Tide&quot;, in 1952. Among the talent to appear in early Fringe revues were Ned Sherrin in 1955, and Ken Loach and Dudley Moore with the Oxford Theatre Group in 1958. Due to many reviewers only being able to attend Fringe events late night after the official festival was finished, the Fringe came to be seen as being about revues.

It was a few years before an official programme for the Fringe was created. John Menzies compiled a list of shows under the title &quot;Other Events&quot; in their omnibus festival brochure, but it was printer C. J. Cousland who was the first to publish a listings guide, in 1954. This was funded by participating companies and was entitled &quot;Additional Entertainments&quot;, since the name &quot;Fringe&quot; was still not yet in regular usage.

By that year, the Fringe was attracting around a dozen companies, and a meeting was held to discuss creating &quot;a small organisation to act as a brain for the Fringe&quot;, or what &quot;The Scotsman&quot; called an &quot;official unofficial festival&quot;. A first attempt was made to provide a central booking service in 1955 by students from the university, although it lost money, which was blamed on those who had not taken part.

In 1956, the famous actor Donald Wolfit performed the solo show &quot;The Strong Are Lonely&quot;. This was not part of the International Festival, yet nor was it in the Fringe Programme, leading him to question the value of the &quot;Fringe&quot;: &quot;Away with the Fringe. To an artist in the theatre there is no such thing as a fringe of art.&quot;

Formal organisation progressed in 1959, with the formation of the Festival Fringe Society. The push for such an organisation was led by Michael Imison, director of Oxford Theatre Group. A constitution was drawn up, in which the policy of not vetting or censoring shows was set out, and the Society produced the first guide to Fringe shows. Nineteen companies participated in the Fringe in that year. By that time it provided a &quot;complete... counter-festival programme&quot; although efforts were still being made to gain publicity through the International Festival programme. The YMCA became established as the first central Fringe ticket office.

Not long afterwards came the first complaints that the Fringe had become too big. Director Gerard Slevin claimed in 1961 that &quot;it would be much better if only ten halls were licensed&quot;.

===1960s and 1970s===

In the 1960s and 1970s, the Fringe began to establish its reputation for size and variety and the tension between it and the more formal International Festival became of mutual benefit.

The artistic credentials of the Fringe were established by the creators of the Traverse Theatre, John Calder, Jim Haynes and Richard Demarco, in 1963. While their original objective was to maintain something of the Festival atmosphere in Edinburgh all year round, the Traverse Theatre quickly and regularly presented cutting-edge drama to an international audience at both the Edinburgh International Festival and the Fringe during August. It set a standard to which other companies on the Fringe aspired. The Traverse is occasionally referred to as &quot;The Fringe venue that got away&quot;, reflecting its current status as a permanent and integral part of the Edinburgh arts scene.

The Pleasance, a venue since the first year of the Fringe, was also important in setting the artistic tone. Christopher Richardson, founder of the Pleasance Theatre Trust, became a major Fringe figure.

John Cairney is credited with pioneering the one-man Fringe show with his show based on Robert Burns, &quot;There Was A Man&quot;, in 1965, although Elspeth Douglas Reid had done her &quot;One Woman Theatre&quot; as early as 1955. American Nancy Cole played Gertrude Stein in 1969 and continued to do so until 1985. 
Over the first two decades of the Fringe, each performing group used its own performing space, or venue. However, by the late 1960s, the concept of sharing a venue became popular, principally as a means of cutting costs. It soon became common for halls to host up to six or seven different shows per day. The obvious next step was to partition a venue into two or more performing spaces; the majority of today&#x27;s major venues fit into this category.

For many years, the Fringe Club (variously in the High Street from 1971 and at Teviot Row House from 1981) provided nightly showcases of Fringe fare to allow audiences to sample shows. In its earlier years the club also provided a significant space for after-hours socialising at a time when Edinburgh&#x27;s strict licensing laws meant a 10pm pub closing time. For a time, the main ticket office was in the University Chaplaincy Centre, and then in the Royal Mile Centre on the High Street. Although the Fringe was now associated with the High Street, areas like the New Town, West End and Morningside were also prominent in this period.

Problems then began to arise as the Fringe became too big for students and volunteers to deal with. Eventually in 1969, the Fringe Society became a constituted body, and in 1970 it employed its first administrator, John Milligan. He started work in January 1971, originally on a part-time basis, but it became clear after a few weeks that the role would have to be permanent. Milligan was responsible for a number of innovations which remain in place today, such as the numbering system for venues and the Fringe map in the brochure, and he was also credited with establishing the co-operative spirit of the Fringe. He left in 1976.

Between 1976 and 1981, under the direction of Alistair Moffat, the number of companies performing rose from 182 to 494, and new venues such as St Columba&#x27;s in Newington came on board. Moffat also expanded the street performance aspect and brought in sponsorship deals, particularly local breweries. In this way, the Fringe ascended to its current position as the largest arts festival in the world. This was a deliberate policy by Moffat, who found it difficult to promote the Fringe on merit given the Society&#x27;s position of neutrality. Increasing show numbers was therefore a way of attracting more attention. At this point, the Fringe operated on only two full-time members of staff. In 1977, the office moved to a converted shop and basement at 170 High Street.

The International Festival, now under the direction of John Drummond, became more accommodating towards the Fringe in the late 1970s and some successful Fringe performers transferred to perform works at the Festival. These included Richard Crane and Faynia Williams, who in 1981 produced a sell-out version of The Brothers Karamazov for the Festival, after having been successful in the Fringe during the &#x27;70s.

===1980s===
The early 1980s saw the arrival of the &quot;super-venue&quot; – locations that contained multiple performing spaces. By 1981 when William Burdett-Coutts set up the Assembly Theatre in the empty Georgian building Assembly Rooms on George Street (formerly the EIF Festival Club), the investment in staging, lighting and sound meant that the original amateur or student theatricals were left behind. In the same year, the YMCA in South St Andrew Street, which had been an important venue since the early days, closed. However, the subsequent rise in prominence of the Assembly Rooms meant there was now a balance in the Fringe between the Old Town and the New Town, with Princes Street in the middle.

Fringe Sunday started in the High Street in 1981 and moved, through pressure of popularity, to Holyrood Park in 1983. Fringe Sunday was held on the second Sunday of the Fringe when companies performed for free. Having outgrown even Holyrood Park, this showcase took place on The Meadows and continued until 2008.

1981 was a watershed for comedy at the Fringe too. It was the first year of the Perrier Awards, which ran until 2005 and are now known as the Edinburgh Comedy Awards. The alternative comedy scene was also beginning to take shape. Previously, comedy at the Fringe had taken the form of student revues. Now stand-up was becoming a feature. According to Alexei Sayle, &quot;The Fringe then was entirely University revues and plays; there was not a single piece of stand-up comedy until me and Tony [Allen] arrived.&quot; Comedy began an ascent which would see it become the biggest section of the programme by 2008.

Moffat resigned as the Fringe Society Administrator in 1981 and was succeeded by Michael Dale, who changed the programme layout and helped the Fringe consolidate.

The following year, 1982, The Circuit became a prominent venue. Run by the Actors Touring Company, it had operated in the south side of the city in 1980 and 1981, but in 1982 expanded into a piece of empty ground popularly known as &quot;The Hole in The Ground&quot; near the Usher Hall. This was once the site of a church building (Poole&#x27;s Synod Hall), which was converted to a cinema, and where the Saltire complex was subsequently built in the early 1990s. The new Traverse Theatre opened here in 1993. It had a 700-seat marquee auditorium, which hosted, among other things, opera, even though the organisers had been told it was no such place for the artform. The venue also took over the nearby Heriot-Watt Students&#x27; Association and the Little Lyceum. In total, it hosted 38 companies. The next year it became a &quot;tented village&quot;, with several smaller tents. Malcolm Hardee made his debut here as part of The Greatest Show On Legs. In 1982 the enterprise lost £28,000, and in 1983 there were further criticisms related to over-charging, over-crowding and inadequate facilities. The Circuit was not repeated, but it had demonstrated the potential for temporary venues at the Fringe, which are now a familiar sight.

Even with the rise of super venues, there was still theatre done on a shoestring, but several cultural entrepreneurs had raised the stakes to the point where a venue like Aurora (St Stephen&#x27;s Church, Stockbridge) could hold its head up in any major world festival. However, in 1982, 24% of the Fringe was housed in The Circuit/Assembly, both of which were being commercially marketed, and this attracted complaints, including from Traverse Theatre founder, Richard Demarco, who felt the Fringe should not have allowed either venue. By 1988, there was, according to former Fringe Administrator Michael Dale, a feeling that &quot;smaller venues may lose out, but this case may be overstated... The episode of the super-venues, the Assembly Rooms in particular, has some way to go yet&quot;.

Student shows continued to thrive with the National Student Theatre Company, National Youth Music Theatre, Cambridge Mummers, Oxford Theatre Group and Bradford University producing well-received new work. Among professional companies, the Almeida Theatre, ATC, Cheek By Jowl, Cherub, Cliff Hanger, Entertainment Machine, Hull Truck, Kick Theatre, Lumiere and Son, Medieval Players and Trickster were regulars.

In 1983, the Fringe joined with the International Festival, Edinburgh Tattoo and the Film Festival to promote Edinburgh as &#x27;The Festival City&#x27; for the first time.

Moffatt believed the growth of the Fringe would stop due to a lack of venues, but just as that limit seemed to be being reached, groups began to find more efficient ways of sharing spaces. Venues could be fully utilised from 10am to 2am, with up to seven different groups throughout the day. The sharing led to the rise of bigger, more centralised venues. Rents increased too, with a venue like Heriot-Watt Students&#x27; Union doubling their rent in three years.

In 1986, promoter Karen Koren established The Gilded Balloon as a comedy venue in the former J. &amp; R. Allan&#x27;s department store on Cowgate. A 3am late licence made it a home for late-night socialising for comedians, and the raucous late-night show &quot;Late &#x27;n&#x27; Live&quot; was started there. 
In 1988, the Society moved from 170 High Street to expanded headquarters at 158–166 High Street on the Royal Mile, with an extension leading back towards the former Wireworks Building. The basement became the new ticket office. Its current headquarters are at 180 High Street.

===1990s and 2000s===
Acts included The Jim Rose Circus, who performed in 2008, and Tokyo Shock Boys who performed in 1994.

The Fringe Club ceased operation in 2004, but various venues still provide &quot;the Best of the Fest&quot; and similar.

A computerised booking system was first installed in the early 1990s, allowing tickets to be bought at a number of locations around the city. The internet began to have an impact in 2000 with the launch of the Fringe&#x27;s official website, which sold more than half a million tickets online by 2005. The following year, a Half Price Ticket Tent, run in association with &quot;Metro&quot; newspaper, started offering special ticket prices for different shows each day. This sold 45,000 tickets in its first year.

In 2008, the Fringe faced its biggest crisis so far when the computerised ticketing system failed. The events surrounding the failed box office software led to the resignation of Fringe Director Jon Morgan after only one full year in post. The resultant financial loss suffered by the Fringe Society was estimated at £300,000, which it was forced to meet from its reserves, although other sources report this at £900,000. These events attracted much comment from the UK and world media. More debts emerged as the year went on, and an independent report criticised the Board and the current and previous Fringe Directors for a failure of management and an inability to provide the basic service.

The Board eventually decided that the post of &quot;Director&quot; (instituted in 1992 in lieu of &quot;Fringe Administrator&quot;) would be abolished and replaced by a Chief Executive, to reinforce the Fringe head&#x27;s basic administrative function. A report into the failure was commissioned from accountancy firm Scott-Moncrieff. Several venues now use their own ticketing systems; this is partly due to issues of commissions and how ticket revenue is distributed, but was reinforced by this 2008 failure of the main box office.

The same year, other incidents conspired to add to the negative publicity. Fringe Sunday – a vast free showcase of events held on The Meadows – was cancelled when a sponsor could not be secured. The &quot;Big Four&quot; venues - Assembly, Gilded Balloon, The Pleasance and Underbelly - also decided to market themselves as Edinburgh Comedy Festival, which drew criticism from some quarters.

After an interim period, during which Tim Hawkins, formerly general manager of Brighton Komedia took charge, the established Edinburgh Book Festival and Fringe manager Kath Mainland was appointed in February 2009 to stabilise the situation, becoming the Fringe&#x27;s first Chief Executive.

Comedy finally surpassed theatre as the biggest section of the programme in 2008, with 660 comedy entries to 599.

In 2009, theSpaceUK launched their multi-space complex at the Royal College of Surgeons. In 2011, a new all-year-round multi-arts festival venue, containing ten performance spaces, opened in the former Royal (Dick) Veterinary School under the name Summerhall.

In 2018, an initiative called Fringe of Colour was founded by Jess Brough in response to what they termed the &quot;overwhelming whiteness&quot; of the Edinburgh Festivals.

===The Fringe today===

In 2016, Shona McCarthy, who had led Derry&#x27;s term as UK City of Culture, took over from Kath Mainland as Chief Executive.
It was announced on 8 October 2024 that Shona McCarthy would step down in spring 2025 after leading the Fringe for nine years. 

Along with the other Edinburgh festivals, the Fringe could not go ahead as planned in 2020 due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The Fringe returned in 2021 with fewer shows and restrictions due to COVID-19 pandemic. By 2024, the Fringe registered the second highest number of shows in its history, marking a return close to pre-pandemic levels.

==Venues==


Fringe venues come in all shapes and sizes, with use being made of nearly any viable space that is available, from regular theatres (e.g. the Traverse or Bedlam Theatre), function rooms (e.g. the Assembly Rooms), churches and church halls (e.g. the Quaker Meeting House, Paradise in Augustines), lecture theatres (including the notable George Square Theatre), conference centres, other university rooms and spaces, bars and pubs, temporary structures (The Famous Spiegeltent and the Udderbelly), schools, a public toilet, the back of a taxi, a double-decker bus and even in the audience&#x27;s own homes.

The groups that operate the venues are also diverse: some are commercial and others not-for-profit; some operate year-round, while others exist only to run venues at the Fringe. Some are local, others are based in London and elsewhere and transfer to Edinburgh for August.

From the performers&#x27; perspective, the decision on where to perform is typically based on a mixture of cost, location (close proximity to the main Fringe hubs around the university is seen as an advantage), and the philosophy of the venue – some of whom specialise in amateur, school or college productions, some of whom are semi or wholly professional.

In 2019, there were more than 3,800 shows registered in the programme, taking place in 322 different venues.

The main venue operators can broadly be split into four groups:
* The Big Four – Assembly, Gilded Balloon, The Pleasance, Underbelly. The term &#x27;Big Four&#x27; being an adopted label. These are in some cases the most long-standing venues (Underbelly being a relative newcomer, having been founded in 1996). They each operate multi-room venue complexes, often across multiple sites. They tend to specialise in comedy, and in 2008, they briefly and controversially tried to re-brand themselves as Edinburgh Comedy Festival. 
* Modern Fringe – Besides the Big Four (A term less used at the modern fringe), there are a number of operators running multi-room venues, and again sometimes operating across more than one site. These include theSpaceUK, C venues, Greenside Venues, Sweet Venues, Just the Tonic, ZOO venues, PQA Venues, Monkey Barrel and Paradise Green. They may specialise in certain genres or run a programme across all genres (theSpaceUK, C venues, Zoo Venues and Greenside Venues). Although focusing on new writing rather than comedy, one is larger, theSpaceUK hosted over 400 shows at the 2019 Fringe, making it the largest operator by number of shows at the modern fringe.
* Free venues – Some promoters use a different financial model. Instead of charging performers to hire the room, and audiences to attend, they make their spaces available for free, with audiences making a donation at the end of the show if they have enjoyed it. These promoters tend to operate out of pubs and clubs – the rooms being made free to use as a way of boosting bar takings. The original Free Fringe was set up by comedian Peter Buckley Hill in response to the increasing costs to performers of appearing at the Fringe. The other main free promoter is Alex Petty&#x27;s Laughing Horse Free Festival. Although the term &quot;Free Fringe&quot; originally referred to Buckley Hill&#x27;s operation, it is now often used as shorthand for any free venue.
* Pay What You Want – In 2013, comedian Bob Slayer introduced a new model to the Fringe, at his Heroes of Fringe venues, where punters could &#x27;Buy a ticket in advance to guarantee a seat or Pay What You Want (PWYW) on exit&#x27;. The model is a mixture of Paid and Free and enables performers to find a paying audience without risking large marketing spend. Phil Kay, Tom Binns and Miss Behave were among the first established acts to embrace this model along with Adrienne Truscott who won the Edinburgh Comedy Awards Panel Prize with a PWYW show. Adam Hess was nominated for best newcomer in 2015. Other promoters such as Just the Tonic, The Pleasance and C Venues have since introduced the model to some of their venues. In 2016, Gilded Balloon adopted PWYW for the Counting House, which had previously been a Free Festival venue, and has since returned to that model.

There also continue to be single, independent venues, sometimes only hosting one show, sometimes only for a limited period.

During the Fringe, the pedestrianised area of the High Street around St Giles&#x27; Cathedral and the Fringe Office becomes the focal point for theatre companies to hand out flyers, perform scenes from their shows, and attempt to sell tickets. These performances run alongside the Fringe Street Events which feature more than 200 street performers and thousands of buskers on the High Street and Mound Precinct. Many shows are &quot;2 for 1&quot; on the first Monday and Tuesday of the festival and different venues operate independent ticket offers throughout the festival.

In February 2025, the Fringe Society acquired the former South Bridge Resource Centre in Infirmary Street for use as their permanent base. As well as administrative offices, the building would provide space for Fringe participants and also serve as Fringe Central during August.

==Shows==
===Notable shows===

Many notable original shows originated at the Fringe and it has helped establish the careers of many writers and performers, including Rowan Atkinson, Steven Berkoff, Jo Brand, Billy Connolly, Ben Elton, Eddie Izzard, Stephen Fry, Stewart Lee, Tim Minchin, and Tadeusz Kantor.

In 1960, Alan Bennett, Dudley Moore, Peter Cook and Jonathan Miller performed at the Royal Lyceum Theatre in &quot;Beyond the Fringe&quot;, introducing a new wave of British satire and heralding a change in attitudes towards politicians and the establishment. Ironically, this show was put together by the Edinburgh International Festival as a rebuff to the emerging Fringe. But its title alone helped publicise &quot;the Fringe&quot;, especially when it went on to London&#x27;s West End and New York&#x27;s Broadway for the next 12 months.

Tom Stoppard&#x27;s play, &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead&quot; was first performed in its full version at the 1966 Fringe. Noted actor Derek Jacobi starred in a sixth-form production of &quot;Hamlet,&quot; which was very well regarded.

During the 1980s, the Fringe attracted a number of major touring companies. Joint Stock Theatre Company, a leading innovative touring company at that time, brought two productions to the Fringe – &quot;The Great Celestial Cow&quot; by Sue Townsend and &quot;Fire in the Lake&quot; by Karim Alrawi.

In 1986, the Fringe saw the break-out performance of Craig Ferguson as &quot;Bing Hitler&quot;, a &quot;parody of all the über-patriotic native folk singers who seemed to infect every public performance in Scotland&quot;.

In the 21st century, shows that have debuted at the Fringe and then gone on to wider fame (or notoriety) include &quot;Stomp&quot; (theatrical show), &quot;Black Watch&quot; by the National Theatre of Scotland, and &quot;Jerry Springer: The Opera&quot;.

2003 saw a production of &quot;12 Angry Men&quot; staged at the Assembly Rooms using established comedians in the roles of the twelve jurors. Directed and produced by Guy Masterson, it starred Owen O&#x27;Neill in the role made famous by Henry Fonda, Juror number eight. Stephen Frost, Phil Nichol and Bill Bailey also featured.
A 2004 version of &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; was beset by problems, including the lead actor Christian Slater contracting chicken pox and the original director, Guy Masterson, quitting the project before it opened. Masterson was replaced by Terry Johnson.

In 2005, a production of Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; starring Bill Bailey and Alan Davies also directed by Guy Masterson was staged at the Assembly Hall, the meeting place on the Mound of the Church of Scotland. This had been taken over by Assembly Theatre and transformed into an 840-seat theatre.

The Tattoo set-up at Edinburgh Castle served as the 6,000-seat venue for a one-off performance by Ricky Gervais of his stand-up show &quot;Fame&quot; in 2007. Gervais was accused of greed and taking audiences away from smaller shows. Gervais donated the profits from the show to Macmillan Cancer Support.

&quot;Fleabag&quot;, which Phoebe Waller-Bridge first performed as a solo show at Underbelly in 2013, later became a TV series. Phoebe Waller-Bridge was later announced as President of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe Society in 2021.

In 2015, the Sherman/Nicholls original musical production of &quot;Love Birds&quot; made its premiere at The Pleasance.

Hannah Gadsby&#x27;s show &quot;Nanette&quot; won the 2017 Edinburgh Comedy Award and was credited with challenging stand-up comedy convention. It subsequently developed a worldwide audience via Netflix.

In 2017, Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss&#x27;s &quot;Six the Musical&quot; debuted at the Fringe, ahead of a national tour. The show would later go to the West End, then Broadway in 2020.

==People==
===Veteran performers===
Arthur Smith, Paul Merton, Barry Cryer and Richard Herring are among the comedians who have performed at more Edinburgh Fringe festivals than anyone else. Arthur Smith has performed regularly at the Festival for over 40 years (since 1977), Paul Merton has been performing regularly at the festival since 1985. Barry Cryer performed at about 25 Edinburgh Fringes (since the 90s) and Richard Herring has performed at 25 Fringes (since 1987). Nicholas Parsons attended the very first Fringe as a 23-year-old in 1947 and hosted his long-standing &quot;Happy Hour&quot; show until his death, aged 96.

===Officials and administrators===
The first chair of the board of directors was Lord Grant, a High Court judge, who gave way in 1970 to the actor Andrew Cruickshank. He was succeeded in 1983 by Jonathan Miller, and then by Elizabeth Smith, Baroness Smith (widow of former Labour Leader John Smith). The current chair is Benny Higgins, who succeeded Professor Sir Timothy O&#x27;Shea in 2021.

The first full-time Fringe chief was John Milligan, who had worked for the Arts Council and been a researcher with BBC Scotland. He left in 1976 to run the Craigmillar Festival, and was succeeded by Alistair Moffat, who had been involved in running the first St Andrews Festival in 1971 and had organised a small festival in his hometown of Kelso in 1972.

Moffat left in 1981 to become Head of Arts at Scottish Television. He was replaced by Michael Dale, who had worked with Moffat at the St Andrews Festival and was recommended to apply by him. He had worked at the Cambridge Arts Theatre and Young Vic.

Dale departed in 1986 to become Head of Events for the Glasgow Garden Festival and was succeeded by his deputy, Mhairi Mackenzie-Robinson, who left in 1993 to pursue a career in business. Hilary Strong served in the position until 1999, when she then became director of the Greenwich Theatre. She was followed by Paul Gudgin (2000–2007), Jon Morgan (2007–2008) and Kath Mainland (2008–2016). In November 2015, Mainland announced her decision to step down as Chief Executive to take on the role of executive director of the Melbourne Festival, and in early 2016 it was announced that her successor would be Shona McCarthy, who had headed up the 2013 Derry-Londonderry UK City of Culture. She took up the position in March 2016.

===Promoters and artistic directors===
The Fringe has made the careers of many on the artistic and organisational side of the Fringe. William Burdett-Coutt, Karen Koren, Anthony Alderson and Charlie Wood and Ed Bartlam, the directors of the so-called &quot;Big Four&quot; venues have become well known on the cultural scene.

==Ethos==

The Fringe is an open access festival. The role of the Fringe Society is solely to facilitate the festival, concentrating mainly on the challenging logistics of organising such a large event. Alistair Moffat (Fringe administrator 1976–1981) summarised the role of the Society when he said, &quot;As a direct result of the wishes of the participants, the Society had been set up to help the performers that come to Edinburgh and to promote them collectively to the public. It did not come together so that groups could be invited, or in some way artistically vetted. What was performed and how it was done was left entirely to each Fringe group&quot;. This approach is now sometimes referred to as an &quot;unjuried festival&quot;, &quot;open access arts festival&quot; or a &quot;fringe festival.&quot;

Over the years, this approach has led to adverse criticism about the quality of the Fringe. Much of this criticism comes from individual arts critics in national newspapers, hard-line aficionados of the Edinburgh International Festival, and occasionally from the Edinburgh International Festival itself.

The Fringe&#x27;s own position on this debate may be summed up by Michael Dale (Fringe Administrator 1982–1986) in his book &quot;Sore Throats &amp; Overdrafts&quot;, &quot;No-one can say what the quality will be like overall. It does not much matter, actually, for that is not the point of the Fringe ... The Fringe is a forum for ideas and achievement unique in the UK, and in the whole world ... Where else could all this be attempted, let alone work?&quot;. Views from the middle ground of this perennial debate point out that the Fringe is not complete artistic anarchy. Some venues do influence or decide on the content of their programme, such as the Traverse and Aurora Nova, who used to run their own venue but are now just a production group.

The Fringe itself at times sprouts a fringe. While the festival is unjuried, participating in the Fringe requires registration, payment of a registration fee,
and use of a Fringe venue. For example, the 2008 registration fee was £289.05.
Some outdoor spaces also require registration, notably the Royal Mile.
Thus some artists perform outside the auspices of the Fringe, either individually or as part of a festival or in association with a venue, either outdoors or in non-Fringe venues.

Started by Deborah Pearson in 2007, and continuing in 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011, under the co-directorship of Andy Field and Pearson, a primary &quot;Fringe of the Fringe&quot; festival was held,
at The Forest, with support from 2008 to 2010 by the Battersea Arts Centre (BAC) and support from several organisations including the Jerwood Foundation and Queen&#x27;s University in Canada. Its aim was to encourage experimentation by reducing costs to performers – not charging for space, and providing accommodation. The same applied to audiences: all shows being &quot;pay what you can&quot;.

In 2022, the festival&#x27;s 75th anniversary year, the Fringe Society consulted with stakeholders from across the festival – from artists to venues, residents to government bodies – to create a shared vision and set of values. The vision was “to give anyone a stage and everyone a seat”. Rooted in equality and inclusiveness, it was designed inspire all Fringe stakeholders to pull in the same direction.

Three values were also established to guide the behaviours and decisions of everyone involved with the Fringe. The Fringe Society said they would “live by them, champion them and uphold them where necessary”. The three values are:
* Celebrate performing arts
* Be open to all
* Look out for each other

==Influence==
The concept of fringe theatre has been copied around the world. The largest and most celebrated of these spawned festivals are Adelaide Fringe (established 1960 and second biggest in the world), National Arts Festival in Machanda, formerly Grahamstown, South Africa (1973), and Edmonton International Fringe Festival (1982). The number of such events continues to grow, particularly in the US and Canada. (In the case of Edinburgh, the Fringe is an addition to the Festival proper, being officially known as the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. Where there is no pre-existing Festival to be added to, such as New York International Fringe Festival (est. 1997), the word comes before the word &quot;festival&quot;.)

In August 2016, the Adelaide Fringe began an official partnership with Edinburgh Fringe.

In the field of drama, the Edinburgh Fringe has premièred several plays and musicals, most notably &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead&quot; by Tom Stoppard (1966), &quot;Moscow Stations&quot; (1994), which starred Tom Courtenay, and most recently &quot;Six the Musical&quot; by Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss (2017). Over the years, it has attracted a number of companies that have made repeated visits to the Fringe, and in doing so helped to set high artistic standards. They have included: the London Club Theatre Group (1950s), 7:84 Scotland (1970s), the Children&#x27;s Music Theatre, later the National Youth Music Theatre under Jeremy James Taylor, the National Student Theatre Company (from the 1970s), Communicado (1980s and 1990s), Red Shift (1990s), Grid Iron and Fitchburg State University. The Fringe is also the staging ground of the American High School Theatre Festival.

In the field of comedy, the Fringe has provided a platform that has allowed the careers of many performers to bloom. In the 1960s, various members of the Monty Python team appeared in student productions, as subsequently did Rowan Atkinson, Stephen Fry, Hugh Laurie and Emma Thompson, the latter three with the 1981 Cambridge Footlights. Atkinson was at Oxford. Notable companies in the 1980s have included Complicite and the National Theatre of Brent. More recent comedy performers to have been &quot;discovered&quot; include Rory Bremner, Fascinating Aïda, Reduced Shakespeare Company, Steve Coogan, Jenny Eclair, The League of Gentlemen, Flight of the Conchords, Al Murray and Rich Hall.

Many performers have spoken highly of the Fringe, and the effect it has had on their career. Magician Paul Daniels first appeared at the Fringe in the twilight of his career in 2013, and commented: &quot;I&#x27;ve become Edinburgh&#x27;s publicity agent. I tell everybody, &#x27;You&#x27;ve got to be in it.

==Controversies==

===Subject matter===

The freedom to put on any show has led periodically to controversy when individual tastes in sexual explicitness or religion have been contravened. This has brought some into conflict with local city councillors. There have been occasional performing groups that have deliberately tried to provoke controversy as a means of advertising their shows, and this has led to censorship of sexual explicitness in such shows. Organisers continued to defend the festival&#x27;s role as an open platform when they contacted controversial YouTuber Mark Meechan to request that he clarify the fact that he had not been banned, which ran contrary to the punch line of one of his jokes.

===Ticket prices===

In the mid-1990s, only the occasional top show charged £10 per seat, while the average price was £5–£7; in 2006, prices were frequently over £10, and reached £20 for the first time in 2006, for a one-hour show. Reasons people put forward for the increases include: increasing costs of hiring large venues, theatre licences and related costs—and the price of accommodation, which is expensive for performers as well as for audiences.

In the early 21st century, two organisations — The Free Fringe and The Laughing Horse Free Edinburgh Fringe Festival — introduced free entry shows that collect donations at the end of each performance. 22 shows came under this banner in 2005, growing rapidly to over 600 in 2011. There was also the &quot;pay what you can&quot; model of the Forest Fringe, and &quot;Pay What You Want&quot; as introduced by Bob Slayer&#x27;s Heroes of Fringe discussed above.

===Costs to performers===
Putting on a show at the Fringe with the big venues can be costly to performers, due to registration fees, venue hire, cost of accommodation, and travel to Edinburgh. In recent years, venue costs and the need for expensive marketing have been increasingly challenged by Free and other Independent venues. There is a change happening at the Fringe and performers can increasingly negotiate with the big venues. The festival is also a networking opportunity, training ground or springboard for future career advancement, and exciting and fun for performers as well as spectators.

===Costs to venues===
Putting on shows is costly to venues as well, due to theatre licence fees which by 2009 had risen 800% in the preceding three years, and were eight times as high as fees in English cities, starting at £824 for a venue of up to 200 people and rising to £2,472 for a venue of up to 5,000 people. These fees have been cited as punitive to smaller venues and site-specific performances by such figures as Julian Caddy, which, between 2003 and 2009, featured venues including Edinburgh College of Art, University of Edinburgh Medical School and site-specific shows in such venues as Inchcolm Island and a swimming pool at the Apex International Hotel.

===Pay-To-Play===
In 2012, there was criticism of the increasing commercialism of the Pay-To-Play fringe venues who charge acts to perform in advance of the Fringe. In many cases venue costs such as: venue rents / guarantees, compulsory marketing and various deductions mean that performers are being charged more than they can make back in ticket sales.

Stewart Lee stated in &quot;The Guardian&quot;: &quot;For decades, the Fringe has been a utopia for artists and performers – but now profit-obsessed promoters are tearing it to pieces.&quot; Heroes of Fringe (Previously called The Alternative Fringe) was set up by Bob Slayer as a statement against Pay-To-Play venues.

Some Fringe commentators agree that the Fringe will have to change and that the independent promoters are leading that change.

===Domination by comedy===
The comedy section has grown over recent decades to become the biggest section of the programme. The 2008 Fringe marked the first time that comedy has made up the largest category of entertainment. This has led to criticism that it has changed the nature of the Fringe, and separated it from its roots. Richard Demarco has complained of &quot;an infestation of stand-up comics... an epidemic for which there is no cure&quot;, which &quot;overwhelms the possibility of serious theatre&quot;. Others have commented that a large proportion of newer audiences are drawn almost exclusively to stand-up comics (particularly to television comedy stars in famous venues), and that they are starting to regard non-comedy events as &quot;peripheral&quot;.

=== Work and pay conditions ===
In July 2017, a campaign was set up to raise awareness of and challenge alleged poor working conditions during the Fringe. The campaign received support from the City of Edinburgh Council and Unite the Union, among others. In February 2019, Shona McCarthy, chief executive of the Fringe Society, stated that &quot;producers and promoters were being unfairly vilified [by the campaign]&quot;.

==Reviews and awards==

===Sources of reviews===
For many groups at the Fringe, the ultimate goal is a favourable review—which, apart from the welcome kudos, may help minimise financial losses from putting on the show.

Edinburgh based newspaper &quot;The Scotsman&quot; has been integral to the Fringe since the start, and has become known for its comprehensive festival coverage in August. Originally, it aimed to review every show on the Fringe. Now they are more selective, as there are simply too many shows to cover, although they do see almost every new play being staged as part of the Fringe&#x27;s theatre programme, because of their Fringe First awards. For many years, the Scotsman&#x27;s Arts Editor, Allen Wright was a familiar figure at the Fringe and today, the young critics&#x27; award is named in his honour.

Other Scottish media outlets that provide coverage include: &quot;The Herald&quot;, &quot;Scotland on Sunday&quot;, &quot;Sunday Herald&quot; and the Scottish edition of &quot;Metro&quot;. Scottish arts and entertainment magazines &quot;The List&quot;, &quot;The Skinny&quot; and &quot;Fest Magazine&quot; also provide extensive coverage.

From the 1990s onwards, Fringe-specific publications emerged. &quot;ThreeWeeks&quot; was founded in 1996, and &quot;Fest&quot; followed a few years later. After the turn of the millennium, these were joined by online publications, some of which specialised in the Fringe, some of which had a broader remit. These include &quot;Chortle&quot; (2000), &quot;Broadway Baby&quot; (2004), &quot;Fringe Review&quot; (2006), &quot;Fringe Guru&quot; (2007) and &quot;The Wee Review&quot; (2008 as &quot;TV Bomb&quot;). The latter two merged in 2019.

The now defunct Festival Media Network was founded in 2010 to act as a trade organisation for these independent media. Its members were &quot;Broadway Baby&quot;, &quot;Festival Previews&quot;, &quot;Fringe Guru&quot;, &quot;Fringe Review&quot;, &quot;Hairline&quot;, &quot;iFringe&quot;, &quot;ThreeWeeks&quot;, &quot;The Podcast Network&quot;, and &quot;WhatsOnStage&quot;.

In 2012, the most prolific reviewers were Broadway Baby which published over 1900 reviews, &quot;ThreeWeeks&quot;, which published 1000 reviews during August, and &quot;The Scotsman&quot; with 826 reviews. &quot;The List&quot; published 480 reviews. By 2019, &quot;The Scotsman&quot; was once again the most prolific reviewer, followed by &quot;The Wee Review&quot;.

Most of the London-based broadsheets also review, in particular &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Independent&quot;, while arts industry weekly &quot;The Stage&quot; publish a large number of Edinburgh reviews, especially of the drama programme.

Since 2010, the British Comedy Guide has collated comedy reviews from as many publications as possible. In 2018, it gathered over 4,700 reviews from 135 publications, up from 4,300 from 83 different publications in 2014.

===Awards===

There are a growing number of awards for Fringe shows, particularly in the field of drama:
* &quot;The Scotsman&quot; introduced the prestigious Fringe First awards in 1973. These awards were established by &quot;Scotsman&quot; arts editor Allen Wright to encourage new theatre writing, and are given only to new plays (or new translations), and several are awarded for each of the three weeks of the Fringe – usually by a celebrity at a prestigious ceremony.
* Herald Angels and Archangels are awarded by the team of arts writers of &quot;The Herald&quot; to performers or shows deemed worthy of recognition. Similar to Fringe Firsts, they are given each week of the Fringe.
* &quot;The Stage&quot; has awarded the Stage Awards for Acting Excellence since 1995. Around a dozen awards are given out each year, including a Special Award, given for the first time in 2014. Winners of the Special Award to date include Chris Goode (2014) and Pip Utton (2015).
*Total Theatre has presented its Total Theatre Awards for excellence in the field of physical and visual theatre since 1997. The categories under which these awards are given vary from year to year. A notable addition in 2007 was the inclusion of a Wild Card award chosen by the festival-going public.
* Amnesty International introduced the Amnesty Freedom of Expression Award in 2002.
* The Carol Tambor Best of Edinburgh Award for best drama was introduced in 2004. To be eligible for this award a show must have received a four or five star rating in &quot;The Scotsman&quot; and must not have previously played in New York, as the prize is to put the show on in New York.
* The &quot;ThreeWeeks&quot; Editors&#x27; Awards was introduced in 2005 and are given to the ten things that have most excited the &quot;ThreeWeeks&quot; editors each year.
* The Bobby was launched by &quot;Broadway Baby&quot; in 2011 and are given to the best shows of the festival as decided by the &quot;Broadway Baby&quot; judging panel. In 2012 a second type of Bobby was launched called the Technical Bobby, awarded for technical achievement at the Fringe, such as lighting or set design.
* &quot;The Edinburgh Musical Theatre Awards&quot; were introduced in 2007 by Musical Theatre Matters, to encourage the writing and production of new musicals on the Fringe.

* The Perrier Awards for Comedy came into existence in 1981 when the award was won by the Cambridge Footlights. (Two further award categories have since been added.) Perrier, the mineral water manufacturer ended its long association in 2006 and was succeeded by the Scottish-based company Intelligent Finance. In 2009 IF also withdrew and could not be replaced for 2010, so the awards were temporarily being funded by promoter Nica Burns and rebranded as the Edinburgh Comedy awards, or &quot;Eddies&quot;. As of 2024, DLT Entertainment sponsors The Donald and Eleanor Taffner Best Comedy Show and The DLT Entertainment Best Newcomer Award while The Victoria Wood Foundation sponsors The Panel Prize.
* The Malcolm Hardee Awards have three categories - Comic Originality, Cunning Stunt and Act Most Likely To Make A Million Quid They were presented originally for ten years, 2008–2017 and again from 2019, when they were taken over by the British Comedy Guide. An initial one-off Malcolm Hardee Award had been made at the Fringe in 2005, the year of Hardee&#x27;s death, to American musical comic Reggie Watts.
* Each year since 2009, the Funniest Joke of the Fringe is awarded, along with a list of the top 10. This award is currently sponsored by the TV channel Dave.
* The Brighton Fringe Award for Excellence has been awarded at Edinburgh Festival Fringe since 2011, in association with Richard Jordan and awarded at the Scotsman Awards ceremony.

==Statistics==
The first Fringe featured eight companies performing in five venues. By 1959, there were 19 companies; by 1969, 57; by 1979, 324. In 1981, there were 494, and the growth of the festival began to slow. But by 1999, there were over 600 companies giving 15,000 performances and in 2010, 1,900 giving 40,000.

Statistics for 2011 Edinburgh Festival Fringe concluded that it was the largest on record: there were over 40,000 performances of over 2,500 different shows in 258 venues. Ticket sales amounted to around 1.8 million. There are now 12 full-time members of staff.

Of the shows, theatre had been the largest genre in terms of number of shows until 2008, when it was overtaken by comedy, which has been the major growth area over the last 20 years. At the 2015 Fringe comedy was the biggest artform by number of shows, followed by theatre. The exact breakdown was: 34% comedy, 27% theatre, 14% music, 5% children&#x27;s shows, 4% each cabaret/variety, dance/circus/physical theatre, spoken word, events, 3% musicals/opera, 2% exhibitions.

The 2015 Fringe issued an estimated 2,298,090 tickets for 50,459 performances of 3,314 shows in 313 venues over 25 days; the 2016 Fringe issued an estimated 2,475,143 tickets for 50,266 performances of 3,269 shows; and the 2017 Fringe 2,696,884 tickets for 53,232 performances of 3,398 shows.

In addition to ticketed, programmed events, the Fringe Street Events is run each day of the festival, primarily on the Royal Mile and at the Mound Precinct.

<text>Daniel Jenkyn Jones (7 December 1912 – 23 April 1993) was a Welsh composer of classical music, who worked in Britain. He used both serial and tonal techniques. He is best known for his quartets and thirteen symphonies (some composed in his own system of &#x27;Complex Metres&#x27;) and for his song settings for Dylan Thomas&#x27;s play &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;.

==Biography==
Jones was born in Pembroke in south Wales. His father, Jenkyn Jones, was a composer and his mother a singer, and by the time he was nine years old the young Daniel had himself written several piano sonatas.

He attended the Bishop Gore School in Swansea (1924–1931), where his enthusiasm for literature led to a close friendship with the poet Dylan Thomas, and to his going on to study English literature at Swansea University. At this period Jones and Thomas were part of the informal group of aspiring artists who would meet at the Kardomah cafe in Castle Street, Swansea. Other members of the group were the poet Vernon Watkins and the painter Alfred Janes. In 1935 Jones left Swansea to study music at the Royal Academy of Music in London (1935–1938), where his teachers included Sir Henry Wood and Harry Farjeon. Winning the Mendelssohn Scholarship in 1935 allowed him to study in Czechoslovakia, France, the Netherlands and Germany, and to develop his skills as a linguist.

In 1937 Jones married Penelope Eunice Bedford, with whom he had three daughters. In the years leading up to the Second World War he composed his first large-scale orchestral works, &quot;Symphonic Prologue&quot; and &quot;Five Pieces for Orchestra&quot;, and developed his own compositional system of &#x27;Complex Metres&#x27;.

During the war, as a captain in the Intelligence Corps (1940–1946), he used his linguistic abilities at Bletchley Park codes centre as a cryptographer and a decoder of Russian, Romanian and Japanese texts. In 1944 Jones married his second wife, Irene Goodchild, with whom he had one son and one daughter.

After the war, Jones won increasing recognition as an innovative composer. In 1950 his &quot;Symphonic Prologue&quot; won the first prize of the Royal Philharmonic Society, and thereafter most of his compositions were written to commission – from the Festival of Britain, the Swansea Festival, the Royal National Eisteddfod, the BBC, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and the Llandaff Festival. Between 1945 and 1985 he composed his series of twelve symphonies, each centred on one semi-tone of the chromatic scale, and in 1992 his unnumbered &quot;Symphony in Memoriam John Fussell&quot; (his friend, the Director of the Swansea Festival). By 1993 he had composed eight string quartets, as well as works in many other genres, including the cantata, &quot;The Country Beyond the Stars&quot;, a setting of Henry Vaughan&#x27;s poem.

Jones enjoyed long friendships with several artists, among them Vernon Watkins, Ceri Richards and Grace Williams, and, most closely, Dylan Thomas. As well as composing song-settings for Thomas&#x27;s &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot; (1954) and dedicating his fourth symphony (1954) to Thomas&#x27;s memory, he edited collections of Thomas&#x27;s poetry and prose, and in 1977 published the memoir, &quot;My Friend Dylan Thomas&quot;.

In 1968 Jones was awarded an OBE.

He died in 1993 at his home, high up on the Gower Peninsula, 55 Southward Lane, Newton, Swansea, where he had composed &quot;in a room looking down on Oystermouth Castle and out over Swansea Bay&quot;.

His archive is held at the National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth. An oil portrait of Jones by Alfred Janes is held by the National Museum Cardiff; a photographic portrait by Bernard Mitchell (1967) is held by the National Portrait Gallery, London.

In 2008 the actor Adrian Metcalf and composer Rob Marshall drew on the compositions and writings of Jones and Thomas in their tribute, &quot;Warmley&quot; (named after Daniel Jones&#x27;s boyhood home).

==Composition==
By 1936, Jones had devised his own compositional system of Complex Metres, which was fully developed in his &quot;Sonata for Three Non-Chromatic Kettle-Drums&quot; (1947). In 1950, he described this system: &quot;The unifying element of fixed pattern is present, but the pattern itself is asymmetrical, therefore with a powerful means of satisfying structural requirements there would seem to be possible both a greater variety and a greater subtlety in the rhythm-metre relationship&quot;. Jones&#x27;s system was adapted in Germany by the composer Boris Blacher. For Jones himself his complex structures had always to be allied with emotive intention. As is the case with other composers who used both serial techniques and tonality, Jones&#x27;s music may for a time have seemed too advanced for traditionalists and too old-fashioned for the avant-garde.

<doc id="391980" wikidata="Q1890246" url="?curid=391980" title="Simian immunodeficiency virus">
<text>Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) is a species of retrovirus that cause persistent infections in at least 45 species of non-human primates. Based on analysis of strains found in four species of monkeys from Bioko Island, which was isolated from the mainland by rising sea levels about 11,000 years ago, it has been concluded that SIV has been present in monkeys and apes for at least 32,000 years, and probably much longer.

Virus strains from three of these primate species, SIVsmm in sooty mangabeys, SIVgor in gorillas and SIVcpz in chimpanzees, are believed to have crossed the species barrier into humans, resulting in HIV-2 and HIV-1 respectively, the two HIV viruses. The most likely route of transmission of HIV-1 to humans involves contact with the blood of chimps and gorillas that are often hunted for bushmeat in Africa. Four subtypes of HIV-1 (M, N, O, and P) likely arose through four separate transmissions of SIV to humans, and the resulting HIV-1 group M strain most commonly infects people worldwide. Therefore, it is theorized that SIV may have previously crossed the species barrier into human hosts multiple times throughout history, but it was not until recently, after the advent of modern transportation and global commuterism, that it finally took hold, spreading beyond localized decimations of a few individuals or single small tribal populations.

Unlike HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections in humans, SIV infections in their natural simian non-human hosts appear in many cases to be non-pathogenic due to evolutionary adaptation of the hosts to the virus. Extensive studies in sooty mangabeys have established that SIVsmm infection does not cause any disease in these primates, despite high levels of circulating virus. Regulation of the activity of the CCR5 coreceptor is one of the natural strategies to avoid disease in some natural host species of SIV.

Research on SIVcpz in chimpanzees suggests that infected chimpanzees experience an AIDS-like illness similar to HIV-1 infected humans. The later stages of SIVcpz infection in chimpanzees develop into an illness with characteristics that strongly resemble end-stage AIDS in humans.

==Taxonomy==
The simian (monkey-hosted) immunodeficiency viruses are a species of retrovirus in the Primate group of genus &quot;Lentivirus&quot; along with the human viruses HIV-1 and HIV-2 that cause AIDS, and a few other viruses that infect other primates. Related viruses in other groups in the genus infect other mammals like sheep and goats, horses, cattle, cats, and a few others. The genus is one of six genera in subfamily orthoretrovirinae, which together with genus &quot;Spumavirus&quot; form family retroviridae of all RNA retroviruses (RNA viruses which use a DNA intermediate).

The ICTVdB code of SIV is 61.0.6.5.003. Although HIV-1 and HIV-2 cladistically fall into SIV, ICTV considers them distinct species from ordinary, non-human-infecting SIV.

===Strains===

While human immunodeficiency virus has a limited number of subtypes, SIV is now known to infect a few dozen species of non-human primates, and distinct strains are often associated with each species, or with a set of closely related species. The thus far categorized ~40 strains are divided into five distinct groups and one subgroup:
* i) HIV-1, SIVcpz (chimpanzee), SIVgor (gorilla), SIVrcm (red-capped mangabey), SIVagi (agile mangabey), SIVmnd 2 (mandrill), SIVdrl (drill monkey)
* ii) HIV-2, SIVsmm (sooty mangabey), SIVmac (rhesus macaque), SIVmne (pig-tailed macaque), SIVstm (stump-tailed macaque)
* iii) SIVagm[generic] (African green monkeys): SIVsab, SIVver, SIVgri (grivet monkey), SIVtan (tantalus monkey)
* iv) SIVmnd 1 (mandrill), SIVlho (L&#x27;hoest&#x27;s monkey), SIVsun (sun-tailed monkey), SIVprg (Preuss&#x27;s guenon), SIVwrc (western red colobus), SIVolc (olive colobus), SIVkrc (Kibale red colobus), SIVtrc (Tshuapa red colobus)
* v) SIVsyk (Sykes&#x27; monkey), SIVdeb (De Brazza&#x27;s monkey), SIVden (Dent&#x27;s mona monkey), SIVwol (Wolf&#x27;s mona monkey), SIVgsn/SIVmon/SIVmus 1/SIVmus 2 clade, SIVtal (northern talapoin), SIVasc (red-tailed guenon), SIVbkm (black mangabey), SIVreg[formerly SIVery] (red-eared guenon), SIVblu (blue monkey)
** vi) SIVcol (colobus guereza), SIVkcol 1 (black-and-white colobus), SIVkcol 2, SIVblc (formerly SIVbcm) (black colobus),

In addition to the subgroups defined for extent SIVs, two endogenous SIVs are found in prosimian lemurs. These paleo-SIVs form a basal branch relative to extant SIVs.

==History==
Immunodeficiency resembling human AIDS was reported in captive monkeys in the United States beginning in 1983. SIV was isolated in 1985 from some of these animals, captive rhesus macaques suffering from simian AIDS (SAIDS). The discovery of SIV was made shortly after HIV-1 had been isolated as the cause of AIDS and led to the discovery of HIV-2 strains in West Africa. HIV-2 was more similar to the then-known SIV strains than to HIV-1, suggesting for the first time the simian origin of HIV. Further studies indicated that HIV-2 is derived from the SIVsmm strain found in sooty mangabeys, whereas HIV-1, the predominant virus found in humans, is derived from SIV strains infecting chimpanzees (SIVcpz).

It is not believed that chimpanzees are the original hosts of an independent lineage of SIV, but rather that SIVcpz is a relatively recent acquisition resulting from a recombination of SIVgsn (greater spot-nosed monkeys) and SIVrcm (red-capped mangabeys) within the host chimpanzee. It is known that chimpanzees hunt and consume these monkeys for food. In 2010, researchers reported that SIV had infected monkeys in Bioko for at least 32,000 years. Based on molecular clock analyses of sequences, it was previously thought by many that SIV infection in monkeys had happened over the past few hundred years. Scientists estimated that it would take a similar amount of time before humans would adapt naturally to HIV infection in the way monkeys in Africa have adapted to SIV and not suffer any harm from the infection.

In 2008, discovery of an endogenous lentivirus in a prosimian (proto-monkey) primate, the gray mouse lemur native to Madagascar, pushed the origin of SIV-like lentivirus infections in primates back to at least 14 Ma, the last time there was intermingling of mammals between the island of Madagascar and the African mainland, if the infection is attributed to horizontal transmission between homologous hosts. If the virus was coevolved with the host, rather than acquired, that potentially pushes the date of the endogenous event back to approx. 85 Ma, the split between the lemur-like and monkey-like primate lineages. That date barely antedates the emergence of the primates 87.7 Ma.

==Virology==
===Structure and genome===
The SIV virion is a spherical to pleomorphic glycoprotein envelope 110-120 nm across enclosing a 110x50nm truncated cone or wedge-shaped (occasionally rod) capsid containing a dimeric pair of positive-sense single-stranded RNA genomes.

====Genome====

====Proteome====

* genes: &quot;env&quot;, &quot;gag&quot;, &quot;pol&quot;, &quot;tat&quot;, &quot;rev&quot;, &quot;nef&quot;, &quot;vpr&quot;, &quot;vif&quot;, &quot;vpu/vpx&quot;
* Structural proteins (envelope): SU, TM(gag): MA, CA, NC
* Enzymes: RT, PR, IN
* Gene regulators: Tat, Rev
* Accessory proteins: Nef, Vpr, Vpx, Vif

===Tropism===
Differences in species specificity of SIV and related retroviruses may be partly explained by variants of the protein TRIM5α in humans and non-human primate species. This intracellular protein recognizes the capsid of various retroviruses and blocks their reproduction. Other proteins, such as APOBEC3G/3F, which exerts antiretroviral immune activity, may also be important in restricting cross-species transmission.

===Quasispecies===
The speed and transcription inaccuracies of RNA viruses give rise to antigenically distinct varieties in a single host animal. These &quot;quasispecies&quot; do not necessarily give rise to population-wide new organisms. The rate of proliferation of quasispecies has significant implication for host immune control, and therefore virulence of the organism.

==Pathogenesis==

SIV pathogenesis encompasses both pathogenic and non-pathogenic SIV infections. SIV infection of non-human primates (NHPs) invariably results in persistent infection, but rarely acute disease. Pathogenic infection is typified by Rhesus macaques infected with SIV strains derived from sooty mangabeys. Disease progression to AIDS occurs within a period of months to years, depending upon the SIV strain used. Non-pathogenic infection is typified by African NHPs naturally infected with SIV. These animals rarely progress to AIDS despite maintaining viral loads that are equivalent to SIV viral loads in pathogenic infections. It is postulated that AIDS-like disease in African NHPs represents horizontal transmission of the virus from one or more homologous species in the recent evolutionary past, before equilibrium of co-adaptation has occurred.

== SIV/HIV infection similarities and differences ==
The similarities of the two types of virus infections:
* high level of virus replication during primary infection (0–180 days)
* high level of CD4+ T-cell loss (0–180 days)
* restricted role of humoral immune response

The differences (what happens in nonhuman primates):
* lower level of CCR5+ T-cells
* stable level of viral replication (180 days-years)
* restoration of CD4+ T-cells
* early cytokine production (0–10 days after infection)
* normal level of immune activation
* high level of functional immune cells
* establishment of anti-inflammatory milieu

==Epidemiology==
Beatrice Hahn of the University of Pennsylvania and a team of researchers in 2009 found that chimpanzees do die from simian AIDS in the wild and that the AIDS outbreak in Africa has contributed to the decline of chimpanzee populations. Testing wild chimpanzees, researchers detected organ and tissue damage similar to late-stage human AIDS. The infected chimpanzees had a 10 to 16 times greater risk of dying than uninfected ones; infected females were less likely to give birth, could pass the virus to their infants, and had a higher infant mortality rate than uninfected females. Bonobos appear to avoid simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and its effects, though it is not known why.

African green monkeys (also called vervets, genus Chlorocebus) in African populations are heavily infected with SIVagm, while the virus is absent in the founder isolate vervet populations in the Caribbean. The prevalence of SIV infection in African populations ranges 78-90% in adult females and 36-57% in adult males, while SIV infection is rare in immature individuals. SIV infected vervets in the wild do not develop chronic immune activation or microbial translocation (assessed by sCD14 as a surrogate biomarker). During natural SIV infection, the gut microbiome showed a significant increase in microbial diversity, a decrease in Proteobacteria/Succinivibrio and an increase of Veillonella, a decrease in genes involved in pathways of microbial invasion, and partial reversibility of acute infection-related shifts in microbial abundance. The pattern of natural selection in the monkey genome in genes involved in HIV responses and those regulated in response to experimental SIV infection in monkeys, but not macaques, suggests a natural adaptation to SIV in Chlorocebus monkeys in Africa.

==Vaccine research==
In 2012, researchers reported that initial infection of rhesus monkeys by neutralization-resistant SIV strains could be partially prevented through use of an anti-SIVSME543 vaccine obligately including Env protein antigens.

In 2013, a study by a group of authors reported on successful testing of a vaccine containing SIV protein-expressing rhesus cytomegalovirus vector. Approximately 50% of vaccinated rhesus macaques manifested durable, aviraemic control of infection with the highly pathogenic strain SIVmac239.

<text>Jeremy James Hardy (17 July 1961 – 1 February 2019) was an English comedian. Born and raised in Hampshire, Hardy studied at the University of Southampton and began his stand-up career in the 1980s, going on to win the Perrier Comedy Award at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 1988. He is best known for his appearances on radio panel shows such as the &quot;News Quiz&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot;.

==Early life==
Hardy was born in Farnborough, Hampshire on 17 July 1961, the fifth and youngest child of rocket scientist Donald D. Hardy (1925–2016) and Sheila Stagg (1924–2012). He attended Farnham College and studied modern history and politics at the University of Southampton. He subsequently failed to obtain a place on a journalism course, and considered becoming an actor or poet.

==Career==
Hardy started scriptwriting before turning to stand-up comedy in London in the early 1980s, funded in part by the Enterprise Allowance Scheme. He won the Perrier Comedy Award in 1988 at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.

He made his television debut in the late 1980s, featuring regularly as Jeremy the boom operator in the Rory Bremner-led comedy show &quot;Now – Something Else&quot; on BBC Two, along with guest appearances on programmes including the BBC One talk show &quot;Wogan&quot;. He went on to feature in various comedy shows including &quot;Blackadder Goes Forth&quot; (1989), and presented a television documentary about the political background to the English Civil War as well as an edition of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; in 1996. He was one of the two team captains on the BBC Two game show &quot;If I Ruled the World&quot; that ran for two series in 1998–1999. Kit Hollerbach featured alongside him in the BBC radio sitcoms &quot;Unnatural Acts&quot; and &quot;At Home with the Hardys&quot;.

Hardy worked extensively on BBC Radio 4, particularly on &quot;The News Quiz&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot; and his long-running series of monologues &quot;Jeremy Hardy Speaks to the Nation&quot;. His excruciatingly off-key singing was a long-running joke on the radio panel show &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot; — on which he appeared regularly — as well as the spin-off radio series &quot;You&#x27;ll Have Had Your Tea: The Doings of Hamish and Dougal&quot;. He appeared in the Radio 4 sitcom &quot;Linda Smith&#x27;s A Brief History of Timewasting&quot;, and he also appeared as a panellist on the first and second series of &quot;QI&quot;. His experiences in Palestine during the Israeli army incursions of 2002 became the subject of a feature documentary &quot;Jeremy Hardy vs. the Israeli Army&quot; (2003), directed by Leila Sansour. A four-episode series entitled &quot;Jeremy Hardy Feels It&quot; was broadcast on Radio 4 in December 2017 to January 2018.

Hardy wrote a regular column for &quot;The Guardian&quot; until 2001. He then wrote a column in the &quot;London Evening Standard&quot;″s magazine. His first book, &quot;When Did You Last See Your Father&quot;, was published by Methuen in 1992. &quot;My Family and Other Strangers&quot;, based on his research into his family history, was published by Ebury Press on 4 March 2010.

An anthology of Hardy&#x27;s writing, &quot;Jeremy Hardy Speaks Volumes&quot;, was published in February 2020. It was edited by his wife Katie Barlow and his long-time radio producer David Tyler.

==Political views==
Hardy was a committed socialist, and a supporter of the Labour Party. He performed at Labour Party rallies and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn considered him a &quot;dear, lifelong friend&quot;. His comedy embodied his radical politics, including outspoken opposition to former Labour leader Tony Blair – he was conflicted during the Blair and Gordon Brown leadership period, quoted as saying &quot;To me, voting Labour is like wiping your bottom: I can&#x27;t say I like doing it but you&#x27;ve got to – because you&#x27;re in a worse mess if you don&#x27;t.&quot; Hardy was banned from voting in Labour internal elections in 2015 because he had also raised funds for the Green Party. He strongly supported Corbyn in the leadership election of 2015. He was also an outspoken opponent of the Trident programme.

Hardy supported Irish nationalist Róisín McAliskey, the then-pregnant daughter of Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, when the former was accused of involvement in an IRA mortar attack in Germany, and put up part of the bail money to free her. He also supported the campaign to free Danny McNamee, whose conviction for involvement in the Provisional Irish Republican Army&#x27;s (IRA) Hyde Park bombing on 20 July 1982 was quashed in 1999, after several years of prison.

In an edition of &quot;Jeremy Hardy Speaks to the Nation&quot; on BBC Radio 4 &quot;How to be Afraid&quot;, broadcast in September 2004, Hardy said during one of his comedy routines that &quot;if you just took everyone in the BNP and everyone who votes for them and shot them in the back of the head, there would be a brighter future for us all.&quot; This sparked complaints and caused Burnley Borough Council to cancel a show in the town over fears that it could be &quot;disruptive&quot; in an area with a recent history of racial tension.

In September 2016 Hardy performed at the Keep Corbyn rally in Brighton in support of Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s campaign in the Labour Party leadership election. On Hardy&#x27;s death, Corbyn said &quot;He always gave his all for everyone else and the campaigns for social justice.&quot;

==Personal life and death==
In 1986 Hardy married the actress and comedian Kit Hollerbach and in 1990 they adopted a daughter. He later married the photographer and filmmaker Katie Barlow.

Hardy was a close friend of the comedian Linda Smith; when she died of ovarian cancer on 27 February 2006 he wrote about her in many media outlets and wrote her obituary in &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

Hardy died at St Christopher’s Hospice in Sydenham, London of cancer on 1 February 2019, at the age of 57. Julia McKenzie, the head of Radio team at BBC Studios, said of Hardy &quot;I will remember him as someone who could convulse an audience with laughter at a comic image whilst at the same time making a point of substance that reverberated on a much deeper level and spoke to his principles and unflinching concern for the less fortunate.&quot; Miles Jupp, then-host of &quot;The News Quiz&quot; and a longtime friend, wrote his obituary in &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

== Collections ==
The University of Kent holds a collection of Hardy&#x27;s work as part of the British Stand-Up Comedy Archive. The archive is composed of audio-visual material from Hardy&#x27;s career, including recordings of live performances.

<text>Histoplasmosis is a fungal infection caused by &quot;Histoplasma capsulatum&quot;. Symptoms of this infection vary greatly, but the disease affects primarily the lungs. Occasionally, other organs are affected; called disseminated histoplasmosis, it can be fatal if left untreated.

&quot;H. capsulatum&quot; is found in soil, often associated with decaying bat guano or bird droppings. Disruption of soil from excavation or construction releases infectious spores that can be inhaled by humans. &quot;H. capsulatum&quot; has a one to two week incubation period within human lungs before symptoms arise. The disease is common among AIDS patients due to their immunosuppression.

From 1938 to 2013 in the US, 105 outbreaks were reported in a total of 26 states plus Puerto Rico. In 1978 to 1979 during a large urban outbreak in which 100,000 people were exposed to the fungus in Indianapolis, victims had pericarditis, rheumatological syndromes, esophageal and vocal cord ulcers, parotitis, adrenal insufficiency, uveitis, fibrosing mediastinitis, interstitial nephritis, intestinal lymphangiectasia, and epididymitis. Histoplasmosis mimics colds, pneumonia, and the flu, and can be shed by bats in their feces.

==Signs and symptoms==

If symptoms of histoplasmosis infection occur, they start within 3 to 17 days after exposure; the typical time is 12–14 days. Most affected individuals have clinically silent manifestations and show no apparent ill effects. The acute phase of histoplasmosis is characterized by nonspecific respiratory symptoms, often cough or flu-like. Chest X-ray findings are normal in 40–70% of cases. Chronic histoplasmosis cases can resemble tuberculosis; disseminated histoplasmosis affects multiple organ systems and is fatal unless treated.

While histoplasmosis is the most common cause of mediastinitis, this remains a relatively rare disease. Severe infections can cause hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and adrenal enlargement. Lesions often left calcification nodules as they are healed.

Presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome causes chorioretinitis, where the choroid and retina of the eyes are scarred, resulting in a loss of vision not unlike macular degeneration. Despite its name, the relationship to &quot;Histoplasma&quot; is controversial. Distinct from POHS, acute ocular histoplasmosis may rarely occur in immunodeficiency.

===Complications===
In absence of proper treatment and especially in immunocompromised individuals, complications can arise. These include recurrent pneumonia, respiratory failure, fibrosing mediastinitis, superior vena cava syndrome, pulmonary vessel obstruction, and progressive fibrosis of lymph nodes. Fibrosing mediastinitis is a serious complication and can be fatal. Smokers with structural lung disease have higher probability of developing chronic cavitary histoplasmosis.

After healing of lesions, hard, calcified lymph nodes can erode the walls of the airway, causing hemoptysis.

==Mechanisms==
&quot;H. capsulatum&quot; grows in soil and material contaminated with bird or bat droppings (guano). The fungus has been found in poultry-house litter, caves, areas harboring bats, and bird roosts (particularly those of starlings). The fungus is thermally dimorphic; in the environment, it grows as a brownish mycelium, and at body temperature (37 °C in humans), it morphs into a yeast. Histoplasmosis is not contagious but is contracted by inhalation of the spores from disturbed soil or guano. The inoculum is represented principally by microconidia. These are inhaled and reach the alveoli. In the alveoli, macrophages ingest these microconidia. They survive inside the phagosome. As the fungus is thermally dimorphic, these microconidia are transformed into yeast. They grow and multiply inside the phagosome. The macrophages travel in lymphatic circulation and can spread the disease to different organs.

Within the phagosome, the fungus has an absolute requirement for thiamine. Cell-mediated immunity for histoplasmosis develops within 2 weeks. If the patient has strong cellular immunity, macrophages, epithelial cells, and lymphocytes surround the organisms and contain them, and eventually calcify. In immunocompromised individuals, the organisms disseminate to different organs such as bone, spleen, liver, adrenal glands, and mucocutaneous membranes, resulting in progressive disseminated histoplasmosis. Chronic lung disease can manifest.

==Diagnosis==

Clinically, a wide spectrum of disease manifestations occurs, making diagnosis somewhat difficult. More severe forms include the chronic pulmonary form, often occurring in the presence of underlying pulmonary disease, and a disseminated form, which is characterized by the progressive spread of infection to extrapulmonary sites. Oral manifestations have been reported as the main complaint of the disseminated forms, leading the patient to seek treatment, whereas pulmonary symptoms in disseminated disease may be mild or even misinterpreted as flu. Histoplasmosis can be diagnosed by samples containing the fungus taken from sputum (via bronchoalveolar lavage), blood, or infected organs. It can also be diagnosed by detection of antigens in blood or urine samples by ELISA or polymerase chain reaction. Antigens can cross-react with antigens of African histoplasmosis (caused by &quot;Histoplasma duboisii&quot;), blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, paracoccidioidomycosis, and talaromycosis infection. Histoplasmosis can also be diagnosed by a test for antibodies against &quot;Histoplasma&quot; in the blood. &quot;Histoplasma&quot; skin tests indicate whether persons have been exposed, but do not indicate whether they have the disease. Formal histoplasmosis diagnoses are often confirmed only by culturing the fungus directly. Sabouraud agar is one agar growth medium on which the fungus can be cultured. Cutaneous manifestations of disseminated disease are diverse and often present as a nondescript rash with systemic complaints. Diagnosis is best established by urine antigen testing, as blood cultures may take up to 6 weeks for diagnostic growth to occur and serum antigen testing often comes back with a false negative before 4 weeks of disseminated infection.

=== Types ===
Histoplasmosis may be divided into these types:

:* Primary pulmonary histoplasmosis
:* Progressive disseminated histoplasmosis
:* Primary cutaneous histoplasmosis
:* African histoplasmosis

==Prevention==
Testing or decontaminating most sites that may be contaminated with &quot;H. capsulatum&quot; is impractical, but the sources below list environments where histoplasmosis is common, and precautions to reduce a person&#x27;s risk of exposure, in the three parts of the world where the disease is prevalent. Precautions common to all geographical locations would be to avoid accumulations of bird or bat droppings.

The US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health provides information on work practices and personal protective equipment that may reduce the risk of infection.

A review paper includes information on locations in which &quot;Histoplasma&quot; has been found in Africa (in chicken runs, on bats, in the caves bats inhabit, and in soil), and a thorough reference list including English, French, and Spanish language references.

==Treatment==
In the majority of immunocompetent individuals, histoplasmosis resolves without any treatment. Antifungal medications are used to treat severe cases of acute histoplasmosis and all cases of chronic and disseminated disease. Typical treatment of severe disease first involves treatment with amphotericin B, followed by oral itraconazole.

Liposomal preparations of amphotericin B are more effective than deoxycholate preparations. The liposomal preparation is preferred in patients who might be at risk of nephrotoxicity, although all preparations of amphotericin B have risk of nephrotoxicity. Individuals taking amphotericin B are monitored for renal function. Liposomal amphotericin B is better at treating people with progressive disseminated Histoplasmosis and underlying HIV when compared to deoxycholate amphotericin B. Meanwhile, fluconazole performs poorly when compared to other azoles.

Treatment with itraconazole must continue for at least a year in severe cases, while in acute pulmonary Histoplasmosis, 6 to 12 weeks treatment is sufficient. Alternatives to itraconazole are posaconazole, voriconazole, and fluconazole. Individuals taking itraconazole are monitored for hepatic function.

== Prognosis ==
About 90% of patients with normal immune systems regain health without any intervention. Less than 5% need serious treatments.

==Epidemiology==
&quot;H. capsulatum&quot; is found throughout the world. It is endemic in certain areas of the United States, particularly in states bordering the Ohio River valley and the lower Mississippi River. The humidity and acidity patterns of soil are associated with endemicity. Bird and bat droppings in soil promote the growth of &quot;Histoplasma&quot;. Contact with such soil aerosolizes the microconidia, which can infect humans. It is also common in caves in Southern and East Africa. Positive histoplasmin skin tests occur in as many as 90% of the people living in areas where &quot;H. capsulatum&quot; is common, such as the eastern and central United States.

In Canada, the St. Lawrence River Valley is the site of the most frequent infections, with 20–30% of the population testing positive. A review of reported cases in 2018 showed disease presence throughout Southeast Asia, In India, the Gangetic West Bengal is the site of most frequent infections, with 9.4% of the population testing positive. &quot;H. c. capsulatum&quot; was isolated from the local soil proving endemicity of histoplasmosis in West Bengal.

In non-endemic countries, 40-50% of histoplasmosis cases are diagnosed in immunocompromised patients (HIV/AIDS, transplanted patients, cancer patients).

== Histoplasmosis in workplaces ==
&quot;H. capsulatum&quot; is commonly found across the United States. The fungus can grow in any materials corrupted with bird and bat droppings, but particularly manifests in soils. Histoplasma can present itself as an occupational hazard through causation of the infection Histoplasmosis. Workers in a variety of fields can be exposed to the fungus as spores can be released into the air through any activities which disturb soil. Due to this, occupations at a higher risk for exposure include construction and demolition, landscaping, mining, quarrying, oil and gas extraction, agriculture and forestry industries. Common symptoms in workers are similar to the ones from the exposed general public, such as nonspecific respiratory symptoms like a cough. However, workplace exposures tend to lead to larger outbreaks than non-occupational histoplasmosis, and scientific reviews have shown that occupational histoplasmosis accounts for approximately one third of all documented outbreaks. Though the disease is usually not severe, there have been instances of outbreaks among workers leading to death.

These occurrences emphasize the importance of protective measures for workers. The CDC advises that those who work in potentially hazardous environments reduce their exposure as much as possible following the hierarchy of hazard controls. They recommend that any build up of bird and bat droppings should be avoided if possible, but if it is unpreventable various engineering, administrative controls and personal protective equipment can be implemented in the workplace. The CDC also suggests that workplaces should be responsible for administrative controls such as developing a safety plan, posting notice of the risk of exposure, disposing of any potentially contaminated materials, and providing proper education on the dangers associated with histoplasma. Adequate personal protective equipment includes a respirator, hooded coveralls, shoe coverings, gloves, and eye protection.

==History==
&quot;Histoplasma&quot; was discovered in 1906 by Samuel T. Darling, but only in the 1930s was it discovered to be a widespread infection. Before then, many cases of histoplasmosis were mistakenly attributed to tuberculosis, and patients were mistakenly admitted to tuberculosis sanatoria. Some patients contracted tuberculosis in these sanatoriums.

==Society and culture==
* Francis D. Culkin Member of the U.S. House of Representatives from New York&#x27;s 32nd district, died from the disease on August 4, 1943.
* Johnny Cash included a reference to the disease, even correctly noting its source in bird droppings, in the song &quot;Beans for Breakfast&quot;.
* Bob Dylan was hospitalized due to histoplasmosis in 1997, causing the cancellation of concerts in the United Kingdom and Switzerland.
* In episode 21 of season three of the television series &quot;House M.D.&quot;, a patient was diagnosed with histoplasmosis.
* In episode 4 of season one of the television series &quot;New Amsterdam&quot;, a critically ill patient was diagnosed with histoplasmosis which he was denying to visit hospital because he was homeless.
* In episode five of season one of the television series &quot;Dexter&quot;, Vince Masuka gets worried about getting histoplasmosis from the dust in the air and the hair of the rats.
* In episode 5 of season 5 of &quot;Monsters Inside Me&quot;, &quot;There&#x27;s a Worm Crawling In My What?&quot; (aired November 13, 2014), a video game programmer, Cody Fry was infected with the disease. He survived his initial bout with disease up to the premiere of the episode, but unfortunately, would die from the illness less than a year after the episode premiered, on October 23, 2015.
* In the BBC drama Call The Midwife&#x27;s 9th season, a character is diagnosed with the disease after initial confusion regarding whether his symptoms were more indicative of tuberculosis. He contracts it from the droppings of pet pigeons he keeps in his home.

<text>Austin Steward (c. 1793 – February 15, 1869) was an African-American abolitionist and author. He was born a slave in Virginia then moved at age 7 with the Helm household to New York State in 1800. The household settled in the town of Bath, New York, in 1803. He escaped slavery at about age 21, settling in Rochester, New York, and then British North America. His autobiography, &quot;Twenty-Two Years a Slave&quot;, was published in 1857.

Austin Steward was born in Prince William County, Virginia, in about 1793 to Robert and Susan Steward. He had a sister, Mary. They were enslaved by planter Capt. William Helm. Steward was seven years old when he was assigned his first duties as a house servant to Helm. Steward taught himself to read in secrecy, but he was discovered and severely beaten.

Helm moved his family and the Stewards to New York in 1800. Although it was a free state, it had a gradual abolition approach and slavery was still permitted. After continued abuse when hired out to a brutal taskmaster, Steward determined to escape, which he did in 1814 at about age 21.

Steward made his way to Rochester, New York. Initially he worked for Darius Comstock, president of the Manumission Society, and took classes to increase his education. Before his escape, he had consulted about pursuing legal manumission but was discouraged that it would take too long. In 1817 he started what became a successful business in Rochester, opening his own meat market and general store. He gradually acquired considerable property. According to his autobiography, he gave a speech on July 5, 1827, the celebration of final emancipation of slaves in New York, and gained press coverage of the event.

In 1831, Steward went to British North America, devoting himself to aiding fugitive slaves. He was interested in a new settlement, the Wilberforce Colony (named in honor of William Wilberforce), located north of present-day London, Ontario. The Colony had been founded in 1829 by African-Americans fleeing the Ohio Black Codes, as well as rioting in Cincinnati. Almost immediately upon his arrival, Steward was named president of the Colony&#x27;s board of managers. Wilberforce Colony struggled, however, with internal divisions and financial difficulties, and he eventually returned, nearly destitute, to Rochester in 1837.

His memoir, &quot;Twenty-Two Years a Slave, and Forty Years a Freeman&quot;, was published by William Alling in 1857. It is considered a slave narrative, detailing his early life of enslavement and escape, as well as his years of freedom and work at Wilberforce Colony. In the years before the American Civil War, such books sometimes became bestsellers in the North, and abolitionists drew from them in their arguments against the cruelties of slavery.

Steward and his wife Patience had a daughter Barbara Ann Steward, who died of typhoid in 1861.

Steward died of typhoid fever on February 15, 1869, and was buried in Canandaigua, New York.

*&quot;Dehwa Daimana&quot;: Birthday of John the Baptist.
*&quot;Kanshiy u-Zahly&quot;: New Year&#x27;s Eve
*&quot;Dehwa Rabba&quot;: New Year&#x27;s Day
*&quot;Dehwa d-Šišlam Rabba&quot; () or &quot;Nauruz Zūṭa&quot; (): Little New Year, on the 6th-7th days of Daula, corresponding to Epiphany in Christianity. The Night of Power takes place on the night of the 6th day (similar to Qadr Night), during which the heavenly gates of Abatur are open to the faithful. Priests visit Mandaean households and give them myrtle wreaths to hang on their houses for the rest of the year to protect against evil. The households also donate alms to the priests.
*&quot;Dehwa Hanina&quot; () or &quot;Dehwa Ṭurma&quot;: the Little Feast, begins on the 18th day of Taura. This holiday commemorates the ascension of Hibil Ziwa from the underworld to the Lightworld. The feast lasts for three days. On the first day, Mandaean families visit each other and have a special breakfast of rice, yogurt, and dates. Baptisms are performed, and the dead are commemorated with &quot;lofani&quot; (ritual meals).
*&quot;Ead Fel&quot;: (Memorial Day) Crushed dates with roasted sesame seeds are eaten.
*&quot;Ashoriya&quot; (&quot;Ashuriyah&quot;): Day of remembrance for the drowned people of Noah&#x27;s flood. Grains and cereals are eaten. Mandaeans believe that on this day, Noah and his son Sam made the food of forgiveness of sins for the souls of those who died in the flood. The food of forgiveness consists of seven grains representing the seven days of the week, and from the grounding of these seven grains came the name Abu Al-Harees. (See Ashure or Noah&#x27;s pudding)
;Islam
* Ramadan: During this holy time, the ninth month of the Islamic calendar year, Muslims do not eat, drink, or smoke from sunrise to sunset for an entire month. Instead, they spend their days in worship, praying in mosques. At the end of Ramadan, people celebrate with a festival known as Eid al-Fitr. 
* Eid al-Fitr is the earlier of the two official holidays celebrated within Islam (the other being Eid al-Adha). The religious holiday is celebrated by Muslims worldwide because it marks the end of the month-long dawn-to-sunset fasting of Ramadan. The day is also called Lesser Eid, or simply Eid
* Eid al-Adha is the latter of the two official holidays celebrated within Islam (the other being Eid al-Fitr). The day is also sometimes called Big Eid or the Greater Eid.
* Islamic New Year, also called the Hijri New Year or Arabic New Year, is the day that marks the beginning of a new lunar Hijri year, and is the day on which the year count is incremented. 
* Ashura is an Islamic holiday that occurs on the tenth day of Muharram, the first month in the Islamic lunar calendar. 
* Mawlid Mawlid an-Nabi ash-Sharif or Eid Milad un Nabi is the observance of the birthday of the Islamic prophet Muhammad[6] which is commemorated in Rabi&#x27; al-awwal, the third month in the Islamic calendar.
* Isra and Mi&#x27;raj are the two parts of a Night Journey that, according to Islam, the Islamic prophet Muhammad (570–632) took during a single night around the year 621. The journey and ascent are marked as one of the most celebrated dates in the Islamic calendar.
* Mid-Sha&#x27;ban also Bara&#x27;at Night, is a Muslim holiday observed by Muslim communities on the night between 14 and 15 Sha&#x27;ban (the same night as Shab-e-barat)
* Day of Arafah is an Islamic holiday that falls on the 9th day of Dhu al-Hijjah of the lunar Islamic Calendar. It is the holiest day in the Islamic calendar (the holiest night being The Night of Power), the second day of the Hajj pilgrimage, and the day after is the first day of the major Islamic holiday of Eid al-Adha.
;Judaism

* Pesach: &quot;late March or in April&quot; Festival celebrating the Hebrews captivity in Egypt at the time when God commanded Moses to ask for the Hebrew people to be released. As a result of being denied, 10 plagues came upon Egypt. One being the Angel of death coming and the first born son of each home dying. But God commanded the Hebrews to apply lambs blood to the door posts as a sign for the Angel to pass that house.

;Slavic

* Maslenitsa in Slavic mythology, a celebration of the imminent end of the winter
;Christian
* Shrove Tuesday: &quot;one day before Ash Wednesday, 47 days before Easter&quot;
* Easter: &quot; the first Sunday after the Paschal full moon/the first full moon after the vernal equinox&quot;—shortly after Passover; typically in April, but sometimes in March or May
* Good Friday: &quot;Good Friday is a Christian religious holiday commemorating the crucifixion of Jesus Christ and his death at Calvary. The holiday is observed during Holy Week as part of the Paschal Triduum on the Friday preceding Easter Sunday, and may coincide with the Jewish observance of Passover. It is also known as Holy Friday, Great Friday, Black Friday, or Easter Friday, though the last term properly refers to the Friday in Easter week.&quot;
* Advent: Advent is the preparation season for Christmas, when the first candle is lit on the Advent wreath and decorations go up. It starts on the first of four Sundays that precede Christmas. It can be as early as 27 November or as late as 3 December, depending on which day of the week Christmas falls. It will start on 1 December if Christmas is on a Wednesday.
;Pastafarian
* Holiday: Around the time of Christmas, Hanukkah and Kwanzaa (generally known as the Christmas and holiday season), Pastafarians celebrate a vaguely defined holiday named &quot;Holiday&quot;. Holiday does not take place on a specific date so much as it is the Holiday season itself. There are no specific requirements for Holiday, and Pastafarians celebrate Holiday however they please. They also celebrate Pastover and Ramendan.
;Religion

Many religions whose holidays were formulated before the worldwide spread of the Gregorian calendar have been assigned to dates either according to their own internal religious calendar, or moon cycles, or otherwise. Even within Christianity, Easter is a movable feast and Christmas is celebrated according to the older Julian calendar instead of the Gregorian by some sects of the religion.

<text>Encephalopathy (; ) means any disorder or disease of the brain, especially chronic degenerative conditions. In modern usage, encephalopathy does not refer to a single disease, but rather to a syndrome of overall brain dysfunction; this syndrome has many possible organic and inorganic causes.

== Types==
There are many types of encephalopathy. Some examples include:
* Mitochondrial encephalopathy: Metabolic disorder caused by dysfunction of mitochondrial DNA. Can affect many body systems, particularly the brain and nervous system.
* Acute necrotizing encephalopathy, rare disease that occurs following a viral infection.
* Glycine encephalopathy: A genetic metabolic disorder involving excess production of glycine.
* Hepatic encephalopathy: Arising from advanced cirrhosis of the liver.
* Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy: Permanent or transitory encephalopathy arising from severely reduced oxygen delivery to the brain.
* Static encephalopathy: Unchanging, or permanent, brain damage, usually caused by prenatal exposure to ethanol.
* Uremic encephalopathy: Arising from high levels of toxins normally cleared by the kidneys—rare where dialysis is readily available.
* Wernicke&#x27;s encephalopathy: Arising from thiamine (B1) deficiency, usually in the setting of alcoholism.
* Hashimoto&#x27;s encephalopathy: Arising from an auto-immune disorder.
* Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis: An auto-immune encephalitis.
* Hyperammonemia: A condition caused by high levels of ammonia, which is due to inborn errors of metabolism (including urea cycle disorder or multiple carboxylase deficiency), a diet with excessive levels of protein, deficiencies of specific nutrients such as arginine or biotin, or organ failure.
* Hypertensive encephalopathy: Arising from acutely increased blood pressure.
* Chronic traumatic encephalopathy: A progressive degenerative disease associated with repeated head trauma, often linked to contact sports.
* Lyme encephalopathy: Arising from Lyme disease bacteria, including &quot;Borrelia burgdorferi&quot;.
* Toxic encephalopathy: A form of encephalopathy caused by chemicals and prescription drugs, often resulting in permanent brain damage.
* Toxic-metabolic encephalopathy: A catch-all for brain dysfunction caused by infection, organ failure, or intoxication.
* Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy: A collection of diseases all caused by prions, and characterized by &quot;spongy&quot; brain tissue (riddled with holes), impaired locomotion or coordination, and a 100% mortality rate. Includes bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease), scrapie, and kuru among others.
* Neonatal encephalopathy (hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy): An obstetric form, often occurring due to lack of oxygen in bloodflow to brain-tissue of the fetus during labour or delivery.
* Salmonella encephalopathy: A form of encephalopathy caused by food poisoning (especially out of peanuts and rotten meat) often resulting in permanent brain damage and nervous system disorders.
* Encephalomyopathy: A combination of encephalopathy and myopathy. Causes may include mitochondrial disease (particularly MELAS) or chronic hypophosphatemia, as may occur in cystinosis.
* Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD; transmissible spongiform encephalopathy).
* Aicardi–Goutières syndrome, a hereditary disease caused by mutations in the &quot;TREX1, RNASEH2B, RNASEH2C, RNASEH2A, ADAR1, SAMHD1, IFIH1, LSM11&quot;, or &quot;RNU7-1&quot; gene.
* Infectious disease-associated encephalopathy (an umbrella term for encephalopathy related to infectious disease, not necessarily directly infecting the central nervous system)
* HIV encephalopathy (encephalopathy associated with HIV infection and AIDS, characterized by atrophy and ill-defined white matter hyperintensity).
* Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (this type can occur in the setting of apparent sepsis, trauma, severe burns, or trauma, even without clear identification of an infection).
* Epileptic encephalopathies:
** Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (acquired or congenital abnormal cortical development).
** Early myoclonic epileptic encephalopathy (possibly due to metabolic disorders).
* Gluten encephalopathy: Focal abnormalities of the white matter (generally area of low perfusion) are appreciated through magnetic resonance. Migraine is the most common symptom reported.
* &quot;BRAT1&quot; Encephalopathy: An ultra-rare autosomal recessive neonatal encephalopathy.

=== Toxicity from chemotherapy ===
Chemotherapy medication, for example, fludarabine can cause a
permanent severe global encephalopathy. Ifosfamide can cause
a severe encephalopathy (but it can be reversible with stopping use of the drug and starting the use of methylene blue). Bevacizumab and other anti–vascular endothelial growth factor medication can cause posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome.

==Signs and symptoms==
The hallmark of encephalopathy is an altered mental state or delirium. Characteristic of the altered mental state is impairment of the cognition, attention, orientation, sleep–wake cycle and consciousness. An altered state of consciousness may range from failure of selective attention to drowsiness. Hypervigilance may be present; with or without: cognitive deficits, headache, epileptic seizures, myoclonus (involuntary twitching of a muscle or group of muscles) or asterixis (&quot;flapping tremor&quot; of the hand when wrist is extended).

Depending on the type and severity of encephalopathy, common neurological symptoms are loss of cognitive function, subtle personality changes, and an inability to concentrate. Other neurological signs may include dysarthria, hypomimia, problems with movements (they can be clumsy or slow), ataxia, tremor. Other neurological signs may include involuntary grasping and sucking motions, nystagmus (rapid, involuntary eye movement), jactitation (restlessness while in bed), and respiratory abnormalities such as Cheyne-Stokes respiration (cyclic waxing and waning of tidal volume), apneustic respirations and post-hypercapnic apnea. Focal neurological deficits are less common.

Wernicke encephalopathy can co-occur with Korsakoff alcoholic syndrome, characterized by amnestic-confabulatory syndrome: retrograde amnesia, anterograde amnesia, confabulations (invented memories), poor recall and disorientation.

Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis is the most common autoimmune encephalitis. It can cause paranoid and grandiose delusions, agitation, hallucinations (visual and auditory), bizarre behavior, fear, short-term memory loss, and confusion.

HIV encephalopathy can lead to dementia.

==Diagnosis==
Blood tests, cerebrospinal fluid examination by lumbar puncture (also known as spinal tap), brain imaging studies, electroencephalography (EEG), neuropsychological testing and similar diagnostic studies may be used to differentiate the various causes of encephalopathy.

Diagnosis is frequently clinical. That is, no set of tests give the diagnosis, but the entire presentation of the illness with nonspecific test results informs the experienced clinician of the diagnosis.

==Treatment==
Treatment varies according to the type and severity of the encephalopathy. Anticonvulsants may be prescribed to reduce or halt any seizures. Changes to diet and nutritional supplements may help some people. In severe cases, dialysis or organ replacement surgery may be needed.

Sympathomimetic drugs can increase motivation, cognition, motor performance and alertness in persons with encephalopathy caused by brain injury, chronic infections, strokes, brain tumors.

When the encephalopathy is caused by untreated celiac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity, the gluten-free diet stops the progression of brain damage and improves the headaches.

==Prognosis==
Treating the underlying cause of the disorder may improve or reverse symptoms. However, in some cases, the encephalopathy may cause permanent structural changes and irreversible damage to the brain. These permanent deficits can be considered a form of stable dementia. Some encephalopathies can be fatal.

==Terminology==
Encephalopathy is a difficult term because it can be used to denote either a disease or finding (i.e., an observable sign in a person).

When referring to a finding, encephalopathy refers to permanent (or degenerative) brain injury, or a reversible one. It can be due to direct injury to the brain, or illness remote from the brain. The individual findings that cause a clinician to refer to a person as having encephalopathy include intellectual disability, irritability, agitation, delirium, confusion, somnolence, stupor, coma and psychosis. As such, describing a person as having a clinical picture of encephalopathy is not a very specific description.

When referring to a disease, encephalopathy refers to a wide variety of brain disorders with very different etiologies, prognoses and implications. For example, prion diseases, all of which cause transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, are invariably fatal, but other encephalopathies are reversible and can have a number of causes including nutritional deficiencies and toxins.

<text>The Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary, whose members are commonly known as the Loreto Sisters, is a Roman Catholic religious congregation of women dedicated to education founded in Saint-Omer by an Englishwoman, Mary Ward, in 1609. The congregation takes its name from the Marian shrine at Loreto in Italy where Ward used to pray. Ward was declared Venerable by Pope Benedict XVI on 19 December 2009. The Loreto Sisters use the initials I.B.V.M. after their names.

Although education was its primary work, today the congregation is engaged in a wide variety of ministries: literacy programmes, spiritual direction, counselling, managing shelters for homeless women as well as several aspects of the movement for greater justice and peace in the world. The Loreto Sisters operate some 150 schools worldwide, educating over 70,000 pupils.

==Foundation==
Ward was born in Mulwith, North Yorkshire in 1585. She entered a monastery of Poor Clares at Saint-Omer in the then Spanish Netherlands as a lay sister in 1606, and the following year founded a new monastery of the Order specifically for English women at nearby Gravelines. Mary Ward was inspired by the Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola (referred to as Ignatian spirituality). She had a vision for a different, new and modern mode of religious life for women. She envisioned women living a life in companionship and discernment, inspired by the Gospel and engaging with the world without the constraints of the traditional cloister, nor an established &#x27;rule&#x27; placing them under the governance of the local bishop. These ideas contradicted the norms established by the Council of Trent and presented great difficulty for the leadership of the Church of that period.

Ward also believed that women were equal to men in intellect and should be educated accordingly. She travelled through Europe, mainly on foot, establishing schools in Belgium, Bavaria, Austria and Italy. Houses were founded in Angers, Cologne, Rome, Paris, and the Netherlands. A novitiate was established in Liège. The circumstances of the time and the widespread suspicion of Jesuits did not allow her to succeed with the foundation of a religious institute according to her vision. Indeed, although the Institute experienced significant success after its foundation in 1609, it was suppressed in 1631.

==Development==
On the suppression of Mary Ward&#x27;s first congregation, styled by its opponents the &quot;Jesuitesses&quot;, a greater number of the members returned to the world or entered other religious orders. A certain number, however, who desired still to live in religion under the guidance of Ward, were sheltered with the permission of Pope Urban VIII in the Paradeiser Haus, Munich, by the Elector of Bavaria, Maximilian I. The Institute continued to survive mainly in Germany, Austria, and England, but had no official status as a religious congregation and nor official title. Gradually it came to be known on the European continent as &quot;the English Ladies&quot;. Some of the younger members were transferred at the pope&#x27;s desire to Rome, there to live with Mary Ward and be trained by her in the religious life. Her work, therefore, was not destroyed, but reconstituted with certain modifications of detail.

In 1639, with letters of introduction from Pope Urban to Queen Henrietta Maria, Mary returned to England and established herself in London. In 1642 she journeyed northward with her household and established a convent at Heworth, near York, where she died in 1645. It was not until 1703 that what is termed the Second Institute received papal approval for its rule from the then pope, Clement IX, and then canonical recognition as a religious institute by Pope Pius IX.

===Bar Convent===

In 1669, Frances Bedingfeld, superior of the mother house of the order in Munich, went to England at the request of Queen Catherine of Braganza, wife of Charles II, to establish a house in London. With a group of the English members, she set up a school for young women, first at St. Martin&#x27;s Lane, then at Hammersmith. In England, she wore secular garb, and was known as Mrs. Long.

From this community, she founded Bar Convent in York in 1677 at the invitation of Sir Thomas Gascoigne. This was the first convent to be opened in England since the dissolution of the monasteries in 1536. A boarding school for Catholic girls was followed in 1699 by a free day school. Suspected of harboring Catholic priests, both houses experienced frequent harassment by local magistrates. One of the sisters of the Bar Convent was Mother Mary Loyola, an internationally bestselling author of Catholic books.

===Ireland===
In the early 19th century, the Loreto sisters developed as a distinct community in Ireland. Under the guidance of Sister Frances Mary Teresa Ball, Mary Ward&#x27;s Institute developed in and from Ireland. Their role in developing education was central to their work, including the advancement of women in third-level education under the guidance of such superiors as Mother Mary Eucharia Ryan. In 1841 Sister Delphine Hart began the foundation in India. Foundations followed in Mauritius, England, Spain, South Africa, Kenya, Canada, the US and Peru.

===North America and beyond===
At the invitation of Bishop Michael Power of Toronto, five Loreto Sisters under Mother Teresa Ellen Dease arrived in the city in 1847 and founded their first school. Since the 1920s their motherhouse has been at Loretto Abbey (Hoggs Hollow), which housed a girls&#x27; secondary school: Loretto Abbey Catholic Secondary School. In 1987 management of the school was turned over to the Toronto Catholic District School Board. The Sisters also founded Loretto College School on Brunswick Avenue in 1915 and started a college and residence for women at St. Michael&#x27;s College in the University of Toronto. The sisters also established many other schools across Canada, both at the elementary and secondary levels.

In 1880, the first community was established in the United States at Joliet, Illinois. In 1892 the IBVMs expanded their ministry into the city of Chicago and suburbs. Because of the difficulties in overseas communication and the different directions of the North American versus European education systems, the Canadian and United States communities suggested that a North American Generalate would best serve the needs of the times, and as a result, a North American Branch was officially created in 1881.

The Loreto Sisters arrived in Australia in 1875 in response to a request by the Bishop of Ballarat, Bishop O&#x27;Connell. The group from Ireland, led by Mother Gonzaga Barry, set up a convent in Ballarat, Victoria and their first school, Loreto College, Ballarat, was originally known as &quot;Mary&#x27;s Mount&quot;. In New South Wales in 1892 a day school was established in Randwick, and in 1897 Loreto Normanhurst began as a boarding school. The Randwick day school moved to Milson&#x27;s Point in 1901 to begin what is now known as Loreto Kirribilli. The IBVM in Australia also has schools in Brisbane (Loreto College, Coorparoo), Adelaide (Loreto College, Marryatville), Melbourne (Loreto Mandeville Hall) and Perth (Loreto Nedlands Primary School).
The 19th century saw the establishment of Loreto schools and colleges in India which became some of the most highly regarded places of education for women. The same century saw sisters from Ireland establishing a mission in South Africa in 1878. The first years of the 20th century (1904) saw the establishment of a convent in Spain by the Sisters who had a convent in Gibraltar.

Mother Teresa was part of the congregation from 1928 till 1950, during which she founded the Missionaries of Charity in Calcutta.

==Today==
Today, Sisters of the institute are found worldwide. It had historically been divided into three main groups known as the Roman Branch, the Irish Branch and the North American Branch. This situation changed in September 2003, when the Sisters of the Irish and North American Branches voted to reunite. From this, confirmed by papal decree, a new entity has been forged, now referred to as The Loreto Branch. The Roman Branch received permission from the Vatican to change its name, to reflect more closely Mary Ward&#x27;s vision of a Jesuit order for women. The Roman Branch is now Congregatio Jesu or the Congregation of Jesus.

In Ireland, the Sisters run a number of day-schools for girls, and until recently ran a girls&#x27; boarding school at Rathfarnham, Dublin.

The Sisters established a number of girls&#x27; schools in England and Northern Ireland, although a number have gone coeducational. Most have joined the state sector with many run as private schools under the trusteeship of the order. Loreto High School in Chorlton, Manchester is the first Loreto school in the country to be coeducational from its inception.

The South African Province has apostolates in Pretoria, Witbank and Cape Town all of which focus on marginalised women; the Sisters also have a mission in Zambia which was established in 2006.

Like the Sisters in other provinces, those of the Spanish Province, though small in number, work primarily with disadvantaged women and children.

The Sisters of the Australian Province work in Aboriginal welfare, rural communities and care for the aged as well as having outreach in Vietnam and East Timor. There are seven Loreto Colleges spread across five states, the oldest being the school in Ballarat, Victoria.

In North America, the Sisters have communities in Texas, California, Arizona, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin and throughout Canada. Although the North American Sisters are involved in many aspects of education, they are also involved in many community outreach programs. This includes Mercy Home for Boys and Girls (Chicago), Marianjoy Rehabilitation Hospital (Wheaton), Pillars Community Services (Hickory Hills), the Loreto Center (Wheaton) and Wellspring Women&#x27;s Center (Sacramento).

In South America the Congregation of Jesus has three private schools in Brazil (Instituto de Educação Beatíssima Virgem Maria – IEBVM, Colégio Santa Maria and Colégio Mary Ward) and three schools in Chile. The Brazilian Sisters often go on missionary travels to Piauí, one of the poorest states in Brazil.

<doc id="392012" wikidata="Q428447" url="?curid=392012" title="Isosporiasis">
<text>Isosporiasis, also known as cystoisosporiasis, is a human intestinal disease caused by the parasite &quot;Cystoisospora belli&quot; (previously known as &quot;Isospora belli&quot;). It is found worldwide, especially in tropical and subtropical areas. Infection often occurs in immuno-compromised individuals, notably AIDS patients, and outbreaks have been reported in institutionalized groups in the United States. The first documented case was in 1915. It is usually spread indirectly, normally through contaminated food or water (CDC.gov).

==Signs and symptoms==
Infection causes acute, non-bloody diarrhea with crampy abdominal pain, which can last for weeks and result in malabsorption and weight loss. In immunodepressed patients, and in infants and children, the diarrhea can be severe. Eosinophilia may be present (differently from other protozoan infections).
==Cause==
The coccidian parasite &quot;Cystoisospora belli&quot; infects the epithelial cells of the small intestine, and is the least common of the three intestinal coccidia that infect humans (&quot;Toxoplasma&quot;, &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot;, and &quot;Cystoisospora&quot;).

=== Transmission ===
People become infected by swallowing the mature parasite; this normally occurs through the ingestion of contaminated food or water. The infected host then produces an immature form of the parasite in their feces, and when the parasite matures, it is capable of infecting its next host, via food or water containing the parasite.

===Life cycle===
At time of excretion, the immature oocyst usually contains one sporoblast (more rarely two). In further maturation after excretion, the sporoblast divides in two, so the oocyst now contains two sporoblasts. The sporoblasts secrete a cyst wall, thus becoming sporocysts; and the sporocysts divide twice to produce four sporozoites each. Infection occurs by ingestion of sporocyst-containing oocysts: the sporocysts excyst in the small intestine and release their sporozoites, which invade the epithelial cells and initiate schizogony. Upon rupture of the , the merozoites are released, invade new epithelial cells, and continue the cycle of asexual multiplication. Trophozoites develop into which contain multiple merozoites. After a minimum of one week, the sexual stage begins with the development of male and female gametocytes. Fertilization results in the development of oocysts that are excreted in the stool. &quot;Cystoisospora belli&quot; infects both humans and animals.

==Diagnosis==
Microscopic demonstration of the large typically shaped oocysts is the basis for diagnosis. Because the oocysts may be passed in small amounts and intermittently, repeated stool examinations and concentration procedures are recommended. If stool examinations are negative, examination of duodenal specimens by biopsy or string test (Enterotest) may be needed. The oocysts can be visualized on wet mounts by microscopy with bright-field, differential interference contrast (DIC), and epifluorescence. They can also be stained by modified acid-fast stain.

Typical laboratory analyses include:
* Microscopy
* Morphologic comparison with other intestinal parasites
* Bench aids for &quot;Cystoisospora&quot;

== Prevention ==
Avoiding food or water that may be contaminated with stools can help prevent the infection of &quot;Cystoisospora&quot; (Isosporiasis). Good hand-washing, and personal-hygiene practices should be used as well. One should wash their hands with soap and warm water after using the toilet, changing diapers, and before handling food (CDC.gov). It is also important to teach children the importance of washing their hands, and how to properly wash their hands.

==Treatment==
The treatment of choice is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim).

==Epidemiology==
While isosporiasis occurs throughout the world, it is more common in tropical and subtropical areas. Cystoisospora infections are more common in individuals with compromised immune systems, such as HIV or leukemia.

<doc id="392017" wikidata="Q242019" url="?curid=392017" title="Cynthia McKinney">
<text>Cynthia Ann McKinney (born March 17, 1955) is a former American politician. As a member of the Democratic Party, she served six terms in the United States House of Representatives. She was the first African American woman elected to represent Georgia in the House. She left the Democratic Party and ran in 2008 as the presidential nominee of the Green Party. She ran for vice president in 2020 after the Green Party of Alaska formally nominated her and draft-nominated Jesse Ventura for president. 

McKinney served in the Georgia House of Representatives from 1988 to 1992. In the 1992 election, McKinney was elected in Georgia&#x27;s newly re-created 11th district, and was re-elected in 1994. When her district was redrawn and renumbered due to the Supreme Court of the United States ruling in &quot;Miller v. Johnson&quot;, McKinney was elected from the new 4th district in the 1996 election. She was re-elected twice more without substantive opposition, but was defeated by Denise Majette in the 2002 Democratic primary.

After her 2002 loss, McKinney became a vocal supporter of conspiracy theories about the September 11 terrorist attacks, blaming her loss and the 9/11 attacks on &quot;Zionists.&quot; McKinney was re-elected to the House in November 2004, following her successor&#x27;s run for Senate. In Congress, she unsuccessfully tried to unseal FBI records on the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and the murder of Tupac Shakur. She continued to criticize the Bush administration over the 9/11 attacks. She supported anti-war legislation and introduced articles of impeachment against President Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.

McKinney sought re-election in 2006, but was defeated by Hank Johnson in the Democratic primary. In a March 29, 2006, Capitol Hill police incident, she struck a Capitol Hill Police officer for stopping her to ask for identification. McKinney left the Democratic Party in September 2007. She eventually sought and won the Green Party nomination in the 2008 presidential election, receiving 161,797 votes (0.12%) nationwide in the general election.

== Early life and education ==
Cynthia McKinney was born and raised in the affluent middle-class historic Collier Heights area in Atlanta, Georgia, the daughter of Leola McKinney, a retired nurse, and Billy McKinney, a law enforcement officer and former Georgia State Representative.

McKinney was exposed to the Civil Rights movement through her father, an activist who regularly participated in demonstrations across the south. As a police officer, he challenged the discriminatory policies of the Atlanta Police Department, publicly protesting in front of the station, often carrying young McKinney on his shoulders. He was elected as a state representative. McKinney attributes her father&#x27;s election victory, after several failed attempts, to the passage of the Voting Rights Act, which provided for federal oversight and enforcement of voting. Most blacks in the South had been disenfranchised by state legislative barriers since the turn of the 20th century.

McKinney earned a B.A. in international relations from the University of Southern California in 1978 and an M.A. in Law and Diplomacy from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in 1979. In 2015, McKinney completed her dissertation on Hugo Chavez and was awarded a Ph.D. in Leadership and Change by Antioch University.

Prior to entering politics, McKinney worked as a high school teacher and university professor. In 1984, she served as a diplomatic fellow at Spelman College in Atlanta, Georgia. She then taught political science at Agnes Scott College in Decatur and at Clark Atlanta University.

== Career and political activism==
===Georgia House of Representatives (1988–1992)===
McKinney&#x27;s political career began when her father, a representative in the Georgia House of Representatives, submitted her name as a write-in candidate for the Georgia state house in 1986. Despite the fact that she lived in Jamaica at the time, she received approximately 20% of the popular vote. In 1988, McKinney ran for the same seat and won, making the McKinneys the first father and daughter to simultaneously serve in the Georgia House of Representatives. In 1991, she decried the Gulf War in a speech on the House floor; many legislators left the chamber in protest of her remarks.

=== U.S. House of Representatives (1993-2003) ===
In the 1992 election, McKinney was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives as the member of Congress from the newly created 11th District, a 64% African American majority district reaching from Atlanta to Savannah. She was the first African American woman to represent Georgia in the House. She was re-elected in 1994.

In 1995, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Miller v. Johnson&quot; that the 11th District was an unconstitutional gerrymander because the boundaries were drawn based on the racial composition of the constituents. McKinney&#x27;s district was subsequently renumbered as the 4th and redrawn to take in almost all of DeKalb County, prompting outrage from McKinney. She asserted that it was a racially discriminatory ruling, given the fact that the Supreme Court had previously ruled that Texas&#x27;s 6th District, which is 91% white, was unconstitutional. The new 4th, however, was no less Democratic than the 11th. McKinney was easily elected from this district in 1996. She was re-elected two more times with no substantive opposition.

In her first period in Congress, she served on several committees, including the House Committees on Foreign Affairs, Banking and Finance, and Armed Services. She eventually ascended to the top Democratic spot on the International Relations Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights, serving as ranking member. In that role, she became a frequent critic of American foreign policy. Examples include her vocal opposition to President Bill Clinton’s interventionist policies in Kosovo, U.S. sanctions against Iraq, and other policies related to the Middle East.

On October 17, 2001, McKinney introduced a bill calling for &quot;the suspension of the use, sale, development, production, testing, and export of depleted uranium munitions pending the outcome of certain studies of the health effects of such munitions.&quot; The bill was cosponsored by Reps. Aníbal Acevedo Vilá, Puerto Rico; Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis.; Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio; Barbara Lee, D-Ca.; and Jim McDermott, D-Wash.

==== Criticism of Al Gore ====
During the 2000 presidential campaign, McKinney wrote that &quot;Al Gore&#x27;s Negro tolerance level has never been too high. I&#x27;ve never known him to have more than one black person around him at any given time.&quot; Gore&#x27;s campaign pointed out that its manager, Donna Brazile, was black.

McKinney chastised Gore for failing to support the U&#x27;wa people of Colombia trying to oppose petroleum drilling near them. In a press release issued on February 22, 2000, entitled &quot;No More Blood For Oil,&quot; McKinney wrote that &quot;Oil drilling on Uwa land will result in considerable environmental damage and social conflict which will lead to greater militarization of the region as well as an increase in violence.&quot; Addressing herself to Gore, she wrote, &quot;I am contacting you because you have remained silent on this issue despite your strong financial interests and family ties with Occidental.&quot;

==== Objection to the 2000 presidential election ====
McKinney and other members of the House of Representatives objected to the 25 electoral votes from Florida which George W. Bush narrowly won after a contentious recount. Because no senator joined her objection, the objection was dismissed by Vice President Al Gore, who was Bush&#x27;s opponent in the 2000 presidential election. Without Florida&#x27;s electoral votes, the election would have been decided by the U.S. House of Representatives, with each state having one vote in accordance with the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

==== September 11 attacks ====
McKinney gained national attention for her remarks following the September 11 attacks in 2001. She asserted that the United States had &quot;numerous warnings of the events to come&quot; and called for an investigation. She enquired in a radio interview: &quot;What did this administration know and when did it know it?&quot; She said that US President George W. Bush may have been aware and allowed them to happen. She made allegations about the earlier president, George H. W. Bush: &quot;It is known that President Bush&#x27;s father, through The Carlyle Group, had—at the time of the attacks—joint business interests with the bin Laden construction company and many defense industry holdings, the stocks of which have soared since September 11.&quot; A spokesman for the Carlyle Group rejected her hypothesis. In a statement in April 2002, McKinney told &quot;The Washington Post&quot;: &quot;I am not aware of any evidence showing that President Bush or members of his administration have personally profited from the attacks of 9–11. A complete investigation might reveal that to be the case.&quot;

In the month that followed the attacks, McKinney published an open letter to the Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal. The New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani had refused to cash a $10 million check written by Saudi Prince because of the Prince&#x27;s suggestion that the attacks were an indication that the United States &quot;should re-examine its policies in the Middle East and adopt a more balanced stand toward the Palestinian cause.&quot; In the open letter, she expressed her disappointment at Giuliani&#x27;s action: &quot;Let me say that there are a growing number of people in the United States who recognize, like you, that U.S. policy in the Middle East needs serious examination...Your Royal Highness, many of us here in the United States have long been concerned about reports by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch that reveal a pattern of excessive, and often indiscriminate, use of lethal force by Israeli security forces in situations where Palestinian demonstrators were unarmed and posed no threat of death or serious injury to the security forces or to others.&quot;

==== 2002 primary defeat ====
In 2002, McKinney was defeated in the Democratic primary by DeKalb County judge Denise Majette. Majette defeated McKinney with 58% of the vote to McKinney&#x27;s 42%.

McKinney protested the result in court, claiming that thousands of Republicans had voted in the Democratic primary, the real contest in the district, in revenge for her anti-Bush administration views and her allegations of voter fraud in Florida in the 2000 presidential election. Like 20 other states, Georgia operates an open primary: voters do not align with a political party when they register to vote and may participate in whichever party&#x27;s primary election they choose. Thus, relying on the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;California Democratic Party v. Jones&quot;, which had held that California&#x27;s blanket primary violated the First Amendment (despite the fact that the Court explicitly differentiated—albeit in dicta—the blanket primary from the open primary in &quot;Jones&quot;), on McKinney&#x27;s behalf, five voters claimed that the open primary system was unconstitutional, operating in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the associational right protected by the First Amendment, and various statutory rights protected by § 2 of the Voting Rights Act.

The district court dismissed the case, in the judgement stating the plaintiffs had presented no evidence in support of the 14th Amendment and Voting Rights Act claims, and lacked standing to bring the First Amendment claim. It interpreted the Supreme Court&#x27;s &quot;Jones&quot; ruling to hold that the right to association involved in a dispute over a primary—and thus, standing to sue—belongs to a political party, not an individual voter. On appeal in May 2004, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals upheld this result in &quot;Osburn v. Cox&quot;, assessing that not only were the plaintiffs&#x27; claims meritless, but the remedy they requested would likely be unconstitutional under the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Tashjian v. Republican Party of Connecticut&quot;. On October 18, 2004, the Supreme Court brought an end to the litigation, denying certiorari without comment.

Other factors in McKinney&#x27;s defeat included her allegations of Bush&#x27;s involvement in 9/11, her opposition to aid to Israel, a perceived support of Palestinian and Arab causes, and open antisemitism in her comments. On the night before the primary election, McKinney&#x27;s father stated on Atlanta television that &quot;Jews have bought everybody. Jews. J-E-W-S.&quot; Cynthia McKinney had been through a long contentious relationship with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). Georgia political analyst Bill Shipp addressed McKinney&#x27;s defeat saying: &quot;voters sent a message: &#x27;We&#x27;re tired of these over-the-top congressmen dealing in great international and national interests. How about somebody looking out for our interests?&#x27;&quot;

=== 2003–2005 ===

During 2003 and 2004, McKinney toured the US and much of Europe publicly speaking about her defeat, her opposition to the Iraq War, and the Bush administration.

In 2004, McKinney served on the advisory committee for the group 2004 Racism Watch. 

Having made no secret that she wanted to return to Congress, McKinney turned down the Green Party&#x27;s nomination for president in the 2004 presidential election.

=== Return to the U.S. House of Representatives (2005–2007) ===
Majette declined to run for re-election to the House, opting instead to become a candidate to replace retiring Senator Zell Miller, a conservative Democrat. According to a report in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, John Lewis believed it was &quot;going to be a real battle&quot; for McKinney to return to Congress. It was feared McKinney&#x27;s previous comments would have a negative effect on her chances. Since it was taken for granted that victory in the Democratic primary was tantamount to election in November, McKinney&#x27;s opponents focused on clearing the field for a single candidate who could force her into a runoff election.

McKinney hosted the first delegation of Afro-Latinos from Central and South America and worked with the World Bank and the U.S. State Department to recognize Afro-Latinos. She stood with Aboriginals against Australian mining companies. She was one of the 31 in the House who objected to the official allotment of the electoral votes from Ohio in the 2004 United States presidential election to incumbent George W. Bush.

====Objection to the 2004 presidential election====
McKinney was one of the 31 House Democrats who voted not to count the 20 electoral votes from Ohio in the 2004 presidential election, despite Republican President George W. Bush winning the state by 118,457 votes. Without Ohio&#x27;s electoral votes, the election would have been decided by the U.S. House of Representatives, with each state having one vote in accordance with the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

==== 9/11 Commission ====
On July 22, 2005, the first anniversary of the release of the 9/11 Commission Report, McKinney held a briefing on Capitol Hill about the attacks. The day-long briefing featured family members of victims, scholars, former intelligence officers and others who critiqued the 9/11 Commission account of 9/11 and its recommendations. The four morning panels addressed flaws, omissions, and a lack of historical and political analysis in the commission&#x27;s report. Three afternoon panels critiqued the commission&#x27;s recommendations in the areas of foreign and domestic policy and intelligence reform. An &quot;Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; editorial said that the purpose of the event was to discuss whether or not the Bush administration was involved in the 9/11 attacks, expressing surprise that McKinney was once again taking on the issue that was believed to have cost her House seat. The &quot;Journal-Constitution&quot; declined to publish McKinney&#x27;s reply. The 9/11 Commission has sealed all the notes and transcripts of some 2,000 interviews, all the forensic evidence, and both classified and non-classified documents used in compiling its final report until January 2, 2009. McKinney&#x27;s interest in 9/11 relates specifically to what she expresses as her opposition to excessive government secrecy, which she has challenged with numerous pieces of legislation.

McKinney has said that she &quot;remain[s] hopeful that we will learn the truth&quot; about 9/11 &quot;because more and more people around the world are demanding it.&quot;

==== Hurricane Katrina activism ====
McKinney was an advocate for victims of 2005&#x27;s Hurricane Katrina and a critic of the government&#x27;s response to it. Over 100,000 evacuees from New Orleans and Mississippi relocated to the Atlanta area, and many have now settled there.

During the Katrina crisis, evacuees were turned away by Arthur Lawson&#x27;s Gretna police when they attempted to cross the Crescent City Connection Bridge between New Orleans and Gretna, Louisiana. McKinney was the only member of Congress to participate in a march across the Crescent City Connection Bridge on November 7, 2005, to protest what had happened on that bridge in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.

In response, McKinney introduced a bill on November 2, 2005, that would temporarily deny federal assistance to the City of Gretna Police Department, Harry Lee&#x27;s Jefferson Parish Sheriff&#x27;s Office, and the Crescent City Connection Police Department, in the state of Louisiana. The bill was referred to the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security, but was not acted on. However, in August 2006, a grand jury began an investigation of the incident. On October 31, 2007, the Grand Jury ruled not to charge anyone. The Grand Jury accepted Gretna Police Chief Arthur Lawson&#x27;s explanation, &quot;Some of the people in the crowd acted aggressively and threatened to throw one of the officers off the bridge, the chief said. The shot was fired over the officer&#x27;s shoulder and over the side of the bridge.

McKinney chose to be an active participant in the Select Bipartisan Committee to Investigate the Preparation for and Response to Hurricane Katrina, although the Democratic Party leadership called for Democratic members to boycott the committee. She submitted her own 72-page report. She sat as a guest along with only a few other Democrats. In questioning Department of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff, McKinney referred to a news story in which the owners of a nursing home had been charged with negligent homicide for abandoning 34 clients who died in the flood waters. McKinney asked Chertoff: &quot;Mr. Secretary, if the nursing home owners are arrested for negligent homicide, why shouldn&#x27;t you also be arrested for negligent homicide?&quot;

The Congressional Black Caucus&#x27; Omnibus Bill (HR 4197) was introduced on November 2, 2005, to provide a comprehensive response to the Gulf Coast residents affected by Hurricane Katrina. The second title of the bill was submitted by McKinney, seeking a Comprehensive Environmental Sampling and Toxicity Assessment Plan, or CESTAP, to minimize harm to Gulf Coast residents from the toxic releases into the environment caused by the hurricane.

At the request of McKinney, the Select Bipartisan Committee to Investigate the Preparation for and Response to Hurricane Katrina, chaired by Thomas M. Davis, held a previously unscheduled hearing titled &quot;Voices Inside the Storm&quot; on December 6, 2005.

McKinney, in collaboration with Rep. Barbara Lee (CA), produced a &quot;Katrina Legislative Summary,&quot; a chart summarizing House and Senate bills on Hurricane Katrina. On June 13, 2006, McKinney said on the House floor that only a dozen of the 176 Katrina bills identified on the chart had passed into law, leaving 163 bills stalled in committee.

On August 2, 2007, McKinney participated in a press conference in New Orleans to launch an International Tribunal on Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which she described as an effort to seek justice for the victims of those hurricanes and their aftermath.

==== Anti-war and human rights legislation ====
Until 2000, McKinney served on the House International Relations Committee, where she was the highest-ranking Democrat on the Human Rights Subcommittee. McKinney worked on legislation to stop conventional weapons transfers to governments that are undemocratic or fail to respect human rights.

On November 18, 2005, McKinney was one of only three House members to vote for H.R. 571, introduced by Duncan Hunter, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, on which McKinney sat. Hunter, a Republican, offered this resolution calling for an immediate withdrawal of U.S. forces in Iraq in place of John Murtha&#x27;s H.J.Res. 73, which called for redeployment &quot;at the earliest possible date.&quot; In her prepared statement, McKinney accused the Republicans of &quot;trying to set a trap for the Democrats. A &#x27;no&#x27; vote for this Resolution will obscure the fact that there is strong support for withdrawal of US forces from Iraq ... In voting for this bill, let me be perfectly clear that I am not saying the United States should exit Iraq without a plan. I agree with Mr. Murtha that security and stability in Iraq should be pursued through diplomacy. I simply want to vote &#x27;yes&#x27; to an orderly withdrawal from Iraq.&quot;

==== Articles of impeachment introduced ====
At the end of the 2006 legislative session, McKinney introduced articles of impeachment against President George W. Bush as (H Res 1106), which made three charges against Bush:
* Failure to uphold the constitution, specifically that &quot;George Walker Bush ... in preparing the invasion of Iraq, did withhold intelligence from the Congress, by refusing to provide Congress with the full intelligence picture that he was being given, by redacting information ... and actively manipulating the intelligence on Iraq’s alleged weapons programs by pressuring the Central Intelligence Agency and other intelligence agencies.
* Abuse of office and executive privilege, &quot;obstructing and hindering the work of Congressional investigative bodies and by seeking to expand the scope of the powers of his office.&quot;
* Failure to ensure that laws are faithfully executed, specifically by a program of illegal domestic spying and circumvention of the FISA Act.

The second article also made charges against Vice President Dick Cheney alleging he manipulated intelligence in order to justify the Iraq War, and against Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice alleging that she knowingly made false statements concerning Iraq&#x27;s weapons of mass destruction program.

McKinney&#x27;s bill was abandoned when it failed to clear the House Committee on the Judiciary.

==== Capitol Police incident ====

On the morning of March 29, 2006, McKinney entered the Longworth House Office Building&#x27;s southeast entrance and proceeded past the security checkpoint, walking around the metal detector. Members of Congress have identifying lapel pins and were not required to pass through metal detectors at the time. The officers present failed to recognize McKinney as a member of Congress because she was not wearing the appropriate lapel pin and had recently changed her hairstyle. She proceeded westward down the ground floor hallway and about halfway down the hallway was stopped by United States Capitol Police officer Paul McKenna, who states that he had been calling after her: &quot;Ma&#x27;am, Ma&#x27;am!&quot;; at that time it is reported that McKinney struck the officer. Two days later, Officer McKenna filed a police report claiming that McKinney had struck &quot;his chest with a closed fist&quot;.

In the midst of a media frenzy, McKinney made an apology on the floor of the House of Representatives on April 6, 2006, neither admitting to nor denying the charge, stating only that: &quot;There should not have been any physical contact in this incident.&quot;

Though McKinney was not indicted for criminal charges or subjected to disciplinary action by the House, the president of the Fraternal Order of Police said of Officer McKenna, &quot;We&#x27;re going to make sure the officer won&#x27;t be harassed. We want the officer to be able talk to experts, who can look at his legal recourses, if he needed to.&quot;

==== Unintentional on-air criticism ====
In the wake of the March 2006 incident with the Capitol Police officer, McKinney was in the news, and her office invited the media to attend one of her monthly &quot;District Days,&quot; where she spends one full day meeting with constituents to discuss issues of concern. At her April 23, 2006, &quot;District Days&quot; event, McKinney was being interviewed by WGCL&#x27;s Renee Starzyk, who repeatedly questioned her about the March 29 scuffle with a Capitol police officer. Frustrated, McKinney stood up and apparently forgot she was still wearing the microphone. Her offscreen comments were captured on tape. She was heard saying, &quot;Oh, crap, now you know what ... they lied to [McKinney&#x27;s senior aide Coz Carson], and Coz is a fool.&quot; McKinney returned on screen with the microphone, this time with instructions on what parts of the interview the station was allowed to use: &quot;anything that is captured by your audio ... that is captured while I&#x27;m not seated in this chair is off the record and is not permissible to be used ... is that understood?&quot;

==== MLK Records Act ====
McKinney submitted to Congress two different versions of the same bill, the &quot;MLK Records Act&quot; (one in 2003, the other in 2005), which, if signed into law, would release all currently sealed files concerning the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. These records were sealed in 1978 and are not due to be declassified until the year 2028. The 2005 version of the MLK Records Act, HR 2554 had 67 cosponsors by the time McKinney left office at the end of 2006. A Senate version of the bill (S2499) was introduced by Senator John Kerry and was co-signed by Sen. Hillary Clinton. The bill has also received numerous endorsements from former members of the House Select Committee on Assassinations.

==== Tupac Shakur Records Act ====
Documents relating to the death of rapper Tupac Shakur, in which McKinney took an active interest, would be released under another bill she would introduce. In a statement, McKinney explained her reason for the bill: &quot;The public has the right to know because he was a well-known figure. There is intense public interest in the life and death of Tupac Shakur.&quot; Legislation demanding release of records is a more direct route than requesting their release through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).

==== 2006 primary and primary runoff ====

McKinney finished first in the July 18, 2006 Democratic primary, edging DeKalb County Commissioner Hank Johnson 47.1% to 44.4%, with a third candidate receiving 8.5%. However, as McKinney failed to get at least 50% of the vote, she and Johnson were forced into a runoff.

In the runoff of August 8, 2006, McKinney received about the same number of votes as in the July primary, even though there were about 8,000 more votes cast in the runoff than in the primary. Johnson won with 41,178 votes (59%) to McKinney&#x27;s 28,832 (41%). McKinney&#x27;s loss was attributed to a mid-decade redistricting, in which the 4th had absorbed portions of Gwinnett and Rockdale Counties, as well as her run-in with a police officer in the March 29, 2006, Capitol Hill police incident.

CNN reported that during her concession speech, McKinney hardly mentioned her opponent but praised the leftist political leaders elected in South America. She also questioned the efficacy of voting machines and criticized the media.

=== 2008 Green Party presidential candidacy ===

McKinney was a Green Party candidate in the 2008 presidential election.

McKinney appeared at the July 15, 2007, Green Party National Meeting in Reading, Pennsylvania, where she suggested that the Green Party could become a progressive political force. &quot;[T]he disgust of the American people with what they see before them—all they need is the blueprint and a road map. Why not have the Green Party provide the blueprint and the road map?&quot;

At an August 27, 2007, peace rally in Kennebunkport, Maine, McKinney confirmed the depth of her disenchantment with the Democratic Party, urging San Francisco voters to replace Nancy Pelosi with antiwar activist Cindy Sheehan. On September 10, in a letter to the steering committee of the Green Party of the United States, McKinney stated she would not seek the Green Party nomination for president. However, in early October it appeared that McKinney was making moves toward declaring herself an official Green Party candidate.

On July 9, 2008, she named as her running mate journalist and community activist Rosa Clemente and clinched the party&#x27;s nomination three days later at the 2008 Green Party National Convention.

On September 10, 2008, McKinney joined a press conference held by third-party and independent candidates, along with Ralph Nader, Chuck Baldwin, and initiator Ron Paul. The participants agreed on four basic principles:
* An early end to the Iraq War, and an end to threats of war against other countries including Iran and Russia.
* The safeguarding of privacy and civil liberties, including a call for the repeal of the Patriot Act, the Military Commissions Act, and FISA legislation
* No increase in the National Debt
* A &quot;thorough investigation, evaluation and audit of the Federal Reserve System.&quot;

On November 4, 2008, McKinney received 161,797 votes, 0.12% of the total votes cast, placing her behind Obama, McCain, Nader, Barr, and Baldwin.

=== 2008–2011 ===
In March 2009, McKinney was present at a gathering of Holocaust deniers in London. In postings on the Green Party website, she said former Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad was &quot;one of my heroes&quot;. She described David Pidcock as &quot;my London friend&quot;. Pidcock is an individual whom the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League have described as an &quot;anti-Semitic writer&quot;. In one post she related the conspiracy theory that individuals such as George Soros and Alan Greenspan (both Jewish) have plotted to create a &quot;one-world government&quot;. In discussing this notion, she was drawing on a book entitled, &quot;The Shadow Money-Lenders&quot; by Matthias Chang, an advisor to Mahathir. McKinney praised the work. 

==== Free Gaza Movement ====
On December 30, 2008, McKinney was aboard the ship &quot;Dignity&quot; when it attempted to enter the Gaza Strip, which had its coastal area declared a &quot;closed military zone&quot; by Israel, while on a humanitarian mission by the Free Gaza Movement from Cyprus. Aboard were physicians, medical supplies, and activists, including Caoimhe Butterly. The Israeli Navy confronted the ship at night in international waters. Members of the crew claimed that the ship was rammed, gunfire was directed at the water, and the ship was forced to dock in Lebanon after taking on water. Israeli officials claimed that the collision was accidental and occurred after the ship was informed they would not be allowed to enter Gaza and tried to outmaneuver the patrol boat; they decried McKinney&#x27;s actions as being irresponsible and provocative for the sake of propaganda.

On June 30, 2009, McKinney was aboard the Greek-flagged Free Gaza Movement&#x27;s ship &quot;Spirit of Humanity&quot; carrying 21 activists including Irish peace activist Mairead McGuire, medical supplies, a symbolic bag of cement, olive trees and toys, when it was seized by the Israeli Navy off the Gaza coast. It was unclear whether they were in international waters or in Gazan waters, which is subject to the Israeli blockade of Gaza. Although both the Cypriot and Israeli authorities were officially informed the destination was Gaza before the vessel&#x27;s departure, according to the Cypriot government the ship &quot;was given permission by the competent Authorities of the Republic of Cyprus to sail off the port of Larnaca in Cyprus on the basis of its declaration that its intended destination was the port of Port Said in Egypt.&quot;

McKinney was held at the Givon immigration detention center in Ramle, until her release on July 5. McKinney initially refused to sign the deportation papers because they were written in Hebrew and that the papers would require them to admit that they were in violation of Israel&#x27;s blockade, which they denied. According to &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot;, Israeli officials stated that the &quot;Palestinian Authority and the rest of the international community had agreed to the off-shore blockade to prevent arms smuggling into Gaza.&quot; &quot;The Palestinian Chronicle&quot; reports that such an agreement to the off-shore blockade never happened. &quot;No Palestinians have agreed nor did the international community agree to a blockade of Gaza by land or Sea.&quot; On June 17, 2009, a group of United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) called for an end to Israel&#x27;s blockade of the Gaza Strip.

On July 7, 2009, McKinney was deported to the United States. The Israeli government indicated it would deliver the supplies via land.

====Libya, Iran and Hugo Chávez====
On May 21, 2011, McKinney appeared on state-run television in Libya and stated that United States participation in military intervention in the 2011 Libyan civil war was &quot;not what the people of the United States stand for and it&#x27;s not what African-Americans stand for&quot;. In the same interview, McKinney stated: &quot;On a previous visit to Libya, I was able to learn about &quot;The Green Book&quot;, and the form of direct democracy that is advocated in &quot;The Green Book&quot;.&quot;

Around the same time, during her first visit to Iran, McKinney was interviewed by Iran&#x27;s state-run channel, Press TV: &quot;it is clear that the people of Iran have one thing in mind, and that is that they are a revolutionary state. And as a revolutionary state, they understand colonialism, neo-colonialism, and imperialism. They understand being under the foot of oppression and occupation—even if it is mental occupation—from an outside force or outside power, and that is what centers the resistance&quot;.

===U.S. House of Representatives election, 2012===
McKinney announced in April 2012 that she would run for the 4th congressional district against Hank Johnson on the Green Party ticket. However, in August she failed to qualify for the ballot. Nevertheless, she received 58 write-in votes in the general election.

===Later career and activities (2013–present)===

In 2016, McKinney released a statement via Twitter accusing Israelis of conducting the 2016 Nice truck attack in France and the Würzburg train attack in Germany, she did not provide any evidence for either claim. In May 2020, &quot;The Algemeiner Journal&quot; and other media outlets reported that McKinney released a series of statements via Twitter questioning the true number of Jewish people murdered during The Holocaust. In the tweets (in which she misrepresented an article from &quot;Haaretz&quot;) she stated: &quot;So, the figure wasn&#x27;t six million after all?? What about those punished and even imprisoned for saying so?? Is this a &quot;You can&#x27;t say, but I can&quot; kind of thing??&quot;.

McKinney has been accused of spreading Covid-19 misinformation when in 2021 she falsely claimed that Hank Aaron&#x27;s death was due to the Covid-19 vaccine.

&quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; reported that on June 28, 2021, McKinney posted a meme to Twitter that depicted the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center as a puzzle with the &quot;final piece of the puzzle&quot; having the word &quot;Zionists&quot; on it. When adding that piece to the puzzle, the image read: &quot;Zionists did it.&quot; New York Congressman Jamaal Bowman condemned McKinney&#x27;s post as anti-semitic. The ADL in a tweet objected to McKinney continuing &quot;to repeat an offensive #antisemitic trope falsely blaming Jews/Zionists for the terrorist attacks on 9/11.&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; noted that, amid a sitewide increase in hate speech following Elon Musk&#x27;s purchase of Twitter, McKinney had prominently amplified and made tweets in 2022 containing an antisemitic hashtag mainly used by neo-Nazis to imply a conspiracy of Jewish people in positions of power.

On February 19, 2023, McKinney participated in the Rage Against the War Machine rally. She gave remarks at the rally by video, where she claimed that there are &quot;criminal elements&quot; within the federal government of the United States, that the Democratic Party had become a &quot;war party,&quot; that the Federal Election Commission can &quot;control U.S. election outcomes,&quot; and more. 

On September 11, 2023, McKinney promoted a livestream called &quot;Can Black People and White People Work Together to Defeat Our Common Enemy&quot; with the Star of David, indicating that the &quot;common enemy&quot; is the Jewish people. The livestream was hosted by Ayo Kimathi, the author of &quot;Jews Are the Problem&quot; and described by the ADL as an &quot;anti-Semitic and an anti-LGBTQ+ Black nationalist extremist&quot; and David Duke, a white-supremacist, former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard and anti-Semite. In the livestream, Kimathi explicitly advocated for ties with White nationalists to actively eradicate &quot;the Jew.&quot; The Green Party condemned McKinney for promoting such an event while noting that she is not affiliated with the party and has not been for several years.

McKinney is an assistant professor at North South University.

In 2024 she appeared in the movie &quot;Occupied&quot; by Stew Peters where she expressed support for Adolf Hitler&#x27;s elimination of pornography.

== Awards and honors ==
On June 14, 2000, a part of Memorial Drive, a major thoroughfare running through her district, was renamed &quot;Cynthia McKinney Parkway,&quot; but the naming has come under scrutiny since her primary defeat in 2006 as well as previous controversial statements that she had made.

== Personal life ==
In 2007, McKinney moved from her longtime residence in the Atlanta suburb of Stone Mountain to California.

<text>Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb), also known as Koch&#x27;s bacillus, is a species of pathogenic bacteria in the family Mycobacteriaceae and the causative agent of tuberculosis. 

First discovered in 1882 by Robert Koch, &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; has an unusual, waxy coating on its cell surface primarily due to the presence of mycolic acid. This coating makes the cells impervious to Gram staining, and as a result, &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; can appear weakly Gram-positive. Acid-fast stains such as Ziehl–Neelsen, or fluorescent stains such as auramine are used instead to identify &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; with a microscope. The physiology of &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; is highly aerobic and requires high levels of oxygen. Primarily a pathogen of the mammalian respiratory system, it infects the lungs. The most frequently used diagnostic methods for tuberculosis are the tuberculin skin test, acid-fast stain, culture, and polymerase chain reaction.

The &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; genome was sequenced in 1998.

== Microbiology ==
&quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; requires oxygen to grow, and is nonmotile. It divides every 18–24 hours. This is extremely slow compared with other bacteria, which tend to have division times measured in minutes (&quot;Escherichia coli&quot; can divide roughly every 20 minutes). It is a small bacillus that can withstand weak disinfectants and can survive in a dry state for weeks. Its unusual cell wall, rich in lipids such as mycolic acid and cord factor glycolipid, is likely responsible for its resistance to desiccation and is a key virulence factor.
=== Microscopy ===

Other bacteria are commonly identified with a microscope by staining them with Gram stain. However, the mycolic acid in the cell wall of &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; does not absorb the stain. Instead, acid-fast stains such as Ziehl–Neelsen stain, or fluorescent stains such as auramine are used. Cells are curved rod-shaped and are often seen wrapped together, due to the presence of fatty acids in the cell wall that stick together. This appearance is referred to as cording, like strands of cord that make up a rope. &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; is characterized in tissue by caseating granulomas containing Langhans giant cells, which have a &quot;horseshoe&quot; pattern of nuclei.

=== Culture ===
&quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; can be grown in the laboratory. Compared to other commonly studied bacteria, &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; has a remarkably slow growth rate, doubling roughly once per day. Commonly used media include liquids such as Middlebrook 7H9 or 7H12, egg-based solid media such as Lowenstein-Jensen, and solid agar-based such as Middlebrook 7H11 or 7H10. Visible colonies require several weeks to grow on agar plates. Mycobacteria growth indicator tubes can contain a gel that emits fluorescent light if mycobacteria are grown. It is distinguished from other mycobacteria by its production of catalase and niacin. Other tests to confirm its identity include gene probes and MALDI-TOF.

=== Morphology ===
Analysis of &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; via scanning electron microscope shows the bacteria are in length with an average diameter of . The outer membrane and plasma membrane surface areas were measured to be and , respectively. The cell, outer membrane, periplasm, plasma membrane, and cytoplasm volumes were (= μm3), , , , and , respectively. The average total ribosome number was with ribosome density about .
=== Related Mycobacterium species ===

&quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; is part of a genetically related group of Mycobacterium species that has at least nine members:
* &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; &quot;sensu stricto&quot;
* &quot;M. africanum&quot;
* &quot;M. canettii&quot;
* &quot;M. bovis&quot;
* &quot;M. caprae&quot;
* &quot;M. microti&quot;
* &quot;M. pinnipedii&quot;
* &quot;M. mungi&quot;
* &quot;M. orygis&quot;

==Pathophysiology==
Humans are the only known reservoirs of &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot;. A misconception is that &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; can be spread by shaking hands, making contact with toilet seats, sharing food or drink, or sharing toothbrushes. However, major spread is through air droplets originating from a person who has the disease either coughing, sneezing, speaking, or singing.

When in the lungs, &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; is phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages, but they are unable to kill and digest the bacterium. Its cell wall is made of cord factor glycolipids that inhibit the fusion of the phagosome with the lysosome, which contains a host of antibacterial factors.

Specifically, &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; blocks the bridging molecule, early endosomal autoantigen 1 (EEA1); however, this blockade does not prevent fusion of vesicles filled with nutrients. In addition, production of the diterpene isotuberculosinol prevents maturation of the phagosome. The bacteria also evades macrophage-killing by neutralizing reactive nitrogen intermediates. More recently, &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; has been shown to secrete and cover itself in 1-tuberculosinyladenosine (1-TbAd), a special nucleoside that acts as an antacid, allowing it to neutralize pH and induce swelling in lysosomes.

In &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; infections, PPM1A levels were found to be upregulated, and this, in turn, would impact the normal apoptotic response of macrophages to clear pathogens, as PPM1A is involved in the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. Hence, when PPM1A levels were increased, the expression of it inhibits the two apoptotic pathways. With kinome analysis, the JNK/AP-1 signalling pathway was found to be a downstream effector that PPM1A has a part to play in, and the apoptotic pathway in macrophages are controlled in this manner. As a result of having apoptosis being suppressed, it provides &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; with a safe replicative niche, and so the bacteria are able to maintain a latent state for a prolonged time.

Granulomas, organized aggregates of immune cells, are a hallmark feature of tuberculosis infection. Granulomas play dual roles during infection: they regulate the immune response and minimize tissue damage, but also can aid in the expansion of infection.

The ability to construct &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; mutants and test individual gene products for specific functions has significantly advanced the understanding of its pathogenesis and virulence factors. Many secreted and exported proteins are known to be important in pathogenesis. For example, one such virulence factor is cord factor (trehalose dimycolate), which serves to increase survival within its host. Resistant strains of &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; have developed resistance to more than one TB drug, due to mutations in their genes. In addition, pre-existing first-line TB drugs such as rifampicin and streptomycin have decreased efficiency in clearing intracellular &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; due to their inability to effectively penetrate the macrophage niche.

JNK plays a key role in the control of apoptotic pathways—intrinsic and extrinsic. In addition, it is also found to be a substrate of PPM1A activity, hence the phosphorylation of JNK would cause apoptosis to occur. Since PPM1A levels are elevated during &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; infections, by inhibiting the PPM1A signalling pathways, it could potentially be a therapeutic method to kill &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot;-infected macrophages by restoring its normal apoptotic function in defence of pathogens. By targeting the PPM1A-JNK signalling axis pathway, then, it could eliminate &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot;-infected macrophages.

The ability to restore macrophage apoptosis to &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot;-infected ones could improve the current tuberculosis chemotherapy treatment, as TB drugs can gain better access to the bacteria in the niche. thus decreasing the treatment times for &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; infections.

Symptoms of &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; include coughing that lasts for more than three weeks, hemoptysis, chest pain when breathing or coughing, weight loss, fatigue, fever, night sweats, chills, and loss of appetite. &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; also has the potential of spreading to other parts of the body. This can cause blood in urine if the kidneys are affected, and back pain if the spine is affected.

===Strain variation===

Typing of strains is useful in the investigation of tuberculosis outbreaks, because it gives the investigator evidence for or against transmission from person to person. Consider the situation where person A has tuberculosis and believes he acquired it from person B. If the bacteria isolated from each person belong to different types, then transmission from B to A is definitively disproven; however, if the bacteria are the same strain, then this supports (but does not definitively prove) the hypothesis that B infected A.

Until the early 2000s, &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; strains were typed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis. This has now been superseded by variable numbers of tandem repeats (VNTR), which is technically easier to perform and allows better discrimination between strains. This method makes use of the presence of repeated DNA sequences within the &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; genome.

Three generations of VNTR typing for &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; are noted. The first scheme, called exact tandem repeat, used only five loci, but the resolution afforded by these five loci was not as good as PFGE. The second scheme, called mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit, had discrimination as good as PFGE. The third generation (mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit – 2) added a further nine loci to bring the total to 24. This provides a degree of resolution greater than PFGE and is currently the standard for typing &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot;. However, with regard to archaeological remains, additional evidence may be required because of possible contamination from related soil bacteria.

Antibiotic resistance in &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; typically occurs due to either the accumulation of mutations in the genes targeted by the antibiotic or a change in titration of the drug. &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; is considered to be multidrug-resistant (MDR TB) if it has developed drug resistance to both rifampicin and isoniazid, which are the most important antibiotics used in treatment. Additionally, extensively drug-resistant &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; (XDR TB) is characterized by resistance to both isoniazid and rifampin, plus any fluoroquinolone and at least one of three injectable second-line drugs (i.e., amikacin, kanamycin, or capreomycin).

==Genome==
The genome of the H37Rv strain was published in 1998. Its size is 4 million base pairs, with 3,959 genes; 40% of these genes have had their function characterized, with possible function postulated for another 44%. Within the genome are also six pseudogenes.

Fatty acid metabolism. The genome contains 250 genes involved in fatty acid metabolism, with 39 of these involved in the polyketide metabolism generating the waxy coat. Such large numbers of conserved genes show the evolutionary importance of the waxy coat to pathogen survival. Furthermore, experimental studies have since validated the importance of a lipid metabolism for&quot; M. tuberculosis&quot;, consisting entirely of host-derived lipids such as fats and cholesterol. Bacteria isolated from the lungs of infected mice were shown to preferentially use fatty acids over carbohydrate substrates. &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; can also grow on the lipid cholesterol as a sole source of carbon, and genes involved in the cholesterol use pathway(s) have been validated as important during various stages of the infection lifecycle of &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot;, especially during the chronic phase of infection when other nutrients are likely not available.

PE/PPE gene families. About 10% of the coding capacity is taken up by the &quot;PE&quot;/&quot;PPE&quot; gene families that encode acidic, glycine-rich proteins. These proteins have a conserved N-terminal motif, deletion of which impairs growth in macrophages and granulomas.

Noncoding RNAs. Nine noncoding sRNAs have been characterised in &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot;, with a further 56 predicted in a bioinformatics screen.

Antibiotic resistance genes. In 2013, a study on the genome of several sensitive, ultraresistant, and multiresistant &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; strains was made to study antibiotic resistance mechanisms. Results reveal new relationships and drug resistance genes not previously associated and suggest some genes and intergenic regions associated with drug resistance may be involved in the resistance to more than one drug. Noteworthy is the role of the intergenic regions in the development of this resistance, and most of the genes proposed in this study to be responsible for drug resistance have an essential role in the development of &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot;.

Epigenome. Single-molecule real-time sequencing and subsequent bioinformatic analysis has identified three DNA methyltransferases in &quot;M. tuberculosis,&quot; Mycobacterial Adenine Methyltransferases A (MamA), B (MamB), and C (MamC&quot;). &quot;All three are adenine methyltransferases, and each are functional in some clinical strains of &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot;and not in others.&quot; &quot;Unlike DNA methyltransferases in most bacteria, which invariably methylate the adenines at their targeted sequence, some strains of &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; carry mutations in MamA that cause partial methylation of targeted adenine bases. This occurs as intracellular stochastic methylation, where a some targeted adenine bases on a given DNA molecule are methylated while others remain unmethylated. MamA mutations causing intercellular mosaic methylation are most common in the globally successful Beijing sublineage of &quot;M. tuberculosis.&quot; Due to the influence of methylation on gene expression at some locations in the genome, it has been hypothesized that IMM may give rise to phenotypic diversity, and partially responsible for the global success of Beijing sublineage.

==Evolution==

The &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; complex (MTBC) evolved in Africa and most probably in the Horn of Africa. In addition to &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot;, the MTBC has a number of members infecting various animal species, including &quot;M. africanum&quot;, &quot;M. bovis&quot; (Dassie&#x27;s bacillus), &quot;M. caprae&quot;, &quot;M. microti&quot;, &quot;M. mungi, M. orygis&quot;, and &quot;M. pinnipedii&quot;. This group may also include the &quot;M. canettii&quot; clade. These animal strains of MTBC do not strictly deserve species status, as they are all closely related and embedded in the &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; phylogeny, but for historic reasons, they currently hold species status.

The &quot;M. canettii&quot; clade – which includes &quot;M. prototuberculosis&quot; – is a group of smooth-colony &quot;Mycobacterium&quot; species. Unlike the established members of the &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; group, they undergo recombination with other species. The majority of the known strains of this group have been isolated from the Horn of Africa. The ancestor of &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; appears to be &quot;M. canettii&quot;, first described in 1969.

The established members of the &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; complex are all clonal in their spread. The main human-infecting species have been classified into seven lineages. Translating these lineages into the terminology used for spoligotyping, a very crude genotyping methodology, lineage 1 contains the East African-Indian (EAI), the Manila family of strains and some Manu (Indian) strains; lineage 2 is the Beijing group; lineage 3 includes the Central Asian (CAS) strains; lineage 4 includes the Ghana and Haarlem (H/T), Latin America-Mediterranean (LAM) and X strains; types 5 and 6 correspond to &quot;M. africanum&quot; and are observed predominantly and at high frequencies in West Africa. A seventh type has been isolated from the Horn of Africa. The other species of this complex belong to a number of spoligotypes and do not normally infect humans.

Lineages 2, 3 and 4 all share a unique deletion event (tbD1) and thus form a monophyletic group. Types 5 and 6 are closely related to the animal strains of MTBC, which do not normally infect humans. Lineage 3 has been divided into two clades: CAS-Kili (found in Tanzania) and CAS-Delhi (found in India and Saudi Arabia).

Lineage 4 is also known as the Euro-American lineage. Subtypes within this type include Latin American Mediterranean, Uganda I, Uganda II, Haarlem, X, and Congo.

A much cited study reported that &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; has co-evolved with human populations, and that the most recent common ancestor of the &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; complex evolved between 40,000 and 70,000 years ago. However, a later study that included genome sequences from &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; complex members extracted from three 1,000-year-old Peruvian mummies, came to quite different conclusions. If the most recent common ancestor of the &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; complex were 40,000 to 70,000 years old, this would necessitate an evolutionary rate much lower than any estimates produced by genomic analyses of heterochronous samples, suggesting a far more recent common ancestor of the &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; complex as little as 6000 years ago.

An analysis of over 3000 strains of &quot;M. bovis&quot; from 35 countries suggested an Africa origin for this species.

===Co-evolution with modern humans===
There are currently two narratives existing in parallel regarding the age of MTBC and how it has spread and co-evolved with humans through time. One study compared the &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; phylogeny to a human mitochondrial genome phylogeny and interpreted these as being highly similar. Based on this, the study suggested that &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot;, like humans, evolved in Africa and subsequently spread with anatomically modern humans out of Africa across the world. By calibrating the mutation rate of M. tuberculosis to match this narrative, the study suggested that MTBC evolved 40,000–70,000 years ago. Applying this time scale, the study found that the &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; effective population size expanded during the Neolithic Demographic Transition (around 10,000 years ago) and suggested that &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; was able to adapt to changing human populations and that the historical success of this pathogen was driven at least in part by dramatic increases in human host population density. It has also been demonstrated that after emigrating from one continent to another, a human host&#x27;s region of origin is predictive of which TB lineage they carry, which could reflect either a stable association between host populations and specific &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; lineages and/or social interactions that are shaped by shared cultural and geographic histories.

Regarding the congruence between human and &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; phylogenies, a study relying on &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; and human Y chromosome DNA sequences to formally assess the correlation between them, concluded that they are not congruent. Also, a more recent study which included genome sequences from &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; complex members extracted from three 1,000-year-old Peruvian mummies, estimated that the most recent common ancestor of the &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; complex lived only 4,000 – 6,000 years ago. The &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; evolutionary rate estimated by the Bos et al. study is also supported by a study on Lineage 4 relying on genomic aDNA sequences from Hungarian mummies more than 200 years old. In total, the evidence thus favors this more recent estimate of the age of the MTBC most recent common ancestor, and thus that the global evolution and dispersal of &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; has occurred over the last 4,000–6,000 years.

Among the seven recognized lineages of &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot;, only two are truly global in their distribution: Lineages 2 and 4. Among these, Lineage 4 is the most well dispersed, and almost totally dominates in the Americas. Lineage 4 was shown to have evolved in or in the vicinity of Europe, and to have spread globally with Europeans starting around the 13th century. This study also found that Lineage 4 tuberculosis spread to the Americas shortly after the European discovery of the continent in 1492, and suggests that this represented the first introduction of human TB on the continent (although animal strains have been found in human remains predating Columbus. Similarly, Lineage 4 was found to have spread from Europe to Africa during the Age of Discovery, starting in the early 15th century.

It has been suggested that ancestral mycobacteria may have infected early hominids in East Africa as early as three million years ago.

DNA fragments from &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; and tuberculosis disease indications were present in human bodies dating from 7000 BC found at Atlit-Yam in the Levant.

==Antibiotic resistance (ABR)==

&quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; is a clonal organism and does not exchange DNA via horizontal gene transfer. Despite an additionally slow evolution rate, the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance in &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; poses an increasing threat to global public health. In 2019, the WHO reported the estimated incidence of antibiotic resistant TB to be 3.4% in new cases, and 18% in previously treated cases. Geographical discrepancies exist in the incidence rates of drug-resistant TB. Countries facing the highest rates of ABR TB China, India, Russia, and South Africa. Recent trends reveal an increase in drug-resistant cases in a number of regions, with Papua New Guinea, Singapore, and Australia undergoing significant increases.

Multidrug-resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is characterised by resistance to at least the two front-line drugs isoniazid and rifampin. MDR is associated with a relatively poor treatment success rate of 52%. Isoniazid and rifampin resistance are tightly linked, with 78% of the reported rifampin-resistant TB cases in 2019 being resistant to isoniazid as well. Rifampin-resistance is primarily due to resistance-conferring mutations in the rifampin-resistance determining region (RRDR) within the rpoB gene. The most frequently observed mutations of the codons in RRDR are 531, 526 and 516. However, alternative more elusive resistance-conferring mutations have been detected. Isoniazid function occurs through the inhibition of mycolic acid synthesis through the NADH-dependent enoyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP)-reductase. This is encoded by the &quot;inhA&quot; gene. As a result, isoniazid resistance is primarily due to mutations within inhA and the KatG gene or its promoter region - a catalase peroxidase which is required to activate Isoniazid. As MDR in &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; becomes increasingly common, the emergence of pre-extensively drug resistant (pre-XDR) and extensively drug resistant (XDR-) TB threatens to exacerbate the public health crisis. XDR-TB is characterised by resistance to both rifampin and Isoniazid, as well second-line fluoroquinolones and at least one additional front-line drug. Thus, the development of alternative therapeutic measures is of utmost priority.

An intrinsic contributor to the antibiotic resistant nature of &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; is its unique cell wall. Saturated with long-chain fatty acids or mycolic acids, the mycobacterial cell presents a robust, relatively insoluble barrier. This has led to its synthesis being the target of many antibiotics - such as Isoniazid. However, resistance has emerged to the majority of them. A novel, promising therapeutic target is mycobacterial membrane protein large 3 (MmpL3). The mycobacterial membrane protein large (MmpL) proteins are transmembrane proteins which play a key role in the synthesis of the cell wall and the transport of the associated lipids. Of these, MmpL3 is essential; knock-out of which has been shown to be bactericidal. Due to its essential nature, MmpL3 inhibitors show promise as alternative therapeutic measures in the age of antibiotic resistance. Inhibition of MmpL3 function showed an inability to transport trehalose monomycolate - an essential cell wall lipid - across the plasma membrane. The recently reported structure of MmpL3 revealed resistance-conferring mutations to associate primarily with the transmembrane domain. Although resistance to pre-clinical MmpL3 inhibitors has been detected, analysis of the widespread mutational landscape revealed a low level of environmental resistance. This suggests that MmpL3 inhibitors currently undergoing clinical trials would face little resistance if made available. Additionally, the ability of many MmpL3 inhibitors to work synergistically with other antitubercular drugs presents a ray of hope in combatting the TB crisis.

==Host genetics==
The nature of the host-pathogen interaction between humans and &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; is considered to have a genetic component. A group of rare disorders called Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases was observed in a subset of individuals with a genetic defect that results in increased susceptibility to mycobacterial infection.

Early case and twin studies have indicated that genetic components are important in host susceptibility to &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot;. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified three genetic risk loci, including at positions 11p13 and 18q11. As is common in GWAS, the variants discovered have moderate effect sizes.

==DNA repair==
As an intracellular pathogen, &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; is exposed to a variety of DNA-damaging assaults, primarily from host-generated antimicrobial toxic radicals. Exposure to reactive oxygen species and/or reactive nitrogen species causes different types of DNA damage including oxidation, depurination, methylation, and deamination that can give rise to single- and double-strand breaks (DSBs).

DnaE2 polymerase is upregulated in &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; by several DNA-damaging agents, as well as during infection of mice. Loss of this DNA polymerase reduces the virulence of &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; in mice. DnaE2 is an error-prone DNA repair polymerase that appears to contribute to &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; survival during infection.

The two major pathways employed in repair of DSBs are homologous recombinational repair (HR) and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). Macrophage-internalized &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; is able to persist if either of these pathways is defective, but is attenuated when both pathways are defective. This indicates that intracellular exposure of &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; to reactive oxygen and/or reactive nitrogen species results in the formation of DSBs that are repaired by HR or NHEJ. However deficiency of DSB repair does not appear to impair &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; virulence in animal models.

==History==

&quot;M. tuberculosis&quot;, then known as the &quot;tubercle bacillus&quot;, was first described on 24 March 1882 by Robert Koch, who subsequently received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this discovery in 1905; the bacterium is also known as &quot;Koch&#x27;s bacillus&quot;.

&quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; has existed throughout history, but the name has changed frequently over time. In 1720, though, the history of tuberculosis started to take shape into what is known of it today; as the physician Benjamin Marten described in his &quot;A Theory of Consumption&quot;, tuberculosis may be caused by small living creatures transmitted through the air to other patients.

==Vaccine==
The BCG vaccine (bacille Calmette-Guerin), which was derived from &quot;M. bovis,&quot; while effective against childhood and severe forms of tuberculosis, has limited success in preventing the most common form of the disease today, adult pulmonary tuberculosis. Because of this, it is primarily used in high tuberculosis incidence regions, and is not a recommended vaccine in the United States due to the low risk of infection. To receive this vaccine in the United States, an individual is required to go through a consultation process with an expert in &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; and is only given to those who meet the specific criteria.

Administration of the BCG vaccine has been shown to induced so called &quot;trained immunity&quot;, which refers to the enhanced response of the innate immune system. Unlike adaptive immunity, trained immunity involves long-lasting changes in innate immune cells like monocytes and macrophages, which become more responsive to infections. These changes occur through epigenetic reprogramming, such as histone modifications, leading to increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

Research indicates there may be a correlation between BCG vaccination and better immune response to COVID-19.

The DNA vaccine can be used alone or in combination with BCG. DNA vaccines have enough potential to be used with TB treatment and reduce the treatment time in future.

<text>Peter Dmytruk (May 27, 1920 in Radisson, Saskatchewan – December 9, 1943 at Les Martres-de-Veyre, Puy-de-Dôme, Auvergne Province, Occupied France) was a Sergeant in the Royal Canadian Air Force who was killed fighting with the French Resistance during World War II.

==Life==
Peter Dmytruk was born in Radisson, Saskatchewan in 1920 to a Ukrainian immigrant family. At the outbreak of World War II, Peter Dmytruk was living in Wynyard, Saskatchewan when he joined the Royal Canadian Air Force in July 1941. Following his training, he was shipped overseas where he served as a Halifax tail gunner with 405 Squadron RCAF. During a mission over France, just east of Paris, Flight Sergeant Dmytruk&#x27;s plane was hit by German anti-aircraft fire. He survived the crash and after hiding in the woods, he was protected by locals who put him in touch with members of the French Underground. Dmytruk was led south through German-occupied France towards the escape route through the Pyrenees into Spain. Along the way, he was deeply impacted by the plight of the French people under Nazi occupation and chose not to be smuggled out of the country. Instead, he joined the French Resistance, which dubbed him, &quot;&quot;Pierre le Canadien&quot;.&quot;

Peter Dmytruk&#x27;s duties for the Resistance brought him to the small village of Les Martres-de-Veyre, about 15 kilometers south of Clermont-Ferrand where he gained a reputation amongst his French colleagues as a fearless fighter, undeterred by the ever-present danger. Following the sabotage of a German troop and munitions train, the Germans sent troops into Les Martres-de-Veyre. Normally, the usual Wehrmacht reprisal for such sabotage incidents involved executing all the men in the village. However, on December 9, 1943, Peter Dmytruk was arrested and because it was believed that the notorious &quot;Pierre le Canadien&quot; was responsible for the train sabotage, he was executed on the spot. As a result, the German military believed they had broken the backbone of the local Resistance movement.

==Aftermath==
The people of Les Martres-de-Veyre buried the 23-year-old Peter Dmytruk with honours in the community cemetery. Because of the war, it would be more than a year before the Canadian government could confirm Dmytruk&#x27;s death to his family. Following VE Day, however, he was amongst those individuals almost completely forgotten, as the Canadian people were anxious to put the War behind them.

However, acclaimed as a hero whose selfless courage helped bring freedom to France and whose death saved the life of many residents of Les Martres-de-Veyre, a street was named after him. The Fourth French Republic honoured Dmytruk with the Croix de Guerre and at the end of the War, beginning in 1946 and each year thereafter, the citizens of Les Martres-de-Veyre held a parade and memorial service at his monument. 

Almost thirty years after his death, in August 1972, the surprised mayor of Wynyard, Saskatchewan received a letter from the mayor of Les Martres-de-Veyre, who proposed to honour the slain Canadian airman through the twinning of their two small towns and the creation of a new and larger memorial at Dmytruk&#x27;s gravesite. On the thirtieth anniversary of his death, a 13-person delegation of Dmytruk&#x27;s relatives and officials from Saskatchewan joined the French commemoration ceremony.

In 1999, Peter Dmytruk was awarded the &quot;Nation Builders Awards&quot; that honours the contributions of outstanding Ukrainian Canadians from the Province of Saskatchewan.

<text>Time Gentlemen Please is a British sitcom primarily written by Richard Herring and Al Murray and broadcast on Sky One from 2000 to 2002.

==Premise==
The show is set in a forgotten, unwelcoming pub whose opinionated landlord, &quot;Guv&quot; (short for &quot;The Governor&quot;), has some very old-fashioned views on how a pub, and Britain, should be run. The Governor is an evolution of Al Murray&#x27;s stage persona &quot;The Pub Landlord&quot;, which he had used in stand up since 1994.

== Cast ==

*Al Murray as Guv
*Phil Daniels as Terry
*Jason Freeman as Steve
*Rebecca Front as Vicky Jackson
*Roy Heather as Old Man
*Andrew Mackay as Prof
*Julia Sawalha as Janet (Series 1)
*Emma Pierson as Connie (Series 2)
*Janine Buckley as Lesley
*Jeff Rudom as Leslie
*Marc Bannerman as Greg Thompson

== Characters ==
=== Bar staff ===

* Guv - The landlord of the pub. He sometimes claims to be the owner, but in fact the pub is owned by the brewery and he is a tenant. Just prior to his divorce, his wife took their son and moved to France to be with her new lover, a French pub landlord. He has been involuntarily celibate since, and longs to see his son again. He has a number of politically incorrect views which he sometimes momentarily expresses, for example, the belief that only women are allowed to drink wine. He is a typical example of someone who has been emotionally neglected and shows signs that he has abandonment issues. As a result, he is very temperamental and neurotic to those around him. He idolises the man he imagines his father was, but it is often implied that Guv is the only one who doesn&#x27;t know that his father isn&#x27;t actually his father. He sometimes shows homosexual tendencies, despite being homophobic. In Series 2, he develops a mental condition that he calls &quot;Barman&#x27;s Hand&quot;, which makes him physically incapable of performing any bar related work whenever he tries. He also dreams of having a carvery in his pub, and to be inducted into the fabled &#x27;Grand Order of Barstewards&#x27;. He greatly mourns the death of Princess Diana, which is the only common ground he has with his arch rival and nemesis Greg Thompson. Others are so used to calling him &quot;Guv&quot; (short for &#x27;Governor&#x27;) that they don&#x27;t know his actual name, which he presumes to be a prank. Murray revealed years after the show ended that he and the character share the same name.
* Steve Crosby - Steve is the long term barman who lives in the pub cellar, sleeping on an old mattress between the beer barrels. During the first episode it is revealed that Steve has been working for the Guv for five years and still struggles to remember what the regulars drink and has no barman skills at all. His clumsiness is such that he has run up tens of thousands of pounds of debt by breaking glasses or damaging the pub, payable to the Guv via wage stoppages. Steve is unfazed by the amount he owes and is resigned to the fact whatever happens, goes wrong, or gets broken, he will be expected to pay for it, even on the occasions the damage was someone else&#x27;s fault. He has no friends, other than the pub regulars, and is convinced that Mike the postman is his best mate. He also insists that he is a &quot;temporary&quot; barman until he figures out what he wants to do with his life, but has little motivation to find out what to do next; in fact he becomes distressed when his job is under threat. He is a huge fan of the television show &#x27;Fact Hunt&#x27; and its host &#x27;Cheeky&#x27; Alan Supple along with Ken Tucky, the owner of a fast food chicken shop. He is personally offended when either personality is mimicked, but he enjoys imitating Cheeky&#x27;s trademark &#x27;hair lift&#x27;. He reads comics and most of his understanding of the modern world comes from Guv and &#x27;That&#x27;s Impossible&#x27; magazine, and is therefore wrong. He doesn&#x27;t like Janet and is regularly annoyed by her continual sexual advances towards him, but has an unrequited love for Connie. He is verbally and physically abused by others, usually Guv, but he is loyal to his fellow bar staff. Steve enjoys responding to Ms. Jackson&#x27;s welcoming calls of &quot;hellooo&quot;.
* Janet Wilson - Janet is an Australian backpacker looking for a &quot;temporary&quot; job. As an Australian the Guv (and all the other Landlords) believe her bar skills are far superior to anyone elses as it is &#x27;instinctive&#x27; for an Australian to undertake bar work - in fact he thinks it&#x27;s all they are good for. Janet is desperate to earn enough money to return home, but Guv avoids paying her and this puts her in a catch 22 situation as whether to wait and hope to be paid or just quit and cut her losses. She is foul-mouthed and talks almost constantly in sexual innuendo. She lusts after Steve, but has a relationship with a police surveillance operative after he was sent to investigate drug use in the pub. She hates the attention she gets from Greg Thompson and Mike. She always refers to the Guv as &#x27;Bullet Head&#x27;, due to his shaved, elongated, head. Janet detests Ms. Jackson, who she thinks is fake and uptight and this is exasperated by the fact that Jackson is deliberately rude to her. She makes constant jokes about her &quot;last boyfriend&quot;, usually about his lack of personal hygiene. Said boyfriend eventually comes looking for Janet and causes chaos in the pub. To escape him she quits at the end of Series 1 after he worms his way into the Guv&#x27;s confidence.
* Connie - Connie is the barmaid that replaces Janet. At first, she is refused a job by Guv, so she works for Greg Thompson. But she is taken on by Guv after she frees Steve from Greg&#x27;s cellar and quits. She is constantly hit on by Greg who expresses his desire to marry her. She is a student who is seemingly knowledgeable in all subjects, consistently claiming that she studied it last term. She is prone to bouts of hormonal rage, and is consistently frustrated by all of the other regular characters as she tries to study for her next exam. She is also the only woman not fancied by Terry, but things come to a very unexpected conclusion in Terry&#x27;s house. The Guv is obsessed with imagining her to be innocent and is in denial when he hears her swear or mentions anything lewd. It is revealed, much to the Guv&#x27;s horror, that she used to be a lap dancer and a nude model.
* Gary - Gary is Guv&#x27;s pet and the pub dog. In most episodes, it is revealed that Terry had been barred for doing something to Gary. As a result, Gary is usually seen in some outlandish costume.

===The regulars===
* Terry Brooks, the pub&#x27;s regular alcoholic with an overactive (although rarely fulfilled) sex drive and a bad case of flatulence. Although this is never directly mentioned, he is clearly Guv&#x27;s best friend. He is involved with several running gags. For example, in most episodes Terry manages to sneak back into the pub after being barred for various pranks on Gary (The pub&#x27;s dog), Guv often refers to Terry as the &quot;Master of Disguise&quot; whenever he sneaks back into the pub with a rather obvious alter ego. He is often knocked out in fights with others, and has a sexual fetish towards birds. Upon meeting any woman for the first time (except Connie), Terry will always claim &quot;that is the woman I&#x27;m going to marry&quot;. He has proposed to scores of women over his lifetime but has never actually married due to his chosen fiancée(s) not being aware of that Terry thinks they are engaged. Terry is also very much into self anal play and once ends up in A&amp;E due to a misadventure with a number of potatoes (and a squeaky toy). He is also the first to volunteer tasting food or drink that appears disgusting, and later proclaims it to be &quot;blinding&quot;, as he literally loses his vision.
* &quot;Prof&quot; (real name &quot;Algernon&quot;), a confirmed bachelor with an overbearing mother. He is known for his pseudo-intellectual comments and his skill on the pub&#x27;s punningly named quiz machine (Fact Hunt). His nickname stems simply from the fact that he wears glasses and that he once won two pounds from the Fact Hunt game machine. The Prof leads a double life as both the &quot;notorious railway station flasher&quot; and a gay serial killer, both of which he refers to frequently, though the bar staff and regulars never seem to notice. It is suggested he killed an archaeologist working on a dig site in the pub&#x27;s beer garden and buried him there, after his advances towards the man were rejected. It is also suggested that he is attracted to Guv, but he is just as often uninterested. The Prof hints at the fact that he really does have a massive 12 inch penis.
* &quot;Pops&quot; is a filthy old man with his regular table and strong Catholic beliefs, often wielding a large crucifix. He also claims to be immortal, but says it&#x27;s more of a curse than a blessing. He is known for his catchphrase &#x27;look at his face, it&#x27;s a picture!&#x27;, often after a joke has been played on someone. Little is known about him, but he states in the first episode that he preferred the situation to remain that way. He also blames many of the problems in his life on a faulty prophylactic, which led to the birth of his very troubled and animal hating/ killing son, Stan. He did not fight in World War 2 due to a bad foot, and is sick of people his age going on about what they did in the war. He has had a number of catastrophic car accidents that resulted in him losing his driving licence; he killed two German backpackers (much to the joy of the Guv), his wife died when he crashed into a lorry carrying party poppers, and he destroyed a Brownies campsite.
*Leslie is a huge (over 7 feet according to the Guv) biker type who sits in the corner, with his comparatively diminutive girlfriend Lesley. He almost never speaks but will growl at those who upset him and can only be calmed by an offer of free crisps. Both he and Lesley believe that their drinks are magical and that their glasses never empty; this is due to the Guv&#x27;s complex mechanical contraption to keep their drinks topped up, suggesting they have never once paid for their drinks. This is done to placate Leslie and avoid confrontation. He never harms anyone without permission from Lesley (which he usually receives). He is normally content to sit quietly and watch the events in the bar. On a few occasions, he does show an attachment to Terry. On occasion, Leslie can be seen eavesdropping on the events that happen around the bar. In one episode he temporarily abandoned Lesley in order to pursue Connie who he would call &quot;pretty&quot; and wanted to marry.
*Lesley, is Leslie&#x27;s girlfriend. She is content to sit quietly with Leslie and her Tigger toy, which both of them cherish highly and are extremely protective of. She is only slightly more talkative than Leslie, but she is far more sensitive. She enjoys watching Leslie hurt people, while drinking white wine. At one point she is seduced by Terry and falls for him. She is initially upset when he dumps her, but she quickly realises that the only man for her is Leslie. It is revealed that she and Lesley had their first sexual encounter in the pub car park.

===Other main characters===
* Ms. Vickie Jackson - &quot;Ms&quot; Jackson is the new brewery representative, and the daughter of the brewery owner. She is often looking for ways to increase the number of customers in the pub, always at Guv&#x27;s disapproval. She is extremely eccentric, acting in a bizarre, overly friendly manner. She also makes a lot of references to &#x27;90&#x27;s pop culture, even though she is the only person who gets the references most times. At times she feels a kinship towards the barmaids despite their obvious contempt for her due to her belittling comments. Guv refers to her as &quot;Bloody Ms. Jackson - cow&quot; so often that it becomes a subconscious reflex. At the end of the first series, she has a son to Uncle Barry. She has an identical sister who is a psychiatrist and appears in only one episode and is never mentioned at any other time. She is obviously attracted to Greg Thompson but does not seem to understand his flirting isn&#x27;t sincere.
* &quot;Uncle&quot; Barry, a recovering sexaholic with black hair dye that never dries who is actually, and secretly, the Guv&#x27;s real father. He later fathers a baby with Ms. Jackson after a drunken promotional night across the pub chain. He has a habit of risking his own reputation to help Guv as he feels he has let his &quot;nephew&quot; (son) down. He absolutely detests Greg Thompson and is often vocal about the fact. Barry runs &#x27;The Swan&#x27; public house and frequents the Guv&#x27;s pub, along with Mike and Dave, on several occasions. He also looks after the bar when the Guv has something else on.
* Greg Thompson, currently holds the title of &quot;King Barsteward&quot;. He is also the Landlord for the nearby &#x27;Queen of Hearts&#x27; pub (formally the &#x27;Cock and Beaver&#x27; - the name was changed in memory of Princess Diana, but he thinks the public have now lost interest in her and is planning to rename the pub again once one of the Spice Girls dies). He is a charming ladies&#x27; man, often seen with a lady on each arm, who is violent towards men. He is also shown as a stereotypical bully by preying on the weak but cowering before those that stand up to him. He often uses double entendres to imply he has a large penis, and then immediately informs the listener outright that he was implying it. This leads to women who know him assuming that innocent phrases were meant as innuendos. He then explains that he meant the phrase literally but then acts as they had expected. adding an intentional innuendo and making eventually assuming innocent phrases were intentional innuendoes, which leads to him explaining he meant the phrase literally before behaving as accused. He is fond of snakes and keeps a python. Greg graduated from Landlord Academy with the Guv, whom he calls &quot;Slops&quot; after the latter was caught drinking from a slops tray in the dorm. Greg regards his family as very important; in fact there is &quot;nothing more important than family&quot;. This dedication only lasts so long as it does not drag Greg into any difficult or confrontational encounters. On one occasion it is revealed that Greg has a son but he resents that fact he has to see him once every four weeks and he is not even sure of his name. He is overprotective of the boy after a confrontation with the Guv, but becomes instantly irritated by having to look after him. Greg is very fond of his nephew Kas (who is called Ashley or Gary by some sources) and once again he shows his overprotective nature towards a family member. That is until Kas is arrested for criminal damage, where up on Greg denies all knowledge of him. 
Other Significant Characters:
* Mike and Dave, a pair of landlords who are always seen together. Mike is somewhat of a fool who is always embarrassing Dave. They are also two of the leading members of the Grand Order of Barstewards (with Ms. Jackson, Barry and Greg). They sometimes behave like a couple despite not being in that kind of relationship.
* Mike the &quot;Postie&quot; - Mike (played by co-author, Richard Herring) is a postman who is known in the pub simply as &#x27;Postie&#x27;. He hates Steve, even though Steve thinks they are friends. He fancies Janet, but Janet is turned off by his attitude towards Steve. He is also very sensitive about the shape of his face, because Janet (from whom he seeks approval) always calls him &quot;bean-face&quot;.
* &quot;Fat&quot; Tony &#x27;Arris (aka Moon Man) - Tony is an obese former brewery representative and gave his life and soul to the brewery; he was absolutely distraught at losing his job. He and the Guv had a fairly good working relationship, but the Guv only remained friends with him in the hope that Tony could use his position as a brewery rep to fulfil the Guv&#x27;s dream of owning a carvery. He was also the King Barsteward before he was replaced, by Ms. Jackson, due to health issues. He is typically drunk or otherwise unconscious when he is shown on screen.
* Mr. Jackson - Ms. Jackson&#x27;s father and the owner of the brewery. He is only seen in two episodes, but his presence has a constant effect on Guv, Steve and Ms. Jackson. He expresses himself as a powerful man and he does not tolerate anyone that does not bow to his every whim. He delights in explaining his unique, and prohibitively expensive, multistage method of exacting his vengeance. His favourite meal is rat sandwiches which he claims reminds him of his youth
* Prof&#x27;s Mother - Prof&#x27;s Mother is an unnamed character who acts as a refined, overly religious lady in front of her son, often condemning him for being in the pub. But when Prof is not nearby, she drops her self-righteous facade and is found to be a foul-mouthed harridan.
* Guv&#x27;s Mother - Guv&#x27;s Mother was an abusive parent who frequently cheated on her husband. She resents Guv for being born when he was. One episode reveals that she has had a fling with Barry, Terry and the Prof (despite him being covertly gay) at one time or other. She is normally seen in memory sequences, although she does visit the pub on one occasion, where it becomes apparent that the Guv&#x27;s memories of her are actually very accurate to her true personality.

==Locations==
The exterior shots of the pub were filmed at The Cowshed public house (formerly The Admiral Blake), at the corner of Barlby Rd and Ladbroke Grove, London W10, since demolished and rebuilt as a residential block circa 2013. The name The Cowshed is referred to in Series 2 Episode 3, where the Guv orders a new sign to be made saying the &quot;Cow&#x27;s Head&quot;, after &quot;Ms Jackson, Cow&quot;, but he misspells the name. But he also adds a hand-painted sign of a cow with Miss Jackson&#x27;s face. The pub is always referred to as the &quot;pub by the chemical works&quot;, and its actual name is never referenced in any other episode.

==Episodes==

===Series 1 (2000–2001)===
===Series 2 (2001–2002)===
==After the show==
After the series came to a close, Al Murray has since suggested that his character Guv&#x27;s real name was also Al Murray. This allows him to use the &#x27;Pub Landlord&#x27; character for his stand-up performances. Most of Al Murray&#x27;s appearances are either as the &#x27;Pub Landlord&#x27;, or as an alternative version of himself, usually a slightly more reserved version of the &#x27;Pub Landlord&#x27; character.

In multiple episodes of the series, Guv directly repeats direct lines from Al Murray&#x27;s stand-up shows. In the Christmas Special, Guv repeats the &#x27;When a child is born&#x27; routine from one of Murray&#x27;s tours.

ITV later commissioned a game show called &#x27;Fact Hunt&#x27;. The show was based on the fictional quiz show mentioned repeatedly throughout &#x27;Time Gentlemen Please&#x27;. But instead of being hosted by the character &quot;Cheeky&quot; Alan Supple, it was hosted by the Pub Landlord. Each episode was based on a traditional pub quiz and featured contestants representing different pubs across South England. The first and only series was cancelled after only a few episodes due to low viewership.

ITV would later commission &#x27;Al Murray&#x27;s Happy Hour&#x27;, which again was hosted by Murray in his Pub Landlord character. It was a chat show that was frequently compared to The Graham Norton Show on BBC1. While most guests appeared on the show to publicise something, they rarely got a chance to. Murray would get them to mention the thing once, and then he would mock it as a money-making endeavour, and then he would move on.

Murray would later host his own concept for a game show on Dave. Murray would once again use his Pub Landlord character, but would still use his real name. The show was compared to a higher budget version of &quot;Fact Hunt&quot;. There has only been one series. There are no plans to make future episodes.

==Distribution==
After the show was aired on Sky One it was repeated on Paramount Comedy as it was formerly known. In 2011, Comedy Central Extra bought the rights to repeat some of the first series in a late night slot but have since never repeated the series again. &quot;Time Gentlemen Please&quot; was released onto DVD first in 2006 by Universal entitled &quot;Series 1 Part 1&quot; which included the first six episodes of the first series, it was released on 8 May 2006. After Universal showed no plans to release any further episodes of the series onto DVD, ITV DVD later released a complete collection of the series featuring all 37 episodes on 16 March 2009.

In February 2020, Al Murray started releasing one episode of &quot;Time Gentlemen Please&quot; per week on his official YouTube channel. All episodes have now been uploaded and are available to view.

As of Jan 2024, Time Gentlemen Please can also be found on the Roku streaming channel.

<text>Sky One was a British pay television channel operated and owned by Sky Group (a division of Comcast). Originally launched on 26 April 1982 as Satellite Television, it was Europe&#x27;s first satellite and non-terrestrial channel. From 31 July 1989, it became Sky One and broadcast exclusively in the United Kingdom and Ireland as British Sky Broadcasting&#x27;s flagship channel. It existed until 1 September 2021, when it closed down as part of a restructuring with its EPG position taken by Sky Showcase and much of its content library moved to Sky Max.

Sky One included some very popular original programmes—such as &quot;An Idiot Abroad&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Russell Howard Hour&quot;, &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;—and many imported from North America, including &quot;24&quot; (seasons 3–9, and its spinoff &quot;Live Another Day&quot;), &quot;The X-Files&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;, &quot;Bones&quot; (seasons 1–6, first half), &quot;Caprica&quot;, &quot;Fringe&quot;, &quot;Modern Family&quot;, &quot;Glee&quot; (seasons 3–6), &quot;House&quot; (seasons 5–8), &quot;Lie to Me&quot;, &quot;Lost&quot; (seasons 3–6), &quot;Prison Break&quot; (seasons 3–4), &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Stargate&quot; (&quot;SG-1&quot;, &quot;Atlantis&quot; and &quot;Universe&quot;), &quot;Touch&quot;, &quot;About a Boy&quot;, &quot;The Middle&quot;, &quot;Manifest&quot;, &quot;You, Me and the Apocalypse&quot; and &quot;The Blacklist&quot;. Other American imports included CBS military/action dramas, science-fiction and Arrowverse superhero shows and &quot;The Blacklist&quot; (seasons 4–8).

==History==

===1982–1984: Satellite Television===
Sky One started on 26 April 1982 as Satellite Television Limited, and was Europe&#x27;s first ever cable and satellite channel, originally broadcasting from the Orbital Test Satellite aimed at cable operators all over the continent. At first, the station struggled financially due to disappointing ratings in the countries in which it was officially available, which in turn led to insufficient advertising revenue and increasing difficulty in covering the high transmission costs. Initially, the channel&#x27;s own programming and continuity was played out from the Molinare studios at Fouberts Place in the West End of London.

On 27 June 1983, the shareholders of Satellite Television agreed a £5 million offer to give News International 65% of the company. With the successful launch of the Intelsat V satellite in October 1983 Rupert Murdoch was able to extend the broadcast hours and the number of countries able to receive the signal.

===1984–1989: Sky Channel===

On 16 January 1984, Satellite Television Limited was renamed Sky Channel and finally became available in the UK to Swindon Cable&#x27;s 10,000 subscribers. It began incorporating a large number of American imports in its schedules and also increased the quantity of home-grown productions, including a number of new music shows with Gary Davies, Tony Blackburn, Linda de Mol, Pat Sharp, David &quot;Kid&quot; Jensen, and Anthea Turner presenting programmes such as &quot;Euro Top 40&quot;, and &quot;UK Top 50 Chart&quot;. New children&#x27;s programmes like &quot;Fun Factory&quot; and &quot;The DJ Kat Show&quot;, many of which came not only from Sky&#x27;s own studios in London (Sky having already abandoned the Molinare facilities by then), but also included programmes produced in the Netherlands by John de Mol&#x27;s production company.

On 8 June 1988, Murdoch announced his plans to expand Sky&#x27;s four channels, thus creating the Sky Television Network. On 5 February 1989, the service (Sky Channel, Sky News, Sky Movies and Eurosport) was launched as prime-time broadcasts to European cable operators ended and were replaced by Eurosport, a joint venture between Sky and the European Broadcasting Union aimed at a pan-European audience (like Sky Channel had been up to that point for a time afterwards, some of Sky&#x27;s previous pan-European programming continued to be broadcast before Eurosport&#x27;s start-up, under the branding of &quot;Sky Europe&quot;).

A new raft of shows were created for the channel, including the daily talent show &quot;Sky Star Search&quot;; game shows (&quot;Sale of the Century&quot;, based on the 1980s American version, and &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;); weekly documentary series &quot;Frank Bough&#x27;s World&quot;; daily late night talk show &quot;Jameson Tonight&quot;; agony aunt advice show &quot;A Problem Shared&quot;; and &quot;Sky by Day&quot;, Sky TV&#x27;s variation on ITV&#x27;s more popular &quot;This Morning&quot;, hosted by former BBC Radio 1 DJ Tony Blackburn (who by then had moved to commercial radio) and former &quot;Magpie&quot; presenter Jenny Hanley, as the show aired a mix of entertainment, gossip and fashion.

The &quot;New Sky Channel&quot;, as it was dubbed in on-air promotion prior to its 5 February 1989 launch, continued to broadcast its signature children&#x27;s programmes (&quot;The DJ Kat Show&quot; and &quot;Fun Factory&quot;), and also expanded its daytime programming with six back-to-back soaps (&quot;The Sullivans&quot;, &quot;Another World&quot;, &quot;General Hospital&quot;, &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, &quot;Loving&quot; and &quot;The Young Doctors&quot;) while reducing music programming to only one or two hours per day. Classic sitcoms (&quot;The Lucy Show&quot; and &quot;Family Affair&quot;) and more recent comedies (&quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; and &quot;Family Ties&quot;) as well as put on the schedule along with dramas (&quot;The Streets of San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Trapper John, M.D.&quot;, &quot;Emergency!&quot;, &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, &quot;Voyagers!&quot; and &quot;Eight Is Enough&quot;) were included. Sky Channel also aired classic movies, made-for-TV movies and miniseries (beginning with &quot;Spearfield&#x27;s Daughter&quot; on its first night). Dolly Parton&#x27;s recent variety show &quot;Dolly&quot;, popular Australian science and technology show &quot;Beyond 2000&quot;, the &quot;Nescafé UK Top 50&quot; chart show, Sunday morning religious programme &quot;Hour of Power&quot;, hour-long weekend edition of celebrity news magazine &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; and telecasts of World Wrestling Federation rounded out Sky Channel&#x27;s weekend schedule. Special event programming included late night live telecasts of boxing matches and various music concerts (such as Bon Jovi and Bros in August 1989).

===1989–2021: Sky One===
On 31 July 1989, the channel was renamed Sky One and closed in most European countries, broadcasting only to the British Isles. During September of that year, Sky One began to air more recent programming as an early success being &quot;Moonlighting&quot; (which the BBC had previously screened but not repeated), &quot;ALF&quot; and &quot;Wiseguy&quot;, also aired the British television premiere of a new drama series &quot;21 Jump Street&quot;. Back-to-back soaps (&quot;Rich Man, Poor Man&quot; and &quot;Falcon Crest&quot;) as well as action shows (&quot;Riptide&quot; and &quot;Hunter&quot;) were also added to its prime time schedule. A number of Australian dramas (&quot;Against the Wind&quot;, &quot;Boney&quot;, &quot;A Town Like Alice&quot; and &quot;Barrier Reef&quot;), as well as the soap operas (&quot;Return to Eden&quot;, &quot;Chances&quot;, &quot;E Street&quot; and &quot;Paradise Beach&quot;) were aired. Some Australian children&#x27;s programmes, such as &quot;Skippy the Bush Kangaroo&quot; and &quot;Zoo Family&quot; also aired on Sky One. In 1990 and early 1991 (prior to the launch of Sky Sports), Sky One broadcast numerous live cricket telecasts during which it pre-empted its regularly scheduled programming.

Following the merger with British Satellite Broadcasting&#x27;s Galaxy on 2 November 1990, Sky One also picked up new sitcoms (&quot;Parker Lewis Can&#x27;t Lose&quot;, &quot;Growing Pains&quot;, &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;, &quot;In Living Color&quot;, &quot;Wings&quot; and &quot;Designing Women&quot;), dramas (&quot;China Beach&quot;, &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; and the soap operas, &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; and &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;), reruns of classic sitcoms (&quot;Bewitched&quot; and &quot;The Addams Family&quot;), a new animated series &quot;Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles&quot; was added to children&#x27;s programmes, and daily dating game show &quot;Love at First Sight&quot; was presented by Helen Brumby and Bruno Brookes. Following the daily repeats of &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;Lost in Space&quot;, Sky One picked up a number of science-fiction shows which became a crucial part of its evening line-up such as the UK premiere of &quot;Alien Nation&quot;, also added reruns of &quot;V&quot; (1983 miniseries, &quot;The Final Battle&quot; and the television series) and &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; in 1991. After the 1992 airing of &quot;The Flash&quot;, Sky One also picked up &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; which had previously aired on BBC2 began a long twice per day run of the franchise in a late afternoon and a late evening timeslot on Mondays to Fridays.

A staple of Sky One prime time schedule in its early years were glossy American miniseries such as &quot;Roots&quot;, &quot;Shōgun&quot;, &quot;Masada&quot;, &quot;The Thorn Birds&quot;, &quot;North and South&quot; and &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot;, which aired mostly in two-hour installments each week Sundays to Tuesdays. As the format was beginning to fade in the United States, the miniseries were reduced to two nights in late 1992 and then rescheduled to Tuesdays and Wednesdays in early 1994 under its new title called &quot;Midweek Drama&quot;, before being dropped altogether shortly after that and reappearing only as special event programming. In 1993, Sky One finally replaced its long-running Sunday night drama &quot;21 Jump Street&quot; with exclusive premiere of &quot;The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles&quot; and later &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;. The Sunday night timeslot was ultimately given to new episodes of the hit teen soap &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; which was later paired off with its spin-off &quot;Melrose Place&quot;. After many years in the clear on 1 September of that year, Sky One was encrypted as part of the new Sky Multichannels subscription package, and could no longer be viewed outside Britain and Ireland without exporting a box, or receiving it over cable (although it had already been encrypted for a while since its original launch and first went in the clear in around 1987).

The start of 1995 saw Sky One begin 24-hour broadcasting and initially the overnight hours were filled by music videos. However by the end of the decade, overnight programming consisted of the same range of programmes broadcast at all other times of the day.

On 1 October 1998, Sky One&#x27;s digital feed launched with Sky Digital. Sky One was one of the four last remaining channels on the analogue platform when it was switched off at midnight on 27 September 2001. In 2000, a dedicated feed of Sky One for Ireland was launched for most of this Irish feed&#x27;s existence, the only difference between it and the United Kingdom feed has been differing commercials and programme promotions. In June 2003, the channel started broadcasting in 16:9 widescreen. However, all television commercials were broadcast in 4:3 until 21 November 2005, because they were played off the same servers for all Sky channels, many of which were not broadcast in widescreen.

On 25 August 2012, Stuart Murphy, director of Sky entertainment channels, announced that a one-hour timeshift of Sky One and Sky Atlantic will due to start in the autumn, with the former launching on 12 November of that year. For New Year&#x27;s Day 2014 (1 January), Sky One was temporarily renamed Sky Onesie aiming &quot;to encourage viewers to snuggle up in front of the television wearing onesies, in a bid to recover from the previous night&#x27;s celebrations&quot;. In 2017, Sky One began broadcasting some sports coverage. This included a partial simulcast of &quot;Soccer Saturday&quot;, highlights of, and occasional live coverage of, Formula One motor racing and the occasional live football match. The summer of 2019 saw Sky One show highlights of the 2019 Cricket World Cup and live coverage of England&#x27;s matches in the 2019 Netball World Cup.

====2004 programme relaunch====

Sky One&#x27;s programme lineup was relaunched at the start of 2004, with Sky television head Dawn Airey stating the channel had become too associated with &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, science fiction shows such as &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;, &quot;Andromeda&quot; and &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; (the latter of which continues to be shown extensively on Sky Max, Sky Mix and Sky Sci-Fi to this day) and raunchy factual entertainment shows such as &quot;the LWT-produced&quot; &quot;Ibiza Uncovered&quot;. 

The channel was also struggling to acquire new American series, as FTA broadcasters had become familiar with Sky&#x27;s tricks to buy the majority of US programming, with Channel 4 picking up the likes of &quot;The Sopranos&quot; and &quot;Without a Trace&quot; on an exclusive basis (although both programmes have since aired on Sky Atlantic) and Five picking up the likes of &quot;The Shield&quot; and the &quot;CSI&quot; franchise, which was at the peak of its popularity during this period. 

Other competitors in the pay TV field also latched on to this, with LivingTV nabbing the likes of &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;, &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;, &quot;Joan of Arcadia&quot;, &quot;Charmed&quot;, and later the likes of &quot;Boston Legal&quot; and &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, and Hallmark Channel, which acquired &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; (whilst Sky One held the rights to the original &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;).

Newly appointed controller of Sky One, Sara Ramsden, struck a deal with Warner Bros. International Television Distribution to acquire five new US dramas: mainly the medical drama &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot; (which Sky acquired the first-run pay TV rights to after Channel 4 had already bought the FTA rights) and the CBS police procedural drama &quot;Cold Case&quot;. The channel also poached the popular espionage drama 24 after finding success on BBC Two for its first two seasons. Other new shows acquired by Sky One for 2004 included &quot;Las Vegas&quot; and as part of the WB deal, &quot;Tarzan and Jane&quot;, the unproduced &quot;Fearless&quot; and &quot;Skin&quot;.

====Sky Two and Sky Three====
The success of the channel led to the launch of a sister service Sky 2 on 1 September 1996, broadcasts more first-run programmes between 7:00 pm and 6:00 am only. The spin-off channel was not a success as it was closed on 31 August 1997, which was replaced by the UK&#x27;s version of National Geographic from the following day, and Sky One reverts back to its original name.

On 9 December 2002, the channel was relaunched as Sky One Mix. On 21 September 2004, the channel was renamed Sky Mix. On 31 October 2005, Sky Mix was renamed Sky Two with the launch of a second sister channel Sky Three.

Sky Two was renamed Sky Replay on 27 August 2020, and Sky Three was renamed Pick on 28 February 2011. On 3 October 2023, it was announced that Pick will rebrand as Sky Mix on 18 October of that year.

====High-definition====
To coincide with the launch of Sky HD, Sky One HD began broadcasting on 22 May 2006. The channel is a simulcast of Sky One and screens high-definition versions of some of the channel&#x27;s programming, which include &quot;Lost&quot;, &quot;Bones&quot;, &quot;24&quot;, &quot;WWE SmackDown&quot;, &quot;Fringe&quot;, &quot;Prison Break&quot;, &quot;House&quot;, and most recently new episodes of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. Programmes that are not available in HD are &quot;upscaled&quot; (although Sky One showed its widescreen version of the television show &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot;, unlike most American broadcasts, since the film was originally filmed on Panavision widescreen film but cropped to full-screen by most broadcasters. This airing of the show preserves the film&#x27;s appearance without stretching or upscaling, although some scenes were compromised for widescreen and had to be upscaled).

Sky stated that they intended to increase the amount of HD content they show, and hoped that by the end of 2008, two-thirds of all prime time shows, and 90% of their own original commissions, would be in HD. A new logo was introduced along with the rebrand on 31 August 2008.

On 1 October 2010, Sky1 HD launched on Virgin Media channel 122, with Sky2 moving to channel 123 and Sky3 moving to channel 180 on 22 September 2010, to make way for the new service.

====Virgin Media dispute====

On 1 March 2007 at midnight, Sky&#x27;s basic channels – which included Sky One, Sky Two, Sky Three, Sky News, Sky Sports News, Sky Travel and Sky Travel Extra – were removed from the Virgin Media cable television services after a dispute from BSkyB. This was due to the expiry of their previous carriage agreement and the companies&#x27; inability to reach a new deal. Virgin issued legal proceedings against Sky over the dispute in April 2007.

At the beginning of March 2008, the two companies were reported to have resumed discussions over the dispute. Virgin chief executive Neil Berkett was reported as saying they had &quot;continued interest in securing Sky basics back on our platform&quot;. The resumed talks had followed shortly after both Virgin and BSkyB had launched appeals against a recent Competition Appeal Tribunal ruling on BSkyB&#x27;s 17.9% stake in ITV plc.

On 4 November 2008, a carriage deal between BSkyB and Virgin Media was reached and BSkyB&#x27;s channels were available on Virgin&#x27;s cable service from 13 November of that year. The Sky basic channels were spread across each tier of Virgin&#x27;s cable television service: Sky Three and Sky News were made available in the lowest M tier; Sky Sports News joined the M+ tier; Sky One and Sky Two were made available in the L tier; and Sky Arts 1, Sky Arts 2, Sky Real Lives and Sky Real Lives 2 joined the XL tier.

====Closure====
It was announced on 27 July 2021 that Sky One would be retired and that a new channel, Sky Showcase would replace its EPG slot on Sky. Another channel, Sky Max would launch on the same day. Most of Sky&#x27;s original content and the drama output would move there, while most of the comedy output would move to Sky Comedy. &quot;Prodigal Son&quot; was the channel&#x27;s last programme.

At the time of closure, it was available via digital satellite on Sky, digital cable on Virgin Media, IPTV on TalkTalk TV and online via Sky Go and Now. In the Republic of Ireland, the channel was available via Sky Ireland, Virgin Media Ireland and Eir Vision.

===Continuity announcers===

Bruce Hammal was the station&#x27;s continuity announcer from 1984 to 1997.
Absolute Radio DJ Claire Sturgess has been a &quot;voice&quot; of Sky One since 1998, and was the sole announcer from 2001 until 2005. As one of Sky One&#x27;s four announcers, her voice-overs are pre-recorded once a week and played out by an automated system. 

Live continuity announcements air each evening. In 2009, they were voiced by announcers Dave Kelly, Faye Bamford and Philippa Collins. In 2010, three new continuity announcers were hired, Katie Morton, Katie Hudson and Paul Daniels, replacing all the previous announcers. In 2011, two new part-time announcers were hired. During the day, pre-recorded announcements air, promoting shows from all the different Sky channels.

===Former logos===
==Programming==
===1980s and 1990s===
Sky commissioned many homegrown programmes since it first started broadcasting back in 1984, but it was not until 1989 when content went beyond music and children&#x27;s shows.

During the early years in commissioned some new game shows including:

* &quot;Sale of the Century&quot; 
* &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; 
* &quot;Love at First Sight&quot; 
* &quot;Wife of the Week&quot; 
* &quot;Anything for Money&quot;

* &quot;Through the Keyhole&quot; 
* &quot;Beat the Crusher&quot; 
* &quot;Prickly Heat&quot; 
* &quot;Dating Hell&quot; 
The channel commissioned a number of home grown programmes (for example, dramas such as &quot;The Wanderer&quot;, &quot;Springhill&quot;, &quot;Dream Team&quot; and &quot;Space Island One&quot;) while expanding its small number of Australian television series, notably include:
* &quot;Chances&quot; 
* &quot;E Street&quot; 
* &quot;Paradise Beach&quot; 

===2000s and 2010s===
Sky One focused in science-fiction and other series in the 2000s which did not have a lot of successes, including:
* &quot;The Strangerers&quot;, a science-fiction sitcom show about two aliens on Earth, that was dropped after one series and never repeated
* Al Murray&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Time Gentlemen Please&quot;
* &quot;Baddiel&#x27;s Syndrome&quot;, a sitcom starring David Baddiel
* &quot;Hex&quot;, another science-fiction show which was cancelled in April 2006
* &quot;Mile High&quot;, which only lasted from 2003 to 2005
* Sky also co-produced &quot;The 4400&quot; and co-financed the first series of &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; in 2004
* &quot;Dream Team&quot;, about a fictional football team

Sky One also screened reality television shows such as:

* &quot;Cruise with Stelios&quot;
* &quot;Road Wars&quot;
* &quot;Shock Treatment&quot;
* &quot;World&#x27;s Deadliest Gangs&quot;
* &quot;Pineapple Dance Studios&quot;
* &quot;World of Pain&quot;
* &quot;Road Raja&quot;
* &quot;Uncovered&quot;
* &quot;Cirque de Celebrité&quot;


The channel received relative success with scientific shows such as:
* &quot;&quot; and spin-offs
** &quot;Brainiac&#x27;s Test Tube Baby&quot; 
* &quot;Mission Implausible&quot;

Sky One commissioned a two-part &quot;Terry Pratchett&#x27;s Hogfather&quot; series for Christmas 2006, this proved to be successful and so in 2008, Sky brought out an adaptation of &quot;The Colour of Magic&quot; and its second half &quot;The Light Fantastic&quot;. On 30 May 2010, Sky One also released &quot;Terry Pratchett&#x27;s Going Postal&quot;, the 33rd book in the &quot;Discworld&quot; series.

Sky One had also re-commissioned a number of earlier game shows including &quot;Blockbusters&quot;, which brought the series back once again between 30 October 2000 and 23 March 2001 was produced by Grundy (now owns the format) and presented by Liza Tarbuck, but did not capture the same degree of popularity as the Holness incarnation. The most recent game show was from Mark Burnett&#x27;s &quot;Are You Smarter than a 10 Year Old?&quot;, based on a United States format. On 30 January 2008, Sky One announced plans to bring back the British 1990s combat-based game show &quot;Gladiators&quot;, which was subsequently cancelled on 12 April 2009. They also showed the sketch show &quot;Harry Enfield&#x27;s Brand Spanking New Show&quot;.

In 2010, Sky One focused on commissioning several quite long-running or well known comedy infused shows, starting with &quot;A League of Their Own&quot;, &quot;An Idiot Abroad&quot; and &quot;Little Crackers&quot;. In 2011, Sky One premiered supermarket sitcom &quot;Trollied&quot;, which had broadcast six series and over 50 episodes, becoming Sky One&#x27;s longest running comedy series. Not all shows were well received, at least by its home country audience, including &quot;Parents&quot; which was broadcast in 2012 and was not popular, leading Sky not to commission it for a second series. &quot;Moone Boy&quot;, a series written by and starring Chris O&#x27;Dowd, first screened in 2012, became an instant hit internationally. It lasted three series, and ended in 2015.

In 2017, Sky One stopped showing factual content and moved to showing more comedy and drama programmes as well as selected sports coverage.

===Music===

In 1994, Sky One started their own music show called &quot;The Coca Cola Hit Mix&quot; (also known as &quot;The Hit Mix&quot;) hosted by Terry Christian, featuring music news and guests at the time. The show featured regular competitions, phone-ins with guests and other features. This later evolved into a late night broadcast called &quot;Hit Mix Long Play&quot; which would broadcast simultaneously on both Sky One and Sky Two playing music videos from various genres; the show also featured themed topics such as &quot;Step by Step&quot; which would feature music videos with stairs in the song or video when the scheduled programming had finished. This became a popular part of the brand and would often have exclusive first play on new releases that week.

A later expansion of the music brand would be Sky One&#x27;s &quot;Morning Glory&quot; show which would feature music videos in the early morning before the scheduled programming would start, which also featured various themes as well as caller requests.

===Films===
Sky One occasionally screened feature films which were shown with advertisement breaks, as well as several premium movie channels including Sky Cinema and its sister services.

===American imports===
The channel became known for its first-run American imports such as: &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, &quot;Rescue 911&quot;, &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot;, &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; and &quot;South Park&quot;, as well as some older programmes included &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;, &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, &quot;Quantum Leap&quot; and Lucille Ball&#x27;s various comedy series. It relies heavily on screenings for this network as they coming from Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s Fox Broadcasting Company with other shows like &quot;The X-Files&quot;, &quot;In Living Color&quot;, &quot;Cops&quot;, &quot;Millennium&quot;, &quot;King of the Hill&quot;, &quot;Futurama&quot;, &quot;Family Guy&quot; and &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot;. Another early and long-running fixture was &quot;Married... with Children&quot; ran all through the 1990s, but in the early 2000s as the show suddenly disappeared from its regular schedule and has not been screened on any Sky channel since.

Sky One was also the original home to the UK&#x27;s first-run showings of &quot;ER&quot; and &quot;Friends&quot; for series 4–6 of both shows (Channel 4 had shown series 1–3 first), giving Sky One some of the highest ratings for any satellite channel. In 2000, 2.8 million viewers watched an episode of &quot;Friends&quot;, the highest-rated show on this network. However, when Channel 4 launched their own digital sister service E4 they outbid Sky One for exclusive first-run rights to both shows. However, Sky One still held the repeat rights for the early series of both shows for several years. Since 2011, &quot;Friends&quot; has been shown on Comedy Central.

====WWF/WWE====
From 1989, Sky Channel (later Sky One) was the home of World Wrestling Federation in the UK. Certain special events such as Royal Rumble, UK Rampage and This Tuesday in Texas aired on Sky One, whilst a live broadcast of WrestleMania VI and others include SummerSlam and Survivor Series, shown on taped delay a number of days after the events were recorded, aired on Sky Movies.

Sky moved all the special events to Sky Movies in 1991, before they transferred to Sky Sports on 1 September 1992 when the channel became a subscription service. From 1995, subscribers to the Sky Sports channel would see not only a taped delay showing of these pay-per-view events, but Sky also offered a live showing starting a midnight UK time on the evening the event took place. Sky One continued to air WWF/WWE shows on Friday night and Saturday/Sunday morning that were produced for syndicated television in the United States from the early 1990s until the late 2010s. Sky Sports aired &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot; and later &quot;SmackDown&quot; alongside all pay-per-view events and required an additional subscription to be able to view the Sports package, this led to the WWF/WWE content on Sky One being available to more viewers in the UK than the shows that aired only on Sky Sports.

While WWF/WWE pay-per-view events aired on Sky Sports, other shows include &quot;Superstars&quot;, &quot;Wrestling Challenge&quot;, &quot;All American Wrestling&quot;, &quot;Action Zone&quot;, &quot;Mania&quot;, &quot;LiveWire&quot;, &quot;Shotgun&quot; and &quot;Metal&quot; which aired on Saturday or Sunday exclusively on Sky One with repeats throughout the week on the channel. These were often shows edited for younger viewers to fit the timeslot (especially during the riskier content of the Attitude era) and had dubbed commentary especially for the UK audience. 

Sky One continued to broadcast an edited one hour version of &quot;Raw&quot; on Sunday mornings before all WWE programmes moved to rival network BT Sport, which later rebranded as TNT Sports on 18 July 2023.

====&quot;The Simpsons&quot;====
On 2 September 1990, Sky One launched the hit American animated series &quot;The Simpsons&quot; which became a signature show and aired continuously on the channel for 31 years until it was ceased in 2021 (as well as the Sunday morning religious programme &quot;Hour of Power&quot; was another to remain the schedule during most of its run), it had a long association within the series from its early years and was used extensively in the channel&#x27;s advertising campaigns. Sky One aired new episodes of the show on Sunday nights, later switching to Friday nights from 2010, whilst older episodes were shown in double bill slots on weeknights for many years, and on some occasions, as many as four episodes would be shown back-to-back on weeknights, usually with some kind of theme connecting them in some way.

Sky One was the exclusive British broadcaster of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; until it made its terrestrial debut on the BBC from 23 November 1996, where it continued until 7 May 2004, having lost the rights to Channel 4 on 18 February 2002. Typically, Channel 4 premieres episodes around three or four years after they have first aired on Sky One.

On 17 March 2009, Sky One broadcast the 20th season episode &quot;In the Name of the Grandfather&quot; for the first time – five days before its original US airing – to be shown in the United Kingdom as gathered over one million viewers. Sky One had also aired episodes within three days after its US first-run, including &quot;Judge Me Tender&quot; on 27 May 2010. In November 2012, &quot;The Simpsons&quot; was not broadcast on the timeshift service because BSkyB is prohibited from doing so under the current terms of their licensing agreement with 20th Century Fox Television Distribution included an on-screen message appears redirecting viewers to Sky One. As of 2017, &quot;The Simpsons&quot; is available to watch on the timeshifted channel.

Following the death of voice actress Marcia Wallace, Sky One broadcasts three of best episodes from 6:30 pm including &quot;Bart the Lover&quot;, &quot;The Ned-Liest Catch&quot; and &quot;Ned &#x27;n&#x27; Edna&#x27;s Blend Agenda&quot; on 28 October 2013.

Since the closure of Sky One, episodes of the show have continued to be broadcast regularly on Sky Showcase.

====&quot;Star Trek&quot;====
Sky One obtained the first-run rights for &quot;Star Trek&quot; on 1 July 1990, which previously had been with the BBC. During its entire run of &quot;The Original Series&quot;, Sky One had chosen three episodes – &quot;Plato&#x27;s Stepchildren&quot;, &quot;The Empath&quot; and &quot;Whom Gods Destroy&quot; – as well as the unseen pilot were eventually shown on satellite television, but not screened by the BBC between 19 August 1992 and 19 January 1994 for similar reasons following audience complaints after broadcast.

&quot;The Next Generation&quot; was initially shown five nights a week at 5:00 pm (repeated again at 10:30 pm) between 5 October 1992 and 16 August 1993, starting with &quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot; and running all the way up to &quot;Timescape&quot;. The channel also acquired rerun rights to the episodes from the first three seasons previously aired on BBC2 – with the addition of &quot;The High Ground&quot;, which saw its first British broadcast on 29 November 1992 with the Irish reunification line edited out, and a feature-length version of &quot;Unification&quot; was shown for an exclusive movie channel on 7 March 1993 rather than as part of this entire run. The whole series was shown again with &quot;Descent&quot; held over to act as the premiere to the seventh season on 31 July 1994, which was run every Sunday evenings at 7:00 pm once it had completed production and was available to be shown before the last-ever episode aired on 29 January 1995.

Sky One also bought the first-run rights for other &quot;Star Trek&quot; shows:
* &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; 
* &quot;Voyager&quot; 
* &quot;Enterprise&quot; 

The episodes of these later series were shown as they were in the United States with repeats between new ones, however soon held back broadcast the entire series at once, as well as various science-fiction shows that would fill the gaps including &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; and &quot;Andromeda&quot;. It was moved to Sky Two for a short time, until the channel was ceased on 31 August 1997 due to poor ratings.

<text>Cheongju (; ) is the capital and largest city of North Chungcheong Province in South Korea.

==History==
Cheongju has been an important provincial town since ancient times. In the Cheongju Mountains, particularly in the area where Sangdang Sanseong is located, ruins dating from the Old Stone Age to the Bronze Age have been discovered. Settlements associated with the Paleolithic Age have also been found in Cheongju, such as the Durubong Cave Site.

After the unification of the kingdoms by Silla in 676, various parts of Korea, including Cheongju, began to adopt Buddhism. This was influenced by the Silla culture&#x27;s connection with the Silk Road, which facilitated the spread of Buddhism from Nepal across Northern China to the Korean Peninsula. During the Goryeo era, particularly during the reign of Gwangjong, several monuments related to Buddhism were created. Among them is Cheol Danggan, built in the year 962 in the center of the city near the remains of Yongdu Temple. Cheol Danggan is a flagpole used to hang the Dang flag, which is raised to pay tribute to Buddha. It was listed as a National Treasure in 1962 by the South Korean government. In the Joseon period, the Cheongju region began to adopt Confucianism as its main religion.

Throughout the history of Cheongju, various temples were established during different periods in the history of the Korean peninsula. Examples include the Buddhist Yonghwasa Temple, dating back to the Goryeo period, and the Bulguksa Temple, established in the 8th century during the Silla Dynasty period. Cheongju temples were also significant in the advancement of Korean printing, including book printing. One of the important documents printed in Cheongju was done so at Heungdeok Temple during the Goryeo Dynasty, specifically in the year 1377.

One of the first schools established in North Chungcheong Province was founded in Cheongju during 1896. During the Baekje Dynasty period, several tombs were built around the city, in addition to Joseon Dynasty period forts such as Sangdangsanseong, which served to connect the northern and southern provinces after the Japanese invasion of 1592.

In 1593, the Battle of Cheongju took place between Japanese forces and the Joseon kingdom that then ruled the Korean peninsula during the Hideyoshi&#x27;s Invasions of Korea, in which more than 8,000 Korean warrior monks participated.

The government of the province relocated here from Chungju in 1908. The opening of the Chungbuk-line in 1926 sparked regional development. In 1946, Cheongju and Cheongwon-gun were separated, and in 1949, Cheongju was made a city. Afterwards, it went through the separation of administrative dong and their transfer to Cheongwon-gun, with 2 branch offices (East and West) established in July 1989 that were upgraded to Sangdang District and Heungdeok District in January.

Cheongju experienced one of the largest population growths in Korea, having almost quadrupled its population from 147,000 in 1970 to 582,158 in 2000.

==Geography==

Geum River goes through the center of Cheongju. Additionally, the tributaries of Musim and Miho flow together in the northern part of the city. To the east and west, there are the mountains of Wuam and Bumo. Musimcheon River also goes through the middle of Cheongju.

===Climate===
Cheongju is a temperate zone, so there are four seasons. The climate is a humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dwa&quot;), but can be considered a borderline humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cwa&quot;) using the isotherm.

*Sangdangsanseong (Sangdang Mountain Fortress) lies on the slopes of Mt. Uam within the city limits. The fortress is mainly a wall that stretches over in circumference. The present walls date to the 1716 restoration of the site. Within the walls lies a small tourist village that has several restaurants.
*Cheongju National Museum also lies near Mt. Uam, and houses several exhibits of cultural artifacts from the nearby area.
*Heungdeoksa Temple Site is the home to the Early Printing Museum, and is to be the site of the printing of Jikji, the oldest existent book printed using movable metal type. The museum itself contains exhibits related to the art of printing through the ages.
*Yongdusaji Cheoldanggan (The Iron Flagpole of the Yongdu Temple Site) is designated Korean National Treasure number 41, and is located near Lotte Department Store in downtown Cheongju. Made of twenty iron cylinders, the flagpole stands tall, and was formerly used to hang flags to honour the Buddha.
*National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art – Cheongju (MMCA Cheongju) which is scheduled to open in December 2018, will be the first museum in Korea to open its conservation center to the general public. Notably, MMCA Cheongju is being constructed within a renovated tobacco factory, which once played a major role in Korea&#x27;s modern industry. The new building has been especially designed to use energy more efficiently and thus reduce greenhouse gas emissions. As such, the new museum will be a high-profile example of a project combining elements of urban revitalization and historical preservation.
*Chojeonghaenggung (Chojeong Temporary Palace) is a temporary palace where King Sejong stayed for treatment of an eye disease. It is said that King Sejong completed the creation of Hangul here. This place was destroyed during the Joseon Dynasty, and restoration work began in December 2017, and construction was completed in December 2019. It opened in June 2020. Also, Chojeong Mineral Water produced near here is quite famous carbonated water. It is known that King Sejong also tried to treat an eye disease with carbonated water produced in Chojeong. Chojeonghaenggung is located in Naesu-eup, Cheongwon District.

<text>Memorization (British English: memorisation) is the process of committing something to memory. It is a mental process undertaken in order to store in memory for later recall visual, auditory, or tactical information.

The scientific study of memory is part of cognitive neuroscience, an interdisciplinary link between cognitive psychology and neuroscience.

== Development ==

Within the first three years of a child&#x27;s life, they begin to show signs of memory that is later improved into their adolescent years. This includes short-term memory, long-term memory, working memory, and autobiographical memory. Memory is a fundamental capacity that plays a special role in social, emotional, and cognitive functioning. Problems with studying the development of memorization include having to use verbal response and confirmation.

==Techniques==

Some principles and techniques that have been used to assist in memorization include:

=== Rote learning ===

Rote learning is a learning technique which focuses not on understanding but on memorization by means of repetition. For example, if words are to be learned, they may be repeatedly spoken aloud or repeatedly written down. Specialized forms of rote learning have also been used in Vedic chant since as long as three thousand years ago, to preserve the intonation and lexical accuracy of very long texts, some with tens of thousands of verses.

=== Spaced repetition ===

Spaced repetition is a principle of committing information into long-term memory by means of increasing time intervals between subsequent review of the previously learned material. Spaced repetition exploits the psychological spacing effect. This technique is combined with active recall by spaced repetition software such as SuperMemo, Anki or Mnemosyne.

=== Active recall ===

Active recall is a learning method that exploits the testing effect − the fact that memorization is more efficient when some time is devoted to actively retrieving the to-be-learned information through testing with proper feedback. Flashcards are a practical application of active recall. Another method for memorization is via the &#x27;SURF&#x27; process (SURF is an acronym standing for: spotting &#x27;Sonic patterns&#x27;, &#x27;Understanding&#x27; the text, &#x27;Repetition/Recall/Rehearsal&#x27;, &#x27;Familiarity&#x27;) which uses specific cyclic forms of active recall to, for instance, memorize poems for public performance.

=== Mnemonic ===

A mnemonic is a type of memory aid. Mnemonics are often verbal, such as a very short poem or a special word used to help a person remember something, particularly lists, but they may be visual, kinesthetic or auditory. Mnemonics rely on associations between easy-to-remember constructs which can be related back to the data that is to be remembered. This is based on the principle that the human mind much more easily remembers spatial, personal, surprising, sexual or humorous or otherwise meaningful information than arbitrary sequences.

=== Mnemonic link system ===

A mnemonic link system is a method of remembering lists, based on creating an association between the elements of that list. For example, if one wished to remember the list (dog, envelope, thirteen, yarn, window), one could create a link system, such as a story about a &quot;dog stuck in an envelope, mailed to an unlucky black cat playing with yarn by the window&quot;. It is then argued that the story would be easier to remember than the list itself. Alternatively one could use visualisation, seeing in one&#x27;s mind&#x27;s eye an image that includes two elements in the list that are next to each other. One could imagine a dog inside a giant envelope, then visualise an unlucky black cat (or whatever that reminds the user &#x27;thirteen&#x27;) eating a huge envelope. In order to access a certain element of the list, one needs to &quot;traverse&quot; the system (much in the same vein as a linked list), in order to get the element from the system.

=== Mnemonic peg system ===

A peg system is a technique for memorizing lists. It works by pre-memorizing a list of words that are easy to associate with the numbers they represent (1 to 10, 1-100, 1-1000, etc.). Those objects form the &quot;pegs&quot; of the system. Then in the future, to rapidly memorize a list of arbitrary objects, each one is associated with the appropriate peg. Generally, a peglist only has to be memorized one time, and can then be used over and over every time a list of items needs to be memorized. The peglists are generated from words that are easy to associate with the numbers (or letters). Peg lists created from letters of the alphabet or from rhymes are very simple to learn, but are limited in the number of pegs they can produce.

=== Mnemonic major system ===

The major system is a mnemonic technique used to aid in memorizing numbers which is also called the phonetic number system or phonetic mnemonic system. It works by converting numbers first into consonant sounds, then into words by adding vowels. The words can then be remembered more easily than the numbers, especially when using other mnemonic rules which call for the words to be visual and emotive.

=== Method of loci ===

The method of loci or mind palace is a technique for memorizing practiced since classical antiquity which is a type of mnemonic link system based on places (loci, otherwise known as locations). It is often used where long lists of items need to be memorized. The technique was taught for many centuries as a part of the curriculum in schools, enabling an orator to easily remember a speech or students to easily remember many things at will.

=== Art of memory ===

The art of memory is a group of mnemonic principles and techniques used to organize memory impressions, improve recall, and assist in the combination and &#x27;invention&#x27; of ideas. This group of principles was usually associated with training in Rhetoric or Logic from the time of Ancient Greece, but variants of the art were employed in other contexts, particularly the religious and the magical. Techniques commonly employed in the art include the association of emotionally striking memory images within visualized locations, the chaining or association of groups of images, the association of images with schematic graphics or &quot;notae&quot; (&quot;signs, markings, figures&quot; in Latin), and the association of text with images. Any or all of these techniques were often used in combination with the contemplation or study of architecture, books, sculpture and painting, which were seen by practitioners of the art of memory as externalizations of internal memory images and/or organization.

=== Other techniques ===

*It has been shown that sleep aids memory; this applies to naps as well.
*Dramatizing the information that needs to be memorized will help you remember it more. If said in an exaggerated and dramatic manner it will most likely not be forgotten, 
*The &quot;desirable difficulty&quot; is a principle based on a theory which suggests that people remember things better when their brains have to overcome minor obstacles to catch the information. For example, the font Sans forgetica is based on this principle, according to a small study.
* Pythagorean Method of Memorization

==Improving==
Although maintenance rehearsal (a method of learning through repetition, similar to rote learning) can be useful for memorizing information for a short period of time, studies have shown that elaborative rehearsal, which is a means of relating new material with old information in order to obtain a deeper understanding of the content, is a more efficient means of improving memory. This can be explained by the levels-of-processing model of memory which states that the more in-depth encoding a person undergoes while learning new material by associating it with memories already known to the person, the more likely they are to remember the information later.

Another useful way to improve memorization is to use chunking, a method in which a person categorizes the information they are trying to memorize into groups. For example, a person wishing to memorize a long sequence of numbers can break the sequence up into chunks of three, allowing them to remember more of the numbers. Similarly, this is how many in North America memorize telephone numbers, by breaking them up into the three sections: an area code, followed by a three-digit number and then a four-digit number. If a list of words is to be memorized, using chunking, the words could be broken up into groups based on their starting letter or based on their category (ex: Months of the year, types of food, etc.).
