<text>The pomelo ( ; Citrus maxima), also known as a shaddock, is the largest citrus fruit. It is an ancestor of several cultivated citrus species, including the bitter orange and the grapefruit. It is a natural, non-hybrid, citrus fruit, native to Southeast Asia. Similar in taste to a sweet grapefruit, the pomelo is commonly eaten and used for festive occasions throughout Southeast and East Asia. As with the grapefruit, phytochemicals in the pomelo have the potential for drug interactions.

== Description ==

The pomelo tree may be tall, possibly with a crooked trunk thick, and low-hanging, irregular branches. Their leaf petioles are distinctly winged, with alternate, ovate or elliptic shapes long, with a leathery, dull green upper layer, and hairy under-leaf. The flowers – single or in clusters – are fragrant and yellow-white in color.

The fruit is large, in diameter, usually weighing . It has a thicker rind than a grapefruit, and is divided into 11 to 18 segments. The flesh tastes like mild grapefruit, with a little of its common bitterness (the grapefruit is a hybrid of the pomelo and the orange). The enveloping membranes around the segments are chewy and bitter, considered inedible, and usually discarded. There are at least sixty varieties. The fruit generally contains a few, relatively large seeds, but some varieties have numerous seeds. The physical and chemical characteristics of pomelo vary widely across South Asia.

== History ==

=== Ancestral &quot;Citrus&quot; species ===

The pomelo is significant botanically as one of the three major wild ancestors of several cultivated hybrid &quot;Citrus&quot; species, including the bitter orange and the grapefruit; and less directly also of the lemon, the sweet orange, and some types of mandarin. 
The bitter orange is a naturally occurring hybrid between the pomelo and the mandarin, with the pomelo the larger and firmer of the two. The grapefruit was originally presumed to be a naturally occurring hybrid of the pomelo and the mandarin; however, genome analysis shows that it is actually a backcrossed hybrid between a pomelo and a sweet orange, which is why 63% of the grapefruit&#x27;s genome comes from the pomelo. The bitter orange is a hybrid of wild type mandarin and pomelo; in turn, the lemon is a hybrid of bitter orange and citron, i.e. cultivated lemons have some pomelo ancestry. In addition, there has been repeated introgression of pomelo genes into both early cultivated hybrid mandarins and later mandarin varieties, these last also involving hybridization with the sweet orange. Pomelo genes are thus included in many types of cultivated &quot;Citrus&quot;.

=== Etymology ===

According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the etymology of the word &#x27;pomelo&#x27; is uncertain. It may be derived from Dutch . The Dutch name in turn has uncertain etymology, but is possibly derived from Dutch &#x27;swollen&#x27; or &#x27;pumpkin&#x27;, combined with &#x27;lemon, citrus fruit&#x27;, influenced by Portuguese with the same meaning. An alternative possibility is that the Dutch name derives from Portuguese &#x27;citrus fruit&#x27;.
The specific name &quot;maxima&quot; is the female form of the Latin for &#x27;biggest&#x27;. 

One theory for the alternative English name &#x27;shaddock&#x27; is that it was adopted after the plant&#x27;s introduction into Barbados by a &#x27;Captain Shaddock&#x27; of the East India Company (apparently Philip Chaddock, who visited the island in the late 1640s). From there the name spread to Jamaica in 1696. The fruit is called &quot;jambola&quot; in varieties of English spoken in South Asia, and jabong in Hawai&#x27;i.

=== Taxonomy ===

In his &quot;Herbarium Amboinense&quot;, published posthumously in 1741, Georg Eberhard Rumphius named it &quot;Limo decumanus&quot;.
In 1753, Carl Linnaeus mentioned the plant as a subspecies, &quot;Citrus aurantium var grandis&quot;. In 1755, Johannes Burman validly described the species from the type specimen, giving it the name &quot;Aurantium maximum&quot;, now considered a basionym. In 1757, Pehr Osbeck named it &quot;Citrus grandis&quot;. Linnaeus revisited the taxonomy in 1767, renaming the species as &quot;Citrus decumana&quot;. In 1917, Elmer Drew Merrill revised and renamed it &quot;Citrus maxima&quot;. Aurantioideae remains as a subfamily.

== As food ==

=== Nutrition ===

Raw pomelo flesh is 89% water, 10% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and contains negligible fat. A 100-gram reference amount provides of food energy, and is rich in vitamin C (68% of the Daily Value), with no other micronutrients in significant content (table).

=== Culinary ===

The flesh and juice are edible, and the rind is used to make preserves, or may be candied. In Brazil, the outer part of the rind is used for making a sweet conserve, while the spongy pith of the rind is discarded. In Sri Lanka, it is often eaten as a dessert, sometimes sprinkled with sugar. In large parts of Southeast Asia where pomelo is native it is commonly eaten as a dessert, sprinkled with salt or dipped in a salt mixture, or made into salads. In the Philippines, a pink beverage is made from pomelo and pineapple juice.

The fruit may have been introduced to China around 100 BCE. In East Asia, especially in Cantonese cuisine, braised pomelo pith is used to make dishes that are high in fibre and low in fat.

=== Drug interactions ===

The pomelo, while not itself toxic, can cause adverse interactions similar to those caused by the grapefruit with a wide range of prescription drugs. These occur by the inhibition of cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism of prescription drugs including for example some anti-hypertensives, some anticoagulants, some anticancer agents, some anti-infective agents, some statins, and some immunosuppressants.

== Cultivation ==

The seeds of the pomelo are monoembryonic, producing seedlings with genes from both parents, but they are usually similar to the tree they grow from and therefore in Asia, pomelos are typically grown from seed. Seeds can be stored for 80 days at a temperature of with moderate relative humidity. Outside Asia, the pomelo is usually grafted onto other citrus rootstocks to produce trees that are identical to the parent; high-quality varieties are propagated by air-layering or by budding onto favored rootstocks.

== In culture ==

The pomelo is used in cultural and spiritual festivals across Asia. In China, during the Lunar New Year festival, the fruit is offered to ancestors. Its name is similar to the word for &quot;to have&quot; (有, yǒu), making it a symbol of prosperity and family unity. In Thailand, pomelo is used in rituals such as the Songkran Festival. Chhath Puja is a Hindu religious festival in which pomelo is used as an offering. This is celebrated to worship the Sun God, Surya. The ritual is celebrated in India and Nepal, lasting four days. Devotees offer their prayers to the Sun God and seek the deity&#x27;s blessing for a prosperous and healthy life.

<text>Simeon Gannett Reed (April 23, 1830 – November 7, 1895) was an American businessman and entrepreneur in Oregon. A native of Massachusetts, he made a fortune primarily in the transportation sector in association with William S. Ladd. Reedville, Oregon, and Reed College in Portland, Oregon are named after Reed.

==Early life==
Simeon Gannett Reed was born on April 23, 1830, in East Abington, Massachusetts. He was born into a wealthy family and received his education at a private academy, graduating when he was 13 years old. After working and training as an apprentice in several vocations, he married Amanda Woods at the age of 20, with the couple not having any children. Woods was 18 at the time and a distant cousin of John Quincy Adams.

When he was 22, he collected supplies to sell in California and sailed there, setting up a store in a tent in Sacramento, while Amanda remained back east. Reed sold his goods and grain to the gold miners, but decided to relocate to what was then the Oregon Territory after a few trips there to purchase supplies.

==Oregon==
Late in 1852, Reed started a mercantile in Rainier, Oregon, along the Columbia River downstream from Portland. After a short time, he relocated to Portland and became friends with William S. Ladd, a local merchant. In 1854, Amanda sailed to San Francisco to reunite with Reed, and accompanied Caroline Ames Elliott, Ladd&#x27;s sweetheart who he married in San Francisco. In 1855, Reed became a clerk for Ladd, and in 1859 he became a partner in the company, which was then known as Ladd, Reed, &amp; Co.
In May 1860, Reed, Jacob Kamm, and John C. Ainsworth founded the Oregon Steam Navigation Company, a conglomerate of several river shipping companies plying the Columbia and Willamette rivers. Reed held 128 shares in the company, which even during the economic depression of 1873 produced $300,000 in dividends. Reed was also vice president of the firm. He built a mansion at First and Harrison streets in 1868, where the other wealthy residents were also constructing large homes.

In April 1880, the Oregon Steam Navigation Company merged with the companies of Henry Villard and Ben Holladay to form the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company. This created a single transportation conglomerate encompassing river shipping, stagecoach, and railroad ventures. Reed focused his energy now on meeting the demand for steel he anticipated due to Villard&#x27;s Northern Pacific railroad. But Reed&#x27;s Oregon Iron and Steel Company at Oswego suffered a lack of investment and never started production of the steel rails Reed expected; Reed lost half a million dollars in the venture.

Reed and Ladd also operated a hobby farm of more than , on which they raised livestock and held harness races, in the area where Reedville, Oregon now stands, with Reed as namesake.

==Death and legacy==
On November 7, 1895, Simeon Reed died while in California at his retirement home, &quot;Carmelita&quot;, in Pasadena. His estate, worth millions of dollars, was left to Amanda, with instructions to use it to assist in the cultural and intellectual development of Portland. Amanda died in 1904 without much progress towards Simeon&#x27;s instructions.

In 1908, Amanda&#x27;s estate established Reed College in Portland. William M. Ladd (son of Reed&#x27;s former partner William S. Ladd) provided the lands on which the college stands today, and almost all of Reed&#x27;s estate was passed on to the college, Reed having left no heirs. Simeon and Amanda Reed are buried near the family plot of Jacob Kamm in Portland&#x27;s River View Cemetery.

Reed Street, in Northwest Portland, is named for him.

<doc id="379793" wikidata="Q722180" url="?curid=379793" title="Island fox">
<text>The island fox (Urocyon littoralis) is a small fox species that is endemic to six of the eight Channel Islands of California. There are six subspecies, each unique to the island it lives on, reflecting its evolutionary history. They are generally docile, show little fear of humans, and are easily tamed. Island foxes played an important role in the spiritual lives of native Channel Islanders. They have been likely semi-domesticated as pets, used as pelts, or for other functions, like pest control.

==Taxonomy and evolution==
Genetic and archaeological evidence indicates that the species descends from a population of the mainland gray fox (&quot;U. cinereoargenteus&quot;) that arrived on the islands around 7,300 years ago, possibly due to having been introduced to the islands by humans. Humans are almost certainly responsible for their presence on the southern islands. The species is around 25% smaller than its mainland ancestor, an example of insular dwarfism.

Because the island fox is geographically isolated, it has not acquired immunity to parasites and diseases brought in from the mainland and is especially vulnerable to those that the domestic dog (&quot;Canis familiaris)&quot; may carry. In addition, predation by the golden eagle (&quot;Aquila chrysaetos&quot;) and human activities devastated fox numbers on several of the Channel Islands in the 1990s. Four island fox subspecies were federally protected as an endangered species in 2004, and efforts to rebuild fox populations and restore the ecosystems of the Channel Islands are being undertaken. Radio collars are being attached to foxes in an effort to track and locate the young foxes. To date these efforts have been largely successful.

There are six subspecies of the island fox, each of which is native to a specific Channel Island, and which evolved there independently of the others. The subspecies are:
* &quot;U. l. littoralis&quot; (the nominate subspecies) of San Miguel Island,
* &quot;U. l. dickeyi&quot; of San Nicolas Island,
* &quot;U. l. catalinae&quot; of Santa Catalina Island,
* &quot;U. l. clementae&quot; of San Clemente Island,
* &quot;U. l. santacruzae&quot; of Santa Cruz Island, and
* &quot;U. l. santarosae&quot; of Santa Rosa Island.

Foxes from each island are capable of interbreeding, but have genetic and phenotypic distinctions that make them unique; for example, each subspecies has differing numbers of tail vertebrae. The fox did not persist on Anacapa Island because it has no reliable source of fresh water; Santa Barbara Island is too small to support the food needs of a viable fox population.
Other names for the island fox include &quot;coast fox&quot;, &quot;short-tailed fox&quot;, &quot;island gray fox&quot;, &quot;Channel Islands fox&quot;, &quot;Channel Islands gray fox&quot;, &quot;California Channel Islands fox&quot; and &quot;insular gray fox&quot;.

==Description==
The island fox is significantly smaller than the related gray fox, and is the smallest fox in North America, averaging slightly smaller than the swift (&quot;Vulpes velox&quot;) and kit foxes (&quot;Vulpes macrotis&quot;). Typically, the head-and-body length is , shoulder height , and the tail is long, which is notably shorter than the tail of the gray fox. This is due to the fact that the island fox generally has two fewer tail vertebrae than the gray fox. The island fox weighs between . The species exhibits sexual dimorphism: the male is always larger than the female. The largest of the subspecies occurs on Santa Catalina Island and the smallest on Santa Cruz Island.

The island fox has gray fur on its head, a ruddy red coloring on its sides, white fur on its belly, throat and the lower half of its face, and a black stripe on the dorsal surface of its tail. In general the coat is darker and duller hued than that of the gray fox. The island fox molts once a year between August and November. Before the first molt pups are woolly and have a generally darker coat than adult foxes. A brown phase, with the grey and black fur of the body replaced by a sandy brown and a deeper brown, may occur in the San Clemente Island and San Nicolas Island populations. It is unclear if this is a true color phase, a change that occurs with age, or possibly a change that occurs because of interactions with &quot;Opuntia&quot; cactus spines that become embedded in the pelt.

==Reproduction==
The island fox typically forms monogamous breeding pairs, which are frequently seen together beginning in January and through the breeding season, from late February to early March. The gestation period is 50–63 days. The female island fox gives birth in a den, a typical litter having one to five pups, with an average of two or three. Pups are born in the spring and emerge from the den in early summer; the mother lactates for 7–9 weeks. Sexual maturity is reached at 10 months, and the females usually breed within the first year. Island foxes live for 4–6 years in the wild and for up to 8 years in captivity.

===Genomic analysis===
Island foxes have existed in small populations with low diversity for many generations. Morphological analysis indicate an absence of inbreeding depression. Apparently, the explanation for the absence of inbreeding depression is that, over the long-term, the small population size of island foxes facilitated a reduced burden of strongly deleterious recessive mutations through genetic purging by natural selection. Purging of deleterious recessive mutations occurs when their detrimental effect is expressed in homozygous individuals.

==Ecology and behavior==

Its preferred habitat is complex layer vegetation with a high density of woody, perennially fruiting shrubs. The fox lives in all of the island biomes including temperate forest, temperate grassland and chaparral, with no island supporting more than 1,000 foxes. The island fox eats fruits, insects, birds, eggs, land snails, crabs, lizards, amphibians, and small mammals, including deer mice (&quot;Peromyscus&quot; sp.), as well as human refuse. In addition, they are known to scavenge for food on beaches along the coastline. The fox tends to move around by itself, rather than in packs. It is generally nocturnal, although with peaks of activity at dawn and dusk. Activity also fluctuates with the season: It is more active during the day in summer than it is in winter.
The island fox is not intimidated by humans, although at first it may show aggression. It is quite easy to tame and is generally docile. The island fox communicates using auditory, olfactory and visual signals. A dominant fox uses vocalizations, staring, and ear flattening to cause another fox to submit. Signs of dominance and submission are visual, such as facial expression and body posture. Its main vocalizations are barking and growling. The island fox marks territory with urine and feces.

== Relationship with humans ==
The indigenous people of the Channel Islands kept island foxes as pets and used their pelts for a variety of purposes, including ceremonial headdresses. Archaeological investigations have found island foxes (often juveniles) deliberately buried, sometimes in association with human remains. These foxes are suggested to have been ritually sacrificed. The foxes play a significant role in Chumash legend.

==Conservation status and federal protection==

In March 2004, four subspecies of the island fox were classified as a federally protected endangered species: the Santa Cruz island fox, Santa Rosa island fox, San Miguel island fox and the Santa Catalina island fox. As of 2013, the IUCN lists the entire species as near threatened, an improvement from its previous status of &quot;critically endangered&quot;. A decline in island fox populations was identified in the 1990s. On San Miguel Island, the decline began in 1994, with the population falling from 450 adults to 15 by 1999. Similar population declines were discovered on Santa Cruz Island. On the Santa Cruz Island the population decreased from 2,000 adults in 1994 to less than 135 in 2000, and on Santa Rosa Island where foxes may have numbered more than 1,500 in 1994, but were reduced to 14 animals by 2000. In 2004, there were 38 San Miguel island foxes, all in captivity; 46 foxes in captivity on Santa Rosa Island and seven in the wild (golden eagle predation prevented the release of captive foxes into the wild); Santa Cruz Island had 25 captive foxes and a stable wild population of around 100 foxes.

Golden eagle predation, discovered when foxes were radio-collared and monitored, proved to be the cause of the high mortality rates. The golden eagle was an uncommon visitor to the Channel Islands before the 1990s, when it naturally colonized the area, according to data gathered by Dr. Lyndal Laughrin of the University of California Santa Cruz Island Reserve, and the first golden eagle nest was recorded on Santa Cruz Island in 1999. Biologists propose that the eagle may have been attracted to the islands in the 1960s after the decline of the bald eagle (&quot;Haliaeetus leucocephalus&quot;). The golden eagle replaced the bald eagle&#x27;s niche and began to feed on feral pigs (&quot;Sus domesticus&quot;) following the devastation of the local bald eagle population due to DDT exposure in the 1950s—the bald eagle is hypothesized to have deterred the golden eagle from settling on the islands while it subsisted on fish.

The feral pigs on Santa Rosa, which themselves preyed on the foxes, were exterminated by the National Park Service in the early 1990s, which removed one of the golden eagle&#x27;s food sources. The golden eagle then began to prey on the island fox population. Feral pigs on Santa Cruz Island and deer and elk on Santa Rosa Island were introduced almost 70 years prior to island fox decline, therefore, the golden eagle most likely did not seek these animals as alternative prey. This has occurred most likely as a result of a process known as &quot;apparent competition&quot;: in this process, a predator, like the golden eagle, feeds on at least two prey, for example, the island fox and feral pigs. One prey item is adapted to high predation pressure and supports the predator population (i.e. pigs), whereas the other prey item (i.e. the island fox) is poorly adapted to predation and declines as a consequence of the predation pressure. It has also been proposed that the complete removal of golden eagles may be the only action that could save three subspecies of the island fox from extinction. However, the pigs on Santa Cruz Island were killed by the Nature Conservancy on the idea that they drew the eagles to the foxes.

Introduced diseases or parasites can devastate island fox populations. Because the island fox is isolated, it has not acquired immunity to parasites and diseases brought in from the mainland and is especially vulnerable to those the domestic dog may carry. A canine distemper outbreak in 1998 killed approximately 90% of Santa Catalina Island&#x27;s foxes, reducing the population from 1,300 to 103 in 2000. A vaccination program has been initiated to protect Catalina Island foxes from canine distemper. After several years of carefully trapping the foxes and vaccinating them against distemper and rabies, their population has surpassed the pre-disease population of about 1,300. Scientists believe the distemper virus was introduced by a pet dog or a raccoon from the mainland that hitched a ride on a boat or a barge. To eliminate the risk of disease, pets are not permitted in Channel Islands National Park.

Diminished food supply and general degradation of the habitat due to introduced mammal species, including feral cats (&quot;Felis catus&quot;), pigs, sheep (&quot;Ovis aries&quot;), goats (&quot;Capra hircus&quot;), and American bison (&quot;Bison bison&quot;), the last having been introduced to Catalina Island in the 1920s by a Hollywood film crew shooting a Western, also has had a negative effect on fox populations.

The foxes threaten a population of the severely endangered San Clemente Island loggerhead shrike (&quot;Lanius ludovicianus mearnsi&quot;) in residence on San Clemente Island. The island fox population has been negatively affected by trapping and removal or euthanasia of foxes by the United States Navy. Since 2000, the Navy has employed different management strategies: trapping and holding foxes during the shrike breeding season, the installation of an electric fence system around shrike habitats, and the use of shock collar systems. With the gradual recovery of the shrike population on San Clemente Island, the Navy no longer controls the foxes.

The populations of Santa Cruz island foxes, San Miguel island foxes, and Santa Rosa island foxes have dramatically rebounded from lows in 2000 of 70 for the Santa Cruz foxes and 15 each on San Miguel and Santa Rosa Islands. The Catalina Island Conservancy runs a captive breeding program on Catalina Island. On September 14, 2012, the US Fish and Wildlife Service released a draft recovery plan for the San Miguel island fox, Santa Rosa island fox, Santa Cruz island fox, and the Santa Catalina island fox. By 2012, the Catalina Island Conservancy determined that there were 1,500 Santa Catalina island foxes and the population was stable. Since then the fox populations have grown.
 
Because the Channel Islands are almost entirely owned and controlled by either the Catalina Island Conservancy, The Nature Conservancy, or the federal government, the fox has a chance to receive the protection it needs, including constant supervision by interested officials without the ongoing threat of human encroachment on its habitat.

Rene Vellanoweth, an archaeologist, has proposed that inbreeding depression can be managed by mixing the different island fox subspecies populations much as the indigenous peoples did, by moving them from island to island, creating a higher genetic diversity and assisting them in recovery.

==Description==
Renn Fayre is an annual three-day celebration that occurs on the campus of Reed College in Portland, Oregon. The 
festival was originally a one-day Renaissance Fayre, held during the spring semester for the purpose of recreating the Renaissance era. On the final days of class instruction, seniors march from the library to the registrar&#x27;s office to celebrate the completion of their theses and to receive congratulations from the institution&#x27;s President. The parade of students begins a weekend festival that has featured a variety of activities and forms of expression, including a fire show, fireworks, food, a giant slide and skate ramp, handicraft, lube wrestling, nude students covered by blue paint known as &quot;Picts&quot;, Glow Opera, and other sports.

==Drug use and controversy==
In 2008, &quot;Willamette Week&quot; reported on the tolerance of drug use during the festival. The article &quot;inflamed&quot; students and faculty, generating hundreds of comments, some of which were critical of the publication. &quot;Willamette Week&quot; revisited the story in 2009, concluding that little had changed, with similar activities taking place and a continued tolerance of drug use. In response, the school&#x27;s spokesman stated: &quot;We have a moral, legal and institutional responsibility to report serious violations. If we didn&#x27;t see it and nobody points it out to us, we can&#x27;t do anything. We&#x27;ve taken it seriously in more instances in the past year. We&#x27;ve gotten the Portland PD involved more.&quot; The spokesman also insisted that the college improved crowd control by limiting the number of festival participants and examines its alcohol and drug policy on a &quot;pretty regular basis&quot;.

<doc id="379799" wikidata="Q7604683" url="?curid=379799" title="Statutes of Mortmain">
<text>The Statutes of Mortmain were two enactments, in 1279 (, 7 Edw. 1) and 1290 (, 18 Edw. 1), passed in the reign of Edward I of England, aimed at preserving the kingdom&#x27;s revenues by preventing land from passing into the possession of the Church. Possession of property by a corporation such as the Church was known as mortmain, literally &quot;dead hand&quot;. In medieval England, feudal estates generated taxes for the King (known as feudal &quot;incidents&quot;), principally on the grant or inheritance of the estate. If an estate became owned by a religious corporation which could never die, could never attain majority, and could never be attainted for treason, these taxes never became payable. It was akin to the estates being owned by the dead, hence the term.

The Statutes of Mortmain were meant to re-establish the prohibition against donating land to the Church for the purpose of avoiding feudal services, a prohibition which had originated in in 1215 and was specifically defined in its 1217 issue. But King John, the original signatory of , died the following year, and his son, Henry III, did not enforce the proscriptions and, to the contrary, showed great deference to the Church.

Henry&#x27;s son, Edward I, desired to re-establish the precedent set by the 1215 and 1217 issues of . The Statutes of Mortmain thus provided that no estate could be granted to a corporation without royal consent. However, these statutes proved ineffective in practice, and the problem of Church lands persisted, due to the development of the device of the use, which side-stepped the royal courts and began – in the ecclesiastical courts – the development of the law of trusts, which separated the legal ownership from the right of occupation or use of land. The issue was only finally resolved in 1535, when Henry VIII dissolved the monasteries, confiscating all monastic lands for the Crown, though the bishops remained endowed with much land.

== Alienation and the statute of ==
In England in the 12th and 13th centuries, the legal ownership of land was defined through a hierarchical system of estates. The monarch was the ultimate owner of all land in the realm, and out of his estate lesser estates existed, held by individuals known as tenants in chief. Further estates could be created out of these estates in a process called subinfeudation.

Estates in land could be alienated (that is, their legal title – i.e. ownership – could be transferred to others), in two ways. &quot;Substitution&quot; meant that the transferee would take the estate with the same tenure, and hold from the same lord, as the original tenant. &quot;Subinfeudation&quot; meant that the original tenant continued to hold his estate, but there was created a new estate which was held from and through the original tenant, and which was subsidiary to the original estate.

Alienation was not always possible, and sometimes the permission of the immediate overlord was required. In the opinion of Pollock and Maitland, in the middle of the 13th century the tenant enjoyed a largely unfettered power of disposing of his tenement , though this was subject to some restraints in favour of the overlord.

Other opinions have been expressed. Coke regarded the English tradition as one of ancient liberty dictated by custom, in which the tenant had relative freedom to alienate all or part of his estate. Blackstone was of a differing conclusion, namely that the law supported the inalienability of the fief as its starting point. Pollock and Maitland believed Coke&#x27;s opinion to be the more valid one. Both views may have been true: modern scholars may have given more weight to the written law of the Normans than existed in reality after the Black Death had altered the economic conditions of the age.

A significant consequence of the ability of owners to alienate their estates was a growth in gifts of land to the Church. Estates so given were said to be held in frankalmoin tenure. The King made various attempts to prevent this practice, including in Magna Carta in 1215 and in the Statutes of Mortmain in 1279 and 1290, but these measures were largely ineffective.

Where estates were subinfeudated, the practice of &quot;mortmain&quot; was detrimental to the overlord&#x27;s rights. It was difficult or impossible for an overlord to extract any services (such as knight service, rent, or homage) from the new tenant, who had no bond to the overlord. Pollock and Maitland give the following example: in a case of subinfeudation, the old tenant was liable for services to the lord. If A enfeoffed to B, to hold on a knight&#x27;s service (a form of military service), and then B enfeoffed C to hold at a rent of a pound of pepper per year, if B then dies leaving an under-age heir, A is entitled to a wardship, but it will be worth very little: instead of being entitled to enjoy the land itself until the heir is of full age, the overlord will get only a few annual pounds of pepper, because C is in possession, not B. Instead of enjoying the land itself, by wardship or by escheat, he will only receive a trifling peppercorn rent.

Bracton gives the example of a tenant making a gift of frankalmoin: gifting land to the Church. A right of wardship would have no value at all, as ownership cannot henceforth pass to a minor. An escheat of the land (reclaiming the land by the overlord, for want of an heir to inherit it) would allow the overlord to re-take control of the land. But by placing the land in frankalmoin it was left in the hands of a group of lawyers or others, who allowed the use of the land by a religious organisation. The overlord would have only nominal control of this corporation, as it had never entered into a feudal &quot;homage&quot; arrangement, hence the corporation owed nothing to the overlord. Bracton was sympathetic to this arrangement. According to him, the lord was not really injured, as his rights to the land remained unscathed. It is true they had been significantly diminished, as he had suffered &quot;damnum&quot;; but there had been no &quot;injuria&quot;. Bracton was of the opinion that a gift of land to the Church could be voided only by the heirs of the donor, not by the feudal overlord.

The statute of , enacted in 1290, confirmed the ability of tenants freely to alienate their estates by substitution, but ended the possibility of alienation by subinfeudation. It also ended the possibility for further estates in frankalmoin to be created by anyone other than the king, as any gift of land to the Church now required royal consent; but the lawyers who had created frankalmoin now nimbly side-stepped the Statutes of Mortmain, and the cumbersome and useless common law courts, with the development of a replacement device in the ecclesiastical courts, the cestui que use.

==Frankalmoin and the Assize of Utrum ==

Gifts of land in frankalmoin were intended to be made to God. Bracton describes these as &quot;&quot;primo et principaliter&quot; (first and principally) to God, and only &quot;secundario&quot;&quot; (secondarily) to the canons or monks or parsons. A gift, for example, to Ramsey Abbey would take the form of a gift &quot;to God and St. Benet of Ramsey and the Abbot Walter and the monks of St. Benet&quot;; or in shorthand, &quot;to God and the church of St. Benet of Ramsey&quot; or briefly &quot;to God and St. Benet&quot;.

Often the donor laid the charter of feoffment or some other symbol, such as a knife or other symbol of possession, upon the altar of the church. God was considered the primary landowner. Bracton founds several arguments upon this assertion. It suggested land given in frankalmoin was outside the sphere of mere human justice.

In later years, the feature of the tenure of frankalmoin which attracted the notice of lawyers was the absence of any service that could be enforced by the secular courts. Grants from the Crown &quot;in free, pure and perpetual alms&quot; would be free from all secular services. However, if a mesne (i.e. intermediate) lord was involved, then services such as socage, fee and other services might be extracted from the land, either in part or in total. 

Cases became so complicated that a special assize, the Assize of Utrum, was established in the middle of the 12th century. Jurisdiction would normally lie with the ecclesiastical courts; but the Assize of Utrum, especially as defined in the Constitutions of Clarendon in 1164, gave the Crown a chance to clarify difficult questions of ownership and duty in a non-religious, secular court. Often, ownership was of less importance than in determining who had rights to grain, to knight service, to marriage penalties, and the like feudal rights. These duties were defined by the manner in which the land had been granted, and by who in the feudal chain had made the grant. Frequently, land would be donated to a religious body, which would simultaneously re-let it to the donor, in order to evade those feudal services which otherwise would be due to the immediate overlord.

== Problems with mortmain in Bracton&#x27;s time ==


Giving land to the Church had a long and contentious history in England. Prior to the Norman Conquest of 1066, the Anglo-Saxon state and the Church were often synonymous. The local bishop or priest might also sit in judgment of civil and criminal cases in the royal courts. The Normans created a strict separation of Church and state. William the Conqueror encouraged this separation, yet was enthusiastic about the role the Church played in moral matters.

As a result, a two-tier legal system developed: the ecclesiastical courts and the Royal courts (the latter being now known as the Common Law courts). Jurisdiction was frequently blurred. A petitioner not receiving a satisfactory result in one court could re-file the case in the other. Writs of prohibition were frequently issued by common law courts to bar the reissuing of a case in a Church court. Bracton considered it a sin for a man to pledge to live by the decision of a common law court, only to re-issue it in a Church court because the first court had ruled against him.

The practice of pledging land to the Church was governed by the laws of frankalmoin under the Normans. There were two reasons to do so: gratitude toward the Church, but also to avoid feudal services and taxes. Once land had been pledged to the Church, it was difficult or impossible for the overlord to extract his former dues from the land.

Bracton considered the outcome of this, in a case where the tenant made a gift into frankalmoin – a gift of land to the Church. A feudal right of wardship would now be of no value at all, as no minority (ownership of the land by a minor) could thereafter arise. An escheat of the land (reclaiming of the land by the overlord, for want of an heir) theoretically allowed the lord to take back control of it; but placing the land in frankalmoin left it in the hands of a group of lawyers or others who allowed the use of the land by a religious foundation: the overlord would have only nominal control of this corporation, as it had never entered into a feudal &quot;homage&quot; arrangement with him; the corporation thus owed nothing to the overlord, so did not pay him homage. Bracton was sympathetic to this arrangement. According to him, the lord was not really injured as his rights to the land remained unscathed. It is true that they had been significantly diminished, as he had suffered ; but there had been no (). Bracton was (rightly) of the view that a gift of land to the Church could be voided only by the donor&#x27;s heirs, not by the overlord.

Once land had passed into the control of the Church, it could never be relinquished. Since the Church never died, the land could never be inherited on death (so no fine could be levied for the entry of the heir), nor could it be escheated to the lord (forfeited for want of an heir). This came to be known as the &quot;dead hand&quot; () – either the Church (a non-living corporation) represented this dead hand, or the hand was that of the dead donor, who in effect still controlled the land by his original gift of it. Thus did the actions of men who had died generations before continue to control their former lands.

 (the Great Charter) of 1217 struck down certain practices to which the Church was privy. Collusion, in making a gift of the land to a religious body (so as to evade feudal service), in return for an immediate re-letting of it by that body to the donor, was forbidden. This law was undermined in practice by the Chief Justice of the kingdom, Coke, whose courts interpreted the provision as though its only effect was to make the gift voidable by the donor&#x27;s heirs. Coke held that it could not be voided by the donor&#x27;s overlord, an opinion reiterated by Bracton. 

The statute made provision in the following terms: &quot;One is not to enfeoff a religious house and take back the land as a tenant of that house&quot; (on the face of it, a ban on donating land to the Church on condition that it grant the donor a new tenancy thereof). The mischief aimed at by this arose because certain favoured religious bodies, such as the Knights Templar, possessed royal charters which, by general words therein, set free from any feudal burdens all the lands they possessed at the time of the granting of the charter, or thereafter acquired. Thus a man might give land to such a house, and in return be granted by it a tenancy of that same land, and as a tenant of the house he could now claim the immunity afforded by the charter. Thus did the gifting of land to a religious body free the tenant from his feudal duties to the overlord of the land.

King John&#x27;s &quot;Great Charter&quot; of 1217 left no scope for granting land to the Church. But in spite of this his successor, Henry III, lavishly granted such licenses, despite that they were theoretically not allowed. The Great Charter, not being a statute but a mere administrative proclamation by the king, was binding only on the king&#x27;s subjects, not on the king himself.

In 1258 at the Parliament in Oxford, the barons sought to preclude men of religion from entering into ownership of fees held from earls, barons and other lords without their consent, whereby the overlord lost forever the rights of wardship, marriage, relief and escheat, i.e. they were trying to use the authority of Parliament to bind the king with these provisions. In 1259 the Provisions of Westminster ordained that it shall not be lawful for men of religion to enter the fee of anyone without the permission of the lord from whom the land was held. The Provisions were alternately considered to be the law, then not rigorously enforced, depending upon who had greater political sway: the barons or the king. Most of the Provisions of Westminster were subsequently enacted, hence given greater authority, in the Statute of Marlborough in 1267, but not those relating to the gifting of fees to the Church. From this it may be inferred that the clergy had been influential with the king, who was then enjoying increased power over the barons.

The Statute of Marlborough was the nominal endpoint of the Second Barons&#x27; War, and underscored the victory of the king. The omission of restrictions on the Church can be directly traced to Henry III&#x27;s sympathy for the clergy, according to Plucknett. In 1279 the statute referred to the Provisions of Westminster as if they were settled law, whilst adding a restriction on alienations made in mortmain, discussed below. 

By the &#x27;Statute for Religious Men&#x27; of 1279, one of the so-called &quot;Statutes of Mortmain&quot;, no religious persons were permitted to acquire land. If they did so, the land was forfeited to the immediate overlord, and he had a brief period in which to take advantage of the forfeiture. If he failed to do so, the lord next above him in the feudal hierarchy had a similar opportunity. This right continued all the way up to the king. The statute did not merely abolish frankalmoin: ecclesiastical houses could no longer acquire land in any manner, even if they were willing to pay a full rent for it. Nevertheless, if the overlord was willing, land could still be gifted to a religious house with his complicity, i.e. by his inaction. And licenses from the king to acquire land in mortmain were easily obtained in those years, as Henry III was sympathetic to religious bodies during his long reign. 

There had been a parallel French ordinance proclaimed in 1275. Henry III had a reputation of ruling by fiat – making royal proclamations on the spur of the moment. These were troublesome to both the secular and the church courts of the day, and efforts were made to curtail and limit this practice.

==Result of the Statutes of Mortmain ==

During the long reign of Henry III, the donation of land to the Church became increasingly common. A feudal tenant would typically practice collusion with the Church in order to defeat a claim by his overlord for feudal services, by donating the land to a religious foundation on condition of it granting him a fresh tenancy of that land. The &quot;Great Charter&quot; of 1217 contained the first direct provision against this practice:

Several cases are recorded where the king specifically forbade the tenant from alienating a church or land held in perpetuity by the Crown, and thus presumably the equivalent of mortmain. These cases are dated 1164, 1221 and 1227. After 1217, there was a forfeiture of the land to the overlord in a case of unauthorized alienation in mortmain. However, Henry III showed conspicuous favour to the Church and left the proclamations of 1215 and 1217 made by King John largely unenforced. The proscription was reintroduced, and made more forcible, by Henry III&#x27;s son, Edward I, by the Statutes of Mortmain in 1279 and 1290.

However, all of these attempts at proscription were ineffective. Land could instead be left to the Church by the development of the new device of the &quot;cestui que use&quot;. Henry VII expended much energy in the courts trying to break the legal grip of &quot;uses&quot; by Church corporations. The Statute of Uses, passed three centuries after the Statutes of Mortmain, would attempt – with only partial success – to end the practice of the &quot; use&quot;. Henry VIII would resolve the problem of Church lands once and for all, in 1535, by dissolving the monasteries and confiscating all Church lands.

<doc id="379803" wikidata="Q2164847" url="?curid=379803" title="Clock generator">
<text>A clock generator is an electronic oscillator that produces a clock signal for use in synchronizing a circuit&#x27;s operation. The output clock signal can range from a simple symmetrical square wave to more complex arrangements. The basic parts that all clock generators share are a resonant circuit and an amplifier.

The resonant circuit is usually a quartz piezo-electric oscillator, although simpler tank circuits and even RC circuits may be used.

The amplifier circuit usually inverts the signal from the oscillator and feeds a portion back into the oscillator to maintain oscillation.

The generator may have additional sections to modify the basic signal. The 8088 for example, used a 2/3 duty cycle clock, which required the clock generator to incorporate logic to convert the 50/50 duty cycle which is typical of raw oscillators.

Other such optional sections include frequency divider or clock multiplier sections. Programmable clock generators allow the number used in the divider or multiplier to be changed, allowing any of a wide variety of output frequencies to be selected without modifying the hardware.

The clock generator in a motherboard is often changed by computer enthusiasts to control the speed of a CPU, FSB, GPU or RAM. Typically the programmable clock generator is set by the BIOS at boot time to the selected value; although some systems have dynamic frequency scaling, which frequently re-programs the clock generator.

== Timing-signal generators (TSGs) ==
TSGs are clocks that are used throughout service-provider networks, frequently as the building integrated timing supply (BITS) for a central office.

Digital switching systems and some transmission systems (e.g., SONET, RREX, LUBI) depend on reliable, high-quality synchronization (or timing) to prevent impairments. To provide this, most service providers use interoffice synchronization distribution networks based on the stratum hierarchy and implement the BITS concept to meet intraoffice synchronization needs.

A TSG is clock equipment that accepts input timing reference signals and generates output timing reference signals. The input reference signals can be either DS1 or composite-clock (CC) signals, and the output signals can also be DS1 or CC signals (or both). A TSG is made up of the six components listed below:
# An input timing interface that accepts DS1 or CC input signals
# A timing-generation component that creates the timing signals used by the output timing-distribution component
# An output timing distribution component that utilizes the timing signals from the timing-generation component to create multiple DS1 and CC output signals
# A performance-monitoring (PM) component that monitors the timing characteristics of the input signals
# An alarm interface that connects to the central-office (CO) alarm-monitoring system
# An operations interface for local crafts person use and communications with remote operations systems

<doc id="379814" wikidata="Q11606510" url="?curid=379814" title="Geographic coordinate conversion">
<text>In geodesy, conversion among different geographic coordinate systems is made necessary by the different geographic coordinate systems in use across the world and over time. Coordinate conversion is composed of a number of different types of conversion: format change of geographic coordinates, conversion of coordinate systems, or transformation to different geodetic datums. Geographic coordinate conversion has applications in cartography, surveying, navigation and geographic information systems.

In geodesy, geographic coordinate &quot;conversion&quot; is defined as translation among different coordinate formats or map projections all referenced to the same geodetic datum. A geographic coordinate &quot;transformation&quot; is a translation among different geodetic datums. Both geographic coordinate conversion and transformation will be considered in this article.

This article assumes readers are already familiar with the content in the articles geographic coordinate system and geodetic datum.

==Change of units and format==

Informally, specifying a geographic location usually means giving the location&#x27;s latitude and longitude. The numerical values for latitude and longitude can occur in a number of different units or formats:

* sexagesimal degree: degrees, minutes, and seconds : 40° 26′ 46″ N 79° 58′ 56″ W
* degrees and decimal minutes: 40° 26.767′ N 79° 58.933′ W
* decimal degrees: +40.446 -79.982

There are 60 minutes in a degree and 60 seconds in a minute. Therefore, to convert from a degrees minutes seconds format to a decimal degrees format, one may use the formula

: formula_1.

To convert back from decimal degree format to degrees minutes seconds format,

: formula_2
where formula_3 and formula_4 are just temporary variables to handle both positive and negative values properly.

==Coordinate system conversion==
A coordinate system conversion is a conversion from one coordinate system to another, with both coordinate systems based on the same geodetic datum. Common conversion tasks include conversion between geodetic and earth-centered, earth-fixed (ECEF) coordinates and conversion from one type of map projection to another.

=== From geodetic to ECEF coordinates ===
Geodetic coordinates (latitude formula_5, longitude formula_6, height formula_7) can be converted into ECEF coordinates using the following equation:

: formula_8

where
: formula_9

and formula_10 and formula_11 are the equatorial radius (semi-major axis) and the polar radius (semi-minor axis), respectively. formula_12 is the square of the first numerical eccentricity of the ellipsoid. formula_13 is the flattening of the ellipsoid. The &quot;prime vertical radius of curvature&quot; formula_14 is the distance from the surface to the Z-axis along the ellipsoid normal.

====Properties====
The following condition holds for the longitude in the same way as in the geocentric coordinates system:
:formula_15

And the following holds for the latitude:
:formula_16

where formula_17, as the parameter formula_7 is eliminated by subtracting
:formula_19

and
:formula_20

The following holds furthermore, derived from dividing above equations:
:formula_21

====Orthogonality====
The orthogonality of the coordinates is confirmed via differentiation:
:formula_22
where
:formula_23

(see also &quot;Meridian arc on the ellipsoid&quot;).
=== From ECEF to geodetic coordinates ===
====Conversion for the longitude====
The conversion of ECEF coordinates to longitude is:
: formula_24. 
where atan2 is the quadrant-resolving arc-tangent function.
The geocentric longitude and geodetic longitude have the same value; this is true for Earth and other similar shaped planets because they have a large amount of rotational symmetry around their spin axis (see triaxial ellipsoidal longitude for a generalization).

==== Simple iterative conversion for latitude and height ====
The conversion for the latitude and height involves a circular relationship involving &quot;N&quot;, which is a function of latitude:
:formula_25,
:formula_26.
It can be solved iteratively, for example, starting with a first guess &quot;h&quot;≈0 then updating &quot;N&quot;.
More elaborate methods are shown below. 
The procedure is, however, sensitive to small accuracy due to formula_27 and formula_7 being maybe 10 apart.
==== Newton–Raphson method ====
The following Bowring&#x27;s irrational geodetic-latitude equation, derived simply from the above properties, is efficient to be solved by Newton–Raphson iteration method:
: formula_29

where formula_30 and formula_17 as before. The height is calculated as:
: formula_32

The iteration can be transformed into the following calculation:
: formula_33

where formula_34

The constant formula_35 is a good starter value for the iteration when formula_36. Bowring showed that the single iteration produces a sufficiently accurate solution. He used extra trigonometric functions in his original formulation.
==== Ferrari&#x27;s solution ====
The quartic equation of formula_37, derived from the above, can be solved by Ferrari&#x27;s solution to yield:
: formula_38

===== The application of Ferrari&#x27;s solution =====
A number of techniques and algorithms are available but the most accurate, according to Zhu, is the following procedure established by Heikkinen, as cited by Zhu. This overlaps with above. It is assumed that geodetic parameters formula_39 are known

: formula_40

Note: arctan2[Y, X] is the four-quadrant inverse tangent function.

==== Power series ====
For small the power series
:formula_41

starts with
:formula_42

=== Geodetic to/from ENU coordinates ===
To convert from geodetic coordinates to local tangent plane (ENU) coordinates is a two-stage process:

# Convert geodetic coordinates to ECEF coordinates
# Convert ECEF coordinates to local ENU coordinates

==== From ECEF to ENU ====

To transform from ECEF coordinates to the local coordinates we need a local reference point. Typically, this might be the location of a radar. If a radar is located at formula_43 and an aircraft at formula_44, then the vector pointing from the radar to the aircraft in the ENU frame is

: formula_45

Note: formula_5 is the &quot;geodetic latitude&quot;; the &quot;geocentric latitude&quot; is inappropriate for representing vertical direction for the local tangent plane and must be converted if necessary.

==== From ENU to ECEF ====

This is just the inversion of the ECEF to ENU transformation so

: formula_47

=== Conversion across map projections ===

Conversion of coordinates and map positions among different map projections reference to the same datum may be accomplished either through direct translation formulas from one projection to another, or by first converting from a projection formula_48 to an intermediate coordinate system, such as ECEF, then converting from ECEF to projection formula_49. The formulas involved can be complex and in some cases, such as in the ECEF to geodetic conversion above, the conversion has no closed-form solution and approximate methods must be used. References such as the &quot;DMA Technical Manual 8358.1&quot; and the USGS paper &quot;Map Projections: A Working Manual&quot; contain formulas for conversion of map projections. It is common to use computer programs to perform coordinate conversion tasks, such as with the DoD and NGA supported GEOTRANS program.

== Datum transformations ==

Transformations among datums can be accomplished in a number of ways. There are transformations that directly convert geodetic coordinates from one datum to another. There are more indirect transforms that convert from geodetic coordinates to ECEF coordinates, transform the ECEF coordinates from one datum to another, then transform ECEF coordinates of the new datum back to geodetic coordinates. There are also grid-based transformations that directly transform from one (datum, map projection) pair to another (datum, map projection) pair.

=== Helmert transformation ===

Use of the Helmert transform in the transformation from geodetic coordinates of datum formula_48 to geodetic coordinates of datum formula_49 occurs in the context of a three-step process:

# Convert from geodetic coordinates to ECEF coordinates for datum formula_48
# Apply the Helmert transform, with the appropriate formula_53 transform parameters, to transform from datum formula_48 ECEF coordinates to datum formula_49 ECEF coordinates
# Convert from ECEF coordinates to geodetic coordinates for datum formula_49

In terms of ECEF XYZ vectors, the Helmert transform has the form (position vector transformation convention and very small rotation angles simplification)

: formula_57

The Helmert transform is a seven-parameter transform with three translation (shift) parameters formula_58, three rotation parameters formula_59 and one scaling (dilation) parameter formula_60. The Helmert transform is an approximate method that is accurate when the transform parameters are small relative to the magnitudes of the ECEF vectors. Under these conditions, the transform is considered reversible.

A fourteen-parameter Helmert transform, with linear time dependence for each parameter, can be used to capture the time evolution of geographic coordinates dues to geomorphic processes, such as continental drift and earthquakes. This has been incorporated into software, such as the Horizontal Time Dependent Positioning (HTDP) tool from the U.S. NGS.

=== Molodensky-Badekas transformation ===

To eliminate the coupling between the rotations and translations of the Helmert transform, three additional parameters can be introduced to give a new XYZ center of rotation closer to coordinates being transformed. This ten-parameter model is called the &quot;Molodensky-Badekas transformation&quot; and should not be confused with the more basic Molodensky transform.

Like the Helmert transform, using the Molodensky-Badekas transform is a three-step process:
# Convert from geodetic coordinates to ECEF coordinates for datum formula_48
# Apply the Molodensky-Badekas transform, with the appropriate formula_53 transform parameters, to transform from datum formula_48 ECEF coordinates to datum formula_49 ECEF coordinates
# Convert from ECEF coordinates to geodetic coordinates for datum formula_49

The transform has the form

: formula_66

where formula_67 is the origin for the rotation and scaling transforms and formula_68 is the scaling factor.

The Molodensky-Badekas transform is used to transform local geodetic datums to a global geodetic datum, such as WGS 84. Unlike the Helmert transform, the Molodensky-Badekas transform is not reversible due to the rotational origin being associated with the original datum.

=== Molodensky transformation ===

The Molodensky transformation converts directly between geodetic coordinate systems of different datums without the intermediate step of converting to geocentric coordinates (ECEF). It requires the three shifts between the datum centers and the differences between the reference ellipsoid semi-major axes and flattening parameters.

The Molodensky transform is used by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) in their standard TR8350.2 and the NGA supported GEOTRANS program. The Molodensky method was popular before the advent of modern computers and the method is part of many geodetic programs.

=== Grid-based method ===

Grid-based transformations directly convert map coordinates from one (map-projection, geodetic datum) pair to map coordinates of another (map-projection, geodetic datum) pair. An example is the NADCON method for transforming from the North American Datum (NAD) 1927 to the NAD 1983 datum. The High Accuracy Reference Network (HARN), a high accuracy version of the NADCON transforms, have an accuracy of approximately 5 centimeters. The National Transformation version 2 (NTv2) is a Canadian version of NADCON for transforming between NAD 1927 and NAD 1983. HARNs are also known as NAD 83/91 and High Precision Grid Networks (HPGN). Subsequently, Australia and New Zealand adopted the NTv2 format to create grid-based methods for transforming among their own local datums.

Like the multiple regression equation transform, grid-based methods use a low-order interpolation method for converting map coordinates, but in two dimensions instead of three. The NOAA provides a software tool (as part of the NGS Geodetic Toolkit) for performing NADCON transformations.

=== Multiple regression equations ===

Datum transformations through the use of empirical multiple regression methods were created to achieve higher accuracy results over small geographic regions than the standard Molodensky transformations. MRE transforms are used to transform local datums over continent-sized or smaller regions to global datums, such as WGS 84. The standard NIMA TM 8350.2, Appendix D, lists MRE transforms from several local datums to WGS 84, with accuracies of about 2 meters.

The MREs are a direct transformation of geodetic coordinates with no intermediate ECEF step. Geodetic coordinates formula_69 in the new datum formula_49 are modeled as polynomials of up to the ninth degree in the geodetic coordinates formula_71 of the original datum formula_48. For instance, the change in formula_73 could be parameterized as (with only up to quadratic terms shown)

:formula_74

where
: formula_75 parameters fitted by multiple regression
: formula_76
: formula_77 scale factor
: formula_78 origin of the datum, formula_79

with similar equations for formula_80 and formula_81. Given a sufficient number of formula_82 coordinate pairs for landmarks in both datums for good statistics, multiple regression methods are used to fit the parameters of these polynomials. The polynomials, along with the fitted coefficients, form the multiple regression equations.

<doc id="379823" wikidata="Q2639207" url="?curid=379823" title="Rock-climbing equipment">
<text>Rock-climbing equipment varies with the specific type of climbing that is undertaken. Bouldering needs the least equipment outside of climbing shoes, climbing chalk and optional crash pads. Sport climbing adds ropes, harnesses, belay devices, and quickdraws to clip into pre-drilled bolts. Traditional climbing adds the need to carry a &quot;rack&quot; of temporary passive and active protection devices. Multi-pitch climbing, and the related big wall climbing, adds devices to assist in ascending and descending fixed ropes. Finally, aid climbing uses unique equipment to give mechanical assistance to the climber in their upward movement (e.g. aiders).

Advances in equipment are a key part of the rock climbing history, starting with the climbing rope. Modern devices enable climbers to perform tasks previously done manually, with greater control – in all conditions – and with less effort. Examples of replacements include the harness (replaced tying the rope around the waist), the carabiner (replaced many knots), the descender/abseil device (replaced the dülfersitz), the ascender (replaced the prusik knot), the belay device (replaced the body belay), and nuts/hexes (replaced chockstones).

Modern equipment includes dynamic ropes, plyometric training tools, advanced spring-loaded camming devices (SLCDs) for protection, and advanced rope control devices such as self-locking devices (SLDs), progress capture devices (PCDs), and assisted braking devices (ABDs). Modern equipment uses advanced materials that are increasingly more durable, stronger, and lighter (e.g. spectra/dyneema and aluminum alloys). The equipment must meet specific standards (e.g. the UIAA standards) for strength, durability, and reliability, and must be certified and tested against such standards with individual pieces carrying such certification marks.

== Use and certification==
===Type of climbing===
The rock-climbing equipment needed varies materially depending on the type of rock climbing being undertaken. Starting from the least equipment-intensive type of climbing, the general equipment needs are as follows:

* Free solo climbing, and its deep-water soloing variant, require the least equipment as no climbing protection or ropes are used. Equipment is generally limited to climbing shoes and chalk with a chalk bag.
* Bouldering, and its competition bouldering variant, uses the same basic equipment of free soloing but with the optional addition of bouldering mats, which are also called crash mats or crash pads.
* Top rope climbing, and its competition speed climbing variant, adds a rope, harness, and belay device. The rope is hung prior to the climb from the anchor point at the top, typically by carabiners, slings, or cord, or some combination thereof.
* Sport climbing, and its competition lead climbing variant, adds quickdraws that are clipped into the pre-drilled on-site bolts while the climber is lead climbing the route. No additional climbing protection is needed.
* Traditional climbing requires most of the equipment of the above disciplines but with the addition of extensive climbing protection equipment (nuts, hexes, and SLCDs), which the climber will insert while lead climbing the route. The weight of the extra protection may require a stronger harness or a gear sling.
* Multi-pitch climbing, which can be done in sport or traditional formats, requires added rope devices like ascenders and descenders for moving up and down fixed-ropes. The big wall variant requires heavy-duty rope devices for carrying more gear such as portaledges and provisions, which are carried in haul bags.
* Rope solo climbing is done in many formats (sport, traditional, multi-pitch), and needs an extensive range of rope devices as every pitch needs to be solo climbed (using self-locking devices or SLDs), descended back down (using descenders), and then re-ascended (using ascenders). The simpler variant of top rope solo climbing, only requires the SLDs.
* Aid climbing, and its clean aid climbing variant, is usually done in a traditional format and also more likely on multi-pitch and big wall routes. In addition to the standard equipment for such routes, aid climbing uses specialist equipment such as aiders and daisy chains, as well as hammers for pitons and copperheads.

===Certification===

Rock-climbing equipment is broadly classed as Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). The International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation (known as the UIAA) was an important early body—and the only body pre-1995—in setting standards for climbing equipment. The UIAA Safety Commission continues to play a central worldwide role in this area. The European Committee for Standardization (CEN) is also an important major regulatory body for PPE, and which works closely with the UIAA Safety Commission through its CEN Working Group for Mountaineering Equipment.

North America has fewer specific regulations as rock-climbing equipment is not classed as military or professional PPE and thus does not fall under the American Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations; in effect, the UIAA and CEN have become the most important bodies for setting standards and regulating rock-climbing equipment worldwide, and most major manufacturers, and distributors, produce equipment certified and stamped with UIAA and CE marking. After the United Kingdom left the European Union, it adopted the UKCA certification in place of the CEN.

== Ropes and slings==

===Ropes===
Modern climbing ropes are in length—the longer versions are for multi-pitch climbing—and have a kernmantle construction consisting of a core kern of twisted nylon fibers and an outer sheath mantle of woven colored coarse nylon fibers. They are either dynamic ropes, which can stretch to absorb the energy of a falling climber, or are the less expensive but more hard-wearing static ropes, which are only for use in constant-load situations such as descending (e.g. abseiling) and ascending (e.g. jumaring).

Some climbers will use a single full-thickness climbing rope with a diameter of approximately , and some will use double ropes, or &quot;half-ropes&quot;, to reduce rope drag (e.g. one rope is clipped into any given anchor or protection point), which have a reduced thickness of approximately to limit the weight of the extra rope. Twin roping uses two thinner ropes, typically in thickness, which are both clipped into each protection point. Twin roping is thus not used for reducing rope drag, but to have a backup rope on long climbs.

===Slings===
Modern webbing (or &quot;tape&quot;) is made of strong tubular nylon or the even stronger spectra/dyneema material. Climbers use webbing that has been sewn using a certified standard of reinforced stitching into various lengths of closed loops called &quot;slings&quot; (or &quot;runners&quot;). They can be used in a wide range of situations, including wrapping around sections of rock for abseiling, creating belay anchors, or as passive protection, or tied to other equipment—often via carabiners—to create a longer version of a quickdraw or a makeshift lanyard.

Slings can be made into more complex pieces of equipment such as the daisy chain, which is used in aid climbing, and the personal anchor system, which is used in securing a climber to a fixed anchor point.

===Cords===
While lengths of webbing can be tied via a knot, such as a water knot, to create custom-length loops instead of the pre-sewn fixed-length slings, their load-bearing capacity can be materially reduced making them less safe. Climbers instead use cord (or &quot;accessory cord&quot;), which is a length of thinner approximately static kernmantle rope, tied via a double fisherman&#x27;s knot into closed loops of any size.

Cord loops (also known as &quot;cordelettes&quot;) serve a wide variety of functions in rock climbing. Uses include creating friction prusik knots for ascending or gripping fixed climbing ropes, usually using thinner approximately cord, or for attaching to, and equalizing forces across, multiple fixed anchors points, such as when setting up abseil or belay anchors on multi-pitch climbing routes, usually using thicker approximately cord.

==Rope connectors==

Several modern pieces of rope connecting equipment help climbers to securely attach items to the climbing rope, such as themselves via a modern climbing harness, or their various protection devices via modern carabiners and quickdraws. Before the invention of these pieces of rope-connecting equipment, climbers used alternative techniques such as looping the rope around the body instead of a harness (e.g. the body belay) and looping the rope around various rocks as a form of protection. In addition to these early techniques, climbers also used various climbing knots to tie ropes and anchor points together, which are now all replaced by rope-connecting equipment such as carabiners.

===Carabiners===
Carabiners are closed metal clips with spring-loaded gates that are used as connectors between the rope and various devices. Modern carabiners are made from a lightweight but strong aluminum alloy that can withstand the load of a fall. Carabiners come in various shapes, with the asymmetric/offset D-shape being the most common, and gate styles (e.g. a straight gate or a bent gate). A particular variation is whether the gate is locking, which gives extra security when belaying but makes the carabiner heavier and slightly tricker to clip into, or non-locking, which is the easiest to clip into and out of for example when leading a bolted sport climbing route but with the risk that the gate may unintentionally open.

=== Harnesses ===

Climbing harnesses are used for connecting the rope to the climber via a &quot;belay loop&quot; on the harness. Harnesses are made of strong materials to specific strength guidelines that can withstand the load of a major fall. There are many types of harness designs and materials used depending on the type of climbing undertaken. Examples include minimal &quot;sit&quot; harnesses for sport climbing as they require little in the way of gear-carrying loops, lightweight and detachable leg-loop harnesses for alpine climbing that fit around heaving winter clothing, padded harnesses for big wall climbing that give comfort for hanging belays and abseils, and chest/full-body harnesses for children or carrying heavy loads.

===Lanyards===
Lanyards (or &quot;teather&quot;, or &quot;via ferrata set&quot;) are much longer versions of quickdraws that attach from a harness to a rope (or other anchor points, such as a metal cable). The difference is that lanyards are much stronger than quickdraws and are capable of withstanding fall factors of 2 as found on via ferrata or on multi-pitch climbing routes. They are often made from materials that can absorb dynamic energy and often come with additional optional fall energy absorption devices, and lanyards that have had heavy falls often have to be discarded. Lanyards are also constructed to be sufficiently flexible to resist being twisted.

====Personal anchor systems====

A sub-class of lanyards is the personal anchor system (PAS), which is a section of rope or interconnected chains of slings, which are used to tie the harness to an anchor point such as a belay station. Traditionally, climbers would tie their harness to anchors using part of the climbing rope; however, the PAS has become popular as a way to avoid reducing the effective length of the climbing rope, and to use a more straightforward connection.

===Quickdraws===
Quickdraws are used by climbers to connect ropes to fixed points such as bolted anchors in sport climbing, or protection devices in traditional climbing. The quickdraw consists of two non-locking carabiners connected by a short, pre-sewn loop of webbing. They are used to reduce the friction and drag between the rope and the fixed point that can occur when the rope is just clipped into a carabiner clipped into the fixed point. In competition climbing, the quickdraws are already hanging from the pre-fixed bolts, which is called &quot;pinkpointing&quot; in sport climbing. The quickdraws used in advanced sport and in competition climbing routes often have a &quot;bent gate&quot; on the lower carabiner to make clipping-into the quickdraw even easier.

==Rope devices==

Several devices are used for controlling the rope (e.g. belay devices and self-locking devices), moving up the rope (e.g. ascender devices), or moving down the rope (e.g. rappel/abseil or descender devices). These actions were historically performed by climbers with no mechanical devices (e.g. the body belay for belaying, the dülfersitz abseil for descending, and the prusik knot for ascending), and these mechanical devices help with both control and safety in all conditions (e.g. wet or icy ropes).

=== Ascenders ===
Ascenders (also called &quot;jumars&quot; or &quot;crolls&quot; after popular brands) are mechanical devices to enable a climber to move up a fixed rope, which is a static rope that is hanging from a fixed anchor. Ascenders perform the same basic function as friction or prusik knots made from cord but far less effort and concentration are needed to use them (e.g. tired climbers at high-altitude), they can handle much heavier loads (e.g. climbers with ruck-sacks), and they are more reliable in all conditions (e.g. on wet and icy ropes). The ascender uses an internal cam that allows the device to slide freely in one direction but tightly grip the rope when pulled on in the opposite direction. To prevent the ascender device from accidentally falling off the rope, a locking carabiner is also used.

=== Belay devices ===
Belay devices are mechanical friction-brake devices used to control the climbing rope(s) when belaying a climber. Their main purpose is to allow the rope to be locked off or fully braked with minimal effort when arresting a climber&#x27;s fall. There are many kinds of belay devices, such as the original passive braking devices like &quot;sticht plates&quot; and the later &quot;tubers/tubulars&quot; (e.g. the original Black Diamond ATC, or the Petzl Reverso).

The range of modern belay devices also includes auto-block devices (e.g. the GiGi) allowing the belay device to be attached to a separate anchor point (e.g. and not to the belayer, which is useful for bringing up the second-climber on multi-pitch routes), and active assisted-braking devices (ABDs) that will self-lock with sudden rope movements (e.g. the Petzl GriGri or the Wild Country Revo). Some passive belay devices may also be used as descenders for abseiling.

Indoor climbing walls can provide on-site fixed mechanical auto belay devices that enable the climber to top rope a route alone; more recent lead auto belay models allow the climber to also lead climb the route alone.

=== Descenders===
Descenders (or abseil devices) enable a climber to abseil (or rappel) down a fixed or static rope that is hanging from a fixed anchor. They perform the same basic function as the dülfersitz abseil but with more control and less effort. The classic passive descender, and still widely used, is the figure-eight, although it is offered in more complex variations with &quot;ears&quot; and &quot;wings&quot; to prevent the rope from locking up.

Many passive belay devices can be used as descenders, such as tubers/tubulars. Some modern descenders come with self-locking device (SLD) features that will grip the rope in the event of an uncontrolled fall (e.g. the ). Heavy-duty descenders such as abseil racks are used for greater control and friction when carrying heavy loads or in very wet or icy conditions (e.g. big wall climbing and caving). The modern technique is to use a descender with a Personal Anchor System.

=== Self-locking devices ===
Self-locking devices (SLDs), also called progress capture devices (PCDs), are the terms given to the broader class of rope devices that allow the climbing rope to move more freely in one direction but will lock quickly if the rope tries to move in the opposite direction. Their basic action means that several can also be used as emergency ascenders or assisted-belaying devices (ABDs), but they come in a broad range for a variety of uses (e.g. as a hauling or rescue pulley, like the Petzl Traxion).

The most complex use is for rope solo climbing, for which devices such as Wren&#x27;s Silent Partner, the Petzel GriGri, and the Wild Country Revo have been used (rope solo climbing requires the widest range of rope devices including ascenders and descenders), or the more straightforward top rope solo climbing, for which the Petzl Micro Traxion and Camp Lift have been used.

== Protection devices ==

As discussed in types of climbing, rock climbing protection devices are mainly used in traditional climbing and in sport climbing, both of which can be done in single and multi-pitch formats. In addition, clean aid climbing also uses many of the traditional climbing protection devices.

===Temporary===

Temporary protection devices (also known as &quot;pro&quot;, &quot;gear&quot; or the &quot;rack&quot;), provide the means to place temporary anchor points on the rock to which a lead climber can clip their rope (via a quickdraw) when traditional climbing; they also can be used for anchor points for belaying and abseiling. The devices are categorized as being &quot;active&quot; (i.e. they dynamically move or adjust in the case of a fall), or &quot;passive&quot; (i.e., they maintain a static position throughout).

====Active====
* Spring-loaded camming devices (SLCDs, or &quot;friends&quot;, &quot;camalots&quot;) consist of two to four aluminum cams mounted on a spring-loaded axle (or two adjacent axles), in such a way that pulling on the shaft connected to the axle forces the cams to narrow so they can be inserted into small cracks. Once the SLCD is inserted into the crack, its cams will maintain a constant camming angle of 13.75 degrees against the walls of the crack. SLCDs are by far the most popular form of active protection device.
* Big Bros (or tube chocks) are large hollow telescopic aluminum tubes manufactured by Trango whose width can be dynamically adjusted to fit across large off-width cracks that are too wide for standard SLCDs.
* Removable bolts (or RBs) are a type of SLCD for insertion into pre-drilled bolt holes, but instead of using cams, the system uses a metal tube that once inserted expands to grip against the walls of the hole. Less frequently in use, their main application is for climbers creating bolted routes.

====Passive====
* Nuts (also &quot;stoppers&quot;, &quot;wires&quot; or &quot;chocks&quot;) are the most common form of passive protection, which replaced chockstones with curved blocks of strong aluminum alloy attached to a loop of wire. They are wedged into narrowing/tapering cracks (they do not work well in wide or parallel cracks) and then tugged firmly to set them in place. Nuts come in many varieties (e.g. offset-shaped HB nuts, micro nuts, and brass RP nuts). Where the Australian carrot bolts are common, the wire loop can be used as an emergency substitute for a bolt plate, like a rivet hanger.
* Hexes are hollow asymmetrical hexagonal tubes attached to a loop of cord, particularly for large hexes, or wire. Often wider than nuts, their asymmetrical shape allows their use in parallel and even widening cracks. They are placed like a nut ideally into a narrowing section of the crack and any fall will cause the hex to twist in its placement, thus exerting sideways force on the wall of the crack. Modern climbers tend to use SLCDs over hexes.
* Tricams are shaped aluminum blocks attached to lengths of webbing tape, like with a nut. The block is shaped so that pulling on the tape makes it &quot;cam&quot; against the crack walls, gripping the rock tighter in a similar fashion to a hex. Tricams may also be placed similarly to a nut, relying only on the constriction of a crack. Tricams are not as easy to place or remove as an SLCD but they can fit into narrow cracks and pockets, in some cases being the only type of protection that will work on a particular feature. Tricams are typically cheaper and lighter than SLCDs and are less in use today.

===Fixed===

Fixed protection devices are permanent on-site anchors to which a lead climber can clip their rope – often via a quickdraw – when they are sport climbing; they also can be used to create anchor points for belaying and abseiling. The main types are:

* Bolts are steel expansion bolts are pre-drilled into the rock with a hand drill and tightened with a torque wrench. Some versions use a type of glue to anchor the bolt. Before insertion, a bolt hanger is attached into which carabiners and quickdraws can be clipped. Modern stainless steel bolts last for over a decade but have a finite life span after which they must be replaced. Titanium bolts may be used for even greater durability, or in harsher environments like sea-side cliffs, but these are more expensive. Some bolted crags use fixed permadraws, which are on-site wire quickdraws that are permanently attached to the bolt hangers.
* Pitons pre-date bolts and are steel spikes – the older versions were made from iron – that could be hammered into cracks in the rock and that have an eye-hole for attaching a carabiner (some would have pre-installed metal rings). Unlike bolts, pitons need a crack into which they can be hammered, and come in a wide variety of shapes and designs (e.g. angles, knifeblades, lost arrows) to fit various cracks, and even micro-cracks like RURPs. Pitons have been largely replaced by the stronger bolts as the fixed protection of choice but are still an important part of big wall climbing and of aid climbing (but not clean aid climbing, which rules out any use of hammers).

==Aid equipment==

Aid climbing uses several of the above devices but in a way that gives &quot;aid&quot; to the climber in ascending (e.g. pulling up on pitons and hooks). There are also a number of other pieces of equipment that are more exclusively associated with aid climbing.

* Aiders (or the French &quot;etriers&quot;) are short 5–6 rung ladders made of lightweight webbing and are a central part of the technique of aid climbing. They are normally used in pairs where the aid climber stands on one aider while clipping in the higher aider. Aiders can also come as &quot;offset style&quot; aiders, which are 5–6 stirrup-loops arranged on either side of a central rope, and as lightweight &quot;adjustable style&quot; aiders so the climber can create customized rung sizes.
* Daisy chains are long webbing slings that have multiple small loops for carabiner attachment, which are made by stitching the sling at intervals. Like aiders, daisy chains are also a central part of aid climbing. They are used to attach the harness to the aider. Care has to be taken not to clip into the loops incorrectly, which can cause the daisy chain to fail and rip apart (e.g. when trying to use it as a Personal Anchor System).
* Copperheads (or &quot;bashie&quot;) are a type of soft-metal nut, usually made from copper, which can be hammered into very thin cracks that are too small for even the narrowest piton. Copperheads are only used in aid climbing but their low strength means that they can only handle the &quot;static bodyweight&quot; of an ascending aid climber and will likely fail if the climber makes a dynamic fall. At times, climbers will &quot;clean out&quot; build-ups of copperheads on an aid climbing route.
* Hooks are steel hooks of various shapes (e.g. bat hook, talon hook, grappling hook, etc.,) that are hung from cracks and flakes (e.g. the fifi hook and skyhook). They are mostly used in aid climbing but have been used in extreme traditional climbing routes as a last resort where the hook placement may not withstand a dynamic fall. A particular type of hook is a rivet hanger that can be attached to old metal rivets–an example being Australian carrot bolts–permanently fastened into the rock face.
* Rock climbing hammers are a type of hammer made to insert various types of pitons while ascending routes; clean aid climbing does not allow the use of hammers because all clean aid equipment must only be inserted on a temporary basis.

== Clothing equipment ==

Rock climbers use several pieces of specialized clothing equipment including:

* Belay glasses allow the belayer to look up at the lead climber without having to strain their neck upwards (i.e. the glasses are tilted upwards by 45 degrees), and are used when there is extensive belaying such as on long routes, or by climbing instructors.
* Belay gloves are used to protect the hands and are commonly needed on big wall climbing routes. Their construction from leather or other hard-wearing materials, generally improves grip with the rope, which lessens the risk of a failure of the belay system.
* Climbing shoes are designed to increase the friction, and thus the grip, between the foot and the climbing surface with a vulcanized rubber sole. Stiffer shoes are used for &quot;edging&quot; and softer soles for &quot;smearing&quot;.
* Climbing helmets protect the skull against falling debris such as rocks in alpine climbing or dropped pieces of equipment, as well as the impact forces on the head during a fall while climbing, particularly when the falling lead climber is flipped over.

== Miscellaneous equipment==

Rock climbers may also use a range of other specialized equipment including:

* Bouldering mats are used to protect boulder climbers from the frequent falls that happen in bouldering, which while shorter than other types of climbing, can be onto uneven or hard surfaces from awkward body positions, leading to injury. 
* Climbing chalk is widely used by rock climbers to help absorb moisture on their hands; the chalk is kept in a &quot;chalk bag&quot; that is hung around the waist area. US boulderer John Gill is largely credited with introducing &quot;gymnastic chalk&quot; to climbing in the 1950s (he was a gymnast himself).
* Gear slings are loops of webbing (often with some padding) worn diagonally across the chest on longer traditional climbing routes (e.g. multi-pitch climbing) when the climber cannot comfortably arrange their protection equipment on the gear loops of their harnesses.
* Guidebooks are hard-wearing books (i.e. they will be taken on the climb) outlining the key details of the climbing routes including diagram (or topos) of the routes and the grades of difficulty of each individual pitch.
* Haul bags are large tubular bags of hardwearing construction (so they can be dragged over rock) into which supplies and climbing equipment can be carried on long multi-pitch routes; commonly used in big wall climbing that calls them &quot;pigs&quot; due to the effort of hauling them up on pulleys.
* Knee pads are neoprene pads that are worn on the lower thigh to protect a climber when performing a knee bar; knee pads are credited with improving climbing standards and climbing grades and their use has become accepted in free climbing.
* Medical tape (&quot;tape&quot; can also refer to webbing) is used by climbers to prevent and repair skin injuries. For example, tape lessens skin damage while hand jamming on rough granite surfaces; it is also used to cover skin that has been worn down on the fingers, while crack climbing.
* Nut tool (or &quot;nut key&quot;) is a metal tool used to help retrieve nuts and hexes that have become firmly wedged into cracks.
* Portaledges are used in big wall climbing as a temporary overnight sleeping platform; they are also used as a resting platform for long belays, which are typical on big wall aid climbing routes.
* Pulleys are used by big wall climbers to help bring up haul bags and other pieces of equipment.
* Stick clips (or &quot;clip sticks&quot;) are long poles with a quickdraw at one end which can be clipped into the first bolt of a sport climbing route by a climber standing on the ground; avoids the risk of a ground-fall before clipping into the first piece of protection.
* Wire brushes are used to clean holds, particularly at the higher graded climbing routes where the holds are very small and need to be dry and free of any debris or vegetation to be usable; toothbrushes may be used to clean the smallest holds without damaging them.

== Training equipment ==

Various items of equipment are employed during climbing-specific training to strengthen the climber&#x27;s fingers, tendons, and muscles:

* Bachar ladder is a narrow and flexible ladder, typically capable of being rolled up, made from metal, PVC, or webbing that is hung horizontally between two points – usually with one point higher to create a slope – that the climber ascends and descends the rungs using only their arm strength with no use is made of their feet; it is an early version of a campus board but that focused on arm strength and not hand/finger strength.
* Campus board is a series of horizontal rungs attached to an overhanging surface that is typically climbed up and down without the aid of the feet. When used properly, campus boards improve finger strength and also dynamic or plyometric, muscle strength.
* Grip saver is a small device that can help in developing the antagonist muscles to those used while gripping with the hand. Use of such a device can prevent the ligament injuries that are experienced by climbers.
* Hangboard (or &quot;fingerboard&quot;) is related to the campus board and was developed to focus on building static arm and finger strength; it is a popular training tool for rock climbers and comes in many forms and materials.
* MoonBoard. A rectangular section of climbing wall, typically overhanging at 40 degrees, onto which climbing holds have been fixed in a dense grid-like fashion; modern MoonBoards have almost 200 holds from which over 55,000 graded boulder problems have been created.

<doc id="379828" wikidata="Q192120" url="?curid=379828" title="Cyanosis">
<text>Cyanosis is the change of body tissue color to a bluish-purple hue, as a result of decrease in the amount of oxygen bound to the hemoglobin in the red blood cells of the capillary bed. Cyanosis is apparent usually in the body tissues covered with thin skin, including the mucous membranes, lips, nail beds, and ear lobes. Some medications may cause discoloration such as medications containing amiodarone or silver. Furthermore, mongolian spots, large birthmarks, and the consumption of food products with blue or purple dyes can also result in the bluish skin tissue discoloration and may be mistaken for cyanosis. Appropriate physical examination and history taking is a crucial part to diagnose cyanosis. Management of cyanosis involves treating the main cause, as cyanosis is not a disease, but rather a symptom.

Cyanosis is further classified into central cyanosis and peripheral cyanosis.

== Pathophysiology ==

The mechanism behind cyanosis is different depending on whether it is central or peripheral.

=== Central cyanosis ===
Central cyanosis occurs due to decrease in arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2), and begins to show once the concentration of deoxyhemoglobin in the blood reaches a concentration of ≥ 5.0 g/dL (≥ 3.1 mmol/L or oxygen saturation of ≤ 85%). This indicates a cardiopulmonary condition.

Causes of central cyanosis are discussed below.

=== Peripheral cyanosis ===
Peripheral cyanosis happens when there is increased concentration of deoxyhemoglobin on the venous side of the peripheral circulation. In other words, cyanosis is dependent on the concentration of deoxyhemoglobin. Patients with severe anemia may appear normal despite higher-than-normal concentrations of deoxyhemoglobin. While patients with increased amounts of red blood cells (e.g., polycythemia vera) can appear cyanotic even with lower concentrations of deoxyhemoglobin.

== Causes ==

=== Central cyanosis ===
Central cyanosis is often due to a circulatory or ventilatory problem that leads to poor blood oxygenation in the lungs. It develops when arterial oxygen saturation drops below 85% or 75%.

Acute cyanosis can be a result of asphyxiation or choking and is one of the definite signs that ventilation is being blocked.
Central cyanosis may be due to the following causes:

# Central nervous system (impairing normal ventilation):
#* Intracranial hemorrhage
#* Drug overdose (e.g., heroin)
#* Generalized tonic–clonic seizure (GTCS)
# Respiratory system:
#* Pneumonia
#* Bronchiolitis
#* Bronchospasm (e.g., asthma)
#* Pulmonary hypertension
#* Pulmonary embolism
#* Hypoventilation
#* Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD (emphysema)
# Cardiovascular system: 
#* Congenital heart disease (e.g., Tetralogy of Fallot, right to left shunts in heart or great vessels)
#* Heart failure
#* Valvular heart disease
#* Myocardial infarction
# Hemoglobinopathies:
#* Methemoglobinemia 
#* Sulfhemoglobinemia 
#* Polycythemia
#* Congenital cyanosis (HbM Boston) arises from a mutation in the α-codon which results in a change of primary sequence, H → Y. Tyrosine stabilizes the Fe(III) form (oxyhaemoglobin) creating a permanent T-state of Hb.
# Others:
#* High altitude, cyanosis may develop in ascents to altitudes &gt;2400 m.
#* Hypothermia
#* Frostbite
#* Obstructive sleep apnea
=== Peripheral cyanosis ===

Peripheral cyanosis is the blue tint in fingers or extremities, due to an inadequate or obstructed circulation. The blood reaching the extremities is not oxygen-rich and when viewed through the skin a combination of factors can lead to the appearance of a blue color. All factors contributing to central cyanosis can also cause peripheral symptoms to appear, but peripheral cyanosis can be observed in the absence of heart or lung failures. Small blood vessels may be restricted and can be treated by increasing the normal oxygenation level of the blood.

Peripheral cyanosis may be due to the following causes:
* All common causes of central cyanosis
* Reduced cardiac output (e.g., heart failure or hypovolemia)
* Cold exposure
* Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
*Arterial obstruction (e.g., peripheral vascular disease, Raynaud phenomenon)
* Venous obstruction (e.g., deep vein thrombosis)

=== Differential cyanosis ===
Differential cyanosis is the bluish coloration of the lower but not the upper extremity and the head. This is seen in patients with a patent ductus arteriosus. Patients with a large ductus develop progressive pulmonary vascular disease, and pressure overload of the right ventricle occurs. As soon as pulmonary pressure exceeds aortic pressure, shunt reversal (right-to-left shunt) occurs. The upper extremity remains pink because deoxygenated blood flows through the patent duct and directly into the descending aorta while sparing the brachiocephalic trunk, left common carotid, and left subclavian arteries.

== Evaluation ==
A detailed history and physical examination (particularly focusing on the cardiopulmonary system) can guide further management and help determine the medical tests to be performed. Tests that can be performed include pulse oximetry, arterial blood gas, complete blood count, methemoglobin level, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, X-Ray, CT scan, cardiac catheterization, and hemoglobin electrophoresis.

In newborns, peripheral cyanosis typically presents in the distal extremities, circumoral, and periorbital areas. Of note, mucous membranes remain pink in peripheral cyanosis as compared to central cyanosis where the mucous membranes are cyanotic.
Skin pigmentation and hemoglobin concentration can affect the evaluation of cyanosis. Cyanosis may be more difficult to detect on people with darker skin pigmentation. However, cyanosis can still be diagnosed with careful examination of the typical body areas such as nail beds, tongue, and mucous membranes where the skin is thinner and more vascular. As mentioned above, patients with severe anemia may appear normal despite higher than normal concentrations of deoxyhemoglobin. Signs of severe anemia may include pale mucosa (lips, eyelids, and gums), fatigue, lightheadedness, and irregular heartbeats.
== Management ==
Cyanosis is a symptom, not a disease itself, so management should be focused on treating the underlying cause.

If it is an emergency, management should always begin with securing the airway, breathing, and circulation. In patients with significant respiratory distress, supplemental oxygen (in the form of nasal canula or continuous positive airway pressure depending on severity) should be given immediately.

If the methemoglobin levels are positive for methemoglobinemia, first-line treatment is to administer methylene blue.

== History ==
The name &quot;cyanosis&quot; literally means &quot;the blue disease&quot; or &quot;the blue condition&quot;. It is derived from the color cyan, which comes from &quot;cyanós (κυανός)&quot;, the Greek word for &quot;blue&quot;.

It is postulated by Dr. Christen Lundsgaard that cyanosis was first described in 1749 by Jean-Baptiste de Sénac, a French physician who served King Louis XV. De Sénac concluded from an autopsy that cyanosis was caused by a heart defect that led to the mixture of arterial and venous blood circulation. But it was not until 1919, when Dr. Lundsgaard was able to derive the concentration of deoxyhemoglobin (&quot;8 volumes per cent&quot;) that could cause cyanosis.

<text>The White Book refers to a standard of compact disc that stores not only sound but also still pictures and motion video. It was released in 1993 by Sony, Philips, Matsushita, and JVC. These discs, most commonly found in Asia, are usually called &quot;Video CDs&quot; (VCD). In some ways, VCD can be thought of as the successor to the Laserdisc and the predecessor to DVD. Note that Video CD should not be confused with CD Video which was an earlier and entirely different format.

Several extensions to the White Book were published in later years: VCD 2.0 in 1995, VCD-Internet in 1997, and Super Video CD (SVCD) in 1998. The standard is not freely available and must be licensed from Philips.

The White Book also defines the more general CD-i Bridge format (also called CD-Bridge or simply &quot;bridge discs&quot;), which are CD-ROM XA discs with an additional Green Book CD-i specific application program. The CD-ROM XA information in bridge discs can be obtained through CD-ROM drives, while CD-i players can use the CD-i program to read bridge discs as well (hence the &quot;bridge&quot; status between CD-ROMs and CD-i discs). Bridge discs must conform to both the CD-ROM XA and Green Book CD-i specifications. VCDs and SVCDs fall under the category of bridge discs, as do Photo CDs and Karaoke CDs.

The following is a summary of the specifications for VCDs and SVCDs. For more details, see Video CD and Super Video CD.

<text>John Franklin &quot;Johnny&quot; Sain (September 25, 1917 – November 7, 2006) was an American right-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball who was best known for teaming with left-hander Warren Spahn on the Boston Braves teams from 1946 to 1951. He was the runner-up for the National League&#x27;s Most Valuable Player Award in the Braves&#x27; pennant-winning season of 1948, after leading the National League in wins, complete games and innings pitched. He later became further well known as one of the top pitching coaches in the majors.

==Military service==
Beginning in late 1942, Sain served in the United States Navy during World War II. As a navy pilot, he spent the next three years stateside, while also playing baseball on the navy bases. He was discharged in November 1945.

==Pitching star of post-war Boston Braves==
Born in Havana, Arkansas, Sain pitched for 11 years, winning 139 games and losing 116 in his career and compiled an earned run average of 3.49. His best years were those immediately after World War II, when he won 100 games for the Boston Braves, before being traded to the New York Yankees during the 1951 season for Lew Burdette and cash.

Sain had the distinction of being the first pitcher in the Major Leagues to face Jackie Robinson. In 1943, while participating in a benefit game for the Red Cross, Sain became the last man to pitch against Babe Ruth in organized baseball.

In 1948, Sain won 24 games against 15 losses and finished second in the voting for the Most Valuable Player Award behind the St. Louis Cardinals&#x27; Stan Musial, who had won two legs of the Triple Crown. Sain and teammate Spahn achieved joint immortality that year when their feats were the subject of sports editor Gerald V. Hern&#x27;s poem in the &quot;Boston Post&quot; which was eventually shortened to the epigram &quot;Spahn and Sain and Pray for Rain&quot; According to the &quot;Baseball Almanac&quot;, the original doggerel appeared in Hern&#x27;s column on September 14, 1948:

&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em&quot;&gt;
First we&#x27;ll use Spahn
then we&#x27;ll use Sain
Then an off day
followed by rain
Back will come Spahn
followed by Sain
And followed
we hope
by two days of rain.
&lt;/poem&gt;

The poem was inspired by the performance of Sain and Spahn during the Braves&#x27; 1948 pennant drive. The team swept a Labor Day doubleheader, with Spahn throwing a complete game 14-inning win in the opener, and Sain pitching a shutout in the second game. Following two off days, it did rain. Spahn won the next day, and Sain won the day after that. Three days later, Spahn won again. Sain won the next day. After one more off day, the two pitchers were brought back, and won another doubleheader. The two pitchers had gone 8–0 in twelve days&#x27; time.

That year, the Boston Braves won their second, latter National League pennant of the post-1901 era, but fell in six games to the Cleveland Indians in the 1948 World Series. Sain won the first game of the Series, a 1–0 shutout at Braves Field that included a memorable play in which Boston catcher Phil Masi was called safe after an apparent pickoff at second base. Masi went on to score the game&#x27;s only run.

With the Yankees, Sain became a relief pitcher and enjoyed late-career success, leading the American League in saves with 22 in 1954. He finished his career in 1955 with the Kansas City Athletics.

When Sain was pitching, he thought that merely throwing the ball was not enough to get the ball to vary its course as it travelled to home plate. In order to throw a pitch such as a curveball or a screwball, he had to snap his wrist.

A very good hitting pitcher in his 11 year major league career, Sain posted a .245 batting average with 69 runs, 3 home runs and 101 RBI.

==Pitching coach==
After retiring as a player, Sain spent many years as a well-regarded and outspoken pitching coach for the Oakland Athletics, New York Yankees, Minnesota Twins, Detroit Tigers, Chicago White Sox and Atlanta Braves. During the 1960s, Sain coached the pitchers of five of the American League&#x27;s ten pennant-winning teams.

While serving as the Yankees pitching coach, Sain picked up an apple one day and poked a broken car antenna through it. Spinning the apple, Sain came to the idea that he could do the same with a baseball by inserting a wooden rod into it, enabling him to spin the ball differently, imitating the spins used for different pitches. Sain eventually patented the idea and sold his product from his home in Arkansas.

An independent thinker among coaches, Sain tended to be admired by his pitchers, although he battled with at least two of his managers—Sam Mele of the Twins and Mayo Smith of the Tigers—when he disagreed with them. In each case, Sain was fired, but the manager&#x27;s dismissal soon followed when his pitching staff suffered from Sain&#x27;s absence. Sain did not make friends among owners and general managers, either, when he would advise pitchers to &quot;climb those golden stairs&quot; to their teams&#x27; front offices to demand more money in salary talks. Sain was also well known for ignoring running drills most pitchers despised. He frequently told pitchers and managers &quot;You don&#x27;t run the damn ball across the plate. If running did it, they&#x27;d look for pitchers on track teams.&quot;

Jim Bouton, in his book &quot;Ball Four&quot;, expressed unreserved admiration for Sain, who had been his pitching tutor in New York during his first two Major League seasons, 1962 and 1963. Bouton openly wished to pitch for the 1969 Tigers in order to have yet another opportunity to benefit from Sain&#x27;s coaching. Sain and Bouton were briefly reunited in the Atlanta Braves system in 1978. Ned Garver said Sain was the best pitching coach he ever encountered. &quot;If he had an idea that he thought could be of value to you, he would tell you about it to try to help you, but by the time he finished visiting with you about it, you would think that you&#x27;d thought of it yourself,&quot; Garver described Sain&#x27;s approach.

Tommy John, on the other hand, had trouble working with Sain, who kept trying to get the pitcher to throw a slider, a pitch which always gave John trouble. &quot;Sain could show you how to throw any pitch in the book, but he couldn&#x27;t look at your motion and tell if your mechanics were off,&quot; recalled John. &quot;For a sinkerballer [which John was], that spells trouble.&quot;

Pitchers who won 20 or more games under Sain&#x27;s coaching include Jim Kaat, Whitey Ford, Mudcat Grant, Denny McLain, Jim Bouton, Al Downing, Jim Perry, Wilbur Wood, and Stan Bahnsen.

==Personal life==

Sain was married twice. His first wife was Doris May McBride of Dallas. They were married on October 1, 1945 and had four children: John Jr., Sharyl, Ronda and Randy. The couple divorced in 1970. Sain&#x27;s second wife was Mary Ann Zaremba, whom he married on August 24, 1972. They had no children together. Sain was disabled by a stroke in 2002. He died at age 89 in Downers Grove, Illinois. At the time of his death, Sain had 11 grandchildren.

<doc id="379832" wikidata="Q520894" url="?curid=379832" title="Sirtaki">
<text>Sirtaki or syrtaki () is a dance of Greek origin, choreographed for the 1964 film &quot;Zorba the Greek&quot;. It is a recent Greek folkdance, and a mixture of &quot;syrtos&quot; and the slow and fast rhythms of the hasapiko dance. The dance and the accompanying music by Mikis Theodorakis are also called Zorba&#x27;s dance, the Zorba or &quot;the dance of Zorba&quot;. The dance has become popular in Greece and is identified with the Greeks, becoming an invented tradition.

The name &quot;sirtaki&quot; comes from the Greek word syrtos – from σύρω (τον χορό), which means &quot;drag (the dance)&quot; or &quot;lead (the dance)&quot; – a common name for a group of traditional Greek dances of so-called &quot;dragging&quot; style, as opposed to pidikhtos (πηδηχτός), a hopping or leaping style. Despite its name, sirtaki incorporates both syrtos (in its slower part) and pidikhtós (in its faster part) elements.

==Choreography==
The dance was created specifically for the film &quot;Zorba the Greek&quot; rather than using a traditional form of dance. The name &quot;sirtaki&quot; suggests it was based on a traditional Cretan dance form, &quot;syrtos&quot;, a type of dance where the dancers drag their feet instead of hopping, however, the dance also incorporates both a slower hasapiko dance style, and a faster hasaposerviko style. The dance is therefore an amalgamation of three different dance styles. It also has some characteristics of the zeybek dance. The choreography of the dance for the film has been attributed to Giorgos Provias.

During the filming of &quot;Zorba the Greek&quot;, Stelios Katsivelakis taught choreography to Anthony Quinn (although another dancer teacher contests this, claiming that several dancers, including himself, were involved in teaching Quinn), including various Greek dances such as the &quot;Kalamatianos&quot;, &quot;Chaniotikos syrtos&quot; (syrtos of Chania), &quot;pentozali&quot; with the &quot;psalidia&quot; (scissor-like) movements, and &quot;hasapiko&quot;. The &quot;zeibekiko&quot; was initially omitted, as the director felt it was not a suitable dance for a non-Greek and that the &quot;hasapiko&quot; looked better on screen. Quinn claimed that because he had problem doing a hopping motion due to a broken foot, he invented the dragging-sliding dance steps that he said a villager taught him, as well as coming up with its name on the fly when the film was being shot. Quinn could not perform the fast part of choreography planned for the final scene by the choreographer, and the choreography had to be changed on the spot. It is claimed that this explains the crane shot moving away from the protagonists at the end of the film.

The dance was named &quot;Sirtaki&quot; at the first screening of the film.

In Stamatis Kokotas&#x27; 1966 song &quot;Στου Όθωνα τα χρόνια&quot; (&quot;In the days of King Otto&quot;) there is an anachronistic reference to the king&#x27;s Bavarian bodyguards dancing sirtaki.

===Performance===
Groups of dancers can perform the sirtaki in a line or circle formation with hands held on neighbours&#x27; shoulders. When performing alone, the sirtaki-dancer raises his arms horizontally on both sides of the body. Parts of the leg movements may be suggestive of crushing of grapes.

Meter is , tempo increasing, and often the signature is changed to 2/4 in the fastest part. Accordingly, the dance begins with slower, smoother actions, gradually transforming into faster, vivid ones, often including hops and leaps.

==Guinness World Records==

On August 31, 2012, the previous Sirtaki Dance Guinness World Record (Cyprus, 2010, 1672 persons) was broken by 5,614 people dancing sirtaki for five minutes by the sea, starting from the port of the city of Volos in Greece. The Association for Social Impact and Culture to the Municipality of Magnisia organized the event on the main beach of the town of Volos under the light of the second full moon of the month. Some 5,614 people, aged from 14 to 89, danced to the music of Mikis Theodorakis&#x27; Zorba the Greek, filling the town square and making it into the Guinness World Records. Enthusiasts from Volos, Larisa, Athens, Thessaloniki, Trikala, and the Greek islands joined the regional union of blind people, the national synchronized swimming team and many ordinary citizens. The idea came from a Volos resident, Alexia Halvatzakou, who suggested it to the municipal services as an alternative way to promote the area. The President of the Association for Social Impact and Culture, Costas Halevas, liked the idea and set about organizing the event.

<doc id="379833" wikidata="Q5300067" url="?curid=379833" title="Double negation">
<text>In propositional logic, the double negation of a statement states that &quot;it is not the case that the statement is not true&quot;. In classical logic, every statement is logically equivalent to its double negation, but this is not true in intuitionistic logic; this can be expressed by the formula A ≡ ~(~A) where the sign ≡ expresses logical equivalence and the sign expresses negation.

Like the law of the excluded middle, this principle is considered to be a law of thought in classical logic, but it is disallowed by intuitionistic logic. The principle was stated as a theorem of propositional logic by Russell and Whitehead in &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; as:

:: formula_1
::&quot;This is the principle of double negation, &quot;i.e.&quot; a proposition is equivalent of the falsehood of its negation.&quot;

== Elimination and introduction ==
Double negation elimination and double negation introduction are two valid rules of replacement. They are the inferences that, if &quot;not not-A&quot; is true, then &quot;A&quot; is true, and its converse, that, if &quot;A&quot; is true, then &quot;not not-A&quot; is true, respectively. The rule allows one to introduce or eliminate a negation from a formal proof. The rule is based on the equivalence of, for example, &quot;It is false that it is not raining.&quot; and &quot;It is raining.&quot;

The &quot;double negation introduction&quot; rule is:
:&quot;P formula_2 P&quot;
and the &quot;double negation elimination&quot; rule is:
:&quot;P formula_2 P&quot;

Where &quot;formula_2&quot; is a metalogical symbol representing &quot;can be replaced in a proof with.&quot;

In logics that have both rules, negation is an involution.

=== Formal notation ===

The &quot;double negation introduction&quot; rule may be written in sequent notation:
:formula_5

The &quot;double negation elimination&quot; rule may be written as:
:formula_6

In rule form:
:formula_7
and
:formula_8

or as a tautology (plain propositional calculus sentence):
:formula_9
and
:formula_10

These can be combined into a single biconditional formula:

:formula_11.

Since biconditionality is an equivalence relation, any instance of ¬¬&quot;A&quot; in a well-formed formula can be replaced by &quot;A&quot;, leaving unchanged the truth-value of the well-formed formula.

Double negative elimination is a theorem of classical logic, but not of weaker logics such as intuitionistic logic and minimal logic. Double negation introduction is a theorem of both intuitionistic logic and minimal logic, as is formula_12.
Because of their constructive character, a statement such as &quot;It&#x27;s not the case that it&#x27;s not raining&quot; is weaker than &quot;It&#x27;s raining.&quot; The latter requires a proof of rain, whereas the former merely requires a proof that rain would not be contradictory. This distinction also arises in natural language in the form of litotes.

==Proofs==
===In classical propositional calculus system===
In Hilbert-style deductive systems for propositional logic, double negation is not always taken as an axiom (see list of Hilbert systems), and is rather a theorem. We describe a proof of this theorem in the system of three axioms proposed by Jan Łukasiewicz:
:A1. formula_13
:A2. formula_14
:A3. formula_15

We use the lemma formula_16 proved here, which we refer to as (L1), and use the following additional lemma, proved here:
:(L2) formula_17

We first prove formula_18. For shortness, we denote formula_19 by φ0. We also use repeatedly the method of the hypothetical syllogism metatheorem as a shorthand for several proof steps.
:(1) formula_20       (instance of (A1))
:(2) formula_21       (instance of (A3))
:(3) formula_22       (instance of (A3))
:(4) formula_23       (from (2) and (3) by the hypothetical syllogism metatheorem)
:(5) formula_24       (instance of (A1))
:(6) formula_25       (from (4) and (5) by the hypothetical syllogism metatheorem)
:(7) formula_26       (instance of (L2))
:(8) formula_27       (from (1) and (7) by modus ponens)
:(9) formula_28       (from (6) and (8) by the hypothetical syllogism metatheorem)

We now prove formula_29.

:(1) formula_30       (instance of the first part of the theorem we have just proven)
:(2) formula_31       (instance of (A3))
:(3) formula_29       (from (1) and (2) by modus ponens)

And the proof is complete.

<doc id="379840" wikidata="Q2633817" url="?curid=379840" title="One-sided limit">
<text>In calculus, a one-sided limit refers to either one of the two limits of a function formula_1 of a real variable formula_2 as formula_2 approaches a specified point either from the left or from the right.

The limit as formula_2 decreases in value approaching formula_5 (formula_2 approaches formula_5 &quot;from the right&quot; or &quot;from above&quot;) can be denoted:

formula_8

The limit as formula_2 increases in value approaching formula_5 (formula_2 approaches formula_5 &quot;from the left&quot; or &quot;from below&quot;) can be denoted:

formula_13

If the limit of formula_1 as formula_2 approaches formula_5 exists then the limits from the left and from the right both exist and are equal. In some cases in which the limit
formula_17
does not exist, the two one-sided limits nonetheless exist. Consequently, the limit as formula_2 approaches formula_5 is sometimes called a &quot;two-sided limit&quot;. 

It is possible for exactly one of the two one-sided limits to exist (while the other does not exist). It is also possible for neither of the two one-sided limits to exist.

==Formal definition==

===Definition===
If formula_20 represents some interval that is contained in the domain of formula_21 and if formula_5 is a point in formula_20 then the right-sided limit as formula_2 approaches formula_5 can be rigorously defined as the value formula_26 that satisfies:
formula_27
and the left-sided limit as formula_2 approaches formula_5 can be rigorously defined as the value formula_30 that satisfies:
formula_31

We can represent the same thing more symbolically, as follows.

Let formula_20 represent an interval, where formula_33, and formula_34.
:formula_35
:formula_36

===Intuition===

In comparison to the formal definition for the limit of a function at a point, the one-sided limit (as the name would suggest) only deals with input values to one side of the approached input value.

For reference, the formal definition for the limit of a function at a point is as follows:

:formula_37

To define a one-sided limit, we must modify this inequality. Note that the absolute distance between formula_2 and formula_5 is

formula_40

For the limit from the right, we want formula_2 to be to the right of formula_5, which means that formula_43, so formula_44 is positive. From above, formula_44 is the distance between formula_2 and formula_5. We want to bound this distance by our value of formula_48, giving the inequality formula_49. Putting together the inequalities formula_50 and formula_49 and using the transitivity property of inequalities, we have the compound inequality formula_52.

Similarly, for the limit from the left, we want formula_2 to be to the left of formula_5, which means that formula_55. In this case, it is formula_56 that is positive and represents the distance between formula_2 and formula_5. Again, we want to bound this distance by our value of formula_48, leading to the compound inequality formula_60.

Now, when our value of formula_2 is in its desired interval, we expect that the value of formula_1 is also within its desired interval. The distance between formula_1 and formula_30, the limiting value of the left sided limit, is formula_65. Similarly, the distance between formula_1 and formula_26, the limiting value of the right sided limit, is formula_68. In both cases, we want to bound this distance by formula_69, so we get the following: formula_70 for the left sided limit, and formula_71 for the right sided limit.

==Examples==

Example 1: 
The limits from the left and from the right of formula_72 as formula_2 approaches formula_74 are
formula_75
The reason why formula_76 is because formula_2 is always negative (since formula_78 means that formula_79 with all values of formula_2 satisfying formula_81), which implies that formula_82 is always positive so that formula_83 diverges to formula_84 (and not to formula_85) as formula_2 approaches formula_87 from the left. 
Similarly, formula_88 since all values of formula_2 satisfy formula_90 (said differently, formula_2 is always positive) as formula_2 approaches formula_87 from the right, which implies that formula_82 is always negative so that formula_95 diverges to formula_96 
Example 2: 
One example of a function with different one-sided limits is formula_97 (cf. picture) where the limit from the left is formula_98 and the limit from the right is formula_99 
To calculate these limits, first show that 
formula_100
(which is true because formula_101)
so that consequently, 
formula_102
whereas 
formula_103 because the denominator diverges to infinity; that is, because formula_104 
Since formula_105 the limit formula_106 does not exist.

==Relation to topological definition of limit==

The one-sided limit to a point formula_107 corresponds to the general definition of limit, with the domain of the function restricted to one side, by either allowing that the function domain is a subset of the topological space, or by considering a one-sided subspace, including formula_108 Alternatively, one may consider the domain with a half-open interval topology.

==Abel&#x27;s theorem==
A noteworthy theorem treating one-sided limits of certain power series at the boundaries of their intervals of convergence is Abel&#x27;s theorem.

<text>Gregory Crewdson (born September 26, 1962) is an American photographer who makes large-scale, cinematic, psychologically charged prints of staged scenes set in suburban landscapes and interiors. He directs a large production and lighting crew to construct his images.

==Early life and education==

Crewdson was born in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. As a child, he attended Brooklyn Friends School, and then John Dewey High School.

As a teenager, he was part of a power pop group called the Speedies. Their song &quot;Let Me Take Your Photo&quot; was used in 2005 by Hewlett-Packard in advertisements to promote its digital cameras.

Crewdson attended Purchase College, State University of New York, where he initially planned to study psychology. At Purchase, he enrolled in a photography course taught by Laurie Simmons and also studied with Jan Groover. He received an MFA in photography from the Yale School of Art.

==Life and work==
Crewdson is a professor and the director of graduate studies in photography at Yale School of Art.


Crewdson&#x27;s photographs are elaborately planned, produced, and lit using crews familiar with motion picture production who light large scenes using cinema production equipment and techniques. He works with a lighting team, art director, make-up and wardrobe department, props and effects to create mood, atmosphere, and open-ended narrative images. He has worked with the same director of photography, Richard Sands, along with other core team members, for some 25 years. He works much like a director with a budget similar to that of a movie production, each image involves dozens of people and weeks to months of planning.

Using shots that resemble film productions, Crewdson deconstructs American suburban life in his work. He has cited the films &quot;Vertigo&quot;, &quot;The Night of the Hunter&quot;, &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;, &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;, and &quot;Safe&quot; as having influenced his style, as well as the painter Edward Hopper and photographer Diane Arbus.

Crewdson&#x27;s most widely-known bodies of work include &quot;Twilight&quot; (1998–2002), &quot;Beneath the Roses&quot; (2003–2008), &quot;Cathedral of the Pines&quot; (2013–2014), &quot;An Eclipse of Moths&quot; (2018–2019), and &quot;Eveningside&quot; (2021–2022). Crewdson&#x27;s only body of work made outside of the U.S. was &quot;Sanctuary&quot; (2009), set at the abandoned Cinecittá studios outside of Rome. Nearly all of his other work before and since was made in the small towns and cities in Western Massachusetts.

In 2012, he was the subject of the feature documentary film &quot;Gregory Crewdson: Brief Encounters&quot;. The film series followed the construction of and an explanation by Crewdson of his thought process and vision for pieces of &quot;Beneath the Roses&quot;.

==Personal life==
As of 2020, Crewdson lives primarily in western Massachusetts in a former Methodist church. His long time partner, Juliane Hiam, is a writer and producer and the two work closely together. Hiam has also appeared as a subject in numerous of Crewdson&#x27;s pictures. Crewdson has two children from a previous marriage. Crewdson is an open-water swimmer and has said that the meditative state he achieves with his daily swimming practice is fundamental to his creative process as an artist.

<text>The Nizkor Project (, &quot;we will remember&quot;) is an Internet-based project run by B&#x27;nai Brith Canada which is dedicated to countering Holocaust denial.

==About the project==
The website was founded by Ken McVay as a central Web-based archive for the large numbers of documents made publicly available by the users of the newsgroup &quot;alt.revisionism&quot; and gifted to B&#x27;nai Brith Canada in 2010.

The site also archives numerous postings made to the newsgroup since the early 1990s. It does not archive every single posting ever made to the newsgroup; rather, the maintainers of the web site have selected various messages for display that are seen as presenting factual information about the Holocaust; or, in the case of some posters, about the authors of the messages themselves.

In addition to providing an extensive archive of documents regarding the Holocaust, including the transcripts of the 1st Nuremberg Tribunal, the Nizkor Project also seeks to expose the activities of Holocaust deniers themselves. Based on the postings to the newsgroup over the years, it has compiled extensive writings from self-proclaimed revisionists, including David Irving, Ernst Zündel, Michael A. Hoffman II, and others.
Among the various pieces of information stored at Nizkor is a sound recording of an answering machine message allegedly made by white supremacist Tom Metzger, encouraging various individuals to &quot;take action&quot; against &quot;Zinkor on the Internet.&quot;

In 2009, the Simon Wiesenthal Center congratulated the Nizkor Project for having initiated an effort which led to the successful prosecution of three Nazi war criminals.

===Criticisms===
Holocaust denial web sites and spokespersons challenged McVay&#x27;s neutrality and attacked him personally. The original Nizkor web site was accused by self-proclaimed &quot;Holocaust revisionists&quot; and neo-Nazi Web sites as being funded by Israel and other Zionist sources, though McVay consistently denied these charges. He stated that the Nizkor Project was funded solely by donations from the general public, as well as his own personal finances.

In the late 1990s, the Simon Wiesenthal Center criticized the Nizkor Project for increasing the visibility of hate groups and Holocaust deniers, even as it sought to debunk them. This debate between free speech advocates such as McVay and those who favor the suppression of speech with hate crime laws continued throughout the late 1990s, but has now mostly been resolved with the two sides agreeing on the common goal of confronting Holocaust deniers and keeping their disagreements over specific tactics private. In 1996, McVay spoke out against Internet hate crime laws in Canada in front of a committee of the Canadian parliament, stating that it is better to address the false claims of Holocaust deniers, rather than to censor them.

<text>In differential calculus and differential geometry, an inflection point, point of inflection, flex, or inflection (rarely inflexion) is a point on a smooth plane curve at which the curvature changes sign. In particular, in the case of the graph of a function, it is a point where the function changes from being concave (concave downward) to convex (concave upward), or vice versa.

For the graph of a function of differentiability class (its first derivative , and its second derivative , exist and are continuous), the condition can also be used to find an inflection point since a point of must be passed to change from a positive value (concave upward) to a negative value (concave downward) or vice versa as is continuous; an inflection point of the curve is where and changes its sign at the point (from positive to negative or from negative to positive). A point where the second derivative vanishes but does not change its sign is sometimes called a point of undulation or undulation point.

In algebraic geometry an inflection point is defined slightly more generally, as a regular point where the tangent meets the curve to order at least 3, and an undulation point or hyperflex is defined as a point where the tangent meets the curve to order at least 4.

==Definition==
Inflection points in differential geometry are the points of the curve where the curvature changes its sign.

For example, the graph of the differentiable function has an inflection point at if and only if its first derivative has an isolated extremum at . (this is not the same as saying that has an extremum). That is, in some neighborhood, is the one and only point at which has a (local) minimum or maximum. If all extrema of are isolated, then an inflection point is a point on the graph of at which the tangent crosses the curve.

A &quot;falling point of inflection&quot; is an inflection point where the derivative is negative on both sides of the point; in other words, it is an inflection point near which the function is decreasing. A &quot;rising point of inflection&quot; is a point where the derivative is positive on both sides of the point; in other words, it is an inflection point near which the function is increasing.

For a smooth curve given by parametric equations, a point is an inflection point if its signed curvature changes from plus to minus or from minus to plus, i.e., changes sign.

For a smooth curve which is a graph of a twice differentiable function, an inflection point is a point on the graph at which the second derivative has an isolated zero and changes sign.

In algebraic geometry, a non singular point of an algebraic curve is an &quot;inflection point&quot; if and only if the intersection number of the tangent line and the curve (at the point of tangency) is greater than 2. The main motivation of this different definition, is that otherwise the set of the inflection points of a curve would not be an algebraic set. In fact, the set of the inflection points of a plane algebraic curve are exactly its non-singular points that are zeros of the Hessian determinant of its projective completion.

==Conditions==

=== A necessary but not sufficient condition ===
For a function &quot;f&quot;, if its second derivative exists at and is an inflection point for , then , but this condition is not sufficient for having a point of inflection, even if derivatives of any order exist. In this case, one also needs the lowest-order (above the second) non-zero derivative to be of odd order (third, fifth, etc.). If the lowest-order non-zero derivative is of even order, the point is not a point of inflection, but an &quot;undulation point&quot;. However, in algebraic geometry, both inflection points and undulation points are usually called &quot;inflection points&quot;. An example of an undulation point is for the function given by .

In the preceding assertions, it is assumed that has some higher-order non-zero derivative at , which is not necessarily the case. If it is the case, the condition that the first nonzero derivative has an odd order implies that the sign of is the same on either side of in a neighborhood of . If this sign is positive, the point is a &quot;rising point of inflection&quot;; if it is negative, the point is a &quot;falling point of inflection&quot;.

===Sufficient conditions===
# A sufficient existence condition for a point of inflection in the case that is times continuously differentiable in a certain neighborhood of a point with odd and , is that for and . Then has a point of inflection at .
# Another more general sufficient existence condition requires and to have opposite signs in the neighborhood of  (Bronshtein and Semendyayev 2004, p. 231).

==Categorization of points of inflection==
Points of inflection can also be categorized according to whether is zero or nonzero.
* if is zero, the point is a &quot;stationary point of inflection&quot;
* if is not zero, the point is a &quot;non-stationary point of inflection&quot;

A stationary point of inflection is not a local extremum. More generally, in the context of functions of several real variables, a stationary point that is not a local extremum is called a saddle point.

An example of a stationary point of inflection is the point on the graph of . The tangent is the -axis, which cuts the graph at this point.

An example of a non-stationary point of inflection is the point on the graph of , for any nonzero . The tangent at the origin is the line , which cuts the graph at this point.

==Functions with discontinuities==
Some functions change concavity without having points of inflection. Instead, they can change concavity around vertical asymptotes or discontinuities. For example, the function formula_1 is concave for negative and convex for positive , but it has no points of inflection because 0 is not in the domain of the function.

==Functions with inflection points whose second derivative does not vanish==
Some continuous functions have an inflection point even though the second derivative is never 0. For example, the cube root function is concave upward when x is negative, and concave downward when x is positive, but has no derivatives of any order at the origin.

<text>Lynette Woodard (born August 12, 1959) is an American basketball player and former head women&#x27;s basketball coach at Winthrop University.

Woodward played college basketball for the Kansas Jayhawks. She became the first female member of the Harlem Globetrotters and, at age 38, began playing as one of the oldest members in the newly formed American women&#x27;s professional basketball league, the WNBA. She is a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame.

==Biography==
Woodward led Wichita North High School to state basketball championships in 1975 and 1977. She scored 1,678 points and collected 1,030 rebounds in just 62 high school games in three seasons.

Woodard went on to play college basketball with the University of Kansas (KU) in 1978, playing there until 1981 in the AIAW era of college basketball. She was a four-time All-American at KU, and averaged 26 points per game and scored 3,649 points in total during her four years there, and was the first KU woman to be honored by having her jersey retired. Before being passed by Caitlin Clark of Iowa on February 28, 2024, Woodard was the unofficial major college basketball&#x27;s career women&#x27;s scoring leader due to the NCAA not recognizing statistics from the AIAW.

In 1981, she was signed by an Italian team, UFO Schio (Vicenza), to participate in their league.

In 1984, she was a member of the United States women&#x27;s basketball team that won the gold medal at the Los Angeles Olympic Games.

In 1985, Woodard became the first woman ever to play with the Globetrotters. Incidentally, Woodard&#x27;s cousin, Hubert &quot;Geese&quot; Ausbie, also played for the Globetrotters from 1961 to 1985.

In 1989, she was inducted into the National High School Hall of Fame. In 1990, she was inducted into the Kansas Sports Hall of Fame, and was signed by a Japanese women&#x27;s team to play in their country. She played there until 1993.

In 1997, she was signed by the Cleveland Rockers of the newly founded Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA). The following year, she was selected in an expansion draft by the Detroit Shock. Woodard&#x27;s final WNBA game ever was played on August 19, 1998, in a 82–68 win over the New York Liberty where she recorded 18 points, 9 rebounds, 3 assists and 2 steals. She was waived by the Shock on May 7, 1999. During the WNBA&#x27;s off-season, she began working as a stockbroker in New York City.

She retired from playing in 1999 and returned to KU serving as assistant coach of the women&#x27;s basketball team. In late January 2004, she was named interim head coach, filling for the regular coach Marian Washington, who had retired for medical reasons. She also served as athletics director for the Kansas City, Missouri School District from 1992 to 1994.

In September 2004, she was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts. In June 2005, she was inducted into the Women&#x27;s Basketball Hall of Fame in Knoxville, Tennessee.

Woodard also received the 2015 WBCBL Women&#x27;s Professional Basketball &quot;Trailblazer&quot; Award on August 2, 2015, along with 9 other female basketball Icons including Cynthia Cooper, Nancy Lieberman, Sarah Campbell, E.C. Hill, Geri Kay Hart, Robelyn Garcia, Kandi Conda, Lisa Leslie and Tamika Catchings. The award recognizes some of the most influential people in professional women&#x27;s basketball, specifically those who helped blaze the trail, shape the overall landscape and pave the way for women&#x27;s professional basketball.

Woodard became a financial consultant for A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc., in Wichita.

In 2017, she was named the head coach of the Winthrop Eagles women&#x27;s basketball team.

==USA Basketball==
Woodard was named to the team representing the US at the 1979 World University Games, held in Mexico City, Mexico. The USA team won all seven games to take the gold medal. The USA team played and beat Cuba twice, the team that had defeated them at the Pan Am games. Woodard averaged 14.1 points per game.

Woodard was selected to be a member of the team representing the US at the 1980 Olympics, but the team did not go, due to the 1980 Olympic boycott. The team did go 6–1 in Olympic Qualifying games, with Woodard scoring 4.5 points per game.

Woodard was selected to be a member of the team representing the US at the 1983 Pan American Games held in Caracas, Venezuela. The team won all five games to earn the gold medal for the event. Woodard averaged 19.0 points per game and 4.0 rebounds per game, both second best on the team.

Woodard played for the USA National team in the 1983 World Championships, held in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The team won six games, but lost two against the Soviet Union. In an opening round game, the USA team had a nine-point lead at halftime, but the Soviets came back to take the lead, and a final shot by the USA failed to drop, leaving the USSR team with a one-point victory 85–84. The USA team won their next four games, setting up the gold medal game against the USSR. This game was also close, and was tied at 82 points each with six seconds to go in the game. The Soviets&#x27; Elena Chausova received the inbounds pass and hit the game winning shot in the final seconds, giving the USSR team the gold medal with a score of 84–82. The USA team earned the silver medal. Woodard averaged 15.8 points per game, second highest on the team, and recorded 33 steals to lead the team.

Woodard was a member of the USA National team at the 1990 World Championships, held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The team won their opening round games fairly easily, with the closest of the first three games a 27-point victory over Czechoslovakia. Then they faced Cuba, a team that had beaten the US in exhibition matches only a few weeks earlier. The USA team was losing at halftime, but came back to win 87–78. The USA team found itself behind at halftime to Canada in their next game, but came back to win easily 95–70. After an easy match against Bulgaria, the USA team faced Czechoslovakia again, and achieved an almost identical result, winning 87–59. In the title match, the USA team won the gold medal with a score of 88–78. Woodard averaged 6.3 points per game.

In 1984, the USA sent its National team to the 1984 William Jones Cup competition in Taipei, Taiwan, for pre-Olympic practice. The team easily beat each of the eight teams they played, winning by an average of just under 50 points per game. Woodard averaged 11.6 points per game.

Woodard played with the USA team at the 1991 Pan American Games. The team finished with a record of 4–2, but managed to win the bronze medal. The USA team lost a three-point game to Brazil, then responded with wins over Argentina and Cuba, earning a spot in the medal round. The next game was a rematch against Cuba, and this time the team from Cuba won a five-point game. The USA beat Canada to win the bronze. Woodard averaged 2.3 points per game.

<doc id="379847" wikidata="Q2600201" url="?curid=379847" title="Mertens conjecture">
<text>In mathematics, the Mertens conjecture is the statement that the Mertens function formula_1 is bounded by formula_2. Although now disproven, it had been shown to imply the Riemann hypothesis. It was conjectured by Thomas Joannes Stieltjes, in an 1885 letter to Charles Hermite (reprinted in ), and again in print by , and disproved by .
It is a striking example of a mathematical conjecture proven false despite a large amount of computational evidence in its favor.

== Definition ==

In number theory, the Mertens function is defined as

: formula_3

where μ(k) is the Möbius function; the Mertens conjecture is that for all &quot;n&quot; &gt; 1,

: formula_4

== Disproof of the conjecture ==
Stieltjes claimed in 1885 to have proven a weaker result, namely that formula_5 was bounded, but did not publish a proof. (In terms of formula_6, the Mertens conjecture is that formula_7.)

In 1985, Andrew Odlyzko and Herman te Riele proved the Mertens conjecture false using the Lenstra–Lenstra–Lovász lattice basis reduction algorithm:
: formula_8 and formula_9
It was later shown that the first counterexample appears below formula_10 but above 1016. The upper bound has since been lowered to formula_11 or approximately formula_12 and then again to formula_13. In 2024, Seungki Kim and Phong Nguyen lowered the bound to formula_14, but no &quot;explicit&quot; counterexample is known.

The law of the iterated logarithm states that if is replaced by a random sequence of +1s and −1s then the order of growth of the partial sum of the first terms is (with probability 1) about which suggests that the order of growth of might be somewhere around . The actual order of growth may be somewhat smaller; in the early 1990s Steve Gonek conjectured that the order of growth of was formula_15 which was affirmed by Ng (2004), based on a heuristic argument, that assumed the Riemann hypothesis and certain conjectures about the averaged behavior of zeros of the Riemann zeta function.

In 1979, Cohen and Dress found the largest known value of formula_16 for and in 2011, Kuznetsov found the largest known negative value (largest in the sense of absolute value) formula_17 for In 2016, Hurst computed for every but did not find larger values of .

In 2006, Kotnik and te Riele improved the upper bound and showed that there are infinitely many values of for which but without giving any specific value for such an . In 2016, Hurst made further improvements by showing
: formula_18 and formula_19

== Connection to the Riemann hypothesis ==

The connection to the Riemann hypothesis is based on the Dirichlet series
for the reciprocal of the Riemann zeta function,

:formula_20

valid in the region formula_21. We can rewrite this as a 
Stieltjes integral

:formula_22

and after integrating by parts, obtain the reciprocal of the zeta function
as a Mellin transform

:formula_23

Using the Mellin inversion theorem we now can express in terms of as

:formula_24

which is valid for , and valid for on the Riemann hypothesis. 
From this, the Mellin transform integral must be convergent, and hence
 must be for every exponent &quot;e&quot; greater than . From this it follows that 
:formula_25

for all positive is equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis, which therefore would have followed from the stronger Mertens hypothesis, and follows from the hypothesis of Stieltjes that
:formula_26

<doc id="379851" wikidata="Q1410845" url="?curid=379851" title="The Dish">
<text>The Dish is a 2000 Australian historical comedy-drama film that tells the story of the Parkes Observatory&#x27;s role in relaying live television of humanity&#x27;s first steps on the Moon during the Apollo 11 mission in 1969. It was the top-grossing Australian film in 2000.

==Plot==
An old man drives up to the Parkes Radio Telescope to admire the dish. A technician gently cautions him that he has driven in through &quot;the old entrance&quot; and is therefore trespassing. Requesting that the man leave immediately, the technician encourages him to visit the observatory&#x27;s nearby visitor centre and take the tour, as the dish has seen some amazing times. The old man thoughtfully agrees.

The movie flashes back to July, 1969, days before the launch of Apollo 11. NASA anticipates using the dish as a primary receiving antenna for the video transmission of Neil Armstrong&#x27;s historic first steps on the Moon. The dish’s staff, Mitch, Glenn, and their boss, Cliff (the old man from the prologue) have been assigned a liaison by NASA, Al Burnett. Mitch resents Al, as he feels that Al is condescending; and that his presence likewise reflects a wider perception among NASA that the Australians are incompetent and unreliable. Cliff chastises Mitch for his hostility, explaining that Al&#x27;s presence is justified, and that he and NASA merely want to ensure that the Moon landing proceeds as smoothly as possible.

The major role that the dish is set to play in the Moon landing draws great interest upon the sleepy town of Parkes from major dignitaries, including the U.S. Ambassador and the Prime Minister. Parkes mayor, Bob, is delighted, as he played a key role in securing the dish&#x27;s construction at Parkes, and thus the dish&#x27;s prominent role in the Moon landing will be a boon to his political career.

A power cut strikes Parkes. The dish’s backup generator fails, as Mitch had previously conducted a maintenance procedure on it incorrectly. When the mains power returns, the station&#x27;s tracking computers have been wiped of all their programming, and the dish can no longer locate Command Module &quot;Columbia&quot;″s signal in space. Houston notices that they are no longer receiving any information from the Parkes station and queries them about the problem. Fearing that NASA may demote the team’s role in the Moon landing if it learns of the mistake, Cliff falsely responds that the dish is receiving a clear signal from the spacecraft. Al reluctantly corroborates the lie. Mitch confesses his own culpability to Al, who immediately forgives him, mending their strained relationship. The four men work together to try to relocate Apollo 11’s signal. After several hours and mishaps, they are able to lock on to the spacecraft&#x27;s signal with minutes to spare before their scheduled shift as Apollo 11&#x27;s main receiver begins, thus ensuring their mistake has gone undiscovered.

After the Lunar Module &quot;Eagle&quot; makes a successful landing upon the Moon, Cliff notes with concern that the wind seems unusually strong. Regulations state that if the wind reaches 30 knots, the dish must be &quot;stowed&quot;, meaning it can not be pointed at the Moon, and thus will not be able to receive &quot;Eagle&quot;″s video broadcasts. Events conspire such that the Parkes dish becomes the only antenna on Earth capable of receiving the historic video footage of Armstrong&#x27;s first steps upon the Moon.

The wind reaches and exceeds 30 knots. Despite risking the total collapse of the dish, and therefore, their own lives, all four members of the dish team opt to keep the dish pointed at the Moon, adamant that allowing the world to witness and record the first moonwalk is worth the risk.

The world watches in silent awe as man sets foot upon the Moon. As the Prime Minister, the ambassador, and Parkes dignitaries watch the moonwalk together, Bob is informed that the video feed is coming from the dish. Everybody is delighted, and the Prime Minister toasts Parkes. As the moonwalk concludes, the dish staff congratulate one another.

Back in the present day, the technician once again insists that Cliff must leave. Cliff solemnly takes one last look at the dish before returning to his car. Before he leaves, the technician remarks that Cliff seems familiar, suggesting that Cliff&#x27;s legacy is immortalized within the observatory&#x27;s visitor centre.

A title card explains that the dish withstood winds of over 60 mph (52 knots) to deliver the video footage of man walking on the Moon.

==Cast==
==Production==

Much of the film was shot on location; the &quot;cricket match&quot; and &quot;hayride&quot; scenes were shot on the real dish and researchers often postponed experiments to position the dish for photography. The set reconstructing the 1969 control room was extremely accurate, down to some details as small as ashtrays. Some of the &quot;props&quot; were in fact original NASA equipment used during the Apollo 11 landing, left behind in Australia as they were too heavy (i.e. too expensive) to ship back to the U.S. Staff from that era expressed amazement at seeing the set; they said it was like stepping through a time warp.

&quot;The Dish&quot; was written by Santo Cilauro, Tom Gleisner, Jane Kennedy and Rob Sitch, and directed by Sitch.

Apart from the radio telescope scenes, the majority of the movie was actually filmed in the small town of Forbes, south of Parkes because of its old historic buildings, and also in Old Parliament House in Canberra, and Crawford Studios in Melbourne.

==Historical accuracy==

Although the film is based on actual events, it uses fictional characters and alters historical details for dramatic effect. NASA&#x27;s Honeysuckle Creek near Canberra and the Goldstone station in California both had the signal first, but Parkes&#x27;s signal was used eight and a half minutes after the beginning of the moonwalk. Armstrong&#x27;s first step on the Moon and his words, &quot;That&#x27;s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind&quot;, were received on Earth by the Honeysuckle Creek antenna. No power failure occurred, there was no friction with the NASA representatives (of whom there were not just one but several), and Prime Minister John Gorton visited Honeysuckle Creek, not Parkes. They did, however, operate in very high winds gusting to (59 knots) at 60 degrees inclination, risking damage to the dish and even injury to themselves to keep the antenna pointed at the Moon during the moonwalk. Also the Moon was not full in the preceding two weeks prior the Moon landing, while in the movie they used a full moon to retrieve the signal.

==Box office==
&quot;The Dish&quot; had three days of paid previews prior to its official opening in Australia on 19 October 2000. During its official opening (four-day) weekend, it had a record opening weekend for an Australian film with gross of $2.98 million from 281 screens. Including the previews, its gross was $4.3 million (US$2.25 million). It went on to gross $17,999,473 at the box office in Australia, and was the top grossing Australian film in Australia in 2000.

==Reception==
On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 96% approval rating based on 99 reviews, with an average rating of 7.4/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;A feel good movie without an abundance of mush.&quot;

<doc id="379852" wikidata="Q4917487" url="?curid=379852" title="Bishop Asbury Cottage">
<text>Bishop Asbury Cottage () is a 17th-century cottage on Newton Road, Great Barr, England, known for being the boyhood home of Francis Asbury (1745 – 1816), one of the first two bishops of the Methodist Episcopal Church (now The United Methodist Church) in the United States. It is now a museum in his memory.

== Architecture ==
The single-storey cottage, then in Staffordshire, was built from brick. It has an attic with dormer windows, tiled roof and rendered plinth.

== The Asburys ==
Asbury was born in nearby Hamstead in 1745 and the family moved to the cottage the next year. Asbury worshipped as a Methodist at nearby Wednesbury. He had an apprenticeship as a blacksmith before becoming a full-time preacher, at the age of 21.

He left for America in 1771, never to return. His family remained at the cottage until the death of his mother Eliza in 1802. During that time, the cottage was used for religious worship. These services continued after the death of Asbury&#x27;s parents and eventually the cause moved to &quot;The Institute&quot; across the road, which eventually became the Newton Road United Reformed Church which continued until 2017.

== Later history ==
By the 1950s, the cottage was owned by a brewery, but had no running water and only a cesspit toilet. It was occupied by a Mrs Randles and her daughter Mrs Searle, who often showed visiting American Methodists around the building. The brewery applied for permission to demolish it, but this was refused at the behest of local councillor Mrs Parfitt, a Methodist, once its history became apparent. In around 1955, the cottage was purchased by the local council, who then rehoused the occupants.

The building was part of a terraced pair, but in 1964 the adjacent, southern, cottage was demolished when Newton Road (designated the A4041) was widened. Local legend has it that it was the demolished cottage which was the Asburys&#x27;, but documentary evidence in Sandwell Museum disproves this.

A Grade II listed building since September 1955, the cottage is now operated as a museum, furnished in period style, with memorabilia and information relating to Asbury&#x27;s life in West Bromwich and Great Barr in England and later in the United States. It also has displays about the rise of Methodism in the surrounding Black Country, and John Wesley&#x27;s life and times, and visits to the local area.

<text>Gerrard Winstanley (baptised 19 October 1609 – 10 September 1676) was an English Protestant religious reformer, political philosopher, and activist during the period of the Commonwealth of England. Winstanley was the leader and one of the founders of the English group known as the True Levellers or Diggers. The group occupied formerly common land that had been privatised by enclosures and dug them over, pulling down hedges and filling in ditches, to plant crops. &quot;True Levellers&quot; was the name they used to describe themselves, whereas the term &quot;Diggers&quot; was coined by contemporaries.

==Early life==
Gerrard Winstanley was baptised on 19 October 1609, the son of Edward Winstanley, mercer, and was baptised in the parish of Wigan, then part of the West Derby hundred of Lancashire. His mother&#x27;s identity remains unknown and he could have been born anywhere in the parish of Wigan. The parish of Wigan contained the townships of Abram, Aspull, Billinge-and-Winstanley, Dalton, Haigh, Hindley, Ince-in-Makerfield, Orrell, Pemberton, and Upholland, as well as Wigan itself.

In 1630, Winstanley migrated to the City of London, where he became an apprentice to a Merchant Tailor. In 1638, he was admitted as a freeman of the Merchant Tailors&#x27; Company, a trade guild. In 1639, he married Susan King, the daughter of William King, a London surgeon.

The First English Civil War disrupted Winstanley’s business, and in 1643 he was made bankrupt. His father-in-law helped him to move to Cobham, Surrey, where he initially worked as a cowherd.

==&quot;The New Law of Righteousness&quot;==
Winstanley published a pamphlet called &quot;The New Law of Righteousness&quot;. The basis of this work came from the downtrodden state of the labouring population of England under the encroachment of private property by means of the Enclosures of common land; the remedy it espouses is the communal life, as exposed in the Book of Acts, chapter two, verses 44 and 45: &quot;And all that believed were together, and had all things common; And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need.&quot; Winstanley argued that 
Winstanley took as his basic texts the Biblical sacred history, with its affirmation that all men were descended from a common stock, and with its scepticism about the rulership of kings, voiced in the Books of Samuel; and the New Testament&#x27;s affirmations that God was no respecter of persons, that there were no masters or slaves under the New Covenant. From these and similar texts, he interpreted Christian teaching as calling for the abolition of property [in land] and aristocracy. For him, nature &quot;is in effect God, and this pantheistic materialism proclaimed the equality of all people through nature as well as the usefulness of popular sciences -alchemy, astrology, herbal medicine and the magical arts.&quot;

Winstanley wrote: &quot;Seeing the common people of England by joynt consent of person and purse have caste out Charles our Norman oppressour, wee have by this victory recovered ourselves from under his Norman yoake.&quot;

His theme was rooted in ancient English radical thought. It went back at least to the days of the Peasants&#x27; Revolt (1381) led by Wat Tyler, because that is when a verse of the Lollard priest John Ball was circulated:
:When Adam delved and Eve span,
:Who was then the gentleman?

==The Diggers==

On 1 April 1649, Winstanley and his followers took over vacant or common lands on St George&#x27;s Hill in Surrey. Other Digger colonies followed in Buckinghamshire, Kent, and Northamptonshire. Their action was to cultivate the land and distribute food without charge to any who would join them in the work. Local landowners took fright from the Diggers&#x27; activities and in 1650 sent hired armed men to beat the Diggers and destroy their colony. Winstanley protested to the government, but to no avail, and eventually the colony was abandoned.

After the failure of the Digger experiment in Surrey in 1650 Winstanley temporarily fled to Pirton, Hertfordshire, where he took up employment as an estate steward for the aristocratic mystic Lady Eleanor Davies. This employment lasted less than a year. It ended when Davies accused Winstanley of mismanaging her property, and he then returned to Cobham.

Winstanley continued to advocate the redistribution of land. In 1652 he published another pamphlet called &quot;The Law of Freedom in a Platform&quot;, in which he argued that the Christian basis for society is where property and wages are abolished. In keeping with Winstanley&#x27;s adherence to biblical models, the tract envisages a communistic society structured on non-hierarchical lines, though one likely to have voluntary patriarchs.

==Quakers==
By 1654 Winstanley was possibly assisting Edward Burrough, an early leader of the Quakers, later called the Society of Friends. It seems that Winstanley remained a Quaker for the rest of his life, since his death was noted in Quaker records. However, his Quakerism may not have been very strong as he was involved in the government of his local parish church from 1659 onwards though it is not unknown for committed Quakers to retain strong ties to other religious traditions, even including priesthood. He may have been buried in a Quaker cemetery.

Winstanley believed in Christian Universalism, the doctrine that everyone, however sinful, will eventually be reconciled to God; he wrote that &quot;in the end every man shall be saved, though some at the last hour.&quot; His book &quot;The Mysterie of God&quot; is apparently the first theological work in the English language to state this universalism.

==Later life==
In 1657 Winstanley and his wife Susan received a gift of property in Ham Manor in Cobham, from his father-in-law William King. This marked Winstanley&#x27;s renovation in social status locally and he became waywarden of the parish in 1659, overseer of the poor in 1660 and churchwarden of the Church of England parish church in 1667–68. He was elected Chief Constable of Elmbridge, Surrey, in October 1671. These offices on the face of it conflicted with Winstanley&#x27;s apparent Quakerism, a religion which later became more quietist.

When Susan died in about 1664, Winstanley sold the land in Cobham to King for £50. Winstanley returned to London to trade, whilst retaining some connections in Surrey. In about 1665 he married his second wife, Elizabeth Stanley, and re-entered commerce as a corn chandler. Winstanley died in 1676, aged 66, vexed by legal disputes concerning a small legacy owed to him in a will.

==Legacy==
The Soviet-era Alexander Garden Obelisk in Moscow, Russia, in 1918 included his name among a list of outstanding thinkers and personalities of the struggle for the liberation of workers.

In 1999, the British activist group The Land is Ours celebrated the Digger movement&#x27;s 350th anniversary with a march and reoccupation of St George&#x27;s Hill, the site of the first Digger colony. Like the original colony, this settlement was quickly disbanded.
Since 2010 a Wigan Diggers’ Festival has been held annually in Winstanley&#x27;s birth town of Wigan attracting support across the North of England.

===Collected works===
&quot;The Complete Works of Gerrard Winstanley&quot;, edited jointly by Thomas N. Corns, Ann Hughes and David Loewenstein, were published by the Oxford University Press in December 2009 at £229 ().

A shorter and less comprehensive volume containing all the major works, &quot;Gerrard Winstanley: A Common Treasury&quot; edited by Andrew Hopton, was published in 1989 by Aporia () and reprinted several times since, most recently in 2011 (paperback) by Verso Books (UK) with an introduction by Tony Benn ().

===Related works===
1975 saw the release of Kevin Brownlow and Andrew Mollo&#x27;s film &quot;Winstanley&quot;. As with the duo&#x27;s previous film, &quot;It Happened Here&quot;, it had taken several years to produce with a very low budget. &quot;Winstanley&quot; was loosely based on a 1961 novel by David Caute entitled &quot;Comrade Jacob&quot; and was produced in a quasi-documentary style, with great attention to period detail – even to the point of only using breeds of animals which were known to exist at the time, and actual Civil War armour and weapons borrowed from the Tower of London museum.

In 2009 UKA Press released &quot;Winstanley: Warts and all&quot; (), the story of the making of the film &quot;Winstanley&quot;, written by film director and film historian Kevin Brownlow.

The song, &quot;The World Turned Upside Down&quot;, by English folksinger Leon Rosselson, weaves many of Winstanley&#x27;s own words into the lyrics. An older song, the &quot;Diggers&#x27; Song&quot;, said to have been written by Winstanley, was recorded by the English group Chumbawamba on their &quot;English Rebel Songs 1381–1914&quot; in 1988.

==Quotations==
From &quot;A Declaration from the Poor Oppressed People of England&quot;: The power of enclosing land and owning property was brought into the creation by your ancestors by the sword; which first did murder their fellow creatures, men, and after plunder or steal away their land, and left this land successively to you, their children. And therefore, though you did not kill or thieve, yet you hold that cursed thing in your hand by the power of the sword; and so you justify the wicked deeds of your fathers, and that sin of your fathers shall be visited upon the head of you and your children to the third and fourth generation, and longer too, till your bloody and thieving power be rooted out of the land. From &quot;A Watch-word to the City of London, and Army&quot;: Alas! you poor blind earth-moles, you strive to take away my livelihood and the liberty of this poor weak frame my body of flesh, which is my house I dwell in for a time; but I strive to cast down your kingdom of darkness, and to open hell gates, and to break the devil&#x27;s bonds asunder wherewith you are tied, and that you my enemies may live in peace; and that is all the harm I would have you to have. From &quot;A New-year&#x27;s Gift for the Parliament and Army&quot;: The life of this dark kingly power, which you have made an act of Parliament and oath to cast out, if you search it to the bottom, you shall see it lies within the iron chest of cursed covetousness, who gives the earth to some part of mankind and denies it to another part of mankind: and that part that hath the earth, hath no right from the law of creation to take it to himself and shut out others; but he took it away violently by theft and murder in conquest. From &quot;The Law of Freedom in a Platform&quot;: If they prove desperate, wanton or idle, and will not quietly submit to the law, the task-master is to feed them with short diet, and to whip them, for a rod is prepared for the fool&#x27;s back, till such time as their proud hearts do bend to the law ... If any have so highly broke the laws as they come within the compass of whipping, imprisoning and death, the executioner shall cut off the head, hang or shoot to death, or whip the offender according to the sentence of law. Thus you may see what the work of every officer in a town or city is.&quot;

<doc id="379856" wikidata="Q553349" url="?curid=379856" title="Kent Conrad">
<text>Kent Conrad (born March 12, 1948) is a former American politician who was a United States Senator from North Dakota. He is a member of the Democratic Party. First elected to the Senate in 1986, he served as chairman or Ranking Member of the Senate Budget Committee for 12 years.

On January 18, 2011, Conrad announced that he was retiring from politics and would not run for reelection in 2012. He said in a statement that it was more important that &quot;I spend my time and energy trying to focus on solving the nation&#x27;s budget woes than be distracted by another campaign.&quot; Fellow Democrat Heidi Heitkamp was elected to replace him.

Conrad currently co-chairs the Bipartisan Policy Center&#x27;s Commission on Retirement Security and Personal Savings. He is also a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One. In addition, he serves on the board of directors of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

==Early life==
Conrad was born in Bismarck, North Dakota, the son of Abigail and Gaylord E. Conrad. He was orphaned at a young age and subsequently raised by his grandparents in Bismarck. He attended Roosevelt Elementary, Hughes Junior High, and Wheelus Air Base high school in Tripoli, Libya, before eventually graduating from Phillips Exeter Academy. He then went to college at Stanford, and received an M.B.A. from The George Washington University.

== Personal life ==
Conrad has been married twice. His first wife, Pam, is the sister of former U.S. Secretary of Agriculture and former North Dakota Governor Ed Schafer; they have a daughter, Jessamyn. Jessamyn Conrad is the author of &quot;What You Should Know About Politics ... But Don&#x27;t&quot;, subtitled &quot;a Nonpartisan Guide&quot;, which was praised by Barack Obama and Bob Dole.

On February 14, 1987, Conrad married Lucy Calautti, his 1986 Senate campaign manager, who is now a lobbyist for Major League Baseball.

==Early political career==
After graduating from college, Conrad became a civil servant, working as an assistant to the North Dakota State Tax Commissioner, Byron Dorgan, who later became his colleague in the Senate. Conrad made his first entry into politics when he ran unsuccessfully for the North Dakota Auditor&#x27;s office in 1976. In 1980 Conrad succeeded Dorgan as Tax Commissioner. Conrad was state tax commissioner until 1986, when he ran for the Senate.

==U.S. Senate career==

===Committee assignments===
*Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry
**Subcommittee on Energy, Science and Technology
**Subcommittee on Domestic and Foreign Marketing, Inspection, and Plant and Animal Health
**Subcommittee on Production, Income Protection and Price Support
*Committee on the Budget (chairman)
*Committee on Finance
**Subcommittee on Energy, Natural Resources, and Infrastructure
**Subcommittee on Taxation, IRS Oversight, and Long-Term Growth (chairman)
**Subcommittee on Fiscal Responsibility and Economic Growth
*Committee on Indian Affairs
*Joint Committee on Taxation

===Political positions===

In April 2006 &quot;Time&quot; named Conrad one of &quot;America&#x27;s 10 Best Senators&quot;. That same year &quot;The American&quot; commended him for his knowledge of economic issues. Conrad endorsed Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary.

Conrad was a leading member of the &quot;Gang of 10&quot;, a conservative group that pushed for much greater offshore drilling in sensitive environmental areas. He was well known for using charts as visual aids when speaking in the Senate, which earned him the nickname &quot;Godfather of Charts.&quot;

====Health care====
In the 2009 negotiations over reforming America&#x27;s healthcare system, Conrad strongly opposed a &quot;public option.&quot; The AFL-CIO announced it would fund a primary challenge to Conrad in 2012 if he continued to oppose a public option.

On September 29, 2009, Conrad voted with Senate Finance Committee Republicans against an amendment to a health care bill that would have provided for a public option. He was supportive of the Stupak-Pitts Amendment, which places limits on taxpayer-funded abortions in the context of the November 2009 Affordable Health Care for America Act.

====Social policies====
Conrad is more politically conservative than most Democrats. He voted consistently in favor of banning the partial-birth abortion medical procedure. He also opposes public funding of abortion, but voted in favor of lifting the ban on abortions on military bases. Conrad has a mixed record on gay rights. While he personally opposes gay marriage, he voted against a proposed constitutional ban on it and has supported bills that prevent discrimination based on sexual orientation. On January 31, 2006, Conrad was one of four Democrats to vote in favor of confirming Judge Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court.

====Fiscal policies====
On April 17, 2012, Conrad, a strong supporter of the Simpson-Bowles plan, announced his plan to offer a version of it that he, as a member of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, helped to develop. Lawmakers on the Senate Budget Committee could be forced to vote or modify the plan.

Conrad was known for his deep understanding of monetary policies and budget issues. He identifies as a &quot;deficit hawk&quot;, supporting a balanced federal budget, but continues to support farm subsidies. He voted against Republican proposals to repeal the estate and alternative minimum taxes. He supported lower middle-class taxes, but increased taxes for people making more than $1 million per year. In 2010 he supported extending the expiring Bush tax cuts &quot;at least until the economy is clearly recovering.&quot;

Conrad was very vocal in his opposition to the spending policies of the George W. Bush administration. He contended that Bush worsened the national debt. Conrad also opposed most free-trade measures and strongly supported subsidies to family farmers.

====Foreign policy and national security====
In 1991 Conrad voted against approving the use of military force in Iraq. He was one of only 23 senators to vote against the war resolution of 2002. While he initially voted in favor of the USA PATRIOT Act, he has opposed warrantless wiretapping and government&#x27;s continued use of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility.

===Countrywide Financial loan scandal===

In June 2008 it was reported that Conrad had received mortgages on favorable terms for a second home and an apartment building due to his association with Countrywide Financial CEO Angelo R. Mozilo. Conrad acknowledged that he had spoken with Mozilo by phone. In an April 23, 2004, email about one of Conrad&#x27;s loans, Mozilo encouraged an employee to &quot;make an exception due to the fact that the borrower is a senator.&quot; Conrad denied any prior knowledge of such treatment and gave the mortgage discount to charity. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) called on the Senate Ethics Committee to investigate Conrad. In August 2009, after a yearlong inquiry, the Ethics Committee exonerated Conrad of any unethical behavior in his dealings with Countrywide.

==Electoral history==

===Overview===
In the 1986 election, Conrad defeated the Republican incumbent, Mark Andrews, by 2,120 votes. Andrews had represented North Dakota at the federal level since 1963 (he had previously served in the House before moving to the Senate in 1981).

During the campaign, Conrad pledged that he would not run for reelection if the federal budget deficit had not fallen substantially by the end of his term. By 1992 it became obvious that this would not be the case, and although polls showed that the electorate would have welcomed his reneging on that pledge, Conrad considered his promise binding and did not run for reelection. Byron Dorgan won the Democratic primary election.

Conrad received an opportunity to remain in the Senate when North Dakota&#x27;s other senator, long-serving Dem-NPLer Quentin Burdick, died on September 8, 1992. Burdick&#x27;s widow, Jocelyn Birch Burdick, was appointed to the seat temporarily, but a special election was needed to fill the rest of the term. Viewing this opportunity as different from running for reelection, Conrad ran for and won the Democratic-NPL&#x27;s nomination. He went on to win the special election, and was sworn in on December 14, 1992, resigning his original Senate seat the same day. (Conrad&#x27;s original Senate seat was then filled by Dorgan, via appointment by the governor on December 15, 1992, to fill the seat for the brief period until he would have been sworn in under normal circumstances.)

Despite North Dakota&#x27;s Republican leanings, Conrad was comfortably reelected in 1994—a year when Republicans won most of the Congressional seats that were not in heavily Democratic-leaning states.

<text>The lyrics to &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;O Canada! my country, my love&quot; is a French-Canadian patriotic song. It was written by George-Étienne Cartier and first sung in 1834, during a patriotic banquet of the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society held in Montreal. The words were first published in the June 29, 1835 edition of . It was later published in (Quebec 1850), this time with music, but with only four of the original six verses. It was reproduced in on June 21, 1913. The song was recorded on 78 rpm discs by both Victor Occellier and Joseph Saucier around the turn of the century and in 1925 or 1926 by Rodolphe Plamondon Roger Doucet included it in his LP (Songs of Glory) in 1976.

The music currently used was composed by Jean-Baptiste Labelle. It is uncertain when the lyrics and music were put together, probably by Ernest Gagnon sometime between 1850 and 1868.

==Excerpt==
&lt;poem&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;

==English translation==
&lt;poem&gt;As the old proverb says:
Nothing is more beautiful than one&#x27;s country;
And to sing it is the tradition;
And mine I sing to my friends
The stranger looks with an envious eye
Of the St. Lawrence the majestic course;
At its aspect the Canadian sings:
O Canada! my country! my love!
&lt;/poem&gt;

<doc id="379860" wikidata="Q52920" url="?curid=379860" title="Fredrik Reinfeldt">
<text>John Fredrik Reinfeldt (pronounced ; born 4 August 1965) is a Swedish economist, lecturer, former Prime Minister of Sweden from 2006 to 2014 and chairman of the liberal conservative Moderate Party from 2003 to 2015. He was the last rotating President of the European Council in 2009. He has been the chairman of the Swedish Football Association since 25 March 2023.

A native of Stockholm County, Reinfeldt joined the Moderate Youth League in 1983. By 1992 he rose to the rank of chairman, a position he held until 1995. He served as Member of Parliament from 1991 to 2014, representing his home constituency. Reinfeldt was elected party leader on 25 October 2003, succeeding Bo Lundgren. Under his leadership, the Moderate Party has transformed its policies and oriented itself closer to the political centre, branding itself &quot;The New Moderates&quot; (). In 2010, under Reinfeldt&#x27;s leadership, the Moderate Party got its highest share of the vote since the introduction of universal suffrage in 1921.

Following the 2006 general election, Reinfeldt was elected Prime Minister on 6 October. Along with the three other centre-right political parties in the Alliance for Sweden, Reinfeldt presided over a coalition government with the support of a narrow majority in parliament. At the age of 41, he was the third-youngest person to become Prime Minister of Sweden.

Reinfeldt&#x27;s first term in office included the 2007–2008 financial crisis and the Great Recession. His popularity fell until the economy of Sweden emerged as one of the strongest in the European Union; this brought a resurgence of support for him, resulting in his government&#x27;s re-election in 2010. Reinfeldt&#x27;s second government was reduced to a minority government, owing to the rise of Sweden Democrats; he remained in power as the first centre-right Prime Minister since the Swedish-Norwegian Union to be re-elected..

His premiership was characterised by &quot;Arbetslinjen&quot; &quot;(English: Working line)&quot;, a focus on getting more people into the workforce, and by management of the 2007–2008 financial crisis and the Great Recession, which resulted in one of the world&#x27;s strongest public finances and top rankings in climate and health care.

He is the longest-serving non-Social Democratic Prime Minister since Erik Gustaf Boström&#x27;s first spell in office between 1891 and 1900. After his defeat in the 2014 election Reinfeldt announced that he would step down from leading the party, which he did on 10 January 2015.

== Early life and education ==
John Fredrik Reinfeldt was born in 1965 in Allmänna BB hospital in Stockholm, the eldest of three brothers to his parents Bruno (1938–2016) and Birgitta Reinfeldt. At the time of his birth his parents lived in an apartment in Österhaninge, in the south of Stockholm County, but a short time afterwards the family moved to London, where his father worked as a consultant for Shell. Upon returning to Sweden, the family first lived in an apartment in Handen before moving to a terraced house in Bromsten in northwestern Stockholm. The Reinfeldt family was living in Bromsten when Fredrik&#x27;s younger brothers, Magnus and Henrik, were born in 1969 and 1973. In 1976, the family moved into a single-family home in Täby in northeastern Stockholm County. His mother Birgitta was a leadership and management consultant, and some of her professional skills might have inspired and impressed the young Fredrik.

At the age of 11, Reinfeldt became chairman of the student council () in his school, and became a fan of the football club Djurgårdens IF, a passion he maintains to this day. He started playing basketball for the &quot;Tensta Tigers&quot; while living in Bromsten (which is located adjacent to Tensta), and continued to play for them after his family moved to Täby. At his secondary school, Åva gymnasium, he studied natural science for three years. He also enjoyed setting up and performing revues and cabarets. After school, Reinfeldt completed his military service as a ranger () at Lapland Ranger Regiment and finished first in his class as a cadet in Umeå. It was during this time that he became interested in politics, as a representative for his regiment in the congress of conscripts in the Swedish military (). He graduated from Stockholm University School of Business with a degree in Business and Economics () in 1990.

== Political career ==
Reinfeldt joined the Moderate Youth League—the youth wing of the Swedish Moderate Party—in 1983 at the age of 18. As a member of the Moderate Youth League in Täby, he challenged the leaders of the local league, who preferred to use the premises as a place to drink beer and wine rather than engage in discussions about politics. Reinfeldt, who is said to dislike hard liquor and to consume wine and beer in moderate amounts, started &quot;Conservative Youth&quot; () and formed a bond with the mother party, eventually taking over the youth league in 1987. In 1988 he became a secretary () in the Stockholm Municipality Council.

He was active in student politics while studying at Stockholm University, eventually becoming chairman of the student party &quot;&quot; between 1988 and 1989. He became chairman of the Moderate Youth League&#x27;s Stockholm branch in 1990, and the following year was elected a member of the Riksdag (the Swedish Parliament). In the Swedish general election of 1991 the Moderate Party and its allies had considerable success, leading to the formation of a centre-right coalition government under Moderate Party leader and Prime Minister Carl Bildt. The 1991 government was the first centre-right government in Sweden since 1982.

=== Leader of the Moderate Youth League ===
From 1992 to 1995 Reinfeldt was the chairman of the Moderate Youth League. He ousted the former chairman Ulf Kristersson at the controversial congress known as the Battle of Lycksele, securing 58 of the delegates&#x27; votes while Kristersson received only 55. The congress was controversial because it was the culmination of a long ideological battle within the Moderate Youth League between the conservatives and the libertarians; Reinfeldt represented the conservatives and Kristersson the libertarians. Reinfeldt later stated that although the effects of that deep ideological division and battle in the party lingered on within the Moderate Youth League, he also felt that it was a defining moment in his life. Had he lost the battle he would most likely not be in politics today. In 1993 Reinfeldt wrote the book The Sleeping People (), where he criticized the Swedish welfare state and argues for a liberal societal system. With phrases such as: &quot;We don&#x27;t want to see a society where people starve, but other than that no standard rights should be financed by taxes.&quot; The book later haunted Reinfeldt, when he faced criticism for phrases such as &quot;The Swedes are mentally handicapped and indoctrinated to believe that politicians can create and guarantee welfare.&quot;

From 1995 to 1997 he was chairman of the Democrat Youth Community of Europe.

Following the defeat of the Bildt government in the general election of 1994 he publicly criticized the Moderate Party leader Bildt, who he believed had become too dominant in the party.

In 1995 Reinfeldt co-authored the book (&#x27;The Nostalgic Trip&#x27;), which described several persons in the Moderate Party leadership, including Gunnar Hökmark and Bo Lundgren, as &quot;Carl Bildt-lookalikes.&quot; Bildt was described as being the perfect leader for the opposition to satirize; a nobleman living in the affluent Östermalm with a boyish expression and a better-than-you attitude. As for the other high party officials, the book stated that &quot;If everyone appears similar to Carl it confirms peoples misconceptions about the Moderate Party. It becomes a party for Carl Bildt-copies.&quot;

This provoked swift reaction from the Moderate Party leadership, who believed that Reinfeldt&#x27;s criticisms had gone too far. On 14 February 1995 Reinfeldt was called to a meeting of the Moderate Party&#x27;s Riksdag group, which took place in the former second chamber () of the Swedish parliament building, a meeting where Bildt apparently scolded him for hours. After this, Reinfeldt toned down his criticism, but was ostracized within the Moderate Party and not given any important posts until after the change of leadership when Lundgren succeeded Bildt in 1999. At that time he was elected into a high party group, the &quot;förtroenderåd&quot;. From 2001 to 2002 Reinfeldt was chairman of the justice committee of the Riksdag. During this time he traveled around the country gathering impressions and support at the local level of the Moderate Party.

=== Leader of the Moderate Party ===
In the general election of 2002 the Moderate Party received 15.3 percent of the votes—its lowest share of the vote in a general election since 1973. Following the loss, Lundgren was forced to resign his position as leader of the Moderate Party. After the 2002 election Reinfeldt was elected as leader of the Moderate Party parliamentary group, spokesman for economic policy and vice chairman of the parliament&#x27;s finance committee. On 25 October 2003 he was unanimously elected as the new leader of the Moderate Party.

==== &quot;The New Moderates&quot; ====
Under Reinfeldt&#x27;s leadership, the Moderate Party adjusted its position in the political spectrum, moving towards the centre. To reflect these changes, the party&#x27;s unofficial name was altered to &quot;The New Moderates&quot; () in order to emphasize the break with the past. The Moderate Party started to focus more on calls for tax cuts for low- and middle-income groups, rather than on major tax cuts that would more benefit high-income earners.

As leader of the Moderate Party, Reinfeldt tended to be less forceful in his criticism of the Swedish welfare state than his predecessors. He instead proposed reforms to Sweden&#x27;s welfare state, which included cutting taxes for the lowest income earners and reducing unemployment benefits, in order to encourage the jobless to return to work. He toned down calls within the party for dismantling large portions of the Swedish welfare state, stating that change must come gradually from the bottom up and not be dictated from the top down. His goal was said to be to fine-tune the welfare state, by focusing on getting people off welfare benefits and into employment. He worked to shift the conservatives toward the middle ground by convincing voters that he would fix rather than dismantle the public welfare system.

Reinfeldt even extended an invitation to the Swedish Trade Union Confederation, traditional supporter of the Social Democrats and opponent of the Moderate Party. He also changed the Moderate Party&#x27;s traditional stance towards the Swedish Labour and employment laws, stating that he prefers small changes instead of any radical reform.

People both within and outside the party differ on their analysis of Reinfeldt&#x27;s transformation of the Moderate Party, with some arguing that the party was mainly honing the way it describes its visions, and others suggesting that it constituted a substantial policy change towards the centre. As a consequence of Reinfeldt&#x27;s shift of the Moderate Party to the centre, the differences between the Moderate Party and their traditional opponents the Social Democratic Party have become harder to discern. In a series of radio and television debates, the then-Social Democrat leader and Prime Minister Göran Persson portrayed his opponent as a classic conservative in disguise. Persson stated that, if put into power, the conservatives would tamper with Sweden&#x27;s successful formula of high taxes, a large public sector and generous benefits. There was also some criticism within the party; former Moderate Youth League chairman Christofer Fjellner called Reinfeldt&#x27;s political reform &quot;leftist rhetoric&quot; ().

==== Alliance for Sweden ====
In the run-up to the general election of 2006, Reinfeldt, as leader of the Moderate Party, participated in the creation of the Alliance for Sweden. It united the centre-right in a coalition of the Moderate Party, the Centre Party, the Liberal People&#x27;s Party and the Christian Democrats. Reinfeldt is said to have been instrumental in uniting the four parties, which previously were known for being notoriously divided, in order to present a powerful alternative to the Social Democrats. The parties presented a joint election manifesto for the alliance.

==== 2006 Swedish general election ====

During the run-up to the 2006 general election, Reinfeldt was subjected to a smear campaign. Mats Lindström, a staff member in the Social Democratic Party headquarters, admitted to sending e-mails accusing Reinfeldt of tax fraud, false financial declarations and only attaining his position because of his father&#x27;s influence. The IP address used in the e-mails was traced to the Social Democratic Party headquarters. Social Democratic Party Secretary Marita Ulvskog apologized and said that such behavior was completely unacceptable. A short time after the e-mail campaign, images that depicted Reinfeldt and the Moderate Party in an unflattering light were spread internally within the Social Democratic Party and subsequently leaked to the media. Social Democratic Party spokeswoman Carina Persson confirmed that the material came from the Social Democratic Youth League, but denied the existence of an official smear campaign and stated that the material was not meant to be released or spread to a wider audience.

At the general election on 17 September 2006 the Alliance for Sweden won a majority of the votes after the first count, defeating the Social Democratic Party. The Moderates received 26.1 percent of the votes, a new record for the party and over 10 percentage points higher than in 2002. The election result was also historic in being the worst result for the Social Democrats ever (34.6 percent) in a general election under universal suffrage (introduced in 1921).

Looking back at the defeat of the incumbent Social Democrats, the opinion among several members of the defeated incumbents was that the election was lost because the previous government failed to bring down unemployment, and failed to campaign on it as an issue. Ardalan Shekarabi, the former chairman for the Swedish Social Democratic Youth League, stated that &quot;the Moderates were right strategically to focus on unemployment&quot;. Former Social Democratic minister Leif Pagrotsky stated that internal fighting, authoritarianism and perceived aggressiveness as well as a loss of appeal to the middle class and city inhabitants contributed to the election loss.

==== 2010 Swedish general election ====

In the 2010 general election held on 19 September 2010 the Alliance for Sweden were reduced to a minority government, but also becoming the first centre-right government to be re-elected since before World War II. The Moderate Party received 30.06 percent of the votes, which was the highest election result in over one hundred years.

The Alliance for Sweden received a plurality of votes, but not full majority in Parliament. But because of the fragmented opposition, after the entrance of the Sweden Democrats in parliament, the government could continue.

== Prime Minister (2006–2014) ==
Reinfeldt became the Prime Minister of Sweden on 6 October 2006 when he was confirmed by king Carl XVI Gustaf having been approved by the Riksdag the previous day, serving concurrently as Leader of the Moderate Party. The 41-year old Reinfeldt became the youngest person to become Prime Minister since Rickard Sandler became Prime Minister at the age of 40 in 1925. With victories in 2006 and in 2010, Reinfeldt was the Moderate Party&#x27;s longest-serving prime minister and the only person to lead the party to two consecutive general election victories. His Government compromised four parties (including his own) which prior to the election had formed a coalition named Alliance for Sweden, later turned into the Alliance.

At a press conference prior to his appointment, Reinfeldt commented that &quot;this feels historic in many ways&quot; partly because it was the first time in 36 years there would be a majority government in Sweden.

===First term (2006–2010)===
====2007–2008 financial crisis and the Great Recession====
The 2007–2008 financial crisis and the Great Recession had a major impact on the Economy of Sweden. Reinfeldt&#x27;s Government emphasized that a balanced budget was a priority, combined with income tax cuts to stimulate domestic production and commerce. The Cabinet received criticism for holding to hard in the public finances, with limited investments, and the support of Reinfeldt&#x27;s policies dropped to one of the lowest ever seen for an incumbent Government.

From 2009, the Swedish economy emerged as one of the world&#x27;s fastest recovering economies with high competitiveness. Sweden was noted for having proved to overcome the crisis better than any other developed countries, and this was highlighted by the Government as a force in the run-up to the 2010 Swedish general election. As Sweden emerged as the best country on several areas after the Great Recession, it brought a resurgence of support, which eventually resulted in his re-election in 2010. This was the first time ever that the Moderate Party was re-elected after completing a full first term.

==== President of the European Council ====
Reinfeldt became President of the European Council on 1 July 2009, as Sweden took over the Presidency of the Council of the European Union from the Czech Republic. His slogan was &quot;taking on the challenge&quot;. Reinfeldt immediately requested the European Union to do more to combat climate change. Days earlier, he had been interviewed by Reuters and said he spoke of his worry about increased European public debt. He spoke of his wish for Turkey to join the European Union. He also spoke of his other views, such as his hope that a second term would be possible quickly for the President of the European Commission and his desire that the European Union should not sanction Iran immediately following its election protests.

=== Second term (2010–2014) ===
In the 2010 general election, the Moderate Party increased its share of the vote to 30.06 percent. The Alliance got a plurality of votes cast, but with 173 seats no absolute majority in parliament. With the opposition divided mainly by the Sweden Democrats, Reinfeldt could remain in government, but with a greater need to seek consensus on matters of substance with the opposition parties.

The second term compromised a slow recovery from the Great Recession and consolidation of policies from the first term. The political debate came from 2013 to be highly dominated by issues where the Government came in a defense mode, in particular for the poor performance of Swedish pupils in the international study of school performance, the Programme for International Student Assessment, and profits gained in private welfare, especially after the economic collapse that had preceded the closure of school group JB Education AB and questions of how key people in the Government, including himself, acted in the N.V. Nuon Energy affair.

Reinfeldt had during his second term, in contrast to his first term, no major international engagement. Contacts with other politicians, however, remained good, which was also marked by Barack Obama&#x27;s visit to Stockholm in September 2013.

=== Immigration policy ===

After the nationalist Sweden Democrats entered the Riksdag, Reinfeldt wanted to seek bipartisan consensus on immigration policy in an attempt to undercut and isolate the Sweden Democrats on their main issue. In early 2011 an agreement between the Alliance and the Green Party was reached, which would among other things, give undocumented immigrants access to universal healthcare and lessen the requirements for family reunification. During the last year of Reinfeldt&#x27;s time in office Sweden faced the biggest influx of immigrants it had ever seen up until that point. During a press conference in the run-up to the 2014 election campaign Reinfeldt urged the Swedish people to &quot;open their hearts&quot; () to people fleeing wars, stating that he wouldn&#x27;t promise much in the upcoming campaign considering the costs that the immigration would bring. The Sweden Democrats perceived the press conference as confirming their belief that asylum immigration is in conflict with the Swedish welfare state.

=== Economic policy ===
He adopted a liberal roadmap, leading in particular to a modification of the tax system (including the abandonment of inheritance tax), a tightening of the conditions of access to unemployment benefits or sick pay, and the reduction of public spending.

It privatised much of the health sector from 2006, with mixed results. While the number of specialists has increased, reducing waiting times for appointments, privatisation has also led to higher costs for the government (to make a profit, private institutions have to increase the number of consultations and interventions) and increased inequalities in access to health care, with specialists tending to leave the regions for the big cities and the suburbs for wealthier areas.

In early 2013, the liberal British magazine &quot;The Economist&quot; praised the Reinfeldt government&#x27;s reforms, pointing out that the country could become &quot;the next liberal supermodel&quot;. 

=== Foreign policy ===


The Moderate Party has a pro-European Union policy stance—including support for exchanging the SEK for the Euro—and also supports Sweden joining NATO. During the 2000 United States presidential election, Reinfeldt visited the United States to support the campaign of George W. Bush. Prior to the 2004 United States presidential election, Reinfeldt again expressed his support for Bush. In an interview with the newspaper &quot;Stockholm City&quot; on 8 March 2004, Reinfeldt said that he preferred Bush over the Democratic Party contender John Kerry, and in a poll conducted by the newspaper &quot;Svenska Dagbladet&quot; in April 2004, Reinfeldt like a large majority of his party favoured Bush over Kerry.

Despite this, he has compared his government&#x27;s actions and policies to those of Bill Clinton&#x27;s administration, and supported Barack Obama in the 2008 United States presidential election.

Reinfeldt visited Washington, D.C., on 15 May 2007, meeting with President Bush. His trip also included meetings with others, including United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. This is his first visit to the United States since becoming Prime Minister in 2006. Bush and Reinfeldt mostly discussed climate change and free trade, focusing on the Doha Round. He visited President Barack Obama at first the White House and then in the Metropolitan Museum of Art on 23 September 2009.

Reinfeldt was President of the European Council from 1 July to 1 December 2009. The signing of the Treaty of Lisbon was Reinfeldt&#x27;s role as President of the Council, which also occurred on 13 December 2009. Reinfeldt was also responsible in this role to put EU&#x27;s efforts to get into a binding agreement at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen in 2009 but this did not succeed.

== Post-premiership (2014–present) ==
After defeat in 2014, Reinfeldt announced he would step down as both Prime Minister of Sweden and as party leader of the Moderate Party. He stepped down from the office of Prime Minister on 3 October 2014, being succeeded by Stefan Löfven. He resigned from the Riksdag on 31 December 2014 and stepped down as party leader on 10 January 2015, being succeeded by Anna Kinberg Batra.

On 19 January 2015, Reinfeldt announced that he had formed his own business Fredrik Reinfeldt AB where he will serve as an advisor and lecturer. He will also continue to promote his &quot;job line&quot;, which was a key part of his premiership, in a continued community deed. On 1 September 2015 he published his autobiography &quot;Halfway&quot;, a reflection on his 25 years in Swedish and international politics.

On 11 December 2015, Reinfeldt was nominated to become the next chairman of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. 

In January 2016, Reinfeldt was awarded H. M. The King&#x27;s Medal, 12th size with chain, for extraordinary efforts as Prime Minister. On 15 March 2016 it was announced that Reinfeldt had been hired by Bank of America Merrill Lynch as a senior adviser for its business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

On 25 March 2023, he was elected chairman of the Swedish Football Association. In December 2024, he was accused of threatening SFA employees not to voice their scrutiny of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s human rights, after the country was awarded the 2034 FIFA World Cup.

== Public perception ==
Reinfeldt has been called a &quot;Swedish David Cameron,&quot; insofar as he succeeded in shifting the public perception of the Moderate Party from a clear right-wing position to a more centrist one. On the other hand, he is thought to have influenced Cameron, since Reinfeldt was elected party leader in 2003—two years before Cameron took control of the British Conservative Party in 2005. Reinfeldt has also been described as a communitarian.

In a study by Sifo, a Swedish polling institute, Reinfeldt was the &quot;most admired man in Sweden&quot; in 2006. Reinfeldt&#x27;s approval rating reached its highest measured point yet in December 2006, at 57% approval in an &quot;Aftonbladet&quot;/Sifo poll. Approval ratings for Reinfeldt as a person remained overall good but fluctuating through most of the period 2006–2010, but did not always seem to translate into support for the cabinet.

Reinfeldt has been perceived as a controlled and harmonious person. He was described, already before he became prime minister, as &quot;gentle, pensive and a good listener&quot; and his &quot;cool, soft-spoken approach&quot; is said to go down well with Swedish voters; it also fits well with the promotion of the policies of his cabinet as being not ideological, but motivated by non-political reason and common sense, in implicit contrast to the &quot;ideological excesses&quot; of the Social Democrats and their allies. Aware of this perception, Reinfeldt has said &quot;I am by nature confident and calm. But that does not mean I am not passionate and wouldn&#x27;t feel strongly about things.&quot; Regarding his family life, Reinfeldt has cultivated the image of a good family man who enjoys housework.

== Criticism ==

Reinfeldt has been criticized for supposedly anti-Swedish commentary such as &quot;&quot;The&quot; &quot;native&quot; &quot;Swedish culture is only barbaric&quot; (a paraphrase on a line from a poem by Esaias Tegnér from 1836) which referred to the positive effect the inflow of people and influences had on the development of Sweden. Reinfeldt has been called &quot;one of Sweden&#x27;s most dangerous leaders&quot;&quot; in an article by Social Democrat Daniel Suhonen. Reinfeldt has also been criticized for having sold out parts of elderly care, privatized some primary and secondary schools and pharmacies. Reinfeldt received heavy criticism for having proposed in a deputy report, authored by himself, that Swedes should work to the age of 75 and further if possible. SVT published an article of Reinfeldt&#x27;s commentary on Twitter speaking of low unemployment among &quot;ethnic swedes&quot; for which he received severe criticism. Blekinge Läns Tidning published an article criticizing Reinfeldt for being narrow minded stating that &quot;migration can save the pension system&quot;. Breakit criticized Reinfeldt after the &quot;Ipred-lagen&quot; (online piracy law) was passed in Sweden, since he stated that young file-share users would not be chased by the authorities but failed to mention that private corporates could force ISPs to release data. Reinfeldt received criticism for not having provided the financial prerequisites during his eight years in power. Leftist anarchist leaning website AktuelltFokus published an article criticizing Reinfeldt, after leaving politics, for receiving a government pension with monthly payments of 156 000 SEK from Swedish tax money while his own corporate declared a profit of 22 million SEK in 2016. Jimmie Åkesson, party leader of the nationalist Sweden Democrats, has often called Reinfeldt &quot;swede-phobic&quot;.

== Personal life ==
In 1992, Fredrik Reinfeldt married Filippa Holmberg, the daughter of Senior Captain Cay Holmberg and Ulla Molin. Holmberg was a Stockholm County municipal politician for the Moderate Party. During Fredrik&#x27;s tenure as prime minister, Filippa Reinfeldt was County Councillor for healthcare issues () in Stockholm. After being elected Prime Minister in 2006, Reinfeldt moved into the prime minister&#x27;s official residence, the Sager House, together with his wife and their three children, Ebba, Gustaf and Erik. On 7 March 2012 it became known that the couple had separated. On 11 July 2012 the couple signed their divorce papers with consideration of 6 months. On 20 February 2013 they signed the last papers which conducted their divorce.

His father Bruno Reinfeldt was also formerly involved in local politics for the Moderate Party in Täby, but left all his political posts in February 2009 after having been arrested and later convicted for drunk driving.

On 23 February 2015, Reinfeldt confirmed that he was now in a relationship with Roberta Alenius. Alenius served as Head of Communications (Chief of the Press Secretaries) at the Cabinet Office from 2006 to 2014, while Reinfeldt served as Prime Minister. On 2 May 2017, Alenius gave birth to Reinfeldt&#x27;s fourth child and second daughter. The couple announced in 2022 that they had separated.

During the 2006 election, it was brought to attention that Reinfeldt&#x27;s paternal great-great-grandfather, John Hood, was an African American circus director from New York who had a son with Emma Dorotea &quot;Reinfeld&quot;, a maid from Eckau (now Iecava in present-day Latvia). Emma Dorotea Reinfeld later married the Swede Anders Karlsson, but her illegitimate son John kept his mother&#x27;s surname. The spelling was later changed to &quot;Reinfeldt&quot;. He also has Italian ancestry, via his paternal grandmother.

=== Personal opinions ===
He has revealed that his personal distaste for the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats party is based on his partly African ancestry.

Reinfeldt has said that he left the Church of Sweden when he was eighteen years old, critical of the left-leaning perspectives of the church. In an interview as Prime Minister he however said that he could not state if he believed in God, discussing his belief &quot;that something exist that is not just about the scientific explanation for how the Earth was created. But exactly what it is I don&#x27;t have an answer for, I am both searching and wondering.&quot; He was however married, and had his children baptized in the Church of Sweden.

<doc id="379861" wikidata="Q555735" url="?curid=379861" title="Byron Dorgan">
<text>Byron Leslie Dorgan (born May 14, 1942) is an American author, businessman and former politician who served as a United States Representative (1981–1992) and United States Senator (1992–2011) from North Dakota. He is a member of the Democratic Party.

, he serves as a senior policy advisor for the Washington, DC law firm Arent Fox LLP. He was a member of the Senate Democratic leadership for 16 years, first as Assistant Democratic Floor Leader and then as Chairman of the Democratic Policy Committee and Chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs. Dorgan announced that he would not seek re-election in 2010.

In addition to his work at Arent Fox, Dorgan serves as a senior fellow at the Bipartisan Policy Center, where he focuses on energy policy issues as co-chair of BPC&#x27;s Energy Project and is also a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One. He is an adjunct professor at Georgetown University; he also serves on several boards of directors, including the Board of Governors of Argonne National Laboratory and on the National Advisory Board of the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation.

Dorgan is also a &quot;New York Times&quot; best-selling author of five books, including two on economic and political issues, two novels described as eco-thrillers and the latest book titled “The Girl in the Photograph” a true story about a Native American girl living on an Indian Reservation.

==Early life, education, and business career==
Dorgan was born in Dickinson, North Dakota, the son of Dorothy and Emmett Patrick Dorgan, and was raised in Regent, North Dakota. His father&#x27;s family was of Irish and Swedish ancestry, while his mother&#x27;s was German and Norwegian. He graduated from Regent High School and earned a Bachelor of Science from the University of North Dakota and a Master of Business Administration from the University of Denver. Dorgan worked for Boeing and the Martin-Marietta Corporation in the aerospace industry.

== Early political career ==
Dorgan&#x27;s public service career began at age 26, when he was appointed North Dakota State Tax Commissioner to a fill a vacancy opened upon the death of the incumbent tax commissioner. He was the youngest constitutional officer in North Dakota&#x27;s history. He was re-elected to that office by large margins in 1972 and 1976, and was chosen one of &quot;Ten Outstanding State Officials&quot; in the United States by the &quot;Washington Monthly&quot; magazine. His future Senate colleague Kent Conrad worked in the same office before succeeding Dorgan at this post. Dorgan ran unsuccessfully for a seat in Congress in 1974. He was elected to the United States House of Representatives in his second bid in 1980. He was a member from 1981 until 1992, being re-elected five times.

==U.S. Senate==

=== Elections ===
In 1992, the Democratic incumbent, Kent Conrad opted not to run for re-election because of a campaign promise. Dorgan won the election for the seat. However, that September the state&#x27;s other senator, Quentin Burdick, died and Conrad ran for the seat in the special election. Conrad took the new seat in 1992 and Dorgan assumed Conrad&#x27;s old seat a few weeks early. Dorgan was re-elected in 1998 and 2004. Conrad later was elected for a full term from North Dakota&#x27;s other Senate seat.

=== Tenure ===
When Dorgan was chairman of the Democratic Policy Committee, he was one of the most powerful Democrats in the Senate. He was considered &quot;something of a liberal hero.&quot; In the later years of his Senate career, he had been increasingly sought by the national media for comment on political issues. He was a strong opponent of continuing the U.S. embargo toward Cuba. He was instrumental in passing legislation to remove the embargo as it applied to the sale of food and medicine to Cuba. He introduced, with varying levels of success, several amendments to end the U.S. prohibition on travel to Cuba, and to terminate funds for anti-Castro broadcasting. Dorgan has also opposed most bills &quot;liberalizing&quot; trade policies between the United States and other countries, maintaining that most trade agreements resulted in higher trade deficits and shipping U.S. jobs overseas. He has a mixed record on tort reform issues, voting against the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and the Class Action Fairness Act, but voting in favor of the vetoed Common Sense Product Liability and Legal Reform Act and the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act.

=== Chairman of Senate Energy Panel ===
Dorgan was Chairman of the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee and was also senior member of the Senate Energy Committee. He was an early supporter of renewable energy, sponsoring measures on the production tax credit for wind energy and creating a Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS) mandate to help build a renewable fuels industry. He also persuaded the U.S. Geological Survey to conduct and release the first official estimate of recoverable oil in the Bakken Formation in North Dakota. That estimate concluded that there was up to 4.3 billion barrels of recoverable oil from the shale deposits in North Dakota.

=== Chairman of Senate Aviation Panel ===
Dorgan was Chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee of the Senate Commerce Committee and worked extensively on aviation issues. He has served as co-chairman of the Eno Center for Transportation project exploring ways to reorganize the Air Traffic Control function at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in order to accelerate the movement to the next generation air traffic control system using GPS as a replacement for ground-based radar.

=== Red River Valley Research Corridor ===
As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Dorgan earmarked substantial funds to create a Red River Valley Research Corridor to bring new high-tech jobs to that region. The Research Corridor was anchored by North Dakota State University and the University of North Dakota, which became magnets for new economic opportunities and new jobs in materials science, micro and nano-technology research, unmanned aviation vehicle research, among others.

=== Financial Regulation and the 2007–2008 financial crisis ===
As early as 1994, Dorgan was sounding the warning about the speculation in unregulated financial derivatives, which was a central issue in the subprime mortgage crisis and subsequent 2007–2008 financial crisis, by U.S. banks on their proprietary accounts. He wrote the cover story for the Washington Monthly magazine titled &quot;Very Risky Business&quot; warning of the danger to the economy of the wagers that large financial institutions were making by trading in unlimited derivatives.

In 1999, Dorgan voiced continuing concern over lack of regulation of derivatives.

Senator Dorgan was one of only eight members of the Senate to vote against the repeal of key provisions of the Glass-Steagall Act (contained in the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act) in 1999. During debate on that 1999 legislation, in a speech on the Senate floor, he said that, &quot;it will in my judgement raise the likelihood of future massive taxpayer bailouts&quot; (cited in John Lanacaster, Whoops, London, 2010, p. 161). On September 26, 2008, against a backdrop of growing economic turmoil caused by the Credit Crunch, David Leonhardt of &quot;The New York Times&quot; singled out a quotation made by Dorgan in 1999 during the US Senate&#x27;s repeal of the Glass–Steagall Act. &quot;I think we will look back in 10 years&#x27; time and say we should not have done this, but we did because we forgot the lessons of the past, and that that which is true in the 1930s is true in 2010.&quot;

On January 23, 2008, Dorgan was one of the first politicians to speak of the oncoming economic downturn in a speech to the Senate given in response to then-President Bush&#x27;s economic stimulus package.

=== Additional Senate history ===

In 2007, Dorgan was a major supporter of net neutrality legislation in the Senate, seeing it as essential to keeping the Internet open and democratic.

In 2007, he was a major opponent of the McCain-Kennedy Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007 (S. 1639) saying that the legislation&#x27;s guest worker provision would continue the downward push of illegal aliens on the wages of American workers.

In 2009, he voted along with all 39 voting Republican senators and 12 Democrats against an amendment to the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009.

Three times, Dorgan introduced a bill to form a new committee modeled after the 1940s Truman Committee to oversee Government waste, fraud, and corruption in the awarding of government contracts.

In 2009, Dorgan voted to approve the $838 billion stimulus package. The Senate voted 61–37 to pass this legislation.

In 2009, Dorgan sided with fellow Democrats to make funds available to modify or build facilities to allow Guantanamo detainees to be brought to the United States. This was a reversal from his previous vote to not allow federal funds to be used to transfer or incarcerate Guantanamo inmates.

Although Dorgan had indicated in early 2008 he would seek a fourth term in the Senate, on January 5, 2010, he issued a statement announcing he would not run for re-election. In it, he insisted that the &quot;...decision [was] not a reflection of any dissatisfaction with my work in the Senate, nor [was] it connected to a potential election contest [in the fall of 2010] (frankly, I believe if I were to run for another term I would be reelected).&quot; He gave his Senate farewell speech on December 9, 2010.

== Center for Native American Youth ==
Following his departure from the Senate, Dorgan announced the creation of a non-profit organization to help Native American youth living on Indian Reservations. He donated $1 million of unused campaign funds to create the Center for Native American Youth (CNAY), which is housed as a separate program at the Aspen Institute. The center works on teen suicide prevention, providing educational opportunities, and additional issues with Indian youth in the United States. CNAY sponsors a Champions of Change program that recognizes outstanding Native American youth and develops mentors for other youth. Dorgan serves as the unpaid chairman of the Board of CNAY.

== Personal life ==

Dorgan is married to the former Kimberly Olson, who was formerly an Executive Vice President and lobbyist for The American Council of Life Insurers. Together they have two children, Brendon and Haley. From his first marriage, Dorgan has a son Scott who has two children, Mason and Madison, and he also had a daughter Shelly, who is deceased.

==Campaign contribution controversy==
In November 2005, Dorgan was accused of receiving campaign contributions from people who worked for companies connected to lobbyist Jack Abramoff. Because Dorgan was the top Democrat on the committee investigating corruption charges against Abramoff, questions were raised about a possible conflict of interest. In a statement released on November 28, 2005, Dorgan responded by asserting that he has never personally met Jack Abramoff, nor has he ever received money from Abramoff. Dorgan did acknowledge receiving money from Abramoff&#x27;s clients, but the donations began &quot;prior&quot; to their involvement with Abramoff. Dorgan&#x27;s statement went on to say that he has supported the programs that benefited Abramoff&#x27;s clients years prior to the contribution. On December 13, 2005, Dorgan announced that he was returning all donations from Abramoff&#x27;s clients as a precaution to avoid any impropriety as the contributions may have been directed or requested by Abramoff.

<doc id="379868" wikidata="Q1129902" url="?curid=379868" title="Linear differential equation">
<text>In mathematics, a linear differential equation is a differential equation that is defined by a linear polynomial in the unknown function and its derivatives, that is an equation of the form 
formula_1
where and are arbitrary differentiable functions that do not need to be linear, and are the successive derivatives of an unknown function of the variable .

Such an equation is an ordinary differential equation (ODE). A &quot;linear differential equation&quot; may also be a linear partial differential equation (PDE), if the unknown function depends on several variables, and the derivatives that appear in the equation are partial derivatives.

==Types of solution==
A linear differential equation or a system of linear equations such that the associated homogeneous equations have constant coefficients may be solved by quadrature, which means that the solutions may be expressed in terms of integrals. This is also true for a linear equation of order one, with non-constant coefficients. An equation of order two or higher with non-constant coefficients cannot, in general, be solved by quadrature. For order two, Kovacic&#x27;s algorithm allows deciding whether there are solutions in terms of integrals, and computing them if any.

The solutions of homogeneous linear differential equations with polynomial coefficients are called holonomic functions. This class of functions is stable under sums, products, differentiation, integration, and contains many usual functions and special functions such as exponential function, logarithm, sine, cosine, inverse trigonometric functions, error function, Bessel functions and hypergeometric functions. Their representation by the defining differential equation and initial conditions allows making algorithmic (on these functions) most operations of calculus, such as computation of antiderivatives, limits, asymptotic expansion, and numerical evaluation to any precision, with a certified error bound.

==Basic terminology==

The highest order of derivation that appears in a (linear) differential equation is the &quot;order&quot; of the equation. The term , which does not depend on the unknown function and its derivatives, is sometimes called the &quot;constant term&quot; of the equation (by analogy with algebraic equations), even when this term is a non-constant function. If the constant term is the zero function, then the differential equation is said to be &quot;homogeneous&quot;, as it is a homogeneous polynomial in the unknown function and its derivatives. The equation obtained by replacing, in a linear differential equation, the constant term by the zero function is the &quot;&quot;. A differential equation has &quot;constant coefficients&quot; if only constant functions appear as coefficients in the associated homogeneous equation.

A &quot;&quot; of a differential equation is a function that satisfies the equation.
The solutions of a homogeneous linear differential equation form a vector space. In the ordinary case, this vector space has a finite dimension, equal to the order of the equation. All solutions of a linear differential equation are found by adding to a particular solution any solution of the associated homogeneous equation.

==Linear differential operator==

A &quot;basic differential operator&quot; of order is a mapping that maps any differentiable function to its th derivative, or, in the case of several variables, to one of its partial derivatives of order . It is commonly denoted 
formula_2
in the case of univariate functions, and 
formula_3
in the case of functions of variables. The basic differential operators include the derivative of order 0, which is the identity mapping.

A linear differential operator (abbreviated, in this article, as &quot;linear operator&quot; or, simply, &quot;operator&quot;) is a linear combination of basic differential operators, with differentiable functions as coefficients. In the univariate case, a linear operator has thus the form
formula_4
where are differentiable functions, and the nonnegative integer is the &quot;order&quot; of the operator (if is not the zero function).

Let be a linear differential operator. The application of to a function is usually denoted or , if one needs to specify the variable (this must not be confused with a multiplication). A linear differential operator is a linear operator, since it maps sums to sums and the product by a scalar to the product by the same scalar.

As the sum of two linear operators is a linear operator, as well as the product (on the left) of a linear operator by a differentiable function, the linear differential operators form a vector space over the real numbers or the complex numbers (depending on the nature of the functions that are considered). They form also a free module over the ring of differentiable functions.

The language of operators allows a compact writing for differentiable equations: if
formula_5
is a linear differential operator, then the equation 
formula_6
may be rewritten
formula_7

There may be several variants to this notation; in particular the variable of differentiation may appear explicitly or not in and the right-hand and of the equation, such as or .

The &quot;kernel&quot; of a linear differential operator is its kernel as a linear mapping, that is the vector space of the solutions of the (homogeneous) differential equation .

In the case of an ordinary differential operator of order , Carathéodory&#x27;s existence theorem implies that, under very mild conditions, the kernel of is a vector space of dimension , and that the solutions of the equation have the form
formula_8
where are arbitrary numbers. Typically, the hypotheses of Carathéodory&#x27;s theorem are satisfied in an interval , if the functions are continuous in , and there is a positive real number such that for every in .

==Homogeneous equation with constant coefficients==
A homogeneous linear differential equation has &quot;constant coefficients&quot; if it has the form
formula_9
where are (real or complex) numbers. In other words, it has constant coefficients if it is defined by a linear operator with constant coefficients.

The study of these differential equations with constant coefficients dates back to Leonhard Euler, who introduced the exponential function , which is the unique solution of the equation such that . It follows that the th derivative of is , and this allows solving homogeneous linear differential equations rather easily.

Let 
formula_10
be a homogeneous linear differential equation with constant coefficients (that is are real or complex numbers).

Searching solutions of this equation that have the form is equivalent to searching the constants such that
formula_11
Factoring out (which is never zero), shows that must be a root of the &quot;characteristic polynomial&quot;
formula_12
of the differential equation, which is the left-hand side of the characteristic equation
formula_13

When these roots are all distinct, one has distinct solutions that are not necessarily real, even if the coefficients of the equation are real. These solutions can be shown to be linearly independent, by considering the Vandermonde determinant of the values of these solutions at . Together they form a basis of the vector space of solutions of the differential equation (that is, the kernel of the differential operator).

In the case where the characteristic polynomial has only simple roots, the preceding provides a complete basis of the solutions vector space. In the case of multiple roots, more linearly independent solutions are needed for having a basis. These have the form
formula_14
where is a nonnegative integer, is a root of the characteristic polynomial of multiplicity , and . For proving that these functions are solutions, one may remark that if is a root of the characteristic polynomial of multiplicity , the characteristic polynomial may be factored as . Thus, applying the differential operator of the equation is equivalent with applying first times the operator and then the operator that has as characteristic polynomial. By the exponential shift theorem,
formula_15

and thus one gets zero after application of 

As, by the fundamental theorem of algebra, the sum of the multiplicities of the roots of a polynomial equals the degree of the polynomial, the number of above solutions equals the order of the differential equation, and these solutions form a basis of the vector space of the solutions.

In the common case where the coefficients of the equation are real, it is generally more convenient to have a basis of the solutions consisting of real-valued functions. Such a basis may be obtained from the preceding basis by remarking that, if is a root of the characteristic polynomial, then is also a root, of the same multiplicity. Thus a real basis is obtained by using Euler&#x27;s formula, and replacing formula_16 and formula_17 by formula_18 and formula_19. 

===Second-order case===
A homogeneous linear differential equation of the second order may be written 
formula_20
and its characteristic polynomial is
formula_21

If and are real, there are three cases for the solutions, depending on the discriminant . In all three cases, the general solution depends on two arbitrary constants and .

* If , the characteristic polynomial has two distinct real roots , and . In this case, the general solution is formula_22
* If , the characteristic polynomial has a double root , and the general solution is formula_23
* If , the characteristic polynomial has two complex conjugate roots , and the general solution is formula_24 which may be rewritten in real terms, using Euler&#x27;s formula as formula_25

Finding the solution satisfying and , one equates the values of the above general solution at and its derivative there to and , respectively. This results in a linear system of two linear equations in the two unknowns and . Solving this system gives the solution for a so-called Cauchy problem, in which the values at for the solution of the DEQ and its derivative are specified.

==Non-homogeneous equation with constant coefficients==
A non-homogeneous equation of order with constant coefficients may be written
formula_26
where are real or complex numbers, is a given function of , and is the unknown function (for sake of simplicity, &quot;&quot; will be omitted in the following).

There are several methods for solving such an equation. The best method depends on the nature of the function that makes the equation non-homogeneous. If is a linear combination of exponential and sinusoidal functions, then the exponential response formula may be used. If, more generally, is a linear combination of functions of the form , , and , where is a nonnegative integer, and a constant (which need not be the same in each term), then the method of undetermined coefficients may be used. Still more general, the annihilator method applies when satisfies a homogeneous linear differential equation, typically, a holonomic function.

The most general method is the variation of constants, which is presented here.

The general solution of the associated homogeneous equation 
formula_27
is 
formula_28
where is a basis of the vector space of the solutions and are arbitrary constants. The method of variation of constants takes its name from the following idea. Instead of considering as constants, they can be considered as unknown functions that have to be determined for making a solution of the non-homogeneous equation. For this purpose, one adds the constraints
formula_29
which imply (by product rule and induction)
formula_30
for , and
formula_31

Replacing in the original equation and its derivatives by these expressions, and using the fact that are solutions of the original homogeneous equation, one gets 
formula_32

This equation and the above ones with as left-hand side form a system of linear equations in whose coefficients are known functions (, the , and their derivatives). This system can be solved by any method of linear algebra. The computation of antiderivatives gives , and then .

As antiderivatives are defined up to the addition of a constant, one finds again that the general solution of the non-homogeneous equation is the sum of an arbitrary solution and the general solution of the associated homogeneous equation.

==First-order equation with variable coefficients==

The general form of a linear ordinary differential equation of order 1, after dividing out the coefficient of , is: 
formula_33

If the equation is homogeneous, i.e. , one may rewrite and integrate:
formula_34
where is an arbitrary constant of integration and formula_35 is any antiderivative of . Thus, the general solution of the homogeneous equation is
formula_36
where is an arbitrary constant.

For the general non-homogeneous equation, it is useful to multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of a solution of the homogeneous equation. This gives 
formula_37
As the product rule allows rewriting the equation as
formula_38
Thus, the general solution is
formula_39
where is a constant of integration, and is any antiderivative of (changing of antiderivative amounts to change the constant of integration).

=== Example ===
Solving the equation
formula_40
The associated homogeneous equation formula_41 gives
formula_42
that is 
formula_43

Dividing the original equation by one of these solutions gives
formula_44
That is 
formula_45 
formula_46
and
formula_47
For the initial condition
formula_48
one gets the particular solution
formula_49

==System of linear differential equations==
A system of linear differential equations consists of several linear differential equations that involve several unknown functions. In general one restricts the study to systems such that the number of unknown functions equals the number of equations.

An arbitrary linear ordinary differential equation and a system of such equations can be converted into a first order system of linear differential equations by adding variables for all but the highest order derivatives. That is, if appear in an equation, one may replace them by new unknown functions that must satisfy the equations and for .

A linear system of the first order, which has unknown functions and differential equations may normally be solved for the derivatives of the unknown functions. If it is not the case this is a differential-algebraic system, and this is a different theory. Therefore, the systems that are considered here have the form
formula_50
where and the are functions of . In matrix notation, this system may be written (omitting &quot;&quot;)
formula_51

The solving method is similar to that of a single first order linear differential equations, but with complications stemming from noncommutativity of matrix multiplication.

Let
formula_52
be the homogeneous equation associated to the above matrix equation.
Its solutions form a vector space of dimension , and are therefore the columns of a square matrix of functions , whose determinant is not the zero function. If , or is a matrix of constants, or, more generally, if commutes with its antiderivative , then one may choose equal the exponential of . In fact, in these cases, one has 
formula_53
In the general case there is no closed-form solution for the homogeneous equation, and one has to use either a numerical method, or an approximation method such as Magnus expansion.

Knowing the matrix , the general solution of the non-homogeneous equation is
formula_54
where the column matrix formula_55 is an arbitrary constant of integration.

If initial conditions are given as
formula_56
the solution that satisfies these initial conditions is 
formula_57

==Higher order with variable coefficients==
A linear ordinary equation of order one with variable coefficients may be solved by quadrature, which means that the solutions may be expressed in terms of integrals. This is not the case for order at least two. This is the main result of Picard–Vessiot theory which was initiated by Émile Picard and Ernest Vessiot, and whose recent developments are called differential Galois theory.

The impossibility of solving by quadrature can be compared with the Abel–Ruffini theorem, which states that an algebraic equation of degree at least five cannot, in general, be solved by radicals. This analogy extends to the proof methods and motivates the denomination of differential Galois theory.

Similarly to the algebraic case, the theory allows deciding which equations may be solved by quadrature, and if possible solving them. However, for both theories, the necessary computations are extremely difficult, even with the most powerful computers.

Nevertheless, the case of order two with rational coefficients has been completely solved by Kovacic&#x27;s algorithm.

===Cauchy–Euler equation===
Cauchy–Euler equations are examples of equations of any order, with variable coefficients, that can be solved explicitly. These are the equations of the form
formula_58 
where are constant coefficients.

== Holonomic functions==

A holonomic function, also called a &quot;D-finite function&quot;, is a function that is a solution of a homogeneous linear differential equation with polynomial coefficients.

Most functions that are commonly considered in mathematics are holonomic or quotients of holonomic functions. In fact, holonomic functions include polynomials, algebraic functions, logarithm, exponential function, sine, cosine, hyperbolic sine, hyperbolic cosine, inverse trigonometric and inverse hyperbolic functions, and many special functions such as Bessel functions and hypergeometric functions.

Holonomic functions have several closure properties; in particular, sums, products, derivative and integrals of holonomic functions are holonomic. Moreover, these closure properties are effective, in the sense that there are algorithms for computing the differential equation of the result of any of these operations, knowing the differential equations of the input.

Usefulness of the concept of holonomic functions results of Zeilberger&#x27;s theorem, which follows.

A &quot;holonomic sequence&quot; is a sequence of numbers that may be generated by a recurrence relation with polynomial coefficients. The coefficients of the Taylor series at a point of a holonomic function form a holonomic sequence. Conversely, if the sequence of the coefficients of a power series is holonomic, then the series defines a holonomic function (even if the radius of convergence is zero). There are efficient algorithms for both conversions, that is for computing the recurrence relation from the differential equation, and &quot;vice versa&quot;. 
It follows that, if one represents (in a computer) holonomic functions by their defining differential equations and initial conditions, most calculus operations can be done automatically on these functions, such as derivative, indefinite and definite integral, fast computation of Taylor series (thanks of the recurrence relation on its coefficients), evaluation to a high precision with certified bound of the approximation error, limits, localization of singularities, asymptotic behavior at infinity and near singularities, proof of identities, etc.

<text>Conversation analysis (CA) is an approach to the study of social interaction that investigates the methods members use to achieve mutual understanding through the transcription of naturally occurring conversations from audio or video. It focuses on both verbal and non-verbal conduct, especially in situations of everyday life. CA originated as a sociological method, but has since spread to other fields. CA began with a focus on casual conversation, but its methods were subsequently adapted to embrace more task- and institution-centered interactions, such as those occurring in doctors&#x27; offices, courts, law enforcement, helplines, educational settings, and the mass media, and focus on multimodal and nonverbal activity in interaction, including gaze, body movement and gesture. As a consequence, the term &quot;conversation analysis&quot; has become something of a misnomer, but it has continued as a term for a distinctive and successful approach to the analysis of interactions. CA and ethnomethodology are sometimes considered one field and referred to as &quot;EMCA&quot;.

Conversation analysis should not be confused with other methods of analyzing conversation or interaction, such as other areas of pragmatics and discourse analysis.

== History ==
Conversation analysis was developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s principally by the sociologist Harvey Sacks and his close associates Emanuel Schegloff and Gail Jefferson. Sacks was inspired by Harold Garfinkel&#x27;s ethnomethodology and Erving Goffman&#x27;s conception of what came to be known as the &quot;interaction order&quot;, but also a number of minor sources of contemporary influences such as the generativism of Noam Chomsky and its focus on building an apparatus. The speech act theory of John Searle was a parallel development rather than influencing or influenced by CA. Today CA is an established method used in sociology, anthropology, linguistics, speech-communication and psychology, and works alongside related approaches such as interactional sociolinguistics, interactional linguistics, discourse analysis and discursive psychology.

== Method ==
Conversation analysts typically start by gathering audio or video recordings of real life encounters, which they transcribe using a detailed system pioneered by Gail Jefferson. Generalizations are built up through close examination and interpretation of specific encounters with an eye towards trying to uncover the methods the member are using, often from different interactions with different people, but some studies also focus on a &quot;single-case analysis&quot;. Crucially, the method uses the fact that interaction consists of multiple participants and that they make sense of each other, so the method proceeds by considering e.g. how one turn by a specific participant displays an understanding of the previous turn by another participant (or other earlier interaction). This is commonly referred to as the &quot;next-turn proof procedure&quot; even though &quot;proof&quot; is not to be taken literally. Research questions revolve around participants&#x27; orientation, that is, what features (linguistic or other) that cues people to respond in certain ways and influence the trajectory of an interaction. A key part of the method are &quot;deviant cases&quot; in collections, as they show that when a participant does not follow a norm, the interaction is affected in a way that reveals the existence of the norm in focus. Sacks spoke of &#x27;noticeable absences&#x27; in his lectures.

The data used in CA is in the form of video- or audio-recorded conversations, collected with or without researchers&#x27; involvement, typically from a video camera or other recording device in the space where the conversation takes place (e.g. a living room, picnic, or doctor&#x27;s office). The researchers construct detailed transcriptions from the recordings, containing as much detail as is possible.

The transcription often contains additional information about nonverbal communication and the way people say things. &quot;Jeffersonian transcription&quot; is a commonly used method of transcription and nonverbal details are often transcribed according to &quot;Mondadan&quot; conventions by Lorenza Mondada.

After transcription, the researchers perform inductive data-driven analysis aiming to find recurring patterns of interaction. Based on the analysis, the researchers identify regularities, rules or models to describe these patterns, enhancing, modifying or replacing initial hypotheses. While this kind of inductive analysis based on collections of data exhibits is basic to fundamental work in CA, it has been more common in recent years to also use statistical analysis in applications of CA to solve problems in medicine and elsewhere.

While conversation analysis provides a method of analysing conversation, this method is informed by an underlying theory of what features of conversation are meaningful and the meanings that are likely implied by these features. Additionally there is a body of theory about how to interpret conversation.

==Basic structures==
Conversation analysis provides a model that can be used to understand interactions, and offers a number of concepts to describe them. The following section contains important concepts and phenomena identified in the conversation analytical literature, and will refer to articles that are centrally concerned with the phenomenon. A conversation is viewed as a collection of turns of speaking; errors or misunderstandings in speech are addressed with repairs, and turns may be marked by the delay between them or other linguistic features.

===Turn-taking organization===
The analysis of turn-taking started with the description in a model in the paper known as the &quot;Simplest Systematics&quot;, which was very programmatic for the field of Conversation analysis and one of the most cited papers published in the journal &quot;Language&quot;.

The model is designed to explain that when people talk in conversation, they do not always talk all at the same time, but generally, one person speaks at a time, and then another person can follow. Such a contribution to a conversation by one speaker is then a &quot;turn&quot;. A turn is created through certain forms or units that listeners can recognize and count on, called &quot;turn construction units&quot; (TCUs), and speakers and listeners will know that such forms can be a word or a clause, and use that knowledge to predict when a speaker is finished so that others can speak, to avoid or minimize both overlap and silence. A listener will look for the places where they can start speaking - so-called &quot;transition relevant places&quot; (TRPs) - based on how the units appear over time. Turn construction units can be created or recognized via four methods, i.e. types of unit design:
* Grammatical methods, i.e. morphosyntactic structures.
* Prosodic methods, e.g. pitch, speed and changes in pronunciation.
* Pragmatic methods: turns perform actions, and at the point where listeners have heard enough and know enough, a turn can be pragmatically complete.
* Visual methods: Gesture, gaze and body movement is also used to indicate that a turn is over. For example, a person speaking looks at the next speaker when their turn is about to end.

Each time a turn is over, speakers also have to decide who can talk next, and this is called turn allocation. The rules for turn allocation is commonly formulated in the same way as in the original Simplest Systematics paper, with 2 parts where the first consists of 3 elements:

#* a. If the current speaker selects a next one to speak at the end of current TCU (by name, gaze or contextual aspects of what is said), the selected speaker has the right and obligation to speak next. 
#* b. If the current speaker does not select a next speaker, other potential speakers have the right to self-select (the first starter gets the turn)
#* c. If options 1a and 1b have not been implemented, current speaker may continue with another TCU.
# At the end of that TCU, the option system applies again.

Based on the turn-taking system, three types of silence may be distinguished:
* Pause: A period of silence within a speaker&#x27;s TCU, i.e. during a speaker&#x27;s turn when a sentence is not finished.
* Gap: A period of silence between turns, for example after a question has been asked and not yet answered
* Lapse: A period of silence when no sequence or other structured activity is in progress: the current speaker stops talking, does not select a next speaker, and no one self selects. Lapses are commonly associated with visual or other forms of disengagement between speakers, even if these periods are brief.

Some types of turns may require extra work before they can successfully take place. Speakers wanting a long turn, for example to tell a story or describe important news, must first establish that others will not intervene during the course of the telling through some form of preface and approval by the listener (a so-called &quot;go-ahead&quot;). The preface and its associated go-ahead comprise a &quot;pre-sequence&quot;. Conversations cannot be appropriately ended by &#x27;just stopping&#x27;, but require a special closing sequence.

The model also leaves puzzles to be solved, for example concerning how turn boundaries are identified and projected, and the role played by gaze and body orientation in the management of turn-taking. It also establishes some questions for other disciplines: for example, the split second timing of turn-transition sets up a cognitive &#x27;bottle neck&#x27; in which potential speakers must attend to incoming speech while also preparing their own contribution - something which imposes a heavy load of human processing capacity, and which may impact the structure of languages.

However, the original formulation in Sacks et al.1974 is designed to model turn-taking only in ordinary and informal conversation, and not interaction in more specialized, institutional environments such as meetings, courts, news interviews, mediation hearings, which have distinctive turn-taking organizations that depart in various ways from ordinary conversation. Later studies have looked at institutional interaction and turn-taking in institutional contexts. Interruptions have also been examined and analyzed.

===Recipient Design===
In his lectures, Harvey Sacks posited that speakers try to judge what referents their recipients will understand, and design their speech with that in mind, so they will be understood. He called this &#x27;recipient design.&#x27; The psychologist Herbert H. Clark called the same concept &#x27;audience design,&#x27; while psychologist Howard Giles wrote of &#x27;accommodation.&#x27;

===Sequence organization===

==== Adjacency pairs ====

Talk tends to occur in responsive pairs; however, the pairs may be split over a sequence of turns. Adjacency pairs divide utterance types into &quot;first pair parts&quot; and &quot;second pair parts&quot; to form a &quot;pair type&quot;. There are many examples of adjacency pairs including Questions-Answers, Offer-Acceptance/Refusal and Compliment-Response.

==== Sequence expansion ====
Sequence expansion allows talk which is made up of more than a single adjacency pair to be constructed and understood as performing the same basic action and the various additional elements are as doing interactional work related to the basic action underway.Sequence expansion is constructed in relation to a base sequence of a &quot;first pair part&quot; (FPP) and a &quot;second pair part&quot; (SPP) in which the core action underway is achieved. It can occur prior to the base FPP, between the base FPP and SPP, and following the base SPP.
* Pre-expansion: an adjacency pair that may be understood as preliminary to the main course of action. A generic pre-expansion is a summon-answer adjacency pair, as in &quot;Mary?&quot;/ &quot;Yes?&quot;. It is generic in the sense that it does not contribute to any particular types of base adjacency pair, such as request or suggestion. There are other types of pre-sequence that work to prepare the interlocutors for the subsequent speech action. For example, &quot;Guess what!&quot;/&quot;What?&quot; as preliminary to an announcement of some sort, or &quot;What are you doing?&quot;/&quot;Nothing&quot; as preliminary to an invitation or a request.
* Insert expansion: an adjacency pair that comes between the FPP and SPP of the base adjacency pair. Insert expansions interrupt the activity under way, but are still relevant to that action. Insert expansion allows a possibility for a second speaker, the speaker who must produce the SPP, to do interactional work relevant to the projected SPP. An example of this would be a typical conversation between a customer and a shopkeeper:
::Customer: I would like a turkey sandwich, please. (FPP base)
::Server: White or wholegrain? (Insert FPP)
::Customer: Wholegrain. (Insert SPP)
::Server: Okay. (SPP base)
* Post-expansion: a turn or an adjacency pair that comes after, but is still tied to, the base adjacency pair. There are two types: minimal and non-minimal. Minimal expansion is also termed &quot;sequence closing thirds&quot;, because it is a single turn after the base SPP (hence &quot;third&quot;) that does not project any further talk beyond their turn (hence &quot;closing&quot;). Examples of sequence closing thirds include &quot;oh&quot;, &quot;I see&quot;, &quot;okay&quot;, etc.

==== Preference organization ====
CA may reveal structural (i.e. practice-underwritten) preferences in conversation for some types of actions (within sequences of action) over others, as responses in certain sequential environments. For example, responsive actions which agree with, or accept, positions taken by a first action tend to be performed more straightforwardly and faster than actions that disagree with, or decline, those positions. The former is termed a preferred turn shape, meaning the turn is not preceded by silence nor is it produced with delays, mitigation and accounts. The latter is termed a dispreferred turn shape, which describes a turn with opposite characteristics. One consequence of this is that agreement and acceptance are promoted over their alternatives, and are more likely to be the outcome of the sequence. Pre-sequences are also a component of preference organization and contribute to this outcome.

=== Repair ===
Repair organization describes how parties in conversation deal with problems in speaking, hearing, or understanding, and there are various mechanisms through which certain &quot;troubles&quot; in interaction are dealt with. Repair segments are classified by who initiates repair (self or other), by who resolves the problem (self or other), and by how it unfolds within a turn or a sequence of turns. The organization of repair is also a self-righting mechanism in social interaction. Participants in conversation seek to correct the trouble source by initiating and preferring self repair, the speaker of the trouble source, over other repair. Self repair initiations can be placed in three locations in relation to the trouble source, in a first turn, a transition space or in a third turn.

===Action formation===
Turns in interaction implement actions, and a specific turn may perform one (or more) specific actions. The study of action focuses on the description of how turns at talk are composed and positioned so as to realize one or more actions. This could include questions, assessments, storytelling, and complaints. Focus is both on how those actions are formed through linguistic or other activity (the &quot;formation&quot; of action) and how they are understood (the &quot;ascription&quot; of action to turns). The study of action also concerns the ways in which the participants’ knowledge, relations, and stances towards the ongoing interactional projects are created, maintained, and negotiated, and thus the intersubjectivity of how people interact. The concept of &quot;action&quot; within CA resembles, but is different from the concept of speech act in other fields of pragmatics.

==Jeffersonian transcription==
Gail Jefferson developed a system of transcription while working with Harvey Sacks. In this system, speakers are introduced with a name followed by a colon, as conventionally used in scripts. It is designed to use typographical and orthographical conventions used elsewhere, rather than a strict phonetic system such as the International Phonetic Alphabet. The transcription conventions take into account overlapping speech, delays between speech, pitch, volume and speed based on research showing that these features matter for the conversation in terms of action, turn-taking and more. Transcripts are typically written in a monospaced font to ease the alignment of overlap symbols.

There are various transcription systems based on the jeffersonian conventions with slight differences. Galina Bolden has designed a system for transcribing Russian conversations while Samtalegrammatik.dk uses their own system for Danish. GAT2 (&quot;Gesprächsanalytisches Transskriptionssystem 2&quot;) was also designed originally for German and to systematize the way some of the prosodic features are handled. The TalkBank also has its own system designed for use with its CLAN (CHILDES Language Analyzer) software.

==Different approaches==
===Interactional linguistics===

Interactional linguistics (IL) is Conversation analysis when the focus is on linguistic structure. While CA has worked with language in its data since the beginning, the interest in the structure of it, and possible relations to grammatical theory, was sometimes secondary to sociological (or ethnomethodological) research questions. The field developed during the 90&#x27;s and got its name with the publication of the 2001 &quot;Studies in Interactional Linguistics&quot; and is inspired by West Coast functional grammar which is sometimes considered to have effectively merged with IL since then, but has also gained inspiration from British phoneticians doing prosodic analysis. Levinson&#x27;s former department on Language and Cognition at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics has been important in connecting CA and IL with linguistic typology. Interactional linguistics has studied topics within syntax, phonetics and semantics as they relate to e.g. action and turn-taking. There is a journal called &quot;Interactional Linguistics&quot;.

===Discursive psychology===

Discursive psychology (DP) is the use of CA on psychological themes, and studies how psychological phenomena are attended to, understood and construed in interaction. The subfield formed through studies by Jonathan Potter and Margaret Wetherell, most notably their 1987 book &quot;Discourse and social psychology: Beyond attitudes and behaviour&quot;.

===Membership categorization analysis===
Membership categorization analysis (MCA) was influenced by the work of Harvey Sacks and his work on Membership Categorization Devices (MCD). Sacks argues that members&#x27; categories comprise part of the central machinery of organization and developed the notion of MCD to explain how categories can be hearably linked together by native speakers of a culture. His example that is taken from a children&#x27;s storybook (&quot;The baby cried. The mommy picked it up&quot;) shows how &quot;mommy&quot; is interpreted as the mother of the baby by speakers of the same culture. In light of this, categories are inference rich – a great deal of knowledge that members of a society have about the society is stored in terms of these categories. Emanuel Schegloff fleshed out the concept in his article on the formulation of place. When asked &#x27;where are you from?&#x27; the recipient can choose to respond in many different ways, eg. Main St., downtown, Irvine, California, the United States. How they respond shows what identity they hope to claim, and the questioner will decide whether the recipient is indeed a member of the group they claim to be a member of based on how they speak going forward. There is a connection here with the Other (philosophy) in philosophy, social identity theory, and &quot;The Social Construction of Reality.&quot; Stokoe further contends that members’ practical categorizations form part of ethnomethodology&#x27;s description of the ongoing production and realization of ‘facts’ about social life and including members’ gendered reality analysis, thus making CA compatible with feminist studies.

==Relations to other fields==
=== Contrasts to other theories about language ===
In contrast to the use of introspection in linguistics, conversation analysis studies naturally-occurring talk in a strongly empirical fashion through the use of recordings Unlike ethnographers, Conversation Analysts tend to focus on transcribing recordings, and usually do not question the people doing the talk nor members of their speech community to ask for their interpretations. A lot of CA research has been done by researchers analyzing encounters in their own native tongue rather than in other languages.

Unlike discourse analysis, Conversation Analysts focus on interaction at a micro level, and usually do not look at written texts nor overarching sociocultural concepts (for example, &#x27;discourses&#x27; in the Foucauldian sense). Its method, following Garfinkel and Goffman&#x27;s initiatives, is aimed at uncovering the methods that the interacting members rely on to make sense of each other. Conversation Analysts look for clues to these methods in the actions of the interlocutors themselves rather than trying to impose some outside analytical framework onto them. The aim is to model the resources and methods by which those understandings are produced.

In considering methods of qualitative analysis, Braun and Clarke distinguish thematic analysis from conversation analysis and discourse analysis, viewing thematic analysis to be theory agnostic while conversation analysis and discourse analysis are considered to be based on theories although Sacks himself argued that researchers should follow the data.

=== Applied conversation analysis ===
Conversation analysis is used in various contexts leading to a number of different fields benefitting from conversation analytic findings. This includes the study of doctor-patient interactions, media interviews, second-language acquisition, and various institutional settings. For instance, Tanya Stivers studied the pressures that lead to doctors prescribing antibiotics. A focus on interaction in professional contexts was established by the 1992 book &quot;Talk at Work&quot; by Paul Drew and John Heritage, but earlier studies had also focused on specific institutional contexts, mostly one at a time. More recently, conversation analysis has also been used in the development of conversational user interfaces and chatbots.

==Criticism==
Conversation analysis has been criticized for not being able to address issues of power and inequality in society at large. Another point of critique is the focus on single-case analysis and the generalizability of collection-based descriptions has been questioned.

<text>Dawn Fraser (born 4 September 1937) is an Australian freestyle champion swimmer, eight-time olympic medallist, a 15-year world record holder in the 100-metre freestyle, and former politician. Controversial, yet the winner of countless honours, she has enjoyed national prominence and sparked national pride in Australia. She is one of only four swimmers to have won the same Olympic individual event three times – in her case the women&#x27;s 100-metre freestyle.

==Early life==
Fraser was born in the Sydney suburb of Balmain, New South Wales, in 1937 into a poor working-class family, the youngest of eight children. Her father, Kenneth Fraser, was from Embo, Scotland. She was spotted at the early age of 14 by Sydney coach Harry Gallagher swimming at the local harbourside baths.

==Swimming career==

As a highlight of her swimming career, Fraser held 39 records and won eight Olympic medals for Australia, including four gold. Adding to her popularity in her native country and the British Commonwealth, she captured six Commonwealth Games gold medals. She dominated the high profile 100 metres freestyle event, holding the record for 15 years from 1 December 1956 to 8 January 1972.

She is the first of only four swimmers in Olympic history (Hungarian Krisztina Egerszegi and Americans Michael Phelps and Katie Ledecky being the three others) to have won individual gold medals for the same event at three successive Olympics (100 metres freestyle – 1956, 1960, 1964).

In October 1962, she became the first woman to swim the 100 metres freestyle in less than one minute setting the record of 58.9, a feat that elevated her to national prominence and made her a hero in Australia where swimming was a popular sport. It was not until 1972, eight years after Fraser retired, that her 100 m record of 58.9 secs was broken.

Several weeks before the 1964 Olympics, Fraser was injured in a car crash that injured a vertebra and resulted in the death of her mother Rose. Her sister and a friend were also travelling in Fraser&#x27;s car during the accident, but survived. This was a fresh tragedy for Fraser and her family following her older brother&#x27;s death from leukemia in 1950, and her father&#x27;s death from cancer in 1960.

===1964 Summer Olympics incidents and ban from swimming===
During the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Fraser angered swimming team sponsors and the Australian Swimming Union (ASU) by marching in the opening ceremony against their wishes, and wearing an older swimming costume in competition, as she found it more comfortable than the one supplied by the sponsors. She was also accused of stealing an Olympic flag from a flagpole outside Emperor Hirohito&#x27;s palace, the Kōkyo. She was arrested but released without charge. In the end she was given the flag as a souvenir.

Fraser later denied having swum the moat to steal the flag, telling &quot;The Times&quot; in 1991: &quot;There&#x27;s no way I would have swum that moat. I was terrified of dirty water and that moat was filthy. There&#x27;s no way I&#x27;d have dipped my toe in it.&quot; The Australian Amateur Swimming Association banned Fraser from competitive swimming for 10 years.

==Post-swimming activities==
Fraser became a at the Riverview Hotel, Balmain, and took up swim coaching.

In 1988, Fraser was elected as an independent to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for the seat of Balmain. The Balmain electorate was abolished in 1991, and after failing to win the new seat of Port Jackson, she retired from politics.

== Personal life ==
Fraser married Gary Ware on 30 January 1965 at St Stephen’s Church, Macquarie Street, Sydney. The marriage was short-lived. She has one daughter from the marriage, who has a son. She and her family live in Noosa on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland. This move north from Sydney to the warmer, subtropical climate of Noosa was intended to reduce the breathing problems caused by Fraser&#x27;s asthma, as the warmer air and increased vitamin D from sunlight are beneficial for the condition.

Fraser is the great-aunt of Canadian soccer player Danielle Steer.

==Controversies==
===Political and racial views===
In 1997, Fraser told the ABC: &quot;I mean I wish I could be as outspoken, I suppose, as Pauline Hanson and say, &#x27;look, I&#x27;m sick and tired of the immigrants that are coming into my country.&#x27;&quot; Fraser also stated her interest in joining Hanson&#x27;s One Nation Party.

In 2015, during an interview on the &quot;Today&quot; program, Fraser was asked about recent behaviour of Nick Kyrgios at Wimbledon and Bernard Tomic’s comments about Tennis Australia, which resulted in Tomic being removed from the Davis Cup team. Fraser said, &quot;They should be setting a better example for the younger generation of this country ... If they don’t like it, go back to where their fathers or their parents came from&quot;. (Kyrgios is of Malay and Greek ancestry, while Tomic is of Croat extraction.) Kyrgios responded by describing her as a &quot;blatant racist&quot;, and Fraser&#x27;s comments were criticised by Australia’s Race Discrimination Commissioner Tim Soutphommasane. Fraser &quot;unreservedly&quot; apologised for her comments.

==In popular culture==
In 1979, a movie called &quot;Dawn!&quot; was made about Fraser&#x27;s life and career. It starred Bronwyn Mackay-Payne as Fraser.

Fraser was played by Melissa Thomas in the 2003 film &quot;Swimming Upstream&quot;. Fraser herself is credited in the film as Dawn Fraser&#x27;s coach.
On 1 September 2015, Dawn Fraser featured on Season 7, Episode 5, of the SBS genealogy television series &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;, which traced her heritage back to South America.

==Honours==
Lauded as an Australian hero, Fraser was named the Australian of the Year in 1964, was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 1965, was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) using her married name Dawn Ware in 1967, and was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in 1998. She was named Australian Female Athlete of the Century by the Sport Australia Hall of Fame, who had inducted her as their first female member in 1985. In 1999 the International Olympic Committee named her the World&#x27;s Greatest Living Female Water Sports Champion. On 14 July 2000, Fraser was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for &quot;outstanding contribution as a swimming competitor&quot;.

She was one of the bearers of the Olympic Torch at the opening ceremony of the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. She carried the Olympic Torch at the stadium, as one of the bearers for the final segment, before the lighting of the Olympic Flame.

The Australian Sport Awards includes an award named in honour of and presented by Fraser. The harbourside baths in Balmain where she swam were named the Dawn Fraser Swimming Pool in her honour in 1964, and in 1992, the State Transit Authority named a RiverCat ferry after Fraser.

As part of the 2018 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours she was advanced to a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC).

In 2022, she was an inaugural inductee of the Swimming Australia Hall of Fame.

<doc id="379879" wikidata="Q565026" url="?curid=379879" title="Teatro Yagüez">
<text>The Teatro Yagüez in Puerto Rico is a historic building that today is a performing arts theater. It is located at Candelaria Street, (formerly &quot;Calle McKinley&quot;) and Dr. Basora Streets, in the city of Mayagüez. The theater building consists of the Lucy Boscana Hall and the Roberto Cole Cafe Theater.

==History==

It was originally erected by Francisco Maymón Palmer in 1909. Maymón&#x27;s parents emigrated to Puerto Rico from Italy in the 19th century. They settled in the town of San German. Early in the 20th century Francisco tried to build a theatre in the town of San German but was unable due to the existing religious culture then, which considered a theatre as a &quot;bad influence&#x27; on the local population. Maymón was an entrepreneur by vocation, having travelled to Europe and the United States in his 20s, and he would not be stopped. He moved to the nearby city of Mayaguez where he established himself as one of the pioneers of the industry of cinematography in the island of Puerto Rico, introducing this new form of Visual Art early in the beginning of the 20th century by showing silent films throughout the nearby towns and becoming the exclusive distributor for &#x27;Nicholas Power Co.&#x27; movie projectors throughout the Caribbean islands. The &#x27;Nicholas Power Company&#x27; was located in New York. With the help of his business partners Mr. Jose Rahola and Mr. Fundador Vargas, he imported movies from the Pathé Company in Europe, showing them in town centers (plazas) under the stars and at the old Mayaguez Municipal Theater (&#x27;Teatro Municipal&#x27;). The latter no longer exists, as it was destroyed in the 1918 earthquake that hit the city and was never rebuilt, hence the Teatro Yagüez became the city&#x27;s preferred gathering place for opera, plays, concerts, and silent movies.

Francisco purchased the land where the Yaguez sits today around 1905. The construction of the first Teatro Yagüez building began around 1907; The formal inauguration was in 1909. Materials such as the cement was imported from Germany, interior ceilings from Italy, tiles and carpets from Spain. An architectural jewel, the Teatro Yagüez began as a neo-baroque style Opera House, years later turning into a silent movie theater. Incorrectly described as art deco style, however, the art deco movement developed years after the theater&#x27;s first construction and later reconstruction.

Maymón suffered a great loss, when on June 19, 1919, a fire destroyed his beloved Teatro Yagüez. The World Almanac and Book of Facts states that 150 people died in the fire, although the records are vague and mostly sensationalist. According to the evidence, investigations after the fire exonerated him of all culpability, and indeed pointed the finger at local entities (namely the Municipal government body at the time), who had an interest in the location (the land) where the Teatro Yagüez stood, and who indeed, tried to purchase the land after the fire, and being unable to purchase it, attempted to expropriate it but without any success. However, there was never any evidence, only accusations and theories never proven. 100 years later, a new theory came forth, the most likely suspect of that fire was the nitrate films stored in a closet inside the theatre. The Teatro Yagüez was finally rebuilt and re-inaugurated on March 21, 1921 after a lawsuit between Francisco Maymón and the Municipal Council of the city, in which Francisco Maymón prevailed.
&quot;The current building was the product of one of the most brilliant architects of the era, [José Sabàs Honoré], who designed the new theater after the June 1919 fire.&quot;

Francisco Maymon&#x27;s son and daughter, Miguel A. Maymón Camuñas, and Petra Maymón Cernuda inherited the Teatro Yagüez in 1954 after Francisco&#x27;s passing. In 1959, Miguel purchased his sister&#x27;s share in the Yagüez, becoming sole proprietor of the Teatro Yagüez.

In 1976, the U.S. government sent a Bicentennial Commission to Puerto Rico, who declared the Teatro Yagüez a landmark. Under the administration of Benjamin Cole, the municipality of Mayagüez purchased the Yagüez in 1980 and restored it to its original magnificence in 1984. It was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1985 and on the Puerto Rico Register of Historic Sites and Zones in 2003.

The Teatro Yaguez has been fully restored and is in use today. It remains as a beautiful reminder of the history of theater and arts of the early 20th century in Puerto Rico. Its stage and auditorium were renamed as Lucy Boscana Hall in December 2008, in tribute to the Mayagüez-born actress and teacher.

Maymón named the Teatro Yagüez: &quot;La Catedral Del Arte Sonoro&quot;. (The Cathedral of Sonorous Art), a nickname that has prevailed to this day as the Yaguez is visually and architecturally, a Cathedral.

<text>An obituary ( for short) is an article about a recently deceased person. Newspapers often publish obituaries as news articles. Although obituaries tend to focus on positive aspects of the subject&#x27;s life, this is not always the case. According to Nigel Farndale, the Obituaries Editor of &quot;The Times&quot;, obituaries ought to be &quot;balanced accounts&quot; written in a &quot;deadpan&quot; style, and should not read like a hagiography.

In local newspapers, an obituary may be published for any local resident upon death. A necrology is a register or list of records of the deaths of people related to a particular organization, group or field, which may only contain the sparsest details, or small obituaries. Historical necrologies can be important sources of information.

Two types of paid advertisements are related to obituaries. One, known as a death notice, usually appears in the Births, Marriages and Deaths (BMD) section of a paper and omits most biographical details and may be a legally required public notice under some circumstances. The other type, a paid memorial advertisement, is usually written by family members or friends, perhaps with assistance from a funeral home. Both types of paid advertisements are usually run as classified advertisements.

The word also applies to the entire program booklet for a funeral and the part of that program describing the life of the deceased. It is given to those who attend the service. The verso page heading may be &quot;Obituary&quot; or &quot;Reflections&quot;, the recto heading is usually &quot;Order of Service&quot;.

== Media ==

Obituaries are a notable feature of &quot;The Economist&quot;, which publishes one full-page obituary per week, reflecting on the subject&#x27;s life and influence on world history. Past subjects have ranged from Ray Charles to Uday Hussein to George Floyd.

&quot;The Times&quot; and the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; publish anthologies of obituaries under a common theme, such as military obituaries, sports obituaries, heroes and adventurers, entertainers, rogues, eccentric lives, etc.

The &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; encourages doctors to write their own obituaries for publication after their death.

For numerous summer seasons, CBC Radio One has run &quot;The Late Show&quot;, a radio documentary series which presents extended obituaries of interesting Canadians.

==Prewritten obituaries==

Many news organizations maintain prewritten (or preedited video) obituaries on file for notable individuals who are still living, in order to promptly publish detailed, authoritative, and lengthy obituaries upon their deaths. These are also known as &quot;advance&quot; obituaries. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;″ obituary of Elizabeth Taylor, for example, was written in 1999 after three months of research, then often updated before the actress&#x27; 2011 death. Sometimes the prewritten obituary&#x27;s subject outlives its author. One example is &quot;The New York Times&quot;&#x27; obituary of Taylor, written by the newspaper&#x27;s theater critic Mel Gussow, who died in 2005. The 2023 obituary of Henry Kissinger featured reporting by Michael T. Kaufman, who died almost 14 years earlier in 2010. 

Writing in 2021, Paul Farhi of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; observed that while once a &quot;sleepy corner of journalism&quot;, publications in the Internet age have invested more resources in preparing advance obituaries for rapid publication online, in order to meet widespread public interest; obituaries can attract millions of readers online within days of their subjects&#x27; deaths. &quot;The New York Times&quot; maintains a &quot;deep reservoir&quot; of advance obituaries, estimated to stand at roughly 1,850 . The paper often interviews notables specifically for their obituaries, a practice begun by Alden Whitman in 1966. , &quot;The Washington Post&quot; has about 900 advance obituaries on file, and entertainment publication &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; has prepared 800 advances for notable figures in the film and television industry. 

An advance obituary is usually not written until the subject has reached old age, as the earlier a profile is written, the more additions and revisions it will likely require. Former &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary writer Margalit Fox wrote that &quot;as a general rule, when lives are long enough, accomplished enough and complex enough that we would just as soon not get caught short writing them on deadline, advances are assigned&quot;. Consequently, many public figures who die unexpectedly or prematurely will have no obituary available at a given publication, and journalists will be left to research and write lengthy articles on short notice. However, Farhi noted that advance obituaries of younger people will occasionally be prepared if they are known to have health problems or &quot;chaotic lives&quot;; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; had an advance obituary for singer Amy Winehouse, whose struggles with substance abuse were widely chronicled before her death at age 27. In another case, Nigel Farndale, an obituaries editor for &quot;The Times&quot;, said that in April 2020, when news broke that then-British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was in an intensive care unit with COVID-19 during the pandemic, he was under considerable pressure to quickly prepare an obituary that could be immediately published if Johnson died from the disease.

Still, for particularly major figures, advance obituaries may be drafted early in their lives and revised constantly throughout the following years or decades. Bill McDonald, obituaries editor of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, estimated in 2016 that Fidel Castro&#x27;s obituary &quot;cost us more man/woman hours over the years than any piece we&#x27;ve ever run&quot;. Work on it began in 1959, and it went through many subsequent iterations. Well into the 21st century, the visual layout for the obituary was substantially modified to match changes in the paper&#x27;s page size, and a presentation for its digital edition cycled through different slideshow and video formats to match advances in Internet download speeds. The newspaper began drafting an obituary for Queen Elizabeth II when she was still heir apparent, and it was rewritten in its entirety multiple times until her death in 2022.

== Premature obituaries ==
A premature obituary is a false reporting of the death of a person who is still alive. It may occur due to unexpected survival of someone who was close to death. Other reasons for such publication might be miscommunication between newspapers, family members, and the funeral home, often resulting in embarrassment for everyone involved. 

In November 2020, Radio France Internationale accidentally published about 100 prewritten obituaries for celebrities such as Queen Elizabeth II and Clint Eastwood. The premature publication was blamed on a transition to a new content management system.

Irish author Brendan Behan said, &quot;there is no such thing as bad publicity except your own obituary.&quot; In this regard, some people seek to have an unsuspecting newspaper editor publish a premature death notice or obituary as a malicious hoax, perhaps to gain revenge on the &quot;deceased&quot;. To that end, nearly all newspapers now have policies requiring that death notices come from a reliable source (such as a funeral home), though even this has not stopped some pranksters such as Alan Abel.

<doc id="379882" wikidata="Q55384" url="?curid=379882" title="Henri-Georges Clouzot">
<text>Henri-Georges Clouzot (; 20 November 1907 – 12 January 1977) was a French film director, screenwriter and producer. He is best remembered for his work in the thriller film genre, having directed &quot;The Wages of Fear&quot; (1953) and &quot;Les Diaboliques&quot; (1955), which are critically recognized as among the greatest films of the 1950s. He also directed documentary films, including &quot;The Mystery of Picasso&quot; (1956), which was declared a national treasure by the government of France.

Clouzot was an early fan of the cinema and, desiring a career as a writer, moved to Paris. He was later hired by producer Adolphe Osso to work in Berlin, writing French-language versions of German films. After being fired from UFA studio in Nazi Germany due to his friendship with Jewish producers, Clouzot returned to France, where he spent years bedridden after contracting tuberculosis. Upon recovering, he found work in Nazi-occupied France as a screenwriter for the German-owned company Continental Films. At Continental, Clouzot wrote and directed films that were very popular. His second film &quot;Le Corbeau&quot; drew controversy over its harsh look at provincial France, and he was fired from Continental before its release. As a result of his association with Continental, he was barred by the French government from filmmaking until 1947.

After the ban was lifted, Clouzot reestablished his reputation and popularity in France during the late 1940s with successful films including &quot;Quai des Orfèvres&quot;. After the release of his comedy film &quot;Miquette&quot;, Clouzot married Véra Gibson-Amado, who would star in his next three feature films. In the early and mid-1950s, Clouzot drew acclaim from international critics and audiences for &quot;The Wages of Fear&quot; and &quot;Les Diaboliques&quot;; both films would serve as source material for remakes decades later. After the release of &quot;La Vérité&quot;, his wife Véra died of a heart attack, and Clouzot&#x27;s career suffered due to depression, illness and new critical views of films from the French New Wave. 

Clouzot&#x27;s career became less active in later years, limited to a few television documentaries and two feature films in the 1960s. He wrote several unused scripts in the 1970s and died in Paris in 1977.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Henri-Georges Clouzot was born in Niort, Deux-Sèvres, to mother Suzanne Clouzot and father Georges Clouzout, a bookstore owner. He was the first of three children in a middle-class family. Clouzot showed talent by writing plays and playing piano recitals. His father&#x27;s bookstore went bankrupt, and the family moved to Brest where Georges Clouzout became an auctioneer. In Brest, Henri-Georges Clouzot went to Naval School, but was unable to become a Naval Cadet due to his myopia. At the age of 18, Clouzot left for Paris to study political science. Whilst living in Paris, he became friends with several magazine editors. His writing talents led him to theater and cinema as a playwright, lyricist and adaptor-screenwriter. The quality of his work led producer Adolphe Osso to hire him and send him to Germany to work in Studio Babelsberg in Berlin, translating scripts for foreign-language films shot there.

===Career===

====Screenwriting career (1931–1942)====
Throughout the 1930s Clouzot worked by writing and translating scripts, dialogue and occasionally lyrics for over twenty films. While living in Germany, he saw the films of F. W. Murnau and Fritz Lang and was deeply influenced by their expressionist style. Clouzot made his first short film, &quot;La Terreur des Batignolles&quot;, from a script by Jacques de Baroncelli. The film is a 15-minute comedy with three actors. Film historian and critic Claude Beylie reported this short was &quot;surprisingly well made with expressive use of shadows and lighting contrasts that Clouzot would exploit on the full-length features he would make years later&quot;. Clouzot&#x27;s later wife, Inès de Gonzalez, said in 2004 that &quot;La Terreur des Batignolles&quot; added nothing to Clouzot&#x27;s reputation. In Berlin, Clouzot saw several parades for Adolf Hitler and was shocked at how oblivious he felt France was to what was happening in Germany. In 1934, Clouzot was fired from UFA Studios for his friendship with Jewish film producers such as Adolphe Osso and Pierre Lazareff.

In 1935, Clouzot was diagnosed with tuberculosis and was sent first to Haute-Savoie and then to Switzerland, where he was bedridden for nearly five years in all. Clouzot&#x27;s time in the sanatorium would be very influential on his career. While bedridden, Clouzot read constantly and learned the mechanics of storytelling to help improve his scripts. Clouzot also studied the fragile nature of the other people in the sanatorium. Clouzot had little money during this period, and was provided with financial and moral support by his family and friends. By the time Clouzot left the sanatorium and returned to Paris, World War II had broken out. French cinema had changed because many of the producers he had known had fled France to escape Nazism.

Clouzot&#x27;s health problems kept him from military service. In 1939, he met actor Pierre Fresnay, who was already an established film star in France. Clouzot wrote the script for Fresnay&#x27;s only directorial feature &quot;Le Duel&quot;, as well as two plays for him: &quot;On prend les mêmes&quot;, which was performed in December 1940, and &quot;Comédie en trois actes&quot;, which was performed in 1942. Despite writing scripts for films and plays, Clouzot was so poor that he resorted to trying to sell lyrics to French singer Édith Piaf, who declined to purchase them. In World War II, after France was invaded by Germany and subsequently during the German occupation, the German-operated film production company Continental Films was established in October 1940. Alfred Greven, the director of Continental, knew Clouzot from Berlin and offered him work to adapt stories of writer Stanislas-André Steeman. Clouzot felt uncomfortable working for the Germans, but was in desperate need of money and could not refuse Greven&#x27;s offer. Clouzot&#x27;s first film for Continental was the adaptation of Steeman&#x27;s mystery novel &quot;Six hommes morts&quot; (&quot;Six Dead Men&quot;). Clouzot retitled the film &quot;Le Dernier des six&quot;, having been influenced by actress Suzy Delair while writing the script, allowing her to choose the name of the character she would play.

====Early directorial work (1942–1947)====
After the success of &quot;Le Dernier de six&quot;, Clouzot was hired as the head of Continental&#x27;s screenwriting division. Clouzot began work on his second Steeman adaptation, which he would also direct, titled &quot;The Murderer Lives at Number 21&quot;. It starred Fresnay and Delair playing the same roles they had performed in &quot;Le Dernier de six&quot;. Released in 1942, the film was popular with audiences and critics. Clouzot&#x27;s next film was &quot;Le Corbeau&quot; based on a true story about a woman who sent poison pen letters in 1922. Grevin was against Clouzot making this film, stating that topic was &quot;dangerous&quot;. &quot;Le Corbeau&quot; would be the last film that Fresnay and Clouzot would work together on. Clouzot had used all possible means to try to anger the actor during the filming, and after he quarreled with Fresnay&#x27;s wife, Yvonne Printemps, Fresnay and Clouzot broke off their friendship. &quot;Le Corbeau&quot; was a great success in France, with nearly 250,000 people having seen it in the first months of its initial release. &quot;Le Corbeau&quot; was released in 1943 and generated controversy from the right-wing Vichy regime, the left-wing Resistance press and the Catholic Church. The Catholic Church considered the film &quot;painful and hard, constantly morbid in its complexity&quot;. The Vichy press dubbed it the antithesis of the Révolution nationale and demanded it be banned due to its immoral values. The anti-Nazi resistance press considered it Nazi propaganda because of its negative portrayal of the French populace. Two days before the release of &quot;Le Corbeau&quot;, Continental films fired Clouzot.

After the liberation of France, Clouzot and several other directors were tried in court for collaborating with the Germans. For his sentence, Clouzot was forbidden from going on set of any film or from using a film camera for the rest of his life. Clouzot received letters of support from filmmakers and artists Jean Cocteau, René Clair, Marcel Carné and Jean-Paul Sartre, who were against the ruling. Clouzot&#x27;s sentence was later shortened from life to two years. There is no official document making note of any apology or appeal. During his two-year banishment from filming, Clouzot worked with one of his supporters, Jean-Paul Sartre, who had been one of the first people to defend &quot;Le Corbeau&quot;.

====Return to filmmaking and acclaim (1947–1960)====
After Clouzot&#x27;s ban was lifted, he reestablished his reputation and popularity during the late 1940s with films such as &quot;Quai des Orfèvres&quot; and &quot;Manon&quot;. For &quot;Quai des Orfèvres&quot;, Clouzot asked the author Stanislas-André Steeman for a copy of his novel, &quot;Légitime défense&quot;, to adapt into a film. Clouzot started writing the script before the novel arrived for him to read. &quot;Quai des Orfèvres&quot; was released in 1947 and was the fourth most popular film in France, drawing 5.5 million spectators in that year. Clouzot directed and wrote two films that were released in 1949. For &quot;Manon&quot;, he wanted to cast unknown actors. He scoured schools to find an actress for the lead role, and chose 17-year-old Cécile Aubry after viewing over 700 girls. &quot;Manon&quot; was released in 1948 and was watched by 3.4 million filmgoers in France as well as winning the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. Clouzot directed and wrote the short film &quot;Le Retour de Jean&quot;, which was part of the anthology film &quot;Return to Life&quot;. &quot;Le Retour de Jean&quot; was influenced by the short period when Clouzot lived in Germany in the early 1930s and stars Louis Jouvet as a survivor of a concentration camp who finds a wounded Nazi war criminal whom he interrogates and tortures. Clouzot&#x27;s next film was the comedy &quot;Miquette et Sa Mère&quot;, which was a financial failure. During the film&#x27;s production, Clouzot met Véra Gibson-Amado, whom he married on 15 January 1950. Clouzot and Véra took a film crew with them to Véra&#x27;s homeland in Brazil for their honeymoon, where Clouzot made his first attempt at directing a documentary film. The Brazilian government took issue with Clouzot filming the poverty of people in the favelas rather than the more picturesque parts of Brazil. The film was never finished because the costs became too high. Clouzot became fascinated with the region and wrote a book, &quot;Le cheval des dieux&quot;, recounting his trip.

Upon returning to France, he was offered a script written by Georges Arnaud, an expatriate living in South America who had written about his own experiences there. Clouzot found it easy to imagine the setting of the script and was very anxious to film Arnaud&#x27;s story. He started writing the film, &quot;The Wages of Fear&quot;, with his brother, Jean Clouzot, who would collaborate with him on all his subsequent films under the name of Jérôme Geronimi. Production on &quot;The Wages of Fear&quot; lasted from 1951 to 1952. In order to gain as much independence as possible, Clouzot created his own production company called Véra Films, which he named after his wife. The sole female role in &quot;The Wages of Fear&quot; is played by her. Clouzot wrote the role specifically for his wife, as the character does not exist in the original novel. &quot;The Wages of Fear&quot; is about a South American town where a group of desperate men are offered money to drive trucks carrying nitroglycerin through rough terrain to put out an oil well fire. &quot;The Wages of Fear&quot; was the second most popular film in France in 1953 and was seen by nearly 7 million spectators. It won awards for Best Film and Best Actor (for Charles Vanel) at the Cannes Film Festival. Clouzot&#x27;s next big hit was &quot;Les Diaboliques&quot;, whose screenplay he took away from director Alfred Hitchcock. &quot;Les Diaboliques&quot; involves the story of a cruel headmaster who brutalizes his wife and his mistress. The two women plot to murder him and dump his body in a swimming pool, but when the pool is drained, no corpse is found. In 1954, &quot;Les Diaboliques&quot; won the Louis Delluc Prize and the New York Film Critics Circle Award for best foreign film. In this early and mid-1950s period, with the films &quot;The Wages of Fear&quot; and &quot;Les Diaboliques&quot;, Clouzot came to be fully embraced by international critics and audiences. Both films were screened and reviewed in America as well as in France, and were rated among the best thrillers of the decade. In 1955, Clouzot directed the documentary &quot;The Mystery of Picasso&quot;, about the Spanish painter Pablo Picasso. The film follows Picasso drawing or painting 15 different works, all of which were intentionally destroyed following the film&#x27;s production. Clouzot and Picasso were old acquaintances, having met when Clouzot was 14. &quot;The Mystery of Picasso&quot; won the Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival, but was a financial failure in France, being seen by only 37,000 filmgoers during its initial run in 1956. In 1984, the film was declared a national treasure by the government of France.

Clouzot&#x27;s next feature film was &quot;Les Espions&quot;, which was released in 1957. &quot;Les Espions&quot; featured actors from around the world including Véra Clouzot, Curd Jürgens, Sam Jaffe and Peter Ustinov. &quot;Les Espions&quot; would be the last acting role for Clouzot&#x27;s wife Véra, who had been suffering from severe heart problems since filming &quot;Les Diaboliques&quot;. &quot;Les Espions&quot; is set in a rundown sanitarium that is taken over by international spies. One of the spies claims to have invented a nuclear explosive device which attracts the attention of the Russian and American counterspies. &quot;Les Espions&quot; was not released in the United States and was a financial failure in France. Clouzot later admitted that he only liked the first two-thirds of &quot;Les Espions&quot;. Producer Raoul Levy suggested Clouzot&#x27;s next film should feature Brigitte Bardot as the lead actress. In response, Clouzot wrote the script for &quot;La Vérité&quot;. Bardot plays Dominique Marceau, who is on trial for the murder of her former boyfriend Gilbert Tellier. As her trial progresses, the relationship between Dominique and Gilbert becomes more finely shaped. Bardot later described &quot;La Vérité&quot; as her favorite of all the films she worked on. Released in 1960, &quot;La Vérité&quot; was the second most popular film in France with 5.7 million spectators and was Bardot&#x27;s highest-grossing film. The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

====Later career and failing health (1960–1977)====

Although Clouzot&#x27;s reputation had grown internationally, he lost notability in French cinema due to rise of the French New Wave. The New Wave directors refused to take Clouzot&#x27;s thriller films seriously, and expressed their displeasure publicly through articles and reviews in the film criticism publication, . Clouzot took their criticism to heart, saying in the magazine &quot;Lui&quot; that he didn&#x27;t find his films &quot;Les Diaboliques&quot; and &quot;Miquette et Sa Mère &quot; important or interesting anymore. The next film he worked on was &quot;L&#x27;Enfer&quot;, which was never completed. The film examines the sexual jealousy of a man towards his flirtatious wife, whose psychological state deforms everything with desire. Lead actor Serge Reggiani fell ill one week after shooting began and had to be replaced. Clouzot himself also became ill during production, which led doctors and insurance agents to order the production be stopped. Between 1965 and 1967, Clouzot filmed for French television five documentaries of Herbert von Karajan conducting Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot;, Dvořák&#x27;s &quot;New World&quot; Symphony, Schumann&#x27;s 4th Symphony, Beethoven&#x27;s 5th Symphony and Mozart&#x27;s 5th Violin Concerto. After production finished on the documentaries, Clouzot was able to finance his final picture.

Clouzot&#x27;s return to work reassured the doctors and insurers, and he returned to the film studio to make his final film &quot;La Prisonnière&quot;. The film began production in September 1967 and was halted when Clouzot fell ill and was hospitalized until April 1968. He began filming &quot;La Prisonnière&quot; again in August 1968. Clouzot incorporated stylistic elements of his aborted film &quot;L&#x27;enfer&quot; into &quot;La Prisonnière&quot;. &quot;La Prisonnière&quot; is about a woman who is introduced to a photographer who takes masochistic submissive pictures of young women. The woman volunteers herself as a model for these pictures and is surprised at her own pleasure in the activity. After finishing &quot;La Prisonnière&quot;, Clouzot&#x27;s health grew worse. In the 1970s, he wrote a few more scripts without ever filming them, including a feature about Indochina. He also planned to direct a pornographic film in 1974 for Francis Micheline, but the film was abandoned. Clouzot&#x27;s health grew worse and he required open-heart surgery in November 1976. On 12 January 1977 Clouzot died in his apartment while listening to &quot;The Damnation of Faust&quot;. Clouzot is buried beside Véra in the Montmartre Cemetery.

===Personal life===
In the late-1930s, Clouzot went to a cabaret show featuring entertainers Mistinguett and Suzy Delair at the &quot;Deux Anes&quot; cabaret. Clouzot waited for Delair at the stage door and after meeting her, the two became a romantic couple for the next 12 years. Clouzot had Delair star in two of his films, &quot;The Murderer Lives at Number 21&quot; and &quot;Quai des Orfèvres&quot;. Delair eventually left Clouzot after working with him on &quot;Quai des Orfèvres&quot;.

Clouzot met his first wife Vera Clouzot through actor Léo Lapara, who had minor parts in &quot;Le Retour de Jean&quot; and &quot;Quai des Orfèvres&quot;. Véra met Clouzot after divorcing Lapara and while working as a continuity assistant on Clouzot&#x27;s &quot;Miquette et Sa Mère&quot;. Clouzot named his production company after Véra and had her star in all three films made by the company: &quot;The Wages of Fear&quot;, &quot;Diabolique&quot; and &quot;Les Espions&quot;. Véra also contributed to the script of &quot;La Vérité&quot;. Véra Clouzot died of a heart attack shortly after the filming of &quot;La Vérité&quot;. Clouzot fell into a depression over her death. After her funeral, he moved to Tahiti, but returned to France in December 1960.

Clouzot met his second wife, Inès de Gonzalez, for the first time at a casting call for a film based on Vladimir Nabokov&#x27;s &quot;Laughter in the Dark&quot;. In 1962, Clouzot met de Gonzalez again after she had returned from South America. In December 1963, Clouzot and Inès de Gonzalez married. In the 1960s, Clouzot converted to Roman Catholicism.

==Style==
With the exception of the comedy film &quot;Miquette et sa mère&quot;, every directorial feature of Clouzot involves deception, betrayal and violent deaths. When basing screenplays on written work, Clouzot often changed the stories dramatically, using only key points of the original story. The author Stanislas-André Steeman, whom Clouzot worked with twice, said Clouzot would only &quot;build something after having contemptuously demolished any resemblance to the original, purely for the ambition of effect&quot;. When writing for his own features, Clouzot created characters that were usually corrupt and spineless, with the capacity for both good and evil within them.

Clouzot was very demanding with his actors, and would often quarrel with them to get them in the mood he desired. Suzy Delair recalled that Clouzot slapped her, but said of it, &quot;So what? He slapped others as well...He was tough but I&#x27;m not about to complain&quot;. Pierre Fresnay recalled that Clouzot &quot;worked relentlessly, which made for a juicy spectacle...That&#x27;s to say nothing for his taste of violence, which he never tried with me&quot;. When Clouzot worked with Brigitte Bardot, one scene required her character to drool and sleep. He offered her powerful sleeping pills, saying they were aspirin; this led to her stomach having to be pumped. Although he was harsh on his actors, he did not treat them fiercely off set. Delair recalled that off set there was an &quot;innocence about him&quot; that was not seen.

Clouzot biographer Marc Godin suggested Clouzot&#x27;s life provides clues to understanding his style as a filmmaker. Clouzot was viewed by many of his collaborators as a pessimist, short-tempered, and almost always angry. Brigitte Bardot described Clouzot as &quot;a negative being, forever at odds with himself and the world around him&quot;. His outlook on life is reflected in his own films that focus on the darker side of humanity.

==Legacy==
Despite criticism following the arrival of the French New Wave, career retrospectives of Clouzot&#x27;s work have been positive. Twenty years after his death, film critic Noël Herpe wrote in the French film journal &quot;Positif&quot; that &quot;&quot;Les Diaboliques&quot; (just like &quot;Les Espions&quot; and &quot;La Verite&quot;) reveals a sterile and increasingly exaggerated urge to experiment with the powers of fiction&quot;. Film historian Philipe Pilard wrote, &quot;There is no doubt that if Clouzot had worked for Hollywood and applied the formulas of U.S. studios, today he would be lauded by the very critics who choose to ignore him&quot;. Clouzot today is generally known for his thriller films &quot;The Wages of Fear&quot; and &quot;Diabolique&quot;. Clouzot&#x27;s ability in the genre led to comparisons with Alfred Hitchcock. Clouzot respected Hitchcock&#x27;s work, stating, &quot;I admire him very much and am flattered when anyone compares a film of mine to his&quot;.

Several of Clouzot&#x27;s films have been remade since their original releases. Director Otto Preminger adapted &quot;Le Corbeau&quot; into his 1951 film &quot;The 13th Letter&quot;. In 1977, the year of Clouzot&#x27;s death, William Friedkin directed a remake of &quot;The Wages of Fear&quot; called &quot;Sorcerer&quot;. French director Claude Chabrol adapted Clouzot&#x27;s script for &quot;L&#x27;Enfer&quot; in 1994 for a film likewise titled &quot;L&#x27;Enfer&quot;. In 1996, an American remake of &quot;Les Diaboliques&quot; was released under the title &quot;Diabolique&quot;, starring Sharon Stone.

<text>The Kedermister Library, at Langley near Slough in the English county of Berkshire (formerly Buckinghamshire), is a rare surviving example of an early 17th-century parish library, preserved in situ in the decorated cupboards designed for it in 1620 in the parish church of St Mary the Virgin.

The original vellum catalogue dated in 1638, is still hanging in the library.

Founded around 1613 by Sir John Kedermister (d. 1631), it was established to provide for the education of the rector of St. Mary&#x27;s, and presented to the church in perpetuity by Sir John. A catalogue of the Library listing 307 volumes survives from 1638.

The library and pew still exists and, with the contemporary catalogue, provides insight into scholarship and book collecting in the 17th century.

The library is only open to the public on the first of the month from March to October, and by personal appointment any time of the year.

The Library has two treasures: the &quot;Kedermister Gospels&quot; (an 11th-century illuminated manuscript) which is on permanent loan to the British Library and the &quot;Pharmacopolium or a booke of Medicine&quot; (a manuscript herbal of 1630) which can be seen in the Kedermister Library

Langley, also known as Langley Marish, was formerly in the county of Buckinghamshire, and the Kedermister Library is overseen by Buckinghamshire County Council and governed by a charitable trust.

The name Kedermister is the most commonly used, though some sources, including the charity governing the library, use the spelling Kederminster.

<doc id="379888" wikidata="Q1893126" url="?curid=379888" title="Inbred strain">
<text>Inbred strains (also called inbred lines, or rarely for animals linear animals) are individuals of a particular species which are nearly identical to each other in genotype due to long inbreeding. A strain is inbred when it has undergone at least 20 generations of brother x sister or offspring x parent mating, at which point at least 98.6% of the loci in an individual of the strain will be homozygous, and each individual can be treated effectively as clones. Some inbred strains have been bred for over 150 generations, leaving individuals in the population to be isogenic in nature. Inbred strains of animals are frequently used in laboratories for experiments where for the reproducibility of conclusions all the test animals should be as similar as possible. However, for some experiments, genetic diversity in the test population may be desired. Thus outbred strains of most laboratory animals are also available, where an outbred strain is a strain of an organism that is effectively wildtype in nature, where there is as little inbreeding as possible.

Certain plants including the genetic model organism &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot; naturally self-pollinate, which makes it quite easy to create inbred strains in the laboratory (other plants, including important genetic models such as maize require transfer of pollen from one flower to another).

== In the lab ==

Inbred strains have been extensively used in research. Several Nobel Prizes have been awarded for work that probably could not have been done without inbred strains. This work includes Medawar&#x27;s research on immune tolerance, Kohler and Milstein&#x27;s development of monoclonal antibodies, and Doherty and Zinkernagel&#x27;s studies of the major histocompatibility complex  (MHC).

Isogenic organisms have identical, or near identical genotypes. which is true of inbred strains, since they normally have at least 98.6% similarity by generation 20. This exceedingly high uniformity means that fewer individuals are required to produce results with the same level of statistical significance when an inbred line is used in comparison to an outbred line in the same experiment.

Breeding of inbred strains is often towards specific phenotypes of interest such as behavioural traits like alcohol preference or physical traits like aging, or they can be selected for traits that make them easier to use in experiments like being easy to use in transgenic experiments. One of the key strengths of using inbred strains as a model is that strains are readily available for whatever study one is performing and that there are resources such as the Jackson Laboratory, and FlyBase, where one can look up strains with specific phenotypes or genotypes from among inbred lines, recombinant lines, and coisogenic strains. The embryos of lines that are of little interest currently can be frozen and preserved until there is an interest in their unique genotypical or phenotypical traits.

=== Recombinant inbred lines ===

For the analysis of the linkage of quantitative traits, recombinant lines are useful because of their isogenic nature, because the genetic similarity of individuals allows for the replication of a quantitative trait locus analysis. The replication increases the precision of the results from the mapping experiment, and is required for traits such as aging where minor changes in the environment can influence the longevity of an organism, leading to variation in results.

=== Coisogenic strain ===
One type of inbred strain that either has been altered, or naturally mutated so that it is different at a single locus. Such strains are useful in the analysis of variance within an inbred strain or between inbred strains because any differences would be due to the single genetic change, or to a difference in environmental conditions between two individuals of the same strain.

=== Gal4 lines ===
One of the more specific uses of Drosophila inbred strains is the use of Gal4/UAS lines in research. Gal4/UAS is a driver system, where Gal4 can be expressed in specific tissues under specific conditions based on its location in the Drosophila genome. Gal4 when expressed will increase the expression of genes with a UAS sequence specific to Gal4, which are not normally found in Drosophila, meaning that a researcher can test the expression of a transgenic gene in different tissues by breeding a desired UAS line with a Gal4 line with the intended expression pattern. Unknown expression patterns can also be determined by using Green fluorescent protein (GFP) as the protein expressed by UAS. Drosophila in particular has thousands of Gal4 lines with unique and specific expression patterns, making it possible to test most expression patterns within the organism.

== Effects ==
Inbreeding animals will sometimes lead to genetic drift. The continuous overlaying of like genetics exposes recessive gene patterns that often lead to changes in reproduction performance, fitness, and ability to survive. A decrease in these areas is known as inbreeding depression. A hybrid between two inbred strains can be used to cancel out deleterious recessive genes resulting in an increase in the mentioned areas. This is known as heterosis.

Inbred strains, because they are small populations of homozygous individuals, are susceptible to the fixation of new mutations through genetic drift. Jackson Laboratory, in an information session on the genetic drift in mice, calculated a quick estimate of the rate of mutation based on observed traits to be 1 phenotypic mutation every 1.8 generations, though they caution that this is likely an under-representation because the data they used was for visible phenotypic changes and not phenotype changes inside of mice strains. They further add that statistically every 6-9 generations, a mutation in the coding sequence is fixed, leading to the creation of a new substrain. Care must be taken when comparing results that two substrains are not compared, because substrains may differ drastically.

=== Rats and mice ===
&quot;The period before World War I led to the initiation of inbreeding in rats by Dr Helen King in about 1909 and in mice by Dr C. C. Little in 1909. The latter project led to the development of the DBA strain of mice, now widely distributed as the two major sub-strains DBA/1 and DBA/2, which were separated in 1929-1930. DBA mice were nearly lost in 1918, when the main stocks were wiped out by murine paratyphoid, and only three un-pedigreed mice remained alive. Soon after World War I, inbreeding in mice was started on a much larger scale by Dr L. C. Strong, leading in particular to the development of strains C3H and CBA, and by Dr C. C. Little, leading to the C57 family of strains (C57BL, C57BR and C57L). Many of the most popular strains of mice were developed during the next decade, and some are closely related. Evidence from the uniformity of mitochondrian DNA suggests that most of the common inbred mouse strains were probably derived from a single breeding female about 150–200 years ago.&quot;

&quot;Many of the most widely used inbred strains of rats were also developed during this period, several of them by Curtis and Dunning at the Columbia University Institute for Cancer Research. Strains dating back to this time include F344, M520 and Z61 and later ACI, ACH, A7322 and COP. Tryon&#x27;s classic work on selection for maze-bright and dull rats led to the development of the TMB and TMD inbred strains, and later to the common use of inbred rats by experimental psychologists.&quot;

==== Rats ====
* Wistar as a generic name for inbred strains such as Wistar-Kyoto, developed from the Wistar outbred strains.
* The Rat Genome Database maintains the current list of inbred rat lines and their characteristics.

==== Mice ====
The numerous inbred strains of mice have been mapped extensively. A genealogical chart building on those relationships is actively maintained by the Jackson Laboratory, and can be found on their website.

=== Guinea pigs ===
G. M. Rommel first started conducting inbreeding experiments on guinea pigs in 1906. Strain 2 and 13 guinea pigs, were derived from these experiments and are still in use today. Sewall Wright took over the experiment in 1915. He was faced with the task of analyzing all of the accumulated data produced by Rommel. Wright became seriously interested in constructing a general mathematical theory of inbreeding. By 1920 Wright had developed his method of path coefficients, which he then used to develop his mathematical theory of inbreeding. Wright introduced the inbreeding coefficient &quot;F&quot; as the correlation between uniting gametes in 1922, and most of the subsequent theory of inbreeding has been developed from his work. The definition of the inbreeding coefficient now most widely used is mathematically equivalent to that of Wright.

=== Medaka ===
The Japanese Medaka fish has a high tolerance for inbreeding, one line having been bred brother-sister for as many as 100 generations without evidence of inbreeding depression, providing a ready tool for laboratory research and genetic manipulations. Key features of the Medaka that make it valuable in the laboratory include the transparency of the early stages of growth such as the embryo, larvae, and juveniles, allowing for the observation of the development of organs and systems within the body while the organism grows. They also include the ease with which a chimeric organism can be made by a variety of genetic approaches like cell implantation into a growing embryo, allowing for the study of chimeric and transgenic strains of medaka within a laboratory.

=== Zebrafish ===
Though there are many traits about zebrafish that are worthwhile to study including their regeneration, there are relatively few inbred strains of zebrafish possibly because they experience greater effects from inbreeding depression than mice or Medaka fish, but it is unclear if the effects of inbreeding can be overcome so an isogenic strain can be created for laboratory use.

<doc id="379889" wikidata="Q6512849" url="?curid=379889" title="Lee, London">
<text>Lee, also known as Lee Green, is an area of South East London, England, straddling the border of the London Borough of Lewisham and the Royal Borough of Greenwich. It is located northwest of Eltham and southeast of Lewisham. It was in Kent before becoming part of the County of London in 1889, and then Greater London in 1965.

The churchyard of St Margaret&#x27;s Church (current church rebuilt 1839–41, architect: John Brown) is the burial place of three Astronomers Royal: Edmond Halley, Nathaniel Bliss and John Pond.

==History==
===Early history===

The Manor of Lee was a historic parish of the Blackheath hundred and existed up to 1900 when it was merged with the parish of Lewisham to create the Metropolitan Borough of Lewisham. While modern Lee is centred on Lee railway station and the road of Burnt Ash Hill, the parish was based around Lee High Road which today stretches into the town centre of Lewisham. The River Quaggy formed much of the boundary between the two parishes, though at Lee Bridge (at the western end of Lee High Road) it is now almost completely hidden.

The Lee Manor Society have produced a comprehensive history of the area. The Domesday Book of 1086 describes Lee as a small area of cultivation set in extensive woodland. The earliest map available (Rocque&#x27;s &quot;Country Near Ten Miles Round&quot; map of 1746) shows a cluster of about a dozen houses around a triangular village green. This hamlet was then largely surrounded by fields, with the Wricklemarsh estate of Sir Gregory Page to the north, and a manor house (Lee Place) to the north-west, with St Margaret&#x27;s Church just beyond. Lee Green Farm occupied the south-east quadrant from the 1660s (roughly on the site of the present Leegate shopping centre). The farm was demolished in the 1840s and rebuilt as Tudor House further east.

The Old Tiger&#x27;s Head and the New Tiger&#x27;s Head pubs are important and striking features of the crossroads. Confusingly, the original (Old) Tiger&#x27;s Head is thought to have been built on the site currently occupied by the New Tiger&#x27;s Head. The original pub is thought to have been built before 1730. It was rebuilt on its present site, the north-west quadrant, in 1750–1770 and then rebuilt (in its third incarnation) in 1896 – the date carried on its frontage. It became an important mail and coaching inn. The New Tiger&#x27;s Head started life as a beer shop known as the Tiger Tavern in the 1830s. It was situated in the end of four cottages known as Prospect Terrace, built around the same time. Three of these cottages remain, housing a post office/newsagent and a hairdresser. In 1868 it is referred to as the Tiger&#x27;s Head Inn. The present building is thought to have replaced the original cottage a few years after 1896 – the date of the rebuilding of the Old Tiger&#x27;s Head. The New Tiger&#x27;s Head has now closed down.

===19th century===
In 1815 cavalry and foot regiments passed through Lee Green on their way to the Battle of Waterloo:
:&quot;The space in front of the Tiger&#x27;s Head and the Green were very commodious for the transfer of baggage to the waggons of the farmers from the other side of London to those of the farmers in this neighbourhood which were pressed for that purpose, to convey them 15 miles further on the journey to Dover.&quot;

Lee is where, in 1837, Robert Cocking died in the first parachute accident.

In the early nineteenth century boxing matches took place at the Old Tiger&#x27;s Head. Horse racing and (human) foot racing took place in the 1840s but the police put a stop to these events, probably under pressure from local citizens. At that time the green was the centre of village life with cricket matches, bare knuckle boxing and other entertainments. In the 1850s further housebuilding prompted the installation of proper sewers and the Lee Green horse pond was filled in. In the 1860s John Pound, a developer, erected houses in the south-east quadrant, Orchard Terrace on Eltham Road and Crown Terrace on Burnt Ash Lane (now Road).

The opening of Lee station in 1866 prompted more housebuilding at the crossroads. The site of Lee Green Farm was built on as Carston Mews. In the same year Charles Henry Reed, a linen draper, moves into 1 Orchard Terrace and established a department store. Reed died in 1895 and in 1903 the business was taken over by Griffith &amp; Co.

In the south-west quadrant the Prince Arthur pub was built at 422 Lee High Road in 1870 (closed 2005). It was originally one of a row of early nineteenth-century cottages of which three – nos 424–428 – survived behind modern shop fronts. In 1898 No 345 Lee High Road was built in front of the former Old Tiger&#x27;s Head stables. It incorporated a fire station but the London County Council built a replacement in 1906 in Eltham Road. It is still in use. A police station was built at 418 Lee High Road in 1904, replacing one built before 1860. It was converted to apartments in 2003.

===20th century to now===
In the early 1960s the south-east quadrant, including Carston Mews, was demolished to make way for Leegate shopping centre. This declined following the opening of Sainsbury&#x27;s on the opposite side of Burnt Ash Road in the late 1980s. Owners of the centre, St. Modwen Properties have recently proposed a £40m regeneration plan for the centre, including the demolition of the current shopping precinct to be replaced with an Asda supermarket as well as the conversion of the existing office block into a hotel.

<text>Rosenallis (historically &quot;Rossinallis&quot;, from ) is a village in north County Laois, Ireland. It is in the foothills of the Slieve Bloom Mountains on the R422 Mountmellick to Birr road, 6 km north-west of Mountmellick. The village is in a townland and civil parish of the same name.

==Demographics==
In 2002, the population of the village&#x27;s catchment area was 440 persons, representing an 8.9% increase in population since 1996. The population of the surrounding electoral division increased to 469 by 2011.

==History==
Rosenallis is important in the history of the Quaker movement, with William Edmundson, founder of the Quakers in Ireland, buried just outside the village in the Friends graveyard. In the same graveyard are the remains of Roger Byrne, who was said to have weighed 52 stone and been Ireland&#x27;s heaviest man when he died in March 1804. This claim has, however, been disputed.

In his &quot;Topographical Dictionary of Ireland&quot; (1837), Samuel Lewis described the area:
&quot;In the Slieve Bloom Mountains are quarries of a soft white sandstone, which hardens when exposed to the air, and is susceptible of a high polish; it is in great demand throughout the country for chimney-pieces and hearth-stones; a coarser kind is used for flagging. Another peculiarity of these mountains is the fertility of their northern side, which is interspersed with neat farm-houses and cultivated enclosures to its summit, while its southern side is mostly a heathy waste. Iron ore was formerly raised, but is not now. There is a large tract of bog in this district, affording an abundant supply of fuel. Tillage is more attended to than grazing: there are but few flocks of sheep. The chief crops are potatoes, wheat, barley and oats.&quot;
The village has two churches (Roman Catholic and Church of Ireland) as well as a village primary school, community centre and two pubs, Shellys and Pooles Tavern. The secondary level schools serving the area are Clonaslee and Mountmellick. Every year usually in July the village hosts the &quot;Festival of the Mountain&quot; which is situated in the Festival Field just outside the village.

==Geography==

The River Barrow rises in Glenbarrow, in the parish of Rosenallis.

==Sports==

Rosenallis GAA is the local Gaelic Athletic Association club. Rosenallis AFC is the local soccer club. It plays home games at its grounds, Johnsgrove.

<doc id="379895" wikidata="Q186514" url="?curid=379895" title="Marilyn Horne">
<text>Marilyn Berneice Horne (born January 16, 1934) is an American mezzo-soprano opera singer. She specialized in roles requiring beauty of tone, excellent breath support, and the ability to execute difficult coloratura passages. She is a recipient of the National Medal of Arts and the Kennedy Center Honors, and has won four Grammy Awards.

==Early life==
Marilyn Berneice Horne was born in Bradford, Pennsylvania, one of the four children of Bentz and Berneice Horne. Her parents were both politicians, with her mother serving as city assessor of the Fifth Ward and her father appointed as McKean County assessor. Bentz was also a semi-professional singer and, noticing Marilyn&#x27;s talent, sought to move the family to a place where she could have access to professional vocal training and more opportunities to perform. Along with her older brother Richard and sister Gloria, the family moved to Long Beach, California when Marilyn was 11. Her younger brother, Jay, was born after the move to Long Beach, in 1949.

At age 13, Horne became part of the newly formed Roger Wagner Chorale. She is an alumna of Long Beach Polytechnic High School. As a high school student, she was part of the St. Luke&#x27;s Episcopal Church Choir of Long Beach under the direction of William Ripley Dorr. The choir often worked for the movie studios and recorded with Capitol Records. Marilyn and her sister Gloria were part of the St. Luke&#x27;s Episcopal Church Quartet.

== Education ==

Horne won a scholarship for the University of Southern California where she was a member of Pi Beta Phi sorority. She studied voice under William Vennard and Gwendolyn Koldofsky at the University of Southern California School of Music and participated in Lotte Lehmann&#x27;s vocal master classes at Music Academy of the West.

==Career==

Horne&#x27;s first major professional engagement was in 1954, when she dubbed the singing voice of Dorothy Dandridge in the film &quot;Carmen Jones&quot;. Until that point, she had worked as a background singer for several TV sitcoms, as well as recorded covers of popular songs of the early 1950s, which were sold in dimestores around the country for $1.98. She made an appearance on &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; as a character named &quot;Jackie&quot;, her own nickname, a meek and nervous would-be singer who develops a crush on character Oscar Madison (Jack Klugman) and into a full-blown diva as well, playing the role of Carmen in Felix Unger&#x27;s (Tony Randall) opera group production. She also sang on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; and &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;. She made her Los Angeles debut the same year when she performed the role of Hata in &quot;The Bartered Bride&quot; with the Los Angeles Guild Opera.

Her first major breakthrough came when her singing ability was recognized by Igor Stravinsky; her operatic career began when he invited her to perform in the 1956 Venice festival. She remained in Europe for three seasons singing for the Gelsenkirchen Opera. She was highly acclaimed for her performance as Marie in Alban Berg&#x27;s &quot;Wozzeck&quot; at the inauguration of Gelsenkirchen&#x27;s new opera house on May 22, 1960. In 1960, she returned to the United States to appear in &quot;Wozzeck&quot; at the San Francisco Opera. She debuted in 1961 at Lyric Opera of Chicago where she created the role of Lora in Vittorio Giannini&#x27;s &quot;The Harvest&quot;.

For many years, Horne was associated with the Australian soprano Dame Joan Sutherland in their performances of the bel canto repertoire. They first performed together in a concert version of Vincenzo Bellini&#x27;s &quot;Beatrice di Tenda&quot; at The Town Hall in Manhattan in February 1961. This performance was so successful it was repeated twice at Carnegie Hall. In 1965, they were paired again in a performance of Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Semiramide&quot; with the Opera Company of Boston, and sang in a joint concert on October 15, 1979, which was telecast as &quot;Live from Lincoln Center&quot;.Horne made her debut at the Royal Opera House in October 1964 as Marie in &quot;Wozzeck&quot;. Her La Scala debut was as Jocasta in Stravinsky&#x27;s opéra-oratorio &quot;Œdipus rex&quot; on March 13, 1969. Another of Horne&#x27;s breakthroughs occurred that same year during a performance of Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Le siège de Corinthe&quot; at La Scala, when Horne received a remarkable mid-act seven-minute ovation. Horne made her debut at the Metropolitan Opera in 1970 as Adalgisa in Bellini&#x27;s &quot;Norma&quot; with Sutherland in the title role. She thereafter appeared regularly at the Met, opening the 1972/1973 season as Carmen. A great success there was in Meyerbeer&#x27;s &quot;Le prophète&quot;, in John Dexter&#x27;s production. In 1984, she sang the title role of Handel&#x27;s opera seria &quot;Rinaldo&quot; (directed by Frank Corsaro), the first Handel opera ever performed at the Met.

Although best known for her bel canto and opera seria roles, Horne also sang much American music, both contemporary music by composers such as William Bolcom, and traditional popular songs. She can be heard on the soundtrack of the 1961 film &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot; singing &quot;Love, Look Away&quot; and she sang the role of Lady Thiang on the Philips recording of &quot;The King and I&quot; starring Julie Andrews and Ben Kingsley. She had previously sung in the women&#x27;s chorus for the 1956 film version of &quot;The King and I&quot;.

In 1983, she published (with co-writer Jane Scovell) a candid autobiography, &quot;My Life&quot;, and a continuation volume, &quot;Marilyn Horne: The Song Continues&quot;, appeared in 2004.

On July 5, 1986, she performed on the New York Philharmonic&#x27;s tribute to the 100th anniversary of the Statue of Liberty, which was televised live on ABC Television. The orchestra, conducted by Zubin Mehta, performed in Central Park. She sang an aria from &quot;Carmen&quot; by Georges Bizet.

In January 1993, Horne sang &quot;Make A Rainbow&quot; by American singer and songwriter Portia Nelson, and the Shaker hymn &quot;Simple Gifts&quot; at the inauguration of President Bill Clinton.

=== Retirement ===
Horne retired from the concert stage in 1999 with a recital at the Chicago Symphony Center. She still occasionally performs at pop concerts (especially with late Broadway star Barbara Cook). Horne has also established the Marilyn Horne Foundation to help preserve the art of vocal recitals. She teaches a series of annual Master Classes at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music; the University of Maryland, College Park; the Manhattan School of Music; and the University of Oklahoma.

From 1997 to 2018 Horne directed the Voice Program at the Music Academy of the West in Santa Barbara, California. Since 2018 she holds the position of Honorary Voice Program Director. She is scheduled to teach and remain the head of the jury for the Marilyn Horne Song Competition through 2020.

== Marilyn Horne Museum and Exhibit Center ==
In 2013, Horne donated her personal archives to the University of Pittsburgh. The creation of the Marilyn Horne Museum and Exhibit Center in the Pitt Bradford campus’ Seneca Building (now Marilyn Horne Hall) was partially made possible through a $3 million grant the McKean County Industrial Development Authority received from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania&#x27;s Redevelopment Assistance Capital Program in 2013.

Since opening on May 6, 2017, the museum publicly displays a rotating portion of the collection at the regional campus in Bradford, from which she received an honorary degree in 2004. The museum is open seven days a week and admission is free.

== Personal life ==

Horne was married from 1960 to 1979 (separated 1974) to the conductor Henry Lewis whom she met in college at the University of Southern California. Her mother initially had misgivings that the interracial marriage would have a negative impact on Horne&#x27;s career, saying, &quot;Be his mistress, for God&#x27;s sake, not his wife,&quot; but soon reconciled with them. They maintained a home in the Echo Park neighborhood of Los Angeles for many years. In 1965 the couple welcomed a daughter named Angela. After Horne&#x27;s breakup with Lewis, she began a long-term relationship with Greek bass Nicola Zaccaria.

In December 2005, shortly before Horne&#x27;s 72nd birthday, she was diagnosed with localized pancreatic cancer. In January 2007, she appeared at a public function for her Foundation. Interviewed by Norman Lebrecht on BBC Radio 3 on July 26, 2010, she spoke briefly about her cancer and cheerfully said, &quot;I&#x27;m still here!&quot;

<text>Hammerfest (; ) is a municipality in Finnmark county, Norway. The administrative centre of the municipality being the town of Hammerfest which is considered the northernmost town in the world with more than 5,000 inhabitants (see: Hammerfest). Some of the main villages in the municipality include Rypefjord, Kvalsund, Forsøl, Hønsebybotn, Akkarfjord i Kvaløya, Akkarfjord i Sørøya, and Kårhamn.

The municipality is the 19th largest by area out of the 357 municipalities in Norway. Hammerfest is the 103rd most populous municipality in Norway with a population of 11,338. The municipality&#x27;s population density is and its population has increased by 0% over the previous 10-year period.

The municipality encompasses parts of three large islands: Kvaløya, Sørøya, and Seiland. Other small islands such as Håja, Lille Kamøya and Kamøya are also located here. Most parts of the municipality do not have a road connection with the rest of Norway; only Kvaløya island is connected to the mainland, via the Kvalsund Bridge.

The town of Hammerfest is considered to be one of the northernmost city/towns in the world. For more information, see Hammerfest.

==General information==
A municipality called &quot;Hammerfest by og landdistrikt&quot; (Hammerfest town and district) was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law), which included the town of Hammerfest and the vast rural district surrounding it. The law at that time required that all towns should be separated from their rural districts, but because of low population and very few voters, this was impossible to carry out for Hammerfest in 1838. (This was also the case in the nearby towns of Vadsø and Vardø.) In 1839, the northern part of Hammerfest (population: 498) was separated to become a new Maasø Municipality. This left &quot;Hammerfest by og landdistrikt&quot; with 2,024 residents. On 1 January 1852, the rural district outside of the town (population: 1,256) was separated from the town to form the new Hammerfest landdistrikt Municipality. This left the town of Hammerfest with 1,125 residents. (The rural &quot;Hammerfest landdistrikt&quot; was later divided into two municipalities: Sørøysund Municipality in the north and Kvalsund Municipality in the south.)

On 1 January 1992, Sørøysund Municipality (population: 2,341) was merged with the town of Hammerfest (population: 6,909) to form a new, larger municipality that was called Hammerfest Municipality.

In 2017, the neighboring Hammerfest Municipality and Kvalsund Municipality voted to merge into one large municipality effective 1 January 2020, and that merger came into effect on the planned date. Also on the same day, the new municipality became part of the newly formed Troms og Finnmark county. Previously, it had been part of the old Finnmark county. On 1 January 2024, the Troms og Finnmark county was divided and the municipality once again became part of Finnmark county.

===Name===
The municipality is named after the town of Hammerfest, which was established in 1789. The town was named after an old anchorage. The first element of the name is derived from the local &quot;Hamran&quot; (). &quot;Hamran&quot; were a number of large rocks, good for mooring boats in the local harbour. The name comes from the word which means &quot;stone&quot;, &quot;steep cliff&quot;, or &quot;rock face&quot;. The local &quot;Hamran&quot; were covered up in land reclaiming during the early years after World War II. The last element of the name comes from the word which means &quot;rope&quot; or &quot;fastening&quot; (for boats).
On 1 January 2020 when the neighboring Hammerfest Municipality and Kvalsund Municipality were merged, the new municipality chose two parallel, bilingual, interchangeable names: and . The Sami language name spelling changes depending on how it is used. It is called when it is spelled alone, but it is when using the Sami language equivalent to &quot;Hammerfest Municipality&quot;. Beside the official , there are also two other common variants of the Sámi name: and .

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms was granted on 16 December 1938, in preparation for the celebration of the 150th anniversary of the town&#x27;s establishment in 1939. The official blazon is &quot;Gules, a polar bear statant argent&quot; (). This means the arms have a red field (background) and the charge is a polar bear. The polar bear has a tincture of argent which means it is commonly colored white, but if it is made out of metal, then silver is used. The polar bear was chosen as a symbol for the fishing in the polar seas north of Norway. The polar bear itself is not native to mainland Norway. Because of its town status, the arms often have a mural crown above them. The arms were designed by Ole Valle and the design was updated by Arvid Steen in 2001.

===Churches===
The Church of Norway has three parishes () within the municipality of Hammerfest. It is part of the Hammerfest prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Nord-Hålogaland.

==History==
Many grave sites dating back to the Stone Age can be found here. This location was an important fishing and Arctic hunting settlement for a long time before Hammerfest was given market town rights by royal decree of Christian VII of Denmark–Norway in 1789.

===Destruction in World War II===
After their victory in the Norwegian Campaign of the Second World War, the Germans soon fortified the town of Hammerfest and used it as a major base. The importance of Hammerfest to the Germans increased dramatically after their invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. The occupiers installed three coastal batteries in and around Hammerfest, one with four guns on Melkøya island near the town, one with three 10.5 cm guns on a hill right outside the town and a final battery with casemated pieces on the Rypklubben peninsula near Rypefjord.

The main German U-boat base in Finnmark was in Hammerfest, serving as a central supply base for the vessels attacking the allied supply convoys to Russia. Luftwaffe seaplanes were based at an improvised naval air station in nearby Rypefjord. The garrison in Hammerfest was also protected by around 4,000 mines and numerous anti-aircraft guns.

During their long retreat following the Petsamo-Kirkenes Operation, the Germans no longer managed to transport troops by sea further east due to intensive Red Air Force raids. Thus Hammerfest became their main shipping port in Finnmark in the autumn of 1944.

The town of Hammerfest was bombed twice by the Soviet Air Forces. The first time, on 14 February 1944, the town was hit by explosive and incendiary devices, but little damage was done. On 29 August 1944 Soviet bombers launched a second airstrike, inflicting significantly more damage to buildings and infrastructure in downtown Hammerfest. Two ships were sunk in the harbour. The ships lost were the local transports &quot;Tanahorn&quot; and &quot;Brynilen&quot;.

The population was forcibly evacuated by the occupying German troops in the autumn of 1944 after a Soviet offensive at the northern extremity of the Eastern Front pushed into eastern Finnmark. All of Finnmark including the town was looted and burned to the ground by the Germans when they retreated in 1945, the last of the town having been destroyed by the time the Germans finally left on 10 February 1945. Only the town&#x27;s small funeral chapel, built in 1937, was left standing. The Museum of Reconstruction in Hammerfest tells the story of these events and the recovery of the region. The Soviet troops in eastern Finnmark were withdrawn in September 1945.

Mines and munitions left over from the Second World War were found and destroyed as late as 2008.

==Geography==

The island municipality encompasses parts of the mainland as well as three large islands: Kvaløya, Sørøya, and Seiland. Other small islands such as Lille Kamøya and Kamøya are also located here. The Sørøysundet, Kvalfjorden, and Repparfjorden are all located in the municipality. The Vargsundet strait separates the island Seiland from the mainland. Seiland National Park is partially located in the municipality on the island of Seiland. Seilandsjøkelen and Nordmannsjøkelen are both large glaciers that are located in the park. The Nordefjorden is a fjord that is part of the park. The highest point in the municipality is the tall mountain Seilandstuva. Komagaksla and Hammaren are both mountains located in Hammerfest Municipality.

Hasvik Municipality lies to the west, Alta Municipality lies to the southwest, Porsanger Municipality lies to the southeast, and Måsøy Municipality lies to the northeast. The Barents Sea lies to the north.

===Climate===
Hammerfest has a ocean-moderated subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfc&quot;, Trewartha &quot;Eolo&quot;). In spite of the extreme northern location, there is no permafrost, as the mean annual temperature is approximately , about the same as Anchorage, Alaska, which is located at a latitude of 61° North. Hammerfest often experiences heavy snowfall in winter, and on some occasions, avalanches or risk of avalanches have forced some inhabitants to be evacuated from their exposed homes until the danger was over.

The &quot;midnight sun&quot; is above the horizon from 14 May to 31 July (79 days), and the period with continuous daylight lasts a bit longer, conversely the polar night lasts from 23 November to 19 January (59 days). The weather data is from Hammerfest Airport about 80 m elevation and 2 km from the town. Hammerfest town is at sea level, thus the town itself might be slightly warmer.

===Reindeer problems===

During the summer, massive reindeer herds migrate from their winter pastures in the inner parts of Finnmark to the coast. Among the islands inhabited by reindeer during the summer months is Kvaløya, the island on which Hammerfest town is located. For years many of the 2,500 to 3,000 reindeer in the area have been coming into the town itself, wandering in the streets and among the houses. Although popular with tourists, this has been less favourably received by the town&#x27;s population, with people complaining of traffic disturbances and the dung and urine left by the animals. For hygienic reasons large sums of money have to be spent every year to clean up after the animals. In response to the complaints the town authorities built a , fence encircling the town to keep the animals out. However, as of the 2008 reindeer season, the fence had proven ineffective, with reindeer managing to pass through on road crossings, despite the presence of electrified grates embedded in the ground. The problem continues – the mayor, Alf E. Jakobsen, joked during the local election in 2011 that he was contemplating a career as a reindeer herder if he lost the vote.

==Economy and tourism==

The construction of the large liquefied natural gas site on Melkøya (island) just off Hammerfest, which will process natural gas from Snøhvit, is the most expensive construction project in the history of Northern Norway. This project has resulted in an economic boom and new optimism in Hammerfest in recent years, a stark contrast to the economic downhill and negative population growth most other municipalities in Finnmark are experiencing. After the opening of natural gas production on Melkøya there have been some problems with significant smoke and soot pollution in the initial production phases. Snøhvit is Europe&#x27;s first export facility for liquefied natural gas.
Hammerfest offers sport and commercial fishing, both sea and freshwater, as well as scuba diving. The northernmost glacier on the Norwegian mainland is a hiking destination. The town is a starting point for northern tours. There is a daily boat to the North Cape (). One chain of the Struve Geodetic Arc, now on the World Heritage List, is located at Fuglenes in Hammerfest.

Hammerfest is also a centre of Sami culture. Hammerfest is home to the Royal and Ancient Polar Bear Society (); a museum displaying the history of Arctic hunting.

The newspaper &quot;Hammerfestingen&quot; is published in Hammerfest.

American author Bill Bryson begins his European travels in 1990, documented in his book &quot;Neither Here Nor There&quot;, with a visit to Hammerfest in order to see the Northern Lights, calling it &quot;an agreeable enough town in a thank-you-God-for-not-making-me-live-here sort of way&quot;.

==Transportation==
Hammerfest is connected to the main road network by Norwegian national road 94 which branches off from European route E6 at Skaidi in the neighbouring municipality of Kvalsund. The town is a port of call for the Hurtigruten ship route. Hammerfest also has Finnmark&#x27;s third largest airport, Hammerfest Airport, opened 30 July 1974. Before the opening of the airport, the only air link to Hammerfest was by seaplane, the first route established in 1936.

<text>Nathaniel Bliss (28 November 1700 – 2 September 1764) was an English astronomer of the 18th century, serving as Britain&#x27;s fourth Astronomer Royal between 1762 and 1764.

Bliss studied at Oxford University and later became the Savilian Professor of Geometry. He made important meridian observations of a comet and a solar eclipse visible from Greenwich, and many of his observations proved useful in solving the longitude problem, and were bought by the Board of Longitude after his death.

==Life==
Nathaniel Bliss was born in the Cotswolds village of Bisley in Gloucestershire. His father, also named Nathaniel Bliss, was a clothier. Bliss studied at Pembroke College, Oxford. He graduated B.A. in 1720 and M.A. in 1723, and married shortly afterwards.

In 1736, Bliss became rector of St Ebbe&#x27;s Church in Oxford. Supported by, among others; the 2nd Earl of Macclesfield (George Parker), Savilian Professor of Astronomy James Bradley and by William Jones, Bliss succeeded Edmond Halley as Savilian Professor of Geometry at Oxford University in February 1742 – being elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in May the same year. As Savilian Professor he lectured courses in arithmetic, algebra, plane and spherical geometry, the use of logarithms and surveying instruments.

In 1762 he succeeded Bradley to become the fourth Astronomer Royal, but held the post for only two years before his unexpected death.
He died in Oxford, but was buried close to Edmond Halley in St Margaret&#x27;s churchyard in Lee in south-east London. As men of independent means, the first four Astronomers Royal including Bliss, were paid only a minimal salary. This situation changed when Nevil Maskelyne succeeded Bliss as Astronomer Royal upon his death – Maskelyne commanded a salary of £350 per annum, permitting him to make the post his main occupation. In 2000 the International Astronomical Union named a crater on the Moon after Bliss, in commemoration of his position as Astronomer Royal.

==Observations==
George Parker, the Earl of Macclesfield, had established an observatory at Shirburn Castle in Oxfordshire. Working for and with the Earl of Macclesfield, Bliss made meridian observations of a comet approaching the Sun in 1744 at Shirburn Castle and at Greenwich. Bliss worked alongside James Bradley at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich and in June 1761, owing to the poor health of Bradley, he undertook the observations for the transit of Venus.

His assistant at the Royal Observatory was Charles Green, and upon his death, Green continued Bliss&#x27; work until the appointment of the next Astronomer Royal. In April 1764 Bliss made observations of an annular (solar) eclipse visible from Greenwich. Many of the observations made by Bliss were considered potentially useful for solving the longitude problem, important for cartography and ocean navigation, and were therefore bought by the Board of Longitude from his widow Elizabeth Bliss (née Hillman). His Greenwich observations were not published until 1805 when they were included as a supplement in an edition by Thomas Hornsby on the observations of Bradley.

<text>Fo Tan () is an area of Sha Tin District, New Territories, Hong Kong. It was developed as a light industrial area, but this activity has declined markedly in recent years. There are residential areas to the east, alongside the MTR line, and in the foothills to the west.
==Etymology==
Fo Tan is located around a river, the Fo Tan Nullah. Historically, a beach was revealed when the water receded. The area thus became known as &quot;river beach&quot; (). In Hakka, this was pronounced &quot;Fo Tan&quot;. It was later mistakenly called &quot;Fire Beach&quot; () due to similarities in pronunciation. This has further changed into &quot;Fire Charcoal&quot; () which is in current use, again due to similarities in pronunciation.

==Location==
North East South West To the south is Sha Tin New Town, with the small community of Wo Che in between. To the north is Kau To and the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). Nearby to the east is Sha Tin Racecourse while across the Shing Mun River is City One Shatin.

==Artistic community==
Since 2001, as most industrial businesses have closed and moved to mainland China, more than 70 units in the utilitarian industrial blocks have reopened as artists&#x27; studios, creating a vibrant if well hidden local arts scene. Every January, a festival, Fotanian - Open Studio Programme, sees many of the studios open to the public. Guided walks lead visitors to these normally private working studios, which encompass a wide range of media and styles such as ceramic and floral design. Fo Tan was chosen for artist spaces because the ceilings of the buildings are high and because it is in the middle of the New Territories.

<doc id="379910" wikidata="Q599921" url="?curid=379910" title="Wood thrush">
<text>The wood thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) is a North American passerine bird in the family Turdidae and is the only species placed in the genus Hylocichla. It is closely related to other thrushes such as the American robin and is widely distributed across North America, wintering in Central America and southern Mexico. The wood thrush is the official bird of the District of Columbia.

The wood thrush is a medium-sized thrush, with brown upper parts with mottled brown and white underparts. The male and female are similar in appearance. The song of the male is often cited as being the most beautiful in North America.

The wood thrush is an omnivore, and feeds preferentially on soil invertebrates and larvae, but will also eat fruits. In the summer, it feeds on insects continuously in order to meet daily metabolic needs. It is solitary, but sometimes forms mixed-species flocks. The wood thrush defends a territory that ranges in size from . The wood thrush is monogamous, and its breeding season begins in the spring; about 50% of all mated pairs are able to raise two broods, ranging in size from two to four chicks.

==Taxonomy==
The wood thrush was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the thrushes in the genus &quot;Turdus&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Turdus mustelinus&quot;. Gmelin based his account on the &quot;Tawny thrush&quot; that had been described in 1785 by the Welsh naturalist Thomas Pennant in his book &quot;Arctic Zoology&quot;. Pennant specified its type locality as the New York (state) region. The wood thrush is now the only species placed in the genus &quot;Hylocichla&quot; that was introduced in 1864 by the American naturalist S.F. Baird. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised. The generic name is a translation of its common name, derived from the Greek words (&quot;hyle&quot;, &quot;woodland&quot;) and (&quot;cichle&quot;, &quot;thrush&quot; or &quot;fieldfare&quot;). The species name comes from the Latin &quot;mustela&quot; &quot;weasel&quot;.

This thrush is closely related to the other typical American thrushes of the genus &quot;Catharus&quot;, and is sometimes merged into that genus. It has been considered close to the long-distance migrant species of that genus, as opposed to the generally resident nightingale-thrushes, but that appears to be an error. The wood thrush also appears to be fairly closely related to the large &quot;Turdus&quot; thrushes, such as the American robin. &quot;Wood thrush&quot; is the official common name given to the species by the International Ornithologists&#x27; Union (IOC).

==Description==
The adult wood thrush is long, with a wingspan of and a body mass of . Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the bill is and the tarsus is . It is distinctly larger than the &quot;Catharus&quot; thrushes with which the species is often sympatric but slightly smaller than the common American robin. The longest known lifespan for a wood thrush in the wild is 8 years, 11 months. The crown, nape, and upper back are cinnamon-brown, while the back wings, and tail are a slightly duller brown. The breast and belly are white with large dark brown spots on the breast, sides, and flanks. It has white eye rings and pink legs. Other brownish thrushes have finer spotting on the breast. The juvenile looks similar to adults, but has additional spots on the back, neck, and wing coverts. The male and female are similar in size and plumage.

===Vocalization===
The wood thrush has been reported to have one of the most beautiful songs of North American birds. American naturalist Henry David Thoreau wrote:

Whenever a man hears it he is young, and Nature is in her spring; wherever he hears it, it is a new world and a free country, and the gates of Heaven are not shut against him.

While the female is not known to sing, the male has a unique song that has three parts. The first subsong component is often inaudible unless the listener is close, and consists of two to six short, low-pitched notes such as &quot;bup, bup, bup.&quot; The middle part is a loud phrase often written &quot;ee-oh-lay,&quot; and the third part is a ventriloquial, trill-like phrase of non-harmonic pairs of notes given rapidly and simultaneously.

The male is able to sing two notes at once, which gives its song an ethereal, flute-like quality. Each individual bird has its own repertoire based on combinations of variations of the three parts. Songs are often repeated in order. The &quot;bup, bup, bup&quot; phrase is also sometimes used as a call, which is louder and at a greater frequency when the bird is agitated. The wood thrush also use a &quot;tut, tut&quot; to signal agitation. The nocturnal flight call is an emphatic buzzing &quot;heeh.&quot;

==Distribution and habitat==
The wood thrush&#x27;s breeding range extends from Manitoba, Ontario and Nova Scotia in southern Canada to northern Florida and from the Atlantic coast to the Missouri River and the eastern Great Plains. It migrates to southern Mexico through to Panama in Central America in the winter, mostly in the lowlands along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. It generally arrives on the U.S. Gulf Coast during the first week of April. Fall migration usually begins in mid-August and continues through mid-September. Migration takes place at night, allowing them to find their direction from the stars and orient themselves by detecting the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field.

The wood thrush prefers deciduous and mixed forests for breeding. It prefers late-successional, upland mesic forests with a moderately-dense shrub layer. It favors areas with running water, moist ground, and high understorey cover. The breeding habitat generally includes trees taller than , a fairly open forest floor, moist soil, and leaf litter, with substrate moisture more important than either canopy cover or access to running water. The wood thrush can breed in habitat patches as small as , but it runs the risk of higher predation and nest parasitism. The wood thrush&#x27;s breeding range has expanded northward, displacing the veery and hermit thrush in some locations. In recent times, as a result of fragmentation of forests, it has been increasingly exposed to
nest parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds, as well as loss of habitat in the winter range.

===Conservation status===
The wood thrush has become a symbol of the decline of Neotropical songbirds of eastern North America, having declined by approximately 50% since 1966. Along with many other species, this thrush faces threats both to its North American breeding grounds and Central American wintering grounds. Forest fragmentation in North American forests has resulted in both increased nest predation and increased cowbird parasitism, significantly reducing their reproductive success. A study by the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology was the first large-scale analysis that linked acid rain to this thrush&#x27;s decline. Continued destruction of primary forest in Central America eliminated preferred wood thrush wintering habitats, likely forcing the birds to choose secondary habitats where mortality rates are higher. In spite of this, the wood thrush is considered to be Least Concern.

===Vagrancy===
The wood thrush has been recorded twice as a vagrant in Europe, in Iceland at Kvísker in Öræfi East Skaftafellssýsla by Björnsson Hálfdán on 23 October 1967 and on Wingletang Down, St Agnes, Isles of Scilly, England on 7 October 1987.

==Behavior==

The wood thrush is primarily solitary, but occasionally forms mixed-species flocks in the winter. Its breeding territory ranges from in size, and are used for nesting, gathering nest materials, and foraging. Some wood thrushes also defend a feeding territory in the winter. Territorial interactions are usually settled without physical contact, but in high-intensity encounters or nest defense, physical interactions with the feet or bill have been observed. Defense behaviors in response to nest predators include wing flicks, tail flicks, and raising the crest, sometimes escalating to dives and strikes.

This species has also been observed displaying a behavior known as &quot;anting.&quot; Anting occurs when a bird picks up a single ant or group of ants and rubs them on its feathers. The purpose of this behavior is unknown, but it is thought that the birds may be able to acquire defensive secretions from the ants possibly used for some medicinal purposes, or that it simply supplements the birds&#x27; own preen oil.

===Diet===
Soil invertebrates and larvae make up most of the wood thrush&#x27;s omnivorous diet, but it will also eat fruits in the late summer, fall, and late winter. It occasionally feeds on arboreal insects, snails, and small salamanders. The young are fed insects and some fruit. After breeding and before migration, the wood thrush will switch from insects to fruits with high lipid levels. In the summer, low fruit consumption and lipid reserves require the bird to feed on insects continuously in order to meet its metabolic needs.

The wood thrush forages mainly on the forest floor, flipping leaves over with its bills to reveal insects. It can be observed hopping around in leaf litter and on semi-bare ground under the forest canopy. Fruits are swallowed whole.

===Predation===
Eggs and chicks are vulnerable to chipmunks, raccoons, blue jays, American crows, black rat snakes, brown-headed cowbirds, common grackles, southern flying squirrels, gray squirrels, least weasels, white-footed mice, domestic cats, great horned owls, and sharp-shinned hawks. Adults are primarily taken by hawks and owls.

===Reproduction===

Wood thrushes are monogamous. Breeding pairs form in mid-April to early-May, and usually last throughout the breeding season. Most thrushes find a new mate each year, and mate guarding and extra-pair copulations have not been observed in this species.

Some male wood thrushes arrive at the breeding grounds several days before the earliest females while other males arrive at the same time as the females, establishing territories ranging in size from 0.08 to 0.8 hectares (one-fifth of an acre to two acres). The female typically leads silent circular flights from the ground, with the male chasing. Six or more flights generally take place in succession. The pairs will perch together and feed each other in between flights. The male begins to sing at dawn and dusk a few days after arriving at breeding grounds. Early in the breeding season, the male sings from high perches in the tallest trees, but as the season progresses, it sings somewhat shorter and less elaborate songs from lower perches. Each day&#x27;s singing begins and is most intense just before sunrise. The male may sing throughout the day but especially at dusk. The song season is usually over by the end of July.

Typically, the female chooses the nest site and builds the nest. However, there has been some indication that the male is able to influence the selection of the nest site by perching nearby and singing. Usually, though, the female chooses whether or not to accept or reject the nest site suggested by the male. The nest is usually sited in a dense patch of vegetation in a tree or shrub that provides concealment and shade. It is usually made of dead grasses, stems, and leaves, and lined with mud, and placed in a fork at a horizontal branch. The nest is not reused. Usually, two broods are attempted, although three to four separate nests may be built before a pair succeeds. Two to four pale blue eggs are laid at the rate of one per day. The eggs are incubated by the female only for 11 to 14 days, with the average being 13 days. Like all passerines, the chicks are altricial at hatching, mostly naked with closed eyes. The female broods the chicks during the first four days after hatching. Both parents feed the nestlings and remove fecal sacs from the nest. The chicks fledge 12–15 days after hatching, but the parents continue to feed them until they become independent and leave the parents&#x27; territory at 21–31 days old.

The young wood thrush is able to begin breeding the next summer. Most females lay their first eggs in mid-May, but older females may begin laying sooner. Pairs usually attempt to rear a second brood no later than late July, with the last of the young fledging around mid-August. About half of all wood thrush pairs successfully raise two broods.

<text>Burmeister&#x27;s porpoise (Phocoena spinipinnis) is a species of porpoise endemic to the coast of South America. It was first described by Hermann Burmeister, for whom the species is named, in 1865.

==Population and distribution==
While Burmeister&#x27;s porpoise seems to be relatively common in its range, little work has been done to survey the species. The total population is at least in the tens of thousands. Its range appears to be continuous in coastal waters from northern Peru in the Pacific Ocean round Tierra del Fuego and up to southern Brazil in the Atlantic Ocean. Burmeister&#x27;s porpoises frequent inshore bays, channels, and fjords, but individuals have been spotted as far as from the shore and in the freshwater Valdivia River in southern Chile. Though normally found in continental shelf waters, they have been found as deep as 

==Description==
Most photographs of Burmeister&#x27;s porpoises are taken of dead specimens and show the animal to be coloured black. This phenomenon gave rise to the earlier common name, black porpoise. However live individuals are typically a dark grey color. They turn black in just a few minutes after death. The underside varies in colour but is usually a lighter grey. Burmeister&#x27;s are about long when fully mature and weigh . The maximum recorded weight is that of a female at . They have a shallow indentation at their blowhole set just in front of the eyes. The shape and placement of the dorsal fin is unusual for a cetacean—it is triangular rather than curved and points backwards more than upwards. It is located about three quarters of the way along the back—further back than any other dolphin or porpoise. These features are sufficient to distinguish the porpoise from the similar-sized Chilean dolphin which is found in the porpoise&#x27;s Pacific range.

==Behaviour==
Burmeister&#x27;s porpoise is difficult to observe. It appears to be shy, shows little of its body when surfacing and will move quickly away from approaching boats. They are typically seen alone or in pairs with occasional larger groups. One report from Chile saw a group of 70 in number. The porpoise feeds on various pelagic fish such as anchovies, hake and mackerel.

==Conservation==
Like all porpoises, Burmeister&#x27;s is vulnerable to accidental capture in fishing nets. This is common in Uruguay, Peru and Chile. The annual estimated catch is largest in Peru, at 2000 individuals. In Peruvian waters, Burmeister&#x27;s porpoise caught as bycatch are primarily used for human consumption. Until the late 1990s, Burmeister&#x27;s were also harpooned deliberately for food and for use as crab bait.

In severe El Nino events, the ecosystem of the Humboldt current is disrupted. Anchovies either perish or leave the area, and it appears that many porpoises and other marine mammals, including the Burmeister&#x27;s porpoise,  must find other food sources or starve as a result. In 1997, during an El Nino event, Burmeister&#x27;s porpoises were found stranded on Peruvian beaches.

The IUCN lists the animal as Near Threatened in its Red List of Threatened Species. The long-term prognosis for the species is unknown.

Burmeister&#x27;s porpoise is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). It is listed on Appendix II as it has an unfavourable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international co-operation organised by tailored agreements.

<text>Mina Loy (born Mina Gertrude Löwy; 27 December 1882 – 25 September 1966) was a British-born artist, writer, poet, playwright, novelist, painter, designer of lamps, and bohemian. She was one of the last of the first-generation modernists to achieve posthumous recognition. Her poetry was admired by T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, William Carlos Williams, Basil Bunting, Gertrude Stein, Francis Picabia, and Yvor Winters, among others.

== Biography ==

=== Early life and education ===
Loy was born in Hampstead, London. She was the daughter of a Hungarian Jewish tailor, Sigmund Felix Löwy, who had moved to London to evade persistent antisemitism in Budapest, and an English Protestant mother, Julia Bryan. Loy reflected on their relationship, and the production of her identity, in great detail in her mock-epic &quot;Anglo-Mongrels and the Rose&quot; (1923–1925). The marriage of Löwy and Bryan was fraught. Unknown to Loy, as biographer Carolyn Burke records, her mother married her father under the pressure of disgrace as she was already seven months pregnant with the child that would be Mina; this situation was mirrored later in Loy&#x27;s life when she rushed into a marriage with Stephen Haweis after becoming pregnant out of wedlock. Löwy and Bryan had three daughters in total, with Mina being the oldest.

In much of her poetry and writing, Loy describes her mother as overbearingly Evangelical Victorian. As Burke records: &quot;Like most Evangelicals, for whom the imagination was a source of sin, Julia distrusted her child&#x27;s ability to invent.&quot; In reference to her mother, Loy recalled that she was troubled by the fact of &quot;the very author of my being, being author of my fear.&quot; Loy found it hard to identify with her mother, who not only punished her continually for her &quot;sinfulness,&quot; but also espoused fervent support of the British Empire, rampant antisemitism (which included her husband), and nationalistic jingoism.

Loy&#x27;s formal art education began late in 1897 at St. John&#x27;s Wood School where she remained for about two years. She later called it &quot;the worst art school in London&quot; and &quot;a haven of disappointment&quot;. Loy&#x27;s father pushed for her to go to the art school in the hope that it would make her more marriageable. Around this time, Loy became fascinated with both Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Christina Rossetti, and after much convincing was able to persuade her father to purchase her Dante&#x27;s &quot;Complete Works&quot; and reproductions of his paintings as well as a red Moroccan leather-bound version of Christina&#x27;s poems. She also became passionate about the Pre-Raphaelites, beginning with the work of William Morris and later turning to Edward Burne-Jones (her favourite work of which, at the time, was &quot;Love Among the Ruins&quot;). Loy had to be careful as to how she expressed herself due to her mother&#x27;s control. For example, Loy described that when her mother found a drawing she had done of the naked Andromeda bound to a rock her mother, scandalised and disgusted, tore up the work and called her daughter &quot;a vicious slut&quot;.

=== Studies in Germany and Paris ===
In 1900 Loy attended the Munich &quot;Künstlerinnenverein&quot;, or the Society of Female Artists&#x27; School, which was connected with the fine art school of Munich University, it was there that she claimed she learned draughtsmanship.

Upon returning from the relative freedom she found in Munich to the stifling environment of her family home in London, Loy suffered from &quot;headaches, respiratory problems, and generalized weakness&quot; which was then diagnosed as neurasthenia – &quot;a catch-all term for a variety of psychosomatic complaints suffered by artistic or intellectual women and a few sensitive men&quot; during that time period.

Around the age of eighteen, Loy convinced her parents to allow her to continue her education in Paris with a chaperone – a woman called Mrs. Knight. After much persuasion, she was allowed to move to Montparnasse, which in 1902 had not yet been urbanised, and attend the Académie Colarossi as an art student. Unlike the segregated classes at the Munich &quot;Künstlerinnenverein&quot;, these art classes were mixed. It was here, through an English friend of a similar social standing named Madeline Boles, that Loy first came into contact with the English painter Stephen Haweis who Loy later described as enacting the &quot;parasitic drawing-out of one&#x27;s vitality to recharge, as it were, his own deficient battery of life.&quot; According to Burke&#x27;s biography, Haweis was unpopular with his fellow students, being considered a &quot;poseur,&quot; and Boles in particular took him under her wing. Haweis, whose father was the well-known Reverend Hugh Reginald Haweis and his mother Mary Eliza Haweis, a writer who wrote, amongst other things, &quot;Chaucer for Children&quot;: &quot;A Golden Key&quot;, was an aesthete of sorts and &quot;despite being very short[,] he managed to condescend to his listeners from a height.&quot; He began to exert himself over Loy, recognising her beauty and desirability, and played the role of the misunderstood eccentric which led Loy to feel guilty for disliking him and distrusting him as he borrowed more and more money from her without paying her back. Later she would reflect that Haweis loomed over her and she became, in Loy&#x27;s own words, &quot;as sullenly involved as with my mother&#x27;s sadistic hysterics.&quot; One night he convinced her to stay over and, in what she would later describe as a state of hypnosis, she was seduced by him. Waking up next morning in his bed, semi-naked, Loy was horrified and repulsed.

A few months after this, she realised that she was pregnant, something which terrified her as it bound her, as she later described, even closer to &quot;the being on earth whom she would have least chosen.&quot; Being only twenty-one, she faced a difficult situation and, fearing rejection from her family and disinheritance, which would leave her penniless, she sought her parents&#x27; approval to marry Haweis, which they agreed to due to his respectable social status as the son of a preacher. Reflecting on this in later life, and how her upbringing influenced her in the decisions she made, Loy remarked that &quot;If anyone I disliked insisted upon my doing anything I was averse to I would automatically comply, so systematically had they obfuscated my instinct of self-preservation.&quot;

=== Paris, 1903–1906 ===
Relocating to Paris, Haweis and Loy married there, in the 14th Arrondissement, on 13 December 1903 – Loy was twenty-one, and four months pregnant. Initially they agreed that it would be just a marriage of convenience, but Stephen became quickly more possessive and demanding. Instead of taking her husband&#x27;s name, after their marriage she changed her last name from &quot;Lowy&quot; to &quot;Loy.&quot; &quot;Becoming Modern: The Life of Mina Loy&quot; (1996) biographer Carolyn Burke notes that &quot;[t]he anagrammatic shifts of Lowy into Loy and later Lloyd symbolize her attempts to resolve personal crises and chooses to refer to Loy as Mina – the name that stayed fixed as her surname varied.&quot;

Starting in 1903 until 1904, after meeting the Englishman Henry Coles, Haweis began selling &quot;photographies d&#x27;art&quot;, or fine art photography pieces, influenced by Art Nouveau style. The most notable commission of this time was the photographing of the recent works of Auguste Rodin which came about after Haweis met with Rodin himself. At that time, Loy was Haweis&#x27;s favourite subject to photograph; this is something which Loy never commented on. As Haweis gained more contacts and work, Loy became increasingly isolated and heavily pregnant.

Loy&#x27;s first child, Oda, was born on 27 May 1903. The labour was hard, as recalled in the early poem &quot;Parturition&quot; (first published in &quot;The Trend&quot; 8:1, October 1914). The opening details:

&lt;poem&gt;I am the centre
Of a circle of pain
Exceeding its boundaries in every direction
The business of the bland sun
Has no affair with me
In my congested cosmos of agony
From which there is no escape [...]&lt;/poem&gt;

Whilst Loy was in labour through the night, Haweis was absent with his mistress. Loy records this in &quot;Parturition&quot; thus:

&lt;poem&gt;The irresponsibility of the male
Leaves woman her superior Inferiority.
He is running upstairs&lt;/poem&gt;

Two days after her first birthday, Oda died of meningitis and Loy was left completely bereft with grief over the loss. A day or so after Oda&#x27;s death Loy reportedly painted a (now lost) tempera painting &quot;The Wooden Mother&quot; in which she depicted two mothers with their children, one being a &quot;foolish-looking mother holding her baby, whose small fingers are raised in an impotent blessing over the other anguished mother who, on her knees, curses them both with great, upraised, clenched fists, and her own baby sprawling dead with little arms and legs outstretched lifeless.&quot;

Loy decided to enter the Salon d&#x27;Automne under the name &quot;Mina Loy&quot; (having dropped the &quot;w&quot; in Lowy) in 1905. That autumn she exhibited six watercolours and the following spring she exhibited two watercolours at the Salon des Beaux-Art of 1906. After the latter exhibition, Loy was written of favourably in the &quot;Gazette des Beaux-Arts&quot;:Mlle Mina Loy who, in her uncommon watercolours where Guys, Rops and Beardsley are combined shows us ambiguous ephebes whose nudity is caressed by ladies dressed in furbelows of 1855.After this positive reception Loy was asked to become a &quot;sociétaire&quot; of the drawing category, which meant that her work could be exhibited without having to pass through a selection committee. This was a &quot;vote of confidence&quot; which, as biographer Burke recognises, &quot;was an exceptional mark of recognition for an unknown Englishwoman of twenty-three&quot;.

By 1906 Loy and Haweis had agreed to live separately. During this period of separation Loy was treated by a French doctor named Henry Joël le Savoureux for neurasthenia, which had worsened with the death of Oda and living with Haweis, and the pair embarked on an affair which would end with her becoming pregnant. This made Haweis jealous and precipitated their move to Florence, where there were fewer people who knew them.

=== Florence, 1906–1916 ===
At first, Loy and Haweis moved into a &quot;villino&quot; located in Arcetri, finding themselves in a large expatriate community. In the Spring of 1907 Haweis found a studio on the Costa San Giorgio in Oltrarno.

On 20 July 1907, Loy gave birth to Joella Sinara. A few months before Joella&#x27;s first birthday Loy was pregnant again, this time with the child of Haweis, and she was to give birth to a son named John Stephen Giles Musgrove Haweis on 1 February 1909.

Joella was late learning to walk, which was later diagnosed as a type of infantile paralysis which caused her muscles to atrophy. Dreading that Joella&#x27;s condition might be like the meningitis that killed Oda, Loy sought medical and spiritual support. This was one of her earliest, critical encounters with Christian Science as she sought out a practitioner, who prescribed a treatment and told Loy to feed Joella beef broth and donkey&#x27;s milk. After this succeeded in improving Joella&#x27;s health, Loy began to attend church regularly.

Around 1909, with the financial support of Loy&#x27;s father, Loy and Haweis moved into a three-storey home on the Costa San Giorgio. The family had a nurse, Giulia, who helped raise the children and would later spend years being the children&#x27;s sole support, and her sister Estere, who was the family cook. Once the children were toddlers, Loy spent increasingly less time with them and they were often cared for in the cooler climate of the mountains and Forte de Marmi in the summers. Burke speculates that this may have been a reaction to the overbearing intrusion of her own mother which led her to withdraw.

Loy frequented the social gatherings held by socialite Mabel Dodge Luhan at the Villa Curonia and it was here that she met Gertrude Stein, her brother Leo Stein, and Alice B. Toklas. Loy was drawn to Gertrude and even got the opportunity to dine with her, Dodge, and Andre Gide. Gertrude would later recall that Loy, as well as Haweis, were amongst the few at that time who expressed serious interest in her work (she had not yet been widely recognised for her literary achievement). However, Gertrude recalls an incident where Haweis begged her to add two commas in exchange for a painting, which she did, but then later removed them; contrarily, Gertrude noted that &quot;Mina Loy equally interested was able to understand without the commas. She has always been able to understand.&quot;

In daughter Joella (née Sinara) Bayer&#x27;s memoir, now part of the Mina Loy Estate, she reflected on her parents, saying: My mother, tall, willowy, extraordinarily beautiful, very talented, undisciplined, a free spirit, with the beginning of too strong an ego; my father, short, dark, a mediocre painter, bad tempered, with charming social manners and endless conversation about the importance of his family.According to Gillian Hanscombe and Virginia L. Smyers:During their ten years in Florence, both Mina and Haweis took lovers and developed their separate lives. In 1913 and 1914, though she was coping with motherhood, a soured marriage, lovers, and her own artistic aspirations, Mina found time to notice and take part in the emerging Italian Futurist movement, led by Filippo Marinetti, whom Loy had a brief affair with, and to read Stein&#x27;s manuscript: &quot;The Making of Americans&quot;. Loy even showed some of her own art at the first Free Futurist International Exhibition in Rome. She became, also, at this time, a lifelong convert to Christian Science.In winter 1913, at Caffe Giubbe Rosse (an informal meeting place of those involved in Giovanni Papini&#x27;s &quot;Lacerba)&quot; Loy&#x27;s lodger friend and fellow artist, the American Frances Simpson Stevens, met Florentine artists Carlo Carrà and Ardengo Soffici, who, with Papini, had joined forces with Marinetti&#x27;s Futurists earlier that year. They soon began visiting Stevens on the Costa San Giorgio and through this connection Stevens and Loy met many other Italian artists. Soffici would later invite Loy and Stevens to exhibit their work in the First Free Futurist International Exhibition, to be held in Rome at the Sprovieri Gallery – Loy was the only artist representing Britain and Stevens the only North American.

From 1914 until her departure for America in 1916, Loy was involved in a complicated love triangle between Papini and Marinetti – which she was to write about extensively in her poetry.

In 1914, while living in an expatriate community in Florence, Italy, Loy wrote her &quot;Feminist Manifesto&quot;. A galvanising polemic against the subordinate position of women in society, the short text remained unpublished in Loy&#x27;s lifetime.

=== New York, 1916 ===
Disillusioned with the macho and destructive elements in Futurism, as well as craving independence and participation in a modernist art community, Loy left her children, and moved to New York in winter 1916. Before arriving in New York Loy had already created a stir – most notably with the 1915 publication of her &quot;Love Songs&quot; in the first edition of &quot;.&quot; She became a key figure in the group that formed around magazine, which also included Man Ray, William Carlos Williams, Marcel Duchamp, and Marianne Moore. Loy soon became a well-known member of the Greenwich Village bohemian circuit. Frances Stevens, who had stayed with Loy previously in Florence, helped Loy get a small apartment on West Fifty-seventh Street. Within days of being in New York Stevens took Loy to an evening gathering at Walter and Louise Arensberg&#x27;s 33 West Sixty-seventh Street duplex apartment. 

As Loy&#x27;s biographer Carolyn Burke describes: &#x27;On any given evening the Arensbergs’ guests might include Duchamp’s friends from Paris: the painters Albert Gleizes; his wife, Juliette Roche; Jean and Yvonne Crotti; and Francis Picabia, as well as his wife, Gabrielle Buffet-Picabia; the composer Edgard Varèse; and the novelist and diplomat Henri-Pierre Roché. The new figures in American art and letters were also represented: at various times the salon attracted the artists Man Ray, Beatrice Wood, Charles Sheeler, Katherine Dreier, Charles Demuth, Clara Tice, and Frances Stevens, as well as poets Wallace Stevens, Alfred Kreymborg, William Carlos Williams, writers Allen and Louise Norton and Bob Brown, and art critic Henry McBride. And then there was the Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven – artist’s model, poet, and ultra-eccentric.&#x27; Early in 1917, Loy starred alongside William Carlos Williams, as wife and husband, in Alfred Kreymborg&#x27;s one act play &quot;Lima Beans&quot; produced by the Provincetown Players.

Loy contributed a (since lost) painting entitled &quot;Making Lampshades&quot; to the first exhibition of the Society of Independent Artists (formed in December 1916) at the Grand Central Palace New York which opened on 10 April 1917. With Walter Arensberg acting as the director and Marcel Duchamp as the head of the hanging committee, the show broke new ground in America as they ran with the slogan &#x27;No jury, no prizes&#x27; as well as flouting tradition by displaying art works alphabetically, with no regard to reputation, and allowing anyone to enter for the price of $6.

In 1917 she met the &quot;poet-boxer&quot; Arthur Cravan, a nephew of Oscar Wilde&#x27;s wife, Constance Lloyd. Cravan fled to Mexico to avoid the draft; when Loy&#x27;s divorce was final she followed him, and they married in Mexico City in 1918. Here they lived in poverty and years later, Loy would write of their destitution.

When she found out that she was pregnant, she travelled on a hospital ship to Buenos Aires, &quot;where she intended to wait for Cravan, but Cravan never appeared, nor was he ever seen again&quot;. Reportedly, &quot;Cravan disappeared while testing a boat he planned to escape in. He was presumed drowned, but reported sightings continued to haunt Loy for the rest of her life.&quot; Cravan was lost at sea without trace; although some mistakenly claim that his body was found later in the desert (post-mortem, his life acquired even more epic proportions and dozens of stories proliferated). The tale of Cravan&#x27;s disappearance is strongly anecdotal, as recounted by Loy&#x27;s biographer, Carolyn Burke. Their daughter, Fabienne, was born in April 1919 in England.

In a chapter of her largely unpublished memoir entitled &quot;Colossus&quot;, Loy writes about her relationship with Cravan, who was introduced to her as &quot;the prizefighter who writes poetry.&quot; Irene Gammel argues that their relationship was &quot;located at the heart of avant-garde activities [which included boxing and poetry].&quot; Loy draws on the language of boxing throughout her memoir to define the terms of her relationship with Cravan.

=== Return to Europe and New York ===

After Cravan&#x27;s death/disappearance, Loy travelled back to England, where she gave birth to her daughter, Fabienne. Loy would return to Florence and her other children. However, in 1916 she moved to New York, arriving on 15 October on the ship &quot;Duca D &#x27;Aosta&quot;, which set sail from the port of Naples. While in New York, she worked in a lamp-shade studio, as well as acting in the Provincetown Theater. Here she returned to her old Greenwich Village life, engaging in theatre or mixing with her fellow writers. During this period, some of Loy&#x27;s poems ended up in small magazines such as &quot;Little Review&quot; and &quot;Dial&quot;. She would mingle and develop friendships with the likes of Ezra Pound, Dadaist Tristan Tzara, and Jane Heap. Loy contributed writing to Marcel Duchamp&#x27;s two editions of the journal &quot;The Blind Man&quot;.

Appearing to be somewhat mystified by the new kinds of poetry being produced by Loy and her ilk, Pound remarked in a March 1918 piece for &quot;Little Review&quot;, &quot;In the verse of Marianne Moore I detect traces of emotion; in that of Mina Loy I detect no emotion whatsoever&quot;, seeing them both as demonstrating logopoeia, the writing of poetry without caring for its music or imagism. Instead, in their poetry, they performed &quot;a dance of the intelligence among words and ideas and modification of ideas and characters.&quot; Pound concludes, &quot;The point of my praise, for I intend this as praise...is that without any pretences and without clamours about nationality, these girls have written a distinctly national product, they have written something which would not have come out of any other country, and (while I have before now seen a great deal of rubbish by both of them) they are, as selected by Mr. Kreymborg, interesting and readable (by me...).&quot;

Loy travelled back to Florence, then New York, then back to Florence, &quot;provoked by the news that Haweis had moved with Giles to the Caribbean&quot;. She brought her daughters to Berlin to enrol her daughter in dance school, but left them once more because she was drawn back to Paris by the art and literature scene. 

In 1923, she returned to Paris. Her first volume of poetry, &quot;Lunar Baedecker&quot;, a collection of thirty-one poems, was published this year and was mistakenly printed with the spelling error &quot;Baedecker&quot; rather than the intended &quot;Baedeker&quot;.

=== Lamp-designing ===
In 1936, Loy returned to New York and lived for a time with her daughter in Manhattan. She moved to the Bowery, where she found inspiration for poems and found object assemblage art in the destitute people she encountered. On 15 April 1946, she became a naturalised citizen of the United States under the name &quot;Gertrude Mina Lloyd&quot;, resident at 302 East 66 Street in New York City. Her second and last book, &quot;Lunar Baedeker &amp; Time Tables&quot;, appeared in 1958. In 1953, Loy moved to Aspen, Colorado, where her daughters were already living; Joella, who had been married to the art dealer of Surrealism in New York, Julien Levy, next married the Bauhaus artist and typographer Herbert Bayer. She exhibited her found object art constructions in New York in 1951 and at the Bodley Gallery in 1959 in a show entitled &#x27;Constructions&#x27; but she did not personally attend it. 

=== Death ===
Loy continued to write and work on her assemblages until her death at the age of 83, on 25 September 1966 from pneumonia in Aspen, Colorado. Loy is buried in Aspen Grove Cemetery.

=== Children ===
Loy had four children; her children by Haweis were Oda Janet Haweis (1903–1904), Joella Synara Haweis Levy Bayer (1907–2004) and John Giles Stephen Musgrove Haweis (1909–1923). Her only child with Cravan was Jemima Fabienne Cravan Benedict (1919–1997). Both Oda and John Giles died prematurely—Oda at the age of one year and John Giles at fourteen.

Giles, whose father Stephen Haweis picked him up from Florence in Loy&#x27;s absence and took Giles without her consent to the Caribbean, died of a rare cancerous growth at the age of fourteen having never been reunited with his mother. According to Loy biographer Burke, the loss of Giles, following as it did upon the disappearance or death of Cravan, precipitated struggles with her mental health. As a result, Loy’s daughter Joella often had to care for her and prevent her from self-harming.

== Published works ==

Loy is described as a &quot;brilliant literary enigma&quot; by Rachel Potter and Suzanne Hobson, who outline a chronological map of her geographical and literary shifts. Loy&#x27;s poetry was published in several magazines before being published in book form. The magazines that she was featured in include &quot;Camera Work&quot;, &quot;Trend&quot;, &quot;Rogue, Little Review&quot;, and &quot;Dial&quot;. Loy had two volumes of her poetry published in her lifetime: &quot;The Lunar Baedeker&quot; (1923) and &quot;The Lunar Baedeker &amp; Time-tables&quot; (1958). The &quot;Lunar Baedeker&quot; included her most famous work, &quot;Love Songs&quot;, in a shortened version. It also included four poems included in &quot;Others&quot; in 1915, but their sexual explicitness had provoked a violent reaction, which made it difficult to publish the rest. Posthumously, two updated volumes of her poetry were released, &quot;The Last Lunar Baedeker&quot; (Highlands, NC, Jargon Society, 1982) and &quot;The Lost Lunar Baedeker&quot; (New York, Farrar Straus Girous, 1996 and Manchester, Carcanet, 1997), both edited by Roger L. Conover. The 1997 edition omits Anglo-Mongrels and the Rose, a sequence of 21 poems, part semi-autobiographical, part social satire, arguably Loy&#x27;s most accomplished work - which, as a result of this omission, remains out of print. Songs to Joannes is in both editions.

Her only novel, &quot;Insel&quot;, was published posthumously in 1991. It is about the relationship between a German artist, Insel, and an art dealer, Mrs. Jones. Some critics have suggested that the novel is based on Loy&#x27;s relationship with Richard Oelze. However, Sandeep Parmar has said that it is actually about Loy&#x27;s relationship with her creative self.

== Legacy ==
Loy&#x27;s name may have been an inspiration for the stage name of actress Myrna Loy (born Myrna Williams); the idea apparently came from screenwriter Peter Ruric, also known as crime novelist Paul Cain.

Recently in Argentina Camila Evia has translated and prepared an edition that includes the Feminist Manifesto and many poems by Mina Loy, making her legacy known in depth throughout Latin America.

Nicholas Fox Weber wrote in the &quot;New York Times&quot; that &quot;Mina Loy may never be more than a vaguely familiar name, a passing satellite, but at least she sparkled from an orbit of her own choosing.&quot;

<text>84 Avenue Foch () was the Parisian headquarters of the &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot; (SD), the counter-intelligence branch of the SS during the German occupation of Paris in World War II.

Avenue Foch is a wide residential boulevard in the 16th arrondissement that connects the Arc de Triomphe with the Porte Dauphine on the border with the Bois de Boulogne. During the German occupation of Northern France, the buildings at numbers 82 and 86, either side of 84, were also commandeered by the German occupation forces.

==Counter-espionage activities==
Number 84 was used for the interrogation of allied SOE agents captured in France (including, for example, Frank Pickersgill, Diana Rowden, and Violette Szabo). Prisoners were regularly brought to the building from Fresnes prison on the outskirts of the city.

The second floor was used by the SD&#x27;s wireless unit known as Section IV. It was under the control of Dr. Josef Goetz. The SD used captured allied wireless sets to transmit bogus coded messages in attempts to flush out resistance groups. The operation was colloquially known as Funkspiel (the &#x27;radio game&#x27;).

The third floor was used by SS-&quot;Standartenführer&quot; Helmut Knochen, who was appointed as senior commander of security in Paris in 1940. In 1942, Knochen&#x27;s jurisdiction stretched from northern France to Belgium. He was involved in the deportation of French Jews to concentration camps.

The fourth floor was used by SS-&quot;Sturmbannführer&quot; Josef Kieffer, the commander of number 84, as an office and private quarters. His assistants, SS officer&#x27;s Ernst Misselwitz and Heinrich Meiners, also had an office on this floor.

On the fifth (top) floor contained a guardroom, an interpreter&#x27;s office, and cells for prisoners under interrogation.

A senior interrogator at number 84 was Ernest Vogt, a Swiss-German civilian who since 1940 had been attached to the SD as a civil auxiliary in the capacity of translator and interpreter.

* Peter Churchill, a British secret agent was tortured and held here.

<text>This is a list of [[professional sports]] leagues.

A sports league is a professional body that governs the competition of its teams. They make the rules for competition and behavior and disciplines its members as necessary. This is done through a structure that varies by league. Some are made up of a board of governors that have a commissioner or president, while others are single entity organizations where the league owns the franchises and therefore does not have a board of governors.

This list attempts to show those sports leagues for which all players and teams are paid to play. In other words, these players can be considered to play their chosen sport as their profession. Some leagues do not pay well enough to allow players to use them as their primary or only source of income, but because the players are paid, it is still considered professional, or semi-professional. As such, some leagues listed here may not be fully professional.

<text>Friendster was a social networking service originally based in Mountain View, California, founded by Jonathan Abrams and launched in March 2003. Before Friendster was redesigned, the service allowed users to contact other members, maintain those contacts, and share online content and media with those contacts. The website was also used for dating and discovering new events, bands, and hobbies. Users could share videos, photos, messages, and comments with other members via profiles and networks. It is considered one of the original social networking services.

After the launching of Friendster as a social gaming platform in June 2011, the number of registered users reached over 115 million. The company operated mainly from four Asian countries: the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore, and over 90% of the site&#x27;s traffic came from Asia. As of 2008, Friendster had more monthly unique visitors than any other social network in Asia. Friendster remained notably popular in Indonesia through 2012.

The company suspended services in 2015, citing &quot;the evolving landscape in our challenging industry&quot; and lack of engagement by the online community, and ceased trading in 2018.

==History==
Friendster was founded by Canadian computer programmer Jonathan Abrams in 2002, before MySpace (2003), Hi5 (2004), Facebook (2004), and other social networking sites. Friendster.com went live in 2003 and was adopted by 3 million users within the first few months.

Friendster was one of the first of these sites to attain over 1 million members, although it was preceded by several other smaller social networking sites such as SixDegrees.com (1997) and Makeoutclub (1999).

The name Friendster is a portmanteau of &quot;friend&quot; and Napster. Napster at the time was a controversial peer-to-peer file sharing Internet service that was launched in 1999; by 2000, &quot;Napster&quot; was practically a household name, thanks to several high-profile lawsuits filed against it that year. The original Friendster site was founded in Mountain View, California, and was privately owned. Friendster was based on the &quot;Circle of Friends&quot; social network technique for networking individuals in virtual communities and demonstrates the small world phenomenon. Friendster was considered the top online social network service until around April 2004, when it was overtaken by MySpace in terms of page views, according to Nielsen//NetRatings.

Publications including &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, &quot;Us Weekly&quot;, and &quot;Spin&quot; wrote about Friendster&#x27;s success, and the founder appeared on magazine covers and late-night talk shows. Friendster&#x27;s rapid success inspired a generation of niche social networking websites, including Dogster and Elfster.

Friendster had also received competition from all-in-one sites such as Windows Live Spaces, Yahoo! 360, and Facebook. Google offered $30 million to buy out Friendster in 2003, but the offer was turned down. Friendster was then funded by Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield &amp; Byers and Benchmark Capital in October 2003 with a reported valuation of $53 million. Friendster&#x27;s decision to stay private instead of selling to Google in 2003 is considered one of the biggest blunders in Silicon Valley, the Associated Press claims. In April 2004, John Abrams was removed as CEO, and Tim Koogle took over as interim CEO. Koogle previously served as president and CEO at Yahoo!. Scott Sassa later replaced Koogle in June 2004. Sassa left in May 2005 and was replaced by Taek Kwon. Taek Kwon was then succeeded by Kent Lindstrom, following a capitalization by Kleiner and Benchmark that valued Friendster at less than 5% of its 2003 valuation.

In 2008, Friendster had a membership base of more than 115 million registered users and continued to grow in Asia. According to Alexa, the site suffered an exponential decline in traffic in America beginning in 2009. From a peak 40, it dropped to position 800 in November 2010. Most people have since attributed this decline to the rise of Facebook, a rival social networking site.
In August 2008, Friendster hired ex-Google executive Richard Kimber as CEO. Kimber focused on Friendster&#x27;s expansion in Asia.

On December 9, 2009, it was announced that Friendster had been acquired for $26.4 million by an internet company based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia named MOL Global. MOL&#x27;s ownership of Friendster patents including one for a &quot;System, method, and apparatus for connecting users in an online computer system based on their relationships within social networks&quot; and Friendster&#x27;s other core technical infrastructure patents, were bought by Facebook for $40 million in 2010.

In June 2011, the company re-positioned itself as a social gaming site. It discontinued user social network accounts, but Friendster accounts had not been deleted, and users could still log in using their existing passwords. Users&#x27; contact lists were preserved, along with basic information. Friendster said that the focus would now be on pure &quot;entertainment and fun&quot;, and the aim was not to compete with Facebook, but rather to complement it.

On June 14, 2015, the site and all its services shut down indefinitely, but the company did not officially shutter until the end of June 2018.

In October 2023, the site was reactivated with an entry box for an email address and a button to &quot;Get early access&quot;. The website is owned by Friendster Labs Inc. which has published a terms of service and privacy policy.

On October 3, 2024, the CEO of Friendster, Mike Carson, invited John Zachary Danao to be its first user to enter the early version of the site.

===Financial history===
The company was founded in 2002 with a $12 million investment by Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, Benchmark Capital, and private investors.

In 2003, Friendster management received a $30 million buyout offer from Google, which it declined.

Friendster received another $3 million in funding in February 2006 from Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers and Benchmark Capital. In August 2006, Friendster also received $10 million in funding in a round led by DAG Ventures, and Friendster announced in August 2008 that it had raised an additional $20 million in funding in a round led by IDG Ventures. Prior to its acquisition by MOL Global, Friendster was backed by Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, Benchmark Capital, DAG Ventures, IDG Ventures, and individual investors.

==Awards and recognitions==
* In July 2006, Friendster was awarded Key Social Networking Technology Patent.
* In 2007, Friendster was selected by AlwaysOn Media as Top 100 Private Company Award Winner.
* In April 2008, Friendster became a Webware 100 winner.
* In 2009, the site was the subject of a satirical portrayal by The Onion News Network of the site&#x27;s discovery as an archaeological relic, untouched since 2005.

==Services==
In November 2009, Friendster announced a global partnership with MOL AccessPortal Berhad (MOL), a leading payments provider leveraging a network of over 600,000 physical and virtual payment channels worldwide, to power the Friendster Wallet and a payments platform enabling micro-spending for over 115 million registered users on Friendster. The Friendster Wallet was designed to support a variety of payment methods including pre-paid cards, mobile payments, online payments and credit card payments.

Friendster also had content partners, including game developers and publishers who provided monetization solutions on the Friendster platform using MOL&#x27;s payment channels and Friendster&#x27;s large user base. Sub-brands of Friendster included &quot;Friendster iCafe&quot;, a cybercafe management system, and &quot;Friendster Hotspots&quot;, a free Wi-Fi infrastructure for retailers.

==Languages==
Available languages include English, Filipino, Thai, Malay, Vietnamese, Indonesian, Chinese (both Traditional and Simplified), Japanese, Korean, and Spanish. Users can also enter content on Friendster in any language.

Friendster launched all language support on a single domain – www.friendster.com. Friendster was the first global online social network to support Asian languages and others on a single domain so that users from around the world were able to talk to each other.

==Development==
Friendster has been an open site since August 2006 when it first began allowing widgets and content to be embedded in user profile pages through its developer program. In 2007, roughly 40% of Friendster&#x27;s users had widgets on their profiles.

Friendster gave software developers access to APIs that utilized content and data within the Friendster network to build and deploy customizable applications on and off Friendster. Friendster&#x27;s Developer Program was an open, non-proprietary platform with an open revenue model.

Friendster was the first social network to support both the OpenSocial and the Facebook Platform.

In December 2009, Friendster relaunched its website with a new interface.

In Fall of 2024, Friendster relaunched in a soft fashion of invite only approach similar to how Gmail launched.

==Patents==
Friendster held some fundamental online social networking patents:
*A system, method and apparatus for connecting users in an online computer
*Method of Inducing Content Uploads in a Social Network
*System and Method for Managing Connections in an Online Social Network
*Compatibility Scoring of Users in a Social Network
*Method for sharing relationship information stored in a social network
In August 2010, Facebook confirmed that it had acquired all patents from Friendster for a reported $40M, effectively rendering the company an arms length subsidiary of Facebook.

==Site transformation==
In June 2011, Friendster shifted from social networking site to a social entertainment site with a focus on gaming and entertainment. Previous users&#x27; accounts are unchanged. However, all the photos, messages, comments, testimonials, shoutouts, blogs, forums and groups that the users may have had in the past may no longer be part of their Friendster account. An exporting tool is provided to back up the information of the user account. This tool has the ability to export photos to Flickr and Multiply.

The deadline given to users to export their photos was extended to June 27, 2011. Photos which were not exported before the deadline were removed and are no longer retrievable.

In the two months after the new Friendster relaunched, the site attracted more than half a million new users and included over 40 games. Daily and monthly active users increased by 50%, with more than 90% of new users coming from Asia. At the end of 2015 Friendster closed the website and related services, and on July 1, 2018, it officially ceased to exist as a company.

<text>King Rollo is a children&#x27;s character, created by David McKee in 1980. He is the main character in a series of books, animations narrated by Ray Brooks, and a comic strip in the magazine &quot;Buttons&quot;. Thirteen episodes of the animation were produced in 1980 by McKee&#x27;s own King Rollo Films, where the character is the company&#x27;s mascot and namesake, and were originally shown as part of the pre-school &#x27;See-Saw&#x27; strand.

Rollo himself is a childlike king who is always in need of advice and assistance from his friends. Among these are The Magician (a father figure); Cook (the king&#x27;s cook, a mother figure, who was arguably the real ruler of the kingdom); his neighbour and girlfriend, Queen Gwen; King Frank; and Rollo&#x27;s cat, Hamlet, who was generally portrayed as wiser than Rollo himself.

The animations used the same colourful cut-out paper look as McKee&#x27;s other works, such as Mr Benn. The 2D animation style saved on production costs. The characters&#x27; legs would rotate outwards when walking until they were at right-angles to the sides of their body.

<doc id="379930" wikidata="Q6684972" url="?curid=379930" title="Lottery machine">
<text>A lottery machine is the machine used to draw the winning numbers for a lottery.

Early lotteries were done by drawing numbers, or winning tickets, from a container. In the UK, numbers of winning Premium Bonds (which were not strictly a lottery, but very similar in approach) were generated by an electronic machine called ERNIE.

==Types==
===Mechanical machines===
Most lotteries use mechanical lottery machines. These are more interesting to watch, and more transparent, both literally and figuratively: the audience can see exactly how the internal workings of the machine operate, and they can watch the balls come out of the machine; generally, the balls are visible during the entire draw.

====Gravity Pick====
A gravity pick machine has a chamber with rotating paddles inside, spinning in opposite directions. Numbered balls are dropped into the chamber and mixed until a sliding door opens, allowing the desired number of balls to pass through, one at a time. Machines of this type are used in many games, such as the American games Mega Millions, Powerball and Cash4Life, and the pan-European game EuroMillions.

A similar method is used to draw numbers from a manually operated bingo cage; a weighted cup catches the ball, which drops it onto the tray as the cage is rotated. This variant was at one time used by the Pennsylvania Lottery, the New Jersey Lottery, and the Illinois Lottery; in this variant, a cover is placed strategically, so as to obscure extra balls drawn beyond the number called for by the game matrix.

====Air mix====
Air mix machines have a fan in the bottom that blows the balls around. A valve to a tube opens, and the balls that are blown into the tube are the winning numbers. The balls are evenly weighted and are usually locked away in vaults when not in use, in order to prevent tampering. Machines of this type are used for many &quot;daily numbers&quot;-type games, as well as the pan-European game Eurojackpot.

Though similar in style to the latter type of &quot;air mix&quot; machines, those currently used by the American Powerball game do not use air mix; it is more in tune with a &quot;gravity pick&quot; machine, with the mixing paddles at the bottom of the machine. As the mixing paddle slows down, the ball lands on a pedestal, where it is carried to the top of the machine and then pushed onto the tray. On rare occasions, a similar machine is used in a &quot;pick 3&quot; or &quot;pick 4&quot; game.

===Random number generator===
Some lotteries use computerized random number generators, either alongside or in place of a mechanical draw machine. These are more &quot;cost-effective&quot;: with mechanical equipment, machines and balls have to be replaced periodically. However, these are not as interesting to watch, and may give a player a sense that the lottery is being rigged.

==Security measures==
Because of the massive payoff for a successful cheat (especially after the 1980 Pennsylvania Lottery scandal where drawing balls were rigged to draw a certain number of results), lottery machines are subject to strict security measures. In some cases there are several machines and several sets of balls, and the combination to be used is selected at random just before the draw. An independent accounting firm is hired by each lottery to watch the entire process and certify each drawing, and to step in and wave off the drawing if there are mechanical or technical issues during the drawing, or if the drawing is suspicious. Mechanical machines and RNG machines are also air-gapped from any type of network or external drive connection to prevent a hacking attack against the lottery to influence the results.

<text>The Quote of the Day (QOTD) service is a member of the Internet protocol suite, defined in 1983 in by Jon Postel. As indicated there, the QOTD concept predated the specification, when QOTD was used by mainframe sysadmins to broadcast a daily quote on request by a user. It was then formally codified both for prior purposes as well as for testing and measurement purposes.

A host may connect to a server that supports the QOTD protocol, on either TCP or UDP port 17. To keep the quotes at a reasonable length, RFC 865 specifies a maximum of 512 octets for the quote.

Although some sources indicate that the QOTD service is rarely enabled, and is in any case often firewalled to avoid denial-of-service attacks, interest continues in the pre-existing purpose of serving quotes as can be seen with web engine searches.

Current testing and measurement of IP networks is more commonly done with ping and traceroute, which are more robust adaptations of the echo protocol (RFC 862), which predated the attempt at QOTD standardization.

<text>Hévíz Spa and the Szent András Hospital, Hévíz (English: St. Andrew&#x27;s State Hospital for Rheumatology and Rehabilitation) is a destination spa in Hungary. It is located in Hévíz, on the shores of the lake of the same name. Hévíz–Balaton Airport is approximately from the town.

==History==
The curative effect of the lake was probably known to the ancient Romans. Coins found in the lake in the early 1980s support this supposition. Discoveries from the age of Migration suggest that the migrant German and Slavic population used the lake as well. Written sources more than 400 years old originate from the age of Ottoman occupation. 

The lake and its surroundings became the property of the Festetics family in the middle of the 18th century, who started its development as a spa. Earl György (I.) Festetics (between 1795 and 1797) built a thermal wooden bathing house on a float over the outflow. After the earl&#x27;s death in 1819 the development of Hévíz stopped. 1 March 1868, György (II.) Festetics began building the bathing resort suitable for guests. The bath looked more or less as it does today. In 1866 the mirrorbath was built.

In 1905 Vencel Reischl, a brewery owner from Keszthely, became the tenant of the bath and remained so for 35 years. Reischl replaced the hotels, restaurants, and buildings, and the entrance of the bath was finished in 1911 together with the Zander Institution. The number of visitors increased significantly, and the facilities expanded considerably as more doctors moved to the site to practice various forms of therapy.

Between 1944 and 1946 the buildings were used as a hospital, first by the German then by the Soviet army. In 1948 it fell under state ownership; the State Medicinal Bath, Hévíz, was established by the Ministry of Health on 1 January 1952. The number of visitors tripled then quadrupled, and the machinery of the hospital and the treatments were modernised. On 3 March 1986, the central buildings of the bath (in the lake) burnt down. In September 1989 the reconstruction of the destroyed parts was completed.

Further reconstruction of the park and buildings was completed between 2000 and 2002. Today the area of the institution is 620,000 square metres.
