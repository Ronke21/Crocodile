<text>Leshy or Leshi is a tutelary deity of the forest in pagan Slavic mythology. As Leshy rules over the forest and hunting, he may be related to the Slavic god Porewit.

A similar deity called &quot;Svyatibor&quot; (&quot;Svyatobor&quot;, &quot;Svyatibog&quot;) is thought to have been revered by both the Eastern and Western Slavs as the divine arbiter of woodland realms, and/or the sovereign ruler over other diminutive forest spirits. Svytibor&#x27;s functions were much like those of the god Veles.

Leshy often appears as a masculine humanoid, and possesses an ability to disguise himself as any person, including changing in size and stature. In some accounts, Leshy is described as having a wife (&quot;Leshachikha&quot;, &quot;Leszachka&quot;, &quot;Lesovikha,&quot; and sometimes the &quot;Kikimora&quot; of the swamp) and children (&quot;leshonki&quot;, &quot;leszonky&quot;). 

Leshy is known to misguide wanderers and abduct young ones, traits he shares with the notorious Chort, the &quot;Black One&quot; or &quot;Devil,&quot; thus leading some to perceive him as a malevolent entity. Leshy&#x27;s attitude towards humans can vary, depending on how they interact with the forest and their overall behavior. Leshy is said to possess the power to whisk away children who were mistreated by their kin, especially their parents, to the ethereal realm of forest-dwelling folk. In this way, Leshy is also often considered to be temperamental, with a similar disposition to that of a fairy.

==Appearance==
According to Robert Pyle, a majority of cultures have traditional narratives that tell of giant humanoid beings, each with a localized name for their own version of this legend. Many names mean something like “wild man“ or “hairy man,” although others describe common actions that this entity is said to perform, such as eating clams or shaking trees. 

The depiction of Leshy in Russian folklore reflects his supernatural essence and his strong bond with the forest. Being the embodiment of the forest, he can manifest in various forms associated with it. Leshy is a multifaceted entity, a fusion of different elements: animal, plant, human, whirlwind, and formless spirit. In his stories, Leshy may not be explicitly described, as his form is often elusive, and the storyteller may even fear the consequences of vividly depicting such an &quot;unclean force&quot; (something from the Otherworld, beyond the limits of ordered reality.)

In ancient tales, Leshy is depicted as a phytoanthropomorphic being (part plant, part human), with a distinct leaning towards either human or plant-like characteristics. He is often portrayed as a plant, such as a revered tree (a pine, spruce, birch, oak, or aspen), a bush, a stump, a leaf, or even a mushroom. Leshy may also take on a more human form with woodland traits, such as long, tangled green hair resembling tree branches, a beard made of lichen, and clothing and skin the color and texture of bark. In some cases, the plant-like features are reduced to accessories, such as a club or wand, a green beard, or green eyes and clothing. Leshy is said to possess the ability to whip humans with twigs, create noise and humming sounds, and even cause trees to split. In certain tales, Leshy is seen as the embodiment of the entire forest, filling his whole wood with his presence.

In the realm of folklore, Leshy assumes myriad forms, some of which are zooanthropomorphic creatures. He may take on the forms of wild and domestic animals, such as: bears, wolves, owls, demonic hares, frogs, crows, magpies, dogs, black cats, horses, and black goats. Leshy is also portrayed as a half-man half-goat, with black fur covering his body, small curved horns, hooves, long hair and a beard. Alternatively, he can appear as a human with animalistic features, including thick hair, animal pelts as clothes, claws, hooves, a tail, and wings. Leshy is often accompanied by an animal companion, such as a black dog or a small black goat.

Today, the dominant perception of Leshy is more anthropomorphic. He can vary in size from a giant to an average-sized man. Leshy is typically depicted with long, disheveled or thinning hair in shades of gray, green, or red, and a matching beard. At times, he is imagined with a face as white as birch bark. His eyes can be green, unnaturally pale, white, lead-blue, brilliant, or dull, and may appear bulging or fixed, with the right eye often larger than the left, or both larger than human eyes. Leshy may lack eyebrows and eyelashes, although he may also have bushy eyebrows. He is sometimes described as missing a nostril, right ear, or one eye, and may have a limp. According to some beliefs, Leshy has an upward-pointing head. In certain depictions, he is said to have blue blood, resulting in blue skin. Leshy is often characterized by a desire to conceal his face and avoid making eye contact with others. When sitting, he is said to cross his left leg over the right. 

Some Belorussians believe that Leshy has a flat, long face, a long, wedge-shaped beard, one eye, and one backwards leg. The image of Leshy as an old man with a gray beard is widespread. Frequently, Leshy takes on the guise of a family member, friend, or someone familiar to the storyteller, and this trickery may only be exposed upon returning home, when it becomes apparent that the encounter took place in a completely different location. Leshy is also known to assume the appearance of a deceased individual.

Some imagine Leshy to be a colossal giant, easily crossing rivers in one stride. Conversely, others see him as a small person, or merely average. In some beliefs, it is said that Leshy&#x27;s height changes based on the surrounding vegetation, so he may be as tall as a tree or as short as a blade of grass. Other perspectives suggest that Leshy seems tall at a distance, but appears ordinary or small when seen up close. 

In the northern regions of Russia, forest-spirit type Leshy were categorized into different species based on their size, including those that acted as guardians of the forest, those that resembled mushrooms, and those that were akin to mosses. 

Leshy is believed to possess incredible strength and weight, being so heavy that even a horse would have trouble pulling the cart he sat on. This supernatural being defied the laws of nature with his immense power, leaving a lasting impact on anyone who encountered him.

It is widely believed that Leshy dresses like an ordinary person. He may wear leather or fur clothing, an armyak, a woolen homemade caftan, a siberka, clothing similar to a balaklava or a cassock with wide sleeves. His headgear is diverse: a wide-brimmed hat, a pointed cap, a patched-up scrap hat, etc. According to other beliefs, Leshy always has an uncovered head. Some tales state that Leshy is always belted, while others claim he never has a belt. Leshy typically wears enormous bast shoes. He is often caught weaving or digging in them, sitting on a stump under the moonlight. He also wears boots or goes barefoot. The left side of Leshy&#x27;s clothing is fastened on the right (contrary to men&#x27;s customary practice) with the right side sometimes “tucked in,” and his shoes are occasionally worn on the wrong feet. Leshy is often depicted as a forester or a soldier, usually with shiny buttons. In later folk tales, Leshy is dressed in modern clothing: a cap, boots or shoes, etc. Sometimes he wears attire atypical for the forest, such as a black suit. Overall, the color of Leshy&#x27;s clothing varies: the colors of the forest are green and tawny, the colors of the otherworldly realm are white and black, and gray to represent a mixture. Also, he may wear red, associated with the color of blood, and blue. In his hands, Leshy might carry a whip, a lash, a cudgel, or a basket, indicating his connection to the forest and his patronage over animals. Leshy is often seen naked as well.

It was believed that a strong wind accompanies Leshy from ahead and behind, indicating the direction in which he is heading. This wind erases Leshy&#x27;s tracks, explaining why nobody ever sees them (although in other stories, Leshy does leave traces). He may take on the form of a whirlwind, as well as a storm-cloud, rain, and fog. In this form, he raises dust on the road, tears off roofs, and topples trees. In some regions, the image of Leshy as a whirlwind was the most common, and in certain places, any kind of bad weather was identified with him.

Some believe that Leshy lacks a shadow, or can turn invisible. It is said that to catch a glimpse of Leshy&#x27;s true form, one must peer through the right ear of a horse or through a bridle while sitting between three harrows. Northern Russian folklore claims that Leshy wears an invisibility cap, but he can be revealed by using the plant known as Ivan&#x27;s (or Adam&#x27;s) head and stealing the cap from him. In certain tales, the only manifestation of Leshy is an inexplicable and sometimes collective fear that arises unexpectedly in the forest.

According to folklore, Leshy&#x27;s sounds are both clamorous (often resonating throughout the entire woodland, deafening humans) and diverse (encompassing all sounds that can be heard or imagined in the forest): whistling, laughter, clapping, bellowing cries, singing, the voices of various animals, the howling of the wind, humming, crackling, and rustling. In this way, Leshy asserts his superiority over humans, expressing dissatisfaction, striving to scare, jest, and lead astray with false sounds. In numerous stories, Leshy speaks like a human. Often, his mimicry sounds like an echo. At times he is deliberately silent, and in some places it was even believed that he could not speak. One might hear the sounds of an individual leshy&#x27;s wedding procession: the hoof beats of horses, tinkling bells, harmonicas, and singing.

==Lifestyle==
Encounters with Leshy could take place anywhere in the forest, at any time. Leshy might be found in old dry trees (such as fir and willow), in hollows, in stumps, in upturned roots, in fallen logs, in woodland huts, in secret caves, and even underground. People inevitably get lost near Leshy&#x27;s dwelling. Leshy&#x27;s abode is protected by dense, impassable thickets and fallen trees which never freeze. Animals and birds are drawn there. Superstition says that forest creatures gather there before their death. 

Often, Leshy is depicted as a solitary being, or as one of many diminutive forest spirits (leshy, for distinction.) In beliefs that feature many spirits, only one leshy may inhabit each forest (large forests may be divided into sections, each with its own leshy). In some tales, leshy can gather together, living in families (a leshy&#x27;s wife is called a leshachikha or a kidnapped maiden, and their children are either their own offspring or also kidnapped children). Leshy homes are covered in animal hides, and guarded by dogs, and they keep livestock; there are stories of leshy leaders and kings; the head of the leshy is referred to as the forest chief, the woodland king, the forest dweller, Musail-les, or the Honorable Leshy. Leshy can move along human roads, but in the forest, they have their own invisible paths that do not coincide with those of humans and are dangerous places to get lost. There was a belief that not all leshy creatures are active throughout the day, but only during certain transitional hours: at night (especially at midnight), at dawn, at noon, or at an undefined “evil hour.”

Observations of leshy are also contradictory. Leshy are often depicted as having a majestic demeanor, yet they enjoy jesting, revelry, drinking, and playing cards. All the phenomena caused by gusts of wind in the forest might be leshy activities: howling, the crackling of trees, and the rustling of leaves. The fallen trees and roofs torn off by hurricane winds in some regions are associated with the noisy weddings of leshy, which they celebrate during the summer. Leshy enjoy hanging and swaying on tree branches, which is why in certain places they are called the “hangers down.” They frequently sit on stumps, whittling wood.

Leshy the god might come into conflict with other, smaller leshy, as well as demons, water spirits, field spirits, and house spirits. Leshy takes care of the forest and protects it. He acts as the shepherd of all woodland creatures, depicted as an old man with a staff in his hand. He herds the animals, ensures their nourishment, defends them from hunters and fires. Leshy governs the animals under his dominion as his own property. He may gamble them away in a game of cards to another forest spirit, which served as a mystical explanation for mass animal migrations such as squirrels and hares. Leshy is often portrayed as the patron of only one or a few species of wild animals, most commonly bears and wolves (Leshy can manifest as a white wolf - the pack leader).

A series of dates in the folk calendar are associated with Leshy. The presence of multiple leshy was particularly common before Great Lent, Palm Sunday, and on the night of Ivan Kupala on June 24 (July 7). Leshy, like other spirits, celebrate the arrival of spring and Easter (the best gift for leshy being an Easter egg). On George&#x27;s Day in Spring, April 23 (May 6), or around St. Nicholas&#x27; Day, May 9 (May 22), shepherds could make agreements with leshy. Hunters made agreements with leshy on Easter and on the night of Ivan Kupala. On the night of Agafon the Monk, August 22 (September 4), leshy would leave the forest and run through the villages, causing mischief in general. Peasants would guard sheaves of wheat from Leshy at night, walking around in a circle with a poker, as if enclosing the wheat with a fence. The Feast of the Cross, September 14 (September 27), was also considered a special day for leshy, when they would drive forest animals into special places to play cards with them. Peasants would avoid going into the forest on this day so as not to stumble upon the gathering of leshy. 

On St. Erofey&#x27;s Day, October 4 (October 17), Leshy would stop wandering through the forest, as they would sink into the ground for the winter. Leshy would become agitated, causing winds, digging up the earth, and scattering animals. It was considered dangerous to go into the forest on this day. Leshy would only reappear in the spring, when the snow began to melt. However, according to equally prevalent beliefs, Leshy would remain in the forest during the winter, causing blizzards. Like other unclean spirits, leshy could manifest themselves during the Christmas season.

The origins of individual leshy are unclear, with various beliefs suggesting they may be cursed individuals, children swapped by dark forces, or offspring of a devil and a witch. In folk Christianity, some believed that leshy were either fallen angels or creations of the Devil who were cast down to earth. They may also be seen as descendants of Adam and Eve who were not acknowledged by God, or other individuals cursed by Him.

==Leshy and humans==
The life of the Russian peasant was intimately intertwined with the forest, upon which their livelihoods hinged. Within the forest, every aspect of agricultural labor unfolded, with slash-and-burn techniques to create fields. Cattle grazed amidst the trees, while wood was harvested for both construction and warmth. People also harvested mushrooms and berries, fished, and extracted tar and charcoal. The forest served as a vital thoroughfare for roads, while also playing host to various pagan rituals. Despite active engagement with the forest and its proximity, it remained an enigmatic and perilous domain. It was regarded as an otherworldly realm, teeming with impure forces and beyond the grasp of human control.

The perception of Leshy as a forest guardian was ambiguous among the people. Leshy was considered a hostile and dangerous force, sometimes mistaken for a demon. He was often contrasted, however, with “real demons”: his goal was not to harm humans for no reason, but to punish improper behavior in the forest or breaking societal rules. Leshy didn&#x27;t always harm people intentionally by playing tricks, albeit in a crude and malicious manner: he scared people with laughter and clapping, led them astray, hid their hats and baskets, made them sleep on anthills, forced them to climb trees, offered pine cones disguised as a drink, removed wagon wheels, and more. Leshy was also seen as a benevolent and just spirit, who wouldn&#x27;t harm humans without reason. He could help gather mushrooms or berries, or show the way if asked, or take care of a lost child. Leshy determined the success of hunting and the prosperous grazing of livestock. Numerous mythological tales depict the struggle between humans and Leshy. This conflicting perspective is also reflected in the depiction of Leshy, alternating between a formidable and fearsome entity that could only be countered with prayers or magic (predominantly in traditional beliefs), and a humble folk demon who could be outwitted by a cunning peasant (primarily in fairy tales and similar accounts).

According to folk etiquette, when going to the forest, one should pray and ask permission to enter it from Leshy as the “master of the forest.” It was also necessary to ask for Leshy&#x27;s consent to pursue any activity in the forest. One should not, when going to the forest, say that they are going for a short time - it is not for them to decide, but for the forest. It is very dangerous to get a curse from a relative before going to the forest, as Leshy believes that “cursed people” are promised to him. Leshy does not like it when those in the forest curse, make noise, sing, and whistle - it is his prerogative, he may take offense and respond with his own destructive whistle. Do not respond to an unfamiliar voice - it may be Leshy.

Protecting the forest, Leshy can scatter axes and make trees invulnerable to woodcutters, and divert the shots of hunters. A person who stays overnight in a forest hut without being asked might become a target for Leshy to frighten with mysterious noises, maybe even violence. Making a fire or camping on a trail is ill-advised, especially at the crossroads, since a whole wedding or funeral procession of smaller leshy could run over anyone lingering there.

Leshy likes to warm himself by a human fire, but if he is angry he will extinguish it. If a person misbehaves in the forest, Leshy could frighten them with visions, make them sick, or even tickle them to death. If a person fell ill in the forest, Leshy was petitioned to help them recover. Sometimes Leshy could harm a person without any apparent reason.

==The relationship of hunters and shepherds with Leshy==
Hunters firmly believed that their hunting success was determined by Leshy, who was responsible for distributing the bounties of the forest to humans. To ensure a fruitful hunt, one could enter into a pact with Leshy (preferably during Easter or on the night of Ivan Kupala) by offering a gift, such as the first Easter egg or bread with salt (mixed with one&#x27;s own hair or nails), or by making a sacrifice of one&#x27;s own blood (from a finger or first catch). Another option was to write a contract in blood. The individual made a promise to abide by specific terms, such as refraining from taking more prey than allowed or refraining from hunting on designated days. This agreement must be kept confidential. By fulfilling his end of the bargain, Leshy would guide herds of animals towards the hunter&#x27;s weapon or lead them into traps, ensuring accurate shots. Any individual who broke the agreement or revealed it would lose the protection of Leshy and may face severe consequences, such as illness or death. Striking a deal with Leshy meant surrendering oneself to his power and, as Christianity became more prevalent, it was often equated with selling one&#x27;s soul to the Devil. In later beliefs, ending a contract with Leshy required placing a cross under one&#x27;s heel, burying it in the ground, or shooting an ikon, holy gifts, or a cross with a gun and smearing the weapon with the resulting blood.

In many regions, cattle were commonly grazed in the forest, and in order to protect them from potential attacks and losses by predators, a shepherd would perform a ritual detour (known as a “free leave”) at the beginning of the season, either on Egoriy, or on Nikola days. This involved circling the herd three times while carrying an ikon and other “magical” objects, reciting incantations. It was believed that any mistakes could anger Leshy, who was seen as the source of all misfortunes with the cattle in the forest, and he may seek revenge by harming the animals. Consequently, many individuals opted to negotiate with Leshy and choose a “divine” or “blessed” free leave instead of risking an “unblessed” free leave. This entailed the shepherd performing a ritual detour around the herd and sitting on a fallen birch tree or aspen stump on the same day or the day before, using a magical incantation to summon Leshy and presenting him with a gift such as an Easter egg, bread with salt, or even a couple of cows. The cow that was promised to Leshy would then either die or disappear in the forest during the season. In some traditions, Leshy was not summoned, but instead a present was left for him beneath a birch tree. The agreement with Leshy was made using a specific and secret formula, but no one was ever able to record the exact text. The shepherd made sure to leave a lock and key in the forest as part of the agreement. It was believed that Leshy would unlock it when the cows needed to graze and lock it when they had to return to the village. Once the agreement was in place, it was thought that Leshy or his spouse would take care of the grazing instead of the shepherd. This allowed the shepherd to focus on his own tasks and only have to deal with driving out and corralling the cattle. He could also easily call any cows from the forest by blowing a trumpet. The shepherd had to follow certain rules throughout the season. These included not watching the cattle in the forest, not harming them, not killing any forest animals, not damaging trees, not picking berries (especially black berries) and mushrooms, not swearing, not cutting hair or nails, not wearing his own clothes while grazing, not lending his pipe or batog to others, not touching other people (shaking hands, sharing utensils, bathing or sleeping with a woman), and not looking upon dead people or newborns. It was also forbidden to sell any cattle from the herd, scratch the wool of sheep, or damage any hedges. Breaking these taboos was believed to result in the breaking of the contract and could even lead to the death of the cattle and the shepherd.

It was believed that Leshy had the ability to steal cattle from people, particularly those who had been cursed and were “sent to Leshy.” Leshy had the power to punish those who were careless with their cattle. If the cattle happened to wander into Leshy&#x27;s territory, they could easily get lost. Leshy can “tie” the cattle to a tree, preventing them from moving and causing them to starve, or even “lock” or “hide” the animal in another realm, making it seem as though it had disappeared. Those searching for their lost cattle may hear the sound of the cow&#x27;s bell nearby, but still be unable to find it. In some beliefs, Leshy would take care of the stolen cows, grazing and milking them. Leshy had the power to cause chaos among domesticated animals, such as wolves and bears, that were under the care of a negligent shepherd. In order to locate the missing animals, peasants not only conducted regular searches, but also performed a ritual known as “turning away.” This involved going to a crossroads in the forest, often with the help of a knowledgeable person, and attempting to make a deal with Leshy. To appease him, they would offer gifts such as eggs or bread with salt, wrapped in a clean cloth and tied with a red thread. They would also pray to Leshy or use threats of magic, such as cursing all the forest roads or tying up all the trees. If the missing animal had not been taken by Leshy, it would usually return soon or Leshy would reveal its whereabouts. In some cases, Leshy would also reveal the animal&#x27;s fate, whether it had been attacked by other animals, stolen by someone, or simply wandering outside of the forest.

==The phenomenon of individuals wandering and disappearing in forests==
Leshy are known for causing people to get lost in the forest, which is why they earned the moniker “guiders off-course.” Those who find themselves lost in the woods are often believed to have fallen under a leshy&#x27;s spell, enveloped by an invisible force that transports them to an unknown realm. Individuals who unknowingly follow leshy tracks are bound to wander aimlessly, their paths blocked with fallen trees and rivers, making escape even more challenging. Leshy can hide the lost person from prying eyes: people can hear that they are nearby but cannot find them. Leshy can bind the person to the tree in which they live, compelling the traveler to constantly return to it, and manipulate natural signs and landmarks that serve as guides on the path. Leshy can lure a hunter deep into the thicket by pretending to be an elusive or exotic animal. He can also mimic the voice of a friend, a crying child, or a dying person. By taking on the appearance of a familiar or unfamiliar companion, Leshy distracts his victim with conversations or promises of abundant mushroom or berry patches, only to lead them into an impassable place before disappearing. The lost person finds themselves in an unfamiliar place, maybe a different world. When the enchantment dissipates, the individual may discover that they were very close to their usual surroundings the whole time. Leshy can manifest as a familiar person and teasingly remain out of reach, suddenly vanishing, often at the boundary with the civilized world - for example, when crossing a bridge or fence - usually accompanied by laughter.

According to folklore, there are multiple ways to protect oneself from Leshy, whether he is perceived as a malevolent force, one of many forest spirits, or an ancient deity. These methods include reciting prayers, making the sign of the cross, calling upon the name of God, using profanity, or attempting to make Leshy laugh. To end an encounter with Leshy, one must repeat the original words spoken, completing a verbal circle. Other protective measures against Leshy include using salt, fire, a circle made with a sacred object, a linden stick, a coppice, or a mountain ash as talismans. It is also believed that Leshy is afraid of dogs, tricolored cats, and firearms loaded with copper bullets.

In order to break free from the spells of Leshy, an individual must go through a peculiar ritual of undressing completely and putting on their clothes in a non-traditional manner: inside out, backwards, switching shoes, and even flipping insoles. While removing their garments, it is crucial to vocally express strong oaths and forcefully strike them against the sturdy trunk of a tree. When getting dressed, it is recommended to recite a prayer and utter an incantation. Similarly, if one gets lost while riding in a cart, it is necessary to attach the horses in an inverted manner. One can try retracing their steps in reverse, following their own footprints in an effort to escape the confusing forest. Lastly, one can seek guidance and ask Leshy to help them find the correct path.

In a manner similar to demonic beings, Leshy possesses the power to abduct individuals, regardless of their age or gender. These abductions are shrouded in mystery, with the victims disappearing without a trace. The primary reason behind these abductions is typically tied to a curse, often inflicted by a parent, who sends their child to Leshy as punishment. In the case of a “cursed child” who manages to receive a christening, Leshy bides his time until the child reaches the age of seven before luring them into the depths of the forest. Instead of leaving an empty cradle, Leshy may replace the kidnapped baby with a “changeling” - an inanimate object such as a log or a bundle of straw. Alternatively, Leshy may leave behind his own child, who takes on the appearance of the kidnapped child but in a distorted and grotesque form. These changelings are often characterized by their constant anger, non-stop crying, inability to walk or talk, and lack of intelligence. Eventually, they either vanish, perish, or flee into the forest once they reach a certain age. Those who choose to remain among humans often become sorcerers. 

Certain legends portray Leshies as treating their captives with kindness, providing them with sustenance, education, and hidden knowledge, ultimately transforming them into sorcerers and witch doctors. Leshy takes abducted girls as his wives and may even have children with them. However, if a woman gives birth to a child from Leshy and remains in a village, the child mysteriously disappears. Leshy is also known to abduct individuals with the intention of making them his slaves. Often, the abducted individuals become invisible to others, able to see their loved ones and hear their conversations, but unable to reveal themselves or communicate. Other tales suggest that the missing individuals become feral, losing their ability to understand language, wear clothes, and becoming covered in moss and bark, as well as exhibiting aggressive behavior and running away from people. There are also stories in which the “abducted” individuals perish due to exhaustion, starvation, falling into a pit, or becoming stuck in a swamp.

It was believed that one could safeguard themselves from abduction through the use of either Christian or pagan methods. Christians would turn to prayer, crossing themselves, remembering God, and attending prayer services. Pagans, on the other hand, would utter the phrase “dibs on me,” recite incantations, perform the ritual of “turning away,” or attempt to catch up with the abductor within the confines of the forest. When searching for a missing person in the woods, people would use the same “turning away” ritual as they would for finding a lost pet, but with more substantial offerings. These offerings included bread, salt, pancakes, pies, a pot of porridge, or a piece of lard. Family members would call upon a house-spirit for protection against Leshy, communicating with it through the chimney. According to popular belief, a person who had been kidnapped should avoid consuming any food provided by Leshy in order to be able to return home. However, there were other stories where individuals who had eaten Leshy&#x27;s offerings were able to successfully find their way back, only to discover that the food they had taken had transformed into cones, moss, and other natural objects. If Leshy had made a deal with the lost individual, he might guide them out of the forest or reveal their location to those searching for them. Leshy&#x27;s reaction to releasing his captives was unpredictable - he could do so with joy and a warning to stay away, in annoyance for being disturbed, or reluctantly trying to keep his victim. There were also instances where Leshy would return long-lost captives as a reward for assistance or when they were no longer needed, or even give a kidnapped girl in marriage to others.

There was a belief that those who returned from Leshy were forever changed. They either struggled to find their words, suffered mental wounds, or emerged with a newfound sense of purpose and mystic abilities. These individuals were rumored to possess powers of witchcraft, the ability to foresee the future, and the gift of communicating with otherworldly entities. They were often drawn back to the forest, avoiding society and finding it difficult to form lasting relationships. The details of their time spent with Leshy were kept secret, as some feared that revealing too much could have dire consequences. In the case of young women who returned, known as forest maidens in the Smolensk region, the effects of their encounters with Leshy often manifested after marriage.

==The art of summoning, fortune-telling, and other mystical practices==
The art of summoning Leshy involves various intricate rituals and methods. One technique includes creating a circle with young birch trees and calling out by removing a cross and shouting loudly, “Grandfather!” Another method entails felling a pine tree onto two aspen trees in the forest and standing on them while facing north to invoke Leshy. On the night of Ivan Kupala, one can cut down an aspen tree so that it falls to the east, then stand on the stump facing east, bend over, look between their legs, and say, “Uncle Leshy! Show yourself as I am, not as a gray wolf, black raven, or fir-tree.” Other ways to summon Leshy include not praying at night and thinking about him before bed, sitting on a pine stump and beckoning three times, closing the door with one&#x27;s left hand before entering the forest, digging up an anthill with one&#x27;s left foot, cutting the top of a birch tree with one&#x27;s left hand, and shouting “U-u-u!” Another method is to remove a cross at night in the forest, bury it in the ground, and say, “Lord of forests, I have a request for you!”
On Christmas Eve, it was a common practice to engage in fortune-telling rituals in the forest, often at a crossroads and during the night. The fortune-tellers would create three circles or use the skin of an animal as a boundary, placing a magical object such as a poker within. Sitting on the skin, they would also place a piece of bread and sometimes other objects beside them, and then ask Leshy for insight into the upcoming year. The response would come in the form of various forest sounds, which the fortune-tellers would interpret. It was believed that Leshy would only answer three questions and failure to follow the ritual could result in severe consequences. It was also believed that on Maundy Thursday, one could seek out an old birch tree in the forest, sit upon it, and call upon Leshy (“Forest King, father to all animals, appear here!”) to reveal the future. Additionally, it was said that Leshy could foretell the fate of anyone who encountered him. In certain regions, the appearance of Leshy was seen as a sign of impending trouble.

When discussing encounters with Leshy, as well as other malevolent entities, it is often said that one must &quot;lure&quot; or &quot;tempt&quot; or &quot;scare&quot; him in order to make contact. However, there are tales in which Leshy is able to communicate with humans without any obstacles: visiting a pub and drinking vodka, hiring a person to work for him, visiting people, playing matchmaker for a girl he fancies, and so on. There are also stories in which Leshy is portrayed as a giant, riding on humans transformed into horses, carrying a person on his back, stealing food and supplies from people, including grain and nails. At times, Leshy even seeks assistance from humans: asking to be taught how to play the harmonica, requesting food, having a midwife help deliver Leshy’s child, being freed by a hunter from fellow hunters, being cared for by a woman after being found naked in the woods, and receiving prayers from a man to help ward off devils. In return, Leshy shows gratitude towards humans by helping them become wealthy, giving them magical objects, and taking their place in the army. It is believed that during human wars, Leshy and other forest spirits may also engage in battles among themselves. Leshy is frequently referenced in swear words, although he can be substituted with &quot;devil&quot; in those instances.

==Female Leshy==
The feminine counterpart of Leshy takes on many forms, just like Leshy himself. She may appear as a grotesque being with exaggerated features, or as a regular woman; either unclothed, or dressed in rags, or a flowing garment. Her hair may be wild, adorned with branches, or she may appear as a towering, aged figure. Some stories describe her as a gigantic woman, with the ability to suspend her offspring in cradles from trees.

In ancient Russian tales, the wife of Leshy is portrayed as a powerful figure in the forest, known for her terrifying cries, luring wanderers off course, and snatching children and livestock. These feminine counterparts also share similar characteristics with Leshy, such as stealing unblessed food, making deals with shepherds to graze their livestock, and showing appreciation to those who aid her. In Ukrainian folklore, there is a tale of a man who marries a forest spirit girl after baptizing her and stealing her clothes while she was bathing.

In northern folklore, the female equivalent of Leshy bears a striking resemblance to a mermaid, known as the “free old woman” or “mistress” of the tundra and bogs. She is said to possess the traits of a cursed girl who perished in the forest. This feminine counterpart of Leshy is often seen as a distinct character, being mostly independent from the original image of her.

<text>Tengboche (or Thyangboche) is a village in Khumbu Pasanglhamu rural municipality in the Khumbu subregion of Province No. 1 in Nepal, located at . Within the village is an important Buddhist monastery, Tengboche Monastery, which is the largest gompa in the Khumbu region. The structure was built in 1923. In 1934, it was destroyed by an earthquake but subsequently rebuilt. It was destroyed again by a fire in 1989, and again rebuilt with the help of volunteers and the provision of foreign aid. Tengboche has a panoramic view of the Himalayan mountains, including the well-known peaks of Tawache, Everest, Nuptse, Lhotse, Ama Dablam, and Thamserku. Tenzing Norgay, the first man to reach the summit of Mount Everest with Sir Edmund Hillary, was born in the area in the village of Thani and was once sent to Tengboche Monastery to be a monk.

==History==
The Khumbu valley, where Tengboche is located, came under the influence of Buddhism about 350 years ago. Ancient scriptures of Tibet refer to this valley along with Rowlang and Khanbalung valleys as sacred places. Lama Sangwa Dorje is referred to as the founder of the oldest monastery in Khumbu at Pangboche as well as many other small hermitages. His divine psychic knowledge and clairvoyant vision had prophesied suitability of establishing a monastery at Tengboche based on a foot print on a rock left by him while meditating. However, the actual establishment of the monastery happened only during Ngawang Tenzin Norbu&#x27;s time; Norbu was considered to be Sangwa Dorje&#x27;s fifth incarnation. He had established a monastery at Rongbuk in Tibet on the northern face of Mount Everest. He blessed Chatang Chotar, known as Lama Gulu, to found the Tengboche monastery at Tengboche village and as a result it got established at its present location in 1916. It is the first celibate monastery under the Nyingmapa lineage of the Vajrayana Buddhism. However, many older village level monasteries also exist close by.

Three wealthy inhabitants of the local Sherpa community are credited with funding building of the monastery. Among these three, Karma was the most influential and well known as he was a tax collector, and he also enjoyed the patronage of the Rana rulers of Nepal. It is also said that apart from Khumbu Sherpas, Sherung Sherpas have also been involved with building this monastery. Some of the village temples, chortens and smaller religious shrines are predated to 1880, particularly all the large chortens. The Mani wall, made of slabs of stone inscribed with prayers and sacred texts is dated to 1915.

The monastery of Tengboche and other buildings were destroyed during the 1934 earthquake. Subsequently, Lama Gulu who had built it also died. His successor, Umze Gelden, took up the task of rebuilding the monastery, with strong support from Ngawang Tenzin Norbu. The monks and the local community, with support from a skilled carpenter from Lhasa, re-established the monastery. Exclusive murals were painted by Kappa Kalden, a renowned artist. With an influx of tourists to the Khumbu region, particularly for trekking by mountaineers, the monastery has received wide recognition. However, the monastery&#x27;s precious old scriptures, statues, murals and wood carvings were destroyed in the devastating fire caused by an electrical short circuit on January 19, 1989. The monumental stone credited with Lama Sangwa Dorje&#x27;s left footprint had also fractured. However, a few trekkers managed to salvage some books and paintings. It has since been completely rebuilt with money donated from all round the world. 

Following the destruction of the monastery by fire, its rebuilding was undertaken by the present Nawang Tenzing Jangpo who is considered as the incarnation of the founder Lama Gulu, an important spiritual leader of the Sherpas. He has established an equation with many trekkers and climbers of all denominations who visit the monastery, which has helped him in finding funds for restoration. With due diligence to the set religious practices, the monastery has been substantially rebuilt. Tibetan painter Tarke-la&#x27;s wall paintings that display the Bodhisattvas or the Buddha decorate the sanctum. In addition, the monks and Sherpa community with help from the Sir Edmund Hillary and Himalayan Trust, the American Himalayan Foundation and many international well-wishers have put in their support in several ways.

Hillary and Tenzing Norgay, an inhabitant of this village, were the first to reach the summit of Mount Everest on the British 1953 expedition and thereafter this monastery has acquired more international interest, as it is on the route to the base camp of Everest for routes made via the Khumbu icefall and west ridge. Everest expeditioners visit the monastery to light candles and seek the blessings of gods for good health and safe mountaineering.

John Hunt, the leader of the 1953 expedition and one of the first mountaineers to visit the monastery (most, but not all, previous expeditions approached the mountain from the northern (Tibetan) side), offered the following description of Thengboche in &quot;The Ascent of Everest&quot;:

The rebuilt monastery was formally consecrated in 1993 and is considered as the gateway to Mount Everest. The religious room of the Guru Rimpoche in the monastery was fully restored in September 2008. The entrance gate has also been rebuilt with funds provided by the Greater Himalayas Foundation based in Washington, D.C., United States.

The monastery is now said to be home to 60 monks, reflecting its financial prosperity. However, it is also said that fewer and fewer young boys join as monks as they prefer to work in mountaineering or trekking-related activities.

English adventurer Charlie Boorman and Peter Hillary, son of Edmund Hillary visited the village in 2008. The footage was shown in Boorman&#x27;s series &quot;By Any Means&quot;.

==Geography and climate==
Tengboche is located on a hill at the confluence of the Dudh Kosi and the Imja Khola rivers. It lies in Solukhumbu district to the north east of Kathmandu on the Nepal – Tibet border. It is inhabited by sherpas (&#x27;sherpa&#x27; literally means the &quot;easterner&quot;) who migrated from Tibet six hundred years ago. It is approached by a mountain trail from Namche, the nearest airport in Lukla () connecting to Kathmandu. It is about two days of trekking from Lukla. However, considering acclimatization needs for the high altitude climbing, a four-day trekking is generally preferred. This trail crosses initially the Dudh Kosi () river and a further climb leads to the Tengboche monastery at altitude. However, a down hill trek leads to Devouche, the nunnery. During the winter, the snow peaks of Ama Dablam, the tip of the Everest that glows from the Nuptse ridge and several other peaks form a picturesque landscape. 

Tengboche is a midway station on the trail to the base camp for the mountain climbers of Mount Everest and other peaks of over elevation; all these areas form part of the entire Khumbu region up to Tibet border with an area of encompassing Sagarmatha National Park. In the Khumbu region of Nepal, the monastery is strategically placed on the way to Everest base camp and thus attracts large number of tourists from all parts of the world. During the spring season, hill slopes around Tengboche are covered with flowering rhododendrons.

===Climate===
Tengboche has a Subarctic climate (Köppen classification: Dwc) bordering on Tundra climate (ET). Summers are cool and wet, with significant rainfall, while winters are cold and dry. There is high diurnal temperature variation due to the high elevation.

==Culture==

===Monastery===
The current monastery is constructed with stone masonry. The courtyard and storerooms are large to facilitate the monks&#x27; religious rites and activities. The main building has the mandatory Dokhang, the prayer hall, where a large statue of Shakyamuni Buddha is deified. The statue extends to two floors of the monastery and encompasses the Ser sang lha khang, the first floor shrine room. Sakyamuni Buddha is flanked by Manjushri, the deity of wisdom and Maitreya and of the future Buddha. The scriptures of the Kangyur, the original teachings of the Buddha translated into Tibetan are also part of the sanctum.

The rebuilt monastery is large and an impressive structure with a camping area in its front and a number of lodges. Tengboche is surrounded by ancient mani stones (flat stones inscribed with the mantra, &quot;Om Mane Padme Hum&quot;), prayer flags flying atop the high peaks (flags are flown in 5 colours denoting the five Buddhist elements: earth, wind, fire, water and consciousness.
Tengboche is also the terminus site of the &quot;Sacred Sites Trail Project&quot; of the Sagarmatha National Park that attracts large number of tourists for trekking and mountaineering. It is a circular trail that covers 10 monasteries in a clockwise direction terminating in the Tengboche Monastery.

A small nunnery, administered by the Tengboche, named Devoche or Debuche Nunnery is also located in the area.

Mani Rimdu is one of the most fascinating Buddhist festival observed every year in Everest Region, usually in November (date fixed by lunar calendar) in Tengboche monastery. This is the festival of Sherpa people celebrated during the autumn at Tengboche Monastery in the Everest region. Lamas and Sherpa gather at the monastery for five days – ‘for the good of the world’. One can witness different kinds of acts, plays, masked dances, prayers and feasts. Demons are quelled and the pious are rewarded. The festival is very colorful and ideal to combine with a trekking expedition in the Everest region.

Mani Rimdu is a re-creation of legendary events; the establishment of Buddhism in Tibet by the great saint, Guru Rimpoche (Padmasambhava). Through the dances, symbolic demons are conquered, dispelled, or converted to Dharma Protectors, as positive forces clash with those of chaos. The dances convey Buddhist teachings on many levels – from the simplest to the most profound – for those who do not have the opportunity to study and meditate extensively.

===Cultural centre===
Tengboche and the Tengboche Monastery complex built around the village are considered the oldest Sherpa celibate monastery. Sherpas (Sherpas are Tibetans who migrated from Tibet and settled in this region of Nepal about 450 years ago) who form the main social community of the region were a pastoral, agricultural and trading community. However, with closing of the border with China in 1960 in response to a refugee influx, the trading activity with Nepal ceased resulting in changes in the living style of the Sherpas. They adapted to mountaineering and tourism activity as result of large influx of trekkers from various parts of the world. The Sherpas found it an economically attractive vocation. This forced them to remain away from their village and community for 8 months in year, changed their life styles resulting in erosion of their traditional arts and culture. The head lama of the Tengboche Monastery and other community members therefore established a &#x27;Cultural Center&#x27; at Tengboche to strengthen the social and cultural values of the Sherpas. The Center, set up with community participation, was built in traditional Sherpa style. The Centre has a Museum/Library, which has rare sacred Buddhist texts and artefacts, crafts and clothing (donated by community members) and also the Monks&#x27; Residence.

==Economy==

Tengboche has no road network, approach is only by trekking and consequently the living conditions in the village are abnormally expensive. Many tourists visit the village as part of their trekking route and it provides the main approach to the base camp for the national and international mountaineering community who trek to Mt. Everest and other mountains in the Kumbu region. It is reported that only 50 monks and five families permanently live in the Tengboche village. However, in the short span of 5 tourist months, thousands of tourists and trekkers visit (25,000 tourists were reported during 1999) the Sagarmatha National Park and village has numerous buildings of accommodation for guests. On their way to the high altitude trekking, it is recommended tourists spend two days in Tengboche for acclimatization before undertaking the High altitude trekking or mountaineering to the Himalayan peaks. Consequently, this puts heavy burden on the village community and on the Monastery administration, particularly on the meagre facilities of water, electricity, food and sanitation available in the village.

To improve the economy of the village and the Tengboche Monastic community, a practical solution has been evolved by setting up the Tengboche Development Project, which concentrates on the services to be provided in Tengboche, more used by the tourists, such as water and sanitation. To sustain the economic conditions in the village, which largely caters to the trekkers from various parts of the world, tourists and trekkers have been urged to offer donations to the Tengboche Development Project. Funds made available would enable employing the local people in various development activities. However, help in respect of special skills such as in the Eco-Center or medical herb plantation activities would still be required. Sherpas (meaning the &quot;easterner&quot;), form the majority community in the village and in the Kumbu region, and they are closely involved in the form of support services for mountaineering in the region following the first successful expedition of one of their community Tenzing Norgay to the Mt. Everest Peak along with Edmund Hillary.

<text>Mavka ( ) also Nyavka () is a type of female spirit in Ukrainian folklore and mythology. The Mavka is a long-haired figure, a Soul of the Forest, typically depicted as temptress figures who lure men to their deaths.

== Terminology ==
There is variation in the names and spelling, including , , , , , . However, depending on telling, there are differences between the Mavka and Nyavka. These terms all derive from , and are cognate with , (plural).

== Folklore ==
The spirits known by this term represented the souls of girls who had died unnatural, tragic or premature deaths, particularly unchristened babies. s often appear in the form of beautiful young girls who entice and lure young men into the woods, where they &quot;tickle&quot; them to death. s have no reflection in water, nor do they cast shadows. In some accounts, they were also said to help farmers by looking after cattle and driving out wild animals. 

A subtype of the Mavkas are the Nyavkas, which behave the same except for having &quot;no back&quot;, meaning that their spine and some other insides can be seen; the most defining feature between determining Mavkas and Nyavkas is whether or not the insides are visible from the back.

Mavkas and Nyavkas were believed to live in groups in forests, mountain caves, or sheds, which they decorated with rugs. They made thread of stolen flax and wove thin transparent cloth for making clothes for themselves. They loved flowers, which they wore in their hair. In the spring, they planted flowers in the mountains, to which they enticed young men, whom they tickled to death. On Pentecost (known as &#x27;s Easter, ), they held games, dances, and orgies. A demon accompanied them on a flute or pipes. 

To save an unchristened baby&#x27;s soul, one must throw up a kerchief during Pentecost holidays, say their name and add &quot;I baptise you&quot;. The rescued soul would then go to heaven. If the soul lived up to seven years and did not go to heaven, the baby would turn into a and haunt the earth.

== Popular culture ==
* s are depicted in literature, most notably in Lesia Ukrainka&#x27;s &quot;The Forest Song&quot; and nyavkas are depicted in Mykhailo Kotsiubynsky&#x27;s &quot;Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors&quot;.
* In modern culture the Ukrainian music band, Mavka, is named after the mythological creature.
* In 2022, Ukrainian singer Eria released the song &quot;Mavka&quot;.
* The 2023 film &quot;,&quot; is based on Ukrainian mythology.

<text>The Neuri or Navari (; ) were an ancient Slavic or Baltic people whose existence was recorded by ancient Graeco-Roman authors.

==Identification==
The Neuri belonged to a group of northern European peoples of unknown origin, but most researches propose an ethnic group ancestral to the Slavic, Baltic or larger Balto-Slavic peoples.

The Neuri lived in the region corresponding to present-day Belarus, in the territory including the Desna, Pripyat, and middle Dnieper rivers. To the south, the territory of the Neuri reached the upper section of the Southern Buh river.

The neighbours of the Neuri to the east of the Dnieper river were the Androphagi, the Melanchlaeni, and the Budini as well as Finno-Ugric peoples. Their neighbours were the Agathyrsi to the south-west, and the Scythian tribe of the Aroteres to the south-east.

==History==
The Neuri were independent of the Scythians.

According to Herodotus of Halicarnassus, the Neuri once had to leave their country because of an invasion of snakes.

When the Persian Achaemenid king Darius I attacked the Scythians in 513 BC, the Scythian king Idanthyrsus summoned the kings of the peoples surrounding his kingdom to a meeting to decide how to deal with the Persian invasion. The kings of the Budini, Gelonians and Sarmatians accepted to help the Scythians against the Persian attack, while the kings of the Agathyrsi, Androphagi, Melanchlaeni, Neuri, and Tauri refused to support the Scythians.

During the campaign, the Scythians and the Persian army pursuing them passed through the territories of the Melanchlaeni, Androphagi, and Neuri, before they reached the borders of the Agathyrsi, who refused to let the Scythian divisions to pass into their territories and find refuge there, thus forcing the Scythians to return to Scythia with the Persians pursuing them.

===Legacy===
The Neuri may have left traces of their presence in the region of the Desna, Pripyat, and middle Dnieper rivers in the form of Baltic-derived hydronyms and typonyms which pre-date the migration of Slavic peoples into this area. However, the presumed etymology of the tribal name, as well as other linguistic evidence, suggests that their legacy may be continued in the Slavic zone. 

==Society==
===Culture===
According to the Greek author Herodotus of Halicarnassus, the Neuri followed Scythian customs. This claim might have referred only to the southernmost sections of the Neuri, who were neighbours of the Scythian Aroteres tribe.

Herodotus also claimed that the Neuri &quot;seemed to be magicians,&quot; and that all members of their tribe would allegedly each year transform themselves into wolves for some days before being restored to their human form. This might suggest that the Neuri performed cults in which they wore wolf skins and masks, and that the wolf might have been a totem animal of this tribe.

==Archaeology==
The Neuri archaeologically correspond to the Milograd culture.

The southernmost of part of the Milograd culture, which adjoined the territory of the Scythian Aroteres, included many Scythian elements.

<text>In Slavic mythology, notsnitsa (, , , , , , , ), often referred in plural, is a nightmare spirit or demon that torments people and especially children at night. Other names for notsnitsa in East Slavic languages include kriksy, plaksy, plachky, plaksivicy, kriksy-varaksy, kriksy-plaksy, night hag, night maiden.

==Folklore==
In Russian and Slovak folklore, notsnitsa are known to torment children at night, and a stone with a hole in the center is said to be a protection from nocnitsa. Mothers in some regions will place a knife in their children&#x27;s cradles or draw a circle around the cradles with a knife for protection. This is possibly based on the belief that supernatural beings cannot touch iron.

Nocnitsa is known to sit on one&#x27;s chest, drawing &quot;life energy&quot;. Because of this, many refer to nocnitsa as a type of vampire. Nocnitsa will often continue visiting. According to some folklore, night hags visit when one sleeps on one&#x27;s back, with the hands on the chest (a position allegedly called &quot;sleeping with the dead&quot;). According to some folklore, night hags are made of shadow. She might also have a horrible screeching voice. She might allegedly also smell of the moss and dirt from her forest of origin.

Nocnitsa is linked to the common apparition seen during the hypnagogic state of sleep.

==In popular culture==
* A creature, considered by the characters to be a nocnitsa, is depicted in a 2017 horror movie &quot;Slumber&quot;.
* There is a nocnitsa in the supernatural novel &quot;Night Terror&quot; by John Passarella.

* In the book &quot;Coraline&quot;, by Neil Gaiman, a Nocnitsa poses as Coraline&#x27;s alternate dimension mother. Coraline, however, has a stone with a hole in it which protects her.

* It is often believed throughout the Middle East that this mythological creature came into people&#x27;s homes at night, and would watch their children sleep if they did not behave.

* In the Iron Druid Chronicles book &quot;Staked Protagonist&quot;, Granuaile MacTiernan alongside Slavic Thunder God Perun and the Orisha Shango are attacked by a group of Nocnitsa.

<text>In Slavic mythology (in particular Czech, Slovak, Russian, Belarusian and Ukrainian), the Raróg () or Raróh () is a fire demon, often depicted as a fiery falcon.

According to Czech folklore, a raroh can hatch from an egg that was incubated on a stove for nine days and nights, and can appear either as a fiery falcon or a dragon. In Polish folklore, the rarog is a tiny bird that can be held in a pocket, and can bring people happiness.

A caldera on Jupiter&#x27;s moon Io was named Rarog Patera, a massive eruption from which was recorded by the W. M. Keck Observatory and Japan&#x27;s HISAKI (SPRINT-A) spacecraft on August 15, 2013.

The northern cardinal-shaped logo of the Polish video game company CD Projekt is called the Raróg.

<text> (, plural: strzygi, masculine: strzygoń) is usually a female demon in Slavic mythology, which stems from the mythological Strix of ancient Rome and ancient Greece. The demon is similar to a vampire, and is predominantly found in Polish and Silesian folklore.

==Origin==
According to Aleksander Brückner, the word is derived from Strix, Latin for owl and a bird-like creature which fed on human flesh and blood in Roman and Greek mythology. It is unclear how the word was adapted by the Polish people, though it might have been through the Balkan peoples. The term could also sometimes mean a vampire or &quot;upiór&quot;. After the 18th century, there was a distinction between and upiór; the first one was more connected to witchcraft, while the latter was more of a flying, vampiric creature.

The remained a popular element in the folklore of rural Poland well into the late 19th and early 20th century, as shown by Władysław Reymont in his Nobel Prize-winning novel &quot;Chłopi&quot; (The Peasants). Its story takes place during the 1880s in Congress Poland and follows the everyday life of the peasantry in a typical Polish village. In the tenth chapter of book two, some of the characters gather together to exchange stories and legends, in one of which the striga is described as having a bat&#x27;s wings (&quot;strzygi z nietoperzowymi skrzydłami przelatują&quot;).

==Beliefs==

A is a usually female demon similar to vampire in Slavic (and especially Polish) folklore. People who were born with two hearts and two souls, and two sets of teeth (the second one barely visible) were believed to be strzygi. Somnambulics or people without armpit hair could also be seen as ones. Furthermore, a newborn child with already developed teeth was also believed to be one. When a person was identified as a , they were chased away from human dwelling places. During epidemics, people were getting buried alive, and those who managed to get out of their graves, often weak, ill and with mutilated hands, were said to be strzygi by others. It is said that strzygi usually died at a young age, but, according to belief, only one of their two souls would pass to the afterlife; the other soul was believed to cause the deceased to come back to life and prey upon other living beings. These undead creatures were believed to fly at night in a form of an owl and attack night-time travelers and people who had wandered off into the woods at night, sucking out their blood and eating their insides. were also believed to be satisfied with animal blood, for a short period of time. According to the other sources, strzygi were believed not to harm people but to herald someone&#x27;s imminent death. In this, they resemble Banshees.

=== Methods of protection ===
When a person believed to be a died, decapitating the corpse and burying the head separate from the rest of the body was believed to prevent the from rising from the dead; burying the body face down with a sickle around its head was believed to work as well. Other methods of protection from the (some similar to those from vampires) included:

* Burning the body
* Hammering nails, stakes etc. into various parts of the &#x27;s body
* Putting a flint into its mouth after exhumation
* Pealing the church bells (the then turns into tar)
* Slapping it across the face with one&#x27;s left hand
* Burying it again, outside of the village, and pinning it down with a big rock
*Scattering poppy seeds in the shape of the cross in every corner of the house
*Exhumation in the presence of a priest and burying the body again, after additional rituals (such as putting a piece of paper with the word &quot;Jesus&quot; written on it under the &#x27;s tongue)
*Putting small objects in the &#x27;s grave to make it count them.

<text>Utopiec (plural &quot;Utopce&quot;), [[Vodník]] or Topnik is a name applied to Slavic spirits of water. The &quot;utopce&quot; are spirits of human souls that died drowning, residing in the element of their own demise. They are responsible for sucking people into swamps and lakes as well as killing the animals standing near the still waters.

Slavonic water spirits of the drowned dead remained a popular element of rural Polish folklore at the turn of the 19th and 20th century, as shown by Władysław Reymont in his Nobel Prize-winning novel &quot;Chłopi&quot; (The Peasants). Its story takes place during the 1880s in Congress Poland and follows the everyday life of the peasantry in a typical Polish village. In the tenth chapter of book two, some of the characters gather together to exchange stories and legends, in one of which the &quot;topielica&quot; (feminine form of &quot;topielec&quot;) is mentioned.

A more recent example of the &quot;utopiec&quot; in Polish popular culture is the comic book series Lil and Put, where the two titular characters are constantly at odds with an Utopiec living in a pond next to their village. He is never directly seen and possesses magical powers.

Utopiec is the official Polish translation of the &quot;Drowned&quot;, a monster and hostile entity from the video game Minecraft.

<text>In Slavic mythology, vodyanoy (; lit. &#x27;[he] from the water&#x27; or &#x27;watery&#x27;) is a water spirit. In Czech and Slovak fairy tales, he is called vodník (or in Germanized form: ), and often referred to as &quot;Wassermann&quot; in German sources. In Ukrainian fairy tales, he is called “водяник“ (vodyanyk).

He may appear to be a naked man with a pot belly (and bald-headed) wearing a hat and belt of reeds and rushes, conflicting with other accounts ascribing him green hair and a long green beard. The varying look has been attributed in commentary to his shape-shifting ability. When angered, the vodyanoy breaks dams, washes down water mills, and drowns people and animals. Consequently, fishermen, millers, and also bee-keepers make sacrifices to appease him. The vodyanoy would sometimes drag people down to his underwater dwelling to serve him as slaves.

The &quot;vodník&quot; in Czechia or Slovakia were said to use colored ribbons (sometimes impersonating peddlers, but also tying them to grass, etc., as lures in the landscape) to attract humans near water in order to snatch them.

== Russia ==
In Russia, the &quot;vodyanoy&quot; is sometimes called the &#x27; (, &quot;Water-Grandfather&quot;) or &#x27; ().

=== Habitat ===
He is said to dwell in a slough (), kettle hole (), or a whirlpool of a river, pond or lake, and liked especially to live near a watermill. One that dwells in marshlands may be called a &quot;bolotnyanik&quot; ().

=== Appearance ===

His usual appearance is that of a naked old man with a fat paunch of a belly and swollen face according to the Russian folklore collector, but a later English commentary using similar phraseology insisted the creature was not nude but bald, and concatenates additional commentary from the Russian source which says he is seen naked but covered in slime (), wearing a high ) made of green &quot;club-rush&quot; (or other sedges) and a green belt of that same &quot;grass&quot;.

He is also described as an old man with green hair and (long) green beard The green beard turns white with when the moon wanes, as the immortal Vodyanoy ages or rejuvenates with the phases of the moon.

Or, rather than wearing plant-based clothing, a different source states he is covered in weeds and slime, and is scaly-skinned in his true form. Or rather a figure of giant stature covered in grass and moss. Or be &quot;quite black with enormous red eyes and a nose as long as a fisherman&#x27;s boot&quot;. Or that he is human-faced, but has huge toes, paws instead of hands, long horns, a tail, and eyes that burn like red-hot coals.

He has the capability of shape-shifting. and this has been suggested as an explanation of its varied descriptions. He may crawl out of water in the dark of the night and comb his (green) hair on shore, but he can also appear in the form of a naked woman combing her hair. He may be heard all along the shore while he is slapping the water with his palm (, or paw) on moonlit nights.

He can appear as a giant moss-covered fish, a log or even a flying tree-trunk with small-wings, skimming over the water&#x27;s surface.

=== Offering and boon ===
Since he tampers with the waterwheel, the dikes, or control of water if he is not pleased, an operator of a mill must know how to have a good relationship with him. When a watermill is built, a sacrifice of pig, cattle, sheep, or even human (or a chicken) must be made to appease the vodyanik. There are reported cases of watermills destroyed by him (at Lake Ilmen for instance), and may drown a person as forewarned.

The fisherman can also benefit from the boon of the vodyanoy, receiving a bountiful harvest in their fishing nets. He may receive this reward after returning a child which was accidentally netted. The fishermen offer sacred libation, especially melted butter or oil () into the river.

There seems to have been a cult recognizing vodyanoy as a patron saint of bee-keeping, as evidenced by the old custom of bagging the first swarm of bees and sacrificing it in water. And the bee-keeper wishing for a bounty of honey would choose the midnight hour of the feast days of Saints Zosimus and Sabbatius and dip a honeycomb into the water by the mill, while pronouncing an incantation.

He will also foretell the coming harvest. He comes into the village disguised as human, but the edge of his coat () will be visibly wet, and gives himself away. If he buys corn (grain) at a high price it forewarns spike in market price, i.e., crop failure. But if he buys at low price, the bread will remain cheap.

=== Mount ===
The vodyanik &quot;owns&quot; all the fish and aquatic creatures, and his control over them explains his ability to deliver fish. The vodyanik selects in particular the sheatfish (; &quot;Silurus glanis&quot;, aka &quot;wels catfish&quot;) as his mount to ride on. But he will catch the farmers&#x27; cattle or horses (in water) and ride them till they drop dead in the wetlands. The farmer fording his livestock will make a sign of cross (emblem of Perun&#x27;s weapon) over the river as protection from this happening.

=== Attacks on humans ===
The vodyanoy also posed risk of attacking people entering bodies of water, hence popular belief was to make the sign of the cross before swimming or bathing in such waters. An anecdote tells about a hunter trying to retrieve his duck, and the attack left the creature&#x27;s finger-marks on his neck. In Ukraine, children were instructed to chant a certain rhyme before going bathing/swimming.

=== Family ===
He is known to take on a wife (or wives), and espouses &quot;water-nymphs or drowned and unhappy girls who have been cursed by their fathers or mothers&quot;. According to Afanasyev, the &quot;water-nymph&quot; (&quot;water-maiden&quot;) is known by various names in Russia, including the &quot;rusalka&quot;.

It is believed that vodyanoys have a ruler: the Tsar Vodyanik, or the Vodyan Tsar. He is described as an old man armed with a club, who can rise to the sky sitting on a black cloud and create new rivers and lakes.

== Other folklores ==
The Russian &quot;vodyanoy&quot; answers to Czech (and Slovak) &quot;vodník&quot;, Slovene (&quot;water-man&quot;), and Polish &quot;topielec&quot; (&quot;Drowner&quot;).

These water demons of West and South Slavic lore are similar to the East Slavic (Russian, Ukrainian, etc.) conception, though there are certain differences. The Czech and Slovak &quot;vodníci&quot; (plural of &quot;vodník&quot;) can also take on an appearance of ordinary humans, but often with water dripping from their clothing, which makes their false identity easily discernable. But their version says the demon, sometimes impersonating peddlers, use colored ribbons to lure humans. Some accounts give them green color, and also long hair or beard in Slovak versions. There is an isolated Czech example of the water-demon being human-like but transforming into frog, but the water-demon&#x27;s wife being froglike is commonplace. A widely known tale type of &quot;vodník&quot; or wife hiring a woman as godmother or housekeeper tale is found in Czech and Slovak versions.

Czech, Slovenian and Slovak tales have both evil and good watermen (relative to human beings) who do (or don&#x27;t, respectively) try to drown people when they happen to swim in their territory. Vodníci would store the souls of the drowned inside pots, and the liberated souls can ascend to heaven, or even revive.

== Czech ==

The Bohemian male water demon came to be called &quot;vodník&quot; or , but their ancient names have not been found in older sources. It dwells in every river, stream, or pond. Though several may share a body of water, they keep themselves apart since they are antagonistic towards each other. Sometimes the &quot;vodník&quot; enters into a loving relationship with a human woman, and will live together with the family he has formed, but otherwise the bachelors are solitary. Those in the pond are considered more feral, living amongst the reeds, but those in the river are believed to live in crystal palaces in a whole expansive world found underwater, where they keep the souls of the drowned dead, inside pots.

There are also a tale and a legend concerning the &quot;hastermann&quot; or &quot;vodnik&quot; living near mills.

=== Physical description ===
The net-casting &quot;vodník&quot; (cf. below) is described as a green man, and comes out of the water combing his green hair on a day he does not hunt drowning victims. But in several accounts he manifests himself as an ordinary human being (cf. ), or the peddler by the pond north of Přeštice, wearing a dripping wet coat. He is known as the &quot;green man&quot; at the market, appearing like an ordinary man wearing a green coat, with the left coat-tip () always wet, and also missing the thumb on his left hand. The merchants welcome him because when he makes purchases, business does well.

=== Man-snatching ===
The &quot;vodník&quot; lures people into the water to drown them, and those who bathe after hours are especially vulnerable, but he can only drown those who were fated to die that way. Fishermen were afraid of saving a drowning man from the clutches of a vodník, because they would come in a bad way and wind up being drowned themselves.

In one version the water demon spans a fine invisible net across the river to trap people. But he sits in the grass mending his nets on Friday, his day off from man-snatching.

The peddler &quot;vodník&quot; displays some sort of trinkets hanging on a rack in order to lure his prey into water. Most especially the peddler () &quot;vodník&quot; uses the colorful ribbon (, pl. ; or its dim. to lure humans, according to numerous accounts. In Quarter of Prague, the vodník was seen on a raft (, pl. locative &quot;vorách&quot;) in the evenings, and he hangs a red ribbons over the water to lure children and drag them down. A vodník in the guise of a red-haired man wearing green peddled green ribbons to a village woman, but the goods turned into grass when she returned home.

The &quot;vodník&quot; or &quot;hastrmann&quot; maintains a collection of captured souls inside pots in his underwater palace or mansion, as in the tale localized in Moldautein (Týn nad Vltavou), here specified as &quot;earthenware&quot; () pots also filled with water. Here a poor day-laborer woman&#x27;s eldest daughter becomes the Hastermann&#x27;s servant, and when she sweeps, the dust she collects is gold. She liberates a soul from a noisy jar, which turns out to be her brother. She is forgiven, but after serving many years, homesickness hardens her decision to flee, and she frees all the souls on departure. The hastrmann pursues but she returns home to her siblings.

=== As frogs ===
In a Bohemian version of the butcher tale, a man from Předměřice was really a vodník, regularly shopping from a butcher at Tuřice, but the out-of-town man&#x27;s habit of pointing the finger at the piece of meat he wanted annoyed the butcher into cutting a finger off one day. But two days later, he was taking the valley path along the Iser (Jizera) and encountered a huge frog which the curious butcher, but it turned into the client he maimed and dragged the butcher into water.

 recorded a tale about the pregnant wife of a vodník () in frog form, which compelled a housekeeper named Liduška to be its child&#x27;s godmother, though this tale type has been discussed elsewhere as a widely disseminated piece of Slovak folklore (see under §Slovakia). In this Moravian version (but recorded in Bohemian dialect[?]), the vodník returns from his absence in the guise of a red ribbon (), attempting to lure and snatch Liduška, just as he is wont to do with girls with rakes haymaking on meadows by the river.

But in Jungbunzlau (Mladá Boleslav) it was rumored the water demon maintained two castles on the Iser (Jizera), one by the mill, and other by the brickhouse. At mill was seen a vodník who was completely green, and covered with filamentous green algae; at the other abode was seen the vodník&#x27;s wife, half maiden, half fish.

== Slovakia ==
In Slovakia, the same water demon may be called meaning &quot;water guy&quot; or &quot;waterman&quot;. The water spirit may also be called a (var. ). There is a story of a localized in a lake in the forest of Dolný Kubín in Orava, where a peasant encounters a waterman (from a lake in Kriváň (village)) pursuing another waterman who stole his wife, guiding him to the lake of the perpetrator. The peasant watches as an underwater fight ensues, culminating in bubbling froth turning red, signaling a bad outcome, and the peasant flees as forewarned.

Slovakian folklore also speak of the vodník&#x27;s pot (), attested in the former Trencsén County (now Trenčín Region or District), and anecdotally, in the northwestern village of (now attached to Budča) a stream was home to a (&quot;aquatic&quot; man) who purchased pots to trap souls inside.

=== Appearances ===
Also according to Boky lore, the vodník had a long beard, and would be naked one moment, then be wearing a blouse () dripping water from its side. Some say a vodník can be identified because the left side of his coat () is always dripping wet. Some ascribe long flowing hair, or blazing eyes as large as dishes (). It allegedly appeared out of the stream in the form of a &quot;little green boy&quot;, according to one witness.

The boatmen on the Váh claim to have witnessed the vodník looking like a man with the head of a black ram, though another that was spotted had green hair and clothing.

The vodník are said to employ ribbons to lure humans (as in Czech regions), according to lore found in the Bratislava area and Nitra in western Slovakia.

=== Frog wives ===
The wife of a vodník () is said to have the appearance of a frog. There is an anecdote of one that transformed into a frog and went to the home of the plowman () where it was feasted, then entertained him in her own abode. In a more intricate but widespread tale, the froglike being with a swollen belly is met by a woman washing in the river Hron, who offers to be the godmother of the unborn child. A servant (drowned man) arrives with news a girl was born, and conveys the godmother to the vodník&#x27;s home, hidden under the stairs beneath river boulder, which the man splits open with a magic wand. The vodník&#x27;s wife instructs the woman to sweep and take home the sweepings (which later turn out to be gold and silver), but not to touch the covered pots. The godmother disobeys and overturns a pot revealing a soul had been captured inside. Then in a double pot she finds the soul of her two drowned children, who tells her they were thus captured by the vodník and could not ascend to heaven. She takes her children&#x27;s souls in the pot and makes an escape; thereafter, the river throws up the children&#x27;s bodies, and they breathe back to life.

This tale type is classed as ATU subtype 476* &quot;In the Frog House&quot;, where the type example is a Hungarian folktale, which was incorrectly given as the only variant in the original 1961 publication of the index, but later revised with the listing of Bulgarian and Polish cognate tales, and Slovene and other comparisons as well.

== Companion spirits ==

=== Bolotnik ===

Bolotnik () is the owner of the swamp. He is often considered a relative of the vodyanoy and the leshy. There are many descriptions of him, but most often he was imagined as an old man with long green beard and his body covered in fish scales and algae. The bolotnik is dangerous, and he would pose an especially huge threat to those who play shepherd&#x27;s pipe at night. In order to lure the person to the swamp, he would parody the sounds of various animals, create wandering lights and grow intoxicating plants. This spirit is often said to be a loner, although in some beliefs he has a wife, a bolotnitsa.

=== Vodyanitsa ===
Vodyanitsa () is a beautiful green-haired water maiden, and she is often said to be the wife of a vodyanoy. This spirit sometimes appears in the form of a golden-finned fish or a white swan. Vodyanitsy (plural: ) prefer forested lakes, mill ponds, wells and (less commonly) seas as their habitat. They are considered harmless spirits, although sometimes they tear the nets and spoil the millstones; the sea vodyanitsy are more aggressive than freshwater ones and are dangerous to ships. According to some beliefs, the main difference between the vodyanitsa and other water spirits is that she is a baptized drowned girl. The term is often used synonymously for &quot;rusalka&quot;.

<text>Mat Zemlya (Matka Ziemia or Matushka Zeml&#x27;ja) is the Moist (or Water) Earth Mother and is probably the oldest deity in Slavic mythology besides Marzanna. She is also called Mati Syra Zemlya meaning &quot;Mother Damp Earth&quot; or &quot;Mother Moist Earth&quot;. Her identity later blended into that of Mokosh.

==Mythology==
In the early Middle Ages, Mati Syra Zemlya was one of the most important deities in the Slavic world. Slavs made oaths by touching the Earth, and sins were confessed into a hole in the Earth before death. She was worshipped in her natural form and was not given a human personage or likeness. Since the adoption of Christianity in all Slavic lands, she has been identified with Mary, the mother of Jesus.

An example of her importance is seen in this traditional invocation to Matka Ziema, made with a jar of hemp oil:

::East – &quot;Mother Earth, subdue every evil and unclean being so that he may not cast a spell on us nor do us any harm.&quot;
::West – &quot;Mother Earth, engulf the unclean power in thy boiling pits, and in thy burning fires.&quot; 
::South – &quot;Mother Earth, calm the winds coming from the South and all bad weather. Calm the moving sands and whirlwinds.&quot;
::North – &quot;Mother Earth, calm the North winds and clouds, subdue the snowstorms and the cold.&quot;
::The jar, which held the oil, is buried after each invocation and offering is made at each Quarter. (Slavonic mythology 1977:287)

Old Slavic beliefs seem to attest some awareness of an ambivalent nature of the Earth: it was considered men&#x27;s cradle and nurturer during one&#x27;s lifetime, and, when the time of death came, it would open up to receive their bones, as if it were a &quot;return to the womb&quot;.

The imagery of the &quot;terre humide&quot; (&quot;moist earth&quot;) also appears in funeral lamentations either as a geographical feature (as in Lithuanian and Ukrainian lamentations) or invoked as &quot;Mère-Terre humide&quot; (&quot;Mother Moist Earth&quot;).

==Cultic practices==
Up until World War I and the fall of the Russian Empire, peasant women would perform a rite to prevent against plague by plowing a furrow around the village and calling on the protection of the Earth spirits by shrieking.

==Related characters==
The Slavic &quot;bogatyr&quot; Mikula Selyaninovich, or Mikula the Villager, is closely connected with Mat Zemlya.

<text>Howard Henry Baker Jr. (November 15, 1925 June 26, 2014) was an American politician, diplomat and photographer who served as a United States Senator from Tennessee from 1967 to 1985. During his tenure, he rose to the rank of Senate Minority Leader and then Senate Majority Leader. A member of the Republican Party, Baker was the first Republican to be elected to the U.S. Senate in Tennessee since the Reconstruction era.

Known in Washington, D.C., as the &quot;Great Conciliator&quot;, Baker was often regarded as one of the most successful senators in terms of brokering compromises, enacting legislation, and maintaining civility. For example, he had a lead role in the fashioning and passing of the Clean Air Act of 1970 with Democratic senator Edmund Muskie. A moderate conservative, he was also respected by his Democratic colleagues.

Baker sought the Republican presidential nomination in 1980 but dropped out after the first set of primaries. From 1987 to 1988, he served as White House Chief of Staff for President Ronald Reagan. From 2001 to 2005, he was the United States Ambassador to Japan.

==Early life==
Baker was born on November 15, 1925, in Huntsville, Tennessee, to Dora Ladd Baker and Howard Baker Sr. His father served as a Republican member of the US House of Representatives from 1951 to 1964, representing Tennessee&#x27;s Second District. Baker attended The McCallie School in Chattanooga, and after graduating, he attended Tulane University in New Orleans. Baker was an alumnus of the Alpha Sigma Chapter of the Pi Kappa Phi fraternity. During World War II, he trained at a U.S. Navy facility on the campus of the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee, in the V-12 Navy College Training Program. He served as a lieutenant in the United States Navy and graduated from the University of Tennessee College of Law in 1949. That year, he was admitted to the Tennessee bar and began his law practice.

==Senate career==
Baker began his political career in 1964, when he lost to the liberal Democrat Ross Bass in a U.S. Senate election to fill the unexpired term of the late Senator Estes Kefauver. However, Baker only lost by 4.7% points, the closest that a Republican had come to being popularly elected to the Senate from Tennessee.

In the 1966 United States Senate election in Tennessee, Bass lost the Democratic primary to the Governor of Tennessee, Frank G. Clement, and Baker handily won his Republican primary race against Kenneth Roberts, 112,617 (75.7%) to 36,043 (24.2%). Baker won the general election, capitalizing on Clement&#x27;s failure to energize the Democratic base, especially organized labor. He won by a somewhat larger-than-expected margin of 56% to Clement&#x27;s 44%. Baker thus became the first Republican U.S. senator from Tennessee since the Reconstruction era and the first Republican to be popularly elected to the Senate from Tennessee. Baker voted in favor of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 and the nomination of Thurgood Marshall to the Supreme Court of the United States.

Baker was re-elected in 1972 and again in 1978 and served from January 3, 1967, to January 3, 1985. In 1969, he was already a candidate for the Minority Leadership position that opened up with the death of his father-in-law, Everett Dirksen, but Baker was defeated 24–19 by Hugh Scott. At the beginning of the next Congress, in 1971, Baker ran again, losing again to Scott, 24–20.

When Scott retired, Baker was elected as leader of the Senate Republicans in 1977 by his Republican colleagues, defeating Robert Griffin, 19–18. Baker led the Senate GOP for the last eight years of his tenure, serving two terms as Senate Minority Leader from 1977 to 1981, and two terms as Senate Majority Leader from 1981 to 1985, a role he transitioned to after the Republicans gained the majority in the Senate in the 1980 elections.

Baker did not seek further re-election and concluded his Senate career in 1985. He was succeeded by Democratic Representative and future Vice President Al Gore.

==Nixon administration==
President Richard Nixon asked Baker in 1971 to fill one of the two empty seats on the Supreme Court of the United States. When Baker took too long to decide whether he wanted the appointment, Nixon changed his mind and nominated William Rehnquist instead.

===Watergate investigation===
In 1973 and 1974, Baker was the influential ranking minority member of the United States Senate Watergate Committee, chaired by Senator Sam Ervin, which investigated the Watergate scandal. Baker famously asked aloud, &quot;What did the President know and when did he know it?&quot; The question is sometimes attributed to being given to him by his counsel and former campaign manager, future U.S. Senator Fred Thompson.

John Dean, former White House Counsel to Nixon, revealed to Senate Watergate chief counsel Samuel Dash that Baker had &quot;secret dealings&quot; with the White House during the congressional investigation. Although Baker, as a US senator, would be a juror in any future impeachment trial, Baker was recorded, on February 22, 1973, promising Nixon, &quot;I&#x27;m your friend. I&#x27;m going to see that your interests are protected.&quot;

Watergate reporter Bob Woodward wrote that then &quot;both the majority Democrats and minority Republicans agreed to share all information.&quot; Ultimately, one such document shared by Nixon lawyer J. Fred Buzhardt inadvertently suggested the presence of Nixon&#x27;s secret taping system.

==Presidential campaign==
Baker was frequently mentioned by insiders as a possible nominee for Vice President of the United States on a ticket headed by incumbent President Gerald Ford in 1976. According to many sources, Baker was a frontrunner until he disclosed that his wife, Joy, was a recovered alcoholic. Ford, whose own wife, Betty, was an alcoholic (albeit undisclosed at the time), chose Kansas U.S. Senator Bob Dole.

Baker ran for U.S. president in 1980, dropping out of the race for the Republican nomination after losing the Iowa caucuses to George H. W. Bush and the New Hampshire presidential primary to Ronald Reagan even though a Gallup poll had him in second place in the presidential race at 18%, behind Reagan at 41% as late as November 1979. Baker&#x27;s support of the 1978 Panama Canal Treaties was overwhelmingly unpopular, especially among Republicans, and it was a factor in Reagan&#x27;s choosing Bush instead as his running mate. Ted Stevens served as Acting Minority Leader during Baker&#x27;s primary campaign.

==Reagan administration==
In 1984, Baker received the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

In October 1983, Baker voted in favor of the bill establishing Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a federal holiday.

As a testament to Baker&#x27;s skill as a negotiator and an honest and amiable broker, Reagan tapped him to serve as White House Chief of Staff during part of Reagan&#x27;s second term (1987–1988). Many saw that as a move by Reagan to mend relations with the Senate, which had deteriorated somewhat under the previous chief of staff, Donald Regan. In accepting the appointment, Baker chose to skip another bid for the White House in 1988.

==Later life==
President George W. Bush nominated Baker to serve as U.S. ambassador to Japan in March 2001. He was sworn in on June 26 and presented his credentials on July 5. During Baker&#x27;s tenure, Japan supported the US-led Iraq War and implemented an embargo on American beef due to a BSE outbreak. Baker announced his resignation in December 2004 after returning to the United States for open heart surgery in August.

In 2003, the Howard. H. Baker Jr. Center for Public Policy was established at the University of Tennessee to honor him. Vice President Dick Cheney gave a speech at the 2005 ground-breaking ceremony for the center&#x27;s new building. Upon the building&#x27;s completion in 2008, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor assisted in the facility&#x27;s dedication. In 2023, the Baker Center was transformed into the Baker School of Public Policy and Public Affairs, becoming the first school of public policy and public affairs at any public university in Tennessee.

In March 2005, Baker was appointed as a senior advisor to Citigroup.

In 2007, Baker joined fellow former Senate Majority Leaders Bob Dole, Tom Daschle, and George Mitchell to found the Bipartisan Policy Center, a non-profit think tank that works to develop policies suitable for bipartisan support. He was an advisory board member for the Partnership for a Secure America, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to recreating the bipartisan center in American national security and foreign policy. From 2005 to 2011, Baker was a member of the board of directors of the International Foundation for Electoral Systems, a nonprofit that provides international election support.

From 2005 to his death, Baker served as senior counsel to the law firm of his father and his grandfather, Baker Donelson.

Baker was an accomplished lifelong photographer. His photographs have often been exhibited and were published in &quot;National Geographic&quot;, &quot;Life&quot;, and in the books &quot;Howard Baker&#x27;s Washington&quot; (1982), &quot;Big South Fork Country&quot; (1993), and &quot;Scott&#x27;s Gulf: The Bridgestone/Firestone Centennial Wilderness&quot; (2000). In 1993, he received the International Award of the American Society of Photographers, and in 1994, he was elected into the Hall of Fame of the Photo Marketing Association.

==Death==
On June 26, 2014, Baker died at the age of 88 from complications of a stroke that he had suffered a week earlier. He was in his native Huntsville, Tennessee, with his wife, Nancy, by his side.

<text>&#x27; (singular &#x27;) is a form of verbal folk magic in Eastern Slavic folklore and mythology. Users of use incantations to enchant objects or people.

== Etymology ==
The present-day Russian word () corresponds to the English word &quot;conjuration&quot;, which once meant a &#x27;conspiracy, plot, act of plotting&#x27;. (&#x27;what is performed with speech&#x27;) originates from Russian folklore. So does the term (), with its prefix of initiation &quot;na-&quot; and the root &quot;-govor&quot; (&#x27;speech&#x27;), meaning &#x27;what is launched with speech&#x27;.

Their slight difference in sense can be seen in constructions like &quot; from maleficium&quot;/&quot;from bullets&quot; (defensive, apotropaic aspect) and &quot;nagovory onto water&quot; (to make it &quot;healing&quot;). The latter phrase seems to reflect a more offensive action.

The Ukrainian () and Belarusian () are semantically identical to the Russian , as they both possess the root &quot;-mov&quot; (&#x27;speech&#x27;). Both of these East Slavic words are close to the Polish term . Polish folklore retains rudiments of verbal magic as (&#x27;popular healing&#x27;).

== History ==
The practice of arose from pagan prayers and incantations, and so was initially based on the belief in the power of the human word. Hence followed the importance of exact pronunciation of the words (whether whispered or sung) as well as exact observing the associated rites. A great deal of life stamina was obligatory for a performer of the rites. As an example of this, a practitioner should have either a full set of teeth, or a knife as a symbolic substitute for teeth that were missing.

Originally part of the art of a (Cyrillic: ; ), who disappeared during the prosecution of the Eastern Orthodox Church, the tradition survived until the 20th century in popular folk culture, often under the guise of a noncanonical Christian prayer.

In the Russian Empire, praxes were for centuries prosecuted by its church and by its secular, caesaropapist authorities (at least from mid-17th till mid-19th century). Russian archives yielded more than 600 cases of church and civil prosecution of witchcraft, blasphemy and rational heresies in the 18th century. Even in 1832, after Digest of Laws of the Russian Empire had been first codified under the leadership of Mikhail Speransky, witchcraft and sorcery still remained a subject of the secular Penal law.

For the sake of survival tradition began to mimic Christianity. imagery became saturated with Christian themes and motifs, used as a reference base for performing magic acts. However within Byzantine written tradition (which embraced the Southern Slavs cultural intermediation) both Christian orthodoxy and some heterodox manuscripts circulated, which might echo back local heathen concepts.

For example, one of the (apparently influenced by christianization, though representing rather a specific vision) named &quot;how to heal wounds&quot; said &quot;as Jesus Christ having been crucified felt no pain, so may this person I heal feel no pain from any wounds, from any illnesses&quot;.

Another layer in heritage could be of Western origin. Each of the motifs shared by East and West Slavs has West European (mostly Germanic) matches. This indicates that West Slavic charms served as a mediator between the East Slavic tradition and Western influences.

The magical formula &quot;Stop, blood, as still in the wound, as water/Jesus in the Jordan&quot; is an example of a treated person&#x27;s bleeding wound assimilation with a medieval apocryphal story of how the Jordan waters stopped flowing when Jesus entered them. It is attested in Belarus, Ukraine, somewhat rare in South and West Russia. As for other Slavic traditions, the formula occurs in Poland and, even more commonly, in Polish texts recorded in Lithuania; it is also found in Czech charms, though intended against disorders other than bleeding.

Geographically the Eastern Slavic tradition area could be roughly divided into two subareas (with their own subtraditions, correspondingly).

One of them is the tradition of the Russian North and adjoining Central Russian regions. This tradition was less influenced by neighboring cultures through direct contacts, though strongly influenced by the manuscript tradition. As a result it is not too diverse in the composition of plots and motifs. But the most famous plots, motifs and formulas which are considered an authentic feature of Russian (and all East Slavic) (such as the motive of the sacred center, Alatyr stone on Buyan island amid holy sea) seem to come from there.

Within the second tradition, covering most of Ukraine and Belarus, as well as the south and west Russian regions, the West and South Slavic (as well as Byzantine) influence manifested itself to the greatest extent. The result is the coexistence and active interaction of plots, motifs and poetic formulas of different origins.

== Mythological center and assimilation formulas ==

While the idea of the mythological center is totally absent in incantations of West and South Slavs, it is known in the folklore of all East Slavs, especially in Russian tradition of .

In Eastern Slavic folk religion the concept of Navel of the World is embodied by a sacred stone Alatyr (frequently referred as white and hot), located somewhere in the East (either in a pristine (&quot;clear&quot;) field or Buyan island amid a holy sea/ocean).

The Alatyr appears in most of the under a variety of names. Much less than usually it is replaced by a sacred tree (for instance, a willow or a white birch) or a non-specified Christian church.

Appeals to such natural phenomena as dawn with red sun (and Eastern side of the world as such), young (new) moon, stars, winds are also very frequent.

As to personalized phenomena in those mythopoetic texts, one can see that heathen and Christian characters are often interchangeable. For instance, in different versions of the same , the supreme power that a practitioner applies to is either Maria (Mother of God) or &quot;Dawn the Red Maiden&quot; (Zorya).

In some of the a practitioner appeals to Western side of the world for help in maleficium. Nevertheless, the absolute majority of texts focused on good deeds, such as healing people and livestock, attracting luck, love affairs, wedding protection, birth support and public relations. In Western Siberia a was written down, named &quot;for good deeds&quot;, which should have been read thrice around new moon. It said: &quot;...I behold a young crescent with golden horns, give, my God, golden horns to new moon, so give to me, for good deeds...&quot;

Another type of involved love magic &quot;just as doves live in love, so would we with so-and-so do...&quot; The practitioner performing this (recorded in Perm Governorate) had to perform a bird sacrifice: the young man had to catch and stab a dove and knead its fat into dough to bake a kind of a small kalach, which he then had to feed to the girl he loved, saying as he did so the short incantation quoted above.

A recorded in 1648 onto wax named &quot;how to endure a torture&quot; established that &quot;both heaven and earth are made of bast&quot;, and then made a wish &quot;just as the dead in the earth feel nothing, may so-and-so likewise feel no pain from any atrocities, any tortures&quot;.

The most usual beginning of a Russian North was &quot;blessed I rise, setting forth through doors and gates opening to the East, to the Eastern side, to the pristine field, to the sea-ocean, onward to the holy island of God... where lies the stone Alatyr...&quot;

In the middle of the body part the practitioner was seeking to influence was patterned in assimilation with natural or sacred phenomena, as in this haemostatic example: &quot;... just as the stone Alatyr yields no water, may I yield no blood ... neither a hen yields any milk, a cock any egg, nor would so-and-so bleed... neither blood from a bone, nor water from a stone...&quot;

The typical ending of (accompanied by symbolism of both key and lock) often included the statement &quot;May my words be (both) firm and plasteringly adherent&quot;.

== Humanities ==
In Russian humanities, the term is often used broadly, for any manifestation of faith in the magic power of the human word, thus applied to completely different cultural phenomena of the humankind (from Anglo-Saxon metrical charms to Atharvaveda&#x27;s suktas).

<text>Screw is a pornographic online magazine published in the United States aimed at heterosexual men; it was originally published as a weekly tabloid newspaper.

The publication, which was described as &quot;raunchy, obnoxious, usually disgusting, and sometimes political&quot;, was a pioneer in bringing hardcore pornography into the American mainstream during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Founder Al Goldstein won a series of nationally significant court cases addressing obscenity. At its peak, &quot;Screw&quot; sold 140,000 copies a week.

== Publication history ==
In November 1968 in New York, Al Goldstein and his partner Jim Buckley, investing $175 each, founded &quot;Screw&quot; as a weekly underground newspaper. An an initial price of 25¢, a statement on the cover offered &quot;Jerk-Off Entertainment for Men&quot;.

Beginning in 1969, &quot;Screw&quot; co-founder Jim Buckley founded &quot;Screw&quot;&#x27;s &quot;sister&quot; tabloid &quot;Gay&quot;, edited by &quot;Screw&quot; columnists Jack Nichols and Lige Clarke. Contributors to &quot;Gay&quot; included Dick Leitsch, Randy Wicker, Lilli Vincenz, Peter Fisher, John Paul Hudson, Arthur Bell, Vito Russo, and George Weinberg. &quot;Gay&quot; reached &quot;a broad audience and went on to become the most profitable LGBT newspaper in the U.S.;&quot; it continued until early 1974.

In 1973, Screw published nude photos of former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, which led to scandal — and issue sales of more than a half-million copies. (Nude photos of Onassis had previously appeared in the Italian softcore magazine &quot;Playmen&quot; and later were published by the American hardcore magazine &quot;Hustler&quot;.)

Goldstein tried, unsuccessfully, to expand &quot;Screw&quot;&#x27;s reach beyond New York City. In 1976–1977 &quot;National Screw&quot; was published, only lasting nine issues. The June 1977 issue of the magazine contained, according to its cover, a new story by William Burroughs and an interview with Allen Ginsberg. Other issues contained original adult comic strip work from cartooning legends Wally Wood, Guido Crepax, and Will Eisner.

In 1979–1980, Goldstein&#x27;s company, Milky Way Productions, published &quot;Screw West&quot; out of an office in Hollywood, California. According to an advertisement, it was intended to answer such questions as, &quot;Where can I get laid in San Francisco? What&#x27;s the best swinger&#x27;s club in Los Angeles? How do I find all those out-of-the-way Pacific Coast nude beaches? And what are those bawdy brothels outside Las Vegas really like?&quot; &quot;Screw West&quot; is known to have published 54 issues.

One of Goldstein&#x27;s best friends was Larry Flynt, publisher of &quot;Hustler&quot; magazine, founded seven years after &quot;Screw&quot;. Goldstein claimed that &quot;Hustler&quot; stole its format from &quot;Screw&quot;, but that he was not angry. According to Goldstein, Flynt succeeded in creating a national publication, at which he had failed.

&quot;Screw&quot; folded in 2003, unable to make payroll; only 600 copies were sold of the last issue. Goldstein&#x27;s Milky Way Productions, which published &quot;Screw&quot; and &quot;Midnight Blue&quot;, entered bankruptcy in 2004, having lost sales and subscribers as a result of the proliferation of internet pornography, abetted by Goldstein&#x27;s financial mismanagement.

=== 2004 relaunch ===
In 2004 the &quot;Screw&quot; periodical was restarted by former employees led by Kevin Hein, with writer Mike Edison coming onboard as the new editor. (Edison had started writing as a freelancer for &quot;Screw&quot; almost two decades earlier.) In late 2006 Edison announced that he was leaving the editor-in-chief position. Soon after, in 2007, &quot;Screw&quot; ceased physical publication as the title neared, but did not reach, its 2,000th issue.

Original founder Al Goldstein died in 2013.

=== 2019–2020 relaunch ===
In 2019, &quot;Screw&quot; returned as an adult, subscription-based television channel (&quot;SCREW TV&quot;) on Roku, developed and produced by longtime Goldstein friend and associate Phil Autelitano.

On November 4, 2020, the 52nd anniversary of its initial launch, &quot;Screw&quot; resumed publishing in digital-only format, published by Autelitano (as &quot;Phil Italiano&quot;) and Autelitano Media Group of Miami, Florida.

== Contents ==
&quot;Screw&quot; features reviews of porn movies, peep shows, erotic massage parlors, brothels, escorts, and other offerings of the adult entertainment industry. Such items are interspersed with sexual news, book reviews of sexual books, and hardcore &quot;gynecological&quot; pictorials. The original paper regularly ran, without permission, photos and drawings of celebrities.

According to author Will Sloan:
Jack Nichols and Lige Clarke&#x27;s column &quot;The Homosexual Citizen&quot;, which launched in 1968, was the first LGBT-interest column in a non-LGBT publication. As a result of this column, Nichols and Clarke became known as &quot;The most famous gay couple in America.&quot;

On May 2, 1969, &quot;Screw&quot; published the first reference in print to J. Edgar Hoover&#x27;s sexuality, entitled &quot;Is J. Edgar Hoover a Fag?&quot; A few issues later, &quot;Screw&quot; became the first publication to print the word &quot;homophobia&quot; (a term coined by George Weinberg). The word appeared in an article written for the May 23, 1969, issue, in which the word was used to refer to heterosexual men&#x27;s fear that others might think they are gay.

In December 1970, New York City music teacher Pat Bond placed an ad in &quot;Screw&quot; that led Bond to connect with Fran Nowve, and for the two of them to form The Eulenspiegel Society, the first BDSM organization founded in the United States.

&quot;Screw&quot;″s most successful issue, published in 1973, contained unauthorized photos of Jacqueline Kennedy nude.

Stripper and erotic performance artist Honeysuckle Divine wrote a column, &quot;Diary of a Dirty Broad&quot;, for &quot;Screw&quot; for several years in the mid-1970s. Divine&#x27;s specialty was inserting objects such as pickles in her vagina, shooting out many of them. She put the pickles in baggies and sold them to patrons. Goldstein said that her act &quot;was unbelievably disgusting, so naturally, we made her our symbol.&quot; Divine was the only female associated with &quot;Screw&quot; over any period of time; she also appeared in the 1975 feature production &quot;SOS: Screw on the Screen&quot;.

== Legal battles ==
In 1974, publishers Goldstein and Buckley were charged with 12 counts of obscenity in a federal court in Kansas. (Goldstein believed that the case began as a result of &quot;Screw&quot; May 1969 article, &quot;Is J. Edgar Hoover a Fag?&quot;) The case dragged on for three years through two trials and was finally settled when Goldstein agreed to pay a $30,000 fine.

In 1977, Alabama governor George Wallace sued &quot;Screw&quot; for $5 million for publishing the claim that he had learned to perform sexual acts from reading the magazine. The two parties settled for $12,500, and &quot;Screw&quot; agreed to print an apology.

In 1978, &quot;Screw&quot; set in motion a precedent-setting case that established fair-use protections for publication of registered trademarks in sexually explicit parodies in the United States. Known as &quot;Pillsbury Co. v. Milky Way Productions&quot;, the case stemmed from an illustration in &quot;Screw&quot; depicting a figure resembling the Pillsbury Dough Boy in various lewd sexual acts, including fellatio and sexual intercourse. The parody also featured Pillsbury&#x27;s barrelhead trademark and two lines from the refrain of a two-stanza song entitled &quot;The Pillsbury Baking Song&quot;. The illustration was published in the February 20, 1978, issue of &quot;Screw&quot;. The Pillsbury Company filed an initial complaint several weeks after the original publication of the cartoon, contending that the manner in which the magazine presented the picture implied that Pillsbury placed it in the magazine as an advertisement. Pillsbury alleged several counts of copyright infringement, federal statutory, common law trademark infringement, violations of the Georgia Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act and of the Georgia &quot;anti-dilution&quot; statute, and several counts of tortious tarnishment of its marks, trade characters, and jingle. The judge presiding in the case issued a temporary injunction against &quot;Screw&quot; on April 21, 1978, which the defendant disobeyed. Ultimately, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia held that the pictures were editorial or social commentary and, thus, protected under fair use.

== Contributors ==
Larry Brill and Les Waldstein were the original designers for &quot;Screw&quot;, having earlier designed &quot;Famous Monsters of Filmland&quot; and other Jim Warren publications in the late 1960s. Brill and Waldstein later went on to become the publishers of &quot;The Monster Times&quot;. Steven Heller later served as the paper&#x27;s art director, before moving on to &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

Artist René Moncada became a major contributor to &quot;Screw&quot; beginning in the late 1960s, which provided an outlet for the artist&#x27;s early erotic illustrations, and a forum for his later anti-censorship diatribes.

A number of underground and alternative cartoonists got their start doing illustrations and comics for &quot;Screw&quot;, including Bill Griffith, Milton Knight, Leslie Cabarga, Drew Friedman, Tony Millionaire, Eric Drooker, Kaz, Danny Hellman, Glenn Head, Bob Fingerman, Michael Kupperman, and Molly Crabapple. Spain Rodriguez contributed cover art to more than a dozen issues of &quot;Screw&quot; from 1976 to 1998. In the 1970s and early 1980s, Paul Kirchner did several dozen covers for the publication. &quot;Good girl&quot; artist Bill Ward also did a number of covers for &quot;Screw&quot;.

Writer Josh Alan Friedman&#x27;s first published work was for &quot;Screw&quot; in the late 1970s. He continued to write for the magazine for several years, eventually holding the position of Senior Editor through 1982. He covered the Times Square beat for &quot;Screw&quot; during a perilous time when few, if any writers, ventured there. He also worked as a producer on &quot;Screw&quot;&#x27;s cable television show, &quot;Midnight Blue&quot;.

David Aaron Clark edited &quot;Screw&quot; for five years in the early 1990s.

== &quot;Screw&quot; in other media ==
===Movies and television===
In 1973, &quot;&quot;Screw Magazine&quot; present[ed]&quot; &quot;It Happened in Hollywood&quot;, a pornographic movie produced by Jim Buckley. At the Second Annual New York Erotic Film Festival it won awards for Best Picture, Best Female Performance, and Best Supporting Actor.

In 1974 Goldstein began &quot;Screw Magazine of the Air&quot;, soon renamed &quot;Midnight Blue&quot;, a thrice-weekly hour-long adult-oriented public-access television program that ran for nearly 30 years on Manhattan Cable&#x27;s Channel J.

&quot;SOS: Screw on the Screen&quot; appearing in 1975, was a stridently unsexy attempt at a cinematic newsmagazine that included a lot of goofy comedy, a gay scene, and several minutes of Goldstein ranting about America&#x27;s sexual hypocrisy. Also appearing was Honeysuckle Divine (who often appeared in &quot;Screw&quot;).

===The Screw Store===
The May 17, 1976, issue ran an ad for the &quot;Screw Store&quot;, which offered dildos, including a &quot;Bicentennial Dildo&quot;, vibrating Ben wa eggs, and a vibrating cock ring. Selling dildos brought one of Goldstein&#x27;s many arrests.

<doc id="380764" wikidata="Q265881" url="?curid=380764" title="Clapper bridge">
<text>A clapper bridge is an ancient form of bridge found on the moors of the English West Country (Bodmin Moor, Dartmoor and Exmoor) and in other upland areas of the United Kingdom including Snowdonia and Anglesey, Cumbria, Derbyshire, Yorkshire, Lancashire, and in northern Wester Ross
and north-west Sutherland in Scotland. It is formed by large flat slabs of stone, often granite or schist. These can be supported on stone piers across rivers, or rest on the banks of streams.

==History==
Although often credited with prehistoric origin, most were erected in medieval times, and some in later centuries. They are often situated close to a ford where carts could cross. According to the Dartmoor National Park, the word &#x27;clapper&#x27; derives ultimately from an Anglo-Saxon word, , meaning &#x27;bridging the stepping stones&#x27;; the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; gives the intermediate Medieval Latin form , , &quot;of Gaulish origin&quot;, with an initial meaning of &quot;a pile of stones&quot;.

==Examples==
A fine example, the Postbridge Clapper Bridge, can be found at Postbridge, on Dartmoor. Its slabs are over long, wide and weigh over each, making the bridge passable to a small cart. It was first recorded in 1380 and was built to facilitate the transportation of Dartmoor tin by pack horses to the stannary town of Tavistock.

Other surviving examples include the Tarr Steps over the River Barle in Exmoor, and Stara Bridge over the River Lynher in east Cornwall.
Some larger clapper bridges, such as at Dartmeet and Bellever, have collapsed – their slabs swept away by floods, or raided for building or wall construction - and have since been rebuilt. However, there are many other smaller examples in existence on Dartmoor and still in use, such as those at Teignhead Farm (close to Grey Wethers stone circles), Scorhill and across the Wallabrook stream.

While the term &quot;clapper bridge&quot; is typically associated with the United Kingdom, other &quot;clapper-style&quot; bridges exist throughout the world. One example is the Anping Bridge in China, being over two kilometres long and one in Louisburgh, County Mayo in Ireland.

<text>Nicarchus or Nicarch was a Greek poet and writer of the 1st century AD, best known for his epigrams, of which forty-two survive under his name in the &quot;Greek Anthology&quot;, and his satirical poetry. He was a contemporary of, and influence on, the better-known Latin writer Martial. A large proportion of his epigrams are directed against doctors. Some of his writings have been found at Oxyrhynchus in Egypt.

A fragment of Nicarchus:

The Raven
:The gloom of death is on the raven’s wing,
:The song of death is in the raven’s cries:
:But when Demophilus begins to sing,
:The raven dies.

Nicarchus is also the name of a character in a play of Aristophanes, &quot;The Acharnanians.&quot;

Nicarchus was also the name of a Paeonian king, known only from his issuing of a coin. He was perhaps of the late 4th century BC.

<doc id="380767" wikidata="Q1479392" url="?curid=380767" title="Haibane Renmei">
<text>is a 2002 Japanese anime television series based on an unfinished &quot;dōjinshi&quot; manga series by Yoshitoshi Abe, . The 13-episode series was directed by Tomokazu Tokoro, animated by Radix, and produced by Yasuyuki Ueda. It first aired on Fuji TV between October and December 2002, and was later broadcast on Animax Asia in English and French under the title Ailes Grises (&quot;Grey Wings&quot;).

The series follows Rakka, a newly hatched &quot;haibane&quot; (a being resembling an angel), and other characters in the city of Glie, a walled town with a single gate through which only a mysterious group, the Toga, are allowed to enter or exit.

Considered a classic by many, &quot;Haibane Renmei&quot; is described as a slow-paced, atmospheric, and philosophical series exploring the spiritual themes of the afterlife, guilt, sin, and redemption. It has received widespread critical acclaim, with critics giving particular praise for its tone of mystery, soundtrack, and visuals.

==Plot==

A girl dreams of gently falling through the sky before waking up inside a giant cocoon. Upon breaking out, she is tended to by a group of winged and haloed young women who introduce themselves as &quot;haibane&quot;. Like her, none of them can remember anything before being born from cocoons, and all are named after whatever vision they saw in their dream. They name her Rakka (&#x27;falling&#x27;), as she remembers nothing other than the sensation of falling, and ceremoniously strap a newly forged halo to her head. During the night, Rakka goes through the agonising process of growing wings, while Reki, a senior &quot;haibane&quot;, cares for her.

Rakka settles into her new life in the abandoned countryside boarding school called Old Home, a &quot;nest&quot; of the &quot;haibane&quot;, and quickly bonds with the other residents, especially Reki and Kuu.
==Characters==
:A new arrival at Old Home, Rakka struggles throughout the series to &quot;find herself,&quot; and has trouble escaping from curiosity about her past. She forms many friendships, but her closest is with Reki. Rakka is very quiet and a bit on the withdrawn side. She spends a lot of time pondering her previous existence and the mysteries of what lies beyond the Walls, as well as the origin of the &quot;haibane&quot;.
:Reki is a mother figure to the other &quot;haibane&quot; of Old Home. Reki cannot remember her &quot;cocoon dream,&quot; is troubled by her past at Old Home and by vivid and horrible nightmares, which she then paints as a way of trying to figure them out. She has been a &quot;haibane&quot; for seven years, longer than the others except for Nemu. She spends her time taking care of the precocious pack of Young Feathers who clearly drive her crazy but whom she seems to love unconditionally.
:The youngest of the older &quot;haibane&quot; and the first to take her Day of Flight. Kuu overcame her initial awkwardness to achieve a sense of peace. She develops a close friendship with Rakka and has been a &quot;haibane&quot; for two years. Outgoing and a bit hyper, Kuu demonstrates surprising knowledge of the town and serves as a good role model for Rakka.
:The &quot;haibane&quot; who has lived longest at Old Home. Her friends tease Nemu because she is always sleeping. In fact, her cocoon dream was of herself, sleeping, which is a bit of an inside gag at Old Home. She is an old friend of Reki, works at the library, and has been a &quot;haibane&quot; for nine years. Nemu is often the voice of reason and calm during times of trouble and, like Reki, holds back the secret of a troubled past. She seems to have an almost mother/daughter relationship with Sumika, the former senior librarian.
:A mechanically inclined tomboy, Kana works at the clock tower in the center of town. Kana has been a &quot;haibane&quot; for three years. Kana has a bit of a whimsical side to her as she reveals to Rakka that she wonders about the world outside the walls as well. More often than not though, Kana is hyper and obnoxious, which helps her to coexist with her grouchy master at the clock tower. Despite her confident attitude, Kana is actually very sensitive deep down and cares deeply for her friends, showing almost as much sadness as Rakka for Kuu&#x27;s loss before grudgingly accepting it.
:A serious &quot;haibane&quot; who is also occasionally mischievous and funny. She works in a bakery in town and has been a &quot;haibane&quot; for four years. Hikari has a tendency to be a bit forgetful, such as forgetting to tell Rakka to practice moving her wings before her trip to the Haibane Renmei Temple. She&#x27;s highly innovative, experimenting at the bakery with the halo mold presumably a short time after Rakka was born.
:Prominent member of the second, co-ed group of &quot;haibane&quot; in Glie who live at the Abandoned Factory &quot;nest&quot; on the opposite side of town from Old Home. Was a friend of Reki in the past. Upon first meeting Rakka, he accidentally upsets her with a remark about Kuu&#x27;s recent Day of Flight. Despite his tough exterior, he&#x27;s shown to be very kind, such as sending Rakka pastries and an apology note for the incident.
:A &quot;haibane&quot; from Abandoned Factory and a close friend of Hyōko. Has an ongoing grudge against Reki for her past endangerment of Hyōko but is willing to talk with Rakka and others.
: A presiding official of the Haibane Renmei who gives spiritual advice and worldly assistance and, occasionally, imposes punishments on &quot;haibane&quot; who break the rules. The Communicator is the only person who can speak with the Toga on their visits to the town and it&#x27;s speculated that he himself was a failed &quot;haibane&quot;. He wishes for the Day of Flight to come to all the &quot;haibane&quot; successfully and feels concerned that Reki refuses to heed his advice and attempts to help her.
: A &quot;haibane&quot; who cared for the young Nemu and Reki. Despite her delicate health, she was kind and helpful to them, especially to Reki in dealing with her black wings. Kuramori took her Day of Flight five years before the start of the series but remains vivid in the memories of Reki and Nemu, the only ones remaining to remember her. She&#x27;s the only full-grown adult Haibane to be shown, as all the others are teens and mid-adolescents.
:The Toga are the only people who can enter and leave the city of Glie at will. The Toga never speak, save for communicating in sign language to the Communicator (who represents the link between the citizens of Glie and the Haibane Renmei), and they never reveal their faces. Human and &quot;haibane&quot; alike are told to keep their distance from the Toga.
:A librarian, senior of Namu. When Rakka first worked at the library, she planned to leave four days later for maternity leave. However, she remained in the library during winter.

===Young Feathers===
Unlike their senior counterparts, their names are chosen based on aspirations.
:A &quot;haibane&quot; who was originally from Abandoned Factory, but lives in Old Home most of the time.

:A &quot;haibane&quot; who taught Rakka how to move her wings.

==Background and production==
===&quot;Dōjinshi&quot;===
The initial version of &quot;Haibane Renmei&quot; was a 22-page long &quot;dōjinshi&quot; (self-published work) of the same title by Yoshitoshi Abe. Released in 1998, it bore little resemblance to the final anime aside from being about people with halos and grey wings.

Abe later reworked his idea into &quot;The Haibane of Old Home&quot;, which featured new characters and a different plot. The first issue, released in late 2001, was 24 pages long; the first anime episode covers roughly two-thirds of this issue. The second issue featured stories shown in the end of the first anime episode and the first third of the second episode.

Following this, Abe released two special &quot;dōjinshi&quot;: the &quot;Lifestyle Diary&quot; and the &quot;Extra Edition&quot;. The former explains that the story has been licensed as an anime to be released later that year, and that he would not be continuing the dōjinshi. The book&#x27;s contents cover the specifics of character design, from personality to shoe style, and lay out maps of the town and some of its buildings. It features several four-panel comics depicting the lives and behaviors of the specific &quot;haibane&quot;, including the protagonist Rakka&#x27;s curiosity about her halo and wings. The Extra Edition is a flashback story to the character Reki&#x27;s experiences as a &quot;haibane&quot; girl shortly after her mentor, Kuramori, left their home. This part of the story is covered in the anime, but the &quot;dōjinshi&quot; adds some additional detail. It was released after the completion of the anime series.

===Conception and influences===
Publication as an independent &quot;dōjinshi&quot; was necessitated by the experimental nature of the work. Abe later revealed that he made up the story as he wrote, having no firm plan in place for the characters and plot. Commercial magazines, on the other hand, would have required adherence to deadlines and page quotas in addition to a solid plan for the series.

The series was influenced by, and is often compared to, Haruki Murakami&#x27;s 1985 novel &quot;Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World&quot;. Both works share a common setting of a walled town inhabited by memoryless residents, and some individual elements were also borrowed, such as birds as a recurring motif. The novel was Abe&#x27;s favourite at the time; he confessed to having read it more than ten times. Another influence was Hirokazu Kore-eda&#x27;s 1998 Japanese film &quot;After Life&quot;, which also features recently deceased people struggling to move on.

===Production===

Having started to write &quot;The Haibane of Old Home&quot;, Abe was approached by producer Yasuyuki Ueda, with whom he had previously collaborated on &quot;Serial Experiments Lain&quot; as a character designer, who proposed turning it into an anime. The production was completed in a relatively short time, lasting in whole approximately six months. By May 2002 Abe had finished writing the initial plot for the series, and the production of later episodes continued while the series had started airing.

Akira Takada is credited as the sole character designer, but the designs for the main cast, along with the overall visual style of the series, were drawn from the original &quot;dōjinshi&quot;. In an interview, Abe noted that the main character Rakka&#x27;s design had changed the most during the course of the development, becoming rather different from his own drawings.

===Music===
Kow Otani composed the original musical score for the series, including the opening theme &quot;Free Bird&quot;. The score, described as a blend of 17th-century music, Celtic, and Jazz, predominantly features instrumentals with a strong reliance on traditional Western instruments such as guitar, piano, flutes, and drums. The ending theme &quot;Blue Flow&quot; was performed by Masumi Itou.

==Themes and analysis==

Eschatology is a major theme in the series. The walled city of Glie is often interpreted to be a form of purgatory or limbo, and the story arc a journey toward redemption, salvation, or forgiveness. Previous-life suicide of at least one of the main characters, Reki, is implied. Professor Susan J. Napier suggests all the other &quot;haibane&quot; are suicide victims as well, seeing a &quot;bleak&quot; reference to the high suicide rates among Japanese youth.

The spiritual themes of the series draw from both Christian and Buddhist ideas and imagery, reflecting on the eclectic religious traditions of Japan itself. The Christian influences are immediately evident from the winged and haloed &quot;haibane&quot;, who, despite their appearance, the creators of the series tell are not meant to explicitly represent angels. Anime scholar and critic Marc Hairston argues that the traditional Christian portrayal of angels is quickly subverted; rather than superior beings, the &quot;haibane&quot; are treated as second-class citizens in Glie.

&quot;Haibane Renmei&quot; introduces many mysteries over the course of the series, leaving most of them unanswered and up to interpretation. The exact nature of the &quot;haibane&quot;, Toga, and the world of Glie are never explained. The audience is not shown what, if anything, lies beyond the wall or what happens to the characters after their Day of Flight. The creators have deliberately maintained this ambiguity and refused to elaborate on these points in interviews, with Yoshitoshi Abe stating he doesn&#x27;t want to impose his personal views on the viewers.

==Broadcast and distribution==

The series was originally broadcast in Japan on Fuji TV from 10 October to 19 December 2002, airing on an irregular schedule. Although originally intended to be a weekly broadcast spanning three months, the schedule was accelerated, resulting in the first five episodes airing two weeks apart, followed by the remaining eight episodes shown weekly in back-to-back pairs. Producer Yasuyuki Ueda called this change &quot;painful&quot; and later blamed it for contributing to the initial lukewarm reception of the anime.

Over the years, the series has had several physical releases. In Japan, Geneon Entertainment released a total of five DVD sets of &quot;Haibane Renmei&quot; between December 2002 and April 2003. Additionally, a Blu-ray box set was released in 2010. The series was first licensed and dubbed into English in North America by Geneon USA (named Pioneer Entertainment at the time), which published DVD releases from April 2003 to October 2005. In 2010, Funimation (now Crunchyroll, LLC) obtained the license for the show, along with a handful of other Geneon properties, and released a new boxed DVD set in 2012. In Europe, the series was licensed by MVM Films, who initially distributed a DVD version and later issued a Blu-ray release in 2021. Madman Entertainment first released the series in Australia, before Sony acquired the license in 2013.

A comic based on the television series was published by Dark Horse Comics in April 2006.

==Reception==
&quot;Haibane Renmei&quot; has received widespread and enduring international critical acclaim and is considered a classic by many. Critics have described it as a slow-paced, atmospheric, and philosophical series, giving particular praise for its tone of mystery, distinctive art style, and &quot;beautiful&quot; soundtrack.

The series&#x27; visuals have generally been praised, with critics at the time commending both the design and animation. The decision to use a muted color scheme garnered a particularly positive reception; Mauno Joukama writing for the Finnish magazine &quot;Anime&quot; called it &quot;picturesque&quot;, &quot;Animerica&quot; &quot;stunning&quot;. Later reviews have been more mixed on this aspect. They note that while the animation quality was &quot;fairly sharp&quot; by early 2000s standards, it hasn&#x27;t aged well with modern devices, causing certain artistic flaws to become more noticeable.

Stig Høgset, in his review for &quot;THEM Anime Reviews,&quot; hailed the series as &quot;one of the finest animated works in existence&quot;, especially lauding the music as among &quot;the most beautiful in any anime ever&quot;. Jonathan Mays of &quot;Anime News Network&quot;, in an in-depth review, described the &quot;Hanenone&quot; soundtrack as an &quot;emotional expedition&quot;, concluding it to be &quot;superior to almost all television series music.&quot;

The English dub produced by New Generation Pictures received generally favorable critique. &quot;Anime News Network&#x27;s&quot; Zac Bertschy called it a &quot;marvel&quot;, noting that it had managed to overcome his generally low expectations for English dubs. Theron Martin, writing for the network nine years later, described it as an &quot;excellent effort&quot;, praising the natural-sounding dialogue. Ryan Mathews, on the other hand, found it merely &quot;enjoyable&quot;, expressing his dislike for the cast of most supporting characters.

<text>Rambo is an American media franchise centered on a series of action films featuring John J. Rambo. The five films are &quot;First Blood&quot; (1982), &quot;&quot; (1985), &quot;Rambo III&quot; (1988), &quot;Rambo&quot; (2008), and &quot;&quot; (2019). Its titular protagonist is a United States Army Special Forces veteran played by Sylvester Stallone, whose Vietnam War experience traumatized him but also gave him superior military skills, which he has used to fight corrupt police officers, enemy troops and drug cartels. &quot;First Blood&quot; is an adaptation of the 1972 novel &quot;First Blood&quot; by David Morrell.

The film series has grossed $819 million in total, $300 million of which is from the most successful film, &quot;Rambo: First Blood Part II&quot;. Sylvester Stallone is the only actor to have appeared in all five films in the franchise. Stallone co-wrote the screenplays of all five films, and directed &quot;Rambo&quot;. The franchise also spawned , as well as comic books, novels and video games.

==Films==
===&quot;First Blood&quot; (1982)===
Upon returning to the United States, Vietnam veteran John Rambo has difficulty adjusting to civilian life and wanders the country as a drifter for almost a decade. In December 1981, Rambo travels to a small town in rural Washington (filmed in Hope, British Columbia, Canada), in search of a fellow U.S. Army Green Beret buddy. He learns that his friend died from cancer the previous summer due to exposure to Agent Orange.

He attempts to find a diner in town, and maybe a temporary job. The overconfident town sheriff Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy) does not welcome Rambo, judging the military hero negatively because of his long hair and scruffy look. Rambo disobeys the sheriff&#x27;s order to stay away from town, as he has done nothing wrong and believes such banishment to be a violation of his freedom of movement, and most of all he is hungry. Rambo returns to town soon afterwards and is promptly charged with vagrancy and subject to harassment and brutality from the deputies.

The police brutality triggers flashbacks of Rambo&#x27;s memories of his torture at the hands of the North Vietnamese when he was a prisoner of war. Rambo fights his way out of the sheriff&#x27;s department with his bare hands and makes his way into the wilderness. A manhunt ensues, with the sheriff and his deputies all badly wounded. Rambo chooses not to kill any of them, but unintentionally kills a police officer in self-defense by throwing a rock at a helicopter, causing the pilot to lose control and an officer to fall out. The State Police and National Guard are called in.

Colonel Samuel Trautman (Richard Crenna), Rambo&#x27;s former commanding officer, arrives. He suggests giving Rambo a chance to escape; if Rambo is allowed to slip away, he&#x27;ll be given time to calm down and he can be arrested without incident. Teasle allows Trautman to contact Rambo through a stolen police radio, but Rambo refuses to surrender, stating that &quot;They (the deputies) drew first blood, not me&quot; and then hanging up.

The authorities reject Trautman&#x27;s recommendation for a wait-and-see attitude and continue the manhunt, and Rambo&#x27;s subsequent rampage culminates in him returning to town with guns and bombs from a commandeered Army truck. This results in the destruction of the sheriff&#x27;s office and more of the town&#x27;s main street. Rambo stands poised to eliminate the sheriff, but Trautman finally confronts Rambo face to face, and ultimately convinces his former soldier to surrender to the authorities.

Between the first and second films, Rambo is convicted and remanded to a civilian maximum-security prison where hard labor is the norm. Despite being a convict, the rigid routine and discipline of prison life provides Rambo with some measure of much-needed stability, as it reminds him of his past in the military and its own rigid hierarchy.

===&quot;Rambo: First Blood Part II&quot; (1985)===

The film opens with Colonel Samuel Trautman (Richard Crenna) offering Rambo his freedom if Rambo will return to Vietnam to search for American prisoners of war remaining in Vietnamese captivity. Marshall Murdock (Charles Napier), the official in charge of the mission, is portrayed as a corrupt political figure who doesn&#x27;t want to expose the truth. Rambo is not to engage the enemy and instead is ordered to take photographs of a North Vietnamese camp, the same camp he himself had been held prisoner in, to prove to the American public there are no more POWs in Vietnam, although Murdock knows that there are.

Rambo is flown into the country with the purpose of parachuting into the jungle, but a malfunction during his exit from the plane causes him to have to cut away much of his equipment. He then meets his in-country contact, anti-communist Vietnamese rebel Co Bao (Julia Nickson), who is serving as an intelligence agent. Rambo discovers that there are POWs being held in the camp where he was dropped and that POWs were rotated between camps. Rambo breaks one POW out of the camp and attempts to escape, only to be abandoned at the moment of a pick up by helicopter on a hilltop on the orders of Murdock, after which both he and the POW are recaptured by the Vietnamese soldiers. Rambo is immobilized in a pit of sewage and leeches, then tortured by Soviet soldiers, who are allied with the Vietnamese and training Vietnamese soldiers. Co enters the base under the guise of a prostitute for hire, where she aids Rambo in escaping. After Rambo expresses his deepest gratitude for his rescue, the two share a kiss, after Co implores him to take her back to America with him. As they prepare to move on, Co is shot by surprise gunfire.

Enraged, Rambo then acts on his own initiative and starts a one-man war, hunting the Vietnamese and Soviet soldiers searching for him in the jungle and stealing a Soviet-captured helicopter. He flies the helicopter back to the camp, destroying it and killing the remaining Vietnamese and Soviet soldiers in the camp. He frees all the POWs and is pursued by a Soviet Mi-24 Hind helicopter. After destroying the Hind with an RPG, he returns to the US base in Thailand with all the POWs. Rambo is enraged at how the United States government has ignored the existence of surviving soldiers being held captive, and grabs an M-60 machine gun and proceeds into the headquarters building, destroying all of the electronic gear within. Rambo then threatens Murdock and tells him to be forthright with the American public regarding the truth of the POWs and to spare no expense in rescuing them all, or else he will return for Murdock. When Trautman says Rambo will be honored once again, he declines, saying the POWs deserve the accolades more. For his actions in Vietnam, Rambo is granted a presidential pardon and decides to remain in Thailand.

===&quot;Rambo III&quot; (1988)===
The film opens with Colonel Samuel Trautman (Richard Crenna) returning to Thailand to once again enlist Rambo&#x27;s help. After witnessing Rambo&#x27;s victory in a stick-fighting match, Trautman visits the temple Rambo is helping to build and asks him to join him on a mission to Afghanistan. This brings Rambo into the realm of the CIA&#x27;s Special Activities Division which primarily hires Army Special Forces soldiers. The mission is meant to supply weapons, including FIM-92 Stinger missiles, to Afghan freedom fighters, the Mujahideen, who are fighting the Soviets. Despite having been shown photos of civilians suffering under Soviet rule, Rambo refuses and Trautman chooses to go on his own.

While in Afghanistan, Trautman&#x27;s troops are ambushed by Soviet troops while passing through the mountains at night. Trautman is imprisoned in a Soviet base and tortured for information by commanding officer Zaysen (Marc de Jonge) and his henchman Kourov (Randy Raney). Rambo learns of the incident from embassy field officer Robert Griggs (Kurtwood Smith) and immediately flies to Pakistan where he meets up with Mousa (Sasson Gabai), a weapons supplier who agrees to take him to a village deep in the Afghan desert, close to the Soviet base where Trautman is kept. The Mujahideen in the village are already hesitant to help Rambo in the first place, but are convinced not to help him when their village is attacked by Soviet helicopters after one of Mousa&#x27;s shop assistants informed the Russians of Rambo&#x27;s presence. Aided only by Mousa and a young boy named Hamid (Doudi Shoua), Rambo makes his way to the Soviet base and starts his attempts to free Trautman. The first attempt is unsuccessful and results in Hamid getting shot in the leg, and Rambo himself getting hit by wooden shrapnel. After escaping from the base, Rambo tends to Hamid&#x27;s wounds and sends him and Mousa away to safety.

The next day, Rambo returns to the base once again, just in time to rescue Trautman from being tortured with a flamethrower. After rescuing several other prisoners, Rambo steals a helicopter and escapes from the base. The helicopter crashes and Rambo and Trautman are forced to continue on foot. After a confrontation in a cave, where Rambo and Trautman kill several Russian soldiers including Kourov, they are confronted by an entire army of Russian tanks, headed by Zaysen. Just as they are about to be overwhelmed by the might of the Soviet Army, the Mujahideen warriors, together with Mousa and Hamid, ride onto the battlefield in a cavalry charge, overwhelming the Russians despite their numerical and technological superiority. In the ensuing battle, in which both Trautman and Rambo are wounded, Rambo manages to kill Zaysen by driving a tank into the helicopter in which Zaysen is flying.

At the end of the battle Rambo and Trautman say goodbye to their Mujahideen friends and leave Afghanistan to go home.

===&quot;Rambo&quot; (2008)===
The film opens with news footage of the crisis in Burma. Burma (also known as Myanmar) is under the iron fist rule of Than Shwe and takes harsher stances against the nation&#x27;s pro-democracy movement. Rebels are thrown into a mine-infested marsh and then gunned down by a Burmese army unit, overseen by Major Pa Tee Tint.

Former U.S. soldier John Rambo still lives in Thailand, now residing in a village near the Burmese border and makes a living capturing snakes and selling them in a nearby village. A missionary, Michael Burnett (Paul Schulze), asks Rambo to take him and his associates down the Salween River to Burma on a humanitarian mission to help the Karen people. Rambo initially refuses but is convinced by another missionary in the group, Sarah Miller (Julie Benz), to take them.

The boat is stopped by pirates who demand Sarah in exchange for passage. After taking advantage of the pirates&#x27; complacency, Rambo kills them all. Although his actions save the missionaries, it greatly disturbs them. Upon arrival, Michael says that they will travel by road and will not need Rambo&#x27;s help for the return trip. The mission goes well until the Burmese army, led by Major Tint, attacks the village, killing most of the villagers and two missionaries, and capturing the rest. When the missionaries fail to come back after ten days, their pastor, Arthur Marsh (Ken Howard), comes to Rambo to ask for his help in guiding hired mercenaries to the village where the missionaries were last seen.

Troubled by Sarah&#x27;s potential fate, Rambo decides to accompany the soldiers. After seeing the destroyed village filled with mutilated humans and animals, the mercenaries spot some soldiers forcing several surviving villagers to run through a minefield. The mercenaries are hesitant to rescue the villagers, but not Rambo, who shoots the soldiers with a bow and arrow. Rambo reminds his colleagues of the rescue mission and encourages the team to move on. Hijacking a truck, they create a plan to save the hostages at the P.O.W. camp, doing so within fifteen minutes to avoid alerting the army. Rambo helps Sarah and the others to escape.

The Burmese Army (Tatmadaw) unit finds their hostages missing and organizes a massive manhunt. Everyone except for Rambo, Sarah, and &quot;School Boy&quot; (Matthew Marsden), the mercenary team&#x27;s sniper, is captured. Just as the group is to be executed, Rambo hijacks a truck-mounted .50-caliber machine gun and engages the Burmese army. A group of Karen rebels joins the fight to help Rambo and the mercenaries defeat the Burmese unit. Seeing that the battle is lost, Major Tint decides to flee, only to run into Rambo&#x27;s machete, which Rambo then uses to disembowel the Major.

Encouraged by Sarah&#x27;s words, Rambo returns to the United States. The last scene shows him walking along a rural highway, past a horse farm and a rusted mailbox with the name &quot;R. Rambo&quot; on it. He makes his way down the gravel driveway as the credits roll.

===&quot;Rambo: Last Blood&quot; (2019)===
Eleven years after the events in Burma, Vietnam War veteran John Rambo lives in Bowie, Arizona at his deceased father&#x27;s horse ranch, which he manages with his old friend, Maria Beltran, and her granddaughter, Gabriela. Gabriela tells Rambo that a friend of hers, Gizelle, has found Gabriela&#x27;s biological father, Miguel, in Mexico. Both Rambo and Maria tell her not to go to Mexico, but Gabriela secretly drives there to ask Miguel why he abandoned her and her mother years ago. Gizelle leads Gabriela to Miguel&#x27;s apartment, where he coldly tells her that he never really cared for Gabriela or her mother.
Gizelle takes a heartbroken Gabriela to a nearby club, where Gabriela is drugged and kidnapped by the enforcers of a Mexican cartel. Meanwhile, Maria informs Rambo of Gabriela&#x27;s disappearance in Mexico. Rambo rushes to Mexico and interrogates both Miguel and Gizelle about Gabriela&#x27;s whereabouts. Gizelle reluctantly leads Rambo to the club where Gabriela was last seen and confronts El Flaco, the man who last spoke with Gabriela. A mysterious woman, Carmen Delgado, tails Rambo as El Flaco leads him to Gabriela&#x27;s location. Rambo is immediately confronted, beaten and marked by the cartel, led by the brothers Hugo and Victor Martinez. They take his driver&#x27;s license with the location of Rambo&#x27;s ranch and a photo of Gabriela, whom Victor recognizes. The cartel vow to mistreat Gabriela further due to Rambo&#x27;s actions.

Carmen takes Rambo back to her home where she cares for him until he fully recovers after four days. While Rambo is cared for by Carmen, Gabriela is stripped and consistently dosed with heroin and sold to be raped repeatedly. Carmen says she is an independent journalist who has been investigating the Martinez brothers, who kidnapped and murdered her sister. Rambo later raids one of the brothels, killing several men until he finds a drugged Gabriela. While driving back home in his pickup, Rambo thanks Gabriela for giving him hope for ten years but she dies from the forced overdose. An enraged Rambo sends Maria away and rigs the ranch with traps for a confrontation, and later returns to Mexico to ask Carmen&#x27;s help in finding Victor. Carmen initially refuses and tells Rambo that it will solve nothing, but is convinced after he appeals to her grief and frustration.

Rambo raids Victor&#x27;s home, killing several guards and decapitating Victor. In retaliation, Hugo leads a large train of 7 SUVs filled with hitmen to Rambo&#x27;s ranch, but each eventually falls victim to Rambo&#x27;s rigged traps. Saving Hugo for the last, Rambo mutilates him and rips his heart out, killing him instantly. In the aftermath, a weakened Rambo sits on the porch of his father&#x27;s house, vowing to continue fighting and keep the memories of his loved ones alive. During the credits, flashbacks to scenes from the first four movies in the franchise are shown, with Rambo finally saddling up his horse and riding off into the sunset.

===Future===
In June 2019 at Cannes, Stallone stated he would continue portraying John Rambo if the fifth film succeeds. Grunberg, however, said that &quot;Rambo: Last Blood&quot; &quot;closes the circle&quot; and concludes the film series. In September 2019, Stallone expressed interest in a sixth &quot;Rambo&quot; film, where the character takes refuge at a Native American reservation. Stallone later elaborated that the story would explore Rambo&#x27;s return to the reservation where he had grown up.

==Television==
=== &quot;Rambo: The Force of Freedom&quot; (1986) ===
&quot;Rambo: The Force of Freedom&quot; was an animated series that ran in 1986 in which John Rambo leads a team called The Force of Freedom to fight an evil organization called S.A.V.A.G.E. (short for Specialist-Administrators of Vengeance, Anarchy and Global Extortion). 65 episodes were aired. &quot;Rambo and the Forces of Freedom&quot; spawned a line of toys.

===Future===
In August 2013, it was announced that a &quot;Rambo&quot; television series was in development. The project was stated to include Avi Lerner and Sylvester Stallone in creative capacities. Stallone was contractually in negotiations to reprise his role from the film series, with John Morayniss and Lerner serving as executive producers. Lerner described the project as &quot;the next phase of the &quot;Rambo&quot; legacy.&quot; The series was stated to be a joint-venture production between Nu Image, Millennium Media and eOne, while being shopped around to various television networks. By December 2015, the series was ordered by FOX Network and was officially titled &quot;Rambo: New Blood&quot;. Written by Jeb Stuart, the series would center around the complex relationship between John Rambo and an ex-Navy SEAL named J.R., his estranged son. Stallone and Stuart joined the production as additional executive producers. Later that month, Stallone stated that he would pass on reprising his role.

By October 2016, the project was temporarily repurposed as a described reboot film with the same title. Ariel Vromen joined the production as director, with a script written by Brooks McLaren. The project never materialized, in favor of &quot;&quot;. In November 2018, David Morrell revealed that he was commissioned by Stallone to write the script for the television series, after the previous attempts at launching the project had not succeeded. Morrell stated that the reason it had never been filmed, is that creatives had a difficult time completing the story on the story; reiterating that Rambo&#x27;s son was an ex-Navy SEAL civilian, and comparing the character to &quot;The Equalizer&quot;. Miramax Television was attached to the project during his involvement.

In September 2019, Stallone announced plans for a prequel project. Though he would not reprise the title role, he would like to explore who Rambo was before the war: &quot;the perfect guy&quot;, a Jim Thorpe-type super athlete captain of the sports team, and popular kid at school. Stallone stated that the series would explore the juxtaposition that took place, to show that joining the military and involved in war, completely changed John Rambo. Stallone later teamed with author Chuck Dixon to tell this story in the form of a graphic novel entitled &quot;First Kill&quot;.

In November 2021, Head of Millennium Media Jeffrey Greenstein announced that the studio is once again actively developing a &quot;Rambo&quot; television series. By November 2022, Stallone stated that development on the prequel series is ongoing. He said that he would like the project to resemble a Vietnam documentary, with the series showing how war changes a person. The plot has John Rambo change from being popular athlete, to what he became in the film series. He also stated that the project may end in modern-day, where he &quot;pass[es] the torch&quot;, which may resemble the original &quot;New Blood&quot; project.

<doc id="380774" wikidata="Q130234680" url="?curid=380774" title="Gerfalcon">
<text>Gerfalcon is a historic motor vessel built in 1937 by William Osbourne, Littlehampton. Notably, she participated in the Dunkirk evacuation during World War II, where she played a crucial role as one of the &quot;Little Ships.&quot; Today, Gerfalcon is preserved as a National Historic Vessel undergoing restoration.

==History==
===Construction and Early Years===
*Gerfalcon was ordered by Valentine Searles-Wood of the Royal Navy and launched in 1937 as a private motor yacht, constructed by William Osbourne, Littlehampton as vessel 192, a prestigious shipbuilder in the United Kingdom. She was built to the highest standards, reflecting the quality and craftsmanship associated with her builders. Initially, Gerfalcon was used for pleasure cruising along the British coast.

===World War II Service===
With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, Gerfalcon was requisitioned by the Admiralty to assist in the war effort. In 1940, she was one of the hundreds of civilian vessels called upon to participate in Operation Dynamo, the mass evacuation of British and Allied troops from Dunkirk, France. During this operation, Gerfalcon made multiple trips across the English Channel, helping to rescue soldiers stranded on the beaches.

Following her service at Dunkirk, Gerfalcon continued to serve in various capacities throughout the war, including coastal patrol and transport duties in the Royal Naval Patrol Service as an Auxiliary Patrol Craft.

===Post-war Years===
After the war, Gerfalcon was returned to her owners and refitted for civilian use. She was restored to her former glory as a motor yacht and was used for private cruising. Over the years, she has passed through several owners, each of whom has contributed to her upkeep and preservation.

===Preservation and Current Use===
*Gerfalcon is now recognised as a vessel of historic significance, listed on the National Historic Ships UK Register. She is also a member of the Association of Dunkirk Little Ships (ADLS), participating in regular commemorative events, including the annual Thames Traditional Boat Festival and the Dunkirk anniversary cruises.

Today, Gerfalcon is in very poor condition but is being carefully restored by her current owner Gary Fletcher. She continues to serve as a reminder of the bravery and resilience demonstrated during the Dunkirk evacuation.

<doc id="380781" wikidata="Q25357" url="?curid=380781" title="Common raven">
<text>The common raven or northern raven (Corvus corax) is a large all-black passerine bird. It is the most widely distributed of all corvids, found across the Northern Hemisphere. There are 11 accepted subspecies with little variation in appearance, although recent research has demonstrated significant genetic differences among populations from various regions. It is one of the two largest corvids, alongside the thick-billed raven, and is the heaviest passerine bird; at maturity, the common raven averages in length and in weight, though up to in the heaviest individuals. Although their typical lifespan is considerably shorter, common ravens can live more than 23 years in the wild. Young birds may travel in flocks but later mate for life, with each mated pair defending a territory.

Common ravens have coexisted with humans for thousands of years and in some areas have been so numerous that people have regarded them as pests. Part of their success as a species is due to their omnivorous diet; they are extremely versatile and opportunistic in finding sources of nutrition, feeding on carrion, insects, cereal grains, berries, fruit, small animals, nesting birds, and food waste. Some notable feats of problem-solving provide evidence that the common raven is unusually intelligent.

Over the centuries, the raven has been the subject of mythology, folklore, art, and literature. In many cultures, including the indigenous cultures of Scandinavia, ancient Ireland and Wales, Bhutan, the northwest coast of North America, and Siberia and northeast Asia, the common raven has been revered as a spiritual figure or godlike creature.

== Taxonomy ==
The common raven was one of the many species originally described, with its type locality given as Europe, by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, and it still bears its original name of &quot;Corvus corax&quot;. It is the type species of the genus &quot;Corvus&quot;, derived from the Latin word for &#x27;raven&#x27;. The specific epithet &quot;corax&quot; is the Latinized form of the Greek word , meaning &#x27;raven&#x27; or &#x27;crow&#x27;.

The modern English word &quot;raven&quot; has cognates in many other Germanic languages, including Old Norse (and subsequently modern Icelandic) and Old High German , all which descend from Proto-Germanic . An old Scottish word or , akin to the French , has been used for both this bird and the carrion crow. Collective nouns for a group of ravens (or at least the common raven) include &quot;unkindness&quot; and &quot;conspiracy&quot;.

=== Classification ===
The closest relatives of the common raven are the brown-necked raven (&quot;C. ruficollis&quot;), the pied crow (&quot;C. albus&quot;) of Africa, and the Chihuahuan raven (&quot;C. cryptoleucus&quot;) of the North American Southwest. Most authorities, including the IOC World Bird List and the &quot;Handbook of the Birds of the World&quot;, currently accept 11 subspecies, though some only accept eight; of the six subspecies accepted by IOC and &quot;HBW&quot; in the Western Palearctic region, only four are accepted by Shirihai.
=== Evolutionary history ===
The common raven evolved in the Old World and crossed the Bering land bridge into North America. Recent genetic studies, which examined the DNA of common ravens from across the world, have determined that the birds fall into at least two clades: a California clade (subspecies &quot;C. c. clarionensis&quot;), found only in the southwestern United States, and a Holarctic clade, found across the rest of the Northern Hemisphere. Birds from both clades look alike, but the groups are genetically distinct and began to diverge about two million years ago.

The findings indicate that based on mitochondrial DNA, common ravens from the rest of North America are more closely related to those in Europe and Asia, than to those in the California clade, and that common ravens in the California clade are more closely related to the Chihuahuan raven (&quot;C. cryptoleucus&quot;) than to those in the Holarctic clade. Ravens in the Holarctic clade are more closely related to the pied crow (&quot;C. albus&quot;) than they are to the California clade. Thus, the common raven species as traditionally delimited is considered to be paraphyletic.

One explanation for these genetic findings is that common ravens settled in California at least two million years ago and became separated from their relatives in Europe and Asia during a glacial period. One million years ago, a group from the California clade evolved into a new species, the Chihuahuan raven. Other members of the Holarctic clade arrived later in a separate migration from Asia, perhaps at the same time as humans and wolves about 15,000 years ago.

A 2011 study suggested that there are no restrictions on gene flow between the Californian and Holarctic common raven groups, and that the lineages can remerge, effectively reversing a potential speciation.

A recent study of raven mitochondrial DNA showed that the isolated population from the Canary Islands is distinct from other populations. The study did not include any individuals from the North African population, and its position is therefore unclear, though its morphology is very close to the population of the Canaries (to the extent that the two are often considered part of a single subspecies).

== Description ==
A mature common raven ranges between and has a wingspan of . Recorded weights range from , thus making the common raven one of the heaviest passerines. Birds from colder regions such as the Himalayas and Greenland are generally larger with slightly larger bills, while those from warmer regions are smaller with proportionally smaller bills. Representative of the size variation in the species, ravens from California weighed an average of , those from Alaska weighed an average of and those from Nova Scotia weighed an average of . The bill is large and slightly curved, with a culmen length of , one of the largest bills amongst passerines (only the thick-billed raven and white-necked raven have larger bills). It has a longish, strongly graduated tail, at , and mostly iridescent black plumage, and a dark brown iris. The throat feathers are elongated and pointed and the bases of the neck feathers are pale brownish-grey. The legs and feet are stout and strong, with a tarsus length of . The juvenile plumage is similar but duller, with a blue-grey iris, and pinkish gape at first.

Apart from its greater size, the common raven differs from related crows by having a larger and heavier black beak, shaggy feathers around the throat, longer bristles above the beak, and a longer, wedge-shaped tail. Flying ravens are distinguished from crows by their tail shape, larger wing area, and more stable soaring style, which generally involves less wing flapping. Despite their bulk, ravens are easily as agile in flight as their smaller cousins. In flight the feathers produce a creaking sound that has been likened to the rustle of silk. The voice of ravens is also quite distinct, its usual call being a deep croak of a much more sonorous quality than a crow&#x27;s call, though the calls of other ravens like the fan-tailed raven and brown-necked raven can be confused where they occur together with common ravens in parts of southwest Asia and northern Africa; of these two, the fan-tailed raven is more similar in calls but has a very different shape with its broad wings and very short tail, while the brown-necked raven can be very hard to distinguish on plumage, but has somewhat more crow-like calls. In North America, the Chihuahuan raven (&quot;C. cryptoleucus&quot;) is fairly similar to the relatively small common ravens of the American southwest and is best distinguished by the still relatively smaller size of its bill, beard and body and relatively longer tail. The all-black carrion crow (&quot;C. corone&quot;) and rook (&quot;C. frugilegus&quot;) in Europe may suggest a raven due to their largish bill but are still distinctly smaller and have the wing and tail shapes typical of crows.

In the Faroe Islands, a now-extinct pied colour morph of this species existed, known as the pied raven; the ordinary black-coloured common ravens remain widespread in the archipelago. White ravens are occasionally found in the wild. Some in British Columbia lacked the pink eyes of an albino, and were instead leucistic, a condition where an animal lacks any of several different types of pigment, not simply melanin.
Common ravens have a wide range of vocalizations which are of interest to ornithologists. Gwinner carried out important studies in the early 1960s, recording and photographing his findings in great detail. Fifteen to 30 categories of calls have been recorded for this species, most of which are used for social interaction. Calls recorded include alarm calls, chase calls, and flight calls. The species has a distinctive, deep, resonant &quot;prruk-prruk-prruk&quot; call, which to experienced listeners is unlike that of any other corvid. Its very wide and complex vocabulary includes a high, knocking &quot;toc-toc-toc&quot;, a dry, grating &quot;kraa&quot;, a low guttural rattle and some calls of an almost musical nature.

Like other corvids, the common raven can mimic sounds from their environment, including human speech. Non-vocal sounds produced by the common raven include wing whistles and bill snapping. Clapping or clicking has been observed more often in females than in males. If a member of a pair is lost, its mate reproduces the calls of its lost partner to encourage its return.

== Distribution and habitat ==

The common raven can thrive in varied climates; it has the largest range of any member of the genus, and one of the largest of any passerine. They range throughout the Holarctic from Arctic and temperate habitats in North America and Eurasia to the deserts of North Africa, and to islands in the Pacific Ocean. In the British Isles, they are more common in Scotland, Wales, western England and Ireland, having been eradicated from other areas by gamekeeping interests. In Tibet, they have been recorded at altitudes up to 5,000 m (16,400 ft), and as high as 6,350 m (20,600 ft) on Mount Everest. The population sometimes known as the &#x27;Punjab raven&#x27;, part of the subspecies &quot;Corvus corax laurencei&quot; (sometimes misnamed &quot;C. c. subcorax&quot;) occurs in the Sindh district of Pakistan and adjoining regions of northwestern India. They are generally resident within their range for the whole year. In his 1950 work, &quot;Grønlands Fugle&quot; [&quot;Birds of Greenland&quot;], noted ornithologist Finn Salomonsen indicated that common ravens did not overwinter in the Arctic. However, in Arctic Canada and Alaska, they are found year-round. Young birds may disperse locally.
In the United Kingdom, the range is currently increasing after improved legal protection, but illegal persecution by gamekeepers remains a problem in many areas. It favours mountainous or coastal terrain, but can also be found in parks with tall trees suitable for use as habitation. Its population is at its most dense in the north and west of the country, though the species is expanding its population southwards.

Most common ravens prefer wooded areas with large expanses of open land nearby, or coastal regions for their nesting sites and feeding grounds. In some areas of dense human population, such as California in the United States, they take advantage of a plentiful food supply and have seen a surge in their numbers. On coasts, individuals of this species are often evenly distributed and prefer to build their nest sites along sea cliffs. Common ravens are often located in coastal regions because these areas provide easy access to water and a variety of food sources. Also, coastal regions have stable weather patterns without extreme cold or hot temperatures.

In general, common ravens live in a wide array of environments but prefer heavily contoured landscapes. When the environment changes in vast degrees, these birds will respond with a stress response. The hormone known as corticosterone is activated by the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. Corticosterone is activated when the bird is exposed to stress, such as migrating great distances.

== Behaviour ==

Common ravens usually travel in mated pairs, although young birds may form flocks. Relationships between common ravens are often quarrelsome, yet they demonstrate considerable devotion to their families.

=== Predation ===
Owing to its size, gregariousness and its defensive abilities, the common raven has few natural predators. Predators of its eggs and chicks include martens, large owls, and sometimes eagles. Ravens are quite vigorous at defending their young and are usually successful at driving off perceived threats. They attack potential predators by flying at them and lunging with their large bills. Humans are occasionally attacked if they get close to a raven nest, though serious injuries are unlikely. There are a few records of large birds of prey taking ravens; more rarely, large mammalian predators such as lynxes, coyotes and cougars have also attacked ravens. This principally occurs at a nest site and when other prey for the carnivores are scarce.

In North America, predators of ravens have reportedly included great horned owls, American goshawks, bald eagles, golden eagles and red-tailed hawks. It is possible that the hawk species only attack young ravens; in one instance a peregrine falcon swooped at a newly fledged raven but was chased off by the parent ravens. Ravens wary around novel carrion sites, and in North America, have been recorded waiting for the presence of American crows and blue jays before approaching to eat.

In Eurasia, their reported predators include, in addition to golden eagles, Eurasian eagle-owls, white-tailed eagles, Steller&#x27;s sea-eagles, eastern imperial eagles and gyrfalcons. Because they are potentially hazardous prey for raptorial birds, raptors must usually take them by surprise and most attacks are on fledgling ravens.

=== Breeding ===
Juveniles begin to court at a very early age, but may not bond for another two or three years. Aerial acrobatics, demonstrations of intelligence, and ability to provide food are key behaviours of courting. Once paired, they tend to nest together for life, usually in the same location. Instances of non-monogamy have been observed in common ravens, by males visiting a female&#x27;s nest when her mate is away.

Breeding pairs must have a territory of their own before they begin nest-building and reproduction, and thus they aggressively defend a territory and its food resources. Nesting territories vary in size according to the density of food resources in the area. The nest is a deep bowl made of large sticks (up to 150 cm long and 2.5 cm thick) and twigs, bound with an inner layer of roots, mud, and bark and lined with a softer material, such as deer fur. The nest is usually placed in a large tree or on a cliff ledge, or less frequently in old buildings or utility poles.

Females usually lay between four to six (rarely two to seven) pale bluish-green, brown-blotched eggs. Incubation is about 18 to 21 days, by the female only. The male may stand or crouch over the young, sheltering but not actually brooding them. The young fledge at 35 to 49 days, and are fed by both parents. They stay with their parents for another six months after fledging.

In most of their range, egg-laying begins in late January or February, but it can be as late as April in colder climates such as Greenland and Tibet. In Pakistan, egg-laying takes place in December, but in north Africa (subspecies &quot;C. c. tingitanus&quot;), later than in Europe, in late March or early April. Eggs and hatchlings are preyed on, rarely, by large hawks and eagles, large owls, martens and canids. The adults, which are very rarely preyed upon, are often successful in defending their young from these predators, due to their numbers, large size and cunning. They have been observed dropping stones on potential predators that venture close to their nests.

Common ravens can be very long-lived, especially in captive or protected conditions; individuals at the Tower of London have lived for more than 40 years. Their lifespans in the wild are shorter, typically 10 to 15 years. The longest known lifespan of a ringed wild common raven was 23 years, 3 months, which among passerines only is surpassed by a few Australian species such as the satin bowerbird.

=== Feeding ===

Common ravens are omnivorous and highly opportunistic: their diet may vary widely with location, season and serendipity. For example, those foraging on tundra on the Arctic North Slope of Alaska obtained about half their energy needs from predation, mainly of microtine rodents, and half by scavenging, mainly of caribou and ptarmigan carcasses.

In some places they are mainly scavengers, feeding on carrion as well as the associated maggots and carrion beetles. With large-bodied carrion, which they are not equipped to tear through as well as birds such as the much larger and hook-billed vultures, they must wait for the prey to be torn open by another predator or flayed by other means. They are also known to eat the afterbirth of ewes and other large mammals. Plant food includes cereal grains, acorns, buds, berries and fruit. They prey on small invertebrates, amphibians, reptiles, small mammals and birds. Ravens may also consume the undigested portions of animal faeces, and human food waste. They store surplus food items, especially those containing fat, and will learn to hide such food out of the sight of other common ravens. Ravens also raid the food caches of other species, such as the Arctic fox. They often associate with another canine, the wolf, as a kleptoparasite, following to scavenge wolf-kills in winter, but also co-operatively, having been observed to lead hunting wolf packs to potential prey that only the ravens can see from the air. Ravens are regular predators at bird nests, brazenly picking off eggs, nestlings and sometimes adult birds when they spot an opportunity. They are considered perhaps the primary natural threat to the nesting success of the critically endangered California condor, since they readily take condor eggs and are very common in the areas where the species is being re-introduced. On the other hand, when they defend their own adjacent nests, they may incidentally benefit condors since they chase golden eagles out of the area that may otherwise prey upon larger nestling and fledging condors. Although condors recognise ravens as threats and will chase them away, their usual nest sites are poorly concealed from ravens; the reason is unknown, but it may be due to the condor&#x27;s lower aerial manoeuvrability, or a holdover from times when condor populations were denser, nest sites more limiting, and ravens less abundant.
Common ravens nesting near sources of human garbage included a higher percentage of food waste in their diet, birds nesting near roads consumed more road-killed vertebrates, and those nesting far from these sources of food ate more arthropods and plant material. Fledging success was higher for those using human garbage as a food source. In contrast, a 1984–1986 study of common raven diet in an agricultural region of southwestern Idaho found that cereal grains were the principal constituent of pellets, though small mammals, grasshoppers, cattle carrion and birds were also eaten.

One behaviour is recruitment, where juvenile ravens call other ravens to a food bonanza, usually a carcass, with a series of loud yells. In &quot;Ravens in Winter&quot;, Bernd Heinrich posited that this behaviour evolved to allow the juveniles to outnumber the resident adults, thus allowing them to feed on the carcass without being chased away. A more mundane explanation is that individuals co-operate in sharing information about carcasses of large mammals because they are too big for just a few birds to exploit. Experiments with baits however show that such recruitment behaviour is independent of the size of the bait.

Furthermore, there has been research suggesting that the common raven is involved in seed dispersal. In the wild, the common raven chooses the best habitat and disperses seeds in locations best suited for its survival.

=== Intelligence ===
The brain of the common raven is among the largest of any bird species. Specifically, their hyperpallium is large for a bird. They display ability in problem-solving, as well as other cognitive processes such as imitation and insight.

Linguist Derek Bickerton, building on the work of biologist Bernd Heinrich, has argued that ravens are one of only four known animals (the others being bees, ants, and humans) who have demonstrated displacement, the capacity to communicate about objects or events that are distant in space or time. Subadult ravens roost together at night, but usually forage alone during the day. However, when one discovers a large carcass guarded by a pair of adult ravens, the unmated raven will return to the roost and communicate the find. The following day, a flock of unmated ravens will fly to the carcass and chase off the adults. Bickerton argues that the advent of linguistic displacement was perhaps the most important event in the evolution of human language, and that ravens are the only other vertebrate to share this with humans.

One experiment designed to evaluate insight and problem-solving ability involved a piece of meat attached to a string hanging from a perch. To reach the food, the bird needed to stand on the perch, pull the string up a little at a time, and step on the loops to gradually shorten the string. Four of five common ravens eventually succeeded, and &quot;the transition from no success (ignoring the food or merely yanking at the string) to constant reliable access (pulling up the meat) occurred with no demonstrable trial-and-error learning.&quot; This supports the hypothesis that common ravens are &#x27;inventors&#x27;, implying that they can solve problems. Many of the feats of common ravens were formerly argued to be stereotyped innate behaviour, but it now has been established that their aptitudes for solving problems individually and learning from each other reflect a flexible capacity for intelligent insight unusual among non-human animals. Another experiment showed that some common ravens could intentionally deceive their conspecifics.

A study published in 2011 found that ravens can recognise when they are given an unfair trade during reciprocal interactions with conspecifics or humans, retaining memory of the interaction for a prolonged period of time. Birds that were given a fair trade by experimenters were found to prefer interacting with these experimenters compared to those that did not. Furthermore, ravens in the wild have also been observed to stop cooperating with other ravens if they observe them cheating during group tasks.

Common ravens have been observed calling wolves to the site of dead animals. The wolves open the carcass, leaving the scraps more accessible to the birds. They watch where other common ravens bury their food and remember the locations of each other&#x27;s food caches, so they can steal from them. This type of theft occurs so regularly that common ravens will fly extra distances from a food source to find better hiding places for food. They have also been observed pretending to make a cache without actually depositing the food, presumably to confuse onlookers.

Common ravens are known to steal and cache shiny objects such as pebbles, pieces of metal, and golf balls. One theory is that they hoard shiny objects to impress other ravens. Other research indicates that juveniles are deeply curious about all new things, and that common ravens retain an attraction to bright, round objects based on their similarity to bird eggs. Mature birds lose their intense interest in the unusual, and become highly neophobic.

The first large-scale assessment of ravens&#x27; cognitive abilities suggests that, by four months of age, ravens do about as well as adult chimpanzees and orangutans on tests of causal reasoning, social learning, theory of mind, etc.

=== Play ===
There has been increasing recognition of the extent to which birds engage in play. Juvenile common ravens are among the most playful of bird species. They have been observed to slide down snowbanks, apparently purely for fun. They even engage in games with other species, such as playing catch-me-if-you-can with wolves, otters and dogs. Common ravens are known for spectacular aerobatic displays, such as flying in loops or interlocking talons with each other in flight.

They are also one of only a few wild animals who make their own toys. They have been observed breaking off twigs to play with socially.

== Relationship with humans ==

=== Conservation and management ===

Compared to many smaller &quot;Corvus&quot; species (such as carrion crow and American crow), ravens prefer undisturbed mountain or forest habitat or rural areas over urban areas. In other areas, their numbers have increased dramatically and they have become agricultural pests. Common ravens can cause damage to crops, such as nuts and grain, or can harm livestock, particularly by killing young goat kids, lambs and calves. Ravens generally attack the faces of young livestock, but the more common raven behaviour of scavenging may be misidentified as predation by ranchers.

In the western Mojave Desert, human settlement and land development have led to an estimated 16-fold increase in the common raven population over 25 years. Towns, landfills, sewage treatment plants and artificial ponds create sources of food and water for scavenging birds. Ravens also find nesting sites in utility poles and ornamental trees, and are attracted to roadkill on highways. The explosion in the common raven population in the Mojave has raised concerns for the desert tortoise, a threatened species. Common ravens prey upon juvenile tortoises, which have soft shells and move slowly. Plans to control the population have included shooting and trapping birds, as well as contacting landfill operators to ask that they reduce the amount of exposed garbage. A hunting bounty as a method of control was historically used in Finland from the mid-18th century until 1923. Culling has taken place to a limited extent in Alaska, where the population increase in common ravens is threatening the vulnerable Steller&#x27;s eider (&quot;Polysticta stelleri&quot;).

Ravens, like other corvids, are definitive hosts of West Nile Virus (WNV). The transmission can be from infected birds to humans, and ravens are susceptible to WNV. However, in a 2010 study, it was shown that the California Common Ravens did not have a high positivity rate of WNV.

=== Cultural depictions ===

Across its range in the Northern Hemisphere, and throughout human history, the common raven has been a powerful symbol and a popular subject of mythology and folklore.

In some Western traditions, ravens have long been considered to be birds of ill omen, death and evil in general, in part because of the negative symbolism of their all-black plumage and the eating of carrion. In Sweden, ravens are known as the ghosts of murdered people, and in Germany as the souls of the damned. In Danish folklore, valravne that ate a king&#x27;s heart gained human knowledge, could perform great malicious acts, could lead people astray, had superhuman powers, and were &quot;terrible animals&quot;.

It continues to be used as a symbol in areas where it once had mythological status: as the national bird of Bhutan (kings of Bhutan wear the Raven Crown), official bird of the Yukon territory, and on the coat of arms of the Isle of Man (once a Viking colony).

In Persia and Arabia, the raven was held as a bird of bad omen but a 14th-century Arabic work reports use of the raven in falconry.

The modern unisex given name &quot;Raven&quot; is derived from the English word &quot;raven&quot;. As a masculine name, &quot;Raven&quot; parallels the Old Norse &quot;Hrafn&quot;, and Old English &quot;*Hræfn&quot;, which were both bynames and personal names.
==== Mythology ====

In Tlingit and Haida cultures, Raven was both a trickster and creator god. Related beliefs are widespread among the peoples of Siberia and northeastern Asia. The Kamchatka Peninsula, for example, was supposed to have been created by the raven god Kutkh. There are several references to common ravens in the Old Testament of the Bible and it is an aspect of Mahakala in Bhutanese mythology.

In Norse mythology, Huginn (from the Old Norse for &quot;thought&quot;) and Muninn (from the Old Norse for &quot;memory&quot; or &quot;mind&quot;) are a pair of ravens that fly all over the world of humans, Midgard, and bring the god Odin information. Additionally among the Norse, raven banner standards were carried by such figures as the Jarls of Orkney, King Cnut the Great of England, Norway and Denmark, and Harald Hardrada. In the British Isles, ravens also were symbolic to the Celts. In Irish mythology, the goddess Morrígan alighted on the hero Cú Chulainn&#x27;s shoulder in the form of a raven after his death. In Welsh mythology they were associated with the Welsh god Brân the Blessed, whose name translates to &quot;raven&quot; and &quot;crow&quot;. According to the &quot;Mabinogion&quot;, Brân&#x27;s head was buried in the White Hill of London as a talisman against invasion.

A legend developed that England would not fall to a foreign invader as long as there were ravens at the Tower of London; although this is often thought to be an ancient belief, the official Tower of London historian, Geoff Parnell, believes that this is actually a romantic Victorian invention.

In the Jewish, Christian and Islamic traditions, the raven was the first animal to be released from Noah&#x27;s Ark. &quot;So it came to pass, at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made. Then he sent out a raven, which kept going to and fro until the waters had dried up from the earth. He also sent out from himself a dove, to see if the waters had receded from the face of the ground.&quot; The raven is mentioned 12 times in the Bible. In the New Testament Jesus tells a parable using the raven to show how people should rely on God for their needs and not riches (). The raven is also mentioned in the Quran at the story of Cain and Abel. Adam&#x27;s firstborn son Cain kills his brother Abel, but he does not know what to do with the corpse: &quot;Then Allah sent a raven scratching up the ground, to show him how to hide his brother&#x27;s naked corpse. He said: Woe unto me! Am I not able to be as this raven and so hide my brother&#x27;s naked corpse? And he became repentant.&quot;

<text>Eckankar ( ) is an American new religious movement founded by Paul Twitchell in 1965. The group’s spiritual home is the Temple of ECK in Chanhassen, Minnesota. Eckankar is not affiliated with any other religious group.

The movement teaches simple spiritual exercises, such as singing &quot;HU&quot;, called &quot;a love song to God&quot;, to experience the &quot;light&quot; and &quot;sound&quot; of God and recognize the presence of the Holy Spirit.

==Etymology==
Twitchell was known for adapting Sanskrit words into English, and the word &quot;Eckankar&quot; is likely Twitchell&#x27;s adaptation of the sacred Sikh phrase &quot;Ik Onkar&quot;, meaning &quot;One &quot;Om&quot;&quot;. &quot;Eck&quot; is intended to mean the &quot;Holy Spirit&quot;, as found in Christian biblical terminology. According to the Eckankar&#x27;s glossary, the term &quot;Eckankar&quot; means &quot;co-worker with God&quot;.

== History ==
The movement was founded in 1965 by Paul Twitchell (spiritual name: Peddar Zaskq), who remained its spiritual leader (called &quot;Living ECK Master&quot;) until his death in September 1971. He was succeeded by Darwin Gross (spiritual name: Dap Ren). On October 22, 1981, Harold Klemp (spiritual name: WahZ) was announced as the spiritual leader. Between 1981 and 1987, both Gross and Klemp claimed to be the Living ECK Master and the Inner Master and had their own followers.

Eckankar&#x27;s headquarters were originally in Las Vegas, Nevada. In 1975, under the leadership of Gross, the organization was moved to Menlo Park, California. In 1986, Klemp moved the base of operations to Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Eckankar is registered as a nonprofit religious organization in the United States. It reports members in more than 120 countries, and its teachings have been translated into over 25 languages. The number of members, known as ECKists, is undisclosed. The world headquarters and Temple of Eck, Eckankar&#x27;s Spiritual Center, are in Chanhassen, Minnesota, on a campus with of contemplation trails open to the public.

The Eckankar &quot;EK&quot; symbol appears on the &quot;Available Emblems of Belief for Placement on Government Headstones and Markers&quot; by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. Sources estimate that there were around 50,000 followers in the 1990s.

==Beliefs==
Some scholars believe that Eckankar beliefs draw in part from the Sikh and Hindu religions, in particular the Radha Soami movement. However, J. Gordon Melton finds significant differences between Radha Soami teachings and Eckankar.

One of the basic tenets is that soul (the true self) may be experienced separate from the physical body and, in full consciousness, travel freely in &quot;other planes of reality.&quot; Eckankar emphasizes personal spiritual experiences as the most natural way back to God. These are attained via Soul Travel: shifting the awareness from the body to the inner planes of existence.

Certain mantras or chants are used to facilitate spiritual growth. One important spiritual exercise of Eckankar is the singing or chanting of &quot;HU&quot;, which is viewed in Eckankar as a &quot;love song to God.&quot; It is pronounced like the English word &quot;hue&quot; (or &quot;hyoo&quot;) in a long, drawn-out breath and is sung for about twenty minutes to half an hour. ECKists sing it alone or in small groups. ECKists believe that singing &quot;HU&quot; draws one closer in state of consciousness to the Divine Being and that it can expand awareness, help one experience divine love, heal broken hearts, offer solace in times of grief, and bring peace and calm. ECKists believe the practice allows the practitioner to retreat from the overwhelming input of the physical senses and emotions and regain the Soul&#x27;s spiritually higher viewpoint.

Dreams are regarded as important teaching tools, and members often keep dream journals to facilitate study. According to followers of Eckankar, dream travel often serves as the gateway to Soul Travel, (also known by Eckankar as an out-of-body experience) or the shifting of one&#x27;s consciousness to ever-higher states of being. Soul travel was a new term created by Twitchell.

Eckankar teaches that &quot;spiritual liberation&quot; in one&#x27;s lifetime is available to all and that it is possible to achieve &quot;Self-realization&quot; (the realization of oneself as Soul) and &quot;God-realization&quot; (the realization of oneself as a &quot;spark&quot; of God) in one&#x27;s lifetime. The membership card Eckankar followers carry states, &quot;The aim and purpose of Eckankar has always been to take Soul by its own path back to its divine source.&quot;

The final spiritual goal of all ECKists is to become conscious &quot;co-workers&quot; with God.

The leader of Eckankar is known as &quot;the Living ECK Master&quot; (LEM). Eckankar claims that only a man can be the LEM as the Soul needs the atom structure of a male body in the physical world to become the spiritual leader, a choice made before birth. Eckankar now claims that some leaders—Twitchell and Klemp, for example—also hold the title &quot;Mahanta&quot;, which refers to the inner aspect of the teacher. During Gross&#x27;s ten-year leadership (1971–1981), the nonprofit religious organization claimed he was the Mahanta. The leader functions as both an inner and outer guide for each member&#x27;s spiritual progress.

ECKists believe that contact with a divine spirit, which they call the &quot;ECK&quot;, can be made via the spiritual exercises of ECK and the guidance of the LEM. It is held that the ECK Masters serve all life irrespective of religious belief. The main Eckankar website includes a list of Masters—some of whom are historical figures.

The &quot;Shariyat-Ki-Sugmad&quot;, which means &quot;Way of the Eternal&quot;, is the holy scripture of Eckankar. It comprises two books of spiritual meaning and purpose written by the Mahanta. There is also a series of Satsang writings that are available with yearly membership in Eckankar. There are Satsang classes available to study discourses with others and individually.

Some of the key beliefs taught in the &quot;Shariyat-Ki-Sugmad&quot; include &quot;Soul Travel&quot;, karma, reincarnation, love, &quot;Light and Sound&quot;, and many other spiritual topics. ECKists believe &quot;Sugmad&quot; is the endless source from which all forms were created and that the ECK, the &quot;Sound Current&quot;, flows out of &quot;Sugmad&quot; and into lower dimensions.

Primary to the teaching is the belief that one may experience the perspective of the Soul beyond the body&#x27;s limits. Also, the concepts of karma and reincarnation help to explain situations in life as the playing out of past causes.

The beliefs that individuals are responsible for their destiny and that their decisions determine their future are important concepts to Eckankar. Eckankar students meet in open public services and classes to discuss personal experiences, topics, books, and discourses.

==Ceremonies and rites==
There are few personal requirements to be an ECKist; however, certain spiritual practices are recommended. Chief among these is daily practice of the &quot;Spiritual Exercises of ECK&quot; for 15–20 minutes. The most basic ECK spiritual exercise is singing the syllable &quot;HU&quot;. Various spiritual exercises are offered, and members are encouraged to create their own. Study of ECK books and written discourses, alone or in groups, is also encouraged. There are no dietary requirements, taboos, or enforced ascetic practices. Eckankar does not require potential members to leave their current faith.

There are several ceremonies an ECKist can experience as part of the teaching, including a Consecration ceremony for initiating the young and infants, a Rite of Passage into adulthood (around age 13), a Wedding ceremony, and a Memorial service.

September 17 is celebrated as Founder&#x27;s Day in honor of Paul Twitchell. October 22 is celebrated as the spiritual new year.

<doc id="380790" wikidata="Q2995599" url="?curid=380790" title="Rekishi monogatari">
<text>Rekishi monogatari (歴史物語) is a category of Japanese literature defined as extended prose narrative. Structurally, the name is composed of the Japanese words &quot;rekishi&quot; (歴史), meaning history, and &quot;monogatari&quot; (物語), meaning tale or narrative. Because of this it is commonly translated as ‘historical tale’. Although now categorised as works of fiction, Japanese readers before the nineteenth century traditionally accepted and read &quot;rekishi monogatari,&quot; as well as the related &quot;gunki monogatari&quot; and earlier &quot;Six National Histories&quot;, as literal and chronological historical accounts.

== History ==

=== Creation of &quot;monogatari&quot; ===
&quot;Monogatari&quot; is categorised as Japanese extended prose literature, and is comparable to the epic novel. It first emerged in the late &quot;Heian period&quot;, which held dominion from 749-1573 C.E. It is believed to have originated from the oral tradition of the court ladies at the time. This is supported through the language used in examples of &quot;monogatari&quot;, which was typically either &quot;kanbun&quot;, a hybrid form of Chinese, or &quot;kana&quot;, Japanese. &quot;Kanbun&quot; was a form of Classical Chinese, and was the principal writing style used for official or intellectual works; &quot;kana&quot;, despite its high level of verbal fluency amongst Japanese people, was known in written form in the Heian Period predominantly by nobility and monks. &quot;Monogatari&quot; is further supported as having originated amongst court ladies through the knowledge that, during the Heian period, men typically wrote in Chinese, therefore the use of Japanese and hybridised Chinese suggests women developed this form of Japanese prose as a method of storytelling. 
Some early &quot;monogatari&quot; are believed to be written by men using female pseudonyms.

=== Legacy of &quot;monogatari&quot; ===
&quot;Monogatari&quot; was highly prevalent between the 9th to the 15th century. During this period several sub-categories of &quot;monogatari&quot; were created in response to cultural and historical change at the time, for example &quot;gunki monogatari&quot;. As a result, &quot;monogatari&quot; are still used as historical sources and means to learn about the past eras, knowledge, and culture of Japan. 
The introduction of European and other foreign literature to Japan began the implementation of the word &quot;monogatari&quot; in Japanese titles of foreign works of a similar nature. For example, &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; is known as &quot;Nito Monogatari&quot; (二都物語), &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; as &quot;Sen&#x27;ichiya Monogatari&quot; (千一夜物語) and more recently &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; as &quot;Yubiwa Monogatari&quot; (指輪物語), and &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; as &quot;Arabama Monogatari&quot; (アラバマ物語). However, its prevalence as a literature category has since greatly decreased, with there being only 24 &quot;monogatari&quot; today, in comparison to the 198 that existed in the 13th century.

Many of Japan’s most famous folktales, such as &quot;Taketori Monogatari, The&quot; &quot;Tale of the Bamboo Cutter&quot;, are examples of early &quot;monogatari&quot;.

=== Creation of &quot;rekishi monogatari&quot; ===
&quot;Rekishi monogatari&quot; was created as a sub-genre of &quot;monogatari&quot; soon after the establishment of &quot;monogatari&quot; itself. This is supported in the identical nature of the writing style of early &quot;monogatari&quot; and &quot;rekishi monogatari&quot;, with &quot;rekishi monogatari&quot; also written in &quot;kanbun&quot; and/or &quot;kana&quot;. Further evidence supporting this is the first recorded &quot;rekishi monogatari&quot; dating back to the late Heian period, the same time of emergence as &quot;monogatari&quot; itself. &quot;Rekishi monogatari&quot; similarly emerged in Japanese courts, with its purpose being a method of recounting stories or events. At the time of its creation, &quot;rekishi monogatari&quot; was viewed as historically accurate accounts, seen in how early works were used primarily as official court histories.

=== Evolution of r&quot;ekishi monogatari&quot; ===
&quot;Rekishi monogatari&quot; originally referred to accurate accounts of events, most often official court documents. As time progressed the definition was redefined to encompass fictional or fictionalised tales as well.

== Structure and style ==
&quot;Rekishi monogatari&quot; is characterised as having an orderly, chronological structure. It typically follows the three-act structure of a classic narrative, coherently presenting to the reader a linear beginning, middle, and end. The tale’s focal figures are memorable, the complication(s) are clear. Themes often include loyalty, obligation, the supernatural, and self-sacrifice compromised by human emotion.

== Prevalence ==
&quot;Rekishi monogatari&quot; was a common form of literature in Japan from its origin in the late Heian Period up until Japan’s mediaeval age, after which its prevalence drastically decreased. Its numbers have since continued to decrease.

== Notable works ==

=== Eiga Monogatari ===

Of the category &quot;rekishi monogatari&quot; there are several notable works, one of which is &quot;Eiga Monogatari&quot; (栄花物語), translated in English to &quot;The Story of Splendour&quot;. The work is believed to have been written by multiple authors over the course of 1028-1107 C.E. While its creation predates the genesis of the literature sub-category &quot;rekishi monogatari&quot;, the definition of &quot;rekishi monogatari&quot;, as an accurate historical account or fictional or fictionalised historical tale, allows works written before its inception to be classified under its genre.

&quot;Eiga Monogatari&quot; is classified as &quot;rekishi monogatari&quot; due to its retelling of the events in the life of Japanese statesman, or courtier, &quot;Fujiwara no Michinaga&quot;. It references both official court histories and other known prose of that era. The forty scrolls which comprise the text are written entirely in &quot;kana&quot;, and include many excerpts from diaries and notes of court ladies. Twenty-eight of these scrolls are devoted to Michinaga&#x27;s governance, while the remaining twelve concern related topics, including other aspects of his life and the lives of his family.

=== The four Kagamimono ===
The &quot;shikyō&quot; (四鏡, しきょう), translated in English to &quot;Four Mirrors&quot;, are four Japanese histories in the &quot;rekishi monogatari&quot; genre from the late Heian period to the early Muromachi period. They are also known as &quot;kagami mono&quot; (鏡物, かがみもの). The four works are:
*&quot;Ōkagami (The Great Mirror)&quot;
*&quot;Imakagami (Today&#x27;s Mirror)&quot;
*&quot;Mizukagami (The Water Mirror)&quot;
*&quot;Masukagami (The Clear Mirror)&quot;

Further notable works include:
*&quot;Rokudai Shōjiki&quot;
*&quot;Ike no mokuzu&quot; (『池の藻屑』:ja:荒木田麗女)

== Legacy ==
Historically, &quot;rekishi monogatari&quot; was understood to be accurate or mildly embellished tales of events or journeys; in the current times, &quot;rekishi monogatari&quot; is primarily understood to refer to fictional, historical tales. 

While &quot;monogatari&quot; are still being created, &quot;rekishi monogatari&quot; as a genre is no longer active due to it being categorised as historical tales in the classical literature era of Japan. As such, the number of existing &quot;rekishi monogatari&quot; have greatly decreased due to loss as a result of time and age.

<doc id="380795" wikidata="Q982915" url="?curid=380795" title="Dong Xi">
<text>Dong Xi (died 217), courtesy name Yuanshi, was a military general serving under the warlords Sun Ce and Sun Quan during the late Eastern Han dynasty of China.

==Service under Sun Ce==
Dong Xi was from Yuyao County (餘姚縣), Kuaiji Commandery, which is present-day Yuyao, Zhejiang. He was eight &quot;chi&quot; tall (approximately 184–190 cm) and was described to be ambitious, generous and highly skilled in combat. In 196, after Sun Ce occupied Kuaiji during his conquests in the Jiangdong region, Dong Xi welcomed him at Gaoqian Village (高遷亭). Sun Ce was impressed with Dong Xi at first sight and recruited the latter to serve him. Dong Xi became a Chief Constable (賊曹) under Sun Ce. At the time, the bandits Huang Longluo (黃龍羅) and Zhou Bo (周勃) had gathered thousands of followers in Shanyin (山陰; in present-day Shaoxing, Zhejiang). Sun Ce led his army to attack the bandits. Dong Xi participated in the campaign and slew the two bandit chiefs in the midst of battle. For his achievements, he was promoted to Major of Separate Command (別部司馬), placed in charge of thousands of troops, and appointed as Commandant Who Spreads Martial Might (揚武都尉). He also joined Sun Ce in the campaigns against Liu Xun at Xunyang (尋陽) and Huang Zu at Jiangxia Commandery (江夏郡; around present-day Xinzhou District, Wuhan, Hubei).

After Sun Ce was assassinated in 200 CE, Lady Wu (the mother of Sun Ce and Sun Quan) was worried that Sun Quan, who had succeeded his elder brother, would be too young to handle the precarious situation in Jiangdong. She consulted Dong Xi about her concerns, and Dong reassured her by saying, &quot;The lands in Jiangdong enjoy natural barriers from mountains and rivers, while the good government and virtue of Sun Ce have already won the hearts of the people. The young lord can build on these foundations so that everyone can follow his commands. Zhang Zhao can take charge of internal affairs, while others like me can serve as &#x27;claws and teeth&#x27; (a euphemism for military servicemen). With both geographical advantage and popular support, there is certainly nothing to worry about.&quot; His positive speech was applauded by many.

==Service under Sun Quan==
Once, Peng Hu (彭虎) from Poyang (鄱陽) rallied thousands of followers and started a rebellion against Sun Quan. Dong Xi, along with Ling Tong, Bu Zhi and Jiang Qin, led separate forces to attack the rebels. Dong Xi knocked down all opposition in his way, and Peng Hu fled when he recognised Dong&#x27;s banner from a distance away. The revolt was suppressed within 10 days. Dong Xi was appointed as Colonel of Surpassing Might (威越校尉) and was later promoted to Lieutenant-General (偏將軍) for his efforts.

In 208, Sun Quan launched a punitive expedition against Huang Zu to avenge his father, who was killed in a battle against Huang around 17 years ago, leading to the Battle of Jiangxia. After losing his vanguard commander to Ling Tong, Huang Zu scuttled two &quot;mengchong&quot;s to block the channel across Miankou (沔口), and had a long rope made of coir-palm fibre secured across the gateway, with stones attached to the rope as anchors. In addition to all these defensive measures, Huang Zu also stationed more than 1,000 crossbowmen at Miankou, who rained arrows upon Sun Quan&#x27;s forces when the latter attempted to push further. Dong Xi and Ling Tong were both commanders of Sun Quan&#x27;s vanguard force. Each of them led 100 &quot;commandos&quot; wearing two layers of armour, boarded a large boat, and charged towards Huang Zu&#x27;s &quot;mengchong&quot;s. Dong Xi managed to cut the rope with his sword and clear the blockade. The bulk of Sun Quan&#x27;s army then resumed its advance. Huang Zu escaped through a gate but was pursued and killed by one of Sun Quan&#x27;s horsemen. While Ling Tong, Dong Xi and others conquered Jiangxia and massacred his population. The following day, Sun Quan held a banquet to celebrate the victory, during which he toasted to Dong Xi, &quot;The purpose of today&#x27;s feast is to honour the person who cut the rope!&quot;

In 217, when the warlord Cao Cao led an army to attack Sun Quan&#x27;s fortress at Ruxu (濡須), Dong Xi accompanied Sun Quan to the frontline to resist the invaders. Dong Xi was appointed as the captain of a five-storey warship (五樓船) and ordered to defend the entrance to Ruxu. One night, a heavy storm broke out and threatened to capsize the warship. Dong Xi&#x27;s subordinates evacuated the warship and boarded the smaller boats (走舸; &quot;zouge&quot;s) and pleaded for him to join them. However, Dong Xi replied sternly, &quot;I&#x27;ve received orders to defend this position from the enemy. How can I abandon my post like this? Anyone who dares to speak of this again will be executed!&quot; He then remained alone on the ship, which eventually sank and brought him down as well. Sun Quan donned mourning attire and personally attended Dong Xi&#x27;s funeral. He later gave out heavy rewards to Dong Xi&#x27;s family to honour Dong&#x27;s loyalty and courage.

<text>Prof Sergei Lvovich Sobolev, FRSE (; 6 October 1908 – 3 January 1989) was a Soviet mathematician working in mathematical analysis and partial differential equations.

Sobolev introduced notions that are now fundamental for several areas of mathematics. Sobolev spaces can be defined by some growth conditions on the Fourier transform. They and their embedding theorems are an important subject in functional analysis. Generalized functions (later known as distributions) were first introduced by Sobolev in 1935 for weak solutions, and further developed by Laurent Schwartz. Sobolev abstracted the classical notion of differentiation, so expanding the range of application of the technique of Newton and Leibniz. The theory of distributions is considered now as the calculus of the modern epoch.

==Life==
He was born in St. Petersburg as the son of Lev Alexandrovich Sobolev, a lawyer, and his wife, Natalya Georgievna. His city was renamed Petrograd in his youth and then Leningrad in 1924.

Sobolev studied mathematics at Leningrad University and graduated in 1929, having studied under Professor Nikolai Günther. After graduation, he worked with Vladimir Smirnov, whom he considered as his second teacher. He worked in Leningrad from 1932, and at the Steklov Mathematical Institute in Moscow from 1934. He headed the institute in evacuation to Kazan during World War II. He was a Moscow State University Professor of Mathematics from 1935 to 1957 and also a deputy director of the Institute for Atomic Energy from 1943 to 1957 where he participated in the A-bomb project of the USSR.
In 1958, he led with Nikolay Brusentsov the development of the ternary computer Setun.

In 1956, Sobolev joined a number of scientists in proposing a large-scale scientific and educational initiative for the Eastern parts of the Soviet Union, which resulted in the creation of the Siberian Division of the Academy of Sciences. He was the founder and first director of the Institute of Mathematics at Akademgorodok near Novosibirsk, which was later to bear his name, and played an important role in the establishment and development of Novosibirsk State University. In 1962, he called for a reform of the Soviet education system.

He died in Moscow.

==Family==

In 1930 he married Ariadna Dmitrievna.

==Publications==

In 1955 he co-wrote &quot;The Main Features of Cybernetics&quot; with Alexey Lyapunov and Anatoly Kitov which was published in &quot;Voprosy filosofii&quot;.

==History==
The Sakishima Islands were first documented in the &quot;Shoku Nihongi&quot; (797), which says that in 714 paid tribute to Dazaifu with 52 islanders from , , and other islands. &quot;Shigaki&quot; is believed to be the current , &quot;Kumi&quot; to be the current or settlement of Iriomote. The &quot;History of Yuan&quot; (1370) documented a castaway from &quot;Mìyágǔ&quot; (密牙古) arrived to Wenzhou in 1317. This is believed to be the first documentation of .

Stone tools and shell tools from 2,500 years ago have been excavated from shell mounds on the Sakishima Islands. Shell tools of the same era are also found in Taiwan and the Philippines, but not on Okinawa Island or Amami. Thus those islands are thought to have had a stronger or closer cultural relationship with Taiwan, the Philippines, and other regions which are Austronesian-speaking.

Local earthenware was made beginning in the 11th century. Many local leaders, known as &quot;aji&quot;, appeared in the 15th century. At the same time, the political authorities on Okinawa saw the outlying islands as useful stopping points along a maritime trade route, and gradually enhanced their influence. unified Miyako in 1365, and paid tribute to Satto, the king of the Chūzan kingdom of Okinawa.

===Ryukyuan control===

In 1500, , &quot;Aji&quot; of Ishigaki, unified most of the Yaeyama Islands and rose up in resistance against the Ryukyu Kingdom by refusing to pay further tribute. As he was planning to invade Miyako, , &quot;Aji&quot; of Miyako, discovered the plan and launched a preemptive invasion of the Yaeyama Islands. Oyake Akahachi was defeated at Furusutobaru Castle, and Nakasone Tuyumya went on to conquer Yonaguni. King Shō Shin of Ryukyu responded to the initial rebellion by sending troops, but they arrived at Miyako after most of the fighting had ended. The Ryukyuan army consisted of 3,000 soldiers and 100 ships; Nakasone Tuyumya chose to surrender instead of fighting, handing over all of the Sakishima Islands to Ryukyu.

The Shimazu clan of the Japanese feudal domain of Satsuma invaded the kingdom during the 1609 Invasion of Ryukyu. Satsuma was able to capture Shuri Castle and King Shō Nei by early May, then sent a message to the Sakishima Islands demanding their surrender, which they complied with. In the following centuries of vassalage to Satsuma, the Ryukyuan government was placed under extreme tax pressure, and instituted a heavy poll tax in the Sakishima Islands. As a result of the extreme economic conditions, infanticide and other methods of population control became common, as they did throughout the Ryukyu Islands; remains of the sites where this took place can still be found throughout the Sakishima Islands. Yaeyama islanders were taxed even more heavily than those of Miyako, as the rebel Oyake Akahachi was from Yaeyama. The kingdom prohibited migration of islanders, isolating them to prevent group resistance. The Yaeyama earthquake in 1771 caused a tsunami which killed 12,000, or a half of the entire Sakishima population. Because the soil was adversely affected by salination, famines were frequent, and the population of the islands further decreased until the early Meiji period.

===Japanese control===
After the Meiji Restoration, in 1872, the Japanese government unilaterally declared that the Ryukyu Kingdom was then Ryukyu Domain and began incorporating the islands as a part of Japan. In 1879, after the Ryukyuan government resisted and disobeyed orders from Tokyo, Japan abolished the domain, deposed the king, and established Okinawa Prefecture. The Qing dynasty of China, however, opposed the action, claiming sovereignty over the former kingdom. Japan proposed to cede the Sakishima Islands, provided China add &quot;most favored nation&quot; status of Japan to the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Amity. China agreed at first, but after objections from Viceroy Li Hongzhang, the agreement was not made. China effectively conceded its claims to sovereignty over Ryukyu, including the Sakishima Islands, following its defeat by Japan in the Sino-Japanese War of 1894–95.

The modernization of Sakishima by the Japanese government was slow compared with Japan or even Okinawa. The heavy poll tax continued until as late as 1903. Meanwhile, the islands, as well as Taiwan, used Western Standard Time (UTC+8) until 1937, 1 hour behind the Central Standard Time of Japan (UTC+9).

During World War II, there was an air battle waged against the Sakishima Islands&#x27; two largest islands that lasted for 82 days in order to neutralize Kamikaze airfields. Twenty-five US escort carriers, five larger fast carriers with their air groups consisting of fighters and torpedo bombers along with heavy naval patrol bombers and an assortment of DD-Destroyers and DE-Destroyer Escorts along with the British Pacific Fleet bombed, rocketed and fired their guns at runways and other targets daily while the land battle raged on Okinawa 175 miles away. This was the least publicized battle for its size that took place involving the Americans and British during the war. The thirty-two thousand seasoned Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) and Naval (IJN) troops on Miyako did not surrender until 27 days after Japan formally surrendered. The amount of ordnance expended against the Sakishima Islands may have exceeded the ordnance spent on the island of Iwo Jima. The Sakishima Islands did not suffer a ground invasion during World War II, although a great deal of anti-submarine warfare and convoy battles took place in the waters immediately surrounding the archipelago in the years leading up to the Okinawa campaign. A number of American and Japanese submarines were lost on the approaches to these islands as they formed a vital outlying defense to the Empire&#x27;s shipping bottlenecks in the Formosa (Taiwan) and Luzon Straits.

In June 1945, the Japanese government ordered locals to evacuate to northern Ishigaki and Iriomote, where 3,647 of them lost their lives to malaria. In contrast, air raids killed much fewer: 174. After the Imperial Japanese Army was defeated on Okinawa later that month, there was a vacuum of military and government control in the Sakishima Islands. Some garrison troops robbed crops from farms or engaged in violence against locals. To counter them, the residents of Ishigaki formed the . Since it acted as a temporary local government, some historians later described the association as the .

===American control===
United States Occupation authorities declared the establishment of military rule in December 1945, restoring Miyako Subprefecture and Yaeyama Subprefecture. The local association ceased operation. In 1952, the Treaty of San Francisco confirmed these islands to be under American control. Malaria was eradicated from the island in 1961. The islands were returned to Japan in 1972, along with the rest of Okinawa Prefecture.

===Today===
Today the Sakishima Islands enjoy a thriving tourist industry. As part of the Sakishima Islands are the Senkaku Islands, which fall under Okinawa Prefecture and Ishigaki City politically. The Japanese Self Defense Force and Japan Coast Guard maintain a large presence in the Sakishima Islands.

==Culture==
There are three native languages on the islands; Miyako language on the Miyako Islands, Yonaguni language on Yonaguni, and Yaeyama language on the other Yaeyama Islands. All these languages belong to the Southern Ryukyuan branch of the Ryukyuan languages group, which in turn belong to the Japonic languages group. These languages are not mutually intelligible. As on Okinawa, therefore, standard Japanese language is used in formal situations, while Okinawan Japanese, that is, standard Japanese with native Ryukyuan words, pronunciation changes, etc. mixed in, is quite commonly used as well.

<doc id="380801" wikidata="Q701493" url="?curid=380801" title="Chen Wu (Han dynasty)">
<text>Chen Wu (177 - 215), courtesy name Zilie, was a military general serving under the warlord Sun Quan in the late Eastern Han dynasty. He previously served under Sun Ce, Sun Quan&#x27;s elder brother and predecessor.

==Life==
Chen Wu was from Songzi County (松滋縣), Lujiang Commandery (廬江郡), which is in present-day Susong County, Anhui. He was seven &quot;chi&quot; and seven &quot;cun&quot; tall (approximately 181–186 cm). When he was about 17 years old, he travelled to Shouchun (壽春; present-day Shou County, Anhui) to meet Sun Ce, who was then a subordinate of the warlord Yuan Shu. Chen Wu later accompanied Sun Ce on his conquests in the Jiangdong region in the 190s, and was appointed as a Major of Separate Command (別部司馬) for his contributions in battle. He also followed Sun Ce to attack a minor warlord Liu Xun and helped to recruit many capable men from Lujiang to join Sun Ce&#x27;s army, with him as their commander.

After Sun Ce&#x27;s death in the year 200, Chen Wu continued serving under Sun Quan, Sun Ce&#x27;s younger brother and successor. He was put in command of five regiments. Chen Wu was known to a kind and generous person, and he won the hearts of many people from his hometown and other places. He was deeply favoured by Sun Quan, who visited his house on several occasions. Chen Wu was later promoted to Lieutenant-General (偏將軍) for his achievements.

In 215, Chen Wu followed Sun Quan to attack Hefei, a city under the control of a rival warlord Cao Cao, which led to the Battle of Xiaoyao Ford. Sun Quan&#x27;s forces suffered a disastrous defeat at the hands of Cao Cao&#x27;s general Zhang Liao, who was defending Hefei. Chen Wu was killed in action.

Sun Quan mourned Chen Wu&#x27;s death and attended the latter&#x27;s funeral. Sun Quan also had Chen Wu&#x27;s favourite concubine sacrificed to join Chen in death, and he awarded Chen&#x27;s family 200 taxable households in their estate. The historian Sun Sheng criticised Sun Quan&#x27;s act of forcing Chen Wu&#x27;s concubine to join Chen in death, citing an earlier negative example of Duke Mu of Qin and a positive example of Wei Ke (魏顆).

==Descendants==
Chen Wu had two sons – Chen Xiu (陳脩) and Chen Biao.

Chen Xiu had a personality which resembled his father&#x27;s. When he was 19 years old, Sun Quan summoned him and appointed him as a Major of Separate Command (別部司馬) and put him in charge of 500 troops. At the time, many newly recruited soldiers were unwilling to serve in the army so they deserted. However, Chen Xiu treated his men well and not a single soldier under him deserted. Sun Quan was surprised and pleased, so he promoted Chen Xiu to Colonel (校尉). In the late 210s, when Sun Quan granted awards to the descendants of his deceased subjects to honour his subjects for their service, Chen Xiu received the title of a Marquis of a Chief Village (都亭侯) in recognition of his father&#x27;s contributions. He later became a commander in the &quot;jiefan&quot; (解煩) corps, one of the elite units in Sun Quan&#x27;s military forces. He died in 229, shortly after Sun Quan proclaimed himself emperor and established the state of Eastern Wu.

Chen Biao was born to one of Chen Wu&#x27;s concubines. He also served in Eastern Wu. After Chen Biao&#x27;s death, his son Chen Ao (陳敖) was commissioned as a Major of Separate Command (別部司馬) at the age of 16 and was placed in charge of 400 troops.

When Chen Ao died, his military appointment was inherited by his cousin Chen Yan (陳延), who was Chen Xiu&#x27;s son. Chen Yan had a younger brother, Chen Yong (陳延), who became a general and received a marquis title.

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==
Although no details were given on how Chen Wu died at the Battle of Xiaoyao Ford in 215, his death was dramatised in chapter 68 of the historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; by Luo Guanzhong, which romanticises the historical events before and during the Three Kingdoms period. In the novel, Chen Wu encountered Pang De (who had recently joined Cao Cao&#x27;s forces) in another battle right after the Battle of Xiaoyao Ford. While fighting with Pang De, he was driven into a valley full of thick vegetation and his sleeve was caught in some tree branches. He was killed by Pang De while attempting to free himself.

<doc id="380802" wikidata="Q723134" url="?curid=380802" title="Jim Inhofe">
<text>James Mountain Inhofe (; ; November 17, 1934 – July 9, 2024) was an American politician who served as a United States senator from Oklahoma from 1994 to 2023. A member of the Republican Party, he was the longest serving U.S. senator from Oklahoma. He served in various elected offices in the state of Oklahoma for nearly 60 years, between 1966 and 2023.

Born in Des Moines, Iowa, in 1934, Inhofe moved with his parents to Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 1942. His father, Perry Inhofe, was an owner of insurance companies and his mother, Blanche Inhofe (née Mountain), was a Tulsa socialite. Jim was a high school track star and graduated from Central High School. He went on to briefly attend the University of Colorado before finishing his college degree at the University of Tulsa. He was drafted to the United States Army in 1956 and served between 1957 and 1958. He became vice-president of his father&#x27;s insurance company in 1961 and president after his father&#x27;s death in 1970.

Inhofe was an elected official representing the Tulsa area for nearly three decades. He represented parts of Tulsa in the Oklahoma House of Representatives from 1966 to 1969 and the Oklahoma Senate from 1969 to 1977. During his time in the state legislature he was known for feuding with the Democratic Party&#x27;s state leadership, particularly Governor David Hall and state treasurer Leo Winters, and spearheading the movement to bring the USS &quot;Batfish&quot; to Oklahoma. While a state senator, he unsuccessfully ran for Governor of Oklahoma in the 1974 election and the U.S. House in 1976. He was elected to three terms as the Mayor of Tulsa, serving between 1978 and 1984. He served in the United States House of Representatives representing from 1987 to 1994; he resigned after his election to the United States Senate.

During his Senate career, Inhofe was known for his rejection of climate science; on one prominent occasion, he displayed a snowball in winter on the U.S. Senate floor as evidence that Earth was not warming. He was also known for his support of constitutional amendments to ban same-sex marriage, and the Inhofe Amendment to make English the national language of the United States. Inhofe chaired the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works (EPW) and the Armed Services Committee. 

== Family, early life, and education==
James Mountain Inhofe was born in Des Moines, Iowa, on November 17, 1934, the son of Blanche (née Mountain) and Perry Dyson Inhofe. He moved with his family to Tulsa, Oklahoma, after his father became president of the National Mutual Casualty company in August 1942. His father, Perry Inhofe, was educated at Duke University and worked as a lawyer, president of multiple insurance companies, and banker. In 1949 his company, Tri-State, was ordered by the National Labor Relations Board to cease discouraging union membership. His father was also active in the Tulsa Chamber of Commerce and YMCA; and he was the official sponsor of Miss Tulsa and Miss Oklahoma winner Louise O&#x27;Brien in 1950. His mother was a Tulsa socialite and hosted guests such as Johnston Murray.

Inhofe&#x27;s family had been involved in Oklahoma politics since the 1950s. His father, Perry Inhofe, had served on the executive committee for Democratic governor Raymond D. Gary&#x27;s successful 1954 campaign. In 1958, his brother, Perry Jr., ran an unsuccessful campaign for the Oklahoma House of Representatives as a Democrat.

===Education, military and business careers===
Inhofe started kindergarten in Des Moines, Iowa, but moved halfway through the year to Hazel Dell in Springfield, Illinois. He skipped first grade after the schoolhouse burned down and started second grade after his family moved to Tulsa at Barnard Elementary School. As a teenager, he would &quot;hire Indians to pick wild blackberries&quot; and then sell them in his neighborhood. He went on to attend Woodrow Wilson Junior High and Tulsa Central High School, where he was a member of his high school&#x27;s track team. In 1952, his mile relay quartet team broke a school record with a 3:32.6 time. In January 1953, he was elected treasurer of the Brones social club; he graduated from Central High School later that year. He attended the University of Colorado for three months and worked as a bartender.

In 1956, he received a draft letter from the United States Army and he served from 1957 to 1958. He attained the rank of Specialist 4 and spent most of his service performing quartermaster duties at Fort Lee, Virginia. In 1961, his father formed a new life insurance company, Quaker Insurance, and Inhofe was appointed vice president. On June 17, 1970, Perry Inhofe died of a heart attack; Inhofe became president of Quaker Life Insurance and vice president of Mid-Continental Casualty Co. and Oklahoma Surety Co., while his brother Perry Jr. became president of Mid-Continental and Surety and vice president of Quaker Life. Inhofe and his brother eventually ended up in litigation over the companies that ended in 1990 with Perry paying $3 million to his brother.

====College graduation scandal====
Inhofe received a B.A. in economics from the University of Tulsa in 1973. Until his 1994 campaign for the U.S. Senate, his official biographies and news articles about him indicated that he had graduated in 1959. Inhofe initially denied the stories that uncovered the discrepancy, but later acknowledged them. After admitting that the stories were true, Inhofe explained that he had been allowed to take part in graduation ceremonies in 1959 though he was a few credits short of completing his degree, and did not finish his coursework until 1973.

==State legislative career==
===Oklahoma House of Representatives===
In February 1966, Inhofe launched his first campaign for office as a Republican; he ran for the Oklahoma House of Representatives&#x27;s 71st district against incumbent representative Warren Green. He lost the May primary election and then worked on J. Robert Wooten&#x27;s 1966 lieutenant gubernatorial campaign as the Tulsa County campaign chair. In November 1966, Joseph McGraw resigned from the Oklahoma House of Representatives 70th district to run for newly elected governor Dewey Bartlett&#x27;s former state senate seat, triggering a special election. Inhofe was the first to announced his campaign for McGraw&#x27;s former house seat. He won the Republican primary and the general election. He was sworn in December 29, 1966. During his time in the State House, Inhofe formed a close friendship with Democratic Representative David Boren.

In the Oklahoma House, Inhofe&#x27;s first successful measure was a bill to allow for personalized license plates in Oklahoma that passed during his first legislative session. During his first term, he spoke against federal regulation at the United States House Committee on Public Works Sub-committee on Roads and voted in favor of an abortion liberalization law. In 1968, he served as the vice-chair of the rules committee for the Oklahoma Republican Party state convention. That May, he announced he would not seek re-election to the Oklahoma House of Representatives and instead would challenge Democrat state senator Beauchamp Selman for his seat in the next election.

===Oklahoma Senate===
====Election, first term, and USS &quot;Batfish&quot;====
After Inhofe had already announced his campaign for the Oklahoma Senate, Beauchamp Selman announced he would not seek re-election, creating an open seat for the 1968 election. He faced Madison J. Bowers, who was endorsed by the Political Action Committee of Educators, in the Republican primary election. He won the primary and faced Democratic nominee Jerry L. Goodman in the general election. Governor Dewey Bartlett knocked doors with Inhofe during his campaign and he later won the general election. After winning the special election, Republican party officials began considering Inhofe as a potential future U.S. Senate candidate.

In 1969, he was the chairman of the Tulsa County Republican Convention and he supported efforts to liberalize abortions laws in Oklahoma in the 32nd Oklahoma Legislature that passed the Oklahoma House of Representatives, but they failed in Senate committee. Republican party officials tried to recruit Inhofe to run for Treasurer of Oklahoma in 1970, but he declined to run. In 1970, Governor Dewey Bartlett created the Oklahoma Narcotics and Drug Abuse Council and appointed Inhofe as an inaugural member. That November, he was elected minority caucus chair of the Oklahoma Senate for the 33rd Oklahoma Legislature. In 1971, Inhofe served as the chairman of the Oklahoma Republican Party&#x27;s State Convention. While Inhofe had initially filed a resolution for Oklahoma to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment in 1972, he retracted his support later that year.

In 1969, Inhofe sponsored a successful bill to bring a retired U.S. Navy submarine to Oklahoma. Inhofe initially wanted the &quot;USS Piranha&quot; for Tulsa, but it was determined that the Arkansas River was too shallow for the ship to travel that far upriver. The Muskogee City-County Trust Port Authority donated five acres of waterfront property to locate the ship in Muskogee. In September 1970, the USS &quot;Batfish&quot; was considered as an alternative and on December 9, 1971, the &quot;Batfish&quot; was given to the State of Oklahoma. The ship was unofficially opened to the public July 4, 1972, with its official opening on Memorial Day 1973.

====1972 campaigning and second term====
In 1972, Inhofe was appointed to serve as co-chair for Richard Nixon&#x27;s 1972 presidential campaign in Oklahoma with Ralph Gordon Thompson. During the campaign, Inhofe solicited Barry Goldwater to write a letter of endorsement for Nixon&#x27;s campaign in Oklahoma to win over conservative Republicans and he represented Oklahoma at the 1972 Republican National Convention. He also worked on U.S. senator Dewey Bartlett&#x27;s campaign as the co-chair for Oklahoma&#x27;s 1st congressional district. In his own district, Inhofe faced no Republican primary challenge and faced Democratic nominee Happy Miles in the general election. He won the general election by over 7,000 votes; afterward, he was elected by fellow Republican state senators to serve as the assistant floor leader in the 34th Oklahoma Legislature. He was elected minority leader of the Oklahoma Senate for the 35th Oklahoma Legislature to succeed Donald Ferrell who had lost re-election. In April 1975, he appointed the first blind page in Oklahoma history: 15 year-old Angela Keele. Later that year, Inhofe and Charles Ford wrote an article criticizing David Boren and spending by the Democratic Party in a party newspaper. Newspapers in the state responded by pointing out Inhofe had supported just as much spending; the article was syndicated by the Associated Press and Inhofe responded by publishing a &quot;Tulsa World&quot; op-ed arguing he had tried to amend bills to remove wasteful spending and was consistently critical of spending. He did not seek a third term to the Oklahoma Legislature and was succeeded as minority leader by Senator Stephen Wolfe.

===== 1974 gubernatorial election =====

Inhofe had been floated as a potential gubernatorial candidate since 1972. Inhofe was considered a strong Republican candidate with his only weaknesses being his feuding with Leo Winters and the backlash to the &quot;USS Batfish&quot; project. By May 1973, he was openly campaigning, but had yet to officially announce his campaign. In October of that year, he was polling behind Denzil Garrison in the Republican primary 35% to 65%. Inhofe officially launched his campaign in May 1974. The main issue in both the Republican and Democratic primary campaigns was corruption during the term of incumbent Democratic governor David Hall. Inhofe defeated Garrison in the August primary. During the campaign, he lost 57 pounds and was down to 148 pounds.

In a 2011 interview, Inhofe claimed that he and David Boren were both upset with Hall, so the pair decided to both campaign against him; Boren would primary him as a Democrat to weaken his campaign and Inhofe would run as the Republican challenger and defeat him. However, the plan was thrown off when Boren won the Democratic nomination. In October, then-President Gerald Ford visited Oklahoma to campaign for Inhofe. A poll later that month by &quot;The Daily Oklahoman&quot; showed Boren leading Inhofe 74%–25%. Inhofe ended up losing to Boren by 64%–36%.

=====1976 congressional election=====
In 1976, State Senator Frank Keating announced his campaign for Oklahoma&#x27;s 1st congressional district and announced that Inhofe would be the master of ceremonies at his campaign launch announcement; however, Inhofe did not appear at Keating&#x27;s announcement and instead announced he was considering his own campaign. Inhofe officially announced his candidacy on February 19, 1976. In the Republican primary, he defeated Keating and Tulsa Public Schools board member Mary Warner, 67%–25%–8%. In a 2011 interview, he credited his primary win to the use of the &quot;Kasten Plan&quot;, a system of precinct organization. He also criticized Democratic presidential candidate, and U.S. senator from Oklahoma, Fred Harris during his presidential primary campaign.

During the primary, Inhofe had called for Democratic incumbent James R. Jones to be expelled from Congress for his conviction while in office for failing to report campaign contributions.
Inhofe also criticized a donation Jones had received from Ross Perot, but he retracted his accusation that the donation affected Jones&#x27;s voting record after threats from Perot and his lawyers. Inhofe was endorsed by the American Conservative Union and National Conservative Political Action Committee during the general election. Former California governor, and future president, Ronald Reagan endorsed and campaigned with Inhofe. He was also endorsed by President Gerald Ford, U.S. representative John Rousselot of California, and the &quot;Tulsa Tribune&quot;. Polling before the election showed Jones leading Inhofe, 44% to 36%. In the general election, Jones won by 54%–45%.

==Mayor of Tulsa==

In January 1978, the Tulsa Daily World reported Republican party officials were courting Inhofe to run for Mayor of Tulsa. He initially denied he would run for any city office and instead insisted he was considering a rematch against Congressman Jones; but, Inhofe announced his mayor campaign in February. He won the Republican primary with over 92% of the vote, defeating Keith Robinson and Paul Cull. During the first three weeks of the primary, he was injured with a broken leg from a tennis injury and could not campaign. In the general election against Rodger Randle, he was endorsed by then-Mayor Robert LaFortune and U.S. senator Dewey Bartlett. Randle had won the Democratic primary with a coalition of labor union and black voters; and Inhofe was supported in the general by his Republican base, anti-union and anti-black Democrats, and 22% of black voters. In April, he was elected mayor of Tulsa, defeating Democrat Rodger Randle, 51%–46%. The Tulsa Daily World heralded the race as Inhofe&#x27;s &quot;first general election victory in six years, and Randle&#x27;s first election loss since he entered politics in 1970.&quot; The race broke then-fundraising records for a Tulsa mayoral election with Randle raising $78,062 and Inhofe raising $48,987. Inhofe&#x27;s biggest donors were the Metropolitan Builder&#x27;s Association, oilman Robert L. Parker, and Paul D. Hinch.

On May 2, he was sworn in as Mayor of Tulsa. Inhofe&#x27;s first proclamation as mayor was to celebrate Sun Day and support alternative energy; in the proclamation he said, &quot;I think we&#x27;re all interested in looking for alternative sources of energy. And of course, we want clean sources.&quot; In his first month in office, he decried the city&#x27;s reliance on federal funding, promised to &quot;seek minorities to fill positions in city government, and nominated Jewish, senior citizen, anti-abortion, and Christian fundamentalist members to the Tulsa Human Rights Commission. In January 1979, Inhofe attended the first swearing in of a governor of Oklahoma to occur in Tulsa when George Nigh was sworn in to serve the last five days of David Boren&#x27;s term after Boren was elected to the U.S. Senate. In February, he appointed Ronald L. Young, the first African-American to ever serve on the City Commission. In December 1979, Inhofe officially announced his re-election campaign for a second term as mayor. He ran unopposed in the Republican primary and later won the general election, fending off Democratic nominee Richard Johnson and Independent candidate Robert Murphy. He broke Rodger Randle&#x27;s record fundraising for a Tulsa mayoral race set in the last election by raising $87,667.

In 1982 he was reelected with 59% of the vote. He lost his 1984 re-election campaign to Terry Young.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
In 1986, when Representative James R. Jones decided to retire to run for the U.S. Senate, Inhofe ran for the 1st District and won the Republican primary with 54%. In the general election, he defeated Democrat Gary Allison 55%–43%. In 1988 he won reelection against Democrat Kurt Glassco 53%–47%. In 1990 he defeated Glassco again, 56%–44%. After redistricting, the 1st District contained only two counties, all of Tulsa and some parts of Wagoner. In 1992, Inhofe was reelected with 53% of the vote.

===Tenure===
In 1987 Inhofe voted against President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s budget, which included tax increases and no increase in defense spending.

He first came to national attention in 1993, when he led the effort to reform the House&#x27;s discharge petition rule, which the House leadership had long used to bottle up bills in committee.

==U.S. Senate==


Inhofe was the longest-serving U.S. senator from Oklahoma, having served between 1994 and 2023.

=== Elections ===
In 1994, incumbent senator David Boren, who had been serving in the Senate since 1979, agreed to become president of the University of Oklahoma and announced he would resign as soon as a successor was elected. A special election was scheduled, in which Inhofe defeated Congressman Dave McCurdy in the general election. 1994 also saw the Republican Party take both houses of the U.S. Congress and the Oklahoma governorship.

Inhofe took office on November 17, giving him more seniority than the incoming class of senators. After serving the last two years of Boren&#x27;s term, he won his first full term in 1996. He was reelected in 2002, 2008, 2014, and 2020.

===Tenure===
====Fundraising====
In the 2008 election cycle, Inhofe&#x27;s largest campaign donors represented the oil and gas ($446,900 in donations), leadership PACs ($316,720), and electric utilities ($221,654) industries/categories. In 2010, his largest donors represented the oil and gas ($429,950) and electric ($206,654) utilities.
The primary PACs donating to his campaigns were Aircraft Owners &amp; Pilots Association ($55,869), United Parcel Service ($51,850), National Association of Realtors ($51,700), NRA Political Victory Fund ($51,050), and American Medical Association ($51,000). Additionally, if company-sponsored PACs were combined with employee contributions, Koch Industries would be Inhofe&#x27;s largest contributor, with $90,950 according to OpenSecrets.

====Armed Services Committee====

As a member of the Armed Services Committee, Inhofe was among the panelists questioning witnesses about the 2004 Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse, saying he was &quot;outraged by the outrage&quot; over the revelations of abuse. Although he believed that the individuals responsible for mistreating prisoners should be punished, he said that the prisoners &quot;are not there for traffic violations ... they&#x27;re murderers, they&#x27;re terrorists, they&#x27;re insurgents&quot;. In 2006, Inhofe was one of only nine senators to vote against the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005, which prohibits &quot;cruel, inhuman or degrading&quot; treatment of individuals in U.S. Government custody.
When chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee John McCain was absent seeking medical treatment for brain cancer, Inhofe became acting chairman of the committee. During this time, Inhofe helped secure the passage of the record $716 billion National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019. McCain died in August 2018, and Inhofe lauded him as his &quot;hero&quot;.
Inhofe also said that McCain was &quot;partially to blame for&quot; the White House&#x27;s controversial decision to raise flags back to full mast after less than two days, as McCain previously &quot;disagreed with the President in certain areas and wasn&#x27;t too courteous about it&quot;.

On March 6, 2019, Inhofe said he intended to put language in the next defense authorization act to reinforce President Donald Trump&#x27;s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement and reintroduce severe sanctions on Tehran.

====Committee assignments and caucus membership====
During the 115th, 116th, and 117th Congresses, Inhofe was a member of the following committees:
* Committee on Armed Services
** Subcommittee on Airland
** Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support
** Subcommittee on Strategic Forces
* Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation
* Committee on Environment and Public Works
* Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship

Caucus memberships

* International Conservation Caucus
* Senate Army Caucus
* Senate Diabetes Caucus
* Senate General Aviation Caucus
* Senate Rural Health Caucus
* Senate Tourism Caucus
* Sportsmen&#x27;s Caucus

===Retirement===

On July 15, 2021, Inhofe told &quot;Tulsa World&quot; he planned to retire at the end of his current term, in 2027. In February 2022, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Inhofe was planning to resign at the end of the 117th Congress. A special election for Inhofe&#x27;s replacement was held in 2022 while he remained in office. He endorsed his former chief of staff, Luke Holland, in the special election. Oklahoma&#x27;s 2nd congressional district Congressman Markwayne Mullin won the Republican primary and the special election. Inhofe resigned on January 3, 2023. It was reported in February 2023 that the primary reason for Inhofe&#x27;s retirement was related to him suffering symptoms of long COVID, which had severely limited his capacity to do day-to-day activities, after an initial infection he had described as &quot;very mild&quot;.

==Political positions==
Inhofe was ranked the most conservative member of Congress on the 2017 GovTrack report card. He received the same ranking for 2018. For 2019, he was ranked as the fifth-most conservative member of the U.S. Senate with a score of 0.91 out of 1, behind Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Mike Braun (R-IN), and Ted Cruz (R-TX).

=== Environmental issues ===
Inhofe was best known for his denial of climate change, which he called a &quot;hoax&quot;, and his defense of the oil industry, a major industry in Oklahoma. In December 1997, Inhofe called the Kyoto Protocol, an international treaty to reduce greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere, a &quot;political, economic, and national security fiasco.&quot;

==== Committee on Environment and Public Works ====
Before the Republicans regained control of the Senate in the November 2002 elections, Inhofe had compared the United States Environmental Protection Agency to a Gestapo bureaucracy, and EPA Administrator Carol Browner to Tokyo Rose. In January 2003, he became Chair of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, and continued challenging mainstream science in favor of what he called &quot;sound science&quot;, in accordance with the Luntz memo.

Beginning in 2003, when he was first elected Chair of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, Inhofe was the foremost Republican promoting climate change denial. He famously claimed in the Senate that global warming is a hoax, invited contrarians to testify in Committee hearings, and spread his views via the Committee website run by Marc Morano as well as through his access to conservative media. In 2012, Inhofe&#x27;s &quot;The Greatest Hoax: How the Global Warming Conspiracy Threatens Your Future&quot; was published by WorldNetDaily Books, presenting his global warming conspiracy theory. He said that, because &quot;God&#x27;s still up there&quot;, the &quot;arrogance of people to think that we, human beings, would be able to change what He is doing in the climate is to me outrageous&quot;, but also that he appreciated that this argument was unpersuasive, and that he &quot;never pointed to Scriptures in a debate, because I know this would discredit me.&quot;

As Environment and Public Works chairman, Inhofe gave a two-hour Senate floor speech on July 28, 2003, in the context of discussions on the McCain-Lieberman Bill. He said he was &quot;going to expose the most powerful, most highly financed lobby in Washington, the far left environmental extremists&quot;, and laid out in detail his opposition to attribution of recent climate change to humans, using the word &quot;hoax&quot; four times, including the statement that he had &quot;offered compelling evidence that catastrophic global warming is a hoax&quot; and his conclusion that &quot;manmade global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people&quot;. He supported what he called &quot;sound science&quot;, citing contrarian scientists such as Patrick Michaels, Fred Singer, Richard Lindzen, and Sallie Baliunas as well as some mainstream scientists. Two of these, Tom Wigley and Stephen Schneider, later issued statements that Inhofe had misrepresented their work.

On July 29, the day after his Senate speech, Inhofe chaired an Environment and Public Works hearing with contrarian views represented by Baliunas and David Legates, and praised their &quot;1,000-year climate study&quot;, then involved in the Soon and Baliunas controversy, as &quot;a powerful new work of science&quot;. Against them, Michael E. Mann defended mainstream science and specifically his work on reconstructions (the hockey stick graph) that they and the Bush administration disputed. During the hearing Senator Jim Jeffords read out an email from Hans von Storch saying he had resigned as editor-in-chief of the journal that published the Soon and Baliunas paper, as the peer review had &quot;failed to detect significant methodological flaws in the paper&quot; and the critique by Mann and colleagues was valid.

In a continuation of these themes, Inhofe had a 20-page brochure published under the Seal of the United States Senate reiterating his &quot;hoax&quot; statement and comparing the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to a &quot;Soviet style trial&quot;. In a section headed &quot;The IPCC Plays Hockey&quot; he attacked what he called &quot;Mann&#x27;s flawed, limited research.&quot; The brochure restated themes from Inhofe&#x27;s Senate speech, and in December 2003 he distributed copies of it in Milan at a meeting about the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, where he met &quot;green activists&quot; with posters quoting him as saying that global warming &quot;is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people&quot;. He signed a poster for them, and thanked them for quoting him correctly. In an October 2004 Senate speech he said, &quot;Global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people. It was true when I said it before, and it remains true today. Perhaps what has made this hoax so effective is that we hear over and over that the science is settled and there is a consensus that, unless we fundamentally change our way of life by limiting greenhouse gas emissions, we will cause catastrophic global warming. This is simply a false statement.&quot; In January 2005 Inhofe told Bloomberg News that global warming was &quot;the second-largest hoax ever played on the American people, after the separation of church and state&quot;, and that carbon dioxide would not be restricted by the Clear Skies Act of 2003. In a Senate Floor &quot;update&quot;, he extended his argument against Mann&#x27;s work by extensively citing Michael Crichton&#x27;s fictional thriller &quot;State of Fear&quot;, mistakenly describing Crichton as a &quot;scientist&quot;. On August 28, 2005, at Inhofe&#x27;s invitation, Crichton appeared as an expert witness at a hearing on climate change, disputing Mann&#x27;s work.

In his 2006 book &quot;The Republican War on Science&quot;, Chris Mooney wrote that Inhofe &quot;politicizes and misuses the science of climate change&quot;.

During the 2006 North American heat wave, Inhofe said that the environmentalist movement reminded him of &quot;the Third Reich, the Big Lie&quot;: &quot;You say something over and over and over and over again, and people will believe it, and that&#x27;s their strategy.&quot;
In a September 2006 Senate speech Inhofe argued that the threat of global warming was exaggerated by &quot;the media, Hollywood elites and our pop culture&quot;. He said that in the 1960s the media had switched from warning of global warming to warning of global cooling and a coming ice age, then in the 1970s had returned to warming to promote &quot;climate change fears&quot;. In February 2007 he told &quot;Fox News&quot; that mainstream science increasingly attributed climate change to natural causes, and only &quot;those individuals on the far left, such as Hollywood liberals and the United Nations&quot;, disagreed.

In 2006, Inhofe introduced Senate Amendment 4682 with Kit Bond (R-MO), which would have modified oversight responsibility of the Army Corps of Engineers. The League of Conservation Voters, an environmentalist group, said analyses for corps projects &quot;have been manipulated to favor large-scale projects that harm the environment.&quot; During the 109th Congress, Inhofe voted to increase offshore oil drilling, to include provisions for drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in the House Budget Amendment, and to deny funding for both low-income energy assistance and environmental stewardship, citing heavy costs and unproven programs.

In May 2009, Inhofe gave support to the idea that black carbon is a significant contributor to global warming.

Inhofe received money from the fossil fuel industry. For example: &quot;Exxon&#x27;s beneficiaries in Congress include the Oklahoma senator Jim Inhofe, who called global warming a hoax, and who has received $20,500 since 2007, according to the Dirty Energy Money database maintained by Oil Change International.&quot;

==== Climatic Research Unit email controversy ====
On November 23, 2009, as the Climatic Research Unit email controversy emerged, Inhofe said the emails confirmed his view that scientists were &quot;cooking the science&quot;. On December 7 on the CNN program &quot;The Situation Room&quot;, Inhofe said that the emails showed that the science behind climate change &quot;has been pretty well debunked&quot;; the fact checking organization PolitiFact concluded that Inhofe&#x27;s statement was false. On the same day, Inhofe said he would lead a three-man &quot;truth squad&quot; consisting of himself and fellow senators Roger Wicker and John Barrasso to the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen. Inhofe was unable to secure meetings with any negotiators or delegations to the conference and only met with a small group of reporters. The minority group of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works prepared a report on &quot;the CRU Controversy&quot;, published in February 2010, which listed as &quot;Key Players&quot; 17 scientists including Mann and Phil Jones. Inhofe said it showed that the controversy was &quot;about unethical and potentially illegal behavior by some of the world&#x27;s leading climate scientists.&quot; On May 26 Inhofe formally requested that the Inspector General of the United States Department of Commerce investigate how the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) had dealt with the emails, and whether the emails showed any wrongdoing; it found no major issues or inappropriate actions.

==== Global warming temperatures ====
In July 2010 Inhofe said, &quot;I don&#x27;t think that anyone disagrees with the fact that we actually are in a cold period that started about nine years ago. Now, that&#x27;s not me talking, those are the scientists that say that.&quot; The Union of Concerned Scientists said that Inhofe was wrong, pointing to a NOAA report indicating that the summer of 2010 had so far been the hottest on record since 1880. Inhofe added, &quot;People on the other side of this argument back in January, they said, &#x27;Inhofe, it has nothing to do with today&#x27;s or this month or next month. We&#x27;re looking at a long period of time. We go into twenty year periods.

During a House committee hearing in 2011, Inhofe testified, &quot;I have to admit—and, you know, confession is good for the soul ... I, too, once thought that catastrophic global warming was caused by anthropogenic gases—because everyone said it was.&quot; Under questioning from committee member Jay Inslee, Inhofe dismissed the notion that he was less knowledgeable than climate scientists, saying that he&#x27;d already given &quot;five speeches on the science.&quot;

==== 2015: Chair of Environment and Public Works committee ====

On January 21, 2015, Inhofe returned to chairing the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works as part of a new Republican majority in the Senate. In response to NOAA and NASA reports that 2014 had been the warmest year globally in the temperature record, he said, &quot;we had the coldest in the western hemisphere in the same time frame&quot;, and attributed changes to a 30-year cycle, not human activities. In a debate on the same day about a bill for the Keystone XL pipeline, Inhofe endorsed an amendment proposed by Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, &quot;Climate change is real and not a hoax&quot;, which passed 98–1. Inhofe clarified his view that &quot;Climate is changing and climate has always changed and always will. There is archaeological evidence of that, there is biblical evidence of that, there is historical evidence of that&quot;, but added, &quot;there are some people who are so arrogant to think they are so powerful they can change climate.&quot;

On February 26, 2015, Inhofe brought a snowball to the Senate floor and tossed it before delivering remarks in which he said that environmentalists keep talking about global warming even though it keeps getting cold.

==== Hydraulic fracturing ====
On March 19, 2015, Inhofe introduced S.828, &quot;The Fracturing Regulations are Effective in State Hands (FRESH) Act.&quot; The bill would transfer regulatory power over hydraulic fracturing from the federal government to state governments. In his announcement of the bill, Inhofe said that hydraulic fracturing had never contaminated ground water in Oklahoma. The U.S. senators from seven states (Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, South Dakota and Texas) cosponsored the bill.

==== Paris Agreement ====
Inhofe co-authored and was one of 22 senators to sign a letter to President Donald Trump urging him to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement. According to OpenSecrets, Inhofe had received over $529,000 from the oil and gas industry since 2012.

=== Foreign policy ===

==== Israel Anti-Boycott Act ====
In October 2017, Inhofe co-sponsored the Israel Anti-Boycott Act (S. 720), which would have made it a federal crime for Americans to encourage or participate in boycotts against Israel and Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories if protesting actions by the Israeli government.

==== Western Sahara ====
Inhofe supported the Polisario Front and traveled to Algeria many times to meet with its leaders. He urged Morocco to hold a referendum on independence for Western Sahara. In 2017, Inhofe blocked the Trump administration&#x27;s nomination of J. Peter Pham for Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, citing a disagreement over Western Sahara.

After the December 2020 Israel–Morocco normalization agreement, Inhofe sharply criticized the Trump administration for recognizing Morocco&#x27;s claim over Western Sahara, calling the decision &quot;shocking and deeply disappointing&quot; and adding that he was &quot;saddened that the rights of the Western Sahara people have been traded away&quot;.

==== War in Afghanistan ====
Inhofe opposed the 2021 withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan under President Biden, saying that Biden should maintain &quot;a relatively small troop presence until the conditions outlined in the 2020 U.S.-Taliban Agreement are fully implemented.&quot;

===Immigration===
Inhofe wrote the Inhofe Amendment to the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006, which was debated in Congress in May 2006. The amendment would make English the national language of the United States and require that new citizens take an English proficiency test. The amendment was passed on May 18, 2006, with 32 Democrats, one independent, and one Republican dissenting. The measure had 11 cosponsors, including one Democrat.

=== Social issues ===

====Gun policy====
In the aftermath of the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, Inhofe blamed the &quot;culture of sanctuary cities&quot; for the shootings.

====LGBT rights====

Inhofe was generally seen as overtly hostile by LGBT advocacy groups, earning a 0% in every one of his terms on the Human Rights Campaign&#x27;s position scorecard. Inhofe was in favor of a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, against adding sexual orientation to the definition of hate crimes, and voted against prohibiting job discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. In 2008, Inhofe said his office &quot;does not hire openly gay staffers due to the possibility of a conflict of agenda.&quot;

Inhofe campaigned for his Senate seat in 1994 using the phrase &quot;God, guns, and gays.&quot; In 2008, his campaign was noted by the Associated Press for running an ad with &quot;anti-gay overtones&quot; featuring a wedding cake with two male figures on top, fading into his opponent&#x27;s face.

In 1999, along with Republican colleagues Tim Hutchinson and Bob Smith, and Republican Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, Inhofe stalled the nomination of James Hormel, a gay man, as US Ambassador to Luxembourg for over 20 months specifically because of Hormel&#x27;s sexual orientation. President Bill Clinton eventually appointed him in a recess appointment, making him the United States&#x27; first openly gay ambassador in June 1999, and angering Inhofe, who held up seven more Clinton appointees in retaliation.

In 2015, Inhofe condemned the Supreme Court ruling in &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot;, which held that same-sex marriage bans violated the Constitution.

====Racial and gender civil rights====
In 1995, Inhofe voted to ban affirmative action hiring with federal funds. In 1997, he voted to end special funding for minority- and women-owned businesses. The bill he voted for would have abolished a program that helps businesses owned by women and minorities to compete for federally funded transportation; it did not pass. The next year, Inhofe voted to repeal the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program, which is designed to &quot;remedy ongoing discrimination and the continuing effects of past discrimination in federally-assisted highway, transit, airport, and highway safety financial assistance transportation contracting markets nationwide&quot; by allocating 10% of highway funds to benefit the business enterprises of racial minorities and women.

Overall, in 2002, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) rated Inhofe at 20%, indicating that he held an anti-racial civil rights record. Four years later, on December 31, 2006, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) rated Inhofe at 7%, indicating that he held an anti-civil rights and anti-affirmative action record.

====Privacy====
In 2001, Inhofe voted to loosen restrictions on cell phone wiretapping. The bill, which passed, removed the requirement that a person or party implementing an order to wiretap a private citizen&#x27;s cellphone must ascertain that the target of the surveillance is present in the house or using the phone that has been tapped.

====Free speech and expression====
In 1995, Inhofe co-sponsored a constitutional amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would give Congress and individual U.S. states the power to prohibit the physical desecration of the American flag. The bill&#x27;s primary sponsor was Orrin Hatch (R-UT).

====GI Bill reform====
Inhofe, an initial sponsor of Senator Jim Webb&#x27;s Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008, subsequently withdrew support for this bill to support S. 2938, a competing bill that would have provided benefits beyond those offered in Webb&#x27;s bill. But he voted to enact Webb&#x27;s legislation in June 2008.

Inhofe agreed to support legislation allowing military mental health specialists to talk with veterans about private firearms in an effort to reduce suicides.

=== Economic issues ===

====Aviation====
Trained by the U.S. Navy, Inhofe was one of the few members of Congress holding a Commercial Airman certificate. In 1994, when he first ran for the U.S. Senate, he used his plane as a daily campaign vehicle to travel throughout Oklahoma and visit almost every town in the state. He was influential in Senate and Congressional debates involving aircraft regulation. In 2012, he authored the Pilot&#x27;s Bill of Rights bill.

====Taxpayer-funded travel====
Inhofe said that he made over 140 trips to Africa over about 20 years and helped to get United States Africa Command established. He made multiple foreign trips, especially to Africa, on missions that he described as &quot;a Jesus thing&quot; and that were paid for by the U.S. government. He used these trips for activities on behalf of The Fellowship, a Christian organization. Inhofe said that his trips included some governmental work but also involved &quot;the political philosophy of Jesus, something that had been put together by Doug Coe, the leader of The Fellowship ... It&#x27;s all scripturally based.&quot; Inhofe used his access as a senator to pursue religious goals.

====Federal disaster relief====
Inhofe consistently voted against federal disaster relief, most notably in the case of relief for the 24 states affected by Hurricane Sandy, but argued for and voted for federal aid when natural disasters hit Oklahoma. In defense of his decision to vote against a relief fund for Sandy but not in Oklahoma after tornadoes ravaged it in May 2013, he claimed the situations were &quot;totally different&quot;, in that the Sandy funding involved &quot;Everybody getting in and exploiting the tragedy that took place. That won&#x27;t happen in Oklahoma.&quot; Inhofe pointedly did not thank President Obama for his attention to the tragedy in his state, so as to not be compared to Chris Christie.

==== Sought federal environmental cleanup funds ====
Inhofe was instrumental in securing millions of dollars of federal funds to clean up contamination at a former mining hub in northeast Oklahoma after the affected site had spent decades on the Environmental Protection Agency Superfund list. He supported participation in the massive federal government buyout program for the Tar Creek Superfund site that purchased homes and businesses within a 40-square-mile (104-square-kilometer) region where for decades, children consistently tested positive for dangerous levels of lead in their blood.

==== Earmarks ====
In April 2021, Inhofe expressed support for bringing back earmarks to the United States Senate. The &quot;Tulsa World&quot; credited Inhofe for how he &quot;relentlessly pursued&quot; federal investment for highways, aviation, and military bases in the state.

===Tribal sovereignty===
In 2005, Inhofe included a midnight rider in that year&#x27;s transportation bill that prevented federally recognized tribes in Oklahoma from administering Environmental Protection Agency regulations, a practice allowed by federal law in other states.

===Presidential Impeachments===
On February 12, 1999, Inhofe was one of 50 senators to vote to convict and remove Bill Clinton from office. On February 5, 2020, he voted to acquit Donald Trump, and on February 13, 2021, he voted to acquit Trump for the second time.

===2016 presidential election===
Early during the Republican Party presidential primaries in 2016, Inhofe endorsed fellow Republican John Kasich. During Donald Trump&#x27;s presidency, he voted in line with Trump&#x27;s position 94.2% of the time.

=== Purchase of Raytheon stock ===
In December 2018, Inhofe bought $50,000 to $100,000 worth of stock in Raytheon, a major defense contractor that has billions of dollars&#x27; worth of contracts with the Pentagon. The week before, he had successfully lobbied the Trump administration to increase military spending. Ethics watchdogs said the purchase raised conflict of interest concerns, and noted that members of Congress are not allowed to purchase stocks on the basis of information that is not publicly available. Inhofe sold the stock shortly after reporters asked him about the purchase. He said the purchase was made by a third-party adviser who manages Inhofe&#x27;s investments on his behalf.

=== Judiciary ===

In March 2016, around seven months before the next presidential election, Inhofe argued that the Senate should not consider Obama&#x27;s Supreme Court nominee because &quot;we must let the people decide the Supreme Court&#x27;s future&quot; via the presidential election. In September 2020, less than two months before the next presidential election, Inhofe supported an immediate vote on Trump&#x27;s nominee to fill the Supreme Court vacancy caused by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg&#x27;s death.

Inhofe also voted to confirm Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh (Trump&#x27;s other two Supreme Court nominations) while voting against Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan (Obama&#x27;s two Supreme Court nominations). All four were successful.

===2020 presidential election ===
Inhofe refused to support delaying the certification of the 2020 United States presidential election and said doing so would have violated his oath of office.

===2021 storming of the United States Capitol===
On May 28, 2021, Inhofe abstained from voting on the creation of an independent commission to investigate the January 6 United States Capitol attack.

==Personal life==
On December 19, 1959, Inhofe married Kay Kirkpatrick, with whom he had four children. His mother, Blanche M. Inhofe, died in 1975. On November 10, 2013, one of Inhofe&#x27;s sons, Perry Inhofe, died in a plane crash in Owasso, Oklahoma, flying alone for the first time since training in a newly acquired Mitsubishi MU-2. Molly Rapert, an academic, is Inhofe&#x27;s daughter.

Inhofe had his pilot&#x27;s license since he was 28; he flew a Van&#x27;s Aircraft RV-8. He attended the EAA AirVenture Oshkosh for 20 years; in 2021, he said, &quot;I&#x27;ve slept in the same tent for 20 years. If you&#x27;re not sleeping in a tent, it&#x27;s not like being at Oshkosh.&quot; Inhofe had to emergency-land his plane multiple times throughout his career.

He was the first recipient of the U.S. Air Force Academy&#x27;s Character and Leadership Award for his character and leadership in public service.

Towards the end of his life Inhofe had symptoms of long COVID, which severely limited his capacity to do day-to-day activities.

Inhofe died from complications of a stroke at a hospital in Tulsa, on July 9, 2024, at the age of 89.

<text>Donald Lee Nickles (born December 6, 1948) is an American politician and lobbyist who was a Republican United States Senator from Oklahoma from 1981 to 2005. He was considered both a fiscal and social conservative. After retiring from the Senate as the longest-serving senator from Oklahoma up until that point, he founded the Nickles Group, a lobbying firm.

==Early life==
Nickles was born and raised in Ponca City, Oklahoma, the son of Coeweene (Bryan) and Robert C. Nickles. He attended Ponca City public schools graduating from Ponca City High School in 1967. To help pay for their education at Oklahoma State University, he and his wife, the former Linda Lou Morrison, operated Don Nickles Professional Cleaning Service in Stillwater. He was a member of Beta Theta Pi fraternity at Oklahoma State University, and earned a Bachelor of Arts in business administration in 1971.

After college, he went to work for Nickles Machine Corporation in Ponca City, a business started in 1918 by his grandfather, Clair Nickles. He became the company&#x27;s vice president and general manager. He also served in the Kansas Army National Guard and the Oklahoma Army National Guard from 1970 until 1976. A formative experience was the distress his family suffered following the death of his father, Robert, in 1961, when Nickles was twelve years old. The family had to sell off part of the family business to raise cash to pay the required estate tax.
In 1978, aged 29, his election to the Oklahoma State Senate was the beginning of his career in public office. Two years later, at the age of 31, he became and remains the youngest Republican ever elected to the U.S. Senate.

==U.S. Senate==

===Tenure===

He sponsored legislation to cut taxes, reduce government spending, promote national defense, and reduce what he believed to be official hostility to religion. He sponsored the Defense of Marriage Act which allowed states to refuse to recognize same-sex marriages conducted in other states.

As Republican Whip, Nickles called for the resignation of fellow Republican Trent Lott as majority leader after Lott made remarks praising Strom Thurmond that seemed insensitive to the issue of racial segregation. The National Federation of Independent Business praised Nickles for including in the Senate&#x27;s 2005 budget a provision that would accelerate by one year a complete repeal of the federal estate tax

Nickles was one of many Republican senators who in 1981 called the White House to express his discontent over the nomination of Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor of Arizona to the United States Supreme Court. Nickles said that he and other socially conservative Republican senators would not support O&#x27;Connor because of her &quot;presumed unwillingness&quot; to overturn the abortion decision &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;.

During a 1986 campaign rally at the University of Oklahoma in Norman, President Reagan accidentally called him Don Rickles, the American comedian. The president was later told about his mistake and found it very amusing.

Nickles was one of three Senators to vote against the confirmation of Ruth Bader Ginsburg and one of nine to vote against the confirmation of Stephen Breyer to the Supreme Court.

===Leadership===
Nickles quickly rose in the Senate Republican leadership, serving as chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee in the 101st Congress; Chairman of the Republican Policy Committee in the 102nd, 103rd, and 104th Congresses; and Assistant Republican Leader from 1996 to 2003. After being term-limited out of the Assistant Leader position, Nickles served in the 108th Congress as chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. Nickles was also on Bob Dole&#x27;s short list of vice presidential choices, before Dole finally decided on former Congressman Jack Kemp of New York.

In December 2002, Nickles became embroiled in the controversy surrounding Republican Leader Trent Lott. At Senator Strom Thurmond&#x27;s 100th birthday party, Lott had made comments that some took to be racially insensitive. As the controversy grew, Nickles went on national television and became the first senator in the Republican leadership to say that Lott should step down. Nickles believed that the controversy over Lott&#x27;s remarks would distract from the Republican legislative agenda, and as he served as Lott&#x27;s deputy in the Senate this statement was seen as the proverbial &quot;straw that broke the camel&#x27;s back.&quot; Despite many apologies for his remarks, Lott stepped down shortly thereafter. Declining to run for the position of Senate Majority Leader himself, Lott was succeeded by Bill Frist of Tennessee.

Nickles was re-elected in 1986, 1992 and 1998 and was the senior senator from Oklahoma from 1994 to 2005.

==Post-Senate career==
On October 7, 2003, he announced that he would not run in the 2004 election. Republican Tom Coburn was elected to succeed Nickles.

Nickles went on to found the Nickles Group, a government consulting group in Washington, D.C. He also serves on the boards of directors of a number of public companies, such as Oklahoma City-based Chesapeake Energy.

Nickles was one of the politicians featured in the film &quot;Traffic&quot;, giving his opinion on the war on drugs.

==Family==
Nickles and his wife, Linda, have four children.

<text>James Legge (; 20 December 181529 November 1897) was a Scottish linguist, missionary, sinologist, and translator
who was best known as an early translator of Classical Chinese texts into English. Legge served as a representative of the London Missionary Society in Malacca and Hong Kong (1840–1873) and was the first Professor of Chinese at Oxford University (1876–1897). In association with Max Müller he prepared the monumental &quot;Sacred Books of the East&quot; series, published in 50 volumes between 1879 and 1891.

==Early life==
James Legge was born at Huntly, Aberdeenshire. He enrolled in Aberdeen Grammar School at age 13 and then King&#x27;s College, Aberdeen at age 15. He then continued his studies at Highbury Theological College, London.

==Mission to China and family==
Legge went, in 1839, as a missionary to China, but first stayed at Malacca three years, in charge of the Anglo-Chinese College there. The College was subsequently moved to Hong Kong, where Legge lived for nearly thirty years. On 2 December 1843, Legge married Mary Isabella Morison (1816–1852), daughter of the Rev. John Morison, D.D. of Chelsea. The next year, she gave birth in Hong Kong to a son who lived for only a few hours. By her he also fathered Sir Thomas Morison Legge, the first Medical Inspector of Factories and Workshops in the UK. A Chinese Christian, Wat Ngong, accompanied Legge when he moved in 1844. He returned home to Huntly, Aberdeenshire, in 1846–7, taking with him three Chinese students. Legge and the students were received by Queen Victoria before his return to Hong Kong.
After Isabella died, he married secondly a widow, Hannah Mary Willetts née Johnstone (d. 1881).

===Translating the classics===
Convinced of the need for missionaries to be able to comprehend the ideas and culture of the Chinese, he began in 1841 a translation in many volumes of the Chinese classics, a monumental task that he completed a few years before his death. During his residence in Hong Kong, he translated Chinese classic literature into English with the help of Wang Tao and Hong Rengan, among others. He was appointed headmaster of Ying Wa College in Malacca in 1839 and continued in that position until 1867, the college having removed to Hong Kong in 1844. He was pastor of the Union Church in Hong Kong from 1844 to 1867.

He was third and final editor of the &quot;Chinese Serial&quot;, the first Chinese newspaper in Hong Kong. The paper closed in May 1856.

In 1867, Legge returned to Dollar in Clackmannanshire, Scotland, where he invited Wang Tao to join him, and received his LLD from the University of Aberdeen in 1870. While in Scotland, he also revisited his native burgh, Huntly, accompanied by Wang Tao. He then returned to Hong Kong as pastor at Union Church from 1870 to 1873. While in Hong Kong he published &quot;The She King (Classic of Poetry)&quot; in 1871 which according to Peter France is the first substantial volume of Chinese poetry in English translation still in use. The work underwent a new edition in 1876 in verse.

He took a long trip to North China, beginning 2 April 1873 in Shanghai, arriving at Tianjin by boat, then travelling by mule cart and arriving in Peking on 16 April 1873, where he stayed at the London Missionary Society headquarters. He visited the Great Wall, Ming Tombs and the Temple of Heaven, where he felt compelled to take off his shoes with holy awe. He left Peking, accompanied by Joseph Edkins, and headed for Shandong by mule cart to visit Jinan, Taishan, where they ascended the sacred Mount Tai, carried by four men on chairs. Leaving Mount Tai on 15 May, they visited Confucius Temple and the Forest of Confucius at Qufu, where he climbed to the top of Confucius&#x27; burial mound. Legge returned to Shanghai by way of the Grand Canal, and thence to England via Japan and the USA in 1873.

In addition to his other works Legge wrote &quot;The Life and Teaching of Confucius&quot; (1867); &quot;The Life and Teaching of Mencius&quot; (1875); &quot;The Religions of China&quot; (1880); and other books on Chinese literature and religion. His respect for Confucianism was controversial among his fellow missionaries.

===Oxford professor===
In 1875, he was named Fellow of Corpus Christi College, Oxford and in 1876 assumed the new Chair of Chinese Language and Literature at Oxford. As a Scottish nonconformist in the deeply Anglican university and city of Oxford, Legge was often treated as an outsider until his death.

At Oxford he attracted few students to his lectures but worked hard for some 20 years on his translations of the Chinese classics in his study at 3 Keble Terrace, later renumbered 3 Keble Road, which now has an Oxfordshire Blue Plaque in his memory. According to an anonymous contemporary obituary in the Pall Mall Gazette, Legge was in his study every morning at three o&#x27;clock, winter and summer, having retired to bed at ten. When he got up in the morning the first thing he did was to make himself a cup of tea over a spirit-lamp. Then he worked away at his translations while all the household slept.

In 1879, Legge was a member of a committee formed to create a women&#x27;s college at Oxford &quot;in which no distinction will be made between students on the ground of their belonging to different religious denominations&quot;. This resulted in the founding of Somerville Hall, later renamed Somerville College, one of the first two Oxford colleges for women.

While at Oxford, Legge was an ardent opponent of Britain&#x27;s opium policy, and was a founding member of the Society for the Suppression of the Opium Trade in 1874.

Legge was given an honorary MA, University of Oxford, and LLD, University of Edinburgh, 1884. He was elected an International Member of the American Philosophical Society in 1895.

==Death and legacy==
Legge died at Oxford in 1897 and is buried in Wolvercote Cemetery. The remains of his second wife Hannah, who died before him in 1881, were exhumed from Saint Sepulchre&#x27;s cemetery and placed beside the body of her husband in Wolvercote.

Most of his most important manuscripts and letters are archived at the School of Oriental and African Studies and, secondly, in the Bodleian Library.

== Name for God in Bible translation ==
Initially, Legge followed the pattern set by Robert Morrison and preferred to translate the Christian God into Chinese using the word &quot;Shen&quot; (). However, he was increasingly convinced by his Chinese collaborators Hong Rengan and He Jinshan that &quot;Shangdi&quot; () from the Book of Documents and the Classic of Poetry was a more appropriate term. He also drew from his education in Scottish common sense realism various hermeneutical principles in translation. Ultimately, by the 1850s, Legge concluded that the word &quot;Shangdi&quot; represented a monotheistic god, and argued it was the most appropriate term for translating words in reference to the Christian God into Chinese. He believed that using a term already deeply entrenched in Chinese culture could prevent Christianity from being seen as a completely foreign religion. His opponents argued that this would cause confusion due to the word&#x27;s use in Taoism and Chinese folk religion.

==Selected works==
Legge&#x27;s most enduring work has been &quot;The Chinese Classics: with a Translation, Critical and Exegetical Notes, Prolegomena, and Copious Indexes&quot;, 5 vols., (Hong Kong: Legge; London: Trubner, 1861–1872):
* Volume 1: &quot;Confucian Analects, the Great Learning, and the Doctrine of the Mean&quot; (1861). Revised second edition (1893), Oxford: Clarendon Press, reprinted by Cosimo in 2006 (). The Confucian Analects
* Volume 2: &quot;The works of Mencius&quot; (1861), Revised second edition (1895), Oxford: Clarendon Press, reprinted by Dover Books in 1990 ().
* Volume 3: &quot;The Shoo King (Book of Historical Documents)&quot; (1865):
** Part 1: Prolegomena (with &quot;Bamboo Annals&quot;) and Chapters 1–36
** Part 2: Chapters 37–58 and indexes

** Part 1: Books 1–8
** Part 2: Books 9–12
These contain parallel Chinese and English text, with detailed notes, introductions and indexes. Chinese names are transcribed in Legge&#x27;s own romanisation.

Legge originally planned his &quot;Chinese Classics&quot; as seven volumes, but his translations of the &quot;I Ching&quot; and &quot;Book of Rites&quot; (and several others) were instead included in the &quot;Sacred Books of the East&quot; series edited by Max Müller (Oxford: Clarendon Press):
* Volume 3: &quot;The Shû king (Book of Documents). The religious portions of the Shih king (Classic of Poetry). The Hsiâo king (Classic of Filial Piety).&quot; (1879)
* Volume 16: &quot;The Yî king (I Ching)&quot; (1882)

<doc id="380808" wikidata="Q1759237" url="?curid=380808" title="Tokusō">
<text>was the title (post) held by the head of the mainline Hōjō clan, who also monopolized the position of &quot;shikken&quot; (regents to the shogunate) of the Kamakura shogunate in Japan during the period of Regent Rule (1199–1333). It’s important not to confuse a regent of the shogunate with a regent of the Emperor (the latter are called &quot;Sesshō&quot; and &quot;Kampaku&quot;). &quot;Shikkens&quot; were the first regents to the shogunate.

The &quot;tokusō&quot; from 1256 to 1333 was the military dictator of Japan as &quot;de facto&quot; head of the &quot;bakufu&quot; (shogunate); despite the actual shōgun being merely a puppet. This implies that all other positions in Japan—the Emperor, the Imperial Court, &quot;Sesshō&quot; and &quot;Kampaku&quot;, and the &quot;shikken&quot; (regent of the shōgun)—had also been reduced to figureheads.

==Origin==

The name &quot;tokusō&quot; is said to have come from , the Buddhist name of Hōjō Yoshitoki, but his father Hōjō Tokimasa is usually regarded as the first &quot;tokusō&quot;. There were eight &quot;tokusō&quot; overall:

#Hōjō Tokimasa
#Hōjō Yoshitoki
#Hōjō Yasutoki
#Hōjō Tsunetoki
#Hōjō Tokiyori
#Hōjō Tokimune
#Hōjō Sadatoki
#Hōjō Takatoki

The political structure of the &quot;tokusō&quot; dictatorship was set up by Yasutoki and was consolidated by his grandson Tokiyori. The &quot;tokusō&quot; line held overwhelming power over the &quot;gokenin&quot; and the cadet lines of the Hōjō clan. Tokiyori often worked out policies at at his residence instead of discussing them at the , the council of the shogunate. This made the &quot;tokusō&quot;″s stronger. In 1256, Tokiyori separated the positions of &quot;shikken&quot; and &quot;tokusō&quot; for the first time. Because of an illness, he installed his infant son Tokimune as the &quot;tokusō&quot; while Nagatoki, a collateral relative, was appointed &quot;shikken&quot; to assist Tokimune.

<doc id="380810" wikidata="Q588912" url="?curid=380810" title="Xu Sheng">
<text>Xu Sheng (died 224–229), courtesy name Wenxiang, was a military general serving under the warlord Sun Quan in the late Eastern Han dynasty and early Three Kingdoms period of China.

==Early life and career==
Xu Sheng was from Ju County (), Langya Commandery (), which is present-day Ju County, Shandong. When chaos broke out in central and northern China towards the end of the Eastern Han dynasty, Xu Sheng moved from his hometown to Wu Commandery (around present-day Suzhou, Jiangsu) in southern China, where he gained a reputation for his bravery. He was later recruited by the warlord Sun Quan, who controlled much of the territories in Jiangdong at the time. Sun Quan appointed Xu Sheng as a Major of Separate Command (), placed him in command of 500 troops, and appointed him as the Chief of Chaisang (柴桑; around present-day Jiujiang, Jiangxi) to defend the county from attacks by Huang Zu, the Administrator of Jiangxia Commandery (江夏郡; around present-day Xinzhou District, Wuhan, Hubei).

Huang Zu once sent his son, Huang She (), to lead a few thousand troops to attack Chaisang. At the time, Xu Sheng had less than 200 men with him, so they released arrows at Huang She&#x27;s advancing forces and wounded over 1,000 enemy soldiers. Xu Sheng then ordered the city gates to be opened and they charged out and defeated the enemy. Huang She no longer posed a threat to Xu Sheng after that battle. Xu Sheng was promoted to Colonel () and appointed as the Prefect of Wuhu County. Later, he defeated some bandits in Nan&#x27;e () and Lincheng () counties. He was subsequently promoted to General of the Household () and tasked with overseeing a regiment.

==Wars with Cao Cao and Liu Bei==
In 213, when Sun Quan&#x27;s rival Cao Cao led an army to attack Ruxu (濡須; north of present-day Wuwei County, Anhui), Xu Sheng followed Sun Quan to resist the enemy at the Battle of Ruxu. Cao Cao launched a heavy assault on Hengjiang (橫江; southeast of present-day He County, Anhui, on the northern shore of the Yangtze), so Xu Sheng and Sun Quan&#x27;s other generals led their forces to defend that position. Strong winds blew their &quot;mengchong&quot;s (a type of warship) across the river towards Cao Cao&#x27;s side. Sun Quan&#x27;s generals were all terrified and did not dare to land on the enemy&#x27;s grounds. However, Xu Sheng led his men to charge at the enemy and succeeded in killing a few and forcing the rest to retreat. When the winds stopped, Sun Quan&#x27;s forces returned to their side. Sun Quan highly praised Xu Sheng for his courage.

Between 214 and 215, Sun Quan led his armies to attack Hefei, a strategic fortress defended by Cao Cao&#x27;s general Zhang Liao, leading to the Battle of Xiaoyao Ford. During an early skirmish, when Sun Quan&#x27;s forces were just setting up their camps outside Hefei, Zhang Liao suddenly led hundreds of troops on a fierce assault, completely catching the enemy off guard. Xu Sheng&#x27;s unit was routed and his men turned around and fled. Pan Zhang, another officer under Sun Quan, executed two deserters – one from Xu Sheng&#x27;s unit and the other from Song Qian&#x27;s. Xu Sheng had no choice but to gather his remaining men and return to battle. He lost his &quot;mao&quot; (矛; a type of long spear) in the earlier clash but He Qi found his weapon later on the battlefield. A plague eventually forced Sun Quan to withdraw his forces from Hefei. As they were retreating, Zhang Liao and his troops launched a sudden counterattack and inflicted a crushing defeat on the enemy at Xiaoyao Ford.

Xu Sheng was promoted to General Who Builds Martial Might (), enfeoffed as a Marquis of a Chief Village (), appointed as the Administrator of Lujiang Commandery (), and given Lincheng County () as his marquisate. Between 221 and 222, when the Battle of Xiaoting broke out between Sun Quan and Liu Bei, Xu Sheng participated in the war and succeeded in capturing many enemy camps when Sun Quan&#x27;s forces launched a counterattack after enduring defeats in earlier engagements.

==War with Wei, and death==
In late 222, Cao Pi ordered his general Cao Xiu to lead the Wei armies to attack Dongkou County. In response to the invasion, Xu Sheng, along with Lü Fan and Quan Cong led Sun Quan&#x27;s forces across the river to defend Dongkou. However, they encountered a storm and many of their troops and ships were lost. Sun Quan&#x27;s generals were browbeaten because they had lost about half of their ships in the storm, but were overjoyed when they heard of the arrival of He Qi, who reached Dongkou behind schedule and was not affected by the disaster. Coincidentally, He Qi was obsessed with luxuries so his ships were finely decorated and his weapons were of top quality. Cao Xiu was shocked when he witnessed the grandeur display of He Qi&#x27;s refulgent navy so he paused the attack and withdrew. Xu Sheng managed to gather his surviving troops and form a defence line along the shore. A naval battle ensued, during which Cao Xiu targeted Lü Fan while sending his subordinates to attack Xu Sheng. Xu Sheng was outnumbered but he managed to hold his position. Both sides eventually withdrew their forces. Xu Sheng was subsequently promoted to General Who Stabilises the East () and elevated from the status of a village marquis to a county marquis under the title &quot;Marquis of Wuhu&quot; ().

In late 224, when Cao Pi mobilised a large army to attack Sun Quan, Xu Sheng suggested to pitch encampments from Jianye, erect fake towers within each camp, and suspend some warships on the river. Sun Quan&#x27;s other generals disagreed and felt that such &quot;defences&quot; would serve no purpose, but Xu Sheng ignored them and proceeded with his plan.

Xu Sheng&#x27;s ruse effectively led to the construction of a &quot;wall&quot; along the river banks that served as a border stretching over hundreds of &quot;li&quot;. When Cao Pi reached Guangling Commandery (廣陵郡; covering parts of present-day Jiangsu), he saw Sun Quan&#x27;s &quot;strong defences&quot; and the high tide and sighed, &quot;Wei has thousands of armed cavalry units but they can&#x27;t be deployed here&quot;. He then withdrew his forces. Sun Quan&#x27;s generals finally recognised the value of Xu Sheng&#x27;s plan.

Xu Sheng died sometime during the Huangwu era (222-229) of Sun Quan&#x27;s reign before Sun Quan declared himself emperor and established the state of Eastern Wu. His militia and marquis title were inherited by his son, Xu Kai (徐楷).

==Appraisal==
Xu Sheng was known for his confidence and fervent loyalty towards Sun Quan, as demonstrated in the incident when Xing Zhen (邢貞) came to confer the title &quot;King of Wu&quot; () on Sun Quan. In 220, Sun Quan became a vassal of the state of Cao Wei, which replaced the Han dynasty after the Wei founder, Cao Pi, forced Emperor Xian to abdicate the throne to him. Cao Pi sent Xing Zhen as an emissary to meet Sun Quan and confer the title &quot;King of Wu&quot; () on him. Xing Zhen behaved arrogantly in front of Sun Quan and incurred much anger from Sun Quan&#x27;s subjects, including Zhang Zhao and Xu Sheng. Xu Sheng told his colleagues: &quot;Isn&#x27;t it humiliating to watch our lord submit to Xing Zhen and not be able to serve him with our lives and help him conquer Xu, Luoyang and Bashu?&quot; Tears rolled down his face. When Xing Zhen heard Xu Sheng&#x27;s remark, he told an aide: &quot;It&#x27;s obvious from the reactions of the subjects of Jiangdong that they won&#x27;t remain subservient for long.&quot; Xing Zhen was right, because in 222, Sun Quan declared independence from Wei but continued ruling his domain under the title &quot;King of Wu&quot; before declaring himself emperor in 229.

Xu Sheng&#x27;s ego did not always lead to positive actions though. After the Battle of Ruxu in 217, Zhou Tai was appointed as the commander of the garrison at Ruxu, with Xu Sheng and Zhu Ran as his subordinates. However, both of them were unwilling to submit to Zhou Tai&#x27;s command, citing the latter&#x27;s humble origins in comparison to their more affluent family backgrounds. When Sun Quan heard about it, he visited Ruxu and hosted a party for all the officers there, during which he asked Zhou Tai to display his battle scars for all to see. He later awarded Zhou Tai with an imperial parasol. After that incident, Xu Sheng and Zhu Ran agreed to submit to Zhou Tai&#x27;s command.

Xu Sheng was also known for his tendency to worry too much. When he was serving as the Prefect of Wuhu County, he arrested one of Jiang Qin&#x27;s subordinates and sought permission from Sun Quan to have that man executed. However, Sun Quan declined because Jiang Qin was away battling bandits in Yuzhang Commandery (). Since then, Xu Sheng had been apprehensive of Jiang Qin. During the Battle of Ruxu in 217, Jiang Qin and Lü Meng were placed in charge of military discipline among Sun Quan&#x27;s forces. Xu Sheng was worried that Jiang Qin might use the opportunity to find fault with him, but much to his surprise, Jiang Qin praised him in front of Sun Quan. When Sun Quan asked Jiang Qin why he did so, Jiang Qin replied that Xu Sheng was &quot;loyal and hardworking, possessed both courage and talent, and was capable of leading thousands of troops&quot;.

<doc id="380811" wikidata="Q3180912" url="?curid=380811" title="John Anderson (Australian politician)">
<text>John Duncan Anderson (born 14 November 1956) is an Australian politician and commentator who served as the 11th deputy prime minister of Australia and leader of the National Party from 1999 to 2005. He had also served as Minister for Primary Industries and Energy Minister for Transport and Regional Development in the Howard government.

As a government minister and later deputy prime minister, Anderson had cabinet responsibility for primary industry policy, including transport infrastructure and agricultural water rights. He was a member of Australia&#x27;s National Security Committee from 1999 to 2005 when it faced the War on terror, in particular the Bali bombings.

After politics, Anderson has been published for his views on civic freedoms, global food security, modern slavery and the economy. In 2017 he launched a web-based interview program, &quot;Conversations with John Anderson&quot;, featuring interviews with public intellectuals. In this role he has advocated for many socially conservative causes, such as the &quot;no&quot; case in the 2023 Australian referendum and the establishment of the Alliance for Responsible Citizenship.

== Early life and education ==
Anderson was born in Sydney on 14 November 1956. He is the son of Duncan Anderson and Beryl Mann. His family had been graziers and landowners of Mullaley in northern New South Wales since the 1840s. Duncan Anderson served with the Australian Light Horse troops in North Africa during World War II.

When he was three years old, John&#x27;s mother died of cancer. In 1970, his sister Jane died after being struck on the neck by a cricket ball that had been hit by Anderson (then aged 13) while playing cricket at home with his father.

Anderson has described his religious upbringing as &quot;very, very nominal Presbyterian&quot;.

Anderson was tutored at home by his aunt, Margaret, through Blackfriars Correspondence School. He attended Gunnedah South Public School in Gunnedah and The King&#x27;s School in the Sydney suburb of Parramatta, boarding at Waddy House.

He began a degree in arts and laws at the University of Sydney, where he was a resident of St Paul&#x27;s College, but dropped law shortly after commencing. Anderson graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in history and returned to the family property where he was a farmer and grazier, and completed a Master of Arts during this time.

== Early parliamentary career ==
Anderson became chair of the National Party&#x27;s Tambar Springs branch in 1984. A few weeks later, MP Frank O&#x27;Keefe recommended Anderson run for the seat of Paterson, where he was current member, but the seat was abolished later that year. In 1989, Ralph Hunt, the sitting MP in the neighbouring seat of Gwydir, retired and supported Anderson to replace him. The ensuing pre-selection contest was close with Anderson defeating several contenders, including future independent MP Tony Windsor. Anderson won the election with a two-party preferred result of 56%. His first remarks to the House of Representatives were part of a condolence motion for his mentor, and former MP, Frank O&#x27;Keefe. Anderson gave his maiden speech on 17 August 1989.

After the 1990 election, Anderson became Parliamentary Secretary to the Shadow Minister for Industrial Relations, John Howard. After the 1993 election, Anderson was elected deputy leader of the Nationals, defeating three other candidates; Peter McGauran, John Sharp and Bruce Scott; and was appointed Shadow Minister for Primary Industry. In the shadow ministry, he criticised the minister Simon Crean on the government-set price floor for wool.

== Cabinet minister ==
In the 1996 Australian federal election, Anderson made an election promise with John Howard for the establishment of a $1 billion fund to restore the national estate, including programs to arrest soil degradation.&quot; He was made the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and joined the five-person &quot;razor gang&quot; led by Peter Costello with the task of cutting $6 to $8 billion from government expenditure. Anderson advocated that diesel fuel rebates, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service and agricultural research and development should be protected from the spending cuts because they &quot;create growth even if they are funded by debt.&quot;

=== Minister for Primary Industries and Energy ===
Anderson&#x27;s three years in the primary industries portfolio were marked by conflict as government protection of primary industries were removed. During this time, the government deregulated the wool, wheat and dairy sectors, and privatised much of the meat and livestock industry. Anderson led a delegation of Australian business leaders to visit Taiwan in September 1996 in his role as primary industries minister, which the People&#x27;s Republic of China said contravened the One China policy.

In response to the government-owned Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) being left with a surplus of four million bales of unsold wool and a debt of around $2 billion, Anderson and the Coalition government gave wool producers a pay-out of $300 million, drawing down against their equity in the wool stockpile, despite objections from many National Party members who preferred a policy of freezing sales from the stockpile. The government wool-owning entity was entirely privatised, to become Woolstock Australia, by August 2001.

Anderson announced significant restructures of the meat and livestock industry in 1997, which were supported with some reservations by farmers groups, such as NSW Farmers. In 1998, Meat &amp; Livestock Australia was created from the two organisations, with the goal of becoming a less costly, producer-owned service delivery body.

=== Minister for Transport and Regional Development ===
In September 1997, Anderson assumed the portfolio for Transport and Regional Development, giving him responsibility for developing national rail, road and water infrastructure. Anderson oversaw the creation of the Australian Rail Track Corporation, a Commonwealth body set up to own or hold long-term leases over much of the continental rail network.

In response to criticism over industry deregulation, the privatisation of Telstra and gun control laws, Fischer and Anderson scheduled a party meeting on 5 August 1998 to declare their leadership positions vacant, inviting their party room critics, particularly Bob Katter and De-Anne Kelly, to replace them. Anderson and Fischer then nominated for the positions they had vacated and were re-elected unopposed.

During the 1998 federal election, private polling indicated that up to 49% of people in Anderson&#x27;s seat of Gwydir intended to vote for the new Pauline Hanson&#x27;s One Nation party. Anderson suffered a 16.18% swing against him with a primary vote of just 46.14%, the only time his first-round votes were below 50%. Anderson himself attributed the decline in his vote to his constant travel.

== Deputy prime minister ==
Following the resignation of deputy prime minister and Nationals leader Tim Fischer, Anderson was elected unopposed as the new leader and became deputy prime minister himself on 20 July 1999. Anderson kept his ministerial responsibilities in Transport and Regional Development and were extended to the delivery of government services, such as health, to regional and remote centres, and a role in the National Security Committee. Anderson also assumed the role of acting prime minister when John Howard was overseas, such as during the September 11 attacks and in the aftermath of the 2002 Bali bombings.

In 2002, Anderson called for laws making it an offence to desecrate the Australian flag.

Anderson&#x27;s ministerial department was responsible for paying outstanding wages and entitlements for former employees of the insolvent airline Ansett Australia, though allowing it to collapse.

During Anderson&#x27;s tenure as deputy prime minister, the Coalition government established the National Water Initiative in 2004, allowing producers to gain ongoing access entitlements for a share of water available for use, rather than fixed-term entitlements without guarantee of renewal.

On 17 November 2004, the MP for New England, Tony Windsor, accused Anderson of offering him, via businessman Greg Maguire, a diplomatic or trade posting if Windsor would surrender his seat. As the statement was made under parliamentary privilege, it was protected from litigation for defamation. Anderson strongly repudiated the claims. The Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee, the Federal Police and the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions found that there were no grounds to support Windsor&#x27;s allegations.

On the last sitting day of Parliament before the winter recess of 2005, Anderson announced his resignation from the leadership of the National Party, and as deputy prime minister, citing a &quot;debilitating but thankfully benign prostate condition&quot;. He was succeeded in both positions by Mark Vaile, and retired from parliament at the 2007 federal election.

To date Anderson is the last deputy prime minister to have served for at least a full parliamentary term.

==Business and media==

Anderson served as chairman of Eastern Star Gas (ESG) from October 2007 until 2011 when the publicly listed company and its flagship Narrabri Gas Project was acquired by Santos in a $924 million deal. He was appointed to the Review Panel for the Act of Recognition in 2013 to provide a report to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, along with Tanya Hosch and Richard Eccles. The final report of the panel was published in September 2014.

In the late 2010s, Anderson increased his presence on online media through podcasting and conducting interviews on Youtube, as well as newspaper opinion pieces and television appearances. In 2018, Anderson began hosting a podcast and YouTube channel on which he interviews public figures, including historian Victor Davis Hanson, former chief rabbi Jonathan Sacks, former Labor Party leader Kim Beazley, Jonathan Haidt, Glenn Loury, Niall Ferguson, and psychologist Jordan Peterson.

With this public position, Anderson has taken notable stands on national and cultural issues. Prior to the 2017 Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey, Anderson was interviewed on ABC television and spoke about his opposition to same-sex marriage. He opposed the Voice to Parliament in the 2023 Australian Indigenous Voice referendum. He formed an advocacy group towards this end alongside Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price and Warren Mundine, saying the voice would only &quot;beget divisiveness and cynicism.&quot; The referendum was later defeated.In March 2021, Anderson declared himself a candidate in the National Party&#x27;s pre-selection for Senate candidacy at the 2022 federal election. However, former party director Ross Cadell, won the top spot on the Nationals&#x27; Senate ticket. Anderson then announced that the political run had come to an end.

Anderson worked with Baroness Stroud, Paul Marshall and Jordan Peterson to found the Alliance for Responsible Citizenship, a socially conservative movement aiming to give Western society &quot;new cohesion and purpose.&quot; He spoke at its first global conference in London, in 2023, saying the group emerged as a response to a &quot;civilisational&quot; moment in which the Western world &quot;is plagued by self-doubt and confusion&quot; regarding its values and beliefs.

==Honours==

On 13 June 2011, Anderson was named an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in the 2011 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours for &quot;distinguished service to the Parliament of Australia, particularly for supporting rural and regional communities, transport development, and water management initiatives.&quot;

In 2019, Anderson was elected a Fellow of the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering (FTSE) for sustainable means for agricultural uses in rural Australia.

In June 2022, Anderson was promoted to Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) in the 2022 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours for &quot;eminent service to rural and regional development, to leadership in international agricultural research and food security, to social commentary, and through contributions to not-for-profit organisations&quot;.

<text>State parks are parks or other protected areas managed at the sub-national level within those nations which use &quot;state&quot; as a political subdivision. State parks are typically established by a state to preserve a location on account of its natural beauty, historic interest, or recreational potential. There are state parks under the administration of the government of each U.S. state, some of the Mexican states, and in Brazil. The term is also used in the Australian states of and New South Wales. The equivalent term used in Canada, Argentina, South Africa, and Belgium, is provincial park. Similar systems of local government maintained parks exist in other countries, but the terminology varies.

State parks are thus similar to national parks, but under state rather than federal administration. Similarly, local government entities below state level may maintain parks, e.g., regional parks or county parks. In general, state parks are smaller than national parks, with a few exceptions such as Anza-Borrego Desert State Park in California, and Wood-Tikchik State Park in Alaska, the largest state park in the United States.

In addition to preserving natural landscapes and providing recreational opportunities, many state parks also serve as important educational resources. They often offer guided tours, interpretive programs, and exhibits that help visitors learn about the local flora, fauna, geology, and cultural history of the area. These programs are designed not only to enhance the visitor experience but also to promote conservation awareness and encourage responsible enjoyment of natural resources.

== State parks by country ==
=== United States ===
There are 6,792 state park units in the United States, according to the National Association of State Park Directors (NASPD). There are some 813 million annual visits to the country&#x27;s state parks. The NASPD further counts over of trail, 217,367 campsites, and 8,277 cabins and lodges across U.S. state parks. The largest state park system in the United States is Alaska State Parks, with over 100 sites encompassing 3.3 million acres.

Many states include designations beyond &quot;state park&quot; in their state parks systems. Other designations might be state recreation areas, state beaches, and state nature reserves. Some state park systems include long-distance trails and historic sites. To encourage tourism in rural areas, several states have simple lodges, inns, hotels, or motels (usually with a restaurant) for lodging at some parks. These typically use &quot;Resort&quot; in the name, such as &quot;_____ Resort State Park&quot; in West Virginia state parks and &quot;_____ State Resort Park&quot; in neighboring Kentucky state parks, which has 17 such resort parks, the most of any state. Other states use the Resort name inconsistently (like DeGray Lake Resort State Park, the only one out of three resorts in Arkansas state parks), or have only one such park (South Carolina state parks&#x27; Hickory Knob State Resort Park), or do not use the designation at all (such as the lodges of Georgia state parks). The term &quot;lodge&quot; may also refer to a hiking lodge, essentially a large cabin for hikers rather than a large facility with private rooms and a restaurant. Other lodging may include yurts and tipis.

Not all parks owned by a state are necessarily part of its state-park system, such as Stone Mountain Park near Atlanta. Some Texas state parks are a land lease from the U.S. government, while Mackinac National Park was handed down to become the first of the Michigan state parks. As with national parks, facilities at state parks are often leased to concessionaires to operate. Breaks Interstate Park is operated under an interstate compact by Virginia state parks, although it is also one of the Kentucky state parks, straddling both sides of the state line. Other multi-state parks are legally two separate parks with the same name and more informal cooperation between them.

==== History ====
The title of oldest state park in the United States is claimed by Niagara Falls State Park in New York, established in 1885. Several public parks previously or currently maintained at the state level pre-date it. Indian Springs State Park has been operated continuously by the state of Georgia as a public park since 1825, although it did not gain the title &quot;State Park&quot; until 1931. In 1864 Yosemite Valley and Mariposa Grove were ceded by the federal government to California until Yosemite National Park was proclaimed in 1890. In 1878 Wisconsin set aside a vast swath of its northern forests as &quot;The State Park&quot; but, needing money, sold most of it to lumber companies within 20 years. Mackinac National Park was established in 1875 as the second U.S. national park before being converted to a state park in 1895. The first state park with the designation of &quot;state park&quot; was Itasca State Park in Minnesota, established in 1891.

Many state park systems date to the 1930s, when around 800 state parks (and several national ones) across the country were developed with assistance from federal job-creation programs like the Civilian Conservation Corps and Works Progress Administration.

<doc id="380813" wikidata="Q1336699" url="?curid=380813" title="Liao Hua">
<text>Liao Hua (d. 264), courtesy name Yuanjian, originally named Liao Chun, was a Chinese military general and politician of the state of Shu Han during the Three Kingdoms period of China. Like Zhang Yi and Zong Yu, Liao was one of few officials who served the Shu-Han state throughout its entire existence.

==Early career as Guan Yu&#x27;s subordinate==
Liao Hua was from Xiangyang, Jing Province. He was a registrar () under Guan Yu, a general who served under the warlord Liu Bei and guarded Liu Bei&#x27;s territories in Jing Province. In late 219, while Guan Yu was away at the Battle of Fancheng, Liu Bei&#x27;s ally, Sun Quan, broke the Sun–Liu alliance by launching an invasion of Jing Province and conquering most of Liu Bei&#x27;s territories in the province. Guan Yu was captured and executed by Sun Quan&#x27;s forces. Liao Hua became a prisoner-of-war of Sun Quan, but he constantly thought of returning to Liu Bei&#x27;s side, so he faked his own death and succeeded in deceiving his captors and escaping. He brought his elderly mother with him and headed west towards Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing), where Liu Bei&#x27;s domain was based.

==Career in Shu Han==
In 221, Liu Bei declared himself emperor and established the state of Shu Han. Later that year, he launched a military campaign against Sun Quan to retake his lands in Jing Province and avenge Guan Yu. Liao Hua and his mother encountered the Shu army at Zigui County. Liu Bei was very pleased to see Liao Hua and he appointed the latter as the Administrator of Yidu Commandery (宜都郡; around present-day Yidu, Hubei). After Liu Bei died in 223, Liao Hua became an army adviser () under Zhuge Liang, the Imperial Chancellor of Shu. He was later assigned to be in charge of Guangwu Commandery (廣武郡; around present-day Yongdeng County, Gansu) and was subsequently promoted to Right General of Chariots and Cavalry (). He was also appointed as the Inspector of Bing Province even though Bing Province was not under Shu&#x27;s jurisdiction, and enfeoffed as a Marquis of a Central District (). He was known for his fiery personality and determination. His position in the Shu military was equivalent to Zhang Yi while higher than Zong Yu.

During September of the year 238, Liao Hua led his troops to attack the encampment where the Inspector of Yong Province (雍州刺史), at the time Guo Huai stationed along with the main Wei army of the region. In response, Guo Huai dispatched his subordinates Wang Yun (王赟) Administrator of Guangwei (廣魏) along with You Yi (游奕) Administrator of Nan&#x27;an (南安) to counter this offensive. The Wei commanders wanted to disperse their forces to encircle the Shu army and occupy the strategic points between the mountains to prevent them from escaping, however at the same time this strategy had the Wei army scattered with many of You Yi&#x27;s camps exposed in a dangerous position. Liao Hua saw through this and quickly seized the opportunity to defeat them while they were still unprepared. You Yi&#x27;s army was forced to retreat while Wang Yun was killed in battle by an arrow.

Liao Hua was critical of the Shu general Jiang Wei, who continued Zhuge Liang&#x27;s aggressive foreign policy against Shu&#x27;s rival state, Cao Wei, by launching a series of eleven campaigns to attack Cao Wei between 240 and 262. He participated in the third and fourth campaigns in 247 and 249 respectively. In 262, when Jiang Wei was about to embark on the eleventh campaign, Liao Hua remarked: &quot;&#x27;One who does not refrain from using military force will end up burning himself.&#x27; This is Boyue(Jiang Wei)&#x27;s current situation. He is inferior to the enemy in terms of intelligence and military power, yet he keeps attacking them. How can he expect to overcome them? The events of today are exactly as described in this line from the &quot;Classic of Poetry&quot;: &#x27;Why were these things not before me? Or why were they not after me?&#x27;&quot;

==Life after the fall of Shu==
In late 263, Shu&#x27;s rival state, Cao Wei, launched a campaign to conquer Shu and succeeded in doing so within a year when the Shu emperor Liu Shan surrendered. After the fall of Shu, Liao Hua was ordered to move out of former Shu territory to the Wei capital Luoyang. He died of illness on the journey.

Liao Hua&#x27;s birth year could not be determined because his age at the time of his death was not recorded in history. However, it could be deduced that he was in his 70s when he died: Around 261, when Zhuge Zhan took charge of affairs in the Shu imperial court, Liao Hua visited Zong Yu, who said: &quot;Both of us are already above the age of 70, ...&quot;

==&quot;Sao Mi Zhou&quot;==
The &quot;Sao Mi Zhou&quot; (掃迷帚; literally &quot;The broom sweeping away superstitions&quot;), a novel written by a certain Zhuangzhe (壯者; literally &quot;strong man&quot;) during the Qing dynasty, contained a saying about Liao Hua: &quot;There is no young reliable commander in Shu, so old generals like Liao Hua still have to be the vanguard.&quot; (蜀中無大將，廖化作先鋒)

It can be interpreted as: Shu was so lacking in young talents in its twilight years that elderly Liao Hua (more than 70 years old at that time) had to lead the vanguard of the Shu army in battle. The proverb is to describe a situation that there is a lack of young talents in a group or company and hence, old but experienced people will have to take the responsibilities themselves.

However, it can also be understood to describe a situation in which a person who is seemingly unfit for a job is forced into doing it, but is willing to face what seems to be insurmountable odds against him/her. This interpretation can be criticized as Liao Hua was adept in military affairs and he was one of a few people who experienced the whole ups and downs of the Shu Han regime. He is regarded one of four cornerstones of the late Shu Han regime in the Hanzhong region, together first with Wang Ping and Ju Fu then with Zhang Yi (Bogong) and him.

==&quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==

The 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; has a few stories about Liao Hua which are not found in historical records.

In Chapter 27, Liao Hua, a bandit chief and former Yellow Turban rebel, encountered Guan Yu while the latter was on a quest to reunite with Liu Bei. He was thanked by Guan Yu after rescuing Liu Bei&#x27;s two kidnapped wives, Lady Gan and Lady Mi, from a fellow bandit named Du Yuan, but refused to accept him as a follower owing to his bandit roots. He would only reappear in Chapter 60, joining Guan Yu as he guarded Jing Province, and as Liu Bei was entering Yi Province.

In Chapter 73, Liao Hua took control of the vanguard during Guan Yu&#x27;s march on Xiangyang. He successfully lured the enemy generals Cao Ren and Zhai Yuan out of their castle, allowing Guan Yu to seize it. In the subsequent Battle of Fancheng, Liao Hua was stationed at Sizhong where he was in mutual support of Guan Ping&#x27;s encampment at Yancheng. When the enemy general Xu Huang captured both Sizhong and Yancheng, Liao Hua and Guan Ping fought their way south to join Guan Yu. When Guan Yu received news that Liu Bei&#x27;s territories in Jing Province had been conquered by Sun Quan&#x27;s army, he retreated to Maicheng () and was besieged there by Sun&#x27;s forces. In Maicheng, Liao Hua volunteered to break out of the siege and seek reinforcements from Liu Feng and Meng Da in Shangyong (). However, Liu Feng and Meng Da refused to help Guan Yu, so Liao Hua had no choice but to travel to Chengdu to report the situation to Liu Bei. By then, Guan Yu had been captured in an ambush and executed by Sun Quan.

In his later life and career, Liao Hua actively participated in the Shu campaigns (Zhuge Liang&#x27;s Northern Expeditions and Jiang Wei&#x27;s Northern Expeditions) against Wei. One of his most celebrated moments came in Chapter 103, when Sima Yi was retreating from Shangfang Valley. Liao Hua pursued the fleeing general into a dense forest and, being a proficient horseman, was able to catch up and get close enough to strike him down. However, when Sima Yi swerved around a tree, Liao Hua missed the shot and his sword became lodged into the wood, allowing Sima Yi to escape. During the chase, however, Sima Yi dropped his golden helmet. Liao Hua took the helmet and traveled back to Zhuge Liang who rewarded him with the first grade of merit for his attempt. This event angered Wei Yan who felt Liao Hua was being unfairly praised. Zhuge Liang noticed this but said nothing, leading to a mild distaste for Wei Yan&#x27;s jealousy. The helmet was henceforth used as a means of mocking and provoking the Wei army. Following Zhuge Liang&#x27;s death, Liao Hua moved up the ranks under Jiang Wei, eventually receiving the second-in-command military rank of General of Chariots and Cavalry. As Jiang Wei&#x27;s senior general, Liao Hua was often tasked with the most important of duties, such as leading the vanguard and dueling enemy generals. Despite his steadfast loyalty to Shu, Liao Hua disagreed with Jiang Wei&#x27;s constant invasions of Wei and his attempts to claim victory through overpowering numbers, believing these tactics to be a drain on resources and morale; he let it be known that he would run the military differently if he were in command, and this led to quarrels between Jiang Wei and himself. When Liu Shan eventually submitted to Wei in Chapter 119, Liao Hua succumbed to grief and died.

<doc id="380821" wikidata="Q378539" url="?curid=380821" title="Wei Yan">
<text>Wei Yan () (died October 234), courtesy name Wenchang, was a Chinese military general and politician of the state of Shu Han during the Three Kingdoms period of China. Originally a subordinate of the warlord Liu Bei during the late Eastern Han dynasty, Wei Yan rose through the ranks and became a general after Liu Bei seized control of Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing) in 214. His performance in battle helped him to become a prominent figure in the Shu military in a short period of time. He was later appointed as the Administrator of Hanzhong Commandery and as an Area Commander in 219. Between 228 and 234, he participated actively in the Northern Expeditions led by the Shu regent Zhuge Liang against Shu&#x27;s rival state, Cao Wei. After Zhuge Liang&#x27;s death in September 234, Wei Yan was executed by another Shu general, Ma Dai, for alleged treason.

== Early life ==
Wei Yan was from Yiyang Commandery (), which covered parts of present-day Nanyang in southern Henan and parts of northern Hubei. He started his career as a foot soldier under the warlord Liu Bei, probably sometime between 209 and 211 when Liu Bei was in southern Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan). Around 212, he followed Liu Bei into Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing) and served Liu Bei as a personal retainer in a war against Liu Zhang, the Governor of Yi Province (益州牧). Huang Zhong and Wei Yan scored many military exploits during the capture of Guanghan County. Thus, Wei Yan promoted to full general.

The campaign met early success with the quick death of Gao Pei and Yang Huai and the later occupation of the passes, followed by the defeat of Liu Zhang&#x27;s reinforcements at Fu County. Pang Tong was killed during the siege of Luocheng and the siege became a prolonged one. One year later, Wei Yan and Liu Bei finally captured Luocheng, then surrounded and occupied Chengdu together with Zhuge Liang, Zhang Fei along with others. Thus, around the summer of 214, Liu Bei seized control of Yi Province from Liu Zhang. As Wei Yan has made several contributions in the conquest of Yi Province, Liu Bei promoted him to the rank of General of the Ivory Gate ().

==Administrator of Hanzhong ==
In 219, Wei Yan participated in Liu Bei&#x27;s Hanzhong Campaign against his rival Cao Cao. After Liu Bei captured Hanzhong, Liu Bei asked his subjects to nominate one of his generals to remain behind and guard Hanzhong. His subjects nominated Zhang Fei, who also strongly believed that he would most likely be chosen. However, much to everyone&#x27;s surprise, Liu Bei chose Wei Yan instead and appointed him as General Who Guards Distant Lands () and acting Administrator of Hanzhong (). When Liu Bei asked Wei Yan in front of everyone how would he perform his duty, the latter confidently replied:

 Liu Bei was very pleased and everyone was impressed with Wei Yan&#x27;s reply.

During his tenure, Wei Yan explained to Liu Bei that he used a strategy called the &quot;double gates&quot; (). The ancient text &quot;I Ching&quot; described this strategy as a particularly designed fortification which laid numerous military garrisons surrounding the outskirt and trail exits linking to Hanzhong.

Following the end of the Eastern Han dynasty and the start of the Three Kingdoms period in 220, Liu Bei declared himself emperor in 221 and established the state of Shu Han (or Shu) to challenge the legitimacy of the Cao Wei (or Wei) state established by Cao Cao&#x27;s successor, Cao Pi, to replace the Eastern Han dynasty. Liu Bei further promoted Wei Yan to General Who Guards the North () after his coronation.

==Northern Expeditions==

After Liu Bei died in 223, his son Liu Shan succeeded him as the emperor of Shu. In the same year, Liu Shan enfeoffed Wei Yan as a Marquis of a Chief Village ().

In 227, Zhuge Liang, the Imperial Chancellor of Shu, mobilised the Shu military and gathered troops in Hanzhong Commandery in preparation for a large scale invasion of Shu&#x27;s rival state, Cao Wei (or Wei), where he put Wei Yan in charge of the vanguard division and appointed him as acting Major under the Imperial Chancellor () and acting Inspector of Liang Province (). During this campaign, Wei Yan always requested to lead a separate detachment of 10,000 troops, take a different route through the Ziwu Valley () and rendezvous with the Shu main army at Tong Pass (; in present-day Tongguan County, Shaanxi).

Wei Yan argued that the Ziwu Valley and its resources could support the Shu army&#x27;s operations at least for a week. However, Zhuge Liang rejected the plan because he thought that it was too risky, prompting Wei Yan to call Zhuge Liang a coward and complain that his talent was not put to good use. When Chen Shou compiled the unofficial works on the history of Shu to write the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;, he only mentioned that Wei Yan suggested to Zhuge Liang to split the Shu army into two, and the two forces would take two different routes and rendezvous at Tong Pass.

Later in 230, during the Ziwu Campaign, Wei Yan led some troops towards Yangxi (; southwest of present-day Wushan County, Gansu) and engaged the Wei forces led by and Guo Huai and Fei Yao, where Wei Yan managed to inflict a heavy defeat to them. During the same year, he also assisted another Shu general Wu Yi in attacking Nan&#x27;an Commandery (; southeast of present-day Longxi County, Gansu) where they scored another victory against a Wei army led by Fei Yao.

During the fourth campaign in 231, Wei Yan was also involved in the Battle of Mount Qi when he, together with the Shu generals Gao Xiang and Wu Ban, scored a major victory against the Wei army led by Sima Yi, during which they killed 3,000 Wei soldiers and seized 5,000 sets of armour and 3,100 crossbows. Sima Yi was forced to retreat back to his camp. Zhang He, a veteran Wei general, was also killed in battle during this conflict. As a reward for his contributions, the Shu government promoted Wei Yan to Vanguard Military Adviser () and Senior General Who Attacks the West (), and elevated him from a village marquis to a county marquis under the title &quot;Marquis of Nanzheng&quot; ().

==Battle of Wuzhang Plains==

In 234, Zhuge Liang launched the fifth Shu invasion of Wei, with Wei Yan leading the Shu vanguard force as one of the commanding officers. Wei Yan reportedly had a dream that a horn grew on top of his head. He asked the dream diviner Zhao Zhi () the meaning of this. Zhao Zhi lied to him and said:

After Wei Yan left, Zhao Zhi revealed to someone that the Chinese character for &quot;horn&quot; () is composed of a &quot;knife&quot; () with &quot;use&quot; () below it, which meant that dreaming of &quot;using a knife&quot; atop one&#x27;s head was an extremely ominous omen. Later in the encampment, Wei Yan had a quarrel with Yang Yi, Zhuge Liang&#x27;s chief clerk, whom Wei Yan was extremely resentful of. Whenever they got into heated quarrels, Wei Yan often drew his sword and brandished it in front of Yang Yi, who sobbed as tears rolled down his cheeks. This prompted Fei Yi to step in to stop them from fighting and keep them under control until Zhuge Liang&#x27;s death. Zhuge Liang was upset by the lack of harmony between Wei Yan and Yang Yi, but was unwilling to side with either of them because he appreciated the talents of both men.

When Zhuge Liang became critically ill during the invasion, he gave secret orders to Yang Yi, Fei Yi and Jiang Wei to lead the army back to Shu after his death, with Wei Yan in charge of the rearguard and Jiang Wei to follow behind. If Wei Yan refused to follow the order, they were to retreat without him. When Zhuge Liang died, news of his death was kept secret. Yang Yi sent Fei Yi to meet Wei Yan and assess his intentions. Wei Yan told Fei Yi:

Wei Yan then asked Fei Yi to assist him in making arrangements for part of the Shu army to remain behind and continue with the campaign, while the rest would retreat back to Shu. Fei Yi pretended to write a letter, signed by both of them, and told Wei Yan that he would read out the letter to all the officers about the new arrangements. It turned out that he had lied by telling Wei Yan that he would go back and explain Wei Yan&#x27;s answer to Yang Yi.

==Death==
Wei Yan then let Fei Yi leave, but he immediately regretted his decision and went after Fei Yi, but could not catch up with Fei Yi in time. He then sent his subordinate to meet Yang Yi and the others, but was shocked to discover that all units were preparing to retreat in accordance with Zhuge Liang&#x27;s final orders. Wei Yan wanted to continue the battle even though Zhuge Liang had died, so he became furious when he heard of the retreat. He intended to block the Shu forces from retreating, so he led his force towards the south – ahead of the main army under Yang Yi&#x27;s command – and sealed the return route by destroying the gallery roads leading back to Shu.

Wei Yan and Yang Yi separately wrote memorials to the Shu imperial court to accuse each other of treason; both memorials arrived in Chengdu on the same day. The Shu emperor Liu Shan asked the ministers Dong Yun and Jiang Wan for their opinions. Both of them sided with Yang Yi and felt that Wei Yan&#x27;s actions were suspicious. In the meantime, Yang Yi ordered his men to cut down trees to rebuild the gallery roads, and his troops marched day and night to catch up with Wei Yan. Wei Yan arrived at the southern valley first and ordered his soldiers to attack Yang Yi. Yang Yi sent Wang Ping to resist Wei Yan. Wang Ping shouted at Wei Yan:

 Wei Yan&#x27;s men knew that their commander was in the wrong so they deserted.

Wei Yan was left with only his son(s) and a few followers, and they fled towards Hanzhong Commandery. Yang Yi ordered Ma Dai to give chase. Ma Dai executed Wei Yan, brought his head back, and threw it in front of Yang Yi. Yang Yi trampled on Wei Yan&#x27;s head and said:

Wei Yan&#x27;s family members and close relatives were also executed. Before Wei Yan&#x27;s death, Jiang Wan had led the imperial guards from Chengdu to deal with what appeared to be a mutiny by Wei Yan. They had travelled for about 10 &quot;li&quot; (about three miles) when they received news of Wei Yan&#x27;s death; they then turned back and returned to Chengdu.

== Character analysis ==
Wei Yan was known for treating his soldiers well and for his bravery with valour that surpassed others. However, he was also boastful of his talents, hence his peers tended to shun him. Sun Quan had also once remarked that once Zhuge Liang died, Wei Yan would prove to be an unreliable person. Chen Shou, who wrote Wei Yan&#x27;s biography in the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;, analysed Wei Yan&#x27;s death as such: Chen Shou also remarked that Zhuge Liang valued Wei Yan&#x27;s bravery and was caught in a dilemma when the latter got into conflict with Yang Yi, whose talent Zhuge Liang also appreciated.

A similar, but somewhat different and more detailed, account exists in the historical text &quot;Weilüe&quot; by Yu Huan. It stated that Zhuge Liang told Wei Yan to set up defences, although he also gave further instruction to &quot;not return here&quot;. Wei Yan kept this order to himself and did not share it with others, thus prompting Wei Yan&#x27;s rival, Yang Yi, to spread false rumours that Wei Yan intended to defect to the enemy, causing Shu forces to turn against Wei Yan and result in his downfall. Pei Songzhi, who added the &quot;Weilüe&quot; account to Wei Yan&#x27;s biography and annotated the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;, cast doubts on the &quot;Weilüe&quot; account:

Wei Yan&#x27;s death was explained in political terms in &quot;Injustice to Wei Yan&quot; (), a neoteric article by Zhu Ziyan, a history professor from Shanghai University. Zhu wrote that Zhuge Liang personally appointed Jiang Wan, Fei Yi and Jiang Wei to be his successors, but Wei Yan&#x27;s appointments and contributions were greater than those of any of them at the time. Zhuge Liang ostracised Wei Yan and cracked down on him because he wanted to eliminate Wei Yan as a possible obstacle to his appointed successors.

Meanwhile, in the &quot;Analysis of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, Yi Zhongtian commented that Zhuge Liang&#x27;s last order to forcibly retreat and leave Wei Yan alone was contradicted by what he personally instructed Wei Yan; such contradiction indirectly led to tragedy between Wei Yan and Yang Yi. The forced retreat after Zhuge Liang&#x27;s death might have been Yang Yi&#x27;s idea rather than Zhuge Liang&#x27;s, since Zhuge Liang died before devising any withdrawal plan. Yi Zhongtian thus theorised that there was no evidence of the theory that Yang Yi fabricated the order. Yi Zhongtian also explained another possible hypothesis that Zhuge Liang&#x27;s final order &quot;leave Wei Yan alone&quot; simply meant &quot;ignore Wei Yan&quot; rather than &quot;kill Wei Yan&quot;; the Shu forces had to withdraw and if Wei Yan could not be stopped, they should have just let him be. Yi Zhongtian analysed and criticised Wei Yan for not grasping the political-economic reasons behind Zhuge Liang&#x27;s expeditions and his extreme caution. Zhuge Liang launched the expeditions not only to restore the Han dynasty, but also to keep Shu in a state of war so that he could strengthen his control over Shu&#x27;s internal affairs and suppress potential dissidence among local elites in Shu.

As the smallest and weakest amongst the Three Kingdoms, Shu would be the first one to be targeted, hence it had to launch preemptive attacks to intimidate its opponents, to expand its territory, and to improve its conditions - the chances of success were not high but it would have been better than doing nothing. Zhuge Liang&#x27;s goal of restoring the Han dynasty was sincere and had never changed. However, Wei was too powerful and could not be defeated in a single blow, hence the expeditions had to be carried out in a careful manner with guaranteed advances rather than going with daring but risky strikes which could lead to disasters like the Battles of Xiaoting and Fancheng. Such a complicated situation could not be explained clearly to Wei Yan, and probably did not need to be, as Zhuge Liang wanted to keep Wei Yan&#x27;s morale at his peak.

==Ziwu Valley plan analysis==
Wei Yan&#x27;s reasoning for his Ziwu Valley Plan was recorded in the &quot;Weilüe&quot;, which was then added as an annotation to his biography in the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;, where Chen Shou recorded that Wei Yan received intelligence which led him to conclude that the defender of the strategic city of Chang&#x27;an, Xiahou Mao, was incompetent. Thus, Wei Yan reasoned, it would be easy for him to take 5,000 troops (and another 5,000 to carry supplies) across the Qin Mountains via the Ziwu Valley and into Chang&#x27;an. Wei Yan estimated that he would reach Chang&#x27;an in ten days and scare Xiahou Mao into flight, leaving the grain in Chang&#x27;an&#x27;s storehouses for Shu&#x27;s taking. There, Wei Yan&#x27;s force can wait for Zhuge Liang&#x27;s main army to take the safer road out of Xie Valley () and rendezvous in Chang&#x27;an. In this way, the region west of Xianyang could be conquered in one movement.&quot; The &quot;Weilue&quot; argued that the plan might have worked; Sima Yi had acknowledged the possibility that Shu forces would carry out the plan while Xiahou Mao had not realised it.

When the Wei government received intelligence about Wei Yan&#x27;s Ziwu Valley Plan, the Wei emperor Cao Rui immediately removed Xiahou Mao from his military command in Chang&#x27;an and reassigned him to be a Master of Writing () in Luoyang. Yi Zhongtian, in his &quot;Analysis of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, commented that both proponents and opponents of Wei Yan&#x27;s plan had strong reasons. Wei forces were rather unprepared to counter the first Northern Expedition as they had not foreseen that Shu forces could launch such an offensive, hence both Zhuge Liang and Wei Yan&#x27;s strikes could have dealt a massive blow to Wei defences. However, Wei Yan&#x27;s plan was also very risky, as neither Xiahou Mao&#x27;s retreat nor the timely arrival of the main Shu force led by Zhuge Jiang could have been guaranteed. Moreover, the Wei general Guo Huai was stationed nearby and could have come to Xiahou Mao&#x27;s aid.

However, recent scholarship of Chinese history criticised the &quot;Weilue&quot; account, stating that Yu Huan had exaggerated the alleged conflict between Wei Yan and Zhuge Liang over the latter&#x27;s rejection of the former&#x27;s Ziwu Valley plan. Wen-Chin Wang of the Department of Chinese Language and Literature suspected that the &quot;Weilue&quot; account was biased since Yu Huan supported the state of Wei.

== Legacy ==
=== Military fortification ===
The &quot;Heavy Gate&quot; () bulwark designed by Wei Yan during his tenure as Administrator of Hanzhong Commandery particularly turned out useful on two occasions when his successors as Administrator of Hanzhong Commandery used it to repel invaders. It also helped the Shu general Wang Ping defend Hanzhong Commandery from a massive invasion led by the Wei general Cao Shuang. The Shu general Jiang Wei later dismantled the &quot;Heavy Gate&quot; fortification in favour of his own design. However, Jiang Wei&#x27;s new defence strategy failed to impede Wei invaders led by Zhong Hui, and Jiang Wei himself ultimately lost control of Hanzhong.

=== Wei Yan Shrines ===
A Wei Yan Shrine () is located in Baique Village, Sanquan Township, Zitong County, Sichuan. In front of the shrine flows a Wei Family River (). On the plains east of the river, there once stood a Wei Family River Temple (), which had three stone tablets in front of it. One of the stone tablets bears the words &quot;Wei Yan once led soldiers and was stationed here.&quot; According to legend, in 231, during the fourth Shu invasion of Wei, Zhuge Liang ordered Wei Yan to lead a separate force to station south of the Wei Family River where, in memory of the incident, the locals built the Wei Family River Temple beside the river and a small bridge called &quot;General Bridge&quot; (). The Wei Yan Shrine was initially demolished by the government but was rebuilt in 1995. A statue of Wei Yan stands in the main hall of the shrine.

There is another temple attributed to Wei Yan in Wei Yan&#x27;s purported hometown in Weijia Village, Gaobao Township, Qingfeng County, Henan.

==In popular cultures==
===In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;===
Wei Yan appears as a character in the historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; by Luo Guanzhong, which romanticises the historical events leading to, and during the Three Kingdoms period, such as Wei Yan participation in the fictional Battle of Changsha. Wei Yan surrendered to Liu Bei after killing his superior, Han Xuan.

During a clash between Liu Bei against Ma Chao forces, Wei Yan defeat Ma Dai after they duelled for several bouts, causing the latter to flee.

During the battle in Hanzhong, Wei Yan and Zhang Fei were unable to overcame Zhang He, causing both to retreat.

According to Zhang Chaoju, Wei Yan was beaten during this campaign by Cao Cao&#x27;s general, Pang De.

Later, during the battle of Wuzhang plains, Wei Yan lured Sima Yi and his two sons, Sima Shi and Sima Zhao into a fire ambush. However, a sudden, heavy rain caused the fire to extinguish, and the plan failed; prompting the Simas to escape.

===Modern era depictions===
“Sun Qi Mountain” drama which was written by Wei Ming-Lun, that described the relationship between two important historical figures Zhuge Liang and Wei Yan depicted the latter in positive light as it was not Wei Yan intent to betray Shu, which making him as tragic hero figure.
Wei Yan is featured as a playable character in Koei&#x27;s &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; and &quot;Warriors Orochi&quot; video game series. He also appears in Koei&#x27;s &quot;Dynasty Tactics 2&quot;.

<text>The City of London Police is the territorial police force responsible for law enforcement within the City of London, England, including the Middle and Inner Temples. 

The force responsible for law enforcement within the remainder of the London region, outside the city, is the much larger Metropolitan Police, a separate organisation. The City of London, which is now primarily a financial business district with a small resident population but a large commuting workforce, is the historic core of London, and has an administrative history distinct from that of the rest of the metropolis, of which its separate police force is one manifestation.

The City of London area has a resident population of around 8,700; however, there is also a daily influx of approximately 513,000 commuters into the city, along with thousands of tourists.

The police authority is the Common Council of the City and, unlike other territorial forces in England and Wales, there is not a police and crime commissioner replacing that police authority by way of the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011, but like a police and crime commissioner, the Common Council is elected.

, the force had a workforce of 1,355 including 861 full-time police officers and 494 support staff. The force is also supported by much smaller numbers of special constables, police community support officers, and designated officers. The headquarters is located at the Guildhall (which also housed it from 1832 to 1840) and there is an additional station at Bishopsgate, with former stations including Moor Lane (destroyed in the Blitz on 29 December 1940) and Cloak Lane (closed 1965).

The City of London Police is the smallest territorial police force in England and Wales, both in terms of geographic area and head-count. The current commissioner (equivalent to the chief constable in non-London forces), is Peter O&#x27;Doherty, who was appointed in a temporary capacity in October 2023, and is set to become permanent commissioner in 2024, subject to royal assent.

==History==
===To 1850===
Traditionally the responsibility for policing in the city had been divided between day and night City Watch, primarily under the two sheriffs. Their responsibilities were shared with the aldermen&#x27;s officers – the ward beadles – who are now purely ceremonial. It was these officers&#x27; responsibility for ensuring that the Night Watch was maintained. Policing during the day eventually came under the City Patrol, which evolved into the City Day Police, which was modelled on the Metropolitan Police. The London City Police was officially formed in 1832, before becoming the City of London Police with the passing of the City of London Police Act 1839, which gave statutory approval to the force as an independent police body and headed off attempts made to merge it with the Metropolitan Police. It moved its headquarters from the corporation&#x27;s Guildhall to 26 Old Jewry in 1840. 

===1850–1989===
The first officer of the force to die in the line of duty was in 1857, followed by 31 more to date, including three killed in the 1910 Houndsditch murders. The force was involved in the investigation of the Jack the Ripper murders. 

Teams of the City of London Police have participated in the Olympic games three times in the tug of war tournament. At the 1908 Summer Olympics they won the gold medal, beating a Liverpool City Police team in the final. In 1912 a joint City-Metropolitan Police team was beaten in the final by a Stockholm Police team. At the 1920 Summer Olympics a solely City of London Police British team regained its title, beating the Netherlands. This was the last time tug of war was an Olympic sport, which means the City of London Police is still the reigning Olympic champion.

The force has had special constables since at least 1911, when 1,648 were called for duty during docks strikes. There was one day in 1918, when the only warranted officer within the city of London was a special constable Several regular officers of the force were killed in Nazi German air raids over London in 1941 and 1942. 

===1990–2001===
The early 1990s saw the IRA carry out a number of high-profile attacks in the city as part of the Troubles, such as the 1992 Baltic Exchange bombing and the 1993 Bishopsgate bombing, resulting in huge economic and infrastructural damage. As a result, the Traffic and Environmental Zone, better known as the &quot;ring of steel&quot;, was officially established in 1993 by Owen Kelly, the then City of London Police commissioner. Commander Hugh Moore suffered a fatal heart failure in 1993 following a violent arrest.

Some aspects of the ring of steel were &#x27;stepped down&#x27; in the late 1990s following the cessation of IRA hostilities but stepped up again after the September 11 terrorist attacks. The force&#x27;s headquarters relocated to Wood Street in 2001. 

===2001–present===
The City of London Special Constabulary were awarded the Ferrers Trophy in 2006 for the efforts of their officers after the 7 July 2005 London bombings. The award is given annually to police volunteers, for exceptional dedication and innovation. It was the first time in the award&#x27;s history that an entire special constabulary received the trophy. In 2010 the same trophy was awarded to Special Constable Patrick Rarden of the Honourable Artillery Company Detachment (part of the City of London Special Constabulary) for using his banking skills and experience to help train colleagues and provide invaluable assistance to solve fraud cases. 2002 saw the most recent City officer to die in the line of duty.

In 2015, the City of London Police mounted unit also escorted the exhumed remains of King Richard III through the city of Leicester from St Nicholas Church to Leicester Cathedral, en route to their reburial.

In May 2020, City of London Police officers stopped a vehicle driven by a man who had recently been interviewed by Channel 4 about a prior instance of police harassment, who they incorrectly accused of concealing drugs. After smashing his car window, officers strip-searched him, detained him for 21 hours and impounded his car. Following an investigation, City of London Police acknowledged failings in their treatment of the man, including returning the vehicle to him without first removing the broken glass, but declined to apologise and said his arrest had been lawful. In March 2021 the Independent Office for Police Conduct ordered City of London Police to conduct a new investigation into the incident, which resulted in the City of London Police having to apologise to the driver and identified &#x27;organisational and individual learning&#x27;.

==Organisation==
The City Police is organised into five directorates:
* Economic Crime Directorate
* Crime Directorate
* Uniformed Policing Directorate
* Information and Intelligence Directorate
* Business Support Directorate

Because of the City&#x27;s role as a world financial centre, the City of London Police has developed a great deal of expertise in dealing with fraud and &quot;is the acknowledged lead force within the UK for economic crime investigation.&quot; The Economic Crime Directorate includes:
* Dedicated Card and Payment Crime Unit (DCPCU)
* Insurance Fraud Department (IFED)
* National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB) and Action Fraud
* Police Intellectual Property Crime Unit (PIPCU)
* Economic Crime Academy (ECA) responsible for delivering counter fraud and economic crime training both nationally and internationally
* The Directorate also formerly had an Overseas Anti-Corruption Unit (OACU), however this unit (along with the Metropolitan Police&#x27;s Proceeds of Corruption Unit) was transferred to the NCA in 2015 and renamed the International Corruption Unit (ICU).

===Leadership structure===
Chief officer team:
* Commissioner – Peter O&#x27;Doherty
* Deputy Commissioner Local – Paul Betts
* Deputy Commissioner National – Nik Adams
* Commander – Umer Khan OBE
* Temporary Commander – Ollie Shaw
* Service Delivery Director – Chris Bell
* Chief Operating Officer – Alix Newbold
* Joint Chief Finance Officer – Alistair &quot;Ally&quot; Cook

==Uniform==

Whereas the majority of British police forces have white metal cap badges and buttons, those of the City Police are brass. The force also have red and white chequered sleeve and cap bands (red and white being the colours of the City of London), which in most other British police forces are black and white. In formal uniform, female officers wear a red and white cravat.

Their helmet (worn by male constables and sergeants) has altered little since its introduction in 1865 and has a crest instead of the white metal boss worn on the Metropolitan Police helmet. The &quot;helmet plate&quot; or badge is the City of London coat of arms; this is unusual for a police force in England and Wales in that it does not include St Edward&#x27;s Crown, neither does it have the Brunswick Star, which is used on most other police helmets in England and Wales.

On state and ceremonial occasions, the commissioner and assistant commissioners wear a special court dress uniform with a gold aiguillette and a cocked hat adorned with white swan&#x27;s feathers; other than on these occasions, they wear standard uniform.

==Equipment and vehicles==
City of London police officers carry warrant cards. Like most other police forces in Great Britain, City of London police officers are not routinely armed, but some officers have received firearms training and are authorised firearms officers. City of London police equipment includes PAVA irritant spray, batons, and handcuffs. Many officers are also equipped with the Taser electroshock weapon; according to the police force&#x27;s reported figures, Tasers have been deployed (including drawing or &quot;red-dotting&quot;) about seven times per month. In the September 2018 to September 2020 period, the City of London Police recorded 11 incidents of police officers firing Tasers on suspects.

The City of London Police maintains a fleet of police vehicles, including SUVs, compact cars, motorcycle, and vans, as well as one horsebox. All of the force&#x27;s response vehicles, including armed response vehicles (ARVs) carry a defibrillator and first aid supplies, for use in the event of an emergency.

==Mounted unit==

The City of London Police maintains a mounted police unit. In addition to regular duties, the horses of the mounted unit have been used to trample wildflower seeds at the Barbican Wildlife Garden at the request of the community wildlife gardeners. The horses&#x27; ceremonial duties include participation in Trooping the Colour and the Lord Mayor&#x27;s Show.

==Ranks==

The ranks from constable to chief superintendent are the same as all other British police forces. The three senior ranks are similar to those used by the Metropolitan Police.

===Insignia===
Constables and sergeants display collar numbers on their rank badges (in the range 1 to 150 for sergeants and 151 to 999 for constables). Officers between the ranks of inspector and chief superintendent (who do not have collar numbers) display their warrant numbers instead. All officers also wear name badges with their rank and surname (e.g. Police Constable John Smith would wear a badge displaying &quot;Constable Smith&quot;).

The City of London police also has a special constabulary with seven ranks of officers. As with regular officers, constables and sergeants display collar numbers on their rank badges (in the range 1001 to 1099 for sergeants and 1101 to 1299 for constables) and officers between the ranks of inspector and chief superintendent display their warrant numbers, in all cases followed by the letters &quot;SC&quot;. The rank badge for a special commander is identical to that for a regular commander. Name badges are identical to those worn by regular officers (e.g. Special Sergeant Mary Jones would wear a badge displaying &quot;Sergeant Jones&quot;).

As well as a PCSO rank
===Workforce===
The following is the current released workforce data. The &quot;chief officer&quot; category includes the commissioner, assistant commissioner and commanders, and the &quot;special constable&quot; category includes all special constable ranks.
==Special Constabulary==

As of December 2023 it consists of 47 volunteer officers, led by a special chief inspector, assisted by 2 special inspectors, 6 special sergeants and 38 special constables. The majority undertake duties during evenings and nights in support of the regular force in dealing with issues arising from the busy night-time economy of the city. However, other officers perform more specialist roles in the force&#x27;s other directorates including supporting the National Lead Force (NLF) in the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB) with a number of officers joining the national Cyber Volunteering initiative.

In 2023 the City of London Police undertook a major restructure of the COLP Special Constabulary, with the ranks of Special Commander and Special Superintendent being abolished and the chief officer now being Special Chief Inspector who reports to the Chief Superintendent for Local Policing who in turn answers to the Commander for Ops and Security.

==Other corporation policing bodies==
The City of London Corporation, the local authority for the city, also operates further limited policing bodies. These bodies are not part of the City of London Police:
* City of London market constabularies
* Hampstead Heath Constabulary,
* Epping Forest Keepers

<text>Bishopsgate was one of the eastern gates in London&#x27;s former defensive wall. The gate&#x27;s name is traditionally attributed to Earconwald, who was Bishop of London in the 7th century. It was first built in Roman times and marked the beginning of Ermine Street, the ancient road running from London to York (Eboracum). The gate was rebuilt twice in the 15th and 18th centuries, but was permanently demolished in 1760.

Bishopsgate gave its name to the Bishopsgate Ward of the City of London. The ward is traditionally divided into &quot;Bishopsgate Within&quot;, inside the line of the former wall, and &quot;Bishopsgate Without&quot; beyond it. &quot;Bishopsgate Without&quot; is described as part of London&#x27;s East End. The ancient boundaries of the City wards were reviewed in 1994 and 2013, so that the wards no longer correspond very closely to their historic extents. &quot;Bishopsgate Without&quot; gained a significant part of Shoreditch from the London Borough of Hackney, while nearly all of &quot;Bishopsgate Within&quot; was transferred to other wards.

Bishopsgate is also the name of the street, being the part of the originally Roman Ermine Street (now the A10) within the traditional extent of the Ward.

==The gate==
The gate was first built in the Roman era, probably at the time the wall was first built. The road though the gate, Ermine Street (known at this point as Bishopsgate) was in place long before the wall and the gate.

The gate is traditionally held to be named after Earconwald, a 7th-century Bishop of London (Bishop of the East Saxons). One of the ward&#x27;s ancient churches, St Ethelburga-the-Virgin within Bishopsgate, is dedicated to Eorconwald&#x27;s sister, St Ethelburga of Barking, the first Abbess of Barking Abbey.

In 1471, during the Wars of the Roses, the Yorkist-turned supporter of the House of Lancaster Bastard Fauconberg attacked London, trying to force his way across London Bridge and also attacking the eastern gates with a further five thousand men and artillery. Bishopsgate was set on fire and the attackers came close to capturing nearby Aldgate and with it the city. The attackers were repulsed from both gates with heavy losses, before being chased back to Bow Bridge and Blackwall.

The Bishop&#x27;s Gate was rebuilt by the Hansa merchants in 1471 in exchange for steelyard privileges. Its final form was erected in 1735 by the City authorities, but demolished in 1760. This gate often displayed the heads of criminals on spikes. London Wall (which is no longer extant in this sector) divided the ward and road into an intramural portion called Bishopsgate Within and an extramural portion called Bishopsgate Without.

The site of this former gate is marked by a stone bishop&#x27;s mitre, fixed high upon a building located near Bishopsgate&#x27;s junction with Wormwood Street, by the gardens there and facing the Heron Tower.

==Ward==
The ward is notable for its skyscrapers, and is home to the main London offices of several major banks, including National Westminster Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Although tens of thousands of people commute to and work in the ward, it has a resident population of only 222 (2011).

The ward is divided into two parts by the line of the former London Wall and gate which lay just north of Wormwood and Camomile Streets.
===Bishopsgate Without===
&quot;Bishopsgate Without&quot; corresponds to the parish of St Botolph-without-Bishopsgate. The church is located immediately north of the site of the original Gate on the west side of the road. The church was one of four in medieval London dedicated to Saint Botolph or Botwulf, a 7th-century East Anglian saint; three of these were outside city gates, with a fourth near London Bridge and the riverside wharves. The locations result from Botolph being regarded as the patron saint of boundaries, and by extension of trade and travel.

The eastern boundary of &quot;Bishopsgate Without&quot; is formed by Middlesex Street (better known as Petticoat Lane), with Blomfield Street on the western boundary. Blomfield Street was built on part of the historic course of the former River Walbrook, known at this point as &quot;Deepditch&quot;. Beyond &quot;Deepditch&quot; was the Moorfields (in Coleman Street Ward). The Blomfield Street section of the river was the focal point of the Walbrook Skulls; the result of the deposit of large quantities of decapitated Roman-era human skulls into the water. These are still often uncovered during building work.

&quot;Bishopsgate Without&quot; was, from 1247 to 1633, the first home of the Bethlem Royal Hospital (also known as Bedlam). This psychiatric hospital lay immediately north of St Botolph&#x27;s church.

Around 1597, the merchant Sir Paul Pindar, purchased several existing properties, and built himself a new home on the site (incorporating part of one or more of the old properties). The house had a fairly narrow frontage but extended a long way back. Bishopsgate Street had recently been paved, making the site convenient for Pindar&#x27;s business activities in East Anglia. The house had views over the open space in nearby Moorfields and Finsbury Fields, west of the Walbrook. The house was soon prestigious enough to be used as a base by several foreigh ambassadors, including the Venetian ambassador Pietro Contarini in 1617–18.

The district was then on the edge of London, something Contarini had mixed feelings about, describing &quot;Bishopsgate Without&quot; as &quot;…an airy and fashionable area…a little too much
in the country&quot;

In the 1600s, &quot;Bishopsgate Without&quot;, together with neighbouring Bethnal Green and Spitalfields was home to many Huguenot refugees, many of them weavers. In the late 1600s wealthy residents began to migrate to the newly developed areas of West End of London and the character of the area began to change, partly due to the more prosperous parts of the community leaving, and partly to the densification of the area and rapid urbanisation of the neighbouring rural areas.

In time, the East and West Ends of London became more strikingly different in character, writing of the period around 1800, Rev. Richardson commented:

&quot;Bishopsgate Without&quot; was a very densely populated neighbourhood, prior to the opening (1874) and later expansion (1891) of Liverpool Street station, which now dominates the area. The initial opening of the station saw 3,000 residents of Bishopsgate Without evicted and their homes demolished. Around 7,000 people in neighbouring Shoreditch also lost their homes to the railway tracks feeding into the station.

Notable buildings include:
* Broadgate Tower
* Heron Tower
* Liverpool Street station
* Great Eastern Hotel
* Bishopsgate Institute
* Broadgate Estate
* Dirty Dick&#x27;s (a 200 year old pub)
* Bishopsgate Victorian Bath House

===Bishopsgate Within===
&quot;Bishopsgate Within&quot; was originally divided into many parishes, each with its own parish church: St Andrew Undershaft, St Ethelburga Bishopsgate, St Martin Outwich, St Mary Axe and St Helen&#x27;s Bishopsgate, now all amalgamated under the last of these. St Helen&#x27;s is a historic medieval church and former monastic establishment with many ancient funerary monuments and a stained glass window commemorating William Shakespeare, a local parishioner in the early to mid-1590s. The area was well located for Shakespeare, being close to the theatres in Shoreditch where he worked; The Theatre and the Curtain Theatre.

Notable buildings include:
* 99 Bishopsgate
* 100 Bishopsgate
* Tower 42
* 22 Bishopsgate

===Ward boundary changes===

The 1994 (city), 2003 and 2013 (ward) boundary revisions made fundamental changes to the ancient boundaries of the ward. The 1994 changes saw &quot;Bishopsgate Without&quot; (and with it the City of London) gain a large area from the Shoreditch area of the London Borough of Hackney,

The changes made in 2003 and 2013 shifted land between wards of the city. The effect of this was to transfer nearly all of &quot;Bishopsgate Within&quot; (except for a small area surrounding the Leathersellers&#x27; livery hall) to other wards. The ward previously extended much further south, along the Bishopsgate road and Gracechurch Street. At this time &quot;Bishopsgate Without&quot; lost a small block of buildings east Blomfield Street to the Broad Street ward.

There were no changes to Bishopsgate&#x27;s ward boundaries in the 2013 boundary changes.

The revised ward borders the London Borough of Hackney to the north, it neighbours The Portsoken and the borough of Tower Hamlets in the east. The other neighbours are Aldgate (southeast), Coleman Street (west), Cornhill (south-west), Broad Street and Lime Street (south).

===Politics===
Bishopsgate is one of 25 wards in the City of London, each electing an Alderman to the Court of Aldermen, and Commoners (the City equivalent of a councillor) to the Court of Common Council of the City of London Corporation. Only electors who are Freemen of the City of London are eligible to stand. On 15 September 2022 the ward elected Kawsar Zaman as its Alderman. He is only the third non-white Alderman in the city&#x27;s hundreds of years of history, the first British-Bangladeshi ever to hold the office, and the youngest ever elected to the Court of Alderman.

===Street===
The street called Bishopsgate (formerly Bishopsgate Street), which takes its name from the Gate, is the main thoroughfare of the Ward. It is a stretch of the originally Roman Ermine Street (now the A10) between Gracechurch Street and Norton Folgate, taking the name Bishopsgate only within the historical area of the ward.

Although it takes its name from the gate, the road pre-dates the building of the London Wall which was built in the late second or early third centuries. Ermine Street (sometimes called the Old North Road) connected London to Cambridge, Lincoln, York and other towns and cities.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
In the Roman period it was illegal to bury the dead within the city, so cemeteries were established outside the city gates. There were large burial grounds outside Bishopsgate, on both side of Ermine Street.

The wards of London appear to have taken shape in the 11th century, before the Norman Conquest. Their administrative, judicial and military purpose made them equivalent to hundreds in the countryside. The primary purpose of wards like Bishopsgate, which included a gate, appears to be the defence of the gate, as gates were the weakest points in any fortification.

The earliest origins of the wards reach back further than the 11th century but their emergence and evolution is uncertain and any narrative conjectural. The ward may have developed from the &quot;Soke of Bishopsgate&quot;, a set of rights, and possibly land, held by the Bishop of London over an area to the east of the River Walbrook. The Bishop may have been granted the land and rights in order to promote growth in the under-developed part of the city east of the Walbrook. Outside the wall the Walbrook formed the boundary between the Soke of Bishopsgate to the east and the Soke of Cripplegate on the other side of the brook.

Bishopsgate may have originally included the area that subsequently became known as Lime Street Ward.

The Domesday Survey of 1086 did not cover London, but a landholding called Bishopsgate is recorded nearby; this may have been the property later known as Norton Folgate.

=== Coaching inns ===
Bishopsgate had many coaching inns which accommodated passengers setting out on the originally Roman Ermine Street, that issued from the gate. Although they survived the Great Fire of London, they have now all been demolished. These included the Angel, the Black Bull, the Dolphin, the Flower Pot, the Green Dragon, the Magpie and Punchbowl, the White Hart and the Wrestlers. The Black Bull was a venue for the Queen&#x27;s Men theatrical troupe in the 16th century. The English politician Anthony Bacon moved nearby with his mother in May 1594 and she complained about the plays and interludes at the Bull which might &quot;corrupt his servants&quot;.

An inn called the Catherine Wheel (demolished 1911) is commemorated by Catherine Wheel Alley which leads off Bishopsgate to the east. The 17th century façade of Sir Paul Pindar&#x27;s House on Bishopsgate, demolished, with many other old buildings, for the expansion of Liverpool Street railway station in 1890, was also preserved and can now be seen in the Victoria and Albert Museum. In the 18th century this grand residence became a tavern called Sir Paul Pindar&#x27;s Head; another notable venue was the London Tavern (1768–1876). Also demolished (but then re-erected in Chelsea in 1910) was the old Crosby Hall, at one time the residence of Richard III and Thomas More.

=== Bishopsgate Mutiny ===
In 1649, during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, Colonel Whalley&#x27;s Regiment, a parliamentary unit, was stationed in Bishopsgate Ward, helping to protect London from Royalists. The Bishopsgate mutiny occurred when soldiers of the regiment, mutinied against parliament - partly due to their radical Leveller sympathies. A surrender was eventually negotiated, but Robert Lockyer a parishioner of &quot;Bishopsgate Without&quot; as well as a soldier in the regiment, was executed as a ringleader.

=== &quot;Communist Manifesto&quot; ===
&quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot; was first printed, anonymously and in German, by the Workers Educational Association at 46 Liverpool Street in Bishopsgate Without in 1848.

=== Terrorist attack ===
On 24 April 1993, it was the site of an IRA truck bombing which killed journalist Ed Henty, injured over 40 people and caused £1 billion worth of damage, including the destruction of St Ethelburga&#x27;s church and damage to the NatWest Tower and Liverpool Street station. Police had received a coded warning, but were still evacuating the area at the time of the explosion. The area had already suffered damage from the Baltic Exchange bombing one year before.

St Ethelburga&#x27;s was rebuilt, functioning not just as a church but also as home to the St Ethelburga&#x27;s Centre for Reconciliation and Peace charity.

<doc id="380837" wikidata="Q1787950" url="?curid=380837" title="River Ravensbourne">
<text>The River Ravensbourne is a tributary of the River Thames in south London, England. It flows north from near Bromley into the tidal River Thames at Deptford, where its tidal reach is known as Deptford Creek.

== Geography ==
The Ravensbourne is 11 miles (17 km) in length with a total catchment area of 180 km2. It flows through the London Boroughs of Bromley, Lewisham and Greenwich.

The Ravensbourne rises at Caesar&#x27;s Well, Keston, four miles south of Bromley town centre, and flows initially in a northerly direction. For the initial third of its length, the river flows across common land (including Hayes Common and Bromley Common) until it reaches the southern outskirts of Bromley town. There it is joined by the Ravensbourne South Branch and the Ravensbourne East Branch, which substantially increase the flow.

The Ravensbourne then flows northwards alongside the A21, passing below Bromley town centre through Church Gardens and Glassmill Reservoir, then on into Beckenham Place Park, the last semi-natural reach of the river. Further north, it passes through Ladywell Fields, where considerable restoration work has been taking place since 2007/08, with the removal of a long stretch of 1980&#x27;s concrete channeling, re-routing to more closely match its natural course, and the introduction of terraces and submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) to provide animal habitat and improve flood control.

North of Ladywell Fields, passing to the east of Ladywell station, it continues under Lewisham, passing west of the Lewisham Shopping Centre and forming the boundary of the Cornmill Gardens playground. It flows to the east of Lewisham station, and then flows north into Deptford, forming the northeastern border of Brookmill Park. The Docklands Light Railway closely follows this stretch from Lewisham to Greenwich, as the river is crossed by the A2 and then widens north of Deptford Bridge station into its tidal reach, where it is named Deptford Creek.

Its confluence with the Thames is in Greenwich Reach, north-east of Deptford town centre and west of Greenwich.

=== Tributaries ===
South of Bellingham, the small Spring Brook joins the Ravensbourne after flowing only about one mile (1.6 km) from the east through Plaistow and Downham; it crosses the borough boundary from Bromley to Lewisham and follows a narrow strip of parkland named Shaftesbury Park Recreation Ground and Downham Playing Fields along its short course.

Just above Catford the Ravensbourne is joined by the River Pool. The Ravensbourne is also joined by the River Quaggy (known upstream of Sundridge Park as Kyd Brook, and 3.5 miles (5.6 km) in length). This rises near Princess Royal University Hospital at Locksbottom then flows north through Petts Wood to Sundridge Park in Bromley where its name changes to the River Quaggy. It then flows northwards through the Mottingham area to Kidbrooke where it then turns westwards through Manor Park in Lee, before joining the Ravensbourne at Loampit Vale in Lewisham.

Numerous other small streams and surface water outfalls join the main river between its source and confluence. Until the 19th century one such stream flowed from Brockley Cross crossing Tanners Hill before joining at Deptford Creek.

== Etymology ==
The earliest documented name is &quot;Randesbourne&quot; in 1360, then &quot;Rendesburne&quot; in 1372, &quot;Randysborne&quot; in 1516 and &quot;Ravensburn&quot; in 1575. The later spelling of &quot;Ravensbourne&quot; is thus due to folk etymology, and the likely meaning is &#x27;boundary stream&#x27;, from Old English &quot;rand&quot; and &quot;burna&quot;. In its ten-mile course, the Ravensbourne forms the boundary between several sets of parishes.

== History ==
The Domesday Book recorded eleven corn mills on the Ravensbourne in the 11th century. The 17th century London diarist John Evelyn bought one of these mills – Brookmills – in 1668 for &quot;grinding colour&quot; from the Beecher family. It was later used by the Kent Waterworks company. It was finally demolished in the 1850s.

The bridge over Deptford Creek was the site of the Battle of Deptford Bridge, 17 June 1497, the last battle of the Cornish Rebellion of 1497.

From the 16th century onwards until its closure in the 19th century, the proximity of Deptford Dockyard, a Royal Dockyard created by Henry VIII, gave employment to many small shipbuilders on the creek. Queen Elizabeth I knighted Francis Drake on board the &quot;Golden Hind&quot; in Deptford Creek on Drake&#x27;s return from his circumnavigation of the globe in 1580. The &quot;Golden Hind&quot; remained moored in the creek until it broke up.
Deptford Creek was also host to a large power station, now dismantled, as well as other heavy industries. Now regeneration of the area is under way. For much of the lower reach between Lewisham and the Thames, the Ravensbourne (and Deptford Creek) is joined by the Docklands Light Railway. Indeed, the channel was diverted in Brookmill Park so that the DLR could run along the route of the river. A new bend in the river was constructed that gave more natural banks and created a better habitat for flora and fauna.

Just south of the DLR&#x27;s final northern crossing of the river, on the eastern bank, is Deptford pumping station, constructed in the 1860s as part of the London sewerage system. There are also a number of new developments, including the Laban Dance Centre and apartment blocks at the mouth of the creek alongside the Thames, approximately 0.5 km west of Greenwich town centre.

Between 1974 and 1997, the name of the river was used for the Ravensbourne parliamentary constituency within the London Borough of Bromley. It also gives its name to a railway station.

Every year on 1 May at 5.32am, the Ravensbourne Morris Men dance up the Beltaine Sunrise at Caesars Well, the source of the Ravensbourne River.

<doc id="380838" wikidata="Q1669574" url="?curid=380838" title="Metropolitan Borough of Westminster">
<text>The Metropolitan Borough of Westminster was a metropolitan borough in the County of London, England, from 1900 to 1965.

==City status==
By royal charter dated 29 October 1900, the borough was granted the title City of Westminster. Westminster had originally been created a city and seat of the short-lived Diocese of Westminster in 1541. The diocese was suppressed in 1550, but the area was still known as a &quot;city&quot;, although without official sanction.

==Arms and motto==
The arms of Westminster represent two monarchs, closely associated with the City. Edward the Confessor, who rebuilt the church of St Peter (Westminster Abbey), and Henry VII, who added a chapel, within the Abbey. The portcullis and rose emblems are derived from the Tudor dynasty, from which Westminster first achieved its status; and they appear throughout many public and religious buildings in Westminster, and the portcullis was adopted by the House of Commons. The supporting lions are adopted from the Cecil family, who have had a long association with the borough. The arms were first granted in 1601.

The motto &quot;Custodi Civitatem Domine&quot;, is translated as &quot;O Lord, watch over the City&quot;.

The arms can still be seen on the Portland stone parapet of the Old City Hall in Charing Cross Road (built in 1890–91 by Robert Walker, replacing an earlier vestry hall). It can also be seen on the entrance to the car park beneath 10 Spring Gardens (home of the British Council) and on Chelsea and Hammersmith Bridges.

==Formation and boundaries==
It consisted of the area that is now part of the City of Westminster and south of Oxford Street and Bayswater Road. It included Soho, Mayfair, St. James&#x27;s, The Strand, Westminster, Pimlico, Belgravia, and Hyde Park.

The borough was formed from eleven civil parishes and extra-parochial places: Close of the Collegiate Church of St Peter, Liberty of the Rolls, Precinct of the Savoy, St Anne Soho, St Clement Danes, St George Hanover Square, St James Piccadilly, St Martin in the Fields, St Mary-le-Strand, St Paul Covent Garden and Westminster St Margaret and St John. These eleven were combined into a single civil parish called City of Westminster, which was conterminous with the metropolitan borough, in 1922.

Previous to the borough&#x27;s formation it had been administered by five separate local bodies: the Vestry of St George Hanover Square, the Vestry of St Martin in the Fields, Strand District Board of Works, Westminster District Board of Works and the Vestry of Westminster St James. The Close of the Collegiate Church of St Peter had not been under the control of any local authority prior to 1900.

==Population and area==
The borough covered . The population recorded in the Census was:

Constituent parishes 1801–1899

Metropolitan Borough 1900–1961
==Politics==

The borough was divided into fourteen wards for elections: Charing Cross, Conduit, Covent Garden, Great Marlborough, Grosvenor, Hamlet of Knightsbridge, Knightsbridge St George&#x27;s, Pall Mall, Regent, St Anne, St John, St Margaret, Strand and Victoria.

===Borough council===

===Parliament constituency===
For elections to Parliament, the borough was divided into three constituencies:
*St George&#x27;s, Hanover Square
*Strand
*Westminster
In 1918 the borough&#x27;s representation was reduced to two seats:
*Westminster Abbey
*Westminster St George&#x27;s
In 1950 the borough&#x27;s representation was reduced to half a seat, when it was merged with the City of London:
*Cities of London and Westminster

==Poor law==
The parishes which made up the borough were within the St George&#x27;s, Strand and Westminster unions. The unions were amalgamated in 1913 to form the City of Westminster Union. The parishes and unions were then abolished in 1922 and replaced with a single City of Westminster parish for poor law purposes. The parish continued to exist until 1965, but ceased to have any role in the administration of the poor law in 1930 when responsibility transferred to the London County Council.

==Replacement==
It was abolished in 1965 and its area became part of the City of Westminster along with the Metropolitan Borough of Paddington and the Metropolitan Borough of St Marylebone.

<doc id="380839" wikidata="Q1934233" url="?curid=380839" title="Walsh function">
<text>In mathematics, more specifically in harmonic analysis, Walsh functions form a complete orthogonal set of functions that can be used to represent any discrete function—just like trigonometric functions can be used to represent any continuous function in Fourier analysis. They can thus be viewed as a discrete, digital counterpart of the continuous, analog system of trigonometric functions on the unit interval. But unlike the sine and cosine functions, which are continuous, Walsh functions are piecewise constant. They take the values −1 and +1 only, on sub-intervals defined by dyadic fractions.

The system of Walsh functions is known as the Walsh system. It is an extension of the Rademacher system of orthogonal functions.

Walsh functions, the Walsh system, the Walsh series, and the fast Walsh–Hadamard transform are all named after the American mathematician Joseph L. Walsh. They find various applications in physics and engineering when analyzing digital signals.

Historically, various numerations of Walsh functions have been used; none of them is particularly superior to another. This articles uses the &quot;Walsh–Paley numeration&quot;.

==Definition==

We define the sequence of Walsh functions formula_1, formula_2 as follows.

For any natural number &quot;k&quot;, and real number formula_3, let

:formula_4 be the &quot;j&quot;th bit in the binary representation of &quot;k&quot;, starting with formula_5 as the least significant bit, and

:formula_6 be the &quot;j&quot;th bit in the fractional binary representation of formula_7, starting with formula_8 as the most significant fractional bit.

Then, by definition

:formula_9

In particular, formula_10 everywhere on the interval, since all bits of &quot;k&quot; are zero.

Notice that formula_11 is precisely the Rademacher function &quot;rm&quot;.
Thus, the Rademacher system is a subsystem of the Walsh system. Moreover, every Walsh function is a product of Rademacher functions:

:formula_12

==Comparison between Walsh functions and trigonometric functions==

Walsh functions and trigonometric functions are both systems that form a complete, orthonormal set of functions, an orthonormal basis in the Hilbert space formula_13 of the square-integrable functions on the unit interval. Both are systems of bounded functions, unlike, say, the Haar system or the Franklin system.

Both trigonometric and Walsh systems admit natural extension by periodicity from the unit interval to the real line. Furthermore, both Fourier analysis on the unit interval (Fourier series) and on the real line (Fourier transform) have their digital counterparts defined via Walsh system, the Walsh series analogous to the Fourier series, and the Hadamard transform analogous to the Fourier transform.

==Properties==

The Walsh system formula_14 is an abelian multiplicative discrete group isomorphic to formula_15, the Pontryagin dual of the Cantor group formula_16. Its identity is formula_17, and every element is of order two (that is, self-inverse).

The Walsh system is an orthonormal basis of the Hilbert space formula_13. Orthonormality means

:formula_19,

and being a basis means that if, for every formula_20, we set formula_21 then

:formula_22

It turns out that for every formula_20, the series formula_24 converges to formula_25 for almost every formula_3.

The Walsh system (in Walsh-Paley numeration) forms a Schauder basis in formula_27,   formula_28. Note that, unlike the Haar system, and like the trigonometric system, this basis is not unconditional, nor is the system a Schauder basis in formula_29.

==Generalizations==

===Walsh-Ferleger systems===

Let formula_30 be the compact Cantor group endowed with Haar measure and let formula_31 be its discrete group of characters. Elements of formula_32 are readily identified with Walsh functions. Of course, the characters are defined on formula_33 while Walsh functions are defined on the unit interval, but since there exists a modulo zero isomorphism between these measure spaces, measurable functions on them are identified via isometry.

Then basic representation theory suggests the following broad generalization of the concept of Walsh system.

For an arbitrary Banach space formula_34 let formula_35 be a strongly continuous, uniformly bounded faithful action of formula_36 on &quot;X&quot;. For every formula_37, consider its eigenspace formula_38. Then &quot;X&quot; is the closed linear span of the eigenspaces: formula_39. Assume that every eigenspace is one-dimensional and pick an element formula_40 such that formula_41. Then the system formula_42, or the same system in the Walsh-Paley numeration of the characters formula_43 is called generalized Walsh system associated with action formula_44. Classical Walsh system becomes a special case, namely, for

:formula_45

where formula_46 is addition modulo 2.

In the early 1990s, Serge Ferleger and Fyodor Sukochev showed that in a broad class of Banach spaces (so called &quot;UMD&quot; spaces) generalized Walsh systems have many properties similar to the classical one: they form a Schauder basis and a uniform finite-dimensional decomposition in the space, have property of random unconditional convergence.
One important example of generalized Walsh system is Fermion Walsh system in non-commutative &quot;L&quot;p spaces associated with hyperfinite type II factor.

===Fermion Walsh system===

The Fermion Walsh system is a non-commutative, or &quot;quantum&quot; analog of the classical Walsh system. Unlike the latter, it consists of operators, not functions. Nevertheless, both systems share many important properties, e.g., both form an orthonormal basis in corresponding Hilbert space, or Schauder basis in corresponding symmetric spaces. Elements of the Fermion Walsh system are called &quot;Walsh operators&quot;.

The term &quot;Fermion&quot; in the name of the system is explained by the fact that the enveloping operator space, the so-called hyperfinite type II factor formula_47, may be viewed as the space of &quot;observables&quot; of the system of countably infinite number of distinct spin formula_48 fermions. Each Rademacher operator acts on one particular fermion coordinate only, and there it is a Pauli matrix. It may be identified with the observable measuring spin component of that fermion along one of the axes formula_49 in spin space. Thus, a Walsh operator measures the spin of a subset of fermions, each along its own axis.

===Vilenkin system===

Fix a sequence formula_50 of integers with formula_51 and let formula_52 endowed with the product topology and the normalized Haar measure. Define formula_53 and formula_54. Each formula_55 can be associated with the real number

:formula_56

This correspondence is a module zero isomorphism between formula_57 and the unit interval. It also defines a norm which generates the topology of formula_57. For formula_59, let formula_60 where

:formula_61

The set formula_62 is called &quot;generalized Rademacher system&quot;. The Vilenkin system is the group formula_63 of (complex-valued) characters of formula_57, which are all finite products of formula_62. For each non-negative integer formula_66 there is a unique sequence formula_67 such that formula_68 and

:formula_69

Then formula_70 where

:formula_71

In particular, if formula_72, then formula_57 is the Cantor group and formula_74 is the (real-valued) Walsh-Paley system.

The Vilenkin system is a complete orthonormal system on formula_75 and forms a Schauder basis in formula_76,  formula_28.

===Nonlinear Phase Extensions===
Nonlinear phase extensions of discrete Walsh-Hadamard transform were developed. It was shown that the nonlinear phase basis functions with improved cross-correlation properties significantly outperform the traditional Walsh codes in code division multiple access (CDMA) communications.

==Applications==

Applications of the Walsh functions can be found wherever digit representations are used, including speech recognition, medical and biological image processing, and digital holography.

For example, the fast Walsh–Hadamard transform (FWHT) may be used in the analysis of digital quasi-Monte Carlo methods. In radio astronomy, Walsh functions can help reduce the effects of electrical crosstalk between antenna signals. They are also used in passive LCD panels as X and Y binary driving waveforms where the autocorrelation between X and Y can be made minimal for pixels that are off.

<text>QI (Quite Interesting) is a British comedy panel game quiz show for television created and co-produced by John Lloyd. The series currently airs on BBC Two and is presented by Sandi Toksvig. It features permanent panellist Alan Davies and three guest panellists per episode; the panellists are mostly comedians. The series was presented by Stephen Fry from its beginning in 2003 until 2016.

The format of the show focuses on the panellists answering questions that are extremely obscure, making it unlikely that the correct answer will be given. To compensate, the panellists are awarded points not only for the correct answer, but also for interesting ones, regardless of whether they are correct or even relate to the original question, while points are deducted for &quot;answers which are not only wrong, but pathetically obvious&quot; – typically answers that are generally believed to be true but in fact are misconceptions. These answers, referred to as &quot;forfeits&quot;, are usually indicated by a loud klaxon and alarm bell, flashing lights, and the incorrect answer being flashed on the video screens behind the panellists. Bonus points are sometimes awarded or deducted for challenges or incorrect references, varying from show to show. &quot;QI&quot; has a philosophy that &quot;everything is interesting if looked at in the right way&quot;. Many factual errors in the show have been corrected in later episodes or on the show&#x27;s blog.

For its first five series shown between 2003 and 2007, episodes premiered on BBC Four before receiving their first analogue airing on BBC Two a week later. From 2008 to 2011, the show was moved to BBC One, with an extended-length edition of each episode often broadcast on BBC Two a day or two after the regular show&#x27;s broadcast under the title of &quot;QI XL&quot;. Series G and H saw the regular show broadcast in a pre-watershed slot with the extended edition remaining within a post-watershed slot. Beginning with the I series, the regular show returned to a post-watershed slot on BBC Two. Syndicated episodes of previous series are regularly shown on Dave. In November 2020, a new compilation series titled &quot;QI XS&quot; started, with a run-time of 14 minutes per episode. A second series of XS, with an 8-minute running time, started in February 2023. Series of &quot;QI&quot; are assigned letters in sequence and episodes are themed around topics starting with that letter.

The show has received very positive ratings from critics and has been nominated for multiple awards; &quot;QI&quot; itself has the highest viewing figures for any show broadcast on BBC Two and Dave. Several books, DVDs and other tie-ins to the show have been released, and international versions of &quot;QI&quot; have been made in other countries.

==Format and concept==
The panel consists of four participants: three rotating guests and one regular, Alan Davies, who has the seat to the immediate right of the host. Davies has appeared in every episode. However, in &quot;Divination&quot; he was not able to appear at the studio; he was still able to play &quot;from beyond&quot;. Despite frequent wins, Davies often finishes last due to incurring forfeits.

Questions posed to the panellists are often misleading, obscure, or very difficult. Providing an &quot;obvious but wrong&quot; answer (referred to as a &quot;forfeit&quot;) results in a sequence of klaxons, alarm bells, flashing lights, and a score penalty. Davies is often the panellist who gives these answers. In the first two series, Fry produced the given answer on a card to show the panellists, while it also flashed on the large screens behind them (except in the pilot episode and the first show of the first series, when only the cards were used). Starting in the third series, Fry&#x27;s answer cards were dispensed with altogether, leaving only the screens as proof that such answers had been predicted.

Because the show&#x27;s creators expected that hardly anyone would be able to give a correct answer without significant prompting, they instead encourage sheer &quot;interestingness&quot;, which is how points are mainly scored. As such, tangential discussions are encouraged, and panellists are apt to branch off into frivolous conversations, give voice to trains of thought, and share humorous anecdotes from their own lives. The number of points given and taken away are normally decided by the host or beforehand by &quot;QI&quot; researchers known as &quot;The &quot;QI&quot; Elves&quot;. For example, in one episode Davies was docked 10 points for suggesting &quot;oxygen&quot; to the question &quot;What is the main ingredient of air?&quot;

Negative scores are common, and occasionally even the victor&#x27;s score may be negative. Score totals are announced at the conclusion of the show. Fry has said, &quot;I think we all agree that nobody in this universe understands QI&#x27;s scoring system.&quot; John Lloyd, &quot;QI&quot;″s creator, has, on one occasion, admitted that not even he has any idea how the scoring system works, but there is someone who is paid to check on the scores. According to the Series A DVD, guests are allowed the right of appeal if they believe their score is wrong, but none has so far exercised that right.

===Buzzers===
Panellists are given buzzers to use in signalling a response, each of which produces a different sound when pressed. For the first three series, the sounds were seemingly random things or followed an arbitrary theme in each episode, such as commonly heard everyday sounds in the Series C episode &quot;Common Knowledge.&quot; From Series D onward, all four sounds are based on the particular episode&#x27;s theme, such as in the Series F episode &quot;Films and Fame&quot; (sound clips associated with well-known movies, with Davies receiving Porky Pig&#x27;s stuttering &quot;That&#x27;s all, folks!&quot;). The buzzers are always demonstrated at the beginning of the programme, but are usually given a shortened version for repeated use during the episode, mostly in General Ignorance. Davies &quot;always gets the most demeaning sound&quot; for his buzzer.

Sometimes, the buzzers have unique points to them, such as having questions based on them; in most cases they are about Davies&#x27; own. For example, one of his buzzer noises in the Series D episode &quot;Descendants&quot; sounded like a Clanger, and the panel had to try and guess what was being said, while in the Series F episode &quot;Fakes and Frauds&quot;, all the buzzers sounded like ordinary household objects, but three turned out to be the sound of the superb lyrebird mimicking the noises. In other episodes, they were sometimes changed to suit the theme of an episode; for the Series D episode &quot;Denial and Deprivation&quot;, the panellists had to use unique buzzers – two had bells, one flicked a ruler over the edge of a school desk, and Davies squeezed a toy chipmunk – while in the Series G episode &quot;Green&quot;, the buzzers were replaced with whistles so the show could be seen to be eco-friendly. On one occasion, points were automatically deducted from Davies&#x27; score solely because the buzzer did not match the theme of the episode, or activated the Klaxon.

===General Ignorance===

In a parody of ubiquitous general knowledge quizzes, the final round is off-topic and called &quot;General Ignorance&quot;. It focuses on seemingly easy questions which have widely believed but wrong answers. Whereas in the main rounds of the show, the panellists&#x27; buzzer usage is not usually enforced, the &quot;General Ignorance&quot; questions are introduced by the host&#x27;s reminder to keep &quot;fingers on buzzers&quot;. &quot;General Ignorance&quot; was featured in every episode until the I (ninth) series, but featured only occasionally in the J (tenth) and K (eleventh) series before appearing regularly again in the L (twelfth) series. Due to the large number of &quot;obvious but wrong&quot; answers, panellists—especially Davies—usually incur the greatest point losses in this round.

===Tasks and themes===

In a number of episodes, either the set, the panellists&#x27; clothing, the opening theme, or a mixture of all, are changed to match the episode&#x27;s theme. For example, in &quot;Denial and Deprivation&quot;, the set was replaced with an auctioneer stand for Fry and school desks or side tables for the panellists, and the lighting was stripped down; while in &quot;Health and Safety&quot;, the panellists wore hard hats, safety glasses, and bright yellow work vests and Fry wore a doctor&#x27;s white coat and stethoscope.

In some episodes, an extra task is given to the panellists to complete during the course of an episode, which can earn them extra points. Such tasks have included a drawing contest, or spotting an item on the video screens and waving a &quot;joker&quot; card (e.g. Cuttlefish.) Several series have had a recurring task spanning every episode, often involving the use of a joker card to respond to a question whose answer fit a specified theme. Examples include &quot;The Elephant in the Room&quot; (series E, elephants), &quot;Nobody Knows&quot; (Series I, for questions without a known answer) and &quot;Spend a Penny&quot; (Series L, lavatories).

In addition to assigning tasks, Fry performed scientific experiments or demonstrations during certain episodes. He often did so once an episode in the J, K and L series, where they were called &quot;Jolly Japes&quot;, &quot;Knick-Knakes&quot; and &quot;Lab Larks&quot;, respectively, and usually occurred towards the end of the episode. Such experiments either used simple objects, various chemical compounds, odd contraptions, or a mixture of all. If an experiment&#x27;s outcome was too fast to be seen, a short &quot;replay&quot; of it was shown, (sometimes with multiple angles) to reveal precisely what happened.

==Production==
Writer and former BBC producer John Lloyd devised the format of the show, and it is produced by Quite Interesting Limited, an organisation set up by Lloyd. &quot;QI&quot; was originally seen as being an &quot;Annotated Encyclopædia Britannica ... the world&#x27;s first non-boring encyclopaedia.&quot; As a panel game, it was conceived as a radio show, with Lloyd as chairman. While developing the show with Peter Fincham and Alan Yentob, Lloyd decided that it would work better on television. The three pitched it to Lorraine Heggessey, controller of BBC One at the time. Heggessey passed on the format, opting to commission a similar panel game called &quot;Class War&quot;, which was never made. When Fincham became controller of BBC One, Lloyd pitched it to him, only to be turned down by his former collaborator. Eventually, he pitched it to Jane Root, then controller of BBC Two, who agreed to develop it. When it was decided that the show would air on television, Michael Palin was offered the job of chairman with Fry and Davies as captains of the &quot;cleverclogs&quot; and &quot;dunderheads&quot; teams, respectively. However, when Palin decided not to take the job, the producers opted to change the format; Fry became the host, with Davies as the only regular panellist. Root commissioned a pilot and a further 16 episodes after that, although budget limitations reduced the first series to 12 episodes.
In October 2015, it was announced that Fry would be stepping down as host after Series M and would be replaced by Sandi Toksvig. Fry described his position on &quot;QI&quot; as &quot;one of the best jobs on television&quot;, but that &quot;it was time to move on&quot;. According to Alan Davies, Fry quit because the BBC cut the budget, so that three shows had to be recorded on the same day. &quot;For budget reasons, they ended up making him do three shows in 24 hours&quot;, Davies said. Toksvig said that &quot;&quot;QI&quot; is my favourite television programme both to watch and to be on&quot;. Lloyd said that Toksvig will be &quot;the first female host of a mainstream comedy panel show on British television&quot;, and that although she is very different from Fry, she &quot;will bring to the show the same kind of wonderful thing that Stephen does, the mixture of real brains and a hinterland of knowledge, plus this naughty sense of humour.&quot; He also said it will give the show a chance to &quot;do things in a slightly different way&quot;.

===Recording===
Recordings usually take place over a few weeks in May or June; three episodes are typically filmed per week and sixteen are filmed for each series. Series A–P were filmed at The London Studios, with Series Q onwards being filmed at Television Centre.

In the morning on the day of recording, the studio has to be set up. Seven cameras are used to record &quot;QI&quot;. To check that images, forfeits, buzzers and lighting are working, the first technical rehearsal is hosted by floor manager Guy Smart with stand-ins for panellists. Fry, who was given the list of questions roughly an hour beforehand, hosted the second technical rehearsal at 2:00 pm. Guests may have time to practise with a set of warm-up questions.

For earlier series, warm-up comedians were used before recording began, frequently Stephen Grant, credited as the &quot;audience wrangler&quot;. However, there have been no warm-ups for recent series. Fry recorded and tweeted audience AudioBooms and introduced the guests before the show. Recordings start at either 4:30 pm or 7:30 pm and last up to two hours, although only 30 minutes of footage is used for normal episodes and 45 minutes for &quot;XL&quot; episodes. By 10:00 pm, recording has usually finished and the set has been disassembled. Roughly 16 questions are asked and about half of those make it into the show; about 20% of material researched is used in a &quot;QI&quot; episode, while other facts may appear in the XL versions, a &quot;QI&quot; book, on &quot;QI&quot;″s Twitter feed or on their website.

In March 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, two episodes of series R were filmed without an audience, due to social distancing requirements. Further series R episodes were recorded with a virtual audience via Zoom.

===Questions seen beforehand===
The makers of the show insist that the answers are not given to the panellists beforehand. The host is given a list of questions about an hour before the show, for preparatory purposes, but the guests are forbidden to ask for preparatory materials or other help. Alan Davies never does any preparation.

In a 2010 interview with the &quot;Radio Times&quot; regarding the current state of the BBC, Fry revealed that one of the regular panellists insisted on seeing the questions before they appear in the show. 
&quot;There&#x27;s only one regular guest who always insists on seeing the questions beforehand and prepares for them. I won&#x27;t tell you his or her name,&quot; he said. &quot;It really annoys me. In fact, one day, I&#x27;ll make sure that person is given a list from another programme because they don&#x27;t need them.&quot;

Following this comment, people asked Fry to identify the guest and some posted their own speculations. Fry later posted on his Twitter account that it was neither Davies nor Rob Brydon. In a 2022 Q&amp;A at the Oxford Union, regular panellist Dara Ó Briain said that the guest in question was someone who had since died, but was not Sean Lock.

===Research===
The research for the show is mostly carried out by seven people called the &quot;&quot;QI&quot; Elves&quot;, a team which has included Justin Pollard, Vitali Vitaliev, Molly Oldfield (daughter of Mike Oldfield), Stevyn Colgan and Jenny Ryan. The &quot;elves&quot; devise the questions for the show, and one is on set during filming who is able to communicate with the host during the show to provide and correct information. Other people involved in researching questions and compiling the scripts are John Mitchinson and Piers Fletcher, known (along with Justin Pollard, Molly Oldfield, and James Harkin) as the &quot;Question Wranglers&quot;, whose research uses both &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; and &quot;Wikipedia&quot;. The &quot;QI&quot; website also has a forum.

A &quot;QI&quot; Elves podcast, &quot;No Such Thing as a Fish&quot;, began on 8 March 2014. The title is taken from an entry into the &quot;Oxford Encyclopedia of Underwater Life&quot; (although in the opening theme of the first 41 episodes it is incorrectly referenced as the &quot;Oxford &#x27;Dictionary&#x27; of Underwater Life&quot;), which was used on the show. The audio from the first episode in which they discuss how they found this fact is used as an introduction. Regular elves are Anna Ptaszynski, James Harkin, Dan Schreiber, and Andrew Hunter Murray, with occasional appearances from Alex Bell and Anne Miller. Schreiber is the host of the show. Its theme song is &quot;Wasps&quot; from the band Emperor Yes, which is based on a fact about bees which was used on &quot;QI&quot;. The song is written as an exchange between the bees, as they defend their hive from attacking wasps by swarming the wasp, and using their body heat to kill the wasps by overheating. A TV show entitled &quot;No Such Thing as the News&quot; aired for two seasons in 2016, following a similar format based around news stories and current events. In 2018, an online behind the scenes series that followed the podcasters on their UK tour was released called &#x27;Behind The Gills&#x27;.

==Episodes==

In &quot;QI&quot;, every series takes its theme from a different letter of the alphabet, starting with the letter &quot;A&quot;. Series are referred to by letter rather than number. The first series started on 11 September 2003, and consisted of topics beginning with &quot;A&quot;. The second series consisted of topics beginning with &quot;B&quot; and also saw the first attempts to pay attention to a particular theme throughout one episode, e.g. &quot;Birds&quot; (the over-riding theme did not necessarily begin with &quot;B&quot;, although the questions always contained an element that did). The only exceptions to the alphabet system have been the Christmas specials, where the topics are often Christmas-based and do not necessarily correspond to that series&#x27; letter (although greater attempts have been made to do so since Series D).

Series D was the first to see all the episodes focus upon a single topic or theme, beginning with the series letter (e.g. Danger), and for each to be given an official title connected to the topic/theme. It also saw Fry modify his introduction of the panellists, by incorporating the theme/topic of the episode, with Davies often getting the &quot;demeaning&quot; introduction. This trend has continued with each subsequent series; episodes from previous series were retroactively given titles. A video podcast (featuring the best moments with some out-takes) was planned to accompany Series E, but this was instead turned into a set of &quot;Quickies&quot; featured on the &quot;QI&quot; homepage of the BBC&#x27;s website. As this decision was not reached until after recording, the videos are still referred to as &quot;vodcasts&quot; by whoever is introducing them (usually Fry but occasionally a panellist or even the audience.) The series was ended by a special outtake compilation entitled &quot;Elephants&quot;.

Points may be given to (or taken from) the studio audience, and six episodes have the distinction of being won by the audience: &quot;Death&quot;, the fifth episode in Series D; &quot;England&quot;, the 10th episode in Series E; &quot;Flora &amp; Fauna&quot;, the 10th episode in Series F; &quot;Greeks&quot;, the 14th episode in Series G; &quot;Next&quot;, the 15th episode in Series N; and &quot;Quantity and Quality&quot;, the 15th episode in Series Q. The audience&#x27;s win in &quot;Greeks&quot; was only announced during the XL broadcast as their contribution was cut out of the main broadcast. In contrast, the audience lost the fifth episode of Series E, &quot;Europe&quot;, receiving a forfeit of −100 when they incorrectly sang the first stanza of the German national anthem, and the fourth episode of Series Q, “Queasy Quacks”, when they received a forfeit for referring to the first patient in a disease outbreak as Patient Zero. Several others have scored points in certain episodes by making appearances on the set or screens; these have included ASIMO (a humanoid robot) and US President Barack Obama.

A special stand-alone episode was filmed between 1:00 and 2:00 a.m. (GMT) on 6 March 2011 as part of Comic Relief&#x27;s special &quot;24 Hour Panel People&quot; featuring David Walliams, who appeared in various old and new panel game shows throughout a 24-hour period. The shows were streamed live on the Red Nose Day website, and parts of each show were shown during five half-hour specials on Comic Relief. The &quot;QI&quot; episode featured panellists Sue Perkins, Jo Brand, Russell Tovey and David Walliams. Davies admitted through Twitter that he was asked to host the episode when it was not certain if Fry would be available, but Davies declined. Once Fry confirmed his participation, Davies did not hear back from the production team. Unlike the classic format of the show where most questions follow a subject, this episode was instead an hour-long General Ignorance round.

==International broadcasts==
As of 2011, &quot;QI&quot; is distributed by Fremantle.

In Australia, &quot;QI&quot; is broadcast on the ABC. The programme was first broadcast on 20 October 2009 after the surprise ratings success of &quot;Stephen Fry in America&quot;. The ABC aired &quot;QI&quot; Series F first, but subsequently, in July 2010, ABC1 began broadcasting &quot;QI&quot; from the very beginning with Series A. &quot;QI&quot; has also been broadcast on the pay TV channel UKTV.

In March 2010, &quot;QI&quot; began a run in New Zealand on Prime. This was also aired on BBC UKTV in New Zealand. On 27 May 2011, Series A of &quot;QI&quot; was broadcast in South Africa on BBC Entertainment. &quot;QI&quot; series A-Q has also aired on BBC Entertainment in the Nordic countries.

There have been several attempts to broadcast &quot;QI&quot; in the United States. US networks that have tried to broadcast the series include Comedy Central, PBS, Discovery Channel and BBC America. Show creator and producer John Lloyd said that one factor in the failure to get the show broadcast is due to the cost. As &quot;QI&quot; features several images during each episode there are copyright issues. Lloyd said in an interview with TV Squad that: &quot;No country in the world has bought the original show and this is partly a matter of cost. The pictures in the background of the show are only cleared for UK usage, so until the show is bought by a Stateside TV company and the rights cleared for World, the programme (is) unaffordable by smaller countries.&quot; Amongst the famous names also to express anger over &quot;QI&quot; not being shown in the US include comedian John Hodgman, who appeared as a &quot;fifth guest&quot; in the second episode of Series G. In 2013, &quot;QI&quot; was picked up in the US by the streaming video service Hulu.
On 30 January 2015 BBC America announced that they had acquired &quot;QI&quot; and planned on airing the show, beginning with Series J, on 19 February 2015.

Davies has criticised &quot;QI&quot; being repeated so often, saying &quot;&quot;QI&quot; being in a soup of shows on one of these repeat channels ... completely devalues the brand&quot;. Davies thought the show would gain more viewers when a new series aired if channels made &quot;an audience wait for a couple of months&quot;.

==Versions and spin-offs==
===International versions===
In 2008, the &quot;QI&quot; format was sold to the Dutch broadcaster VARA. Also called &quot;QI&quot;, the Dutch version of the show aired for the first time on 27 December 2008 and was hosted by the writer Arthur Japin with the comedian Thomas van Luyn taking the role of regular panellist. Japin also appeared (in the audience) in a British &quot;QI&quot; episode, &quot;Gothic&quot;, explaining how the name Vincent van Gogh should be pronounced. The Dutch series was discontinued after six episodes.

A Swedish version of &quot;QI&quot; started airing on SVT1 8 September 2012, and was called &quot;Intresseklubben&quot;. Comedian Johan Wester hosted &quot;Intresseklubben&quot;, and Anders Jansson was featured as the regular panellist. A second series covering the letter B started airing in September 2013; Series C was recorded in June 2014 and aired in late 2014, while season D was recorded in June 2015 and started airing in August 2015.

A Danish version of QI, called &quot;Quiz i en hornlygte&quot; aired on DR2 between 2012 and 2013. The show was hosted by Danish comedian Carsten Eskelund. While not directly branded as a Danish version of QI, it maintained some recognisable elements, such as the difficulty of some questions and awarding points for interesting answers as well as negative points for wrong, but widely believed, answers.

The Czech version of &quot;QI&quot; was first broadcast on TV Prima on 14 August 2013. The programme is hosted by Leoš Mareš, with Patrik Hezucký appearing as a guest in every episode.

===&quot;The QI Test&quot;===
The QI Test was a planned spinoff version of &quot;QI&quot; that was to be broadcast on BBC Two. Created by Lloyd, Talkback Thames&#x27; Dave Morely and former QI Commercial Director Justin Gayner, &quot;The QI Test&quot; differed from &quot;QI&quot; in that it would have featured members of the public as contestants instead of comedians and celebrities. It would have been broadcast during the daytime schedules. The pilot was not hosted by Fry and was recorded in November 2009, but a series was never broadcast.

==Mistakes and fact correction==

Some of the answers on the show have been disputed and shown to be incorrect. In Series A, the show claimed that the longest animal in the world was the lion&#x27;s mane jellyfish, but this was later corrected in Series C, saying that the longest animal in the world is the bootlace worm.

Members of the public and members of the &quot;QI&quot; website contact the show to correct information. At the end of the third series, Dara Ó Briain was docked points for having stated, in the previous series, that the triple point of water is zero degrees Celsius, an answer which earned him 2 points at the time. Viewers had written in to say that the triple point of water is in fact 0.01 degrees, and so the 2 points awarded Ó Briain in the previous series were revoked and he received a further deduction of 10 points for &quot;saying a now &quot;obvious answer&quot;&quot;.

Various other retractions are made by the producers of the show on the special features of the DVD releases. The origin of the error may also be explained. For instance, Fry made a mistake when explaining why helium makes your voice higher, in the Series B Christmas special. He claimed that the gas only affected the frequency, but not the pitch, despite them being the same thing; in actuality, the timbre is affected.

Information contributed by a panellist during a discussion, but which has since been found to be false, have also been corrected. In the &quot;Knowledge&quot; episode in Series K it was explained that many facts on the show are later shown to be incorrect. Points were refunded to three panellists who had appeared previously; The largest refund went to Davies, who received in excess of 700 wrongly deducted points. Fry gave some examples of incorrect facts told in previous episodes, such as ones relating to lobster ages, the evolution of giraffe&#x27;s necks and millipede legs.

More recently, the online forum now includes a &quot;QI Qibbles&quot; blog, which aims to rectify further mistakes in the show.

=== Notable examples ===
==== Welsh word for &quot;blue&quot; ====
The error that has attracted the most complaints to date was made in Series B, when it was claimed that the Welsh language has no word for &quot;blue&quot;. In fact, the word is &quot;&quot;. The error was explained on the &quot;Banter&quot; section of the Series B DVD as a mistake on the part of John Lloyd himself (the show&#x27;s producer).

==== Flobbadob ====

An episode in Series B claimed that the language spoken by children&#x27;s TV characters Bill and Ben was called &quot;Flobbadob&quot; and was named after the onomatopoeic phrase that supposed creator Hilda Brabban&#x27;s younger brothers (after whom the characters were named) gave to their bath farts during their early childhood. However, in Series D, Fry read out the following letter written by Silas Hawkins, the son of veteran voice-over talent Peter Hawkins, who provided the original voices of the characters:

The fart-in-the-bath story was trotted out last year in an episode of Stephen Fry&#x27;s otherwise admirable quiz show &quot;QI&quot;. It (the story) first appeared some twenty years ago in a newspaper article, to which my father immediately wrote a rebuttal. This was obviously ferreted out by some BBC researcher. It may be quite interesting, but in this case, it just isn&#x27;t true.

Fry then apologised and corrected the error, saying &quot;Their language is called &#x27;Oddle poddle&#x27;. &#x27;Flobbadob&#x27; means &#x27;Flowerpot&#x27; in Oddle poddle.&quot;

It has later been established that while Hilda Brabban did sell stories about characters named Bill and Ben to the BBC in the 1950s, these bear no resemblance to the Bill and Ben of the Flower Pot Men.

==Culture==
&quot;QI&quot; has stated it follows a philosophy: everything in the world, even that which appears to be the most boring, is &quot;quite interesting&quot; if looked at in the right way. The website states that:

&quot;We live, they say, in The Information Age, yet almost none of the information we think we possess is true. Eskimos do not rub noses. The rickshaw was invented by an American. Joan of Arc was not French. Lenin was not Russian. The world is not solid, it is made of empty space and energy, and neither haggis, whisky, porridge, clan tartans nor kilts are Scottish. So we stand, silent, on a peak in Darien a vast, rolling, teeming, untrodden territory before us. &quot;QI&quot; country. Whatever is interesting we are interested in. Whatever is not interesting, we are even more interested in. Everything is interesting if looked at &quot;in the right way&quot;. At one extreme, &quot;QI&quot; is serious, intensely scientific, deeply mystical; at the other it is hilarious, silly and frothy enough to please the most indolent couch-potato.&quot;
On 28 December 2009, the BBC Radio 4 panel game &quot;The Unbelievable Truth&quot;, hosted by frequent &quot;QI&quot; guest panellist David Mitchell, broadcast a New Year&#x27;s Special which paid tribute to &quot;QI&quot;. The show featured Fry, Davies and Lloyd on the panel, as well as Rob Brydon, another regular &quot;QI&quot; participant.

==Controversies and criticism==

===Content perceived as offensive===

In December 2010, panellists on &quot;QI&quot; made jokes during a discussion about Tsutomu Yamaguchi, who survived both atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. Yamaguchi had died only earlier that year. The Japanese embassy in London wrote a letter of complaint to the BBC about the content of its quiz show after being alerted to the content when viewers in Japan contacted diplomatic staff. Yamaguchi&#x27;s daughter also made known how upset she was as a result of the comments broadcast on the BBC. She said that Britain, as a nuclear power, had no right to &quot;look down&quot; on her father. In January 2011, the BBC issued an apology for &quot;any offence caused&quot; to Japan by the incident, recognising &quot;the sensitivity of the subject matter for Japanese viewers&quot;. In February 2011, the BBC cited a &quot;strength of feeling&quot; in Japan following its atomic bomb joke broadcast in its decision to cancel the filming of part of its &quot;Planet Word&quot; documentary in the country, which was due to be presented by Fry.

In February 2011, the BBC received several complaints about jokes made in an episode of &quot;QI&quot; about Margaret Thatcher. Regular panellist Jo Brand commented that Lady Thatcher sounded like &quot;a device for removing pubic hair&quot;. Later, panellist Phill Jupitus shouted &quot;Burn the witch!&quot; when a digitally altered picture of Thatcher, showcasing the Thatcher effect optical illusion, was shown on-screen. Several Conservative politicians condemned the remarks; and Lord Tebbit complained that &quot;Lady Thatcher has been treated like this by the BBC for the past 30 years&quot;.

In 2011, an episode of &quot;QI&quot; featuring Jeremy Clarkson was withdrawn due to controversial comments Clarkson had recently made about people dying by suicide by jumping in front of trains. The &quot;QI&quot; episode did not contain any such statements, but was postponed &quot;to avoid putting Clarkson in the spotlight&quot;. The episode, on the subject of &quot;idleness&quot;, was broadcast later.

On 11 January 2013, an episode of &quot;QI&quot; ending with Fry reading a limerick about paedophilia was criticised by viewers, especially as it was broadcast directly before a &quot;Newsnight&quot; report on Jimmy Savile. The BBC Trust described the incident as &quot;unfortunate and regrettable&quot; and the limerick as &quot;capable of causing offence&quot;, but ruled it was not in breach of BBC guidelines.

===Gender gap===

The BBC has received criticism regarding the lack of women on their comedy panel shows. As a result, the corporation decided to ban all-male panels on comedy shows in February 2014, with BBC&#x27;s director of TV Danny Cohen stating in an interview with &quot;The Observer&quot; that &quot;shows without women are unacceptable&quot;. In November 2014, &quot;Mirror&quot; reported stats revealing that 38% of all &quot;QI&quot; episodes at that time had featured only men, 55.9% featured only one woman, and only the remaining 6.1% had two or three women, out of a total of three guest panellists per episode (the fourth one being regular panellist Alan Davies). Clem Bastow of &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; was supportive of BBC&#x27;s decision, saying that &quot;left to their own devices, the producers of these shows are clearly failing massively when it comes to putting together line-ups that aren&#x27;t just endless parades of the same old white men,&quot; and noted that this could motivate the producers to uncover some new talent. In 2017, creator of &quot;QI&quot; John Lloyd commented on BBC&#x27;s decision, telling the &quot;Cheltenham Literature Festival&quot; that &quot;arguing a BBC quota for women panellists risked being mere tokenism&quot;, while his wife Sarah Wallace—director of QI Limited—stated that female comedians are hesitant to appear on the show.

In April 2014, Sandi Toksvig, who was hosting &quot;The News Quiz&quot; on BBC Radio 4 at that time, had also criticised BBC&#x27;s decision saying that &quot;recruiting more female hosts would be a more desirable way of correcting the imbalance.&quot; She explained that women would feel more comfortable about participating with a female host, and described the fact that many quiz shows are presented by men as &quot;slightly ridiculous&quot;. In 2015, when Toksvig took over from Fry as a host of &quot;QI&quot;, she told the &quot;Guardian&quot; newspaper: &quot;If I can show that by hosting a programme like this women neither destroy the social fabric of this country [nor] frighten the horses, it&#x27;s a very good job.&quot; Nevertheless, Toksvig has acknowledged Fry&#x27;s delicate treatment towards his female panellists, and she herself continues to encourage them to be smart and funny when they appear on the show. In 2018, Emma Cox of &quot;Radio Times&quot; highlighted a notable difference between &quot;QI&quot; and other &quot;aggressively masculine&quot; panel shows.

In September 2018, while responding to a question on equal pay at the Women&#x27;s Equality Party&#x27;s conference, Toksvig revealed that she receives 40% of what Stephen Fry was being paid as the host of &quot;QI&quot;, and the same amount as panellist Alan Davies. Talent fees for &quot;QI&quot; are managed by Talkback.

Approximately ten years after the &quot;Mirror&quot; reported that 30.1% of QI guests were female, this number had increased to 31.9%.

==Reception==

&quot;QI&quot; was received very positively by its viewers. It was the most popular programme on BBC Four in 2005, and one of its books, &quot;The Book of General Ignorance&quot;, became a global best-seller for Christmas 2006.

&quot;QI&quot; has been supported by nearly all critics. Peter Chapman said, &quot;When the schedules seem so dumbed-down, it&#x27;s a delight to encounter the brainy and articulate Stephen Fry. He excels in this format, being both scathing and generous.&quot; Another critic, Laura Barton said, &quot;&quot;QI&quot; and its canny coupling of Stephen Fry and Alan Davies, which manages to condense tweedy goodness, cockney charm, pub trivia and class war into one half-hour.&quot;

Julia Raeside from &quot;The Guardian&quot; reviewed the show during its tenth series, calling it &quot;still rather more than quite interesting&quot; and complimenting it for being &quot;one of the last truly popular programmes on mainstream television where comedians are allowed to be clever&quot;. Raeside noted ratings were still high, as four million viewers in total watched the first J series episode of &quot;QI&quot; and &quot;QI XL&quot;. American critic Liesl Schillinger described &quot;QI&quot; as &quot;&quot;Jeopardy!&quot; with Stephen Colbert as host, with Steve Martin and Ellen DeGeneres as guests, working off a game board loaded with unanswerable questions.&quot;

Matt Smith gave &quot;QI Live&quot; a positive review, calling it &quot;funny, educational, and ... quite interesting&quot;; Smith noted there was a &quot;great deal of Fry worship&quot; and that, due to high ticket prices, &quot;only the most dedicated Fry fans ... would come to this show&quot;. He commented that &quot;much like the television show, your enjoyment of the stage version will be affected by how you perceive the guests&quot;, but went on to say that he enjoyed the line-up in the show he saw.

===Awards===
==Media releases==
&quot;QI&quot; has entered a number of different media, and has seen an increasing number of tie-in DVDs, books and newspaper columns released since 2005.

===Books===

====United Kingdom====
The first &quot;QI&quot; book was 2006&#x27;s &quot;The Book of General Ignorance&quot;, published in hardback on 5 October by Faber and Faber. () Written by producer and series-creator John Lloyd and &quot;QI&#x27;s&quot; head of research, John Mitchinson, it includes a foreword by Fry and &quot;Four words&quot; by Davies (&quot;Will this do, Stephen?&quot;.) Most of the book&#x27;s facts and clarifications have appeared on the programme, including its list of 200 popular misconceptions, many of which featured during the &quot;General Ignorance&quot; rounds. On 8 December 2006, the book &quot;became a surprise bestseller over the Christmas period, becoming Amazon&#x27;s number one Global bestseller for Christmas 2006.&quot; By the end of January 2007, it had sold more than 300,000 copies (and subsequently over half a million), paving the way for subsequent (projected) annual book releases to capitalise on the UK Christmas book market. As of 2008, the Official &quot;QI&quot; website notes that it will soon be published in 23 countries.

Pocket-sized and audio versions of &quot;General Ignorance&quot; went on sale the following year. In 2008, a newly revised version was published under the title of &quot;The Book of General Ignorance: The Noticeably Stouter Edition&quot;. This edition corrected and updated some of the information from the first print, while adding 50 new sections (and extra illustrations) to the original 230. It also included quotes from the series, new &quot;Four Words&quot; by Davies and added a complete episode listing from Series A–F, along with an index.

&quot;QI&quot;″s second book, &quot;The Book of Animal Ignorance&quot;, was released in the UK (in the same hardback format) by Faber &amp; Faber on 4 October 2007. () It promised to be a &quot;bestiary for the 21st century,&quot; and contains almost completely new quite interesting facts. The book includes &quot;400 diagrams and cartoons by the brilliant Ted Dewan&quot;, another Foreword by Stephen Fry and a &quot;Forepaw&quot; by Alan Davies. This publication has also been followed by a pocket-sized version.

On the Factoids feature of the Series A DVD, John Lloyd mentioned an idea he&#x27;d had for a &quot;QI&quot; book of quotations, under the working title &quot;Quote Interesting&quot;. This book was eventually published in 2008 as &quot;Advanced Banter&quot;. Similarly, on the Banter feature of the Series B DVD, Lloyd also previewed the title of &quot;QI&quot;″s fourth book, &quot;The QI Book of the Dead&quot;, which went on sale on 15 October 2009.

7 October 2010 saw the publication of &quot;QI&quot;″s fifth book—&quot;The Second Book of General Ignorance&quot;. Written by the same authors, this book covers a whole new series of questions on a wide variety of topics, which promises to prove that &quot;everything you think you know is (still) wrong&quot;.

The sixth &quot;QI&quot; book, &quot;1,227 QI Facts To Blow Your Socks Off&quot;, a list of facts, was published on 1 November 2012. James Harkin, &quot;QI&quot;″s chief researcher, co-wrote the book with Lloyd and Mitchinson.

&quot;QI&quot;″s first annual, The QI &quot;E&quot; Annual or The QI Annual 2008 was published by Faber and Faber on 1 November 2007, to coincide with the initial airing of the TV show&#x27;s E series (.) Succeeding years have seen the publication of &quot;F&quot;, &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot; annuals, concurrent with the BBC show&#x27;s chronology, though retrospective annuals on the first four letters of the alphabet have yet to be published. The covers, which feature various cartoon scenes starring caricatures of Fry and regular &quot;QI&quot; panellists, are produced by David Stoten (one of Roger Law&#x27;s &quot;Spitting Image&quot; team), who also contributed to the annuals&#x27; contents. Many of said cover stars are also credited with contributing content to the annuals, which also provide a showcase for Rowan Atkinson&#x27;s talents as a &#x27;rubber-faced&#x27; comic, as well as the comic stylings of Newman and Husband from &quot;Private Eye&quot;, &quot;Viz&#x27;s&quot; Chris Donald, Geoff Dunbar, Ted Dewan and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;″s Matt Pritchett.

====France====
A French edition entitled &quot;Les autruches ne mettent pas la tête dans le sable : 200 bonnes raisons de renoncer à nos certitudes&quot; (&quot;Ostriches don&#x27;t put their heads in the sand: 200 good reasons to give up our convictions&quot;) was published by Dunod on 3 October 2007. () It is released as part of Dunod&#x27;s &quot;Cult.Science&quot;/&quot;Oh, les Sciences !&quot; series, which also includes titles by Robert L. Wolke, Ian Stewart and Raymond Smullyan.

====Italy====
An Italian edition entitled &quot;Il libro dell&#x27;ignoranza&quot; (&quot;The book of ignorance&quot;) was published by Einaudi in 2007 and in 2009 the same publisher published &quot;Il libro dell&#x27;ignoranza sugli animali&quot; (&quot;The book of ignorance about animals&quot;.)

====United States====

On 7 August 2007, &quot;The Book of General Ignorance&quot; was published in America by Harmony Books. () It features a sparser cover downplaying its links to the TV series, which had yet to be broadcast in the US. The book received glowing reviews from both &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot;, which recommended it in its &quot;Books Holiday Gift Guide&quot;. (It subsequently entered the &quot;New York Times&quot;″ &quot;Hardcover Advice&quot; best-seller charts at No. 10 on 9 December, falling to No. 11 two weeks later where it stayed until mid-January, before falling out of the top 15 on 20 January.)

===DVDs===
A number of DVDs related to &quot;QI&quot; have also been released, including interactive quizzes, and complete series releases.

====Interactive quizzes====
On 14 November 2005 an interactive &quot;QI&quot; DVD game, called &quot;QI: A Quite Interesting Game&quot;, was released by Warner Vision International. A second interactive game, &quot;QI: Strictly Come Duncing&quot; followed on 26 November 2007, once again from Warner Vision International. Both games feature Fry asking questions, and then explaining the answers in full &quot;QI&quot;-mode.

====Series releases====

=====United Kingdom=====
A DVD release for the first series was the direct result of an internet petition signed by 1,821 people, which persuaded the BBC of the interest in such a move. Series A, was therefore released by BBC Worldwide&#x27;s DVD venture, 2 entertain Ltd. on 6 November 2006 (as &quot;QI: The Complete First Series.&quot;) It contains a number of outtakes as well as the unbroadcast pilot. Sales over the Christmas period, however (in stark contrast to &quot;The Book of General Ignorance&quot;, which topped the Amazon.co.uk best-seller list), were not as strong as hoped. A lack of adequate advertising is thought to be to blame (and subsequent episodes of &quot;QI&quot; have since trailed the DVD), and may have factored in the label change for Series B. Series B was released on 17 March 2008, followed by Series C on 1 September. In 2014, a message on the QI site read &quot;Due to a number of copyright issues there are difficulties releasing further series of QI on DVD&quot;.

On 14 December 2015, the Network imprint announced on its website that it had made a deal with FremantleMedia so previously unreleased shows could be made available on DVD sometime in 2016; among the list was &quot;QI&quot;. The DVD sets, released on 8 May 2017, were split into two initial volumes of series A-D and E-G, containing additional features including a &#x27;Making of&#x27; feature, interviews and bloopers. Two additional sets, series H-J and K-M are scheduled for release on 23 October 2017.

=====Australia=====
A box-set of series 1–3 (Series A-C) was released in September 2011. Additionally, a single DVD titled &quot;The Best Bits&quot; containing clips from Series G was released on 3 June 2010. Two years later a three DVD set labelled as &quot;Series 9&quot; was released in August 2012, containing the Series H episodes. The Series 9 DVD title was later changed to &quot;The H Series&quot; and The Series J was released also on 5 March 2014.

<doc id="380841" wikidata="Q1925819" url="?curid=380841" title="Metropolitan Borough of Paddington">
<text>Paddington was a civil parish and metropolitan borough in London, England. It was an ancient parish in the county of Middlesex, governed by an administrative vestry. The parish was included in the area of responsibility of the Metropolitan Board of Works in 1855 and became part of the County of London in 1889. The parish of Paddington became a metropolitan borough in 1900, following the London Government Act 1899, with the parish vestry replaced by a borough council. In 1965 the borough was abolished and its former area became part of the City of Westminster in Greater London.

==History==
Its area covered that part of the current City of Westminster west of Edgware Road and Maida Vale, and north of Bayswater Road. Places in the borough included Paddington, Westbourne Green, Bayswater, Maida Hill, Queens Park, Kensal Green, West Kilburn, Maida Vale. To the south it bordered the Metropolitan Borough of Westminster, to the east, the Metropolitan Borough of St Marylebone.

The borough was abolished on 1 April 1965 by the London Government Act 1963 and its former area merged with that of the Metropolitan Borough of Westminster and the Metropolitan Borough of St Marylebone to form the present-day City of Westminster.

==Borough council==

===Coat of arms===
 The borough council&#x27;s coat of arms, granted by the College of Arms on 5 April 1902, was based on the former Paddington vestry seal. The seal featured crossed swords from the arms of the See of London passing through a mural crown, symbol of local government. To these were added the wolves&#x27; heads and blue background from the arms of the first Mayor of the Borough, Sir John Aird. Sir John, who was member of parliament for Paddington North, also donated the mayoral badge and chain.

The arms were blazoned as follows:
&quot;Azure, two Swords in Saltire proper pommels and hilts Or enfiled with a Mural Crown of the last. Two Wolves heads erased in Chief Argent&quot;.

===Town hall===
Paddington Town Hall, designed by James Lockyer in the Classical style, dated from 1853. The building, originally the Vestry Hall, was situated on Paddington Green. It was enlarged in 1900 and 1920. Following its closure in 1965, it was demolished to make way for the Westway urban motorway.

==Population and area==
The area of Paddington Metropolitan Borough was , once part of Kensal New Town was added after 1901. The population recorded in the Census was:

Paddington Vestry 1801–1899

Metropolitan Borough 1900–1961

:&quot;Note that the population statistics up to 1891 exclude the area of Kensal Town transferred from Chelsea in 1900.&quot;

==Politics==
===Borough council===

Under the Metropolis Management Act 1855 any parish that exceeded 2,000 ratepayers was to be divided into wards; as such the incorporated vestry of Paddington was divided into four wards (electing vestrymen): No. 1 (12), No. 2 (18), No. 3 (18) and No. 4 (24).

In 1894 as its population had increased the incorporated vestry was re-divided into six wards (electing vestrymen): Harrow Road (12), Maida Vale (9), Church (12), Westbourne (12), Lancaster Gate (15) and Hyde Park (12).

The metropolitan borough was divided into eight wards for elections: Church, Harrow Road, Hyde Park, Lancaster Gate East, Lancaster Gate West, Maida Vale, Queen&#x27;s Park and Westbourne.
===Parliament constituency===
For elections to Parliament, the borough was divided into two and a half constituencies:
*Chelsea
*Paddington North
*Paddington South
In 1918 the borough&#x27;s representation was reduced to two seats:
*Paddington North
*Paddington South

<text>The Metropolitan Borough of St Marylebone was a metropolitan borough of the County of London from 1900 to 1965. It was based directly on the previously existing civil parish of St Marylebone, Middlesex, which was incorporated into the Metropolitan Board of Works area in 1855, retaining a parish vestry, and then became part of the County of London in 1889.

Its area was that part of the current City of Westminster which is north of Oxford Street, and east of Maida Vale and Edgware Road. It included the areas Marylebone, Regent&#x27;s Park, St John&#x27;s Wood, and Lisson Grove, along with the western part of the district of Fitzrovia.

In 1965 it was abolished and its former area was amalgamated with that of the Metropolitan Borough of Paddington and the Metropolitan Borough of Westminster to form the City of Westminster.

== Origins and arms ==

The name is derived from a chapel, dedicated to St Mary, and founded by Barking Abbey, the holders of the Manor of Tyburn. The chapel was named St Mary-le-Bourne, for the &quot;bourne&quot;, or River Tyburn. In the borough&#x27;s coat of arms, the blue and white waves represent this stream; the lily and rose, derived from Barking Abbey, represent the legend that when the Virgin&#x27;s tomb was opened it was found to contain lilies and roses.

The motto: &quot;Fiat Secundum Verbatum Tuum&quot;, is from the Gospel of Luke Ch.I v.38 and translates as &quot;Be it according to Thy Word&quot;.

The arms were granted by the College of Arms on 17 August 1901.

== Town hall ==
Following a competition in 1911, Sir Edwin Cooper was commissioned to design Marylebone Town Hall. The building, in Marylebone Road was built 1914–20. The building is faced with Portland stone and is an example of Edwardian Graeco-Roman classicism, with a tower in the style of Christopher Wren and fluted columns. Cooper also designed the 1938–39 extension in a simpler style to house the public library.

== Population and area ==

Bloxam was educated at Elborow School before attending Rugby School between 1813 and 1820. In 1821 he was articled to George Harris, a solicitor in Rugby. He did not find success in the profession when he went into practice on his own account, and in 1831 he became clerk of the court, a post he held for 40 years.

He is remembered as an antiquarian on Rugby and the surrounding area. In 1836 he successfully located the Roman town of Tripontium nearby. His work was published in two books and many journal articles; although many of his conclusions are now thought doubtful, his collection of archaeological finds still exists. He lived in what is now the Percival Guildhouse, while his brother ran a boarding school next door in what became the public library. A new library replaced the old one in 2000 and a life-size statue of Bloxham engaged in his archaeological work greets visitors to the Rugby museum located in the new library complex.

==&quot;The Principles of Gothic Architecture&quot;==
While visiting country churches to consult their registers in the course of his professional 
work, Bloxam began making the observations which led to his subsequent knowledge of ecclesiastical architecture. While still under articles he began collecting the notes which he was to publish in 1829 as &quot;The Principles of Gothic Architecture elucidated by Question and Answer&quot; (Leicester, 1829). It was described by Charles Locke Eastlake as &quot;a small but well digested volume admirably adapted for the use of amateurs&quot;. The book proved popular, leading to a second edition in 1835. In 1844 the book reached a ninth edition, in which the question-and-answer format was abandoned, under the amended title of &quot;The Principles of Gothic Ecclesiastical Architecture with an explanation of technical terms, and a centenary of ancient terms&quot;. A German translation of the seventh edition was
published at Leipzig in 1847. At the suggestion of Sir George Gilbert Scott, Bloxam set about preparing an enlarged edition, which eventually appeared in three volumes in 1882, containing additional chapters on vestments and on church arrangements. It was illustrated with wood engravings by Thomas Orlando Sheldon Jewitt.

==William Webb Ellis story==
Bloxam is the sole source of the story that the game of Rugby football had its origins in the moment when William Webb Ellis picked up the ball during a game of football at Rugby School. In October 1876, in an effort to refute the assertion that carrying the ball had been an ancient tradition, he wrote to &quot;The Meteor&quot;, the Rugby School magazine, that he had learnt from an unnamed source that the change from a kicking game to a handling game had &quot;..originated with a town boy or foundationer of the name of Ellis, William Webb Ellis&quot;. In December 1880, in another letter to &quot;the Meteor&quot;, Bloxam elaborated on the story: A boy of the name Ellis – William Webb Ellis – a town boy and a foundationer, ... whilst playing Bigside at football in that half-year [1823], caught the ball in his arms. This being so, according to the then rules, he ought to have retired back as far as he pleased, without parting with the ball, for the combatants on the opposite side could only advance to the spot where he had caught the ball, and were unable to rush forward till he had either punted it or had placed it for some one else to kick, for it was by means of these placed kicks that most of the goals were in those days
kicked, but the moment the ball touched the ground the opposite side might rush on. Ellis, for the first time, disregarded this rule, and on catching the ball, instead of retiring backwards, rushed forwards with the ball in his hands towards the opposite goal, with what result as to the game I know not, neither do I know how this infringement of a well-known rule was followed up, or when it became, as it is now, a standing rule.

==Death==
Bloxam died on 24 April 1888, and was buried in the grounds of the chapel at Brownsover.

<doc id="380845" wikidata="Q19093" url="?curid=380845" title="List of countries by GDP (nominal)">
<text>Gross domestic product (GDP) is the market value of all final goods and services from a nation in a given year. Countries are sorted by nominal GDP estimates from financial and statistical institutions, which are calculated at market or government official exchange rates. Nominal GDP does not take into account differences in the cost of living in different countries, and the results can vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country&#x27;s currency. Such fluctuations may change a country&#x27;s ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference in the standard of living of its population.

Comparisons of national wealth are also frequently made based on purchasing power parity (PPP), to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries. Other metrics, nominal GDP per capita and a corresponding GDP (PPP) per capita are used for comparing national standard of living. On the whole, PPP per capita figures are less spread than nominal GDP per capita figures.

The rankings of national economies over time have changed considerably; the economy of the United States surpassed the British Empire&#x27;s output around 1916, which in turn had surpassed the economy of the Qing dynasty in aggregate output decades earlier. Since China&#x27;s transition to a socialist market economy through controlled privatisation and deregulation, the country has seen its ranking increase from ninth in 1978, to second in 2010; China&#x27;s economic growth accelerated during this period and its share of global nominal GDP surged from 2% in 1980 to 18% in 2021.

The first list includes estimates compiled by the International Monetary Fund&#x27;s World Economic Outlook, the second list shows the World Bank&#x27;s data, and the third list includes data compiled by the United Nations Statistics Division. The IMF&#x27;s definitive data for the past year and estimates for the current year are published twice a year in April and October. Non-sovereign entities (the world, continents, and some dependent territories) and states with limited international recognition (such as Kosovo and Taiwan) are included in the list where they appear in the sources.

<doc id="380846" wikidata="Q777247" url="?curid=380846" title="Metropolitan Borough of St Pancras">
<text>St Pancras was a civil parish and metropolitan borough in London, England. It was an ancient parish in the county of Middlesex, governed by an administrative vestry. The parish was included in the area of responsibility of the Metropolitan Board of Works in 1855 and became part of the County of London in 1889. The parish of St Pancras became a metropolitan borough in 1900, following the London Government Act 1899, with the parish vestry replaced by a borough council. In 1965 the borough was abolished and its former area became part of the London Borough of Camden in Greater London.

==Geography==

It included Tottenham Court Road, Camden Town, St Pancras, Kings Cross, Somers Town, Kentish Town, Euston, and part of Regent&#x27;s Park. There are still a few street name signs with &quot;Borough of St Pancras&quot; on them.

==Governance==
St Pancras was just outside the area of London mortality statistics known as the bills of mortality, and was counted as one of the &quot;five villages beyond the Bills&quot;. In 1801 it was included as a metropolitan parish for census purposes and was part of statistical returns for the Metropolis from that date.

The parish adopted the Vestries Act 1831, which provided for election of vestrymen by all ratepayers. The vestry was incorporated as a local authority by the Metropolis Management Act 1855. St Pancras had a local act to regulate the poor law so was unaffected by the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834. The Metropolitan Poor Act 1867 (30 &amp; 31 Vict. c. 6) later provided that the Poor Law Board could add it to a poor law union or install a board of guardians. The parish was transferred from the County of Middlesex to the County of London in 1889. Following the London Government Act 1899, the civil parish of St Pancras also became a metropolitan borough. The vestry was replaced with a borough council.

==Coat of arms==

===Unofficial arms of 1902===

The corporation designed its own, unofficial, coat of arms in 1902. In the centre of the shield was a depiction of St Pancras. The shield itself was in four quarters. The first quarter was described as a &quot;fimbriated cross&quot; (actually a saltire) representing the martyrdom of Pancras. The fourth quarter stood for Middlesex, and bore three seaxes on red: (the attributed arms of the kingdom of the middle and east Saxons). The other two quarters had a lion and cross crosslets; and blue and silver chequers. These were taken from the arms of the borough of Lewes, in Sussex. The parish church of Lewes was the first in England to be dedicated to St Pancras. At the top of the shield was shown a gold rising sun for the &quot;dawn of Christianity&quot; in the area. The colours used in the design were described as &quot;gold, azure, white and crimson&quot;. The motto adopted was &quot;Constans Justitiam Moniti&quot; (&quot;Well Versed In Justice&quot;). According to Richard Crosley, writing in 1928, &quot;This motto is unique amongst the mottoes of London in as much as the author has not discovered anyone who can translate it&quot;.

===Official arms of 1936===
In 1936 the corporation received an official grant from the College of Arms. The figure of St Pancras was moved to the crest, on top of the helm. The shield featured elements from the arms of historical landowners of the borough. The scallop shells were taken from the arms of the Russell family, Dukes of Bedford. The elephant&#x27;s heads were from the arms of the Marquess Camden. The roses and crossed swords represented the Dean and Chapter of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

The 1936 arms can still be seen over the entrance of Camden Town Hall. Charges from these arms were used, together with charges from the coats of arms of Hampstead and of Holborn, when the new coat of arms of the London Borough of Camden was designed in 1965.

==Population and area==
The borough had an area of . The populations recorded in National Censuses were:

St Pancras Vestry 1801-1899

Metropolitan Borough 1900-1961
==Politics==

Under the Metropolis Management Act 1855 any parish that exceeded 2,000 ratepayers was to be divided into wards; as such the incorporated vestry of St Pancras was divided into eight wards (electing vestrymen): No. 1 (9), No. 2 (12), No. 3 (18), No. 4 (15), No. 5 (15), No. 6 (15), No. 7 (18) and No. 8 (18). The metropolitan borough divided into those same wards for its elections.

===Parliament constituencies serving this area===
For elections to Parliament, the borough was used as the starting base and at first divided into four:
*St Pancras East
*St Pancras North
*St Pancras South
*St Pancras West
Then, from 1918 into three:
*St Pancras North
*St Pancras South East
*St Pancras South West
From 1950 parliamentary representation was reduced to seats namely:
*Holborn and St Pancras South
*St Pancras North
As such in the south, a seat straddled this Borough and the Metropolitan Borough of Holborn.

<text>The Metropolitan Borough of Holborn was a metropolitan borough in the County of London between 1900 and 1965. The borough included most of Holborn (the parts outside the City of London) as well as Bloomsbury and St Giles. 

In 1965 the borough amalgamated with the Metropolitan Borough of St Pancras and the Metropolitan Borough of Hampstead to form the new London Borough of Camden.

==Formation and boundaries==
The borough was formed in 1900 from seven civil parishes and extra-parochial places; all but the first of these were historically part of Holborn:
* St Giles in the Fields and St George Bloomsbury
* St Andrew Holborn Above the Bars with St George the Martyr
* Liberty of Saffron Hill
* Furnival&#x27;s Inn (part)
* Gray&#x27;s Inn
* Lincoln&#x27;s Inn
* Staple Inn
In 1930 these seven were combined into a single civil parish called Holborn, which was conterminous with the metropolitan borough.

Previous to the borough&#x27;s formation it had been administered by two separate local bodies: Holborn District Board of Works and St Giles District Board of Works. The Inns of Court and Inns of Chancery had not been under the control of any local authority prior to 1900.

==Coat of arms==
St Giles, St George (patron saint of Bloomsbury) and St Andrew (patron saint of Holborn) were depicted on the borough seal. The several constituent parishes were illustrated in the arms granted to Holborn in 1906, while the supporters, the Lion and the Griffin are from the arms of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn and Gray&#x27;s Inn (Inns of Court).

Charges from these arms were used, together with charges from the coats of arms of Hampstead and of St. Pancras, when the new coat of arms of the London Borough of Camden was designed in 1965.

==Visible legacy==
Several of the street name signs in the British Museum/Senate House area still bear the &quot;Borough of Holborn&quot; area designation. Holborn Town Hall, built in 1894, still exists, on High Holborn, and still has the coat of arms in the façade. The entrance gate piers to the church of St Giles-in-the-Fields commemorate the Borough when it was amalgamated in 1965, and bear an inscription to this effect, although the arch that bore the borough&#x27;s arms has since been removed. 

==Population and area==
Holborn was the smallest of the twenty-eight metropolitan boroughs of the County of London, with an area of between 405 and . Therefore, it was even smaller than the City of London. It also had the smallest population of any of the boroughs throughout its existence. The populations recorded in National Censuses were:

Constituent parishes 1801–1899

Metropolitan Borough 1900-1961
==Politics==

The borough was divided into nine wards for elections: Central St Giles, Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, North Bloomsbury, North St Andrew, North St Giles, Saffron Hill, South Bloomsbury, South East St Andrew and St George the Martyr.

===Borough council===

===Parliament constituency===
For elections to Parliament, the borough was represented by one constituency:
*Holborn
In 1950 the borough&#x27;s representation was reduced to half a seat, when it was merged with part of St Pancras:
*Holborn and St Pancras South

<text>The brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater) is a small, obligate brood parasitic icterid native to temperate and subtropical North America. It is a permanent resident in the southern parts of its range; northern birds migrate to the southern United States and Mexico in winter, returning to their summer habitat around March or April.

==Taxonomy==
The brown-headed cowbird was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1775 in his &quot;Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux&quot; from a specimen collected in the Carolinas. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-colored plate engraved by François-Nicolas Martinet in the &quot;Planches Enluminées D&#x27;Histoire Naturelle&quot;, which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon&#x27;s text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon&#x27;s description included a scientific name, but in 1783, Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name &quot;Oriolus ater&quot; in his catalogue of the &quot;Planches Enluminées&quot;. The brown-headed cowbird is now placed in the genus &quot;Molothrus&quot; that was introduced by English naturalist William Swainson in 1832 with the brown-headed cowbird as the type species. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek &quot;mōlos&quot; meaning &quot;struggle&quot; or &quot;battle&quot; with &quot;thrōskō&quot; meaning &quot;to sire&quot; or &quot;to impregnate&quot;. The specific name &quot;ater&quot; is Latin for &quot;dull black&quot;. The English name &quot;cowbird&quot;, first recorded in 1839, refers to this species often being seen near cattle.

Three subspecies are recognised:

* &quot;M. a. artemisiae&quot; Grinnell, 1909 – interior west Canada and west USA
* &quot;M. a. obscurus&quot; (Gmelin, JF, 1789) – coastal Alaska, Canada, USA, and northwest Mexico
* &quot;M. a. ater&quot; (Boddaert, 1783) – southeast Canada, east and central USA, and northeast Mexico

==Description==
The brown-headed cowbird is typical for an icterid in general shape, but is distinguished by its finch-like head and beak and smaller size. The adult male is iridescent black in color with a brown head. The adult female is slightly smaller and is dull grey with a pale throat and very fine streaking on the underparts. Their total length is and the average wingspan is . Body mass can range from , with females averaging against the males&#x27; average of .

==Distribution and habitat==

The species lives in open or semiopen country, and often travels in flocks, sometimes mixed with red-winged blackbirds (particularly in spring) and bobolinks (particularly in fall), as well as common grackles or European starlings. These birds forage on the ground, often following grazing animals such as horses and cattle to catch insects stirred up by the larger animals. They mainly eat seeds, insects and rarely, berries.

Before European settlement, brown-headed cowbirds followed bison herds across the prairies. Their population expanded with the clearing of forested areas and the introduction of new grazing animals by settlers across North America. They are now commonly seen at suburban birdfeeders.

In 2012, brown-headed cowbirds in northwest Riverside County, CA tested positive for West Nile Virus.

==Behavior and ecology==
=== Brood parasitism ===
The brown-headed cowbird is an obligate brood parasite; it lays its eggs in the nests of other small passerines (perching birds), particularly those that build cup-like nests. The brown-headed cowbird eggs have been documented in nests of at least 220 host species, including hummingbirds and raptors. More than 140 different species of birds are known to have raised young cowbirds. The young cowbird is fed by the host parents at the expense of their own young. Brown-headed cowbird females can lay up to 40 eggs in a season.

====Host response====
Some host species, such as the house finch, feed their young a vegetarian diet. This is unsuitable for young brown-headed cowbirds, meaning few survive to fledge. Accepting a cowbird egg and rearing a cowbird chick can be costly to a host species. In the American redstart, nests parasitized by cowbirds were found to have a higher rate of predation, likely due in part to the loud begging calls by the cowbird nestling, but also partly explained by the fact that nests likely to be parasitized are also more likely to be preyed upon.

Unlike the common cuckoo, the brown-headed cowbird is not divided into gentes whose eggs imitate those of a particular host. Host species sometimes notice the cowbird egg, with different hosts reacting to the egg in different ways. Some, like the blue-grey gnatcatcher, abandon their nest, losing their own eggs as well. Others, like the American yellow warbler, bury the foreign egg under nest material, where it perishes. The brown thrasher physically ejects the egg from the nest. Experiments with grey catbirds, a known cowbird host, have shown that this species rejects cowbird eggs more than 95% of the time. For this species, the cost of accepting cowbird eggs (i.e. the loss of their own eggs or nestlings through starvation or the actions of the nestling cowbird) was far higher than the cost of rejecting those eggs (i.e. where the host might conceivably eject its own egg accidentally). Brown-headed cowbird nestlings are also sometimes expelled from the nest. Nestlings of host species can also alter their behavior in response to the presence of a cowbird nestling. 

====Parasite response====
Song sparrow nestlings in parasitized nests alter their vocalizations in frequency and amplitude so that they resemble the cowbird nestling, and these nestlings tend to be fed equally often as nestlings in unparasitized nests. 

Brown-headed cowbirds seem to periodically check on their eggs and young after they have deposited them. Removal of the parasitic egg may trigger a retaliatory reaction termed &quot;mafia behavior&quot;. According to one study the cowbird returned to ransack the nests of a range of host species 56% of the time when their egg was removed. In addition, the cowbird also destroyed nests in a type of &quot;farming behavior&quot; to force the hosts to build new ones. The cowbirds then laid their eggs in the new nests 85% of the time.

Young cowbirds are not exposed to species-typical visual and auditory information like other birds. Despite this, they are able to develop species-typical singing, social, and breeding behaviors. Cowbird brains are wired to respond to the vocalizations of other cowbirds, allowing young to find and join flocks of their own species. These vocalizations are consistent across all cowbird populations, and serve as a sort of species-recognition password. If a young cowbird is not exposed to these &quot;password&quot; vocalizations by a certain age, it will mistakenly imprint on the host species.

=== Male behavior and reproductive success ===
Social behaviors of cowbird males include aggressive, competitive singing bouts with other males and pair bonding and monogamy with females.

By manipulating demographics so juveniles only had access to females, juvenile males developed atypical social behavior; they did not engage in the typical social singing bouts with other males, did not pair bond with females, and were promiscuous. This demonstrates that great flexibility occurs in the behavior of cowbirds, and that the social environment is extremely important in structuring their behavior. Adult males housed with juvenile males were shown to have greater reproductive success compared to adult males housed with other adult males. Being housed with juvenile males honed the reproductive skills of the adult males by providing them with a more complex social environment.

This finding was further studied by comparing the behaviors and reproductive success of males exposed to a dynamic flock, consisting of changing individuals, with males exposed to a static group of individuals. The individuals that stayed with the same group (i.e., static flock) had a stable, predictable relationship between social behavior and reproductive success; the males that sang frequently to females experienced the greatest reproductive success. The adult males that were exposed to a rotating roster of new individuals (i.e., dynamic flock) had an unpredictable relationship between social variables and reproductive success; these males were able to copulate using a much greater variety of social strategies. The males that lived in static flocks had high levels of consistency in their behaviors and reproductive success across multiple years, whereas the males in dynamic flocks experienced varying levels of dominance with other males, differing levels of singing to females, and differing levels of reproductive success.

==Relationship to humans==
With the expansion of its range and its parasitic behavior, the brown-headed cowbird is often regarded as a pest. People sometimes engage in cowbird control programs, with the intention of protecting species negatively impacted by the cowbirds&#x27; brood parasitism. A study of nests of Bell&#x27;s vireo highlighted a potential limitation of these control programs, demonstrating that removal of cowbirds from a site may create an unintended consequence of increasing cowbird productivity on that site, because with fewer cowbirds, fewer parasitized nests are deserted, resulting in greater nest success for cowbirds.

<text>Francis Daniel Crean (28 February 1916 – 2 December 2008) was an Australian politician who served as a member of the House of Representatives from 1951 to 1977, representing the Labor Party. He was a minister in the Whitlam government, including as Treasurer from 1972 to 1974 and the fifth deputy prime minister for a few months in 1975.

Crean was born in Hamilton, Victoria. He attended Melbourne High School and the University of Melbourne, and subsequently worked as a tax accountant. Crean was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly in 1945. He lost his seat in 1947 and reclaimed it in 1949, but quit state politics two years later to stand at the 1951 federal election. Crean spent the first 21 years of his career in federal politics in opposition, albeit as a frontbencher for most of that time. He became Treasurer after the 1972 election, but economic uncertainty and factional considerations meant he was replaced by Jim Cairns after two years. He was instead appointed Minister for Overseas Trade. Crean held that position until the government&#x27;s dismissal in 1975, and for its final six months was also deputy prime minister, replacing Cairns when he became embroiled in the Khemlani affair. He left politics at the 1977 election. His son, Simon Crean, was a Member of Parliament from 1990 to 2013.

==Early life==
Crean was born in Hamilton, Victoria, where his father was a bicycle-maker. Although his father was of Irish Catholic descent, Francis was raised in his mother&#x27;s Presbyterian faith. He was known as Francis in his early life, but later changed his name to the less Irish Catholic-sounding Frank. He graduated from the University of Melbourne with degrees in arts and commerce and a diploma in public administration, and became an accountant and tax consultant.

In 1946, Crean married Mary Findlay, with whom he had three sons. His eldest, Stephen, became lost while skiing and died in a blizzard near Charlotte Pass in August 1985. A massive search failed to find him. His remains were found more than two years later. His second son, Simon Crean, was the federal Labor leader from 2001 to 2003, and was a cabinet member of the Hawke, Keating, Rudd and Gillard governments. His third son, David Crean, became a minister in the state Labor government in Tasmania.

==Politics==

In 1945 Crean was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly, but was defeated in 1947. He was re-elected in 1949. He quit state politics in 1951, to stand for the safe Labor seat of Melbourne Ports in the House of Representatives. In Canberra, Crean advanced rapidly, since he was one of the few Labor members with formal qualifications in economics. Elected to the Opposition front-bench in 1956, he became, in effect, shadow Treasurer (although Labor did not have a formal shadow ministry until 1969). This position he held for 16 years. During the 1960s Crean was sometimes considered as a possible party leader, but his rather plodding public image meant that he was overtaken by Gough Whitlam, who became leader in 1967. When Whitlam finally led Labor to office at the 1972 election, Crean became Treasurer, although Whitlam had no real confidence in him. Crean&#x27;s tenure coincided with the onset of high inflation and rising unemployment. He did not trust the orthodox economic advice he was getting from the Treasury, but he lacked the authority to challenge it. The leader of the Labor Left, Jim Cairns, attacked Crean&#x27;s policies in the Cabinet, and in December 1974 Whitlam gave Cairns the Treasury and moved Crean to the Trade portfolio.

In July 1975 Whitlam sacked Cairns over his involvement in the Loans Affair, and Crean was elected party Deputy Leader and Deputy Prime Minister in his place, defeating Kim Beazley Sr. 47 votes to 31, with Frank Stewart receiving 11 and Kep Enderby 4.

He held this position until the dismissal of the Whitlam government in November 1975. After the election he contested the leadership, polling 13 votes to Lionel Bowen&#x27;s 14 and Whitlam&#x27;s 36. He retired from parliament in 1977.

==Later years==
From 1978 to 2004, Crean was chairman of the New Hope Migrant and Refugee Centre. In July 2006 it was reported that he was too frail to travel interstate for Gough Whitlam&#x27;s 90th birthday function.

Crean died following a short illness on 2 December 2008, the 36th anniversary of the election of the Whitlam government in 1972.

<text>Pinus balfouriana, the foxtail pine, is a rare high-elevation pine that is endemic to California, United States. It is closely related to the Great Basin and Rocky Mountain bristlecone pines, in the subsection &quot;Balfourianae&quot;. 

== Description ==

&quot;P. balfouriana&quot; is a tree to tall, exceptionally , with a trunk up to across. Its leaves are needle-like, in bundles of five (or sometimes four, in the southern Sierra) with a semi-persistent basal sheath, and long, deep glossy green on the outer face, and white on the inner faces; they persist for 10–15 years. The cones are long, dark purple ripening red-brown, with soft, flexible scales each with a central prickle.

== Distribution ==
&quot;P. balfouriana&quot; occurs in the subalpine forest at an elevation of in the Klamath Mountains, and at in the Sierra Nevada. In the Sierra Nevada, Foxtail pines are limited to the area around Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. In both areas, it is often a tree line species.

There are two disjunct populations:

A small outlying population was reported in southern Oregon, but was proven to have been misidentified.
== Age ==
It is thought that &quot;P. balfouriana&quot; can live up to 3000 years in the Sierra Nevada, although the highest currently proven age is 2110 years. In the Klamath Mountains, ages are only known to about 1000 years.
== Related species ==
&quot;P. balfouriana&quot; is closely related to the bristlecone pines, being classified in the same subsection &quot;Balfourianae&quot;; it has been hybridised with the Great Basin Bristlecone Pine in cultivation, though no hybrids have ever been found in the wild.

<text>Parkinson was a British television chat show presented by Michael Parkinson. It was first shown on BBC One from 19 June 1971 to 10 April 1982 and from 9 January 1998 to 24 April 2004. Parkinson then switched to ITV on which the show continued from 4 September 2004 to 22 December 2007. A parallel series was shown in Australia on the ABC between 1979 and 1982. A series entitled &quot;Parkinson One to One&quot; was produced by Yorkshire Television from 28 March 1987 to 23 July 1988.

Parkinson was revived again as &quot;Parkinson: Masterclass&quot; on Sky Arts from 2012 to 2014.

==Background==
&quot;Parkinson&quot; began in 1971 when the host was offered a series of twelve shows by the BBC&#x27;s Head of Light Entertainment, Bill Cotton. It was to be transmitted during the &quot;summer lull&quot; in a late-night slot on Saturdays (which continued throughout its run), plus from 1979 a second mid-week edition when the series was on air. A parallel series was shown in Australia between 1979 and 1982. That year, 1982, Parkinson left the BBC to be co-founder and presenter on the ITV breakfast television station TV-am, where after many schedule upheavals he ended up presenting the Saturday and Sunday morning programme with his wife, Mary Parkinson, until 1984.

Michael Parkinson would eventually return to the BBC for further series. However, in between his work for the BBC he did two series of chat shows for Yorkshire Television in 1987–1988 as &quot;Parkinson One to One&quot;, the format being an interview with a single guest (a practice occasionally employed during his time with the BBC).

He returned to the BBC in August 1995 to present a series of retrospective shows, &quot;Parkinson: The Interviews&quot;, featuring memorable excerpts, eventually presenting a new, revived version of his chat show on BBC One in January 1998. However, in April 2004, ITV announced that it had &quot;poached&quot; the interviewer from the BBC from the autumn of that year. Parkinson said that he was sad to be leaving the BBC but that he and the channel controller, Lorraine Heggessey, could not agree on a suitable slot for his show following the return of Premiership football highlights to the BBC One Saturday evening schedule. The ITV version of the programme, produced by Granada, debuted in September 2004, with an identical set, theme tune and format to the BBC edition. Its audience was around 6m viewers.

The last &quot;Parkinson&quot; run on the BBC (1998–2004) was one of the few recent British TV programmes that was not made in widescreen. However, his ITV show was recorded in the format with very tight close-ups.

Parkinson: Masterclass

Sir Michael Parkinson Describes it as a show he&#x27;s always wanted to do. The series welcomes top-flight guests from across the artistic spectrum and, in his inimitable style, gains a fascinating and intimate insight into their careers via one-on-one interviews. He finds out how they have honed and perfected their techniques and abilities throughout their careers, and episodes also feature unique performances from the guests to demonstrate the work for which they have become so well-known. As well, the studio audience gets to ask questions of the guests. The audience is made up of the general public and students from a vast array of disciplines specially selected to gain insight into the subjects.

==Programme format==
Initially Bill Cotton was keen on a format more akin to the USA&#x27;s &quot;Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, featuring entertainment and chat. However, Parkinson and his producer, Richard Drewett (who had worked on &quot;Late Night Line-Up&quot;), envisaged a combination of guests whose celebrity had been achieved in different fields. Their plan was that the final section of each show would become a conversation rather than a formal interview. The pair wanted to move the style as far as possible from the American prototype, even down to the removal of the host&#x27;s desk, which Parkinson viewed as the &quot;biggest obstacle to a proper interview&quot;. At first, Cotton was against this but Drewett convinced him otherwise.

A typical programme included three interviews, each lasting around 15 minutes. It was customary for the first two guests to remain after their own chats to observe and occasionally participate in those that followed. Such contributions were usually made respectfully, and when invited, though this policy backfired on occasion. In addition, some Hollywood stars were honoured in receiving a solo spot, Russell Crowe being one example. On occasion, an episode featured a single guest for its entire duration if the subject was deemed to be sufficiently deserving. This was the case in 2005 when Madonna appeared as part of her &quot;Hung Up Promo Tour&quot;; besides her interview she performed two songs.

There was usually a musical interlude at some point, featuring a current recording star. If a solo singer, he/she was accompanied by the show&#x27;s musicians, who also provided the walk-on music for each guest. In the 1970s, the group was led by organist Harry Stoneham, who composed the show&#x27;s theme tune. The role was undertaken by Laurie Holloway in the relaunched show.

==Interviewing style==
Michael Parkinson always sought guests who, besides being well known, had some sort of story to relate. He then saw his job as allowing them to tell it and did so by being open, relaxed and attentive. (He learnt very early on that in order to be an adept interviewer, he had to be a good listener.) He researched his subjects thoroughly, and, in the early shows, always had his list of questions to hand. Having guided them to an area of discussion, he rarely interrupted his guests – except to provide the occasional prompt – instead letting them expand on a particular topic. Sometimes, a person would warm to this style with unpredictable results. For example, he regards his chats with Shirley MacLaine as bordering on flirtatious. In his final programme, broadcast 22 December 2007, Parkinson stated that one of his most memorable interviews was with Jacob Bronowski in 1973.

==Guests==
By his own reckoning, Parkinson interviewed over 2,000 of the world&#x27;s most famous people, including: Anthony Hopkins, Barry White, Barry, Robin and Maurice Gibb, Ben Elton, Bette Midler, Billie Piper, Billy Connolly, Bing Crosby, Bob Hawke, Bob Hope, Bonnie Tyler, Buddy Rich, Cameron Diaz, Celine Dion, Cher, Clint Eastwood, Dame Edna Everage, Daniel Craig, Dave Allen, David Attenborough, David Beckham, David Bowie, David Tennant, Denzel Washington, Diana Ross, Dudley Moore, Dustin Hoffman, Edith Evans, Elaine Stritch, Elton John, Eric Idle, Ewan McGregor, Freddie Starr, Gary Glitter, Gene Wilder, George Best, George Michael, Geri Halliwell, Gough Whitlam, Gillian Anderson, Harold Wilson, Helen Mirren, Ingrid Bergman, Jack Lemmon, Jennifer Lopez, Jeremy Clarkson, Joan Collins, Joan Rivers, John Cleese, John Lennon, Jon Pertwee, Judi Dench, Julie Andrews, Justin Timberlake, Kate Winslet, k.d. lang, Kenneth Williams, Leslie Thomas, Liberace, Luciano Pavarotti, Madonna, Malcolm Fraser, Mark Knopfler, Mel Gibson, Michael Caine, Michael Crawford, Michael Palin, Miss Piggy, Morecambe and Wise, Muhammad Ali, Naomi Campbell, Nicholas Lyndhurst, Noel Gallagher, Oliver Reed, Olivia Newton-John, Ozzy Osbourne, Paul McCartney, Paul Schrader, Peter Cook, Peter Kay, Peter Sellers, Peter Ustinov, Phil Collins, Pierce Brosnan, Raquel Welch, Ray Winstone, Richard Attenborough, Richard Burton, Richard Harris, Ricky Hatton, Robbie Coltrane, Robin Williams, Robert Redford, Rod Stewart, Ronnie Barker, Rowan Atkinson, Sandra Bullock, Sarah, Duchess of York, Sean Connery, Shane Warne, Sharon Osbourne, Shirley MacLaine, Simon Cowell, Thierry Henry, Tina Turner, Tom Cruise, Tom Hanks, Tom Lehrer, Tommy Cooper, Tony Blair, Trevor McDonald, Victoria Beckham, Viggo Mortensen, and Walter Matthau.

During the 1970s, he attracted former big-name Hollywood stars, such as Fred Astaire, Orson Welles, James Stewart, John Wayne, Mickey Rooney, David Niven, Gene Kelly, James Cagney and Robert Mitchum, not on the basis that they had a film to promote, but simply because they wanted a chat. Despite this, Parkinson has since asserted that then as now, &quot;there was just as much plugging in the seventies as at any time later. To suggest otherwise is to misunderstand the reason people come on to talk shows.&quot; In particular, he cites Bette Davis as being the guest who &quot;more than anyone, made it clear she was there to plug a product, not because she was, or ever would be, your buddy.&quot;

Many guests appeared more than once and others on numerous occasions, Peter Ustinov was a guest on eight occasions. The record for most appearances is held by Scottish comedian Billy Connolly, having been a guest on fifteen occasions. His final appearance was in Parkinson&#x27;s penultimate show, broadcast on 16 December 2007.

===Rod Hull and Emu===

Much to his chagrin, the most repeated clip is of Parkinson&#x27;s interview with entertainer Rod Hull in 1976. While the pair were chatting, Hull&#x27;s glove puppet, Emu, continually and (apparently) uncontrollably attacked the interviewer, eventually causing him to fall off his chair. Fellow guest Billy Connolly threatened, &quot;If that bird comes anywhere near me, I&#x27;ll break its neck and your bloody arm!&quot; Hull swiftly got his &quot;pet&quot; back on best behaviour. Parkinson had always lamented the fact that despite all the star guests he had interviewed over the years, he would probably be remembered for &quot;that bloody bird&quot;. However, in an appearance on the TV show &quot;Room 101&quot;, he got his chance of revenge when the host, Paul Merton, unexpectedly brought Emu locked in a guillotine on stage and Parkinson took his chance by beheading the puppet, saying, &quot;Goodbye, you foul beast.&quot;

==Notable moments==

*On his appearance in the 1970s series, Orson Welles insisted that Parkinson dispose of his list of questions beforehand, reassuring him, &quot;We&#x27;ll talk.&quot;
*Reticent about discussing himself, Peter Sellers agreed to take part only if he were allowed to walk on as someone else. Once introduced, he appeared dressed as a member of the Gestapo, impersonating Kenneth Mars&#x27; role in &quot;The Producers&quot;, and performed a number of lines in character before removing his &quot;mask&quot;. He then settled down for what is arguably one of Parkinson&#x27;s most memorable interviews.
*Richard Burton&#x27;s chat had to be recorded during the afternoon, for fear that the notorious drinker would be inebriated by the evening if allowed sufficient access to alcohol. Accordingly, the audience was hastily convened and as a result, mainly comprised staff of the BBC canteen – still in their kitchen whites. Burton confessed afterwards that the view from the studio floor as he walked on made him think that the &quot;men in white coats&quot; had caught up with him at last.
*During Kenneth Williams&#x27; second appearance in 1973, the talk turned to politics, and particularly the &quot;Carry On&quot; star&#x27;s unsympathetic views of trade unions. Williams accepted an invitation to return three weeks later and discuss these with trade unionist Jimmy Reid. The hostile nature of their debate turned an entertainment show into something more akin to a serious current affairs programme, and the then Controller of BBC One Paul Fox, directed that the programme was not to venture into that sort of territory again. However, Williams would become one of Parkinson&#x27;s most celebrated guests, making a total of eight appearances over the years.
*In the interview with Helen Mirren in 1975 Parkinson suggested that her good &quot;figure&quot; could detract from her performance. Parkinson&#x27;s attitude during the interview has been described as sexist by Mirren and many others. Although Mirren spoke dismissively about Parkinson in later interviews, she also laid part of the blame on the Zeitgeist, the seventies being a &quot;perilous&quot; period for women. &quot;I feel it’s of its time, and of its time it’s embarrassing,&quot; Parkinson told Piers Morgan in 2019. &quot;It was over the top, absolutely so.&quot;
*Parkinson stated that the most remarkable man he ever interviewed was Muhammad Ali, who appeared four times on the show. During one appearance, the famously articulate Ali launched into an extraordinary tirade when Parkinson challenged him on the nature of his religious beliefs. This caused Parkinson to be lost for words.
*Parkinson witnessed David Niven being physically sick in his dressing room shortly before his interview. The actor informed him that he had always suffered with nerves. However, once before the cameras, he proved to be an accomplished raconteur.
*John Conteh was on the same show as Peter Cook and Dudley Moore. Parkinson asked the boxer if it was true that he never had sex before a fight. While Conteh looked embarrassed, Cook chipped in with an observation for the host: &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t ask you if you have sex before a show. I can see that you have.&quot;
*When comedian Dave Allen appeared in an edition that was transmitted on Halloween in 1981, Parkinson invited his guest to read a suitably themed poem. As he did so in his familiar Irish brogue, and as the ghostly nature of the words became ever more unsettling, the studio lights were gradually dimmed, leaving just a spotlight on Allen. After completing the final line (&quot;And now, as the witching hour approaches...&quot;) with much gravitas, he paused, before exclaiming, &quot;What a load of crap!&quot;
*When the show was relaunched on the BBC in 1998, the star guest on the first programme was Sir Anthony Hopkins, who demonstrated his talent for mimicry by telling several Tommy Cooper jokes. The studio audience was very appreciative, and Parkinson was visibly gratified to the actor for getting his new series off to a good start.
*On the programme featuring John Prescott, his own interview was followed by one with Phil Collins. However, the UK&#x27;s Deputy Prime Minister interjected frequently and at great length during Parkinson&#x27;s chat with the musician. The exasperated host finally pleaded, &quot;May I have my guest back, please?&quot;
*Before being interviewed as a well-known comedian in his own right, Peter Kay was once a warm-up act for the &quot;Parkinson&quot; studio audience. In 2005, Parkinson returned the compliment by appearing alongside other UK celebrities such as Ronnie Corbett, Jim Bowen, Geoffrey Hayes and Shakin&#x27; Stevens on Kay&#x27;s video with Tony Christie for their number one single, &quot;(Is This the Way to) Amarillo&quot;.
*In 1999, Woody Allen was visibly disturbed when the line of questioning turned to details of the custody battle for his children.
*In October 2003, while in the UK to promote her film &quot;In the Cut&quot;, Meg Ryan made a controversial appearance on &quot;Parkinson&quot;, which resulted in negative publicity. The press accused both Ryan and Parkinson of being rude to one another. Ryan gave a few one-word answers, and after she acknowledged that she wasn&#x27;t comfortable with the interview, Parkinson asked her what she would do if she were in his position now. She replied that she would &quot;just wrap it up&quot;. Parkinson later revealed to the press that he felt her behaviour to his earlier guests, Trinny Woodall and Susannah Constantine, whom she turned her back on, was &quot;unforgivable&quot;. Ryan also commented that Parkinson was a &quot;nut&quot; and said that she was &quot;offended&quot; by him as he was like a &quot;disapproving father&quot; in his tone. In a 2006 survey of British TV viewers, her behaviour on the show was voted the third &quot;most shocking&quot; TV chat show moment ever.
*In an episode broadcast on ITV on 4 March 2006, Tony Blair became the first serving Prime Minister to be interviewed by Parkinson and volunteered the information that he believed he would be judged by God for the Iraq War. He also told of how Cherie Blair&#x27;s father (Tony Booth) had asked if he could light a marijuana joint when they first met.
*Parkinson was once asked if there was anyone that he regretted never having interviewed. He replied, &quot;Sinatra was the one that got away. Otherwise, I&#x27;ve met everyone I have ever wanted to meet.&quot;

<text>The sittellas are a family, Neosittidae, of small passerine birds found only in Australasia. They resemble nuthatches, but whilst they were considered to be in that family for many years they are now afforded their own family. They do not migrate other than for local movements.

The sittellas are small woodland birds with thin pointed down-curved bills, which they use to extricate insects from bark. Nests are open cups in forked branches.

They were formerly classified in two separate genera with the black sittella in &quot;Daphoenositta&quot; and the varied and Papuan sittellas in &quot;Neositta&quot;. The two genera are now usually merged, with &quot;Daphoenositta&quot; having priority.

==Evolution and taxonomy==
The true evolutionary affinities of the sittellas have long been clouded by their close resemblance to the Northern Hemisphere nuthatches. As late as 1967 the sittellas were retained in that family by some authorities, although doubts about that placement had been voiced in the previous decades. Both their climbing technique and overall morphology are extremely similar; however they differ both in their sociality and their nesting behaviour, as sittellas create nests on branches whereas nuthatches nest in cavities in trees. In addition the specifics of the morphology of the leg differed, with sittellas having leg muscles more similar to those of the honeyeaters. Their placement was then moved to various families, including the Old World babblers (an infamous wastebasket taxon), the true treecreepers (Certhiidae, which range across the Holarctic and Africa) and the Australian treecreepers (Climacteridae). Their relationship with the Australian radiation of passerines was suggested by S.A. Parker on the basis of egg colour, nest structure and nestling plumage, and their position in this radiation was vindicated by Sibley and Ahlquist&#x27;s DNA–DNA hybridization studies. These researchers placed the sittellas in a monotypic tribe within the superfamily Corvoidea. Today they are afforded their own family in a clade close to the berrypeckers and longbills (Melanocharitidae) and the whistlers (Pachycephalidae). A molecular genetic study published in 2019 found that the family Neosittidae was sister to the family Mohouidae containing the yellowhead, whitehead and pipipi.

The sittellas comprise a single genus, &quot;Daphoenositta&quot;, which contains two species. The two species were once considered to be two genera, but when the two were lumped the genus name of the less well known black sittella was adopted (due to priority), while the family retained the family name based on the junior synonym (&quot;Neositta&quot;). The most common species, the varied sittella, was once thought to represent several separate species, including five species in Australia, but in spite of considerable variation in plumage there are extensive zones of hybridization where the forms overlap (including an area of Queensland where all five Australian subspecies exist), and are now thought to be a single species with eleven subspecies. The black sittella has three recognized subspecies.

&quot;Daphoenositta trevorworthyi&quot; is a fossil sittella species from the middle Miocene, representing the oldest known fossil record of the sittella family. The species was described from a distal tibiotarsus discovered in the Riversleigh World Heritage Area in northwestern Queensland, Australia.

==Species==

==Morphology==

The two species of sittella are small passerines which resemble nuthatches in appearance. The wings are long and broad, and when spread have clearly fingered tips. The family has a generally weak flight, which may explain their inability to colonize suitable habitat on islands like Tasmania. The legs are short but they have long toes, but in spite of their lifestyle they show little adaptation towards climbing. They have short tails and are between 10 and 14 cm in length and 8 and 20 g in weight, the black sittella tending to be slightly larger and heavier. The bill is dagger shaped in the case of the black sittella and slightly upturned in the varied sittella. The plumage of the black sittella is mostly black with a red face; that of the varied sittella is more complex, with the numerous subspecies having many variations on the theme. The sexes of some subspecies have entirely black heads, other white, and others dark crowns and paler throats. The backs of most subspecies are grey with darker wings, and the undersides are generally streaked or white. All sittellas exhibit some sexual dimorphism in plumage.

===Vocalizations===
The calls of sittellas are generally simple and uncomplicated. Apparently the family has no need for long distance territorial calls, and the majority of calls are simple contact calls utilized to retain flock cohesion. The most commonly heard call is the &quot;chip&quot; contact call, although there also exists a rallying call (to call together the group), as well as begging calls issued by incubating females.

==Habitat and behaviour==
The sittellas are social and generally restless birds of scrub, forests and woodlands. In Australia they generally avoid only the dense rainforest, whereas in New Guinea this is the only habitat they inhabit, avoiding only lowland forest. They generally live at low densities, between 0.1 and 0.6 birds per hectare, and are sedentary. The sittellas are generally highly social, usually being found in groups of five or more individuals and only more rarely in pairs. Studies of varied sittellas in New South Wales suggest that they live in clans of eight to twelve individuals and defend mutual territories against other groups. Within the groups, mutual preening is common, and in the evening the groups roost communally as well. Birds traveling to the evening roosts do so at slightly different times, timing their arrival at 30–60 second intervals, presumably so as not to attract the attention of potential predators. Roost sites are usually high in trees on slightly inclined dead branches. All the birds in the group roost next to each other, touching, and facing the same direction. Amongst Australian birds varied sittellas are usually the first to arrive at roost sites in the evening and the last to leave in the morning, although they are not necessarily the first to sleep or last to wake. At the roost site the position occupied along the branch is generally not random; instead males generally adopt positions at the edges of the group whilst young birds tend to be found in the centre.

===Diet and foraging===
The principal component of the diet of sittellas are insects and other arthropods. In one study in New South Wales adult beetles were the most common component (~36%) of the varied sittella&#x27;s diet; particularly favoured were weevils, ladybirds, leaf beetles (Chrysomelidae) and click beetles (Elateridae). A further quarter of the diet was composed of spiders and true bugs. Also taken were beetle and moth larvae, grasshoppers, termites, wasps and bees. Ants were taken relatively infrequently compared to other Australasian birds in similar niches. The proportion of any one item in the diet apparently varies geographically and seasonally, for example another study found that beetle larvae composed 87% of the diet. The diet of the black sittella has, like other aspects of its biology, been little studied, although the stomach contents of one that were examined contained caterpillars and spiders.

Sittellas forage on horizontal branches and the trunks of trees. Their foraging techniques has been described as hopping rapidly along the length of a horizontal branch, pausing briefly to peer for prey, and occasionally hanging underneath the branch but usually on top of it. Most of the time is spent on branches rather than on the trunks. Birds on the trunks may travel upwards or downwards. Within the forest sittellas usually forage in the canopy. There are sexual differences in foraging, with males and females choosing to forage in slightly different microhabitats within the tree. Prey items are usually gleaned directly from the bark, although in a few instances sittellas will sally from the branch in order to snatch aerial prey. Having obtained prey sittellas will use their feet to hold it while they eat it, in a similar manner to parrots, and will also use their feet in order to hold back strips of bark in order to pry underneath it. There have even been isolated reports of tool use in some populations of sittellas. Sticks were used to pry boring beetle larvae out of cavities, in a similar fashion to that of tool using woodpecker finches of the Galápagos Islands.

===Breeding===
Very little is known about the breeding of either of the two species of sittella in New Guinea, although black sittellas in breeding condition have been observed August and May, suggesting that they may either be biannual breeders or year round breeders. The varied sittella populations in Australia are cooperative breeders (and the group composition of black sittellas suggest they are too), and possibly have to be in order to be successful. There is some evidence that not only to groups cooperate in raising the young, not an uncommon strategy in birds, but have a plural breeding system, where more than one pair inside the group nest, and the group help raise both broods. There have even been instances of two females sharing a nest.

95% of the nests found in a study in New South Wales were in stringybarks, particularly the species &quot;Eucalyptus macrorhycha&quot;. The nests were almost always located high in the tree. Nest construction took around 7 days, but lining and decorating the nest added a few days to this. Nest building duties were shared amongst the group, and the speed of construction depended on how many birds were involved. Nests are usually placed in the prong of two branches, and is a deep cup decorated in the bark of the tree it is built in, thereby camouflaging it. Around 2–3 eggs are laid and incubated by the breeding female (or females if two are sharing the nest) for 19–20 days. Whilst incubating the breeding female is fed by the breeding male and helpers. After hatching the female broods the young for a few days, and for up to two weeks at night. The chicks are fed for 19–20 days in the nest. After fledging the chicks have a protracted period of parental care lasting up to 80 days, although 60 days is more usual.

<doc id="380874" wikidata="Q1432469" url="?curid=380874" title="Metropolitan Borough of Hampstead">
<text>Hampstead was a civil parish and metropolitan borough in London, England. It was an ancient parish in the county of Middlesex, governed by an administrative vestry. The parish was included in the area of responsibility of the Metropolitan Board of Works in 1855 and became part of the County of London in 1889. The parish of Hampstead became a metropolitan borough in 1900, following the London Government Act 1899, with the parish vestry replaced by a borough council. In 1965 the borough was abolished and its former area became part of the London Borough of Camden in Greater London.

==Geography==
It included Primrose Hill, Hampstead, Belsize Park, West Hampstead, South Hampstead, much of Hampstead Heath and part of Kilburn and Cricklewood. Some street signs still bear the &#x27;Borough of Hampstead&#x27; name.

== Ecclesiastical parish ==

The ancient parish, was originally dedicated to St Mary, but in 1747 it was rededicated to St John. It was in the Diocese of London. From 1852, as the population of Hampstead increased, a number of new parishes were formed:
* Christ Church, Hampstead. in 1852
* St Saviour, Haverstock Hill, in 1856
* St Mary, Kilburn in 1856
* St Peter, Belsize Park in 1859
* St Paul, Avenue Road in 1864
* St Stephen, Hampstead in 1869
* Trinity, West Hampstead in 1872, (renamed Holy Trinity in c.1930)
* St Mary the Virgin, Primrose Hill in 1873
* Emmanuel, West Hampstead in 1885
* St Cuthbert, West Hampstead in 1886
* St James, West Hampstead in 1888
* St Luke, West Hampstead in 1898

In addition, as the population of neighbouring areas increased, parts of Hampstead parish were included in new parishes:
* All Souls, St John&#x27;s Wood in 1865 &quot;with parts of All Saints, St John&#x27;s Wood&quot;
* St Augustine, Kilburn in 1870 &quot;with parts of St Mark, Marylebone and St Saviour, Paddington&quot;

==Coat of arms==

The arms were granted in 1931, and are based on a device used by the Hampstead Vestry without authority, and adopted by the Council on its formation in 1900.

The mitre stands for the Westminster Abbey, to which the Manor of Hampstead was granted by Ethelred the Unready in 986, and remained in its possession until 1539. The fleurs-de-lys and stag&#x27;s head are from the arms of the Hickes family, one of whom, Viscount Camden, purchased the Manor. On his death in 1629 it passed to the Noel family from whose arms are taken the fretty chief. The Manor was sold to Sir William Langthorne in 1707, who is represented by the white cross and red fleurs-de-lys from his arms.

The holly is from the seal of the old Hampstead Vestry, which grows profusely in the area.

Charges from these arms were used, together with charges from the coats of arms of Holborn and of St. Pancras, when the new coat of arms of the London Borough of Camden was designed in 1965.

The former coat of arms can still be seen on Hampstead War Memorial.

==Population and area==

The metropolitan borough was conterminous with the Vestry authority, when it was formed in 1900. Statistics compiled by the London County Council, in 1901 to show the population growth in London, over the preceding century.

Hampstead had an area of in 1901. The populations recorded in National Censuses were:

Hampstead Vestry 1801-1899

Metropolitan Borough 1900-1961
==Politics==

Under the Metropolis Management Act 1855 any parish that exceeded 2,000 ratepayers was to be divided into wards; however the parish of St John Hampstead did not exceed this number so was not divided into wards. By 1873 its population had increased enough for the incorporated vestry to be divided into four wards (electing vestrymen): No. 1 (18), No. 2 (15), No. 3 (15) and No. 4 (12).

In 1894 as its population had increased further so the incorporated vestry was re-divided into five wards (electing vestrymen): Town (18), Belsize (12), Adelaide (9), Kilburn (21) and West End (12).

The metropolitan borough was divided into seven wards for elections: Adelaide, Belsize, Central, Kilburn, Priory, Town and West End.

===Parliament constituency===
For elections to Parliament, the borough was represented by one constituency:
*Hampstead

It is the most populous municipality in Finland, and the 16th most populous urban area in the country.

Kotka is situated in the southern part of the Kymenlaakso province of Finland. Kotka is a major port and industrial city situated on the coast of the Gulf of Finland. Kotka is a culturally diverse city with a variety of schools. It was previously a part of the former Kymi parish. Kymi, Haapasaari island, and Karhula, which was once a separate market town, were later incorporated into Kotka. Kotka&#x27;s neighboring municipalities are Hamina, Kouvola, and Pyhtää. Kotka is situated in the Kotka-Hamina subdivision and, along with Kouvola, is one of the main centres of the Kymenlaakso region.

The city centre of Kotka is located on an island in the sea called Kotkansaari (&quot;Island of Kotka&quot;). The main road in Kotka is the Finnish national road 7 (E18), which runs west through Porvoo to Helsinki, the capital of Finland, and extends east to St. Petersburg, Russia.

==Heraldry==

The description of the older coat of arms read that &quot;the upper field of the split shield is blue, the lower field silver, and in the center of the shield a natural stone with a golden eagle, and in the lower field the anchor and caduceus diagonally crossed, both blue,&quot; while the current coat of arms is described as follows: &quot;In a blue field, the wings of a golden natural eagle are raised, standing with a crossed anchor and caduceus, both of which are silver.&quot; The first coat of arms of the city of Kotka was confirmed in 1881. However, the Kotka City Council had to renew the old coat of arms in 1954 because it did not meet heraldic requirements. The new coat of arms was designed by Olof Eriksson in 1957, Eriksson kept the new coat of arms as the main emblem of Kotka referring to the name of the city. From the images of the current coat of arms, the anchor reflects the importance of Kotka as a port town and caduceus in trade, industry and maritime traffic.

<doc id="380886" wikidata="Q1475656" url="?curid=380886" title="Selfridges">
<text>Selfridges, also known as Selfridges &amp; Co., is a chain of upmarket department stores in the United Kingdom that is operated by Selfridges Retail Limited. It was founded by Harry Gordon Selfridge in 1908. The historic Daniel Burnham-designed Selfridges flagship store at 400 Oxford Street in London opened on 15 March 1909 and is the second-largest shop in the UK (after Harrods). Other Selfridges stores opened in the Manchester area at the Trafford Centre (1998) and at Exchange Square (2002), and in Birmingham at the Bullring (2003).

During the 1940s, smaller provincial Selfridges stores were sold to the John Lewis Partnership, and in 1951, the original Oxford Street store was acquired by the Liverpool-based Lewis&#x27;s chain of department stores. Lewis&#x27;s and Selfridges were then taken over in 1965 by the Sears Group, owned by Charles Clore. Expanded under the Sears Group to include branches in Manchester and Birmingham, the chain was acquired in 2003 by Canada&#x27;s Galen Weston for £598 million. In December 2021, the Weston family agreed to sell the majority of Selfridges Group for around £4 billion to a joint venture between Thai conglomerate Central Group and Austria&#x27;s Signa Holding. The acquisition was completed on 23 August 2022. However, after Signa faced financial difficulties and declared bankruptcy, Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Public Investment Fund (PIF) acquired Signa&#x27;s shares in Selfridges, becoming a co-owner alongside the Central Group.

==History==

The basis of Harry Gordon Selfridge&#x27;s success was his relentlessly innovative marketing, which was elaborately expressed in his Oxford Street store. Originally from America himself, Selfridge attempted to dismantle the idea that consumerism was strictly an American phenomenon. He tried to make shopping a fun adventure and a form of leisure instead of a chore, transforming the department store into a social and cultural landmark that provided women with a public space in which they could be comfortable and legitimately indulge themselves. Emphasizing the importance of creating a welcoming environment, he placed merchandise on display so customers could examine it, and moved the highly profitable perfume counter front-and-centre on the ground floor.

Either Selfridge or Marshall Field is popularly held to have coined the phrase &quot;the customer is always right&quot;.

In 1909, after the first cross-Channel flight, Louis Blériot&#x27;s monoplane was put on display at Selfridges, where it was seen by 150,000 people over a four day period. John Logie Baird made the first public demonstration of moving silhouette images by television from the first floor of Selfridges from 1 to 27 April 1925.

In the 1920s and 1930s, the roof of the store hosted terraced gardens, cafes, a mini golf course and an all-girl gun club. The roof, with its extensive views across London, was a common place for strolling after a shopping trip and was often used for fashion shows.

During the Second World War, the store&#x27;s basement was used as an air-raid shelter and during raids employees were usually on the lookout for incendiary bombs and took watch in turns.

A Milne-Shaw seismograph was set up on the Oxford Street store&#x27;s third floor in 1932, attached to one of the building&#x27;s main stanchions, where it remained unaffected by traffic or shoppers. It successfully recorded the Belgian earthquake of 11 June 1938, which was also felt in London. In 1947, it was given to the Science Museum.

The huge SIGSALY scrambling apparatus, by which transatlantic conferences between American and British officials (most notably Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt) were secured against eavesdropping, was housed in the basement from 1943 on, with extension to the Cabinet War Rooms about a mile away.

In 1926, Selfridges set up the Selfridge Provincial Stores company, which had expanded over the years to include sixteen provincial stores, but these were sold to the John Lewis Partnership in 1940. The Liverpool-based Lewis&#x27;s chain of department stores acquired the remaining Oxford Street Shop in 1951, expanding the brand by adding Moultons of Ilford, purchased from rival chain R H O Hills and renaming the store Selfridges. In 1965 the business was purchased by the Sears Group, owned by Charles Clore. Under the Sears group, branches in Ilford and Oxford opened, with the latter remaining Selfridges until 1986, when Sears rebranded it as a Lewis&#x27;s store. In 1990, Sears Group split Selfridges from Lewis&#x27;s and placed Lewis&#x27;s in administration a year later. In March 1998, Selfridges introduced new branding in tandem with the opening of the Manchester Trafford Centre store and Selfridges&#x27; demerger from Sears.

In September 1998, Selfridges expanded and opened its first department store outside London. A anchor store at the newly opened Trafford Centre in Greater Manchester. Following its success, Selfridges announced they would open an additional store in Greater Manchester. A store in Exchange Square, Manchester city centre. The Exchange Square store opened in 2002 as Manchester city centre started to return to normal following the 1996 Manchester bombing.

A store soon followed in 2003 at Birmingham&#x27;s Bull Ring.

Plans for expansion and additional stores continued soon after. Desired locations included Leeds, Liverpool, Dublin and Glasgow. The company purchased a site in Glasgow in 2002 and announced a new 200,000 sq ft Scottish flagship store was due to open in 2007. The following year all expansion plans were put on hold as the company began negotiations to sell the business. The Glasgow site was eventually sold off in 2013 and no plans to open any future stores has been announced - as of 2023.

In 2003, the chain was acquired by Canada&#x27;s Galen Weston for £598 million and some of his other investments, which included Brown Thomas and Arnotts in Ireland, Holt Renfrew in Canada and de Bijenkorf in the Netherlands, became part of Selfridges Group. Weston, a retailing expert who is the owner of Loblaw Companies in Canada, chose to invest in the renovation of the Oxford Street store—rather than to create new stores in British cities other than Manchester and Birmingham.

In October 2009, Selfridges revived its rooftop entertainment with the pop up &quot;The Restaurant on the Roof&quot; restaurant. In July 2011, Truvia created an emerald green boating lake (with a waterfall, a boat-up cocktail bar and a forest of Stevia plants). In 2012 the Big Rooftop Tea and Golf Party featured &quot;the highest afternoon tea on Oxford Street&quot; and a nine-hole golf course with &quot;the seven wonders of London&quot; realised in cake as obstacles.

In August 2020, during a difficult time for UK retail, Selfridges offered luxury pieces for hire to millennial and socially conscious clients. The store partnered with HURR, an online fashion rental platform, offering hire of 100 items from over 40 fashion brands for up to 20 days at a time.

The Weston family put the Selfridges business up for auction in July 2021, with an estimated value of £4 billion. The sale includes all stores including the flagship Oxford Street store and worldwide outlets. In early December 2021, the family was reported to be finalising the chain&#x27;s sale to Central Group.

On 24 December 2021, it was announced that the majority of Selfridges Group had been sold to a joint venture between Thai conglomerate Central Group and the Austrian Signa Holding for around £4 billion.

In 2024, Thailand&#x27;s Central Group partnered with Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Public Investment Fund (PIF) to co-own the Selfridges Group. After Signa&#x27;s bankruptcy, PIF acquired its shares, leaving Central Group with a 60% stake and PIF with 40%.

==Architecture==

Selfridge stores are known for architectural innovation and excellence, and are tourist destinations in their own right. The original London store was designed by Daniel Burnham, who also created the Marshall Field&#x27;s main store in his home town of Chicago. Burnham was the leading American department store designer of the time and had works in Boston (Filenes&#x27;s), New York (Gimbel&#x27;s, Wanamaker&#x27;s), and Philadelphia (Wanamaker&#x27;s, his &quot;magnum opus&quot;).

The London store was built in phases. The first phase consisted of only the nine-and-a-half bays closest to the Duke Street corner, and is an example of one of the earliest uses of steel cage frame construction for this type of building in London. This circumstance, according to the report of a contemporary London correspondent from the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, was largely responsible for making possible the eventual widespread use of Chicago’s steel frame cage construction system in the United Kingdom:

Also involved in the design of the store were American architect Francis Swales, who worked on decorative details, and British architects R. Frank Atkinson and Thomas Smith Tait. The distinctive polychrome sculpture above the Oxford Street entrance is the work of British sculptor Gilbert Bayes.

&quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; named Selfridges in London the world&#x27;s best department store in 2010.
The Birmingham store, designed by architects Future Systems, is covered in 15,000 spun aluminium discs on a background of Yves Klein Blue. Since it opened in 2003, the Birmingham store has been named every year by industry magazine Retail Week as one of the 100 stores to visit in the world.

==Windows==
Selfridges&#x27; windows have become synonymous also with the brand, and to a certain degree have become as famous as the company and Oxford Street location itself. Selfridges has a history of bold art initiatives when it comes to the window designs. Selfridge himself likened the act of shopping to the act of attending the theatre and encouraged his customers to make this connection as well by covering his show windows with silk curtains before dramatically unveiling the displays on opening day. Later, when the building was undergoing restoration, the scaffolding was shrouded with a giant photograph of stars such as Sir Elton John by Sam Taylor-Wood. For Christmas 2014, the window displayed a Kate Moss-designed Paddington Bear statue—themed &quot;Goldie Bear&quot;—which was auctioned to raise funds for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC).

Since 2002, the windows have been photographed by London photographer Andrew Meredith and published in magazines such as &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Dwell&quot;, &quot;Icon&quot;, &quot;Frame&quot;, &quot;Creative Review&quot;, &quot;Hungarian Stylus Magazine&quot;, &quot;Design Week&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;WGSN&quot; as well as many worldwide media outlets, including the world wide press, journals, blogs and published books.

==Opening day and marketing==

The long lasting influence that Harry Selfridge would have on shopping and department stores became immediately clear with Selfridges&#x27; opening day. The store’s opening to much fanfare on 15 March 1909 laid the foundation for the success of the entire lifestyle that Selfridge aimed to promote. Even before the unveiling of the window displays, innovative marketing techniques set up the momentous occasion and the store for great success.

Harry Selfridge developed close relationships with the media to ensure that his store and its opening were properly publicized. The opening week ad campaign relied mainly on unpaid promotions in the form of news articles in newspapers, magazines, and journals. As time progressed, Selfridge took the more traditional form of marketing by writing daily columns under the pen name Callisthenes. Overall, however, one of the most effective marketing tools proved to be the opening week cartoons focusing on the grand event. Selfridge enlisted the help of thirty-eight of London’s top illustrators to draw hundreds of full page, half page, and quarter page advertisements for eighteen newspapers.

The marketing continued on opening day itself. Touted as “London’s Greatest Store,” Selfridges immediately became a cultural and social phenomenon. From the store&#x27;s soft lighting to the general absence of price tags to live music from string quartets, every detail of the opening was purposeful to draw people into the entire shopping experience and make each shopper feel unique. At Selfridges, shoppers entered another world in which they became &quot;guests,&quot; as the store referred to them, and could purchase unique items that differed from the material goods sold in other stores.

==Controversies==
* After protests by animal welfare advocates, in November 2009 Selfridges agreed to stop selling foie gras (a delicacy made from the livers of forcibly fattened ducks and geese).
* In July 2010, Selfridges apologized publicly after its Manchester store displayed an Alexander McQueen garment hanging from a gallows-like structure, just months after the designer committed suicide by hanging.
* In September 2013, the store suspended a shop assistant who refused to serve a friend of Tommy Robinson.
* In February 2015, one of Selfridges&#x27; stores in Manchester installed so-called anti-homeless spikes.

==In culture==
ITV and Masterpiece produced a series entitled &quot;Mr Selfridge&quot;, which aired from 2013 to 2016. 

Selfridges was also featured in the 2017 movie &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; as the shop where Steve Trevor takes Diana Prince to give her a more contemporary appearance to blend in.

The brand has worked with artists like Jaden Smith and others throughout its history.

<text>The Hungerford Bridge crosses the River Thames in London, and lies between Waterloo Bridge and Westminster Bridge. Owned by Network Rail Infrastructure Ltd (who use its official name of Charing Cross Bridge) it is a steel truss railway bridge flanked by two more recent, cable-stayed, pedestrian bridges that share the railway bridge&#x27;s foundation piers, and which are named the Golden Jubilee Bridges.

The north end of the bridge is Charing Cross railway station, and is near Embankment Pier and the Victoria Embankment. The south end is near Waterloo station, County Hall, the Royal Festival Hall, and the London Eye. Each pedestrian bridge has steps and lift access.

==History==

The first Hungerford Bridge, designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, opened in 1845 as a suspension footbridge. It was named after the then Hungerford Market, because it went from the South Bank, specifically a northern point of Lambeth, soon close to London Waterloo station to that place on the north side of the Thames, specifically to the market (later Charing Cross Station) about 200 yards or metres east of Trafalgar Square partly in the parish of Saint Martin in the Fields, Westminster, the spire of which can be seen from the bridge.

In 1859 the original bridge was bought by the railway company extending the South Eastern Railway into the newly opened Charing Cross railway station. The railway company replaced the suspension bridge with a structure designed by Sir John Hawkshaw, comprising nine spans made of wrought iron lattice girders, which opened in 1864. The chains from the old bridge were re-used in Bristol&#x27;s Clifton Suspension Bridge. The original brick pile buttresses of Brunel&#x27;s footbridge are still in use, though the one on the Charing Cross side is now much closer to the river bank than it was originally, due to the building of the Victoria Embankment, completed in 1870. The buttress on the South Bank side still has the entrances and steps from the original steamer pier Brunel built on to the footbridge.

To compensate for the removal of the footbridge, walkways were added on each side, with the western one later being removed when the railway was widened. Another walkway was temporarily added in 1951 when an Army Bailey bridge was constructed for the Festival of Britain. In 1980 a temporary walkway was erected on the western side while the eastern railway bridge and walkway were refurbished. It is one of three bridges in London to carry pedestrians and rolling stock; the others being Fulham Railway Bridge and Barnes Bridge.

The footbridge gained a reputation for being narrow, dilapidated and dangerous; it was the scene of a murder in 1999. In the mid-1990s a decision was made to replace the footbridge with new structures on either side of the existing railway bridge, and a competition was held in 1996 for a new design.

Further justification for new footbridge structures on the west flank and east flank was that the brittle wrought iron support pillars of Sir John Hawkshaw&#x27;s railway bridge were vulnerable to impact from riverboats. It was felt, especially following the Marchioness disaster, that these should be clad in concrete at water level; but the bridge&#x27;s owners, Railtrack, could not afford the work. The Golden Jubilee Bridges achieved this protection at no cost to Railtrack.

===2025 refurbishment===
In January 2025, a three-year project to refurbish Hungerford Bridge began. All the original metalwork will be retained and refurbished; engineers will test the truss pins – which join the supports together – and replace the pin end caps on the girders.

==The Golden Jubilee footbridges==

The concept design for the new footbridges was won by architects Lifschutz Davidson Sandilands and engineers WSP Group. Detailed design of the two bridges was carried out by consulting engineers Gifford, now Ramboll UK. The steelwork for the new footbridges was fabricated by Butterley Engineering Ltd. of Ripley, Derbyshire.

Their construction was complicated by the need to keep the railway bridge operating without interruptions, the Bakerloo line tunnels passing only a few feet under the river bed, and the potential danger of unexploded World War II bombs in the Thames mud. Despite extensive surveys of the riverbed, London Underground was unwilling to accept these risks and preliminary works were stopped in 2000. The design was modified so that the support structure on the north side, which would have been within of the tube lines, was moved out of the river bed and onto Victoria Embankment. Excavation near the tube lines was carried out when the tube was closed, and foundations were hand-dug for additional security.

The two new wide footbridges were completed in 2002. They were named the Golden Jubilee Bridges, in honour of the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II, although in practice they are often still referred to as the &quot;Hungerford Footbridges&quot;.

The long decks were raised using an innovative method called &quot;incremental launching&quot;, in which each long section was pulled across the river using a long steel truss weighing 300 tonnes. This process was repeated five times until each deck spanned the river, supported by six temporary piers made of steel and concrete. The seven 25-tonne pylons were then raised over the subsequent two weeks. Once the pylons had been installed, the decks were jacked up to enable their connection with the cable stays suspended from the pylons. The concrete deck was then lowered into its final position and the temporary piers and supports were dismantled.

The design of the bridges is complex. Each of the two decks is supported by inclined outward-leaning pylons. The decks are suspended from fans of slender steel rods called deck stays—there are 180 on each deck, made up of over of cable—and are held in position by other rods called backstays. Because the pylons lean the back stays are under tension. The deck is secured in place by steel collars fitted around (although not supported by) the pillars of the railway bridge; the collars are themselves attached to the bridge&#x27;s foundations by tie-down rods. The entire structure is thus held in place by exploiting the tensions between the pylons and the various stay rods and struts.
The new bridges won the Specialist category in the Royal Fine Art Commission Building of the Year Award in 2003. It gained a Structural Achievement Award commendation in the 2004 Institution of Structural Engineers awards, and has won awards from the Civic Trust and for its lighting design.

In 2014, the planning application for the now cancelled Garden Bridge, revealed in its assessment of pedestrian movement across the Thames that the footbridges are the busiest in London, with an estimated footfall of 8.5 million each year.

<doc id="380890" wikidata="Q941131" url="?curid=380890" title="Nanobacterium">
<text>Nanobacterium ( , pl. &quot;nanobacteria&quot; ) is the unit or member name of a former proposed class of living organisms, specifically cell-walled microorganisms, now discredited, with a size much smaller than the generally accepted lower limit for life (about 200 nm for bacteria, like mycoplasma). Originally based on observed nano-scale structures in geological formations (including the Martian meteorite Allan Hills 84001), the status of nanobacteria was controversial, with some researchers suggesting they are a new class of living organism capable of incorporating radiolabeled uridine, and others attributing to them a simpler, abiotic nature. One skeptic dubbed them &quot;the cold fusion of microbiology&quot;, in reference to a notorious episode of supposed erroneous science. The term &quot;calcifying nanoparticles&quot; (CNPs) has also been used as a conservative name regarding their possible status as a life form.

Research tends to agree that these structures exist, and appear to replicate in some way. However, the idea that they are living entities has now largely been discarded, and the particles are instead thought to be nonliving crystallizations of minerals and organic molecules.

==1981–2000==
In 1981 Francisco Torella and Richard Y. Morita described very small cells called ultramicrobacteria. Defined as being smaller than 300 nm, by 1982 MacDonell and Hood found that some could pass through a 200 nm membrane. Early in 1989, geologist Robert L. Folk found what he later identified as &quot;nannobacteria&quot; (written with double &quot;n&quot;), that is, nanoparticles isolated from geological specimens in travertine from hot springs of Viterbo, Italy. Initially searching for a bacterial cause for travertine deposition, scanning electron microscope examination of the mineral where no bacteria were detectable revealed extremely small objects which appeared to be biological. His first oral presentation elicited what he called &quot;mostly a stony silence&quot;, at the 1992 Geological Society of America&#x27;s annual convention. He proposed that nanobacteria are the principal agents of precipitation of all minerals and crystals on Earth formed in liquid water, that they also cause all oxidation of metals, and that they are abundant in many biological specimens.

In 1996, NASA scientist David McKay published a study suggesting the existence of nanofossils — fossils of Martian nanobacteria — in ALH84001, a meteorite originating from Mars and found in Antarctica.

&quot;Nanobacterium sanguineum&quot; was proposed in 1998 as an explanation of certain kinds of pathologic calcification (apatite in kidney stones) by Finnish researcher Olavi Kajander and Turkish researcher Neva Çiftçioğlu, working at the University of Kuopio in Finland. According to the researchers, the particles self-replicated in microbiological culture, and the researchers further reported having identified DNA in these structures by staining.

A paper published in 2000 by a team led by NIH scientist John Cisar further tested these ideas. It stated that what had previously been described as &quot;self-replication&quot; was a form of crystalline growth. The only DNA detected in his specimens was identified as coming from the bacteria &quot;Phyllobacterium myrsinacearum&quot;, which is a common contaminant in PCR reactions.

==2001–present==
In 2004, a Mayo Clinic team led by Franklin Cockerill, John Lieske, and Virginia M. Miller reported to have isolated nanobacteria from diseased human arteries and kidney stones. Their results were published in 2004 and 2006 respectively. Similar findings were obtained in 2005 by László Puskás at the University of Szeged, Hungary. Dr. Puskás identified these particles in cultures obtained from human atherosclerotic aortic walls and blood samples of atherosclerotic patients but the group was unable to detect DNA in these samples.

In 2005, Ciftcioglu and her research team at NASA used a rotating cell culture flask, which simulates some aspects of low-gravity conditions, to culture nanobacteria suspected of rapidly forming kidney stones in astronauts. In this environment, they were found to multiply five times faster than in normal Earth gravity. The study concluded that nanobacteria potentially have a role in forming kidney stones and may need to be screened for in crews pre-flight.

An article published to the &quot;Public Library of Science Pathogens&quot; (PLOS Pathogens) in February 2008 focused on the comprehensive characterization of nanobacteria. The authors claim that their results rule out the existence of nanobacteria as living entities and that they are instead a unique self-propagating entity, namely self-propagating mineral-fetuin complexes.

An article published to the &quot;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&quot; (PNAS) in April 2008 also reported that blood nanobacteria are not living organisms, and stated that &quot;CaCO3 precipitates prepared &quot;in vitro&quot; are remarkably similar to purported nanobacteria in terms of their uniformly sized, membrane-delineated vesicular shapes, with cellular division-like formations and aggregations in the form of colonies.&quot; The growth of such &quot;biomorphic&quot; inorganic precipitates was studied in detail in a 2009 &quot;Science&quot; paper, which showed that unusual crystal growth mechanisms can produce witherite precipitates from barium chloride and silica solutions that closely resemble primitive organisms. The authors commented on the close resemblance of these crystals to putative nanobacteria, stating that their results showed that evidence for life cannot rest on morphology alone.

Further work on the importance of nanobacteria in geology by R. L. Folk and colleagues includes study of calcium carbonate Bahama ooids, silicate clay minerals, metal sulfides, and iron oxides. In all of these chemically diverse minerals, the putative nanobacteria are approximately the same size, mainly 0.05–0.2 μm. This suggests a commonality of origin. At least for the type locality at Viterbo, Italy, the biogenicity of these minute cells has been supported by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Slices through a green bioslime showed entities 0.09–0.4 μm in diameter with definite cell walls and interior dots resembling ribosomes, and even smaller objects with cell walls and interiors with diameters of 0.05 μm. Culturable organisms on earth are the same 0.05 μm size as the supposed nanobacteria on Mars.

<text>The Carte network or Carte circuit or Carte organization was an early and illusory attempt at organizing French resistance to the occupation of France by Nazi Germany during the Second World War. The creator of Carte, André Girard, claimed to have &quot;plans in hand for preparing first sabotage teams, then larger guerrilla groups, and finally a private army some 300,000 strong&quot; to liberate France. Girard&#x27;s army existed mainly on paper and in the minds of a community of artists, musicians, and students living on the French Riviera. Girard persuaded the United Kingdom&#x27;s clandestine organization, the Special Operations Executive, (SOE) that his plan merited British help. Carte was eventually suppressed by the Germans and many of its members ended up in concentration camps or were executed.

==Carte and SOE==
The Carte network was the brainchild of André Girard, an artist living in Antibes on the French Riviera in 1941. Girard took the code name Carte which also became the name of his resistance network. In April 1941, he persuaded Henri Frager, an architect, to be his second in command and the pair set about recruiting intellectuals, soldiers, and others to become members of the network. Girard envisioned the recruitment of an army from anti-Nazi officers and men serving in the army of Vichy France to rise up against the German occupiers of France. For SOE headquarters in London it seemed &quot;that they had found what they were looking for; a ready-made secret army which only needed arms and orders before it was ready to co-operate in throwing the Germans out of France.&quot;

SOE agent Francis Basin made a first contact with Girard in late fall 1941 and agent Peter Churchill was sent to Antibes in January 1942 to assess Girard&#x27;s claims and the viability of Carte. Based on the reports by Basin and Churchill, in July 1942 Nicolas Bodington, second in command of SOE&#x27;s F section, landed in Vichy France. In September Bodington filed a report confirming his favourable opinion of the network. Maurice Buckmaster, leader of the French section of SOE, proposed an expansion of SOE to deal with Carte and approved a contribution of supplies and equipment. The potential of Carte was a &quot;dominating influence&quot; over the work of SOE&#x27;s French section in 1942, work that would come to naught.

The official historian of the SOE, M.R.D. Foot said that Girard &quot;combined an ingenious administrative talent with a total ignorance of security.&quot; The ignorance of security was soon demonstrated. Girard drew up in his Antibes apartment a list of more than 200 supporters or potential supporters of Carte. The list included their names, addresses, and other information. In November 1942, an assistant of Girard named André Marsac was carrying the list by train from Marseille to Paris to give it to SOE agent Francis Suttill. While Marsac slept on the train, an agent of Abwehr (German military intelligence) stole the briefcase which contained the list. The Germans did not immediately take action against Carte and the people on the list.

The danger to Carte and SOE in southern France increased when Germany occupied Vichy France in November 1942. Carte, however, fragmented prior to a German crackdown. Girard and his assistant Henri Frager quarreled, the final fracture between the two coming on January 2, 1943. SOE agent Peter Churchill had earlier arrived in southern France to evaluate the usefulness of the Carte network. He was impressed by the people he met but the disagreement between Girard and Frager made it necessary for SOE to choose between them. Churchill, having chosen Frager as preferable, took him to London in March 1943 to be briefed by SOE on his future role. After his arrival in France in March 1943, SOE agent Francis Cammaerts subsequently made a much more realistic appraisal of Carte. &quot;What I found,&quot; said Cammaerts, &quot;was musical comedy stuff: no concept of security whatsoever and wildly over-ambitious.&quot;

===Downfall===
Carte was doomed by its quixotic nature and the list of supporters the Germans had in their possession. German suppression of Carte began in March 1943 with a complicated plot. André Marsac, from whom the Carte list had been stolen by the Abwehr, was arrested near the Champs Élysées by Hugo Bleicher, a sergeant in the Abwehr, and incarcerated in Fresnes prison. Bleicher, posing as an anti-Nazi colonel, told Marsac that he wished to defect, and the pair concocted an elaborate scheme involving the co-operation of Marsac&#x27;s assistant Roger Bardet, who was persuaded by letter to visit Marsac in prison. The outcome of Bleicher&#x27;s deception was the arrest on 16 April 1943 of Churchill and his courier, Odette Sansom. A bonus was provided by Marsac, who supplied Bleicher with the addresses of some twenty clandestine networks in Bordeaux, Strasbourg and Marseille.

Henri Frager had returned to France to assume leadership of the new SOE Donkeyman circuit built on the remnants of Carte. Bardet, having been persuaded to betray Frager, was allowed to &#x27;escape&#x27; German control. Frager was taken in by the escape story. He also fell for Bardet&#x27;s offer to provide new forged identity papers for the British SOE agents working with him, and allowed photographs of the agents to be supplied to Bardet for that purpose. One of the agents was Vera Leigh. The &#x27;forged&#x27; papers were provided by the Germans. On 2 July 1944 Frager attended a rendezvous with Bleicher (again posing as the anti-Nazi colonel), and was arrested. The meeting had been arranged by Bardet. Having obtained his liberty and sensing that Germany would lose the war, Bardet eventually rejoined the resistance movement.

The Abwehr&#x27;s acquisition of Girard&#x27;s list in November 1942 would have further implications for other SOE agents not directly involved with Carte. Carte had given Francis Suttill, an SOE agent, a list of contacts which he used. He instructed his courier Andrée Borrel to contact two sisters, Geraldine and Madeleine Tambour in Paris. The sisters were known to several members of Suttill&#x27;s Prosper network who used them to pass on letters and held meetings in their Paris apartment. The sisters were arrested by the Gestapo in April 1943 which was the beginning of the destruction of the Prosper network and the execution of Suttill, Borrel and other members of the Prosper network.
