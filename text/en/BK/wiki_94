<text>The Panama Canal Railway (PCR, ) is a railway line linking the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean in Central America. The route stretches across the Isthmus of Panama from Colón (Atlantic) to Balboa (Pacific, near Panama City). Because of the difficult physical conditions of the route and state of technology, the construction was renowned as an international engineering achievement, one that cost US$8 million and the lives of an estimated 5,000 to 10,000 workers. Opened in 1855, the railway preceded the Panama Canal by half a century; the railway was vital in assisting the construction of the canal in the early 1900s. With the opening of the canal, the railroad&#x27;s route was changed as a result of the creation of Gatun Lake, which flooded part of the original route. Following World War II, the railroad&#x27;s importance declined and much of it fell into a state of neglect until 1998, when a project to rebuild the railroad to haul intermodal traffic began; the new railroad opened in 2001.

The original line was built by the United States and the principal incentive was the vast increase in passenger and freight traffic from the Eastern United States to California following the 1849 California Gold Rush. The United States Congress had provided subsidies to companies to operate mail and passenger steamships on the coasts, and supported some funds for construction of the railroad, which began in 1850; the first revenue train ran over the full length on January 28, 1855. Referred to as an &quot;inter-oceanic railroad&quot; when it opened, it was later also described by some as representing a &quot;transcontinental&quot; railroad, despite traversing only the narrow isthmus connecting the North and South American continents. For a time the Panama Railroad also owned and operated ocean-going ships that provided mail and passenger service to a few major US East Coast and West Coast cities, respectively.

Known as the Panama Railroad Company when founded in the 19th century, today it is operated as Panama Canal Railway Company (reporting mark: PCRC). Since 1998 it has been jointly owned by then Kansas City Southern, now Canadian Pacific Kansas City, and Mi-Jack Products and leased to the government of Panama. The Panama Canal Railway is primarily dedicated to freight transport, but it has also operated a passenger service between Panama City and Colón.

== History of earlier isthmus crossings and plans ==
The Spanish improved what they called the &quot;Camino Real&quot; (royal road), and later the Las Cruces trail, built and maintained for transportation of cargo and passengers across the Isthmus of Panama. These were the main routes across the isthmus for more than three centuries. By the 19th century businessmen thought it was time to develop a cheaper, safer, and faster alternative. Railroad technology had developed in the early 19th century. Given the cost and difficulty of constructing a canal with the available technology, a railway seemed the ideal solution.

President Bolívar of La Gran Colombia (Venezuela, Ecuador, Panama, Colombia) commissioned a study into the possibility of building a railway from Chagres (on the Chagres River) to the town of Panama City. This study was carried out between 1827 and 1829, just as locomotives were being invented. Previously railroads used horses for motive power. The report stated that such a railway might be possible. However, the idea was shelved.

In 1836, United States President Andrew Jackson commissioned a study of proposed routes for inter-oceanic communication in order to protect the interests of Americans traveling between the oceans and those living in the developing Oregon Country of the Pacific Northwest. The United States acquired a franchise for a trans-Isthmian railroad; however, the scheme was disrupted by the economic downturn after the business panic of 1837, and came to nothing.

In 1838 a French company was given a concession for the construction of a road, rail, or canal route across the isthmus. An initial engineering study recommended a sea-level canal from Bahía Limón to the bay of Boca del Monte, west of Panama City. The proposed project collapsed for lack of technology and funding needed.

Following the United States&#x27; acquisition of Alta California in 1846, the Oregon Territory in 1848, and the Mexican–American War and with the prospective movement of many more settlers to and from the West Coast, the United States again turned its attention to securing a safe, reliable, and speedy link between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. In 1846 the United States signed a treaty with Colombia (then the Republic of New Granada) by which the United States guaranteed Colombian sovereignty over Panama and was authorized to build a railroad or canal at the Panamanian isthmus, guaranteeing its open transit.

In 1847, the east–west transit across the isthmus was by native dugout canoe (and later by modified lifeboats) up the often dangerous Chagres River. Travelers had to go overland by mules for the final over the old Spanish trails. The trails had fallen into serious disrepair after some 50 years of little or no maintenance; the of rain each year in the April–December rainy season also made the trails hard to maintain. A transit from the Atlantic to the Pacific or vice versa would usually take four to eight days by dugout canoe and mule. The transit was fraught with dangers, and travelers were subject to contracting tropical diseases along the way.

William H. Aspinwall, the man who had won the bid for the building and operating the Pacific mail steamships, conceived a plan to construct a railway across the isthmus. He and his partners created a company registered in New York, the Panama Railroad Company, raised $1,000,000 from the sale of stock, and hired companies to conduct engineering and route studies. Their venture happened to be well-timed, as the discovery of gold in California in January 1848 created a rush of emigrants wanting to cross the Isthmus of Panama to go to California.

The first steamship used on the Pacific run was the $200,000 three-mast, dual-paddle steamer . It was in length, in beam, and deep, with a draft of , and grossed 1,057 tons. When it sailed around the Cape Horn of South America, it was the first steamship on the west coast of South and North America. When it stopped at Panama City on January 17, 1849, it was besieged by about 700 desperate gold seekers. Eventually, it departed Panama City for California on January 31, 1849, with almost 400 passengers, and entered San Francisco Bay, a distance of about , on February 28, 1849 – 145 days after leaving New York. In San Francisco nearly all its crew except the captain deserted to seek their fortunes in the city and the gold fields. The ship was stranded for about four months until the company could buy a new supply of coal and hire a new – and much more expensive – crew.

The route between California and Panama was soon frequently traveled, as it provided one of the fastest links between San Francisco, California, and the East Coast cities, about 40 days&#x27; transit in total. Nearly all the gold that was shipped out of California went by the fast Panama route. Several new and larger paddle steamers were soon plying this new route.

==1855 Panama Railroad==
===Construction===
In January 1849, Aspinwall hired Colonel George W. Hughes to lead a survey party and pick a proposed Panama Railroad roadbed to Panama City. The eventual survey turned out to be full of errors, omissions, and optimistic forecasts, which made it of little use. In April 1849, William Henry Aspinwall was chosen head of the Panama Railroad company, which was incorporated in the State of New York and initially raised $1,000,000 in capital.

In early 1850, George Law, owner of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, bought up the options of the land from the mouth of the Chagres River to the end of Navy Bay in order to force the directors of the new Panama Railroad to give him a position on the board of the company. Since there were no harbor facilities on the Atlantic side of the isthmus, they needed to create a town with docking facilities to unload their railroad supplies there. Refusing to allow Law onto the board, the directors decided to start building harbor facilities, an Atlantic terminus, and their railroad from the vacant site of Manzanillo Island. Starting in May 1850, what would become the city of Aspinwall (now Colón) was founded on on the western end of Manzanillo Island, a treacherously marshy islet covered with mangrove trees.

The board solicited bids from construction companies in the United States to build the railroad. George Totten and John Trautwine initially submitted one of the winning bids. After surveying the railroad&#x27;s proposed course and the probable construction difficulties and uncertainties, they withdrew their bid. Totten agreed to become the chief engineer on the railroad construction project, working for a salary instead of as a general contractor.

A new town on the Atlantic end of the railroad would have to be built on swampy ground that was often awash at high tide. The mangrove, palms, and poisonous manchineel (&quot;manzanilla&quot;) trees and other jungle vegetation had to be felled, and many of the buildings in the new town had to be built on stilts to keep them above the water. As more worker housing was needed, abandoned ships brought to the mouth of the Chagres River as part of the California Gold Rush were towed near the island and used for temporary housing. A steam-powered pile driver was brought from New York. Docks were constructed on pile-driven timbers, more of the island was stripped of vegetation, and elevated living spaces, docks, warehouses, and the like were constructed.

Before the railroad construction could get fully started, the island was connected to the Panamanian mainland by a causeway supported by pile-driven timbers. The first rolling stock, consisting of a steam locomotive built by William Sellers &amp; Co., and several gondola cars, arrived in February 1851. The required steam locomotives, railroad cars, ties, rails, and other equipment were unloaded at the newly constructed docks and driven across the track laid across the about causeway separating the island from the mainland. This causeway connected the Atlantic terminus to the railroad and allowed the ties, iron rails, steam engines, workers, backfill, and other construction material to be hauled onto the mainland. Later, passengers and freight would go the same way. As the railroad progressed, more of the island was filled in, and the causeway was expanded to permanently connect the island to the mainland; its island status disappeared and the town of Aspinwall was created.

In May 1850, the first preparations were begun on Manzanillo Island, and the start of the roadway was partially cleared of trees and jungle on the mainland. Quickly, the difficulty of the scheme became apparent. The initial of the proposed route passed through a jungle of gelatinous swamps infested with alligators, the heat was stifling, mosquitoes and sandflies were everywhere, and deluges of up to of rain for almost half the year required some workers to work in swamp water up to four feet deep. When they tried to build a railroad near Aspinwall, the swamps were apparently deep, often requiring over 200 feet (60 m) of gravel backfill to secure a roadbed. Fortunately, they had found a quarry near Porto Bello, Panama, so they could load sandstone onto barges and tow it to Aspinwall to get the backfill needed to build the roadbed.

Built as the steam revolution was just starting, the only power equipment was a steam-driven pile driver, steam tugs, and steam locomotives equipped with gondola and dump cars for carrying fill material; the rest of the work had to be done by laborers wielding machete, axe, pick, shovel, black powder, and mule cart. As more track was laid, the workers had to continually add backfill to the roadbed, as it continued to slowly sink into the swamp. Once about of track were laid, the first solid ground was reached, at what was then called Monkey Hill (now Mount Hope). This was soon converted to a cemetery that accepted nearly continuous burials.

Cholera, yellow fever, and malaria took a deadly toll on workers. Despite the company&#x27;s constant importation of high numbers of new workers, there were times when progress stalled for simple lack of workers. All supplies and nearly all foodstuffs had to be imported from thousands of miles away, greatly adding to the cost of construction. Laborers came from the United States, the Caribbean Islands, and as far away as Ireland, India, China, and Australia.

After almost 20 months of work, the Panama Railroad had laid about of track and had spent about $1,000,000 to cross the swamps to Gatún. The project&#x27;s fortunes turned in November 1851 – just as they were running out of the original $1,000,000 – when two large paddle steamers, the SS &quot;Georgia&quot; and the SS &quot;Philadelphia&quot;, with about 1,000 passengers, were forced to shelter in Bahía Limón, Panama, owing to a hurricane in the Caribbean. Since the railroad&#x27;s docks had been completed by this time and rail had been laid up to Gatún on the Chagres River, it was possible to unload the ships&#x27; cargoes of emigrants and their luggage and transport them by rail, using flatcars and gondolas, for at least the first part of their journey up the Chagres River on their way to Panama City. Desperate to get off the ships and across the isthmus, the gold seekers paid $0.50 per mile and $3.00 per 100 pounds of luggage to be hauled to the end of the track. This infusion of money saved the company and made it possible to raise more capital to make it an ongoing moneymaker. The company&#x27;s directors immediately ordered passenger cars, and the railway began passenger and freight operations with about of track still to be laid. Each year it added more and more track and charged more for its services. This greatly boosted the value of the company&#x27;s franchise, enabling it to sell more stock to finance the remainder of the project, which took more than $8,000,000 and cost 5,000 to 10,000 workers&#x27; lives to complete.

By July 1852, the company had finished of track and reached the Chagres River, where an enormous bridge was to be built. The first wooden bridge failed when the Chagres rose by over in a day and washed it away. Work was begun on a much higher, , hefty iron bridge, which took more than a year to finish. In all, the company built more than 170 bridges and culverts.
In January 1854, excavation began at the summit of the Continental Divide at the Culebra Cut, where the earth had to be cut from to deep over a distance of about . Several months were spent digging. In March 1854, 700 Chinese laborers arrived to work for the Panama Railroad Company. Decades later, the Panama Canal project required years to cut through this area deeply enough for a canal. The road over the crest of the continental divide at Culebra was completed from the Atlantic side in January 1855; 37 miles (60 km) of track having been laid from Aspinwall (Colón). A second team, working under less harsh conditions with railroad track, ties, railroad cars, steam locomotives, and other supplies brought around Cape Horn by ship, completed its of track from Panama City to the summit from the Pacific side of the isthmus at the same time.

On a rainy midnight on January 27, 1855, lit by sputtering whale oil lamps, the last rail was set in place on pine crossties. Chief engineer George Totten, in pouring rain with a nine-pound maul, drove the spike that completed the railroad. The next day the first locomotive with freight and passenger cars passed from sea to sea. The huge project was completed.

Upon completion the railroad stretched 47 miles, 3,020 feet (76 km), with a maximum grade of 60 feet to the mile (11.4 m/km, or 1.14%). The summit grade, located from the Atlantic and from the Pacific, was above the assumed grade at the Atlantic terminus and above that at the Pacific, being above the mean tide of the Atlantic Ocean and the summit ridge above the same level. The gauge was in , Ω-shaped rail. This gauge was that of the southern United States railway companies at the time. This gauge was converted to standard in the United States in May 1886 after the American Civil War, and remained in use in Panama until the railroad was rebuilt in 2001.

The next step was making things permanent and upgrading the railway. Hastily erected wooden bridges that quickly rotted in the tropical heat and often torrential rain had to be replaced with iron bridges. Wooden trestles had to be converted to gravel embankments before they rotted away. The original pine railroad ties lasted only about a year, and had to be replaced with ties made of lignum vitae, a wood so hard that they had to drill the ties before driving in the screw spikes. The line was eventually built as double track.

The railroad became one of the most profitable in the world. Upon completion, the railway was proclaimed an engineering marvel of the era. Until the opening of the Panama Canal, it carried the heaviest volume of freight per unit length of any railroad in the world. The existence of the railway was one of the keys to the selection of Panama as the site of the canal.

In 1881 the French &quot;Compagnie Universelle du Canal Interocéanique&quot; purchased controlling interest in the Panama Railway Company. In 1904, the United States government under Theodore Roosevelt purchased the railway from the French canal company. At the time, railway assets included some of track, 35 locomotives, 30 passenger cars, and 900 freight cars. Much of this equipment was worn out or obsolete and had to be scrapped.
=== Financing ===
The railway cost some US$8 million to build – eight times the initial 1850 estimate – and presented considerable engineering challenges, passing over mountains and through swamps. Over 300 bridges and culverts needed to be built along the route.

It was built and financed by private companies from the United States. Among the key individuals in building the railway were William H. Aspinwall, David Hoadley, George Muirson Totten, and John Lloyd Stephens. The railroad was built and originally owned by a publicly traded corporation based in New York City, the Panama Rail Road Company, which was chartered by the State of New York on April 7, 1849, and the stock in which would eventually become some of the most highly valued of the era. The company bought exclusive rights from the government of Colombia (then known as Republic of New Granada, of which Panama was a part) to build the railroad across the isthmus.

The railway carried significant traffic even while it was under construction, with traffic carried by canoe and mules over the unfinished sections. This had not been originally intended, but people crossing the isthmus to California and returning east were eager to use such track as had been laid. When only of track had been completed, the railway was doing a brisk business, charging $0.50 per mile per person for the train ride and increasing to $25 per person (first class) when the line was finally completed. By the time the line was officially completed and the first revenue train ran over the full length of its grade on January 28, 1855, more than one-third of its $8 million cost had already been paid for from fares and freight tariffs.

At $25, the first-class fare, one way, was one of the highest rates in existence for a ride. High prices for carrying freight and passengers, despite very expensive ongoing maintenance and upgrades, made the railroad one of the most profitable in the world. Engineering and medical difficulties made the Panama Railway the most expensive railway, per unit length of track, built at the time.

=== Death toll ===
It is estimated that from 5,000 to 10,000 people may have died in the construction of the railroad, though the Panama Railway company kept no official count and the total may be higher or lower. Cholera, malaria, and yellow fever killed thousands of workers, who were from the United States, Europe, Colombia, China, the Caribbean islands, and also included some African slaves. Many of these workers had come to Panama to seek their fortune and had arrived with little or no identification. Many died with no known next of kin, nor permanent address, nor even a known surname.

=== Shipping lines ===

For most of the 19th century, the Panama Railway relied upon third-party companies—most notably the Pacific Mail Steamship Company—to provide connecting steamship services between New York and Panama on the Atlantic and Panama and San Francisco on the Pacific. However, the company also maintained its own fleet of smaller watercraft for local work, and over the course of its history also ran two of its own steamship lines. 

The first of these, the Central American Line, was established on the Pacific in 1856, and linked ports in Nicaragua, Costa Rica, San Salvador and Guatemala to Panama City. This shipping line initially proved highly lucrative, providing sufficient trade to justify the deployment of seven steamships, and for a time actually outdoing the railway itself in profits. Eventually, however, Britain’s Pacific Steam Navigation Company began providing stiff competition, and with overall profits declining due to the completion of the transcontinental railroad in the United States—which provided a direct link between that country&#x27;s East and West coasts—the Panama Railway liquidated the Central American Line in the late 1860s.

When construction of the Panama Canal began in 1881, the shipping service from New York to Panama had to be greatly expanded. Rather than continuing to rely on third parties for these services, the railway established a new steamship company, the Columbian Line, in 1893, to transport company equipment, supplies and personnel between New York and Colón. In 1896, the Columbian Line was renamed the Panama Railroad Steamship Company, and with the purchase by the United States government of the Panama Railroad Company in 1905, the steamship company also became wholly government-owned. At this time, ships of the steamship company included the &quot;Allianca&quot;, &quot;Advance&quot;, &quot;Finance&quot;, &quot;Panama&quot;, &quot;Cristobal&quot;, and , the latter becoming the first ship to officially complete a transit of the newly opened canal in 1914. 

A downturn in world trade during the Great Depression reduced the number of ships from six to two. In the late 1930s, the two remaining ships were retired and three new ones, named , and &quot;Cristobal&quot; after their predecessors, were built to replace them; around this time, the Panama Railroad Steamship Company was renamed the Panama Line. The line continued in service, excepting an interruption during World War II, until 1981, when the last of its ships was sold and the government-owned steamship service between the United States and Panama came to an end.

== 1904–12 rebuild: Panama Canal building and afterward ==
In 1904 the United States obtained consent from the newly formed Panamanian government to build and operate a canal. The choice to use locks and an artificial lake (Gatun) meant that the old railway route from 1855 had to be changed because it followed the Chagres River valley, which would be flooded by the lake. Also, the railway would be extended and altered continuously for the building process. The stock of the Panama Railway Company, vital in canal construction, was entirely controlled by the United States Secretary of War.

===Canal construction years===
The construction of the Panama Canal was envisioned by John Frank Stevens, chief American railroad construction engineer, as a huge earthmoving project using the extended railroad system. Many tracks were added temporarily to transport the sand and rock from the excavation. Stevens used the biggest and most durable equipment available. The French equipment was nearly all judged obsolete, worn out, or too light duty, and nearly all their railroad equipment was not built for heavy-duty use. Some of this French equipment was melted down and converted into medals presented to men working on the Panama Canal.

Also, since the 1855 route followed the Chagres valley (which would become Gatun Lake), the route had to change. The new railroad, starting in 1904, had to be greatly upgraded with heavy-duty double-tracked rails over most of the line to accommodate all the new rolling stock of about 115 powerful locomotives, 2,300 dirt spoils railroad cars, and 102 railroad-mounted steam shovels brought in from the United States and elsewhere. This work was commenced by the first chief engineer, John Findley Wallace (1904–1905).

The steam shovels were some of the largest in the world when they were introduced. The new permanent railroad closely paralleled the canal where it could and was moved and reconstructed where it interfered with the canal work. In addition to moving and expanding the railroad where needed, considerable track additions, extensive machine shops and maintenance facilities were added, and other upgrades were made to the rail system. These improvements were started at about the same time the extensive mosquito abatement projects were undertaken, by Stevens, to make it safer to work in Panama. Once the mosquitoes were under control, much of the railroad was ready to go to work.
The railway greatly assisted the building of the Panama Canal. Besides hauling millions of tons of men, equipment, and supplies, the railroad did much more. Essentially all of the hundreds of millions of cubic yards of material removed from the required canal cuts were broken up by explosives, loaded by steam shovels, mounted on one set of railroad tracks, loaded onto rail cars, and hauled out by locomotives pulling the spoils cars running on parallel tracks.

Most of the cars carrying the dirt spoils were wooden flat cars lined with steel floors that used a crude but effective unloading device, the Lidgerwood system. The railroad cars had only one side, and steel aprons bridged the spaces between them. The rock and dirt were first blasted loose by explosives. Two sets of tracks were then built or moved up to where the loosened material lay. The steam shovels, moving on one set of tracks, picked up the loosened dirt and piled it on the flat cars traveling on a parallel set of tracks. The dirt was piled high against the one closed side of the car. The train moved forward until all cars were filled. A typical train had 20 dirt cars arranged as essentially one long car.

On arrival of the train at one of the approximately 60 different dumping grounds, a three-ton steel plow was put on the last car (or a car carrying the plow was attached as the last car) and a huge winch with a braided steel cable stretching the length of all cars was attached to the engine. The winch, powered by the train&#x27;s steam engine, pulled the plow the length of the dirt loaded train by winching up the steel cable. The plow scraped the dirt off the railroad cars, allowing the entire trainload of dirt cars to be unloaded in ten minutes or less. The plow and winch were then detached for use on another train. Another plow, mounted on a steam engine, then plowed the dirt spoils away from the track.

When the fill got large enough, the track was relocated on top of the old fill to allow almost continuous unloading of new fill with minimal effort. When the steam shovels or dirt trains needed to move to a new section, techniques were developed by William Bierd, former head of the Panama Railroad, to lift large sections of track and their attached ties by steam-powered cranes and relocate them intact, without disassembling and rebuilding the track. A dozen men could move a mile of track a day – the work previously done by up to 600 men. This allowed the tracks used by both the steam shovels and dirt trains to be quickly moved to wherever they were needed. While constructing the Culebra Cut (Gaillard Cut), about 160 loaded dirt trains went out daily and returned empty.

The railroads, steam shovels, steam-powered cranes, rock crushers, cement mixers, dredges, and pneumatic power drills used to drill holes for explosives (about were used) were some of the new construction equipment used to construct the canal. Nearly all this equipment was built by new, extensive machine-building technology developed and made in the United States by companies such as the Joshua Hendy Iron Works.

In addition operation of the canal used large refrigeration systems for making ice, large electrical motors to power the pumps and controls on the canal&#x27;s locks, and other new technology. Extensive electrical generation and distribution systems were built, one of the first large-scale uses of large electrical motors. Electricity-powered donkey engines pulled the ships through the locks on railroad tracks laid parallel to the locks.

===Permanent railroad===

New technology not available in the 1850s allowed earth cuts and fills to be used on the new railroad that were many times larger than those done in the original 1851–1855 construction. The rebuilt, much improved, and often rerouted Panama Railway continued alongside the new canal and across Gatun Lake. The railroad was completed in its final configuration in 1912, two years before the canal, at a cost of $9 million—$1 million more than the original.

After World War II, few additional improvements were made to the Panama Railway. The United States returned control of the railroad to Panama in 1979, and conditions began to decline. By the 1990s, service had declined to the point that trains were limited to , and the railroad was losing millions of dollars per month. Recognizing the railroad was operating far below its potential, in 1998 the government of Panama offered private companies a 50-year concession to take over and rebuild the railroad.

Except for dedicated railroad sections, such as the concrete factory, the broad gauge was used. This gauge was also used for the locomotives along the locks (&quot;mules&quot;). When the gauge for the railroad was changed in 2001, the mules kept the broad gauge.

==2001 reconstruction==

On June 19, 1998, the government of Panama turned over control of the railroad to the private Panama Canal Railway Company (PCRC), a joint venture between Kansas City Southern and gantry crane manufacturer Mi-Jack Products. The new company decided to rebuild the railroad line to handle container traffic parallel to the canal. The railroad projected it could move containers across Panama eight times as fast as the canal. Work on the new railroad started in January 2000, and was complete in July 2001 at a cost of $76 million. Passenger service began at that time, with freight service started a few months later. Two container handling terminals were created: on the Atlantic side, near Manzanillo International Terminal (Colón), and the Pacific Intermodal Terminal near Balboa Harbour. Passenger stations are in Colón (called Atlantic Passenger Station) and Corozal railway station, from Panama City.

===Tracks===

The renovation project involved the laying of new ballast, sleepers (ties), and rail. The track gauge was changed from to , which is the same &quot;standard gauge&quot; used on the North American rail network. The rails were replaced with continuously welded rail, purchased from Sydney Steel Corporation in Sydney, Nova Scotia, Canada. Similarly, the crushed rock used for ballast was purchased from Martin Marietta Materials in Auld&#x27;s Cove, Nova Scotia, Canada. Concrete sleepers (ties) were used to avoid termite and other insect damage. The route was realigned slightly, with a shortcut added around the Gatún locks. The line is now single track, with some strategically placed sections of double track (near Gamboa and Monte Lirio). The floor of the old Miraflores Tunnel was lowered to accommodate the extra height of double-stacked containers. A maintenance shop was built near Colón that can also receive the container-loading portal cranes, which are also owned and operated by PCRC.

=== Passenger service and freight capacity ===

, one passenger service per direction was offered every Monday thru Friday. The Corozal (Panama City)–Colón train has a traveling time of one hour.

While the main purpose of the train is as a commuter rail for those living in Panama City and working in Colon, it has also become a tourist excursion. As it was used during the construction of the canal, it runs parallel to the canal and offers views of the canal. The rail cars are classic in nature, with first-class amenities, bar service, with second-level viewing areas and outdoor viewing.
For freight services – that is, transporting containers across the isthmus – the initial capacity allows for 10 trains to run in each direction per 24 hours. With the current rail configuration, this could be extended to a maximum of 32 trains per 24 hours. A train is composed of double-stack bulkhead-type rail cars, typically containing 75 containers, a mix of sixty 40&#x27; and fifteen 20&#x27; containers. The basic capacity is around 500,000 container moves a year (approximately 900,000 TEU), with a maximum capacity of 2 million TEU per year.

Freight trains are loaded and unloaded in the railway terminals by portal cranes, serving long tracks that can be expanded into six tracks. Containers are transported to and from nearby dock container stacks by truck on a dedicated road.

, the railroad was handling about 1,500 containers per day. The Panama Canal carries some 33,500 containers each day.

==== 2020 Chagres River bridge damage ====
On June 23, 2020, the bulk carrier (freighter) &quot;Bluebill&quot; struck the railway bridge crossing the Chagres River, near Gamboa, severely damaging the bridge and severing the rail route approximately midway between the two terminals. The rail connection was reopened in late September 2020.

==Rolling stock==
===Original railroad===
Many of the early locomotives were built by the Portland Company. All were five-foot gauge.
===2001 rebuild===
In the 2001 rebuild, most rolling stock was replaced, too, as the line was switched to standard gauge. The railroad has a fleet of several historic passenger cars in service, including PCRC #102, which is a vintage dome car first built by the Southern Pacific Railroad in 1955. The passenger cars are Clocker coaches built by the Budd Company and leased from Amtrak.

As of August 2009, the railway&#x27;s motive power consists of ten former Amtrak F40PHs, five EMD SD60s and two EMD SD40-2s from the Kansas City Southern Railway, and one GP10. The locomotive numbering scheme begins with 1855, honoring the year in which the original Panama Railroad was completed.
The rebuilt railway&#x27;s revenue freight rolling stock consists of 5-well, articulated, double-stack container railcars with bulkheads. The 265-foot-long car sets were built by Gunderson Inc. and each car set can hold ten 40 foot containers. The bottom level in each well can hold two 20 foot containers instead of one 40 foot unit. The intermodal terminals at each end can accommodate trains of 11 of these cars, which carry a total of up to 110 forty-foot equivalent units (FEUs).

<text>Desiré-Raoul Rochette (March 6, 1790 – July 3, 1854), was a French archaeologist.

==Life and work==
Born at Saint-Amand in the department of Cher, he received his education at Bourges. In 1810, he obtained a chair of grammar in the Lycée Louis-le-Grand. He was named professor of history in the College of Louis-le-Grand at Paris in 1813 and in the Sorbonne in 1817. His first major work was &quot;Histoire critique de l&#x27;établissement des colonies grecques&quot; (4 vols., 1815).

He was superintendent of antiquities at the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris from 1819 to 1848, and professor of archaeology at the Bibliothèque from 1826, during which time he produced his &quot;Cours d&#x27;archéologie&quot; (1828). In 1829 he published &quot;Monuments inédits&quot;, with &quot;Peintures inédites&quot; following in 1836 and &quot;Peintures de Pompei&quot; in 1844. He contributed to the &quot;Annali of the Roman Institute&quot;, the &quot;Journal des Savants&quot; and the &quot;Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres&quot;.

He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1838. At his death on 3 July 1854 Rochette was perpetual secretary of the Academy of Fine Arts and a corresponding member of most of the learned societies in Europe.

<doc id="392042" wikidata="Q540834" url="?curid=392042" title="Hypoallergenic">
<text>Hypoallergenic, meaning &quot;below average&quot; or &quot;slightly&quot; allergenic, is a term meaning that something (usually cosmetics, pets, textiles, food, etc.) causes fewer allergic reactions. The term was first used in 1953 in an advertising campaign for cosmetics or perhaps as early as 1940. A 2017 study of the top-selling skin moisturizers from Amazon, Target, and Walmart found 83% of those marketed as &quot;hypoallergenic&quot; contained at least one potentially allergenic chemical.

The term is also commonly applied to pet breeds which are claimed to produce fewer allergens than other breeds of the same species, due to some combination of their coat type, absence of fur, or absence of a gene that produces a certain protein. All breeds still produce allergens and a 2011 study failed to find a difference in allergen concentrations in homes with dogs of &quot;hypoallergenic breeds&quot; and other breeds. 

== Certifications and definitions ==
Some cosmetics are marketed as hypoallergenic to imply that their use is less likely to lead to an allergic reaction than other products. However, the term &quot;hypoallergenic&quot; is not regulated, and no research has been done showing that products labeled &quot;hypoallergenic&quot; are less problematic than any others. In 1975, the US Food and Drug Administration tried to regulate the term &quot;hypoallergenic&quot;, but the proposal was challenged by cosmetic companies Clinique and Almay in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. In 1977, courts overruled the U.S. Food and Drug Administration&#x27;s regulation of the use of the term hypoallergenic. In 2019, the European Union released a document about claims made concerning cosmetics, but this was issued as guidance, not a regulation.

In some countries, there are allergy interest groups that provide manufacturers with a certification procedure including tests that ensure a product is unlikely to cause an allergic reaction, but such products are usually described and labeled using other but similar terms. So far, public authorities in no country provide an official certification that an item must undergo before being described as &quot;hypoallergenic&quot;.

==Hypoallergenic pets==

Most dogs, cats, rabbits, and other fur-bearing animals can cause an allergic reaction. The proteins that cause allergies (mainly Fel d 1 in cats and Can f 1 in dogs) are found not only in the animals&#x27; fur or hair but also in saliva, urine, mucus, and hair roots and in the dander sloughed from the animals&#x27; skin. Thus, the widespread idea that &quot;hypoallergenic pets&quot; are those that have less hair or shed less is a myth. Furthermore, there is no evidence that certain pet breeds are less likely to trigger allergic reactions than other pet breeds. Despite that, because allergies are quite prevalent and a hypoallergenic pet would allow people with allergies to have a pet in their home, many breeds are marketed as hypoallergenic.

Dog breeds which have been claimed to be hypoallergenic include Yorkshire Terriers, Portuguese Water Dogs, Poodles and Poodle hybrids. Common rationalizations for these claims include that a breed does not shed its fur, sheds very little, or has fur with the same pH as human hair. Cat breeds such as the LaPerm, Sphynx, Peterbald, Devon Rex and Cornish Rex, which lack some or all of the normal layers in cats&#x27; fur, are claimed by some to be hypoallergenic. Siberian cats and Russian Blues are also believed by some to have such properties.

The Bashkir Curly is the only horse breed which has been claimed to be hypoallergenic, because it has a uniquely textured coat that lacks the protein (present in all other horse fur) believed to be the primary source of allergic reactions to equines.

Some species of pets such as the pig are claimed to be hypoallergenic as a whole, regardless of breed.

== Former judges ==

=== Common Pleas Division (1875–81) ===
The Common Pleas Division was one of the original divisions of the High Court. It was created in 1875 through the merger of the Court of Common Pleas into the High Court. The five existing Justices of the Common Pleas were transferred to the new Common Pleas Division, and retained their previous titles until they left office. The Common Pleas Division was merged into the King&#x27;s Bench Division in 1881, and all of its remaining Justices were transferred to the latter.

The head of the Division was the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas; the post was abolished along with the Common Pleas Division in 1881, and its powers vested in the Lord Chief Justice.
=== Exchequer Division (1875–81) ===
The Exchequer Division was one of the original divisions of the High Court. It was created in 1875 through the merger of the Court of Exchequer into the High Court. The six existing Barons of the Exchequer were transferred to the new Exchequer Division, and retained their previous titles until they left office. Sir Henry Hawkins, the first judge to be directly appointed to the Exchequer Division, tried in vain to obtain the title of Baron, but was styled a Judge of the High Court instead. The Exchequer Division was merged into the King&#x27;s Bench Division in 1881, and all of its remaining Justices were transferred to the latter.

The head of the Division was the Chief Baron of the Exchequer; the post was abolished along with the Exchequer Division in 1881, and its powers vested in the Lord Chief Justice.

<doc id="392047" wikidata="Q536866" url="?curid=392047" title="St Mary le Strand">
<text>St Mary le Strand is a Church of England church at the eastern end of the Strand in the City of Westminster, London. It lies within the Deanery of Westminster (St Margaret) within the Diocese of London. The church stands on what was until recently a traffic island to the north of Somerset House, King&#x27;s College London&#x27;s Strand campus, and south of Bush House (formerly the headquarters of the BBC World Service and now also part of King&#x27;s College London). Although earlier churches preceded it, the present foundation was part of an extensive new church building effort in the early 1700s (&quot;Queen Anne Churches&quot;). It is the official church of the Women&#x27;s Royal Naval Service, and has a book of remembrance for members who have died in service. The nearest tube station is Temple, with the now-closed Aldwych station nearly opposite the church. It is known as one of the two &#x27;Island Churches&#x27;, the other being St Clement Danes.

==History==
The church is the second to have been called St Mary le Strand, the first having been situated a short distance to the south. The date of its foundation is unclear but it was mentioned in a judgment of 1222, when it was called the Church of the Innocents, or St Mary and the Innocents. It was pulled down in 1549 by Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, to make way for Somerset House. The parishioners were promised a new church, which was never built, forcing them to move to the nearby church of St Clement Danes and afterwards to the Savoy Chapel. The site now occupied by the modern church was formerly occupied by a great maypole, which had been the scene of May Day festivities in the 16th and 17th century but was severely decayed by the early 18th century.

The new St Mary le Strand was the first of the twelve new churches built in London under the Commission for Building Fifty New Churches, at a cost of some £16,000. Construction began in February 1714 under the architect James Gibbs, being his first major project following his return from Italy. The steeple was completed in September 1717, but the church was not consecrated for use until 1 January 1724, by Edmund Gibson, Bishop of London, when the Rev. John Heylyn became first rector of the rebuilt church. Bonnie Prince Charlie is alleged to have renounced his Roman Catholic faith in the church to become an Anglican during a secret visit to London in 1750. John Dickens and Elizabeth Barrow, the parents of Charles Dickens, were married here in 1809.

It was restored in 1871 by Robert Jewell Withers, who removed the box pews and had them re-formed into the elegant benches with scrolling sides that one sees in the church today. The tiled floor in the nave and chancel are also his doing. The changes were met by praise, and survive to this day.
 
The church narrowly escaped destruction twice during the 20th century. At the start of the 20th century the London County Council proposed to demolish the church to widen the Strand; a campaign involving the artist Walter Crane succeeded in averting this, although the graveyard was obliterated and the graves moved to Brookwood Cemetery. The London Blitz of the Second World War caused much damage to the surrounding area but again the church avoided destruction, though it did suffer damage from a nearby bomb explosion.

==Architecture==
The architecture of St Mary le Strand proved controversial from the outset, and the architect later expressed unhappiness at the way that his plans had been altered by the Commissioners. According to Gibbs, the church was originally intended to be an Italianate structure with a small campanile over the west end and no steeple. Instead of the latter, a column 250 feet (76 m) high surmounted with a statue of Queen Anne was to have been erected a short distance to the west of the church. A great quantity of stone was purchased and brought to the spot, but the plan was abandoned on the death of the queen in 1714. Instead, the architect was ordered to reuse the stone to build a steeple, which fundamentally altered the plan of the church. Gibbs explained:


The extravagant Baroque ornamentation of the exterior was criticised at the time, and matters were not helped when one of the decorative urns surmounting the exterior of the church fell off and killed a passer-by during a procession in 1802. The prominent situation of the church has also been problematic; even in the 18th century, parishioners complained of the traffic noise. Hence, Gibbs designed the ground floor without windows so as to keep the noise of traffic out.

Even so, the church – Gibbs&#x27;s first public building – won him considerable fame. The interior of the structure is richly decorated with a plastered ceiling in white and gold, with a ceiling inspired by Luigi Fontana&#x27;s work in the church of Santi Apostoli and Pietro da Cortona&#x27;s Santi Luca e Martina, both in Rome. The porch was inspired by Cortona&#x27;s Santa Maria della Pace. The walls were influenced by Michelangelo and the steeple shows the influence of Sir Christopher Wren.

<text>The Women&#x27;s Royal Naval Service (WRNS; popularly and officially known as the Wrens) was the women&#x27;s branch of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Royal Navy. First formed in 1917 for the First World War, it was disbanded in 1919, then revived in 1939 at the beginning of the Second World War, remaining active until integrated into the Royal Navy in 1993. WRNS included cooks, clerks, wireless telegraphists, radar plotters, weapons analysts, range assessors, electricians and air mechanics.

==History==
===First World War===
The WRNS was formed in 1917 during the First World War. On 10 October 1918, nineteen-year-old Josephine Carr from Cork became the first Wren to die on active service, when her ship, the RMS &quot;Leinster&quot; was torpedoed. By the end of the war the service had 5,500 members, 500 of them officers. In addition, 2,867 Wrens, 46 officers and 2,821 other ranks who had previously supported the Royal Naval Air Service chose to be transferred to the RAF Royal Air Force. The WRNS was disbanded in 1919.

===Second World War===
At the beginning of the Second World War, Vera Laughton Mathews was appointed as the director of the re-formed WRNS in 1939 with Ethel (Angela) Goodenough as her deputy. The WRNS had an expanded list of allowable activities, including flying transport planes. At its peak in 1944 it had 75,000 active servicewomen. During the war 102 WRNS members were killed in action and 22 wounded in action. One of the slogans used in recruitment posters was &quot;Join the Wrens and free a man for the Fleet&quot;.

Wrens were prominent as support staff at the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park; they were the direct operators of the bombes and Colossus used to break Axis codes and cyphers.

===Post-war era===
The WRNS remained in existence after the end of the war although Mathews retired in 1947 and Goodenough had died the year before. In the 1970s it became obvious that equal pay for women and the need to remove sexual discrimination meant that the WRNS and the Royal Navy would become one organisation. The key change was that women would become subject to the Naval Discipline Act 1957. Vonla McBride, who had experience in human resource management, became the Director of the WRNS in 1976, and members of the WRNS were subject to the same discipline as men by the next year.

In October 1990, during the Gulf War, HMS &quot;Brilliant&quot; carried the first women officially to serve on an operational warship. That same year, Chief Officer Pippa Duncan became the first WRNS officer to command a Royal Navy shore establishment. The WRNS was finally integrated into the Royal Navy in 1993, when women were allowed to serve on board navy vessels as full members of the crew. Female sailors are still informally known by the nicknames &quot;wrens&quot; or &quot;Jennies&quot; (&quot;Jenny Wrens&quot;) in naval slang.

Before 1993, all women in the Royal Navy were members of the WRNS except nurses, who joined (and still join) Queen Alexandra&#x27;s Royal Naval Nursing Service, and medical and dental officers, who were commissioned directly into the Royal Navy, held RN ranks, and wore WRNS uniform with gold RN insignia.

A series of exhibits on the history of the WRNS are part of the Western Approaches Museum in Liverpool.

==Ranks and insignia==
The WRNS had its own ranking system, which it retained until amalgamation into the Royal Navy in 1993.

===Officers===
===Enlisted===
Ratings&#x27; titles were suffixed with their trade (e.g. Leading Wren Cook, Chief Wren Telegraphist).

Wrens wore the same rank insignia as their male equivalents, but in blue instead of gold. The &quot;curls&quot; atop officers&#x27; rank stripes were diamond-shaped instead of circular.

==Uniforms==

From 1939, Wren uniform, designed by leading British fashion designer Edward Molyneux, consisted of a double-breasted jacket and skirt, with shirt and tie, for all ranks (although similar working dress to the men could also be worn). Junior Ratings wore hats similar to those of their male counterparts (although with a more sloping top). Senior Ratings (Petty Officers and above) and officers wore tricorne hats. In tropical areas these had a white cover. All insignia, including cap badges and non-substantive (trade) badges, were blue.

<text>SantaCon is an annual pub crawl in which people dressed in Santa Claus costumes or as other Christmas characters parade in hundreds of cities around the world. The event has sometimes been characterized by drunken behavior, sparking community resistance.

==Origins==

SantaCon began in San Francisco in 1994, inspired by a &quot;Mother Jones&quot; article on the Danish activist theatre group Solvognen. In 1974, Solvognen gathered dozens of &quot;Santas&quot; in Copenhagen to hand out items from the shelves of a department store to customers as &quot;presents&quot; before they were arrested. Staged as street theater by a local prankster group, the Cacophony Society — which had grown out of the earlier Suicide Club — the aim was to make fun of Christmas and the rampant consumerism associated with the holiday. Originally called Santarchy and influenced by the Surrealist movement, Discordianism, and other subversive art currents, it was not intended to be a recurrent event. However, the event occurred again in San Francisco in 1995 as a Cacophony Society event with 100 participants and at least two arrests.

SantaCon came to Portland in 1996, to Seattle in 1997, and to Los Angeles and New York in 1998, when a &quot;young San Franciscan strapped on a fake white beard, donned a $12 red suit, and led 200 Santas as they went caroling up Fifth Avenue in Manhattan,&quot; to the delight of passersby. It has since evolved and spread to 44 countries around the world, with varying versions and interpretations. Events for 2013 were scheduled in 300 cities, including New York City, London, Vancouver, Belfast, and Moscow. The New York SantaCon is the largest, with an estimated 30,000 people participating in 2012. Other events were much smaller and more subdued, with 30 participating in Spokane, Washington.

The event has also been variously known as Santarchy, Santa Rampage, the Red Menace, and Santapalooza. A December 2015 article on &quot;Vox&quot; described SantaCon as &quot;a roving, loosely organized event where people dress like Santa Claus, elves, or other holiday figures and parade around a city in varying states of sobriety. Comparable to other adult party days, like St. Patrick&#x27;s Day or Halloween, it&#x27;s not organized by one particular group, though there is occasionally a dominant organization in a city (with varying degrees of cooperation with local businesses).&quot;

==Venues==

===New York City===

In New York City, by far the largest SantaCon venue, the event has been criticized for widespread drunkenness and sporadic violence. At a 2011 community board meeting in lower Manhattan, residents complained that their neighborhood had been &quot;terrorized&quot; by SantaCon participants. A December 2014 cover story in the &quot;Village Voice&quot; recounted how SantaCon had evolved from &quot;joyful performance art&quot; that originated in San Francisco to a &quot;reviled bar crawl&quot; of drunken brawling, vandalism, public urination and disorder in New York City and elsewhere, resulting in fierce community resistance and disavowals from the originators of the event. An emergency room physician tweeted in 2019 that the day is dreaded by ER physicians. Another tweeted &quot;All the NYC folks will understand my horror at learning that I&#x27;m working in the ER during SantaCon this weekend.&quot;

In an article on the 2011 SantaCon, &quot;Gothamist&quot; called SantaCon an &quot;annual drunken shitshow&quot; that &quot;has steadily devolved from cleverly subversive to barely tolerable to &#x27;time to lock yourself in your apartment for the day.&#x27; &quot; The &quot;New York Daily News&quot; reported in 2017 that the event &quot;endures an annual backlash from New Yorkers repulsed by the sight of Santas vomiting or urinating in the street in years past.&quot;

During the New York City SantaCon in 2012, participants &quot;left a trail of trouble&quot; through Hell&#x27;s Kitchen, midtown Manhattan, the East Village, and Williamsburg. Residents complained revelers vomited and urinated in the street and fought with each other. One source of tension with residents was that most of the revelers come to the event from outside the city.

Official organizers in 2013 described it as &quot;a nonsensical Santa Claus convention that happens once a year for absolutely no reason&quot;, saying on their website that $60,000 was raised that year for New York charities, and that participants donated about of canned food to City Harvest. That year, &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the event as &quot;a daylong bar crawl that begins with good cheer and, for many, inevitably ends in a blurry, booze-soaked haze.&quot;

Drunken behavior in 2013 disrupted parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn, and led to calls for the event to be ended and for participant misbehavior to be curbed. The event is monitored and supported by the New York City Police Department. But community opposition has increased, as SantaCon evolved into what &quot;The Village Voice&quot; described as &quot;a day-long spectacle of public inebriation somewhere between a low-rent Mardi Gras and a drunken fraternity party.&quot;An op-ed in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on the eve of the 2013 SantaCon criticized it for &quot;sexism, drunkenness, xenophobia, homophobia and enough incidents of public vomiting and urination to fill an infinite dunk tank,&quot; and said it &quot;contributes absolutely zero value – cultural, artistic, aesthetic, diversionary, culinary or political – to its host neighborhood. Quite simply, SantaCon is a parasite.&quot;
&quot;Business Insider&quot; called the 2013 event a &quot;dreaded annual event where frat house expats&quot; wreak havoc on the city &quot;dressed as the jolly holiday icon.&quot; An NYPD lieutenant in Hell&#x27;s Kitchen sent an open letter to local taverns in 2013 which said, &quot;Having thousands of intoxicated partygoers roam the streets urinating, littering, vomiting and vandalizing will not be tolerated in our neighborhood.&quot; On the Lower East Side of Manhattan, residents posted notices telling SantaCon participants to stay away, saying &quot;Alcohol Soaked Father Christmas-themed flash mob not welcome here. Take your body fluids and public intoxication elsewhere.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that &quot;some see [SantaCon] as a way for people who live in the suburbs to come to the city and ruin the weekend.&quot;

Prior to the 2013 SantaCon, city authorities demanded advance notice of the route of the pub crawl. The event was diverted from the Lower East Side and Midtown Manhattan because of complaints by residents, but went through the East Village and parts of Brooklyn as originally planned. During the 2013 SantaCon in New York City, the Long Island Rail Road, Metro-North Railroad and New Jersey Transit banned alcohol consumption on their trains for 24 hours. The 2013 SantaCon was more subdued than previous ones not only due to the alcohol ban on trains, but also an increased police presence, poor weather, and advance coordination with authorities.
A SantaCon organizer said that the group was &quot;very aware of the backlash&quot; and has sought to curb participant misconduct by the use of &quot;helper elves&quot; along the SantaCon route. There were no arrests at the 2013 SantaCon in New York City, and far fewer summonses issued. A more visible police presence and poor weather were credited with the decrease. Complaints of crowds and public drunkenness continued, and &quot;the Santas would more or less take over all of the East Village visiting bars that had no affiliation with SantaCon whatsoever, angering patrons of those establishments who had no interest in being caught up in the debauchery.&quot;
In 2014, community leaders in Bushwick, Brooklyn, banded together to block SantaCon when organizers announced their intent to move the event to that neighborhood. Rafael Espinal, Jr., the city councilman representing Bushwick, urged bars to refrain from participating in the event. A &quot;boycott SantaCon&quot; website was launched by other opponents, and bars said that they would refuse entry to SantaCon participants. The New York City Parks Department refused to issue a permit for use of a local park, leading organizers to cancel plans to have SantaCon in Bushwick.

After the withdrawal from Bushwick, and opposition from the community board representing the Lower East Side and Hell&#x27;s Kitchen, the 2014 event was rescheduled for 13 December for 32 bars in Midtown Manhattan. Event organizers hired Norman Siegel, a civil rights attorney, to defend their rights to express themselves &quot;within the parameters of the First Amendment.&quot; The 2014 SantaCon coincided with demonstrations in Manhattan against police brutality sparked by the Michael Brown and Eric Garner cases.

Police arrested 5 participants and handed out 100 summonses during the 2015 SantaCon, which took place on 12 December. The summonses were for offenses that included carrying an open container, disorderly conduct, and public urination. One participant was arrested for assault, one for possession of a weapon, and three with drug possession.
In anticipation of the 2016 SantaCon, scheduled for 10 December, Metro-North Railroad banned alcohol on trains and stations. The event was scheduled to take place in Midtown Manhattan, the East Village, and the Flatiron District. A hundred summonses were handed out by police but there were no arrests. The &quot;New York Daily News&quot; reported that the pub crawl left &quot;a trail of vomit and destruction throughout the East Village&quot; and that one bar was robbed and vandalized by SantaCon participants.

The 2017 New York City SantaCon took place on 9 December. A stepped-up police presence and 24-hour liquor ban on Long Island Rail Road trains curbed disorder. Police reported one arrest. Two arrests and over 50 summonses were reported in 2018.

The 2019 SantaCon was on 14 Dec. at bars in Times Square, Midtown, Chelsea and the East Village. The Long Island Railroad, Metro-North and New Jersey Transit banned alcohol on trains for the day. A citizens campaign was launched to ban future SantaCons in the city, and plans for &quot;Santa party boats&quot; were disapproved after three New York legislators raised concerns with the marina operator.

The New York City SantaCon website stated that there would be no officially sanctioned New York Santacon event in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The event returned in 2021, and 2022, and the 25th annual SantaCon took place in December 2023.

=== Hoboken ===
At the 2017 Santacon in Hoboken, New Jersey, 17 people were arrested and 55 taken to hospitals. In 2018, 14 were arrested, including two for aggravated assault on police officers and one for a sexual offense. Hoboken&#x27;s mayor, Ravi Bhalla, said that SantaCon &quot;remains a detriment to our city,&quot; and that Hoboken would &quot;continue to explore ways to mitigate the impact of future ‘con’ events.”

At the Hoboken SantaCon in 2019, eight persons were arrested, 49 summonses were issued, and there were 500 calls for assistance. Twenty persons were hospitalized for alcohol-related issues. Police Chief Ken Ferrante said the event, not sanctioned by the city, cost $75,000 in extra police manpower and said that its purported charitable purpose was a &quot;sham.&quot;

=== Saint Paul ===

Lowertown SantaCon was first held in the Lowertown Historic District (Saint Paul, Minnesota) in 2008, organized by local artists and featuring a roving brass band playing Christmas carols for the first several years of the pub crawl, self-described as &quot;half spectacle, half pub crawl and half flash mob—that’s one and a half things!—in the historic former arts district of Lowertown, Saint Paul, MN.&quot; Unlike the infamous New York SantaCon, this smaller event has avoided negative press, has been welcomed by the local community, and has even included a &quot;family friendly&quot; first stop on the route where children can meet a costumed Krampus.

=== Portland ===

In Portland, Oregon, the 2014 SantaCon was organized by the Cacophony Society, which had originated SantaCon in the city, and sought to recapture the event&#x27;s roots. The Oregonian commented that &quot;while the massively popular New York SantaCon made its own bold statement about First Amendment rights Saturday, the Portland SantaCon&#x27;s statement went back to the charmingly subversive attitude that started it all.&quot;

=== San Francisco ===
In 2018, SantaCon organizers said that the city of San Francisco will not sanction the event. The event went on despite the city&#x27;s objections, concerned with safety and crowd control. No permits were issued and the crowd was thinner than in the past. The events were held there in subsequent years.

<doc id="392058" wikidata="Q2394235" url="?curid=392058" title="Ladies' Home Journal">
<text>Ladies&#x27; Home Journal was an American magazine that ran until 2016 and was last published by the Meredith Corporation. It was first published on February 16, 1883, and eventually became one of the leading women&#x27;s magazines of the 20th century in the United States. In 1891, it was published in Philadelphia by the Curtis Publishing Company. In 1903, it was the first American magazine to reach one million subscribers.

In the late 20th century, the rise of television caused sales of the magazine to decline as the publishing company struggled. On April 24, 2014, Meredith announced it would stop publishing the magazine as a monthly with the July issue, stating it was &quot;transitioning &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot; to a special interest publication&quot;. It became available quarterly on newsstands only, though its website remained in operation. The last issue was published in 2016.

&quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot; was one of the Seven Sisters. The name was derived from the Greek myth of the &quot;seven sisters&quot;, also known as the Pleiades.

==Early history==
The &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot; was developed from a double-page supplement in the American newspaper &quot;Tribune and Farmer&quot; titled &quot;Women at Home&quot;. &quot;Women at Home&quot; was written by Louisa Knapp Curtis, wife of the paper&#x27;s publisher, Cyrus H. K. Curtis. After a year, it became an independent publication, with Knapp as editor for the first six years. Its original name was &quot;The Ladies&#x27; Home Journal and Practical Housekeeper&quot;, but Knapp dropped the last three words in 1886.

=== Edward William Bok ===

Knapp was succeeded by Edward William Bok as &quot;LHJ&quot; editor in late 1889. Knapp remained involved with the magazine&#x27;s management, and she also wrote a column for each issue. In 1892, &quot;LHJ&quot; became the first magazine to refuse patent medicine advertisements. In 1896, Bok became Louisa Knapp&#x27;s son-in-law when he married her daughter, Mary Louise Curtis. &quot;LHJ&quot; reached a subscribed circulation of more than one million copies by 1903, the first American magazine to do so. Bok served until 1919. The features he introduced was the &quot;Ruth Ashmore advice column&quot;, written by Isabel Mallon. In the 20th century, the magazine published the work of muckrakers and social reformers such as Jane Addams. In 1901, it published two articles about the early architectural designs of Frank Lloyd Wright. The December 1909 issue included a comic strip which was the first appearance of Kewpie, created by Rose O&#x27;Neill.

Bok introduced business practices of low subscription rates and inclusion of advertising to offset costs. Some argue that women&#x27;s magazines, like the &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot;, pioneered the strategies &quot;magazine revolution&quot;.

Edward Bok authored more than twenty articles opposed to women&#x27;s suffrage which threatened his &quot;vision of the woman at home, living the simple life&quot;. He opposed the concept of women working outside the home, women&#x27;s clubs, and education for women. He wrote that feminism would lead women to divorce, ill health, and even death. Bok solicited articles against women&#x27;s rights from former presidents Grover Cleveland and Theodore Roosevelt (though Roosevelt would later become a supporter of women&#x27;s suffrage). Bok viewed suffragists as traitors to their sex, saying that &quot;there is no greater enemy of woman than woman herself.&quot;

== Later history ==
During World War II, the &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot; was a venue for the government to place articles intended for homemakers. The annual subscription price paid for the production of the magazine and its mailing. The profits came from heavy advertising, pitched to families with above-average incomes of $1,000 to $3,000 in 1900. In the 1910s, it carried about a third of the advertising in all women&#x27;s magazines. By 1929, it had nearly twice as much advertising as any other publication except for the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot;, which was also published by the Curtis family. The &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot; was sold to 2 million subscribers in the mid-1920s, grew a little during the depression years, and surged again during post-World War II. In 1955, each issue sold 4.6 million copies, and there were approximately 11 million readers.

=== Seven Sisters ===
The &quot;Journal&quot;, along with its major rivals, &quot;Better Homes and Gardens&quot;, &quot;Family Circle&quot;, &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot;, &quot;McCall&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Redbook&quot; and &quot;Woman&#x27;s Day&quot;, were known as the Seven Sisters, after the women&#x27;s colleges in the Northeast. For decades, the &quot;Journal&quot; had the most circulation of the Seven Sisters, but it fell behind &quot;McCall&#x27;s&quot; in 1961. In 1968, its circulation was 6.8 million, compared to &quot;McCall&#x27;s&quot; 8.5 million. That year, Curtis Publishing sold the &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot; and the magazine &quot;The American Home&quot; to Downe Communications for $5.4 million in stock. Between 1969 and 1974, Downe was acquired by Charter Company. In 1982, it sold the magazine to Family Media Inc., publishers of &quot;Health&quot; magazine.

=== Protest ===
In March 1970, feminists including Susan Brownmiller held an 11-hour sit-in at the &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot;″s office, with some of them sitting on the desk of editor John Mack Carter and asking him to resign and be replaced by a woman editor. Carter declined to resign; he was allowed to produce a section of the magazine that August. Other activists continued the protests.

=== Redesign and circulations ===
In 1986, the Meredith Corporation acquired the magazine from Family Media for $96 million. In 1998, the &quot;Journal&quot;&#x27;s circulation had dropped to 4.5 million. The magazine debuted an extensive visual and editorial redesign in its March 2012 issue. Photographer Brigitte Lacombe was hired to shoot cover photos, with Kate Winslet appearing on the first revamped issue. The &quot;Journal&quot; announced that portions of its editorial content would be crowdsourced from readers, who would be fairly compensated for their work.

The magazine made the decision to end monthly publication and relaunch it quarterly. At the same time, the headquarters of the magazine moved from New York City to Des Moines, Iowa. Meredith offered its subscribers the chance to transfer their subscriptions to Meredith&#x27;s sister publications. The magazine had a readership of 3.2 million in 2016. Also in 2016, Meredith partnered with Grand Editorial to produce &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot;. Only one issue was created.

==Features==

The American cooking teacher Sarah Tyson Rorer served as &quot;LHJ&quot;&#x27;s first food editor from 1897 to 1911, when she moved to &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot;. In 1936, Mary Cookman, wife of &quot;New York Post&quot; editor Joseph Cookman, began working at the &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot;. In time, she was named its Executive Editor, and she remained with &quot;LHJ&quot; until 1963.

In 1946, the &quot;Journal&quot; adopted the slogan &quot;Never underestimate the power of a woman&quot;, which it continues to use today.

The magazine&#x27;s trademark feature is &quot;Can This Marriage Be Saved?&quot; In this popular column, each person of a couple in a troubled marriage explains their view of the problem, a marriage counselor explains the solutions offered in counseling, and the outcome is published. It was written for 30 years, starting in 1953, by Dorothy D. MacKaye under the name of Dorothy Cameron Disney. MacKaye co-founded this column with Paul Popenoe, a founding practitioner of marriage counseling in the U.S. The two jointly wrote a book of the same title in 1960. Both the book and the column drew their material from the extensive case files of the American Institute of Family Relations in Los Angeles, California. MacKaye died in 1992 at the age of 88. Subsequent writers for the feature have included Lois Duncan and Margery D. Rosen.

The illustrations of William Ladd Taylor were featured between 1895 and 1926; the magazine also sold reproductions of his works in oil and watercolor.

<text>Ophrys lutea, the yellow bee-orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East, the range extending from Portugal and Morocco to Syria.

== Description of the flower ==
Broad asymmetric lateral sepals, dorsal sepal lowered.

Extended petals, yellow or with a blue-grey or brown spotted velvety macula. Pollinated by male &quot;Andrena&quot; bees. This species is notable among &quot;Ophrys&quot; for the fact that the pollinating bees sit on the labellum facing away from the pollinaria instead of facing towards them, and thus collect the pollinaria with their abdomen.

== Subspecies ==
Numerous subspecific names have been proposed, but the following are currently accepted:

*&quot;Ophrys lutea&quot; subsp. &quot;aspea&quot; - Northern Tunisia to Northern Libya
*&quot;Ophrys lutea&quot; subsp. &quot;galilaea&quot; - Mediterranean
*&quot;Ophrys lutea&quot; subsp. &quot;laurensis&quot; - Sicily
*&quot;Ophrys lutea&quot; subsp. &quot;lutea&quot; - Western and Central Mediterranean to Crete
*&quot;Ophrys lutea&quot; subsp. &quot;phryganae &quot; - Central and Eastern Mediterranean

== Flowering period ==
March to May

== Habitat ==
The orchid grows in full sun or shade on limey dry or damp soils, pastures, and thin woodland.

<text>The ordinary judges of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales are the Lord Justices of Appeal and Lady Justices of Appeal. These judges serve with the &quot;ex officio&quot; members of the court:
* Lord Chief Justice
* Master of the Rolls
* President of the King&#x27;s Bench Division
* President of the Family Division
* Chancellor of the High Court
* Supreme Court judges appointed from the Court of Appeal or who were eligible to serve on it when appointed to the Supreme Court

Judges of the Court of Appeal are made members of the Privy Council within months of appointment, enabling them to serve as members of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council and entitling them to the style &quot;The Right Honourable&quot;.

The Senior Courts Act 1981 limited in principle the total number of Lord Justices of Appeal and Lady Justices of Appeal; it was raised by one to 39 by The Maximum Number of Judges Order 2015 (the Act allows for such Orders). The Judicial Pensions and Retirement Act 1993 mandated that, along with other senior judges throughout the UK, they retired at 70 years of age (save for judges appointed before 31 March 1995 who had to retire at 75). However, the Public Service Pensions and Judicial Offices Act 2022 amended the 1993 Act to restore the retirement age of 75 for all judges, whenever appointed.

==&quot;Ex officio&quot; judges==
These are the &quot;ex officio&quot; judges of the Court of Appeal excepting the qualifying justices of the Supreme Court (the judges appointed from England and Wales); they are listed at Justice of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom:

<doc id="392066" wikidata="Q1335201" url="?curid=392066" title="St Martin-in-the-Fields">
<text>St Martin-in-the-Fields is a Church of England parish church at the north-east corner of Trafalgar Square in the City of Westminster, London. Dedicated to Saint Martin of Tours, there has been a church on the site since at least the medieval period. This location, at that time, was farmlands and fields beyond the London wall.

It became a principal parish church west of the old City in the early modern period as Westminster&#x27;s population grew. When its medieval and Jacobean structure was found to be near failure, the present building was constructed in an influential neoclassical design by James Gibbs in 1722–1726. The church is one of the visual anchors adding to the open-urban space around Trafalgar Square.

==History==
===Roman era===
Excavations at the site in 2006 uncovered a group of burials dating from c A.D. 350, including a sarcophagus burial dating from c. A.D. 410. The site is outside the city limits of Roman London (as was the usual Roman practice for burials) but is particularly interesting for being so &quot;far&quot; outside (1.6 km or 1 statute mile west-south-west of Ludgate), and this is leading to a reappraisal of Westminster&#x27;s importance at that time. The burials are thought by some to mark a Christian centre of that time (possibly reusing the site or building of a pagan temple) or possibly even developing around the shrine of a martyr. 

===Saxon===
What is extraordinary is that the Roman burial ground was acknowledged by the Saxons, who also buried their dead there. To have such a long time span as a burial ground makes St Martin-in-the-Fields relatively unusual. It is possible that the Saxon town of Lundenwic essentially grew eastwards from the early burial group (Museum of London Archaeology).

===Medieval and Tudor===
The earliest extant reference to the church is from 1222, when there was a dispute between the Abbot of Westminster and the Bishop of London as to who had control over it. The Archbishop of Canterbury decided in favour of Westminster, and the monks of Westminster Abbey began to use it.

Henry VIII rebuilt the church in 1542 to keep plague victims in the area from having to pass through his Palace of Whitehall. At this time it was literally &quot;in the fields&quot;, occupying an isolated position between the cities of Westminster and London.
===Seventeenth century===
By the beginning of the reign of James I, the local population had increased greatly and the congregation had outgrown the building. In 1606 the king granted an acre ( 4,046.86 mts2) of ground to the west of St Martin&#x27;s Lane for a new churchyard, and the building was enlarged eastwards over the old burial ground, increasing the length of the church by about half. At the same time, the church was, in the phrase of the time, thoroughly &quot;repaired and beautified&quot;. Later in the 17th century, capacity was increased by the addition of galleries. The creation of the new parishes of St Anne, Soho, and St James, Piccadilly, and the opening of a chapel in Oxenden Street also relieved some of the pressure on space.

As it stood at the beginning of the 18th century, the church was built of brick, rendered over, with stone facings. The roof was tiled, and there was a stone tower, with buttresses. The ceiling was slightly arched, supported with what Edward Hatton described as &quot;Pillars of the &quot;Tuscan&quot; and Modern Gothick orders&quot;. The interior was wainscotted in oak to a height of , while the galleries, on the north, south and west sides, were of painted deal. The church was about long and wide. The tower was about high.

A number of notables were buried in this phase of the church, including Robert Boyle, Nell Gwyn, John Parkinson and Sir John Birkenhead.

===Rebuilding===


A survey of 1710 found that the walls and roof were in a state of decay. In 1720, Parliament passed an act of Parliament, the (6 Geo. 1. c. &quot;32&quot; ) for the rebuilding of the church allowing for a sum of up to £22,000, to be raised by a rate on the parishioners. A temporary church was erected partly on the churchyard and partly on ground in Lancaster Court. Advertisements were placed in the newspapers that bodies and monuments of those buried in the church or churchyard could be taken away for reinterment by relatives.

The rebuilding commissioners selected James Gibbs to design the new church. His first suggestion was for a church with a circular nave and domed ceiling, but the commissioners considered this scheme too expensive. Gibbs then produced a simpler, rectilinear plan, which they accepted. The foundation stone was laid on 19 March 1722, and the last stone of the spire was placed into position in December 1724. The total cost was £33,661 including the architect&#x27;s fees.

The west front of St Martin&#x27;s has a portico with a pediment supported by a giant order of Corinthian columns, six wide. The order is continued around the church by pilasters. In designing the church, Gibbs drew upon the works of Christopher Wren, but departed from Wren&#x27;s practice in his integration of the tower into the church. Rather than considering it as an adjunct to the main body of the building, he constructed it within the west wall, so that it rises above the roof, immediately behind the portico, an arrangement also used at around the same time by John James at St George, Hanover Square (completed in 1724), although James&#x27; steeple is much less ambitious. The spire of St Martin&#x27;s rises above the level of the church floor.

The church is rectangular in plan, with the five-bay nave divided from the aisles by arcades of Corinthian columns. There are galleries over both aisles and at the west end. The nave ceiling is a flattened barrel vault, divided into panels by ribs. The panels are decorated in stucco with cherubs, clouds, shells and scroll work, executed by Giuseppe Artari and Giovanni Bagutti.

Until the creation of Trafalgar Square in the 1820s, Gibbs&#x27;s church was crowded by other buildings. J. P. Malcolm, writing in 1807, said that its west front &quot;would have a grand effect if the execrable watch-house and sheds before it were removed&quot; and described the sides of the church as &quot;lost in courts, where houses approach them almost to contact&quot;.

The design was criticised widely at the time, but subsequently became extremely famous, being copied particularly widely in the United States. Although Gibbs was discreetly Catholic, his four-wall, long rectangular floor plan, with a triangular gable roof and a tall prominent centre-front steeple (and often, columned front-portico), became closely associated with Protestant church architecture world-wide.

In Britain, the design of St Andrew&#x27;s in the Square church (built 1739–56) in Glasgow was inspired by the church. In the American Colonies, St. Michael&#x27;s Anglican Church (Charleston, South Carolina) (built 1751–61), was heavily influenced by St Martin-in-the-fields, though the columns of its front portico are of the Tuscan order, rather than the Corinthian order. St. George&#x27;s Church, Dublin (built 1802), though obviously influence by St Martin&#x27;s-in-the-fields, that influence seems to be via St Andrews in the Square, as exampled in the copying of its Ionic columns instead of St Martin&#x27;s Corinthian columns. In India, St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Egmore (built 1818–1821), Madras (now Chennai), is another example. In South Africa, the Dutch Reformed Church in Cradock is modelled on St Martin-in-the-Fields.

Various notables were soon buried in the new church, including the émigré sculptor Louis-François Roubiliac (who had settled in this area of London) and the furniture-maker Thomas Chippendale (whose workshop was in the same street as the church, St Martin&#x27;s Lane), along with Jack Sheppard in the adjoining churchyard. This churchyard, which lay to the south of the church, was removed to make way for Duncannon Street, constructed in the 19th century to provide access to the newly created Trafalgar Square. Two small parcels of the churchyard survived, to the north and east of the church. The Metropolitan Public Gardens Association laid them out for public use in 1887; unusually for the MPGA, it paved them with flagstones as well as planted them with trees. For many years covered in market stalls, the churchyard has been restored including with the provision of seating.

Before embarking for the Middle East Campaign, Edmund Allenby was met by General Beauvoir De Lisle at the Grosvenor Hotel and convinced General Allenby with Bible prophecies of the deliverance of Jerusalem. He told General Allenby that the Bible said that Jerusalem would be delivered in that very year, 1917, and by Great Britain. General Beauvoir de Lisle had studied the prophecies, as he was about to preach at St Martin-in-the-Fields.

===Recent times===
Because of its prominent position, St Martin-in-the-Fields is one of the most famous churches in London. Dick Sheppard, Vicar from 1914 to 1927 who began programmes for the area&#x27;s homeless, coined its ethos as the &quot;Church of the Ever Open Door&quot;. The church is famous for its work with young and homeless people through The Connection at St Martin-in-the-Fields, created in 2003 through the merger of two programmes dating at least to 1948. The Connection shares with The Vicar&#x27;s Relief Fund the money raised each year by the BBC Radio 4 Appeal&#x27;s Christmas appeal.

The crypt houses a café which hosts jazz concerts whose profits support the programmes of the church. The crypt is also home to the London Brass Rubbing Centre, established in 1975 as an art gallery, book, and gift shop. A life-sized marble statue of Henry Croft, London&#x27;s first pearly king, was moved to the crypt in 2002 from its original site at St Pancras Cemetery.

In January 2006, work began on a £36-million renewal project. The project included renewing the church itself, as well as provision of facilities encompassing the church&#x27;s crypt, a row of buildings to the north and some significant new underground spaces in between. The funding included a grant of £15.35 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund. The church and crypt reopened in the summer of 2008.

Its present vicar is Sam Wells (since 2012), who as well as being a priest is a renowned theologian and writer.

Twelve historic bells from St Martin-in-the-Fields, cast in 1725, are included in the peal of the Swan Bells tower in Perth, Australia. The current set of twelve bells, cast in 1988, which replaced the old ones are rung every Sunday between 9am and 10am by the St Martin in the Fields Band of Bell Ringers. The bells are also rung by the Friends of Dorothy Society each year as part of London Pride.

==In popular culture==
Being in a prominent central London location, the exterior of the church building frequently appears in films, including &quot;Notting Hill&quot; and &quot;Enigma&quot;, and television programmes, including &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and &quot;Sherlock&quot;.

References to the church take place in the following novels:

* 1850: &quot;David Copperfield&quot; by Charles Dickens
* 1908: &quot;A Room with a View&quot; by E. M. Forster
* 1928: &quot;The Last Post&quot;, the fourth and final novel in Ford Madox Ford&#x27;s tetralogy &quot;Parade&#x27;s End&quot;
* 1949: &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; by George Orwell (in which a future Totalitarian regime abolishes religion and turns the building into a military museum)
* 1949: &quot;The Parasites&quot; by Daphne du Maurier
* 2004: &quot;Quicksilver&quot; by Neal Stephenson
* 2012: &quot;Winter of the World&quot; by Ken Follett

References to the church occur in the following poems:

* 1893: &quot;The Kingdom of God&quot; by Francis Thompson
* 2009: &quot;Now traveller, whose journey passes through&quot; by Andrew Motion

The St Mary&#x27;s Church in Pune is designed in the style of St Martin&#x27;s.

The church may be the St Martin&#x27;s referred to in the nursery rhyme known as Oranges and Lemons.

==Royal connections==
The church has a close relationship with the royal family, whose parish church it is, as well as with 10 Downing Street and the Admiralty.

==Almshouses==
The church established its own almhouses and pension-charity on 21 September 1886. The 19 church trustees administered almshouses for women and provided them with a weekly stipend. The almshouses were built in 1818, in Bayham Street (to a design by Henry Hake Seward), on part of the parish burial ground in Camden Town and St Pancras and replaced those constructed in 1683.

==Charity==
The St Martin-in-the-Fields charity supports homeless and vulnerably housed people. The church has raised money for vulnerable people in its annual Christmas Appeal since 1920 and in an annual BBC radio broadcast since December 1927.

The Connection at St Martin&#x27;s is located next to the church, and works closely with the church&#x27;s charity. It supports 4000 homeless people in London each year, by providing accommodation, medical and dental care, skills training, and creative activities.

==St Martin&#x27;s school==
In 1699 the church founded a school for poor and less fortunate boys, which later became a girls&#x27; school. It was originally sited in Charing Cross Road, near the church. At one time it was known as St Martin&#x27;s Middle Class School for Girls, and was later renamed St Martin-in-the-Fields High School for Girls. It was relocated to its present site in Lambeth in 1928.

The school badge depicts the eponymous Saint Martin of Tours. The school&#x27;s Latin motto translates as &quot;With love and learning&quot;. The school is Christian but accepts girls of all faiths.

<text>Major-General Sir Henry Havelock (5 April 1795 – 24 November 1857) was a British general who is particularly associated with India and his recapture of Cawnpore during the Indian Rebellion of 1857.

==Early life==
Henry Havelock was born at Ford Hall, Bishopwearmouth (now in Sunderland), the son of William Havelock, a wealthy shipbuilder, and Jane, daughter of John Carter, solicitor, of Stockton-on-Tees. He was the second of four brothers, all of whom entered the army. The family moved to Ingress Park, Greenhithe, Kent, when Henry was still a child, and here his mother died in 1811. From January 1800 until August 1804 Henry attended Dartford Grammar School as a parlour boarder with the Master, Rev John Bradley, after which he was placed with his elder brother in the boarding-house of Dr. Raine, headmaster of Charterhouse School until he was 17. Among his contemporaries at Charterhouse were Connop Thirlwall, George Grote, William Hale, Julius Hare, and William Norris (Recorder of Penang), the last two being his special friends. Shortly after leaving Charterhouse his father lost his fortune by unsuccessful speculation, sold Ingress Hall, and removed to Clifton.

In accordance with the desire of his mother he entered the Middle Temple in 1813, and became a pupil of Joseph Chitty; his fellow-student was Thomas Talfourd. Havelock was thrown upon his own resources, and obliged to abandon the law as a profession. By the good offices of his brother William, who had distinguished himself in the Peninsular War and at Waterloo, he obtained on 30 July 1815, at the age of 20, a post as second lieutenant in the 95th Regiment of Foot, Rifle Brigade, and was posted to the company of Captain Harry Smith, who encouraged him to study military history and the art of war. He was promoted lieutenant on 24 October 1821. During the following eight years of service in Britain he read extensively all the standard works and acquired a good acquaintance with the theory of war.

== India ==
Seeing no prospect of active service, he resolved to go to India, and at the end of 1822 transferred into the 13th (1st Somersetshire) Regiment (Light Infantry), then commanded by Major Robert Sale, and embarked on the &quot;General Kyd&quot; in January 1823 for India. Before embarkation he studied the Persian and Hindustani languages with success under John Borthwick Gilchrist. During the voyage a brother officer, Lieutenant James Gardner, awakened in Havelock religious convictions which had slumbered since his mother&#x27;s death, but henceforth became the guiding principle of his life.

Havelock served with distinction in the First Anglo-Burmese War (1824–1826), after which he returned to England and married Hannah Shepherd Marshman, the daughter of eminent Christian missionaries Dr. and Mrs. Joshua Marshman. At about the same time he became a Baptist, being baptized by John Mack at Serampore. He introduced some of his new family&#x27;s missionary ideas to the army and began the distribution of bibles to all soldiers. He also introduced all-rank bible study classes and established the first non-church services for military personnel.

===First Afghan War===

By the time Havelock took part in the First Anglo-Afghan War in 1839, he had been promoted to the rank of captain. He was present as aide-de-camp to Willoughby Cotton at the capture of Ghazni, on 23 May 1839, and at the occupation of Kabul. After a short period in Bengal to secure the publication of his &quot;Memoirs of the Afghan Campaign&quot;, he returned to Kabul in charge of recruits, and became interpreter to General William George Keith Elphinstone.

In 1841, being attached to Sir Robert Henry Sale&#x27;s force, he took part in the celebrated passage of the defiles of the Ghilzais and in the fighting from Tezeen to Jalalabad. Here, after many months siege, his column in a &quot;sortie en masse&quot; defeated Akbar Khan on 7 April 1842. He was now made Deputy Lieutenant-General of the infantry division in Kabul, and in September he assisted at Jagdalak, at Tezeen, and at the release of the British prisoners at Kabul, besides taking a prominent part at Istalif. He next went through the Gwalior campaign as Persian interpreter to Sir Hugh Gough, and distinguished himself at Maharajpur in 1843, and also in the Sikh Wars at the battles of Mudki, Ferozeshah and Sobraon in 1845.

He used his spare time to produce analytical reports about the skirmishes and battles in which he was involved. These writings were returned to Britain and were reported on in the press of the day. For his military services he was made Deputy Adjutant-General at Bombay. He transferred from the 13th Regiment of Foot to the 39th, then as second major into the 53rd at the beginning of 1849, and soon afterwards left for England, where he spent two years and became involved in the running of the Stepney Baptist Academy, soon to move to Regent&#x27;s Park. He returned to India in 1852 with further promotion: he was appointed Quartermaster-General, promoted to full colonel, and appointed Adjutant-General, India in November 1854.

===Indian Rebellion of 1857–1859===

In that year, he was selected by Sir James Outram to command a division in the Anglo-Persian War, during which he was present at the action of Muhamra against the forces of Nasser al-Din Shah under command of Khanlar Mirza. Peace with Persia freed his troops just as the Indian Rebellion broke out; and he was chosen to command a column to quell disturbances in Allahabad, to support Sir Henry Lawrence at Lucknow and Wheeler at Cawnpore, and to pursue and utterly destroy all mutineers and insurgents. Throughout August Havelock led his soldiers northwards across Oudh (present day Uttar Pradesh), defeating all rebel forces in his path, despite being greatly outnumbered. His years of study of the theories of war and his experiences in earlier campaigns were put to good use. At this time Lady Canning wrote of him in her diary: &quot;General Havelock is not in fashion, but all the same we believe that he will do well.&quot; But in spite of this lukewarm commendation Havelock proved himself the man for the occasion and won a reputation as a great military leader.

Three times he advanced for the relief of the Lucknow, but twice held back rather than risk fighting with troops wasted by battle and disease. Reinforcements arrived at last under Outram, who assumed command. With Havelock commanding the assault, Lucknow was relieved on 25 September 1857. However, a second rebel force arrived and besieged the town again. This time Havelock and his troops were caught inside the blockade.

===Death===

He died in Lucknow on 24 November 1857 of dysentery, a few days after the siege was lifted. He lived long enough to receive news that he was to be created a Baronet for the first three battles of the campaign; but he never knew of the major-generalship which was conferred shortly afterwards. With his baronetcy came a pension of £1,000 a year voted by Parliament. He was also appointed Colonel of the 3rd (East Kent) Regiment of Foot (&quot;The Buffs&quot;) in December, as news of his death had yet to reach England. The baronetcy was afterwards bestowed upon his eldest son, Henry, in the following January; while to his widow, by Royal Warrant of Precedence, were given the rights to which she would have been entitled had her husband survived and been created a baronet. Parliament awarded pensions of £1,000 a year each to widow and son.

==Legacy==

===Statue in Trafalgar Square===
There is a statue of Havelock (by William Behnes) in Trafalgar Square, London. The plaque on the plinth reads:

In 2000, there was a controversy when the then mayor of London, Ken Livingstone suggested that the Trafalgar Square statue, together with that of General Charles James Napier, be replaced with &quot;more relevant&quot; figures.

===Statue in Mowbray Park===
William Behnes also designed the statue of Havelock at the top of Building Hill in Mowbray Park Sunderland. Two cannon (replicas of cannons presented to Sunderland after the Crimean War in 1857) stand beside the statue, facing north commanding the view over the park. The statue, however, looks west towards Havelock&#x27;s birthplace. The statue reads: &quot;Born 5, April 1795 at Ford Hall Bishopwearmouth Died 24 November 1857 at Dil-Koosa Lucknow&quot;.

An imposing monument to Havelock&#x27;s memory was erected by his sons, widow, and family. His tomb still stands in Chander Nagar – Alambagh area of Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh. These verses are inscribed on his tomb:
&quot; His ashes in a peaceful urn shall rest;
His name a great example stands, to show
How strangely high endeavours may be blessed,
When piety and valour jointly go.&quot;

He is portrayed as a very competent officer and an exceptionally religious man.

<text>Awadh (), known in British historical texts as Avadh or Oudh, is a historical region in northern India, now constituting the northeastern portion of Uttar Pradesh. It is roughly synonymous with the ancient Kosala region of Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain scriptures.

It was a province of all the major Islamic dynasties in India including the Mughal Empire. With the decline of late Mughal Delhi, Awadh became a major source of literary, artistic, religious, and architectural patronage in northern India under the rule of its eleven rulers, called Nawabs. From 1720 to 1856, the nawabs presided over Awadh, with Ayodhya and Faizabad serving as the region&#x27;s initial capitals. Later, the capital was relocated to Lucknow, which is now the capital of Uttar Pradesh.

The British conquered Awadh in 1856, which infuriated Indians and was recognised as a factor causing the Indian Rebellion (1857-58), the biggest Indian uprising against British rule.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;Awadh&quot; is inherited from the Sanskrit word Ayodhya meaning &quot;not to be warred against, irresistible&quot;.

== History ==
Awadh, known as the granary of India, was important strategically for the control of the Doab, a fertile plain between the Ganges and the Yamuna rivers. It was a wealthy kingdom, able to maintain its independence against threats from the Marathas, the British and the Afghans.

=== Ancient ===

Awadh&#x27;s political unity can be traced back to the ancient Hindu kingdom of Kosala, with Ayodhya as its early capital in traditional history, though in Buddhist times (6th–5th century ) Shravasti became the kingdom&#x27;s capital city.

Modern Awadh finds historical mention only in the Mughal time of Akbar, in the late 16th century.

In prehistoric times, Awadh, reputedly the kingdom of Bikukshi, contained five main divisions :
# Uttara Kosala or the trans-Ghaghra districts, now known as Bahraich, Gonda, Basti and Gorakhpur.
# Silliana, consisting of lower range of hills to the north of Uttara Kosala, now belonging to Nepal, with the Tarai at its base.
# Pachhimrath, which may be roughly described as the country between Ghaghra and Gomti west to the line from Ayodhya to Sultanpur. This division included about third of present district of Ayodhya (including Ambedkar Nagar district district), a small portion of the north of Sultanpur, greater part of Barabanki, and sections of the Lucknow and Sitapur districts.
# Purabrath, which may be roughly described as the country between Ghaghra and Gomti east to the line from Ayodhya to Sultanpur. This division included about two-thirds of present district of Ayodhya (including Ambedkar Nagar district), the north-eastern corner of Sultanpur, and parts of Mirzapur district, Pratapgarh district and Jaunpur.
# Arbar, extended southwards from Gomti to the Sai river.

=== Before independence ===
Since AD 1350 different parts of the Awadh region were ruled by the Delhi Sultanate, Sharqi Sultanate, Mughal Empire, Nawabs of Awadh, East India Company and the British Raj. Kanpur was one of the major centres of Indian rebellion of 1857, participated actively in India&#x27;s Independence movement, and emerged as an important city of North India.

For about eighty-four years (from 1394 to 1478), Awadh was part of the Sharqi Sultanate of Jaunpur; emperor Humayun made it a part of the Mughal Empire around 1555. Emperor Jehangir granted an estate in Awadh to a nobleman, Sheik Abdul Rahim, who had won his favour. Sheik Abdul Rahim later built Machchi Bhawan in this estate; this later became the seat of power from where his descendants, the Sheikhzades, controlled the region. Until 1719, the Subah of Awadh (bordering (Old) Delhi, Agra, Illahabad and Bihar) was a province of the Mughal Empire, administered by a Nazim or Subah Nawab (governor) appointed by the Emperor. Nawab –the plural of the Arabic word &#x27;Naib&#x27;, meaning &#x27;assistant&#x27;– was the term given to &quot;subahdars&quot; (provincial governors) appointed by the Mughal emperor all over India to assist him in managing the empire. In the absence of expeditious transport and communication facilities, they were practically independent rulers of their territory and wielded the power of life and death over their subjects. Persian adventurer Saadat Khan, also called Burhan-ul-Mulk, was appointed the Nazim of Awadh in 1722 and he established his court in Faizabad near Lucknow. The Nawabs of Lucknow were in fact the Nawabs of Awadh, but were so referred to because after the reign of the third Nawab, Lucknow became the capital of their realm, where the British station Residents (&#x27;diplomatic&#x27; colonial Agents) from 1773. The city was &quot;North India&#x27;s cultural capital&quot;; its nawabs, best remembered for their refined and extravagant lifestyles, were patrons of the arts. Under them music and dance flourished, and many monuments were erected. Of the monuments standing today, the Bara Imambara, the Chhota Imambara and the Rumi Darwaza are notable examples. One of the more lasting contributions by the Nawabs is the syncretic composite culture that has come to be known as the Ganga-Jamuni Tehzeeb.

=== Awadh under the Mughals ===
From the pre-historic period to the time of Akbar, the limits of the subah (imperial top-level province) and its internal divisions seem to have been constantly changing, and the name of Oudh, or Awadh, seems to have been applicable to only one of the ancient divisions or &quot;Sarkars&quot;, nearly corresponding to old Pachhimrath. The title of Subehdar (governor) of Awadh is mentioned as early as 1280 AD, but it can only have denoted the governor of the tract of the country above defined. The Awadh of Mughal Badshah (emperor) Akbar was one of the twelve (or fifteen) &quot;subahs&quot; into which he divided the Mughal Empire as it stood in 1590. As constituted at the end of the sixteenth century, the &quot;Subah&quot; contained five &quot;sarkars&quot;, viz. Awadh, Lucknow, Bahraich, Khairabad and Gorakhpur, which in turn were divided in numerous &quot;mahals&quot; and &quot;&quot; (districts).

Khan Zaman Khan Ali Asghar son of Qazi Ghulam Mustafa was appointed as Subahdar of Awadh during the reign of Farrukhsiyar. This appointment was made in place of &#x27;Aziz Khan Chughtai&#x27;. Later on, Mahabat Khan was appointed as Subahdar of Awadh in place of Khan Zaman Khan Ali Asghar, who was all over again transferred to Azimabad (Patna) as Subahdar in place of &#x27;Sar Buland Khan&#x27;.
It seems to have been of nearly the same extent as the &quot;Province of Oudh&quot; at the time of annexation to British India in 1858, and to have differed only in including Gorakhpur, Basti, and Azamgarh, and in excluding Tanda, Aldemau, Rajesultanpur and Manikpur, or the territory to the east and South of Faizabad, Sultanpur and Pratapgarh.

=== Under the hereditary Nawabs of Awadh ===


As the Mughal power declined and the emperors lost their paramountcy and they became first the puppets and then the prisoners of their feudatories, so Awadh grew stronger and more independent. Its capital city was Faizabad. Saadat Khan, the first Nawab of Awadh, laid the foundation of Faizabad at the outskirt of ancient city of Ayodhya. Faizabad developed as a township during the reign of Safdar Jang, the second nawab of Avadh (1739–54), who made it his military headquarters while his successor Shuja-ud-daula made it a full-fledged capital city. Shuja-ud-Daula, the third Nawab of Awadh, built a fort known as &quot;Chhota Calcutta&quot;, now in ruins. In 1765 he built the Chowk and Tir-paulia and subsequently laid out the Angoori Bagh and Motibagh to the south of it, Asafbagh and Bulandbagh to the west of the city. During the reign of Shuja-Ud-Daula, Faizabad attained such a prosperity which it never saw again. The Nawabs graced Faizabad with several notable buildings, including the Gulab Bari, Moti Mahal and the tomb of Bahu Begum. Gulab Bari stands in a garden surrounded by a wall, approachable through two large gateways. These buildings are particularly interesting for their assimilative architectural styles. Shuja-ud-daula&#x27;s wife was the well known Bahu Begum, who married the Nawab in 1743 and continued to reside in Faizabad, her residence being the Moti-Mahal. Close by at Jawaharbagh lies her Maqbara, where she was buried after her death in 1816. It is considered to be one of the finest buildings of its kind in Awadh, which was built at the cost of three lakh rupees by her chief advisor Darab Ali Khan. A fine view of the city is obtainable from top of the begum&#x27;s tomb. Bahu Begum was a woman of great distinction and rank, bearing dignity. Most of the Muslim buildings of Faizabad are attributed to her. From the date of Bahu Begum&#x27;s death in 1815 till the annexation of Avadh, the city of Faizabad gradually fell into decay. The glory of Faizabad finally eclipsed with the shifting of capital from Faizabad to Lucknow by Nawab Asaf-ud-daula.

The Nawabs of Awadh were a Persian Shia Muslim dynasty from Nishapur, who not only encouraged the existing Persian-language belle-lettrist activity to shift from Delhi, but also invited, and received, a steady stream of scholars, poets, jurists, architects, and painters from Iran. Thus Persian was used in government, in academic instruction, in high culture, and in court.

Saadat Khan Burhanul Mulk was appointed Nawab in 1722 and established his court in Faizabad near Lucknow. He took advantage of a weakening Mughal Empire in Delhi to lay the foundation of the Awadh dynasty. His successor was Safdarjung the very influential noble at the Mughal court in Delhi. Until 1819, Awadh was a province of the Mughal Empire administered by a Nawab.

Awadh was known as the granary of India and was important strategically for the control of the Doab, the fertile plain between the Ganges and the Yamuna rivers. It was a wealthy kingdom, able to maintain its independence against threats from the Marathas, the British and the Afghans.

The third Nawab, Shuja-ud-Daula fell out with the British after aiding Mir Qasim the fugitive Nawab of Bengal. He was comprehensively defeated in the Battle of Buxar by the British East India Company, after which he was forced to pay heavy penalties and cede parts of his territory. The British appointed a resident at Lucknow in 1773, and over time gained control of more territory and authority in the state. They were disinclined to capture Awadh outright, because that would bring them face to face with the Marathas and the remnants of the Mughal Empire.

Asaf-ud-Daula, the fourth Nawab and son of Shuja-ud-Daula, moved the capital from Faizabad to Lucknow in 1775 and laid the foundation of a great city. His rule saw the building of the Asafi Imambara and Rumi Darwaza, built by Raja Tikait Rai Nawab Wazir (Diwan) of Awadh, which till date are the biggest architectural marvels in the city. Asaf-ud-Daula made Lucknow one of the most prosperous and glittering cities in all India. It is said, he moved because he wanted to get away from the control of a dominant mother. On such a thread did the fate of the city of Lucknow depend.

In 1798, the fifth Nawab Wazir Ali Khan alienated both his people and the British, and was forced to abdicate. The British then helped Saadat Ali Khan to the throne. Saadat Ali Khan was a puppet king, who in the treaty of 1801 ceded half of Awadh to the British East India Company and also agreed to disband his troops in favour of a hugely expensive, British-run army. This treaty effectively made part of the state of Awadh a vassal to the British East India Company, though they continued to be part of the Mughal Empire in name till 1819.

Coins were struck under the nawab&#x27;s control for the first time in 1737, at a new mint opened in Banaras, although the coins named the Mughal emperor, not the Nawab. After the Battle of Buxar, the British seized Banaras, and so the mint was moved in 1776 to Lucknow. From there, coins in the name of the Mughal emperor continued to be struck, and they continued to name Muhammadabad Banaras as the mint. It was only in 1819 that Nawab Ghaziuddin Haidar finally started to strike coins in his own name. Soon thereafter, Awadhi coins started to feature the kingdom&#x27;s European style coat of arms.

The wars and transactions in which Shuja-ud-Daula was engaged, both with and against the British East India Company, led to the addition of Karra, Allahabad, Fatehgarh, Kanpur, Etawah, Mainpuri, Farrukhabad and Rohilkhand, to the Oudh dimensions, and thus they remained until the treaty of 1801 with Saadat Ali Khan, by which province was reduced considerably as half of Oudh was ceded to the British East India Company. Khairigarh, Kanchanpur, and what is now the Nepal Terai, were ceded in 1816, in liquidation of Ghazi ud din Haider&#x27;s loan of a million sterling towards the expense of Nepal War; and at the same time pargana of Nawabganj was added to Gonda district in exchange for Handia, or Kawai, which was transferred from Pratapgarh to Allahabad.

=== British rule ===
The treaty of 1801 formed an arrangement that was very beneficial to the company. They were able to use Awadh&#x27;s vast treasuries, repeatedly digging into them for loans at reduced rates. In addition, the revenues from running Awadh&#x27;s armed forces brought them useful revenues while it acted as a buffer state. The Nawabs were ceremonial kings, limited to pomp and show but with little influence over matters of state. By the mid-19th century, however, the British had grown impatient with the arrangement and wanted direct control. They started looking about for an excuse, which the powerless Nawabs had to provide. On 1 May 1816, a British protectorate was signed.
In 1856 the East India Company annexed the state under the Doctrine of Lapse, which was placed under a Chief Commissioner. Wajid Ali Shah, the then Nawab, was imprisoned, and then exiled by the company to Calcutta (Bengal). In the subsequent Revolt of 1857, his 14-year-old son Birjis Qadra son of Begum Hazrat Mahal was crowned ruler, and Sir Henry Lawrence killed in the hostilities.

In the Indian Rebellion of 1857 (also known as the First War of Indian Independence and the Indian Mutiny), the rebels took control of Awadh, and it took the British 18 months to reconquer the region, months which included the famous Siege of Lucknow.

The &quot;Tarai&quot; to the north of Bahraich including large quantity of valuable forest and grazing ground, was made over to the Nepal &quot;Darbar&quot; in 1860, in recognition of their services during the Revolt of 1857, and in 1874 some further cessions, on a much smaller scale, but without any apparent reason, were made in favour of the same Government.

In 1877 the offices of lieutenant-governor of the North-Western Provinces and chief commissioner of Oudh were combined in the same person; and in 1902, when the new name of United Provinces of Agra and Oudh was introduced, the title of chief commissioner was dropped, though Oudh still retained some marks of its former independence.

==Demographics==
===Religion===
A vast majority of the population practices Hinduism. It is also home to the Ram Janmabhoomi, an important pilgrimage site in Hinduism that marks where the deity Rama was born. The Muslim community has a strong presence in the urban areas of Awadh, such as Prayagraj and the capital city of Lucknow, which has a large Shia Muslim population. Other than that they are mostly concentrated in the Devipatan division.

== Culture ==
The region of Awadh is considered to be the center of Ganga-Jamuni culture.

=== Sham-e-Awadh ===
Sham-e-Awadh is a popularised term referring to the &quot;glorious evenings&quot; in the Awadh capitals of Faizabad and later (and even today and to a greater extent) Lucknow.

Awadh was established in 1722. with Faizabad as its capital. Nawab Shuja-ud-Daula&#x27;s son Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula, the fourth Nawab of Awadh, shifted the capital from Faizabad to Lucknow; this led to the decline of Faizabad and rise of Lucknow.

Just as Banares (Varanasi) is known for its mornings, so Lucknow is for its evenings. Many of its well-known buildings were erected on the banks of the Gomti River in the time of Nawabs. The Nawabs used to take in a view of the river Gomti and its architecture in the evening hours, giving rise to Sham-e-Awadh&#x27;s romantic reputation.

There is a saying:&#x27;Subah-e-Benares&#x27;, &#x27;Sham-e-Awadh&#x27;, &#x27;Shab-e-Malwa&#x27; meaning mornings of the Benares, evenings of the Awadh and nights of Malwa.

=== Awadhi cuisine ===
Awadhi Cuisine is primarily from the city of Lucknow and its environs. The cooking patterns of the city are similar to those of Central Asia, the Middle East, and Northern India as well. The cuisine consists of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. Awadh has been greatly influenced by Mughal cooking techniques, and the cuisine of Lucknow bears similarities to those of Kashmir, Punjab and Hyderabad; and the city is famous for its Nawabi foods.

The &#x27; and &#x27; of Awadh gave birth to the dum style of cooking or the art of cooking over a slow fire, which has become synonymous with Lucknow today. Their spread would consist of elaborate dishes like kebabs, kormas, biryani, kaliya, nahari-kulchas, zarda, sheermal, Taftan, and . The richness of Awadh cuisine lies not only in the variety of cuisine but also in the ingredients used like mutton, paneer, and rich spices including cardamom and saffron.

===In popular culture===
The events surrounding the 1856 overthrow of Wajid Ali Shah and the annexation of Awadh by the British are depicted in the 1977 film &quot;The Chess Players&quot; by the acclaimed Indian director Satyajit Ray. This film is based on famous Urdu story Shatranj Ke Khilari by the great Hindi-Urdu novelist writer Munshi Premchand.

The 1961 film &quot;Gunga Jumna&quot; is portrayed in Awadh and was noted for its use of the Awadhi dialect in mainstream Hindi cinema.

The novel &quot;Umrao Jaan Ada&quot; as well as the subsequent films are based on two cultural cities of Awadh, Lucknow and Faizabad.

The region has been in the center of various period films of Bollywood and modern films like &quot;Main, Meri Patni Aur Woh&quot; and &quot;Paa&quot; to name a few. It has also been shot in various songs of Bollywood.

<text>Sir Rabbie Langanai Namaliu (3 April 1947 – 31 March 2023) was a Papua New Guinean politician. He served as the fourth prime minister of Papua New Guinea from 4 July 1988 to 17 July 1992 as leader of the Pangu Party.

==Biography==
Namaliu was born in East New Britain Province, Territory of New Guinea on 3 April 1947. An ethnic Tolai, Namaliu came from East New Britain. He was educated in Papua New Guinea and in Canada, at the University of Victoria in Victoria, British Columbia. Prior to his political career he was an academic in the field of political science at the University of Papua New Guinea.

After Papua New Guinea&#x27;s independence in 1975, Namaliu was one of four leading civil servants, together with Mekere Morauta, Anthony Siaguru, and Charles Lepani who led the formation of public administration and public policy in PNG&#x27;s immediate post-independence years. They were often called &quot;Gang of Four&quot;.

Before becoming prime minister, he served as foreign minister for the first time, from 1982 to 1984, by this time beginning his long alliance with Michael Somare, who was prime minister at that time and served as foreign minister while Namaliu was prime minister. Namaliu was appointed Leader of the Opposition in June 1988. and replaced Paias Wingti as the Prime Minister in July 1988.

He was appointed foreign minister in 2002, as part of the National Alliance Party government of Michael Somare. He served as foreign minister until 12 July 2006 when he became finance minister during a cabinet reshuffle. Namaliu subsequently lost his seat of Kokopo Open at the 2007 Election but had not ruled out a future return to politics. He lost his cabinet post when the new government, again led by Somare, took office in August 2007.

As a former prime minister of Papua New Guinea, he was a member of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom from 1989, and was styled &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; with the postnominal letters &#x27;P.C.&#x27;.

Namaliu married the civil servant, Margaret Nakikus, in 1987. She headed the country&#x27;s National Planning Office. They had two son and a daughter. After his defeat in parliament in 1992 he left politics to be with Nakikus, who had incurable leukaemia and was in hospital in Brisbane, Australia. She died in 1992.

Namaliu died on 31 March 2023, at the age of 75 about 3 days before his 76th birthday.

<text>The , a contraction of and formerly until 2 September 2019, is a Japanese &quot;keiretsu&quot; or conglomerate headquartered in Shibuya, Tokyo. While a multinational corporation, its main operation is , a wholly-owned subsidiary operating railways in the Greater Tokyo Area.

==History==


The oldest predecessor of company was the , opened in 1908. The railway&#x27;s operations were converted into a kabushiki gaisha (company) in 1910. Keita Gotō, now a notable Japanese industrialist, was appointed as the CEO in 1920 and he began a major expansion program.

The most important predecessor was first registered on September 2, 1922, as the and is related to the construction of Den-en-chōfu. It was originally founded by the developers of Den-en-chōfu). It was acquired by the Musashi Electric Railway in 1924, shortly before Musashi was renamed into the , also known as the Toyoko, in the same year.

After Musashi/Toyoko&#x27;s acquisition, the Meguro-Kamata Electric Railway initially operated as a subsidiary of Toyoko. It was not until 16 October 1939 that both Toyoko and Meguro-Kamata Electric railways were formally merged and the new company took the Toyoko name.

In 1938, Toyoko established Toyoko Eiga, possibly for competition with Ichizo Kobayashi&#x27;s Toho Company. It became the Toei Company in 1951.

Toyoko took its current name on 1 May 1942, after the Japanese government compelled the company to acquire the Odawara Express Railway and the Keihin Electric Railway in 1943 to support Japan&#x27;s efforts in Pacific War of World War II. In 1944 it also acquired the Keio Teito Electric Railway (which had merged with Odawara Express before in 1940).

In 1948, after the war, Tokyu divested the acquired companies, and the divested companies are now known as Odakyu Electric Railway, Keikyu Corporation, and Keio Corporation respectively. The 1943–48 era of Tokyu was colloquially known as &quot;Dai-Tokyu&quot; (lit. &quot;Great Tokyu&quot;).

==Tokyu lines==
Tokyu also operates the Kodomonokuni Line (Nagatsuta Station – Kodomonokuni Station, 3.4 km) under contract with and on behalf of Yokohama Minatomirai Railway Company.
==Related businesses==
The Tokyu Group also owns two smaller railroad companies, Ueda Kōtsū and Izukyū Corporation; several bus companies; and a major upscale department store chain, the Tokyu Department Store operating in Japan and the MBK Center in Bangkok, Thailand. Other retail operations include Tokyu Hands stores (except for the two locations in Nagoya, which are owned by Sanco Creative Life Co., indirectly controlled by Kintetsu Group Holdings, and operated under license). It also runs a number of hotels under the names Tokyu/Pan Pacific in Japan and formerly owned the Pan Pacific Hotels abroad, which it sold to UOL Limited of Singapore.

Formerly the owner of Japan Air System (JAS), Tokyu used to be the largest shareholder of Japan Airlines Holdings (JAL) following JAS&#x27;s merger with JAL. The Tokyu Group also owns and operates the upscale Tokyu Hotels and budget Tokyu Inns.

From 1958 until 2001, Tokyu also owned the Japanese (now American) Shirokiya department store company. It was the owner of Mago Island until 2005, when Mel Gibson purchased it for US$15 million.

Tokyu Corporation is also the largest single shareholder in the Shizuoka Railway Company, but its holdings in the railway are not part of the group.

<text>Lucknow (; ) is the capital and the largest city of the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh and it is the administrative headquarters of the eponymous district and division. Having a population of 2.8 million as per 2011 census, it is the eleventh most populous city and the twelfth-most populous urban agglomeration of India. Lucknow has always been a multicultural city that flourished as a North Indian cultural and artistic hub, and the seat of power of Nawabs in the 18th and 19th centuries. It continues to be an important centre of governance, administration, education, commerce, aerospace, finance, pharmaceuticals, information technology, design, culture, tourism, music, and poetry. Lucknow, along with Agra and Varanasi, is in the Uttar Pradesh Heritage Arc, a chain of survey triangulations created by the Government of Uttar Pradesh to boost tourism in the state.

==Toponymy==
&quot;Lucknow&quot; is the anglicised spelling of the local pronunciation &quot;Lakhnau&quot;. According to one legend, the city is named after Lakshmana, a hero of the Hindu epic &quot;Ramayana&quot;. The legend states that Lakshmana had a palace or an estate in the area, which was called &quot;Lakshmanapuri&quot; (Sanskrit: लक्ष्मणपुरी, lit. &quot;Lakshmana&#x27;s city&quot;). The settlement came to be known as Lakhanpur (or Lachhmanpur) by the 11th century, and later, Lucknow.

A similar theory states that the city was known as &quot;Lakshmanavati&quot; (, fortunate) after Lakshmana. The name changed to &quot;Lakhanavati&quot;, then Lakhnauti and finally Lakhnau. Yet another theory states that the city&#x27;s name is connected with Lakshmi, the Hindu goddess of wealth. Over time, the name changed to Laksmanauti, Laksmnaut, Lakhsnaut, Lakhsnau and, finally, Lakhnau.

Another theory is that Lucknow was named after a very influential architect named Lakhna Ahir, who built the fort Qila Lakhna.

==History==
From 1350 onwards, Lucknow and parts of the Awadh region were ruled by the Delhi Sultanate, Sharqi Sultanate, Mughal Empire, Nawabs of Awadh, the British East India Company and the British Raj. 

For about eighty-four years (from 1394 to 1478), Awadh was part of the Sharqi Sultanate of Jaunpur. Emperor Humayun made it a part of the Mughal Empire around 1555. Emperor Jahangir (1569–1627) granted an estate in Awadh to a favoured nobleman, Sheikh Abdul Rahim, who later built Machchi Bhawan on this estate. It later became the seat of power from where his descendants, the &quot;Sheikhzadas&quot;, controlled the region.

The Nawabs of Lucknow (actually the Nawabs of Awadh) acquired the name after the reign of the third Nawab when Lucknow became their capital. The city became North India&#x27;s cultural capital, and its nawabs, best remembered for their refined and extravagant lifestyles, were patrons of the arts.

Under their dominion, music and dance flourished, and construction of numerous monuments took place. Of the monuments standing today, the Bara Imambara, the Chota Imambara, and the Rumi Darwaza are notable examples. One of the Nawab&#x27;s enduring legacies is the region&#x27;s syncretic Hindu–Muslim culture that has come to be known as the &quot;Ganga-Jamuni Tehzeeb&quot;.

Until 1719, the &quot;subah&quot; of Awadh was a province of the Mughal Empire administered by a governor appointed by the emperor. Persian adventurer Saadat Khan, also known as Burhan-ul-Mulk, was appointed &quot;Nizam&quot; of Awadh in 1722 and established his court in Faizabad, near Lucknow.

Many independent kingdoms, such as Awadh, were established as the Mughal Empire disintegrated. The third Nawab, Shuja-ud-Daula (r. 1753–1775), fell out with the British after aiding the fugitive Nawab of Bengal, Mir Qasim. Roundly defeated at the Battle of Buxar by the East India Company, he was forced to pay heavy penalties and surrender parts of his territory. Awadh&#x27;s capital, Lucknow rose to prominence when Asaf-ud-Daula, the fourth Nawab, shifted his court to the city from Faizabad in 1775. The British East India Company appointed a resident (ambassador) in 1773 and by early 19th century gained control of more territory and authority in the state.

They were, however, disinclined to capture Awadh outright and come face to face with the Maratha Empire and the remnants of the Mughal Empire. In 1798, the fifth Nawab Wazir Ali Khan alienated both his people and the British and was forced to abdicate. The British then helped Saadat Ali Khan take the throne. He became a puppet king, and in a treaty of 1801, yielded large part of Awadh to the East India Company while also agreeing to disband his own troops in favour of a hugely expensive, British-controlled army.

This treaty effectively made the state of Awadh a vassal of the East India Company, although it continued to be part of the Mughal Empire in name until 1819. The treaty of 1801 proved a beneficial arrangement for the East India Company as they gained access to Awadh&#x27;s vast treasuries, repeatedly digging into them for loans at reduced rates. In addition, the revenues from running Awadh&#x27;s armed forces brought them useful returns while the territory acted as a buffer state. The Nawabs were ceremonial kings, busy with pomp and show. By the mid-nineteenth century, however, the British had grown impatient with the arrangement and demanded direct control over Awadh.

In 1856, the East India Company first moved its troops to the border, then annexed the state for alleged maladministration. Awadh was placed under a chief commissioner – Sir Henry Lawrence. Wajid Ali Shah, the then Nawab, was imprisoned, then exiled by the East India Company to Calcutta. In the subsequent Indian Rebellion of 1857, his 14-year-old son Birjis Qadra, whose mother was Begum Hazrat Mahal, was crowned ruler. Following the rebellion&#x27;s defeat, Begum Hazrat Mahal and other rebel leaders sought asylum in Nepal.

It is the most important center of Shia Islam in the Indian Subcontinent and has influence of Persian, Shiite, Arabic and British culture and tradition in the architecture, language and customs.
Lucknow was one of the major centres of the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and actively participated in India&#x27;s independence movement, emerging as a strategically important North Indian city. During the Rebellion, the majority of the East India Company&#x27;s troops were recruited from both the people and nobility of Awadh. The rebels seized control of the state, and it took the British 18 months to reconquer the region. During that period, the garrison based at the Residency in Lucknow was besieged by rebel forces during the Siege of Lucknow. The siege was relieved first by forces under the command of Sir Henry Havelock and Sir James Outram, followed by a stronger force under Sir Colin Campbell. Today, the ruins of the Residency and the &quot;Shaheed Smarak&quot; offer an insight into Lucknow&#x27;s role in the events of 1857.

With the rebellion over, Oudh returned to British governance under a chief commissioner. In 1877, the offices of lieutenant-governor of the North-Western Provinces and chief commissioner of Oudh were combined; then in 1902, the title of chief commissioner was dropped with the formation of the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh, although Oudh still retained some marks of its former independence.
The Khilafat Movement had an active base of support in Lucknow, creating united opposition to British rule. In 1901, after remaining the capital of Oudh since 1775, Lucknow, with a population of 264,049, was merged into the newly formed United Provinces of Agra and Oudh. In 1920, the provincial seat of government moved from Allahabad to Lucknow. Upon Indian independence in 1947, the United Provinces were reorganised into the state of Uttar Pradesh, and Lucknow remained its capital.

Lucknow witnessed some of the pivotal moments in the history of India. One is the first meeting of the stalwarts Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Mohd Ali Jinnah during the Indian National Congress session of 1916 (the Lucknow pact was signed and moderates and extremists came together through the efforts of Annie Besant during this session only).
The Congress President for that session, Ambica Charan Majumdar in his address said that &quot;If the Congress was buried at Surat, it is reborn in Lucknow in the garden of Wajid Ali Shah.&quot;

The Kakori conspiracy involving Ram Prasad Bismil, Ashfaq Ullah Khan, Rajendra Nath Lahiri, Roshan Singh and others, followed by the Kakori trial which captured the imagination of the country, also took place in Lucknow.

Culturally, Lucknow has also had a tradition of courtesans, with popular culture distilling it in the avatar of the fictional Umrao Jaan.

Along with the rest of India, Lucknow became independent from Britain on 15 August 1947. It has been listed as the 17th-fastest growing city in India and 74th in the world.

==Architecture==

Lucknow&#x27;s buildings show different styles of architecture with the many iconic buildings built during the British and Mughal era. More than half of these buildings lie in the old part of the city. The Uttar Pradesh Tourism Department organises a &quot;Heritage Walk&quot; for tourists covering the popular monuments. Among the extant architecture, there are religious buildings such as Imambaras, mosques, and other Islamic shrines as well as secular structures such as enclosed gardens, &quot;baradaris&quot;, and palace complexes.
Bara Imambara in Hussainabad is a colossal edifice built in 1784 by the then Nawab of Lucknow, Asaf-ud-Daula. It was originally built to provide assistance to people affected by the deadly famine, which struck the whole of Uttar Pradesh in the same year. It is the largest hall in Asia without any external support from wood, iron or stone beams. The monument required approximately 22,000 labourers during construction.

The tall Rumi Darwaza, built by Nawab Asaf-ud-daula (r. 1775–1797) in 1784, served as the entrance to the city of Lucknow. It is also known as the Turkish Gateway, as it was erroneously thought to be identical to the gateway at Constantinople. The edifice provides the west entrance to the Great Imambara and is embellished with lavish decorations.
Various architectural styles can be seen in the historical areas of Lucknow. The University of Lucknow shows a huge inspiration from the European style while Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture is prominently present in the Uttar Pradesh Vidhan Sabha building and Charbagh Railway station. Dilkusha Kothi is the remains of a palace constructed by the British resident Major Gore Ouseley around 1800 and showcases English Baroque architecture. It served as a hunting lodge for the Nawab of Awadhs and as a summer resort.

The Chattar Manzil, which served as the palace for the rulers of Awadh and their wives is topped by an umbrella-like dome and so named on account of &quot;Chattar&quot; being the Hindi word for &quot;umbrella&quot;.
Opposite Chattar Manzil stands the &#x27;Lal Baradari&#x27; built by Nawab Saadat Ali Khan I between 1789 and 1814. It functioned as a throne room at coronations for the royal courts. The building is now used as a museum and contains delicately executed portraits of men who played major roles in the administration of the kingdom of Oudh.

Another example of mixed architectural styles is La Martiniere College, which shows a fusion of Indian and European ideas. It was built by Major-General Claude Martin who was born in Lyon and died in Lucknow on 13 September 1800. Originally named &quot;Constantia&quot;, the ceilings of the building are domed with no wooden beams used for construction. Glimpses of Gothic architecture can also be seen in the college building.
Lucknow&#x27;s Asafi Imambara exhibits vaulted halls as its architectural speciality.
The Bara Imambara, Chhota Imambara and Rumi Darwaza stand in testament to the city&#x27;s Nawabi mixture of Mughlai and Turkish styles of architecture while La Martiniere college bears witness to the Indo-European style. Even the new buildings are fashioned using characteristic domes and pillars, and at night these illuminated monuments become the city&#x27;s main attractions.
Around Hazratganj, the city&#x27;s central shopping area, there is a fusion of old and modern architecture. It has a multi-level parking lot in place of an old and dilapidated police station making way for extending the corridors into pebbled pathways, adorned with piazzas, green areas and wrought-iron and cast-iron lamp-posts, reminiscent of the Victorian era, flank both sides of the street.

==Culture==

In common with other metropolitan cities across India, Lucknow is multicultural and multilingual. Many of the cultural traits and customs peculiar to Lucknow have become living legends today. The city&#x27;s contemporary culture is the result of the amalgamation of the Hindu and Muslim rulers who ruled the city simultaneously. The credit for this goes to the secular and syncretic traditions of the Nawabs of Awadh, who took a keen interest in every walk of life and encouraged these traditions to attain a rare degree of sophistication. Modern-day Lucknowites are known for their polite and polished way of speaking which is noticed by visitors. The residents of Lucknow call themselves &quot;Lucknowites&quot; or &quot;Lakhnavi&quot;. It also represents the melting pot of globalisation where the legacy of Nawab&#x27;s culture continues to be reflected in the traditional vocabulary of the Hindi language of the city along with better avenues for modernisation present here.

=== Traditional outfit ===

Lucknow is known for its ghararas. It is a traditional women&#x27;s outfit that originated from the Nawabs of Awadh. It is a pair of loose trousers with pleats below the knee worn with a kurta (shirt) and a dupatta (veil). It is embroidered with zari and zardozi along with gota (decorative lace on the knee area). This dress is made from over of fabric, mostly silk, brocade and kamkhwab.

===Language and poetry===
Although Uttar Pradesh&#x27;s primary official language is Hindi, the most commonly spoken language is colloquial Hindustani. Indian English is also well understood and is widely used for business and administrative purposes, as a result of India&#x27;s British heritage and Commonwealth tradition, as well as globalisation. The Urdu language is also a part of Lucknowi culture and heritage. It is mostly used by wealthier families, the remaining members of the royal family as well as in Urdu poetry and on public signs. The government has taken many innovative steps to promote Urdu. Awadhi, a dialect of the Hindi dialect continuum, is the native dialect of Lucknow and has played an important role in Lucknow&#x27;s history and is still used in the city&#x27;s rural areas and by the urban population on the streets.

Historically, Lucknow was considered one of the great centres of Muslim culture. Two poets, Mir Babar Ali Anis and Mirza Dabeer, became legendary exponents of a unique genre of Muslim elegiacal poetry called &quot;marsiya&quot; centred on Imam Husain&#x27;s supreme sacrifice in the Battle of Karbala, which is commemorated during the annual observance of Muharram.

The revolutionary Ram Prasad Bismil, who was hanged by the British at Gorakhpur jail, was largely influenced by the culture of Lucknow and remembered its name in his poetry. Surrounding towns such as Kakori, Daryabad, Fatehpur, Barabanki, Rudauli, and Malihabad produced many eminent Urdu poets and litterateurs including Mohsin Kakorvi, Majaz, Khumar Barabankvi and Josh Malihabadi.

===Cuisine===

The Awadh region has its own distinct Nawabi-style cuisine. Since ages, the &quot;Bawarchis&quot; (chefs) and &quot;Rakabdars&quot; (royal chefs) have developed great finesse in cooking and presentation of food, under royal patronage. This gave rise to the art of cooking over a slow fire (or &quot;Dum&quot; style cooking), which has become synonymous with &quot;Awadhi&quot; cuisine. These &quot;Bawarchis&quot; added elaborately prepared dishes like &quot;kababs&quot;, &quot;kormas&quot;, &quot;kaliya&quot;, &quot;nahari-kulchas&quot;, &quot;zarda&quot;, &quot;sheermal&quot;, &quot;roomali rotis&quot; and &quot;warqi parathas&quot; to the traditional &quot;Awadhi&quot; &quot;dastarkhwaan&quot; (feast of dishes). The best-known dishes of this area consist of biryanis, kebabs and breads. Kebabs are served in a variety of styles; &quot;kakori&quot;, &quot;galawati&quot;, &quot;shami&quot;, &quot;boti&quot;, &quot;patili-ke&quot;, &quot;ghutwa&quot; and &quot;seekh&quot; are among the available varieties. Tunde ke kabab restaurants are popular for a type of soft kebab developed by a one-armed chef (hence the name Tunday) for a Nawab who had lost his teeth. The reputation of Lucknow&#x27;s kebabs is not limited to the local population and the dish attracts people from other cities as well as other countries.

* Lucknow Mahotsav
Lucknow Festival is organised every year to showcase Uttar Pradesh art and culture and to promote tourism. With 1975–76 designated South Asian Tourism Year, Lucknow took the opportunity to promote the city&#x27;s art, culture and tourism to national and international tourists.

* Muharram
:Lucknow is known as a seat of Shia Islam and the epitome of Shia culture in India. Muslims observe Muharram, the first month of the Islamic calendar and on Ashura (the tenth day of the month) mourn the memory of Imam Husain, grandson of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad. Muharram processions in Lucknow have a special significance and began during the reign of the Awadh Nawabs.

:Processions such as &quot;Shahi Zarih&quot;, &quot;Jaloos-e-Mehndi&quot;, &quot;Alam-e-Ashura&quot; and &quot;Chup Tazia&quot; had special significance by the Shia community and were affected with great religious zeal and fervour until 1977 the government of Uttar Pradesh banned public Azadari processions. For the following twenty years, processions and gatherings took place in private or community spaces including Talkatora Karbala, Bara Imambara (Imambara Asifi), Chota Imambara (Imambara Husainabad), Dargah Hazrat Abbas, Shah Najaf and Imambara Ghufran Ma&#x27;ab. The ban was partially lifted in 1997 and Shias were successful in taking out the first Azadari procession in January 1998 on the 21st of Ramadan, the Muslim fasting month. The Shias are authorised to stage nine processions out of the nine hundred that are listed in the register of the Shias.

The procession originated in Lucknow before spreading to other parts of South Asia. Dating back to the era of the Nawabs, it was started by Nawab Ahmed Ali Khan Shaukat Yar Jung a descendant of Bahu Begum. It has become one of the most important Azadari processions in Lucknow and one of the nine permitted by the government. This last mourning procession takes place on the morning of the 8th of Rabi&#x27; al-awwal, the third Muslim month and includes &quot;alam&quot; (flags), &quot;Zari&quot; and a &quot;ta&#x27;zieh&quot; (an imitation of the mausoleums in Karbala). It originates at the Imambara Nazim Saheb in Victoria Street then moves in complete silence through Patanala until it terminates at the Karbala Kazmain, where the colossal black &quot;ta&#x27;zieh&quot; is buried.

===Lucknow Chikan===

&quot;Chikankari&quot; is an embroidery work well known all over India. This 400-year-old art in its present form was developed in Lucknow and it remains the only location where the skill is practised today. &quot;Chikankari&quot; constitutes &#x27;shadow work&#x27; and is a delicate and artistic hand embroidery done using white thread on fine white cotton cloth such as fine muslin or chiffon. Yellowish &quot;muga&quot; silk is sometimes used in addition to the white thread. The work is done on caps, &quot;kurta&quot;s, &quot;sari&quot;s, scarfs, and other vestments. The &quot;chikan&quot; industry, almost unknown under the Nawabs, has not only survived but has flourished. About 2,500 entrepreneurs have engaged in manufacturing &quot;chikan&quot; for sale in local, national and international markets with Lucknow the largest exporter of &quot;chikan&quot; embroidered garments.

<text>Agnostic Front is an American hardcore punk band from New York City. Founded in 1980, the band is considered an important influence on the New York hardcore scene, as well as a pioneer of the crossover thrash genre.

==History==
===First era (1980–1992)===
Formed in 1980 with Vincent &quot;Vinnie Stigma&quot; Capuccio (formerly of the Eliminators) on lead guitar, with Diego on bass, Rob Krekus (aka Robby Crypt Crash) on drums and John Watson on vocals. Despite being billed at their first concert as the Zoo Crew, Stigma introduced them as Agnostic Front, saying that the poster had been made prior to deciding on the name. They soon added Ray Barbieri, aka Raybeez, on drums and Adam Mucci on bass. After Watson was arrested, the band hired James Kontra as their vocalist, who eventually quit before a performance at Great Gildersleeves after a disagreement with Capuccio about how to hand out stickers. Although never having spoken to him before, Stigma told some of his friends to ask Roger Miret (former bass player of the Psychos) if he wanted to be the vocalist of Agnostic Front, because he liked his style of slam dancing. In 1983, this lineup recorded their debut EP &quot;United Blood&quot;. The EP was officially released later that year, however by that point Mucci had departed from the band, and been replaced by Todd Youth.

During its initial phase, the band consisted entirely of skinheads. Although this would change over time, Agnostic Front would continue to feature skinheads as part of their lineup. This led to a belief among some that the band espoused ultra-nationalist or fascist politics, an assertion denied by vocalist Roger Miret in a 1985 &quot;Flipside&quot; interview:
&quot;...We&#x27;re skinheads. And the skinheads in England have a very bad name like with the fascists and stuff like that. But this is America not England. Just because the skinheads are fascists over there doesn&#x27;t mean we got to grow our hair out if we don&#x27;t feel like it... We love our country — but not necessarily how our government works.&quot;

The follow-up, &quot;Victim in Pain&quot; (1984), is regarded as a seminal New York hardcore release. Dave Jones replaced Raybeez on drums after a mutual agreement among the band members that Raybeez &quot;needed time&quot; to address a developing drug problem. Dave Jones was &quot;a kid from New Jersey&quot; who had previously played with the band Mental Abuse. Rob Kabula took over on bass. In 1984, Jimmy &quot;The Kid&quot; Colletti from Justified Violence joined on drums when the band went to tour with The Exploited later that year. The album pushed the band to the forefront of New York&#x27;s fledgling hardcore scene, which was centered around CBGB, where they played with bands like Cro-Mags and Murphy&#x27;s Law. Roger Miret asserts that all the songs on the album &quot;are totally inspired by the streets of New York and my life and what was going on with my friends. It was dangerous. We did what we had to do to survive by any means necessary. It was like a war or a battlefield, and we stood our ground&quot;.

1986&#x27;s &quot;Cause for Alarm&quot; was a difficult album to record, due to constant lineup changes and personnel problems. Released on Combat Records, it added thrash metal influences. With other bands such as Suicidal Tendencies and Stormtroopers of Death, this album would mark AF&#x27;s foray into the world of crossover thrash. It also featured some lyrics written by Peter Steele and drumming by Louie Beateaux (both of Carnivore). Miret left the band for four months between the recording and release of &quot;Cause for Alarm&quot;, and was replaced by Carl Demola.

With yet another new lineup, the band soon released &quot;Liberty and Justice For...&quot; in 1987. The album featured stripped down punk with a lack of thrash influences, yet it contained many metal-style guitar solos. It did not sell nearly as well as previous releases. Sometime later, Miret was arrested on drug charges after releasing a live album, and spent his time in prison writing new songs while Stigma and the band toured Europe for the first time. The lyrics written by Miret while incarcerated formed most of 1992&#x27;s &quot;One Voice&quot;, which featured members of Madball and Sick of It All. Not long after its release, the band decided to call it quits. Their last show was at CBGB on December 20, 1992. The show was recorded for the live album &quot;Last Warning&quot; which was released by Roadrunner Records in 1993.

===Second era (1996–present)===

Stigma and Miret reformed Agnostic Front in May 1996 and did a few reunion shows in December 1996, signing to Epitaph Records and recruiting Jimmy Colletti on drums and Rob Kabula on bass, who was playing with Against the Grain at the time. Their latest venture was titled &quot;Something&#x27;s Gotta Give&quot;. In 1999, they followed up with &quot;Riot, Riot, Upstart&quot;. They also won an MTV Award for the title track music video. Their comeback albums have sold well and been mostly acclaimed by music critics for their pure hardcore punk sound.

In 2001, they released the album &quot;Dead Yuppies&quot;. Songs from this album were rarely played live, as the band considered it more a product of Loved and Hated, Jimmy Colletti&#x27;s side-project band.

In 2002, Miret worked on a side-project band, Roger Miret and the Disasters, looking for a sound akin to old-school punk and Oi!. Also that year, the band appeared in Matthew Barney&#x27;s film &quot;Cremaster 3&quot; along with Murphy&#x27;s Law.

Agnostic Front came out in 2004 with &quot;Another Voice&quot;. The album was regarded mainly as a follow-up to &quot;One Voice&quot;. The album, however, did receive some criticism from fans and the press for apparently changing their music to fit the current wave of &#x27;tough guy&#x27; bands. Musically, the album bears resemblance to bands that were heavily influenced by Agnostic Front, such as Hatebreed. Miret&#x27;s vocals on the album particularly seemed to turn off many less hardcore punk-oriented fans. Later, the track &quot;Peace&quot; was contributed to the mash-up album &quot;Threat: Music That Inspired the Movie&quot;, where it was remixed by Schizoid and renamed &quot;World at War&quot;.

On March 7, 2006, Agnostic Front released the DVD &quot;Live at CBGB&quot;. This follows the efforts of many bands that tried to save CBGB from shutting down. Miret claims that &quot;We played more shows at CBGB than any band ever, and we played more benefit shows for CBGB than any band ever&quot; when the club did close, most nostalgia focused on 1970s punk bands.

On November 6, 2007, Agnostic Front released the album &quot;Warriors&quot; with the hit &quot;For My Family&quot; which was largely a continuation of the band&#x27;s crossover thrash sound.

For the 25th anniversary of their debut LP &quot;Victim in Pain&quot;, Bridge Nine Records released remastered versions of said album along with their first EP, &quot;United Blood&quot;, on November 17, 2009.

The band performed on the Persistence Tour in Europe in the winter of 2009 and have were confirmed for Rebellion Festival 2012 in Blackpool, England.

In 2015, the band released the album &quot;The American Dream Died&quot; via Nuclear Blast Records which consisted mostly of the bands older style of music with a modern touch. The band continued to tour extensively in Europe as well as the U.S. in support of the record.

In 2017, Stigma and Miret appeared in a documentary about Agnostic Front, &quot;The Godfathers of Hardcore&quot;, directed by Ian McFarland.

In 2022, it was revealed that Pokey Mo had parted ways with Agnostic Front in 2020 and that Danny Lamagna would be their new drummer.

<text>The Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (, KNAW) is an organization dedicated to the advancement of science and literature in the Netherlands. The academy is housed in the Trippenhuis in Amsterdam.

In addition to various advisory and administrative functions it operates a number of research institutes and awards many prizes, including the Lorentz Medal in theoretical physics, the Dr Hendrik Muller Prize for Behavioural and Social Science and the Heineken Prizes.

== Main functions ==
The academy advises the Dutch government on scientific matters. While its advice often pertains to genuine scientific concerns, it also counsels the government on such topics as policy on careers for researchers or the Netherlands&#x27; contribution to major international projects. The academy offers solicited and unsolicited advice to parliament, ministries, universities and research institutes, funding agencies and international organizations.

* Advising the government on matters related to scientific research
* Providing a forum for the scientific world and promoting international scientific cooperation
* Acting as an umbrella organization for the institutes primarily engaged in basic and strategic scientific research and disseminating information

== Members and organization ==

The members are appointed for life by co-optation. Nominations for candidate membership by persons or organizations outside the academy are accepted. The acceptance criterion is delivered scientific achievements. Academy membership is therefore regarded as a great honor, and prestigious. Besides regular members, there are foreign members and corresponding members. Since a new membership system was introduced in 2011 there will be no new corresponding members. Each year a maximum of sixteen members are appointed to the academy.
The Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences has long embraced the entire field of learning. The Royal Academy comprises two departments, consisting of around 500 members:
* Science (mathematics, physics, astronomy, life sciences, and engineering sciences)
* Humanities and Social Sciences (humanities, law, behavioural sciences and social sciences)

Both departments have their own board. The departments, in turn, are divided into sections. The highest organ in the academy is the general meeting of members, the united meeting of both departments. The president was Frits van Oostrom until 1 May 2008, after which he was succeeded by Robbert Dijkgraaf. Both van Oostrom in his leaving address and Dijkgraaf in his inaugural address have voiced their worries about the low level of funding in science in the Netherlands compared to almost all other western countries. A list of presidents of the academy is as follows:

* 1973–1978 Hendrik Casimir
* 1978–1981 Samuel Dresden
* 1981–1984 André Donner
* 1984–1990 David de Wied
* 1990–1996 Pieter Drenth
* 1996–1999 Pieter Zandbergen
* 1999–2002 Robert S. Reneman
* 2002–2005 Willem Levelt
* 2005–2008 Frits van Oostrom
* 2008–2012 Robbert Dijkgraaf
* 2012–2015 Hans Clevers
* 2015–2018 José van Dijck
* 2018–2020 Wim van Saarloos
* 2020–2022 Ineke Sluiter
* 2022–present Marileen Dogterom
== History ==
During the Kingdom of Holland, it was founded as the &quot;Koninklijk Instituut van Wetenschappen, Letterkunde en Schoone Kunsten&quot; (Royal Institute of Sciences, Literature and Fine Arts) by Lodewijk Napoleon on May 4, 1808. In 1816, after the occupation had ended, it was renamed to &quot;Koninklijk-Nederlandsch Instituut van Wetenschappen, Letteren en Schoone Kunsten&quot;. In 1851, it was disbanded and re-established as the &quot;Koninklijke Akademie van Wetenschappen&quot; and in 1938 obtained its present name. Since 1812, the academy has resided in the &quot;Trippenhuis&quot; in Amsterdam.

The institute was awarded the Gouden Ganzenveer in 1955.

== Research institutes ==
The following Research institutes are associated with the KNAW: 
* Data Archiving and Networked Services (since 2005)
* Fryske Akademy (since 1990, founded in 1938)
* (&quot;research institute for developmental biology and stem cells in the Netherlands&quot;) (since 1917)
* Huygens Institute for the History of the Netherlands (since 1992)
* International Institute of Social History (since 1979, founded in 1935)
* Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies (since 2001, founded in 1851)
* Meertens Instituut (since 1952)
* Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience (NIN) (established in 2005 as a merger of the Netherlands Institute for Brain Research (NIH, established in 1909) and the Netherlands Ophthalmic Research Institute (IOI, established in 1988))
* Netherlands Institute of Ecology (Nederlands Instituut voor Ecologie) (NIOO-KNAW) (since 1992)
* NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies (since 1999, founded in 1945)
* Nederlands Instituut voor Wetenschappelijke Informatiediensten (1997–2005)
* Nederlands Interdisciplinair Demografisch Instituut (since 2003)

* Rathenau Instituut (since 1994, previously NOTA (1987-1994))
* Westerdijk Fungal Biodiversity Institute (since 1904)

== Young Academy ==
De Jonge Akademie (The Young Academy) is a society of younger science researchers, founded in 2005 as part of the KNAW. Ten members are elected each year for a term of five years; members are scientists between 25 and 45 years old and are selected for a record of excellence in their research. It was modelled after the similar German Junge Akademie and both of these academies in turn were used as models for the Global Young Academy.

== Society of Arts ==
The Society of Arts (Akademie van Kunsten) is a society of prominent artists from various disciplines, including architecture, visual arts, dance, film, photography, literature, music and performing arts. Its aim is to be the place &quot;for debate about the value of art in society and about the relationship between art and science&quot;.The Society of Arts was established by the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2014. Both are seated in the 17th century Trippenhuis in Amsterdam.
At the start the Society of Arts had 19 members. Each year the number of members increases with 6 new members who are offered a membership for life. In 2022 the Society of Arts has 76 members. Members of the Society of Arts are elected by nomination. Anyone can nominate leading artists from all disciplines who have distinguished themselves on the basis of demonstrable artistic achievements.

<text>Domenico Carlo Maria Dragonetti (7 April 1763 – 16 April 1846) was an Italian double bass virtuoso and composer with a 3 string double bass. He stayed for thirty years in his hometown of Venice, Italy and worked at the Opera Buffa, at the Chapel of San Marco and at the Grand Opera in Vicenza. By that time he had become notable throughout Europe and had turned down several opportunities, including offers from the Tsar of Russia. In 1794, he finally moved to London to play in the orchestra of the King&#x27;s Theatre, and settled there for the remainder of his life. In fifty years, he became a prominent figure in the musical events of the English capital, performing at the concerts of the Philharmonic Society of London as well as in more private events, where he would meet the most influential persons in the country, like the Prince Consort and the Duke of Leinster. He was acquainted with composers Joseph Haydn and Ludwig van Beethoven, whom he visited on several occasions in Vienna, and to whom he showed the possibilities of the double bass as a solo instrument. His ability on the instrument also demonstrated the relevance of writing scores for the double bass in the orchestra separate from that of the cello, which was the common rule at the time. He is also remembered today for the &quot;Dragonetti bow&quot;, which he developed throughout his life.

==History==
===Venice 1763-1794===

Dragonetti was born in Venice, Italy of Pietro Dragonetti, a barber and amateur musician, and Caterina Calegari. He began playing the guitar and the double bass by himself on his father&#x27;s instruments. He was soon noticed by Doretti, a violinist and composer of ball music, who took him along for public performance in Venice. At the age of twelve, he was placed under the tuition of Berini, the best master for the double bass in Venice, who decided after only eleven lessons that he could not teach the boy anything more. At the age of thirteen, Dragonetti was appointed principal player at the Opera Buffa in Venice. At fourteen he was appointed principal double bass player in the Grand Opera Seria at the San Benedetto theatre.

When about eighteen, in Treviso, he was invited to join the quartet of the Tommasini, and was noticed by Morosini, procurator of San Marco, who indulged him in auditioning for the admission in the Chapel of San Marco. He made a first attempt in 1784, which was lost to Antonio Spinelli. He finally joined the institution on 13 September 1787 as the last of the five double bass players of the chapel with a yearly income of 25 ducats. He soon became the principal bassist. He later was offered a place by the Tsar of Russia, which was declined and got him a salary raise in the chapel. He became very famous at the time, started playing solo pieces, which was exceptional at the time for the double bass, and even got elected as one of the directors of a musical festival held for the coming of fourteen sovereign princes to the republic of Venice. One of his concertos was particularly remarked by the queen of Naples.

When in Vicenza for an engagement at the Grand Opera there, he acquired his famous Gasparo da Salò double bass from the Benedictine Nuns of the Convent of San Pietro (La Pieta) in Vicenza, which is now housed in the museum of St Mark&#x27;s Basilica. He was offered another position to the Tsar of Russia, which he declined after the procurators of St Mark increased his salary to an exceptional 50 ducats. They even granted him a leave for a year, with a continuation in his wages, to go to the King&#x27;s Theatre in London. That leave was extended for three more years afterwards, but finally Dragonetti never returned to Venice for more than a brief period during the French occupation of the city, 1805–1814.

Dragonetti had no close family, but had many close friends in the musical world in London. The story that he kept and often traveled with a collection of life-sized cloth mannequins, bringing them to his concerts and having them placed in front row seats of theaters, and even introducing one of these dolls as his wife, is completely unsubstantiated. He was an avid collector, and did indeed collect dolls, sometimes taking one along on trips to amuse the children, of whom he was very fond. He never did learn to speak English, expressing himself in a mixture of Italian, English, French and Venetian dialect, but was an astute businessman, and in fact, helped his surviving family in Venice financially. The authoritative source for information on him is the book of Dr. Fiona Palmer, Domenico Dragonetti in England (1794–1846) pub. Oxford University Press.

===London 1794-1846===
He left Venice on 16 September 1794, partly under the influence of his friend, Giovanni Battista Cimador (who composed a concerto for double bass), and participated in the first rehearsals at the King&#x27;s Theatre, on 20 October 1794 and finally appeared as orchestra member in the opera &quot;Zenobia in Palmira&quot;, by Giovanni Paisiello, on 20 December 1794. After only a few months, he became very famous in London, and his brilliant career was to last till the end.

Later he became intimate with the Prince Consort and the Duke of Leinster. He took part between 1816 and 1842, in forty-six concerts held by the Philharmonic Society of London. At the Italian Opera orchestra, he met the cellist Robert Lindley, who became his close friend and with whom he shared the stand during fifty-two years. They made a specialty at playing Arcangelo Corelli&#x27;s sonatas.

At the age of 82, Dragonetti visited Bonn in August 1845 to participate in the 3-day music festival held as part of the inauguration of the Beethoven Monument there. Various major Beethoven works were conducted by Louis Spohr and Franz Liszt.

He died in his Leicester square lodgings at the age of 83 and was buried on 23 April 1846 in the vaults of the Roman Catholic chapel of St Mary, Moorfields. In 1889, his remains were moved to the Roman Catholic cemetery at Wembley.

Vincent Novello and Count Carlo Pepoli (librettist of Vincenzo Bellini&#x27;s &quot;I puritani&quot;) were among his most famous friends in London.

===Vienna===
In 1791–1792, Joseph Haydn accepted a lucrative offer from German impresario Johann Peter Salomon to visit England and conduct new symphonies with large orchestras. The visit was a huge success and generated some of his best known work. Another trip was therefore scheduled in 1794–1795. On that second occasion, Haydn met Dragonetti, who became a very good friend, and who visited him in Vienna in 1799. On that first trip to Vienna, Dragonetti also met Beethoven in a famous encounter.
&quot;&quot;Two new and valuable, though but passing acquaintances were made by Beethoven this year, however - with Domenico Dragonetti, the greatest contrabassist known to history, and Johann Baptist Cramer, one of the greatest pianists. Dragonetti was not more remarkable for his astounding execution than for the deep, genuine musical feeling which elevated and ennobled it. He was now - in the spring of 1799, so far as the means are at hand of determining the time - returning to London from a visit to his native city, Venice, and his route took him to Vienna, where he remained several weeks. Beethoven and he soon met and they were mutually pleased with each other. Many years afterwards Dragonetti related the following anecdote to Samuel Appleby, Esq., of Brighton, England: &quot;Beethoven had been told that his new friend could execute violoncello music upon his huge instrument and one morning, when Dragonetti called at his room, he expressed the desire to hear a sonata. The contrabass was sent for, and the Sonata, n°2, of Op.5, was selected. Beethoven played his part, with his eyes immovably fixed upon his companion, and, in the finale, where the arpeggios occur, was so delighted and excited that at the close he sprang up and threw his arms around both player and instrument&quot;. The unlucky contrabassists of orchestras had frequent occasions during the next few years to know that this new revelation of the powers and possibilities of their instrument to Beethoven was not forgotten.&quot;&quot; (Alexander Wheelock Thayer, 1867)

To this day, the mastering of the Beethoven double bass symphonic parts are considered a basic standard for all orchestral double bass players. Dragonetti came back to Vienna for an extensive stay in 1808-1809. On that second trip he became friends with composer Simon Sechter, who would become the court organist in 1824, and professor of composition at the Vienna Conservatorium in 1851. He wrote piano accompaniments to some of his concert pieces, and they maintained a lifelong correspondence. Dragonetti was again in Vienna in 1813 and got to meet once more Beethoven, who had just written &quot;Wellington&#x27;s Victory&quot;, to celebrate the victory of Wellington over the French armies of King Joseph Bonaparte at the Battle of Vitoria. The premiere of this work, as well as of Beethoven&#x27;s seventh symphony was performed on 8 December 1813 in the university&#x27;s Festsaal, with Dragonetti leading the double basses.

==Style==
Dragonetti was known for his formidable strength and stamina. It was particularly important at a time when the role of the double bass in the orchestra was to assist the concertmaster in maintaining the cohesion and establishing the tempo. He had large hands with strong, broad fingers, which allowed him to play with a taller bridge and strings twice as far from the fingerboard as the other bassists.

&quot;The physical quality is his huge hand: endowed, first of all, with prodigious strength so that its grip on the strings of the instrument is the equivalent of the grip of a blacksmith&#x27;s vice... A hand endowed with five fingers so long, big and agile, that all five, including the bent thumb, go up and down the fingerboard each playing a note.&quot; (Caffi, 1855)

This was not at all standard in these times, as most players used to play—in one position—one note with the index finger, and one with the other three fingers in combination.

==Instruments==
Dragonetti was a lover of the fine arts, and a collector of musical instruments as well as many art-related articles, such as original scores and paintings. When he died, the following instruments were dispatched: a giant double bass attributed to Gasparo da Salò and stated to have been used in contemporary performances of Handel&#x27;s music, which is now conserved in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London; a very fine Domenico Montagnana Basso di Camera (from Venice); a Gasparo da Salò double bass dated 1590; an Amati double bass; a Maggini double bass; a Stradivarius violin (once played by Paganini), now known as the &quot;Dragonetti&quot;; a Guarnerius &quot;del Gesù&quot; violin dated 1742, now known as the &quot;Dragonetti-Walton&quot;; a Gasparo da Salò violin; two Amati violins; one Lafont violin; a Stradivarius violin copy; 26 unnamed violins; a Gasparo da Salò viola; an Amati viola; a Hill viola; 5 unnamed violas; 6 cellos; a large cello; 3 guitars; 2 bassoons; 3 French horns.

Mention is made of this on The Contrabass Shoppe web site which says...

&quot;There are various stories of how Dragonetti came into possession of the famous Gasparo da Salo bass. The fascinating and highly commendable biography &quot;Domenico Dragonetti In England&quot; by Fiona M. Palmer (Clarendon Press Oxford 1997) seems to offer the most plausible account. Because of Dragonetti&#x27;s unprecedented virtuosity as a soloist, attractive offers of work were made from both London and Moscow. As remuneration for renouncing the offers and remaining as principal bassist with the orchestra of the Ducal Chapel of St Mark&#x27;s in Venice (an orchestra of considerable importance), a decree made in 1791 gave Dragonetti a financial gratuity.

Similarly, it is reputed that Dragonetti was presented with an instrument made by Gasparo da Salo (1542–1609) by the Benedictine nuns who occupied St Peter&#x27;s monastery in Vicenza where Dragonetti lived and played in the Grand Opera. In the Palmer biography, a footnote refers to a 1906 account by C.P.A. Berenzi, who suggests that the instrument may have been made for the monks of St Peter&#x27;s, Vicenza, by Gasparo da Salo, and acquired by the procurators of St Mark&#x27;s to entice Dragonetti to remain in their employ.&quot;

==Compositions==
When he left for London in 1795, Dragonetti left many papers and manuscripts, including a &quot; Complete system of the double bass, or instruction book for that instrument&quot;, containing many elaborate exercises and studies, in the care of a friend. Unfortunately, they were sold and could not be retrieved by their author when he returned to Venice after some years. Today, many of his letters, personal papers, compositions, solos and manuscripts are to be found in the British Library. Some were directly bequeathed by Dragonetti, some were offered by Vincent Novello, and some were bought at auctions. Some of the compositions by Dragonetti include

* Adagio and Rondo in A major, for double bass and orchestra;
* Andante and Rondo, for double bass and strings;
* Concerto no. 5 in A major, for double bass and orchestra;
* Grande Alegro for Double bass and strings. There also exists an arrangement of Grande Allegro for double bass and piano by Simon Sechter (1788–1867) in British Museum, London (Add,17726)
* Menuet and Alegro for double bass and piano;
* Opera for double bass and piano;
* Sonata for double bass and piano;
* Allegretto for double bass and piano;
* Famous solo in E minor for double bass and piano;
* Adagio and Rondo in C major for double bass and piano;
* Concerto in G major (Andante, Alegretto) for double bass and orchestra
* Serenata, for piano and string bass
* Solo in D major, for double bass and piano
* Pezzo Di Concerto
* Twelve Waltzes for solo double bass
Also
* Concerto in A major for string bass and orchestra. &quot;Ever since the publication by Leduc (1925) of [the concerto in A major] there has been a question concerning its true authorship. It is now generally believed that it is the work of Edouard Nanny who created it as a tribute to Dragonetti.&quot;

<doc id="392101" wikidata="Q159397" url="?curid=392101" title="Louis Botha">
<text>Louis Botha ( , ; 27 September 1862 – 27 August 1919) was a South African politician who was the first prime minister of the Union of South Africa, the forerunner of the modern South African state. A Boer war veteran during the Second Boer War, Botha eventually fought to have South Africa become a British Dominion.

== Early life ==
Louis Botha was born in Greytown, Natal one of seven sons and eight daughters born to Louis Botha Senior (Somerset East, Eastern Cape, 26 March 1827 – Harrismith, Orange Free State, 5 July 1883) and Salomina Adriana van Rooyen (Somerset East, 31 March 1829 – Harrismith, 9 January 1886). Louis Botha briefly attended the school at Hermannsburg before his family relocated to the Orange Free State. The name Louis runs throughout the family, with every generation since General Louis Botha having the eldest son named Louis. Botha had three brothers who also served as generals in the Second Boer War: an older brother Philip Rudolf (1851–1901), and two younger brothers, Chris (1864–1902), a police officer, and Theunis Jacobus Botha (1867–1930).

== Zulu conflict ==
Louis Botha led &quot;Dinuzulu&#x27;s Volunteers&quot;, a group of Boers that had supported Dinuzulu against Zibhebhu in 1884.

== Politician ==
Botha later became a member of the parliament of Transvaal in 1897, representing the district of Vryheid.

== Second Boer War ==
=== Early battles ===
In 1899, Louis Botha fought in the Second Boer War, initially joining the Krugersdorp Commando, continuing to fight under Lucas Meyer in Northern Natal, and later as a general commanding and leading Boer forces impressively at Colenso and Spion Kop. On the death of P. J. Joubert, he was made commander-in-chief of the Transvaal Boers, where he demonstrated his abilities again at Belfast-Dalmanutha. After one of the battles at the Tugela River, Botha granted a twenty-four-hour armistice to General Buller to enable him to bury his dead.

=== Capture of Winston Churchill ===
Winston Churchill revealed that General Botha was the man who captured him at the Battle of Chieveley. also claims that Botha captured Churchill at train ambush 15 November 1899. Churchill was not aware of the man&#x27;s identity until 1902, when Botha travelled to London seeking loans to assist his country&#x27;s reconstruction, and the two met at a private luncheon. The incident is also mentioned in Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s book, &quot;The Great Boer War&quot;, published in 1902. However more recent sources claim that Field cornet Sarel Oosthuizen was in fact the Boer soldier who, at gunpoint, captured Churchill. Another version claims that the unit to capture Churchill was the Italian Volunteer Legion and its commander, Camillo Ricchiardi.

=== Later campaigns ===
After the fall of Pretoria in June 1900, Louis Botha led a concentrated guerrilla campaign against the British together with Koos de la Rey and Christiaan de Wet. The success of his measures was seen in the steady resistance offered by the Boers to the very close of the three-year war.

== Role after the Boer War ==

Botha was prominent in efforts to achieve a peace with the British, representing the Boers at the peace negotiations in 1902, and was signatory to the Treaty of Vereeniging. In the period of reconstruction under British rule, Botha went to Europe with de Wet and de la Rey to raise funds to enable the Boers to resume their former avocations. Botha, who was still looked upon as the leader of the Boer people, took a prominent part in politics, advocating always measures which he considered as tending to the maintenance of peace and good order and the re-establishment of prosperity in the Transvaal. His war record made him prominent in the politics of Transvaal and he was a major player in the postwar reconstruction of that country, founding with Jan Smuts the Het Volk Party in the Transvaal Colony in 1904, which served as a springboard to campaign for responsible self-government for the colony.

After the grant of self-government to the Transvaal on 6 December 1906 and the success of his Het Volk Party at the first elections in February 1907, Botha was called upon by Lord Selborne to form a government as Prime Minister on 4 March 1907, and in the spring of the same year he took part in the conference of colonial premiers held in London. During his visit to England on this occasion General Botha declared the wholehearted adhesion of the Transvaal to the British Empire, and his intention to work for the welfare of the country regardless of racial differences. The following year Botha participated in the National Convention (South Africa) which opened up the way for the passage of the South Africa Act of 1909 by the British parliament which in turn allowed for the formation of the Union of South Africa.

When South Africa obtained dominion status in 1910, Botha became the first Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa. In 1911, together with another Boer war hero, Jan Smuts, he formed the South African Party, or SAP. Widely viewed as too conciliatory with Britain, Botha faced revolts from within his own party and opposition from James Barry Munnik Hertzog&#x27;s National Party. He was a South African Freemason. Botha, like Hertzog, advocated for the preservation of black traditions, which ultimately lead to the segregation of the black and white races.

== Later career ==
After the First World War started, he sent troops to take German South-West Africa, a move unpopular among Boers, which provoked the Boer Revolt.

== Praise for the British ==

At Versailles on 1 June 1919, 17 years after the signing of the Treaty of Vereeniging, General Botha, now a member of the British Empire Delegation, put his hand on Lord Milner&#x27;s shoulder, and said &quot;Seventeen years ago, my friend and I made peace at Vereeniging – it was a bitter peace for us, bitter hard. We lost all for which we had fought – our independence, our flag, our country. But we turned our thoughts and efforts then to saving our people; and they, the victors, helped us. It was a hard peace for us to accept, but as I know it now, when time has shown us the truth, it was not unjust – it was a generous peace that the British people made with us, and that is why we stand with them today side by side in the cause which has brought us all together.&quot;

At the end of the War he briefly led a British Military Mission to Poland during the Polish–Soviet War. He argued that the terms of the Versailles Treaty were too harsh on the Central Powers, but signed the treaty. Botha was unwell for most of 1919. He was plagued by fatigue and ill health that arose from his robust waistline.&#x27;

== Marriage and children ==
Botha married Annie Emmett at the Dutch Reformed Church in  Vryheid  on 13 December 1886. Annie Botha later converted from Anglicanism to Dutch Reformed Protestantism. Shortly after their wedding, they settled on the Waterval Farm in Vryheid. They had five children together, three sons and two daughters.

== Death ==

General Louis Botha died of heart failure at his home following an attack of Spanish influenza on 27 August 1919 in the early hours of the morning. He was 56. His wife Annie was at home and was joined by Engelenburg who had acted as a private secretary to Botha. Botha was laid to rest in the Heroes&#x27; Acre of the Church Street Cemetery in Pretoria.

Of Botha, Winston Churchill wrote in &quot;Great Contemporaries&quot; &quot;The three most famous generals I have known in my life won no great battles over a foreign foe. Yet their names, which all begin with a &#x27;B&#x27;, are household words. They are General Booth, General Botha and General Baden-Powell...&quot;

After Botha&#x27;s death in 1919, Annie Botha settled on a farm in Rusthof and spent winters in Sezela, where she died in 1937.

== Honours ==
Sculptor Raffaello Romanelli won the competition to create the equestrian statue of Botha that stands in front of the South African Parliament building but died before completing it. His son Romano Romanelli, and his grandson&#x27;s family Arend Botha was contracted to finish his father&#x27;s work.

Sculptor Anton van Wouw created a statue of Botha in Durban unveiled in 1921.

Sculptor Coert Steynberg was commissioned to create the equestrian statue of Botha in front of the Union Buildings in Pretoria. It was unveiled in 1946.

The General Botha Regiment of the South African Army is named after Botha.

<text>Jecheon (; ) is a city in North Chungcheong Province, South Korea. The city is a major railway junction or a transportation mecca, served by the Jungang, Chungbuk and Taebaek Lines. Jecheon has scenic surroundings and several tourist spots like the Uirimji Reservoir, Cheongpung Lake and Cheongpung Cultural Properties complex. It is also the home of Semyung University.

The city&#x27;s name derives from the Korean words &quot;je&quot; (, which means &quot;dam&quot;) and &quot;cheon&quot; (, which means &quot;river&quot;).

==Location==
Jecheon is located in the northern part of North Chungcheong Province bordering Mungyeong to the south, while Wonju and Yeongwol-gun, which are located in Gangwon Province, are to the north. It is well known for its mountains and lake environments. Jecheon is well known as the &quot;healing city&quot;. A wide variety of traditional medical and herbal products and therapies are available, attracting people all over Korea to visit the city.

As Korea&#x27;s overall inland mountainous area, the natural environment is well preserved, and the air is so clear and pleasant that most mountain villages do not lose. Since there are not many ruins or tourist facilities in the city, Uirimji, built during the Samhan period, is used as a representative tourist destination.

Herbs are famous as local specialties. In particular, Hwanggi is said to distribute 80% of the nation&#x27;s distribution through local herbal markets.

==Climate==
Jecheon has a monsoon-influenced humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dwa&quot;) with cold, dry winters and hot, rainy summers.

It is so cold that it often snows in April, commonly called Jeberia. There are even times when it hits minus 20 degrees Celsius in winter. Along with Bonghwa-gun, Gyeongsangbuk-do, it is the coldest winter region in the region south of Gangwon State and Gyeonggi-do. When a cold wave warning is issued in a nearby area, it is common to issue a cold wave warning, and padding is a must-have for winter rather than a coat. This is because it is an inland region and a double basin of 300m above sea level consisting of high mountains easily exceeding 1,000m above sea level, such as Chiaksan, Sobaeksan, and Wolaksan. As a result, it is an area where the annual temperature difference is quite large, similar to Cheorwon-gun when it is really cold. According to the official observation, the lowest temperature ever recorded was -27.4 °C on January 4, 1981. Since the 2010s, -25.9 °C recorded on January 6, 2010 and February 3, 2012 was the lowest.

<doc id="392106" wikidata="Q3292289" url="?curid=392106" title="Direct manipulation interface">
<text>In computer science, human–computer interaction, and interaction design, direct manipulation is an approach to interfaces which involves continuous representation of objects of interest together with rapid, reversible, and incremental actions and feedback. As opposed to other interaction styles, for example, the command language, the intention of direct manipulation is to allow a user to manipulate objects presented to them, using actions that correspond at least loosely to manipulation of physical objects. An example of direct manipulation is resizing a graphical shape, such as a rectangle, by dragging its corners or edges with a mouse.

Having real-world metaphors for objects and actions can make it easier for a user to learn and use an interface (some might say that the interface is more natural or intuitive), and rapid, incremental feedback allows a user to make fewer errors and complete tasks in less time, because they can see the results of an action before completing the action, thus evaluating the output and compensating for mistakes.

The term was introduced by Ben Shneiderman in 1982 within the context of office applications and the desktop metaphor. Individuals in academia and computer scientists doing research on future user interfaces often put as much or even more stress on tactile control and feedback, or sonic control and feedback than on the visual feedback given by most GUIs. As a result, the term has been more widespread in these environments.

==In the contrast to WIMP/GUI interfaces==
Direct manipulation is closely associated with interfaces that use windows, icons, menus, and a pointing device (WIMP GUI) as these almost always incorporate direct manipulation to at least some degree. However, direct manipulation should not be confused with these other terms, as it does not imply the use of windows or even graphical output. For example, direct manipulation concepts can be applied to interfaces for blind or vision-impaired users, using a combination of tactile and sonic devices and software.

Compromises to the degree to which an interface implements direct manipulation are frequently seen. For some examples, most versions of windowing interfaces allow users to reposition a window by dragging it with the mouse. In early systems, redrawing the window while dragging was not feasible due to computational limitations. Instead, a rectangular outline of the window was drawn while dragging. The complete window contents were redrawn once the user released the mouse button.

==In computer graphics==
Because of the difficulty of visualizing and manipulating various aspects of computer graphics, including geometry creation and editing, animation, the layout of objects and cameras, light placement, and other effects, direct manipulation is a significant part of 3D computer graphics. There is standard direct manipulation widgets as well as many unique widgets that are developed either as a better solution to an old problem or as a solution for a new and/or unique problem. The widgets attempt to allow the user to modify an object in any possible direction while also providing easy guides or constraints to allow the user to easily modify an object in the most common directions, while also attempting to be as intuitive as to the function of the widget as possible. The three most ubiquitous transformation widgets are mostly standardized and are:
* the translation widget, which usually consists of three arrows aligned with the orthogonal axes centered on the object to be translated. Dragging the center of the widget translates the object directly underneath the mouse pointer in the plane parallel to the camera plane, while dragging any of the three arrows translates the object along the appropriate axis. The axes may be aligned with the world-space axes, the object-space axes, or some other space.
* the rotation widget, which usually consists of three circles aligned with the three orthogonal axes, and one circle aligned with the camera plane. Dragging any of the circles rotates the object around the appropriate axis while dragging elsewhere will freely rotate the object (virtual trackball rotation).
* the scale widget, which usually consists of three short lines aligned with the orthogonal axes terminating in boxes, and one box in the center of the widget. Dragging any of the three axis-aligned boxes effects a non-uniform scale along solely that axis, while dragging the center box effects a uniform scale on all three axes at once.
Depending on the specific standard uses of an object, different kinds of widgets may be used. For example, a light in computer graphics is, like any other object, also defined by a transformation (translation and rotation), but it is sometimes positioned and directed simply with its endpoint positions. This is because it may be more intuitive to define the location of the light source and then define the light&#x27;s target, rather than rotating it around the coordinate axes to point it at a known position.

Other widgets may be unique for a particular tool, such as edge controls to change the cone of a spotlight, points and handles to define the position and tangent vector for a spline control point, circles of variable size to define a blur filter width or paintbrush size, IK targets for hands and feet, or color wheels and swatches for quickly choosing colors. Complex widgets may even incorporate some from scientific visualization to efficiently present relevant data (such as vector fields for particle effects or false color images to display vertex maps).

Direct manipulation, as well as user interface design in general, for 3D computer graphics tasks, is still an active area of invention and innovation. The process of generating CG images is not considered to be intuitive or easy in comparison to the difficulty of what the user wants to do, especially for complex and less common tasks. The user interface for word processing, for example, is commonly used. It is easy to learn for new users and is sufficient for most word processing purposes, so it is a mostly solved and standardized UI. However, the user interfaces for 3D computer graphics are usually either challenging to learn and use and not sufficiently powerful for complex tasks and/or difficult to learn and use, so direct manipulation and user interfaces will vary wildly from application to application.

<text>Giovanni Bottesini (22 December 1821 – 7 July 1889) was an Italian Romantic composer, conductor, and a double bass virtuoso.

==Biography==

Born in Crema, Lombardy, he was taught the rudiments of music by his father, an accomplished clarinetist and composer, at a young age and had played timpani in Crema with the Teatro Sociale before the age of eleven. He studied violin with Carlo Cogliati, and probably would have continued on this instrument except for a unique turn of events. His father sought a place for him in the Milan Conservatory in 1835, but due to the Bottesini family&#x27;s lack of money, Bottesini needed a scholarship. Only two positions were available: double bass and bassoon. He prepared a successful audition for the double bass scholarship in a matter of weeks. Only four years later, a surprisingly short time by the standards of the day, he left with a prize of 300 francs for solo playing. This money financed the acquisition of an instrument of Carlo Giuseppe Testore, and a globe-trotting career as &quot;the Paganini of the Double Bass&quot; was launched.

On leaving Milan, he spent some time in America and also occupied the position of principal double-bass in the Italian opera at Havana, where he later became director. Here his first opera, &quot;Cristoforo Colombo&quot;, was produced in 1847. In 1849 he made his first appearance in England, playing double bass solos at one of the Musical Union concerts. After this he made frequent visits to England, and his extraordinary command of his unwieldy instrument gained him great popularity in London and the provinces.

Apart from his triumphs as a performer, Bottesini was a conductor of European reputation, and was conductor at the Théâtre des Italiens in Paris from 1855 to 1857 where his second opera, &quot;L&#x27;Assedio di Firenze&quot;, was produced in 1856. In 1861 and 1862 he conducted in Palermo, supervising the production of his opera &quot;Marion Delorme&quot; in 1862, and in 1863 in Barcelona. During these years he diversified the toils of conducting by repeated concert tours through Europe. In 1871 he conducted a season of Italian opera at the Lyceum theatre in London, during which his opera &quot;Ali Babà&quot; was produced, and he was chosen by Verdi to conduct the first performance of &quot;Aida&quot;, which took place at Cairo on 24 December 1871.

During this period it was common to programme concerts between the acts of operas. Bottesini would frequently perform solos and duos in these concerts and they were very popular. His fantasies on &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot;, &quot;I puritani&quot;, &quot;Beatrice di Tenda&quot; and especially &quot;La sonnambula&quot; are virtuosic tours de force that are still popular with those who are highly accomplished on the instrument.
Bottesini wrote three operas besides those previously mentioned: &quot;Il Diavolo della Notte&quot; (Milan, 1859); &quot;Vinciguerra&quot; (Paris, 1870); and &quot;Ero e Leandro&quot; (Turin, 1880), the last named to a libretto by Arrigo Boito, which was subsequently set by Luigi Mancinelli. He also wrote &quot;The Garden of Olivet&quot;, a devotional oratorio (libretto by Joseph Bennett), which was produced at the Norwich festival in 1887, eleven string quartets, a quintet for string quartet and double bass, and many works for the double bass, including two concertos for solo double bass, the Gran Duo Concertante (originally) for two double basses, Passione Amorosa for two double basses, numerous pieces for double bass and piano, and an instructional book (&quot;Complete Method for Double Bass&quot;).

Shortly before his death, in 1888 he was appointed director of Parma Conservatory on Verdi&#x27;s recommendation. Bottesini died in Parma on 7 July 1889. His solo works remain standard repertoire for accomplished double bassists to this day. Bottesini was a freemason, initiated 20 June 1849, in the Bank of England Lodge No. 263, London.

==Personal life==
Bottesini married twice. Firstly, on 23 August 1849 he married the Italian dancer Teresa Revelani at the Sardinian Chapel in London. Secondly, on 14 October 1878, after a 26 year long relationship, he married the Anglo-Spanish opera singer Claudina Fiorentini whose real name was Florentine Williams. Together they had one adopted daughter, Provvidenza.

==The Paganini of the double bass==

Bottesini was widely acclaimed, and his virtuosic skill in the bass paralleled that of Paganini himself on the violin. Because of the contributions of Bottesini (along with those of Sperger and Dragonetti) to bass technique, many have come to view the double bass as a diverse and versatile instrument. Most notably there are many virtuoso bass players who draw inspiration from the early renaissance of the double bass.

Bottesini&#x27;s bass was said to be a unique instrument with a remarkable sound. It was built by Carlo Antonio Testore in 1716. The instrument was owned by several unknown bass players. It nearly met its end in the 1830s as it sat backstage in a marionette theater in Milan. Bottesini purchased the Testore in 1838 for 900 lire. The Testore bass was later converted back to a four-stringed instrument, and then to a three. Eventually, it was changed back to a four-string configuration and is now in the possession of a private collector in Japan. Bottesini was also one of the first performers to adopt the French-style bow grip for the double bass. This style was previously used solely by violinists, violists and cellists.

<text>The Zambezi Region is one of Namibia&#x27;s fourteen regions, situated in the north-eastern part of the country along the Zambezi River. The region&#x27;s capital is Katima Mulilo. The Katima Mulilo Airport is 18 kilometres south-west of the town, while the village of Bukalo is located 43 kilometres south-east of Katima Mulilo. Known as the Caprivi Region until 2013, it has eight electoral constituencies and a population of 142,373 according to the 2023 census.

==Politics==
===Constituencies===
The region comprises eight electoral constituencies:

* Judea Lyaboloma (created 2013)
* Kabbe North (created 2013)
* Kabbe South (created 2013)
* Katima Mulilo Rural
* Katima Mulilo Urban
* Kongola
* Linyanti
* Sibbinda
===Regional elections===
Electorally, Zambezi is consistently dominated by the South West Africa People&#x27;s Organization (SWAPO). In the 2004 regional election for the National Assembly of Namibia, SWAPO won all constituencies, and mostly by a landslide.

In the 2015 regional elections SWAPO won in all eight constituencies and obtained 77.5% of all votes (2010: 80%). In the 2020 regional election SWAPO still had the vast majority of votes (45.4%) but lost four of the eight constituencies, three to independent candidates and one to the Independent Patriots for Change (IPC), an opposition party formed in August 2020.

==Geography==
The Zambezi Region can be classified as a tropical area, with high temperatures and high rainfall during the December-to-March rainy season, making it the wettest region in Namibia. The terrain mostly consists of swamps, floodplains, wetlands and woodland.

In addition to the Zambezi River, the region also holds the Kwando River, which marks the border with Botswana. Tributaries include the Linyanti and the Chobe. The Kwando meets the Zambezi in the far east of the region.

===Populated places===
Besides the capital Katima Mulilo, which has town status, and the self-governed village Bukalo, there are numerous settlements in the region, including:

* Chinchimane
* Ibbu
* Kongola
* Lisikili
* Luhonono
* Nakabolelwa
* Ngoma
* Sangwali
* Sibbinda
===Borders===
The Zambezi Region is almost entirely bordered by foreign countries. Its only domestic border is a with the Kavango East Region in the west.
*In the northwest, it borders the Cuando Cubango Province of Angola.
*In the north, it borders the Western Province of Zambia.
*In the south, it borders the North-West District of Botswana.

The Namibia-Zambia-Botswana tripoint lies less than 100 metres from the Zimbabwe border – causing Namibia sometimes erroneously thought to border Zimbabwe.

===Flora and fauna===
The Zambezi Region is home to 450 animal species, including elephants, making the Zambezi Region a popular spot for game-watching. Wildlife is safeguarded by several national parks: Bwabwata National Park, Nkasa Rupara National Park (formerly Mamili National Park), and Mudumu National Park. Animals move freely across the unmarked border into Botswana, where Chobe National Park is situated. The region is also renowned for bird-watching, hosting almost 70 percent of Namibia&#x27;s recorded bird species.

===Population===
The Zambezi Region&#x27;s population of 142,373 constitutes approximately 4.71% of Namibia&#x27;s total population. The region is predominantly inhabited by subsistence farmers who rely on the Zambezi, Kwando, Linyanti, and Chobe Rivers for their livelihoods. 

The Lozi people are a Bantu-speaking ethnic group native to southern Africa. They consist of several tribes, including the Bafwe, Bambukushu, Basubia, Batotela, and Bayeyi, each with its own dialect and traditional authority. These tribes share the same Lozi culture and traditions. Silozi serves as the standard language that unifies them and is widely used in educational materials, media such as television and radio, and government communications. Additionally, Silozi plays a crucial role in preserving and promoting cultural heritage, serving as a common medium for cultural practices and ceremonies.

Additionally, there is a population of San, specifically the Khwe people, residing in Bwabwata in the western part of the region.

==Economy and infrastructure==
According to the 2012 Namibia Labour Force Survey, unemployment in the Zambezi Region is 28.0%. Zambezi has 102 schools with a total of 39,808 pupils.

===Tourism===
Bwabwata National Park is and extends for about from the Kavango River in the west to the Kwando River in the east. Deciduous woodlands are dominated by trees such as wild seringa, copalwood and Zambezi teak. While the park is sanctuary to 35 large and numerous small game species, visitors are not likely to see many of these animals, as vehicles are restricted to the road between Kavango and Eastern Zambezi. Animals likely to be seen are elephant, roan and kudu. Buffalo occur towards the west. As many as 339 bird species have been recorded in the west of the Zambezi Region.

The wild and little visited Nkasa Rupara National Park (formerly Mamili National Park) is Namibia&#x27;s equivalent of the Okavango Delta, a watery wonderland of wildlife rich islands, river channels and wetlands. The focal points of the national park are Nkasa and Lupala, two large islands in the Kwando/Linyati river. During the dry season the islands can be reached by road but after the rains 80% of the area becomes flooded, cutting them off from the mainland.

Mudumu National Park is a vast expanse of dense savannah and mopane woodland with the Kwando River at its western border. The park is home to small populations of sitatunga and red lechwe while spotted neck otter, hippo and crocodile inhabit the waterways. Animals to be encountered are elephant, buffalo, roan, sable, kudu, impala, oribi, zebra, wild dog as well as some 430 species of birds.

The Namibian Wetland Route, established in 2005, is a local tourism association of businesses along a route from Divundu to Impalila.

==History==

Until the end of the 19th century, the area was known as &quot;Itenge&quot;, and it was under the rule of the Lozi kings. In the late 19th century the strip of land was administered as part of the British protectorate of Bechuanaland (Botswana). The German Empire in 1890 laid claim to the British-administered island of Zanzibar; Britain objected and the dispute was settled at the Berlin Conference later that year. On 1 July 1890, the British acquired Zanzibar and Germany acquired the territory which became known as the Caprivi Strip. Caprivi was named after German Chancellor Leo von Caprivi, who negotiated the land in an 1890 exchange with the United Kingdom. Leo von Caprivi arranged for the Caprivi strip to be annexed to German South West Africa in order to give Germany access to the Zambezi River as part of the Heligoland-Zanzibar Treaty. The German motivation behind the swap was to acquire a strip of land linking German South West Africa with the Zambezi River, providing easy access to Tanganyika (Tanzania) and an outlet to the Indian Ocean. Unfortunately for the Germans, the British colonisation of Rhodesia (Zimbabwe and Zambia) stopped them well upstream of Victoria Falls, which proved a considerable barrier to navigation on the Zambezi.

During World War I, the Caprivi Strip again came under British rule and was governed as part of Bechuanaland but it received little attention and became known as a lawless frontier. The region became of geopolitical importance during the 1980s when it was used as a jumping off point and re-supply route for South African support for the UNITA movement in Angola.

Caprivi Region became one of Namibia&#x27;s thirteen regions when the country gained independence in 1990.

===Renaming===
In August 2013, following a recommendation of the fourth Delimitation Commission for the Electoral Commission of Namibia, the Caprivi Region was renamed the Zambezi Region in a step to eliminate names of colonial administrators from Namibia&#x27;s maps. Alternative proposals for the region&#x27;s name had included Iyambezi, Linyandi, Itenge, and others. The name of the Zambezi town of Schuckmannsburg was also changed to Luhonono as part of the same process.

The renaming was not without controversy, however. The group Concerned Caprivians (or Caprivi Concerned Group) released a press statement expressing concern over the name change as well as Delimitation Commission boundary and constituency demarcation changes. Caprivi African National Union (CANU) party secretary general Robert Sililo argued that the renaming was motivated by a desire to dilute Caprivian identity and history. A statement from Concerned Caprivians read, &quot;the name change from Caprivi to Zambezi is destined to destroy our identity and history as a symbol of renaissance, the dilution of political foundations in the identity of CANU party&quot;.

<text>Sir Guy of Gisbourne (also spelled [[Gisburn|Gisburne]], Gisborne, Gysborne, or Gisborn) is a character from the Robin Hood legends of English folklore. He first appears in &quot;Robin Hood and Guy of Gisborne&quot; (Child Ballad 118), where he is an assassin who attempts to kill Robin Hood but is killed by him. In later depictions, he has become a romantic rival to Robin Hood for Maid Marian&#x27;s love.

==Textual background==
The Child ballad &quot;Robin Hood and Guy of Gisborne&quot; dates from 1650 but its origins are much older than that, judging from the similarities with the 1475 play, a fragment of which is preserved in the library of Trinity College, Cambridge.

==Summary of the Child ballad==
Robin Hood and Little John walk through the forest. Robin speaks of a bad dream he had, of two men attacking him. While talking, they spot a distant stranger leaning on a tree. Little John tells Robin to wait while he approaches the stranger, but Robin objects as if accused of cowardice, telling John he would like to break his head. John marches off in a huff, and is promptly captured by the Sheriff of Nottingham and tied to a tree, to be hanged. Meanwhile, Robin goes up to the stranger, Guy of Gisborne, who is clad in a horsehide robe.

Guy&#x27;s outfit is described thus:

:&quot;A sword and a dagger he wore by his side,&quot;
: &quot;Of manye a man the bane;&quot;
:&quot;And he was clad in his capull-hyde&quot; [horse-hide]
: &quot;Topp and tayll and mayne&quot;
:&quot;‘I dwell by dale and downe,’ quoth hee,&quot;
: &quot;‘And Robin to take I’me sworne;&quot;
:&quot;And when I am callèd by my right name&quot;
: &quot;I am Guy of good Gisborne.’&quot;

Guy is a hired killer seeking Robin Hood. They have a shooting contest, and Robin wins with ease. Robin identifies himself (as &quot;Robin Hood of Barnsdale&quot;, in South Yorkshire) to the suspicious Guy, and the two fight. When Robin trips, Guy stabs him, but (after a brief prayer to Mary) Robin kills him with his sword. He dons the distinctive horsehide, cuts off Guy&#x27;s head, sticks it on the tip of his bow and slashes the face, rendering it unrecognisable. He then blows Guy&#x27;s horn to signal victory to the Sheriff. Disguised as Guy, and carrying what he passes off as Robin Hood&#x27;s head, Robin goes to rescue Little John. He convinces the sheriff to be allowed to kill Little John, but instead cuts him loose with an &quot;Irish knife&quot;. John then takes a bow and shoots the Sheriff through the heart.

==In popular culture==
Although he has made many appearances in 19th- and 20th-century variants of the Robin Hood legends, Guy&#x27;s only constant is villainy, but a frequently occurring theme is the &quot;love triangle story&quot; involving Robin, Marian, and Guy, a theme adopted from 19th-century theatrical adaptations.

===Literature===
In Howard Pyle&#x27;s influential novel &quot;The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; (published in 1883), he is shown as a crude, coarse outlaw, known for his cruelty and murderous habits. The chapter closely follows the plot of the ballad.

In Simon Hawke&#x27;s 1984 novel &quot;The Ivanhoe Gambit&quot;, Sir Guy is the Sheriff of Nottingham and married to Marian, who runs off to join the Merry Men after three failed attempts to murder him.

The 1956 novel &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; by Roger Lancelyn Green portrays Guy as the right-hand man of the Sheriff of Nottingham, and incorporates his desire to have Marian for himself. Robin Hood spares Guy&#x27;s life several times, but eventually has enough and kills him, at which point he disguises himself in Guy&#x27;s armor to free some of his captured men.

In Stephen R. Lawhead&#x27;s 2006 novel &quot;Hood&quot; (King Raven Trilogy), Sir Guy, a knight-soldier, is the chief henchman of Abbott Hugo de Rainault.

The 2013 book &quot;Will in Scarlet&quot; by Matthew Cody portrays Sir Guy as a brutal, ambitious knight who helps Prince John solidify his power in exchange for being granted land and influence. He murders Will&#x27;s uncle early in the novel, but eventually is disowned by both John and the Sheriff of Nottingham for ravaging the local peasantry in his hunt for the outlaws. 

In J Tullos Hennig&#x27;s 2014 &quot;The Wode&quot; series, Guy, born Gamelyn, was a childhood friend and eventual lover to Rob before becoming a Templar and returning as Guy de Gisbourne.

===Film===
In the 1912 version of &quot;Robin Hood&quot;, he is determined to marry Marian and captures Robin Hood; he ties him to a tree, but by the end of the movie the roles are reversed.

In the Douglas Fairbanks-dominated silent movie &quot;Robin Hood&quot; he is played by Paul Dickey and the 1938 Errol Flynn film &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; by Basil Rathbone. In both versions, Guy is a nobleman and Prince John&#x27;s chief supporter, and a far more prominent and dangerous man than the Sheriff of Nottingham. Prince John proposes Guy to Maid Marian as a prospective husband. Henceforth, Guy often appears as a bitter rival to Robin for Maid Marian&#x27;s affections. In the 1938 film, Robin engages Guy in a duel to the death, one of the most famous sword fights in cinema history, whilst in the 1922 film, Robin takes him on without a sword and kills him with his bare hands.

Guy is absent from the Disney animated film &quot;Robin Hood&quot; (1973). Instead he is replaced by Sir Hiss (voiced by Terry-Thomas).

The role of Guy of Gisbourne has also been interpreted on film by Tom Baker (&quot;The Zany Adventures of Robin Hood&quot;, 1984), and Michael Wincott (in the movie &quot;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves&quot;, 1991) where he is said to be the Sheriff&#x27;s cousin. In the 1991 film, Guy is murdered by the Sheriff halfway through the movie after failing repeatedly to capture Robin.

In the 2010 movie &quot;Robin Hood&quot; directed by Ridley Scott, actor Mark Strong mentions in promotional interviews that his character, Sir Godfrey, is based upon Guy of Gisbourne.

In the 2018 &quot;Robin Hood&quot;, Sir Gisborne (Paul Anderson) was Robin&#x27;s commanding officer in the Crusades, but Robin turned against him when he saw Sir Gisborne kill a young man even as the boy&#x27;s father pleaded for mercy. After Robin adopts his identity as &#x27;the Hood&#x27;, Gisborne is recalled to England by the Sheriff to hunt down the Hood, but despite the reputation of his men, they are no match for Robin&#x27;s training.

===Television===
Gisbourne (spelled &quot;Gisburne&quot;) was portrayed by Robert Addie in the British television series &quot;Robin of Sherwood&quot; (1984–1986). 

In the 1991 TV movie &quot;Robin Hood&quot;, Jürgen Prochnow plays &quot;Sir Miles Folcanet&quot;, a character with much in common with modern versions of Guy.

He was portrayed by Clive Revill in the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;Qpid&quot; in its fourth season. Q sends the crew of the USS Enterprise to a Robin Hood scenario of his creation where they must save the life of Captain Picard&#x27;s occasional paramour, Vash, who must either marry Sir Guy or be executed.

In the 1990s CBBC comedy show &quot;Maid Marian and her Merry Men&quot;, Guy—played by Ramsay Gilderdale—is the nephew of King John.

In the BBC&#x27;s 2006 &quot;Robin Hood&quot;, Guy of Gisborne is portrayed much more seriously by Richard Armitage, and is the Sheriff of Nottingham&#x27;s second-in-command. He is originally depicted as a dark character, and is shown as an active enforcer of the Sheriff&#x27;s cruelty, but at the same time, he is in love with Marian, showing conflicted attempts to redeem himself in her eyes.

<text>The Caprivi Strip, also known simply as Caprivi, is a geographic salient protruding from the northeastern corner of Namibia. It is bordered by Botswana to the south and Angola and Zambia to the north. Namibia, Botswana and Zambia meet at a single point at the eastern tip of the Strip, which also comes within of Zimbabwe, thus nearly forming a quadripoint. Botswana and Zambia share a border at the crossing of Kazungula.

The territory was acquired in 1890 by then-German South West Africa in order to provide access to the Zambezi River and consequently a route to the east coast of the continent and German East Africa. The route was later found not to be navigable because of the location of the Victoria Falls, one of the world&#x27;s largest waterfalls, about east of the Caprivi Strip, and because of more waterfalls downstream such as Kariba Gorge and Cahora Bassa.

Within Namibia, the Strip is divided administratively between the Kavango East and Zambezi regions. It is crossed by the Okavango River. The Cuando River forms part of its border with Botswana, and the Zambezi River forms a part of its border with Zambia. The width of the strip varies from about to . Its largest settlement is Katima Mulilo, located at the point where the Zambezi reaches the Strip.

==Toponym==
When Namibia was a German colony, the Caprivi Strip was known in German as &quot;Caprivizipfel&quot;. Before colonisation, it was known as &quot;Itenge&quot;. During a short-lived secession attempt around the year 2000, the name &quot;Itenge&quot; was used by the separatists. It is also sometimes called the &quot;Okavango Panhandle&quot;.

==Languages==
Inhabitants of the Caprivi Strip speak a number of African languages, mostly members of the Bantu language family, with speakers of Mbarakwena [Xu-Khoisan], Hukwe a San language, in the northwest of the strip near the border with Angola. The Bantu languages include Yeyi (or &#x27;Yei&#x27; or &#x27;Yeeyi&#x27;), Mbukushu, Gciriku (or &#x27;Dciriku&#x27;), Fwe, Totela, and Subiya. The Silozi language is a lingua Franca of the Caprivi Strip, especially in Katima Mulilo, where some residents speak Lozi, a language of western Zambia, as a &quot;lingua franca&quot;. Many also speak English, while 

==Natural features==

The area is rich in natural wildlife and has mineral resources. Of particular interest to the government of Namibia is that it gives access to the Zambezi River and is thereby a potential trading route to Africa&#x27;s East Coast. However, the vagaries of the river level, various rapids, the presence of the Victoria Falls downstream and continued political uncertainty in the region have made such use of the Caprivi Strip difficult. However, it may be used for ecotourism in the future.

Within Namibia the Caprivi Strip provides significant habitat for the critically endangered African wild dog (&quot;Lycaon pictus&quot;). It is a corridor for African elephant moving from Botswana and Namibia into Angola, Zambia and Zimbabwe. National parks found in the Caprivi Strip are Bwabwata National Park, Mudumu National Park and Nkasa Rupara National Park. Local communities have organised themselves into communal area conservancies and community forests. People work closely with the Namibian Government to jointly manage natural resources through several programmes set up between the Namibian Government and various donor parties.

==History==
Caprivi was named after German Chancellor Leo von Caprivi (in office 1890–1894), who negotiated the acquisition of the land in an 1890 exchange with the United Kingdom. Caprivi arranged for the Caprivi strip to be annexed to German South West Africa in order to give Germany access to the Zambezi River and a route to Africa&#x27;s east coast, where the colony of German East Africa (now part of Tanzania) was situated. The transfer of territory was a part of the Heligoland-Zanzibar Treaty of 1890, in which Germany gave up its interest in Zanzibar in return for the Caprivi Strip and the island of Heligoland in the North Sea. 

The river later proved unnavigable and inaccessible to the Indian Ocean due to the location of the Victoria Falls and more falls, a fact that was possibly already known to the British side during the negotiations. Caprivi itself was remote and inaccessible during the rainy season, and the Germans did not find use for it. After a mineral expedition in 1909 proved unsuccessful, Germany contemplated exchanging the strip for some other British territory, such as Walvis Bay. When that territory was transferred to the Cape Colony by the British in 1910, Germany was stuck with Caprivi for the rest of its colonial history.

In 1976, the South African administration established the self-governing Eastern Caprivi homeland with its own flag, national anthem, and coat of arms. It remained under direct &quot;de facto&quot; control of the South African government in Pretoria until 1980, when its administration was transferred to South West Africa&#x27;s administration in Windhoek.

In the late 20th century, the Caprivi Strip attracted attention when Namibia and Botswana took a long-standing dispute over its southern boundary to the International Court of Justice. The core of the territorial dispute concerned which channel of the Chobe River was the thalweg, the &quot;bona fide&quot; international boundary. This was important, as, depending on the decision, a large island (known as Kasikili or Sedudu, by Namibia and Botswana respectively) would fall into one or the other&#x27;s national territory. The Botswana government considered the island as an integral part of the Chobe National Park, whereas the Namibian government, and many inhabitants of the eastern Caprivi Strip, held that not only was the island part of the original German–British agreement, but generations of inhabitants had used it for seasonal grazing, for reed-gathering, and as a burial site. In December 1999, the International Court of Justice ruled that the main channel, and hence the international boundary, lay to the north of the island, thus making the island part of Botswana.

==Politics==
The Caprivi Strip is of politico-strategic military importance. During the Rhodesian Bush War (1964–1979), South West African People&#x27;s Organization&#x27;s and Caprivi African National Union&#x27;s (CANU) liberation war against the South African occupation (1965–1994) and the Angolan Civil War (1975–2002), the Strip saw continual military action and multiple incursions by various armed forces using the Strip as a corridor to access other territories.

===Caprivi conflict===

The Caprivi conflict involved an armed conflict in Namibia between the Caprivi Liberation Army (CLA), a rebel group aiming for the secession of the Caprivi Strip led by Mishake Muyongo, and the Namibian government. Its main eruption occurred on 2 August 1999 when the CLA launched an attack in Katima Mulilo, occupying the state-run radio station and attacking a police station, the Wenela border post, and an army base. Namibian armed forces quashed the attempt at secession within a few days.

<doc id="392114" wikidata="Q2561975" url="?curid=392114" title="The Apples in Stereo">
<text>The Apples in Stereo are an American indie rock band associated with Elephant 6 Collective. The band is largely the project of lead vocalist/guitarist/producer Robert Schneider, who writes the majority of the band&#x27;s music and lyrics. Currently, the Apples in Stereo also includes longstanding members John Hill (rhythm guitar) and Eric Allen (bass), as well as more recent members John Dufilho (drums), John Ferguson (keyboards), and Ben Phelan (keyboards/guitar/trumpet).

The band&#x27;s sound draws comparisons to the psychedelic rock of The Beatles and The Beach Boys during the 1960s, as well as to bands such as Electric Light Orchestra and Pavement, and also draws from lo-fi, garage rock, new wave, R&amp;B, bubblegum pop, power pop, punk, electro-pop and experimental music.

The band is also well known for their appearance in a &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot; music video performing the song &quot;Signal in the Sky (Let&#x27;s Go)&quot;. It aired immediately after the show&#x27;s seventh episode of season 4, &quot;Superfriends&quot;, which was based on the song&#x27;s lyrics. The band has appeared widely in television and film, including performances on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;, &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; and &quot;Last Call with Carson Daly&quot;, guest hosting on MTV, song placements in numerous television shows, commercials and motion pictures, the performance of the single &quot;Energy&quot; by the contestants on &quot;American Idol&quot;, and a song recorded for children&#x27;s show &quot;Yo Gabba Gabba&quot;.

== Band history ==
=== 1991–1993: The Apples ===
In late 1991, Robert Schneider met Jim McIntyre on a commuter bus in Denver, Colorado. Schneider had recently moved to Colorado from Ruston, Louisiana, and often initiated conversations with McIntyre. When Schneider asked McIntyre what his music interests were, McIntyre named his two favorite bands: The Beatles and The Beach Boys — two bands which Schneider was particularly fond of. Realizing that they shared many musical interests, McIntyre introduced Schneider to Hilarie Sidney. McIntyre already had a band called Von Hemmling in which McIntyre played bass and Sidney played drums. With Schneider, they discussed the idea of starting a band and perhaps a recording label. Schneider later met Chris Parfitt, who at the time was also already in a band (which Schneider unsuccessfully auditioned for on bass). Schneider and Parfitt also became friends, however, and toyed with the idea of having a rock band similar to The Velvet Underground or Black Sabbath, with production qualities similar to that of The Beatles and The Beach Boys.

Schneider then spent two weeks in Athens, Georgia recording music and spending time with his childhood friends Will Cullen Hart, Bill Doss and Jeff Mangum. He discussed the idea of starting a record label with them (which soon became The Elephant 6 Recording Company). It was also at this time that the name &quot;The Apples&quot; came about, inspired by the Pink Floyd song &quot;Apples and Oranges&quot;.

The earliest incarnation of the band began to form in 1992 upon Schneider&#x27;s return to Denver, first between Schneider and Parfitt, both of whom played guitar. The two recruited McIntyre and Sidney during the autumn of that year, practicing material through the winter. Their first few live shows took place the following January, many of which were with the band Felt Pilotes. From February to April 1993, the band recorded their debut 7-inch EP, &quot;Tidal Wave&quot;, and released it in June as the first record ever to bear the Elephant 6 logo.

=== 1994–1995: &quot;Hypnotic Suggestion&quot; and &quot;Fun Trick Noisemaker&quot; ===
Several conflicts would lead Parfitt to leave the band in early 1994. John Hill, a former bandmate of McIntyre&#x27;s, would join the band as a rhythm guitarist while Schneider began to grow more comfortable playing lead guitar. It was also at this time that Schneider began to take stronger creative control of the band, shifting its sound from its stronger rock qualities to a spacier pop sound. The band started work on a debut album, but it instead became &quot;Hypnotic Suggestion&quot;, a second EP. However, after SpinART Records offered to buy the band an 8-track in return for an album, new plans for an LP arose.

In mid-1994, after &quot;Hypnotic Suggestion&quot;, McIntyre would be the second to leave the band, due to a number of personal distresses as well as stylistic changes that arose with Parfitt&#x27;s departure. Having great difficulty finding a new permanent bassist, the band would rotate a number of frequent bass contributors, including Jeff Mangum of Neutral Milk Hotel, Kurt Heasley of The Lilys, Kyle Jones, Joel Richardson, and Joel Evans. Jim McIntyre would also occasionally guest on bass. This continued to be the makeup of the band as they toured the country in late 1994, recording the first half of their new album in Glendora, California. In early 1995, the band finished the album, &quot;Fun Trick Noisemaker&quot;, at Kyle Jones&#x27;s house (the birthplace of Schneider&#x27;s Pet Sounds Studio).

Now with an LP to support, the band began touring again. Eric Allen, whom the band had previously auditioned as a guitarist after the departure of Chris Parfitt, joined the band as a much welcomed permanent bassist. Late 1995, Schneider relocated Pet Sounds Studio to Jim McIntyre&#x27;s house. McIntyre continued to be involved in the recording and engineering of the band&#x27;s albums until the mid-2000s.

A significantly different band from the original 1992 four-piece, the official name of the band gradually became &quot;the Apples in Stereo&quot;, with the &quot;in stereo&quot; usually somewhat under-emphasized, whether in lower-case or in parentheses. Schneider described this in an interview: &quot;It&#x27;s very clearcut, actually: we&#x27;re The Apples, the music&#x27;s in stereo. It&#x27;s not actually the band name – it&#x27;s a step back from it, a band name once removed. We&#x27;re The Apples, in stereo. Kind of like a TV show, &#x27;in stereo!&#x27; That always seemed to be a really big deal, that it was in stereo.&quot; McIntyre later remarked, &quot;It&#x27;s cool the name changed cause the Apples and the Apples in Stereo were really two different entities.&quot;

===1996–2005: &quot;Tone Soul Evolution&quot; to &quot;Velocity of Sound&quot;===
The band continued touring through 1996, playing in Japan for the first time. Several early recording sessions were held at Pet Sounds for the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Tone Soul Evolution&quot;, but the members were dissatisfied with the quality of the recordings. The majority of the album&#x27;s songs were re-recorded at Studio .45 in Hartford, Connecticut before the album&#x27;s release. In 1998, Chris McDuffie joined the band, playing various instruments including organs, synthesizers and assorted percussion. He would leave the band before &quot;Velocity of Sound&quot; was released in 2002.

Several more albums were released by the band through the years, including the psychedelic &quot;concept EP&quot;, &quot;Her Wallpaper Reverie&quot;, &quot;The Discovery of a World Inside the Moone&quot; and &quot;Velocity of Sound&quot;; both of the latter of which were progressively aimed at capturing the live sound of the band, which continued to tighten as they continued to perform hundreds of live shows (about 100 a year). In particular, the 2002 album &quot;Velocity of Sound&quot; rejects most of the psych-pop production sensibilities that would come to be associated with the band, instead featuring stripped-down production and sparse, rock instrumentation.

The band members would also continue to pursue careers in side bands and solo projects, with Schneider producing several albums for Elephant 6 artists. Schneider and drummer Hilarie Sidney were married for a time, with a son Max born in 2000. They have since been divorced.

The band went on a brief hiatus during 2004 as Schneider released the debut album from a new band called Ulysses and Sidney released the debut album from her new band The High Water Marks; both were released on Eenie Meenie Records. In 2005, the Apples in Stereo contributed &quot;Liza Jane&quot; to the Eenie Meenie compilation, &quot;Dimension Mix&quot;. It was also around this time that news began to circulate among various websites concerning the band&#x27;s next studio album.

===2006–2008: &quot;New Magnetic Wonder&quot; and evolving lineup===
In August 2006, longtime drummer Hilarie Sidney officially announced her departure from the band during the band&#x27;s closing set at the Athens Popfest music festival in Athens, Georgia. Her replacement, John Dufilho, lead singer and principal songwriter of The Deathray Davies, was announced in October 2006. 2006 touring member Bill Doss of the Olivia Tremor Control also quietly joined the band &quot;officially&quot; as its new keyboardist. John Ferguson of Big Fresh and Ulysses joined the Apples in 2007, also playing keyboards, and wearing a &quot;Doctor Who&quot;-esque space suit on stage.

In December 2006, Robert Schneider appeared on the popular television show &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; singing the song &quot;Stephen Stephen&quot; recorded by the Apples in Stereo to glorify the show&#x27;s host Stephen Colbert, to kick off a guitar solo contest between Colbert and Chris Funk of The Decemberists.

On February 6, 2007, the Apples in Stereo released their sixth studio LP, &quot;New Magnetic Wonder&quot;. Finishing a ten-year deal with spinART Records, &quot;New Magnetic Wonder&quot; was the premiere release on Simian Records, a newly formed record label founded by Elijah Wood. This was followed by a long-awaited b-sides and rarities compilation titled &quot;Electronic Projects for Musicians&quot;, released on April 1.

In 2008, spinART Records went out of business. Rights for all major releases by the Apples in Stereo on the label were subsequently acquired by One Little Indian Records, and have since reverted to the band. In a recent interview, Schneider noted that the band&#x27;s EPs have yet to have been re-released, but will likely be collected for another compilation. Such a compilation would probably include the re-releases of &quot;Look Away + 4&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Go!&quot; and a number of non-album songs released alongside &quot;New Magnetic Wonder&quot;.

On August 4, 2008, the band appeared again on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;. They performed their song &quot;Can You Feel It?&quot; to promote the release of the Japanese picture disc.

In early 2008, their song &quot;Same Old Drag&quot; won in The 7th Annual Independent Music Awards for Best Pop/Rock Song. The same year Apples in Stereo were nominated for Independent Music Awards Pop/Rock Album of the Year. The band members also joined the 9th annual Independent Music Awards judging panel to assist independent musicians&#x27; careers.

===2009–2011: &quot;#1 Hits Explosion&quot; and &quot;Travellers in Space and Time&quot;===

Yep Roc released &quot;#1 Hits Explosion&quot;, an Apples in Stereo best-of album, on September 1, 2009.

In late 2008, PepsiCo released an advertisement with their song &quot;Energy&quot; off of their album New Magnetic Wonder.

In early 2009, Robert appeared on ABC News&#x27;s segment called &quot;amplified&quot; and gave some short performances of songs from New Magnetic Wonder and a song from his project &quot;Robert Bobbert and the bubble machine&quot; and he described the album as sounding like early 1970s R&amp;B as it would sound played by aliens and emanating from an alien spaceship.He also confirmed that the band was recording their new album at Trout Recording in Brooklyn, New York. In interviews in &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine and other press outlets,

In April 2009, the single &quot;Energy&quot; from &quot;New Magnetic Wonder&quot; was performed by the contestants on the television show &quot;American Idol&quot; and also appears in the AGL Energy commercial in Australia.

The result was the band&#x27;s seventh album &quot;Travellers in Space and Time&quot;, released on April 20, 2010, on Simian Records. Described by Schneider as a &quot;retro-futuristic&quot; concept album intended as a time capsule for listeners of the future, &quot;Travellers&quot; has drawn comparisons to the style of Electric Light Orchestra. The record is the first Apples in Stereo album without Hilarie Sidney, making Schneider the last founding member remaining in the group, although John Hill joined before &quot;in stereo&quot; was added to the name. The band was invited by Jeff Mangum of Neutral Milk Hotel to perform at the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival that he curated in March 2012 in Minehead, England.

Schneider announced in May 2012 that the Apples in Stereo had begun work on a new album, described as being &quot;a very, very different sort of album.&quot;

In recent years, Schneider has explored a number of experimental music projects, such as the Teletron mind-controlled synthesizer and Non-Pythagorean scale of his own invention.

===2012–present: Death of Bill Doss, hiatus and future===
The death of Bill Doss, the band&#x27;s keyboardist as well as the co-founder of fellow Elephant 6 band the Olivia Tremor Control, was announced on July 31, 2012. The cause of death was an aneurysm. Schneider released a statement saying, &quot;I am heartbroken by the loss of my life-long friend, collaborator and band-mate. My world will never be the same without the wonderful, funny, supremely creative Bill Doss.&quot;

The band went into hiatus in the fall of 2012, after Doss&#x27; death and Schneider&#x27;s acceptance into the PhD program in Mathematics at Emory University. In 2013, Phish started covering the Apples in Stereo song &quot;Energy.&quot;

In early 2017, Schneider hinted at a new album called &quot;The Bicycle Day&quot;. He stated on Facebook that &quot;Apples are working on a concept record called The Bicycle Day but it is too deep of a task to finish while I&#x27;m in graduate school... it isn&#x27;t a pop record though ... (Air-Sea Dolphin and my band Spaceflyte with John Ferguson are the new pop projects though)&quot;. On August 10, 2017, the Apples played their first show since 2012 as a headlining act at the Athens Popfest music festival in Athens, Georgia with Marshmallow Coast, Antlered Auntlord, and Waxahatchee as prior performers.

In 2018, Schneider received a PhD in mathematics from Emory. In 2021, Schneider became a mathematics lecturer at University of Georgia. As of 2022, Schneider is Assistant Professor, Mathematical Sciences at Michigan Technological University.

<text>Pietro Alessandro Guglielmi (9 December 1728 – 19 November 1804) was an Italian opera composer of the classical period.

==Biography==
Guglielmi was born into the Guglielmi family of musicians in Massa. His father, Jacopo Guglielmi, was a composer and conductor of the orchestra in the court of the Duke of Massa. Pietro received his first musical education from his father who taught him to play bassoon and the viola; eventually becoming a musician under his father at court while still a boy. Pietro&#x27;s brother, Abate Domenico, was the maestro di cappella at the Massa Cathedral, and Pietro studied the organ under him. 

A child prodigy, Guglielmi&#x27;s talent as a musician earned him the favor of the Duke of Massa who took an interest in supporting his musical development. The Duke initially paid for Guglielmi to have formal musical training with Jacopo Puccini (the great-great-grandfather of Giacomo Puccini) in Massa, and afterwards paid his tuition for his education at the Conservatorio di Santa Maria di Loreto in Naples which he entered in 1746.At that conservatory he was a pupil of Francesco Durante, and in 1750 he was appointed a primo maestrino (a post responsible for teaching younger students) at that institution. He completed his studies at the conservatory in 1754. 

His first operatic work, produced at Turin in 1755, established his reputation, and soon his fame spread beyond the limits of his own country, so that in 1762 he was called to Dresden to conduct the opera there. He remained for some years in Germany, where his works met with much success, but the greatest triumphs were reserved for him in England.

He went to London, according to Charles Burney, in 1768, but according to Francesco Florimo in 1772, returned to Naples in 1777. He continued to produce operas at an astounding rate, but was unable to compete successfully with the younger masters of the day. In 1793 he became &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; at St Peter&#x27;s, Rome, where he died in 1804.

He was a very prolific composer of Italian dramma giocoso and commedia per musica operas, and there is in most of his scores a vein of humour and natural gaiety not surpassed by Domenico Cimarosa himself. In opera seria he was less successful. But here also he shows at least the qualities of a competent musician. Considering the enormous number of his works, his unequal workmanship and the frequent instances of mechanical and slipshod writing in his music need not surprise us.

He also wrote oratorios and miscellaneous pieces of orchestral and chamber music. Of his eight sons two at least acquired fame as musicians: Pietro Carlo Guglielmi (1763-1827), a successful imitator of his father&#x27;s operatic style, and Giacomo Guglielmi, an excellent singer.

<text>External Data Representation (XDR) is a standard data serialization format, for uses such as computer network protocols. It allows data to be transferred between different kinds of computer systems. Converting from the local representation to XDR is called &quot;encoding&quot;. Converting from XDR to the local representation is called &quot;decoding&quot;. XDR is implemented as a software library of functions which is portable between different operating systems and is also independent of the transport layer.

XDR uses a base unit of 4 bytes, serialized in big-endian order; smaller data types still occupy four bytes each after encoding. Variable-length types such as string and opaque are padded to a total divisible by four bytes. Floating-point numbers are represented in IEEE 754 format.

==History==
XDR was developed in the mid 1980s at Sun Microsystems, and first widely published in 1987.
XDR became an IETF standard in 1995.

The XDR data format is in use by many systems, including:
* Network File System (protocol)
* ZFS File System
* NDMP Network Data Management Protocol
* Open Network Computing Remote Procedure Call
* Legato NetWorker backup software (later sold by EMC)
* NetCDF (a scientific data format)
* The R language and environment for statistical computing
* The HTTP-NG Binary Wire Protocol
* The SpiderMonkey JavaScript engine, to serialize/deserialize compiled JavaScript code
* The Ganglia distributed monitoring system
* The sFlow network monitoring standard
* The libvirt virtualization library, API and UI
*The Firebird (database server) for Remote Binary Wire Protocol
* Stellar Payment Network

== XDR data types ==
* boolean
* int – 32-bit integer
* unsigned int – unsigned 32-bit integer
* hyper – 64-bit integer
* unsigned hyper – unsigned 64-bit integer
* IEEE float
* IEEE double
* quadruple (new in RFC1832)
* enumeration
* structure
* string
* fixed length array
* variable length array
* union – discriminated union
* fixed length opaque data
* variable length opaque data
* void – zero byte quantity
* optional – optional data is notated similarly to C pointers, but is represented as the data type &quot;pointed to&quot; with a Boolean &quot;present or not&quot; flag. Semantically this is option type.

<text>Eumseong County () is a county in North Chungcheong Province, South Korea, best known for being the birthplace of former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.

Eumseong Clean Peppers Festival is held in Eumseong-gun, Chungbuk every September. It has been held since 1982. It is held along with the Seolseong Cultural Festival. Events such as chili pepper fairy, Mr. chili pepper contest, fireworks, and county people&#x27;s singing contest will be held together with events such as masquerade, torch relay, demonstration event, folk game, and athletic competition. Since 2009, the Eumseong Clean Pepper Lady Contest has been held instead of the Red Pepper Fairy Contest.

==History==
Eumseong County is composed of two towns (&quot;eup&quot;) and seven townships (&quot;myeon&quot;), with a total population of 98,619 people (including foreigners) as of March 31, 2013. The most central town is Geumwang (which also goes by the name Muguk). 
Although Jincheon-gun and Chungbuk Innovation City are jointly attracted to each other, they have the advantage that infrastructure is concentrated in areas that are promoted to the city first, so they are forming a rivalry with the leadership of Chungbuk Innovation City.

Eumseong-gun is a traditional agricultural area based on fertile soil and abundant water resources. It is located in the center of the country, classified as the Han River and Geum River basin, and borders Icheon-si, Gyeonggi-do to the north, Anseong-si, Gyeonggi-do to the northwest, Chungju-si, Chungcheongbuk-do to the east, Goesan-gun, Chungcheongbuk-do to the south, and Jincheon-gun, Chungcheongbuk-do to the west. In particular, the northwest has many mountains and hills and abundant water sources, so it has been a fertile land with good farming since ancient times, and has been famous for its kind people. There are no famous mountains nationwide, but as part of the Sobaek Mountains, beautiful mountains with well-preserved natural ecosystems such as Gaseop-san (710 m), Buyong-san (644 m), Suri-san (505 m), and Sureui-san (679 m) are loved by mountaineers from other regions.

Many farmers live in Eumseong County. They host two cultural festivals: the Pumba (traditional vagabond) Festival (품바축제) in the spring and the Gochu (chili pepper) Festival (고추축제) in the fall. Eumseong is famous in Korea for its production of high-quality red chili peppers. Eumseong is also renowned for its strawberries, ginseng, watermelon, and beef.

Eumseong County is home to three different high schools. Eumseong High School is located in the city of Eumseong, Chungbuk Semi-Conductor High School is located in Geumwang, and Maegoe High School is located in Gamgok. Maegoe is a Catholic all girls middle school as well as a mixed gender high school located at the base of a steep sided hill under a Christ-shaped statue. In addition, Global Vision Christian School|GVCS, an English-speaking Christian boarding school, is located in the city of Eumseong.

There are two institutes of higher education in Eumseong county that are both located in the township Gamgok - Far East University and Gangdong College. Far East University is a four-year school while Gangdong College has only a two-year program. As of 2013, 20 to 30 foreign English teachers live in Eumseong County, who are from countries including the United States of America, Canada, South Africa, England, and Scotland.

The name &quot;Eumseong&quot; means &quot;shaded castle&quot; and is not to be confused with its homonym &quot;human voice&quot;.

In 1956, Eumseong&#x27;s status was promoted from township to town. In 1973, Geumwang&#x27;s status was also promoted to that of a town.

Historically, the area of &#x27;Eumseong&#x27; was limited to the current Eumseong-eup and Wonnam-myeon areas, and all other towns and villages were the areas of Chungju.

== Samseong ==

Samseong is located in the northwest of Eumseong County, just east of the Jungbu Expressway.
The township&#x27;s bus terminal has connections to Dong Seoul station that take about 1.5 hours as well as connections to other provincial cities and towns.

Samseong has a middle school, an elementary school and several private academies or hagwons. The township is arranged principally around one street, which comprises a covered market, CU, 7 Eleven, Paris Baguette, and many Korean restaurants and hofs.

There are rice paddies between the various factories. In addition there are two sizeable lakes and a mountain named Mai San which is excellent for hiking.

Known for spotting wildlife, Samseong was formerly a prime location for encountering species now thought to be endangered.

<text>The little shearwater (Puffinus assimilis) is a small shearwater in the petrel family Procellariidae. Despite the generic name, it is unrelated to the puffins, which are auks, the only similarity being that they are both burrow-nesting seabirds.

==Description==
This shearwater has the typically &quot;shearing&quot; flight of the genus, dipping from side to side on stiff wings with few beats, the wingtips almost touching the water, though in light winds it has a more flapping flight than that of its larger relatives. In flight it looks cross-shaped, with its wings held at right angles to the body, its colouration changing from black to white as the black upperparts and white underparts are alternately exposed as it travels low over the sea.

At in length with a wingspan, it is like a small Manx shearwater but has proportionally shorter and broader wings, with a pale area on the inner flight feathers. Its bill is more slender than that of Manx, and its dark eye stands out against the surrounding white area.

==Taxonomy==
mtDNA cytochrome &quot;b&quot; sequence data indicate that the former North Atlantic little shearwater group (Boyd&#x27;s shearwater, &quot;P. boydi&quot; and Barolo shearwater, &quot;P. baroli&quot;) is closer to Audubon&#x27;s shearwater (Austin 1996, Heidrich &quot;et al.&quot; 1998), (although many taxonomists now consider them to be distinct species), and Rapa shearwater (&quot;P. myrtae&quot;), being closer to the Newell&#x27;s and possibly Townsend&#x27;s shearwater (Austin &quot;et al.&quot; 2004). Heinroth&#x27;s shearwater was also sometimes considered a subspecies of this bird; the relationship between the little and Audubon&#x27;s shearwater is probably not as close as long believed (Austin 1996, Heidrich &quot;et al.&quot; 1998, Austin &quot;et al.&quot; 2001, but see also Penhallurick &amp; Wink 2004, and Rheindt &amp; Austin 2005). The subantarctic shearwater was also considered conspecific (Onley &amp; Scofield 2007, Gill et al. 2010)

==Distribution and habitat==
* &quot;P. a. assimilis&quot; Gould, 1838 — Lord Howe Island and Norfolk Island 
* &quot;P. a. haurakiensis&quot; Fleming, CA &amp; Serventy, 1943 — northeastern North Island (NZ) 
* &quot;P. a. kermadecensis&quot; Murphy, 1927 — Kermadec Islands 
* &quot;P. a. tunneyi&quot; Mathews, 1912 — islands off southwestern Australia

It breeds in colonies on islands and coastal cliffs, nesting in burrows which are only visited at night to avoid predation by large gulls.

==Behaviour==
This is a gregarious species, which can be seen in large numbers from boats or headlands, especially on migration in autumn. It feeds on fish and molluscs. It does not follow boats. It is silent at sea, but at night the breeding colonies are alive with raucous cackling calls.

It nests in cavities located in grassy fields or in those found among rocks.

The little shearwater usually produces a clutch of one clear white egg, measuring around . The egg is incubated for 52 to 58 days by both sexes.

<doc id="392127" wikidata="Q83584" url="?curid=392127" title="Odakyu Electric Railway">
<text>, commonly known as Odakyū or Odawara Kyuko, is a major railway company based in Tokyo, Japan, best known for its &quot;Romancecar&quot; series of limited express trains from Tokyo to Odawara, Enoshima, Tama New Town, and Hakone.

The Odakyu Electric Railway Company forms the core of the Odakyu Group, which comprises 101 companies (as of July 14, 2017) and includes the Enoshima Electric Railway, Hakone Tozan Railway, , , and hotel. It is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the Nikkei 225.

==History==
===Pre-WWII===

The line from Shinjuku to Odawara opened for service on 1 April 1927. Unlike the Odawara line, rarely were pre-World War II Japanese private railways constructed with double-track and fully electrified from the first day of operation. Two years later, on 1 April 1929, the Enoshima Line was added.

The original full name of the railroad was , but this was often shortened to . The abbreviation &quot;Odakyu&quot; was made popular by the title song of the 1929 movie &quot;Tōkyō kōshinkyoku&quot; and eventually became the official name of the railroad on March 1, 1941.

On 1 May 1942, Odakyu merged with the Tokyo-Yokohama Electric Railway company (now Tokyu Corporation), which controlled all private railway services west and south of Tokyo by the end of World War II.

===Post-WWII===

The company regained its independence on June 1, 1948, and it obtained a large amount of Hakone Tozan Railway stocks, instead of separating Keio Inokashira Line for Keio Corporation. Odakyu restarted Non-stop Limited Express service between Shinjuku and Odawara in 1948. In 1950, Odakyu trains ran through to Hakone-Yumoto on Hakone Tozan Line. Odakyu uses narrow-gauge tracks, but the Hakone Tozan Railway is , so one track of the section from Odawara to Hakone-Yumoto () was changed to a dual gauge system. Odakyu operated the first &quot;Romancecar&quot; (1710 series) limited express in 1951.

After the 1950s, due to rapid Japanese economic growth, Odakyu was faced with an explosive increase of population along with its lines. Commuter passengers had to use very crowded trains every morning, and complained strongly with the delay of improvements from the railway company. Odakyu began construction on the - &quot;Shinjuku Station Great Improvement Project&quot; setting 5 lines and 10 platforms long enough for 10 standard commuter cars with service on the Chiyoda Line, among others. Plans for a four-track system in 1964 were prevented by residents of Setagaya Ward in Tokyo, as such the system remains uncompleted. The Setagaya Residents&#x27; opposition set the stage for a long-term and remarkable case in the courts and legislature. Odakyu could not take main part of transport from Tama New Town Area, though Odakyu started the operation of Tama Line in 1974. To serve its Mukōgaoka-Yūen Amusement Park, Odakyu operated the Mukōgaoka-Yūen Monorail Line between Mukōgaoka-Yūen and Mukōgaoka-Yūen-Seimon (, 2 stations) beginning in 1966 using a Lockheed Corporation style monorail system; the system was closed in 2001 when the amusement park was shut down.

===Post-millennium===

Since 2000, Odakyū has been adding track in both directions from Izumi-Tamagawa Station, on Tama River, the border station of Tokyo, to just outside Setagaya-Daita Station for expanding the availability of express trains, especially for morning commuter service. The lines between Setagaya-Daita and Higashi-Kitazawa Station are still under construction, however. Odakyu announced that the bottle-neck will be resolved by 2013.

All of its lines are double- or quadruple-tracked within Tokyo Metropolis as of March 2018, a project first decided in December 1964 but due to NIMBY land acquisition difficulties, complex and expensive workarounds were constructed and finished, taking a half century. The main or Odawara Line acts as a bypass route for the Tōkaidō Main Line from Tokyo to western Kanagawa. The &quot;Romancecar&quot; 3000 series &quot;SE&quot; was tested at speeds of up to in 1957, achieving a world record for narrow-gauge lines at the time. These tests also provided important data on high-speed electric multiple units (EMU), which Japanese National Railways (JNR) used for its limited express EMUs, 151 series, and 0 Series Shinkansen introduced in the early 1960s.

Odakyu celebrated its 80th anniversary in April 2007. The 50th anniversary of the Romancecar was celebrated in September 2007.

Station numbers were introduced to all Odakyū Line stations in 2014, with stations numbered using the prefix &quot;OH&quot;.

Odakyu are the current shirt sponsors of football club Machida Zelvia.

On 6 August 2021, a mass stabbing incident occurred on one of its commuter services when a man stabbed nine passengers, seriously injuring a woman before trying to ignite a fire on the compartment. The man escaped and was arrested hours later.

==Lines==

Odakyu owns three railway lines directly, and another three lines via subsidiaries. It also operates trains onto the Tokyo Metro Chiyoda Line, JR East Jōban Line, and JR Central Gotemba Line.

* Not including the connecting branch between Odawara Line and JR Central Gotemba Line near Shin-Matsuda Station.
*Many Odakyu Tama Line trains (and selected Odawara Line trains from ) continue on to the Chiyoda and Jōban lines for and - stations. This service began in 1978 between Hon-Atsugi and stations.
*Some Odakyū trains continue on the Odakyu-owned Hakone Tozan Line to .
*Limited express &quot;Mt. Fuji&quot; trains travel from Shinjuku through on the JR Central Gotemba Line to Gotemba Station eight times a day.

==Train classification==
(As of March 17, 2018 timetable revision)

&quot;Romancecar&quot; limited express services require a supplementary surcharge.


==Limited express service==

===Shinjuku Station routes===
Commuter service is shown on each line&#x27;s page.

* &quot;Mt. Fuji&quot; trains run on the connecting branch line just before Shin-Matsuda from Shinjuku and stops at Matsuda on the Gotemba Line. Matsuda and Shin-Matsuda are treated as the same station.
* &quot;Home Way&quot; trains run from Shinjuku every evening after 18:00. There is no service to Shinjuku.

===Tokyo Metro routes===
Commuter services are shown on each line&#x27;s page.

* At Yoyogi-Uehara, all trains pause, but there is no service for passengers; Odakyū and Tokyo Metro change their operating staff at the station.
* On weekday mornings, &quot;Metro Sagami&quot; trains run once from Hon-Atsugi to Kita-Senju.
* On weekday evenings, &quot;Metro Homeway&quot; trains run twice from Hon-Atsugi to Kita-Senju and once from Ōtemachi to Hon-Atsugi.
* On weekends and holidays, &quot;Metro Hakone&quot; trains run between Kita-Senju and Hakone-Yumoto four times; &quot;Metro Sagami&quot; (once in the morning) and &quot;Metro Homeway&quot; (once in the evening) trains also run between Kita-Senju and Hon-Atsugi.
* Once or twice per month, &quot;Metro Sagami&quot; and &quot;Metro Homeway&quot; become &quot;Bay Resort&quot; trains, traveling between Shin-Kiba and Hon-Atsugi. They travel to/from the Tokyo Metro Yūrakuchō and Chiyoda lines.

==Odakyu Electric Railway in media==

The Odakyu Railway has been included in several Japanese language train simulator programs as well as the English language &quot;Microsoft Train Simulator&quot; program. &quot;Microsoft Train Simulator&quot; includes the railway&#x27;s Odawara and Hakone Tozan lines, collectively referred to as the &quot;Tokyo-Hakone&quot; route, with the 2000 series commuter trainset and the 7000 series &quot;LSE&quot; &quot;Romancecar&quot; trainset being player driveable. Several &quot;activities&quot;, or scenarios, are included.

Various Odakyu add-ins are available for the BVE Train Simulator, a freeware cab view train simulator for Microsoft Windows.

<doc id="392128" wikidata="Q1110053" url="?curid=392128" title="List of governors of Acadia">
<text>The governance of the French colony of Acadia has a long and tangled history. Founded in 1603 by Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Monts, the territory of Acadia (roughly, the present-day Canadian provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island, and portions of the U. S. state of Maine) was hotly contested in the 17th century. It was claimed by English and Scottish interests, fought over by competing French governors, and subjected to raids and attacks from English colonists that sometimes resulted in years of occupation of some of its communities. Most of the non-French claims were given up under the 1667 Treaty of Breda, but the territory did not come completely under French control until three years later. From 1670 until 1710 the province remained in French hands, except for a brief period in the 1670s when Dutch attackers occupied several Acadian communities. In 1710 a British expedition including Royal Navy warships and colonial forces from New England captured Acadia&#x27;s capital for good, and France ceded an ill-defined territory to Britain in the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht. Although France continued to claim those portions of present-day Maine and New Brunswick that constituted part Acadia, it had no formal government prior to the British conquest of New France in 1760. The first British governor of Nova Scotia was Samuel Vetch; he took command immediately after the 1710 capture.

Most of Acadia&#x27;s French governors operated under commissions given by the French crown. During the periods of turmoil in the mid 17th century, they acted more like proprietary governors, acting primarily in their own interests, or in those of their corporate supporters. A Scottish proprietary colony named New Scotland (the origin of the name &quot;Nova Scotia&quot;) was granted to William Stirling in 1621; this claim was formally abandoned with the 1632 Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye. Even though there were English claims to the territory under the 1620 charter granted to the Plymouth Council for New England, there was no English settlement of the territory under its authority. In 1656 two Englishmen, Thomas Temple and William Crowne, acquired the French interest of Charles de Saint-Étienne de la Tour, who had been governing part of the territory under a French commission. They ruled over his territories until 1670, when they turned their lands over to French governor Hector d&#x27;Andigné de Grandfontaine. Some of the later appointments were not as governors; these were military men who were commissioned as commandant of Acadia, and acted under the direction of the Governor General of New France.

<doc id="392143" wikidata="Q191684" url="?curid=392143" title="Palomar Observatory">
<text>Palomar Observatory is an astronomical research observatory in the Palomar Mountains of San Diego County, California, United States. It is owned and operated by the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). Research time at the observatory is granted to Caltech and its research partners, which include the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Yale University, and the National Astronomical Observatories of China.

The observatory operates several telescopes, including the Hale Telescope, the Samuel Oschin telescope (dedicated to the Zwicky Transient Facility, ZTF), the Palomar Telescope, and the Gattini-IR telescope. Decommissioned instruments include the Palomar Testbed Interferometer and the first telescopes at the observatory, an Schmidt camera from 1936.

==History==
===Hale&#x27;s vision for large telescopes and Palomar Observatory===

Astronomer George Ellery Hale, whose vision created Palomar Observatory, built the world&#x27;s largest telescope four times in succession. He published a 1928 article proposing what was to become the 200-inch Palomar reflector; it was an invitation to the American public to learn about how large telescopes could help answer questions relating to the fundamental nature of the universe. Hale followed this article with a letter to the International Education Board (later absorbed into the General Education Board) of the Rockefeller Foundation dated April 16, 1928, in which he requested funding for this project. In his letter, Hale stated:

&quot;No method of advancing science is so productive as the development of new and more powerful instruments and methods of research. A larger telescope would not only furnish the necessary gain in light space-penetration and photographic resolving power, but permit the application of ideas and devices derived chiefly from the recent fundamental advances in physics and chemistry.&quot;

===Hale Telescope===
The 200-inch telescope is named after astronomer and telescope builder George Ellery Hale. It was built by Caltech with a $6 million grant from the Rockefeller Foundation, using a Pyrex blank manufactured by Corning Glass Works under the direction of George McCauley. Dr. J.A. Anderson was the initial project manager, assigned in the early 1930s. The telescope (the largest in the world at that time) saw first light January 26, 1949, targeting NGC 2261. The American astronomer Edwin Powell Hubble was the first astronomer to use the telescope.

The 200-inch telescope was the largest telescope in the world from 1949 until 1975, when the Russian BTA-6 telescope saw first light. Astronomers using the Hale Telescope have discovered quasars (a subset of what was to become known as Active Galactic Nuclei) at cosmological distances. They have studied the chemistry of stellar populations, leading to an understanding of the stellar nucleosynthesis as to origin of elements in the universe in their observed abundances, and have discovered thousands of asteroids. A one-tenth-scale engineering model of the telescope at Corning Community College in Corning, New York, home of the Corning Glass Works (now Corning Incorporated), was used to discover at least one minor planet, 34419 Corning.

===Architecture and design===
Russell W. Porter developed the Art Deco architecture of the Observatory&#x27;s buildings, including the dome of the 200-inch Hale Telescope. Porter was also responsible for much of the technical design of the Hale Telescope and Schmidt Cameras, producing a series of cross-section engineering drawings. Porter worked on the designs in collaboration with many engineers and Caltech committee members.

Max Mason directed the construction and Theodore von Karman was involved in the engineering.

===Directors===
* Ira Sprague Bowen, 1948–1964
* Horace Welcome Babcock, 1964–1978
* Maarten Schmidt, 1978–1980
* Gerry Neugebauer, 1980–1994
* James Westphal, 1994–1997
* Wallace Leslie William Sargent, 1997–2000
* Richard Ellis, 2000–2006
* Shrinivas Kulkarni, 2006–2018
* Jonas Zmuidzinas, 2018–

===Palomar Observatory and light pollution===

Much of the surrounding region of Southern California has adopted shielded lighting to reduce the light pollution that would potentially affect the observatory.

==Telescopes and instruments==

* The Hale Telescope was first proposed in 1928 and has been operational since 1949. It was the largest telescope in the world for 26 years.
* A reflecting telescope is located in the Oscar Mayer Building, and operates fully robotically. The telescope became operational in 1970, and was built to increase sky access for Palomar astronomers. Among its notable accomplishments is the discovery of the first brown dwarf. The 60-inch telescope currently hosts the SED Machine integral field spectrograph instrument used as part of ZTF transient followup and classification.
* The Samuel Oschin telescope development began in 1938, and the telescope saw first light in 1948. It was initially called the 48-inch Schmidt, and was dedicated to Samuel Oschin in 1986. Among many notable accomplishments, Oschin observations led to the discovery of the important dwarf planets Eris and Sedna. Eris&#x27;s discovery initiated discussions in the international astronomy community that led to Pluto being re-classified as a dwarf planet in 2006. The Oschin presently operates fully robotically and hosts the 570-million-pixel ZTF Camera —the discovery engine for the ZTF project.
* The WINTER (The Wide-field Infrared Transient Explorer) 1x1-degree reflecting robotic telescope has been operational since 2021. It is dedicated to the seeing-limited time domain survey of the infrared (IR) sky, with a particular emphasis on identifying r-process material in binary neutron star (BNS) merger remnants detected by LIGO. The instrument observes in Y, J, and a short-H (Hs) band tuned to the long-wave cutoff of the InGaAs sensors, covering a wavelength range from 0.9 to 1.7 microns.

===Decommissioned instruments===
* An Schmidt camera became the first operational telescope at the Palomar in 1936. In the 1930s, Fritz Zwicky and Walter Baade advocated adding survey telescopes at Palomar, and the 18-inch was developed to demonstrate the Schmidt concept. Zwicky used the 18-inch to discover over 100 supernovae in other galaxies. Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 was discovered with this instrument in 1993. It has since been decommissioned and is on display at the small museum/visitor center.
* The Palomar Testbed Interferometer (PTI) was a multi-telescope instrument that made high-angular-resolution measurements of the apparent sizes and relative positions of stars. The apparent sizes and in some cases shapes of bright stars were measured with PTI, as well as the apparent orbits of multiple stellar systems. PTI operated from 1995 to 2008.
* The Palomar Planet Search Telescope (PPST), also known as Sleuth, was a robotic telescope that operated from 2003 until 2008. It was dedicated to the search for planets around other stars using the transit method. It operated in conjunction with telescopes at Lowell Observatory and in the Canary Islands as part of the Trans-Atlantic Exoplanet Survey (TrES).

==Research==
Palomar Observatory remains an active research facility, operating multiple telescopes every clear night, and supporting a large international community of astronomers who study a broad range of research topics.

The Hale Telescope remains in active research use and operates with a diverse instrument suite of optical and near-infrared spectrometers and imaging cameras at multiple foci. The Hale also operates with a multi-stage, high-order adaptive optics system to provide diffraction-limited imaging in the near-infrared. Key historical science results with the Hale include cosmological measurement of the Hubble flow, the discovery of quasars as the precursor of Active Galactic Nuclei, and studies of stellar populations and stellar nucleosynthesis.

The Oschin and 60-inch telescopes operate robotically and together support a major transient astronomy program, the Zwicky Transient Facility.

The Oschin was created to facilitate astronomical reconnaissance, and has been used in many notable astronomical surveys—among them are:

===POSS-I===
The initial Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS or POSS-I), sponsored by the National Geographic Institute, was completed in 1958. The first plates were exposed in November 1948 and the last in April 1958. This survey was performed using 14-inch2 (6-degree2) blue-sensitive (Kodak 103a-O) and red-sensitive (Kodak 103a-E) photographic plates on the Oschin Telescope. The survey covered the sky from a declination of +90° (celestial north pole) to −27° and all right ascensions and had a sensitivity to +22 magnitudes (about 1 million times fainter than the limit of human vision). A southern extension extending the sky coverage of the POSS to −33° declination was shot in 1957–1958. The final POSS I dataset consisted of 937 plate pairs.

The Digitized Sky Survey (DSS) produced images which were based on the photographic data developed in the course of POSS-I.

J.B. Whiteoak, an Australian radio astronomer, used the same instrument to extend POSS-I data south to −42° declination. Whiteoak&#x27;s observations used using the same field centers as the corresponding northern declination zones. Unlike POSS-I, the Whiteoak extension consisted only of red-sensitive (Kodak 103a-E) photographic plates.

===POSS-II===
The Second Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS II, sometimes Second Palomar Sky Survey) was performed in the 1980s and 1990s and made use of better, faster films and an upgraded telescope. The Oschin Schmidt was upgraded with an achromatic corrector and provisions for autoguiding. Images were recorded in three wavelengths: blue (IIIaJ. 480 nm), red (IIIaF, 650 nm), and near-infrared (IVN, 850 nm) plates. Observers on POSS II included C. Brewer, D. Griffiths, W. McKinley, J. Dave Mendenhall, K. Rykoski, Jeffrey L. Phinney, and Jean Mueller (who discovered over 100 supernovae by comparing the POSS I and POSS II plates). Mueller also discovered several comets and minor planets during the course of POSS II, and the bright Comet Wilson 1986 was discovered by then-graduate-student C. Wilson early in the survey.

Until the completion of the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS), POSS II was the most extensive wide-field sky survey. When completed, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey will surpass POSS I and POSS II in depth, although the POSS covers almost 2.5 times more area on the sky.

POSS II also exists in digitized form (that is, the photographic plates were scanned) as part of the Digitized Sky Survey (DSS).

===QUEST===
The multi-year POSS projects were followed by the Palomar Quasar Equatorial Survey Team (QUEST) Variability survey. This survey yielded results that were used by several projects, including the Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking project. Another program that used the QUEST results discovered 90377 Sedna on 14 November 2003, and around 40 Kuiper belt objects. Other programs that share the camera are Shri Kulkarni&#x27;s search for gamma-ray bursts (this takes advantage of the automated telescope&#x27;s ability to react as soon as a burst is seen and take a series of snapshots of the fading burst), Richard Ellis&#x27;s search for supernovae to test whether the universe&#x27;s expansion is accelerating or not, and S. George Djorgovski&#x27;s quasar search.

The camera for the Palomar QUEST Survey was a mosaic of 112 charge-coupled devices (CCDs) covering the whole (4° × 4°) field of view of the Schmidt telescope. At the time it was built, it was the largest CCD mosaic used in an astronomical camera. This instrument was used to produce The Big Picture, the largest astronomical photograph ever produced. The Big Picture is on display at Griffith Observatory.

===Current research===
Current research programs on the 200-inch Hale Telescope cover the range of the observable universe, including studies on near-Earth asteroids, outer Solar System planets, Kuiper Belt objects, star formation, exoplanets, black holes and x-ray binaries, supernovae and other transient source followup, and quasars/Active Galactic Nuclei.

The 48-inch Samuel Oschin Schmidt Telescope operates robotically, and supports a new transient astronomy sky survey, the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF).

The 60-inch telescope operates robotically, and supports ZTF by providing rapid, low-dispersion optical spectra for initial transient classification using the for-purpose Spectral Energy Distribution Machine (SEDM) integral field spectrograph.

==Visiting and public engagement==

Palomar Observatory is an active research facility. However, selected observatory areas are open to the public during the day. Visitors can take self-guided tours of the 200-inch telescope daily from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. The observatory is open 7 days a week, year round, except for December 24 and 25 and during times of inclement weather. Guided tours of the 200-inch Hale Telescope dome and observing area are available Saturdays and Sundays from April through October. Behind-the-scenes tours for the public are offered through the community support group, Palomar Observatory Docents.

Palomar Observatory also has an on-site museum—the Greenway Visitor Center, containing observatory and astronomy-relevant exhibits, a gift shop, and hosts periodic public events.

For those unable to travel to the observatory, Palomar provides an extensive virtual tour that provides virtual access to all the major research telescopes on-site and the Greenway Center and has extensive embedded multimedia to provide additional context. Similarly the observatory actively maintains an extensive website and YouTube channel to support public engagement.

The observatory is located off State Route 76 in northern San Diego County, California, two hours&#x27; drive from downtown San Diego and three hours&#x27; drive from central Los Angeles (UCLA, LAX airport). Those staying at the nearby Palomar Campground can visit Palomar Observatory by hiking up Observatory Trail. Notably, Ben Burt, sound designer for the original Star Wars, recorded various sounds at the Palomar Observatory, including motors and the shutters on the dome, to add background sounds for the Death Star.

==Climate==
Palomar has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen &quot;Csa&quot;).

<doc id="392149" wikidata="Q165231" url="?curid=392149" title="100th Window">
<text>100th Window is the fourth studio album by English electronic music group Massive Attack, released on 10 February 2003 by Virgin Records. The album was mainly produced by lead member Robert “3D” Del Naja, after the departure of Andrew “Mushroom” Vowles from the band shortly after the release of their previous album &quot;Mezzanine&quot; (1998). Grant “Daddy G” Marshall also opted out of the production of the album. &quot;100th Window&quot; features vocals from regular guest Horace Andy, as well as newcomers Sinéad O&#x27;Connor and Damon Albarn (performing as 2D from Gorillaz). Stylistically, it is the first album by the group to make no use of existing samples, and contains none of the hip hop or jazz fusion styles that the group were initially known for.

==Background==
Del Naja initially conceived of &quot;100th Window&quot; in its untitled form in early 2000 at the Christchurch Studios in Clifton, Bristol, recruiting Lupine Howl, a band made up of ex-members of Spiritualized, for the new project. In a November 2001 interview, Lupine Howl&#x27;s lead singer Sean Cook described the sessions as &quot;very experimental [...] minimal loops and noises that were fed to our headphones from the computer up in the control room. Then we would have this sort of extended jam session playing along to them and they would do various things to do the loops.&quot; Del Naja and Davidge also maintained a strobe light in their studio while the band jammed, dictating the intensity of their performances with the lighting. However, in a post to Massive Attack&#x27;s forums in July 2002, Del Naja subsequently announced that the band had become &quot;very unhappy with the shapes being formed&quot;, and that by the beginning of 2002 they had discarded most of the material that was written up to that point; the September 11 attacks also motivated him to depart from the original tone of the album.

==Reception==

Initial critical response to &quot;100th Window&quot; was positive. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has received an average score of 75, based on 25 reviews.

As of February 2010, the album had sold 180,000 copies in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

<doc id="392155" wikidata="Q726909" url="?curid=392155" title="James Napper Tandy">
<text>James Napper Tandy (February 1739 – 24 August 1803), known as Napper Tandy, was an Irish revolutionary and a founder of the United Irishmen. He experienced exile, first in the United States and then in France, for his role in attempting to advance a republican insurrection in Ireland with French assistance.

==Political activism==
A Dubliner, a Protestant (Church of Ireland), and the son of an ironmonger, Tandy was baptised (as &#x27;James Naper Tandy&#x27;) in St. Audoen&#x27;s Church on 16 February 1739. He went to the famous Quaker boarding school in Ballitore, south Kildare, also attended by Edmund Burke, who was eight years older. He then started life as a small tradesman in Dublin&#x27;s inner city. He was a churchwarden at St. Audoen&#x27;s in 1765, and also at another local church (either St. Bride&#x27;s or St. John&#x27;s) where he commissioned a new church bell bearing his name, displayed since 1946 on the floor of St. Werburgh&#x27;s Church.

Turning to politics, he was elected a member of Dublin Corporation representing the Guild of Merchants, and was popular for his denunciation of municipal corruption and his proposal of a boycott of English goods in Ireland in retaliation for the restrictions imposed by the Westminster government on Irish commerce.

In April 1780, Tandy was expelled from the Dublin Volunteers (see Henry Flood) for proposing the expulsion of the Duke of Leinster. He was one of the most conspicuous members of the small revolutionary party, chiefly of the shopkeeper class, that formed a permanent committee in June 1784 to agitate for reform, and called a convention of delegates from all parts of Ireland. This met in October 1784.

Tandy and John Binns persuaded Dublin Corporation to condemn by resolution Pitt&#x27;s amended commercial resolutions in 1785. He became a member of the Whig Club founded by Henry Grattan, but he identified with its radical faction and actively co-operated with Theobald Wolfe Tone in founding the Society of the United Irishmen in 1791, of which he became the first secretary.

His opinions, strongly influenced by French Revolutionary ideas, now brought Tandy to the notice of the authorities. In February 1792, an allusion in a debate by John Toler, the Attorney General of Ireland, to Tandy&#x27;s personal ugliness provoked him into sending a challenge to a duel. This was treated by the House of Commons as a breach of a Member&#x27;s privilege, and a Speaker&#x27;s warrant was issued for his arrest, which he managed to elude until its validity expired on the prorogation of Parliament. Tandy then took proceedings against the Lord Lieutenant for issuing a proclamation for his arrest; although the action failed, it increased Tandy&#x27;s popularity, and his expenses were paid by the Society of the United Irishmen.

==Planning a revolution in exile==
Sympathy with the French Revolution was rapidly spreading in Ireland. A meeting of some 6,000 people in Belfast voted for a congratulatory address to the French nation in July 1791. In the following year, Napper Tandy took a leading part in organising a new military association in Ireland modelled after the French National Guards; they professed republican principles, and on their uniform, the cap of liberty instead of the crown surmounted the Irish harp. Tandy also, with the purpose of bringing about a fusion between the Defenders and the United Irishmen, took the oath of the Defenders, a Roman Catholic society whose agrarian and political violence had been increasing for several years.

He was about to be tried in 1793 for distributing a seditious pamphlet in County Louth when the government found out he had taken the oath of the Defenders. Being threatened with prosecution for this step, and also for libel, he took refuge by changing his Dublin address often. In 1795 he fled to the United States, where he remained until 1798. In February of that year, he went to Paris, where a number of Irish refugees, the most prominent of whom was Wolfe Tone, were assembled, planning rebellion in Ireland to be supported by a French invasion, but quarrelling among themselves over tactics.

==Return to Ireland==
Tandy accepted the offer of a corvette, (later captured by the British and renamed ), from the French government and sailed from Dunkirk accompanied by a few United Irishmen, a small force of men and a considerable quantity of arms and ammunition for distribution in Ireland. He arrived at the isle of Arranmore, off the coast of County Donegal, on 16 September 1798.

The locality, however, was sparsely populated and showed little enthusiasm for joining the expedition. Tandy took possession of the village of Rutland, where he hoisted an Irish flag and issued a proclamation; but learning of the defeat of Humbert&#x27;s expedition, and that Connaught was now subdued, the futility of the enterprise was soon apparent. Tandy sailed his vessel round the north of Scotland to avoid the British fleet. He reached Bergen in safety having brought with him a British ship captured along the way. Tandy then made his way with three or four companions to the free port of Hamburg, where he met a British officer whom he warned to hide from the French agents. A peremptory demand from the British government to detain the fugitives was acceded to despite a counter-threat from the French Directory. In 1799 HMS &quot;Xenophon&quot;, under Commander George Sayer, brought Tandy and some of his associates back to England as state prisoners.

==Exile==
On 12 February 1800, Tandy was put on trial at Dublin and was acquitted. He remained in prison in Lifford Jail in County Donegal until April 1801, when he was tried for the treasonable landing on Rutland Island. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to death but he was reprieved and allowed to go to France. This leniency may have been partly due to doubts as to the legality of the demand for his surrender by the Hamburg authorities. Moreover, Napoleon vigorously intervened on his behalf and is even said to have made Tandy&#x27;s release a condition of signing the Treaty of Amiens.

Tandy supported the Haitian Revolution and opposed French attempts to suppress it, saying &quot;we are all of the same family, black and white, the work of the same creator&quot;.

Notwithstanding his vices and his lack of all solid capacity, there is no reason to suppose that Napper Tandy was dishonest or insincere; and the manner in which his name was introduced in the well-known ballad &quot;The Wearing of the Green&quot; proves that he succeeded in impressing the popular imagination of the rebel party in Ireland. In France, where his release was regarded as a French diplomatic victory, he was received, in March 1802, as a person of distinction; and when he died on 24 August 1803 in Bordeaux, his funeral &quot;was attended by the whole army in the district and an immense concourse of citizens.&quot; There are suggestions that Tandy&#x27;s remains were later exhumed and returned to Ireland, being buried secretly in an unmarked grave at Castlebellingham Parish Church in County Louth (his niece, Anne Tandy, had married into the Bellingham family). His widow was buried at St. Mary&#x27;s churchyard, Julianstown, County Meath, where an inscription reads: &quot;To the memory of Mrs Ann Tandy, died 25 Dec 1820, widow of James Napper Tandy, Irish Patriot and General French Army. This stone was erected by their son James Napper Tandy whose youthful son was buried here with Thomas Cannon...&quot;.

<text>Eduard Douwes Dekker (2 March 182019 February 1887), better known by his pen name Multatuli (from Latin &quot;multa tulī&quot;, &quot;I have suffered much&quot;), was a Dutch writer best known for his satirical novel &quot;Max Havelaar&quot; (1860), which denounced the abuses of colonialism in the Dutch East Indies (today&#x27;s Indonesia). He is considered one of the Netherlands&#x27; greatest authors.

== Family and education ==

Eduard Douwes Dekker was born in Amsterdam, the fourth of five children of a Mennonite family: the other children were Catharina (1809–1849), Pieter Engel (1812–1861), Jan (1816–1864), and Willem (1823–1840). Their mother, Sietske Eeltjes Klein (sometimes written &quot;Klijn&quot;), was born on Ameland.

Multatuli’s father, Engel Douwes Dekker, worked as a sea captain from the Zaan district of North Holland. Engel inherited the surnames of both his parents, Pieter Douwes and Engeltje Dekker, and Multatuli’s family retained both names. Multatuli’s elder brother, Jan Douwes Dekker (1816–1864), was the grandfather of Ernest Douwes Dekker, a politician of Dutch-Javanese descent.

As an adolescent, Multatuli attended school in Amsterdam, at the Latin school located at the Singel. A precursor of the present day Barlaeus Gymnasium. His father originally intended for Eduard to become a minister, though the idea was later abandoned. Eduard then worked for a time at a textile firm, as a clerk.

== Career in Dutch East Indies ==
=== Natal, Sumatra ===
In 1838, he left on one of his father&#x27;s ships for Batavia (present-day Jakarta) in the Dutch East Indies, where over the next two decades he held a series of colonial government posts. Initially employed in the general accounting department, he was promoted in the following years to administrative officer, although he disliked financial work.

In 1842, he was appointed comptroller of the troubled district of Natal, Noord Sumatra, Dutch East Indies (now part of Indonesia).

In 1843 a 13-year-old girl, Si Oepi Ketch, a member of a Sumatran noble family, was offered to Douwes Dekker. Douwes Dekker later described her as &quot;one of my first loves&quot;. A lock of hair, which Douwes Dekker kept with him all his life, is still kept at the Multatuli Museum. Back then it was very common to match young native women with single Dutch civil servants.

Financial irregularities and a deficit in funds – at least some of which dated to before his time in office – led to a serious reprimand from the governor of Sumatra&#x27;s west coastal region, General Andreas Victor Michiels, and to a temporary suspension. Aggrieved, he wrote a revenge play &quot;De Oneerbare&quot; (The Dishonorable Man), later published as &quot;De bruid daarboven&quot; (The Upstairs Bride). He would later include a version of this episode in his satirical novel &quot;Max Havelaar&quot;.

Although the general was later shown to have been in the wrong in the matter of the reprimand, Douwes Dekker himself acknowledged that he was not well suited to administrative work. He annoyed his colleagues not solely by his errors and delays but by not adhering to the unwritten rules of the local civil service. Eventually, after refunding the deficit out of his own pocket, he was put on temporary leave and then transferred elsewhere.

===Menado, Ambon, and Lebak===
After holding several subordinate government positions in Nanjing in Qing dynasty China and Purworedjo in Java under colonial rule (now part of Indonesia), Douwes Dekker was appointed secretary to the Resident Menado in Noord Celebes (now also part of Indonesia) in 1848. Here his career recovered, at least in part because the Resident, Reinier Scherius, shared his strong sense of fair play towards the indigenous population. On his departure in 1851, Scherius recommended Douwes Dekker as his successor. The government decided otherwise; Multatuli had again amassed a deficit in the official funds and had also run up private debts, a situation that raised suspicions of financial irregularities but was never cleared up. Nonetheless, at the end of 1851 he was promoted up the administrative ladder, being sent to Ambon as Assistant Resident.

After a few months, he went on furlough to the Netherlands for health reasons. From 1852 to May 1855 he was in Holland, where he gambled extensively and accumulated more debt. Despite his later success as a writer, he would be pursued by creditors for most of his adult life.

In 1857 he was appointed Assistant Resident of Lebak, in the Bantam-Kidoel area of Java (now Banten province in Indonesia). By this time, however, he had begun to openly protest against the abuses of the Dutch colonial system and was threatened with dismissal. Instead, he resigned his appointment and returned to the Netherlands.

==Writing career==

Determined to expose the scandals he had witnessed during his years in the Dutch East Indies, Douwes Dekker began to write newspaper articles and pamphlets. Little notice was taken of these early publications until, in 1860, he published his satirical anticolonialist novel &quot;Max Havelaar: The Coffee Auctions of the Dutch Trading Company&quot; under the pseudonym Multatuli. Douwes Dekker&#x27;s pen name is derived from the Latin phrase &quot;multa tuli&quot;, meaning &quot;I have suffered much&quot; (or more literally: &quot;I have borne much&quot;). It refers both to himself and to the victims of the injustices he saw.

Douwes Dekker was accepted in 1854 at the Freemason loge &quot;Concordia Vincit Animos&quot;. The head of this loge was W.J.C. van Hasselt. Multatuli sent his manuscript of Max Havelaar to Van Hasselt, and Van Hasselt sent this manuscript to another Freemason, Jacob van Lennep.

The very first text ever published by Multatuli was &quot;Geloofsbelydenis&quot; (Profession of Faith). It appeared in the Freemason periodical &quot;De Dageraad&quot; (The Dawn) in 1859. In 1865 it was reprinted in &quot;Bloemlezing door Multatuli&quot; by R.C. Meijer, a fellow Freemason in Amsterdam. Already in 1861 the book &quot;Minnebrieven&quot; (Love letters) was published at the same printer/bookseller. Many more books and editions of Dekker were published by R.C. Meijer.

Although Douwes Dekker&#x27;s friend and fellow writer Jacob van Lennep had seen to it that identifiable place names were changed before publication, the book still caused enormous controversy. Apologists for colonialism accused Multatuli of exaggeration, and he was unsuccessfully pressured to withdraw the inflammatory book. Critics claimed it lacked literary merit; nonetheless, &quot;Max Havelaar&quot; was read all over Europe. The poet and critic Carel Vosmaer proved to be an ally, publishing a book (&quot;The Sower&quot;, 1874) praising Multatuli.

Multatuli continued to write prolifically. His misleadingly titled second book, &quot;Minnebrieven&quot; (&quot;Love Letters&quot;, 1861), is actually another mordant satire, this time in the form of a fictitious correspondence. The following year, he began to publish a wide range of miscellaneous writings in a series of uniform volumes called &quot;Ideën&quot; (&quot;Ideas&quot;), of which seven appeared between 1862 and 1877. His semi-autobiographical novel &quot;Woutertje Pieterse&quot; (&quot;Little Walter Pieterse&quot;) was first printed in the &quot;Ideas&quot; series.

Multatuli made several attempts to write for the stage. One of his plays, &quot;Vorstenschool&quot; (&quot;The School for Princes&quot;, published in 1872 in the fourth volume of &quot;Ideën&quot;), expresses his nonconformist views on politics, society, and religion. Out of fear of offending the Dutch king, three years elapse before the play was first staged. The premiere and subsequent tour were a great success, forming one of the highlights of Multatuli&#x27;s career as a writer.

Multatuli stopped writing rather suddenly in 1877. He had moved to Germany about ten years earlier, where he settled in the town of Ingelheim am Rhein near Mainz.

==Marriages==
Multatuli married Everdine Hubertina van Wijnbergen on 10 April 1846. They had two children, their son Edu (born 1854) and their daughter Nonni (born 1857). Multatuli&#x27;s relationship with Edu remained difficult throughout his life.

Multatuli eventually separated from his wife, in large part due to his gambling addiction and related financial problems. She died in 1874 and Multatuli not long afterwards married Maria Hamminck Schepel.

==Legacy==
Multatuli was one of Sigmund Freud&#x27;s favorite writers; his name heads a list of &#x27;ten good books&#x27; that Freud drew up in 1907. Several other writers from different generations were appreciative of Multatuli, like Karl Marx, Anatole France, Willem Elsschot, Hermann Hesse, Thomas Mann, Heinrich Mann as well as Johanna van Gogh, and many first-wave feminists (suffragists).

In June 2002, the Dutch Maatschappij der Nederlandse Letterkunde (Society of Dutch Literature) proclaimed Multatuli the most important Dutch writer of all time.

The annual Multatuli Prize, a Dutch literary prize, is named in his honor. The literary award Woutertje Pieterse Prijs is named after the character &quot;Woutertje Pieterse&quot; in Multatuli&#x27;s &quot;De geschiedenis van Woutertje Pieterse&quot;.

The Multatuli Museum is located in Amsterdam at Korsjespoortsteeg 20, where Eduard Douwes Dekker was born. Another Multatuli Museum was opened on 11 February 2018 in Rangkasbitung, Lebak Regency in the province of Banten, Indonesia. Multatuli was cremated in Gotha. His ashes were later brought to the cemetery and crematorium Westerveld in Driehuis. His wife Tine is buried in the Protestant section of the San Michele cemetery.

An Indonesian Navy command ship was named in honor of Eduard Douwes Dekker.

<text>Vera Ellen Williams (born ), known as Vera Ellen, is a New Zealand musician and winner of both the Taite Music Prize and an Aotearoa Music Award.

== Early life ==
Ellen grew up in Naenae, Lower Hutt, the youngest of four siblings with Polish and Welsh ancestors. She played in bands with her siblings and cousins, then while at high school joined friends in punk band Gaol Bait.

== Career ==
Ellen&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Monte Cassino&quot;, was released online in 2015. &quot;Beat Yr Name&quot;, also self-released, followed in 2018.

===Early bands and emergence as a solo artist===
From 2016 to 2020 she was a member of Maple Syrup, Sweater, and, while she was in the USA studying on exchange to UCLA, Girl Friday. 
In 2019 she supported New Zealand band The Beths on an American tour, during which her postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome affected her balance.

The COVID-19 pandemic brought her back to New Zealand in 2020 and led her to return to solo recording. That year she released two EPs, &quot;World Emotion&quot; and &quot;Songs No-one Should Hear&quot;, and signed to Flying Nun Records. She also began recording songs for her next album, &quot;It&#x27;s Your Birthday&quot;.

She made a short return to the USA in 2021, during which she was short of money and affected by depression. While she was there, Girl Friday recorded new material and toured the west coast. In the same year Ellen was hospitalised after a seizure.

Her third solo album, &quot;It&#x27;s Your Birthday&quot;, recorded in 2020 and released in 2021, won 2022&#x27;s Best Alternative Artist award at the Aotearoa Music Awards. It was also shortlisted for the Taite Music Prize.

===&quot;Ideal Home Noise&quot;===
Vera Ellen wrote &quot;Ideal Home Noise&quot; to be an honest record of her difficulties with her physical and mental health (the song &quot;Broadway Junction&quot; describes suicidal ideation), balanced with “this part of you that really wants to push through, and really wants to see the best in everything and everyone, and in yourself”.

The album which was produced by Ben Lemi and features her brother Albert River was released on 31 March 2023 and went on to win the Taite Music Prize.

On the basis of being shortlisted to play South by Southwest 2024, Ellen arranged a small US tour to begin in March. Days before departure her place at SXSW - &quot;one of those career dreams of mine&quot; - was confirmed. She played in New York and then, on the day of her flight to Austin, joined the artists boycotting the festival in protest against its links with the US defence industry. She still played non-SXSW shows in Austin, including the annual New Zealand Showcase.

At a ceremony in Auckland on 23 April 2024, Ellen was honoured with the Taite Music Prize for &quot;Ideal Home Noise&quot;. The prize included $12,500 cash from Recorded Music NZ. Accepting the award alongside producer and collaborator Ben Lemi, she compared the moment to a fever dream.

===&quot;heartbreak for jetlag&quot;===
In May 2024 she released her fourth solo EP, &quot;heartbreak for jetlag&quot;. Self-recorded in her bedroom, she had initially been unsure whether to share the songs beyond friends.

== Awards ==
* Winner, Best Alternative Artist, 2022 Aotearoa Music Awards (&quot;It&#x27;s Your Birthday&quot;).

<text>Mars 1M was a series of two uncrewed spacecraft which were used in the first Soviet missions to explore Mars. They were the earliest missions of the Mars program. The Western media dubbed the spacecraft &quot;Marsnik&quot;, a portmanteau of &quot;Mars&quot; and &quot;Sputnik&quot;.

== Spacecraft ==
Mars 1M No.1, known in the West as Marsnik 1, Mars 1960A and Korabl 4, was destroyed in a launch failure on October 10, 1960. In 1962, NASA Administrator James E. Webb informed the United States Congress that NASA believed the mission was an attempt at a Mars flyby probe. Some Soviet scientists involved with the program at that time claim no knowledge of this mission, stating that only the second launch was an intended Mars mission. However, V. G. Perminov, the leading designer of planetary spacecraft at the Lavochkin design bureau, states that this mission was indeed intended for Mars and was identical to the later mission.

Mars 1M No.2, known in the West as Marsnik 2, Korabl 5 and Mars 1960B, was launched on October 14, 1960.

Both Mars 1M spacecraft were launched by Molniya rockets. The unproven third stage malfunctioned on both flights as cavitation in the fuel lines prevented the engines from developing adequate thrust, and, as a result, neither spacecraft achieved its initial geocentric parking orbit. Mars 1M No.2 reached an altitude of 120 km before reentry.

Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev had planned to bring models of the Mars probes for showcasing at his visit to the UN that month, but as both launches failed, they remained packed.

==Mission profile==
The objectives of the mission were to investigate interplanetary space between Earth and Mars, to study Mars and return surface images from a flyby trajectory, and to study the effects of extended spaceflight on onboard instruments and provide radio communications from long distances.

==Spacecraft and subsystems==
NASA describes the spacecraft as:
nearly identical to the Venera 1 design, a cylindrical body about 2 meters high with two solar panel wings, a 2.33 meter high-gain net antenna, and a long antenna arm, and had a mass of about 650 kg. It carried a 10 kg science payload consisting of a magnetometer on a boom, cosmic ray counter, plasma-ion trap, a radiometer, a micrometeorite detector, and a spectroreflectometer to study the CH band, a possible indicator of life on Mars. These instruments were mounted on the outside of the spacecraft. A photo-television camera was held in a sealed module in the spacecraft and could take pictures through a viewport when a sensor indicated the Sun-illuminated martian surface was in view.
Attitude was controlled by a Sun-star sensor with attitude correction performed by a dimethylhydrazine/nitric acid bipropellant rocket engine. The spacecraft orientation was to be maintained so that the solar panels faced the Sun throughout the flight. Power was provided by the two-square meter solar panels which charged silver-zinc batteries. Radio communications were made using a decimeter band transmitter via the high gain antenna for spacecraft commands and telemetry. Radio bearing was used to maintain the antennas&#x27; orientation to Earth. Images were to be transferred using an 8-cm wavelength transmitter through the high-gain antenna. A fourth stage was added to the booster, the Molniya (rocket) or 8K78, the new launcher was designated SL-6/A-2-e.

<text>Boeun County (&quot;Boeun-gun&quot;) is a county in North Chungcheong Province, South Korea.

==History==
Boeun ( literally &quot;offering gratitude&quot; or &quot;thanksgiving&quot;), was a South Korean town named in 1406 by a remorseful King Taejong, who felt relieved that he had cleared his conscience after having participated in a ceremonial ritual at the local Beopjusa temple to appease the spirits of his dead younger half-brothers, whose deaths he had caused in a power struggle years earlier.

In July 1973, Boeun township was elevated to the status of Boeun town. 
In 1983, two townships were abolished and incorporated into normal ones. In 2007, Hoebuk-myeon changed its name to Hoein-myeon, Oesongni-myeon to Jangan-myeon, and Naesonngni-myeon into Songnisan-myeonn.

==Festivals==
* Songnisan Fall Festival: During autumn a festival is held at Songnisan, a celebrated mountain in central Korea. The festival has been an important contributor to the development of tourism and the economy in the region.
* Boeun Ocher Apple Festival: Boeun County is well known for its apples, for which a major festival is held to promote them.

==Products==
Jujube is the most well-known agricultural product in Boeun county. Additionally, the county&#x27;s fruit, and eggs are growing in popularity thanks to their eco-friendly mark.

==Climate==
Boeun has a monsoon-influenced humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dwa&quot;) with cold, dry winters and hot, rainy summers.
==Symbols==
* City Flower: Forsythia
* City Tree: Jujube tree
* City Bird: Magpie Birds

==Twin towns – sister cities==
Boeun is twinned with:

* Gwangjin-gu, Seoul
* Clarence-Rockland, Canada

<text>Flint () is a town and community in Flintshire, Wales, lying on the estuary of the River Dee. It is the former county town of Flintshire. According to the 2001 Census, the population of the community of Flint was 12,804, increasing to 12,953 at the 2011 census. The urban area including Holywell and Bagillt had a population of 26,442.

==Geography==
Flint is located in north-east Wales, adjoining the estuary of the River Dee, to the north of the town of Mold. Across the estuary, the Wirral can be seen from Flint and views to the south of the town include Halkyn Mountain. As the crow flies, Flint is located less than 12 miles from the English urban area of Liverpool, and even closer to its metro area. However, the two estuaries in between make the distance travelling on land almost twice as long.

==History==

The name refers to the stony platform on which the castle was built, and was first recorded in 1277 in the French form &quot;le Chaylou&quot; (cf modern French &quot;caillou&quot;, &quot;gravel&quot;).

Edward I began to build Flint Castle in 1277, during his campaign to conquer Wales. Both castle and town were attacked by the forces of Madog ap Llywelyn during the revolt of 1294–95; the defenders of the town burnt it in order to deny its use to the Welsh.

Richard II was handed over to his enemy Henry Bolingbroke in the castle in 1399. As a consequence, it is the setting for Act III, Scene III of the Shakespeare play &quot;Richard II&quot;. The castle was the first of Edward I&#x27;s &#x27;iron ring&#x27; of royal castles to be built in Wales, and the design served as the basis for larger castles such as Harlech Castle and Rhuddlan Castle. Owain Glyndŵr unsuccessfully assaulted it at the commencement of his revolt in 1400.

The town did not have a wall, but a protective earthen and wooden palisaded ditch. The outline of this remained visible in the pattern of streets until the mid-1960s, and the medieval boundary can still be traced now. This can be seen in John Speed&#x27;s map of Flintshire.

Flint Town Hall, the home of Flint Town Council, was erected in 1840. Until 1935 the Constable of Flint Castle served &quot;ex officio&quot; as Mayor of Flint.

In 1969 Flint hosted the National Eisteddfod, and so the town has a circle of Gorsedd stones in the field adjacent to Gwynedd County Primary School. In July 2006 the stones were centre stage in the National Eisteddfod Proclamation Ceremony which formally announced Mold as the 2007 host town of the event. The Urdd National Eisteddfod was held in Flint in 2016.

==Governance==
Flint Town Council consists of 15 councillors who are elected from four wards; 2 from Oakenholt, 3 from Castle and 5 each from Coleshill and Trelawny wards. For elections to Flintshire County Council, three councillors are elected from Flint: Coleshill and Trelawny, and one each from Flint: Castle and Flint: Oakenholt. Flint is part of the Alyn and Deeside constituency and North Wales region for the Senedd, and of the Alyn and Deeside constituency for parliament.

==Culture and demography==
In 2001 only 18% of the local population identified as Welsh, although this census controversially had no &quot;Welsh&quot; tick box.

In the census of 2011, 57.1% stated they had Welsh, or Welsh and other combined, identity. Many people in Flint have some knowledge of the Welsh language, although competence varies. Implementation of the European Union&#x27;s freedom of movement provisions has led to a noticeable increase in the numbers of Polish-language speakers in Flint. Several retail businesses display information in Polish as well as in English and Welsh and the town has a number of &quot;Polskie sklepy&quot; (Polish shops) specialising in Polish products.

The Flint accent is frequently misidentified with that of Liverpool, although it has arisen in fact as a unique blending of the speech patterns of the area&#x27;s Welsh speakers, earlier Irish settlers, and the residents of nearby Cheshire, Wirral, and the wider Merseyside region.

There are several songs associated with Flint. The most widely sung is &quot;The Yard&quot;. Another popular song is &quot;Fifty German bombers over Flint&quot;, which tells the story of a wartime bombing raid over nearby Liverpool that accidentally targeted the town of Flint instead. Verses describe the arrival of the bombers over Flint, and how they were shot down by the &quot;Bagillt Navy&quot;. Eventually, the ill-fated German aircrew were fished out by the &quot;Greenfield Fishers&quot;. The song is often sung in a drunken, friendly manner to the accompaniment of much hand clapping and revelry.

==Transport==
Flint railway station lies on the North Wales Coast Line and is served by Transport for Wales services from Manchester Piccadilly to Llandudno. A north-south service between Cardiff and Holyhead also calls, as do some Avanti West Coast services between London Euston and Holyhead. Bus services are operated by Arriva Buses Wales.

==Education==
The town has three high schools: St Richard Gwyn Catholic High School, Flint High School and Ysgol Maes Hyfryd. Primary schools in Flint include the Gwynedd School, Cornist Park School, Ysgol Croes Atti (Welsh medium), St Mary&#x27;s Catholic Primary School and Ysgol Pen Coch.

==Community==
Flint once had its own low-powered television relay transmitter, designed to provide improved coverage of Welsh channels in an area that would otherwise receive only English television signals. Since 2009, signals have been transmitted digitally from Storeton transmitting station on the Wirral.

Perhaps one of the town&#x27;s most striking images, in addition to the castle, is the group of three tower blocks of flats near the town centre. The first two blocks were built in the 1960s and named Bolingbroke Heights and Richard Heights, with a third, Castle Heights, added shortly afterwards.

Flint&#x27;s football team is Flint Town United. They play in the Cymru Premier, the top division of Welsh football following promotion from the Cymru North in 2023/24. Nicknamed &quot;the Silkmen&quot;, they play their home games at Cae-y-Castell.

Brian Fell&#x27;s sculpture footplate can be seen at Flint railway station. Initially it was thought to be an imitation of the famous Monty Python foot drawn by Terry Gilliam.

The town has a library which was extensively refurbished in 2020, and a leisure centre named the Jade Jones Pavilion to honour the town&#x27;s Olympian. Flint Retail Park was undergoing expansion, The town centre has been the subject of a regeneration scheme which began in 2012. 

A lifeboat station was established in Flint in 1966, operated by the RNLI.

<text>Hans Josef Maria Globke (10 September 1898 – 13 February 1973) was a German administrative lawyer, who worked in the Prussian and Reich Ministry of the Interior in the Reich, during the Weimar Republic and the time of National Socialism. Later he was the Under-Secretary of State and Chief of Staff of the German Chancellery in West Germany from 28 October 1953 to 15 October 1963 under Chancellor Konrad Adenauer. He is the most prominent example of the continuity of the administrative elites between Nazi Germany and the early West Germany.

In 1936, Globke wrote a legal annotation on the antisemitic Nuremberg Race Laws that did not express any objection to the discrimination against Jews, placing the Nazi Party on a firmer legal ground and setting the path to the Holocaust during World War II. By 1938, Globke had been promoted to &quot;Ministerialdirigent&quot; in the Office for Jewish Affairs in the Ministry of the Interior, where he produced the , a law that forced Jewish men to take the middle name &quot;Israel&quot; and Jewish women &quot;Sara&quot; for easier identification. In 1941, during the Nazi period, he issued another statute that stripped Jews in occupied territories of their statehood and possessions. Globke was identified as the author of an interior ministry report from France, written in racist language, that complained of &quot;coloured blood into Europe&quot; and called for the &quot;elimination&quot; of its &quot;influences&quot; on the gene pool.

Globke later had a controversial career as Secretary of State and Chief of Staff of the West German Chancellery. A strident anti-communist, Globke became a powerful &quot;éminence grise&quot; of the West German government, and was widely regarded as one of the most influential public officials in the government of Chancellor Konrad Adenauer. Globke had a major role in shaping the course and structure of the state and West Germany&#x27;s alignment with the United States. He was also an important figure in West Germany&#x27;s anti-communist policies at the domestic and international level and in the Western intelligence community, and was the German government&#x27;s main liaison with NATO and other Western intelligence services, especially the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

== Early life and education ==
Globke was born in Düsseldorf, Rhine Province, the son of the cloth wholesaler Josef Globke and his wife Sophie (née Erberich), both Roman Catholics and supporters of the Centre Party (Deutsche Zentrumspartei). Shortly after Hans&#x27;s birth, the family moved to Aachen, where his father opened a draper&#x27;s shop. When he finished his secondary education at the elite Catholic Kaiser-Karl-Gymnasium and completing his Abitur in 1916, he was drafted, serving until the end of World War I in an artillery unit on the Western Front. After World War I, he studied law and political science at the University of Bonn, University of Cologne and the University of Giessen. In 1921, Globke became a legal trainee when he passed the state examination () at the Higher Regional Court of Cologne. For a year he worked as a trainee in Eschweiler, Cologne and Berlin. In 1922, Globke qualified as a doctor of law (Dr. jur.) at the University of Giessen, with a dissertation titled &quot;The immunity of the members of the Reichstag and the Landtag&quot; (). In the same year, his father died and Globke became the main wage-earner for the family.

While studying, Globke, a practising Catholic, joined the Bonn chapter of the Cartellverband (KdStV), the German Catholic Students&#x27; Federation. His close contacts with fellow KdStV members and his membership from 1922 in the Catholic Centre Party played a significant role in his later political life. Globke finished his &quot;Assessorexamen&quot; in 1924 and briefly served as a judge in the Aachen district court. He became vice police-chief of Aachen in 1925 and governmental civil servant with a rank of &quot;Regierungsassessor&quot; (District Assessor) in 1926.

In 1934, he married Augusta Vaillant, with whom he had two sons and one daughter.

==Ministerial career==
In December 1929, Globke entered the Higher Civil Service at the lowest rank of Government Counciller in the Prussian Ministry of the Interior. There he worked in areas like Standesamt, , demilitarisation of the Rhineland and questions related to the Treaty of Versailles.

Globke was not affected by the personnel purges of the Prussian ministerial bureaucracy by the Franz von Papen government, which removed republican-oriented officials after the coup d&#x27;état in Prussia on 20 July 1932. On the contrary, on 12 August 1932, he was appointed head of the constitutional department in Department I. This department also included the civil status department, which was responsible for regulating name change matters. In October 1932, under Globke&#x27;s leadership, a set of rules, known as the &quot;Ordinance on the Responsibility for Changing Surnames and First Names of 21 November 1932&quot; () were created. The rule made it harder for Germans of Jewish ancestry in Prussia to change their last names to less obviously Jewish names, followed by guidelines for their implementation in December 1932.

This ordinance tied in with the restrictive principles for the treatment of Jewish name changes formulated in the Prussian Ministry of the Interior in 1909 and 1921, but now placed these changes openly in the context of an anti-Jewish attitude. In the circular issued by Globke on naming rights, it was said that every name change impairs &quot;the recognisability of origin from a family&quot;, facilitates &quot;the obscuration of marital status&quot; and conceals &quot;the blood descent&quot;.

This unequal treatment of the Jews in the final phase of the Weimar Republic, in which Globke played a major role, is considered by researchers and in the earlier case law of East Germany to be a precursor to name-related discrimination during the early Nazi era. For the historian and the criminal lawyer , Globke &quot;was therefore one of the pioneers of later racial legislation as early as the Weimar Republic.&quot;

==Career during Nazism==
After the seizure of power by the Nazi Party in early 1933, Globke was involved in the drafting of a series of laws aimed at the co-ordination () of the legal system of Prussia with the Reich. Globke helped to formulate the Enabling Act of 23 March 1933, which effectively gave Adolf Hitler dictatorial powers. He was also the author of the law of 10 July 1933 concerning the dissolution of the existing Prussian State Council and the formation of the revised Council, as well as of further legislation that co-ordinated all Prussian parliamentary bodies.

In December 1933 Globke was promoted to &quot;Oberregierungsrat&quot; (Senior Government Councilor), which Globke later said had been postponed due to his doubts over the legality of the so-called Prussian coup of 1932, which was well known in the Ministry. On 1 November 1934, following the unification of the Prussian Ministry of the Interior with the Reich Ministry of the Interior, Globke took a position as a &quot;Referent&quot; (Consultant) in the newly formed Reich and Prussian Ministry of the Interior under Reich Interior Minister Wilhelm Frick, where he worked until 1945. In July 1938, Globke received his final promotion of the Nazi period, to &quot;Ministerialrat&quot; (Ministerial Councilor).

===Measures to exclude and persecute Jews===

From 1934 onwards, Globke continued to be responsible mainly for name changes and civil status issues; from 1937, international issues in the field of citizenship and option contracts were added to his brief. As a co-supervisor, he also dealt with &quot;general race issues&quot;, immigration and emigration, and matters related to the anti-Semitic &quot;Blood Protection Act&quot; () laws covering sexual relations between Aryans and non-Aryans. He co-authored the official legal commentary on the new Reich Citizenship Law, one of the Nuremberg Laws introduced at the Nazi Party Congress in September 1935, which revoked the citizenship of German Jews, as well as various legal regulations. Globke&#x27;s work also included the elaboration of templates and drafts for laws and ordinances. In this context, he had a leading role in the preparation of the first Ordinance on the Reich&#x27;s civil law (enacted on 14 November 1935), The Law for the Defense of German Blood and Honour (enacted 18 October 1935), and the (enacted on 3 November 1937). The &quot;J&quot; which was imprinted in the passports of Jews was designed by Globke.

Globke was responsible for preparing legal commentaries and explanations for his areas of responsibility. In 1936, together with his superior, State Secretary Wilhelm Stuckart, he published the first commentary on the Nuremberg Laws and their implementing regulations. This proved to be particularly influential for the interpretation of the Nuremberg Laws because it was given an official character. Originally, Globke was only supposed to comment on matrimonial issues as Stuckart wanted to do the rest of the work himself, but Stuckart became ill for a long time, so Globke wrote the commentary on his own. Stuckart ended up only writing the extensive introduction. In this context, Globke&#x27;s later defense lawyers pointed out that he was not to be held responsible for Stuckart&#x27;s racist choice of words and that his commentary on the law interpreted the Nuremberg Laws narrowly in comparison to later comments. In individual cases, especially in the case of so-called mixed marriages, this has proven to be beneficial for those affected.

Globke also authored the (enacted 5 January 1938), the (enacted 17 August 1938), and the associated implementing ordinances. According to the ordinances, Jews who did not bear any of the given names in an attached list were required to add a middle name to their own: &quot;Sara&quot; for women and &quot;Israel&quot; for men. The list of male first names began with Abel, Abiezer, Abimelech, Abner, Absalom, Ahab, Ahaziah, Ahasuerus, and so on. Some of the names on the list were fictitious or selected in a controversial manner. It is unclear whether this was due to an intention to further disparage Jews, or whether they were errors and inaccuracies. Insofar as they were particularly widespread among German Jews at the time, even the names of Christian saints were included on this list, e.g. B. &quot;Isidor&quot;, the name of the theologian Isidor of Seville or Saint Isidor of Madrid, the patron of many southern German village churches. By registering the population regarded as Jewish, Globke created the administrative prerequisites that facilitated to a great extent the rounding up and deportation of Jews during the Holocaust that, began at the end of 1941.

Globke also served as chief legal adviser to the Office for Jewish Affairs in the Ministry of Interior, headed by Adolf Eichmann, that performed the bureaucratic implementation of the Holocaust.

In 1938, Globke was appointed &quot;Ministerialrat&quot; (Ministerial Councilor) for his &quot;extraordinary efforts in drafting the law for the Protection of the German Blood&quot;. On 25 April 1938, Globke was praised by the Reich Interior Minister Wilhelm Frick as &quot;the most capable and efficient official in my ministry&quot; when it came to drafting anti-Semitic laws.

===During the war===
At the beginning of the war, Globke was responsible for the new German imperial borders in the West that were the responsibility of the Reich Ministry of the Interior. He made several trips to the conquered territories. The historian Peter Schöttler suspected that Globke was probably the author of a memorandum to Hitler in June 1940 discussing the idea of State Secretary Stuckart proposing a far-reaching annexation of the East French and Belgian territories, which would have involved the deportation of about 5 million people.

He applied for membership of the Nazi Party for career reasons in 1940, but the application was rejected on 24 October 1940 by Martin Bormann, reportedly because of his former membership of the Centre Party, which had represented Roman Catholic voters in Weimar Germany. Globke was ultimately rejected for membership by Bormann in 1943.

At the beginning of September 1941, Globke accompanied Interior Minister Frick and State Secretary Stuckart on an official visit to Slovakia, which at that time was a client state of the German Reich. Immediately following this visit, the government of Slovakia announced the introduction of the so-called Jewish Code, which provided the legal basis for the later expropriations and deportations of Slovak Jews. In 1961, Globke denied there was any connection between the two events and the allegation that he had participated in the creation of the Code. Clear evidence for it was never verified. According to CIA documents, Globke was possibly also responsible for the deportation of 20,000 Jews from Northern Greece to Nazi extermination camps in Poland.

Globke submitted a final application for Nazi Party membership, but the application was rejected in 1943, again due to his former affiliation to the Centre Party.

On the other hand, Globke maintained contacts with military and civilian resistance groups. He was the informant of the Berlin Bishop Konrad von Preysing and had knowledge of the coup preparations by the opponents of Hitler Carl Friedrich Goerdeler and Ludwig Beck. According to reports by Jakob Kaiser and Otto Lenz, in the event that the attempt to overthrow the National Socialist regime had succeeded, Globke was earmarked for a senior ministerial post in an imperial government formed by Goerdeler. However, no evidence ever emerged to support Globke&#x27;s later assertion that the National Socialists wanted to arrest him in 1945, but were prevented by the advance of the Allies.

==Post-war period==
Immediately after the war, his close friend Herbert Engelsing and friends from the Catholic Church helped to promote Globke to the British, ensuring his political survival. Although the British had doubts, the need for Globke&#x27;s expertise after the war became so great that they were willing to take a chance in employing him in the drafting of election law. Once freed from British obligation on 1 July 1946, he was appointed as the city treasurer in Aachen, a position he held for three years. In August 1946, he was called to testify at the Nuremberg trials. Globke submitted an affidavit to the International Military Tribunal on the annexation of the French territories after the German victory in 1940. The quality and quantity of his testimony, showing he had nothing to hide, helped Globke&#x27;s reputation.

During the process of denazification, Globke stated that he had been part of the resistance against National Socialism, and was therefore classified by the Arbitration Chamber on 8 September 1947 in Category V: Persons Exonerated.

Globke&#x27;s second and last appearance at Nuremberg was in August 1948, when he testified at the Wilhelmstraße trial as both as a witness for both the prosecution and the defence. At trial of his former superior Wilhelm Stuckart, he confirmed that he knew that &quot;Jews were being put to death &quot;en masse&quot;&quot;. He had known at that time that &quot;the extermination of the Jews was systematic&quot;, but, he said, restricting his statement, &quot;not that it referred to all Jews&quot;.

=== Career in the Adenauer government ===

In the post-war era Globke rose to become one of the most powerful people in the German government. On 26 September 1949, Konrad Adenauer &quot;had no reservations whatsoever&quot; in appointing Globke to be one of his closest aides, with his appointment to the position of undersecretary at the German Chancellery, despite protests from the opposition parties in the Bundestag and the Central Intelligence Agency. There were three main reasons for this: firstly as Catholics that shared a common environment in their upbringing in the Rhineland, secondly Adenauer considered him an effective and reliable civil servant and thirdly, Globke was absolutely devoted to Adenauer. The appointment of a Nazi official was in itself not unusual; the historian Gunnar Take, from the Institute of Contemporary History in Munich, established that only three out of 50 officials of the interior ministry who were of working age during the Nazi era had been anti-fascists.

In 1951, he issued a statute that restored back pay, pensions, and advancement to civil servants who had served under the Nazi regime, including himself. John Le Carré wrote that these were &quot;rights as they would have enjoyed if the Second World War hadn&#x27;t taken place, or if Germany had won it. In a word, they would be entitled to whatever promotion would have come their way had their careers proceeded without the inconvenience of an Allied victory&quot;. At the end of October 1953, following Otto Lenz&#x27;s election to the Bundestag in the election of the previous month, Globke succeeded Lenz as Secretary of State at the Federal Chancellery, wielding a great deal of power behind the scenes and therefore an important pillar of Konrad Adenauer&#x27;s &quot;chancellor democracy&quot; ().

===Secretary of state===
Globke served as Secretary of State (&quot;Staatssekretär&quot;) of the Chancellery from 1953 to 1963. As such he was one of the closest aides to Chancellor Adenauer, with significant influence over government policy. He advised Adenauer on political decisions during joint walks in the garden of the Chancellor&#x27;s office, such as the reparations agreement with Israel. His areas of responsibility and his closeness to the Chancellor arguably made him one of the most powerful members of the government; he was responsible for running the Chancellery, recommending the people who were appointed to roles in the government, coordinating the government&#x27;s work, for the establishment and oversight of the West German intelligence service and for all matters of national security. He was the German government&#x27;s main liaison with NATO and other western intelligence services, especially the CIA. He also maintained contact with the party apparatus and became &quot;a kind of hidden secretary general&quot; to the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), and contact with the Chancellor usually had to go through him. As Adenauer and everyone else knew of his previous career, the Chancellor could be assured of his absolute loyalty.

Globke&#x27;s key position as chief of staff to Adenauer, responsible for matters of national security, made both the West German government and CIA officials wary of exposing his past, despite their full knowledge of it. This led, for instance, to the withholding of Adolf Eichmann&#x27;s alias from the Israeli government and Nazi hunters in the late 1950s, and CIA pressure in 1960 on &quot;Life&quot; magazine to delete references to Globke from its recently obtained Eichmann memoirs.

According to CIA documents, in the 1961 election campaign against Willy Brandt (who was later elected Chancellor in 1969), Globke offered Brandt a brazen deal not to make allegations of treason against him resulting from his time in exile, a campaign topic, provided that the SPD would not use Globke&#x27;s Nazi past as an election topic. Globke threatened Brandt with a new campaign against him, initiated by the communists. However, Globke believed that it was in the national interest to stop the campaigns and the continual aspersions about the past would stop the population finding peace. Brandt decided not make Globke&#x27;s Nazi past a campaign issue.

Globke left office together with the Adenauer administration in 1963, and was awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany by President Heinrich Lübke. He remained active as an adviser for Adenauer and the CDU during the 1960s.

===Gehlen organisation===
In 1950, Globke began working with Reinhard Gehlen, who Globke considered a close friend with complementary views. An obsessive anti-communist, Gehlen was a former intelligence officer who had held the rank of lieutenant-general in the &quot;Heer&quot; during World War II. Gehlen was then the director of Foreign Armies East, a military intelligence organisation that operated against the Soviet Union on the Eastern Front. Gehlen had created the Gehlen Organization, known as &quot;The Org&quot;, in 1946 to spy on the Soviet Union, with approval and funding from the CIA.

In April 1956, on orders from Adenauer, Globke established the Federal Intelligence Service (BND, Bundesnachrichtendienst), the successor organisation to the Gehlen Organisation.

==Nazi past==
===Political debate===
The fact that a man like Globke played a leading role in German politics again shortly after the founding of the Federal Republic triggered a bitter parliamentary debate on 12 July 1950 when Adolf Arndt, then the legal spokesman for the Social Democratic Party (SPD), read an excerpt from the commentaries on the Nuremberg Laws in which Globke discusses whether or not &quot;racial defilement&quot; committed abroad could be punished. Federal Interior Minister Gustav Heinemann (CDU) referred in his answer to the exonerating testimony of the Nuremberg prosecutor Robert Kempner, that Globke had served with his willingness to testify.

Although Globke was controversial because of his Nazi past, Adenauer was loyal to Globke until the end of his term in 1963. On one hand, Adenauer commented on the debate over Globke&#x27;s participation in the drafting of the Nuremberg race laws with the words &quot;You don&#x27;t throw away dirty water as long as you don&#x27;t have clean water&quot; (). On the other hand, Adenauer stated in a newspaper interview on 25 March 1956 that the claims that Globke was a willing helper of the Nazis lacked any basis. Many people, including some from the ranks of the Catholic Church, certified that Globke had repeatedly campaigned on behalf of persecuted people.

In the opinion of the journalist Harald Jähner, Globke&#x27;s continued presence led to &quot;disgraceful state measures to prevent criminal prosecution and obstruction of justice&quot; and repeatedly offered the GDR a welcome opportunity to describe the Federal Republic as &quot;fascist&quot;. This was especially true after 1960, when the Israeli intelligence service Mossad tracked Adolf Eichmann down in Argentina; thus, loyalty to Globke increasingly proved to be a burden on Adenauer&#x27;s government. The German Federal Intelligence Service (BND) had known since 1952 that Eichmann was living in Buenos Aires and working at Mercedes-Benz.

Whether Globke knew of Adolf Eichmann&#x27;s whereabouts in Argentina at the end of the 1950s was still the subject of political debate in May 2013 when the parliamentary group Alliance 90/The Greens asked the Bundestag for clarification of their relationship and the Federal Intelligence Service to Eichmann. The Bundestag was unable to answer it.

===West German investigation===
The former administrative officer of Army Group E in Thessaloniki, Max Merten, had accused Globke of being heavily responsible for the Holocaust in Greece, as he could have prevented the deaths of 20,000 Jews in Thessaloniki when Eichmann contacted the Reich Interior Ministry and asked for Globke&#x27;s permission to kill them. When these accusations became known, they prompted preliminary criminal proceedings to be initiated against Globke by Fritz Bauer, the chief public prosecutor of Hesse. The investigation was transferred to the public prosecutor&#x27;s office in Bonn in May 1961 after an intervention by Adenauer, where it was closed due to lack of evidence.

===Trial in East Berlin===
In the early 1960s, there was a vigorous campaign in East Germany, led by the Politburo member Albert Norden of the Ministry of State Security, against the so-called &quot;author of the Nuremberg Blood Laws&quot; as well an &quot;agitator and organiser of the persecutions of the Jews&quot;. Norden&#x27;s goal was to prove that Globke was in contact with Eichmann. In a 1961 memorandum, Norden stated that &quot;in collaboration with Erich Mielke, certain materials should be procured or produced. We definitely need a document that somehow proves Eichmann&#x27;s direct cooperation with Globke&quot;.

In July 1963, the trial, a show trial, was held in the Supreme Court of East Germany which was presided over by . Because an extradition of Globke to the East was unrealistic, the trial was not held with the expectation of holding Globke accountable for his crimes. It nonetheless still had propaganda value in publicizing his role in the Nazi era and in drawing attention to the continuity between the Federal Republic and the Nazi regime, in contrast to the self-styled antifascist image of the Democratic Republic. On 23 July 1963, Globke was sentenced &quot;in absentia&quot;, to life imprisonment &quot;for continued war crimes committed with complicity and crimes against humanity in partial combination with murder&quot;. In the trial and in the extensive reasons for the verdict, the court tried to prove the alleged &quot;similarity of essence of the Bonn regime&quot; with Hitler&#x27;s terror state.

However, such East German trials were not recognised outside of the Soviet bloc, least of all by West Germany. On 10 July 1963, the affair was denounced by the West German government as a show trial. The fact that much of the criticism of Globke came from the Soviet bloc, and that it mixed genuine information with false accusations, made it easier for the West Germans and the Americans to dismiss it as communist propaganda.

==Retirement==
After his retirement, Globke decided to move to Switzerland, where his wife Augusta had bought a property in Chardonne VD on Lake Geneva in 1957 and built a holiday home on it. In autumn 1963, however, the parliament of the canton of Vaud declared him an unwanted foreigner and denied him a residence permit. In 1964, he undertook to &quot;sever all spatial and future connections with Switzerland&quot;. The Swiss Federal President Ludwig von Moos said before the National Council that &quot;in view of this declaration&quot; the government had &quot;refrained from issuing an entry ban&quot;.

==Death==
Globke died after a serious illness at his home on 13 February 1973. He was buried in the central cemetery of Bad Godesberg in Plittersdorf in Bonn.

==Scholarly investigation==

===Bertelsmann===
In 1961 the civil activist wrote, &quot;Hans Globke – File Extracts, documents based on Strecker&#x27;s research in Polish and Czech archives&quot;, which was published by the Bertelsmann affiliate Rütten &amp; Loening. The book consisted of a collection of legal files, images and newspaper reports that had been collected by Strecker from Nazi archives. The collection proved that Globke had helped to draft several anti-semitic laws during the early 1930s, years before Adolf Hitler had come to power and had later become one of Eichmann&#x27;s most important functionaries. During his trial, Eichmann was given the book by his lawyer Robert Servatius and had written 40 pages of commentaries on 15 December 1961 that detailed his relationship to himself and tried to prove that Globke had more authority than he did while downplaying his role. 

Since January 2021, a historical copy of the original edition from Rütten &amp; Loening Verlag, Hamburg, has been available online under the title &quot;Dr. Hans Globke. File extracts, documents. Edited by Reinhard-M. Strecker&quot;. It is part of the new dossier Desk Criminal Globke (Schreibtischtäter Globk), which the internet based open-knowledge charity FragDenStaat published on 22 January 2021. The dossier on the Nazi past of the head of the Chancellery also includes Globke&#x27;s two-volume personnel file as well as his salary file from the Federal Archives, which FragDenStaat says it is making publicly available for the first time.

The naming of Globke by Eichmann was highly undesirable for the West German Government. Globke attempted to block further publication of the book in court with an interim injunction. The BND, under the leadership of Gehlen, spent 50,000 marks trying to take the book off the market. When a court then discovered two minor mistakes (the publisher had caused one of them by abbreviation), it imposed a restraining order and Bertelsmann came to the decision to cancel the new edition of the book. The government is thought by historians to have threatened Bertelsmann by informing them that no official agency would have acquired any book from the publisher again.

===Adolf Eichmann===
In June 2006, it was announced that the Adenauer Government had informed the CIA of the location of Adolf Eichmann in March 1958. However, according to US historian Timothy Naftali, through contacts at the highest level, it had also ensured that the CIA did not use that knowledge. Neither the federal government nor the CIA passed the new information on to the Israeli government. Naftali suggested that Adenauer had wanted to prevent pressure on Globke. When Eichmann was captured and taken to be tried in Israel, made possible by an unofficial tip-off by the Hessian Attorney General Fritz Bauer, Adenauer sent the German-Jewish journalist Rolf Vogel as an emissary, to influence the Eichmann trial in Jerusalem, in one of the most sensitive diplomatic and intelligence operations of West Germany. The fact that Vogel was specially commissioned into the BND provides an indication of the sensitivity of the operation. Vogel met with David Ben-Gurion to present a letter from Adenauer. Ben-Gurion informed Vogel that of the hundred names that Eichmann was queried on, Globke&#x27;s was not mentioned. Vogel immediately returned to Germany and contacted Adenauer to confirm that Globke was in the clear.

Eichmann had previously given extensive interviews on his life to Dutch journalist and former SS agent Willem Sassen, on which his memoirs were to be based. From 1957, Sassen&#x27;s attempts to sell this material to US magazine &quot;Life&quot; had been unsuccessful. This changed with the spectacular kidnapping of Eichmann by Mossad in May 1960 and the preparation of the Eichmann trial in Israel. &quot;Life&quot; published extracts from Sassen&#x27;s material about Eichmann in two articles, on 28 November and 5 December 1960. His family wanted to use the royalties from the articles to fund his defence in court. However the federal government, already worried about the campaign in East Berlin, contacted the CIA to ensure that any material regarding Globke was removed from the &quot;Life&quot; coverage. In an internal memo dated 20 September 1960, CIA chief Allen Dulles mentioned &quot;a vague mention of Globke, which Life omits at our demand&quot;.

In April 2011, the Globke Eichmann Trial affair was again visited when the German weekly news magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; and affiliates published a series of articles on research in the German Intelligence Service that had previously been unpublished. The &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; research examined a memorandum issued on 16 March 1962, that described Gehlen requesting that measures be taken to stop Globke being called as a witness. On 22 March 1962, Eichmann&#x27;s defense attorney Robert Servatius asked for Globke as a witness at the trial but the request was rejected by the court. German defence minister Franz Josef Strauss wrote at the time &quot;The Israelis have prevented extreme incitement against us&quot;. An Israeli government memo from 26 April 1961 states that Gideon Hausner, at the time the Attorney General, had informed ministers of the request and Servatius was asked if Globke was really needed and he thought about it and decided not to call him.

===Globke&#x27;s estate===
In 2009, the historian Erik Lommatzsch published a monograph detailing his investigation of the Globke&#x27;s estate, that is kept in the archive of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation. However, Globke&#x27;s actual relationship to Nazism and his influence on the government of Adenauer are not really clarified, which, according to reviewer Hans-Heinrich Jansen, is not conclusively possible, &quot;in view of the sourcing, which for many central issues, turned out to be slim, after all&quot;. The background of the Stasi campaign against Globke remains largely unknown; however, this aspect of Lommatzsch&#x27;s biography was in any case only intended as a digression, since it requires separate treatment. However, Lommatzsch mentions a number of examples of Globke campaigning for the persecuted, his commentary on the Nuremberg Laws was aimed at defusing the regulations, and he had not played the dominant role in the postwar period the Adenauer opponents had assumed.

===Research into Gehlen organisation===
In 2011, the German historian began research into the Federal Intelligence Service archives, the successor organisation to &quot;The Org&quot;, and concluded that Gehlen, under the cloak of anti-communist activities, had been supplying Globke with briefings on a wide range of domestic German targets. Henke discovered that Gehlen methodically collected intelligence on senior members of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), the Fourth Estate, other intelligence agencies, Nazi victims associations and members of the nobility and the church. In the early years of the German Federal Republic, it was important for Adenauer and Globke to be fully aware of the activities of the opposition. Globke and Gehlen met daily and developed a successful symbiotic relationship, that ensured Adenauer remained in power. According to Henke, the organisation &quot;was able to work, in effect, fully under the radar. And in effect, it was an instrument for keeping a stranglehold on power and a personal tool for Globke&quot;. Globke and Gehlen used the organisation&#x27;s network to have unfriendly journalists removed from their posts, place propaganda in more friendly newspapers, and acquire information that could be used against Globke and Adenauer&#x27;s rivals. In 1960, the organisation provided a briefing to Globke on the SPD politician and future Chancellor of Germany Willy Brandt that stated:

:&quot;This pig has things on his record from his time in the safety of western exile and with the Red Orchestra that could bring him down at any point of our choosing. We&#x27;ve got the material, but we have time, too.&quot;

===Complicit in the system===
The historian Wolfgang Benz judges that Globke was &quot;not a National Socialist and not an anti-Semite&quot;, but &quot;functioned in the interests of the Nazi regime and made himself complicit in the system of persecution of the Jews through competent participation&quot;.

<text>Isaac de Caus (1590–1648) was a French landscaper and architect. He arrived in England in 1612 to carry on the work that his brother Salomon de Caus had left behind. His first known work in England was a grotto that Caus designed in 1623 located in the basement of Inigo Jones&#x27;s Banqueting House. He is noted for his work at Wilton House and Lincoln&#x27;s Inn.

He was the architect in charge of carrying out Inigo Jones&#x27;s design for Covent Garden.

Documented clients include Mary, Countess of Home at her London townhouse in Aldersgate. Surviving buildings include the stables at Wilton House, designed in 1630s closely following an elevation published by Sebastiano Serlio.

<doc id="392184" wikidata="Q936040" url="?curid=392184" title="Yakult">
<text>is a Japanese sweetened probiotic milk beverage fermented with the bacteria strain &quot;Lacticaseibacillus casei&quot; Shirota. It is sold by Yakult Honsha based in Tokyo. The name &quot;Yakult&quot; was coined from , an Esperanto word meaning &quot;yogurt&quot;.

== Ingredients ==
Yakult&#x27;s ingredients are water, skimmed milk, glucose-fructose syrup, sucrose, natural flavors (citrus), and live &quot;Lacticaseibacillus casei&quot; Shirota bacteria. The strain was originally classified as being &quot;Lactobacillus casei&quot;.

Yakult is prepared by adding glucose to skimmed milk and heating the mixture at 90 to 95 °C for about 30 minutes. After letting it cool down to 45 °C, the mixture is inoculated with the lactobacillus and incubated for 6 to 7 days at 37 to 38 °C. After fermentation, water, sugar, gums, and lactic acid are added.

== Health claims ==
In 2006, a panel appointed by the Netherlands Nutrition Center (&quot;Voedingscentrum&quot;) to evaluate a marketing request by Yakult found sufficient evidence to justify claims that drinking at least one bottle of Yakult per day might help improve bowel movements for people who tend to be constipated and might help maintain a healthy population of gut flora.

In 2010, a European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) panel denied a request by the company to market Yakult as defending the upper respiratory tract against pathogens (in other words, protection against diseases like the common cold), finding the claim not supported by the evidence.

In 2013, the UK Advertising Standards Authority disallowed an advertisement for Yakult in response to a complaint. It found that while there was sufficient evidence for the claim that &quot;significant numbers of viable [Lactobacillus] survived transit to the gut [after consumption of Yakult]&quot;, the advertisement had made claims of general health benefits without providing a specific, referenced claim, as required.

== Marketing history==
Yakult was invented in 1935 in Japan by Minoru Shirota, who helped found the company Yakult Honsha for the purpose of commercializing it. Although Yakult is sold in Japan in supermarkets and convenience stores, it is also sold door-to-door in Japan, Asia, and Latin America in convenience stores.

===History===

*In 1930, scientist Minoru Shirota strengthened and cultured the &quot;Lactobacillus casei&quot; Shirota strain
*In 1935, Yakult started being made in Japan.
*In 1955, Yakult Honsha was founded.
*In 1963, Yakult began a home delivery service, using &#x27;Yakult lady&#x27; employees.
*In 1964, Yakult began selling in other countries, beginning with Taiwan.
*In 1968, Yakult opens its first factory outside Japan in the city of São Bernardo do Campo, Brazil.
*In 1969, the Hong Kong Yakult Co Ltd was founded.
*In 1969, Korea Yakult was founded in South Korea.
*In 1981, Yakult ventured into Mexico, opening a factory in the city of Ixtapaluca under the direction of Carlos Kasuga.
*In 1994, Yakult started being sold in Australia, Great Britain, and the United States.
*In 2004, Yakult started being sold in New Zealand, via Australia. Yakult LIGHT was first available in Australia in 2004. In 2017, Yakult reformulated Yakult LIGHT to boast further reductions in sugar and energy content and to use Stevia instead of sugar. 
*In 2014, Yakult opened its first factory in the United States in Fountain Valley, California.

===Relationship with Danone===
In February 2018, it was reported that Danone planned to sell US$1.9 billion of its Yakult investment, reducing its stake from 21% to 7%. The plan was followed by a decline in Yakult&#x27;s share value. Danone had first bought shares in Yakult in April 2000. The sale was completed in March 2018.

===In mass media===
In September 2018, it was reported that the appearance of unlabelled Yakult bottles in the 2018 film &quot;To All the Boys I&#x27;ve Loved Before&quot; led to a rise in the drink&#x27;s sales that coincided with a 2.8% increase in share price following the film&#x27;s release on 17 August.

In January 2020, professional sumo wrestler Takakeishō Takanobu appeared in a television commercial advertising Yakult 1000.

<doc id="392185" wikidata="Q1651323" url="?curid=392185" title="Relay program">
<text>The Relay program consisted of Relay 1 and Relay 2, two early American satellites in elliptical medium Earth orbit. Both were primarily experimental communications satellites funded by NASA and developed by RCA. As of December 2, 2016, both satellites were still in orbit. Relay 1 provided the first American television transmissions across the Pacific Ocean.

==Relay 1 ==
Relay 1 (COSPAR satellite ID: Relay 1 1962-Beta-Upsilon 1 (62BU1)) was launched atop a Delta B rocket (355/D-15) on December 13, 1962, from LC-17A at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. Its payload included radiation experiments designed to map the Earth&#x27;s radiation belts. 

The spin-stabilized satellite had an initial spin rate of 167.3 rpm and an initial spin axis orientation with a declination of -68.3 deg and a right ascension of -56 deg. Its orbital period was 185.09 minutes, with an apogee of 7500  km and a perigee of 1300  km. 

Shortly after launch, two basic problems evolved. One was the satellite&#x27;s response to spurious commands, and the other was the leakage of a high-power regulator. This leakage caused the first two weeks of satellite operation to be useless. After this period, satellite operation returned to normal. The satellite carried one transmitter for tracking and one for telemetry. The telemetry system was PCM at 1152 bit/s. Each 128 words per telemetry frame (of one second duration) used 113 words for the particle experiment. 

Relay 1 was the first satellite to broadcast television from the United States to Japan. The first broadcast during orbit 2677 (1963-11-22, 2027:42-2048 (GMT), or 1:27 pm Dallas time) was to be a prerecorded address from the president of the United States to the Japanese people, but was instead the announcement of the John F. Kennedy assassination. On orbit 2678, this satellite carried a broadcast titled &quot;Record, Life of the Late John F. Kennedy&quot;, the first television program broadcast simultaneously in the U.S. and Japan. In later orbits, NBC transmitted coverage of the funeral procession from the White House to the cathedral. In the three days following the Kennedy assassination, Relay 1 handled a total of 11 spot broadcasts; eight to Europe and three to Japan. All the useful passes of the satellite were made available to permit immediate coverage of the tragic events.

In August 1964, this satellite was used as the United States-Europe link for the broadcast of the 1964 Summer Olympics from Tokyo, after the signal was relayed to the United States via Syncom 3. This marked the first time that two satellites were used in tandem for a television broadcast.

The leakage problem caused the spacecraft to revert to a low voltage state early in 1965. Sporadic transmission occurred until February 10, 1965, after which no usable scientific data was obtained.

==Relay 2 ==

Relay 2 (COSPAR satellite ID: Relay 2 1964-003A) was launched atop a Delta B rocket (373/D-23) on January 21, 1964, from LC-17B at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. Apogee was 7600 and perigee 1870 km. 

It was physically similar to Relay 1. Design changes in this satellite improved its performance so response to spurious commands was essentially eliminated.

NASA ceased operations with Relay 2 on September 26, 1965, with the repurposing of the Mojave Desert Ground Station, the only one in the world equipped to communicate with the satellite, for use with the Applications Technology Satellite program. The final broadcast was of Sen. B. Everett Jordon (D-N.C.) opening the week-long International Exposition of the American Textile Machinery Association in Exposition Hall in Atlantic City.

One of the two onboard transponders operated normally until November 20, 1966. From that time until its failure on January 20, 1967, it required a longer time than normal to come on. The other transponder continued to operate until June 9, 1967, when it too failed to operate normally.

<doc id="392187" wikidata="Q62397" url="?curid=392187" title="Eltham Palace">
<text>Eltham Palace is a large house at Eltham ( ) in southeast London, England, within the Royal Borough of Greenwich. The house consists of the medieval great hall of a former royal residence, to which an Art Deco extension was added in the 1930s. The hammerbeam roof of the great hall is the third-largest of its type in England, and the Art Deco interior of the house has been described as a &quot;masterpiece of modern design&quot;. The house is owned by the Crown Estate and managed by English Heritage, which took over responsibility for the great hall in 1984 and the rest of the site in 1995.

==History==
===1300–1930===
The original palace was given to Edward II in 1305 by the Bishop of Durham, Anthony Bek, and used as a royal residence from the 14th to the 16th century. According to one account, the incident which inspired Edward III&#x27;s foundation of the Order of the Garter took place here. As the favourite palace of Henry IV, it played host to Manuel II Palaiologos, the only Byzantine emperor ever to visit England, from December 1400 to mid-February 1401, with a joust being given in his honour. There is still a jousting tilt yard. The 1401 Eltham tournament was described or commemorated in literary form as thirteen letters, in old French, addressed to Henry&#x27;s daughter Blanche of England. Each letter, purportedly written by a legendary patron, praises one of the combatants. Two of them, William Bardolf and John Clinton, are identified by their heraldry. The letters were probably read aloud during the event.

Edward IV built the Great Hall in the 1470s, and the future Henry VIII grew up here; it was here in 1499 that he met and impressed the scholar Erasmus, introduced to him by Thomas More. Erasmus described the occasion:

Tudor courts often used the palace for their Christmas celebrations. With the grand rebuilding of Greenwich Palace, which was more easily reached by river, Eltham was less frequented, save for the hunting in its enclosed parks, easily reached from Greenwich, &quot;as well enjoyed, the Court lying at Greenwiche, as if it were at this house it self&quot;. The deer remained plentiful in the Great Park, of , the Little, or Middle Park, of , and the Home Park, or Lee Park, of .

The courtier Roger Aston was keeper of the little park at Eltham in 1610 and built four bridges for the convenience of James VI and I. In the 1630s, by which time the palace was no longer used by the royal family, Sir Anthony van Dyck was given the use of a suite of rooms as a country retreat. During the English Civil War, the parks were denuded of trees and deer. John Evelyn saw it 22 April 1656: &quot;Went to see his Majesty&#x27;s house at Eltham; both the palace and chapel in miserable ruins, the noble wood and park destroyed by Rich the rebel&quot;. The palace never recovered. Eltham was bestowed by Charles II on John Shaw and in its ruinous condition— reduced to Edward IV&#x27;s Great Hall, the former buttery, called &quot;Court House&quot;, a bridge across the moat and some walling—remained with Shaw&#x27;s descendants as late as 1893.

The current house was built in the 1930s on the site of the original, and incorporates its Great Hall, which boasts the third-largest hammerbeam roof in England. Fragments of the walls of other buildings remain visible around the gardens, and the 15th-century bridge still crosses the moat.

===1930–present===
In 1933, Stephen Courtauld and his wife Virginia &quot;Ginie&quot; Courtauld (née Peirano) acquired a 99-year lease on the palace site and commissioned Seely &amp; Paget to restore the hall and create a modern home attached to it. Seely and Paget added a minstrel&#x27;s gallery and a timber screen to the hall, while creating a design for the main house inspired by Christopher Wren&#x27;s work at Hampton Court Palace and Trinity College, Cambridge.

The home was decorated internally in the Art Deco style. The entrance hall was created by Swedish designer Rolf Engströmer; light floods in from a glazed dome, highlighting blackbean veneer and figurative marquetry. Other rooms in the house, including the dining room, drawing room and Virginia Courtauld&#x27;s circular bedroom and adjoining bathroom, were the work of the Italian designer Piero Malacrida de Saint-August, while Seely and Paget designed many of the bedrooms. Keen gardeners, the Courtaulds also substantially modified and improved the grounds and gardens.

Stephen was a younger brother of Samuel Courtauld, an industrialist, art collector and founder of the Courtauld Institute of Art. His study in the new house features a statuette version of &quot;The Sentry&quot;, copied from a Manchester war memorial, by Charles Sargeant Jagger, who was - like Stephen - a member of the Artists&#x27; Rifles during the First World War.

The Courtaulds&#x27; pet lemur, Mah-Jongg, had a special room on the upper floor of the house which had a hatch to the downstairs flower room; he had the run of the house. The Courtaulds remained at Eltham until 1944. During the earlier part of the war, Stephen Courtauld was a member of the local Civil Defence Service. In September 1940 he was on duty on the Great Hall roof as a fire watcher when it was badly damaged by German incendiary bombs. In 1944, the Courtauld family moved to Scotland then to Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), giving the palace to the Royal Army Educational Corps in March 1945; the corps then moved all its administration to Eltham Palace in 1948. Following the formation of the Educational and Training Services Branch of the new Adjutant General&#x27;s Corps, staff moved to Worthy Down Camp in Hampshire in 1992.

In 1995, English Heritage assumed management of the palace, and in 1999, completed major repairs and restorations of the interiors and gardens.

<text>Billings Learned Hand ( ; January 27, 1872 – August 18, 1961) was an American jurist, lawyer, and judicial philosopher. He served as a federal trial judge on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York from 1909 to 1924 and as a federal appellate judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit from 1924 to 1961.

Born and raised in Albany, New York, Hand majored in philosophy at Harvard College and graduated with honors from Harvard Law School. After a relatively undistinguished career as a lawyer in Albany and New York City, he was appointed at the age of 37 as a Manhattan federal district judge in 1909. The profession suited his detached and open-minded temperament, and his decisions soon won him a reputation for craftsmanship and authority. Between 1909 and 1914, under the influence of Herbert Croly&#x27;s social theories, Hand supported New Nationalism. He ran unsuccessfully as the Progressive Party&#x27;s candidate for chief judge of the New York Court of Appeals in 1913, but withdrew from active politics shortly afterwards. In 1924, President Calvin Coolidge elevated Hand to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which he went on to lead as the senior circuit judge (later retitled chief judge) from 1939 until his semi-retirement in 1951. Scholars have recognized the Second Circuit under Hand as one of the finest appeals courts in American history. Friends and admirers often lobbied for Hand&#x27;s promotion to the Supreme Court, but circumstances and his political past conspired against his appointment.

Hand possessed a gift for the English language, and his writings are admired as legal literature. He rose to fame outside the legal profession in 1944 during World War II after giving a short address in Central Park that struck a popular chord in its appeal for tolerance. During a period when a hysterical fear of subversion divided the nation, Hand was viewed as a liberal defender of civil liberties. A collection of Hand&#x27;s papers and addresses, published in 1952 as &quot;The Spirit of Liberty&quot;, sold well and won him new admirers. Even after he criticized the civil-rights activism of the Warren Court, Hand retained his popularity.

Hand is also remembered as a pioneer of modern approaches to statutory interpretation. His decisions in specialist fields—such as patents, torts, admiralty law, and antitrust law—set lasting standards for craftsmanship and clarity. On constitutional matters, he was both a political progressive and an advocate of judicial restraint. He believed in the protection of free speech and in bold legislation to address social and economic problems. He argued that the United States Constitution does not empower courts to overrule the legislation of elected bodies, except in extreme circumstances. Instead, he advocated the &quot;combination of toleration and imagination that to me is the epitome of all good government&quot;. Hand had been quoted more often by legal scholars and by the Supreme Court of the United States than any other lower-court judge.

==Early life==
Billings Learned Hand was born on January 27, 1872, in Albany, New York, the second and last child of Samuel Hand (1833–1886) and Lydia Hand (née Learned). His mother&#x27;s family traditionally used surnames as given names; Hand was named for a maternal uncle and a grandfather, both named Billings Peck Learned. The Hands were a prominent family with a tradition of activism in the Democratic Party. Hand grew up in comfortable circumstances. The family had an &quot;almost hereditary&quot; attachment to the legal profession and has been described as &quot;the most distinguished legal family in northern New York&quot;.Samuel Hand was an appellate lawyer, who had risen rapidly through the ranks of an Albany-based law firm in the 1860s and, by age 32, was the firm&#x27;s leading lawyer. In 1878, he became the leader of the appellate bar and argued cases before the New York Court of Appeals in &quot;greater number and importance than those argued by any other lawyer in New York during the same period&quot;. Samuel Hand was a distant, intimidating figure to his son; Learned Hand later described the relationship with his father as &quot;not really intimate&quot;. Samuel Hand died from cancer when Learned was 14. Learned&#x27;s mother thereafter promoted an idealized memory of her husband&#x27;s professional success, intellectual abilities, and parental perfection, placing considerable pressure on her son.

Lydia Hand was an involved and protective mother who had been influenced by a Calvinist aunt as a child; she passed on a strong sense of duty and guilt to her only son. Learned Hand eventually came to understand the influences of his parents as formative. After his father&#x27;s death, he looked to religion to help him cope, writing to his cousin Augustus Noble Hand: &quot;If you could imagine one half the comfort my religion has given to me in this terrible loss, you would see that Christ never forsakes those who cling to him.&quot; The depth of Hand&#x27;s early religious convictions was in sharp contrast to his later agnosticism.

Hand was beset by anxieties and self-doubt throughout his life, including night terrors as a child. He later admitted he was &quot;very undecided, always have been—a very insecure person, very fearful; morbidly fearful&quot;. Especially after his father&#x27;s death, he grew up surrounded by doting women—his mother, his aunt, and his sister Lydia (Lily), eight years his elder. Hand struggled with his name during his childhood and adulthood, worried that &quot;Billings&quot; and &quot;Learned&quot; were not sufficiently masculine. While working as a lawyer in 1899, he ceased using the name &quot;Billings&quot;—calling it &quot;pompous&quot;—and ultimately took on the nickname &quot;B&quot;.
Hand spent two years at a small primary school before transferring at the age of seven to The Albany Academy, which he attended for the next 10 years. He never enjoyed the Academy&#x27;s uninspired teaching or its narrow curriculum, which focused on Ancient Greek and Latin, with few courses in English, history, science, or modern languages. Socially, he considered himself an outsider, rarely enjoying recesses or the school&#x27;s military drills. Vacations, spent in Elizabethtown, New York, were happier times. There, Hand developed a life-long friendship with his cousin and future colleague Augustus Noble Hand, two years his senior. The two were self-confessed &quot;wild boys&quot;, camping and hiking in the woods and hills, where Hand developed a love of nature and the countryside. Many years later, when he was in his 70s, Hand recorded several songs for the Library of Congress that he had learned as a boy from Civil War veterans in Elizabethtown. After his father&#x27;s death, he felt more pressure from his mother to excel academically. He finished near the top of his class and was accepted into Harvard College. His classmates—who opted for schools such as Williams and Yale—thought it as a &quot;stuckup, snobbish school&quot;.

=== Harvard ===
Hand enrolled at Harvard College in 1889, initially focusing on classical studies and mathematics as advised by his late father. At the end of his sophomore year, he changed direction. He embarked on courses in philosophy and economics, studying under the eminent and inspirational philosophers William James, Josiah Royce and George Santayana.

At first, Hand found Harvard a difficult social environment. He was not selected for any of the social clubs that dominated campus life, and he felt this exclusion keenly. He was equally unsuccessful with the Glee Club and the football team; for a time he rowed as a substitute for the rowing club. He later described himself as a &quot;serious boy&quot;, a hard worker who did not smoke, drink, or consort with prostitutes. He mixed more in his sophomore and senior years. He became a member of the Hasty Pudding Club and appeared as a blond-wigged chorus girl in the 1892 student musical. He was also elected president of &quot;The Harvard Advocate&quot;, a student literary magazine.

Hand&#x27;s studious ways resulted in his election to Phi Beta Kappa, an elite society of scholarly students. He graduated with highest honors, was awarded an Artium Magister degree as well as an Artium Baccalaureus degree, and was chosen by his classmates to deliver the Class Day oration at the 1893 commencement. Family tradition and expectation suggested that he would study law after graduation. For a while, he seriously considered post-graduate work in philosophy, but he received no encouragement from his family or philosophy professors. Doubting himself, he &quot;drifted&quot; toward law.

Hand&#x27;s three years at Harvard Law School were intellectually and socially stimulating. In his second year, he moved into a boarding house with a group of fellow law students who were to become close friends. They studied hard and enjoyed discussing philosophy and literature and telling bawdy tales. Hand&#x27;s learned reputation proved less of a hindrance at law school than it had as an undergraduate. He was elected to the Pow-Wow Club, in which law students practiced their skills in moot courts. He was also chosen as an editor of the &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot;, although he resigned in 1894 because it took too much time from his studies.

During the 1890s, Harvard Law School was pioneering the casebook method of teaching introduced by Dean Christopher Langdell. Apart from Langdell, Hand&#x27;s professors included Samuel Williston, John Chipman Gray, and James Barr Ames. Hand preferred those teachers who valued common sense and fairness, and ventured beyond casebook study into the philosophy of law. His favorite professor was James Bradley Thayer, who taught him evidence in his second year and constitutional law in his third. A man of broad interests, Thayer became a major influence on Hand&#x27;s jurisprudence. He emphasized the law&#x27;s historical and human dimensions rather than its certainties and extremes. He stressed the need for courts to exercise judicial restraint in deciding social issues.

==Albany legal practice==

Hand graduated from Harvard Law School with a Bachelor of Laws in 1896 at the age of 24. He returned to Albany to live with his mother and aunt and started work for the law firm in which an uncle, Matthew Hale, was a partner. Hale&#x27;s unexpected death a few months later obliged Hand to move to a new firm, but, by 1899, he had become a partner. He had difficulty attracting his own clients and found the work trivial and dull. Much of his time was spent researching and writing briefs, with few opportunities for the appellate work he preferred. His early courtroom appearances, when they came, were frequently difficult, sapping his fragile self-confidence. He began to fear that he lacked the ability to think on his feet in court.

For two years, Hand tried to succeed as a lawyer by force of will, giving all his time to the practice. By 1900, he was deeply dissatisfied with his progress. For intellectual stimulation, he increasingly looked outside his daily work. He wrote scholarly articles, taught part-time at Albany Law School, and joined a lawyers&#x27; discussion group in New York City. He also developed an interest in politics.

Hand came from a line of loyal Democrats, but in 1898 he voted for Republican Theodore Roosevelt as governor of New York. Though he deplored Roosevelt&#x27;s role in the &quot;militant imperialism&quot; of the Spanish–American War, he approved of the &quot;amorphous mixture of socialism and laisser faire &quot; in Roosevelt&#x27;s campaign speeches. Hand caused further family controversy by registering as a Republican for the presidential election of 1900. Life and work in Albany no longer fulfilled him; he began applying for jobs in New York City, despite family pressure against moving.

==Marriage and New York==
After reaching the age of 30 without developing a serious interest in a woman, Hand thought he was destined for bachelorhood. But, during a 1901 summer holiday in the Québec resort of La Malbaie, he met 25-year-old Frances Fincke, a graduate of Bryn Mawr College. Though indecisive in most matters, he waited only a few weeks before proposing. The more cautious Fincke postponed her answer for almost a year, while Hand wrote to and occasionally saw her. He also began to look more seriously for work in New York City. The next summer, both Hand and Fincke returned to La Malbaie, and at the end of August 1902, they became engaged and kissed for the first time. They married on December 6, 1902, shortly after Hand had accepted a post with the Manhattan law firm of Zabriskie, Burrill &amp; Murray. The couple had three daughters: Mary Deshon (born 1905), Frances (born 1907), and Constance (born 1909). Hand proved an anxious husband and father. He corresponded regularly with his doctor brother-in-law about initial difficulties in conceiving and about his children&#x27;s illnesses. He survived pneumonia in February 1905, taking months to recover.

The family at first spent summers in Mount Kisco, with Hand commuting on the weekends. After 1910, they rented summer homes in Cornish, New Hampshire, a writers&#x27; and artists&#x27; colony with a stimulating social scene. The Hands bought a house there in 1919, which they called &quot;Low Court&quot;. As Cornish was a nine-hour train journey from New York, the couple were separated for long periods. Hand could join the family only for vacations. The Hands became friends of the popular artist Maxfield Parrish, who lived in nearby Plainfield. The Misses Hand posed for some of his paintings.

The Hands also became close friends of Cornish resident Louis Dow, a Dartmouth College professor. Frances Hand spent increasing amounts of time with Dow while her husband was in New York, and tension crept into the marriage. Despite speculation, there is no evidence that she and Dow were lovers. Hand regretted Frances&#x27; long absences and urged her to spend more time with him, but he maintained an enduring friendship with Dow. He blamed himself for a lack of insight into his wife&#x27;s needs in the early years of the marriage, confessing his &quot;blindness and insensibility to what you wanted and to your right to your own ways when they differed from mine&quot;. Fearing he might otherwise lose her altogether, Hand came to accept Frances&#x27; desire to spend time in the country with another man.

While staying in Cornish in 1908, Hand began a close friendship with the political commentator and philosopher Herbert Croly. At the time, Croly was writing his influential book &quot;The Promise of American Life&quot;, in which he advocated a program of democratic and egalitarian reform under a national government with increased powers. When the book was published in November 1909, Hand sent copies to friends and acquaintances, including former president Theodore Roosevelt. Croly&#x27;s ideas had a powerful effect on Roosevelt&#x27;s politics, influencing his advocacy of New Nationalism and the development of Progressivism.

Hand continued to be disappointed in his progress at work. A move to the firm of Gould &amp; Wilkie in January 1904 brought neither the challenges nor the financial rewards for which he had hoped. &quot;I was never any good as a lawyer,&quot; he later admitted. &quot;I didn&#x27;t have any success, any at all.&quot; In 1907, deciding that at the age of 35 success as a Wall Street lawyer was out of reach, he lobbied for a potential new federal judgeship in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, the federal court headquartered in Manhattan. He became involved briefly in local Republican politics to strengthen his political base. In the event, Congress did not create the new judgeship in 1907; but, when the post was finally created in 1909, Hand renewed his candidacy. With the help of the influential Charles C. Burlingham, a senior New York lawyer and close friend, he gained the backing of Attorney General George W. Wickersham, who urged President William Howard Taft to appoint Hand. One of the youngest federal judges ever appointed, Hand took his judicial oath at age 37 in April 1909.

==Federal judge==
Hand served as a United States district judge in the Southern District of New York from 1909 to 1924. He dealt with fields of common law, including torts, contracts, and copyright, and admiralty law. His unfamiliarity with some of these specialties, along with his limited courtroom experience, caused him anxiety at first. Most of Hand&#x27;s early cases concerned bankruptcy issues, which he found tiresome, and patent law, which fascinated him.

Hand made some important decisions in the area of free speech. A frequently cited 1913 decision is &quot;United States v. Kennerley&quot;, an obscenity case concerning Daniel Carson Goodman&#x27;s &quot;Hagar Revelly&quot;, a social-hygiene novel about the &quot;wiles of vice,&quot; which had caught the attention of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice. Hand allowed the case to go forward on the basis of the Hicklin test, which stemmed back to a seminal English decision of 1868, &quot;Regina v. Hicklin&quot;. In his opinion, Hand recommended updating the law, arguing that the obscenity rule should not simply protect the most susceptible readers but should reflect community standards:

It seems hardly likely that we are even to-day so lukewarm in our interest in letters or serious discussion as to be content to reduce our treatment of sex to the standard of a child&#x27;s library in the supposed interest of a salacious few, or that shame will for long prevent us from adequate portrayal of some of the most serious and beautiful sides of human nature.Hand was politically active in the cause of New Nationalism. With reservations, in 1911 he supported Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s return to national politics. He approved of the ex-president&#x27;s plans to legislate on behalf of the underprivileged and to control corporations, as well as of his campaign against the abuse of judicial power. Hand sought to influence Roosevelt&#x27;s views on these subjects, both in person and in print, and wrote articles for Roosevelt&#x27;s magazine, &quot;The Outlook&quot;. His hopes of swaying Roosevelt were often dashed. Roosevelt&#x27;s poor grasp of legal issues particularly exasperated Hand.

Despite overwhelming support for Roosevelt in the primaries and polls, the Republicans renominated the incumbent President Taft. A furious Roosevelt bolted from the party to form the Progressive Party, nicknamed the &quot;Bull Moose&quot; movement. Most Republican progressives followed him, including Hand. The splitting of the Republican vote harmed both Roosevelt&#x27;s and Taft&#x27;s chances of winning the 1912 presidential election. As Hand expected, Roosevelt lost to the Democratic Party&#x27;s Woodrow Wilson, though he polled more votes than Taft.

Hand took the defeat in his stride. He considered the election merely as a first step in a reform campaign for &quot;real national democracy&quot;. Though he had limited his public involvement in the election campaign, he now took part in planning a party structure. He also accepted the Progressive nomination for chief judge of New York Court of Appeals, then an elective position, in September 1913. He refused to campaign, and later admitted that &quot;the thought of harassing the electorate was more than I could bear&quot;. His vow of silence affected his showing, and he received only 13% of the votes. Hand came to regret his candidacy: &quot;I ought to have lain off, as I now view it; I was a judge and a judge has no business to mess into such things.&quot;

By 1916, Hand realized that the Progressive Party had no future, as the liberal policies of the Democratic government were making much of its program redundant. Roosevelt&#x27;s decision not to stand in the 1916 presidential election dealt the party its death blow. Hand had already turned to an alternative political outlet in Herbert Croly&#x27;s &quot;The New Republic&quot;, a liberal magazine which he had helped launch in 1914. Hand wrote a series of unsigned articles for the magazine on issues of social reform and judicial power; his only signed article was &quot;The Hope of the Minimum Wage&quot;, published in November 1916, which called for laws to protect the underprivileged. Often attending staff dinners and meetings, Hand became a close friend of the gifted young editor Walter Lippmann. The outbreak of World War I in 1914 had coincided with the founding of the magazine, whose pages often debated the events in Europe. &quot;The New Republic&quot; adopted a cautiously sympathetic stance towards the Allies, which Hand supported wholeheartedly. After the United States entered the war in 1917, Hand considered leaving the bench to assist the war effort. Several possible war-related positions were suggested to him. Nothing came of them, aside from his chairing a committee on intellectual property law that suggested treaty amendments for the Paris Peace Conference.

Hand made his most memorable decision of the war in 1917 in &quot;Masses Publishing Co. v. Patten&quot;. After the country joined the war, Congress had enacted an Espionage Act that made it a federal crime to hinder the war effort. The first test of the new law came two weeks later when the postmaster of New York City refused to deliver the August issue of &quot;The Masses&quot;, a self-described &quot;revolutionary journal&quot;. The edition contained drawings, cartoons, and articles criticizing the government&#x27;s decision to go to war.

The publishing company sought an injunction to prevent the ban, and the case came before Judge Hand. In July 1917, he ruled that the journal should not be barred from distribution through the mail. Though &quot;The Masses&quot; supported those who refused to serve in the forces, its text did not, in Hand&#x27;s view, tell readers that they &quot;must&quot; violate the law. Hand argued that suspect material should be judged on what he called an &quot;incitement test&quot;: only if its language directly urged readers to violate the law was it seditious—otherwise freedom of speech should be protected. This focus on the words themselves, rather than on their effect, was novel and daring; but Hand&#x27;s decision was promptly stayed, and later overturned on appeal. He always maintained that his ruling had been correct. Between 1918 and 1919, he attempted to convince Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., a man he greatly admired, of his argument. His efforts at first appeared fruitless, but Holmes&#x27; dissenting opinion in &quot;Abrams v. United States&quot; in November 1919 urged greater protection of political speech. Scholars have credited the critiques of Hand, Ernst Freund, Louis Brandeis, and Zechariah Chafee for the change in Holmes&#x27;s views. In the long-term, Hand&#x27;s decision proved a landmark in the history of free speech in the country. In &quot;Brandenburg v. Ohio&quot; (1969), the Supreme Court announced a standard for protecting free speech that in effect recognized his &quot;Masses&quot; opinion as law.

Hand had known that ruling against the government might harm his prospects of promotion. By the time of the case, he was already the most senior judge of his district. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit often summoned him to sit with that court to hear appeals, a task he found stimulating. In 1917, he lobbied for promotion to the Second Circuit, but the unpopularity of his &quot;Masses&quot; decision and his reputation as a liberal stood against him. He was passed over in favor of Martin T. Manton.

In the final months of the war, Hand increasingly supported President Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s post-war foreign policy objectives. He believed the United States should endorse the League of Nations and the Treaty of Versailles, despite their flaws. This position estranged him from Croly and others at &quot;The New Republic&quot;, who vehemently rejected both. Alienated from his old circle on the magazine and by the reactionary and isolationist mood of the country, Hand found himself politically homeless.

==Between the wars==
The next Second Circuit vacancy arose in 1921, but with the conservative Warren G. Harding administration in power, Hand did not put himself forward. Nonetheless, Hand&#x27;s reputation was such that by 1923, Justice Holmes wanted him on the Supreme Court, and in 1924 Harding&#x27;s successor, Calvin Coolidge, appointed Hand to the Second Circuit. It was a sign of Hand&#x27;s increased stature that figures such as Coolidge and Chief Justice William Howard Taft now endorsed him. Coolidge sought to add new blood to a senior judiciary that was seen as corrupt and inefficient. In 1926 and 1927, the Second Circuit was strengthened by the appointments of Thomas Walter Swan and Hand&#x27;s cousin Augustus Noble Hand.

After the demise of the Progressive Party, Hand had withdrawn from party politics. He committed himself to public impartiality, despite his strong views on political issues. He remained a strong supporter of freedom of speech, and any sign of the &quot;merry sport of Red-baiting&quot; troubled him. In 1920, for example, he wrote in support of New York Governor Al Smith&#x27;s veto of the anti-sedition Lusk Bills. The New York Assembly had approved these bills in a move to bar five elected Socialist Party legislators from taking their seats. In 1922, Hand privately objected to a proposed limit on the number of Jewish students admitted to Harvard College. &quot;If we are to have in this country racial divisions like those in Europe,&quot; he wrote, &quot;let us close up shop now&quot;.

In public, Hand discussed issues of democracy, free speech, and toleration only in general terms. This discretion, plus a series of impressive speaking engagements, won him the respect of legal scholars and journalists, and by 1930 he was viewed as a serious candidate for a seat on the Supreme Court. His friend Felix Frankfurter, then a Harvard Law School professor, was among those lobbying hard for Hand&#x27;s appointment. President Herbert Hoover chose to bypass him, possibly for political reasons, and appointed Charles Evans Hughes, who had previously served on the Court for six years before resigning to become the Republican nominee for President in 1916, as Chief Justice. With Hughes and another New Yorker, Harlan Fiske Stone, on the Court, the promotion of a third New Yorker was then seen as impossible.

Hand had voted for Hoover in 1928, and he did so again in 1932; but in 1936, he voted for the Democrats and Franklin D. Roosevelt as a reaction to the economic and social turmoil that followed the Wall Street Crash of 1929. With the Great Depression setting in, Hand favored a policy of interventionist central government. He came to accept Frankfurter&#x27;s view that redistribution of wealth was essential for economic recovery. Hoover resisted this approach, favoring individualism and free enterprise. Roosevelt, on the other hand, promised the voters a New Deal. They elected him on a platform of strong executive leadership and radical economic reform. Hand voted for Roosevelt again in 1940 and 1944, but he remained vigilant on the constitutional dangers of big government. Like others, including Walter Lippmann, he sensed the dictatorial potential of New Deal policies. He had no hesitation in condemning Roosevelt&#x27;s 1937 bill to expand the Supreme Court and pack it with New Dealers.

Hand was increasingly called upon to judge cases arising from the flood of New Deal legislation. The line between central government authority and local legislation particularly tested his powers of judgment. In 1935, the case of &quot;United States v. Schechter&quot; came before the Second Circuit. Hand and his two colleagues had to judge whether a New York poultry firm had contravened New Deal legislation on unfair trade practices. They ruled that the National Industrial Recovery Act did not apply to the Schechter Poultry Corporation, which traded solely within the state. &quot;The line is no doubt in the end arbitrary,&quot; Hand wrote in a memorandum, &quot;but we have got to draw it, because without it Congress can take over all the government.&quot; The Supreme Court later affirmed Hand&#x27;s decision.

Hand became an acknowledged expert on New Deal statutes. He relished the challenge of interpreting such legislation, calling it &quot;an act of creative imagination&quot;. In a 1933 broadcast, he explained the balancing act required of a judge in interpreting statutes:

On the one hand he must not enforce whatever he thinks best; he must leave that to the common will expressed by the government. On the other, he must try as best he can to put into concrete form what that will is, not by slavishly following the words, but by trying honestly to say what was the underlying purpose expressed.

==World War II==

When war broke out in Europe in 1939, Learned Hand adopted an anti-isolationist stance. He rarely spoke out publicly, not only because of his position but because he thought bellicosity unseemly in an old man. In February 1939, he became his court&#x27;s senior circuit leader (in effect, chief judge, although the title was not created until 1948). In this post, Hand succeeded Martin Manton, who had resigned after corruption allegations that later led to Manton&#x27;s criminal conviction for bribery. Not an admirer of Manton, Hand nonetheless testified at his trial that he had never noticed any corrupt behavior in his predecessor. Having sat in two cases in which Manton accepted bribes, Hand worried for years afterward that he should have detected his colleague&#x27;s corruption.

Hand still regarded his main job as judging. As circuit leader, he sought to free himself and his judges from too great an administrative burden. He concentrated on maintaining good relations with his fellow judges and on cleansing the court of patronage appointments. Despite the Manton case and constant friction between two of the court&#x27;s judges, Charles Edward Clark and Jerome Frank, the Second Circuit under Hand earned a reputation as one of the best appeal courts in the country&#x27;s history.

In 1942, Hand&#x27;s friends once again lobbied for him to fill a Supreme Court vacancy, but Roosevelt did not appoint him. The president gave age as the reason, but philosophical differences with Hand may also have played a part. Another explanation lies in one of Justice William O. Douglas&#x27;s autobiographies, where Douglas states that, despite Roosevelt&#x27;s belief that Hand was the best person for the job, Roosevelt had been offended by the pressure Justice Felix Frankfurter placed on the president during a vigorous letter-writing campaign on Hand&#x27;s behalf. D.C. circuit judge Wiley Blount Rutledge, whom Roosevelt appointed, died in 1949, while Hand lived until 1961. In a February 1944 correspondence with Frankfurter, Hand expressed a low opinion of Roosevelt&#x27;s new appointees, referring to Justice Hugo Black, Justice Douglas, and Justice Frank Murphy as &quot;Hillbilly Hugo, Good Old Bill, and Jesus lover of my Soul&quot;. Deeply disappointed at the time, Hand later regretted his ambition: &quot;It was the importance, the power, the trappings of the God damn thing that really drew me on.&quot;

Hand was relieved when the United States entered the war in December 1941. He felt free to participate in organizations and initiatives connected with the war effort, and was particularly committed to programs in support of Greece and Russia. He backed Roosevelt for the 1944 election, partly because he feared a return to isolationism and the prolonging of the wartime erosion of civil liberties. In 1943, the House Un-American Activities Committee or &quot;Dies Committee&quot;, for example, had aroused his fears with an investigation into &quot;subversive activities&quot; by government workers. Hand&#x27;s contemporary at Harvard College, Robert Morss Lovett, was one of those accused, and Hand spoke out on his behalf. As the end of the war approached, there was much talk of international peace organizations and courts to prevent future conflict, but Hand was skeptical. He also condemned the Nuremberg war-crimes trials, which he saw as motivated by vengeance; he did not believe that &quot;aggressive war&quot; could be construed as a crime. &quot;The difference between vengeance and justice,&quot; he wrote later, &quot;is that justice must apply to all.&quot;

Hand had never been well known to the general public, but a short speech he made in 1944 won him fame and a national reputation for learnedness that lasted until the end of his life. On May 21, 1944, he addressed almost one and a half million people in Central Park, New York, at the annual &quot;I Am an American Day&quot; event, where newly naturalized citizens swore the Pledge of Allegiance. He stated that all Americans were immigrants who had come to America in search of liberty. Liberty, he said, was not located in America&#x27;s constitutions, laws, and courts, but in the hearts of the people. In what would become the speech&#x27;s most quoted passage, Hand asked:

What then is the spirit of liberty? I cannot define it; I can only tell you my own faith. The spirit of liberty is the spirit which is not too sure that it is right; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which seeks to understand the minds of other men and women; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which weighs their interests alongside its own without bias; the spirit of liberty remembers that not even a sparrow falls to earth unheeded; the spirit of liberty is the spirit of Him who, near two thousand years ago, taught mankind that lesson it has never learned, but has never quite forgotten; that there may be a kingdom where the least shall be heard and considered side by side with the greatest.

Extracts of the speech appeared in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; on June 10. Several weeks later, &quot;The New York Times&quot; printed the whole text. &quot;Life&quot; magazine and &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; followed soon after. Hand&#x27;s message that liberty is safeguarded by everyday Americans struck a popular chord, and he suddenly found himself a folk hero. Though he enjoyed the acclaim, he thought it unmerited. His biographer Gerald Gunther, noting the paradox of the agnostic Hand&#x27;s use of religious overtones, suggests that the most challenging aspect of the speech was that the spirit of liberty must entertain doubt.

==Postwar years==

Learned Hand&#x27;s 75th birthday in 1947 was much celebrated in the press and in legal circles. C. C. Burlingham, Hand&#x27;s former sponsor, for example, called him &quot;now unquestionably the first among American judges&quot;. Hand remained modest in the face of such acclaim. He continued to work as before, combining his role as presiding judge of the Second Circuit with his engagement in political issues. In 1947, he voiced his opposition to a proposed &quot;group libel&quot; statute that would have banned defamation of racial or minority groups. He argued that such a law would imply that intolerance could base itself upon evidence. The effect of the proposed prosecutions, he said, would be &quot;rather to exacerbate than to assuage the feelings which lie behind the defamation of groups&quot;.

===The Cold War and McCarthyism===

In the postwar period, Hand shared the dismay of his compatriots about Stalinism and the onset of the Cold War. At the same time, he was sensitive to the domestic problems created by what he saw as a hysterical fear of international Communism. Already in 1947, he noted that &quot;the frantic witch hunters are given free rein to set up a sort of Inquisition, detecting heresy wherever non-conformity appears&quot;. He was distressed by the crusade against domestic subversion that had become part of American public life after the war.

Hand particularly despised the anti-Communist campaign of Senator Joseph McCarthy that began in 1950 and which became known as McCarthyism. Though Hand expressed his horror of McCarthyism privately, he hesitated to do so publicly because cases arising from it were likely to come before his court.

====&quot;Coplon&quot;, &quot;Dennis&quot;, and &quot;Remington&quot; cases====
During this period, Hand took part in three cases that posed a particular challenge to his impartiality on Cold War issues: &quot;United States v. Coplon&quot;, &quot;Dennis v. United States&quot;, and &quot;United States v. Remington&quot;.

Department of Justice worker Judith Coplon had been sentenced to 15 years in prison for stealing and attempting to pass on defense information. In 1950, her appeal came before a Second Circuit panel that included Learned Hand. It rested on her claim that her rights under the Fourth Amendment had been infringed by a warrantless search, and that details of illegal wiretaps had not been fully disclosed at trial. Although Hand was unambiguous in his view Coplon had been guilty of the charges against her, he nonetheless rejected the trial judge&#x27;s conclusion that a warrantless arrest had been justified. He ruled therefore that papers seized during the arrest had been inadmissible as evidence. The trial judge&#x27;s failure to disclose all the wiretap records, Hand concluded, necessitated a reversal of Coplon&#x27;s conviction. In his opinion, Hand wrote: &quot;[F]ew weapons in the arsenal of freedom are more useful than the power to compel a government to disclose the evidence on which it seeks to forfeit the liberty of its citizens.&quot; Hand received hate mail after this decision.

Hand&#x27;s position in the 1950 case &quot;Dennis v. United States&quot; contrasted sharply with his &quot;Coplon&quot; opinion. In &quot;Dennis&quot;, Hand affirmed the convictions under the 1940 Smith Act of eleven leaders of the Communist Party of the United States for subversion. He ruled that calls for the violent overthrow of the American government posed enough of a &quot;probable danger&quot; to justify the invasion of free speech. After the ruling, he was attacked from the other political direction for appearing to side with McCarthyism.

In 1953, Hand wrote a scathing dissent from a Second Circuit decision affirming the perjury conviction of William Remington, a government economist accused of Communist sympathies and activities. In 1951, the same panel had originally overturned Remington&#x27;s conviction for perjury. Rather than retrying Remington on their original perjury charges, the government instead brought new perjury charges based on his testimony at the first trial. He was convicted of two charges. In the latter appeal, Hand was outvoted two to one. The prosecution produced stronger evidence against Remington at the second trial, much of it obtained from his wife. Sentenced to three years&#x27; imprisonment, Remington was murdered in November 1954 by two fellow inmates, who beat him over the head with a brick wrapped in a sock. According to Hand&#x27;s biographer Gunther, &quot;The image of Remington being bludgeoned to death in prison haunted Hand for the rest of his life.&quot;

====Public opposition to McCarthyism====
Only after stepping down from his position as a full-time judge in 1951 did Hand join the public debate on McCarthyism. Shortly after his semi-retirement, he gave an unscripted speech that was published in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, an anti-McCarthy newspaper. Hand wrote:

[M]y friends, will you not agree that any society which begins to be doubtful of itself; in which one man looks at another and says: &quot;He may be a traitor,&quot; in which that spirit has disappeared which says: &quot;I will not accept that, I will not believe that—I will demand proof. I will not say of my brother that he may be a traitor,&quot; but I will say, &quot;Produce what you have. I will judge it fairly, and if he is, he shall pay the penalties; but I will not take it on rumor. I will not take it on hearsay. I will remember that what has brought us up from savagery is a loyalty to truth, and truth cannot emerge unless it is subjected to the utmost scrutiny&quot;—will you not agree that a society that has lost sight of that, cannot survive?

Hand followed this up with an address to the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York the next year. Once again, his attack on McCarthyism won approval from many liberals. Asked to send a copy of his views to McCarthy, Hand replied that he had Richard Nixon in mind as well. Despite his concerns about Nixon as vice president, Hand voted for Dwight Eisenhower in the 1952 election and later credited Eisenhower with bringing about McCarthy&#x27;s downfall in 1954.

==Semi-retirement and death==

In 1951, Hand retired from &quot;regular active service&quot; as a federal judge. He assumed senior status, a form of semi-retirement, and continued to sit on the bench, with a considerable workload. The following year, he published &quot;The Spirit of Liberty&quot;, a collection of papers and addresses that neither he nor publisher Alfred A. Knopf expected to make a profit. In fact, the book earned admiring reviews, sold well, and made Hand more widely known. A 1958 paperback edition sold even better, though Hand always refused royalties from material he never intended for publication.

Louis Dow had died in 1944, with Frances Hand at his side. The Hands&#x27; marriage then entered its final, happiest phase, in which they rediscovered their first love. He was convinced that his wife had rescued him from a life as a &quot;melancholic, a failure [because] I should have thought myself so, and probably single and hopelessly hypochondriac&quot;.

Former law clerks have provided intimate details of Hand&#x27;s character during the last decade of his life. Legal philosopher Ronald Dworkin recalls that Hand, scrupulous about the public economy, used to turn out the lights in all the offices at the end of each day. For the same reason, he refused Dworkin the customary month&#x27;s paid vacation at the end of his service. Shortly afterward, to Dworkin&#x27;s surprise, Hand wrote him a personal check for an extra month&#x27;s pay as a wedding present. Hand was known for his explosive temper. Gunther remembers him throwing a paperweight in his direction which narrowly missed. Hand had a habit of turning his seat 180° on lawyers whose arguments annoyed him, and he could be bitingly sarcastic. In a typical memo, he wrote, &quot;This is the most miserable of cases, but we must dispose of it as though it had been presented by actual lawyers.&quot; Despite such outbursts, Hand was deeply insecure throughout his life, as he fully recognized. In his 80s, he still fretted about his rejection by the elite social clubs at Harvard College.

Learned Hand remained in good physical and mental condition for most of the last decade of his life. In 1958, he gave the Holmes Lectures at Harvard Law School. These lectures proved to be Hand&#x27;s last major critique of judicial activism, a position he had first taken up in 1908 with his attack on the &quot;Lochner&quot; ruling. They included a controversial attack on the Warren Court&#x27;s 1954 decision in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, which in Hand&#x27;s opinion had exceeded its powers by overruling Jim Crow segregation laws. His views were widely criticized as reactionary and unfortunate, with most deploring the fact that they might encourage segregationists who opposed libertarian judicial rulings. Published as &quot;The Bill of Rights&quot;, the lectures nevertheless became a national bestseller.

&quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; author J. D. Salinger became a neighbor in Cornish, New Hampshire, in 1953, and Hand became Salinger&#x27;s best and almost only friend as Salinger become more and more reclusive.

By 1958, Hand was suffering from intense pain in his back and faced difficulty in walking. &quot;I can just manage, with not infrequent pauses, to walk about a third of a mile,&quot; he wrote to Felix Frankfurter. &quot;My feet get very numb and my back painful. The truth is that 86 is too long.&quot; Soon, he was obliged to use crutches, but he remained mentally sharp and continued to hear cases. In 1960, he worked briefly on President Dwight Eisenhower&#x27;s &quot;Commission on National Goals&quot;, but he resigned because &quot;it involved more work than in the present state of my health I care to add to the judicial work that I am still trying to do&quot;.

By June 1961, Hand was in a wheelchair. He joked that he felt idle because he had taken part in no more than about 25 cases that year, and that he would start another job if he could find one. The following month, he suffered a heart attack at Cornish. He was taken to St Luke&#x27;s Hospital in New York City, where he died peacefully on August 18, 1961. &quot;The New York Times&quot; ran a front-page obituary. &quot;The Times&quot; of London wrote: &quot;There are many who will feel that with the death of Learned Hand the golden age of the American judiciary has come to an end.&quot;

He was buried next to his wife in the family plot at Albany Rural Cemetery near Menands, New York.

==Philosophy==
Hand&#x27;s study of philosophy at Harvard left a lasting imprint on his thought. As a student, he lost his faith in God, and from that point on he became a skeptic. Hand&#x27;s view of the world has been identified as relativistic; in the words of scholar Kathryn Griffith, &quot;[i]t was his devotion to a concept of relative values that prompted him to question opinions of the Supreme Court which appeared to place one value absolutely above the others, whether the value was that of individual freedom or equality or the protection of young people from obscene literature.&quot; Hand instead sought objective standards in constitutional law, most famously in obscenity and civil liberties cases. He saw the Constitution and the law as compromises to resolve conflicting interests, possessing no moral force of their own. This denial that any divine or natural rights are embodied in the Constitution led Hand to a positivistic view of the Bill of Rights. In this approach, provisions of the Constitution, such as freedom of press, freedom of speech, and equal protection, should be interpreted through their wording and in the light of historical analysis rather than as &quot;guides on concrete occasions&quot;. For Hand, moral values were a product of their times and a matter of taste.

Hand&#x27;s civil instincts were at odds with the duty of a judge to stay aloof from politics. As a judge he respected even bad laws; as a member of society he felt free to question the decisions behind legislation. In his opinion, members of a democratic society should be involved in legislative decision-making. He therefore regarded toleration as a prerequisite of civil liberty. In practice, this even meant that those who wish to promote ideas repugnant to the majority should be free to do so, within broad limits.

Hand&#x27;s skepticism extended to his political philosophy, once describing himself as &quot;a conservative among liberals, and a liberal among conservatives&quot;. As early as 1898, he rejected his family&#x27;s Jeffersonian Democratic tradition. His thoughts on liberty, collected in &quot;The Spirit of Liberty&quot; (1952), began by recalling the political philosophies of Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton. Jefferson believed that each individual has a right to freedom, and that government, though necessary, threatens that freedom. In contrast, Hamilton argued that freedom depends on government: too much freedom leads to anarchy and the tyranny of the mob. Hand, who believed, following Thomas Hobbes, that the rule of law is the only alternative to the rule of brutality, leaned towards Hamilton. Since the freedom granted to the American pioneers was no longer feasible, he accepted that individual liberty should be moderated by society&#x27;s norms. He nevertheless saw the liberty to create and to choose as vital to peoples&#x27; humanity and entitled to legal protection. He assumed the goal of human beings to be the &quot;good life&quot;, defined as each individual chooses.

Between 1910 and 1916, Hand tried to translate his political philosophy into political action. Having read Croly&#x27;s &quot;The Promise of American Life&quot; and its anti-Jeffersonian plea for government intervention in economic and social issues, he joined the Progressive Party. He discovered that party politicking was incompatible not only with his role as a judge but with his philosophical objectivity. The pragmatic philosophy Hand had imbibed from William James at Harvard required each issue to be individually judged on its merits, without partiality. In contrast, political action required partisanship and a choice between values. After 1916, Hand preferred to retreat from party politics into a detached skepticism. His belief in central planning resurfaced during the 1930s in his growing approval of Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal, as he once again—though this time as an observer—endorsed a program of government intervention. Hand was also an interventionist on foreign policy, supporting U.S. involvement in both world wars, and disdained isolationism.

==Jurisprudence==

Hand has been called one of the United States&#x27; most significant judicial philosophers. A leading advocate of judicial restraint, he took seriously Alexander Hamilton&#x27;s formulation that &quot;the judiciary ... may truly be said to have neither &quot;force&quot; nor &quot;will&quot;, but merely judgement.&quot; Any judicial ruling that had the effect of legislating from the bench troubled Hand. In 1908, in his article &quot;Due Process of Law and the Eight-Hour Day&quot;, he attacked the 1905 Supreme Court ruling in &quot;Lochner v. New York&quot;, which had struck down a law prohibiting bakery staff from working more than ten hours a day. The Supreme Court went on to strike down a series of similar worker-protective laws on the grounds that they restricted freedom of contract. Hand regarded this principle as undemocratic. &quot;For the state to intervene&quot;, he argued, &quot;to make more just and equal the relative strategic advantages of the two parties to the contract, of whom one is under the pressure of absolute want, while the other is not, is as proper a legislative function as that it should neutralize the relative advantages arising from fraudulent cunning or from superior force.&quot;

The issue concerned Hand again during the New Deal period, when the Supreme Court repeatedly overturned or blocked Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s legislation. As an instinctive democrat, Hand was appalled that an elected government should have its laws struck down in this way. He viewed it as a judicial &quot;usurpation&quot; for the Supreme Court to assume the role of a third chamber in these cases. As far as he was concerned, the Constitution already provided a full set of checks and balances on legislation. Nevertheless, Hand did not hesitate to condemn Roosevelt&#x27;s frustrated attempt to pack the Supreme Court in 1937, which led commentators to warn of totalitarianism. The answer, for Hand, lay in the separation of powers: courts should be independent and act on the legislation of elected governments.

Hand&#x27;s democratic respect for legislation meant that he hardly ever struck down a law. Whenever his decisions went against the government, he based them only on the boundaries of law in particular cases. He adhered to the doctrine of presumptive validity, which assumes that legislators know what they are doing when they pass a law. Even when a law was uncongenial to him, or when it seemed contradictory, Hand set himself to interpret the legislative intent. Sometimes he was obliged to draw the line between federal and state laws, as in &quot;United States v. Schechter Poultry&quot;. In this important case, he ruled that a New Deal law on working conditions did not apply to a New York poultry firm that conducted its business only within the state. Hand wrote in his opinion: &quot;It is always a serious thing to declare any act of Congress unconstitutional, and especially in a case where it is part of a comprehensive plan for the rehabilitation of the nation as a whole. With the wisdom of that plan we have nothing whatever to do ...&quot;
Hand also occasionally went against the government in the area of free speech. He believed that courts should protect the right to free speech even against the majority will. In Hand&#x27;s view, judges must remain detached at times when public opinion is hostile to minorities and governments issue laws to repress those minorities. Hand was the first judge to rule on a case arising from the Espionage Act of 1917, which sought to silence opposition to the war effort. In his decision on &quot;Masses Publishing Co. v. Patten&quot;, he defined his position on political incitement:

Detestation of existing policies is easily transformed into forcible resistance of the authority which puts them in execution, and it would be folly to disregard the causal relation between the two. Yet to assimilate agitation, legitimate as such, with direct incitement to violent resistance, is to disregard the tolerance of all methods of political agitation which in normal times is a safeguard for free government. The distinction is not scholastic subterfuge, but a hard-bought acquisition in the fight for freedom.

In the case of &quot;United States v. Dennis&quot; in 1950, Hand made a ruling that appeared to contradict his &quot;Masses&quot; decision. By then, a series of precedents had intervened, often based on Oliver Wendell Holmes&#x27;s &quot;clear and present danger&quot; test, leaving him less room for maneuver. Hand felt he had &quot;no choice&quot; but to agree that threats against the government by a group of Communists were illegal under the repressive Smith Act of 1940. In order to do so, he interpreted the &quot;clear and present danger&quot; in a new way. &quot;In each case,&quot; he wrote, &quot;[courts] must ask whether the gravity of the &#x27;evil&#x27;, discounted by its improbability, justifies such invasion of free speech as is necessary to avoid the danger.&quot; This formula allowed more scope for curbing free speech in cases where, as the government believed with Communism, the danger was grave, whether it was immediate or not. Critics and disappointed liberals accused Hand of placing his concern for judicial restraint ahead of freedom of speech. Hand confided to a friend that, if it had been up to him, he would &quot;never have prosecuted those birds&quot;.

In the opinion of Kathryn Griffith, &quot;The importance of Learned Hand&#x27;s philosophy in terms of practical application to the courts lies generally in his view of the pragmatic origin of all law, but most specifically in his unique interpretation of the Bill of Rights.&quot; Hand proposed that the Bill of Rights was not law at all but a set of &quot;admonitory&quot; principles to ensure the fair exercise of constitutional powers. He therefore opposed the use of its &quot;due process of law&quot; clauses as a pretext for national intervention in state legislation. He even advocated the removal of those clauses from the Constitution. In Hand&#x27;s analysis, &quot;due process&quot; is no more than a stock phrase to cover a long tradition of common law procedure. He contended that the term had inflated in scope beyond the meaning intended in the Bill of Rights. The result was the misuse of due process to invade rights that the Constitution was designed to protect. For Hand, a law passed by an elected body should be presumed to meet the test of due process. A court that decides otherwise and strikes down such a law is acting undemocratically. Hand maintained this stance even when the Supreme Court struck down anti-liberal laws that he detested. His reasoning has never been widely accepted. Critics of his position included his colleague on the Second Circuit, Jerome Frank, who wrote: &quot;[I]t seems to me that here, most uncharacteristically, Judge Hand indulges in a judgement far too sweeping, one which rests on a too-sharp either-or, all or nothing, dichotomy. ... Obviously the courts cannot do the whole job. But just as obviously, they can sometimes help to arrest evil popular trends at their inception.&quot;

Richard Posner, an influential appellate judge reviewing a biography of Hand, asserts that Hand &quot;displayed a positive antipathy toward constitutional law. To exaggerate only a little, he didn&#x27;t think judges should have anything to do with it.&quot; Posner suggests that although Hand is remembered today as one of the three greatest judges in American history, his status as a truly &quot;great judge&quot; was not based on his &quot;slight&quot; contributions to First Amendment jurisprudence or other fields of constitutional law, but rather on his decisions in other areas such as antitrust, intellectual property, and tort law.

==Influence==

Hand authored approximately 4,000 judicial opinions during his career. Admired for their clarity and analytic precision, they have been quoted more often in Supreme Court opinions and by legal scholars than those of any other lower-court judge. Both Hand&#x27;s dissent in &quot;United States v. Kennerley&quot; and his ruling in &quot;United States v. Levine&quot; have often been cited in obscenity cases. Hand&#x27;s view that literary works should be judged as a whole and in relation to their intended readership is now accepted in American law. His use of historical data to gauge legislative intent has become a widespread practice. According to Archibald Cox: &quot;The opinions of Judge Hand have had significant influence both in breaking down the restrictions imposed by the dry literalism of conservative tradition and in showing how to use with sympathetic understanding the information afforded by the legislative and administrative processes.&quot; Hand&#x27;s decision in the 1917 &quot;Masses&quot; case influenced Zechariah Chafee&#x27;s widely read book, &quot;Freedom of Speech&quot; (1920). In his dedication, Chafee wrote, &quot;[Hand] during the turmoil of war courageously maintained the traditions of English-speaking freedom and gave it new clearness and strength for the wiser years to come.&quot;

Learned Hand played a key role in the interpretation of new federal crime laws in the period following the passing of the U.S. Criminal Code in 1909. In a series of judicial opinions and speeches, he opposed excessive concern for criminal defendants, and wrote &quot;Our dangers do not lie in too little tenderness to the accused. Our procedure has always been haunted by the ghost of the innocent man convicted. ... What we need to fear is the archaic formalism and watery sentiment that obstructs, delays and defeats the prosecution of crime.&quot; He insisted that harmless trial errors should not automatically lead to a reversal on appeal. Hand balanced these views with important decisions to protect a defendant&#x27;s constitutional rights concerning unreasonable searches, forced confessions and cumulative sentences.

His opinions have also proved lasting in fields of commercial law. Law students studying torts often encounter Hand&#x27;s 1947 decision for &quot;United States v. Carroll Towing Co.&quot;, which gave a formula for determining liability in cases of negligence. Hand&#x27;s interpretations of complex Internal Revenue Codes, which he called &quot;a thicket of verbiage&quot;, have been used as guides in the gray area between individual and corporate taxes. In an opinion sometimes seen as condoning tax avoidance, Hand stated in 1947 that &quot;there is nothing sinister in so arranging one&#x27;s affairs as to keep taxes as low as possible&quot;. He was referring to reporting of individual income through corporate tax forms for legitimate business reasons. In tax decisions, as in all statutory cases, Hand studied the intent of the original legislation. His opinions became a valuable guide to tax administrators. Hand&#x27;s landmark decision in &quot;United States v. Aluminum Company of America&quot; in 1945 influenced the development of antitrust law. His decisions in patent, copyright, and admiralty cases have contributed to the development of law in those fields.

Hand was also a founding member of the American Law Institute, where he helped develop the influential Restatements of the Law serving as models for refining and improving state codes in various fields. One American Law Institute recommendation was to decriminalize sexual conduct such as adultery and homosexuality, for which reason the July–August 1955 issue of the Mattachine Society Review, the magazine of the country&#x27;s first nationwide homosexual organization, published a salute to Judge Hand featuring his photograph on the cover.

After Hand&#x27;s lectures and publications became widely known, his influence reached courts throughout the country. On the occasion of his 75th birthday on January 27, 1947, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported: &quot;He has won recognition as a judges&#x27; judge. His opinions command respect wherever our law extends, not because of his standing in the judicial hierarchy, but because of the clarity of thought and the cogency of reasoning that shape them.&quot;

To the wider public, who knew little of his legal work, Hand was by then a folk hero. Social scientist Marvin Schick has pointed out that this mythic status is a paradox. Because Hand never served on the Supreme Court, the majority of his cases were routine and his judgments rooted in precedent. On Hand&#x27;s retirement in 1951, Felix Frankfurter predicted that his &quot;actual decisions will be all deader than the Dodo before long, as at least many of them are already&quot;. Working for a lower court, however, saved Hand from the taint of political influence that often hung over the Supreme Court. Hand&#x27;s eloquence as a writer played a larger part in the spread of his influence than the substance of his decisions; and Schick believes that the Hand myth brushes over contradictions in his legal philosophy. Hand&#x27;s reputation as a libertarian obscures the fact that he was cautious as a judge. Though a liberal, he argued for judicial restraint in interpreting the Constitution, and regarded the advancement of civil liberties as a task for the legislature, not the courts. In his 1958 Holmes Lectures, for example, he voiced doubts about the constitutionality of the Warren Court&#x27;s civil rights rulings. This philosophy of judicial restraint failed to influence the decisions of the Supreme Court during Hand&#x27;s lifetime and afterwards.

Finally, in an essay called &quot;Origin of a Hero&quot; discussing his novel the &quot;Rector of Justin&quot;, author Louis Auchincloss says the main character was not based on a headmaster—certainly not, as was often speculated, Groton&#x27;s famous Endicott Peabody. &quot;If you want to disguise a real life character,&quot; Auchincloss advised fellow novelists, &quot;just change his profession.&quot; His actual model for the Rector of Justin was &quot;the greatest man it has been my good luck to know&quot;—Judge Learned Hand.

<doc id="392192" wikidata="Q160730" url="?curid=392192" title="Medusa">
<text>In Greek mythology, Medusa (; ), also called Gorgo () or the Gorgon, was one of the three Gorgons. Medusa is generally described as a woman with living snakes in place of hair; her appearance was so hideous that anyone who looked upon her was turned to stone. Medusa and her Gorgon sisters Euryale and Stheno were usually described as daughters of Phorcys and Ceto; of the three, only Medusa was mortal.

Medusa was beheaded by the Greek hero Perseus, who then used her head, which retained its ability to turn onlookers to stone, as a weapon until he gave it to the goddess Athena to place on her shield. In classical antiquity, the image of the head of Medusa appeared in the evil-averting device known as the &quot;Gorgoneion&quot;.

According to Hesiod and Aeschylus, she lived and died on Sarpedon, somewhere near Cisthene. The 2nd-century BC novelist Dionysios Skytobrachion puts her somewhere in Libya, where Herodotus had said the Berbers originated her myth as part of their religion.

==Mythology==
The three Gorgons—Medusa, Stheno, and Euryale—were described by Hesiod and Apollodorus as offspring of the sea-god Phorcys and his sister Ceto; according to Hyginus, however, their parents were &quot;Gorgon&quot; and Ceto. Their genealogy is shared with other sisters, the Graeae, as in Aeschylus&#x27;s &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot;, which places both trios of sisters far off &quot;on Kisthene&#x27;s dreadful plain&quot;:

Near them their sisters three, the Gorgons, winged
With snakes for hair—hatred of mortal man

In most versions of the story, Medusa was beheaded by the hero Perseus, who was sent to fetch her head by King Polydectes of Seriphus because Polydectes wanted to marry Perseus&#x27;s mother. The gods were well aware of this, and Perseus received help. He received a mirrored shield from Athena, sandals with gold wings from Hermes, a sword from Hephaestus and Hades&#x27;s helm of invisibility. Since Medusa was the only one of the three Gorgons who was mortal, Perseus was able to slay her; he did so while looking at the reflection from the mirrored shield he received from Athena. During that time, Medusa was pregnant by Poseidon. When Perseus beheaded her, Pegasus, a winged horse, and Chrysaor, a giant wielding a golden sword, sprang from her body.

Jane Ellen Harrison argues that &quot;her potency only begins when her head is severed, and that potency resides in the head; she is in a word a mask with a body later appended... the basis of the Gorgoneion is a cultus object, a ritual mask misunderstood.&quot; In the &quot;Odyssey&quot; xi, Homer does not specifically mention the Gorgon Medusa:

Lest for my daring Persephone the dread,
From Hades should send up an awful monster&#x27;s grisly head.

Harrison&#x27;s translation states that &quot;the Gorgon was made out of the terror, not the terror out of the Gorgon.&quot;

According to Ovid, in northwest Africa, Perseus flew past the Titan Atlas, who stood holding the sky aloft, and transformed Atlas into a stone when Atlas tried to attack him. In a similar manner, the corals of the Red Sea were said to have been formed of Medusa&#x27;s blood spilled onto seaweed when Perseus laid down the petrifying head beside the shore during his short stay in Ethiopia where he saved and wed his future wife, the lovely princess Andromeda, who was the most beautiful woman in the world at that time. Furthermore, the venomous vipers of the Sahara, in the &quot;Argonautica&quot; 4.1515, Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; 4.770 and Lucan&#x27;s &quot;Pharsalia&quot; 9.820, were said to have grown from spilt drops of her blood. The blood of Medusa also spawned the Amphisbaena (a horned dragon-like creature with a snake-headed tail).

Perseus then flew to Seriphos, where his mother was being forced into marriage with the king, Polydectes, who was turned into stone by the head. Then Perseus gave the Gorgon&#x27;s head to Athena, who placed it on her shield, the Aegis.

While ancient Greek vase-painters and relief carvers imagined Medusa and her sisters as having monstrous form, sculptors and vase-painters of the fifth century BC began to envisage her as being beautiful as well as terrifying. In an ode written in 490 BC, Pindar already speaks of &quot;fair-cheeked Medusa&quot;.

In a late version of the Medusa myth, by the Roman poet Ovid, Medusa was originally a beautiful maiden, but when Neptune (the Roman equivalent of the Greek Poseidon) mated with her in Minerva&#x27;s temple (Minerva being the Roman equivalent of the Greek Athena), Minerva punished Medusa by transforming her beautiful hair into horrible snakes. Although no earlier versions mention this, ancient depictions of Medusa as a beautiful maiden instead of a horrid monster predate Ovid. In classical Greek art, the depiction of Medusa shifted from hideous beast to an attractive young woman, both aggressor and victim, a tragic figure in her death. The earliest of those depictions comes courtesy of Polygnotus, who drew Medusa as a comely woman sleeping peacefully as Perseus beheads her. As the act of killing a beautiful maiden in her sleep is rather unheroic, it is not clear whether those vases are meant to elicit sympathy for Medusa&#x27;s fate, or to mock the traditional hero.

Some classical references refer to three Gorgons; Harrison considered that the tripling of Medusa into a trio of sisters was a secondary feature in the myth:

Several early classics scholars interpreted the myth of Medusa as a quasi-historical – &quot;based on or reconstructed from an event, custom, style, etc., in the past&quot;, or &quot;sublimated&quot; memory of an actual invasion.

According to Joseph Campbell:

===Psychoanalysis===
In 1940, Sigmund Freud&#x27;s &quot;Das Medusenhaupt (Medusa&#x27;s Head)&quot; was published posthumously. In Freud&#x27;s interpretation: &quot;To decapitate = to castrate. The terror of Medusa is thus a terror of castration that is linked to the sight of something. Numerous analyses have made us familiar with the occasion for this: it occurs when a boy, who has hitherto been unwilling to believe the threat of castration, catches sight of the female genitals, probably those of an adult, surrounded by hair, and essentially those of his mother.&quot; In this perspective the &quot;ravishingly beautiful&quot; Medusa (see above) is the mother remembered in innocence; before the mythic truth of castration dawns on the subject. Classic Medusa, in contrast, is an Oedipal/libidinous symptom. Looking at the forbidden mother (in her hair-covered genitals, so to speak) stiffens the subject in illicit desire and freezes him in terror of the Father&#x27;s retribution. There are no recorded instances of Medusa turning a woman to stone.

Archetypal literary criticism continues to find psychoanalysis useful. Beth Seelig chooses to interpret Medusa&#x27;s punishment as resulting from rape rather than the common interpretation of having willingly consented in Athena&#x27;s temple, as an outcome of the goddess&#x27; unresolved conflicts with her own father Zeus.

===Feminism===

In the 20th century, feminists reassessed Medusa&#x27;s appearances in literature and in modern culture, including the use of Medusa as a logo by fashion company Versace. The name &quot;Medusa&quot; itself is often used in ways not directly connected to the mythological figure but to suggest the gorgon&#x27;s abilities or to connote malevolence; despite her claimed origins as a beauty, the name in common usage &quot;came to mean monster.&quot; The book &quot;Female Rage: Unlocking Its Secrets, Claiming Its Power&quot; by Mary Valentis and Anne Devane notes that &quot;When we asked women what female rage looks like to them, it was always Medusa, the snaky-haired monster of myth, who came to mind ... In one interview after another we were told that Medusa is &#x27;the most horrific woman in the world&#x27; ... [though] none of the women we interviewed could remember the details of the myth.&quot;

Medusa&#x27;s visage has since been adopted by many women as a symbol of female rage; one of the first publications to express this idea was a feminist journal called &quot;Women: A Journal of Liberation&quot; in their issue one, volume six for 1978. The cover featured the image of the Gorgon Medusa by Froggi Lupton, which the editors on the inside cover explained &quot;can be a map to guide us through our terrors, through the depths of our anger into the sources of our power as women.&quot;

In issue three, Fall 1986 for the magazine &quot;Woman of Power&quot; an article called &quot;Gorgons: A Face for Contemporary Women&#x27;s Rage,&quot; appeared, written by Emily Erwin Culpepper, who wrote that &quot;The Amazon Gorgon face is female fury personified. The Gorgon/Medusa image has been rapidly adopted by large numbers of feminists who recognize her as one face of our own rage.&quot; Griselda Pollock analyses the passage from horrorism to compassion in the figure of the Medusa through Adriana Cavarero&#x27;s philosophy and Bracha Ettinger&#x27;s art and Matrixial theory.

Elana Dykewomon&#x27;s 1976 collection of lesbian stories and poems, &quot;They Will Know Me by My Teeth&quot;, features a drawing of a Gorgon on its cover. Its purpose was to act as a guardian for female power, keeping the book solely in the hands of women. Stephen Wilk, author of &quot;Medusa: Solving the Mystery of the Gorgon&quot;, questioned Medusa&#x27;s enduring status among the feminist movement. He believes that one reason for her longevity may be her role as a protector, fearsome and enraged. &quot;Only the Gorgon has the savage, threatening appearance to serve as an immediately recognized symbol of rage and a protector of women&#x27;s secrets,&quot; wrote Wilk.

Even in contemporary pop culture, Medusa has become largely synonymous with feminine rage. Through many of her iterations, Medusa pushes back against a story that seeks to place the male, Perseus, at its center, blameless and heroic. Author Sibylle Baumbach described Medusa as a &quot;multimodal image of intoxication, petrifaction, and luring attractiveness&quot;, citing her seductive contemporary representation, as well as her dimensionality, as the reason for her longevity.

Elizabeth Johnston&#x27;s November 2016 Atlantic essay called Medusa the original &#x27;Nasty Woman.&#x27; Johnston goes on to say that as Medusa has been repeatedly compared to Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential election, she proves her merit as an icon, finding relevance even in modern politics. &quot;Medusa has since haunted Western imagination, materializing whenever male authority feels threatened by female agency,&quot; writes Johnston. Beyond that, Medusa&#x27;s story is, Johnston argues, a rape narrative. A story of victim blaming, one that she says sounds all too familiar in a current American context.

The Medusa story has also been interpreted in contemporary art as a classic case of rape-victim blaming, by the goddess Athena. Inspired by the #metoo movement, contemporary figurative artist Judy Takács returns Medusa&#x27;s beauty along with a hashtag stigmata in her portrait, #Me(dusa)too.

Feminist theorist Hélène Cixous famously tackled the myth in her essay &quot;The Laugh of the Medusa.&quot; She argues that men&#x27;s retelling of the narrative turned Medusa into a monster because they feared female desire. &quot;The Laugh of the Medusa&quot; is largely a call to arms, urging women to reclaim their identity through writing as she rejects the patriarchal society of Western culture. Cixous calls writing &quot;an act which will not only &#x27;realize&#x27; the decensored relation of woman to her sexuality, to her womanly being, giving her access to her native strength; it will give her back her goods, her pleasures, her organs, her immense bodily territories which have been kept under seal.&quot; She claims &quot;we must kill the false woman who is preventing the live one from breathing. Inscribe the breath of the whole woman.&quot; Cixous wants to destroy the phallogocentric system, and to empower women&#x27;s bodies and language. &quot;You only have to look at the Medusa straight on to see her,&quot; writes Cixous. &quot;And she&#x27;s not deadly. She&#x27;s beautiful and she&#x27;s laughing.&quot;

===Nihilism===
Medusa has sometimes appeared as representing notions of scientific determinism and nihilism, especially in contrast with romantic idealism. In this interpretation of Medusa, attempts to avoid looking into her eyes represent avoiding the ostensibly depressing reality that the universe is meaningless. Jack London uses Medusa in this way in his novel &quot;The Mutiny of the Elsinore&quot;:

==Art==

Medusa has been depicted in several works of art, including:

* &quot;Perseus beheading the sleeping Medusa&quot;, obverse of a terracotta pelike (jar) attributed to Polygnotos (vase painter) (c. 450–440 BC), collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art
* Medusa on the breastplate of Alexander the Great, as depicted in the Alexander Mosaic from Pompeii&#x27;s House of the Faun (c. 200 BC)
* Medusa column bases of Basilica Cistern in Constantinople.
*The &quot;Rondanini Medusa&quot;, a Roman copy of the &quot;Gorgoneion&quot; on the aegis of Athena; later used as a model for the Gorgon&#x27;s head in Antonio Canova&#x27;s marble &quot;Perseus with the Head of Medusa&quot; (1798–1801)
*&quot;Medusa&quot; (oil on canvas) by Leonardo da Vinci
*&quot;Perseus with the Head of Medusa&quot; (bronze sculpture) by Benvenuto Cellini (1554)
*&quot;Perseus and Medusa&quot; – bronze statue by Hubert Gerhard (c. 1590)
*&quot;Medusa&quot; (oil on canvas) by Caravaggio (1597)
*&quot;Head of Medusa&quot;, by Peter Paul Rubens (1618)
*&quot;Medusa&quot; (marble bust) by Gianlorenzo Bernini (1630s)
*Medusa is played by a countertenor in Jean-Baptiste Lully and Philippe Quinault&#x27;s opera, &quot;Persée&quot; (1682). She sings the aria &quot;J&#x27;ay perdu la beauté qui me rendit si vaine&quot; (&quot;I have lost the beauty that made me so vain&quot;).
*&quot;Perseus Turning Phineus and his Followers to Stone&quot; (oil on canvas) by Luca Giordano (early 1680s).
*&quot;Perseus with the Head of Medusa&quot; (marble sculpture) by Antonio Canova (1801)
*&quot;Medusa&quot; (1854), marble sculpture by Harriet Hosmer, collection of the Detroit Institute of Art
*&quot;Medusa&quot; (oil on canvas) by Arnold Böcklin (c. 1878)
*&quot;Perseus&quot; (bronze sculpture) by Salvador Dalí
*Medusa sculpture by Luciano Garbati, which portrays her clutching the severed head of Perseus (2008)

Medusa remained a common theme in art in the nineteenth century, when her myth was retold in Thomas Bulfinch&#x27;s &quot;Mythology&quot;. Edward Burne-Jones&#x27; Perseus Cycle of paintings and a drawing by Aubrey Beardsley gave way to the twentieth-century works of Paul Klee, John Singer Sargent, Pablo Picasso, Pierre et Gilles, and Auguste Rodin&#x27;s bronze sculpture &quot;The Gates of Hell&quot;.

===Flags and emblems===
The head of Medusa is featured on some regional symbols. One example is that of the flag and emblem of Sicily, together with the three-legged &quot;trinacria&quot;. The inclusion of Medusa in the center implies the protection of the goddess Athena, who wore the Gorgon&#x27;s likeness on her aegis, as said above. Another example is the coat of arms of Dohalice village in the Czech Republic.

<text>Medusa (Medusalith Amaquelin-Boltagon) is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #36 (1965).

Her name and aspects of the character are derived from Greek mythology, as her hair has prehensile attributes like that of the mythological Medusa&#x27;s hair. The character has psychokinetic control over her hair, a power she obtained through Terrigenesis. With this power, she can extend her hair to double its normal length, using it to pick locks, lift objects, and contain objects and people. She is the queen of the Inhumans, is wife of the king Black Bolt and mother of Ahura.

Serinda Swan primarily portrayed Medusa in the 2017 Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) television series &quot;Inhumans&quot;.

==Publication history==
Medusa first appeared in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #36 (1965) and was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. She appears first in a flashback, then in costume as part of the fledgling &quot;Frightful Four&quot;. She appears in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #38, 41-48 and in various subplot glimpses from #49-62. The Inhumans also appear in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; # 82–83, with Medusa. The Inhumans are granted their first new adventure in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; Annual #5, and a solo series in the split-book &quot;Amazing Adventures&quot; #1-10. The first four installments are written and drawn by Jack Kirby. The second four installments are written by Roy Thomas and illustrated by Neal Adams. That storyline flows into the ongoing &quot;Kree-Skrull War&quot; in &quot;The Avengers&quot; title #94-97.

Medusa also appeared prominently in the twelve part maxi-series &quot;The Inhumans&quot; written by Paul Jenkins and illustrated by Jae Lee in the 1990s.

Medusa appears in &quot;FF&quot; by Matt Fraction and Mike Allred, which debuted in November 2012.

Beginning in May 2015, Medusa appeared as one of the main characters in &quot;A-Force&quot;, an all-female Avengers spin-off being launched by G. Willow Wilson, Marguerite Bennett, and Jorge Molina during Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Secret Wars&quot; crossover.

In 2017, Medusa appeared in an early adventure with the Frightful Four, published as &quot;The Avengers&quot; 1.1- 5.1. This five-issue mini-series is positioned between &quot;The Avengers&quot; #16 and #17 as a side story when the evil team thinks they have killed the Fantastic Four (in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #38), but no one knows it. The Frightful Four publicly attack Captain America and his new team of replacements after their press conference to earn some &quot;street cred&quot;. They are defeated in a rematch in issue 4.1. Medusa presumably flees before the team&#x27;s final cameo in 5.1, where they are preparing a grave for her as a &quot;traitor&quot;.

==Fictional character biography==
Medusa canonically belongs to the race of Inhumans, a species of prehistoric earthlings mutated by the Terrigen Mists which originate from deep under the Inhuman city-state of Attilan (which is located in the oxygen-rich Blue Area of the Moon). Medusa has a younger sister named Crystal, who later became the wife of the Avenger Quicksilver. Considered a member of Attilan&#x27;s Royal Family, Medusa&#x27;s parents chose to expose her to the Terrigen Mists, a natural mutagen that changes the biological makeup of the Inhuman race and gives them powers, when she was a child.

During her adolescent years, Medusa would often visit her distant cousin Black Bolt in his isolation cell, and learned to communicate with him through body language due to his destructive powers. Over the course of these visits, the two fell in love and eventually became engaged. Medusa attended Black Bolt&#x27;s release from his cell when she was eighteen, and witnessed the first confrontation between Black Bolt and his brother Maximus the Mad.

Maximus claimed to be in love with Medusa, and throughout the comics made frequent attempts to usurp both the throne of Attilan and steal Medusa from Black Bolt. In Maximus&#x27; first successful attempt to take the throne, Medusa was knocked off of a sky-sled by Triton and afflicted with amnesia. Under the effects of this illness, Medusa left Attilan and wandered across Europe as a thief.

While still suffering from the effects of her injury, Medusa joined the super-villain team the Frightful Four and battled the Fantastic Four on three separate occasions.

She was then pursued by Gorgon on behalf of Maximus. Eventually, Medusa regained her senses and rejoined forces with the Inhumans Royal Family on the run. She was reunited with Black Bolt, who had been searching for her, and returned to Attilan. However, she became trapped in Attilan by the &quot;negative zone&quot; barrier created by Maximus. She was freed from the barrier at great cost by Black Bolt, and left the Great Refuge to visit the outside world as an adventurer. It was some time before the disastrous effects of worldly pollution on the Inhumans were known. She fights Spider-Man in his title for an issue after being manipulated by the manufacturer/promoter of a line of shampoo products. She also has been re-abducted by the Frightful Four in an attempt to manipulate her. The Fantastic Four became friends and allies and aided the Inhumans on several occasions, such as during the frequent power struggles between Black Bolt and the deranged Maximus.

Medusa has joined the Fantastic Four as a full team member for brief periods. She became a temporary replacement for Susan Richards, known as the Invisible Girl at that time, when Richards went on family leave to care for her comatose son Franklin Richards. Through her relations with the Fantastic Four, Medusa and Black Bolt have sought to achieve an understanding and peace between the races of Earth and Attilan. Nevertheless, the Inhumans have been forced to relocate their home of Attilan several times due to continued human hostility.

Black Bolt would eventually become the king of the Inhumans upon the death of his parents. Medusa oversaw the moving of Attilan to the Blue Area of the Moon. Alongside the Inhuman Royal Family, she battled the Avengers under Maximus&#x27;s mind control. Medusa and Black Bolt were then married and Medusa was made queen, becoming both royal consort and royal interpreter.

When Medusa became pregnant, Attilan&#x27;s Genetics Council argued that the pregnancy should be terminated due to the possibility of the child inheriting Maximus&#x27; insanity coupled with Black Bolt&#x27;s immense and destructive power. Medusa defied the council and fled to Earth to avoid the compulsory abortion and live anonymously in the desert until the child was born, a son named Ahura.

Black Bolt reconciled with Medusa and the pair returned to Attilan and turned their infant son over to the Genetics Council. Following these events, Ahura was not mentioned or seen in the Marvel Universe for several years.

Later, alongside the Inhumans and the original X-Factor, she battled Apocalypse. Alongside the Inhumans and Avengers, she also battled the Brethren.

===Royalty===
Medusa&#x27;s primary role among the Inhumans is as interpreter for her liege and husband, the silent but commanding Black Bolt. As such she is an experienced state figure within the quasi-feudal system of the Inhumans&#x27; government, and is used to speaking with awareness of regal issues of protocol and comportment. This imperial attitude is usually tempered by her strong sense of morality and fairness.

Medusa is featured in the six issue series &quot;Beyond!&quot;. In the book she is kidnapped along with other famous and infamous superhumans to the artificial planet known as Battleworld. Medusa witnessed Venom&#x27;s killing of the Space Phantom disguised as Spider-Man, leading her to believe the real Spider-Man had been murdered. Medusa passes royal judgement that Venom must undergo fifty lashes. She supersedes the authority of the Avenger&#x27;s representative, Janet Van Dyne, and uses the control over her hair to create a whipping motion so fast that it produces miniature sonic booms, which Venom is especially vulnerable to. While Hank Pym tries to dissuade Medusa from continuing the punishment, Venom is able to stab Medusa through the thigh. Later on in the issue, Medusa saves the team during the sudden crash landing of their space vessel by absorbing the majority of the impact with her hair. As stated by Wasp, Medusa is the team&#x27;s primary short-range offense. Eventually the team triumphs over the Beyonder and returns to Earth. At the end of the series, Medusa can be seen alongside Black Bolt attending the funeral of her &quot;Beyond!&quot; teammate Gravity. She gives Gravity&#x27;s parents a precious statue, the highest honor amongst the Inhumans, in commemoration of Gravity&#x27;s sacrifice.

In &quot;I Heart Marvel&quot;, Medusa stars and narrates in a one-shot vignette appearing in issue #3 of the &quot;Marvel Ai&quot; edition. Titled &quot;Silence of the Heart&quot;, the story explores the relationship between Medusa and Black Bolt. Medusa explains that her husband&#x27;s silence is a burden that she also bears. Black Bolt makes an appearance at this point and the two are shown to make love as Medusa contemplates her longing to hear a moan, whisper, or laugh from him.

The title &quot;Son of M&quot; focuses on Pietro Maximoff following the events of &quot;House of M&quot;. After attempting to commit suicide, a dying Pietro is brought to Attilan by Crystal. While Gorgon protests, Medusa grants Pietro asylum in Attilan until he is fully recovered. Once healed, a depowered Pietro tries to convince Black Bolt and Medusa to allow him access to the Terrigen Mists, but Medusa firmly states that Terrigenesis is a process forbidden to outsiders and that such a process upon a human could result in drastic mutations. Pietro manages to expose himself to the Mists regardless, and receives new powers before collecting both the Terrigen Crystals and his daughter, Luna, and returning to Earth. The crystals eventually end up in the possession of a black-ops sector of the United States government. The sector&#x27;s subsequent refusal to return the crystals sparks a declaration of war between the Inhumans and the United States.

During this title it is made reference that Black Bolt and Medusa are childless. Upon discovery that Luna has been taken to Earth by Pietro, Medusa advises Crystal that perhaps it is right that Pietro should spend time with his daughter. Crystal remarks that if Medusa had children of her own she might be able to understand how she felt over the matter. It is not apparent whether this is an example of Ahura&#x27;s existence being retconned from the Marvel Universe, or if this is meant to be a sarcastic comment in reference to Ahura&#x27;s supposed confinement.

The events of &quot;Silent War&quot; immediately follow the events of &quot;Son of M&quot;. The Silent War series reveals a growing rift between Medusa and Black Bolt as the two disagree on his decision to declare war against the United States for failing to relinquish the Terrigen Crystals. Medusa finds herself no longer able to interpret her husband&#x27;s wishes as she used to. While Medusa is issuing Black Bolt&#x27;s war declarations to the Inhumans council he becomes frustrated and snaps his fingers to silence her, indicating that she wasn&#x27;t relating what he intended. Medusa later confides to Black Bolt that he had never treated her that way before, as if she were a dog, and Black Bolt responds apologetically.

Their son, Ahura, also reappears in this series as a mentally unstable adolescent. Medusa argues that Black Bolt seems not to care that their son is being kept in isolation, and advises him that despite his orders she has gone to visit Ahura in his cell on more than one occasion. Black Bolt is angered by this and becomes physically aggressive with Medusa, grabbing her face and mouth to silence her. In her growing confusion with her husband&#x27;s actions, Medusa finds herself drawn to Maximus against her will and would visit him often in his prison cell. It is revealed by Luna, Crystal&#x27;s daughter, that Maximus had somehow implanted a &quot;darkness&quot; into Medusa&#x27;s mind that was affecting her actions. Later on, Medusa and Maximus share a kiss as a distraught Black Bolt watches from the shadows. Medusa&#x27;s thoughts at the time, however, reveal that she is not in control of her actions and that she only loves Black Bolt. The end of Silent War is left a cliffhanger with Black Bolt confined in prison, Ahura released, and Medusa now at Maximus&#x27; side as he assumes the throne of the Inhumans.

Due to inconsistencies with other Marvel titles featuring Black Bolt during this time, it is unclear when, and if, &quot;Silent War&quot; takes place in relation to The Illuminati, World War Hulk, and Secret Invasion storylines.

Medusa appears alongside Black Bolt in issue #1 of the &quot;World War Hulk&quot; series. Medusa is seen with Black Bolt when Hulk attacks Attilan. She warns Hulk not to pursue a fight with her husband, as Black Bolt has defeated Hulk in past battles. The fight begins and Medusa is not shown to interfere or assist. Black Bolt is subsequently defeated by Hulk, though the battle is not shown beyond Black Bolt&#x27;s opening attack, and it is made unclear as to how Hulk managed to win the fight.

It was revealed in &quot;New Avengers: Illuminati&quot; that Black Bolt had been replaced by a Skrull impostor for an unknown amount of time. The impostor revealed himself to the Illuminati and was killed. Both the sudden rift between Medusa and Black Bolt apparent in &quot;Silent War&quot; and Black Bolt&#x27;s later defeat at the hands of Hulk in &quot;World War Hulk&quot; could be attributed to this development, for it is uncertain just when Black Bolt might have been replaced by his Skrull duplicate.

When the &quot;Secret Invasion&quot; begins, the Inhumans part of the story, by &quot;Heroes&quot; writer Joe Pokaski, digs into how the Inhuman Royal Family deals with the news that the Black Bolt they knew was a Skrull impostor. Medusa is shown fighting a Skrull that not only possesses her powers, but also possesses the powers of Mister Fantastic. Medusa heads into Kree space to get Ronan the Accuser to help look for the Skrull ship containing Black Bolt and her son. She succeeds in rescuing her family and returning to Attilan.

During the &quot;War of Kings&quot; storyline, Medusa was with the Inhumans when they went into space and forged an alliance with the Kree and was also there when Havok, Lilandra Neramani, and the rest of Havok&#x27;s Starjammers requested asylum from Vulcan and his forces. When Maximus speaks out, Medusa pushes him aside. After Ronan is wounded in battle with Vulcan&#x27;s forces, Medusa states to the Shi&#x27;ar that they had made a big mistake and vows that they will pay for this. Medusa sends a broadcast on Black Bolt&#x27;s behalf and tells the citizens of the Kree Empire that they have suffered an unprovoked assault by the forces of the Shi&#x27;ar. The shield that once protected their star system has fallen. During a discussion with the other members of the Inhuman Royal Family, Medusa states that Shi&#x27;ar blood will spill in the next fight while trying to keep the Kree in line. Medusa and Black Bolt approve of Maximus&#x27; idea to create a mechanism to help them in their fight against the Shi&#x27;ar. Medusa ends up devastated when the T-Bomb goes off with Black Bolt and Vulcan still where the T-Bomb was. While weeping in Crystal&#x27;s arms, Medusa declared that they have won.

During the &quot;Dark Reign&quot; storyline, Medusa was seen when Quicksilver appears in Attilan and present them with the Xerogen Crystals following the defeat of Unspoken. Medusa then absolves him of his crimes and restores his citizenship.

During the &quot;Realm of Kings&quot; storyline, Medusa ends up taking control of the Inhumans following Black Bolt&#x27;s death. Devos the Devastator arrives and ends up inciting a riot in the Alpha Primitives. The Mighty Avengers arrive and help to quell the riots incited by Devos. Henry Pym learns from Medusa about what happened to Black Bolt and expresses his sorrow for her loss as he too had lost Wasp. Medusa and the rest of the Inhumans deal with Dr. Vere and Zarek when they plot to overthrow the Inhuman Royal Family.

She takes her husband&#x27;s place in the Illuminati when Iron Man reassembles the team in response to the Hood&#x27;s attempts to acquire the Infinity Gems, although in the end Steve Rogers takes &#x27;custody&#x27; of Black Bolt&#x27;s gem at the conclusion of the crisis.

As part of the &quot;Marvel NOW!&quot; event, Medusa becomes a member of the Future Foundation when the Fantastic Four take a time-traveling trip.

During the &quot;Civil War II&quot; storyline, Medusa and Crystal introduce the Inhuman Ulysses to Captain Marvel, War Machine, and Black Panther. Medusa later catches Iron Man infiltrating New Attilan to claim Ulysses and fails to reason with him. After Iron Man defeats Medusa, Crystal, and Karnak and makes off with Ulysses, Medusa leads some Inhumans to Stark Tower to confront Iron Man which led the Avengers, the Ultimates, S.H.I.E.L.D., and other superheroes to intervene. Medusa was present when Ulysses projected his latest vision of a rampaging Hulk standing over the corpses of the superheroes.

During the &quot;Inhumans vs. X-Men&quot; storyline, Beast overhears Medusa telling the rest of the Inhuman Royal Family that they to be prepared just in case the X-Men lose patience in their truce and attack them. As the X-Men take action against the Inhumans, Medusa sends Iso and Inferno to find out what happened to Black Bolt and Crystal as she prepares for battle. Medusa then fights the time-displaced Beast in the lab of the original Beast as she effectively calls off the truce. As she gets the upper hand, Nightcrawler teleports in and takes her away. Despite the subsequent escalation of the conflict, when Medusa learns that the X-Men only attacked now because the Terrigenesis cloud was about to reach the point where it would make the whole planet toxic to mutants, she resolves the situation by destroying the cloud, preventing any further Inhumans from manifesting their powers, feeling that the future of her species is not worth the present loss of mutant life that would result. She also abdicates her throne to Iso.

In the aftermath, she along with her sister, Crystal, Black Bolt, Flint, Gorgon and Swain, are guided by Noh-Varr to the former Kree throne-world of Hala where he has stated they may discover the origins of Terrigen and in so doing offer a future to their doomed people, however, things are not well for the former Queen as she runs her hand through her powerful hair only to pull a large clump out with it, forcing her to announce to her crew that she is dying. It is soon apparent that Medusa&#x27;s decision to destroy the Terrigen Cloud is the reason that is afflicting Medusa. She did so to save the Mutant race, but in doing so she had doomed the future of her people. Because Medusa had pressed the button, that act had the consequence of gradually draining the life energies from her. Akin to dying of a broken heart, Medusa had acted to end a cultural heritage that had lasted millennia, and her body has essentially chosen to end with it. Her only hope now is to find the secrets of the Terrigen and bring a new source of it back to their people, so she too can be revitalized. When the Inhumans obtain the Primagen from the Progenitors&#x27; World Farm and Gorgon buys his fellow Inhumans time to get away, Maximus takes a sample of the Primagen and has a vision where the Progenitors attack Earth in retaliation for the theft of the Primagen. While on the Astral Plane with Black Bolt, Medusa and Black Bolt agreed to continue as partners and not lovers. When Medusa takes the Primagen, it restores her hair and health while also causing a backlash in the attacking Progenitor to destroy the approaching Progenitors causing the Ordinator-Class Progenitors that saw the attack from the World Farm to spare Earth from their invasion.

During the &quot;Death of the Inhumans&quot; storyline, Medusa is seen with the Inhuman Royal Family when they find the dead bodies of the Universal Inhumans. When an explosive trap starts to go off, Medusa managed to make it out alive. Medusa and the Inhuman Royal Family later mourn the fallen Inhumans following Vox&#x27;s attack on New Arctilan. After Black Bolt was taken captive by the Kree, Medusa and the surviving Inhuman Royal Family members try to recruit Beta Ray Bill in their fight against Vox and the Kree. The Inhuman Royal Family are finally taking the battle to the Kree and arrive just in time to save Black Bolt from Vox. Medusa is present when it is discovered that Vox is not a Super-Inhuman and is just a Kree programming. When the Inhuman Royal Family and Beta Ray Bill take the battle to the Kree, Medusa and Karnak fight a Vox-controlled Crystal and Lockjaw. After Black Bolt&#x27;s sonic scream is used on the Vox-controlled Inhumans enough to free Crystal and Lockjaw and cause the Kree to retreat, Medusa is pleased that Crystal and Lockjaw are freed from Vox&#x27;s control. Black Bolt emerges from the room as Medusa orders Lockjaw to take them away from the Kree base. When Crystal asks where they should go, Black Bolt uses his sign language to say &quot;home.&quot; Lockjaw then teleports them away.

Medusa and Black Bolt once again become lovers later on.

==Powers and abilities==
Medusa possesses a long, thick head of red hair; thanks to her exposure to the mutagenic Terrigen Mist, every strand of her hair has great tensile strength, modulus of elasticity, and sheer resistance far surpassing human hair. She possesses the psychokinetic ability to animate her hair for a number of feats, including elongating it to almost twice its normal length (Medusa&#x27;s hair is approximately in length when relaxed), and using her hair to lift and move heavy weights (up to 1.6 tons); a portion of her hair must be used to anchor the rest at these greater weights, so that more than her scalp/skull is used as a brace.

Medusa can control the movement of her hair as if it were countless thin appendages growing from her head. A psionic field permeates her mutagenically altered hair-cells, causing mutual attraction across the gaps between strands. These relatively small forces operate in conjunction to develop larger forces. Through concentration, she can psionically move her hair in any manner imaginable. She can snap the length of it through the air like a whip (the tip of which moves faster than the speed of sound), or rotate it in a fan-like manner. She can bind persons or objects with it as if it were rope, or use it to lift objects which weigh more than she could lift with her arms. Her scalp, skull, and neck do not support the weight of an object that she lifts: It is held aloft by the psionic force coursing through the hair. Medusa can also perform delicate manipulations with her hair such as lock picking or threading a needle, and such complex acts of coordination as typing or shuffling a deck of cards. Although she has no nerve endings in her hair, she can &quot;feel&quot; sensations on all parts of her hair by a form of mental feedback from her psionic field.

Medusa is an accomplished thief, using her hair. Medusa is also able to retain some degree of control over her hair after it has been cut or otherwise severed from her scalp. She presumably has the typical enhanced physical abilities granted by the genetically superior Inhuman physiology. She is also highly skilled at interpreting the gestures and body language of Black Bolt, and is fluent in a special sign language she uses with Black Bolt.

Like all Inhumans, Medusa&#x27;s immune system is weaker than that of an average human. However, due to her frequent ventures into the outside world, Medusa&#x27;s immune system is stronger than that of her fellow Inhumans. As such, she has attained a resistance to the pollutants of the outside world.

== Cultural impact and legacy ==

=== Critical reception ===
Medusa has received positive reception over the years. Critics have praised her unique abilities, her status as a queen and diplomat, and her time as part of the Fantastic Four and the Future Foundation. Furthermore, Peyton Hinckle of &quot;ComicsVerse&quot; praised the &quot;Royals&quot; miniseries, where Medusa temporarily lost her powers and was depicted as more vulnerable.
