<text>Brendan James Fraser ( ; born December 3, 1968) is an American-Canadian actor. Fraser had his breakthrough in 1992 with the comedy &quot;Encino Man&quot; and the drama &quot;School Ties&quot;. He gained further prominence for his starring roles in the comedies &quot;With Honors&quot; (1994) and &quot;George of the Jungle&quot; (1997) and emerged as a star playing Rick O&#x27;Connell in &quot;The Mummy&quot; trilogy (1999–2008). He took on dramatic roles in &quot;Gods and Monsters&quot; (1998), &quot;The Quiet American&quot; (2002), and &quot;Crash&quot; (2004), and further fantasy roles in &quot;Bedazzled&quot; (2000) and &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot; (2008).

Fraser&#x27;s film work slowed from the late 2000s to mid-2010s due to poor box office performances, and various health and personal issues, including the fallout from a sexual assault committed against him in 2003 by Philip Berk, the then-president of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. In addition to films, Fraser branched into television with roles in the Showtime drama &quot;The Affair&quot; (2016–2017), the FX series &quot;Trust&quot; (2018), and the Max series &quot;Doom Patrol&quot; (2019–2023).

His film career was revitalized by roles in Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s &quot;No Sudden Move&quot; (2021) and Darren Aronofsky&#x27;s &quot;The Whale&quot; (2022). Fraser&#x27;s starring role as an obese gay man in the latter earned him critical acclaim and numerous accolades, including the Academy Award for Best Actor – the first time a Canadian had won it.

==Early life and education==
Fraser was born on December 3, 1968, in Indianapolis, Indiana, to Canadian parents Carol Mary (née Généreux; 1937–2016) and Peter Fraser. He is the youngest of four siblings; his brothers are Kevin, Sean, and Regan. His mother was a sales counselor, and his father was a former journalist who worked as a Canadian foreign service officer for the Government Office of Tourism. His maternal uncle, George Genereux, was the only Canadian to win a gold medal in the 1952 Summer Olympics, at the Olympic Trap. Fraser and his three older brothers have Irish, Scottish, German, Czech, and French-Canadian ancestry. He holds dual Canadian and American citizenship.

Fraser&#x27;s family moved often during his childhood, living in Eureka, California; Seattle, Washington; Ottawa, Ontario; the Netherlands; and Switzerland. His earlier years were spent attending a Montessori school in Detroit and the Sacred Heart School in Bellevue, Washington. He then attended Upper Canada College, a private boarding school in Toronto, from which he graduated in 1987.

While on vacation in London, England, in the 1970s, he attended his first professional theatre show, &quot;Oliver!&quot;, in the West End, which sparked his interest in acting. He also joined the chorus of a high-school musical production of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;.

Fraser graduated from Seattle&#x27;s Cornish College of the Arts in 1990. He then began acting at a small acting college in New York City. Fraser had planned on studying toward a Master of Fine Arts in Acting from Southern Methodist University, but after visiting Hollywood, he decided instead to move there to pursue work in film.

==Career==
===1991–1996: Career beginnings===
In 1991, Fraser made his film debut with a small role as a seaman headed to Vietnam in &quot;Dogfight&quot;. He got his first leading film role alongside Sean Astin and Pauly Shore in the 1992 comedy film &quot;Encino Man&quot;, where he played a frozen pre-historic caveman who is thawed out in the present day. The film was a moderate box office success and has gained a cult following. That same year he starred in &quot;School Ties&quot; with fellow rising actors Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, and Chris O&#x27;Donnell as a Jewish star quarterback confronting embedded anti-semitism in private prep school society.

Between 1994 and 1996, he starred in several box office failures such as &quot;With Honors&quot; (1994) with Joe Pesci, &quot;Airheads&quot; (1994) with Steve Buscemi &amp; Adam Sandler, &quot;The Passion of Darkly Noon&quot; (1995), &quot;Mrs. Winterbourne&quot; (1996) and &quot;The Twilight of the Golds&quot; (1997). He also had a small part in the 1995 film &quot;Now and Then&quot;. He made cameo appearances in the Pauly Shore films &quot;Son in Law&quot; (1993) and &quot;In the Army Now&quot; (1994), reprising his &quot;Encino Man&quot; role.

Fraser performed at his first theatre production in 1995 at the Geffen Playhouse, taking on the role of Victor in John Patrick Shanley&#x27;s &quot;Four Dogs and a Bone&quot;.

===1997–2001: Global success ===
He had his first major box office success with the 1997 comedy film &quot;George of the Jungle&quot; which was based on the animated series of the same title created by Jay Ward. He received critical acclaim for his dramatic role in 1998&#x27;s &quot;Gods and Monsters&quot;, which was based on the life of James Whale (Ian McKellen), who directed &quot;Frankenstein&quot;. The film was written and directed by Bill Condon, and follows the loss of creativity, ambiguous sexuality and the bond between a heterosexual gardener (played by Fraser) and a homosexual, tortured and ailing filmmaker (played by McKellen).

He achieved his biggest commercial success when he portrayed the lead adventurer Rick O&#x27;Connell in the fantasy adventure film &quot;The Mummy&quot; (1999) and its sequel &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot; (2001). &quot;The Mummy&quot; established him as one of the biggest film stars of 1990s. In between these successes, he also starred in the box office bombs &quot;Dudley Do-Right&quot; (1999) (which was based on another Jay Ward animated series) and the stop-motion/live-action fantasy comedy &quot;Monkeybone&quot; (2001); though he did have moderate success with the romantic comedy &quot;Blast from the Past&quot; (1999) and the fantasy comedy &quot;Bedazzled&quot; (2000), a remake of the 1967 British film of the same name. He lent his voice for the unreleased animated film &quot;Big Bug Man&quot;, with Marlon Brando.

===2001–2008: Dramatic and comedic roles===
In late 2001, Fraser starred as &quot;Brick&quot; in the Pulitzer Prize winning play Tennessee Williams&#x27;s &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot;, directed by Anthony Page. Castmates included Ned Beatty, Frances O&#x27;Connor and Gemma Jones. The show closed on January 12, 2002, with Fraser garnering many excellent reviews. In 2002, he starred alongside Michael Caine in the political drama &quot;The Quiet American&quot; which was well received by critics. The following year, he starred in the live-action/animated film &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot; as its human lead, D.J. Drake (he also voiced the Tasmanian Devil). In 2004, he appeared as part of an ensemble cast in the Academy Award-winning film &quot;Crash&quot; where he played the husband to Sandra Bullock&#x27;s character as the District Attorney of Los Angeles.

He has also made guest appearances on the television shows &quot;Scrubs&quot;, &quot;King of the Hill&quot;, and &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. In March 2006, he was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame, the first American-born actor to receive the honor. However, as of 2022, he does not have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. After a six-year hiatus in the franchise, Fraser returned for the second sequel to &quot;The Mummy&quot; released in August 2008 and titled &quot;The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor&quot;. Filming started in Montreal on July 27, 2007, and the film also starred Jet Li as Emperor Han. That same year, he starred in the 3D film adaptation of Jules Verne&#x27;s &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot; and the fantasy film &quot;Inkheart&quot; (chosen personally for the lead role by the novel&#x27;s author Cornelia Funke).

===2009–2020: Setbacks and switch to television===
In 2010, Fraser returned to Broadway in the production of &quot;Elling&quot;, but the play closed after one week, due to lackluster reviews. After appearing in the critically panned &quot;Furry Vengeance&quot; in 2010, Fraser moved from being represented by William Morris Endeavor to the Creative Artists Agency. In 2010, he starred in &quot;Whole Lotta Sole&quot; directed by Terry George and in 2011, he was set to play William Tell in &quot;The Legend of William Tell: 3D&quot;, directed by Eric Brevig, with whom Fraser had also worked in &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot;. Filming was delayed and late in 2011, Fraser sued the producer Todd Moyer for promised wages. Moyer later countersued for assault, which Fraser dismissed as [Moyer&#x27;s] desperate attempt to avoid paying his debt. In 2013, he played an Elvis Presley impersonator in the ensemble black comedy &quot;Pawn Shop Chronicles&quot;.

In 2016, Fraser replaced Ray Liotta in the Bollywood thriller &quot;Line of Descent&quot;. Fraser later joined the recurring cast of the television drama series &quot;The Affair&quot; during season 3 where he portrayed the misery-minded prison guard Gunther. He portrayed Getty family fixer James Fletcher Chace in the FX anthology series &quot;Trust&quot;, which premiered on March 25, 2018. Fraser portrayed Clifford &quot;Cliff&quot; Steele / Robotman in the &quot;Titans&quot; TV series, with Jake Michaels physically portraying Robotman. He reprised the role in the spin-off series &quot;Doom Patrol&quot;, where he voices the character and appears as Steele in flashbacks; Riley Shanahan – replacing Jake Michaels in &quot;Titans&quot; – physically portrays Robotman.

His comeback after a period of relative inactivity was dubbed &quot;The Brennaissance&quot; by fans. In an interview on &quot;The Graham Norton Show&quot;, Fraser acknowledged the portmanteau.

===2021–present: Career resurgence and critical acclaim===
In September 2020, Fraser was cast as gangster Doug Jones in Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s period crime film &quot;No Sudden Move&quot;, which was released in 2021. In January 2021, Fraser was announced as the lead in Darren Aronofsky&#x27;s film &quot;The Whale&quot;. Aronofsky stated he had looked for the lead role in the movie for a decade, and decided to cast Fraser after seeing him in the trailer of the low-budget Brazilian film &quot;Journey to the End of the Night&quot;. &quot;A light bulb went off, and I was like, &#x27;Oh, that guy can do it&#x27;&quot;, he said.

The film premiered at the Venice International Film Festival in September 2022. Fraser spoke on preparing for the role with &quot;The New York Times&quot; stating, &quot;The Obesity Action Coalition gave me access to many people, so I could ask them their story on Zoom calls. I talked to maybe eight or 10 people — some bedridden, some perfectly mobile.&quot; Fraser&#x27;s performance was highly praised and the film received a six-minute standing ovation at the festival and subsequently won him an Oscar for Best Actor. He became the first Canadian to win the best actor award.

In August of the same year, Fraser was announced as part of the cast of Martin Scorsese&#x27;s film &quot;Killers of the Flower Moon&quot;, as well as Max Barbakow&#x27;s upcoming comedy film &quot;Brothers&quot;. In October 2021, Fraser was cast to portray the villain Firefly in the superhero film &quot;Batgirl&quot;, set in the DC Extended Universe; the release of the film was canceled in August 2022 after a change in Warner Bros. studio priorities.

Fraser lent his voice to the audiodrama &quot;The Downloaded&quot;, written by Robert J. Sawyer, which was released in Autumn of 2023 as an Audible-exclusive audiobook. In December 2023, Fraser was a guest narrator at Disney&#x27;s Candlelight Processional at Walt Disney World. In July 2024, it was announced that Fraser would star as Dwight D. Eisenhower in &quot;Pressure&quot;.

==Personal life==
On July 4, 1993, shortly after he had arrived in Los Angeles, Fraser met his future wife, actress Afton Smith, at a barbecue at Winona Ryder&#x27;s house. Smith also appeared as a minor cast member in Fraser&#x27;s &quot;George of the Jungle&quot; film. They married on September 27, 1998, and had three sons together:
Griffin Arthur Fraser (b. 2002), Holden Fletcher Fraser (b. 2004), and Leland Francis Fraser (b. 2006). Holden and Leland are both fashion models signed with Marilyn Agency; in a 2018 interview with &quot;GQ&quot;, Fraser said that Griffin is on the autism spectrum.

In April 2007, Fraser and his wife sold their home in Beverly Hills, California for $3 million; in December of that year, Fraser&#x27;s publicist announced that the couple had decided to divorce. Fraser was ordered to make monthly alimony payments of $50,000 for ten years or until Smith remarried, whichever came first, and monthly child support payments of $25,000. In early 2011, Fraser asked the court to reduce his alimony payments, asserting that he was unable to meet the annual obligation of $600,000; he did not contest the child support payments. In late 2011, Smith accused Fraser of fraudulently failing to disclose some of his financial assets, including contracts for two films: &quot;Extraordinary Measures&quot; and &quot;Furry Vengeance&quot;. In 2014, the court ruled against both Fraser&#x27;s request for alimony reduction and Smith&#x27;s fraud allegation. Both parents received public praise for being actively engaged in their sons’ lives. Smith has since turned from acting to book-writing and real estate.

Since September 2022, Fraser has been in a relationship with makeup artist Jeanne Moore. The couple made their red-carpet debut at the 2022 Venice Film Festival, and Fraser expressed his gratitude to Moore during his acceptance speech for the Oscar for Best Actor at the 95th Academy Awards.

, Fraser lives in Bedford, New York.

Fraser speaks French and serves on the board of directors for FilmAid International. He is an accomplished amateur photographer and has used several instant cameras in movies and on TV shows, most notably in his guest roles on &quot;Scrubs&quot;. In his first appearance, he used a Polaroid pack film, and in his second appearance, he used a Holga with a Polaroid back, a Japanese-only model. The book &quot;Collector&#x27;s Guide to Instant Cameras&quot; includes a dedication to Fraser. He is also an accomplished amateur archer.

===Health===
In 2018, Fraser stated publicly that the physical demands of the stunts and maneuvers he had performed in his action- and comedy roles had required him to undergo several surgeries over a period of seven years, including a partial knee replacement, a laminectomy, and vocal-cord surgery.

===Sexual assault allegation against Philip Berk===
In 2018, Fraser said publicly that, at a luncheon in 2003, he had been sexually assaulted by Philip Berk, the then-president of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), the nonprofit organization that votes for the Golden Globe Awards. Berk described Fraser&#x27;s account as a &quot;total fabrication&quot;, but in his 2014 memoir, he acknowledged having groped Fraser &quot;in jest&quot;. The stress he experienced from a succession of events, including his divorce, his health problems, the death of his mother, and making the alleged assault public, plunged Fraser into a major depression that led to a break in his career.

Several publications and social media users assumed that Fraser had been blacklisted from Hollywood because of his accusation against Berk. In the 2018 &quot;GQ&quot; article in which Fraser first made his allegation public, he said, &quot;The phone does stop ringing in your career, and you start asking yourself why. There&#x27;s many reasons, but was [my allegation] one of them? I think it was.&quot; However, in Fraser’s 2019 appearance on the radio show &quot;Sway in the Morning&quot;, he expressed a different view, saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t think the HFPA really wield that much power.&quot; In 2022, Fraser told &quot;GQ&quot; that if the HFPA nominated him for a Golden Globe at that year for his most recent film, &quot;The Whale&quot;, he would &quot;not participate&quot; because of his &quot;history&quot; with the organization.

==Philanthropy==
Since 2018, Fraser has been a celebrity judge on the Dancing Stars of Greenwich annual charity gala which raises money for the non-profit organization Abilis, a local charity which supports more than 800 individuals and their families with disabilities in Fairfield County, Connecticut. His former wife, Afton Smith, also takes part in the dance competition. In 2022, Smith and Fraser received the Heart of Abilis Award for their support and fundraising work for the charity.

<text>Robert Williams Buchanan (18 August 1841 – 10 June 1901) was a Scottish poet, novelist and dramatist.

== Early life and education ==
He was the son of Robert Buchanan (1813–1866), Owenite lecturer and journalist, and was born at Caverswall, Staffordshire, England. Buchanan senior, a native of Ayr, Scotland, lived for some years in Manchester, then moved to Glasgow, where Buchanan junior was educated, at the high school and the university, one of his fellow-students being the poet David Gray. His essay on Gray, originally published in the &quot;Cornhill Magazine&quot;, tells the story of their close friendship, and of their journey to London in 1860 in search of fame.

His friend, Scottish-American poet James Mackintosh Kennedy, wrote in &quot;Scottish and American Poems&quot;: &quot;Robert Buchanan, the well-known British poet and most genial and variously gifted man, visited America in 1884-85.&quot; He wrote two poems about Buchanan: &quot;Lament&quot; on his departure, and &quot;Robert Buchanan&quot; upon his death. Kennedy&#x27;s son, born in 1885, was named Robert Buchanan Kennedy.

== Writings ==

Buchanan&#x27;s first published works were books of poetry written while he was still living in Glasgow. He appears to have disowned them later in life as they fail to appear in any bibliographic references. His first book was &quot;Poems and Love Lyrics&quot; which although undated was probably published in 1857. It was reviewed in the &quot;Athenaeum&quot; in December 1857. Although the review date is not conclusive the date is almost certainly 1857 or 1858 for the following reasons. (1) The author&#x27;s second book &quot;Mary and other Poems&quot; is by the &#x27;Author of Lyrics&#x27;. This book is dated 1859 and signed Robt W Buchanan in the preface; (2) The preface to &#x27;Mary&#x27; states that this is the author&#x27;s second published book; (3) The preface indicates that the writer is still a young man; (4) The dedication to Hugh Macdonald suggests he was alive when it was written. Macdonald, a well-known Glaswegian, died in 1860. Buchanan&#x27;s second book &quot;Mary and other Poems&quot; was published in 1859 and has never been mentioned in any bibliographies. The book is extremely rare and the only copies appear to be in the Mitchell library in Glasgow. Buchanan also published a collection of short stories and poems, written in collaboration with Charles Gibbon, entitled &quot;Storm-beaten, or Christmas Eve at the &quot;Old Anchor&quot; Inn&quot; in 1862, before &quot;Undertones&quot;, which is often cited as Buchanan&#x27;s first book.

After a period of struggle and disappointment Buchanan published &quot;Undertones&quot; in 1863. This tentative volume had some success, and was followed by &quot;Idyls and Legends of Inverburn&quot; (1865), &quot;London Poems&quot; (1866), and &quot;North Coast and other Poems&quot; (1868), wherein he displayed a faculty for poetic narrative, and a sympathetic insight into the humbler conditions of life.

Buchanan showed more ambition in &quot;The Book of Orm: A Prelude to the Epic&quot;, a study in mysticism, which appeared in 1870. His works gave him a growing reputation, and raised high hopes of his future. Thereafter he would take up prose fiction and the drama, not always with success. He was a frequent contributor to periodicals, and obtained notoriety as a result of an article which, under the pen name of Thomas Maitland, he contributed to &quot;The Contemporary Review&quot; for October 1871. Entitled &quot;The Fleshly School of Poetry&quot;, this article was expanded into a pamphlet (1872), but he subsequently withdrew from the criticisms it contained, and it is chiefly remembered by the replies it evoked from Dante Gabriel Rossetti in a letter to the &quot;Athenaeum&quot; (16 December 1871), entitled &quot;The Stealthy School of Criticism&quot;, and from Algernon Charles Swinburne in &quot;Under the Microscope&quot; (1872).

Buchanan afterwards regretted the violence of his attack, and the old enemy to whom &quot;God and the Man&quot; is dedicated was Rossetti. In 1876 &quot;The Shadow of the Sword&quot;, the first and one of the best of a long series of novels, was published. Buchanan was also the author of many successful plays, including &quot;Lady Clare&quot;, produced in 1883, &quot;Sophia&quot; (1886), an adaptation of &quot;Tom Jones; A Man&#x27;s Shadow&quot; (1890), and &quot;The Charlatan&quot; (1894). He also wrote, in collaboration with Harriett Jay, the melodrama &quot;Alone in London&quot; (in which actress Cora Tanner starred). His latest poems, &quot;The Outcast: a Rhyme for the Time&quot; (1891) and &quot;The Wandering Jew&quot; (1893) were directed against certain aspects of Christianity. In 1896 he became, so far as some of his work was concerned, his own publisher. He was unfortunate in his latter years; a speculation turned out ruinously, and he had to sell his copyrights.

In November 1894 he campaigned very publicly for the release of murderer and bigamist James Canham Read, known as the Southend Murderer. His campaign was unsuccessful and Read was hanged on 4 December.

In the autumn of 1900 he had a paralytic seizure, from which he never recovered. He died at Streatham. He is buried in a family grave in the cemetery of St. John the Baptist Church, Southend-on-Sea, Essex, where there is a memorial to him.

Buchanan&#x27;s poems were collected into three volumes in 1874, into one volume in 1884; and as &quot;Complete Poetical Works&quot; (2 vols., 1901). Among his poems should also be mentioned:
*&quot;The Drama of Kings&quot; (1871)
*&quot;St Abe and his Seven Wives&quot;, a lively tale of Salt Lake City, Utah, published anonymously in 1872
*&quot;Balder the Beautiful&quot; (1877)
*&quot;The City of Dream&quot; (1888)

His earlier novels, &quot;The Shadow of the Sword&quot;, and &quot;God and the Man&quot; (1881), a striking tale of a family feud, are distinguished by a certain breadth and simplicity of treatment which is not so noticeable in their successors, among which may be mentioned:
*&quot;The Martyrdom of Madeline&quot; (1882)
*&quot;Foxglove Manor&quot; (1885)
*&quot;Effie Hetherington&quot; (1896)
*&quot;Matt: A Story of A Caravan&quot; (1897)
*&quot;Father Anthony&quot; (1898)In November 
*&quot;Lady Kilpatrick&quot; (1898)
*&quot;David Gray and other Essays, chiefly on Poetry&quot; (1868)
*&quot;Master Spirits&quot; (1873)
*&quot;A Poet&#x27;s Sketch Book&quot; (1883), in which the interesting essay on Gray is reprinted
*&quot;A Look round Literature&quot; (1887), and the previous volume contain Buchanan&#x27;s chief contributions to periodical literature
*&quot;The Land of Lorne&quot; (2 vols., 1871), a vivid record of yachting experiences on the west coast of Scotland.
*&quot;The Master of the Mine&quot; (1885), originally serialised by the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot; in 1867.

<doc id="386499" wikidata="Q1128371" url="?curid=386499" title="Constructive solid geometry">
<text>Constructive solid geometry (CSG; formerly called computational binary solid geometry) is a technique used in solid modeling. Constructive solid geometry allows a modeler to create a complex surface or object by using Boolean operators to combine simpler objects, potentially generating visually complex objects by combining a few primitive ones.

In 3D computer graphics and CAD, CSG is often used in procedural modeling. CSG can also be performed on polygonal meshes, and may or may not be procedural and/or parametric.

Contrast CSG with polygon mesh modeling and box modeling.

==Workings==
The simplest solid objects used for the representation are called &quot;geometric primitives&quot;. Typically they are the objects of simple shape: cuboids, cylinders, prisms, pyramids, spheres, cones. The set of allowable primitives is limited by each software package. Some software packages allow CSG on curved objects while other packages do not.

An object is &quot;constructed&quot; from primitives by means of allowable &quot;operations&quot;, which are typically Boolean operations on sets: union, intersection and difference, as well as geometric transformations of those sets.

A primitive can typically be described by a procedure which accepts some number of parameters; for example, a sphere may be described by the coordinates of its center point, along with a radius value. These primitives can be combined into compound objects using operations like these:

Combining these elementary operations, it is possible to build up objects with high complexity starting from simple ones.

===Ray tracing===
Rendering of constructive solid geometry is particularly simple when ray tracing. Ray tracers intersect a ray with both primitives that are being operated on, apply the operator to the intersection intervals along the 1D ray, and then take the point closest to the camera along the ray as being the result.

==Applications==

Constructive solid geometry has a number of practical uses. It is used in cases where simple geometric objects are desired, or where mathematical accuracy is important.
Nearly all engineering CAD packages use CSG (where it may be useful for representing tool cuts, and features where parts must fit together). 

The &quot;Quake&quot; engine and Unreal Engine both use this system, as does Hammer (the native Source engine level editor), and Torque Game Engine/Torque Game Engine Advanced. CSG is popular because a modeler can use a set of relatively simple objects to create very complicated geometry. When CSG is procedural or parametric, the user can revise their complex geometry by changing the position of objects or by changing the Boolean operation used to combine those objects.

One of the advantages of CSG is that it can easily assure that objects are &quot;solid&quot; or water-tight if all of the primitive shapes are water-tight. This can be important for some manufacturing or engineering computation applications. By comparison, when creating geometry based upon boundary representations, additional topological data is required, or consistency checks must be performed to assure that the given boundary description specifies a valid solid object.

A convenient property of CSG shapes is that it is easy to classify arbitrary points as being either inside or outside the shape created by CSG. The point is simply classified against all the underlying primitives and the resulting boolean expression is evaluated. This is a desirable quality for some applications such as ray tracing.

==Conversion from meshes to CSG==
With CSG models being parameterized by construction, they are often favorable over usual meshes when it comes to applications where the goal is to fabricate customized models. For such applications it can be interesting to convert already existing meshes to CSG trees. This problem of automatically converting meshes to CSG trees is called inverse CSG.

A resulting CSG tree is required to occupy the same volume in 3D space as the input mesh while having a minimal number of nodes. Simple solutions are preferred to ensure that the resulting model is easy to edit.
Solving this problem is a challenge because of the large search space that has to be explored. It combines continuous parameters such as dimension and size of the primitive shapes, and discrete parameters such as the Boolean operators used to build the final CSG tree.

Deductive methods solve this problem by building a set of half-spaces that describe the interior of the geometry. These half-spaces are used to describe primitives that can be combined to get the final model.

Another approach decouples the detection of primitive shapes and the computation of the CSG tree that defines the final model. This approach exploits the ability of modern program synthesis tools to find a CSG tree with minimal complexity.

There are also approaches that use genetic algorithms to iteratively optimize an initial shape towards the shape of the desired mesh.

<text>Gérard Asselin (born April 19, 1950 in Sainte-Flavie, Quebec - February 9, 2013) was a Canadian politician who was a Bloc Québécois member of the House of Commons of Canada, representing the riding of Manicouagan from 2004 to 2011 and Charlevoix from 1993 to 2004.

==Career==
Asselin was a foreman, and was previously a city councillor in Baie-Comeau, Quebec from 1979 to 1993.

In his first run for federal office, in 1993, Asselin won the riding of former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney in a landslide, finishing 16,500 votes ahead of his closest opponent. The Tory candidate finished a distant third, and nearly lost his deposit. Asselin was re-elected almost as easily in every election until losing to NDP challenger Jonathan Genest-Jourdain in 2011.

Asselin was one of the party&#x27;s few more socially conservative members. In 2005, Asselin joined six other Bloc Québécois members opposing Bill C-38, which extended marriage rights to same-sex couples in Canada. At the end of the 37th Canadian Parliament, Asselin was the Bloc&#x27;s Forestry critic. He also served as Natural Resources Critic.

<doc id="386502" wikidata="Q2452067" url="?curid=386502" title="Hughenden Valley">
<text>Hughenden Valley (formerly called Hughenden or Hitchendon) is an extensive village and civil parish in Buckinghamshire, England, just to the north of High Wycombe. The civil parish is still named &quot;Hughenden&quot; as of 2024. It is almost in size, divided mainly between arable and wooded land. It is situated north of central Wycombe, south of the county town of Aylesbury and some west-northwest of London.

Hughenden parish was first mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 and was called &quot;Huchedene&quot;, or &quot;Hugh&#x27;s Valley&quot; in modern English. There are some however that argue the original name refers to the Anglo Saxon man&#x27;s name &quot;Huhha&quot; rather than the French &quot;Hugh&quot;. At the time of the Domesday Book, the village was in the extensive estates of Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, who was the half brother of William the Conqueror.

There were many ancient manors within the parish border, and in addition to Odo, King Henry I of England, King Henry VIII of England, and Simon de Montfort have all at one time owned property in the parish.

Benjamin Disraeli (later Earl of Beaconsfield) lived at Hughenden Manor, a Georgian mansion, altered by the Disraelis when they purchased it in 1848. The manor sits on the brow of the hill to the west of the main road that links Hughenden to High Wycombe. The Earl, who died in 1881 was buried in a vault beneath the nearby Church of St Michael and All Angels, accessed from the churchyard. The church also contains a memorial to the Earl erected by Queen Victoria: the only instance a reigning monarch has ever erected a memorial to a subject. The Manor House was given to the National Trust in 1947, and the trust also own woodland around here as well.

The Grade II* listed Disraeli Monument stands on Tinker&#x27;s Hill in the Hughenden Valley, in memory of the writer and scholar Issac D&#x27;Israeli.

==Sport and recreation==
Hughenden has a King George&#x27;s Field in memorial to King George V, and there is a village hall here too where groups such as karate, cubs, brownies, beavers, old people&#x27;s groups, art club and toddler groups meet. Also in the village is the magnolia park sports club. It includes a bowls green three tennis courts a senior football pitch/cricket green and a club house.

==Amenities and businesses==
* A pub called The Harrow at the north end of the village.
* Deeter Electronics Ltd, which produces specialist electronics, on the site of the former petrol station and BMW garage.
* A builder&#x27;s yard near the south end of the village, where there is also a car garage called Hughenden Autos
* A medical practice on the corner of the junction going to Great Kingshill.
* A Village Hall
* A community-run shop adjacent to the Village Hall, which opened in May 2009.
* The former post office is now a private residence.

==Schools==
The village proper has one school – Hughenden Primary School which recently moved from being just a first school, (years reception to 2), but is now taking years reception to year 6. Children can also go to Great Kingshill Combined School which is a Church of England school and so has links with the local church.

==Hamlets==
Hamlets in Hughenden parish include:
*Great Kingshill
*Naphill
*Walters Ash
*Widmer End
*Four Ashes
*Cryers Hill

<text>John Singleton Mosby (December 6, 1833 – May 30, 1916), also known by his nickname &quot;Gray Ghost&quot;, was an American military officer who was a Confederate cavalry commander in the American Civil War. His command, the 43rd Battalion, Virginia Cavalry (known as Mosby&#x27;s Rangers or Mosby&#x27;s Raiders) was a partisan ranger unit noted for its lightning-quick raids and its ability to elude Union Army pursuers and blend in with local farmers and townsmen. The area of northern central Virginia in which Mosby operated with impunity became known as Mosby&#x27;s Confederacy.

After the Civil War, Mosby became a Republican and worked as an attorney, supporting his former enemy&#x27;s commander, U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant. He also served as the American consul to Hong Kong and in the U.S. Department of Justice.

In 1992 Mosby was among the first group of men inducted into the United States Army Ranger Hall of fame. In June 2023, the Fort Moore (previously named Benning) garrison commander ordered his name to be removed from the hall of fame as well as the National Ranger Memorial along with three other rangers that included William Quantrill, George Bowman and Jackson Bowman. The National Ranger Memorial foundation, headquartered in Columbus, Ga filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court Middle District to restore Mosby&#x27;s name to the memorial as well as the hall of fame. At a December 16th, 2024 court hearing, U.S. District Judge Clay D. Land dismissed the foundation&#x27;s request to restore Mosby&#x27;s name to the memorial and hall of fame.

==Early life and education==
Mosby was born in Powhatan County, Virginia, on December 6, 1833, to Virginia McLaurine Mosby and Alfred Daniel Mosby, a graduate of Hampden–Sydney College. His father was a member of an old Virginia family of English origin whose ancestor, Richard Mosby, was born in England in 1600 and settled in Charles City, Virginia in the early 17th century. Mosby was named after his maternal grandfather, John Singleton, who was ethnically Irish.

Mosby began his education at a school called Murrell&#x27;s Shop (Elma, Nelson County). When his family moved to Albemarle County, Virginia, near Charlottesville, in about 1840, John attended school in Fry&#x27;s Woods before transferring to a Charlottesville school at the age of ten years. Because of his small stature and frail health, Mosby was the victim of bullies throughout his school career. Instead of becoming withdrawn and lacking in self-confidence, the boy responded by fighting back. The editor of his memoirs recounted a statement Mosby made that he never won any fight in which he was engaged. The only time he did not lose a fight was when an adult stepped in and broke it up.

In 1847, Mosby enrolled at Hampden–Sydney College, where his father was an alumnus. Unable to keep up with his mathematics class, Mosby left the college after two years. On October 3, 1850, he entered the University of Virginia, taking Classical Studies and joining the Washington Literary Society and Debating Union. He was far above average in Latin, Greek, and literature (all of which he enjoyed), but mathematics was still a problem for him. In his third year, a quarrel erupted between Mosby and a notorious bully, George R. Turpin, a tavern keeper&#x27;s son who was robust and physically impressive. When Mosby heard from a friend that Turpin had insulted him, Mosby sent Turpin a letter asking for an explanation—one of the rituals in the code of honor to which Southern gentlemen adhered. Turpin became enraged and declared that on their next meeting, he would &quot;eat him up raw!&quot; Mosby decided he had to meet Turpin despite the risk; to run away would be dishonorable.

On March 29 the two met, Mosby having brought with him a small pepper-box pistol in the hope of dissuading Turpin from an attack. When the two met and Mosby said, &quot;I hear you have been making assertions ...&quot; Turpin put his head down and charged. At that point, Mosby pulled out the pistol and shot his adversary in the neck. The distraught 19-year-old Mosby went home to await his fate. He was arrested and arraigned on two charges: unlawful shooting (a misdemeanor with a maximum sentence of one year in jail and a $500 fine) and malicious shooting (a felony with a maximum sentence of 10 years in the penitentiary). After a trial that almost resulted in a hung jury, Mosby was convicted of the lesser offense, but received the maximum sentence. Mosby later discovered that he had been expelled from the university before he was brought to trial.

While serving time, Mosby won the friendship of his prosecutor, attorney William J. Robertson. When Mosby expressed his desire to study law, Robertson offered the use of his law library. Mosby studied law for the rest of his incarceration. Friends and family used political influence in an attempt to obtain a pardon. Gov. Joseph Johnson reviewed the evidence and pardoned Mosby on December 23, 1853, as a Christmas present, and the state legislature rescinded the $500 (~$ in ) fine at its next session. The incident, trial, and imprisonment so traumatized Mosby that he never wrote about it in his memoirs.

After studying for months in Robertson&#x27;s law office, Mosby was admitted to the bar and established his own practice in nearby Howardsville.

==Family life==
About this time, Mosby met Pauline Clarke (March 30, 1837 – May 10, 1876), who was visiting from Kentucky. Although he was Protestant (nominally Methodist or agnostic) and she was Catholic, courtship ensued. Her father was Beverly L. Clarke. They were married in a Nashville hotel on December 30, 1857. After living for a year with Mosby&#x27;s parents, the couple settled in Bristol, Virginia, which was near a road connecting into Tennessee and Kentucky over the Cumberland Gap.

The Mosbys had two children before the Civil War (May and Beverley). John Singleton Mosby Jr., who like his father became a lawyer, and later worked for mining companies in the west, was born in 1863 during the war. By 1870, the family included five children (adding Lincoln Mosby, 1865–1923, and Victoria Stuart Mosby Coleman, 1866–1946), and lived in Warrenton, Virginia. The Catholic Church established a mission in Warrenton by 1874, which is now known as St. John the Evangelist Catholic Church.

Mosby was dedicated to his family and paid to have them educated at the best Catholic schools in Washington, D.C., when he moved there after his wife&#x27;s death in 1876. Their sons served as altar boys and Mosby&#x27;s youngest sister, Florie, not only converted to Catholicism, but became a Catholic nun. Two more daughters also survived their parents, Pauline V. Mosby (1869–1951) and Ada B. Mosby (1871–1937), but the Mosbys also lost two sons in the turbulent aftermath of the Panic of 1873, George Prentiss Mosby (1873–1874) and Alfred McLaurine Mosby (1876–1876).

==Civil War career==

===1861===
Mosby spoke out against secession, but joined the Confederate army as a private at the outbreak of the war. He first served in William &quot;Grumble&quot; Jones&#x27;s Washington Mounted Rifles. Jones became a Major and was instructed to form a more collective &quot;Virginia Volunteers&quot;, which he created with two mounted companies and eight companies of infantry and riflemen, including the Washington Mounted Rifles. Mosby thought the Virginia Volunteers lacked congeniality, and he wrote to the governor requesting to be transferred. However, his request was not granted. The Virginia Volunteers participated in the First Battle of Bull Run (First Manassas) in July 1861.

===1862===
In April 1862, the Confederate Congress passed the Partisan Ranger Act which &quot;provides that such partisan rangers, after being regularly received into service, shall be entitled to the same pay, rations, and quarters, during their term of service, and be subject to the same regulations, as other soldiers.&quot; 
By June 1862, Mosby was scouting for J.E.B. Stuart during the Peninsular Campaign, including supporting Stuart&#x27;s &quot;Ride around McClellan&quot;. He was captured on July 20 by Union cavalry while waiting for a train at the Beaverdam Depot in Hanover County, Virginia. Mosby was imprisoned in the Old Capitol Prison in Washington, D.C., for ten days before being exchanged as part of the war&#x27;s first prisoner exchange. Even as a prisoner Mosby spied on his enemy. During a brief stopover at Fort Monroe he detected an unusual buildup of shipping in Hampton Roads and learned they were carrying thousands of troops under Ambrose Burnside from North Carolina on their way to reinforce John Pope in the Northern Virginia Campaign. When he was released, Mosby walked to the army headquarters outside Richmond and personally related his findings to Robert E. Lee.

After the Battle of Fredericksburg, in December 1862, Mosby and his senior officer J.E.B. Stuart led raids behind Union lines in Prince William, Fairfax and Loudoun counties, seeking to disrupt federal communications and supplies between Washington, D.C., and Fredericksburg, Virginia, and provision their own forces. As the year ended, at Oakham Farm in Loudoun County, Virginia, Mosby gathered with various horsemen from Middleburg, Virginia who decided to form what became known as Mosby&#x27;s Rangers.

===1863===
In January 1863, Stuart, with Lee&#x27;s concurrence, authorized Mosby to form and take command of the 43rd Battalion Virginia Cavalry. This was later expanded into Mosby&#x27;s Command, a regimental-sized unit of partisan rangers operating in Northern Virginia. The 43rd Battalion operated officially as a unit of the Army of Northern Virginia, subject to the commands of Lee and Stuart, but its men (1,900 of whom served from January 1863 through April 1865) lived outside of the norms of regular army cavalrymen. The Confederate government certified special rules to govern the conduct of partisan rangers. These included sharing in the disposition of spoils of war. They had no camp duties and lived scattered among the civilian population. Mosby required proof from any volunteer that he had not deserted from the regular service, and only about 10% of his men had served previously in the Confederate Army.

In March 1863, Mosby conducted a daring raid far inside Union lines near the Fairfax County courthouse. He was helped, according to his own account, by a deserter from the 5th New York Cavalry regiment named James Ames, who served under Mosby until he was killed in 1864. He and his men captured three Union officers, including Brig. Gen. Edwin H. Stoughton. Mosby wrote in his memoirs that he found Stoughton in bed and roused him with a &quot;spank on his bare back.&quot; Upon being so rudely awakened the general indignantly asked what this meant. Mosby quickly asked if he had ever heard of &quot;Mosby&quot;. The general replied, &quot;Yes, have you caught him?&quot; &quot;I &quot;am&quot; Mosby,&quot; the Confederate ranger said. &quot;Stuart&#x27;s cavalry has possession of the Court House; be quick and dress.&quot; Mosby and his 29 men had captured a Union general, two captains, 30 enlisted men, and 58 horses without firing a shot.
Mosby was formally promoted to the rank of captain two days later, on March 15, 1863, and major on March 26, 1863.

On May 3, 1863, Mosby attacked and captured supply depot Warrenton Junction, Virginia guarded by about 80 men of the 1st West Virginia Volunteer Cavalry Regiment; Mosby&#x27;s losses were 1 killed and 20 wounded/and or captured; Union losses were 6 officers and 14 privates killed and wounded.
On May 29, 1863, Mosby with 40 men led a raid in Greenwich, Virginia derailing a supply train; a battle occurred between Mosby&#x27;s forces and the Union Cavalry under Colonel Mann who commanded the 1st Vermont Cavalry; 5th New York Cavalry; 7th Michigan Cavalry; Mosby was obliged to retreat losing 6 killed; 20 wounded and 10 men and 1 howitzer captured; Union losses were 4 killed and 15 wounded.
On June 10, 1863, Mosby led 100 men on a raid across the Potomac River to attack the Union camp at Seneca, Maryland. After routing a company of the Sixth Michigan Cavalry and burning their camp, Mosby reported the success to J.E.B. Stuart. This drew Stuart&#x27;s attention to Rowser&#x27;s Ford. Mosby had crossed the Potomac there, and during the night of June 27 Stuart&#x27;s forces would use the same crossing while separated from Lee&#x27;s army, and thus didn&#x27;t arrive at Gettysburg until the afternoon of the second day of the battle. Thus, some analysts claim Lee stumbled into the battle without his cavalry, partly because of Mosby&#x27;s successful skirmish at Seneca three weeks earlier.

Mosby endured his first serious wound of the war on August 24, 1863, during a skirmish near Annandale, Virginia, when a bullet hit him through his thigh and side. He retired from the field with his troops and returned to action a month later.

===1864===

The partisan rangers proved controversial among Confederate army regulars, who thought they encouraged desertion as well as morale problems in the countryside as potential soldiers would favor sleeping in their own (or friendly) beds and capturing booty to the hardships and privations of traditional military campaigns. Mosby was thus enrolled in the Provisional Army of the Confederate States and soon promoted to lieutenant colonel on January 21, 1864, and to colonel, December 7, 1864. Mosby carefully screened potential recruits, and required each to bring his own horse.

The &quot;Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant&quot; tell of an incident near Warrenton, Virginia on about May 1, 1864, when Mosby unknowingly missed by only a few minutes a chance to kill or capture Grant, who was traveling unguarded on a special train from Washington back to his headquarters to launch the Overland Campaign.

Mosby endured a second serious wound on September 14, 1864, while taunting a Union regiment by riding back and forth in front of it. A Union bullet shattered the handle of his revolver before entering his groin. Barely staying on his horse to make his escape, he resorted to crutches during a quick recovery and returned to command three weeks later.

Mosby&#x27;s successful disruption of supply lines, attrition of Union couriers, and disappearance in the disguise of civilians caused Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant to tell Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan:

On September 22, 1864, Union forces executed six of Mosby&#x27;s men who had been captured out of uniform (i.e. as spies) in Front Royal, Virginia; a seventh (captured, according to Mosby&#x27;s subsequent letter to Sheridan, &quot;by a Colonel Powell on a plundering expedition into Rappahannock&quot;) was reported by Mosby to have suffered a similar fate. William Thomas Overby was one of the men selected for execution on the hill in Front Royal. His captors offered to spare him if he would reveal Mosby&#x27;s location, but he refused. According to reports at the time, his last words were, &quot;My last moments are sweetened by the reflection that for every man you murder this day Mosby will take a tenfold vengeance.&quot; After the executions a Union soldier pinned a piece of paper to one of the bodies that read: &quot;This shall be the fate of all Mosby&#x27;s men.&quot;

After informing General Robert E. Lee and Confederate Secretary of War James A. Seddon of his intention to respond in kind, Mosby ordered seven Union prisoners, chosen by lot, to be executed in retaliation on November 6, 1864, at Rectortown, Virginia. Although seven men were duly chosen in the original &quot;death lottery,&quot; in the end just three men were actually executed. One numbered lot fell to a drummer boy who was excused because of his age, and Mosby&#x27;s men held a second drawing for a man to take his place. Then, on the way to the place of execution a prisoner recognized Masonic regalia on the uniform of Confederate Captain Montjoy, a recently inducted Freemason then returning from a raid. The condemned captive gave him a secret Masonic distress signal. Captain Montjoy substituted one of his own prisoners for his fellow Mason (though one source speaks of &quot;two&quot; Masons being substituted). Mosby upbraided Montjoy, stating that his command was &quot;not a Masonic lodge&quot;. The soldiers charged with carrying out the executions of the revised group of seven successfully hanged three men. They shot two more in the head and left them for dead (remarkably, both survived). The other two condemned men managed to escape separately.

On November 11, 1864, Mosby wrote to Philip Sheridan, the commander of Union forces in the Shenandoah Valley, requesting that both sides resume treating prisoners with humanity. He pointed out that he and his men had captured and returned far more of Sheridan&#x27;s men than they had lost. The Union side complied. With both camps treating prisoners as &quot;prisoners of war&quot; for the duration, there were no more executions.

On November 18, 1864, Mosby&#x27;s command defeated Blazer&#x27;s Scouts at the Battle of Kabletown.

Mosby had his closest brush with death on December 21, 1864, near Rector&#x27;s Crossroads in Virginia. While dining with a local family, Mosby was fired on through a window, and the ball entered his abdomen two inches below the navel. He managed to stagger into the bedroom and hide his coat, which had his only insignia of rank. The commander of the Union detachment, Maj. Douglas Frazar of the 13th New York Cavalry, entered the house and—not knowing Mosby&#x27;s identity—inspected the wound and pronounced it mortal. Although left for dead, Mosby recovered and returned to the war effort once again two months later.

===1865===
Several weeks after General Robert E. Lee&#x27;s surrender, Mosby&#x27;s status was uncertain, as some posters above the signature of Gen. Winfield S. Hancock stated that marauding bands would be destroyed, and specifically named Mosby as a guerrilla chief who was not included in the parole. However, Mosby received a copy of the poster on April 12 at a letter drop in the Valley along with a letter from Hancock&#x27;s chief of staff, Gen. C.H. Morgan, calling on Mosby to surrender and promising the same terms as were extended to General Lee. Further negotiations followed at Winchester and Millwood. Finally, on April 21, 1865, in Salem, Virginia, Mosby disbanded the rangers, and on the following day many former rangers rode their worst horses to Winchester to surrender, receive paroles and return to their homes.

Rather than following his men to Winchester, Mosby instead rode south with several officers, planning to fight on with General Joseph E. Johnston&#x27;s army in North Carolina. However, before he reached his fellow Confederates, he read a newspaper article about Johnston&#x27;s surrender. Some proposed that they return to Richmond and capture the Union officers who were occupying the White House of the Confederacy, but Mosby rejected the plan, telling them, &quot;Too late! It would be murder and highway robbery now. We are soldiers, not highwaymen.&quot; By early May, Mosby confirmed the $5,000 bounty on his head, but still managed to evade capture, including at a raid near Lynchburg, Virginia which terrified his mother. When Mosby finally confirmed the arrest order had been rescinded, he surrendered on June 17, one of the last Confederate officers to do so.

==Later legal career==

When the Civil War ended, Mosby was just 31, and would live another five decades. He resumed his law practice in Warrenton, and by December 1865 was prosecuting the internal revenue collector in Prince William County for mule-stealing. Nonetheless, during the year after receiving his parole, Mosby often found himself harassed by occupying Union forces, arrested on petty or trumped-up charges, until his wife and young son Revardy, after being rebuffed by President Andrew Johnson despite their mutual kinship ties, met General Grant in January 1866 and secured a handwritten exemption from arrest and guarantee of safe conduct.

===Virginia politics===
On May 8, 1872, as covered by the &quot;Washington Star&quot;, Mosby personally thanked then-U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant for that document. Mosby also told Grant he believed vehemently that election of Horace Greeley (a long-time editor of the &quot;New York Tribune&quot; detested in the South) would be worse for the South because the men surrounding him were worse than those surrounding his old benefactor Grant. A few days later, Massachusetts Congressman Benjamin Butler presented an amnesty bill for former Confederates, as Mosby had suggested in that meeting, and soon President Grant signed it into law. After Greeley became the Democratic party&#x27;s nominee in July, Mosby became Grant&#x27;s campaign manager in Virginia, and an active Republican, although he also made sure the Republicans would not run a candidate against his friend and fellow Warrenton attorney Eppa Hunton, who campaigned and won as a Democrat. In his autobiography Grant stated, &quot;Since the close of the war, I have come to know Colonel Mosby personally and somewhat intimately. He is a different man entirely from what I supposed. ... He is able and thoroughly honest and truthful.&quot;

Soon, Mosby had become one of Grant&#x27;s favorites and was bringing federal patronage jobs to local Virginians, although initially he did not hold any federal job. He tried to make a rapprochement between President Grant and Virginia Governor James L. Kemper, a Confederate Major General and Conservative elected the following year and whom Mosby also supported. However, that failed. His Republican political activity diminished Mosby&#x27;s popularity in Warrenton; many considered him a turncoat. Many Southerners still considered Grant &quot;the enemy&quot;. Mosby received death threats, his boyhood home was burned down, and at least one attempt was made to assassinate him. Later reflecting on the animosity shown to him by his fellow Virginians, Mosby stated in a May 1907 letter that &quot;There was more vindictiveness shown to me by the Virginia people for my voting for Grant than the North showed to me for fighting four years against him.&quot;

After the deaths of his wife Pauline and infant son Alfred in mid-1876, Mosby decided to move his family to Washington, D.C., but had difficulty finding enough legal business to support them. He thus spent much time campaigning for the Republican candidate, Rutherford B. Hayes. Scandals had rocked the Grant Administration as it ended, but Hayes became the next President, and Mosby hoped for a patronage appointment. He also courted powerful Ohio Congressman James Garfield, telling him his desire for a government position, preferably in the Justice Department. He was instead offered a position as trade representative to Canton, but ultimately was confirmed by the Senate as United States consul to Hong Kong (a position he held from 1878 to 1885).

Mosby had to leave his children in the care of relatives, but this proved to be the first in a series of other federal government jobs and postings, many fighting rampant fraud in politically volatile situations. President McKinley appointed Mosby&#x27;s daughter May the postmistress in Warrenton, which became very important after her husband Robert Campbell died in August 1889, leaving her to raise her young children alone (although her sons John Mosby Campbell and Alexander Spottswood Campbell received many letters and some money from their overseas grandfather, as to a lesser extent did Jack Russell, son of his late sister Lucie).

===Consul in Hong Kong===
Upon arriving in Hong Kong, Mosby found discrepancies in his predecessor&#x27;s recordkeeping, and believed David H. Bailey had colluded with his vice-consul Loring (whom Mosby fired), to bilk the government of thousands of dollars in fees. Bailey had pocketed fees charged Chinese emigrants sailing to the U.S. on foreign-flag ships (certifying that they emigrated voluntarily and were not part of notorious &quot;coolie traffic&quot;), and claimed &quot;expenses&quot; for shipboard examinations (by the illiterate proprietor of a local boardinghouse frequented by sailors) of those emigrating on U.S.-flag ships equal to the fees charged. Mosby thought Bailey had almost doubled his salary over the previous eight years by embezzlement and kickbacks, and stopped charging for shipboard examinations (which he personally conducted).

However, Bailey had recently been nominated to become consul at Shanghai because George Seward, previous consul since 1863, had been nominated to become the ambassador to China. Seward&#x27;s replacement in Shanghai, John C. Myers of Reading, Pennsylvania, had reported to State Department superiors that George Seward and his vice-consul Oliver Bradford had been engaging in land and capital speculation in China that seemed to violate the Burlingame Treaty of 1868, but had been suspended, as had his successor Wiley Wells, ex-Congressman from Mississippi. Wells and Myers then sought redress from Congress, which was considering impeaching George Seward, but Bailey traveled to Washington to defend his crony.

Mosby&#x27;s initial letter to his superior (Frederick W. Seward, son of the former secretary of state and who had been wounded by Mosby&#x27;s ex-subordinate while defending his father from an assassination attempt on the night of President Lincoln&#x27;s assassination) languished. However, Special Treasury Department Inspector DeB. Randolph Keim made a whirlwind inspection of Far East consulates and found many similar bookkeeping irregularities. Eventually, in March 1879, Mosby wrote to General Thomas C. H. Smith, a friend of President Hayes, about a similar embezzlement scheme operated by David B. Sickels (U.S. Consul at Bangkok) and his vice-consul Torrey (a Hong Kong native whose correspondence to the fired Loring Mosby accepted and read). Mosby also learned that Bailey had charged (and pocketed) $10,000 per year for shipments of opium to the United States from Macao, although Mosby proposed to issue the required certificate for the legal export for just $2.50.

Meanwhile, consul Mosby was occupied entertaining his old friend President Grant, who spent the two years after his retirement touring the world as a semi-private citizen. Mosby received Grant on April 30. During the nearly week-long visit, Grant told Mosby he had heard more reports about the problems in Bangkok and advised Mosby to go directly to President Hayes (as Mosby had just done) and promised to talk to Hayes personally. However, Bailey was confirmed as consul in Shanghai before Grant&#x27;s return home, and newspapers had begun publishing stories about Mosby&#x27;s inappropriate attire, the start of a campaign to minimize him as a &quot;crackpot.&quot; Moreover, the new State Department investigator was General Julius Stahel, who had fought Mosby in Virginia and had been consul at Hyogo, Japan.

Nonetheless, Stahel verified Mosby&#x27;s complaints, and former Union Cavalry Major William H. Forbes (who had once stabbed Col. Mosby&#x27;s coat during an engagement) who now headed Russell and Co. (major traders in the Far East, including of opium) also supported Mosby against Bailey, Seward and their newspaper friends. Alexander McClure of the &quot;Philadelphia Times&quot; agitated to clean up the consular service. Fred Seward, amidst charges that he was shielding the rascals, resigned by October 1879, and was replaced by John Hay. By January 1880, Grant and journalist John R. Young (who would become consul at Shanghai two years later) briefed Secretary of State William M. Evarts about Sickels and Torrey. George Seward resigned well before the 1880 election, followed by Bailey and Sickels as the President &quot;at last swept the China coast&quot;.

Nonetheless, Mosby was unhappy, despite the electoral victory of his friend Garfield in November and his son Beverley joining him as vice-consul. His repeated requests for leave to return home and visit the rest of his family kept being denied, as were most requests for supplies or funds, and one relative was removed from the Lighthouse Board. In addition to the press and bureaucratic sniping, Mosby found his salary insufficient to support socialization among the local merchant class. Still, as 1880 began, Mosby won a slander lawsuit brought against him in Hong Kong by Peter Smith, the sailors&#x27; boardinghouse keeper associated with ex-consul Bailey, reporting that he defended himself to the applause of jury and spectators, as well as laughter of the distinguished judge. By the time Mosby received notice that his U.S. leave had been approved, President Garfield had been shot and was hanging on to life. Garfield died on September 20, and President Chester Arthur considered promoting Mosby to the similar post at Shanghai (with higher living expenses), but Mosby wanted to either return home or remain in Hong Kong. Thus he remained in exile and dealt with the implications of the Chinese Exclusion Act, the growing opium trade and the brewing war between France and China.
Mosby left China after the election of Democrat Grover Cleveland led to a change in administrations. He was replaced by fellow Virginian Robert E. Withers, whom Mosby had long despised.

===Railroad lawyer===
Before leaving China, Mosby had written Grant seeking help in finding another position. Grant responded (as he was dying) with a letter recommending Mosby to Senator Leland Stanford, a former California railroad magnate. Mosby then spent about 16 years in California, working as a lawyer for the Southern Pacific Railroad until the death of his mentor Collis Huntington. Much of what he did remains unknown, due to a fire which destroyed the company&#x27;s records of that era. Although Mosby hated the desk work, he twice returned to Washington, D.C., to argue before the United States Supreme Court—once based on the consul fees he had remitted to the Treasury (and which the claims court found him entitled to) and once for the railroad. Mosby also wrote articles for Eastern newspapers about his escapades during the Civil War, and traveled to New England on a speaking tour where he met Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. &amp; Sr. (father and son). He also befriended the Patton family and spent time at their ranch with their young son, George S. Patton, recreating Civil War battles, with Mosby playing himself and George playing Robert E. Lee.

In 1898, Mosby tried to secure an officer&#x27;s commission, for the Spanish–American War, but was blocked by Secretary of War Russell A. Alger (see: Russell A. Alger § Vendetta against John S. Mosby). Mosby trained an Oakland, California cavalry troop, dubbed &quot;Mosby’s Hussars&quot;, but the War ended, and they never left for Cuba or the Philippines.

===Government attorney===
When Mosby returned to Washington in 1901, during the second term of the McKinley administration (wary during the first term because of McKinley&#x27;s service in the Shenandoah Valley during the Civil War, as well as being perceived as just another office-seeker), he again sought a job in the Justice Department. After McKinley&#x27;s assassination, President Theodore Roosevelt instead sent Mosby west as a special agent of the Department of the Interior. There, Mosby dealt with illegal fencing of range land by cattle barons in Colorado and Nebraska, who often used fake homestead claims by military widows as well as violated the Van Wyck Fence Law of 1885. When witnesses refused to come forward to testify about illegal fencing for fear of retaliation, Mosby upheld the law by first sending notices to the affected landowner. The Pawnee Cattle Company capitulated in Colorado, so Mosby moved on to western Nebraska, where he learned the land agent actually lived in Iowa and failed to supervise the range.

Mosby&#x27;s Colorado methods failed, however, since the Omaha grand jury refused to authorize an indictment against Bartlett Richards or anyone but nonresident agent W.R. Lesser. Mosby was recalled to Washington to appease Nebraska&#x27;s Senators, and then sent to halt timber trespassers in Alabama forests. However, other attorneys were sent out, who secured indictments. Richards and his English brother in law William G. Comstock were convicted in 1905 despite their argument that the government land hadn&#x27;t been surveyed. The local judge sentenced them to $300 fine apiece and six hours in custody, which they spent celebrating at the Omaha Cattlemen&#x27;s Club, and which led President Roosevelt to fire both the U.S. attorney and U.S. Marshal. The next year Richards and Comstock were indicted on a new charge of conspiracy to deprive the government of public land, convicted and fined $1,500 fines as well as sentenced to a year in jail. After three years of appeals, the convictions and sentences were upheld, so they were sent to prison in Hastings, Nebraska for a year beginning in 1901, and Richards died in a hospital a month before the sentence would end.

Mosby finally got the Department of Justice post he wanted as Philander Knox ended his term as attorney general. It was not with the trust-busting unit, however, but with the Bureau of Insular and Territorial affairs, where Mosby worked (at a low salary of $2,400/year) under his brother-in-law Charles W. Russell Jr. from 1904 to 1910. In 1905 President Roosevelt again sent him to Alabama to troubleshoot allegations of irregularities at the Port of Mobile. Next, he was sent to Oklahoma to investigate charges against U.S. Marshal (and former Rough Rider) Benjamin Colbert. He also secured an indictment of McAlester attorneys George Mansfield, John F. McMurray and Melvin Cornish for misappropriation of Indian Trust funds, but his superior Russell thought the evidence insufficient and ultimately dropped the charges two years later. Meanwhile, Mosby went back to investigate charges of land frauds against Indian minors, and on his return found little to do.

==Memoirist of the Civil War==

Mosby was forced to retire from his U.S. Department of Justice post at age 76, under the William Howard Taft administration. Blind in one eye and cantankerous, he spent his final years in Washington, D.C., living in a boardinghouse and watched over by his remaining daughters to the extent he would let them or others.

Mosby also continued writing about his wartime exploits, as he had been in 1887 &quot; Mosby&#x27;s War Reminiscences and Stuart&#x27;s Cavalry Campaigns&quot;, which had defended the reputation of J.E.B. Stuart, who some partisans of the &quot;Lost Cause&quot; blamed for the Confederacy&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Gettysburg. Mosby had served under Stuart and was fiercely loyal to the late general, writing, &quot;He made me all that I was in the war. ... But for his friendship I would never have been heard of.&quot; He lectured in New England in connection with that first book and wrote numerous articles for popular publications. He published a book length treatise in 1908, a work that relied on his skills as a lawyer to refute categorically all of the claims laid against Stuart. A recent comprehensive study of the Stuart controversy, written by Eric J. Wittenberg and J. David Petruzzi, called Mosby&#x27;s work a &quot;tour de force&quot;.

He attended only one reunion of his Rangers, in Alexandria, Virginia, in January 1895, noticing with bemusement how many had become clergymen but preferring to look forward not back. During the war, he had kept a slave, Aaron Burton, to whom he occasionally sent money in Brooklyn, New York after the war and with whom he kept in contact into the 1890s. In 1894, Mosby wrote to a former comrade regarding the cause of the war, stating: &quot;I&#x27;ve always understood that we went to war on account of the thing we quarreled with the North about. I&#x27;ve never heard of any other cause than slavery.&quot;

In June 1907, Mosby wrote a letter to Samuel &quot;Sam&quot; Chapman, in which he expressed his displeasure over people, namely George Christian, downplaying and denying the importance of slavery in its causing the American Civil War. In the letter, Mosby explained his reasons as to why he fought for the Confederacy, despite personally disapproving of slavery. Although he admitted that the Confederate states had seceded to protect and defend their institution of slavery, he had felt it was his patriotic duty as a Virginian to fight on behalf of the Confederacy, stating that, &quot;I am not ashamed of having fought on the side of slavery—a soldier fights for his country—right or wrong—he is not responsible for the political merits of the course he fights in&quot; and that, &quot;The South was my country.&quot;
==Death and legacy==
In January 1915, the University of Virginia awarded Mosby a medal and written tribute, which touched him deeply. Throughout his life, Mosby remained loyal to those he believed fair-minded, such as Stuart and Grant, but refused to cater to Southern sympathies. He proclaimed that there was &quot;no man in the Confederate Army who had less of the spirit of knight-errantry in him, or took a more practical view of war than I did.&quot; He died of complications after throat surgery in a Washington, D.C., hospital on May 30, 1916, noting at the end that it was Memorial Day. He is buried at Warrenton Cemetery in Warrenton, Virginia.
* The area around Middleburg, from where Mosby launched most of his behind-the-lines activities, was called &quot;Mosby&#x27;s Confederacy&quot;, even in the Northern press.

* Mosby Court, located in the Hillwood Estates subdivision of Round Hill, Virginia, remains named in his honor after residents there, in 2022, rejected Loudoun County&#x27;s proposal to rename the cul-de-sac along with several other streets in the neighborhood (Early Avenue, Hampton Road, Jackson Avenue, Lee Drive, Longstreet Avenue, and Pickett Road) that were named or renamed after Confederate generals in the early 1960s.
* The World War II Liberty Ship was named in his honor.
* The U.S. Army Reserve Center located on Fort Belvoir, VA was previously named in his honor. The center was rededicated in honor of U.S. Army Reserve Staff Sergeant Richard S. Eaton Jr. in 2024.

==In popular culture==
* Herman Melville&#x27;s poem &quot;The Scout Toward Aldie&quot; was about the terror a Union brigade felt upon facing Mosby and his men. In part, the poem was based on Melville&#x27;s experiences in the field with the 13th New York Cavalry and several of its officers who were alumni of Rutgers College.

In the novel, Skimin portrays Mosby as more pro-slavery than was the case historically.
* Mosby was the namesake of &quot;The Gray Ghost (aka Simon Trent)&quot;, a character introduced in the 1992 &quot;&quot;, episode &quot;Beware the Gray Ghost,&quot; and voiced by Adam West.

<text>Hughenden Manor, Hughenden, Buckinghamshire, England, is a Victorian mansion, with earlier origins, that served as the country house of the Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield. It is now owned by the National Trust and open to the public. It sits on the brow of the hill to the west of the main A4128 road that links Hughenden to High Wycombe.

== History ==
The manor of Hughenden is first recorded in 1086, as part of Queen Edith&#x27;s lands, and held by William, son of Odo the Bishop of Bayeux, and was assessed for tax at 10 hides. After his forfeiture, the lands were held by the Crown, until Henry I of England gave the lands to his chamberlain and treasurer, Geoffrey de Clinton. Clinton, whose main home was in Kenilworth, Warwickshire, had the lands tenanted by Geoffrey de Sancto Roerio, who resultantly changed his surname to the Anglicised &quot;Hughenden&quot;. After passing through that family, with successive kings having to confirm the gift of the lands, the manor returned to the Crown in the 14th century. In 1539, the Crown granted the manor and lands to Sir Robert Dormer, and it passed through his family until 1737 when it was sold by Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield to Charles Savage.

After passing through his extended family following a series of deaths and resultant devises by will, by 1816 the manor and lands were owned by John Norris, a distinguished antiquary and scholar. Isaac D&#x27;Israeli, the father of Benjamin Disraeli, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (1868 and 1874–1880, and Earl of Beaconsfield 1876), had for some time rented the nearby Bradenham Manor and, following Norris&#x27;s death in 1845, bought the manor and lands from his executors in 1847. The purchase was supported with the help of a loan of £25,000 (equivalent to almost £1,500,000 today) from Lord Henry Bentinck and Lord Titchfield. This was because at the time, as Disraeli was the leader of the Conservative Party, &quot;it was essential to represent a county,&quot; and county members had to be landowners. Taking ownership of the manor on the death of his father in 1848, Disraeli and his wife Mary Anne, alternated between Hughenden and several homes in London.
Lady Beaconsfield died in 1872, and Disraeli in 1881; both were buried in a vault adjacent in the churchyard of St Michael and All Angels Church which is situated downhill from the main house to the east. The church contains a memorial to the Earl erected by Queen Victoria: the only instance of a reigning British monarch ever erecting a memorial to a subject.

Disraeli had no children; he left Hughenden to his nephew, Coningsby Disraeli. However, as Coningsby was only 14 at the time, his trustees rented out the property until he came into his inheritance in 1888. When Coningsby died in 1936, his widow left Hughenden, and the following year Disraeli&#x27;s niece sold the house to W H Abbey, who vested it, with the remaining contents and , in the Disraelian Society.

During the Second World War, the basement at Hughenden Manor was used as a secret intelligence base code named &quot;Hillside&quot;. The UK Air Ministry staff at the manor analysed aerial photography of Germany and created maps for bombing missions, including the &quot;Dambusters&quot; raid.

In 1947, the Abbey family and the Disraelian Society made Hughenden over to the National Trust. In 1955, it was designated a Grade I listed building. The gardens are also listed as Grade II on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. It is decorated as it might have been at the time it was occupied by Disraeli. It contains a collection of memorabilia including family portraits, Disraeli&#x27;s own furnishings, a library including a collection of Disraeli&#x27;s novels and one written and signed by Queen Victoria along with many of the books he inherited from his father, Isaac D&#x27;Israeli.

The park and woodlands total almost . The formal garden which was designed by Lady Beaconsfield (Queen Victoria created Mary Anne a Viscountess in her own right in 1868), has been restored to a similar condition to when occupied by the Disraelis. The long terrace at the rear of the house is decorated with Florentine vases. A monument on a nearby hill, visible from the house, was erected by Mary Anne in 1862 in memory of her father-in-law.

In May 2024 the house was the featured in an episode the BBC documentary series &quot;Hidden Treasures of the National Trust&quot;.

==Architecture and description==
The present house was built towards the end of the 18th century and was of a stuccoed and unassuming design. However, in 1862 the Disraelis had the house remodelled by the architect Edward Buckton Lamb. Lamb has been described as &quot;one of the most perverse and original of mid-Victorian architects&quot;. Architecturally, he had a strong interest in the eclectic; this interest is very apparent in his work at Hughenden. Under Lamb&#x27;s hand, classical Georgian features were swept away as he &quot;dramatised&quot; the house. Lamb worked in a hybrid baronial form of Gothic architecture, with exposed and angular juxtaposing brickwork surmounted by stepped battlements with diagonal pinnacles. The uppermost windows of the thirteen-bayed garden façade were given unusual pediments – appearing almost as machicolations. The architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner, in his highly critical appraisal of Lamb&#x27;s work at Hughenden, labels these &quot;window-heads&quot; as &quot;indescribable&quot; and Lamb&#x27;s overall Hughenden work as &quot;excruciating&quot;.

Pevsner clearly failed to appreciate what the delighted Disraeli described as the &quot;romance he had been many years realising&quot; while going to say that he imagined it was now &quot;restored to what it was before the civil war&quot;. As the house was not originally constructed until the middle of the 18th century, almost a century after the Civil War, that scenario would have been difficult.

The house is of three floors. The reception rooms are all on the ground floor, most with large plate glass windows (a Victorian innovation) giving onto the south-facing terrace overlooking a grassy parterre with views over the Hughenden Valley.

The west wing was built in 1910, long after Disraeli&#x27;s death, when the house was in the ownership of his nephew, the politician Coningsby Disraeli.

<text>Jean Augustine (born September 9, 1937) is a Grenada-born Canadian politician. She was the first Black Canadian woman to serve as a federal Minister of the Crown and Member of Parliament.

Prior to entering politics in 1993, Jean Augustine had a career in education. She enrolled in Toronto Teachers’ College, graduating with an Ontario teaching certificate in 1963. She went on to work as a teacher in the Toronto Catholic District School Board, eventually becoming a school principal.

From 1993 to 2006, Jean Augustine was elected as the Liberal Party of Canada&#x27;s member of the House of Commons of Canada for the riding (Federal Electoral District) of Etobicoke—Lakeshore in Toronto, Ontario. Ms. Augustine was the Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister Jean Chrétien from 1994 to 1996. She subsequently served as the Minister of State for Multiculturalism and the Status of Women in the Cabinet of Canada from 2002 to 2004.

Following her retirement from politics, she has served as the patron of several non-profit organizations across Canada. From 2007 to 2015, Ms. Augustine served as the first Fairness Commissioner of Ontario. 

==Early life and education==
Augustine was born on September 9th, 1937, in St. George&#x27;s, Grenada, and immigrated to Canada in 1960 under the West Indian Domestic Scheme, which ran from 1955 to 1966. She attended Toronto Teachers’ College before earning a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Toronto, and later, a Master of Education (1980), also from the University of Toronto while working as an elementary school teacher. Augustine was later promoted to principal, then Supervisory Officer.

In addition to her teaching career with the Catholic School board (Metropolitan Separate School Board) in Toronto, Augustine was also actively involved in Toronto&#x27;s Caribbean community, sitting on the first committee to organize the Caribana Festival in 1967.

As a social activist, Augustine volunteered and worked with many social justice and educational organizations. They included service with the National Black Coalition of Canada, the Urban Alliance on Race Relations (UARR). She was appointed as chair of the Metro Toronto Housing Authority. She was also named national president of the Congress of Black Women of Canada in 1987. 

Augustine served on various boards during this period, including York University&#x27;s Board of Governors, The Hospital for Sick Children, the Stephen Lewis Foundation and Toronto&#x27;s Harbourfront Corporation. 

In 1988, Augustine was appointed as chair of the Metro Toronto Housing Authority, a multi-million dollar social housing authority serving 300,000 residents in rent-geared to income housing.

== Political career (1993-2005) ==
In 1993, Jean Augustine became the first African-Canadian woman elected to Canada’s House of Commons, as the Member of Parliament from the Greater Toronto Area constituency of Etobicoke-Lakeshore. She served as a Liberal Member of Parliament for four consecutive terms, being re-elected three times.

Augustine held many portfolios and positions during her time as an elected member of Canada&#x27;s federal government, including as Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Jean Chrétien); Minister of Multiculturalism and the Status of Women; Chair of the Foreign Affairs and International Trade committee; Chair of the Human Rights Committee, three-time Chair of the National Women’s Caucus. In 2004, she was elected Assistant Deputy Speaker by her fellow parliamentarians.

Augustine&#x27;s parliamentarian achievements include legislation to protect disadvantaged low-income individuals including single mothers raising children; securing unanimous legislative support to pass a motion designating February as Black History Month in Canada; securing unanimous legislative support to pass a motion to erect the Famous Five Monument on Parliament Hill.

==Later life==
In 2007, the Government of Ontario appointed Augustine as the first Fairness Commissioner, a position created to advocate for Canadians with foreign professional credentials. Augustine retired from the position in March 2015.

In 2007, Augustine donated her personal papers and memorabilia to the Clara Thomas Archives and Special Collections at York University. The collection is known as the Jean Augustine Fonds. &quot;Pushing buttons, pushing stories&quot; is a digital exhibit of Augustine&#x27;s personal political buttons.

In 2008, the Jean Augustine Chair in Education in the New Urban Environment was established as an endowed chair at York University, with Prof. Nombuso Dlamini appointed the first chair (2010-15). The chair was renamed as the Jean Augustine Chair in Education, Community and Diaspora York University. In 2016, the present chair holder, Faculty of Education professor and Distinguished Research Professor, Carl E. James, was appointed for a five-year term, which was renewed. In 2023 the Jean Augustine Chair received funding from the federal government of Canada, making it a fully-funded endowed chair.

Augustine serves as the patron, visitor or honorary chair of a number of organizations, including the NATO Association of Canada.

<doc id="386508" wikidata="Q3777841" url="?curid=386508" title="Daliburgh">
<text>Daliburgh () is a crofting township on South Uist, in the Outer Hebrides, Scotland. Daliburgh is situated west from Lochboisdale, has the second largest population of any township in South Uist, and is also in the parish of South Uist. Daliburgh is situated at the junction of the A865 and the B888. Like Lochboisdale, Daliburgh has undergone major changes in recent years.

Ranald Macdonald, younger brother of Donald Macdonald 4th of Kinlochmoidart, was granted the tack of Daliburgh from the chief of Clanranald in 1730.

==Community==
The South End Community Hall on the northern edge of Daliburgh includes a fitness suite and indoor sports facilities.

Adjacent to the Borrodale Hotel a memorial commemorates the life and verse of Donald Allan MacDonald, a Gaelic bàrd (i.e. poet) and important figure in modern Scottish Gaelic literature who lived at Daliburgh during the mid 20th century.

===School===
Daliburgh School lost its first-year secondary class in 2009, and now offers primary schooling for ages 5 to 12, with an independent cròileagan (nursery/after-school club) next door

Daliburgh is well known for its annual summer music school, Ceòlas, which runs for one week every July in the local school and includes classes for both adults and children. Ceòlas also runs youth music classes throughout the year, and has a small office adjacent to the school itself.

===Churches===
The Church of Scotland has a large traditional 19th century church building, with attached hall and manse, at the junction by the Borrodale Hotel. Along the road to the west - strictly in the township of Cille Pheadair is the Roman Catholic Church of Saint Peter, with a public hall opposite used for a wide variety of functions, including public ceilidhs and dances, sales, private parties and so on.

==Economy==
Businesses located within the township include the Post Office, the Co-op supermarket, Borrodale Hotel (public internet access available), Scottish Hydro Electric shop, Burnside Fish and Chips and filling station, and the thrift shop (charity shop), which sells tea, coffee and food.

The Uist Travel Lodge and Bunkhouse opened in 2010, incorporating a cafe and gift shop in Uist House. The building was constructed in the 1970s, and was previously a care home.

A commercial office development, financed by Western Isles Enterprise, remained unoccupied for nearly ten years. Finally, in 2010, it was announced that the development would become the offices for Stòras Uibhist, the community-owned landlord of South Uist, Eriskay and much of Benbecula. The business had relocated from the old manse in Bornish.

===Services===
According to John Lorne Campbell, Sacred Heart hospital in Daliburgh was built in 1894 with money donated by philanthropist John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute, at the request of two South Uist Roman Catholic priests; important Gaelic Bard Fr. Allan MacDonald, alias (), of St Peter&#x27;s Church in Daliburgh and Fr John Mackintosh, alias &quot;The Big Priest of the Horses&quot; (), of St. Mary&#x27;s Church in Bornish.

The hospital was closed in 2000 and replaced by the newly built Uist and Barra Hospital in Benbecula. The old hospital has been converted into a care home for the elderly, now known as &quot;Taigh a&#x27; Chridhe Uile Naomh&quot;, retaining the original hospital as a part of the new. The building is a significant user of renewable energy, with ground source heat pumps and three wind turbines.

Near to &quot;Taigh a&#x27; Chridhe Uile Naomh&quot; is the South Uist Medical Centre, offering doctors consultations, practice nurses and pharmacy.

Also in Daliburgh there is a fire and rescue service station, which is manned by volunteers, and a small territorial army centre.

<text>Sydney Thompson Dobell (5 April 182422 August 1874) was an English poet and critic, and a member of the so-called Spasmodic school.

==Biography==
Dobell was born at Cranbrook, Kent. His father, John Dobell, was a wine merchant and his mother Julietta was a daughter of Samuel Thompson (1766–1837), a London political reformer. He was an older brother of the surgeon Horace Dobell. The family moved to Cheltenham when Dobell was twelve years old. He was educated privately, and never attended either school or university. He refers to this in some lines on Cheltenham College in imitation of Chaucer, written in his eighteenth year. After a five-year engagement he married, in 1844, Emily Fordham, a lady of good family. Acquaintance with James Stansfeld (subsequently Sir James Stansfeld) and with the Birmingham preacher-politician George Dawson fed the young enthusiast&#x27;s ardour for the liberalism of the day, and later led to the foundation of the Society of the Friends of Italy.

Meanwhile, Dobell wrote a number of minor poems, infused with a passionate desire for political reform. &quot;The Roman&quot; appeared in 1850, under the pen name of Sydney Yendys. Next year he travelled through Switzerland with his wife; and after his return he formed friendships with Robert Browning, Philip Bailey, George MacDonald, Emanuel Deutsch, Lord Houghton, Ruskin, Holman Hunt, Mazzini, Tennyson and Carlyle. His second long poem, &quot;Balder&quot;, appeared in 1854. The three following years were spent in Scotland. Dobell also wrote &quot;The Ballad of Keith of Ravelston&quot; and &quot;Tommy&#x27;s Dead&quot;.

Perhaps his closest friend at this time was Alexander Smith. Together they published, in 1855, a number of sonnets on the Crimean War, which were followed by a volume on &quot;England in Time of War&quot;. Although by no means a rich man he was always ready to help needy men of letters, and it was through his exertions that David Gray&#x27;s poems were published. In 1869 a horse, which he was riding, fell and rolled over with him. His health, which had for several years necessitated his wintering abroad, was seriously affected by this accident, and he was from this time more or less of an invalid until his death in Nailsworth, Gloucestershire.

==Poetry==
As a poet Dobell belongs to the Spasmodic school of poetry, as it was named by Professor Aytoun, who parodied its style in &quot;Firmilian: A Spasmodic Tragedy&quot;. The epithet, however, was first applied by Carlyle to Byron. The school includes George Gilfillan, Philip James Bailey, John Stanyan Bigg, Dobell, Alexander Smith, and, according to some critics, Gerald Massey. It was characterized by an under-current of discontent with the mystery of existence, by vain effort, unrewarded struggle, sceptical unrest, and an uneasy straining after the unattainable. It thus faithfully reflected a certain phase of 19th-century thought.

According to the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition:
==Religious and political views==
In his religious views, Dobell was a Christian of the broad church type; and socially he was one of the most amiable and true-hearted of men. Dobell also believed that religion was a personal struggle between a person and the spirituality that existed deep within their own psyche. His early interest in the cause of oppressed nationalities, shown in his friendship with Kossuth, Emanuel Deutsch and others, never lessened, although his views of home politics underwent some change from the radical opinions of his youth. In Gloucestershire, Dobell was well known as an advocate of social reform, and he was a pioneer in the application of the co-operative system of private enterprise.

==Deerhounds==
Sydney Dobell was also famous as an early breeder of deerhounds. One was given to him by Mr Ronald McDonald of Skye. She was supposed to be descended from the deerhounds of Cher Foreman McDonald. Later generations of his deerhounds were painted by Sydney Dobell&#x27;s brother-in-law, Briton Rivière, notably in &quot;The empty chair&quot;, which was first exhibited at the Dudley Gallery, London, in 1869. It was bought for a great deal of money by Howard Dobell, his uncle. It was owned in 1924 by Ralph Dobell, Brooklands, Cheltenham who lent it to an exhibition at Cheltenham Art Gallery &amp; Museum.

<text>Gerald Massey (; 29 May 1828 – 29 October 1907) was an English poet and writer on Spiritualism and Ancient Egypt.

==Early life==
Massey was born near Tring, Hertfordshire in England to poor parents. When little more than a child, he was made to work hard in a silk factory, which he afterward deserted for the equally laborious occupation of straw plaiting. These early years were rendered gloomy by much distress and deprivation, against which the young man strove with increasing spirit and virility, educating himself in his spare time, and gradually cultivating his innate taste for literary work. He was attracted by the movement known as Christian socialism, into which he threw himself with whole-hearted vigour, and so became associated with Frederick Denison Maurice and Charles Kingsley.

==Later life==

From about 1870 onwards, Massey became increasingly interested in Egyptology and the similarities that exist between ancient Egyptian mythology and the Gospel stories. He studied the extensive Egyptian records housed in the Assyrian and Egyptology section of the British Museum in London where he worked closely with the curator, Dr. Samuel Birch, and other leading Egyptologists of his day, even learning hieroglyphics at the time the Temple of Horus at Edfu was first being excavated.

==Writing career==

Massey&#x27;s first public appearance as a writer was in connection with a journal called the &quot;Spirit of Freedom&quot;, of which he became editor, and he was only twenty-two when he published his first volume of poems, &quot;Voices of Freedom and Lyrics of Love&quot; (1850). These he followed in rapid succession with &quot;The Ballad of Babe Christabel&quot; (1854), &quot;War Waits&quot; (1855), &quot;Havelock&#x27;s March&quot; (1860), and &quot;A Tale of Eternity&quot; (1869).

In 1889, Massey published a two-volume collection of his poems called &quot;My Lyrical Life&quot;. He also published works dealing with Spiritualism, the study of Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets (1872 and 1890), and theological speculation. It is generally understood that he was the original of George Eliot&#x27;s Felix Holt.

Massey&#x27;s poetry has a certain rough and vigorous element of sincerity and strength which easily accounts for its popularity at the time of its production. He treated the theme of Sir Richard Grenville before Tennyson thought of using it, with much force and vitality. Indeed, Tennyson&#x27;s own praise of Massey&#x27;s work is still its best eulogy, for the Laureate found in him a poet of fine lyrical impulse, and of a rich half-Oriental imagination. The inspiration of his poetry is a combination of his vast knowledge based on travels, research and experiences; he was a patriotic humanist to the core. His poem &quot;The Merry, Merry May&quot; was set to music in 1894 by the composer Cyril Rootham and then in a popular song by composer Christabel Baxendale.

Massey was a believer in spiritual evolution; he opined that Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution was incomplete without spiritualism:The theory contains only one half the explanation of man&#x27;s origins and needs spiritualism to carry it through and complete it. For while this ascent on the physical side has been progressing through myriads of ages, the Divine descent has also been going on – man being spiritually an incarnation from the Divine as well as a human development from the animal creation. The cause of the development is spiritual. Mr. Darwin&#x27;s theory does not in the least militate against ours – we think it necessitates it; he simply does not deal with our side of the subject. He can not go lower than the dust of the earth for the matter of life; and for us, the main interest of our origin must lie in the spiritual domain.

In regard to Ancient Egypt, Massey first published &quot;The Book of the Beginnings&quot;, followed by &quot;The Natural Genesis&quot;. His most important work is &quot;Ancient Egypt: The Light of the World&quot;, published shortly before his death.

Like Godfrey Higgins a half-century earlier, Massey believed that Western religions had Egyptian roots. Massey wrote,The human mind has long suffered an eclipse and been darkened and dwarfed in the shadow of ideas the real meaning of which has been lost to moderns. Myths and allegories whose significance was once unfolded in the Mysteries have been adopted in ignorance and reissued as real truths directly and divinely vouchsafed to humanity for the first and only time! The early religions had their myths interpreted. We have ours misinterpreted. And a great deal of what has been imposed on us as God’s own true and sole revelation to us is a mass of inverted myths.

One of the more important aspects of Massey&#x27;s writings were his assertions that there were parallels between Jesus and the Egyptian god Horus, primarily contained in the book &quot;The Natural Genesis&quot; first published in 1883. Massey, for example, argued in the book his belief that: both Horus and Jesus were born of virgins on 25 December, raised men from the dead (Massey speculates that the biblical Lazarus, raised from the dead by Jesus, has a parallel in &quot;El-Asar-Us&quot;, a title of Osiris), died by crucifixion and were resurrected three days later. These assertions have influenced various later writers such as Alvin Boyd Kuhn, Tom Harpur, Yosef Ben-Jochannan, and Dorothy M. Murdock. Christian ignorance notwithstanding, the Gnostic Jesus is the Egyptian Horus who was continued by the various sects of gnostics under both the names of Horus and of Jesus. In the gnostic iconography of the Roman Catacombs child-Horus reappears as the mummy-babe who wears the solar disc. The royal Horus is represented in the cloak of royalty, and the phallic emblem found there witnesses to Jesus being Horus of the resurrection.

==Criticism==
Christian theologian W. Ward Gasque, a PhD from Harvard and Manchester University, sent emails to twenty Egyptologists that he considered leaders of the field – including Kenneth Kitchen of the University of Liverpool and Ron Leprohon of the University of Toronto – in Canada, the United States, Britain, Australia, Germany and Austria to verify academic support for some of these assertions. His primary targets were Tom Harpur, Alvin Boyd Kuhn and the Christ myth theory, and only indirectly Massey. Ten out of twenty responded, but most were not named. According to Gasque, Massey&#x27;s work, which draws comparisons between the Judeo-Christian religion and the Egyptian religion, is not considered significant in the field of modern Egyptology and is not mentioned in the &quot;Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt&quot; or similar reference works of modern Egyptology. Gasque reports that those who responded were unanimous in dismissing the proposed etymologies for Jesus and Christ, and one unspecified Egyptologist referred to Alvin Boyd Kuhn&#x27;s comparison as &quot;fringe nonsense.&quot; However, Harpur&#x27;s response to Gasque quotes leading contemporary Egyptologist Erik Hornung that there are parallels between Christianity and ancient Egypt, as do the writings of biblical expert Thomas L. Thompson.

Theologian Stanley E. Porter has pointed out that Massey&#x27;s analogies include a number of errors. For example, Massey stated that 25 December as the date of birth of Jesus was selected based on the birth of Horus, but the New Testament does not include any reference to the date or season of the birth of Jesus. The earliest known source recognizing 25 December as the date of birth of Jesus is by Hippolytus of Rome, written around the beginning of the 3rd century, based on the assumption that the conception of Jesus took place at the Spring equinox. Hippolytus placed the equinox on 25 March and then added 9 months to get 25 December, thus establishing the date for festivals. The Roman Chronography of 354 then included an early reference to the celebration of a Nativity feast in December, as of the fourth century. Porter states that Massey&#x27;s serious historical errors often render his works nonsensical. For example, Massey states that the biblical references to Herod the Great were based on the myth of &quot;Herrut&quot; the evil hydra serpent, while the existence of Herod the Great can be well established without reliance on Christian sources.

<text>The history of computing is longer than the history of computing hardware and modern computing technology and includes the history of methods intended for pen and paper or for chalk and slate, with or without the aid of tables.

==Concrete devices==
Digital computing is intimately tied to the representation of numbers. But long before abstractions like &quot;the number&quot; arose, there were mathematical concepts to serve the purposes of civilization. These concepts are implicit in concrete practices such as:
*&quot;One-to-one correspondence&quot;, a rule to count &quot;how many&quot; items, e.g. on a tally stick, eventually abstracted into &quot;numbers&quot;.
*&quot;Comparison to a standard&quot;, a method for assuming &quot;reproducibility&quot; in a measurement, for example, the number of coins.
*The &quot;3-4-5&quot; right triangle was a device for assuring a &quot;right angle&quot;, using ropes with 12 evenly spaced knots, for example.

==Numbers==
Eventually, the concept of numbers became concrete and familiar enough for counting to arise, at times with sing-song mnemonics to teach sequences to others. All known human languages, except the Piraha language, have words for at least the numerals &quot;one&quot; and &quot;two&quot;, and even some animals like the blackbird can distinguish a surprising number of items.

Advances in the numeral system and mathematical notation eventually led to the discovery of mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, squaring, square root, and so forth. Eventually, the operations were formalized, and concepts about the operations became understood well enough to be stated formally, and even proven. See, for example, Euclid&#x27;s algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers.

By the High Middle Ages, the positional Hindu–Arabic numeral system had reached Europe, which allowed for the systematic computation of numbers. During this period, the representation of a calculation on paper allowed the calculation of mathematical expressions, and the tabulation of mathematical functions such as the square root and the common logarithm (for use in multiplication and division), and the trigonometric functions. By the time of Isaac Newton&#x27;s research, paper or vellum was an important computing resource, and even in our present time, researchers like Enrico Fermi would cover random scraps of paper with calculation, to satisfy their curiosity about an equation. Even into the period of programmable calculators, Richard Feynman would unhesitatingly compute any steps that overflowed the memory of the calculators, by hand, just to learn the answer; by 1976 Feynman had purchased an HP-25 calculator with a 49 program-step capacity; if a differential equation required more than 49 steps to solve, he could just continue his computation by hand.

==Early computation==
Mathematical statements need not be abstract only; when a statement can be illustrated with actual numbers, the numbers can be communicated and a community can arise. This allows the repeatable, verifiable statements which are the hallmark of mathematics and science. These kinds of statements have existed for thousands of years, and across multiple civilizations, as shown below:

The earliest known tool for use in computation is the Sumerian abacus, and it was thought to have been invented in Babylon –2300 BC. Its original style of usage was by lines drawn in sand with pebbles.

In –771 BC, the south-pointing chariot was invented in ancient China. It was the first known geared mechanism to use a differential gear, which was later used in analog computers. The Chinese also invented a more sophisticated abacus from around the 2nd century BC known as the Chinese abacus.

In the 3rd century BC, Archimedes used the mechanical principle of balance (see ) to calculate mathematical problems, such as the number of grains of sand in the universe (&quot;The sand reckoner&quot;), which also required a recursive notation for numbers (e.g., the myriad myriad).

The Antikythera mechanism is believed to be the earliest known geared computing device. It was designed to calculate astronomical positions. It was discovered in 1901 in the Antikythera wreck off the Greek island of Antikythera, between Kythera and Crete, and has been dated to &quot;circa&quot; 100 BC.

According to Simon Singh, Muslim mathematicians also made important advances in cryptography, such as the development of cryptanalysis and frequency analysis by Alkindus. Programmable machines were also invented by Muslim engineers, such as the automatic flute player by the Banū Mūsā brothers.

During the Middle Ages, several European philosophers made attempts to produce analog computer devices. Influenced by the Arabs and Scholasticism, Majorcan philosopher Ramon Llull (1232–1315) devoted a great part of his life to defining and designing several &quot;logical machines&quot; that, by combining simple and undeniable philosophical truths, could produce all possible knowledge. These machines were never actually built, as they were more of a thought experiment to produce new knowledge in systematic ways; although they could make simple logical operations, they still needed a human being for the interpretation of results. Moreover, they lacked a versatile architecture, each machine serving only very concrete purposes. Despite this, Llull&#x27;s work had a strong influence on Gottfried Leibniz (early 18th century), who developed his ideas further and built several calculating tools using them.

The apex of this early era of mechanical computing can be seen in the Difference Engine and its successor the Analytical Engine both by Charles Babbage. Babbage never completed constructing either engine, but in 2002 Doron Swade and a group of other engineers at the Science Museum in London completed Babbage&#x27;s Difference Engine using only materials that would have been available in the 1840s. By following Babbage&#x27;s detailed design they were able to build a functioning engine, allowing historians to say, with some confidence, that if Babbage had been able to complete his Difference Engine it would have worked. The additionally advanced Analytical Engine combined concepts from his previous work and that of others to create a device that, if constructed as designed, would have possessed many properties of a modern electronic computer, such as an internal &quot;scratch memory&quot; equivalent to RAM, multiple forms of output including a bell, a graph-plotter, and simple printer, and a programmable input-output &quot;hard&quot; memory of punch cards which it could modify as well as read. The key advancement that Babbage&#x27;s devices possessed beyond those created before him was that each component of the device was independent of the rest of the machine, much like the components of a modern electronic computer. This was a fundamental shift in thought; previous computational devices served only a single purpose but had to be at best disassembled and reconfigured to solve a new problem. Babbage&#x27;s devices could be reprogrammed to solve new problems by the entry of new data and act upon previous calculations within the same series of instructions. Ada Lovelace took this concept one step further, by creating a program for the Analytical Engine to calculate Bernoulli numbers, a complex calculation requiring a recursive algorithm. This is considered to be the first example of a true computer program, a series of instructions that act upon data not known in full until the program is run.

Following Babbage, although unaware of his earlier work, Percy Ludgate in 1909 published the 2nd of the only two designs for mechanical analytical engines in history. Two other inventors, Leonardo Torres Quevedo and Vannevar Bush, also did follow-on research based on Babbage&#x27;s work. In his &quot;Essays on Automatics&quot; (1914) Torres presented the design of an electromechanical calculating machine and introduced the idea of Floating-point arithmetic. In 1920, to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the invention of the arithmometer, Torres presented in Paris the Electromechanical Arithmometer, an arithmetic unit connected to a remote typewriter, on which commands could be typed and the results printed automatically. Bush&#x27;s paper &quot;Instrumental Analysis&quot; (1936) discussed using existing IBM punch card machines to implement Babbage&#x27;s design. In the same year, he started the Rapid Arithmetical Machine project to investigate the problems of constructing an electronic digital computer.

Several examples of analog computation survived into recent times. A planimeter is a device that does integrals, using distance as the analog quantity. Until the 1980s, HVAC systems used air both as the analog quantity and the controlling element. Unlike modern digital computers, analog computers are not very flexible and need to be reconfigured (i.e., reprogrammed) manually to switch them from working on one problem to another. Analog computers had an advantage over early digital computers in that they could be used to solve complex problems using behavioral analogues while the earliest attempts at digital computers were quite limited.
Since computers were rare in this era, the solutions were often &quot;hard-coded&quot; into paper forms such as nomograms, which could then produce analog solutions to these problems, such as the distribution of pressures and temperatures in a heating system.

==Digital electronic computers==

In an 1886 letter, Charles Sanders Peirce described how logical operations could be carried out by electrical switching circuits. During 1880-81 he showed that NOR gates alone (or NAND gates alone) can be used to reproduce the functions of all the other logic gates, but this work on it was unpublished until 1933. The first published proof was by Henry M. Sheffer in 1913, so the NAND logical operation is sometimes called Sheffer stroke; the logical NOR is sometimes called &quot;Peirce&#x27;s arrow&quot;. Consequently, these gates are sometimes called &quot;universal logic gates&quot;.

Eventually, vacuum tubes replaced relays for logic operations. Lee De Forest&#x27;s modification, in 1907, of the Fleming valve can be used as a logic gate. Ludwig Wittgenstein introduced a version of the 16-row truth table as proposition 5.101 of &quot;Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus&quot; (1921). Walther Bothe, inventor of the coincidence circuit, got part of the 1954 Nobel Prize in physics, for the first modern electronic AND gate in 1924. Konrad Zuse designed and built electromechanical logic gates for his computer Z1 (from 1935 to 1938).

The first recorded idea of using digital electronics for computing was the 1931 paper &quot;The Use of Thyratrons for High Speed Automatic Counting of Physical Phenomena&quot; by C. E. Wynn-Williams. From 1934 to 1936, NEC engineer Akira Nakashima, Claude Shannon, and Victor Shestakov published papers introducing switching circuit theory, using digital electronics for Boolean algebraic operations.

In 1936 Alan Turing published his seminal paper On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem in which he modeled computation in terms of a one-dimensional storage tape, leading to the idea of the Universal Turing machine and Turing-complete systems.

The first digital electronic computer was developed in the period April 1936 - June 1939, in the IBM Patent Department, Endicott, New York by Arthur Halsey Dickinson. In this computer IBM introduced, a calculating device with a keyboard, processor and electronic output (display). The competitor to IBM was the digital electronic computer NCR3566, developed in NCR, Dayton, Ohio by Joseph Desch and Robert Mumma in the period April 1939 - August 1939. The IBM and NCR machines were decimal, executing addition and subtraction in binary position code.

In December 1939 John Atanasoff and Clifford Berry completed their experimental model to prove the concept of the Atanasoff–Berry computer (ABC) which began development in 1937. This experimental model is binary, executed addition and subtraction in octal binary code and is the first binary digital electronic computing device. The Atanasoff–Berry computer was intended to solve systems of linear equations, though it was not programmable. The computer was never truly completed due to Atanasoff&#x27;s departure from Iowa State University in 1942 to work for the United States Navy. Many people credit ABC with many of the ideas used in later developments during the age of early electronic computing. 

The Z3 computer, built by German inventor Konrad Zuse in 1941, was the first programmable, fully automatic computing machine, but it was not electronic.

During World War II, ballistics computing was done by women, who were hired as &quot;computers.&quot; The term computer remained one that referred to mostly women (now seen as &quot;operator&quot;) until 1945, after which it took on the modern definition of machinery it presently holds.

The ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer) was the first electronic general-purpose computer, announced to the public in 1946. It was Turing-complete, digital, and capable of being reprogrammed to solve a full range of computing problems. Women implemented the programming for machines like the ENIAC, and men created the hardware.

The Manchester Baby was the first electronic stored-program computer. It was built at the Victoria University of Manchester by Frederic C. Williams, Tom Kilburn and Geoff Tootill, and ran its first program on 21 June 1948.

William Shockley, John Bardeen and Walter Brattain at Bell Labs invented the first working transistor, the point-contact transistor, in 1947, followed by the bipolar junction transistor in 1948. At the University of Manchester in 1953, a team under the leadership of Tom Kilburn designed and built the first transistorized computer, called the Transistor Computer, a machine using the newly developed transistors instead of valves. The first stored-program transistor computer was the ETL Mark III, developed by Japan&#x27;s Electrotechnical Laboratory from 1954 to 1956. However, early junction transistors were relatively bulky devices that were difficult to manufacture on a mass-production basis, which limited them to a number of specialized applications.

In 1954, 95% of computers in service were being used for engineering and scientific purposes.

===Personal computers===
The metal–oxide–silicon field-effect transistor (MOSFET), also known as the MOS transistor, was invented at Bell Labs between 1955 and 1960, It was the first truly compact transistor that could be miniaturised and mass-produced for a wide range of uses. The MOSFET made it possible to build high-density integrated circuit chips. The MOSFET is the most widely used transistor in computers, and is the fundamental building block of digital electronics.

The silicon-gate MOS integrated circuit was developed by Federico Faggin at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1968. This led to the development of the first single-chip microprocessor, the Intel 4004. The Intel 4004 was developed as a single-chip microprocessor from 1969 to 1970, led by Intel&#x27;s Federico Faggin, Marcian Hoff, and Stanley Mazor, and Busicom&#x27;s Masatoshi Shima. The chip was mainly designed and realized by Faggin, with his silicon-gate MOS technology. The microprocessor led to the microcomputer revolution, with the development of the microcomputer, which would later be called the personal computer (PC).

Most early microprocessors, such as the Intel 8008 and Intel 8080, were 8-bit. Texas Instruments released the first fully 16-bit microprocessor, the TMS9900 processor, in June 1976. They used the microprocessor in the TI-99/4 and TI-99/4A computers.

The 1980s brought about significant advances with microprocessors that greatly impacted the fields of engineering and other sciences. The Motorola 68000 microprocessor had a processing speed that was far superior to the other microprocessors being used at the time. Because of this, having a newer, faster microprocessor allowed for the newer microcomputers that came along after to be more efficient in the amount of computing they were able to do. This was evident in the 1983 release of the Apple Lisa. The Lisa was one of the first personal computers with a graphical user interface (GUI) that was sold commercially. It ran on the Motorola 68000 CPU and used both dual floppy disk drives and a 5 MB hard drive for storage. The machine also had 1MB of RAM used for running software from disk without rereading the disk persistently. After the failure of the Lisa in terms of sales, Apple released its first Macintosh computer, still running on the Motorola 68000 microprocessor, but with only 128KB of RAM, one floppy drive, and no hard drive to lower the price.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, computers became more useful for personal and work purposes, such as word processing. In 1989, Apple released the Macintosh Portable, it weighed and was extremely expensive, costing US$7,300. At launch, it was one of the most powerful laptops available, but due to the price and weight, it was not met with great success and was discontinued only two years later. That same year Intel introduced the Touchstone Delta supercomputer, which had 512 microprocessors. This technological advancement was very significant, as it was used as a model for some of the fastest multi-processor systems in the world. It was even used as a prototype for Caltech researchers, who used the model for projects like real-time processing of satellite images and simulating molecular models for various fields of research.

=== Supercomputers ===
In terms of supercomputing, the first widely acknowledged supercomputer was the Control Data Corporation (CDC) 6600 built in 1964 by Seymour Cray. Its maximum speed was 40  MHz or 3 million floating point operations per second (FLOPS). The CDC 6600 was replaced by the CDC 7600 in 1969; although its normal clock speed was not faster than the 6600, the 7600 was still faster due to its peak clock speed, which was approximately 30 times faster than that of the 6600. Although CDC was a leader in supercomputers, their relationship with Seymour Cray (which had already been deteriorating) completely collapsed. In 1972, Cray left CDC and began his own company, Cray Research Inc. With support from investors in Wall Street, an industry fueled by the Cold War, and without the restrictions he had within CDC, he created the Cray-1 supercomputer. With a clock speed of 80  MHz or 136 megaFLOPS, Cray developed a name for himself in the computing world. By 1982, Cray Research produced the Cray X-MP equipped with multiprocessing and in 1985 released the Cray-2, which continued with the trend of multiprocessing and clocked at 1.9 gigaFLOPS. Cray Research developed the Cray Y-MP in 1988, however afterward struggled to continue to produce supercomputers. This was largely because the Cold War had ended, and the demand for cutting-edge computing by colleges and the government declined drastically and the demand for microprocessing units increased.

In 1998, David Bader developed the first Linux supercomputer using commodity parts. While at the University of New Mexico, Bader sought to build a supercomputer running Linux using consumer off-the-shelf parts and a high-speed low-latency interconnection network. The prototype utilized an Alta Technologies &quot;AltaCluster&quot; of eight dual, 333  MHz, Intel Pentium II computers running a modified Linux kernel. Bader ported a significant amount of software to provide Linux support for necessary components as well as code from members of the National Computational Science Alliance (NCSA) to ensure interoperability, as none of it had been run on Linux previously. Using the successful prototype design, he led the development of &quot;RoadRunner,&quot; the first Linux supercomputer for open use by the national science and engineering community via the National Science Foundation&#x27;s National Technology Grid. RoadRunner was put into production use in April 1999. At the time of its deployment, it was considered one of the 100 fastest supercomputers in the world. Though Linux-based clusters using consumer-grade parts, such as Beowulf, existed before the development of Bader&#x27;s prototype and RoadRunner, they lacked the scalability, bandwidth, and parallel computing capabilities to be considered &quot;true&quot; supercomputers.

Today, supercomputers are still used by the governments of the world and educational institutions for computations such as simulations of natural disasters, genetic variant searches within a population relating to disease, and more. , the fastest supercomputer is Frontier.

==Navigation and astronomy==

Starting with known special cases, the calculation of logarithms and trigonometric functions can be performed by looking up numbers in a mathematical table, and interpolating between known cases. For small enough differences, this linear operation was accurate enough for use in navigation and astronomy in the Age of Exploration. The uses of interpolation have thrived in the past 500 years: by the twentieth century Leslie Comrie and W.J. Eckert systematized the use of interpolation in tables of numbers for punch card calculation.

==Weather prediction==

The numerical solution of differential equations, notably the Navier-Stokes equations was an important stimulus to computing,
with Lewis Fry Richardson&#x27;s numerical approach to solving differential equations. The first computerized weather forecast was performed in 1950 by a team composed of American meteorologists Jule Charney, Philip Duncan Thompson, Larry Gates, and Norwegian meteorologist Ragnar Fjørtoft, applied mathematician John von Neumann, and ENIAC programmer Klara Dan von Neumann. To this day, some of the most powerful computer systems on Earth are used for weather forecasts.

==Symbolic computations==

By the late 1960s, computer systems could perform symbolic algebraic manipulations well enough to pass college-level calculus courses.

== Important women and their contributions ==

Women are often underrepresented in STEM fields when compared to their male counterparts. In the modern era before the 1960s, computing was widely seen as &quot;women&#x27;s work&quot; since it was associated with the operation of tabulating machines and other mechanical office work. The accuracy of this association varied from place to place. In America, Margaret Hamilton recalled an environment dominated by men, while Elsie Shutt recalled surprise at seeing even half of the computer operators at Raytheon were men. Machine operators in Britain were mostly women into the early 1970s. As these perceptions changed and computing became a high-status career, the field became more dominated by men. Professor Janet Abbate, in her book &quot;Recoding Gender&quot;, writes:Yet women were a significant presence in the early decades of computing. They made up the majority of the first computer programmers during World War II; they held positions of responsibility and influence in the early computer industry; and they were employed in numbers that, while a small minority of the total, compared favorably with women&#x27;s representation in many other areas of science and engineering. Some female programmers of the 1950s and 1960s would have scoffed at the notion that programming would ever be considered a masculine occupation, yet these women’s experiences and contributions were forgotten all too quickly.

Some notable examples of women in the history of computing are:
* Ada Lovelace: wrote the addendum to Babbage&#x27;s Analytical Machine. Detailing, in poetic style, the first computer algorithm; a description of exactly how The Analytical Machine should have worked based on its design.
* Grace Murray Hopper: a pioneer of computing. She worked alongside Howard H. Aiken on IBM&#x27;s Mark I. Hopper and also came up with the term &quot;debugging.&quot;
* Hedy Lamarr: invented a &quot;frequency hopping&quot; technology that the Navy used during World War II to control torpedoes via radio signals. This same technology is also used today in creating Bluetooth and Wi-Fi signals.
* Frances Elizabeth &quot;Betty&quot; Holberton: invented &quot;breakpoints&quot; which are mini pauses put into lines of computer code to help programmers easily detect, troubleshoot, and solve problems.
*The women who originally programmed the ENIAC: Kay McNulty, Betty Jennings, Marlyn Meltzer, Fran Bilas, Ruth Lichterman, and Betty Holberton (see above.)
* Jean E. Sammet: co-designed COBOL, a widely used programming language.
* Frances Allen: computer scientist and pioneer in the field of optimizing compilers, first woman to win the Turing Award.
* Karen Spärck Jones: responsible for &quot;inverse document frequency&quot; - a concept that is most commonly used by search engines.
* Dana Angluin: made fundamental contributions to computational learning theory.
* Margaret Hamilton: the director of the Software Engineering Division at MIT, which developed on-board flight software for the Apollo&#x27;s Missions to Space.
* Barbara Liskov: developed the &quot;Liskov substitution principle.&quot;
* Radia Perlman: invented the &quot;Spanning Tree Protocol&quot;, a key network protocol used in Ethernet networks.
*Stephanie &quot;Steve&quot; Shirley: started F International, a highly successful freelance software company.
*Sophie Wilson: helped design ARM processor architecture widely used in many products such as smartphones and video games.
*Ann Hardy: pioneered computer time-sharing systems.
*Lynn Conway: revolutionised microchip design and production by co-introducing structured VLSI design among other inventions.
*The women at Bletchley Park: around 8,000 women who worked in numerous capacities with British cryptanalysis during World War II. Many came from the Women&#x27;s Royal Naval Service (who were called &quot;wrens&quot;) as well as the Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Air Force (&quot;WAAFs.&quot;) They were instrumental in cracking the &quot;Enigma&quot; cipher and helping the Allies win the war.

<doc id="386522" wikidata="Q2847182" url="?curid=386522" title="André Bachand (Progressive Conservative MP)">
<text>André Bachand (born December 8, 1961) is a Canadian politician who represented the riding of Richmond—Arthabaska as member of the Progressive Conservatives from 1997 to 2003.

When the PC Party was merged with the Canadian Alliance into the Conservative Party in December 2003, Bachand declined to join the CPC and sat as an &quot;Independent Progressive Conservative&quot; until the 2004 election, when he retired from the House of Commons.

Born in Quebec City, Quebec, Bachand has been an administrator, and a business executive. He was the mayor of Asbestos, Quebec, from 1986 to 1997, and was the Préfet of the MRC d&#x27;Asbestos from 1987 to 1997.

==Federal politics==
===Young Turk===
Bachand was first elected as a member of the Progressive Conservative Party in 1997, one of five PC MPs elected that year in Quebec. Bachand was one of a handful of new &quot;Young Turk&quot; PC MPs (along with Scott Brison, John Herron and Peter MacKay) who were considered the future youthful leadership material that would restore the ailing Tories to their glory days. In 1998, Jean Charest stepped down as federal Progressive Conservative leader to move to Quebec provincial politics, becoming leader of the federalist Quebec Liberal Party (unaffiliated with the Liberal Party of Canada). Bachand was one of many who unsuccessfully tried to convince Charest to remain in federal politics for at least one more election. Former Prime Minister Joe Clark succeeded Charest as leader of the PC Party and Bachand was supportive of Clark&#x27;s candidacy.

===Difficult times===
The Quebec-wing of the federal PC parliamentary caucus wrestled with several internal policy issues in the late 1990s after Charest&#x27;s departure, including with respect to bilingualism policies and the autonomy of provinces relative to the federal government. Shortly after Joe Clark was elected leader of the federal Tory Party, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs Stéphane Dion brought forward the Clarity Act on behalf of the government. The Clarity Act detailed specifically how the province of Quebec could separate and under what conditions a separation could be legal. Clark and seven other PC MPs chose to support Bachand and the Quebec PC MPs in opposing the Clarity Act, while the remaining PC MPs voted in favour of the Bill regardless of Clark&#x27;s stance.

===Quebec lieutenant===
By 1999, Bachand had emerged as the nominal Quebec lieutenant of the Conservatives, attending most PC events in the province with Clark and acting as the party&#x27;s chief spokesman for Quebec issues. Bachand was also the chief responder to the multiple defections of Quebec Tory party officials, MPs, and senators to the Liberal Party and Canadian Alliance during this period. In September 2000, three Quebec PC MPs, fearful of their re-election prospects under Clark&#x27;s leadership, crossed the floor shortly before the federal election to sit as Liberal MPs, leaving Bachand as the only remaining PC MP in Quebec. He was subsequently re-elected in the 2000 election, as were all three of the MPs who crossed the floor. Twelve Tory MPs won election in 2000, just enough for the party to retain official party status.

===Deputy leader===
In February 2003, Bachand announced his candidacy for the leadership of the Progressive Conservatives. However, on May 12, he announced that he was dropping out of the race and supporting Peter MacKay. Bachand had been running fifth in the race, and had failed to gather support among party delegates and to raise enough money for his campaign. After MacKay&#x27;s victory, Bachand briefly served as Deputy Leader of the Progressive Conservatives until early December 2003. Before becoming deputy leader, Bachand served as the deputy house leader of the Progressive Conservative Party, as well as its critic for the Intergovernmental Affairs, Industry, Science Research and Development, and the Deputy Prime Minister portfolios.

===Lone independent===
When the party merged with the Canadian Alliance at the end of 2003, Bachand announced that he would retire from politics. Bachand did not sit with the new Conservative Party of Canada Caucus, and became an independent MP until the June 2004 election. During the June 2004 election, Bachand endorsed the Liberal candidate in the Richmond—Arthabaska race over the Conservative and Bloc Québécois challengers. In the event, the BQ won fifty-four of Quebec&#x27;s seventy-five seats, including Richmond—Arthabaska, where André Bellavance won.

Bachand&#x27;s departure from federal politics has been lamented by many Tories hailing from Quebec. In a &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; article covering the March 2005 founding policy convention of the new Conservative Party, Senator Pierre Claude Nolin mused that if Bachand had remained elected and participatory in the new party, he may served as the new Conservative Party&#x27;s chief Quebec lieutenant as part of Stephen Harper&#x27;s attempts to woo Quebec voters.

===Return to politics===
In September 2008, Bachand announced that he would be the Conservative Party candidate for the district of Sherbrooke in the 40th Canadian feneral election. On election night, Bachand&#x27;s comeback attempt was unsuccessful. He lost to Bloc Québécois incumbent Serge Cardin, finishing third with 16.4% of the vote.

Shortly after his election defeat, Bachand accepted an appointment from Harper as Canada&#x27;s ambassador to UNESCO in Paris. As ambassador, Bachand&#x27;s most high-profile activity was to oppose, on the Canadian government&#x27;s behalf, the entry of the Palestinian Authority to membership in the organization.

In October 2011, Harper appointed Bachand as his senior advisor on Quebec issues. The post, which previously had been combined with responsibility for being Harper&#x27;s communications advisor, was reportedly separated from other responsibilities in order to make space for Bachand.

In 2013, &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; included Bachand as one of the thirteen members of Harper&#x27;s &quot;inner circle,&quot; of most-trusted advisors, tasked &quot;to try to improve Conservative fortunes in Quebec.&quot;

In September 2013, Bachand was hired by the Earnscliffe Strategy Group, an Ottawa public-affairs firm.

==Provincial politics==
Bachand ran for the Coalition Avenir Québec in the riding of Richmond, going on to win in the 2018 provincial election.

<text>John Churton Collins (26 March 1848 – 15 September 1908) was a British literary critic.

==Biography==
Churton Collins was born at Bourton-on-the-Water, Gloucestershire, England. From King Edward&#x27;s School, Birmingham, he went to Balliol College, Oxford, where he graduated in 1872, and at once devoted himself to a literary career, as journalist, essayist and lecturer. His first book was a study of Sir Joshua Reynolds (1874), and later he edited various classical English writers, and published volumes on Bolingbroke and Voltaire in England (1886), &quot;The Study of English Literature&quot; (1891), a study of Dean Swift (1893), &quot;Essays and Studies&quot; (1895), &quot;Ephemera Critica&quot; (1901), &quot;Essays in Poetry and Criticism&quot; (1905), and Rousseau and Voltaire (1908), his original essays being sharply controversial in tone, but full of knowledge.

In 1904 he became professor of English literature at Birmingham University. For many years he was a prominent University Extension lecturer, and a constant contributor to the principal reviews. On 15 September 1908 he was found dead in a ditch near Lowestoft, Suffolk, at which place he had been staying with a doctor for the benefit of his health. The circumstances necessitated the holding of an inquest, the verdict being that of accidental death.

==Criticism==
Lord Tennyson, a target of Collins&#x27; pen, referred to him as &quot;a louse in the locks of literature&quot;.

<doc id="386531" wikidata="Q2180916" url="?curid=386531" title="Kilroot">
<text>Kilroot () is a townland, population centre and civil parish in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. It lies to the east of Eden, on the outskirts of Carrickfergus on the northern shore of Belfast Lough. It is within the Mid and East Antrim area.

==History==
According to Archbishop Usher, a church was built in Kilroot in 412 AD.

==Places of interest==

The Round House, known locally as Dean Swift&#x27;s house, is likely to date from the eighteenth century fashion of Romantic cottages. Its diminutive appearance was deceiving as the ground floor contained a parlour by . It was a white limewashed thatched cottage unique in its construction without corners. The four straight sections of wall did not join at right angles but were joined by curved sections to form one continuous exterior wall. Swift was reputed by local lore to have said that the devil would never catch him in a corner. The building was demolished in 1959 after a fire, and the site as well as the adjacent Kilroot railway station has disappeared under the new power station.

Kilroot power station is owned by AES Corporation and is the only remaining coal-fired power station in Northern Ireland; it once provided about one third of electricity supplies for Northern Ireland. AES has recently announced plans to add on a gas fired generator which would approximately double the electricity output of Kilroot.

There is also a network of rock salt (halite) mines in Kilroot which stretch for approximately underneath Kilroot, Eden and the Carrickfergus East Division. The salt mined here is used to grit Northern Ireland&#x27;s road surfaces in the winter, as well as being sold to Scotland and England for the same purpose.

Kilroot is home to the Kilroot Business Park, located adjacent to the power station.

==People==
Saint Colmán of Kilroot was a sixth-century Irish disciple of Saint Ailbe of Emly and was bishop of Kilroot, at the same time as being a Benedictine abbot. St. Colman&#x27;s Church of Ireland parish church, located near Kilroot, is dedicated to Saint Colmán.

Jonathan Swift lived in Kilroot as a prebend for the local church, from March 1695 to May 1696. A ward in St Patrick&#x27;s University Hospital is named after the village.

<text>Castlethorpe is a village and civil parish with a population of about 1000 in the unitary authority area of the City of Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, England. It is about north-east of Stony Stratford, north-west of Newport Pagnell and north of Central Milton Keynes. It is separated from the county of Northamptonshire by the River Tove.

==History==

The village is relatively more recent than those around it, and it started out in life as a castle belonging to the lord of the manor of nearby Hanslope.
A settlement of servants and manual workers grew up around the castle and this became the village of Castlethorpe (&quot;thorpe&quot; is an Old Norse language (particularly Danish) word for &quot;homestead&quot;, and it is not unreasonable to assume that there may well have been a Danish settlement nearby as the area was, if not part of, certainly close to, the Danelaw). The castle was damaged in 1215 in a feud between Foulkes de Brent who had been sent by King John and William Mauduit, the castle&#x27;s owner. Mauduit was reputedly in rebellion against the King. Although Mauduit returned to claim his seat after the King&#x27;s death, the castle was demolished shortly afterward. All that is left today are the grassy mounds of the former Motte-and-Bailey castle. 

Multi-dwelling fires in the village have been reported in local media, notably those of 1899 and especially 1905 (when 13 cottages were destroyed, leaving 36 people homeless).

===Listed buildings and structures===
The parish has one scheduled ancient monument, one grade I listed building, and twenty grade II.

==Ecclesiastic parish==
Church of St Simon and St Jude, the parish church, is dedicated to St Simon and St Jude, and possibly dates back to Anglo-Saxon times: although no evidence of a pre-Norman building survives, its existence has been conjectured from the structure of the north arcade. In 1350, the nave was widened and the chancel rebuilt. The church at Castlethorpe was originally superior to that of Hanslope but Bishop Grosteste changed the precedence in about 1250. Castlethorpe has grown up around the church and some traditional old stone cottages at the centre of the village which is designated a conservation area.

==Rail and canal==

The West Coast Main Line runs alongside the west side of Castlethorpe, and the village had its own railway station until September 1964 when, to the outrage of the village, it was closed down.

The Grand Union Canal also runs by on the outskirts of the village, and it is a short walk along the towpath to the neighbouring village of Cosgrove in Northamptonshire.

<doc id="386535" wikidata="Q7090372" url="?curid=386535" title="Omnibus spending bill">
<text>An omnibus spending bill is a type of bill in the United States that packages many of the smaller ordinary appropriations bills into one larger single bill that can be passed with only one vote in each house of Congress. There are twelve different ordinary appropriations bills that need to be passed each year (one for each appropriations sub-committee) to fund the federal government and avoid a government shutdown. An omnibus spending bill combines two or more of those bills into a single bill.

Regular appropriations bills are typically written, debated, and passed by the House and the Senate during the summer. However, these versions can be different, especially if different parties control each chamber. The omnibus negotiating process takes place later in the year, and involves reconciling differences in the various bills so that an identical, combined appropriations bill can pass both chambers and avert a government shutdown.

==Appropriations process==
Every year, Congress must pass bills that appropriate money for all discretionary government spending. Generally, one bill is passed for each sub-committee of the twelve subcommittees in the U.S. House Committee on Appropriations and the matching 12 subcommittees in the United States Senate Committee on Appropriations.

When Congress does not or cannot produce separate bills in a timely fashion, it will roll many of the separate appropriations bills into one omnibus spending bill. The deadline could be the start of the next fiscal year, October 1, or it could be some other deadline when appropriations would otherwise run out (such as a deadline set by a continuing resolution). The fiscal year of the United States is the 12-month period beginning on October 1 and ending on September 30 of the next calendar year.

Some of the reasons that Congress might not complete all the separate bills include partisan disagreement, disagreement amongst members of the same political party, and too much work on other bills. According to Walter J. Oleszek, a political science professor and &quot;senior specialist in American national government at the Congressional Research Service&quot;, omnibus bills have become more popular since the 1980s because &quot;party and committee leaders can package or bury controversial provisions in one massive bill to be voted up or down.&quot;

Omnibus bills can also be used to &quot;veto-proof&quot; items, by including measures that the president is expected to veto if they were submitted for signature on their own, but who is willing or pressured into signing an omnibus bill that includes those measures.
=== Minibus ===
A &quot;minibus&quot; (short for &quot;mini-omnibus&quot;) is a spending bill which provides funding for multiple sectors of the federal government, but not for all of them.

=== Cromnibus ===
A &quot;cromnibus&quot; (portmanteau of &quot;CR&quot; and &quot;omnibus&quot;) is a bill setting new funding levels for certain sectors of the federal government, while renewing the previous fiscal year&#x27;s ones for others.

==Criticism==
In &quot;Congressional Procedures and the Policy Process,&quot; Walter Oleszek describes omnibus measures as follows:

Often, omnibus spending bills are criticized for being full of pork (unnecessary/wasteful spending that pleases constituents or special interest groups). The bills regularly stretch to more than 1,000 pages. Nevertheless, such bills have grown more common in recent years.

In December 2004, the 3,016-page $388 billion Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005 became known for its size, its earmarks inserted in the final stages that represented 4% of the $388 billion, its non-appropriations provisions, its controversial content, and for being rushed through at the last minute. It was drafted by the House in less than 24 hours and then pushed through the Senate. It contained &quot;complex and controversial matters&quot; which included nine bills, only two of which had been debated in the Senate, and a conference report (a bill reconciled between the two chambers in a conference committee) with 32 unrelated provisions that the Senate had never considered.

In 2009, a $410 billion omnibus bill, the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009 (), became a point of controversy due to its $8 billion in earmarks. On March 11, the bill was signed by U.S. President Barack Obama into law as .

<doc id="386536" wikidata="Q5538437" url="?curid=386536" title="George Dawson (preacher)">
<text>George Dawson (24 February 182130 November 1876) was an English nonconformist preacher, lecturer and activist. He was an influential voice in the calls for radical political and social reform in Birmingham, a philosophy that became known as the Civic Gospel.

==Ministry==

Dawson was born in Brunswick Square, London, in 1821. His father was headmaster of a Baptist school. He was educated at home, then at Marischal College, Aberdeen, and the University of Glasgow. Oxford and Cambridge seemed not an option as, owing to the Test Act, for centuries up to 1828 only Anglicans were allowed to matriculate (Oxford) or graduate (Cambridge).

In 1843 Dawson accepted a call to the pastorate of the Baptist church at Rickmansworth. He moved to the rapidly expanding industrial town of Birmingham in 1844 to become minister of the Mount Zion Baptist Chapel where the eloquence and beliefs that the young man expressed soon attracted a large following.
However, Dawson&#x27;s views did not fit the orthodoxy of the Baptist church, so in 1845 he left, followed by much of his congregation, to become minister of the theologically liberal Church of the Saviour, a Unitarian church erected for him by his supporters, where &quot;no pledge was required, of minister or congregation; no form of belief was implied by membership; no difference in creed was allowed to bar union in practical Christian work&quot;.

The key doctrine preached there was inscribed on a marble tablet above the entrance: &quot;There is but one law – thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and thy neighbour as thyself.&quot;

===Civic Gospel===
In the Church of the Saviour, Dawson developed the concept of the Civic Gospel. He called upon his congregation to join him in the struggle &quot;to improve conditions in the town and the quality of life enjoyed by its citizens&quot;. His sermons were unconventional for the time, it was said that Dawson &quot;preached not as a dying man to dying men – that was the old idea of preaching – but as a living man to living men who found life no simple or easy matter&quot;. His sermons electrified the Birmingham public and influential members of his Church included Joseph Chamberlain (who took Sunday School and oversaw the accounts), Jesse Collings, George Dixon, J. A. Langford, Robert Martineau, Samuel Timmins, William Harris, A. F. Osler, and the Kenrick family, all of whom played an important part in local affairs and took on his ideals. Between 1847 and 1867, 17 members of his congregation were elected to the Town Council, six of whom were elected mayor.

From his pulpit and in public lectures and articles, Dawson advised Christians (particularly people experienced in business) to become councillors and help transform the City, a call which Joseph Chamberlain answered in his work first as Councillor, then as a visionary social reforming Mayor. His idea of the civic gospel and his advocacy of free education was strongly supported by the Congregational spokesman Dr. R. W. Dale, and by J. T. Bunce, influential editor of the &quot;Birmingham Daily Post&quot;. Both Dawson and Dale were disqualified as ministers from seats on the town council, but both served on the Birmingham school board. Dawson strongly advocated to the worshippers in his Church and in Birmingham the idea of service in politics as a civic duty and as service to God.

Dawson&#x27;s radicalism did not meet with universal approval. A correspondent writing to &quot;Aris&#x27;s Birmingham Gazette&quot; in 1847 described him as a person &quot;whose views and proceedings are calculated to produce considerable mischief&quot;; and as &quot;a young man who ... has prided and plumed himself upon more than he possesses and has consequently fallen into great and grievous errors&quot;.

==Views==
Dawson did not consider himself to be a Unitarian, although modern Unitarians count him as one of their own (he is listed by the Midland Unitarian Union as a great nineteenth-century Unitarian). He left the Baptist Church to be free of any definite creed or doctrinal rigidity.

&quot;True Religion&quot;, Dawson believed, was &quot;social, unitive, and brotherly in its spirit: it produces the church as its social development&quot;. For him, Christianity was &quot;a set of fruitful principles&quot;, not a code of laws or a theological dogma.

==Other interests==

Dawson was famous during his lifetime for lecturing on a wide range of subjects from Shakespeare to German poetry, Italian history to good etiquette. He became a national figure, in demand as a lecturer throughout the country. Charles Kingsley described him as &quot;the greatest talker in England&quot;. Dawson was a friend of Carlyle and Emerson and did a great deal to popularize their teachings, especially in his demand for a high ethical standard in everyday life and his insistence that citizenship needed a specifically Christian approach.

Dawson also lectured on English literature at the Birmingham and Midland Institute and helped to found the Shakespeare Memorial Library in Birmingham. His address at the opening of the Birmingham Reference Library gives a flavour of what the civic gospel meant to the Victorian municipal activists:

Dawson died suddenly at Kings Norton on 30 November 1876 and was buried in Key Hill Cemetery.

Four volumes of Dawson&#x27;s &quot;Sermons&quot;, two of &quot;Prayers&quot; and two of &quot;Biographical Lectures&quot; were published after his death.

==Personal life==
Dawson married Susan Fanny Crompton (1820–1878) in 1846. They had two children, Rachel Annie (1846–1873) and Bernard (1851–1900). Rachel, &quot;from some inexplicable arrest in the bones of her skull at an early age ... was almost an imbecile&quot;. Her early death in May 1873 sent Dawson into a temporary fit of depression.

==Published biography==
Following Dawson&#x27;s death in 1876, his friend Sam Timmins was asked to write his biography, with additional contributions to be provided by G. J. Johnson, J. D. Morell (a contemporary of Dawson at the University of Glasgow) and J. H. Chamberlain. Timmins began to gather materials, but &quot;it was a long time before any part of his manuscript was sent to the printer&#x27;s&quot;; and, when it was, it was destroyed in a fire. Timmins lost enthusiasm – &quot;all the eagerness with which he undertook the task had oozed away&quot; – and the work remained unfinished at his death in 1902. The task and materials passed to Wright Wilson (son of Joseph Wilson, another of Dawson&#x27;s friends) and was eventually published in 1905, including the contributions from Johnson, Morell and Chamberlain, another from Sebastian Evans, and a reprinted newspaper article by David Christie Murray.

A statue of Dawson formerly stood in Victoria Square, Birmingham; and later in Edmund Street, nearby. It is currently in store at Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery&#x27;s Museum Collections Centre, awaiting restoration and repair.

A bust of Dawson is now on the ninth floor of the Library of Birmingham.

A room is named after him at The Birmingham &amp; Midland Institute.

<doc id="386537" wikidata="Q3487412" url="?curid=386537" title="Socialist Standard">
<text>Socialist Standard is a monthly socialist magazine published without interruption since September 1904 by the Socialist Party of Great Britain (SPGB). The magazine is written in a simple, direct style and focuses mainly on socialist advocacy and Marxian analysis of current events, particularly those affecting the United Kingdom. Some articles have been published in party pamphlets.

== History ==

The first editor was Robert Elrick. The &quot;Socialist Standard&quot; has also carried translations of continental writers. Under the Defence of the Realm Act 1914, it was placed on a secret list of papers and magazines banned for export during World War I for its call for workers to refuse to fight for their countries and instead join the class war. In 1915, it published an article written by a member of the Bolshevik party calling for a socialist solution to the war. In 1918, the paper voiced the first doubts of the SPGB regarding the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia.

Edgar Hardcastle began a long period of contributions in the 1920s leading eventually to an over thirty-year editorship of the &quot;Socialist Standard&quot;. In the 1930s, it drew on the reports from Spain to produce articles on the looming menace of aerial warfare. During World War II, the magazine evaded the censor largely by producing a series of articles on the Peloponnesian and similar ancient wars as a cover for the SPGB&#x27;s opposition to the current one.

== Centenary ==
To celebrate the party&#x27;s centenary in 2004, seventy articles were selected from over ten thousand from its history were compiled and published in May in a book called &quot;Socialism or Your Money Back&quot;. June 2004 issue of the &quot;Socialist Standard&quot; was a special issue to commemorate the party centenary and detail the party history. September 2004 issue of the &quot;Socialist Standard&quot; was a special issue to commemorate the publication centenary of the &quot;Socialist Standard&quot;.

== Present ==
The SPGB maintains that it is not a left-wing organisation nor the &quot;Socialist Standard&quot; a left-wing journal. &quot;Left-wing&quot;, it contends, has simply become an umbrella designation for protest groups and organisations demanding amendments and reforms to capitalism. The SPGB and the World Socialist Movement (with which the SPGB is associated), contrary to the views and aspirations of these myriad groups and organisations that would claim to be left-wing, affirms that capitalism is incapable of meaningful reform and that quintessentially the basis of the exploitation of the working class is the wages/money system.

According to Richard Montague:
:The SPGB holds that the limping democracy extant in most countries today, and certainly, in the developed countries, can be used as a weapon of social revolution; if the majority desired a socialist society, a wageless, classless, moneyless condition wherein goods and services were produced solely for need, there is no power capable of resisting its demand.

<doc id="386540" wikidata="Q1373549" url="?curid=386540" title="MIT Media Lab">
<text>The MIT Media Lab is a research laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, growing out of MIT&#x27;s Architecture Machine Group in the School of Architecture. Its research does not restrict to fixed academic disciplines, but draws from technology, media, science, art, and design. , Media lab&#x27;s research groups include neurobiology, biologically inspired fabrication, socially engaging robots, emotive computing, bionics, and hyperinstruments.

The media lab was founded in 1985 by Nicholas Negroponte and former MIT President Jerome Wiesner, and is housed in the Wiesner Building (designed by I. M. Pei), also known as Building E15. The lab has been written about in the popular press since 1988, when Stewart Brand published &quot;The Media Lab: Inventing the Future at M.I.T.&quot;, and its work was a regular feature of technology journals in the 1990s. In 2009, it expanded into a second building.

The media lab came under scrutiny in 2019 due to its acceptance of donations from convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. This led to the resignation of its director, Joi Ito, and the launch of an &quot;immediate, thorough and independent&quot; investigation into the &quot;extremely serious&quot; and &quot;deeply disturbing allegations about the engagement between individuals at the Media Lab and Jeffrey Epstein&quot; by L. Rafael Reif, the president of MIT.

In December 2020, Dava Newman, professor of aeronautics and astronautics and former deputy administrator of NASA under Obama, was named the new director of the MIT Media Lab.

==Administration==
The founding director of the lab was Nicholas Negroponte, who directed it until 2000. Later directors were Walter Bender (2000–2006), Frank Moss (2006–2011),&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT, 4/2011&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and Joi Ito (2011-2019) who resigned in connection with the Jeffrey Epstein scandal. Dava Newman took the position in July, 2021, the first woman to do so.

, the media lab had roughly 70 administrative and support staff members. Associate directors of the lab were Hiroshi Ishii and Andrew Lippman. Pattie Maes and Mitchel Resnick were co-heads of the program in media arts and sciences, and the lab&#x27;s chief knowledge officer was Henry Holtzman.

The media lab has at times had regional branches in other parts of the world, such as Media Lab Europe and Media Lab Asia, each with their own staff and governing bodies.

===Funding model===
The lab&#x27;s primary funding comes from corporate sponsorship. Rather than accepting funding on a per-project or per-group basis, the lab asks sponsors to fund general themes; sponsors can then connect with media lab research. Specific projects and researchers are also funded more traditionally through US government institutions including the NIH, NSF, and DARPA. Also, consortia with other schools or other departments at MIT are often able to have money that does not enter into the common pool.

MIT Media Lab has an approximately $75 million annual operating budget.

===Intellectual property===
Companies sponsoring the lab can share in the lab&#x27;s intellectual property without paying license fees or royalties. Non-sponsors cannot make use of media lab developments for two years after technical disclosure is made to MIT and media lab sponsors. The media lab generates approximately 20 new patents every year.

==Research at the lab==
Some recurring themes of work at the media lab include human adaptability, human computer interaction, education and communication, artistic creation and visualization, and designing technology for the developing world. Other research focus includes machines with common sense, sociable robots, prosthetics, sensor networks, musical devices, city design, and public health. Research programs all include iterative development of prototypes which are tested and displayed for visitors.

Each of these areas of research may incorporate others. Interaction design research includes designing intelligent objects and environments. Educational research has also included integrating more computation into learning activities – including software for learning, programmable toys, and artistic or musical instruments. Examples include Lego Mindstorms, the PicoCricket, and One Laptop per Child.

The lab has over twenty research groups.

==Academic program==
The media arts and sciences program is a part of MIT&#x27;s school of architecture and planning, and includes three levels of study: a doctoral program, a master&#x27;s of science program, and a program that offers an alternative to the standard MIT freshman year as well as a set of undergraduate subjects that may form the basis for a future joint major. All graduate students are fully supported (tuition plus a stipend) from the outset, normally by appointments as research assistants at the media laboratory, where they work on research programs and faculty projects, including assisting with courses. These research activities typically take up about half of a student&#x27;s time in the degree program.

The media arts and sciences academic program have a close relationship with the media lab. Most media lab faculty are professors of media arts and sciences. Students who earn a degree in media arts and sciences have been predominantly in residence at the media lab, taking classes and doing research. Some students from other programs at MIT, such as mechanical engineering, or electrical engineering and computer science, do their research at the media lab, working with a media lab/Media Arts and Sciences faculty advisor, but earn their degrees (such as MEng or an MS in EECS) from other departments. Over 1,000 students apply to the MAS program and the admission is less than 5% per year.

==Buildings==
In addition to the media lab, the combined original Wiesner building (E15) and new (E14) buildings also host the List Visual Arts Center, the School of Architecture and Planning&#x27;s Program in Art, Culture and Technology (ACT), and MIT&#x27;s Program in Comparative Media Studies.

In 2009, the media lab expanded into a new building designed by Pritzker Prize-winning Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki. The local architect of record was Leers Weinzapfel Associates, of Boston. The Maki building has predominantly glass walls, with long lines of sight through the building, making ongoing research visible and encouraging connections and collaboration.

==Faculty and academic research staff==
Media arts and sciences faculty and academic research staff are principal investigators/heads of the media lab&#x27;s various research groups. They also advise media arts and sciences graduate students and mentor MIT undergraduates. &quot;Most departments accept grad students based on their prospects for academic success; the media lab attempts to select ones that will best be able to help with some of the ongoing projects.&quot;

, there are more than 25 faculty and academic research staff members, including a dozen named professorships. A full list of media lab faculty and academic research staff, with bios and other information, is available via the media lab website.

, Alex Pentland is professor of media arts and sciences, Toshiba Professor and Media Lab Entrepreneurship Program Director.

== Controversies ==

=== Connections to Jeffrey Epstein ===
In August 2019, director Joi Ito said that the organization had received funding from multimillionaire convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein through foundations Epstein controlled; that Ito had visited several of Epstein&#x27;s residences; and that Epstein had invested &quot;in several of my funds which invest in tech startup companies outside of MIT&quot;. Ito later admitted to taking $525,000 in funding from Epstein for the lab. In 2019, media lab founder Nicholas Negroponte expressed support for Ito&#x27;s decision to accept the funding from Epstein. Also in 2019, a federal court deposition was unsealed in which Virginia Giuffre stated that Epstein&#x27;s associate directed her to have sex with former media lab professor Marvin Minsky.

In September 2019, it was revealed by emails leaked to Ronan Farrow of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; that Ito and Peter Cohen, the MIT Media Lab&#x27;s director of development and strategy at the time, have worked for years to solicit anonymous donations from Epstein despite Epstein being marked as Disqualified by the university as a donor. Ito has referred to Epstein as &quot;fascinating&quot;.

Ito resigned due to the scandal shortly after the New Yorker article. L. Rafael Reif, the president of MIT, announced an &quot;immediate, thorough and independent&quot; investigation to be led by an outside law firm into the &quot;extremely serious&quot; allegations.

On January 10, 2020, the executive committee of the MIT Corporation, the institute&#x27;s governing board, released the results of Goodwin Procter&#x27;s fact-finding regarding interactions between Jeffrey Epstein and the Institute. The report revealed that Epstein made 10 donations through various entities to MIT totaling $850,000, including nine donations, totaling $750,000, made after his 2008 conviction. In 2002, four years before Epstein&#x27;s first arrest for a sex offense, Epstein made a $100,000 donation to MIT through a charitable foundation to support the research of Professor Marvin Minsky (former Toshiba Professor of media arts and sciences, media lab). Epstein&#x27;s $100,000 donation in May 2013 was intended to be used at Joi Ito&#x27;s discretion. His donations in November 2013 and in July and September 2014, totaling $300,000, were made to support research by Joscha Bach, a media lab research fellow from Germany whom Epstein introduced to Ito in 2013. Bach declined to be interviewed for Goodwin Procter&#x27;s fact-finding. Epstein&#x27;s other donations to the media lab between 2015 and 2017, totaling $350,000, were made to support Professor Seth Lloyd (Professor of Mechanical Engineering, $225,000), and Professor Neri Oxman (associate professor of media arts and sciences, $125,000).

Shortly after signing a petition in support of Ito, attorney and political activist Lawrence Lessig argued that the undesirable nature of donations to academic institutions from criminals like Epstein, whose fortune does not derive from their crimes, is partially mitigated if the donations are anonymous. He argues that it was &quot;a mistake to take this money, even if anonymous,&quot; but that &quot;if you take them, at least don&#x27;t give the criminal a chance to publicly launder his reputation&quot;. &quot;Everyone seems to treat it as if the anonymity and secrecy around Epstein&#x27;s gift are a measure of some kind of moral failing,&quot; Lessig wrote. &quot;I see it as exactly the opposite.&quot;

&quot;The Boston Globe&quot; reported it had seen emails indicating Bill Gates had donated $2.2 million to the media lab through Epstein.

=== Other funding controversies ===
On March 24, 2018, Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman visited MIT and prompted protests. Salman&#x27;s non-profit foundation MiSK was a member company of the lab until 2018. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, a sizable part of the annual budget of the lab comes from corporate patrons, who pay at least $250,000 each year. Prince Mohammed&#x27;s personal foundation was among the roughly 90 members at their time of membership.

Some media lab-developed technologies made it into products or public software packages, such as the , the Benton hologram used in most credit cards, the Fisher-Price&#x27;s Symphony Painter, the Nortel Wireless Mesh Network, the NTT Comware Sensetable, the Taito&#x27;s Karaoke-on-Demand Machine. A 1994 device called the Sensor Chair used to control a musical orchestra was adapted by several car manufacturers into capacitive sensors to prevent dangerous airbag deployments.

The MPEG-4 SA project developed at the Media Lab made structured audio a practical reality and the Aspen Movie Map was the precursor to the ideas in Google Street View.

In 2001, two research centers were spun off: Media Lab Asia and Media Lab Europe. Media Lab Asia, based in India, was a result of cooperation with the Government of India but eventually broke off in 2003 after a disagreement. Media Lab Europe, based in Dublin, Ireland, was founded with a similar concept in association with Irish universities and government, and closed in January 2005.

Created collaboratively by the Computer Museum and the media lab, the Computer Clubhouse, a worldwide network of after-school learning centers, focuses on youth from underserved communities who would not otherwise have access to technological tools and activities.

Launched in 2003, Scratch is a block-based programming language and community developed for children 8–16, and used by people of all ages to learn programming. Millions of people have created Scratch projects in a wide variety of settings, including homes, schools, museums, libraries, and community centers.

In January 2005, the lab&#x27;s chairman emeritus Nicholas Negroponte announced at the World Economic Forum a new research initiative to develop a $100 laptop computer. A non-profit organization, One Laptop per Child, was created to oversee the actual deployment, MIT did not manufacture or distribute the device.

The Synthetic Neurobiology group created reagents and devices for the analysis of brain circuits are in use by hundreds of biology labs around the world.

In 2011, Ramesh Raskar&#x27;s group published their femto-photography technique, that is able to image the movement of individual light pulses.

In 2013, the Media Lab launched E14 Fund as a program to support and invest in MIT Media Lab startups. In 2017, E14 Fund launched its first seed stage venture fund to invest in the MIT Media Lab startup community. It invested in companies like Formlabs, Affectiva, Tulip, Wise Systems, Figur8 and more.

<text>Henry William Crosskey (7 December 1826 – 1 October 1893) was an English Unitarian minister and geologist.

Crosskey was born at Lewes, Sussex. After being trained for the ministry at Manchester New College (1843–1848), he became pastor of Friargate chapel, Derby, until 1852, when he accepted charge of a Unitarian congregation in Glasgow. In 1869 he moved to Birmingham, where he remained as pastor of the Church of the Messiah until his death.

While in Glasgow his interest was awakened in geology by the perusal of A. C. Ramsay&#x27;s &quot;Geology of the Isle of Arran&quot;, and from 1855 onwards he devoted his leisure to the pursuit of this science. He became an authority on glacial geology, and wrote much, especially in conjunction with David Robertson, on the Quaternary fossiliferous beds of Scotland (&quot;Trans. Geol. Soc. Glasgow&quot;).

He also prepared for the British Association a valuable series of &quot;Reports&quot; (1873–1892) on the erratic &quot;Blocks of England, Wales and Ireland&quot;. In conjunction with David Robertson and George Stewardson Brady (1832–1921) he wrote the &quot;Monograph of the Post Tertiary Entomostraca of Scotland&quot;, etc. for the Palaeontographical Society (1874); and he edited Henry Carvill Lewis&#x27;s &quot;Papers and Notes on the Glacial Geology of Great Britain and Ireland&quot;, issued posthumously (1894). He died at Edgbaston, Birmingham, on 1 October 1893.

<doc id="386542" wikidata="Q2029483" url="?curid=386542" title="USS Monaghan (DD-354)">
<text>USS &quot;Monaghan&quot; (DD-354) was the last ship built of the &quot;Farragut&quot;-class destroyer design. She was named for Ensign John R. Monaghan. &quot;Monaghan&quot; was laid down on 21 November 1933 at the Boston Navy Yard, and launched on 9 January 1935. She was sponsored by Miss Mary F. Monaghan, niece of Ensign Monaghan, and commissioned on 19 April 1935. During the next few years &quot;Monaghan&quot; operated primarily in the North Atlantic, training US Navy personnel who served in World War II. &quot;Monaghan&quot; was present during the Pearl Harbor raid on 7 December 1941. She participated in the Battle of the Coral Sea and the Battle of Midway in 1942. Monaghan was sunk in Typhoon Cobra east of the Philippines in 1944.

==Pearl Harbor==

On 7 December 1941, &quot;Monaghan&quot; was a ready duty destroyer in Pearl Harbor, and at 07:51 was ordered to join , who had just sunk an unidentified submarine off the entrance to Pearl Harbor an hour earlier. Four minutes later, before &quot;Monaghan&quot; could get underway, the Japanese air attack began. &quot;Monaghan&quot; opened fire, and at 08:27 was underway to join &quot;Ward&quot; when notified of the presence of a Ko-hyoteki class midget submarine in the harbor. &quot;Monaghan&quot; headed for the trespasser and the captain, LCdr. Burford, giving the order to ram. The submarine turned and fired its torpedo at the &quot;Monaghan&quot;. It missed, passing within 50 yards of the destroyer&#x27;s starboard side. The &quot;Monaghan&quot; rammed the submarine glancingly, then sank it with two depth charges. Because of the shallowness of the harbor, when the depth charges detonated, the explosions lifted the &quot;Monaghan&quot;&#x27;s stern out of the water. The destroyer then went out of control and smashed into a barge.

She headed on out of the harbor to patrol offshore for the next week, then joined in the attempt to relieve Wake Island, but Wake was captured by the Japanese before &quot;Lexington&#x27;s&quot; force could bring aid. Homeward bound, &quot;Monaghan,&quot; with and , made repeated attacks on an enemy submarine, causing it to broach and give off a large oil slick.

Patrol and scouting operations out of Pearl Harbor with the &quot;Lexington&quot; group were followed by convoy duty to the west coast and back before Task Force 11 (TF 11), with &quot;Monaghan&quot; screening &quot;Lexington,&quot; sortied from Pearl Harbor on 15 April 1942, bound for the South Pacific. With the Japanese threatening Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, sea lines of communication to Australia and New Zealand were in peril, and the Navy moved quickly and decisively to block so critical a threat. First action came 4 May when planes from hit Japanese invasion shipping at Tulagi and Gavutu. The two carrier forces now combined upon word that an enemy carrier group had entered the Coral Sea. The opening action of the victory there came 7 May, when American search planes spotted the Japanese occupation force, several transports guarded by the light carrier . &quot;Lexington&quot; and &quot;Yorktown&quot; planes sank &quot;Shōhō&quot;. Next day, before the major engagement by aircraft from both American and Japanese fleet carriers, &quot;Monaghan&quot; was ordered away from formation to transmit important messages, thus preserving radio silence in the main body. She was then ordered on to search for survivors of and , sunk on the 7th by the Japanese. Since the position of the sinking had been erroneously reported, &quot;Monaghan&quot; was unable to carry out a rescue, and sailed on with messages for Nouméa before rejoining TF 16 in time to return to Pearl Harbor 26 May.

==Battle of Midway==

Two days later, &quot;Monaghan&quot; was underway for the decisive battle of the war, the Battle of Midway. The Japanese sailed for the capture of the Midway Atoll with a complex battle plan, but U.S. naval intelligence revealed the plan to American commanders, who thus knew when and where to find the Carrier Striking Task Force of the Japanese attackers. Although outnumbered, the Americans sank four enemy carriers in air actions beginning on the night of 3 June, along with a heavy cruiser. Through the first two days, &quot;Monaghan&quot; screened , then late on the morning of 5 June was ordered out to rescue men of a downed seaplane. At 1830 she reached the side of badly damaged &quot;Yorktown,&quot; joining the group of destroyers struggling to save the carrier and guard her from further damage. The penetrated the destroyer screen the next day and sank both &quot;Yorktown&quot; and , the carrier remaining afloat another 16 hours before she succumbed. &quot;Monaghan,&quot; , and attacked and badly damaged the submarine.

==Other Pacific operations==

After the victory, the force returned to Pearl Harbor on 13 June. &quot;Monaghan&quot; was sent north to aid in countering the Japanese threat in the Aleutians. Damaged by collision in the heavy northern fog, &quot;Monaghan&quot; repaired at Dutch Harbor and Pearl Harbor, then escorted a convoy to the west coast en route to the Mare Island Naval Shipyard at Vallejo, CA for a repair period. &quot;Monaghan&quot; returned to the South Pacific at Nandi, Fiji, 17 November. In the harbor of Nouméa she bent her propellers on an underwater obstruction, and had to return to Pearl Harbor on her hastily replaced port screw for permanent repairs, completed 21 February 1943.

Once more in the Aleutians, &quot;Monaghan&quot; joined TG 16.69 a scouting force built around cruisers and . On 26 March this group engaged the Japanese in the Battle of the Komandorski Islands. Although outnumbered, the Americans fired guns and torpedoes so effectively that the Japanese were driven away. Patrol and occasional shore bombardment missions throughout the Aleutians, along with escort missions, continued through the summer. Highlights were a radar-directed surface engagement with an unidentified target 20 June, and a chase of a Japanese submarine two days later that resulted with the submarine being driven up on rocks and abandoned. She was later identified as , engaged in evacuating troops from Kiska.

After escort duty to Pearl Harbor and San Francisco, &quot;Monaghan&quot; sailed to San Pedro, California, to escort three new escort carriers to the Gilbert Islands operation, for which they sailed from Espiritu Santo 13 November. The escort carriers launched their planes against shore targets and protected convoys offshore through the invasion of Tarawa.

Returning to the west coast on escort duty, &quot;Monaghan&quot; rejoined the escort carriers after extensive exercises out of San Diego, California, and prepared for the invasion of the Marshalls, during which she guarded the carriers northwest of Roi as they flew air support and strikes for the landings there. On 7 February 1944 she entered Majuro, then escorted to Kwajalein, where she joined the transport screen for the capture of Eniwetok. On the night of 21/22 February, she joined in an all-night bombardment on Parry Island, then spent a month on patrol and escort duty in the Marshalls.

On 22 March &quot;Monaghan&quot; put to sea in the antisubmarine screen for the fast carriers, bound for strikes on Palau, Woleai, and Yap, returning to Majuro 6 April. The next sortie, 13 April to 4 May, was to cover the Hollandia landings, and strike at Satawan, Truk, and Ponape. After preparing at Majuro, the force now sailed for the invasion of Saipan, against which the first strikes were flown 11 June. While the fliers of TF 58 soundly defeated the Japanese in the Battle of the Philippine Sea, &quot;Monaghan&quot;&#x27;s group patrolled off Saipan guarding against a possible breakthrough by the enemy. They next steamed to Eniwetok to prepare for the assault on Guam, for which they sailed 14 July, &quot;Monaghan&quot; again in the antisubmarine screen protecting the carriers. Assigned to cover the work of underwater demolition teams off Agat on the night of 17/18 July, &quot;Monaghan&quot; furnished harassing fire until daylight, firing again on the island during the early morning of 19 June. She continued bombardment and screening missions until 25 July when she sailed for Pearl Harbor, and an overhaul at Puget Sound.

== Loss in a typhoon ==
After training off California and Hawaii, &quot;Monaghan&quot; sailed for Ulithi 11 November. There she joined the escort for three fleet oilers bound for a rendezvous 17 December with TF 38, whose planes had been striking central Luzon in support of the Mindoro invasion. The ship was expecting to refuel and probably had reduced its ballast in order to take on fuel. Typhoon &quot;Cobra&quot; hit before the &quot;Monaghan&quot; was ready to ride it out. Typhoon Cobra claimed 790 lives in the 3rd Fleet, and sank , , and &quot;Monaghan&quot;. Six men survived the &quot;Monaghan&quot; sinking, reportedly rescued by and/or . After drifting on a raft for three days, the men reported that &quot;Monaghan&quot; took roll after roll to starboard, finally going over. The Typhoon Cobra tragedy, Admiral Chester Nimitz said, &quot;represented a more crippling blow to the Third Fleet than it might be expected to suffer in anything less than a major action&quot;.

&quot;Monaghan&quot; received 12 battle stars for World War II service.

<text>Henry Carvill Lewis (November 16, 1853 – July 21, 1888) was an American geologist and mineralogist.

==Career==

Lewis was born in Philadelphia on November 16, 1853, and was educated at the University of Pennsylvania. He received his Masters of Arts Degree in 1876 and became attached to the Geological Survey of Pennsylvania in 1879. He served for three years as a volunteer member, and during this term he became greatly interested in the study of glacial phenomena. In 1880 he was chosen professor of mineralogy in the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences, and in 1883 he was appointed to the chair of geology in Haverford College, Pennsylvania. He was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1881.

During the winters of 1885 to 1887 he studied petrology under HF Rosenbusch at Heidelberg, and during the summers he investigated the glacial geology of northern Europe and the British Isles. His observations in North America, where he had studied under Professor G.F. Wright, Professor T.C. Chamberlin and Warren Upham, had demonstrated the former extension of land-ice, and the existence of great terminal moraines.

In 1884 his &quot;Report on the Terminal Moraine in Pennsylvania and Western New York&quot; was published: a work containing much information on the limits of the North American ice-sheet. In Britain he sought to trace in like manner the southern extent of the terminal moraines formed by British ice-sheets, but before his conclusions were matured, he died from typhoid fever at Manchester, England on July 21, 1888. He was buried at the churchyard of Christ Church, Walmsley.

The results of his observations were published in 1894, entitled &quot;Papers and Notes on the Glacial Geology of Great Britain and Ireland&quot;, edited by Dr HW Crosskey.

==Psychical research==

Lewis took interest in investigating paranormal claims. In 1886, he attended séances of the medium William Eglinton and detected him in fraud. The exposure was published in the Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research in 1887.

==Publications==

<text>Watermead is a village situated to the north of Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire, England. It is a civil parish and forms part of the Aylesbury Urban Area.

==Housing development==
Plans for the village of Watermead were first drawn up in the 1980s. The idea was to create a self-contained executive area that would bring new sports facilities and a better quality of housing to the town.

The village is built on green belt land. At the planning stage the designers were required to pay heed to the ecology of the local area to help protect the environment. Central to the plans therefore was an extensive lake that would become a haven for wildlife and many wild birds.

The water table in the Vale of Aylesbury is higher than the average in England, on account of extensive water reserves that are stored below the clay bed of the whole vale. The designers of the village took this into account by creating a lake in the centre to allow for rise in water levels. Construction went underway and the first houses were ready for sale in 1986

On the opposite side of the lake from the village was an artificial ski slope. Control over the local water table with flood defences installed and diversions for the River Thame to flood planes on specially dug lakes. The village has grown extensively and has a very active parish council. The ski slope site has been developed and is now Aylesbury Vale Crematorium.

Watermead was voted one of the top villages of its type in the country in the early 1990s and won awards for its design and original ideas.

The original Royco theme was designed by architects John Evennett Associates. Blocks of individual homes were built that made walking through each road (each named after a breed of bird) interesting, although this is something that has been lost since newer building designs were erected around Watermead, but predominantly the existing original Royco village are visible from the approach road, and from over the bridge and across the lake.

==Transport==
Watermead&#x27;s closest station is Aylesbury with services to London Marylebone and High Wycombe. Several buses routes connect Watermead to Aylesbury town centre operated by Rainbow Routes, Redline Buses and Arriva.

== Parish Council ==
Watermead parish was established in 2001 and had its first meeting on 18 June of that year.

<doc id="386554" wikidata="Q602689" url="?curid=386554" title="Eriskay">
<text>Eriskay (), from the Old Norse for &quot;Eric&#x27;s Isle&quot;, is an island and community council area of the Outer Hebrides in northern Scotland with a population of 143, as of the 2011 census. It lies between South Uist and Barra and is connected to South Uist by a causeway which was opened in 2001. In the same year Ceann a&#x27; Ghàraidh in Eriskay became the ferry terminal for travelling between South Uist and Barra. The Caledonian MacBrayne vehicular ferry travels between Eriskay and Ardmore in Barra. The crossing takes around 40 minutes.

==Geography==

Although only a small island (about ) Eriskay has many claims to fame that have made the island well-known far beyond the Hebrides. It is associated with a popular song still sung by Scottish traditional musicians, the art song &quot;Eriskay Love Lilt&quot;, which was collected on the island as the lament for unrequited love &quot;Gràdh Geal Mo Chridhe&quot; by Marjory Kennedy-Fraser with the assistance of the Gaelic Bard Fr. Allan MacDonald. The island is also associated with the Eriskay Pony and the Eriskay jersey (made without any seams). 

There is a shop in Eriskay, a community centre and 
a local history museum.

==History==
===The Jacobite rising of 1745===
Eriskay is very important to the history of the Jacobite rising of 1745. On 2 August 1745 the privateer &quot;Du Teillay&quot; arrived there and temporarily put Prince Charles Edward Stuart and the Seven Men of Moidart ashore upon the island. The sandy beach where the Prince first set foot upon Scottish soil is still called in his honour &quot;Coilleag a&#x27; Phrionnsa&quot; (&quot;The Cockel Strand of the Prince&quot;).

In 1995, a memorial cairn was erected at the site with an inscription that includes the first stanza of Scottish Gaelic national poet Alasdair Mac Mhaighstir Alasdair&#x27;s iconic song-poem &quot;Òran Eile don Phrionnsa&quot;:

:&quot;Moch sa mhadainn &#x27;s mi dùsgadh
:&#x27;S mòr mo shunnd &#x27;s mo cheòl-gàire
:On a chuala mi &#x27;m Prionnsa
:Thighinn do dhùthaich Chlann Raghnaill.&quot;

An English translation by Hamish Henderson reads, 
:&quot;Early in the morning as I wakened, 
:great [is] my joy, 
:for I hear that [the Prince] comes 
:to the land of Clanranald.&quot;

===The Highland Clearances and their legacy===
According to the Napier Commission testimony of local resident John McCaskill, the islanders of Eriskay had consisted as recently as the 1830s and &#x27;40s of only three families and less than 30 people. They had been radically multiplied, though, during the subsequent phases of the Highland Clearances. The estate Factors, who considered Eriskay &quot;agriculturally worthless&quot;, accordingly used the island as a dumping ground for evicted tenants from the many other islands owned by Colonel John Gordon throughout the Sound of Barra and the southern Outer Hebrides. For the most part, however, the newly arrived islanders of Eriskay belonged overwhelmingly to the once strictly illegal Catholic Church in Scotland and had their family roots in South Uist.

Even so, for decades after Catholic Emancipation in 1829, there was still no resident Roman Catholic priest in Eriskay, and the island&#x27;s population was largely served by visiting priests from St Peter&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church at Daliburgh, South Uist. Such priests had walk down to &quot;The Priests&#x27; Point&quot; along the south coast and kindle a bonfire as a signal for Eriskay fishermen to sail over and ferry them across the Sound of Barra.

According to Roger Hutchinson, the first St. Michael&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church was built in 1852, &quot;shortly after the arrival of hundreds of evictees from South Uist and elsewhere. It was no more than a big stone crofthouse, a single-storey rectangle, at first with a thatch and later with a corrugated iron roof.&quot;

The current St Michael&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church stands atop &quot;Cnoc nan Sgrath&quot;, a hill overlooking the main village on Eriskay. It was famously built with stones and homemade mortar by the local population under the leadership of the Bard Fr. Allan MacDonald (). Since the current church was consecrated by Bishop George Smith in 7 May 1903, the site of the 1852 stone chapel has been marked by a Marian shrine with a statue of Our Lady of Fatima, overlooking the Sound of Barra.

Due to the long residence, death, and burial there of Fr. Allan MacDonald, Eriskay is also important to both Christian poetry and Scottish Gaelic literature. In his iconic song poem &quot;Eilein na h-Òige&quot; (&quot;Island of the Young&quot;), Fr. MacDonald praises the beauty of Eriskay, its wildlife, and the fondness of its people for telling tales from the Fenian Cycle of Celtic mythology inside the ceilidh house. He also commented upon the visits to Eriskay by Saint Columba, Iain Mùideartach (Chief of Clanranald), and Prince Charles Edward Stuart. Fr. MacDonald also denounced the Highland Clearances, but expressed joy that the crofters had been granted greater rights against the Anglo-Scottish landlords.

===20th century===
&quot;Eriskay: A Poem of Remote Lives&quot;, made in 1934 by important early German documentary filmmaker Werner Kissling, was filmed on the island and is comprised 15m 40s of silent, black-and-white footage. An introduction was added and a sound track featuring narration, Scottish traditional music, waulking songs, and recorded conversations in Scottish Gaelic.

Kissling&#x27;s film formed the centre-piece of a &quot;Hebridean Evening&quot;, hosted at the Marquess of Londonderry’s London residence, on Tuesday, 30 April 1935, in the presence of the Prince of Wales, Queen Mary of Teck, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Ramsay MacDonald, Macleod of Macleod and Cameron of Lochiel. The funds raised were used to build Eriskay’s first major road, running from the old pier at &quot;Na Hann&quot; in the north to the harbour at &quot;Acairseid&quot; in the south. While the roads have long since been upgraded, part of the old road, which is named &quot;Rathad Kissling&quot; (&quot;Kissling Street&quot;) in the filmmaker&#x27;s honour, still survives near Acairseid.

The Politician Lounge Bar in &quot;Na Hann&quot; is named after the &quot;SS Politician&quot; which ran aground off the island&#x27;s coast in 1941. The accident provided the whole island with a generous supply of free whisky in defiance of both customs duties and wartime rationing and subsequently inspired Compton Mackenzie&#x27;s 1947 comic novel &quot;Whisky Galore!&quot; and it&#x27;s 1949 film adaptation.

During the 1930s, &#x27;40s, and &#x27;50s, an audio archive of Hebridean mythology and folklore and stories about local history were recorded from the Eriskay oral tradition by island schoolmaster Donald MacDonald and by Calum Maclean, both of whom were in the employ of Prof. Séamus Ó Duilearga and the Irish Folklore Commission. The recordings have since been digitized and made available online through the &quot;Tobar an Dualchais – Kist o Riches&quot; website.

Prince Charles and Princess Diana visited Eriskay during their tour of the Western Isles in July 1985.

===21st century===
After a protracted campaign local residents took control of the island on 30 November 2006 in a community buy-out. The previous landowners, a sporting syndicate, sold the assets of the estate including Benbecula, South Uist and Eriskay for £4.5 million to a community-owned organisation known as Stòras Uibhist, which was set up to purchase the land and to manage it in perpetuity.

&quot;Comann Eachdraidh Eirisgeidh&quot; (&quot;The Eriskay Historical Society&quot;) was established in 2010 and, as of 2021, had recently purchased the island&#x27;s schoolhouse, which had been closed down since 2013, to turn it into a local history and heritage museum. In honour of Fr. Allan MacDonald, the Society has also established &quot;Maighstir Ailein&#x27;s Poetry Trail&quot;, a hiking trail where particularly scenic locations are accompanied by bilingual and laminated verses in boxes of the priest-poet&#x27;s famous poem, &quot;Eilein na h-Òige&quot; (&quot;Isle of Youth&quot;).

==Transport==

Eriskay is traversed by a number of mountain paths and tracks, and has just a single motor road. The first stretch of that road was built in 1935, funded through proceeds from the first showing in London of the Werner Kissling film.

There is a regular bus service on the island which forms part of the &quot;Spine Route&quot; between Eriskay Slipway and Berneray via South Uist, Benbecula and North Uist. Services are provided by DA Travel with funding from Comhairle nan Eilean Siar.

In 2009 the previous primitive quay facilities at the excellent natural harbour of Acarsaid Mhòr were extended and modernised, with improved vehicular access. Some smaller fishing boats continue—at least when the tides and weather are favourable—to use the shelving bay at Haun (from the Viking for &#x27;harbour&#x27;—but scarcely with sufficient shelter to constitute a harbour in practice). Acarsaid Mhòr is also used by visiting yachts.

==Crofting==

Following the establishment of the first Crofting Commission in the 1880s, the whole of the island, together with the small adjoining Stack Island, was incorporated into the crofting townships:

The souming (a word originating in the Viking era) for each full share gives the right to put, on the common grazings (the high ground of Beinn Sgrithean and Beinn Stac), ten sheep, two cows and one Eriskay Pony (all plus their &#x27;followers&#x27;—young up to one year old). Most crofts have one full share, but many have a half share, and a few have two shares, and one croft has as many as 3 shares.

The crofts are small (typically five hectares or less) and the land is rocky and exposed to harsh weather. These days, very few crofts are actively worked: there is little economic return in relation to the effort, and although there is a strong cultural attachment to the land, the demands and distractions of modern life leave little time for tending livestock and manual work. Much of the best grazing land, the machair of the north west of the island, has been compromised by house-building and the increasing opposition to the free-range grazing of cattle and sheep during the winter. Now, the most actively worked crofts are in the township of Bun a&#x27; Mhuillinn.

The island&#x27;s common grazings, and the grazing of croft inbye land during the winter months, are regulated by the Eriskay Grazings Committee, the members of which serve a three-year term, supported by a Grazings Clerk, and according to the Grazings Regulations as provided for in the Crofting Acts.

==Emigration==

Many Eriskay families have had to leave the island in recent years in search of work and some historic island families have few or no descendants left on the island. An example of these families is the MacInnes who were a prominent island family at the time of the Kissling film but now number just four members of the extended family dwelling on the island, and active in crofting, shell-fishing, building work, as well contributing to the community.

Many of those who leave for the mainland are young as—in common with remoter rural areas generally—there are few work opportunities and limited access to further or higher education.

The island&#x27;s population was 143, as recorded by the 2011 census—an increase of 7.5% since 2001, when there were 133 usual residents. During the same period Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4% to 103,702.

==Tourism==
 there were no hotels, two or three bed-and-breakfast establishments, and until recently few self-catering cottages or houses. Since the completion in 2001 of the causeway to South Uist and the inauguration of the vehicle ferry to Barra, a number of properties have been professionally renovated or purpose-built as holiday accommodation. The machair and beaches from Coilleag a&#x27; Phrionnsa to Rudha Bàn are increasingly popular with visitors travelling with their motor-homes.

The island is home to a herd of Eriskay Ponies owned and maintained by members of &quot;Comann Each nan Eilean – The Eriskay Pony Society&quot;, founded in 1972. The ponies are bound by crofting regulations and are brought to the hill grazings in spring, and back down into the township for the winter. They graze and roam around the island to whichever part is most comfortable depending on the climate. Although the ponies have a laid-back temperament and are accustomed to humans, they should be approached with care and visitors should refrain from feeding them, as this can be harmful to the animals.

==Wildlife==
Sea bindweed, which is not native to the Hebrides, grows on the island. Its presence there is said to stem from the arrival of the &quot;Bonnie Prince&quot;, who accidentally dropped the seeds when he pulled a handkerchief from his pocket.

==In popular culture==
*Allan MacDonald (1859–1905), a Roman Catholic priest, important figure in Scottish Gaelic literature, and activist for crofters&#x27; rights, died and was buried on Eriskay.
*Father Calum (Malcolm Joseph) MacLellan (1926–2012) priest, appearing in series 5 and 6 of &quot;An Island Parish&quot;, first vice-convener of Comhairle nan Eilean Siar.

<doc id="386555" wikidata="Q849680" url="?curid=386555" title="American Indian Wars">
<text>The American Indian Wars, also known as the American Frontier Wars, and the Indian Wars, was a conflict initially fought by European colonial empires, the United States, and briefly the Confederate States of America and Republic of Texas against various American Indian tribes in North America. These conflicts occurred from the time of the earliest colonial settlements in the 17th century until the end of the 19th century. The various wars resulted from a wide variety of factors, the most common being the desire of settlers and governments for Indian tribes&#x27; lands. The European powers and their colonies enlisted allied Indian tribes to help them conduct warfare against each other&#x27;s colonial settlements. After the American Revolution, many conflicts were local to specific states or regions and frequently involved disputes over land use; some entailed cycles of violent reprisal. 

As American settlers spread and expanded westward across the United States after 1780, armed conflicts increased in size, duration, and intensity between settlers and various Indian tribes. The climax came in the War of 1812, when major Indian coalitions in the Midwestern United States and the Southern United States fought against the United States and lost. Conflict with settlers became less common and was usually resolved by treaties between the federal government and specific tribes, which often required the tribes to sell or surrender land to the United States. These treaties were frequently broken by the U.S. federal government.

The Indian Removal Act of 1830 that was passed by the United States Congress neither authorized the unilateral abrogation of treaties guaranteeing Native American land rights within the states, nor the forced relocation of the eastern Indians. Yet both occurred and on a massive scale, it forced Indian tribes to move from east of the Mississippi River to the west on the American frontier, especially to Indian Territory which became Oklahoma. As settlers expanded onto the Great Plains and the Western United States, the nomadic and semi-nomadic Indian tribes of those regions were forced to relocate to Indian reservations.

Indian tribes and coalitions often won battles with the encroaching settlers and soldiers, but their numbers were too few and their resources too limited to win more than temporary victories and concessions from the U.S. and other countries that colonized areas that had composed the modern-day borders of the United States of America.

==Colonial periods (1609–1774)==


The colonization of North America by English, Spanish, French, Russian and Dutch was resisted by some Indian tribes and assisted by other tribes. Wars and other armed conflicts in the 17th and 18th centuries included:
* Beaver Wars (1609–1701) between the Iroquois and the French, who allied with the Algonquians
* Anglo-Powhatan Wars (1610–14, 1622–32, 1644–46), including the 1622 Jamestown Massacre, between English colonists and the Powhatan Confederacy in the Colony of Virginia
* Pequot War of 1636–38 between the Pequot tribe and colonists from the Massachusetts Bay Colony and Connecticut Colony and allied tribes
* Kieft&#x27;s War (1643–45) in the Dutch territory of New Netherland (New Jersey and New York) between colonists and the Lenape people
* Peach War (1655), the large-scale attack by the Munsee on several New Netherland settlements
* Esopus Wars (1659–63), conflicts between the Esopus tribe of Lenape Indians and colonial New Netherlanders in Ulster County, New York
* King Philip&#x27;s War (Metacom&#x27;s Rebellion) (1675–78) in New England between colonists and the local tribes including, but not limited to, the Nipmuc, Wampanoag, and Narragansett
* Chowanoc War (1675–77) in the Province of Carolina
* King William&#x27;s War (1688–1697) between England and France, and their Indian allies, in New France, New England, and the Province of New York
* Tuscarora War (1711–15) in the Province of North Carolina
* Yamasee War (1715–17) in the Province of South Carolina
* Dummer&#x27;s War (1722–25) in northern New England and French Acadia (New Brunswick and Nova Scotia)
* Pontiac&#x27;s War (1763–66) in the Great Lakes region
* Lord Dunmore&#x27;s War (1774) in western Virginia (Kentucky and West Virginia)

In several instances, the conflicts were a reflection of European rivalries, with Indian tribes splitting their alliances among the powers, generally siding with their trading partners. Various tribes fought on each side in King William&#x27;s War, Queen Anne&#x27;s War, Dummer&#x27;s War, King George&#x27;s War, and the French and Indian War, allying with British or French colonists according to their own self interests. On 14 August 1784, Russian colonists had massacred 200–3,000 Koniag Alutiiq tribesmen in Sitkalidak Island, Alaska. This massacre is known as Awa&#x27;uq Massacre. Despite the incidents that occurred between European colonists and the Native population, most Indian tribes were friendly towards the Swedes in New Sweden as result of Swedish authorities respecting tribal land.

==East of the Mississippi (1775–1842)==
British merchants and government agents began supplying weapons to Indians living in the United States following the Revolution (1783–1812) in the hope that, if a war broke out, they would fight on the British side. The British further planned to set up an Indian nation in the Ohio-Wisconsin area to block further American expansion. The US protested and declared war in 1812. Most Indian tribes supported the British, especially those allied with Tecumseh, but they were ultimately defeated by General William Henry Harrison. The War of 1812 spread to Indian rivalries, as well.

Many refugees from defeated tribes went over the border to Canada; those in the South went to Florida while it was under Spanish control as they would be considered free, and not slaves, under the Viceroyalty of New Spain. During the early 19th century, the federal government was under pressure by settlers in many regions to expel Indians from their areas. The Indian Removal Act of 1830 stated the &quot;authorizing of the President to grant lands west of the Mississippi in exchange for Indian lands within existing state borders.&quot; Some tribes resisted relocation fiercely, most notably the Seminoles in a series of wars in Florida. They were never defeated, although some Seminoles migrated to Indian Territory. Other tribes were forced to move to reservations west of the Mississippi River, most famously the Cherokee whose relocation was called the &quot;Trail of Tears&quot;.

===American Revolutionary War (1775–1783)===
The American Revolutionary War was essentially two parallel wars for the American Patriots. The war in the east was a struggle against British rule, while the war in the west was an &quot;Indian War&quot;. The newly proclaimed United States competed with the British for control of the territory east of the Mississippi River. Some Indians sided with the British, as they hoped to reduce American settlement and expansion. In one writer&#x27;s opinion, the Revolutionary War was &quot;the most extensive and destructive&quot; Indian war in United States history.
Some Indian tribes were divided over which side to support in the war, such as the Iroquois Confederacy based in New York and Pennsylvania who split: the Oneida and Tuscarora sided with the American Patriots, and the Mohawk, Seneca, Cayuga, and Onondaga sided with the British. The Iroquois tried to avoid fighting directly against one another, but the Revolution eventually forced intra-Iroquois combat, and both sides lost territory following the war. The Crown aided the landless Iroquois by rewarding them with a reservation at Grand River in Ontario and some other lands. In the Southeast, the Cherokee split into a pro-patriot faction versus a pro-British faction that the Americans referred to as the Chickamauga Cherokee; they were led by Dragging Canoe. Many other tribes were similarly divided.

When the British made peace with the Americans in the 1783 Treaty of Paris, they ceded a vast amount of Indian territory to the United States. Indian tribes who had sided with the British and had fought against the Americans were enemy combatants, as far as the United States was concerned; they were a conquered people who had lost their land.

===Cherokee–American wars===

The frontier conflicts were almost non-stop, beginning with Cherokee involvement in the American Revolutionary War and continuing through late 1794. The so-called &quot;Chickamauga Cherokee&quot;, later called &quot;Lower Cherokee&quot;, were from the Overhill Towns and later from the Lower Towns, Valley Towns, and Middle Towns. They followed war leader Dragging Canoe southwest, first to the Chickamauga Creek area near Chattanooga, Tennessee, then to the Five Lower Towns where they were joined by groups of Muskogee, white Tories, runaway slaves, and renegade Chickasaw, as well as by more than a hundred Shawnee. The primary targets of attack were the Washington District colonies along the Watauga, Holston, and Nolichucky Rivers, and in Carter&#x27;s Valley in upper eastern Tennessee, as well as the settlements along the Cumberland River beginning with Fort Nashborough in 1780, even into Kentucky, plus against the Franklin settlements, and later states of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. The scope of attacks by the Chickamauga and their allies ranged from quick raids by small war parties to large campaigns by four or five hundred warriors, and once more than a thousand. The Upper Muskogee under Dragging Canoe&#x27;s close ally Alexander McGillivray frequently joined their campaigns and also operated separately, and the settlements on the Cumberland came under attack from the Chickasaw, Shawnee from the north, and Delaware. Campaigns by Dragging Canoe and his successor John Watts were frequently conducted in conjunction with campaigns in the Northwest Territory. The colonists generally responded with attacks in which Cherokee settlements were completely destroyed, though usually without great loss of life on either side. The wars continued until the Treaty of Tellico Blockhouse in November 1794.

===Northwest Indian War===

In 1787, the Northwest Ordinance officially organized the Northwest Territory for settlement, and American settlers began pouring into the region. Violence erupted as Indian tribes resisted, and so the administration of President George Washington sent armed expeditions into the area. However, in the Northwest Indian War, a pan-tribal confederacy led by Blue Jacket (Shawnee), Little Turtle (Miami), Buckongahelas (Lenape), and Egushawa (Ottawa) defeated armies led by Generals Josiah Harmar and Arthur St. Clair. General St. Clair&#x27;s defeat was the most severe loss ever inflicted upon an American army by Indians. Following the successive defeats, the United States sent delegates to discuss peace with the Northwestern Confederacy, but the two sides could not agree on a boundary line. The United States dispatched a new expedition led by General Anthony Wayne, which defeated the confederacy at the 1794 Battle of Fallen Timbers. Realizing that British assistance was not forthcoming, the native nations were compelled to sign the Treaty of Greenville in 1795, which ceded Ohio and part of Indiana to the United States.

===Tecumseh, the Creek War, and the War of 1812===

By 1800, the Indian population was approximately 600,000 in what would become the contiguous United States. By 1890, their population had declined to about 250,000. In 1800, William Henry Harrison became governor of the Indiana Territory, under the direction of President Thomas Jefferson, and he pursued an aggressive policy of obtaining titles to Indian lands. Shawnee brothers Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa organized Tecumseh&#x27;s War, another pan-tribal resistance to westward settlement.

Tecumseh was in the South attempting to recruit allies among the Creeks, Cherokees, and Choctaws when Harrison marched against the Indian confederacy, defeating Tenskwatawa and his followers at the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811. The Americans hoped that the victory would end the militant resistance, but Tecumseh instead chose to ally openly with the British, who were soon at war with the Americans in the War of 1812. The Creek War (1813–14) began as a tribal conflict within the Creek tribe, but it became part of the larger struggle against American expansion. Tecumseh was killed by Harrison&#x27;s army at the Battle of the Thames, ending the resistance in the Old Northwest. The First Seminole War in 1818 resulted in the transfer of Florida from Spain to the United States in 1819.

===Second Seminole War===

American settlers began to push into Florida, which was now an American territory and had some of the most fertile lands in the nation. Paul Hoffman claims that covetousness, racism, and &quot;self-defense&quot; against Indian raids played a major part in the settlers&#x27; determination to &quot;rid Florida of Indians once and for all&quot;. To compound the tension, runaway black slaves sometimes found refuge in Seminole camps. The result was clashes between white settlers and the Indians residing there. Andrew Jackson sought to alleviate this problem by signing the Indian Removal Act in 1830, which stipulated the relocation of Indians out of Floridaby force if necessary. Many Seminole groups were relatively new arrivals in Florida, led by such powerful leaders as Aripeka (Sam Jones), Micanopy, and Osceola, and they had no intention of leaving their lands. They retaliated against the settlers, and this led to the Second Seminole War, the longest and most costly war that the Army ever waged against Indians.

In May 1830, the Indian Removal Act was passed by Congress which stipulated forced removal of Indians to Oklahoma. The Treaty of Paynes Landing was signed in May 1832 by a few Seminole chiefs who later recanted, claiming that they were tricked or forced to sign and making it clear that they would not consent to relocating to a reservation out west. The Seminoles&#x27; continued resistance to relocation led Florida to prepare for war. The St. Augustine Militia asked the US War Department for the loan of 500 muskets, and 500 volunteers were mobilized under Brig. Gen. Richard K. Call. Indian war parties raided farms and settlements, and families fled to forts or large towns, or out of the territory altogether. A war party led by Osceola captured a Florida militia supply train, killing eight of its guards and wounding six others; most of the goods taken were recovered by the militia in another fight a few days later. Sugar plantations were destroyed along the Atlantic coast south of St. Augustine, Florida, with many of the slaves on the plantations joining the Seminoles.
The US Army had 11 companies (about 550 soldiers) stationed in Florida. Fort King (Ocala) had only one company of soldiers, and it was feared that they might be overrun by the Seminoles. Three companies were stationed at Fort Brooke (Tampa), with another two expected imminently, so the army decided to send two companies to Fort King. On December 23, 1835, the two companies totaling 110 men left Fort Brooke under the command of Major Francis L. Dade. Seminoles shadowed the marching soldiers for five days, and they ambushed them and wiped out the command on December 28. Only three men survived, and one was hunted down and killed by a Seminole the next day. Survivors Ransome Clarke and Joseph Sprague returned to Fort Brooke. Clarke died of his wounds later, and he provided the only account of the battle from the army&#x27;s perspective. The Seminoles lost three men and five wounded. On the same day as the massacre, Osceola and his followers shot and killed Agent Wiley Thompson and six others during an ambush outside of Fort King.

On December 29, General Clinch left Fort Drane with 750 soldiers, including 500 volunteers on an enlistment due to end January 1, 1836. The group was traveling to a Seminole stronghold called the Cove of the Withlacoochee, an area of many lakes on the southwest side of the Withlacoochee River. When they reached the river, the soldiers could not find the ford, so Clinch ferried his regular troops across the river in a single canoe. Once they were across and had relaxed, the Seminoles attacked. The troops fixed bayonets and charged them, at the cost of four dead and 59 wounded. The militia provided cover as the army troops then withdrew across the river.
In the Battle of Lake Okeechobee, Colonel Zachary Taylor saw the first major action of the campaign. He left Fort Gardiner on the upper Kissimmee River with 1,000 men on December 19 and headed towards Lake Okeechobee. In the first two days, 90 Seminoles surrendered. On the third day, Taylor stopped to build Fort Basinger where he left his sick and enough men to guard the Seminoles who had surrendered. Taylor&#x27;s column caught up with the main body of the Seminoles on the north shore of Lake Okeechobee on December 25.

The Seminoles were led by &quot;Alligator&quot;, Sam Jones, and the recently escaped Coacoochee, and they were positioned in a hammock surrounded by sawgrass. The ground was thick mud, and sawgrass easily cuts and burns the skin. Taylor had about 800 men, while the Seminoles numbered fewer than 400. Taylor sent in the Missouri volunteers first, moving his troops squarely into the center of the swamp. His plan was to make a direct attack rather than encircle the Indians. All his men were on foot. As soon as they came within range, the Indians opened with heavy fire. The volunteers broke and their commander Colonel Gentry was fatally wounded, so they retreated back across the swamp. The fighting in the sawgrass was deadliest for five companies of the Sixth Infantry; every officer but one was killed or wounded, along with most of their non-commissioned officers. The soldiers suffered 26 killed and 112 wounded, compared to 11 Seminoles killed and 14 wounded. No Seminoles were captured, although Taylor did capture 100 ponies and 600 head of cattle.
By 1842, the war was winding down and most Seminoles had left Florida for Oklahoma. The US Army officially recorded 1,466 deaths in the Second Seminole War, mostly from disease. The number killed in action is less clear. Mahon reports 328 regular army killed in action, while Missall reports that Seminoles killed 269 officers and men. Almost half of those deaths occurred in the Dade battle, Battle of Lake Okeechobee, and Harney Massacre. Similarly, Mahon reports 69 deaths for the Navy, while Missal reports 41 for the Navy and Marine Corps. Mahon and the Florida Board of State Institutions agree that 55 volunteer officers and men were killed by the Seminoles, while Missall says that the number is unknown. A northern newspaper carried a report that more than 80 civilians were killed by Indians in Florida in 1839. By the end of 1843, 3,824 Indians had been shipped from Florida to the Indian Territory.

==West of the Mississippi (1804–1924)==
The series of conflicts in the western United States between Indians, American settlers, and the United States Army are generally known as the Indian Wars. Many of these conflicts occurred during and after the Civil War until the closing of the frontier in about 1890. However, regions of the West that were settled before the Civil War saw significant conflicts prior to 1860, such as Texas, New Mexico, Utah, Oregon, California, and Washington state.

Various statistics have been developed concerning the devastation of these wars on the peoples involved. Gregory Michno used records dealing with figures &quot;as a direct result of&quot; engagements and concluded that &quot;of the 21,586 total casualties tabulated in this survey, military personnel and civilians accounted for 6,596 (31%), while Indian casualties totaled about 14,990 (69%)&quot; for the period of 1850–90. However, Michno says that he &quot;used the army&#x27;s estimates in almost every case&quot; and &quot;the number of casualties in this study are inherently biased toward army estimations&quot;. His work includes almost nothing on &quot;Indian war parties&quot;, and he states that &quot;army records are often incomplete&quot;.

According to Michno, more conflicts with Indians occurred in the states bordering Mexico than in the interior states. Arizona ranked highest, with 310 known battles fought within the state&#x27;s boundaries between Americans and Indians. Also, Arizona ranked highest of the states in deaths from the wars. At least 4,340 people were killed, including both the settlers and the Indians, over twice as many as occurred in Texas, the second highest-ranking state. Most of the deaths in Arizona were caused by the Apaches. Michno also says that 51 percent of the battles took place in Arizona, Texas, and New Mexico between 1850 and 1890, as well as 37 percent of the casualties in the country west of the Mississippi River.

===Background===
American settlers and fur trappers had spread into the western United States territories and had established the Santa Fe Trail and the Oregon Trail. Relations were generally peaceful between American settlers and Indians. The Bents of Bent&#x27;s Fort on the Santa Fe Trail had friendly relations with the Cheyenne and Arapaho, and peace was established on the Oregon Trail by the Treaty of Fort Laramie signed in 1851 between the United States and the Plains Indians and the Indians of the northern Rocky Mountains. The treaty allowed passage by settlers, building roads, and stationing troops along the Oregon Trail.
The Pike&#x27;s Peak Gold Rush of 1859 introduced a substantial white population into the Front Range of the Rockies, supported by a trading lifeline that crossed the central Great Plains. Advancing settlement following the passage of the Homestead Act of 1862 and the growing transcontinental railways following the Civil War further destabilized the situation, placing white settlers into direct competition for the land and resources of the Great Plains and the Rocky Mountain West. Additional factors included discovery of gold in Montana during the Montana Gold Rush of 1862–1863 and the opening of the Bozeman Trail, which led to Red Cloud&#x27;s War, and later discovery of gold in the Black Hills resulting in the gold rush of 1875–1878 and the Great Sioux War of 1876–77.

Miners, ranchers, and settlers expanded into the plain, and this led to increasing conflicts with the Indian populations of the West. Many tribes fought American settlers at one time or another, from the Utes of the Great Basin to the Nez Perce tribe of Idaho. But the Sioux of the Northern Plains and the Apaches of the Southwest waged the most aggressive warfare, led by resolute, militant leaders such as Red Cloud and Crazy Horse. The Sioux were relatively new arrivals on the Plains, as they had been sedentary farmers in the Great Lakes region previously. They moved west, displacing other Indian tribes and becoming feared warriors. The Apaches supplemented their economy by raiding other tribes, and they practiced warfare to avenge the death of a kinsman.

During the American Civil War, Army units were withdrawn to fight the war in the east. They were replaced by the volunteer infantry and cavalry raised by the states of California and Oregon, by the western territorial governments, or by the local militias. These units fought the Indians and kept open communications with the east, holding the west for the Union and defeating the Confederate attempt to capture the New Mexico Territory. After 1865, national policy called for all Indians either to assimilate into the American population as citizens, or to live peacefully on reservations. Raids and wars between tribes were not allowed, and armed Indian bands off a reservation were the responsibility of the Army to round up and return.

===Texas===
The 18th and early 19th centuries in Texas were characterized by competition and warfare between the Comanches in the north and west of the state and Spanish settlements in the south and east. In the Battle of the Twin Villages in 1759, the Comanche and their Wichita allies defeated a Spanish and Apache army of more than 500 men and halted Spanish expansion in Texas. Comanche raids on Spanish settlements and their Lipan Apache allies in Texas and a defensive Spanish posture characterized the next 70 years. In the 1830s large numbers of Americans began to settle in Texas and they encroached on Comancheria, the proto-empire of the Comanches. A series of battles between Americans and Comanches and their Kiowa and Kiowa Apache allies continued until the 1870s. 

The first notable battle between American settlers and Comanche was the Fort Parker massacre in 1836, in which a war party of Comanches, Kiowas, Wichitas, and Delawares attacked the Texan outpost at Fort Parker. A small number of settlers were killed during the raid, and the abduction of Cynthia Ann Parker and two other children caused widespread outrage among Texans.

The Republic of Texas gained independence from Mexico in 1836. The Texas government under President Sam Houston pursued a policy of engagement with the Comanches and Kiowas. Houston had lived with the Cherokees, but the Cherokees joined with Mexican forces to fight against Texas. Houston resolved the conflict without resorting to arms, refusing to believe that the Cherokees would take up arms against his government. The administration of Mirabeau B. Lamar followed Houston&#x27;s and took a very different policy towards the Indians. Lamar removed the Cherokees to the west and then sought to deport the Comanches and Kiowas. This led to a series of battles, including the Council House Fight, in which the Texas militia killed 33 Comanche chiefs at a peace parley. The Comanches retaliated with the Great Raid of 1840, and the Battle of Plum Creek followed several days later.

The Lamar Administration was known for its failed and expensive Indian policy; the cost of the war with the Indians exceeded the annual revenue of the government throughout his four-year term. It was followed by a second Houston administration, which resumed the previous policy of diplomacy. Texas signed treaties with all of the tribes, including the Comanches. In the 1840s and 1850s, the Comanches and their allies shifted most of their raiding to a weak and newly independent Mexico. Comanche armies numbering in the hundreds raided deep into Mexico for horses and captives and used Texas as a safe haven from Mexican retaliation (see Comanche–Mexico Wars).

Texas joined the Union in 1845, and the Federal government and Texas took up the struggle between the Plains Indians and the settlers. The conflicts were particularly vicious and bloody on the Texas frontier in 1856 through 1858, as settlers continued to expand their settlements into Comancheria. The first Texan incursion into the heart of the Comancheria was in 1858, the so-called Antelope Hills Expedition marked by the Battle of Little Robe Creek.

The battles between settlers and Indians continued in 1860, and Texas militia destroyed an Indian camp at the Battle of Pease River. In the aftermath of the battle, the Texans learned that they had recaptured Cynthia Ann Parker, the little girl captured by the Comanches in 1836. She returned to live with her family, but she missed her children, including her son Quanah Parker. He was the son of Parker and Comanche Chief Peta Nocona, and he became a Comanche war chief at the Second Battle of Adobe Walls. He ultimately surrendered to the overwhelming force of the federal government and moved to a reservation in southwestern Oklahoma in 1875.

===Pacific Northwest===
On 1–4 October 1804, Russian America (now the state of Alaska) had suppressed a revolt by the Tlingit Kiks.ádi Clan during the battle of Sitka.

A number of wars occurred in the wake of the Oregon Treaty of 1846 and the creation of Oregon Territory and Washington Territory. Among the causes of conflict were a sudden immigration to the region and a series of gold rushes throughout the Pacific Northwest. The Whitman massacre of 1847 triggered the Cayuse War, which led to fighting from the Cascade Range to the Rocky Mountains. The Cayuse were defeated in 1855, but the conflict had expanded and continued in what became known as the Yakima War (1855–1858). Washington Territory Governor Isaac Stevens tried to compel Indian tribes to sign treaties ceding land and establishing reservations. The Yakama signed one of the treaties negotiated during the Walla Walla Council of 1855, establishing the Yakama Indian Reservation, but Stevens&#x27; attempts served mainly to intensify hostilities. Gold discoveries near Fort Colville resulted in many miners crossing Yakama lands via Naches Pass, and conflicts rapidly escalated into violence. It took several years for the Army to defeat the Yakama, during which time war spread to the Puget Sound region west of the Cascades. The Puget Sound War of 1855–1856 was triggered in part by the Yakima War and in part by the use of intimidation to compel tribes to sign land cession treaties. The Treaty of Medicine Creek of 1855 established an unrealistically small reservation on poor land for the Nisqually and Puyallup tribes. Violence broke out in the White River valley, along the route to Naches Pass and connecting Nisqually and Yakama lands. The Puget Sound War is often remembered in connection with the Battle of Seattle (1856) and the execution of Nisqually Chief Leschi, a central figure of the war.

In 1858, the fighting spread on the east side of the Cascades. This second phase of the Yakima War is known as the Coeur d&#x27;Alene War. The Yakama, Palouse, Spokane, and Coeur d&#x27;Alene tribes were defeated at the Battle of Four Lakes in late 1858.

In southwest Oregon, tensions and skirmishes escalated between American settlers and the Rogue River peoples into the Rogue River Wars of 1855–1856. The California Gold Rush helped fuel a large increase in the number of people traveling south through the Rogue River Valley. Gold discoveries continued to trigger violent conflict between prospectors and Indians. Beginning in 1858, the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush in British Columbia drew large numbers of miners, many from Washington, Oregon, and California, culminating in the Fraser Canyon War. This conflict occurred in the Colony of British Columbia, but the militias involved were formed mostly of Americans.

Shortly after the Fraser Canyon War the Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast, including areas that are now part of the United States and Canada, from Washington to Alaska, suffered major population loss, cultural devastation, and loss of sovereignty due to the 1862 Pacific Northwest smallpox epidemic. The Chilcotin War of 1864 occurred near the end of the epidemic when a road from the gold fields to the coast was being built through Tsilhqotʼin (Chilcotin) territory without permission. At the time, and still today, First Nations such as the Tsilhqotʼin say the colonial government deliberately spread smallpox with the aim of ending indigenous sovereignty and indigenous rights in British Columbia. Workers on the road-building project threatened the Tsilhqotʼin with smallpox. The war ended with the hanging of six Tsilhqotʼin chiefs. In 2014, British Columbia Premier Christy Clark formally exonerated the executed chiefs and apologized for these acts, acknowledging that &quot;there is an indication [that smallpox] was spread intentionally.&quot; The discovery of gold in Idaho and Oregon in the 1860s led to similar conflicts which culminated in the Bear River Massacre in 1863 and Snake War from 1864 to 1868.

In the late 1870s, another series of armed conflicts occurred in Oregon and Idaho, spreading east into Wyoming and Montana. The Nez Perce War of 1877 is known particularly for Chief Joseph and the four-month, 1,200-mile fighting retreat of a band of about 800 Nez Perce, including women and children. The Nez Perce War was caused by a large influx of settlers, the appropriation of Indian lands, and a gold rush—this time in Idaho. The Nez Perce engaged 2,000 American soldiers of different military units, as well as their Indian auxiliaries. They fought &quot;eighteen engagements, including four major battles and at least four fiercely contested skirmishes&quot;, according to Alvin Josephy. Chief Joseph and the Nez Perce were much admired for their conduct in the war and their fighting ability.

The Bannock War broke out the following year for similar reasons. The Sheepeater Indian War in 1879 was the last conflict in the area.

===Southwest===
Various wars between Spanish and Native Americans, mainly Comanches and Apaches, took place from the 17th to the 19th century in the Southwest United States. Spanish governors made peace treaties with some tribes during this period. Several events stand out during the colonial period: On the one hand, the administration of Tomás Vélez Cachupín, the only colonial governor of New Mexico who managed to establish peace with the Comanches after having confronted them in the Battle of San Diego Pond, and learned how to relate to them without giving rise to misunderstandings that could lead to conflict with them. The Pueblo Revolt of 1680 was also highlighted, causing the Spanish province to be divided into two areas: one led by the Spanish governor and the other by the leader of the Pueblos. Several military conflicts happened between Spaniards and Pueblos in this period until Diego de Vargas made a peace treaty with them in 1691, which made them subjects of the Spanish governor again. Conflicts between Europeans and indigenous peoples continued following the acquisition of Alta California and Santa Fe de Nuevo México from Mexico at the end of the Mexican–American War in 1848, and the Gadsden Purchase in 1853. These spanned from 1846 to at least 1895. The first conflicts were in the New Mexico Territory, and later in California and the Utah Territory during and after the California Gold Rush.

Indian tribes in the southwest had been engaged in cycles of trading and fighting with one another and with settlers for centuries prior to the United States gaining control of the region. These conflicts with the United States involved every non-pueblo tribe in the region and often were a continuation of Mexican–Spanish conflicts. The Navajo Wars and Apache Wars are perhaps the best known. The last major campaign of the military against Indians in the Southwest involved 5,000 troops in the field, and resulted in the surrender of Chiricahua Apache Geronimo and his band of 24 warriors, women, and children in 1886. 

===California===
The U.S. Army kept a small garrison west of the Rockies, but starting in 1849, the California Gold Rush brought a great influx of miners and settlers into the area. The result was that most of the early conflicts with the California Indians involved local parties of miners or settlers. During the American Civil War, California volunteers replaced Federal troops and won the ongoing Bald Hills War and the Owens Valley Indian War and engaged in minor actions in northern California. California and Oregon volunteer garrisons in Nevada, Oregon, Idaho, Utah, New Mexico, and the Arizona Territories also engaged in conflicts with the Apache, Cheyenne, Goshute, Navajo, Paiute, Shoshone, Sioux, and Ute Indians from 1862 to 1866. Following the Civil War, California was mostly pacified, but federal troops replaced the volunteers and again took up the struggle against Indians in the remote regions of the Mojave Desert, and in the northeast during the Snake War (1864–1868) and Modoc War (1872–1873).

===Great Basin===
The tribes of the Great Basin were mostly Shoshone, and they were greatly affected by the Oregon and California Trails and by Mormon pioneers to Utah. The Shoshone had friendly relations with American and British fur traders and trappers, beginning with their encounter with Lewis and Clark.

The traditional way of life of the Indians was disrupted, and they began raiding travelers along the trails and aggression toward Mormon settlers. During the American Civil War, the California Volunteers stationed in Utah responded to complaints, which resulted in the Bear River Massacre. Following the massacre, various Shoshone tribes signed a series of treaties exchanging promises of peace for small annuities and reservations. One of these was the Box Elder Treaty which identified a land claim made by the Northwestern Shoshone. The Supreme Court declared this claim to be non-binding in a 1945 ruling, but the Indian Claims Commission recognized it as binding in 1968. Descendants of the original group were compensated collectively at a rate of less than $0.50 per acre, minus legal fees.

Most of the local groups were decimated by the war and faced continuing loss of hunting and fishing land caused by the steadily growing population. Some moved to the Fort Hall Indian Reservation when it was created in 1868. Some of the Shoshone populated the Mormon-sanctioned community of Washakie, Utah. From 1864 California and Oregon Volunteers also engaged in the early campaigns of the Snake War in the Great Basin areas of California, Nevada, Oregon and Idaho. From 1866 the U.S. Army replaced the Volunteers in that war which General George Crook brought to an end in 1868 after a protracted campaign.

===Great Plains===

Initially relations between participants in the Pike&#x27;s Peak gold rush and the Native American tribes of the Front Range and the Platte valley were friendly. An attempt was made to resolve conflicts by negotiation of the Treaty of Fort Wise, which established a reservation in southeastern Colorado, but the settlement was not agreed to by all of the roving warriors, particularly the Dog Soldiers. During the early 1860s tensions increased and culminated in the Colorado War and the Sand Creek Massacre, where Colorado volunteers fell on a peaceful Cheyenne village killing women and children, which set the stage for further conflict.

The cohabitative relationship between settlers and the Indians of the Colorado and Kansas plains was maintained by the tribes, but sentiment grew among the Colorado settlers for Indian removal. The severity of the attacks on civilians during the Dakota War of 1862 contributed to these sentiments, as did the few minor incidents which occurred in the Platte Valley and in areas east of Denver. Regular army troops had been withdrawn for service in the Civil War and were replaced with the Colorado Volunteers, frontier-dwelling men who often favored extermination of the Indians. They were commanded by John Chivington and George L. Shoup, who followed the lead of John Evans, territorial governor of Colorado. They adopted a policy of shooting on sight all Indians encountered, a policy which in short time ignited a general war on the Colorado and Kansas plains, the Colorado War.

Raids by bands of plains Indians on isolated homesteads to the east of Denver, on the advancing settlements in Kansas, on stage line stations along the South Platte, such as at Julesburg, and along the Smoky Hill Trail, resulted in many settlers in both Colorado and Kansas adopting a very hostile attitude towards Native Americans, with calls for extermination. Likewise, the violence shown by the Colorado Volunteers during the Sand Creek Massacre resulted in Native Americans, particularly the Dog Soldiers, a band of the Cheyenne, engaging in similarly violent retribution.

====Dakota War====

The Dakota War of 1862 (more commonly called the Sioux Uprising of 1862 in older authorities and popular texts) was the first major armed engagement between the U.S. and the Sioux (Dakota). After six weeks of fighting in Minnesota, led mostly by Chief Taoyateduta (aka, Little Crow), records conclusively show that more than 500 U.S. soldiers and settlers died in the conflict, though many more may have died in small raids or after being captured. The number of Sioux dead in the uprising is mostly undocumented. After the war, 303 Sioux warriors were convicted of murder and rape by U.S. military tribunals and sentenced to death. Most of the death sentences were commuted by President Lincoln, but on December 26, 1862, in Mankato, Minnesota, 38 Dakota Sioux men were hanged in what is still today the largest penal mass execution in U.S. history.

After the expulsion of the Dakota, some refugees and warriors made their way to Lakota lands in what is now North Dakota. Battles continued between Minnesota regiments and combined Lakota and Dakota forces through 1864, as Colonel Henry Sibley pursued the Sioux into Dakota Territory. Sibley&#x27;s army defeated the Lakota and Dakota in three major battles in 1863: the Battle of Dead Buffalo Lake on July 26, 1863, the Battle of Stony Lake on July 28, 1863, and the Battle of Whitestone Hill on September 3, 1863. The Sioux retreated further, but again faced an American army in 1864; this time, Gen. Alfred Sully led a force from near Fort Pierre, South Dakota, and decisively defeated the Sioux at the Battle of Killdeer Mountain on July 28, 1864.

====Colorado War, Sand Creek Massacre, and the Sioux War of 1865====
On November 29, 1864, the Colorado territory militia responded to a series of Indian attacks on white settlements by attacking a Cheyenne and Arapaho encampment on Sand Creek in southeastern Colorado, under orders to take no prisoners. The militia killed about 200 of the Indians, two-thirds of whom were women and children, taking scalps and other grisly trophies.

Following the massacre, the survivors joined the camps of the Cheyenne on the Smokey Hill and Republican Rivers. They smoked the war pipe and passed it from camp to camp among the Sioux, Cheyenne, and Arapaho camped in the area, and they planned an attack on the stage station and fort at Julesburg which they carried out in the January 1865 Battle of Julesburg. This attack was followed up by numerous raids along the South Platte both east and west of Julesburg, and by a second raid on Julesburg in early February. The bulk of the Indians then moved north into Nebraska on their way to the Black Hills and the Powder River. In the spring of 1865, raids continued along the Oregon trail in Nebraska. Indians raided the Oregon Trail along the North Platte River and attacked the troops stationed at the bridge across the North Platte at Casper, Wyoming in the Battle of Platte Bridge.

====Sheridan&#x27;s campaigns====

After the Civil War, all of the Indians were assigned to reservations, and the reservations were under the control of the Interior Department. Control of the Great Plains fell under the Army&#x27;s Department of the Missouri, an administrative area of over 1,000,000 mi2 encompassing all land between the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains. Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock had led the department in 1866 but had mishandled his campaign, resulting in Sioux and Cheyenne raids that attacked mail stagecoaches, burned the stations, and killed the employees. They also raped, killed, and kidnapped settlers on the frontier.

Philip Sheridan was the military governor of Louisiana and Texas in 1866, but President Johnson removed him from that post, claiming that he was ruling over the area with absolute tyranny and insubordination. Shortly after, Hancock was removed as head of the Department of the Missouri and Sheridan replaced him in August 1867. He was ordered to pacify the plains and take control of the Indians there, and he immediately called General Custer back to command of the 7th Cavalry; Hancock had suspended him.

The Department of Missouri was in poor shape upon Sheridan&#x27;s arrival. Commissioners from the government had signed a peace treaty in October 1867 with the Comanche, Kiowa, Kiowa Apache, Cheyenne, and Arapaho which offered them reservation land to live on along with food and supplies, but Congress failed to pass it. The promised supplies from the government were not reaching the Indians and they were beginning to starve, numbering an estimated 6,000. Sheridan had only 2,600 men at the time to control them and to defend against any raids or attacks, and only 1,200 of his men were mounted. These men were also under-supplied and stationed at forts that were in poor condition. They were also mostly unproven units that replaced retired veterans from the Civil War.

Sheridan attempted to improve the conditions of the military outpost and the Indians on the plains through a peace-oriented strategy. Toward the beginning of his command, members of the Cheyenne and Arapaho followed him on his travels from Fort Larned to Fort Dodge where he spoke to them. They brought their problems to him and explained how the promised supplies were not being delivered. In response, Sheridan gave them a supply of rations. Shortly after, the Saline Valley settlements were attacked by Indians, and that was followed by other violent raids and kidnappings in the region. Sheridan wanted to respond in force but was constrained by the government&#x27;s peace policy and the lack of well-supplied mounted troops. He could not deploy official military units, so he commissioned a group of 47 frontiersmen and sharpshooters called Solomon&#x27;s Avengers. They investigated the raids near Arickaree Creek and were attacked by Indians on September 17, 1868. The Avengers were under siege for eight days by some 700 Indian warriors, but they were able to keep them at bay until military units arrived to help. The Avengers lost six men and another 15 were wounded. Sherman finally gave Sheridan authority to respond in force to these threats.
Sheridan believed that his soldiers would be unable to chase the horses of the Indians during the summer months, so he used them as a defensive force the remainder of September and October. His forces were better fed and clothed than the Indians and they could launch a campaign in the winter months. His winter campaign of 1868 started with the 19th Kansas Volunteers from Custer&#x27;s 7th Cavalry, along with five battalions of infantry under Major John H. Page setting out from Fort Dodge on November 5. A few days later, a force moved from Fort Bascom to Fort Cobb consisting of units of the 5th Cavalry Regiment and two companies of infantry, where they met up with units from the 3rd Cavalry leaving from Fort Lyon. Sheridan directed the opening month of the campaign from Camp Supply. The Units from the 5th and 3rd Cavalry met at Fort Cobb without any sign of the 19th Kansas, but they had a lead on a band of Indians nearby and Custer led a force after them.

Custer&#x27;s force attacked the Cheyenne Indians and Black Kettle in the Battle of Washita River, and an estimated 100 Indians were killed and 50 taken prisoner. Custer lost 21 men killed and 13 men wounded, and a unit went missing under Major Elliott&#x27;s command. Custer shot 675 ponies that were vital for the Indians&#x27; survival on the plains. Immediately following the battle, Sheridan received backlash from Washington politicians who defended Black Kettle as a peace-loving Indian. This began the controversy as to whether the event was best described as a military victory or as a massacre, a discussion which endures among historians to this day.
Following Washita, Sheridan oversaw the refitting of the 19th Kansas and personally led them down the Washita River toward the Wichita Mountains. He met with Custer along the Washita River and they searched for Major Elliott&#x27;s missing unit. They found the bodies of the missing unit and the bodies of Mrs. Blynn and her child who had been taken by Indians the previous summer near Fort Lyon. The defeat at Washita had scared many of the tribes and Sheridan was able to round up the majority of the Kiowa and Comanche people at Fort Cobb in December and transport them to reservations. He began negotiations with Chief Little Robe of the Cheyenne and with Yellow Bear about living on the reservations. Sheridan then began the construction of Camp Sill, later called Fort Sill, named after General Sill who died at Stone River.

Sheridan was called back to Washington following the election of President Grant. He was informed of his promotion to lieutenant general of the army and reassigned from the department. Sheridan protested and was allowed to stay in Missouri with the rank of lieutenant general. The last remnants of Indian resistance came from Tall Bull Dog soldiers and elements of the Sioux and Northern Cheyenne tribes. The 5th Cavalry from Fort McPherson were sent to handle the situation on the Platte River in Nebraska. In May, the two forces collided at Summit Springs and the Indians were pursued out of the region. This brought an end to Sheridan&#x27;s campaign, as the Indians had successfully been removed from the Platte and Arkansas and the majority of those in Kansas had been settled onto reservations. Sheridan left in 1869 to take command of the Army and was replaced by Major General Schofield.

====Black Hills War====

In 1875, the Great Sioux War of 1876–77 erupted when the Dakota gold rush penetrated the Black Hills. The government decided to stop evicting trespassers from the Black Hills and offered to buy the land from the Sioux. When they refused, the government decided instead to take the land and gave the Lakota until January 31, 1876, to return to reservations. The tribes did not return to the reservations by the deadline, and Lt. Colonel George Custer found the main encampment of the Lakota and their allies at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Custer and his men were separated from their main body of troops, and they were all killed by the far more numerous Indians led by Crazy Horse and inspired by Sitting Bull&#x27;s earlier vision of victory. The Anheuser-Busch brewing company made prints of a dramatic painting that depicted &quot;Custer&#x27;s Last Fight&quot; and had them framed and hung in many American saloons as an advertising campaign, helping to create a popular image of this battle.
The Lakotas conducted a Ghost Dance ritual on the reservation at Wounded Knee, South Dakota in 1890, and the Army attempted to subdue them. Gunfire erupted on December 29 during this attempt, and soldiers killed up to 300 Indians, mostly old men, women, and children in the Wounded Knee Massacre. Following the massacre, &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; author L. Frank Baum wrote: &quot;The &quot;Pioneer&quot; has before declared that our only safety depends upon the total extirmination of the Indians. Having wronged them for centuries we had better, in order to protect our civilization, follow it up by one more wrong and wipe these untamed and untamable creatures from the face of the earth.&quot;

===Last conflicts===

Many sources place the end of the American Indian Wars in the 1890s (1890 to 1901). The last campaign of the Indian Wars that has been designated by the U.S. Army, the Pine Ridge Campaign, ended in 1891.

Scattered incidents of armed conflict between Indians and whites continued into the 1920s.
* 1895: Jackson Hole, Wyoming: Bannock War of 1895; minor conflict between Bannocks and the U.S. Army
* April-June 1896: United States, Mexico: Apache Campaign (1896); last U.S. Army operation against Apaches who were raiding and not living in a reservation
* August 12-14, 1896: Arizona, Sonora: Yaqui Uprising: armed conflict between Yaquis and American militia, the Buffalo Soldiers, the Mexican Army, and local police
* October 5, 1898: Leech Lake, Minnesota: Battle of Sugar Point; last Medal of Honor given for Indian Wars campaigns was awarded to Private Oscar Burkard of the 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment.
* November 11, 1899: Near Leupp, Arizona: Padre Canyon incident; skirmish between Navajo hunters &amp; a posse of Arizona lawmen
* 1907: Four Corners, Arizona: Two troops of the 5th Cavalry from Fort Wingate skirmish with armed Navajo men; one Navajo was killed and the rest escaped.
* March 1909: Crazy Snake Rebellion, Oklahoma: Federal officials attack the Muscogee Creeks and allied Freedmen who had resisted forcible allotment and division of tribal lands by the federal government since 1901, headquartered at Hickory ceremonial grounds in Oklahoma; a two-day gun battle seriously wounded leader Chitto Harjo and quelled this rebellion.
* 1911: Chaco Canyon, New Mexico: A company of cavalry went from Fort Wingate to quell an alleged uprising by some Navajo.
* January 19, 1911: Washoe County, Nevada: The Last Massacre occurred; a group of Shoshones and Bannocks killed four ranchers; on February 26, 1911, eight of the Indians involved in the Last Massacre were killed by a posse in the Battle of Kelley Creek; the remaining four were captured.
* March 1914 – March 15, 1915: Bluff War in Utah between Ute Indians and Mormon residents.
* January 9, 1918: Santa Cruz County, Arizona: The Battle of Bear Valley was fought in Southern Arizona; Army forces of the 10th Cavalry engaged and captured a band of Yaquis, after a brief firefight.
* 1921: Bluff Skirmish in Utah between Utes and settlers
* March 20–23, 1923: Posey War in Utah between Ute and Paiute Indians against Mormon residents.
* 1924: The Apache Wars ended in 1924 and brought the American Indian Wars to a close. This ended the post-1887 Apache Wars period.
==Effects on the American Indian population==

The 2020 United States Census found 3,727,135 Americans who identified themselves as being solely American Indian or Alaskan Native, about 1% of the US population. A combined total of 9,666,058 Americans identified themselves as being Native American or Alaskan Native (including in combination with another race), about 3% of the US population. The Canada 2011 Census found 1,836,035 Canadians who identified themselves as being First Nations, Inuit, Métis (mixed race), about 4.3% of the Canadian population. No consensus exists on how many people lived in the Americas before the arrival of Europeans, but extensive research continues to be conducted. Contemporary estimates range from 2.1 million to 18 million people living on the North American continent prior to European colonization. About 600,000 Native Americans lived in the areas comprising the modern United States in 1800 (including areas not part of the 1800 United States), shortly after the country&#x27;s independence. This was reduced to an estimated 250,000 by 1890 before increasing in the 20th century.

The number of Indians dropped to below half a million in the 19th century because of Eurasian diseases such as influenza, pneumonic plagues, and smallpox, in combination with conflict, forced removal, enslavement, imprisonment, and outright warfare with European newcomers reduced populations and disrupted traditional societies.

The United States Census Bureau (1894) provided their estimate of deaths due specifically to war during the 102 years between 1789 and 1891, including 8,500 Indians and 5,000 whites killed in &quot;individual affairs&quot;:

The Indian wars under the government of the United States have been more than 40 in number. They have cost the lives of about 19,000 white men, women and children, including those killed in individual combats, and the lives of about 30,000 Indians. The actual number of killed and wounded Indians must be very much higher than the number given ... Fifty percent additional would be a safe estimate.

Jeffrey Ostler, the Beekman Professor of Northwest and Pacific History at the University of Oregon, stated, &quot;it was genocidal war.&quot; Xabier Irujo, professor of genocide studies at the University of Nevada, Reno, stated, &quot;the toll on human lives in the wars against the native nations between 1848 and 1881 was horrific.&quot;

==Historiography==
According to historian David Rich Lewis, American popular histories, film, and fiction have given enormous emphasis to the Indian wars. New ethno-historical approaches became popular in the 1970s which mixed anthropology with historical research in hopes of gaining a deeper understanding of the Indian perspective. During the 1980s, human rights abuses by the US government were increasingly studied by historians exploring the impact of the wars on Indian cultures. Prior to this, popular history was heavily influenced by Dee Brown&#x27;s non-academic treatment of historical events in the 1970 non-fiction book, &quot;Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee&quot;. In more academic history, Francis Jennings&#x27;s 1975 book &quot;The Invasion of America: Indians, Colonialism, and the Cant of Conquest&quot; was notable for criticizing the Puritans and rejecting the traditional portrayal of the wars between the Indians and colonists. The revisionist historian Jeffrey Ostler has argued that some of the events within the American Indian Wars would fit into the modern legal definition of genocide.

<doc id="386556" wikidata="Q529857" url="?curid=386556" title="White-backed duck">
<text>The white-backed duck (Thalassornis leuconotus) is a waterbird of the family Anatidae. It is distinct from all other ducks, but most closely related to the whistling ducks in the subfamily Dendrocygninae, though also showing some similarities to the stiff-tailed ducks in the subfamily Oxyurinae. It is the only member of the genus &quot;Thalassornis&quot;.

==Description==
These birds are well adapted for diving. On occasions they have been observed to stay under water for up to half a minute. They search especially for the bulbs of waterlilies, but also seeds and leaves of waterlilies and other water plants and the young feed on lake flies larvae as well. From danger, they also escape preferentially by diving; hence, the namesake white back is hardly visible in life.
==Distribution and habitat==
White-backed ducks live in Africa, especially between Senegal and Chad in the west, Ethiopia in the east, and South Africa in the south. Their habitat consists of lakes, ponds, swamps and marshes where they are well camouflaged against predators.

==Subspecies==
There are two subspecies, &quot;Thalassornis leuconotus leuconotus&quot; and &quot;Thalassornis leuconotus insularis&quot;. The latter lives entirely on Madagascar and is considered endangered as a result of hunting, habitat loss and the introduction of competing exotic species.

==Conservation==
The white-backed duck is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.

Woolaver and Nichols conducted a nesting survey of the Madagascar race in 2001 at Lake Antsamaka in western Madagascar. They found a total of 37, indicating the significance of this single site for the conservation of this insular subspecies. Young, et al. (2006) suggested that an earlier population estimate of 2,500–5,000 total birds in Madagascar by Delany and Scott may be too optimistic. Its African population may be in the range of 10,000 to 25,000 birds.

<text>Sandra Shamas (born 1957) is a Canadian puppeteer, comedic actress, writer, director and producer.

==Biography==
Shamas was born in Sudbury, Ontario. She moved to Toronto in 1980, where she held a variety of jobs before a workshop at The Second City inspired her to pursue a career in performing arts. She acted with Second City and Theatresports, and worked as a puppeteer on the children&#x27;s series &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot; before deciding to strike out on her own.

In 1987, she premiered her first show, &quot;My Boyfriend&#x27;s Back and There&#x27;s Gonna Be Laundry&quot; at the Edmonton Fringe Festival. The show, a mixture of personal stories drawn from her own life and observational humour about dating and relationships, was a smash hit of the festival, and soon Shamas was on tour performing the show across the country. In 1989, she began performing the sequel, &quot;My Boyfriend&#x27;s Back and There&#x27;s Gonna Be Laundry II: The Cycle Continues&quot;. A third show, &quot;Wedding Bell Hell&quot;, dealing with wedding rituals such as the bridal shower and selection of the wedding rings and dress, made its debut in 1991. In 1993, she took &quot;Laundry&quot; to the Old Vic Theatre in London for her first performance outside Canada, and was well received by the British audience and critics. 

After some time away from the spotlight, Shamas returned with a new series of shows, &quot;Wit&#x27;s End&quot;, &quot;Wit&#x27;s End II...Heart&#x27;s Desire&quot;, and &quot;Wit&#x27;s End III...Love Life.&quot; These shows revolved around her move to the country after buying a farm in Southern Ontario.

Shamas has been nominated for the Governor General&#x27;s Award and the Stephen Leacock Award for the &quot;Laundry&quot; trilogy. She won a Gemini Award in 1991 for Best Performance in Comedy, and won the Best Theatre Award at the U.S. Comedy Arts Festival in March 2003.

Shamas&#x27; play &quot;The Big What Now&quot; premiered in 2017 at the Harbourfront Centre in Toronto. &quot;The Big What Now&quot; is about menopause and being a woman over the age of 50.

In January 2018, Shamas was appointed to the Order of Ontario.

<doc id="386558" wikidata="Q905053" url="?curid=386558" title="Pacific giant salamander">
<text>The Pacific giant salamanders are members of the genus Dicamptodon. They are large salamanders endemic to the Pacific Northwest in North America. They are included in the family Ambystomatidae, or alternatively, in their own monogeneric family Dicamptodontidae.

==Description==

Pacific giant salamanders are defined by their wide protruding eyes, costal grooves, thick arms, and dark background coloring. &quot;Dicamptodon&quot; have a snout-vent-length (SVL) of , a broad head, laterally flexible flattened tails, paired premaxillae that are separate from the nasals, and the aquatic larvae have gills. &quot;Dicamptodon&quot; have lacrimals and pterygoids that are present, but quadratojugal are absent.

While most salamanders are silent, the Pacific giant salamander is one of several salamanders that have vocal abilities. When startled, these salamanders may respond with a croaky-sounding cry similar to that of a barking dog.

== Habitat ==
Pacific giant salamanders are semi-aquatic animals that occupy both aquatic and terrestrial habitats. They are commonly found in various lotic environments in altitudes ranging from 0 to 7000 feet above sea level in the Pacific Northwest and Northern California. Aquatic salamander abundance has been shown to increase with increasing rock coverage, and decrease with increasing water velocity, and tend to prefer cold mountain streams and lakes. Pacific giant salamanders also utilize terrestrial refuge sites such as decaying wood, burrows, or under rocks.

== Taxonomy ==
The genus &quot;Dicamptodon&quot; was formerly thought to contain two species, Cope&#x27;s giant salamander (&quot;D. copei&quot;) on the Olympic Peninsula, Washington, and the Pacific giant salamander (&quot;D. ensatus&quot;) which consisted of three geographic populations, an Idaho isolate, a group in northern California, and a group in Oregon and Washington. In 1989, genetic studies showed &quot;D. copei&quot; to be a distinct species, and the &quot;D. ensatus&quot; populations to consist of three species: the Idaho giant salamander (&quot;D. aterrimus&quot;) in Idaho, and two highly divergent species with a narrow hybrid zone in California, the coastal giant salamander (&quot;D. tenebrosus&quot;) (ranging from northern California to Washington), and the California giant salamander (&quot;D. ensatus&quot;) (limited only from Santa Cruz County to Mendocino County in California). The earliest known member of this genus and family is &quot;D. antiquus&quot; from the Paleocene of Alberta.

===Extant species===
There are four extant &quot;Dicamptodon&quot; species.

<text>Caldecote (pronounced &quot;) is a hamlet in the civil parish of Moulsoe in the City of Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, England, situated roughly south of Newport Pagnell, and roughly north-east of Central Milton Keynes.

== History ==
The place name is fairly common in England and comes from an Old English term meaning &quot;cold cottage&quot;, referring to a resting place for travellers or other strangers on the road. The original Northampton to London road (modern B526) runs nearby. The route was diverted in 1728 along a new road on the higher ground east of the village, causing the latter to decline.

Caldecote was recorded in the Domesday Book as &quot;Caldecote&quot;.

The place name was once used elsewhere in Buckinghamshire in the ancient village adjacent to Bedgrove.

== Location ==
The modern area is the triangle defined by the M1 motorway, the A422 road and the A509 road. It is mostly farmland and designated as urban open space since it is substantially within the flood plain of the River Ouzel (or Lovat).

== See also ==
There is also another ancient village (and now a modern development and balancing lake) in nearby Walton (civil parish), with the very similar name of Caldecotte.

<text>Amelia Peabody Emerson is the protagonist of the Amelia Peabody series, a series of historical mystery novels written by author Elizabeth Peters (a pseudonym of Egyptologist Barbara Mertz, 1927–2013). Peabody is married to Egyptologist Radcliffe Emerson and has one biological child, Walter &quot;Ramses&quot; Peabody Emerson.

== Biographical sketch ==
Amelia Peabody is first introduced in the novel &quot;Crocodile on the Sandbank&quot;, set in 1884. She is the spinster daughter of a reclusive scholar who left her to deal with practical issues such as shopping and administering the household while he spent time in his office. He nurtured her scholarly interest, while the rest of her immediate family dismissed them both. Following his death, Peabody&#x27;s devotion to her father was rewarded with her being named sole beneficiary of his substantial fortune of over £500,000 (over £30 million in 2006 values). Partly in order to escape the attention of numerous fortune-hunting suitors and relatives begging for money, she embarks on a tour of classical sites, beginning in Italy and moving on to Egypt with the eventual aim of visiting Palestine. While in Rome, she rescues a young woman in trouble, Evelyn Barton Forbes, whom she hires to be her companion.

In Egypt, the pair encounters the Emerson brothers, Radcliffe, an archaeologist, and Walter, a philologist. Over the course of the novel, Walter pursues Evelyn resulting in their engagement by the book&#x27;s end—while less overt, the relationship between Amelia and Radcliffe develops toward their own marriage. In keeping with the egalitarian nature of their relationship, the two propose to each other, with Amelia teasing that she agreed because marriage to Emerson was the only way that she could engage in Egyptology without causing a scandal.

The pair refer to each other by their respective surnames: Emerson refers to Amelia as &quot;Peabody,&quot; using her first name only when he is annoyed with her. In turn, Peabody refers to Radcliffe Emerson almost exclusively by his surname, &quot;Emerson&quot;, although some other family members call him Radcliffe. It is eventually revealed that he dislikes his first name as it was his estranged mother&#x27;s maiden name.

Peabody&#x27;s first (and only) child, Walter, was born in 1887. Walter quickly became known as &quot;Ramses&quot;, after Emerson remarked that he was &quot;swarthy as an Egyptian and arrogant as a pharaoh.&quot;

The majority of the series is written in Amelia&#x27;s voice, with Ramses providing a supplemental parallel narrative in many of the later books, identified as &quot;Manuscript H.&quot;

== Personality ==
Amelia Peabody is presented as a head-strong, confident woman who capably ran her father&#x27;s household and bullied local merchants in the course of bargaining. It is quickly established that she has no patience with &quot;helpless&quot; women who play on their femininity to manipulate others into doing their will; i.e., &quot;swooning, weak-minded females&quot;, according to Emerson. When home in England, she is a strong supporter of and is occasionally involved in the Suffragette Movement. She is a proponent of rational dress, and often refuses to wear a corset. (See &quot;Deeds of the Disturber&quot; for a notable exception.)

With the introduction of the Manuscript H fragments in &quot;Seeing a Large Cat&quot; the reader is introduced to her family&#x27;s loving perceptions of her, which includes recognition of her extraordinary stubbornness, and utter conviction that she is right, even when she contradicts herself in the assertion. This is dealt with in good humor and affection by her family. Amelia is also addicted to romance (although she denies it vehemently), much more sentimental than she admits to and, despite her disdain for weak-willed women who employ impractical fashion, vain enough to go to great lengths to color her graying hair and hide her efforts particularly from Emerson.

At the core of her personality is her deep love for her husband (and his for her), as well as the mutual respect they share for one another.. A favourite expression of hers is &quot;Another shirt ruined...&quot; because Emerson regularly bursts out of his shirt, either in the course of an adventure or in the throes of passion. The relationship between Amelia and Emerson may best be described as &#x27;Brontean&#x27;; the story of the handsome but rough-mannered hero tamed by the right woman plays out according to classic Romantic formula. She extends this view to her family and acquaintances, often imagining relationships that are not there, while totally missing those that are, until she is shocked by the revelation of who has proposed to whom.

Amelia&#x27;s dress and mannerisms are frequently the cause of comment and wonder from outsiders. In earlier books in the series it is established that her favorite ruins to explore are pyramids. She usually carries one of her collection of parasols, which she uses as discreet, or not so discreet, weapons (including a sword-parasol). Her other usual accessory is her belt, later partially replaced with a vest with many pockets. It contains: &quot;Pistol and knife, canteen, bottle of brandy, candle and matches in a waterproof box, notebook and pencil, needle and thread, compass, scissors, first-aid kit and a coil of stout cord (useful for tying up captured enemies).&quot; (&quot;He Shall Thunder in the Sky&quot;, Chapter 2)

Though she carries a small pistol, she is a terrible shot and rarely makes an effort to improve her skill, laughing off Emerson&#x27;s suggestions that she could do more harm than good. Unfortunately, on more than one occasion she has come close to harming a member of the family while wielding the pistol, rarely blaming herself for the near miss (e.g. her shooting at Ramses and an assailant in &quot;The Ape Who Guards the Balance&quot;). Because her family is frequently involved in stopping criminal activity, and she has successfully deduced facts of numerous cases, she views herself as an expert in such matters, to the point of denigrating truly competent law enforcement officers. And because some of the plots they have uncovered were in fact complex, she tends to make all solutions, even those not involving crime, complex and even outlandish while missing the obvious. Joined with her stubbornness, this tendency to over-analyze a problem frequently leads to her holding an incorrect belief far longer than is safe for her or her family.

Another feature of the novels is the egalitarian theme, with Amelia and her family being very close to the family of their original Egyptian &quot;reis&quot; (foreman) Abdullah, to the extent that there is a marriage between Amelia&#x27;s English niece and Abdullah&#x27;s Coptic Christian grandson. Reflecting contemporary attitudes, this pairing is initially met with resistance from all - including Amelia, much to her own surprise — because of David&#x27;s origins and nationality. The marriage can only proceed after she has a change of heart and is able to convince others that the young couple&#x27;s affection should take precedence over notions of race. Following Abdullah&#x27;s death, Amelia begins to see him in dreams, where he gives her warnings and advice, further illustrating how close they were.

Amelia is a proponent of equality between the sexes, and brings up her adopted daughter, Nefret Emerson, accordingly. This does not prevent her from routinely criticizing Nefret or other young women for acting as rashly as she herself regularly does. Her name among the Egyptians is &quot;Sitt Hakim&quot;, or Lady Doctor. This was given her when, soon after her initial arrival in Egypt, she showed such care for the Egyptians she encountered, particularly in treating a number of eye diseases—such as ophthalmia—that were common at the time. Her love for Egypt and its people is as deep and often reveals itself in her distaste for Europeans that view Egyptians with either condescension or disgust.

Perhaps her greatest personal conflict is her long-term love-hate relationship with Sethos. From the first encounter with him as the “Master Criminal”, she has seen him behind many of the plots they encounter; even when it is clear to everyone else that he is not involved. Yet she is strangely drawn to him and feels that there is something about him that fills her with emotions that are otherwise restricted to Emerson. She becomes convinced that she alone has brought about his reformation, even though it is a number of years after that “reformation” that Sethos is actually rehabilitated.

While certainly being far more open minded than many Victorians, she is still a product of her age. Her conviction of British superiority in most everything is third, only behind her own self-confidence and her belief that Emerson is the “greatest Egyptologist of this or any age.”

== Amelia&#x27;s age ==
Amelia&#x27;s age is initially given as 32 in &quot;Crocodile on the Sandbank&quot;, set in 1884. In a 1994 article, Elizabeth Peters discussed the obstacle this presented:

&quot;If I had intended &quot;Crocodile&quot; to be the first in a series, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have been as specific about dates. Not only did Amelia inform the reader of her age (curse her!), but historical events mentioned in the book tied it to a particular year. As the series continued, there was no way I could get around this, or fudge the date of Ramses&#x27; birth, or keep him and his parents from aging a year every twelve months.&quot;

According to this timeline, Amelia would be seventy years old in the eighteenth book, &quot;Tomb of the Golden Bird&quot;, set in 1922–23. In &quot;The Hippopotamus Pool&quot;, however, the Introduction contains what is supposed to be an excerpt from &quot;&quot;The National Autobiographical Dictionary&quot; (45th edition)&quot;, in which Amelia herself states that she was her late twenties at the time of her first visit to Egypt. The statement is footnoted, and the footnote provides specific instructions not to question the discrepancy (pp. xii and xvi.).

In &quot;Seeing a Large Cat&quot;, Emerson&#x27;s age at the time they married is given as 29, making him three years younger than his wife.

The latest chronological mention of Amelia is in the compendium &quot;Amelia Peabody&#x27;s Egypt: A Compendium&quot;, which mentions her taking a souvenir from her visit to Egypt in 1939, as war is looming and she was uncertain that she would ever return. Her age is given as 87, which would be correct according to the original timeline.

== Pronunciation ==
In an interview with Diane Rehm, Peters discussed the correct pronunciation of &quot;Peabody&quot;, which she had intended to be pronounced &quot;PEA-buh-dee&quot; (piːbʌdi) in the style of upper class English and New England society, not &quot;pea-BOD-i&quot; (piːbaːdiː). By contrast, in the audio versions of the books—including those recorded by voice actress Barbara Rosenblat, whom Peters has praised for her accurate pronunciation—Amelia&#x27;s surname is pronounced &quot;pea-BOD-i&quot;.

The difference in nationality between the Emersons and their creator is sometimes revealed through the use of American terms like &quot;railroad&quot;, spelling differences, etc.

<doc id="386568" wikidata="Q596874" url="?curid=386568" title="Misery (novel)">
<text>Misery is an American psychological horror novel written by Stephen King and first published by Viking Press on June 8, 1987. The novel&#x27;s narrative is based on the relationship of its two main characters – the romance novelist Paul Sheldon and his deranged self-proclaimed number one fan Annie Wilkes. When Paul is seriously injured following a car accident, former nurse Annie brings him to her home, where Paul receives treatment and doses of pain medication. Paul realizes that he is a prisoner and is forced to indulge his captor&#x27;s whims.

The novel&#x27;s title has two meanings: it is the name carried by the central heroine of Paul&#x27;s book series, and King described such a state of emotion during the novel&#x27;s writing. He has stated that Annie is a stand-in for cocaine. King has outlined the creation of &quot;Misery&quot; in his memoirs, and mentioned that the image of Annie Wilkes came to him in a dream. King planned the book to be released under the pseudonym Richard Bachman, but his identity was discovered before the book&#x27;s release.

&quot;Misery&quot; won the first Bram Stoker Award for Best Novel in 1987 and was nominated for the 1988 World Fantasy Award for Best Novel. Critical reception of &quot;Misery&quot; was positive – reviewers praised King for avoiding the fantasy elements of his past works, and noted the novel&#x27;s parallels with King&#x27;s personal life and the study of the relationship between celebrities and their fans. The novel, which took fourth place in the 1987 bestseller list, was adapted into an Academy Award-winning film directed by Rob Reiner, in 1990, and into a theatrical production starring Laurie Metcalf and Bruce Willis in 2015.

==Plot==
Paul Sheldon is the author of the best-selling series of Victorian-era romance novels featuring the character Misery Chastain, which he privately disdains, and only endures for the sake of his daughter. In a Colorado hotel, he finishes the final installment, &quot;Misery&#x27;s Child&quot;, in which Misery is killed off. After completing the manuscript for his new crime novel, &quot;Fast Cars&quot;, which he hopes will receive serious literary acclaim and kickstart his post-&quot;Misery&quot; career, Paul gets drunk and impulsively drives towards Los Angeles instead of flying back home to New York City. He is caught in a snowstorm and crashes his car near the small, remote town of Sidewinder, Colorado.

Paul awakens to find that he has been rescued by Annie Wilkes, a local former nurse who is a devoted fan of the &quot;Misery&quot; series. She keeps Paul in her guest bedroom, refuses to take him to the hospital despite his broken legs, and nurses him herself using her illicit stash of codeine-based painkillers. Paul quickly becomes addicted to a medication named Novril, which Annie withholds in order to threaten and manipulate him. She begins reading the recently published &quot;Misery&#x27;s Child&quot; and coerces permission to read the &quot;Fast Cars&quot; manuscript, but disapproves of the darker subject matter and profanity. Paul assesses that Annie is mentally unstable: she is prone to trailing off into catatonic episodes and has sudden, unpredictable bouts of rage. When she learns of Misery&#x27;s death, she leaves Paul alone in her house for over two days, depriving him of food, water, and painkillers. During this time, Paul examines his legs and sees that they have been pulverized and deformed in the crash. 

Upon Annie&#x27;s return, she forces a weakened Paul to burn the &quot;Fast Cars&quot; manuscript in exchange for his painkillers. She sets up an office for Paul – consisting of an antique Royal typewriter with a non-functional N-key, writing paper and a wheelchair – for the purpose of writing a new &quot;Misery&quot; novel that will bring the character back from the dead. Biding his time and likening himself to Scheherezade, Paul begins a new book, &quot;Misery&#x27;s Return&quot;, and allows Annie to read the work in progress and fill in the missing N&#x27;s. As Paul writes, the text includes excerpts of &quot;Misery&#x27;s Return&quot;, a macabre story in which it is found that Misery was buried alive while comatose.

Paul manages to escape his room using his wheelchair on several occasions, searching for more painkillers and exploring the house. He discovers a scrapbook full of newspaper clippings about deaths that reveal Annie to be a serial killer; her victims include a neighboring family, her own father, her roommate, and, while she worked as a head nurse, many elderly or critically injured patients and eleven infants, the last resulting in her standing trial but being acquitted in Denver. When Annie discovers that Paul has been leaving his room, she punishes him by cutting off his foot with an axe and cauterizing his ankle with a blowtorch, &quot;hobbling&quot; him.

Months later, Paul remains Annie&#x27;s captive. After he complains that more typewriter keys have broken and refuses to tell Annie how the novel ends before he has written it, she cuts off his thumb with an electric knife. A state trooper arrives at the house in search of Paul, and Annie murders him by running him over with her riding lawnmower. She hides the remains, but the trooper&#x27;s disappearance draws attention from law enforcement and the media. Annie relocates Paul to the basement. It becomes clear that she does not intend to let him live. After &quot;Misery&#x27;s Return&quot; is finished, Paul lights a decoy copy of the manuscript on fire, which Annie attempts to save. Paul throws the typewriter at Annie and engages her in a violent fight; he manages to escape the bedroom and lock Annie inside. Paul then hides and alerts the police when they return in search of the murdered trooper. Annie is found dead from her injuries in the barn — she apparently escaped through a window and was on her way to murder Paul with a chainsaw.

After Paul has returned to New York, &quot;Misery&#x27;s Return&quot; is set to be published and becomes an international bestseller due to the interest in the circumstances under which it was written. Paul resists the suggestion to write a nonfiction account of his own experiences, partly in the belief that he would inevitably embellish events, and partly due to his refusal to acknowledge Annie is his work. He is able to walk with a prosthesis but still struggles with nightmares about Annie coming after him for revenge, withdrawal from painkillers, alcoholism and writer&#x27;s block. When Paul finds random inspiration to write a new story, he weeps, both out of mourning for his shattered life and in the joy that he is finally able to write again.

==Background==
One of Stephen King&#x27;s inspirations for &quot;Misery&quot; was the reaction his fans had to his 1984 novel &quot;The Eyes of the Dragon&quot;. Many fans rejected &quot;The Eyes of the Dragon&quot; because it was an epic fantasy book, with virtually none of the horror that initially made his reputation. Paul Sheldon feeling chained to the &quot;Misery&quot; books by his fans was a metaphor for King&#x27;s feeling chained to horror fiction. Another source was King&#x27;s addiction to drugs and alcohol, and his struggle to get sober. He stated: &quot;Take the psychotic nurse in &quot;Misery&quot;, which I wrote when I was having such a tough time with dope. I knew what I was writing about. There was never any question. Annie was my drug problem, and she was my number-one fan. God, she never wanted to leave.&quot;
When further addressing the idea of whether the character of Paul Sheldon was based on himself, King stated that in certain ways, he was, but in the ways where every character is a part of the author in some way: &quot;It would be fair enough to ask, I suppose, if Paul Sheldon in &quot;Misery&quot; is me. Certain &quot;parts&quot; of him are ... but I think you will find that, if you continue to write fiction, every character you create is partly you.&quot;

King has also attributed a dream he had while on a trans-Atlantic flight to London with the situation and characters that became fleshed out in &quot;Misery&quot;. He noted that he wrote the idea on an American Airlines cocktail napkin when he woke up so he could make sure to remember it, writing: &quot;She speaks earnestly but never quite makes eye contact. A big woman and solid all through; she is an absence of hiatus. &#x27;I wasn&#x27;t trying to be funny in a mean way when I named my pig Misery, no sir. Please don&#x27;t think that. No, I named her in the spirit of fan love, which is the purest love there is. You should be flattered.&#x27;&quot;

King and his wife, Tabitha King, stayed in London&#x27;s Brown&#x27;s Hotel, where he wrote &quot;sixteen pages of a steno notebook&quot;; the concierge let him work at a desk once owned by Rudyard Kipling, who had died of a stroke while using it. King thought that the book would only be around 30,000 words, but it ended up being almost four times that at 370 pages. Its working title was &quot;The Annie Wilkes Edition&quot;. While discussing the pros and cons (mostly cons) of pre-plotting novels, King mentioned that he had originally planned for Annie to force her prisoner to write a book, which she would then bind in Paul&#x27;s skin. When commenting on why he chose not to go that route, King said:
 ... it would have made a pretty good story (not such a good novel, however; no one likes to root for a guy over the course of three hundred pages only to discover that between chapters sixteen and seventeen the pig ate him), but that wasn&#x27;t the way things eventually went. Paul Sheldon turned out to be a good deal more resourceful than I initially thought, and his efforts to play Scheherazade and save his life gave me a chance to say some things about the redemptive power of writing that I had long felt but never articulated. Annie also turned out to be more complex than I&#x27;d first imagined her, and she was great fun to write about ...&quot;

==Adaptations==
===Film===
The novel was adapted into a film in 1990, directed by Rob Reiner and written by William Goldman. James Caan and Kathy Bates starred as Paul Sheldon and Annie Wilkes, with Lauren Bacall, Richard Farnsworth and Frances Sternhagen in supporting roles. The film was a critical and commercial success, and continues to be ranked as one of the best Stephen King adaptations. For her performance as Annie Wilkes, Kathy Bates won the 1991 Academy Award for Best Actress – one of the few Oscar wins for a performance in the horror genre, and the first for any King adaptation – and was launched into mainstream stardom. In June 2003, the American Film Institute included Annie Wilkes, as played by Bates, in their &quot;100 Heroes and Villains&quot; list, ranking her as the 17th most iconic villain (and sixth most iconic villainess) in the history of film.

===Television===
A version of Annie Wilkes, portrayed by Lizzy Caplan, is the main character of the second season of &quot;Castle Rock&quot;. The season finale concludes with Annie attending a book signing for a &quot;Misery&quot; novel by Paul Sheldon.

===Stage===
The novel was also adapted into a play by Simon Moore. The play premiered in London at the Criterion Theater in December 1992, starring Sharon Gless and Bill Paterson and directed by Moore. The play, directed by Alan Cohen, was revived in 2005 at the King&#x27;s Head Theatre in London, starring Michael Praed and Susan Penhaligon. In 2014, Dutch composer and theater producer Florus van Rooijen adapted the novel into a &quot;feel bad&quot; musical.

A different play written by William Goldman (who also wrote the film&#x27;s screenplay) and directed by Will Frears opened on Broadway in 2015 for a limited engagement. The play starred Bruce Willis as Paul Sheldon and Laurie Metcalf as Annie Wilkes. It opened in October 2015 and closed on February 16, 2016. For her performance as Wilkes, Metcalf was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play. The play was originally premiered in 2012 at Bucks County Playhouse before moving to Broadway. This new version is not connected to the earlier adaptation by Simon Moore.

In October 2019, a Finnish play adaptation of &quot;Misery&quot; called &quot;Piina&quot; was performed at the Tampere Theatre in Tampere, Finland. The play was directed by Antti Mikkola and starring Esa Latva-Äijö as Paul Sheldon and Mari Turunen as Annie Wilkes. Also in September of the same year, Kuopio City Theatre in Kuopio, Finland, presented another interpretation under the name &quot;Piina&quot;, directed by Olli-Matti Oinonen and starring Seppo Pääkkönen as Paul Sheldon and Henna Haverinen as Annie Wilkes. In November 2022, Pori Theatre in Pori, Finland presented third interpretation, directed by Tuomo Aitta and starring Vesa Haltsonen as Paul Sheldon and Mirva Tolppanen as Annie Wilkes. An upcoming fourth play of the Seinäjoki City Theatre in Seinäjoki will premiere in February 2025, and it will be directed by Olli-Matti Oinonen (who previously directed the play at the Kuopio Theatre) and starring Satu Silvo as Annie Wilkes and Reidar Palmgren as Paul Sheldon.

===Radio===
Moore&#x27;s stage adaptation was itself adapted for radio and broadcast on the BBC World Service. The program was produced by Dirk Maggs, directed by Marion Nancarrow and starred Nicholas Farrell as Paul Sheldon and Miriam Margolyes as Annie Wilkes. The program was later released on CD by the BBC.

<text>Erhard Milch (30 March 1892 – 25 January 1972) was a German &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; (field marshal) who oversaw the development of the German air force (&quot;Luftwaffe&quot;) as part of the re-armament of Nazi Germany (1933-1945) following World War I (1914-1918). He served as State Secretary in the Reich Ministry of Aviation from May 1933 until June 1944 and as Inspector General of the air force from February 1939 to January 1945. During most of World War II he was in charge of German aircraft production and supply. In the Milch Trial of 1947, a U.S. military court convicted Milch of war crimes and of crimes against humanity, sentencing him to life imprisonment. However, in 1951 John J. McCloy, the U. S. High Commissioner for Germany, commuted Milch&#x27;s sentence to 15 years. Paroled in 1954, Milch died in 1972.

==Ancestry and Jewish heritage==
Milch was born in Wilhelmshaven, the son of Anton Milch, a pharmacist who had converted from Judaism who served in the Imperial German Navy, and Clara, née Vetter. The Gestapo later investigated Milch due to his Jewish heritage. Under the Nuremberg Laws, Milch would have been categorized as mixed race (&quot;mischling&quot;). However, he would not have been considered Jewish according to that religion&#x27;s orthodoxy (or &quot;halakha&quot;), which states that a person’s Jewish status is passed down through the mother.

In 1935, rumours began to circulate that Milch&#x27;s father was a Jew. The Gestapo began an investigation which was halted by Hermann Göring, the commander-in-chief of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, who produced an affidavit by Milch&#x27;s mother that his true father was her uncle, Karl Brauer. Milch was then issued with a German Blood Certificate. If true, that would mean that Milch&#x27;s mother, Clara, committed not only adultery but also incest. 

Author and Holocaust denier David Irving claimed in his book &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Luftwaffe: The Life of Field Marshal Erhard Milch&quot;, that Milch asked him not to reveal the truth about his parentage, so although Irving states that Erhard&#x27;s father was not Anton Milch and concentrates on his wealthy great-uncle Karl Brauer (who died in 1906), he does not actually name Brauer as his father. However, Irving, who claimed to have had access to the Field Marshal&#x27;s private diary and papers, says the rumours about Milch&#x27;s parentage began to spread in the autumn of 1933, and that Erhard Milch personally obtained a signed statement by his putative father Anton that he was not the father of Clara&#x27;s children. Furthermore, Irving claimed that Clara Milch had already written to her son-in-law Fritz Herrmann in March 1933 explaining the circumstances of her marriage, and that Göring had initiated his own investigation that identified his real father. During the Nuremberg trials 1946, Milch was again questioned about his alleged Jewish father and Göring&#x27;s role in the matter by Chief United States Prosecutor, Robert H. Jackson.

==World War I and interwar career==
Milch enlisted in the Imperial German Army in 1910, where he rose to the rank of &quot;Leutnant&quot; and commanded an artillery unit in East Prussia at the beginning of the First World War. He saw action against the Russian Army on the River Deime in September 1914 and later on the Angerapp Line in February 1915. In July 1915, he was transferred to the &quot;Fliegertruppe&quot; (Imperial Air Force) and trained as an aerial observer on the Western front, seeing action on the Somme in 1916 (through the period of it becoming the &quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot; in October that year) and later in Flanders during 1917. After a spell as a company commander in the trenches in the spring and summer of 1918, in the waning days of the war, he was promoted to &quot;Hauptmann&quot; and appointed to command a fighter wing, &quot;Jagdgruppe 6&quot;, even though he had never trained as a pilot and could not fly himself.

Milch resigned from the military in 1920 to pursue a career in civil aviation. With squadron colleague Gotthard Sachsenberg, Milch formed a small airline in Danzig under the banner of Lloyd Luftdienst, Norddeutscher Lloyd″s union of regional German airlines. The airline linked Danzig to the Baltic States. In 1923, Milch became the managing director of its successor company. From there, Milch and Sachsenberg went to work for rival Junkers Luftverkehr, where Milch was appointed a managing director in 1925. In 1926, Milch was named a managing director (one of three) of the newly-formed airline Deutsche Luft Hansa. Milch joined the Nazi Party (number 123,885) on 1 April 1929, but his membership was not officially acknowledged until March 1933, because Hitler deemed it desirable to keep the fact hidden for political reasons.
On 5 May 1933, Milch took up a position as State Secretary of the newly formed Reich Ministry of Aviation (RLM), answering directly to Hermann Göring. In this capacity, he was instrumental in establishing the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, the air force of Nazi Germany. Milch quickly used his position to settle personal scores with other aviation industry personalities, including Hugo Junkers and Willy Messerschmitt. Specifically, Milch banned Messerschmitt from submitting a design in the competition for a new fighter aircraft for the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. Messerschmitt outmanoeuvred Milch, circumventing the ban and successfully submitting a design. The Messerschmitt-designed &quot;Bayerische Flugzeugwerke&quot; corporate entry, the Bf 109, proved to be the winner. Messerschmitt maintained its leading position within the German aircraft industry until the failure of the Me 210 aircraft. Even after that Milch, as the leader, did not depose him, but put him in an inferior position.

In 1935 doubts about the ethnic origin of Erhard Milch began when rumors circulated that his father Anton Milch was Jewish. The Gestapo began an investigation but it was stopped by Göring; Erhard&#x27;s mother had signed a document that Anton was not the true father of Erhard and his brothers but that it was her uncle Karl Brauer. Those events and the later extension of the &quot;Certificate of German Blood&quot; were the background to Göring&#x27;s statement, &quot;I decide who is a Jew in the air force&quot;. However, many believe that he was merely quoting Karl Lueger, the former mayor of Vienna. 

== World War II ==

In a reorganization of 1 February 1939, Milch, now with the rank of &quot;Generaloberst&quot;, was given the additional job of Inspector-General of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. After the outbreak of World War II, Milch commanded &quot;Luftflotte 5&quot; during Operation Weserübung in Norway. Following the defeat of France, Milch was promoted to &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; (field marshal) during the 1940 Field Marshal Ceremony. Following the suicide of &quot;Generaloberst&quot; Ernst Udet in November 1941, Milch succeeded him as &quot;Generalluftzeugmeister&quot;, in charge of all &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; aircraft production, armament and supply. In April 1942 he was named to the Central Planning Board along with Albert Speer, Reich Minister of Armaments and War Production, and Paul Körner, State Secretary of the Four Year Plan, in an effort to coordinate control over all industrial war production. 

Milch cancelled production of the ineffective and dangerous Me 210 and He 177 and put them back in development. Under his direction, aircraft production focused on mass production of the tested and tried models. Output doubled in the summer of 1943 in comparison with the winter of 1941–1942. Adam Tooze wrote &quot;For the first time, the German aircraft industry was able to achieve substantial economies of scale. The resources pumped into the Luftwaffe in 1940–41 were now concentrated in mass assembly&quot;. To achieve this level of mass production, the Armaments Ministries and the industry cooperated with the SS to procure labour from concentration camps. Due to Milch&#x27;s connections with the SS, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; had an advantage in obtaining slave labour. To increase the quantity, Milch also made some sacrifices in quality, notable in the case of the Bf 109. When the US Air Force began to directly challenge the fighter forces of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, the cost of Milch&#x27;s decisions was shown. The handling of the Bf 109 G was so bad that they became, in the words of Tooze, &quot;little more than death traps&quot;.
On 10 August 1943, Milch finally addressed Germany&#x27;s lack of a truly &quot;four-engined&quot; heavy bomber to carry out raids against Great Britain. He endorsed Arado Flugzeugwerke to be the subcontractor for the Heinkel He 177B separately engined heavy bomber design. Only three flyable prototypes were completed by early 1944. From March 1944, Milch, together with Speer, oversaw the activities of the &quot;Jägerstab&quot; (&quot;Fighter Staff&quot;), a governmental task force whose aim was to increase the production of fighter aircraft, in part by moving the production facilities underground. In cooperation with the SS, the task force played a key role in the exploitation of slave labour for the benefit of the German aircraft industry and the Luftwaffe.

When the agitation among the legions of foreign workers in his factories threatened production, Milch was able to refer to his association with Himmler

I spoke to Himmler recently about this, and told him his main task must be to see to the protection of German industry if unrest breaks out among this foreign scum. 

If, for instance, there is a mutiny at X, an officer with a couple of men, or a lieutenant with thirty troops, must appear in the factory and let fly with their machine-guns into the mob. The object is to lay out as many people as possible, if mutinies break out. This is the order I have issued, even if the people are our own foreign workers. 

Every tenth man is to be picked out, and every tenth man will be shot in front of the rest.

In 1944 Milch sided with Joseph Goebbels, the propaganda minister and Heinrich Himmler, the &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot;, in attempting to convince Adolf Hitler to remove Göring from command of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. When Hitler refused, Göring retaliated by forcing Milch out of his positions as State Secretary and &quot;Generalluftzeugmeister&quot; on 20 June 1944, and as &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; Inspector General in January 1945. From August 1944, he worked under Speer in the &quot;Rüstungsstab&quot; (Armaments Staff) but was sidelined and achieved little. He was injured in a car accident in the fall of 1944 and hospitalized for several weeks. Finally placed into the &quot;Führerreserve&quot; in March 1945, he was not reassigned.

===Capture and assault===
Milch was apprehended by the British No. 6 Commando on the Baltic coast on 4 May 1945. He was taken to the unit&#x27;s command post of Brigadier Derek Mills-Roberts in Neustadt in Holstein, a man who was known to have a short temper. When Milch arrived, Mills-Roberts was said to be still seething from the suffering and atrocities he had seen during the liberation of Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. Milch reportedly addressed Mills-Roberts in a haughty manner, demanding good treatment, waving his &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot;&#x27;s campaign baton around, and dismissing concerns about the inmates of several satellite &quot;Arbeitslager&quot; of Neuengamme concentration camp in the area.

Mills-Roberts became so incensed with Milch&#x27;s tone, the British officer snatched the field-marshal&#x27;s baton from him and began beating Milch over the head with it until it broke. He then grabbed a champagne bottle and continued, fracturing Milch&#x27;s skull. The bloodied field-marshal was then pulled up from the floor and driven back to Sierhagen Castle where he had been staying, and robbed at gunpoint by British soldiers (which included his ceremonial jewel-encrusted Generalfeldmarschall baton). He was then sent to a holding camp for Nazi prisoners at Lüneburg near the field HQ of British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery.

A few days later Mills-Roberts went to the British HQ. On entering Monty&#x27;s tent, the British Field Marshal is said to have covered his head with his hands, quipping &quot;I hear you&#x27;ve got a thing about Field Marshals&quot;. Mills-Roberts apologised for his actions but no further action was taken against the Commando Brigadier.

==Trial and conviction at Nuremberg==

Milch was tried as a war criminal in 1947 by a United States Military Tribunal in Nuremberg. He was convicted on two counts:
# War crimes, by participating in the ill treatment and use of the forced labour of prisoners of war (POWs) and the deportation of civilians to the same ends.
# Crimes against humanity, by participating in the murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, imprisonment, torture, and the use of slave labour of civilians who came under German control, German nationals and prisoners of war.

Milch was sentenced to life imprisonment. Unlike the vast majority of other Nazi war criminals who were tried under U.S. military law, Milch was not immediately sent to Landsberg Prison to serve his sentence. He was instead sent to Rebdorf Prison, near Munich, but was eventually transferred to Landsberg. Milch&#x27;s sentence was commuted to 15 years imprisonment in 1951, and he was paroled in June 1954. He lived out the remainder of his life in Düsseldorf, where he died in 1972 as the last living &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; field marshal.

==Popular culture==

In the 1969 film &quot;Battle of Britain&quot;, Milch was portrayed by German actor Dietrich Frauboes.

American actor Robert Vaughn portrayed Milch in the 1982 television film, &quot;Inside the Third Reich&quot;.

<text>Whiteleaf is a hamlet in the civil parish of Princes Risborough and the ecclesiastical parish of Monks Risborough in Buckinghamshire, England. It is located 7 miles south of the county town of Aylesbury and 8 miles north of High Wycombe. It lies halfway up the northern scarp of the Chilterns, about half a mile from the parish church of Monks Risborough.

The hamlet&#x27;s name is first found in the form White Cliff in the eighteenth century, referring to the white chalk cliff above the road to the east of the hamlet, which has the Whiteleaf Cross cut into the chalk on the side of Whiteleaf Hill above it, making an important landmark for miles around. In addition to the cross, there is a neolithic barrow on Whiteleaf Hill.

Whiteleaf is home to Monks Risborough Cricket Club and the 9-hole Whiteleaf Golf Club, both of which lie slightly south-east of the main road through the village, which follows the path of the Upper Icknield Way. The cricket ground has a significant slope and was tried by the BBC to see if it would be suitable for filming the cricket scene in the production of A. G. Macdonnell&#x27;s &quot;England, Their England&quot;. However, it was not found to be sloping enough. The cricket club celebrated its centenary in 1993 and a book covering its history was published. The cricket club pavilion was largely destroyed by fire in 2010.

The village also has a public house, the Red Lion.

Children&#x27;s writer Kevin Crossley-Holland grew up in Crosskeys, Westfields (a cottage now called Woodside). His father was the composer Peter Crossley-Holland.

<text>Kentish Town is an interchange station located in Kentish Town in the London Borough of Camden for London Underground and National Rail services.

It is at the junction of Kentish Town Road (A400) and Leighton Road. It is in Travelcard Zone 2. The station is served by the High Barnet branch of the London Underground Northern line, and by Thameslink trains on the National Rail Midland Main Line. It is the only station on the High Barnet branch with a direct interchange with a National Rail line; furthermore an Out of Station Interchange (OSI) with on the North London line is not charged as two separate journeys in electronic journey charging.

==History==

The first station was opened by the Midland Railway on 1 October 1868 on the extension to its new London terminal at . Prior to that, Midland Railway trains used the London and North Western Railway lines to or the Great Northern Railway lines to King&#x27;s Cross. Until the St. Pancras extension was complete, and for some time afterwards, some trains exchanged the locomotive at Kentish Town for one fitted with condensing apparatus and continued to Moorgate station, then named Moorgate Street station. For some years trains ran from Kentish Town to Victoria station on the South Eastern and Chatham Railway.
The second largest motive power depot and repair facility on the Midland Rail was north of the station. In 1861 a collision occurred at a siding near the station in which 16 people were killed and 317 were injured.

From May 1878 to September 1880 the MR Super Outer Circle service ran through the station, from St. Pancras to Earl&#x27;s Court Underground station via and .
The main line station was rebuilt in 1983, nothing of the original station building remains. The separate London Underground station was opened on 22 June 1907 by the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway (CCE&amp;HR), a precursor of the Northern line. The station was designed by Leslie Green with the ox-blood red glazed terracotta façade and the semi-circular windows at first floor level common to most of the original stations on the CCE&amp;HR and its two associated railways, the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway and Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway which opened the previous year. When Kentish Town station opened the next CCE&amp;HR station south was South Kentish Town but that station closed in 1924 due to low usage. station on the North London line opened in 1860 as &quot;Kentish Town&quot; but was given its present name in 1867 when the North London Railway opened .
It was the junction of services to Barking until 1981 when services were diverted to terminate and start from Gospel Oak. The spur line to Junction Road Junction was then closed, the track was removed and the trackbed has been sold for industrial use.

In April 2023, Transport for London (TfL) announced that the Underground station would be closed for &quot;up to a year&quot; from 26 June 2023 to allow both escalators, custom-designed for the station in 1997, leading to long closures due to unavailability of spare parts following breakdowns, to be replaced by the same up-to-date model as those used on the Elizabeth line. The station was also to be refurbished; extensive repairs were made to the ceiling and floor of the ticket hall, and more ticket barriers were installed. During closure Underground platform roundels were changed from &quot;KENTISH TOWN&quot; to &quot;STATION CLOSED&quot;, and entrances were chained off. The railway station remained open.

The station re-opened on 23 December 2024, six months behind schedule. The new escalators have an expected life of 40 years.

<text>Hannah Lynn Storen Hicks (born June 13, 1962), known professionally as Hannah Storm, is an American television sports journalist, serving as the anchor of ESPN&#x27;s &quot;SportsCenter&quot;. She was also host of the &quot;NBA Countdown&quot; pregame show on ABC as part of the network&#x27;s National Basketball Association (NBA) Sunday game coverage.

==Early life and career==
Storm was born in Oak Park, Illinois, and is the daughter of sports executive Mike Storen, who was a commissioner of the American Basketball Association, general manager of that league&#x27;s Indiana Pacers, Kentucky Colonels and Memphis Sounds franchises, and president of the Atlanta Hawks in the NBA. Her mother, Hannah G. Storen, is a real estate broker. Storm graduated from The Westminster Schools, in Atlanta, Georgia, and in 1983 from the University of Notre Dame.

Storm took her on-air name during her stint as a disc jockey for a hard rock radio station in Corpus Christi, Texas, in the early 1980s. While at Notre Dame, she worked for WNDU-TV, the then-Notre Dame-owned NBC affiliate in South Bend, Indiana. After graduation, she took a job as a disc jockey at KNCN (C-101) in Corpus Christi, Texas. Six months later, she got a job at a Houston rock station KSRR 97 Rock as the drive-time sportscaster and traffic reporter
 Storm stayed in Houston for four years doing a variety of radio and television jobs, including hosting the Houston Rockets halftime and postgame shows and also hosted Houston Astros postgame shows on KTXH television. She worked as a weekend sports anchor on WCNC-TV 36 (formerly WRET) in Charlotte, North Carolina, from 1988 to 1989. She transitioned to CNN from there.

==National career==

===CNN===
Storm&#x27;s national experience began as the first female host on &quot;CNN Sports Tonight&quot; from 1989 to 1992. She also hosted &quot;Major League Baseball Preview&quot; and reported from spring training, the playoffs, and the Daytona 500. In addition, she hosted the 1990 Goodwill Games for TBS.

===NBC Sports===
In May 1992, Storm left CNN and was hired by NBC. She hosted for the Olympic Games, as well as NBA and WNBA basketball, the National Football League, figure skating and Major League Baseball. Storm became the first woman in American television history to act as solo host of a network&#x27;s sports package when she hosted NBC Major League Baseball games from 1994 to 2000 (CBS&#x27; Andrea Joyce preceded her, but co-hosted the sports packages). She then hosted &quot;The NBA on NBC&quot; from 1997 to 2002. Storm also anchored NBC Sports coverage of Wimbledon, French Open, Notre Dame football, World Figure Skating Championships, NBC SportsDesk, Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s U.S. Open (golf) and various college bowl games. Storm was also the first play-by-play announcer for the WNBA in 1997.

===&quot;The Early Show&quot;===
On October 28, 2002, she moved to CBS News and became one of the hosts of &quot;The Early Show&quot;. As co-host of &quot;The Early Show&quot;, she covered major news events, including the Iraq War, Hurricane Katrina, Super Bowls XXXVIII and XLI, the 2004 Democratic National Convention, the 2004 and 2008 presidential elections, and the 2005 London terrorist bombings. Storm has interviewed major newsmakers such as Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, First Lady Laura Bush, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Senators John McCain, Hillary Clinton, as well as many sports and pop culture icons, including Elton John, Paul McCartney, Peyton Manning, Tiger Woods, Jamie Foxx, Halle Berry and Jennifer Aniston.

In addition to her duties on &quot;The Early Show&quot;, Storm hosted shows for the award-winning CBS newsmagazine, &quot;48 Hours&quot;. She also served as co-host of the network&#x27;s &quot;CBS Thanksgiving Day Parade&quot; for five years. In 2007, Storm conceived and wrote a daily blog for CBSNews.com, which featured behind-the-scenes insight and stories of inspirational women.

During an &quot;Early Show&quot; on-air segment, Storm revealed on camera that she had a congenital defect known as port-wine stain under her left eye.

In November 2007, CBS announced that Storm was leaving &quot;The Early Show&quot;. Storm&#x27;s last day as an &quot;Early Show&quot; co-host was December 7, 2007.

=== ESPN/ABC ===
Storm joined ESPN on May 10, 2008. She anchors &quot;SportsCenter&quot; weekdays (except Fridays during the NFL season) from 9 am until noon and on Sunday mornings during the NFL season with Bob Ley. Her duties are to deliver highlights and to question analysts about sports topics.

In August 2009, she added tennis host to her ESPN duties by co-hosting the 2009 U.S. Open with Mike Tirico and Chris Fowler. She also co-hosted the 2010 U.S. Open, 2011 Wimbledon and the 2011 U.S. Open.

In February 2010, fellow ESPN colleague Tony Kornheiser criticized her outfit that day on his radio show, saying that her outfit looked like &quot;a sausage casing&quot;, and was suspended from ESPN for two weeks. He later apologized to her via a 15-minute phone conversation.
Beginning on April 3, 2010, Storm would host &quot;ESPN Sports Saturday&quot;, a show on corporate sibling ABC similar to that network&#x27;s classic sports series, &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot;.

In June 2010, alongside fellow anchor Stuart Scott, Storm provided pregame coverage for the 2010 NBA Finals between the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers. She later became host of the &quot;NBA Countdown&quot; pregame show for the 2010–2011 season, alternating with Stuart Scott, until the 2011–12 NBA season.

When Scott died in 2015, Storm was tasked with announcing the news on &quot;SportsCenter&quot;. She nearly broke down during the segment. On August 10, 2016, she also announced the death of another colleague, John Saunders, while airing live from Olympics coverage in Rio de Janeiro.

=== Amazon Prime ===
In 2018, Storm and Andrea Kremer became the first female duo to call an NFL game, which they did for an Amazon Prime stream of &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot;.

==Personal life==
On January 8, 1994, Storm married sportscaster Dan Hicks. The couple have three daughters together. Storm is Catholic.

Storm was born with a large port-wine stain birthmark under her left eye which she talks about publicly in order to raise awareness about the condition. In 2008 Storm created the Hannah Storm Foundation, which raises awareness and provides treatment for children suffering from debilitating and disfiguring vascular birthmarks. She also sits on the boards of the Tribeca Film Festival, Colgate Women&#x27;s Sports Awards, 21st Century Kids 1st Foundation, and has done extensive work with the March of Dimes, Partnership for a Drug-Free America, Boys and Girls Club, Special Olympics, the Women&#x27;s Sports Foundation, Vascular Birthmark Institute, University of Notre Dame and the Diocese of Bridgeport. Storm also founded &quot;Brainstormin&#x27; Productions&quot; for the creation of educational and inspirational programming. In May 2011, Storm received &quot;Celebrated Mom&quot; award from LifeWorx, Inc., Chappaqua, New York. This award is given to a mother who inspires others, in spite of career and family challenges.

&quot;Notre Dame Inspirations&quot; funds a journalism scholarship in her name at her alma mater.

Storm has also contributed extensively to several magazines, including &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, &quot;Nick Jr.&quot;, &quot;Family Circle&quot;, &quot;Child&quot; and &quot;Notre Dame Magazine&quot;.

===Accidental burning===
On December 11, 2012, Storm sustained second-degree burns to her chest and hands, and first-degree burns to her neck and face resulting from a propane-gas grill accident at her home. Her 15-year-old daughter alerted authorities to the accident. Storm lost her eyebrows, eyelashes and roughly half her hair. After receiving medical care from the Burn Center at Westchester Medical Center in Valhalla, New York, Storm returned to the air January 1, 2013, co-hosting the Rose Parade on ABC while wearing a bandage on her left hand and sporting hair extensions, and returned to &quot;SportsCenter&quot; on January 13, 2013, to host the Sunday-morning edition with Bob Ley.

<doc id="386591" wikidata="Q1573943" url="?curid=386591" title="Neminem captivabimus">
<text>Neminem captivabimus is a legal term in Polish and Lithuanian historical law that was short for &quot;&quot; (Latin, &quot;We shall not arrest anyone without a court verdict&quot;).

In the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, it was one of the szlachta&#x27;s privileges, stating that the king could neither punish nor imprison any member of the &quot;szlachta&quot; without a viable court verdict. Its purpose was to release someone who had been arrested unlawfully. &quot;Neminem captivabimus&quot; had nothing to do with whether the prisoner is guilty but only with whether due process had been observed.

It was introduced by King Władysław Jagiełło in the Acts of Jedlnia (1430) and Kraków (1433) and remained in use until the Partitions of Poland (1772–1795). The same acts guaranteed that he would not confiscate any &quot;szlachta&quot; property without a court verdict.

The Four-Year Sejm (1791) decided that the privilege be granted to inhabitants of royal cities who owned real property there and to the Polish Jews.

<text>Lloydminster is a city in Canada which has the unusual geographic distinction of straddling the provincial border between Alberta and Saskatchewan. The city is incorporated by both provinces as a single city with a single municipal administration.

Located in the heart of Treaty 6, Lloydminster is the traditional homeland of the Plains Cree, Wood Cree, Dene, Saulteaux and homeland of the Métis.

== History ==
Intended to be an exclusively British utopian settlement centred on the idea of sobriety, Lloydminster was founded in 1903 by the Barr Colonists, who came directly from the United Kingdom. At a time when the area was still part of the North-West Territories, the town was located astride the Fourth Meridian of the Dominion Land Survey. This meridian was intended to coincide with the 110° west longitude, although the imperfect surveying methods of the time led to the surveyed meridian being placed a few hundred metres (yards) west of this longitude.

The town was named for George Lloyd, an Anglican priest who would become Bishop of Saskatchewan in 1922. Lloyd was a strong opponent of non-British immigration to Canada. During a nearly disastrous immigration journey, which was badly planned and conducted, he distinguished himself with the colonists and replaced the Barr Colony&#x27;s leader and namesake Isaac Montgomery Barr during the colonists&#x27; journey to the eventual townsite.

The town developed rapidly: by 1904, there was a telegraph office as well as a log church; in 1905, the &quot;Lloydminster Daily Times&quot; started publication and the first train arrived on July 28. Its main north–south street, today named Meridian Avenue (or 50th Avenue), along which stores, businesses and the post office began locating, was situated right on the Fourth Meridian, although the actual road right-of-way was located in Saskatchewan. To comply with temperance principles, alcohol was not available in Lloydminster for the first few years after its founding.

While provincehood of some sort for the prairie territories was seen as inevitable by 1903, it had been widely expected by some, including North-West Territories premier Frederick W. A. G. Haultain, that only one province would eventually be created instead of two. The colonists were not aware of the federal government&#x27;s deep-rooted opposition to the creation of a single province, largely due to the power such a province would hold rivalling the east, nor plans for a provincial boundary along the Fourth Meridian (110° W).

When the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan were created in 1905, the Fourth Meridian was selected as the border, bisecting the town right along its main street. Lloydminster residents petitioned for the new border to be revised so as to encompass the entire town within Saskatchewan, without success. Lloydminster functioned as two towns with separate municipal administrations until the provincial governments agreed in 1930 to amalgamate the towns into a single town under shared jurisdiction. The provinces, again jointly, reincorporated Lloydminster as a city in 1958.

Commemorating Lloydminster&#x27;s distinctive bi-provincial status, a monument consisting of four 100-foot survey markers was erected in 1994 near the city&#x27;s downtown core.

The majority of Lloydminster&#x27;s population lived on the Saskatchewan side until recent decades; in the 2011 Canadian Census, nearly two-thirds of the city&#x27;s population lived on the Alberta side. In 2000, the city hall and municipal offices were moved from Saskatchewan to an Alberta location on Meridian Avenue, also known as 50th Avenue, which runs along the Fourth Meridian.

Despite its bi-provincial status, Lloydminster was not exempted from anti-smoking legislation passed by the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan. Citizens responded by initiating a referendum against the wishes of the mayor, as permitted in the charter, which resulted in the enactment of a citywide anti-smoking bylaw. The matter became moot when Alberta enacted its own anti-smoking legislation, which was the solution that the mayor and council preferred.

== Geography ==

The provincial border runs north to south, falling directly on 50th Avenue (Meridian Avenue) in the centre of Lloydminster. Meridian Avenue north of the Yellowhead Highway (also named 44th Street) remains the main downtown street for stores, offices and businesses, with some also located on the intersecting east–west streets. Addresses east of 50th Avenue are considered to be in Lloydminster, Saskatchewan and addresses west of 50th Avenue are considered to be in Lloydminster, Alberta. The city is bordered by the County of Vermilion River, Alberta, on the west, the Rural Municipality (R.M.) of Britannia No. 502, Saskatchewan, on the northeast and the R.M. of Wilton No. 472, Saskatchewan, on the southeast. The majority of the large retail properties serving the city, including larger stores, gas stations and hotels, are located in its Alberta portion, in particular along the Yellowhead Highway west of Meridian Avenue and along the Alberta side of 50th Avenue south of the Yellowhead Highway.

Lloydminster&#x27;s distinctive situation is reflected in other legal matters, including its time zone. Most of Saskatchewan does not observe daylight saving time, instead staying on Central Standard Time year-round. However, Alberta mandates daylight saving time. Lloydminster&#x27;s charter allows the city to follow Alberta&#x27;s use of daylight saving time on both sides of the provincial border in order to keep all clocks within the city in synchronization. This has the effect of placing Lloydminster and the surrounding area in the Mountain Time Zone along with Alberta. During the summer therefore, the entire city is on UTC−06:00—Mountain Daylight Time, which is the same as the rest of Saskatchewan where the time is defined as Central Standard Time. During the winter, Lloydminster is on Mountain Standard Time with the rest of Alberta, which is UTC−07:00, and is therefore one hour behind the time in the rest of Saskatchewan.

The provincial line divides the city in two aspects related to communications. Telephones on the Saskatchewan side are assigned to area codes 306 and 639, the two area codes assigned to that province, while land lines on the Alberta side have numbers in the 780 and 587 area codes, the two area codes assigned to northern Alberta. Similarly, Saskatchewan addresses have a postal code with a forward sortation area designation (first three characters) of &quot;S9V&quot;, and addresses in Alberta have postal codes beginning with &quot;T9V&quot;. All postal codes in Canada beginning with the letter &quot;S&quot; are assigned to Saskatchewan, and those beginning with &quot;T&quot; belong to Alberta.

=== Climate ===
Lloydminster experiences a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;), which approaches a subarctic climate (Köppen &quot;Dfc&quot;) due to May and September being only marginally above . Winters are long, cold and dry, while summers are short, warm and moderately wet. Year-round precipitation is fairly low, with an average of , whilst the dry winters restrict snowfall to .

The highest temperature ever recorded in Lloydminster was on 12 July 2002. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on 13 January 1911.

== Demographics ==

In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Alberta portion of the City of Lloydminster had a population of 19,739 living in 7,636 of its 8,530 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 19,645. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021. The Saskatchewan portion of Lloydminster had a population of 11,843 living in 4,443 of its 5,002 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 11,765. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016. Overall, the entire City of Lloydminster had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016.

In the 2016 Census of Population, the Alberta portion of the City of Lloydminster had a population of 19,645 living in 7,444 of its 8,444 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2011 population of 18,032. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016. Meanwhile, the Saskatchewan portion of Lloydminster had a population of 11,765 living in 4,392 of its 4,909 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2011 population of 9,772. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016. Overall, the entire City of Lloydminster had a population of 31,410 living in 11,836 of its 13,353 total private dwellings in the 2016 Census of Population, a change of from its 2011 population of 27,804. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016.

The City of Lloydminster&#x27;s 2015 municipal census counted a population of 31,377, a change of −0.3% from its 2013 municipal census population of 31,483. Of the 31,377 residents, 19,740 () lived on the Alberta side and 11,637 () lived on the Saskatchewan side.

There are substantial demographic differences between the populations on each side of the border, with the population on the Saskatchewan side being substantially younger; the median age on the Saskatchewan side is 26.6, nearly seven years less than the median age of 33.2 on the Alberta side. Even when combining the median ages for both sides of the city, Lloydminster has the youngest median age in all of Canada. Also, the specific age group of 20–24 is much more concentrated on the Saskatchewan side. The two sides of the city have virtually identical numbers of people in that age group (1,220 in Saskatchewan, 1,230 in Alberta) even though the total population on the Alberta side is nearly twice that of the Saskatchewan side. This situation has been attributed in part to differential car insurance rates for drivers; because Saskatchewan has a public auto insurance system while Alberta relies on conventional private insurance, young drivers with the highest insurance rates can save thousands of dollars by living in Saskatchewan rather than Alberta.

The census agglomeration of Lloydminster includes both parts of the city, as well as the rural municipality of Wilton No. 472, the town of Lashburn, and the village of Marshall, Saskatchewan.

=== Language ===
About 94% of residents identified English as their first language. More than 1.4% of the population identified French as their first language, while 0.8% identified German, 0.7% identified Ukrainian, and 0.5% identified Cree as their first language learned. The next most common languages were Chinese and Spanish at about 0.3% each.

=== Ethnicity ===
More than 8% of residents identified themselves as aboriginal at the time of the 2006 census.

=== Religion ===
More than 78% of residents identified as Christian at the time of the 2001 census, while over 18% indicated that they had no religious affiliation. For specific denominations Statistics Canada found that 31% of residents identified as Roman Catholic, and 44% Protestants of which, 18% identified with the United Church of Canada, more than 7% identified as Anglican, about 5% identified as Lutheran, almost 3% identified as Pentecostal, about 2% identified as Baptists, and just over 1% of the population identified as Eastern Orthodox.

== Economy ==
The local economy is driven primarily by the petroleum industry. Agriculture remains an important economic activity. The Husky Lloydminster Refinery is also located in the community. An issue in business is the sales tax. The only sales tax applicable in Alberta is the federal Goods and Services Tax (GST). Saskatchewan has, in addition to GST, a provincial sales tax (PST). To ensure that business will not float away from the Saskatchewan side in favour of lower prices in Alberta, PST does not apply in the Saskatchewan side of the city with the exception of hotels, vehicle registration and utility services.
== Government ==
Lloydminster is governed by a seven-member city council, consisting of a mayor and six city councillors. The city follows the Saskatchewan schedule when voting in municipal elections.

Residents on the Alberta side are in the electoral district of Lakeland for elections to the federal House of Commons, and Vermilion-Lloydminster-Wainwright for elections to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta. Residents in Saskatchewan are in Battlefords—Lloydminster federally, and Lloydminster for the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan.

=== Taxation ===
Lloydminster&#x27;s bi-provincial status has resulted in special provisions regarding provincial taxation within the city limits. The Saskatchewan side of the city is exempt from that province&#x27;s sales tax, preventing businesses located there from being placed at a disadvantage relative to businesses in Alberta, which has no provincial sales tax. There is no exemption for provincial income tax, which is based solely on the taxpayer&#x27;s province of residence. Other differences surrounding interprovincial costs are reflected within the treatment of automobile insurance, and housing taxes. For example, a driver under age 25 who lives on the Alberta side will pay approximately 2-3 times the average amount required of a Saskatchewan driver of the same age.

== Infrastructure ==
=== Health care ===
Lloydminster relies on health care resources from both Alberta Health Services and the Saskatchewan Health Authority. The Lloydminster Hospital was constructed in 1987 on the Saskatchewan side of the border.

In 2013, an independent report found that Lloydminster was underserved by health care services in comparison to similar catchment areas in Alberta. In 2007, Lloydminster was deemed to have outgrown the capacity of its hospital; calls for more operating rooms, acute care beds, and a dedicated MRI unit did not come to fruition, resulting in patients sometimes having to travel to larger cities such as Saskatoon for operations. Due to health data privacy laws in both provinces, the Lloydminster Hospital does not have direct access to AHS patient records, which have led to Alberta-based patients sometimes bringing their own paper records or receiving diagnostic tests a second time.

The city&#x27;s contracts with WPD to provide ambulance service in Lloydminster have faced criticism over unsatisfactory performance, with some patients having had to wait up to 40 minutes for help to arrive; in August 2021, AHS pulled out of the contract and signed with a different provider, but WPD invoked an arbitration clause in Saskatchewan law that has prevented the SHA from immediately exiting the contract.

=== Transportation===
The city is served by Lloydminster Airport. The Yellowhead Highway, (Alberta Highway 16 and Saskatchewan Highway 16) passes through the city from west to east, and Highway 17 (which is considered part of both Alberta&#x27;s and Saskatchewan&#x27;s highway system and is maintained by both provinces) travels along the provincial border from south to north. There is no local public transport serving the city.

== Education ==
Elementary and secondary schools on both sides of the border all use Saskatchewan&#x27;s curriculum. Lloydminster provides public and catholic education up to grade 12 as well as post-secondary education through Lakeland College, offering one and two year certificate and diploma programs.

<text>A mesa is an isolated, flat-topped elevation, ridge or hill, which is bounded from all sides by steep escarpments and stands distinctly above a surrounding plain. Mesas characteristically consist of flat-lying soft sedimentary rocks capped by a more resistant layer or layers of harder rock, e.g. shales overlain by sandstones. The resistant layer acts as a caprock that forms the flat summit of a mesa. The caprock can consist of either sedimentary rocks such as sandstone and limestone; dissected lava flows; or a deeply eroded duricrust. Unlike &quot;plateau&quot;, whose usage does not imply horizontal layers of bedrock, e.g. Tibetan Plateau, the term &quot;mesa&quot; applies exclusively to the landforms built of flat-lying strata. Instead, flat-topped plateaus are specifically known as &quot;tablelands&quot;.

== Names, definition and etymology ==
As noted by geologist Kirk Bryan in 1922, mesas &quot;...stand distinctly above the surrounding country, as a table stands above the floor upon which it rests&quot;. It is from this appearance that the term mesa was adopted from the Spanish word &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;table&quot;.

A mesa is similar to, but has a more extensive summit area than a butte. There is no agreed size limit that separates mesas from either buttes or plateaus. For example, the flat-topped mountains which are known as mesas in the Cockburn Range of North Western Australia have areas as large as . In contrast, flat topped hills with areas as small as in the Elbe Sandstone Mountains, Germany, are described as mesas.

Less strictly, a very broad, flat-topped, usually isolated hill or mountain of moderate height bounded on at least one side by a steep cliff or slope and representing an erosion remnant also have been called mesas.

In the English-language geomorphic and geologic literature, other terms for mesa have also been used. For example, in the Roraima region of Venezuela, the traditional name, &quot;tepui&quot;, from the local Pomón language, and the term &quot;table mountains&quot; have been used to describe local flat-topped mountains. Similar landforms in Australia are known as tablehills, table-top hills, tent hills, or jump ups (jump-ups). The German term Tafelberg has also been used in the English scientific literature in the past.

== Formation ==
Mesas form by weathering and erosion of horizontally layered rocks that have been uplifted by tectonic activity. Variations in the ability of different types of rock to resist weathering and erosion cause the weaker types of rocks to be eroded away, leaving the more resistant types of rocks topographically higher than their surroundings. This process is called differential erosion. The most resistant rock types include sandstone, conglomerate, quartzite, basalt, chert, limestone, lava flows and sills. Lava flows and sills, in particular, are very resistant to weathering and erosion, and often form the flat top, or caprock, of a mesa. The less resistant rock layers are mainly made up of shale, a softer rock that weathers and erodes more easily.

The differences in strength of various rock layers are what give mesas their distinctive shape. Less resistant rocks are eroded away on the surface into valleys, where they collect water drainage from the surrounding area, while the more resistant layers are left standing out. A large area of very resistant rock, such as a sill, may shield the layers below it from erosion while the softer rock surrounding it is eroded into valleys, thus forming a caprock.

Differences in rock type also reflect on the sides of a mesa, as instead of smooth slopes, the sides are broken into a staircase pattern called &quot;cliff-and-bench topography&quot;. The more resistant layers form the cliffs, or stairsteps, while the less resistant layers form gentle slopes, or benches, between the cliffs. Cliffs retreat and are eventually cut off from the main cliff, or plateau, by basal sapping. When the cliff edge does not retreat uniformly but instead is indented by headward eroding streams, a section can be cut off from the main cliff, forming a mesa.

Basal sapping occurs as water flowing around the rock layers of the mesa erodes the underlying soft shale layers, either as surface runoff from the mesa top or from groundwater moving through permeable overlying layers, which leads to slumping and flowage of the shale. As the underlying shale erodes away, it can no longer support the overlying cliff layers, which collapse and retreat. When the caprock has caved away to the point where only little remains, it is known as a butte.

== On Mars ==
A transitional zone on Mars, known as fretted terrain, lies between highly cratered highlands and less cratered lowlands. The younger lowland exhibits steep walled mesas and knobs. The mesa and knobs are separated by flat lying lowlands. They are thought to form from ice-facilitated mass wasting processes from ground or atmospheric sources. The mesas and knobs decrease in size with increasing distance from the highland escarpment. The relief of the mesas range from nearly to depending on the distance they are from the escarpment.

<text>London Stone is a historic landmark housed at 111 Cannon Street in the City of London. It is an irregular block of oolitic limestone measuring 53 × 43 × 30 cm (21 × 17 × 12&quot;), the remnant of a once much larger object that had stood for many centuries on the south side of the street.

The name &quot;London Stone&quot; was first recorded around the year 1100. The date and original purpose of the stone are unknown, although it is possibly of Roman origin. There has been interest and speculation about it since the medieval period, but modern claims that it was formerly an object of veneration, or has some occult significance, are unsubstantiated.

==Description==
The present London Stone is only the upper portion of a once much larger object. The surviving portion is a block of oolitic limestone approximately 53 cm wide, 43 cm high, and 30 cm front to back (21 × 17 × 12 inches). A study in the 1960s indicated that the stone is Clipsham limestone, a good-quality stone from Rutland transported to London for building purposes in both the Roman and medieval periods. More recently, Kevin Hayward has suggested that it may be Bath stone, the stone most used for monuments and sculpture in early Roman London and in Saxon times.

The Stone is located on the north side of Cannon Street, opposite Cannon Street station, in an aperture in the wall of 111 Cannon Street (EC4N 5AR), within a Portland stone casing.

==History==
When London Stone was erected and what its original function was are unknown, although there has been much speculation.

The Stone was originally located on the south side of medieval Candlewick Street (afterward widened to create modern Cannon Street), opposite the west end of St Swithin&#x27;s Church. It is shown in this position on the Copperplate map of London, dating to the 1550s, and also appears on the derivative &quot;Woodcut&quot; map of the 1560s. It was described by the London historian John Stow in his &quot;Survey of London&quot; (1598) as &quot;a great stone called London stone&quot;, &quot;pitched upright ... fixed in the ground verie deep, fastened with bars of iron&quot;.

Stow does not give the dimensions of this &quot;great stone&quot;, but a French visitor to London in 1578 had recorded that the stone was three feet high (above ground), two feet wide, and one foot thick (90 × 60 × 30 cm). Thus, although it was a local landmark, the part of it standing above ground was not particularly large.

===Middle Ages===
The earliest reference to the Stone is usually said to be that in a medieval document cited by Stow in 1598. He refers to an early list of properties in London belonging to Christ Church, Canterbury (Canterbury Cathedral), and says that one piece of land was described as lying &quot;neare unto London stone&quot;. In Stow&#x27;s account, the list had been bound into the end of a Gospel Book given to the cathedral by &quot;&quot;Ethelstane&quot; king of the west Saxons&quot;, usually identified as Æthelstan, king of England (924–939). However, it is impossible to confirm Stow&#x27;s account, since the document he saw cannot now be identified with certainty. Nevertheless, the earliest extant list of Canterbury&#x27;s London properties, which has been dated to between 1098 and 1108, does refer to a property given to the cathedral by a man named &quot;Eadwaker æt lundene stane&quot; (&quot;Eadwaker at London Stone&quot;). Although not bound into a Gospel Book (it is now bound into a volume of miscellaneous medieval texts with a Canterbury provenance (MS Cotton Faustina B. ) in the British Library), it could be that it was this, or a similar text, that Stow saw.
Like Eadwaker, other medieval Londoners acquired or adopted the byname &quot;at London Stone&quot; or &quot;of London Stone&quot; because they lived nearby. One of these was &quot;Ailwin of London Stone&quot;, the father of Henry Fitz-Ailwin de Londonestone, the first Mayor of the City of London, who took office some time between 1189–1193, and governed the city until his death in 1212. The Fitz-Ailwin house stood away from Candlewick Street, on the north side of St Swithin&#x27;s church.

London Stone was a well-known landmark in medieval London, and when in 1450 Jack Cade, leader of a rebellion against the corrupt government of Henry VI, entered the city with his men, he struck his sword on London Stone and claimed to be &quot;Lord of this city&quot;. Contemporary accounts give no clue as to Cade&#x27;s motivation, or how his followers or the Londoners would have interpreted his action. There is nothing to suggest he was carrying out a traditional ceremony or custom.


===16th and 17th centuries===
By the time of Queen Elizabeth I London Stone was not merely a landmark, shown and named on maps, but a visitor attraction in its own right. Tourists may have been told variously that it had stood there since before the city existed, or that it had been set up by order of King Lud, legendary rebuilder of London, or that it marked the centre of the city, or that it was &quot;set [up] for the tendering and making of payment by debtors&quot;.

It appears to have been routinely used in this period as a location for the posting and promulgation of a variety of bills, notices, and advertisements. In 1608 it was listed in a poem by Samuel Rowlands as one of the &quot;sights&quot; of London (perhaps the first time the word was used in that sense) shown to &quot;an honest Country foole&quot; on a visit to town.

During the 17th century the stone continued be used as an &quot;address&quot;, to identify a locality. Thus, for example, Thomas Heywood&#x27;s biography of Queen Elizabeth I, &quot;Englands Elizabeth&quot; (1631), was, according to its title page, &quot;printed by Iohn Beale, for Phillip Waterhouse; and are to be sold at his shop at St Pauls Head, neere London stone&quot;; and the &quot;English Short Title Catalogue&quot; lists over 30 books published between 1629 and the 1670s with similar references to London Stone in the imprint.

In 1671 the Worshipful Company of Spectacle Makers broke up a batch of substandard spectacles on London Stone:
Two and twenty dozen [= 264] of English spectacles, all very badd both in the glasse and frames not fitt to be put on sale ... were found badd and deceitful and by judgement of the Court condemned to be broken, defaced and spoyled both glasse and frame the which judgement was executed accordingly in Canning [Cannon] Street on the remayning parte of London Stone where the same were with a hammer broken in all pieces.

The reference to &quot;&quot;the remayning parte&quot; of London Stone&quot; may suggest that it had been damaged and reduced in size, perhaps in the Great Fire of London five years earlier, which had destroyed St Swithin&#x27;s church and the neighbouring buildings; it was later covered with a small stone cupola to protect it.

===18th century to early 20th century===

In 1598 John Stow had commented that &quot;if carts do run against it through negligence, the wheels be broken, and the stone itself unshaken&quot;, and by 1742 it was considered an obstruction to traffic. The remaining part of the Stone was then moved, with its protective cupola, from the south side of the street to the north side, where it was first set beside the door of St Swithin&#x27;s Church, which had been rebuilt by Christopher Wren after its destruction in the Great Fire. It was moved again in 1798 to the east end of the church&#x27;s south wall, and finally in the 1820s set in an alcove in the centre of the wall within a solidly built stone frame set on a plinth, with a circular aperture through which the Stone itself could be seen. In 1869 the London and Middlesex Archaeological Society arranged for the installation of a protective iron grille and an explanatory inscription in Latin and English on the church wall above it.

During the 19th and 20th centuries the London Stone was regularly referred to in popular London histories and guidebooks, and visited by tourists; during his stay in England in the 1850s the American author Nathaniel Hawthorne recorded a visit to London Stone in his journal, noting the indentations on the top &quot;which are said to have been made by Jack Cade’s sword&quot;. In 1937 Arthur Mee, the founder of &quot;The Children&#x27;s Newspaper&quot; and author of &quot;The King&#x27;s England&quot; series of guidebooks, described it as &quot;a fragment of its old self [...] said by some to have been a stone set up in Stone Age days&quot;.

The archaeologist George Byron Gordon was more expansive (and fanciful) in the course of his &quot;Rambles in Old London&quot;, published in 1924. He described London Stone as &quot;the very oldest object in London streets&quot; and &quot;an object of great antiquity when the Romans arrived and their predecessors the ancient Britons found it on their arrival more than two thousand years before. It was erected by the people of the New Stone Age&quot;.

===1940 to present===
In 1940 St Swithin&#x27;s church was burnt out by bombing in the Blitz. However, the outer walls remained standing for many years, with London Stone still in its place in the south wall. In 1962 the remains of the church were demolished, and replaced by an office building, 111 Cannon Street, which originally housed the Bank of China; London Stone was placed without ceremony in a specially constructed Portland stone alcove, glazed and guarded with an iron grille, in the new building. Inside the building it was protected by a glass case. The stone and its surround, including the iron grille, were designated a Grade II* listed structure on 5 June 1972.

In the early 21st century the office building was scheduled for redevelopment, and in October 2011 the then landowners proposed to move the stone to a new location further to the west. Objections were raised by, among others, the Victorian Society and English Heritage, and the proposal was rejected by the City of London Corporation. 

Until February 2016 the ground floor of the building was occupied by a branch of WHSmith newsagents. Inside the shop London Stone in its glass case was hidden behind a magazine rack and not usually accessible. In March 2016, planning permission was granted to allow the building to be demolished and replaced by a new one. The Stone was put on temporary display at the Museum of London while the building works were carried out. It was returned to Cannon Street in October 2018. The new premises publicly display London Stone on a plinth, within a Portland stone casing loosely inspired by its 19th–century predecessor, and behind glass. The plaque adjacent to the Stone reads 

==Interpretations==
===14th century===
The &quot;Short English Metrical Chronicle&quot;, an anonymous history of England in verse composed in about the 1330s, which survives in several variant recensions (including one in the so-called Auchinleck manuscript), includes the statement that &quot;Brut sett Londen ston&quot; – that is to say, that Brutus of Troy, the legendary founder of London, set up London Stone. This claim suggests that interest in the stone&#x27;s origin and significance already existed. However, the story does not seem to have circulated widely elsewhere, and was not repeated in other chronicles.

===16th century===
In 1598 the London historian John Stow admitted that &quot;The cause why this stone was set there, the time when, or other memory hereof, is none&quot;. However, his contemporary William Camden, in his &quot;Britannia&quot; of 1586, concluded that it was a Roman &quot;milliarium&quot;, a central stone from which all distances in Roman Britain were measured, and similar to the Milliarium Aureum of Rome. This identification remains popular, although there is no archaeological evidence to support it.

===18th century===
Alternatively, writers in the 18th century speculated that the Stone was prehistoric and had been an object of Druidic worship. Although this suggestion is now generally dismissed, it was revived in 1914 by Elizabeth Gordon in an unorthodox book on the archaeology of prehistoric London. She envisaged London Stone as an ancient British &quot;index stone&quot; pointing to a great Druidic stone circle, similar to Stonehenge, and claimed it had once stood on the site of St Paul&#x27;s. As noted above, in 1924 American archaeologist George Byron Gordon claimed a &quot;New Stone Age&quot; date for it, but such claims do not find favour with modern archaeologists, since there is no evidence.

===19th century===
By the early 19th century, a number of writers had suggested that London Stone was once regarded as London&#x27;s &quot;Palladium&quot;, a talismanic monument in which, like the original Palladium of Troy, the city&#x27;s safety and wellbeing were embodied. This view seemed to be confirmed when a pseudonymous contributor to the journal &quot;Notes and Queries&quot; in 1862 quoted a supposedly ancient proverb about London Stone to the effect that &quot;So long as the Stone of Brutus is safe, so long shall London flourish&quot;. 

This verse, if it were genuine, would link London Stone to Brutus of Troy, as well as confirming its role as a Palladium. However, the writer in &quot;Notes and Queries&quot; was identified as Richard Williams Morgan, an eccentric Welsh clergyman. In an earlier book, Morgan had claimed that the legendary Brutus was a historical figure; London Stone, he wrote, had been the plinth on which the original Trojan Palladium had stood, and was brought to Britain by Brutus and set up as the altar stone of the Temple of Diana in his new capital city of Trinovantum or &quot;New Troy&quot; (i.e. London). This story, and the verse about the &quot;Stone of Brutus&quot;, can be found nowhere any earlier than in Morgan&#x27;s writings, and both are probably his own invention. Although London Stone had been associated with Brutus in the 14th century, that tradition had never reached print, and there is nothing to indicate that Morgan had encountered it. The spurious verse is still frequently quoted, but there is no evidence that London&#x27;s safety has ever traditionally been linked to that of London Stone.

In 1881 Henry Charles Coote argued that London Stone&#x27;s name and reputation arose simply because it was the last remaining fragment of the house of Henry Fitz-Ailwin of London Stone (), London&#x27;s first Mayor, although London Stone was mentioned about 100 years before Henry&#x27;s time, and the Fitz-Ailwin house was some distance from the stone on the other side of St Swithin&#x27;s church.

In 1890 the folklorist and London historian George Laurence Gomme proposed that London Stone was the city&#x27;s original &quot;fetish stone&quot;, erected when the first prehistoric settlement was founded on the site and treated as sacred ever after. Later, folklorist Lewis Spence combined this theory with Morgan&#x27;s story of the &quot;Stone of Brutus&quot; to speculate about the pre-Roman origins of London in a 1937.

===20th and 21st centuries===

By the 1960s, archaeologists had noted that in its original location London Stone would have been aligned on the centre of a large Roman building, probably an administrative building, now known to have lain in the area of Cannon Street station. This has been tentatively identified as a &quot;praetorium&quot;, even the local &quot;governor&#x27;s palace&quot;. It has further been suggested – originally by the archaeologist Peter Marsden, who excavated there from 1961–1972 – that the Stone may have formed part of its main entrance or gate. This &quot;&quot;praetorium&quot; gate theory&quot;, while impossible to prove, is the prevailing one among modern experts.

London Stone has been identified as a &quot;mark-stone&quot; on several ley lines passing through central London. It has also entered the psychogeographical writings of Iain Sinclair as an essential element in London&#x27;s &quot;sacred geometry&quot;.

There are two recent additions to the mythology surrounding London Stone. The first claims that John Dee – astrologer, occultist and adviser to Queen Elizabeth I – &quot;was fascinated by the supposed powers of the London Stone and lived close to it for a while&quot; and may have chipped pieces off it for alchemical experiments; the second that a legend identifies it as the stone from which King Arthur pulled the sword to reveal that he was rightful king. Both these &quot;legends&quot; seem first to be recorded in 2002. The first may have been inspired by the fictionalised John Dee of Peter Ackroyd&#x27;s 1993 novel &quot;The House of Doctor Dee&quot; (see In literature below).

==In literature==

===15th to 19th centuries===
So familiar was London Stone to Londoners that from an early date it features in London literature and in stories set in London. Thus, in an often reprinted anonymous satirical poem of the early 15th century, &quot;London Lickpenny&quot; (sometimes attributed to John Lydgate), the protagonist, lost and bewildered, passes London Stone during his wanderings through the city streets:
In about 1522 a pamphlet was published by the London printer Wynkyn de Worde. It comprised two anonymous humorous poems, the second of which, &quot;The Maryage ...&quot;, just two pages in length, purports to be an invitation to the forthcoming wedding between London Stone and the &quot;Bosse of Billingsgate&quot;, a water fountain near Billingsgate erected or renovated in the 1420s under the terms of the will of the mayor Richard Whittington. Guests are invited to watch the couple dancing – &quot;It wolde do you good to see them daunce and playe.&quot; The text, however, goes on to suggest that both London Stone and the Bosse were known for their steadfastness and reliability.

London Stone also features in a tract &quot;The Returne of the renowned Caualiero Pasquill of England ...&quot; published in 1589. Otherwise known as &quot;Pasquill and Marforius&quot; it was one of three that were printed under the pseudonym of the Cavaliero Pasquill, and contributed to the Marprelate controversy, a war of words between the Church of England establishment and its critics. At the end of this short work, Pasquill declares his intention of posting a notice on London Stone, inviting all critics of his opponent, the similarly pseudonymous Martin Marprelate, to write out their complaints and stick them up on the Stone. Some writers have argued that this fictional episode proves that London Stone was a traditional place for making official proclamations.

The Jack Cade episode was dramatised in William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry VI, Part 2&quot; (act 4, scene 6), first performed . In Shakespeare&#x27;s elaborated version of the event, Cade strikes London Stone with a staff rather than a sword, then seats himself upon the Stone as if on a throne, to issue decrees and dispense rough justice to a follower who displeases him.

In 1598, London Stone was again brought to the stage, in William Haughton&#x27;s comedy &quot;Englishmen for My Money&quot;, when three foreigners, being led about on stage through the supposedly pitch-black night-time streets of London, blunder into it.

Later, London Stone was to play an important but not always consistent role in the visionary writings of William Blake. Thus in &quot;&quot;, his long illustrated poem on engraved plates begun in 1804, London Stone is a Druidic altar, the site of bloody sacrifices. Alternatively in &quot;Jerusalem&quot; and in &quot;Milton a Poem&quot; it is the geographic centre of Golgonooza, Blake&#x27;s mystical city of London; it is a place where justice is delivered, where Los sits to hear the voice of Jerusalem, and where Reuben sleeps.

===20th and 21st centuries===
Ray Nelson&#x27;s science fiction novel &quot;Blake&#x27;s Progress&quot; (1975), based on the writings of William Blake, featured an alternative history in which Cleopatra won the Battle of Actium and an Alexandrian Empire replaced the Roman Empire. In the alternate London, called Gogonooza, the London Stone is present, standing in front of a Temple of Isis.

In the last years of the 20th century and the early years of the 21st, the Stone has made an increasing number of appearances in novels of imagination and urban fantasy.
* In Peter Ackroyd&#x27;s novel &quot;The House of Doctor Dee&quot; (1993), the character Dr. Dee, vaguely based upon the historical figure of the occultist John Dee, claims that London Stone is the last remnant above ground of a glorious antediluvian and now buried city of London that he is searching for.
* London Stone appears as an embodiment of evil in Charlie Fletcher&#x27;s trilogy for children &quot;Stoneheart&quot; (2006–2008).
* It features in &quot;The Midnight Mayor&quot; (2010), Kate Griffin&#x27;s second Matthew Swift novel about urban magic in London
* It is also part of China Miéville&#x27;s &quot;Kraken&quot; (2010), in which it is the beating heart of London and the sports shop that (at the time Miéville was writing) housed it hides the headquarters of the &quot;Londonmancers&quot; who may know the whereabouts of the kraken stolen from the Natural History Museum.
* The third of a series of fantasy novels for children &quot;The Nowhere Chronicles&quot; by Sarah Pinborough, writing as Sarah Silverwood, is entitled &quot;The London Stone&quot; (2012): &quot;The London Stone has been stolen and the Dark King rules the Nowhere ...&quot;
* In Marie Brennan&#x27;s &quot;Onyx Court&quot; series (2008–2011), the Stone is part of the magical bond between the mortal Prince of the Stone and the fairie court beneath London. 
* The Stone appears in several chapters of Edward Rutherfurd&#x27;s novel, &quot;London&quot; (1997). In the second chapter we see it as the marker stone for all the roads in Roman Londinium, and also sitting beside the wall of the Governor&#x27;s Palace as mentioned above as a hypothesis of its use or origin. It is seen again in the ninth chapter where the main family unit of the novel bring in the character of the foundling who is found propped up against it. It is one of the many central focus points in the novel that the author uses to tie the different time periods together.
* The Stone is a central focus of DC Comics Vertigo storyline called &quot;The Knowledge&quot; (2008), featuring John Constantine&#x27;s sidekick Chas Chandler.
* The Stone also appears many times in the &quot;Dark Fae FBI&quot; series (2017), by C.N. Crawford and Alex Rivers, in which it is the site of many ancient sacrifices and is used to channel memories and power.
* The Stone is mentioned in Nicci French&#x27;s crime novel &quot;Tuesday&#x27;s Gone&quot; (2013).
* The Stone and its surrounding area is mentioned in Jodi Taylor&#x27;s short story &quot;Christmas Pie&quot; (2023).

<text>In the indigenous religion of the ancient Tagalogs, Bathalà/Maykapál was the transcendent Supreme God, the originator and ruler of the universe. He is commonly known and referred to in the modern era as Bathalà, a term or title which, in earlier times, also applied to lesser beings such as personal tutelary spirits, omen birds, comets, and other heavenly bodies which the early Tagalog people believed predicted events. It was after the arrival of the Spanish missionaries in the Philippines in the 16th century that &quot;Bathalà /Maykapál&quot; came to be identified with the Christian God, hence its synonymy with &quot;Diyós&quot;. Over the course of the 19th century, the term Bathala was totally replaced by &quot;Panginoón&quot; (Lord) and &quot;Diyós&quot; (God). It was no longer used until it was popularized again by Filipinos who learned from chronicles that the Tagalogs&#x27; indigenous God was called Bathalà.

==Etymology==
Most scholars believed that Bathalà (Chirino 1595–1602), Badhala (Plasencia 1589), Batala (Loarca 1582), or Bachtala (Boxer Codex 1590) was derived from the Sanskrit word &quot;bhattara&quot; or &quot;bhattaraka&quot; (noble lord) which appeared as the sixteenth-century title &quot;batara&quot; in the southern Philippines and Borneo. In the Indonesian language, &quot;batara&quot; means &quot;god&quot;; its feminine counterpart is &quot;batari&quot;. In Malay, &quot;betara&quot; means &quot;holy&quot;, and was applied to the greater Hindu gods in Java. &quot;Betara&quot; was also assumed by the ruler of Majapahit.

Dr. Pardo de Tavera, a linguist, states that &quot;bhattala&quot; could have come from &quot;avatara&quot;, avatar; that is, the descent of a god on earth in a visible form, such as the ten avatars of Vishnu. According to John Crawfurd, the Malay word &quot;Batara&quot; is derived from avatara both in &quot;sense and orthography&quot;, and is a prefix to connote any deity.

According to Jose Rizal&#x27;s former mentor Rev. Pablo Pastells, S.J., who reprinted in 1900 the early work of his fellow Jesuit, Fr. Pedro Chirino, &quot;Labor Evangelica&quot;, which was first published in 1663 from an anonymous document dated April 20, 1572, the name of Bathala can be ascertained &quot;by resolving the word into its primary elements, &quot;Batà&quot; and &quot;Ala&quot; = &#x27;Son God, or Son of God.&#x27;&quot; This is why the first missionaries did not deprive the natives of this name when they instructed them about the existence of God and the mysteries of the Trinity, the incarnation, and redemption, as states an anonymous but very circumstantial relation written in Manila, on April 20, 1572.

Other possible origins of the term Bathala or Batala are the Malay word &quot;Berhala&quot; (&quot;idol&quot;) and the Arabic expression &quot;‘Allah-ta’ala&quot; (&quot;God, be exalted&quot;), which is the origin of Bathala’s other name &quot;Anatala&quot;.

==Mentions during Spanish colonial era==

The name of the supreme being of the Tagalogs was given as Batala in &quot;Relacion de las Yslas Filipinas&quot; (1582) by Miguel de Loarca, Bathala mei capal in &quot;Relación de las Islas Filipinas&quot; (1595–1602) by Pedro Chirino, Badhala in &quot;Relacion de las Costumbres de Los Tagalos&quot; (1589) by Juan de Plasencia, Bachtala napal nanca calgna salahat (&quot;Bathalà na kumapál at nangangalagà sa lahát&quot; – God the creator and preserver of all things), Mulayri, Molaiari, Molayare, and Dioata in the Boxer Codex (1590), Anatala and Ang Maygawâ in &quot;Carta sobre la idolatria de los naturales de la provincia de Zambales, y de los del pueblo de Santo Tomas y otros circunvecinos&quot; (1686–1688) by Felipe Pardo, O.P., and Bathala mei Capal and Diuata in &quot;The history of Sumatra: containing an account of the government, laws, customs and manners of the native inhabitants, with a description of the natural productions, and a relation of the ancient political state of that island.&quot; (1784) by William Marsden. The true name of this deity, however, is actually unknown, and the ancient Tagalogs usually referred to and addressed him under several titles and epithets.

Jose Rizal, in his letter to his friend Ferdinand Blumentritt (17 April 1890), wrote that the word Bathala was an error of Chirino or some missionary older than or ahead of him who had been copied by subsequent historians, because, according to him, the majority of the historians of the Philippines were mere copyists. He believed that the phrase &quot;Bathalà/Maykapál&quot; that was adopted by other historians after Chirino was nothing more than the phrase &quot;Bahala ang Maykapal&quot; wrongly written; that is, equivalent to Alla or Alah of the Muslims or to the Malayan &quot;Tuan Alla punia Kraja.&quot; This is because &quot;Bahalà ang May Kapál&quot; means &quot;God will take care&quot;, a meaning given also in a dictionary to the phrase&quot; Bathalà May Kapal&quot;. The fact that the phrase &quot;Bathalà May Kapál&quot; was so often encountered made Rizal presume that it may only have been a copy, and that another source where the word Bathala was used without the denomination &quot;May Kapál&quot; could not be found. Rizal believed that the Tagalogs never pronounced the name of their God, just as they did not pronounce the names of their parents, especially before strangers whom they considered their greatest enemies. He believed that they only called him &quot;Maykapál&quot;, a designation still used and understood by most Tagalogs today. He also pointed out that there was no trace at all of the name &quot;Bathalà&quot; among the Tagalogs in the local towns despite the fact that they used words such as &quot;Tikbalang&quot;, &quot;Asuang&quot;, &quot;Anito&quot;, &quot;Nunò&quot;, &quot;Tiyanak&quot;, etc. and retained many pagan usages, traditions, legends, and stories. He believed that the old missionaries did not take much interest in getting to know the religion of the Tagalogs. On account of their religious zeal, the missionaries considered the Tagalogs&#x27; religion unworthy and diabolical, and as a result, they never undertook a thorough investigation of it.

For Isabelo de los Reyes, the name of the Tagalog supreme god was &quot;Maykapal&quot; or &quot;Lumikhâ&quot;, and hence they called their sacred images &quot;likhâ&quot; and not &quot;Badhala&quot;, since the latter was not a specific name, but a common treatment of deities, ominous beings, and other fabulous beings that they feared. Thus, there was &quot;Badhala Maykapal&quot; (Lord Maker), &quot;Badhala Katutubo&quot; (Conborn Lord Anito), and &quot;Badhala Tigmamanok&quot;, or Blue Bird, which actually referred to the &quot;kásay-kásay&quot; (Kingfisher). Their names were &quot;Badhala&quot;, like comets, not because they were gods, but because they were ominous. The word was pronounced &quot;Badhala&quot; and not &quot;Bathalà&quot;, as an enlightened Tagalog elder told de los Reyes, and this was confirmed by Fr. Noceda in his old Dictionario Tagalog (1754). Also, according to Fr. Noceda, the term Bathalà, or &quot;Badhala&quot;, was only used among Tagalogs who had connections with Malay Hindus or Mohammedans, i.e. those from Manila to the South. Moreover, the Tagalogs did not remember the word Bathala, &quot;Batala&quot;, or &quot;Badhala&quot; until it was popularized again by Filipinos when they learned from lightly written chronicles that the indigenous Tagalog God was called Bathalà.

==Other names, titles and epithets==
1. Mulayari (Boxer Codex: &quot;Mulayri&quot; [42r], &quot;Molaiari&quot; [59r], &quot;Molayare&quot; [62r]) – In the transcription and translation of the Boxer Codex (1590) by George Bryan Souza and Jeffrey Scott Turley (2015), the word &quot;May-ari&quot; (&quot;Owner&quot; or &quot;Owner of Property&quot;) is used instead of the original spelling &quot;Mulayri&quot;. The footnote explains: &quot;Q&amp;G, 419, gloss this Tagalog term as &quot;an indirect appellation of God&quot;&quot;. According to the author Jean-Paul G. Potet (Ancient Beliefs and Customs of the Tagalogs, 2018) &quot;Its compounds are &quot;mula&quot; &quot;origin&quot; and &quot;yari&quot; &quot;power&quot;, therefore it means &quot;Source of Power&quot;. The absence of linker between the two components, as in Malay, points at the Bruneian period for the time when it was coined&quot;. The word &quot;yari&quot; also means &quot;made, finished or complete, etc.&quot; Thus, the meaning of Mulayari is also similar to that of &quot;Mulajadi&quot; (&quot;Beginning of Becoming&quot;), which is the name of the creator deity of the Batak people of Indonesia. The Tagalog and Malay word &quot;mula&quot; is derived from Sanskrit &quot;mula&quot;, meaning &quot;root&quot;, while the Malay word &quot;jadi&quot; and its Tagalog equivalent &quot;yari&quot; are descended from the Sanskrit word &quot;jati&quot; (birth), and both words can mean &quot;finished&quot; or &quot;completed&quot; regarding something made or created (becoming/being). Another possible origin of the name &quot;Mulayari&quot; is the Malayalam word &quot;mulayari&quot; which means &quot;bamboo seed&quot;. The name &quot;Mulayari&quot; was not entered by Spanish lexicographers in the old Tagalog dictionaries.

2. Diwatà (&quot;Dioata&quot;, &quot;Diuata&quot;) - Derived from Sanskrit deva and devata, which mean “deity”. Like Mulayari, Spanish lexicographers did not enter this name in early Tagalog dictionaries. In Richard E. Elkin&#x27;s Manobo-English Dictionary (1968), &quot;diwatà&quot; specifically refers to the highest supreme being. In Bla&#x27;an mythology, &quot;Diwatà&quot; is one of the four primordial beings. According to some Bla&#x27;ans, &quot;Diwatà&quot; and &quot;Melu&quot; (the Creator) were brothers, and because &quot;Diwatà&quot; was older than &quot;Melu&quot;, Christian Bible translators chose &quot;Diwatà&quot; to refer to the Christian God. Among the Tagbanwa people, &quot;Diwatà&quot; is another name for the supreme deity &quot;Mangindusa&quot;. In the Kaharingan religion of Borneo, the supreme god &quot;Hatala&quot; (represented as a hornbill &quot;Tingang&quot;) gave his reflection on the primeval waters the name &quot;Jata&quot; (represented as a watersnake &quot;Tambon&quot;). In unity, they were known as &quot;Jatatala&quot; which was considered a male deity as a whole. However, &quot;Jata&quot; represented the Underworld, the Earth, and the feminine aspect of God, while &quot;Hatala&quot; represented the Upperworld, the Sun, and the masculine aspect of God. The name &quot;Jata&quot; is derived from the Sanskrit &quot;deva&quot; and &quot;devata&quot; [Wilken (1912, vol. III)]. &quot;Jata&quot; as a collective designation refers to a category of spirits inhabiting the Underworld. With the ancient Visayans, &quot;diwata&quot; was the equivalent of the Tagalog anito (ancestral spirit). According to Rev. Pablo Pastells, S.J., the interpretation of the word Bathala as &#x27;Son of God&#x27; is confirmed by the Visayan word &quot;Diuata&quot;: &quot;we always find here the same idea signified in the words &quot;Diwa&quot; and &quot;uata&quot; differing only in their transposition... In closing, we may note that &quot;Dewa&quot; in Malay, &quot;Déwa&quot; in Javanese, Sunda, Makasar, and Day[ak?], &quot;Deva&quot; in Maguindanao, and &quot;Djebata&quot; in Bornean, signify &#x27;the supreme God,’ or &#x27;Divinity.&quot; In the Tagalog language, &quot;diwa&quot; means &quot;spirit, thought, idea, central point, sense&quot;. According to Demetrio, Cordero-Fernando, and Nakpil Zialcita, the Tagalogs and Kapampangans of Luzon used the word &quot;anito&quot; instead of the word &quot;diwata&quot;, which was more predominant in the Visayan regions. This indicated that those peoples of Luzon were less influenced by the Hindu and Buddhist beliefs of the Madjapahit empire than the Visayans were. In modern Tagalog, &quot;diwata&quot; means fairy or nymph. It refers particularly to feminine nature spirits of extraordinary beauty, like Maria Makiling.

3. Maykapál (&quot;Meicapal&quot;, &quot;Meycapal&quot;) – &quot;Owner of what has been shaped&quot;. The title or epithet &quot;Maykapal&quot; is derived from the word &quot;kapal&quot;, the basic meaning of which is &quot;to shape earth, clay, or wax into balls&quot;. Its doublet &quot;kipil&quot; expresses the same meaning about food: &quot;to make rice balls and eat them&quot;. This title is related to Bathala&#x27;s other title &quot;Maylupa&quot;, meaning &quot;Owner of the Earth/Land&quot;.

4. Maygawâ (&quot;Meigaua&quot;, &quot;Meygawa&quot;) – &quot;Owner of the Work&quot;.

5. Maylupà (&quot;Meilupa&quot;, &quot;Meylupa&quot;) – “Owner of the Earth/Land&quot;. Under this title, Bathala is symbolically represented by a crow/raven (&quot;uwák&quot;), one of the birds associated with the omen of death. Fr. Francisco Colin (1663) compared &quot;Maylupà&quot; with ancient European deities such as Ceres (an agricultural deity) and Pan (a pastoral deity), which indicates that devotees of Bathala under this title were farmers and herders.

6. Magpalaylay – &quot;the One Fond of Incantations&quot; (‘’laylay’’ meaning “incantation”). The word &quot;laylay&quot; can also mean reverence, hence the term &quot;kalaylayan&quot; (your reverence), which early Tagalog men with children used to address their fathers.

7. Lumikhâ – &quot;Creator&quot;. In the Old Tagalog language, the word &quot;likhâ&quot; also referred to the statuettes of the anitos. In modern Tagalog, including Filipino, it mainly refers to and means &quot;creation&quot;. The word &quot;likhâ&quot; was derived from the Sanskrit word &quot;lekha&quot;, which means &quot;drawing, picture or writing&quot;. In the ancient Tagalogs’ creation myth, the first man and woman sprang forth from a bamboo, which was the most common writing material of pre-Hispanic Filipinos.

8. Anatala – A corruption of the Arabic expression &quot;‘Allah-ta’ala&quot; which means &quot;God, be exalted&quot;. It probably reached Tagalog through Malay or Maranao, where the Arabic expression is read &quot;Alataala&quot;. Because the expression ended in &quot;-a&quot;, Spanish inquisitors thought that it referred to a female deity of the Tagalogs, the superior goddess of all their deities, thus making this name a synonym of Bathala. The name of the Bornean deity &quot;Hatala&quot;, &quot;Mahatala&quot;, or &quot;Lahatala&quot; is also a corruption of the same Arabic expression [Wilken (1912, vol. III)]. However, according to Blumentritt, &quot;Mahatala&quot; or &quot;Mahatara&quot; is the contraction of &quot;Mahabatara&quot;, which means &quot;the Great Lord&quot;. Pedro A. Paterno (1892) also referred to &quot;Anatala&quot; as &quot;Anak-Hala&quot;, which, according to him, means &quot;Son of God&quot;.

9. Nunò (&quot;Nono&quot;) – &quot;Grandparent&quot; or &quot;Ancient One&quot;, similar to &quot;Laon&quot; of the Visayans and &quot;Gugurang&quot; of the Bicolanos. This is the name used to refer to Bathala by the initiates (&quot;antiñgeros&quot;) of Anting-anting, a post-colonial esoteric belief system of the Tagalogs. The &quot;antiñgeros&quot; also refer to &quot;Nuno&quot; as &quot;Infinito Dios&quot; (Infinite God). The term &quot;nunò&quot; was also used by the ancient Tagalogs to refer to the spirits of their ancestors (i.e. &quot;anito&quot;), nature spirits (e.g. &quot;nunò sa punsô&quot;), and the crocodile/cayman/alligator (&quot;buwaya&quot;).

==Tagalismo==
===Ancient Tagalog idea of god===
Excerpts from the Boxer Codex (1590):

The Moors [i.e. the Tagalogs from Manila] of the Philippines have that the world, earth, and sky, and all other things that are in them, were created and made by only one god, whom they calls in their language Bachtala, napal nanca, calgna salahat, which means &quot;God, creator and preserver of all things&quot;, and by another name they call him Mulayri. They said that this god of theirs was in the atmosphere before there was heaven or earth or anything else, that he was &quot;ab eterno&quot; (from eternity) and not made or created by anybody from anything, and that he alone made and created all that we have mentioned simply by his own volition because he wanted to make something so beautiful as the heaven and earth, and that he made and created one man and one woman out of the earth, from whom have come and descended all the men and their generations that are in the world.

these people feared and revered a god, maker of all things, who some call him Bathala, others Molaiari, others Dioata and, although they confess this god as the maker of all things, they do not even know nor do they know when or how he did or what for, and that his dwelling place is in heaven.

Every time the chiefs eat, they put a little of everything they eat or drink in small plates on the table as an offering to the anitos and the Molayare or Batala, creator of all things.

Excerpt from Relacion de las Yslas Filipinas by Miguel de Loarca (1582):

According to the religion formerly observed by these Moros, they worshiped a deity called among them Batala, which properly means &quot;God.&quot; They said that they adored this &quot;Batala&quot; because he was the Lord of all, and had created human beings and villages. They said that this &quot;Batala&quot; had many agents under him, whom he sent to this world to produce, in behalf of men, what is yielded here. These beings were called anitos, and each &quot;anito&quot; had a special office. Some of them were for the fields, and some for those who journey by sea; some for those who went to war, and some for diseases.

Because there were many Bornean people in Manila when the Spaniards first arrived, the Spaniards called the people of Manila Moro, the Spanish name for the Muslims of the Maghreb, Iberian Peninsula, Sicily, and Malta. It was something that the friars who arrived later on repudiated, as the religion of the people of Manila was so different from what they recognized as Islamic that they could not possibly identify it as Islam, all the more so as pigs (often called &quot;unclean animals&quot; by Spanish chroniclers, possibly crypto-Jews) were listed among the chief holocausts to their deities, and, other than the rooster (&quot;manok na kalakyan&quot;), no other animal was listed. There was no feast without at least one pig being killed and roasted. This pig was always a holocaust, and consuming its flesh as a group was certainly regarded as a form of communion with the deity to whom it had been sacrificed. The water buffalo (&quot;anwang&quot;), which is the greatest holocaust among Malays, was never used as such by the Tagalogs. Despite all of this, the Spaniards continued to call the people of Manila Moros for a very long time, as it served as a reason or justification for the Spaniards to seize and enslave them. The English translation of the Boxer Codex (1590) by Souza and Turley renders &quot;&quot;Bachtala, napalnanca, calgna salahat&quot; as &quot;Bathala na may kapangyarihan sa lahat&quot;&quot; which is translated into English as &quot;God who has power over everything&quot;. The exact translation of &quot;God, creator and preserver of all things&quot; in Tagalog is &quot;Bathala na kumapal at nangangalaga sa lahat&quot;.

===Bathala and the Anitos===
The chief deity of the Tagalas is called Bathala mei Capal, and also Diuata; and their principal idolatry consists in adoring those of their ancestors who signalised themselves for courage or abilities; calling them &quot;Humalagar&quot;, i.e. &quot;manes&quot;.
:— William Marsden, &quot;The History of Sumatra&quot; (1784)

&quot;Anitería&quot; (literally meaning worship of anitos) was the term coined by some Spanish chroniclers to denote the Tagalogs&#x27; religion, as they observed that, despite the people&#x27;s belief and respect to the omnipotent Bathala, they also offered sacrifices to ancestral spirits called anitos. Miguel de Loarca (Relacion de las Yslas Filipinas, 1582) asked Tagalogs why holocausts were offered to anitos and not to Bathala. The Tagalogs answered that Bathala was a great lord, and no one could speak to him directly because he lived in heaven (&quot;Kaluwálhatian&quot;), so he sent down the anitos to provide for them.

They placed their ancestors, the invocation of whom was the first thing in all their work and dangers, among these anitos.
:— Francisco Colin, et al. [The Philippine Islands (1493-1898)]

The function of the anitos, therefore, was similar to that of liminal deities in polytheistic religions who serve as intermediaries between mortals and the divine, such as Agni (Hindu) and Janus (Roman) who hold the access to divine realms, hence the reason why they are invoked first and are the first to receive offerings, regardless of the deity that one wants to pray to. The anitos—just like the loa of Haitian Vodou—are not considered gods and goddesses but merely messengers, intermediaries, and advocates (&quot;abogado&quot;) of the people to the Supreme Being. This is similar in concept to Neoplatonism wherein spiritual beings called daimones carry divine things to mortals and mortal things to the Divine: requests and sacrifices from below and commandments and answers from above.

They are the assistants, the ministers of Batala, who sends them on earth to help men. These helpers are called: Anitos. The nature of the Anito is such that he comes on earth, deals with men and speaks in his behalf to Batala.
:— Miguel de Loarca (1582)

Some chroniclers, such as the anonymous author of Boxer Codex, do not call these agents of Bathala &quot;anitos&quot;, but instead have referred to them as &quot;dioses&quot;, rendered in translation by Quirino and Garcia as &quot;gods&quot;. The American-Filipino historian William Henry Scott supports the opinion of these chroniclers (some of whom might be Crypto-Jews) that the ancient Tagalogs worshipped the anitos as gods and goddesses (&quot;aniteria&quot;), arguing that &quot;in actual prayers, they were petitioned directly, not as intermediaries&quot;. Scott cites the example of a farmer&#x27;s prayer to the &quot;anito&quot; named &quot;Lakapati&quot;, where a child would be held over a field, and the farmer would pray: &quot;&quot;Lakapati, pakanin mo yaring alipin mo; huwag mong gutumin&quot; [Lakapati feed this thy slave; let him not hunger]&quot;. However, Scott—who himself was an appointed lay missionary in the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America—may be using the Protestant definition or idea of intercession and worship in contrast to that of the Catholic explorers and missionaries, who described the role of the anitos as an advocate (&quot;abogado&quot;) or intercessor. Most chronicles (and isolated descriptions by explorers and missionaries) present one supreme deity analogous to the Christian God, evoking the impression that the Tagalog religion was monotheistic. Only a few sources include the names of other deities. Also, the missionaries who described the Tagalog religion in the early modern period did emphasize (with only a few exceptions) that the Tagalogs believed in one supreme god as the creator of all things. Their intention was mainly to find an equivalent for the Christian god in order to help them explain Catholic doctrines. Mostly, the titles of their chapters on the Tagalog religion suggest that they intended to portray the religion as a &quot;false religion&quot; or &quot;superstition&quot;, despite their constant wondering whether or not the &quot;new peoples&quot; they claimed to have discovered already had some knowledge of the Gospel.

Although Bathala can only be reached through the agency of the anitos, he is not a distant deity too mighty to be bothered with the concerns of mortal men. The early Tagalogs believed that, on the birth of every child, the god &quot;Bathala&quot; appointed a lesser spirit, whom they also called &quot;Bathala&quot;, as guardian or &quot;Bathala Catotobo&quot; (&quot;Katutubo&quot;), identified by Father Noceda as a guardian angel. The god Bathala also guided people through omens and prophetic dreams. The souls of those who perished by the sword, were devoured by crocodiles, or killed by lightning immediately would ascend to &quot;Kaluwálhatian&quot; (glory) by means of the rainbow (&quot;balangaw&quot;).

===Rituals and ceremonies===
Bathala is the subject of sacred songs such as &quot;Diona&quot; and &quot;Tulingdao&quot;, wherein performers invoke him to prevent flood, drought, and pests and to grant them plentiful harvest and a beautiful field. The people of Indang and Alfonso, Cavite conducted &quot;Sanghiyang&quot; rituals as an offering to Bathala for a bountiful harvest, healing, a recovery from illness, or deliverance from death. The ritual is believed to have started from Naic long before the arrival of the Spaniards and the friars led to the suppression of its observance. This ritual is always done in preparation for other rituals such as &quot;Sayaw sa Apoy&quot; (Fire Dancing), &quot;Basang-Gilagid&quot; (House Blessing), Ancestral Offering, or Mediumistic Healing. It is also performed before searching for a lost item, such as jewelry and other valuables. After it, the &quot;Magsasanghiyang&quot; dialogues with the Superpower through her &quot;Timbangan&quot; (pendulum).

Some believed that the term &quot;Sanghiyang&quot; is coined from two Tagalog words: isa (one), and hiyang (compatible), together meaning &quot;compatible whole&quot; (&quot;nagkakaisang kabuuan&quot;). It is more likely, however, that said ritual is related to the sacred Balinese dance ceremony Sanghyang, which is also the title for a deified spirit and means &quot;The Revered One&quot; or &quot;Holiness&quot;. Hyang, or personified as &quot;Sang Hyang&quot;, (Kawi, Javanese, Sundanese, and Balinese) is an unseen spiritual entity that has supernatural power in ancient Nusantara mythology. This spirit can be either divine or ancestral. In modern Nusantara, this term tends to be associated with gods, which are each known as a &quot;dewata&quot; or God. Currently, the term is widely associated with Indonesian Dharmism which developed in ancient Java and Bali more than a millennium ago. However, the term actually has an older origin: it has its root in indigenous animistic and dynamistic beliefs of the Austronesian people inhabiting the Nusantara archipelago. The &quot;Hyang&quot; concept is indigenously developed in the archipelago and is not considered to have originated from Indian dharmic religions.

===Sacred animals and omens===
The early Tagalogs believed that Bathala revealed his will through omens by sending the bird &quot;tigmamanukin&quot; (&quot;tigmamanuquin&quot;) to which they also attributed the name Bathala. Plasencia (1589), Chirino (1604), and Colin (1663) described this bird as blue in color and as large as a thrush or turtledove. Emma Helen Blair and James Alexander Robertson identified this bird as the Philippine fairy-bluebird (&quot;Irena cyanogastra&quot;). Although the Boxer Codex described it as &quot;reddish blue and black&quot;, Antonio de Morga spoke of the bird as &quot;yellow colored&quot;, which was the color of beauty for the early Tagalogs and had religious significance to them. According to Morga, the bird &quot;tigmamanukin&quot;—as described by Chirino and Colin—could be either inexistent or extinct, since there is no known blue bird of the same size as a thrush; however, there is a similar yellow (though not completely so) bird called &quot;kuliawan&quot; (&quot;golden oriole&quot;). The name Bathala was also attributed to comets and other heavenly bodies which the Tagalog people believed predicted events.

Other animals that were observed for omens include the &quot;balatiti&quot; or &quot;balantikis&quot;, &quot;uwak&quot; (crow/raven), &quot;kuwago&quot; (owl), &quot;bahaw&quot; (mountain owl), &quot;butiki&quot; (lizard), &quot;malimakan&quot; snail, and the &quot;tigmamanok&quot; (white-collared kingfisher, also known as salaksak among the Ilocanos). These birds, crocodiles and lizards were so sacred to the ancient Tagalogs that killing one was considered taboo. When a crocodile died, they anointed it with sesame oil, enshrouded it in a mat and buried it. This is also reported about the &quot;tuko&quot; (gecko), a venomous lizard. San Buenaventura questioned the Tagalogs for tolerating monitor lizards (&quot;bayawak&quot;), saurians fond of eggs and chicken and therefore dangerous to poultry: &quot;Ano’t di ninyo siluin itong bayawak?&quot; (How is it that you haven&#x27;t noosed this monitor lizard?) The while-collared kingfishers (&quot;tigmamanok&quot;) were considered very sacred because they were permitted to pick a crocodile&#x27;s teeth without harm. According to Chirino (1595–1602) and Colin (1663), the ancient Tagalogs held the crocodiles in the greatest veneration, and when they saw one in the water, they cried out in all subjection &quot;Nono&quot; (&quot;Nuno&quot;), meaning &quot;grandfather&quot;. They asked it pleasantly and tenderly not to harm them and, for that purpose, offered it a portion of the fish they carried in their boat by throwing it into the water. Also, the river of Manila (now called Pasig River) once had a large rock (&quot;Buayang Bato&quot;/Stone Crocodile) that served as an idol for many years. The ancient Tagalogs left offerings to it whenever they passed by until the fathers of St. Augustine broke it into small bits and set up a cross in its place. Soon, a small shrine or chapel, with an image of St. Nicolas of Tolentino, was constructed in that location.

===Creation myth===
From &quot;The History of Sumatra&quot; (1784) by William Marsden:

Their notions of the creation of the world, and formation of mankind, had something ridiculously extravagant. They believed that the world at first consisted only of sky and water, and between these two, a glede; which, weary with flying about, and finding no place to rest, set the water at variance with the sky, which, in order to keep it in bounds, and that it should not get uppermost, loaded the water with a number of islands, in which the glede might settle and leave them at peace. Mankind they said, sprang out of a large cane with two joints, that, floating about in the water, was at length thrown by the waves against the feet of the glede, as it stood on shore, which opened it with its bill, and the man came out of one joint, and the woman out of the other. These were soon after married by consent of their god, Bathala Meycapal, which caused the first trembling of the earth; and from thence are descended the different nations of the world. 

From &quot;Philippine Folktales&quot; (1916) by Mabel Cook Cole:

When the world first began there was no land, but only the sea and the sky, and between them was a kite (a bird something like a hawk). One day the bird which had nowhere to light grew tired of flying about, so she stirred up the sea until it threw its waters against the sky. The sky, in order to restrain the sea, showered upon it many islands until it could no longer rise, but ran back and forth. Then the sky ordered the kite to light on one of the islands to build her nest, and to leave the sea and the sky in peace. Now at this time the land breeze and the sea breeze were married, and they had a child which was a bamboo. One day when this bamboo was floating about on the water, it struck the feet of the kite which was on the beach. The bird, angry that anything should strike it, pecked at the bamboo, and out of one section came a man and from the other a woman. Then the earthquake called on all the birds and fish to see what should be done with these two, and it was decided that they should marry. Many children were born to the couple, and from them came all the different races of people. After a while the parents grew very tired of having so many idle and useless children around, and they wished to be rid of them, but they knew of no place to send them to. Time went on and the children became so numerous that the parents enjoyed no peace. One day, in desperation, the father seized a stick and began beating them on all sides. This so frightened the children that they fled in different directions, seeking hidden rooms in the house—some concealed themselves in the walls, some ran outside, while others hid in the fireplace, and several fled to the sea. Now it happened that those who went into the hidden rooms of the house later became the chiefs of the islands; and those who concealed themselves in the walls became slaves. Those who ran outside were free men; and those who hid in the fireplace became negroes; while those who fled to the sea were gone many years, and when their children came back they were the white people. 

These creation myths refer to what is known by theologians as a &quot;second creation&quot;. This conception presupposes a pre-existing matter or substratum out of which the Earth was made. In Philippine mythologies, struggle between two hostile forces is a common theme in the formation of the earth; hence, the existence of the Land Breeze. It is always subsequently followed by the creation or appearance of the first man and woman in contrast to the animals that precede them. According to Andres San Nicolas (1624), the Sambal people, an ethnic group closely related to the Tagalogs, particularly those in Tanay, Rizal, &quot;did not doubt the fact of there having been in its time a creation of man, but they believed that the first one had emerged from a bamboo joint and his wife out of another, under very ridiculous and stupid circumstances.&quot; According to William Marsden (1784), the ancient Tagalogs believed that the first man and woman were produced from a bamboo pole which burst in the island of Sumatra, and they quarreled about their marriage. A paper by Catalina Villaruz, written in about 1920 and now in the H. Otley Beyer manuscript collection, reports that the Southern Luzon Tagalogs believed that the first man started his life inside a bamboo pole. He grew, the bamboo cracked, and out he came. The same story is told of the first woman, and once out of the cane they looked at each other, fell in love, and married. A Tagalog euphemism for a child born out of wedlock is &quot;putok sa buho&quot; (&quot;one who burst out of a bamboo&quot;) – an evident carryover from the times when the myth was held as gospel of truth. According to Nick Joaquin [Alamanac for Manileño (1979)] &quot;The man wooed the woman but the woman was shy, illusive, and stubbornly coy. Becoming impatient, God [i.e. Bathala] started violent earthquake, which flung the woman into the man’s arm. Only thus were they married and the earth populated&quot;.

Francisco Colin identified the &quot;earthquake&quot; in the creation myth as a god. Based on the version of the creation myth provided by William Marsden (1784), the ancient Tagalogs viewed the &quot;earthquake&quot; as a manifestation of &quot;Bathala Maykapal&quot;. However, Pedro Chirino in his writings did not speak of the &quot;earthquake&quot;, nor did he believe that it was considered as God, as, according to the Tagalogs and the Mandayas of Mindanao who informed him, the &quot;earthquake&quot; was nothing more than the effect of the movement of a huge animal in the entrails of the earth. According to some, this animal was an alligator; to others, a boar which scratched his body against the trunk of the earth. This is also the belief of the mountain people of Palawan and Camarines. San Buenaventura (1663:76) threatened his congregation with the &quot;manunungab na buwaya sa impierno&quot; (the devouring crocodile of hell). Some documented curses in old Tagalog include &quot;Kainin ka nang buaya!&quot; (May a crocodile eat you!) and &quot;Lamunin ka nang lindol!&quot; (May the earthquake swallow you up!). The low-frequency vibrations produced by male crocodiles just before bellowing, which could vibrate the ground and result in water appearing to &quot;dance&quot;, is more likely where the ancient Tagalogs got the idea of the origin of earthquakes. In modern Tagalog mythology, earthquakes are caused by a messianic figure named Bernardo Carpio, the King of the Tagalogs, who was trapped between the boulders in the mountains of Montalban. In contrast to the gigantic subterranean crocodile, the ancient Tagalogs also believed in the existence of a gigantic celestial bird which made its nest in the clouds. It is not clear, however, whether this bird is associated with the primordial kite/glede that initiated the series of events which led to the creation of the world and humankind. According to Colin, the Tagalogs believed that the first man and woman sprang from a bamboo pole pecked by a bird they called &quot;Tigmamanokin&quot; to which they applied the name of their god Bathala.

===Connection to Dian Masalanta===
According to Father San Agustin, the Tirurays worshipped &quot;Linog&quot;, meaning &quot;earthquake&quot;, who, as the god of marriage, advised the first man and woman to mate and populate the earth. &quot;Bathala Meycapal&quot;, therefore, is identified with the Tiruray&#x27;s god of marriage, linking him to another Tagalog deity named &quot;Dian Masalanta&quot;. &quot;Dian Masalanta&quot; is an idol who was mentioned by Juan de Plasencia in &quot;Relacion de las Costumbres de Los Tagalos&quot; (1589) as the patron of lovers and procreation. &quot;Dian Masalanta&quot; is also correlated by some scholars to an unnamed Tagalog deity, referred to by the contemporary of Plasencia as &quot;Alpriapo&quot;. This deity is often misidentified as the goddess of childbirth by modern writers, despite the fact that Plasencia used the masculine &quot;patron&quot; instead of the feminine &quot;patrona&quot; (patroness). The true anito of childbirth is actually &quot;La Campinay&quot; (&quot;Lakang Pinay&quot; or &quot;Lakampinay&quot;) [Pardo inquisition report (1686–1688)], who is said to be &quot;the first midwife in the world&quot; [Boxer Codex (1590)].

The meaning of the name &quot;Dian Masalanta&quot; is not provided, but according to Jean-Paul G. Potet (Ancient Beliefs and Customs of the Tagalogs, 2018), the meaning could be &quot;the blind deity&quot; [dian &quot;deity&quot;, ma – &quot;adj. prefic&quot; + salanta &quot;blindness&quot;]. However, the name could also mean &quot;the blinding light&quot; (Sun?) assuming that the original spelling of the name in Tagalog was Diyang Masalanta, from Sanskrit Dia or Diya meaning &quot;lamp or light&quot;/ In the Malay language, &quot;Dian&quot; means candle. &quot;Dia&quot; is also the name of the supreme god of the early Visayans according to Blumentritt, which some scholars believed was derived from Sanskrit Dyu &quot;bright shining sky&quot;, one of the first names ever given to god, which developed into the &quot;Dewas&quot; and &quot;Diwatas&quot; of all the Malayan nations. &quot;Masalanta&quot; (devastating) comes from the root word &quot;salanta&quot;, which is listeded in the &quot;Noceda and Sanlucar Vocabulario de la lengua Tagala (1754)&quot; and the &quot;San Buenaventura dictionary (1613)&quot; as meaning &quot;poor, needy, crippled, and blind&quot;. Generally, the words &quot;magsalanta&quot; and &quot;nasalanta&quot;, which mean &quot;is destroyed/devastated&quot;, are used to refer to a calamity, such as a typhoon, flood, or earthquake.

Professor of Anthropology Fay-Cooper Cole identified the Mandayan supreme gods—the father and son &quot;Mansilatan&quot; (The Creator) and &quot;Batla&quot;/&quot;Badla&quot; (The Preserver/Protector)—with the Tagalog deities &quot;Dian Masalanta&quot; and &quot;Bathala&quot;/&quot;Badhala&quot;, respectively. He also noted that &quot;Todlai&quot;, the god of marriage of the Bagobo people, is sometimes addressed as &quot;Maniládan&quot;. Mansilatan, the father of Batla, is the source of the omnipotent virtue called &quot;Busao&quot;, which takes possession of the &quot;Baylans&quot; (Priestesses) and the &quot;Baganis&quot; (Warriors) while they are in a trance, making them strong and valiant above other men. In other ethnolinguistic groups of the Philippines, the term &quot;Busao&quot; refers to demons, monsters, and/or the spirit or god of calamity. In the Mandayan language, the prefix &quot;man&quot; indicates paternity, being or dominion, while the word &quot;silatan&quot; means &#x27;east&#x27;, the direction of the rising sun.

Among the ancient Tagalogs, there existed a doctrine—which, according to Chirino (1601–1604), was sown by the Devil—that a woman who did not have a lover, whether married or single, could not be saved. They said that this man, in the other world, would hasten to offer the woman his hand at the passage of a very perilous stream which had no other bridge than a very narrow beam, which was traversed to reach the repose that they call &quot;Kaluwálhatian&quot; i.e. Bathala&#x27;s abode. Hence, virginity was not recognized or esteemed among them; rather, they considered it a misfortune and a humiliation. This doctrine explains why most religious ministers (&quot;catalonas&quot;) among the ancient Tagalogs were women. Some minority tribes in the Philippines who still have some priestesses serving them, such as the Mandayas, offer an explanation. They assert that, as opposed to men, women are more appealing and persuasive toward gods and evil spirits, who are mostly males. Other places in the afterlife besides &quot;Kaluwálhatian&quot; include &quot;Maca&quot; or &quot;kasanáan ng tuwa&quot; (&quot;a thousand joys&quot;), where good souls temporarily stay pending reincarnation, and &quot;kasanáan ng hírap&quot; (&quot;a thousand pains&quot;), where bad souls go. Whether or not &quot;Dian Masalanta&quot; is identified with &quot;Bathala Meycapal&quot; is impossible to know, as the former has only been mentioned—and rather briefly—in &quot;Relacion de las Costumbres de Los Tagalos&quot; (1589) by Juan de Plasencia.

===Whether or not Bathala is a solar deity===
Another possible name for Bathala, although unconfirmed, is Hari, which is the old Tagalog name for the sun (&#x27;king’ in modern Tagalog), hence the Tagalog words &quot;tanghali&quot; (noon) and &quot;halimaw&quot; (lion or tiger, an animal associated with the sun in Vedic religion). The ancient Tagalogs believed that the rainbow (&quot;balangaw&quot;) was either Bathala&#x27;s bridge (&quot;balaghari&quot;) or loincloth (&quot;bahaghari&quot;). The rainbow was regarded as a divine sign, and it was considered blasphemy to point one&#x27;s finger at it. The Tagalogs today still use the expression &quot;harinawa&quot;, which means &quot;God willing&quot; or &quot;may God wills it&quot;. In an article written by Lorenz Lasco in Dalumat Ejournal, he cited that, in Philippine mythologies, the sky-world&#x27;s own &quot;anito&quot; (deity) is the Sun which is symbolized by a bird. However, there is no evidence or documentations directly referring to or describing Bathala as a solar deity. The Hiligaynon anthropologist F. Landa Jocano mentioned &quot;Apolaki&quot; as the solar and war god of the ancient Tagalogs, who is actually the supreme god of the ancient Pangasinans, alternatively addressed by them as Anagaoley or Ama-Gaoley (Supreme Father). According to Jean-Paul G. Potet (Ancient Beliefs and Customs of the Tagalogs, 2018), no sun deity allegedly worshipped or venerated by the ancient Tagalogs was mentioned in Spanish chronicles.

==Christianity==
The ancient Indian [&quot;Indio&quot; i.e. the Tagalogs] name for God was Bathala, to whom they attributed the creation of the world. Remnants of the old idolatry remain among the people, and the names of some of the idols are preserved. A few phrases are still retained, especially in the remoter parts, as for example, &quot;Magpabathala ca&quot; (Let the will of Bathala be done), and the priest have been generally willing to recognize the name as not objectionable in substitution for &quot;Dios&quot;. The Tagal word adopted for Idolatry is Pagaanito, but to the worship of images they give the term Anito.
:— Sir John Bowring, &quot;A Visit to the Philippine Islands in 1858&quot;, 1859

During the conversion of the Tagalogs to Christianity, the &quot;katalonan&quot; (shamans) were condemned by Spaniard missionaries as witches and were forced to convert. Ancestral and nature spirits were demonised, sometimes conflated with Biblical demons. The dictionary of Fray Domingo de los Santos gives Bathala as the Tagalog name for God the Creator in contrast with idols, to which the dictionary gives the collective names &quot;anito&quot; and &quot;lic-ha&quot;, or statues. The friars believed that the anitos were demons who led the Tagalogs away from the worship of God, but Bathala was the exception to this as he was similar to the Christian concept of the Creator. The people learned to incorporate Catholic elements into some of their traditional rituals such as the &quot;Sanghiyang&quot; wherein the majority of the spirits invoked are presumed Christian saints. As noted by Alejandro Roces, &quot;In Alfonso, Cavite, there is a Barrio called Marahan where there lives an exclusive sect that perform a cultic ritual known as &quot;Sanghiyang&quot;. This ritual used to be a pagan rite of ancestral worship but was later imbued with Christian connotations and biblical justification&quot;. Presently, &quot;Sanghiyang&quot; is being practiced not only as a form of ancestral worship but also as preparation for mediumistic healing and as a preliminary rite for a more colorful ritual called &quot;Sayaw sa Apoy&quot; (Dance on Fire). In the course of the 19th century, the term Bathala fell out of use, as it was replaced by &quot;Panginoon&quot; (Lord) and &quot;Diyos&quot; (God).

 but now they never say: &quot;Bathalang Maykapal&quot;, &quot;Bathalang San Jose&quot;; if not &quot;Panginoong Diyos&quot;, &quot;Panginoong San Jose&quot;, and the &quot;Panginoon&quot; means &quot;Lord&quot;, like &quot;Apo&quot;.
:— De los Reyes&#x27; study (1909:113)

==Bathalismo==
&quot;Bathalismo&quot; is a religious movement in the Philippines whose mythology is partly borrowed from Christianity. Bathala is a name in this movement, hence its case markers in Tagalog are &quot;si&quot;, &quot;ni&quot;, and &quot;kay&quot;. In classical Tagalog, Bathala, being a title, not a name, has the markers of common nouns – ang/ng/sa – e.g. &quot;ngunit ang Bathala’y dapat nating sundin&quot; (but God we must obey). The same rule applies to Diyos – ang Diyos/ng Diyos/sa Diyos. Regarding the word “Bathala” in Baybayin, with the characters written from top to bottom, Pedro Paterno (1915 in Pambid 2000:108) considers that the “ba” character stands for ‘’babae’’ (woman/female), the “la” character for &quot;lalaki&quot; (man/male), and the “ha” character for the rays of spiritual light beaming from heaven, or the Holy Spirit of God. According to him, this was the concept of the Holy Trinity before the arrival of Christianity in the Philippines. Paterno was a self-styled renaissance man. He was educated in philosophy and theology, and he held a doctorate in law. He also wrote several books on Filipino ethnology, including &quot;La antigua civilización tagalog&quot;, the book in which he first imagined the Bathala-baybayin connection which some people today misconstrue as a proven part of ancient Filipino spirituality. Jose Rizal, no less, wrote the following in a letter to his friend, the ethnologist Ferdinand Blumentritt:

In regard to the work of my countryman P.A. Paterno on Bathalà, I tell you, pay no attention to it; P.A. Paterno is like this: [here Rizal drew a line with a series of loops]. I can find no word for it, but only a sign like this: [more loops].

==Anting-anting==

In Anting-anting—the post-colonial esoteric belief system and traditional occult practices of the Tagalogs—Bathala, also known as the &quot;Infinito Dios&quot; or &quot;Nuno&quot;, is identified with the magical power (&quot;bertud&quot; or &quot;galing&quot;) that resides in amulets and talismans.

It can be said that the &quot;Infinito Dios&quot; or &quot;Nuno&quot; (native Bathala of the Tagalogs) is the genius or &quot;galing&quot; of Filipinos who entered the stone or &quot;anting-anting&quot;, that even though they were not able to blossom and won because of poverty and lack of power
:— Nenita Pambid, &quot;Anting-Anting: O Kung Bakit Nagtatago sa Loob ng Bato si Bathala&quot;

In this belief system, the &quot;Nuno&quot; or &quot;Infinito Dios&quot; is the highest God and the oldest being, from whom everything else has emanated. One such emanation is the &quot;Santisima Trinidad&quot; (Holy Trinity), to whom the &quot;Infinito Dios&quot; gave the authority to create the world and its inhabitants. &quot;Maria&quot; (who should not be confused with the Virgin Mary) or the &quot;Infinita Dios&quot; (i.e. the female aspect of the Divine) is said to be the first emanation of the &quot;Infinito Dios&quot;, who sprang forth from his mind (Holy Wisdom/Divine Logos?). The sum of all these powers are the &quot;Cinco Vocales&quot;, i.e. the five vowels of the Filipino alphabet: AEIOU. &#x27;A&#x27; for the &quot;Infinito Dios&quot;/&quot;Nuno&quot;, &#x27;E&#x27; for the &quot;Infinita Dios&quot;/&quot;Maria&quot;, &#x27;I&#x27; for God the Father, &#x27;O&#x27; for God the Son, and &#x27;U&#x27; for God the Holy Spirit. The &quot;Cinco Vocales&quot;, also known as the fragmentation (&quot;basag&quot;) of the supreme deity, are said to be the secret names of God who gives power. The &quot;antiñgeros&quot; (initiates of anting-anting) have simplified the complexity of one god in five personas. For them, the &quot;Cinco Vocales&quot; rank as the highest deity because they are the complete composition of the five highest gods (&quot;Kadeusan&quot;). The &quot;Infinito Dios&quot;/&quot;Nuno&quot;, the &quot;Infinita Dios&quot;/&quot;Maria&quot;, and the &quot;Santisima Trinidad&quot; all share in the equality of their divinity. No one of them is more or less than any of the others. The &quot;Infinito Dios&quot; is also referred to as &quot;Animasola&quot; (Lonely Soul), &quot;Waksim&quot; (his name as a water deity), and &quot;Atardar&quot; (reflecting his warrior or protective aspect). On the other hand, the &quot;Infinita Dios&quot; is also referred to as &quot;Gumamela Celis&quot; (Flower of Heaven), &quot;Rosa Mundi&quot; (Flower of the World), and &quot;Dios Ina&quot; (God the Mother); she is also identified with the concept of &quot;Inang Pilipinas&quot; (Mother Philippines) or &quot;Inang Bayan&quot; (Motherland) celebrated in the writings of the revolutionary Andres Bonifacio (Tapunan ng Lingap; Katapusang Hibik ng Pilipinas). Although it is widely believed that this esoteric belief system preceded Spanish colonization and Catholicism, the Tagalog term &quot;antíng-antíng&quot; (talisman) was not recorded by lexicographers until the second half of the 19th century. The same can be said of its synonyms: &quot;agímat&quot;, &quot;búti&quot;, &quot;dúpil&quot;, and &quot;galíng&quot; (Laktaw 1914:236: dúpil).

===The theogony of the Infinito Dios===
In the beginning, there was a bright light that covered the entire universe. This light was called the &quot;Infinito Dios&quot;. There is considered to be no God other than the &quot;Infinito Dios&quot;. He was the &quot;Animasola&quot; (Lonely Soul), a winged eye wrapped in a shawl, forever changing his form while floating in space. Soon, the &quot;Infinito Dios&quot; decided to create the world. He pulled away the light in order to give way to the darkness. His light receded until it became a small ball of light. The ball of light suddenly had a gash on its lower portion that became a mouth. On top of the mouth, a line appeared that became a nose. On top of the nose emerged two holes that became eyes. From these eyes came forth bursts of flame. Parallel to the eyes, on the sides of the ball of light, two holes appeared that became ears. In short, the &quot;Infinito Dios&quot;, once a ball of light, became a figure resembling a man&#x27;s head.

Before the &quot;Infinito Dios&quot; created the universe, he decided to have someone help him in his task of creation. While thinking, five shining letters sprang forth from his mind that became the five petals of a beautiful flower (&quot;mayuming bulaklak&quot;). This flower was called the &quot;Gumamela Celis&quot; (Flower of Heaven) or &quot;Rosa Mundi&quot; (Flower of the Earth). The five letters were none other than the beautiful name M-A-R-I-A, which in the Syrian language is Miriam, which means the highest. The original name of Maria before God created the universe was &quot;Bulaklak&quot; (Flower).

The &quot;Infinito Dios&quot; decided to create other beings to assist him in his task of creation. While thinking, the &quot;Infinito Dios&quot; suddenly began perspirating on his right side. When he wiped off the perspiration, the droplets became sixteen spirits. Two of these spirits became &quot;Uph Madac&quot; and &quot;Abo Natac&quot;, the two elders who would reside in the two corners of the Earth and would become the guardians of the Sun and the Moon. The next six spirits became the beings who would reside outside the Earth. They did not want to receive any blessings from the &quot;Infinito Dios&quot;. They were named &quot;Elim&quot;, &quot;Borim&quot;, &quot;Morim&quot;, &quot;Bicairim&quot;, &quot;Persalutim&quot;, and &quot;Mitim&quot;. The next seven spirits became the unbaptized Archangels named &quot;Amaley&quot;, &quot;Alpacor&quot;, &quot;Amacor&quot;, &quot;Apalco&quot;, &quot;Alco&quot;, &quot;Araco&quot;, and &quot;Azarague&quot;. The last spirit was called &quot;Luxbel&quot;, a spirit whose name means light of heaven. He was named &quot;Becca&quot;, the being who would later rebel against the &quot;Infinito Dios&quot;. His other name was Lucifer.

Meanwhile, the &quot;Infinito Dios&quot; decided to create even more beings. While thinking, he suddenly began perspiring on his left side. Wiping the perspiration off, the droplets became eight spirit beings. Five of them became beings who would go to Jesus Christ while he was nailed to the cross to ask for his blessing; however, Jesus would expire before he could give his blessing to these five spirits. The five spirits never received their blessings and therefore retained their original names of &quot;Istac&quot;, &quot;Inatac&quot;, &quot;Islalao&quot;, &quot;Tartaraw&quot;, and &quot;Sarapao&quot;. The last three spirit beings became known as the &quot;Tres Personas&quot;, or the &quot;Santisima Trinidad&quot;. The &quot;Infinito Dios&quot; gave them the task to create the world and its inhabitants. On each of the eyes of the &quot;Tres Personas&quot; could be seen the letter M, the initial of each of their names: &quot;Magub&quot;, &quot;Mariagub&quot;, and &quot;Magugab&quot;.

===The Infinito Dios and Bulaklak===
Before the name &quot;Maria&quot; was used, God only called the first fruit of his thought &quot;Bulaklak&quot; (Flower). The first thing God prepared for the beginning of his creation was &quot;Impierno&quot; (Hell) or &quot;Averni&quot;, which was below and in the abyss. He said to &quot;Bulaklak&quot;: &quot;I will leave you for a while—guard my Ark of the Covenant and do not dare to open it. If you do not obey my command, you will go down to the land that I will create and will suffer to gather the scattered and lost &quot;virtudes&quot;.&#x27; Once God had said that, he went down to the abyss to prepare a sad home for his chosen Archangels, who would be created and rebel against him. When God left, &quot;Bulaklak&quot; opened the said Ark of the Covenant in the desire to know the truth and fulfillment of God&#x27;s words. When the Ark was opened, three letters &quot;B&quot; with wings suddenly appeared and flew away. The three letters mentioned were &quot;BAM&quot;, &quot;BAU&quot;, and &quot;BIM&quot; also known as the &quot;Tres Virtudes&quot;, which were very miraculous and wonderful. &quot;Bulaklak&quot; immediately closed the box, but the three &quot;B&quot;&#x27;s had been released already, and she could not find them. When God returned from the abyss, he said to &quot;Bulaklak&quot;: &quot;Now, what I said to you will be fulfilled—that you will descend to the earth and will suffer.&quot;

God had already made a plan for and the forms of his works and creations: water, fire, earth, heaven, trees and plants, Sun, Moon, stars, and, above all, the holy spirits that would help him in his works and creations. God showed them to his consultant &quot;Bulaklak&quot;. She said that the spiritual creations were perfect, but the material things should be changed. This was because, in God&#x27;s plan, the huge and tall trees were to bear large fruits, and the small and low trees were to bear tiny fruits. &quot;Bulaklak&quot; said that if those trees were to be placed on the ground, people and animals would seek shelter under the huge and tall trees when exposed to the heat of the sun, and if the large fruits of the trees were ripe and could no longer cling to the stalk and withstand the fall, they may cause injury or death to said people and animals.

God changed his plan in accordance with &quot;Bulaklak’s&quot; advice. The huge and tall trees would be the ones to bear tiny fruits, while the small and low trees would be the ones to bear large fruits. When everything was ready, God thought to create his helpers, but he was suddenly sweaty, and when he shed the sweat away on his right and left sides, the sixteen droplets of sweat on his right side became sixteen spirits, while the eight droplets of sweat on his left side became eight other spirits. From these twenty-four, he drew three to carry out his plan of creation. These were the so-called three powerful &quot;Avelator&quot;, &quot;Avetemet&quot;, and &quot;Avetillo&quot;. These were the &quot;Tres Personas&quot;, or the &quot;Santisima Trinidad&quot;, who would speak from the beginning of creation.

===The Nuno and the Santisima Trinidad===
The &quot;Nuno&quot; or &quot;Infinito Dios&quot;, the first and most powerful deity of all, created twenty-four holy spirits, and among them he chose three who would come to be known under the names &quot;Tres Persona Solo Dios&quot;, the &quot;Sagrada Familia&quot;, and the &quot;Santisima Trinidad&quot;. The Three were the helpers and executioners of the creative plans made by the &quot;Nuno&quot; and by &quot;Maria&quot;, or &quot;Gumamela Celis&quot;.
When the &quot;Tres Persona&quot; – God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit – talked about the things they created, suddenly the &quot;Nuno&quot; joined in and hid from the Three. The Three thought that they were the first and had the right to plan creations. They were not aware that everything was planned before they were created. The &quot;Tres Persona&quot; were deeply confused by the mysterious voice they heard and what they saw: a winged eye, a light, and an old man. As the Three chased the mysterious voice, they exchanged &quot;oraciones&quot; or words of power until they reached Heaven&#x27;s gate. In this phase, the &quot;Tres Persona&quot; would be called the &quot;Sagrada Familia&quot;.

The &quot;Tres Persona&quot; did not know that they came from one God, the &quot;Nuno&quot;, that God the Father was the son of the &quot;Nuno&quot;, and that God the Son was the &quot;Nuno&quot;&#x27;s grandchild. Because they did not know this, they desired to seize and baptize whom they thought was the god of the heathens in order to be saved. The chase ended when the &quot;Nuno&quot; entered the mount &quot;Bood&quot;. After a battle and an exchange of &quot;oraciones&quot;, with persuasion the &quot;Nuno&quot; agreed to be baptized, but would do so by his own power. The &quot;Nuno&quot; took out his finger from the rock of the mount &quot;Bood&quot; to be baptized, as depicted in the &quot;anting-anting&quot; of the &quot;Infinito Dios&quot;. However, it is said that, for some mysterious reason, the &quot;Nuno&quot; was not really baptized.

===The twenty-four Ancianos===
The twenty-four &quot;Ancianos&quot; are the holy spirits created by the &quot;Infinito Dios&quot; (from his sweat) as helpers in his works; they are identified by the &quot;antiñgeros&quot; with the Twenty-Four Elders mentioned in Revelation 11:16. The twenty-four &quot;Ancianos&quot; have been given by the &quot;Infinito Dios&quot; roles and names which wield magical powers. One of the duties of the twenty-four &quot;Ancianos&quot; is to keep track of the hours of each day: the first of them is to keep track of the time at 1 o’clock in the morning and so on in succession until the end of exactly 24 hours according to their respective numbers. They are also the observers of everything that people do or work on earth, be it right or wrong, so man&#x27;s sins are not safe from the Lord because of it.

The first two elders (&quot;nuno&quot;) reside in the two corners of the Earth and are the guardians of the Sun and the Moon:

1. Uph Madac – The first spirit of the twenty-four &quot;Ancianos&quot;, responsible for guarding the first hour after midnight. She designed the Sun in accordance with a task given to her by the &quot;Infinito Dios&quot;. She made many designs and presented them to her companions and to the Lord, and they all agreed on the shape and appearance of the sun that would give light to the world from then until now and into the future.

2. Abo Natac – The second spirit, who designed the Moon, which gives us light during the night. He did so many times, and these designs were presented to his companions and to the &quot;Infinito Dios&quot;, and they agreed on the shape of the moon that is present today.

The following six spirits do not have any other office. What they do is just wander out into the world and be God&#x27;s watchmen:

3. Elim – The watchman from 3:00 AM to 3:59 AM

4. Borim – The watchman from 4:00 AM to 4:59 AM

5. Morim – The watchman from 5:00 AM to 5:59 AM

6. Bicairim – The watchman from 6:00 AM to 6:59 AM

7. Persalutim – The watchman from 7:00 AM to 7:59 AM

8. Mitim – The watchman from 8:00 AM to 8:59 AM

The Siete Arkanghelis:

9. Amaley – The president and first minister of the archangel warriors. He is &quot;San Miguel Arkanghel&quot;; on his shoulders rests the fight against the wicked to have security on Earth and in heaven. &quot;San Miguel&quot; is assigned as the watchman from 9:00 AM to 9:59 AM each day; he is also the watchman on the first day of each week, which is Sunday, so he is called upon on this day to prevent any disastrous events that may occur. He is also the spirit messenger and messenger of the &quot;Infinito Dios&quot; throughout the heavens.

10. Alpacor – Made secretary of the whole universe by the &quot;Siete Arkanghelis&quot;, he is &quot;San Gabriel&quot;, who is the recorder of all the hidden wonders in the galaxy and the whole universe. &quot;San Gabriel&quot; is the watchman from 10:00 AM to 10:59 AM each day. He is also the watchman every Monday; therefore, people call upon him on this day to be saved from disasters.

11. Amacor – The prince of angelic justice and the giver of heavenly grace, for which he is also the Butler of the Infinite God. This angel is well known by the name &quot;San Rafael&quot;. He is the watchman from 11:00 AM to 11:59 AM each day and each Tuesday. He is the one to be called upon on Tuesdays for salvation from calamities.

12. Apalco – The angel who was made Justicia mayor in heaven. Chief Ruler of heavenly things and recommender to God of punishments to be inflicted, he is also the giver of wisdom to be used by the soul and earthly body of man. This angel is identified as &quot;San Uriel&quot;, who is assigned to watch at 12:00 noon, and he is also the watchman on Wednesdays, so he must be called on this day to be saved from a disaster.

13. Alco – The spirit that offers or prays to God for every good work of man, he is also the receiver and informer of human needs regarding God. This angel is &quot;San Seatiel&quot;, who is the watchman on Thursdays and at the time of the first hour of the afternoon of each day, so he is to be called upon at these times.

14. Araco – The spirit who was made the keeper of treasures and graces. He holds the key to giving the riches and glory of God. This angel is &quot;San Judiel&quot;, the benefactor and giver of God&#x27;s mercy. He is also the assigned watchman on Fridays and from 2:00 PM to 2:59 PM each day, so he is to be called upon at these times.

15. Azarague – The guardian spirit of heaven and Earth and the helper and protector of all spirits under the Infinito Dios. He is &quot;San Baraquiel&quot;, the watchman at 3:00 PM of each day, and is also assigned as the watchman every Saturday, so he is the one to be called on this day. &quot;San Baraquiel&quot; is the last of the Seven Archangels, who are known as the seven warriors of God the Father.

The Rebel:

16. Luxbel – The youngest (&quot;bunso&quot;) of the 16 spirits first created by the &quot;Infinito Dios&quot;. His name means &quot;Light of Heaven&quot; because he is considered the closest to God. When God began his creation, he was baptized with the name Becca, but he disobeyed the Infinito Dios, so God renamed him &quot;Luxquer&quot; or &quot;Lucifer&quot;. The history of &quot;Luxbel&quot; can be found in a book entitled &quot;Diez Mundos&quot; (Ten Planets). In this book exist various types of illicit wisdom, such as hexes (&quot;kulam&quot;), glamour (&quot;malik mata&quot;), philters (&quot;gayuma&quot;) and much more. All are discouraged from having a copy of this book because it is considered the cause of the unforgivable sin against the Lord.

The following five spirits were not baptized and did not accept the &quot;Infinito Dios&quot;&#x27;s calling. When the Lord Jesus Christ was hanging on the cross, they came to be baptized, but it did not turn out because at that time, the Lord Jesus breathed his last. They are:

17. Istac – The watchman from 5:00 PM to 5:59 PM.

18. Inatac – The watchman from 6:00 PM to 6:59 PM.

19. Islalao – The watchman from 7:00 PM to 7:59 PM.

20. Tartarao – The watchman from 8:00 PM to 8:59 PM.

21. Sarapao – The watchman from 9:00 PM to 9:59 PM.

The last three spirits are the Santisima Trinidad:

22. Magugab – Presents himself as &quot;Dios Ama&quot; (God the Father), who some say is the first person of the &quot;Santisima Trinidad&quot;. But as &quot;Dios Ama&quot;, he is not the &quot;Infinito Dios&quot;, but only given the right and duty to identify himself as God the Father. He was given the design of the world and all its contents, such as the various types of flying creatures in the air and those crawling on the ground, including man. He is the watchman from 9:00 PM to 9:59 PM.

23. Mariagub – The second person of the &quot;Santisima Trinidad&quot;, he has the fullness of &quot;Dios Anak&quot; (God the Son) and the power to fulfill all the mysteries wrought by the Lord Jesus Christ. He is the spirit who incarnates in order to save those who receive him and believe in him. This spirit, in every age, enters the bodies of the people commanded by God, who, in this context, is called the &quot;Lamb of God&quot;. He is the watchman from 10:00 PM to 10:59 PM.

24. Magub – The third person of the &quot;Santisima Trinidad&quot;, as the &quot;Espiritu Santo&quot; (Holy Spirit), he acts to accomplish whatever must happen in the present. Through his power, the promises of the &quot;Infinito Dios&quot; to the people are formed and fulfilled. He is the watchman from 11:00 PM to 12:00 midnight.

==The term &quot;Bathala&quot; in other cultures==

In ancient Bicol, &quot;bathala&quot; was a minor divinity, represented by a small image which Bicolanos always carried for good luck; according to the Bicol grammar of Mark of Lisbon (1628, 61), &quot;they say it was an anito that brought good luck to one it accompanied&quot;. Thus, if a man was never hit by objects thrown at him, he was said to be &quot;batalaan&quot;. According to Ferdinand Blumentritt, the ancient Bicolano &quot;bathala&quot; was a kind of guardian angel. Its counterpart in the Tagalog culture, according to Isabelo de los Reyes, was the &quot;badhala katutubo&quot;.

According to Andrés de San Nicolás (1664, 420), &quot;Bathala mey kapal&quot; was also among the deities of the Sambal people, whose false genealogies and fabulous deeds they celebrated in certain tunes and verses like hymns, which William Henry Scott wrote may have been due to the influence of the Tagalogs on the Sambal&#x27;s culture and beliefs.

Diccionario Pampango del P. Beiv gaño, 1860 defines &quot;batala&quot; as &quot;a bird to whom the Pampangos have their omens&quot;.

According to Ferdinand Blumentritt (1895), the term &quot;bathala&quot; among the ancient Visayans referred to the images of &quot;diwatas&quot; (gods).

===Ancient Visayan invocation to Bathala===
&lt;poem style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;
1. &quot;Bathala, origin of the first creatures, &quot; 
&quot;Lives in the high mountains; &quot; 
&quot;In your two hands&quot; 
&quot;Resides the generator-&quot; 
&quot;Maniliw, who is a witch. &quot; 
&quot;Tall like the trunk&quot; 
&quot;Of the coconut; &quot; 
&quot;Solid like rock; &quot; 
&quot;Voracious like fire; &quot; 
&quot;Fierce, more than the mad perverse dog. &quot; 
&quot;From your breast&quot; 
&quot;The generator Lulid&quot; 
&quot;Went forth. &quot;

&quot;It is he&quot;
&quot;Who does what he likes; &quot;
&quot;Who darkens&quot;
&quot;More than the night-&quot;
&quot;Like the stalk of the Palay; &quot;
&quot;And Sometimes&quot;
&quot;As if by means of rays of light, &quot;
&quot;Shoots the witches like an arrow. &quot;
&quot;Your living among the pygmies. &quot;
&quot;Destroy, oh, those bad characters&quot;
&quot;Of the generator Kamakala. &quot;

2. &quot;Bathala, thou art, oh, little bird, Adarna! &quot;
&quot;Oh thou, who art nestled in that encumbered home-&quot;
&quot;The abode of hawks and eagles, &quot;
&quot;Descend, we pray thee, to earth, &quot;
&quot;With all thy multicolored feathers&quot;
&quot;And thy silken, feathery tail-&quot;
&quot;Descend! Descend!-to earth. &quot;
&quot;Oh, thou bright-winged, little bird! &quot;
&quot;Celestial gift arth thou, prepared for the earth-&quot;
&quot;Our life&#x27;s source, our mother devoted. &quot;
&quot;Verily, thou hast suffered pains in those confines&quot;
&quot;Of mountains craggy and precipitous-&quot;
&quot;Searching for lakes of emerald, now vanished. &quot;
&quot;Ferocious animals&quot;
&quot;Art thine, mother&quot;
&quot;Oh, venerable Mount Kanlaon-&quot;
&quot;The ruler of the people of the mountain.&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

Note: The bird Adarna is the eponymous character of a 16th-century Filipino tale in verse, &quot;&quot;Corrido&quot; and Life Lived by the Three Princes, children of King Fernando and Queen Valeriana in the Kingdom of Berbania&quot;, which is believed by some researchers to have been based on similar European stories. The tale is also known as &quot;The Adarna Bird&quot;.

===Original Visayan invocation===
&lt;poem style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;

&quot;Bathala, pinunuan sang mga&quot;
&quot;una nga mga inanak, &quot;
&quot;Dito mag estar sa mga layog&quot;
&quot;Sa anang alima na tagsa&quot;
&quot;Si amay Maniliw nga tamaw&quot;
&quot;nga, &quot;
&quot;Malayog anay sang puno ka&quot;
&quot;niug, &quot;
&quot;Mabakod angay sa bantiling, &quot;
&quot;Kag masupong angay sa&quot;
&quot;kalayo, &quot;
&quot;Mabangis labi a madal nga&quot;
&quot;Bany-aga nga ayam. &quot;
&quot;Sa amang kilid lumsit. &quot;
&quot;Si ama Lulid Amo; &quot;
&quot;Siya ang mag sumunod&quot;
&quot;Kon tunay sa boot niya, &quot;
&quot;Nga mag bulit labing&quot;
&quot;Kagab-ihon mapilong…&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

===Tagalog translation===
&lt;poem style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;

&quot;Bathalang pinagmulan ng&quot;
&quot;mga unang nilikha, &quot;
&quot;Nakatira ka sa mga bundok&quot;
&quot;Sa kamay mo nakalagay&quot;
&quot;Si Maniliw, na mangkukulam&quot;
&quot;Matayog kang parang puno&quot;
&quot;ng niyog; &quot;
&quot;Matigas na parang bato, &quot;
&quot;Masiklab na parang apoy, &quot;
&quot;Mabangis na higit sa&quot;
&quot;Asong nahihibang. &quot;
&quot;Sa dibdib mo lumabas&quot;
&quot;Ang manlilikhang Lulid Amo; &quot;
&quot;Siya ang nakagagawa&quot;
&quot;At nagbibigay dilim&quot;
&quot;Na higit sa gabi…&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

<text>Newport Pagnell is a town and civil parish in the City of Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, England. The Office for National Statistics records Newport Pagnell as part of the Milton Keynes urban area.

The town is separated from the rest of the urban area by the M1 motorway, on which Newport Pagnell Services, the second service station to be opened in the United Kingdom, is located.

The town is more widely known for having the only remaining vellum manufacturer in the United Kingdom, and being the original home of the exclusive sports car manufacturer Aston Martin.

==History==

The town was first mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Neuport&quot;, Old English for &#x27;New Market Town&#x27;, but by that time, the old Anglo-Saxon town was dominated by the Norman invaders. The suffix &#x27;Pagnell&#x27; came later when the manor passed into the hands of the Pagnell (Paynel) family. It was the principal town of the &quot;Three Hundreds of Newport&quot;, a district that had almost the same boundary as the modern City of Milton Keynes UA.

The Grade I listed Tickford Bridge, over the River Ouzel (or Lovat), was built in 1810. It is one of just a few cast iron bridges in Britain that still carry modern road traffic. Near the footbridge at the side, there is a plaque placed by Newport Pagnell Historical Society that gives details of its history and construction. The Ouzel joins the Great Ouse nearby, and a large set of sluice gates used to control downstream flooding is located near the bridge.

Between 1817 and 1864, the town was linked to the Grand Junction Canal at Great Linford via the Newport Pagnell Canal. In 1862, the canal owners sold the route to the London and North Western Railway. For a hundred years (1867 to 1967), Newport Pagnell was served by Newport Pagnell railway station, the terminus on the Wolverton to Newport Pagnell branch line. (The route is now a rail trail, part of the Milton Keynes redway system.)

The population of Newport Pagnell and its hinterland at the 1801 Census was 17,576; by 1911 it had grown to 14,428. The population of Newport Pagnell Urban District alone is first recorded at the 1911 Census as 4,238 and had reached 4,743 by 1961.

===Listed buildings and structures===
The town has one scheduled monument (Civil War defences in Bury Field), two buildings or structures listed at Grade I (Tickford Bridge and the parish church of SS Peter and Paul), one at Grade II* (84 High St.) and a further 118 at Grade II.

The Old Town Hall Chambers, now apartments, were built as a school in the early 19th century.

==Industry==
From 1954 until 2007, the town was the home to the sports car manufacturer Aston Martin. The Newport Pagnell factory was considered outdated and a new production facility was built near Gaydon in Warwickshire. There is still a service facility in Newport Pagnell, but the factory on the north side of Tickford St has since been demolished apart from the engine shop, board room and offices that are listed buildings. The land behind these has been developed by a housing developer. The buildings at the front, including the house used as a board room, have been restored and will be used as commercial sites. In 2012, Aston Martin completely modernised the service facility and the site also houses a bespoke sales department.

Notable industries in the town include the only remaining vellum manufacturer in the United Kingdom, William Cowley, located at Parchment Works, 97 Caldecote Street.

Over the past 50 years, Newport Pagnell has attracted an increasing amount of investment and of economic growth, due to its fortunes being intertwined with the growth of Milton Keynes. This has led to a number of new housing developments in the area.

==Churches==

The modern civil parish of Newport Pagnell stops at the M1, but the Church of England ecclesiastical parish extends to include Broughton and Caldecote. Much of the Grade 1 listed parish Church of St Peter and St Paul dates from the fourteenth century.

==Education==
The town is home to four primary schools – Tickford Park Primary School, Cedars, Green Park Primary School, and Portfields Primary School – and three pre-schools – River Meadows, Lovat Hall and Northern Pastures. It is also home to one of two campuses of Ousedale School (the other one being in nearby Olney), which serves students from across the town and its surrounding villages, and is one of the best performing secondary schools in the City of Milton Keynes.

==Location and transport==
The town is located at the north-eastern corner of the Milton Keynes urban area, overlooking the rural parts of the Unitary Authority area. It is served by the M1 motorway from Junction 14 ( to the south) via the A509 which, along with the A422 and Wolverton Road, connects it with (the rest of) the Milton Keynes BUA. To the east of the town, the A422 and A509 multiplex northwards to form the Newport Pagnell Eastern Bypass, providing links to Bedford, Wellingborough and Kettering. The historic Newport Pagnell-Northampton road (B526) runs through the centre of the town, linking rural villages to the north, and provides a secondary route to Northampton.

It was proposed in January 2021 that, with the money that had been given to Milton Keynes City Council as part of the UK Government&#x27;s Active Travel Fund, Tongwell Lane in Newport Pagnell would be converted into a redway, which would better link the town with the rest of the city. Since its completion in March 2021, the town has been served by three connections to the wider redway network of Milton Keynes, all heading westwards into Blakelands first: Tongwell Lane, Stanmore Gardens and the Wolverton-Newport Pagnell railway walk.

===Developments===
In February 2021, developers presented to Milton Keynes City Council proposals for the development of a new community to the south of Newport Pagnell, with the construction of approximately 5,000 homes. In planning documents, the new area is called &quot;Milton Keynes East&quot;, and is proposed to include a local centre with two primary schools and a secondary school. It is to have direct road links to Newport Pagnell town centre, and Central Milton Keynes via an expansion of the Milton Keynes grid road system. In September 2023, construction of the development initiated, with MK City Council closing the A509 London Road (between M1 J14 and Tickford Roundabout to the south of the town) which is currently in place for up to 18 months, with a new &quot;Eastern Relief Road&quot; and bridge across the M1 planned to be built.

In September 2023, developer Vistry Group was commissioned by MK City Council to construct over 900 timber-framed homes as part of the £275mn Tickford Fields development to the east of the town, with more than 30% of the homes planned to be affordable. The development will also feature a primary school, local centre sports pitches and play areas. It is expected to be energy efficient and sustainable.

Newport Pagnell is identified by the City Council (in local planning documents) as one of the three &quot;Key Settlements&quot; in the Milton Keynes UA outside of the 1967 &quot;designated area&quot; of the New Town, with the town&#x27;s complementary Neighbourhood Plan, adopted in June 2021, allocating a total of 1,400 homes for the town between 2016 and 2031.

===Rail===
The closest passenger rail service is at Wolverton railway station (approximately distant), with inter-city services accessible from Milton Keynes Central (approximately distant).

===Bus===
Bus 21 (Red Rose) operates an hourly service from Monday to Friday, connecting the town with Olney and Lavendon to the north, and Central Milton Keynes to the south-west. Operating roughly every 30 mins from Monday to Friday are the Arriva-operated Bus 1 (serving Willen and CMK), and Bus 2/2A (serving Crownhill).

MK City Council also operates an on demand bus service known as &quot;MK Connect&quot;, which serves the whole MK unitary authority area, including Newport Pagnell.

==Governance==

There are two tiers of local government covering Newport Pagnell, at parish (town) and unitary authority level: Newport Pagnell Town Council and Milton Keynes City Council. The town council has its offices and meeting place at 80 High Street. In City Council elections, the town is divided between the Newport Pagnell South, and Newport Pagnell North and Hanslope wards.

Newport Pagnell became the headquarters of Newport Pagnell Rural District under the Local Government Act 1894. In 1897, Newport Pagnell became the sole civil parish within the newly created Newport Pagnell Urban District. Both the urban and rural district were abolished in 1974, merging with neighbouring districts to become the (then) Borough of Milton Keynes. The former urban district was an unparished area from 1974 to 1985, governed directly by Milton Keynes Borough Council. The civil parish of Newport Pagnell was re-established in 1985, with its council adopting the name Newport Pagnell Town Council.

==Demography==
Although Newport Pagnell was excluded from the 1967 designated area of Milton Keynes, its growth has been at a similar level to that of the constituent towns of the latter; the two now join at the M1 and there are no other practical distinctions between them. As of 2001, the Office for National Statistics records Newport Pagnell as part of the Milton Keynes Urban Area. By the 2001 census, its population had increased significantly from 6,000 in 1971 to 15,020. In 2006, the Borough Council projected that the population will remain broadly stable at this level, and by the 2011 census, the population had increased very little to 15,118.

==Sport and leisure==

Newport Pagnell has a Non-League football team Newport Pagnell Town F.C., nicknamed the Swans, who play at The Pavilion on Willen Road. An ITF Taekwon-Do club, Kicks Taekwon-Do Academy, trains at Cedars Primary School, Bury Street, and a swimming pool. Between 1959 and 1960 it was the headquarters of the Aston Martin F1 team.

===Newport Pagnell Lawn Bowls ===
Bowls has been played in Newport Pagnell for over 400 years as maps of the Town dating from the mid 17 Century show a public House called &quot;The Bowling Green&quot;. The Newport Pagnell Bowling Club was founded in 1905 and the club used the Bowling Green behind the George pub in Tickford Street (currently The Magic Wok 2019). The game was developing locally due to the Railways, with clubs at Wolverton existing already and Olney forming in 1906. After the Great War, the Club purchased a plot of land known as &quot;The Bully&quot; and the Club remains at this site in Castle Meadow to the current day.

<doc id="386623" wikidata="Q1667995" url="?curid=386623" title="Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol">
<text>Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP) is a protocol defined by RFC 2408 for establishing security association (SA) and cryptographic keys in an Internet environment. ISAKMP only provides a framework for authentication and key exchange and is designed to be key exchange independent; protocols such as Internet Key Exchange (IKE) and Kerberized Internet Negotiation of Keys (KINK) provide authenticated keying material for use with ISAKMP. For example: IKE describes a protocol using part of Oakley and part of SKEME in conjunction with ISAKMP to obtain authenticated keying material for use with ISAKMP, and for other security associations such as AH and ESP for the IETF IPsec DOI.

== Overview ==
ISAKMP defines the procedures for authenticating a communicating peer, creation and management of Security Associations, key generation techniques and threat mitigation (e.g. denial of service and replay attacks). As a framework, ISAKMP typically utilizes IKE for key exchange, although other methods have been implemented such as Kerberized Internet Negotiation of Keys. A Preliminary SA is formed using this protocol; later a fresh keying is done.

ISAKMP defines procedures and packet formats to establish, negotiate, modify and delete Security Associations. SAs contain all the information required for execution of various network security services, such as the IP layer services (such as header authentication and payload encapsulation), transport or application layer services or self-protection of negotiation traffic. ISAKMP defines payloads for exchanging key generation and authentication data. These formats provide a consistent framework for transferring key and authentication data which is independent of the key generation technique, encryption algorithm and authentication mechanism.

ISAKMP is distinct from key exchange protocols in order to cleanly separate the details of security association management (and key management) from the details of key exchange. There may be many different key exchange protocols, each with different security properties. However, a common framework is required for agreeing to the format of SA attributes and for negotiating, modifying and deleting SAs. ISAKMP serves as this common framework.

ISAKMP can be implemented over any transport protocol. All implementations must include send and receive capability for ISAKMP using UDP on port 500.

== Implementation ==
OpenBSD first implemented ISAKMP in 1998 via its isakmpd(8) software.

The IPsec Services Service in Microsoft Windows handles this functionality.

The KAME project implements ISAKMP for Linux and most other open source BSDs.

Modern Cisco routers implement ISAKMP for VPN negotiation.

==Vulnerabilities==

Leaked NSA presentations released by &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; indicate that ISAKMP is being exploited in an unknown manner to decrypt IPSec traffic, as is IKE. The researchers who discovered the Logjam attack state that breaking a 1024-bit Diffie–Hellman group would break 66% of VPN servers, 18% of the top million HTTPS domains, and 26% of SSH servers, which is consistent with the leaks according to the researchers.

<doc id="386628" wikidata="Q27403" url="?curid=386628" title="Galatian language">
<text>Galatian is an extinct Celtic language once spoken by the Galatians in Galatia, in central Anatolia (Asian part of modern Turkey), from the 3rd century BC up to at least the 4th century AD. Some sources suggest that it was still spoken in the 6th century. Galatian was contemporary with, and closely related to, Gaulish.

==History==
===Emergence===
The Galatian language, based on onomastic evidence (as no texts written in Galatian have yet been discovered), seems to have closely resembled Gaulish of western and central Europe. The language was introduced to Anatolia in the 3rd century BC, when Celtic tribes – notably the Tectosages, Trocmii, and Tolistobogii – migrated south from the Balkans. According to the Greek historian Strabo, the Tectosages of Anatolia were related to the Volcae Tectosages of Gaul; the parent tribe of both branches, the Volcae, originally lived in central Europe.

===Contemporary Roman sources===
Sometime in AD 48–55, the Apostle Paul wrote his Epistle to the Galatians in Greek, the medium of communication in the eastern parts of the Roman Empire. This may mean that Galatians at the time were already bilingual in Greek, as St. Jerome later reports. However, scholars are divided as to whether Paul was writing to Greek Galatians or to the Hellenized descendants of the Celtic Galatians.

Lucian of Samosata recorded in circa AD 180 that the prophet Alexander of Abonoteichus was able to find Celtic-speaking interpreters for his oracles in Paphlagonia (immediately northeast of Galatia).

The physician Galen of Pergamon in the late 2nd century AD complained that the commonly spoken Greek of his day was being corrupted by borrowings of foreign words from languages such as Galatian.

In the 4th century, St. Jerome (Hieronymus) wrote in a comment to Paul the Apostle&#x27;s &quot;Epistle to the Galatians&quot; that &quot;apart from the Greek language, which is spoken throughout the entire East, the Galatians have their own language, almost the same as the Treveri&quot;. The capital of the Treveri was Trier, where Jerome had settled briefly after studying in Rome.

===Survival into Early Medieval period===
In the 6th century AD, Cyril of Scythopolis suggested that the language was still being spoken in his own day when he related a story that a monk from Galatia was temporarily possessed by Satan and unable to speak; when he recovered from the &quot;possession&quot;, he could respond to the questioning of others only in his native Galatian tongue.

==Vocabulary==
Of the language only a few glosses and brief comments in classical writers and scattered names on inscriptions survive. Altogether they add up to about 120 words, including place and personal names. Scattered vocabulary terms mentioned by Greek authors include ἀδάρκα (&quot;adarka&quot;), a type of plant; αδες (&quot;ades&quot;), &quot;feet&quot;; βαρδοί (&quot;bardoi&quot;), &quot;singing poets, bards&quot;; μάρκα (&quot;marka&quot;), &quot;horse&quot; and τριμαρκισία (&quot;trimarkisia&quot;), &quot;three-horse battle group&quot;.

===Common nouns===
Only three common nouns are certainly attested, and only two of them of Celtic origin. All are attested in Greek sources and are declined as if Greek.
*, , &quot;badger&quot; (cf. Moritasgus)
*, , &quot;snout, nose&quot;
*, , &quot;kermes oak&quot;

Both and are given by Epiphanius of Salamis in his in an effort to elucidate the name of the gnostic sect of the Tascodrugites. Although he has the correct meaning of , he gives as meaning &quot;peg&quot;. It almost certainly means &quot;badger&quot;. The word is not of Celtic origin, but was borrowed into Galatian from another language.

===Personal names===

The attested Galatian personal names are similar to those found elsewhere in the ancient Celtic-speaking world. Many are compound names containing common Celtic roots such as &quot;*brog-&quot;, &quot;country, territory&quot; (cf. Old Irish &quot;mruig&quot;, Welsh and Breton &quot;bro&quot;; cognate with Latin &quot;margo&quot; and Gothic &quot;marka&quot;), &quot;*epo-&quot;, &quot;horse&quot; (Old Irish &quot;ech&quot;, Welsh &quot;eb-&quot; [in &quot;ebol&quot; &quot;pony&quot; and the compound &quot;ebrwydd&quot; &quot;swift&quot;], Breton &quot;ebeul&quot;, foal), &quot;*māro-&quot; (cf. Gaulish &quot;-māros&quot;, Old Irish &quot;mór&quot;, Welsh &quot;mawr&quot;, Breton &quot;meur&quot;) &quot;great&quot;, and &quot;*rig(o)-&quot;, &quot;king&quot; (cf. Gaulish &quot;-rīx/-reix&quot;, Irish &quot;rí&quot;, Welsh &quot;rhi&quot;; cognate with Gothic &quot;-reiks&quot;, Latin &quot;rēx&quot;). Examples include:
* Ἀδιατόριξ (&quot;Adiatorīx&quot;)
* Βιτοριξ (&quot;Bitorīx&quot;)
* Βρογιμάρος (&quot;Brogimāros&quot;)
* Κάμμα (&quot;Cāmmā&quot;)
* Δομνείωυ (&quot;Domneiū&quot;)
* Ἐπόνη (&quot;Eponī&quot;)
* Ολοριξ (&quot;Olorīx&quot;)
* Σμερτομάρα (&quot;Smertomārā&quot;)
* Τεκτομάρος (&quot;Tectomāros&quot;)

Tribal names include &quot;Ambitouti&quot; (Old Irish &quot;imm-&quot;, Welsh &quot;am&quot; &quot;around&quot;; Old Irish &quot;tuath&quot;, Welsh &quot;tut&quot;, &quot;tribe&quot;), Ριγόσαγες (&quot;Rigosages&quot;, &quot;King-Seekers&quot;; cf. Old Irish &quot;saigid&quot; &quot;goes towards, seeks out&quot;, Welsh &quot;haeddu&quot;, verbal suffix &quot;-ha-&quot; &quot;seeking&quot;), and Τεκτόσαγες (&quot;Tectosages&quot;, cf. the related Volcae Tectosages tribe of Gaul, &quot;Travel-seekers&quot;; Old Irish &quot;techt&quot;, &quot;going, proceeding&quot;, Welsh &quot;taith&quot;, &quot;journey, voyage&quot;).

===Divine names===
Attested divine names include βουσσουριγίος (&quot;Bussurīgios&quot;) and Σουωλιβρογηνός (&quot;Suolibrogēnos&quot;), both identified with the Greek king of the gods Zeus, and Ούινδιεινος (&quot;Uindieinos&quot;), perhaps the tutelary god of the Tolistobogian town Ούινδια (&quot;Uindia&quot;).

===Place names===

Attested place names include &quot;Acitorīgiāco&quot; (&quot;[Settlement of] &quot;Acitorīx&quot;&quot;; compare &quot;Acitodunum&quot; in Gaul), Άρτικνιακόν (&quot;Articniācon&quot;, &quot;[Settlement of] &quot;Articnos&quot;&quot; [&quot;Bear-son&quot;]), Δρυνέμετον (&quot;Drunemeton&quot;; &lt; Proto-Celtic &quot;*dru-&quot; &quot;oak&quot; and, by extension, &quot;great&quot;; cf. Old Irish &quot;druí&quot;, Welsh &quot;dryw&quot; [&lt; &quot;*dru-wid-s&quot;], &quot;druid, wise man&quot; [literally &quot;greatly wise&quot;], Old Irish &quot;neimed&quot;, Welsh &quot;nyfed&quot; &quot;holy place, [sacred] grove&quot;), the meeting place of the Galatian and judges, and Ούινδια (&quot;Uindia&quot; &quot;Fair/White/Holy Place&quot;; Old Irish &quot;finn&quot;, Welsh &quot;gwyn&quot; [masc.], &quot;gwen&quot; [fem.] &quot;fair, white; holy&quot;).

<doc id="386630" wikidata="Q450230" url="?curid=386630" title="Theresa Berkley">
<text>Theresa Berkley or Berkeley (died September 1836) was a 19th-century English dominatrix who ran a brothel in Hallam Street, just to the east of Portland Place, Marylebone, London, specialising in flagellation. She is notable as the inventor of the &quot;chevalet&quot; or &quot;Berkley Horse&quot;, a BDSM apparatus.

== Career as a dominatrix ==

Theresa Berkley ran a high-class flagellation brothel at 28 Charlotte Street (which is today&#x27;s 84–94 Hallam Street). She was a &quot;governess&quot;, meaning she specialised in chastisement, whipping, flagellation, and the like. She invented the &quot;Berkley Horse&quot;, an apparatus that reportedly earned her a fortune in flogging wealthy men and women of the time. 

There are no artworks depicting what Theresa Berkley looked like, and occasional descriptions usually report that she was attractive, with a strong disposition. An expert with all instruments of torture, her talents became highly sought after by the aristocracy of the day. She was a master of the art of inflicting pain for pleasure, and practised absolute privacy to protect her clientele. Her clients were said to have been both men and women of wealth, and her career was financially lucrative. Berkley&#x27;s fame was such that the pornographic novel &quot;Exhibition of Female Flagellants&quot; was attributed to her, probably falsely.

One writer said of her: 

According to an unnamed source quoted by Henry Spencer Ashbee, she used a wide variety of torture instruments, including cat-o&#x27;-nine-tails, leather straps, holly brushes, green nettles, and a hook and pulley. Berkley enjoyed a certain amount of torture inflicted &quot;on her&quot; by her clients, given that they were willing to pay her price, but she also employed a number of women for that task if indeed her clients wished to inflict more pain than she was willing to take herself.

== After her death ==

Shortly after her death in 1836, her brother, who had been a missionary for 30 years in Australia, arrived in England. When he learned the source from which the property she had left him had been derived, he renounced all claim, and immediately went back to Australia. In default, the property was bequeathed to Dr Vance, her medical attendant and executor; but he refused to administer, and the whole estate, valued at , was escheated to the crown.

Dr Vance came into possession of her correspondence, several boxes, which was said to have contained letters from the highest aristocracy, both male and female, in the land. The letters were eventually destroyed.

<text>Whitchurch-Stouffville (2021 population 49,864) is a town in the Greater Toronto Area of Ontario, Canada, approximately north of downtown Toronto, and north-east of Toronto Pearson International Airport. It is in area, and located in the mid-eastern area of the Regional Municipality of York on the ecologically-sensitive Oak Ridges Moraine. Its motto since 1993 is &quot;country close to the city&quot;.

The town is bounded by Davis Drive (York Regional Road 31) in the north, York-Durham Line (York Regional Road 30) in the east, and Highway 404 in the west. The southern boundary conforms with a position approximately north of 19th Avenue (York Regional Road 29), and is irregular due to the annexation of lands formerly part of Markham Township in 1971.

Between 2011 and 2021, the town grew 32.8%. The number of private dwellings jumped from 7,642 in 2001 to 16,705 in 2021, with an average of 3.0 people per private dwelling. The town projects a total population of 72,109 by 2031, and 91,654 in 2041, with most of the growth within the urban boundaries of the Community of Stouffville plus lands adjacent to Highway 48 and south of Stouffville Road. Future growth is governed provincially by the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act (2001), the Greenbelt Protection Act (2005) and the Places to Grow Act (2005). The intent of these statutes is to prevent urban sprawl on environmentally sensitive land and to protect the ecological integrity of the moraine and its hydrological features.

==Communities==
The Town of Whitchurch–Stouffville consists of several distinct communities and the intermediary countryside. The largest urban area is the community of Stouffville proper (2021 pop. 36,753), while other communities in the larger town include Ballantrae, Bethesda, Bloomington, Cedar Valley, Gormley, Lemonville, Lincolnville, Musselman&#x27;s Lake, Pine Orchard, Pleasantville, Preston Lake, Ringwood, Vandorf, Vivian, and Wesley Corners.

==History==
The oldest human artifacts found in Whitchurch Township date to 1500 BC and were found in the hamlet of Ringwood (now part of urban Stouffville). Prior to the arrival of Europeans, two Native trails crossed through what is today Whitchurch–Stouffville. The Vandorf Trail ran from the source waters of the Rouge River to Newmarket, across the heights of the hamlet of Vandorf. The Rouge Trail ran along the Rouge River and northwest from Musselman Lake; both were part of the aboriginal and Coureur des bois trail system leading through dense forests from Lake Ontario to Lake Simcoe. The territory was the site of several Native villages, including Iroquoian peoples&#x27; settlements around Preston Lake, Vandorf, and Musselman Lake.

In 2003, a large 16th-century ancestral Huron village was discovered in Stouffville during land development; approximately 2000 people once inhabited the site (Mantle Site), from 1578 to 1623. A palisade protected more than 70 longhouses, and tens of thousands of artifacts were excavated here.

In 2012, archaeologists revealed that a European forged-iron axehead, believed to be Basque, was discovered at the site--&quot;the earliest European piece of iron ever found in the North American interior.&quot;
Other significant late precontact Huron village sites have been located to the south-east (the earlier Draper Site on the Pickering Airport lands) and to the north-west of urban Stouffville (the later Ratcliff or Baker Hill Site on Ontario Highway 48, and the Old Fort or Aurora Site on Kennedy Road).

The western end of Whitchurch and Markham townships was purchased by the British crown from the Mississaugas of the New Credit First Nation in 1787 as part of the Toronto Purchase. Whitchurch Township was created in 1792 as one of ten townships in York County. It was named in honour of the village of Whitchurch, Herefordshire in England, where the family of Elizabeth Simcoe lived (she was the wife of the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada Sir John Graves Simcoe). The first European settlements in Whitchurch Township were established in the 1790s. The south-Central Ontario Mississaugas did not formally cede these areas of Whitchurch and southern Ontario until 1923.

Between 1800 and 1802, John Stegman completed a survey of the township, which created a system of land concessions. This allowed for the organized distribution of land to settlers, with each concession containing five, lots. This layout remains visible today, as the road network in the area reflects the locations of the boundaries between concession blocks.

Early settlers of this period included Quakers and Mennonites—two pacifist groups from the nearby American states of Pennsylvania, Vermont and New York. Both groups were seeking religious freedom, and were identified by the Upper Canadian government as people with necessary skills and abilities for establishing viable communities that could, in turn, attract others to settle in the region. The Crown also granted land in Upper Canada to mercenary German Hessian soldiers, such as Stegman, in exchange for their service against the Thirteen Colonies in the American Revolution.

Many of the first settlements in Whitchurch Township were developed at the intersections of main roads throughout the township and /or near streams where mills could be built to process the timber cleared from the land. Stoufferville was one such hamlet, developing around the saw and grist mills of Abraham Stouffer, a Mennonite who with his wife Elizabeth Reesor Stouffer immigrated from Chambersburg, Pennsylvania in 1804. He acquired of land. Elizabeth&#x27;s brother Peter Reesor established what is today Markham, first called Reesorville. Fifty-five more families from Pennsylvania, mostly Mennonite, arrived in Stoufferville in the next few years. Stouffer&#x27;s sawmill was in operation by 1817 on Duffin&#x27;s Creek on the Whitchurch side of Main Street. By 1825 he had a gristmill across the street on the Markham Township side of Main St. as well.

In the early 1830s, the old Stouffville Road was carved through largely virgin forest to connect York (Toronto) with Brock Township; a post office was opened in 1832 and the name Stouffville was standardized. In 1839, a new resident from England noted that Stouffville still had &quot;no church (other than the Mennonite Meeting House in neighbouring Altona), baker, or butcher,&quot; though &quot;saddlebag [Methodist circuit] preachers sometimes arrived and held meetings at the schoolhouse.&quot; Stouffville was considered a centre &quot;of Radical opinion,&quot; one of the &quot;hotbeds of revolution,&quot; and it was here that William Lyon Mackenzie set forth his plan for the Upper Canada Rebellion of 1837–38.

The hamlet of Stouffville grew rapidly in the 1840s, and by 1849, it had &quot;one physician and surgeon, two stores, two taverns, one blacksmith, one waggon maker, one oatmeal mill, one tailor, one shoemaker.&quot; The population reached 350 in 1851, 600 in 1866, and 866 in 1881, with a diversity of Mennonite, Methodist, Presbyterian, Episcopal, Baptist and Congregational places of worship. In 1869 Ballantrae had a population of 75, Bloomington 50, Gormley 80, Lemonville 75, and Ringwood 100. In 1876, there was a regular stage coach connection from the hamlet of Stouffville to Ringwood, Ballantrae, Lemonville, Glasgow, Altona and Claremont.

In 1877, Stouffville became an incorporated village. Stouffville&#x27;s growth was aided by the establishment of the Toronto and Nipissing Railway, built in 1871, which connected Stouffville and Uxbridge with Toronto. In 1877, a second track was built north to Jackson&#x27;s Point on Lake Simcoe. These connections were created in large part to provide a reliable and efficient means of transporting timber harvested and milled in these regions. Soon &quot;Stouffville Junction&quot; serviced thirty trains per day. During this time of prosperity, Stouffville businessman R.J. Daley built a large music hall, roller-skating rink, and curling rink. In 1911 Stouffville had a public library, two banks, two newspapers, as well as telephone and telegraph connections.

Intensive forestry in Whitchurch Township led to large-scale deforestation, eroding the thinner soils of northern Whitchurch into sand deserts; by 1850 Whitchurch Township was only 35 per cent wooded, and that was reduced to 7 per cent by 1910. The Lake Simcoe Junction Railway Line was consequently abandoned in 1927. Reforestation efforts were begun locally, and with the passage of the Reforestation Act (1911), the process of reclaiming these areas began. Vivian Forest, a large conservation area in northern Whitchurch–Stouffville, was established in 1924 for this purpose. This development has helped to restore the water-holding capacity of the soil and to reduce the cycles of flash spring floods and summer drought. In 2008, the town had more than 62²km of protected forest; the forest is considered one of the most successful restorations of a degraded landscape in North America. Yet similar environmental consequences due to increased urbanization were projected in 2007 by the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority as probable for southern Whitchurch–Stouffville (headwaters of the Rouge River watershed) if targeted plantings in this area did not begin quickly. Already in 1993, the Whitchurch Historical Committee warned a new generation of &quot;Whitchurch-Stouffville residents&quot; to be &quot;vigilant to treat trees and forests with respect ... In the 1990s care must be taken so that urbanization and concrete road-building do not repeat the destruction to our forest heritage.&quot;

Though growth in the hamlets of Whitchurch–Stouffville was stagnant after the demise of the forest industry, the population began to grow again in the 1970s, with development in Metropolitan Toronto and the consequent arrival of new commuters. These developments led to a reexamination at the provincial level of municipal governance. On January 1, 1971, Whitchurch Township and the Village of Stouffville were merged to create the Town of Whitchurch–Stouffville; the combined population was 11,487. The town&#x27;s southern boundary was also moved four farm lots south of the original southern boundary of Main Street. This land was formerly a part of Markham Township.

Whitchurch–Stouffville adopted its coat of arms in 1973 (see information box right). The dove of peace, the original seal of Whitchurch Township, is at the crest, recalling the pacifist Quaker and Mennonite settlers who founded many of the town&#x27;s communities, including Stouffville. The British Union banner of 1707 pays tribute to the United Empire Loyalists. The white church symbolizes Whitchurch, and the star and chalice come from the Stouffer family (Swiss) coat of arms.

The growth of Toronto brought serious ecological problems to Whitchurch–Stouffville. Between 1962 and 1969, hundreds of thousands of litres per month of sulfuric acid, calcium hydroxide, and oil waste were poured into unlined Whitchurch–Stouffville dumps never designed as landfill sites and situated directly above the town&#x27;s main aquifer. This was followed by years of solid waste from Toronto (1,100 tons per day in 1982). In the early 1980s, a group initially named &quot;Concerned Mothers&quot; found that the miscarriage rate in Whitchurch–Stouffville was 26% compared to the provincial average of 15%, and that the town had a high rate of cancer and birth defects. Though the Ministry of Environment was satisfied that the wells tested in 1974 and 1981 had negligible levels of cancer causing agents (mutagens), the town opposed the expansion of the &quot;York Sanitation Site #4&quot;. Only after much grass-roots advocacy at the provincial level was the site ordered to close on June 30, 1983. In 1984 it was reported in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario that PCBs were found in well-water, and that 27,000 gallons of contaminated leachate per day were leaking from the site, threatening ground water quality.

With new commuter rail service on the Stouffville Line in the 1990s, the drilling of two deep aquifer wells to secure safer water for a large, new development in the hamlet of Ballantrae in 1996, and the controversial expansion of the York-Durham Sewage System Big Pipe with additional water capacity from Lake Ontario, Whitchurch–Stouffville began a major self-transformation. Not unlike the late 19th century, responsible land and water stewardship, as well as the positive integration of many new residents annually into the community, define the challenges and opportunities for Whitchurch–Stouffville in the years to come.

The most significant challenge facing Whitchurch–Stouffville in coming years, however, is the federal government&#x27;s potential development of an international airport immediately south-east of Whitchurch–Stouffville (the Pickering Airport lands). Under the current draft plan, approaches for two of the three landing strips would be directly above Whitchurch–Stouffville communities: the first over Ballantrae, Musselman&#x27;s Lake and the north-east corner of urban Stouffville, with planes descending (or ascending) from 535 to 365 metres (with an allowable building height in Stouffville of 43 metres); the second over Gormley and the Dickson Hill area (near the Walmart and Smart Centre). A &quot;Needs Assessment Study&quot; was completed by the Greater Toronto Airports Authority for the federal government in May 2010. After a &quot;due diligence review,&quot; Transport Canada released the report in July 2011, which identified the most likely time range for the need of the airport to be 2027–2029, and confirmed the site layout proposed in the 2004 Draft Plan Report.

In late 2019, the Town decided to drop the word Whitchurch from signs, for &quot;branding&quot; reasons. While signs would indicate &quot;Town of Stouffville&quot;, the official name remained Whitchurch-Stouffville.

==Government==

===Municipal===
Whitchurch–Stouffville is governed by a mayor and six councillors, with one councillor representing each of the six municipal wards. The Mayor of Whitchurch–Stouffville represents the town on the York Regional Council. The original ward boundaries were created with amalgamation in 1971, and were amended in 2009 for the 2010 municipal elections and again in 2021 for the 2022 municipal elections. As of the 2022 election, the elected council members are:

Mayor: Iain Lovatt

One York Region District School Board trustee is elected to represent Whitchurch–Stouffville and Aurora, as well as one trustee for the York Catholic District School Board. A French Public School Board trustee and a French Catholic School Board trustees are also elected on the same ballot as the mayor and town councillors. As of the election in 2022, the elected trustees are:

In 2008, 94.4% of Whitchurch–Stouffville residents were either satisfied or very satisfied with the overall quality of life in the
Town of Whitchurch–Stouffville. In a major community survey, close to 30% of the respondents described the town as fine, good, nice, great, or pleasant; more than half of the respondents like the community or small-town feel, while 46.3% enjoyed the friendly neighbourhoods. The most important municipal issues indicated by residents in 2008 were the need to improve the road system; traffic issues; increasing urbanization and overcrowding; land use development and sprawl; and the cost of living (including taxes and user fees) in the town. Environmental protection, including environmental assessments for new development and natural preservation measures, was identified as matter of high importance by residents, but low on a scale of satisfaction. In the hamlet of Musselman&#x27;s Lake, 72% of residents in 2009 were concerned about the environmental health of the lake and the surrounding community.

In August 2011, the municipal offices were moved into a business park area at 111 Sandiford Drive in Stouffville. The municipal offices were previously at 37 Sandiford Drive (2008) and Civic Avenue (1959).

===Provincial===
At the provincial level Whitchurch–Stouffville is in the Markham-Stouffville electoral district. Since 2018 this riding has been represented at the Legislative Assembly of Ontario by Paul Calandra, a member of the governing Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario.

===Federal===
At the federal level Whitchurch–Stouffville is in the riding of Markham—Stouffville. Since the federal election of October 2019, the riding has been represented by Helena Jaczek, former Minister of Community and Social Services in Ontario.

==Geography and environment==

The greatest portion of Whitchurch–Stouffville lies on the Oak Ridges Moraine. The moraine consists of knobby hills between 290 and 373 meters above sea level of irregularly bedded layers of unconsolidated sand and gravel (built-up glacial debris) deposited by the meltwater of the Wisconsin glacier some twenty-five thousand to ten thousand years ago. In a few cases the retreating glacier left behind and buried huge blocks of ice which, when melted, created deep, water-filled depressions known as kettle lakes. Preston Lake, Van Nostrand Lake and Musselman Lake are three such examples.

The boundaries of Whitchurch–Stouffville contain a watershed divide. Streams and rivers at the top of the Oak Ridges Moraine flow northward into the Lake Simcoe basin, part of the Lake Huron watershed. The southern sections (south of Bloomington Road) make up the headwaters of the Rouge River and Duffins Creek, both of which flow into the Lake Ontario basin. These headwaters include many smaller streams and creeks throughout southern Whitchurch–Stouffville. Their identification and protection, plus reforestation in these area, has been identified as urgent for rebuilding water-capacity in the Rouge River watershed which can off-set the worst environmental impacts (e.g., flash flooding, erosion and ground water contamination) of rapid urbanization. The heavily wooded Vivian Infiltration Area is an environmentally significant hydrological infiltration area that contributes groundwater to the Oak Ridges aquifer complex.

The northwestern corner of Whitchurch–Stouffville is outside the moraine and is part of the Schomberg Lake plain, an ancient lake-bed overlain by silts and fine sands. The soil formed over the former lake-bed is well-drained, arable farmland.
The southernmost portion of Whitchurch–Stouffville west of Highway 48 lies below the moraine and is a clay-loam till plain.

Tree species native to Whitchurch–Stouffville include: American Mountain Ash, Balsam Fir, Bitternut Hickory, Black Cherry, Black Spruce, Bur Oak, Eastern Hemlock, Eastern White Cedar, Peachleaf Willow, Pin Cherry, Red Oak, Red Maple, Red Pine, Shagbark Hickory, Silver Maple, Sugar Maple, Tamarack, Trembling Aspen, White Birch, White Oak, White Pine and White Spruce. In 2012, Whitchurch–Stouffville&#x27;s forest cover was 28.9%.

Whitchurch–Stouffville&#x27;s water supply system is both groundwater-based with five municipal wells and since 2009 lake-based (Lake Ontario) as well. 5,500 cubic metres of water are withdrawn from the Oak Ridges Aquifer and the Thorncliffe Aquifer daily. Stouffville&#x27;s well-water is chlorinated for disinfection, and sodium silicate is added to keep iron from staining plumbing fixtures and laundry. Two wells receive additional disinfection through an ultraviolet (UV) system. Three groundwater wells are in close proximity to the settlement area of Stouffville (Main Street, east of 10th Line); consequently 239 &quot;significant drinking water threats&quot; have been identified.

Whitchurch–Stouffville has a continental climate moderated by the Great Lakes and influenced by warm, moist air masses from the south, and cold, dry air from the north. The Oak Ridges Moraine affects levels of precipitation: as air masses arrive from Lake Ontario and reach the elevated ground surface of the moraine, they rise causing precipitation.

Under the Köppen climate classification, Stouffville has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;) with warm, humid summers and cold winters.

Because of increasing greenhouse gas emissions, the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources estimates a 1 degree increase in summer and 2 degree increase in winter average temperatures in the region between 2011 and 2040, and a 0% to 10% decrease in precipitation (compared to averages between 1970 and 2000).

Smog producing ground-level ozone is a problem affecting the entire Greater Toronto Area. A major pathway for airborne pollutants flows from the upper Midwest United States and the Ohio River Valley and across southern Ontario and Toronto; key sources are coal-burning power-plants and vehicle engines. On &quot;episode days&quot; (O3 &gt; 82 ppb), Whitchurch–Stouffville reaches its peak about one to two hours later than Toronto. Smog Advisory Alerts are issued by the Ministry of the Environment when smog conditions are expected to reach the poor category in Ontario. The Greater Toronto Area had 13 smog days in 2008, 29 in 2007, 11 in 2006, 48 in 2005.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Whitchurch-Stouffville had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.


In 2021 with a population of 49,864, 35% of residents were immigrants. The number of visible minorities grew from 4.53% in 2001, to 24.5% in 2011 and 45.8% in 2021 (the trend is expected to continue through 2031). In 2018–19, 43% of the Grade 3 children in one of the community&#x27;s newer schools were effectively bi-lingual (i.e., the first language learned at home was other than English).

According to the 2021 Census, English is the mother tongue for 61.4% of Whitchurch–Stouffville residents. Immigrant languages with the most native speakers are Cantonese (8.2%), Mandarin (4.5%) and Tamil (3.8%).

The most common non-European ethnic origins represented in Whitchurch-Stoufville as per the 2021 census are Chinese (17%), Indian (India) (5.2%), Sri Lankan (3.2%), Filipino (3%), and Tamil (2.8%).

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===
Primarily roadways include Highway 48, Highway 407, and Highway 404, which are in turn complemented by a network of regional roads that form a grid pattern across the town. In 1994, a plan to connect urban Stouffville directly to Highway 401 via the proposed East Metro Freeway was cancelled in large part due to the concerns of residents and the work of the Rouge River activist groups. Ninth Line has since been widened to handle traffic load south to Highway 407 in Markham and onto Highway 404 to connect with Highway 401.

Whitchurch–Stouffville is traversed by two railway lines: One is Canadian National Railway&#x27;s primary freight corridor connecting Greater Toronto to Northern Ontario and Western Canada, which is being considered for future GO Transit train service with stations in the communities of Vandorf and Gormley (West). The other railway line, formerly the Toronto and Nipissing Railway, is now owned by GO Transit and hosts Stouffville line passenger service to and from Toronto. This line includes two stations in Whitchurch–Stouffville: the Stouffville GO Station in urban Stouffville, and the line&#x27;s terminus, Old Elm GO Station, located to Stouffville&#x27;s northeast. The York-Durham Heritage Railway also runs historical trains between the station and Uxbridge on summer weekends.

Until 2012, York Region Transit (YRT) operated two routes (9 and 15) within urban Stouffville, with connection to the Markham-Stouffville Hospital and other Markham routes. With the 2012 York Region Transit Service Plan, the two routes were merged, and the frequency of direct buses to the hospital YRT transit hub was reduced. In February 2014, a new Route 15 was introduced, connecting Stouffville to Yonge Street in Richmond Hill and to a future GO-Station in Gormley. GO Transit operates bus services in Stouffville, with buses traveling south into Markham and to Union Station, Toronto, as well as services north to the Town of Uxbridge.

Despite excellent access to the GO Transit and York Region Transit systems, the two systems are not integrated. In 2011, only 6.9% of working Whitchurch–Stouffville residents used public transit to get to work (compare 14% for Ontario), and only 2.7% walked or cycled to work (compare 3.6% for Whitchurch–Stouffville in 2006, and 6.3% for Ontario in 2011). Excellent public transportation options is an increasingly urgent issue for Whitchurch–Stouffville as the town continues to grow with residents who commute daily to Toronto (see Economy below).

===Other amenities===
The Markham Stouffville Hospital is a multi-site hospital that serves approximately 400,000 people in the communities of Markham, Uxbridge, and Whitchurch–Stouffville. The main hospital site is in Markham, 10 kilometers south of urban Stouffville on Ninth Line, and linked by public transportation from Stouffville. The hospital opened in 1990 and, after a successful $50 million expansion campaign, completed a 385,000 sq. ft. addition and renovation project in 2014. The expanded hospital employs an additional 875 staff and 60 new physicians. Residents in northern Whitchurch–Stouffville live in close proximity to the Southlake Regional Health Centre in neighbouring Newmarket.

The &quot;York-Durham Aphasia Centre&quot; is located in Stouffville&#x27;s Parkview Village, and is a program of March of Dimes Canada.

The Town of Whitchurch–Stouffville is policed by the York Regional Police (YRP) and is located within Number Five District; a new Whitchurch–Stouffville Community Sub-Station was opened at 111 Sandiford Drive in 2014. In August 2010 York Regional Police reported to Whitchurch–Stouffville Town Council that the crime rate in the region was down 7% making it &quot;one of Canada&#x27;s safest communities.&quot;

Historic downtown Stouffville offers casual eateries, cafes, pubs, fine dining restaurants, and a variety of boutique stores. Urban Stouffville also has a large-scale format, unenclosed shopping centre anchored by Walmart and Canadian Tire. Stouffville has no regular cinema, however Canadian and international films are shown on the second Wednesday of every month at &quot;The Lebovic Centre for Arts &amp; Entertainment – Nineteen on the Park&quot; (built in 1896 as market and concert hall, converted as cinema in 1923 and became Stouffville Town Hall after 1959 and converted in 2009 as arts venue).

Outside of urban Stouffville, the town operates community centres in the hamlets of Ballantrae, Lemonville, and Vandorf.

==Education==
The first schoolhouse in Stouffville was on Church St., just north of Main St., where the United Church building stands. In 1865, the schoolhouse was purchased by the Methodist congregation and moved across the street; the building still exists as a two-family dwelling. Today Whitchurch–Stouffville is home to several public, Catholic, and private educational institutions.

The York Region District School Board has one public secondary institution in Whitchurch–Stouffville--Stouffville District Secondary School—and eight public elementary institutions: Ballantrae Public School, Glad Park Public School, Summitview Public School, Whitchurch Highlands Public School, Harry Bowes Public School, Oscar Peterson Public School, Wendat Village Public School, and Barbara Reid Public School.

The York Catholic District School Board has three Catholic elementary institutions in Whitchurch–Stouffville: Saint Mark&#x27;s Catholic Elementary (1965), Saint Brigid Catholic Elementary, and Saint Brendan Catholic Elementary (2012). A Kindergarten to Grade 12 Catholic French school opened in 2015. Catholic school students graduating from Grade 8 are either bused to Brother André Catholic High School in Markham, or transfer to the public system and attend Stouffville District Secondary School.

Stouffville also has five private schools: The Progressive Montessori Academy, Stouffville Christian School, Maxfield Academy, Mindtech Montessori School, and Willowgrove Primary School. In 2009, there were 38 licensed child care centres registered in York, but none were located in Whitchurch–Stouffville; eight child care facilities in Whitchurch–Stouffville have subsidized spaces, and four do not.

As the town expands into its Phase 3 Lands (post-2015), new facilities are being planned to accommodate the increasing number of school-aged children in the community.

In some areas of Stouffville, up to 50% of the children are bilingual.

Both the proportion of youth participating in higher education, as well as the proportion of adults in Whitchurch–Stouffville who have completed a university program is growing annually and far exceeds the national average; 31% of adults between 25 and 64 years of age have university training; 70% have some form of post-secondary training. However, there are no post-secondary education campuses located in Whitchurch–Stouffville. In 1877, the village of Stouffville established a Mechanics&#x27; Institute, which later became the Whitchurch-Stouffville Public Library. Emmanuel Bible College in Kitchener, Ontario had its beginnings in Stouffville in 1940. In 1991 the town came close to securing an agreement with Seneca College to open a new campus in Stouffville. In 2010, the Markham Stouffville Hospital (located in Markham) became a teaching site for residents practicing family medicine at the University of Toronto Faculty of Medicine.

==Economy==

Stouffville&#x27;s economy prior to 1900 flourished because of the coming of the railway in 1871, and because of the town&#x27;s location on the juncture of the Markham-Uxbridge Road and the Town Line.

===Employment===
In 2013, Whitchurch–Stouffville had an estimated 11,249 jobs (excluding home- and farm-based businesses), 58.5% of which were full-time, 23.7% part-time, and the rest seasonal. While the manufacturing sector represented the largest number of local jobs in 2001, the actual numbers stagnated over the next decade between 1,300 and 1,600 jobs. By 2012, only 12% of local jobs were in the manufacturing sector (1,351), compared to 39% of jobs (or 4,419) in the retail and personal services sector.

While the number of businesses in Whitchurch–Stouffville dropped from 750 in 2009 to 690 in 2013, the total number of local jobs went from 10,300 to 13,700.

The majority of employed Whitchurch–Stouffville residents commute to Toronto and its environs for employment; in 2011 the median commuting time was 30 minutes. In the same year, the unemployment rate for Whitchurch–Stouffville was 6.3% (up from 4.8% in 2006), but below the Ontario average of 8.3%.

Whitchurch–Stouffville is York Region&#x27;s largest &quot;mineral aggregate resource area;&quot; these gravel sites and designated resource areas are located north and south of Bloomington Road, and all lie within the boundaries of the Oak Ridges Moraine. Under the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act (2001), future aggregate resource operations must meet stringent review and approval standards.

In 2001, 20,406 acres (8,258 hectares) of land in Whitchurch–Stouffville was dedicated to farming; 45% of the farms were between 10 and in size; 25% focused on &quot;other animal production,&quot; (792 horses and ponies on 50 farms) and 24% in greenhouse, nursery and floriculture production. Gross farm receipts for 2000 were $27,182,691; gross forestry receipts (once the backbone of Whitchurch Township&#x27;s wealth) were $59,098.

Since 2009, the town&#x27;s economic development strategy has focused on small and large knowledge-based industries, agricultural and environmental services, and not-for-profit organizations. Whitchurch–Stouffville is home to two internationally respected, church-based non-governmental service organizations: Emmanuel International Canada, EMAS Canada and &quot;Christian Blind Mission – Canada&quot; (CBM), all located on Stouffville Road near Kennedy Avenue.

===Household income and housing===
By 2013, the town had 14,334 residential units, and projected the building of 6,525 new residential units between 2013 and 2021—and a further 1,969 units by 2031—in order to accommodate a net population increase of 17,408 new residents by 2031.

In 2013 the median value of dwellings in Whitchurch–Stouffville was $471,000, or 79% higher than the provincial median of $263,500, and the town&#x27;s estimated average household income was $141,885; the Ontario average was $96,1300.

Only 8.8% of the private dwellings in Whitchurch–Stouffville were apartments (including duplexes) in 2011, down from 15.2% in 2006, and significantly below the provincial average was 30%. In 2009, the ratio of owned dwellings to rented dwellings in Whitchurch–Stouffville was almost 6 to 1, compared to provincial average of 2.5 to 1. In 2011, 30 per cent of renters in Whitchurch–Stouffville spent more than half their income on shelter costs, the highest in the province.

Because of the high cost of housing in Whitchurch–Stouffville relative to the provincial average, 36% of Whitchurch–Stouffville businesses said in 2012 that the community was poorly positioned to attract new immigrant employees, and 45% said the same for retaining and attracting employees under 30 years of age. Nonetheless, in 2012 Stouffville residents protested zoning designations in the Town&#x27;s Official Plan which called for apartments near their own neighbourhoods.

Whitchurch–Stouffville has 51 units of public social housing and 124 not-for-profit units for the elderly (including a long-term care facility).

Social services in Whitchurch–Stouffville include the &quot;Whitchurch–Stouffville Food Bank&quot; and the &quot;Care and Share Thrift Store&quot; (Mennonite Central Committee), both located on Ringwood Drive in the Community of Stouffville. The YMCA also operates an employment resource centre in Stouffville.

==Sports==
The first organized sport in Stouffville was curling in 1890 on the Mill Pond (today site of the Latcham Art Gallery and the Mennonite &quot;Care and Share&quot; Thrift Store). Lacrosse was also played at this time, and in 1897, Stouffville won the Ontario championships. The first hockey team was organized about 1900, and at the turn of the century the Stouffville rink below Burkholder Street was considered &quot;the largest and best arranged rink in Canada.&quot; Lawnbowling has also been played in Stouffville since the early 1900s as well as organized men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s baseball.

The most important recreational facilities in Whitchurch–Stouffville are &quot;Soccer City&quot;, a 55,775 square feet indoor soccer complex (completed 2013); the &quot;Stouffville Clippers Sports Complex&quot;, with two NHL size ice pads (completed 2010); the &quot;Stouffville Arena&quot;, with two ice pads; the &quot;Whitchurch-Stouffville Leisure Centre&quot;, with a 25-meter pool, hot tub, gym and fitness centre, and &quot;Bethesda Park&quot;, with two ball diamonds, a senior soccer pitch and four mini sports fields (completed 2010).

Whitchurch–Stouffville is home to many golf courses, including Emerald Hills, Rolling Hills, Spring Lakes, Maples of Ballantrae, Ballantrae Golf &amp; Country Club, St. Andrews East Golf &amp; Country Club, Timber Creek Mini Golf &amp; Family Fun Centre, Sleepy Hollow, Meadowbrook and Station Creek.

===Organized sports===
The Town has a Junior &quot;A&quot; ice hockey team, the Stouffville Spirit. The Stouffville Amateur Hockey League (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s leagues), the Stouffville-Markham Girls Hockey Association, Whitchurch–Stouffville Minor Hockey Association, the Whitchurch–Stouffville Skating Club, and the Stouffville Adult Skating Club offer programs in the town&#x27;s arenas.

The Whitchurch–Stouffville Soccer Club was established in 1977 and had 1,250 members in 2010. The club uses fields at Bethesda Park, the Stouffville Arena, Bruce&#x27;s Mill Conservation Area, fields owned by Teva Canada, and the &quot;Soccer City&quot; indoor facility.

The Whitchurch–Stouffville Softball Association is a volunteer-run house-league organization. The association uses eleven ball diamonds in town plus five in the neighbouring villages of Goodwood and Claremont.

===Recreational trails and water recreation===

1,142 hectares of the twenty York Regional Forest tracts (or slightly more than half of the total) are found within the borders of Whitchurch–Stouffville.

&quot;The Whitchurch Conservation Area&quot; covers ten hectares, and is accessed on Aurora Sideroad, three kilometres east of Woodbine Ave. It is connected to a larger York Region Forest Tract and to trails of the Oak Ridges Trail Association.

&quot;The Pangman Springs Conservation Area&quot; is accessed from Kennedy Road between Davis Drive and Aurora Road or from the Porritt tract of the York Region Forest using an Oak Ridges Trail Association side trail.

&quot;Bruce&#x27;s Mill Conservation Area&quot; in Whitchurch–Stouffville is the northern gateway to Rouge Park. The Master Plan for the conservation area includes not only a trail system within the park, but also future trail connections to inter-regional trails.

An extensive trail system within urban Stouffville is being developed that connects to the larger forested areas of the Whitchurch–Stouffville. The most significant trail begins in town along the Stouffville Creek and leads through a mature forest around the Stouffville Reservoir. In 2012, Whitchurch–Stouffville had 32 kilometers of trails.

Whitchurch–Stouffville is also home to a number of kettle lakes which are ideal for outdoor water recreation. While these glacier-formed lakes are crown property, and the resources of all levels of government are used for their regulation, protection and preservation, the actual perimeter of the lakes are in private hands (kettle lakes are not fed by creeks or rivers) and therefore only homeowners in the sub-communities have access rights to Whitchurch–Stouffville&#x27;s lakes. Access to Musselman&#x27;s Lake via Cedar Beach Trailer Park was lost in 2012, while access to Preston Lake was lost when Landford Development purchased the west-shore beach and trailer park and built estate properties with a shared private beach. In 2008 the town&#x27;s development plans included a trail system with access to Preston Lake, but this was met with opposition from Preston Lake residents who desired to protect their exclusive access. Interest and support for the purchase or expropriation of land for public access to the town&#x27;s most important natural and recreational assets has grown with the town&#x27;s development.

The Town of Whitchurch–Stouffville operated an outdoor public swimming pool until 2010 when it was closed due to disrepair.

==Arts, culture and media==
In 2006, the town of Whitchurch–Stouffville developed and adopted &quot;Municipal Cultural Policy&quot; as a framework for planning and delivering cultural services. Whitchurch–Stouffville&#x27;s investment in the arts has been slow, and consequently residents have not only fallen below the national average on exposure to the performing arts, museums and galleries, but the average exposure has decreased from 2006 to 2010.

===Arts and entertainment centre===
Whitchurch–Stouffville&#x27;s deficit in the performing arts has been addressed in part by the recent rehabilitation of the former Stouffville Town Hall (constructed in 1896), a redevelopment that created a multifaceted arts, culture and entertainment centre in downtown Stouffville; &quot;The Lebovic Centre for Arts &amp; Entertainment – Nineteen on the Park&quot; opened its doors to the public in May 2009.

===Art gallery and visual art===
Latcham Art Centre (formerly The Latcham Gallery) is a public art gallery established in 1979, by a group of local artists and supporters who saw the need for an arts facility in Whitchurch–Stouffville. The art centre was named after Arthur Latcham, a local philanthropist who donated money for the building on 6240 Main Street that housed the art centre from 1979-2018. Latcham Art Centre hosts 5-6 curated exhibitions a year featuring contemporary work by provincial artists and three community exhibitions, including an annual juried exhibition, an exhibition of work by a local graduating high school art class, and an exhibition of work by students from local elementary schools. Along with exhibitions, Latcham Art Centre provides educational and public programs including school visits, public lectures, art workshops and classes, and tours led by the curator, art educators and exhibiting artists. Admission to Latcham Art Centre is free. The art centre is a member of the Ontario Association of Art Galleries and its operations are supported by the Town of Whitchurch–Stouffville and the Ontario Arts Council. In August 2018, Latcham Art Centre moved from 6240 Main Street to the Whitchurch-Stouffville Leisure Centre, changing its name from The Latcham Gallery to Latcham Art Centre.

Since 2000, artists in Whitchurch–Stouffville have organized the &quot;Whitchurch-Stouffville Studio Tour,&quot; featuring more than two dozen artists in several venues across Whitchurch–Stouffville. The Studio Tour takes place the weekend after Thanksgiving each year. In 2008, the Tour was nominated for &quot;The Premier&#x27;s award for excellence in art.&quot;

===Library===
The Whitchurch-Stouffville Public Library is located in the &quot;Whitchurch-Stouffvile Leisure Centre&quot; (constructed in 2001), a facility occupied jointly by the department of Leisure Services and the library. The population served by the library doubled between 2005 and 2013, and circulation increased 109%. Library expenditures dropped from 5.1% of town operating expenses in 2004 to 3.0% in 2007, and 2.7% in the 2014 budget. In 2014, Whitchurch–Stouffville&#x27;s per capita library costs were $26, the lowest of twenty-four Ontario towns in its population category (median $42). In 2010, the &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Third Annual Smart Cities Rankings&quot; showed that for residents in Whitchurch–Stouffville, &quot;exposure to reading&quot; had declined annually from 2006 to 2010, and fell significantly below the national average. A library expansion was first projected for 2009. In June 2011 local book clubs and individuals began a grass-roots campaign to petition for greater municipal funding for the public library. In 2012, the Town commissioned a study of the library&#x27;s current and future space needs. A 2014 expansion design was rejected by the newly elected Town Council in 2015, and the minimum space requirements for a community library were vigorously challenged.

===Festivals and fairs===
The &quot;Stouffville Strawberry Festival&quot; is a traditional community fair on the Canada Day weekend, which celebrates Stouffville&#x27;s agricultural heritage.

The annual Stouffville Country Ribfest is held by the Town of Whitchurch-Stouffville every August in Memorial Park and is the largest event of the year. This event features ribbers, merchants, food vendors, a midway and more and attracts over 40 000 visitors a year. The Town also holds various other events including (but not limited to) Victoria Day Fireworks, Symphony Under the Stars and the Stouffville Santa Claus Parade.

The Markham Fair is hosted by the Markham and East York Agricultural Society, and supported by both the City of Markham and the Town of Whitchurch–Stouffville (Stouffville south of Main Street was part of Markham Township prior to 1971). The Markham Fair dates back to 1844 and is one of Canada&#x27;s oldest and largest fairs, hosting upwards of 80,000 visitors. The fair is held on the weekend before Thanksgiving. It is held at the Markham fairgrounds, directly south of the Stouffville town border.

Bruce&#x27;s Mill Conservation Area hosts an annual &quot;Sugarbush Maple Syrup Festival&quot; over four weeks in March and April.

In February the Musselman Lake community hosts an annual &quot;Winter Carnival&quot; at Cedar Beach.

York Region&#x27;s &quot;Spring Forest Festival&quot; is held annually during Earth Week (April) in the York Regional Forest, Eldred King Tract, Highway 48 (just south of Vivian Road).

The annual &quot;Wine and Food Festival&quot; (June) is organized by the Ballantrae Golf and Country Club.

On the third Saturday of September, Stouffville&#x27;s Willowgrove Farm hosts the annual GTA &quot;Toronto Mennonite Festival and Quilt Auction&quot;.

===Museum===

The idea for the &quot;Whitchurch–Stouffville Museum&quot; began in 1969 as a civic-minded project by a group of local residents. After opening in 1971 in the hamlet of Vandorf the site has grown over the years from the original museum building. The museum site includes five historic structures from the former Township of Whitchurch: the Bogarttown Schoolhouse (1857), a pioneer log cabin (c. 1850), a Victorian Farmhouse built by James Brown (1857), a barn (c. 1830) and Vandorf Public School (1870). In 2012, the Whitchurch–Stouffville Museum added a Community Centre that blended the old with the new by joining the two schoolhouses. The new facility includes a Research Room, Exhibition Gallery, Discovery Room, and two rental spaces.

===Media===
The town is currently served by two local community newspapers: the &quot;Stouffville Free Press&quot; and the &quot;Stouffville Sun-Tribune&quot;. &quot;SNAP Stouffville/Uxbridge&quot; is a print publication which specializes in a photographic view of life in the community. &quot;Stouffville Connects&quot; is an online publication focussed on community contributed journalism. A community radio station, &quot;WhiStle Radio&quot; (CIWS-FM), was launched in 2008.

===Film and television===
Movies partially shot on location in the community of Stouffville include: &quot;The Russell Girl&quot; (2008), &quot;Stir of Echoes: The Homecoming&quot; (2007), &quot;Who Killed Atlanta&#x27;s Children?&quot; (2000), &quot;On Hostile Ground&quot; (2000), &quot;Strike!&quot; (1998), &quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot; (1997), &quot;Bad Day on the Block&quot; (1997), &quot;Martin&#x27;s Day&quot; (1984), and &quot;The Dead Zone&quot; (1983). Television shows shot in Stouffville include episodes from &quot;Warehouse 13&quot; (2010), &quot;The West Wing&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Nikita&quot;, &quot;Schitt&#x27;s Creek&quot; (2015), and &quot;Curse of the Axe&quot; (documentary film on the Wendat-Huron village site discovered in Stouffville).

Films and television series shot at &quot;Shadow Lake Centre&quot; in Whitchurch–Stouffville (Musselman Lake) include &quot;1-800-Missing&quot;, &quot;Tarzan &amp; Jane&quot; (2002), &quot;The Crossing&quot; (2000), &quot;Run the Wild Fields&quot;, &quot;Ice Men&quot; (2005), &quot;Top Cops&quot;, &quot;The Loretta Claiborne Story&quot;, &quot;True Romance&quot; (1993), &quot;Ready or Not&quot;, &quot;The White Dog Sacrifice&quot;, and &quot;The Littlest Hobo&quot; (Summitview Public School).

<text>Kerstin Margareta &quot; Kiki&quot; Håkansson (23 July 1929 – 4 November 2024) was a Swedish model and beauty queen who was the first winner of the Miss World beauty pageant.

==Miss World 1951==
Originally the &quot;Festival Bikini Contest&quot;, Miss World was organized by Eric Morley as a mid-century advertisement for swimwear at the Festival of Britain. Håkansson was a photo and fashion model when she was crowned Miss Sweden World in 1951 and subsequently won the London pageant.

Håkansson wore a bikini during the crowning ritual, after which she was condemned by the Pope, and some countries with strong religious traditions threatened to withdraw delegates. In 1952, bikinis were banned from the pageant and replaced with more modest swimwear. While they were eventually reintroduced to Miss World, Håkansson remains the only winner to have received her crown while wearing one.

==Later life==
Håkansson declined an Italian film contract and an American modelling contract and continued her modelling career in Europe, working for the &quot;Comité français de l&#x27;élégance&quot;. She studied French couture sewing, and judged several beauty pageants. She married Dallas Anderson, an American sculptor whom she met when he was studying in Europe; after nine years in Copenhagen, they moved to the United States, where Håkansson retired from modelling and Anderson became a faculty member at Brigham Young University in Utah.

==Personal life and death==
Håkansson and her husband had three children. She died in her sleep on 4 November 2024 in California, at the age of 95.

<doc id="386642" wikidata="Q4892182" url="?curid=386642" title="Berkley Horse">
<text>The Berkley Horse is a BDSM apparatus, designed for, and by, Theresa Berkley in 1828. She referred to it as a &quot;chevalet&quot;.

According to the account of Henry Spencer Ashbee:

:A notorious machine was invented for Mrs Berkley to flog gentlemen upon, in the spring of 1828. It is capable of being opened to a considerable extent, so as to bring the body to any angle that might be desirable. There is a print in Mrs Berkley&#x27;s memoirs, representing a man upon it quite naked. A woman is sitting in a chair exactly under it, with her bosom, belly, and bush exposed: she is manualizing his , whilst Mrs Berkley is birching his posteriors.

He continues:

:When the new flogging machine was invented, the designer told her it would bring her into notice, and go by her name after her death; and it did cause her to be talked of, and brought her a great deal of business. [...] The original horse is among the models of the Society of Arts at the Adelphi, and was presented by Doctor Vance, her executor.

In one surviving letter, a customer hearing about the Berkley Horse proffered Theresa Berkley this pricing for her services: &quot;a pound sterling for the first blood drawn, two pounds sterling if the blood runs down to my heels, three pounds sterling if my heels are bathed in blood, four pounds sterling if the blood reaches the floor, and five pounds sterling if you succeed in making me lose consciousness.&quot;

The Society of Arts at the Adelphi is now the Royal Society of Arts: they took possession of the Horse in 1837, with public exhibition promoted by radical publisher George Cannon. An illustration of the apparatus is reproduced in the original 1880s edition of Ashbee&#x27;s &quot;Index Librorum Prohibitorum&quot;, but omitted from the 1969 reprint. It is unclear whether the original device was preserved by the Royal Society of Arts.

<text>Uxbridge is a township in the Regional Municipality of Durham in south-central Ontario, Canada.

== Communities ==
The main centre in the township is the namesake community of Uxbridge. Other settlements within the township include the following:

* Uxbridge Township (former 1850-1974): Altona, Coppin&#x27;s Corners, Forsythe Glenn, Glasgow, Glen Major, Goodwood, Quaker Village, Roseville, Siloam
* Scott Township (former 1850-1974): Leaskdale, Sandford, Udora, Zephyr

== History ==
It was named for Uxbridge, England, a name which was derived from &quot;Wixan&#x27;s Bridge&quot;.

The first settlers in the area were Quakers who started arriving in 1806 from the Catawissa area of Pennsylvania. The community&#x27;s oldest building, the Uxbridge Friends Meeting House, was built in 1820 and overlooks the town from Quaker Hill, a kilometre to the west.

The township was incorporated as a municipality under York County in 1850 and became part of the newly formed Ontario County two years later.

The first passenger-carrying narrow-gauge railway in North America, the Toronto and Nipissing Railway arrived in Uxbridge in June 1871, and for over a decade Uxbridge was the headquarters of the railway. In 1872, the Village of Uxbridge was separated from the Township and incorporated as a separate entity.

With the creation of the Regional Municipality of Durham in 1974, Uxbridge Township was amalgamated with the Town of Uxbridge and Scott Township to create an expanded Township of Uxbridge.

== Uxbridge today ==
Today, Uxbridge is as a mostly suburban community in northern Durham Region. Major manufacturing employers include Pine Valley Packaging (packaging, containers and portable shelters), Koch-Glitsch Canada (mass transfer systems) and Hela Canada (spice and ingredient manufacture). Uxbridge area is also home to many small industrial businesses, cultivation farms and beekeeping organizations. Many residents commute to other centres in Durham and York Regions and beyond.

The 30-bed Uxbridge Cottage Hospital opened in 1958 is a site associated with the Markham Stouffville Hospital Corporation. A new ward of the hospital was added in 2022.

Uxbridge is twinned with Catawissa, Pennsylvania, in the United States, from which many of its settlers originated.

Uxbridge has three community newspapers: the &quot;Uxbridge Times Journal&quot;, the &quot;Standard&quot; and the &quot;Cosmos&quot;. Uxbridge is also served by a monthly community magazine and events guide, &quot;Uxbridge Town Talk&quot;.

== Coat of arms ==
The motto is an abbreviation of “On to it Uxbridge,” meaning “Let’s go Uxbridge.” It refers to Ontario through the abbreviation “Ont.,” while being a rallying call for the township and its residents to move forward into the future with confidence.

== Attractions ==
In 2009 Uxbridge Township received federal designation by Industry Canada as the &quot;Trail Capital of Canada&quot;, resulting from the over 220 kilometres of managed trails on over of protected greenspace within its borders. Uxbridge trails run through and alongside historic villages, mixed forests, meadows, ponds, streams, and wetlands. A number of major trail systems run through the Township, including the Oak Ridges Trail and the Trans-Canada Trail.

The Uxbridge Historical Centre (formerly Uxbridge-Scott Museum and Archives) possesses a number of artifacts, mostly related to the township&#x27;s agricultural heritage and of the town&#x27;s Quaker heritage. The museum also includes ten heritage buildings as well as heritage herb and flower gardens. It offers seasonal events, workshops, and specialty programs. It was formed in 1972 by the Uxbridge-Scott Historical Society, who holds an annual Heritage Day festival to supports the museum.

There are also a number of attractions related to the history of the area. Uxbridge&#x27;s Elgin Park, named after Lord Elgin, was the site of a picnic held by 19th century Prime Minister John A. Macdonald in a re-election bid. In addition, the Thomas Foster Memorial Temple, erected in 1935–36 by the former mayor of Toronto, is situated a short distance north of town. Inspired by Foster&#x27;s visit to India, the Temple was designed by architects J.H. Craig (1889–1954) and H.H. Madrill (1889–1998). Finally, the former home of famed author Lucy Maud Montgomery of Anne of Green Gables fame is situated in Leaskdale. Montgomery lived in the area from 1911 to 1926, and wrote half of her books at what is now the site of the Leaskdale Manse Museum.

On July 1, 2024, the Ontario government opened the Uxbridge Urban Provincial Park in the Township of Uxbridge. The park is the province&#x27;s first urban provincial park. The park was first announced in the 2023 provincial budget, and the proposed urban park may include up to 532 hectares (1,315 acres) of provincially-owned lands. Instead of a single connected block, the park is made up of individual parcels of lands within the Uxbridge area. And while they are not all currently connected, it is possible they might be linked by other lands, recreational areas, and trail systems in the future.
